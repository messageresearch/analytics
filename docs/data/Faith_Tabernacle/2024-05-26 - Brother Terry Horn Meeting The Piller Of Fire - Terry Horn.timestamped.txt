[42:27] there's none like him certainly
[42:30] appreciate the privilege to be in the
[42:31] house of the Lord this
[42:33] morning it's good to be a
[42:35] Christian thank you for the sunshine
[42:37] thank you for the rain thank you for
[42:39] God's grace thank you
[42:42] musicians amen
[42:46] hallelujah I was just listening to a
[42:48] couple of the words of sister Lisa's
[42:51] song and only Jesus can satisfy we know
[42:55] that if you want to be turn to the Book
[42:57] of Exodus we're going to read three or
[42:59] four places Exodus and then acts and
[43:02] then Matthew but I'll give you the
[43:03] scripture as we
[43:04] go um but I just was thinking the word
[43:07] one of the verses She said if you're
[43:09] looking for life nothing only satisfies
[43:12] but the Lord Jesus do you realize that
[43:15] now I'm going to I was actually we were
[43:18] archived a brother from South Africa and
[43:20] he preached over two and a half about
[43:22] two and a half hours so I won't go that
[43:24] long I'm a little you can turn that down
[43:26] a little bit it's a little little
[43:28] reverberation or something anyway when
[43:32] you really begin to think about it why
[43:34] do people turn to drugs why do people
[43:36] turn to alcohol why people turn to any
[43:39] of the illicit things any of the evil
[43:41] things there's only one thing that I'll
[43:43] satisfy and that's Christ and what it is
[43:46] they they've actually are looking for
[43:48] the meaning of life everything that we
[43:50] do our job our focus our home our spouse
[43:53] everything that we do is has a meaning
[43:56] and people searching for meaning of life
[43:58] only God can satisfy the understanding
[44:01] of the meaning for life and it's such Le
[44:04] oosa when when there is no
[44:07] light uh Total Blackout in Le osia
[44:11] there's very well is actually just one
[44:13] way you know to find light and that's
[44:15] through the message of the hour but
[44:17] people are searching for light they're
[44:18] searching for not searching for light
[44:20] they're searching for the meaning of
[44:22] life in all aspects of the meaning of
[44:24] life but they can't find it and there's
[44:27] only one thing that'll satisfy and
[44:28] that's Christ only one thing so that's a
[44:31] tremendous Revelation to realize that
[44:34] only Christ can truly satisfy no nothing
[44:38] else nothing
[44:40] else praise the Lord all right well
[44:43] let's
[44:44] start with uh ma with Exodus chapter 13
[44:48] verse 20-
[44:53] 22 and I hopefully they can know we not
[44:56] going to be able to put anything on the
[44:57] screen today are we okay that's fine I
[45:01] just we'll just let you run through your
[45:03] Bibles
[45:04] then but we're actually just going to
[45:06] read three or four places here just kind
[45:08] of a background we won't be able to uh
[45:11] just for kind of a flow of what
[45:14] direction I'm going in Exodus
[45:18] 13:20 it says 13 20-22 and they took
[45:21] their journey through sukov and encamped
[45:23] in etham in the edge of the Wilderness
[45:26] and the Lord Lord went before them by
[45:29] day in a pillar of cloud to lead them
[45:33] the way and by night in a pillar of fire
[45:36] to give them light to go by day and
[45:39] night verse 22 and he took not away the
[45:43] pillar of the cloud by day nor the
[45:45] pillar of Fire by night from before the
[45:48] people now that verse is yet true today
[45:51] amen for 40 years in the wilderness they
[45:53] had the pillar of fire the pillar of
[45:54] cloud and it was to lead them lead them
[45:58] by that light same thing
[46:01] today also in Acts 9 verse 1-5 these are
[46:05] all
[46:07] familiar I'll read Safe time while
[46:09] you're looking and Saul y breathing out
[46:11] threatenings and Slaughter against the
[46:13] Disciples of the Lord he went unto the
[46:15] high priest and desired of him letters
[46:18] to Damascus to the synagogues and if he
[46:21] found any of this way whether they were
[46:24] men or women he might bring them bound
[46:26] into Jerusalem and as he journeyed he
[46:29] came near Damascus and so there shine
[46:31] around him
[46:33] a light from heaven and he fell to the
[46:37] Earth and heard a voice saying unto him
[46:40] Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and he
[46:43] said who art thou
[46:45] Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom
[46:49] thou persecutest is hard it is hard for
[46:52] thee to kick against the Pricks so we
[46:55] already see a focus Old Testament New
[46:58] Testament Matthew
[47:01] 3:11 speaking of John the Baptist
[47:03] speaking he said I indeed baptize you
[47:06] with water unto repentance but he that
[47:09] cometh after me is mightier than I whose
[47:12] shoes I am not worthy to Bear he shall
[47:15] bapt baptize you with the Holy Ghost and
[47:20] with
[47:23] fire and we'll look at one other
[47:25] scripture Luke 4 And1
[47:30] this scripture really
[47:31] is hard to really understand we know
[47:35] Jesus was 100% God and Jesus was 100%
[47:39] man G Luke 4:1 and Jesus being full of
[47:43] the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and
[47:46] was led by the spirit Into the
[47:48] Wilderness he just got baptized and he
[47:51] just got filled with the Holy Ghost it's
[47:53] hard to imagine that the Lord Jesus
[47:55] anytime that he wasn't filled with the
[47:57] Holy Ghost because he was God the
[47:58] fullness of the godhead bodily but the
[48:01] man part of him Christ the man Christ is
[48:05] the anointed but the man he's 100% man
[48:07] he's 100% God but he had to be baptized
[48:11] to fulfill all righteous and he had to
[48:13] be filled with the Holy Ghost the Bible
[48:14] says right clear there and I'll show you
[48:16] the quotes in a little while so let's
[48:18] just pray if we could and see what the
[48:20] Lord will help us this morning Heavenly
[48:22] Father we thank you Lord for the reading
[48:24] of the word we thank you Lord that we
[48:26] can stand before for your redeem the
[48:28] purchase of the blood of the Lord Jesus
[48:30] we're happy to be part of this end time
[48:32] bride Under the Umbrella of a word
[48:34] message we lord we're so thankful for
[48:36] that pray that we take these thoughts
[48:38] these scriptures these things you've
[48:40] laid Upon My Heart Lord and may it be a
[48:42] blessing to the people may we uh not
[48:45] only just be able to read but Lord you
[48:47] give sense to the reading of the word as
[48:49] the scribes will stand up and read for
[48:51] many hours during the day but Lord you
[48:53] give the sense to the reading of the
[48:55] word the revelation we would say in our
[48:57] day give us understanding we thank you
[48:59] for this time bless all that's done and
[49:01] said and we pray in the name of the Lord
[49:04] Jesus Christ and everybody says amen God
[49:07] bless you you can be
[49:16] seated really appreciated the U the
[49:18] sermons that well all of them for that
[49:21] matter but especially last weekend
[49:23] brother Sean preaching on uh he talked
[49:27] about that power you know when the the
[49:30] power we'd seen that cloud with that CL
[49:33] the angel would come in power and with
[49:35] power and great glory and they did a
[49:36] really tremendous job I really
[49:38] appreciate Wednesday night just really
[49:40] good we we really appreciate brother sha
[49:42] appreciate ministers that really love
[49:45] this message and preach the message we
[49:46] just preach the message that's what it's
[49:48] all about just preach the message now my
[49:52] subject this morning I'm going to title
[49:54] this meeting that Pillar of Fire and I
[49:57] got the quotes we all have to meet that
[49:58] Pillar of Fire but it may not be just
[50:01] exactly what we might think meeting the
[50:03] pillar of fire but it is meeting that
[50:05] pill of fire now we know that the the
[50:08] the whole message is all about the word
[50:10] it's a word bride it's a word birth it's
[50:13] your word born in the beginning was the
[50:15] word the word's with God the Word was
[50:17] God the word was made flesh and Christ
[50:19] is that word so we know the whole
[50:21] vocabulary of the message is really
[50:23] about Christ it's and then in our Day
[50:26] present day truth is actually uh the
[50:28] word made flesh in Christ in Bride form
[50:31] and brother makes this statement and why
[50:32] is it so important we think about how
[50:35] important it is to to receive the Holy
[50:38] Ghost and not only just the Holy Ghost
[50:39] on our spirit realm which we'll talk
[50:41] about in a little bit but a word birth
[50:43] on our soul it's got to be a change of
[50:45] nature on the soul just not a temporary
[50:48] anointing on the spirit as was the
[50:49] baptism of the Holy goes down Through
[50:51] the Ages we'll talk about that in a
[50:52] minute but there's got to be a a
[50:54] complete transformation of that Soul
[50:57] listen and why brother R says here's the
[51:00] whole focus of the word is why brother
[51:03] ra said lay out say in church a book he
[51:05] said then there there will not be one
[51:08] person this is a tremendous quote
[51:10] there'll not be one person who will sit
[51:12] in the
[51:13] Throne of the Lord Jesus Christ unless
[51:16] he has been living that word your
[51:21] prayers your fastings your repentances
[51:24] no matter what you present to God none
[51:26] of that will gain you the privilege of
[51:28] sitting in that Throne it will be
[51:30] granted only to the word
[51:33] Bride As The Throne of the king is
[51:36] shared with the queen because she is
[51:40] United to him so only they who are of
[51:44] that word and he is the word he is that
[51:48] word will share that Throne so if we
[51:51] want to be up there as Queen of Heaven
[51:53] with him guess what we must be that word
[51:57] we must live that word we must be that
[51:59] Living Word we must be the word made
[52:01] flesh that's why the the whole issue
[52:04] today the not issue but the whole Focus
[52:06] today is the bride is fleshing out that
[52:08] word we become him we become him and how
[52:13] do we follow him I'll show you brother
[52:16] man says also in the L Odyssey and age
[52:18] remember we have shown clearly All
[52:20] Through the Ages that even as Adam and
[52:22] Eve fell because they left the word
[52:27] so the Ephesian age fell by turning
[52:29] slightly from the word until with every
[52:33] age continuing to turn away we have a
[52:36] final repudiation of the word by the
[52:40] World Church system that's where we are
[52:42] today and then it's of course it's going
[52:44] to finally wind up in the world Council
[52:46] of churches headed up by Rome and then
[52:48] the Beast takes over the layot of see
[52:50] and age ends in a blackout of the word
[52:53] are we there have they been there since'
[52:55] 63 absolutely Total Blackout no wonder
[52:59] God permitted brother bandam to draw a
[53:00] little bit of light when they drew it
[53:02] out on the Tabernacle wall there and it
[53:04] was totally blacked out but he gave him
[53:06] permission to draw a little bit of light
[53:07] just a sliver of light just for the
[53:10] bride otherwise there'll be no light I
[53:12] mean the leoty is totally blacked out
[53:15] there is no
[53:16] light the leot age leine age ends in a
[53:20] blackout of the word thereby causing a
[53:23] departure of the Lord from the midst he
[53:26] stands outside calling his own who will
[53:30] follow him by by by obedience to that
[53:36] word obedience to that
[53:39] word now let's get started we don't need
[53:42] an introduction just just start right in
[53:43] the middle let me cover some things here
[53:45] as we go on Christ is the mystery of God
[53:48] revealed Christ is the secret of God
[53:51] revealed the theme of this sermon is of
[53:54] brother sermon in Christ the mystery is
[53:56] Christ in you the hope of glory so now
[53:59] since Christ has come down Revelations
[54:01] 10:1 we know that he is here we have to
[54:04] recognize he is here in the fullness of
[54:06] the word not in bodily form in the
[54:07] fullness of the word and so then the
[54:10] this Mighty God is unveiled to the elect
[54:13] only to the elect all that God was he
[54:15] poured into Christ all that Christ was
[54:17] you know we think about that all that
[54:18] Christ was he poured into the church the
[54:20] bride now we believe that or we don't so
[54:23] if all he was was poured in us then we
[54:25] have to be flesh out Christ herself we
[54:27] have to she is him it's got to be that
[54:33] way I mean the masculine the feminine is
[54:37] taking on the masculine we're part of
[54:38] him he's the masculine we're the
[54:40] feminine we are he's the bridegroom we
[54:43] are the bride and we are taking on his
[54:45] name his nature
[54:47] everything but you know Satan all satan
[54:50] does he he only can copy and pervert
[54:52] what God is doing in the spiritual Satan
[54:55] is a of course trying to copy in the
[54:57] natural so why do we have all this woke
[54:59] stuff and she is he and he is she and
[55:01] and it's all just a perversion of Satan
[55:03] trying to copy what God's doing in the
[55:05] spiritual where we're really becoming
[55:07] him they don't even know what what
[55:09] gender they're of it's just it's just
[55:12] Satan's perverted way everything God
[55:14] does in the spiritual Satan tries to
[55:16] mimic it but only can do it in a
[55:18] perverted
[55:19] way brother bam declared in 1962 said
[55:23] there is an infant church but she's
[55:25] taken form the church is built strictly
[55:27] on divine revelation Matthew 16 divine
[55:30] revelation he said that we need to call
[55:33] on God a lot more than anything I
[55:35] suppose for revelation we need to call
[55:37] on him for Revelation because the church
[55:38] has built on Revelation uh everything
[55:40] that we have need of of course is in
[55:42] that seed but we need God to reveal uh
[55:45] each day of our life what you know our
[55:47] path to take he's our leadership now
[55:50] Paul never knew Jesus physically only by
[55:53] Revelation and all true Revelation comes
[55:55] from God we know that we can give you
[55:58] information God gives a revelation I can
[56:00] I can preach you a principle I can teach
[56:02] you a principle God has a give a re
[56:04] Revelation the Revelation is
[56:06] confirmation that it is the truth now
[56:09] God never knew Jesus physically now
[56:11] Peter knew him physically but yet he
[56:12] only had Revelation that come from God
[56:14] even though Peter walk with him fish
[56:16] with him everything the Revelation still
[56:18] had to come by God now we want to talk
[56:21] about Matthew 3:11 he shall baptize you
[56:23] with the Holy Ghost and Fire now let's
[56:25] look at this statement for a minute
[56:27] every human I'm going to make a
[56:28] statement here and you'll understand in
[56:30] a minute every human has got to be con
[56:32] be consumed with some kind of a
[56:35] fire he said Matthew 3:11 I indeed
[56:38] baptize you with water unto repentance
[56:41] but he that cometh after me is mightier
[56:43] than I whose shoes I'm not worthy bear
[56:45] he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[56:47] and with fire now that's a good fire we
[56:48] like that we want that 3:12 said who's
[56:52] fan in his hand and he will thoroughly
[56:55] Purge his floor and and gather his wheat
[56:57] into the Garner but he will burn the cha
[57:00] burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire
[57:03] that's the bad fire we don't want that
[57:06] and then of course you got the fiery
[57:07] Pains of marom for the foolish virgins
[57:10] in the in the tribulation period there's
[57:12] got to be the 144,000 they have to uh
[57:15] all they're sealed in they receive the
[57:17] same gospel we sealed in but they also
[57:19] have to die by the fiery Pains of marom
[57:22] they're killed the foolish virgins are
[57:24] killed the Earth is purged partially
[57:26] purged during the tribulation period but
[57:27] then of course it'll be totally purged
[57:29] at the end of the Millennium but it all
[57:31] takes a purging by fire so we just have
[57:34] to understand so you can see the basis
[57:36] and the foundation of where I'm going
[57:38] why he said I'm going to baptize you
[57:39] with the Holy Ghost with fire amen the
[57:42] Holy Ghost Fire not the unquenchable
[57:44] fire and so the the choice is easy but
[57:47] you know God's already made that choice
[57:48] we don't have that
[57:49] choice God chose His Bride I didn't
[57:52] choose him he chose me you didn't choose
[57:55] him he chose you we are so thankful he
[57:57] chose us to be that bride what do we
[58:00] have to give him
[58:02] nothing but since he called me I want to
[58:05] surrender I want to be what he wants me
[58:07] to be why is this fire necessary brother
[58:09] Bram said in the future home fire is the
[58:11] only thing that can cleanse he said you
[58:13] can spray it you can you can put
[58:15] chemicals on it you can do anything you
[58:16] want to but he said that will not toally
[58:19] thoroughly Purge but said you burn it
[58:21] one time he said that will purify fire
[58:24] is the only purifier so God uses these
[58:26] types to show that only fire can really
[58:29] burn cleanse purify and only the Holy
[58:32] Ghost Fire can burn out sin burn out the
[58:35] desire for sin change of nature the only
[58:37] agent that can purify now we all know
[58:40] you must have the Holy Ghost to be bride
[58:43] to go into rapture we know that thank
[58:45] God for that word birth on your soul not
[58:48] on your spirit realm but you must have
[58:50] the token what is the token what what is
[58:53] the token we all know the literal Life
[58:55] of Christ Christ now Jesus was filled
[58:58] with the Holy Ghost Mary had to be
[59:00] filled with the Holy Ghost 120 were
[59:02] filled with the Holy Ghost all bride
[59:04] must be filled with the Holy Ghost now
[59:07] you got to watch Satan Satan's a Slicker
[59:09] is he
[59:10] not he'll tell you now you know
[59:13] especially for young people people
[59:14] coming up people raising message he'll
[59:16] tell you when you don't have the ghost
[59:19] oh have the ghost but he when you don't
[59:21] have the ghost when you don't have the
[59:22] Holy Ghost he'll tell you you do and
[59:25] when you do have the Hol ghost he'll
[59:26] tell you you don't so I mean he's going
[59:28] to tell you the opposite whichever it is
[59:30] but to why why would he do that is that
[59:33] is to make your faith the waiver because
[59:35] the whole Revelation is by faith faith
[59:38] is a revelation you're saved by
[59:41] Revelation you're born again by
[59:43] Revelation yeah we're saved by grace
[59:45] through faith but it's all by Revelation
[59:48] the whole church is built upon
[59:49] Revelation but so don't listen to Satan
[59:52] whatever is the truth he's going to tell
[59:53] you the opposite now Satan torments with
[59:57] fear and I I thought this was kind of
[1:00:00] interesting and maybe a little bit humor
[1:00:02] but it's certainly is true Fe a r you
[1:00:04] know really fear stands for false
[1:00:08] evidence appearing
[1:00:11] real FEA are false evidence and that's
[1:00:14] just the truth it's false evidence that
[1:00:17] appears real kind of like a paradox but
[1:00:19] it's false evidence and not just that's
[1:00:21] how Satan works and people have a you
[1:00:24] know sometimes a hard time or trouble
[1:00:27] understanding the difference between
[1:00:28] emotion and and sensation and Revelation
[1:00:31] which faith is a revelation brother man
[1:00:33] said what is the Holy Ghost given for he
[1:00:36] said you're now I'm going to say
[1:00:37] something right while I'm thinking about
[1:00:38] it brother B preached that series what
[1:00:41] is the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost
[1:00:43] given
[1:00:44] for and then the third service he said
[1:00:47] how do you know when you get the Holy
[1:00:49] Ghost but do you realize the what is the
[1:00:52] Holy Ghost what was the Holy Ghost given
[1:00:54] for and the third sermon either was
[1:00:57] never recorded or was never released we
[1:01:00] don't have that what why how do you know
[1:01:02] when you get because he said I'm going
[1:01:03] to preach these three sermons and the
[1:01:05] last one's going to be how do you know
[1:01:06] when you get the Holy Ghost but it never
[1:01:08] was released or it was never recorded I
[1:01:10] don't know but I've often wonder why and
[1:01:12] I think I know why why would he not
[1:01:14] release that because if he said okay
[1:01:16] this is how you know you got the Holy
[1:01:18] Ghost 1 2 3 4 5 67 so if he just put
[1:01:22] that 1 through 7 so everybody had to go
[1:01:24] 1 through 7 to get the Holy Ghost with a
[1:01:26] big Coal Shed or this or that or this or
[1:01:28] that or so it's it's not any set place
[1:01:32] not any set form fashion I mean you
[1:01:35] could get it in church you could get it
[1:01:37] at home you can get it in the corn field
[1:01:39] so it's it's it's just a matter of what
[1:01:42] it is and what it's given for then it's
[1:01:45] an individual work just like the little
[1:01:46] room when they go through the little
[1:01:47] room they come through the little room
[1:01:49] there in the tent Vision they come out
[1:01:51] uh what happened in there I don't know I
[1:01:53] all I know is I was healed I was changed
[1:01:55] I was changed on the inside what explain
[1:01:57] to me what happened in there I don't
[1:01:58] know what happened there all I know is
[1:02:00] I'm
[1:02:01] changed so that's why I never did
[1:02:04] release that taper never did uh actually
[1:02:07] record it whatever brother man said you
[1:02:09] are not converted until you receive the
[1:02:12] Holy
[1:02:15] Ghost now is that scripture we know that
[1:02:18] Peter James John all of them said they
[1:02:20] were believed on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:21] they were Sanctified John 17:17 sanctify
[1:02:24] them by the truth Thy word is truth
[1:02:26] Jesus told Peter said after you're
[1:02:28] converted then go strengthen the
[1:02:30] Brethren so know we know we're believing
[1:02:32] unto but you're not converted until you
[1:02:34] receive the Holy Ghost that's right you
[1:02:36] are believing unto the Holy Spirit has
[1:02:38] spoke to you and you publicly convinced
[1:02:40] him the devil has the same thing I
[1:02:43] believe him to be the Son of God so does
[1:02:45] the devil but you're walking on towards
[1:02:47] him when Peter had been called and
[1:02:50] justified by Believing on the Lord Jesus
[1:02:53] Christ and in John 17:70 Jesus sanctify
[1:02:55] him them through the word for the word
[1:02:58] was truth and he was the word but you're
[1:03:00] not converted until you receive the Holy
[1:03:03] Ghost he says also what was the Holy
[1:03:05] Ghost given for a brother said to me the
[1:03:07] other day brother random some time ago
[1:03:09] months ago he said brother random
[1:03:10] Abraham believed God it was imputed to
[1:03:12] him for righteous I said truly said what
[1:03:15] more can a man do but believe I said
[1:03:18] that's all a man can do that's all he
[1:03:20] can do is believe God
[1:03:24] but but God God gave him a seal of
[1:03:28] circumcision that we went through last
[1:03:30] night he said as a sign that he had
[1:03:34] accepted his faith in him that's so
[1:03:39] important gave him a seal of
[1:03:40] circumcision as a sign that he had
[1:03:43] accepted his faith in him again it's all
[1:03:47] about faith you got to believe it and
[1:03:50] today until God said you believe unto
[1:03:53] him when you accept him as your personal
[1:03:55] savior but when God gives you the Seal
[1:03:57] of the Holy Ghost he sealed you to your
[1:04:00] Eternal destination that's when God has
[1:04:03] accepted you brother man says infuture
[1:04:05] home says you don't accept God God
[1:04:06] accepts you because you are his
[1:04:09] attribute so God accepts you when God
[1:04:11] accepts your faith and your Revelation
[1:04:14] then he sends down that seal and seals
[1:04:15] you with the Holy Ghost until then yeah
[1:04:17] you're believing unto you're going unto
[1:04:19] you're you're marching towards Zion but
[1:04:21] until he's received that faith that
[1:04:23] faith that Revelation and he knows that
[1:04:25] what what point he knows at what point
[1:04:27] that you're willing to totally surrender
[1:04:30] that's why brother B said in the he said
[1:04:32] well many times he said why you know
[1:04:34] when you we look at acts 238 repent and
[1:04:37] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:04:39] for the remission of sins and you shall
[1:04:41] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost what
[1:04:42] is the gift of the Holy Ghost it's not a
[1:04:44] temporary gift it's eternal life you
[1:04:46] shall receive that but he says why God's
[1:04:48] obligated to give you that when you
[1:04:50] repent and baptize okay but why he said
[1:04:54] most people don't receive it right then
[1:04:56] when they repent and baptized why
[1:04:58] because they for for whatever reason
[1:05:01] lots and lots of different reasons they
[1:05:03] have it fully fully fully repented right
[1:05:06] made up their mind to serve God so it
[1:05:08] takes that time why it don't have to be
[1:05:10] that way but it takes that time for
[1:05:12] people say you know what I believe I I
[1:05:14] believe I'm going to have to die I'm
[1:05:16] going to have to die first but he goes
[1:05:18] on to say you he uh sign that he has
[1:05:22] accepted his faith and today and tell
[1:05:24] God you believe un him and accept him as
[1:05:26] your personal savior but when God gives
[1:05:28] you the Seal of the Holy Ghost he sealed
[1:05:30] you to your Eternal destination now you
[1:05:33] Baptist take that and I'll go with you
[1:05:35] on eternal security yes sir because
[1:05:37] grieve not the holy spirit of God
[1:05:38] whereby you are sealed until the day of
[1:05:41] your Redemption you're not sealed by
[1:05:43] believing
[1:05:45] unto but sealed by the Holy Ghost
[1:05:47] Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the holy
[1:05:49] spirit of God whereby you are sealed
[1:05:51] unto the day of your Redemption that
[1:05:52] seals you when you've and now I like
[1:05:56] what he says here that seals you when
[1:05:58] you found favor with God oh my what is
[1:06:03] that remind you of what does the Bible
[1:06:05] say about there was a there was a a lady
[1:06:08] that fulfilled uh 712 years later a
[1:06:10] virgin shell conceived the Bible say
[1:06:12] Mary you found favor with
[1:06:14] God Amen whereby he said on your
[1:06:17] Redemption when you found favor with God
[1:06:20] Mary was highly favored this bride is
[1:06:23] highly favored and he seals you by by
[1:06:25] the Holy Spirit that's so for the Bible
[1:06:28] said no man can call Jesus Christ only
[1:06:30] by the Holy Ghost favor favor favor
[1:06:35] favor you are highly favored why listen
[1:06:40] the greatest blessing I know of is to
[1:06:42] find favor with God that's true Luke
[1:06:46] 1:28 and the angel came and we know the
[1:06:48] scripture and the angel came to her and
[1:06:50] said hay Thou Art highly favored and the
[1:06:53] Lord is with thee blessed are they among
[1:06:55] women you know why you're blessed
[1:06:57] because you're highly
[1:06:59] favored and the angel said to her fear
[1:07:01] not Mary for thou Hast found favor with
[1:07:04] God you know anytime brother Ben said
[1:07:06] anytime uh an angel well of course never
[1:07:10] been face to face with the angel myself
[1:07:12] and most people don't but anytime a a
[1:07:15] human being comes into the presence of
[1:07:16] the Angel what's the first thing the
[1:07:18] angel says fear not fear not first thing
[1:07:22] the angel said when he came to brother
[1:07:23] bandam and the green mil fear not not
[1:07:26] you I am sent from the presence of
[1:07:27] almighty God always fear it's a fearful
[1:07:30] thing no
[1:07:32] doubt he said fear not thou H has found
[1:07:34] favor now if you if if we want to take
[1:07:37] these two scriptures and the angel came
[1:07:40] into her and said to her Thou Art highly
[1:07:41] favored I thought I'd just write it down
[1:07:43] and just kind of bring it up into the
[1:07:45] message so verse 28 would read like this
[1:07:47] if we just want to bring it up to date
[1:07:50] and the Sabbath Angel spoke to her the
[1:07:51] bride in the first seal and said hail
[1:07:54] I'm going to call you bride that you
[1:07:55] might understand blessed are they among
[1:07:58] churches so I just kind of add live that
[1:08:00] just a little bit but it's the truth but
[1:08:02] we are highly favored true and you are
[1:08:04] highly favored above all the
[1:08:06] churches yeah go go go look at the the
[1:08:09] preview of the Bride you know who who's
[1:08:11] the leader of the churches a witch and
[1:08:13] they're half dressed and this and that
[1:08:14] this and that dead are you not highly
[1:08:18] favored verse 30 it said and the angel
[1:08:20] said to her fear not Mary for thou Hast
[1:08:23] found favor with god let's just change
[1:08:25] it a little bit and the seventh angel
[1:08:26] said unto her fear not little bride for
[1:08:29] God has favored You by election before
[1:08:31] the foundation of the world I'm so glad
[1:08:33] he chose me I'm glad he chose you uh the
[1:08:37] bride has found favor with God you talk
[1:08:39] about highly favored women churches we
[1:08:42] are that why did God choose
[1:08:45] you uh none of my brothers I don't have
[1:08:48] any sisters none of my brothers are in
[1:08:50] the message Alison's got three sisters
[1:08:52] and a brother none of them the message
[1:08:54] your family most of them say why are
[1:08:56] that most of them are not in the message
[1:08:57] right why are you the the the the black
[1:09:00] sheep as it were why are you singled out
[1:09:03] you're highly
[1:09:04] favored that's right why did God let
[1:09:06] thousands die and perish the day that I
[1:09:09] got saved why did God extend to you the
[1:09:11] greatest of all invitations to be bride
[1:09:14] why well you know doesn't that shouldn't
[1:09:17] that spur a more of a Thanksgiving and
[1:09:19] appreciation for God why are you said
[1:09:22] why are you sitting in a message church
[1:09:23] and not in a denomination or even out on
[1:09:26] a bar stool somewhere
[1:09:28] why I tell you why because God put God
[1:09:31] put representation down in your soul why
[1:09:34] why is your business blessed you know
[1:09:35] not only do we have this just the
[1:09:37] spiritual blessing to be bride but I
[1:09:39] mean this bride is almost like a
[1:09:40] Prosperity message God has just so
[1:09:42] blessed his
[1:09:44] people oh and brother man said only the
[1:09:46] predestinated are considered in
[1:09:48] Redemption now in spoken words Original
[1:09:50] Seed brother M said the true bride like
[1:09:52] Mary will have a virgin womb for for the
[1:09:55] Bride of for the Bride of the word which
[1:09:59] is Christ when Christ the word comes to
[1:10:02] the bride she'll be the same as he is a
[1:10:05] Virgin by the word how can we when we
[1:10:09] were as brother B said we were back in
[1:10:11] those uh prostitute denominations you
[1:10:13] know influenced by them uh Believing on
[1:10:16] their Doctrine false Doctrine so forth
[1:10:19] you know Trinity three Gods baptized and
[1:10:21] titles and on and on and on and on and
[1:10:23] on things that we uh thought that we
[1:10:26] understood back there but God has
[1:10:27] cleansed
[1:10:29] us is a way that he had to do it by the
[1:10:32] washing of the Water by the word it's
[1:10:34] all by the word he said amen said she he
[1:10:39] is a Virgin by the word I hope it's it's
[1:10:42] going over to you brother Neville see I
[1:10:43] hope I hope you understand I love why
[1:10:46] brother man said I'm going to call you
[1:10:47] bride that you might understand the wise
[1:10:50] will understand Daniel said I hope you
[1:10:53] understand what was he the word the word
[1:10:56] of God upon his vesture he had a name
[1:10:58] written the word of God in the beginning
[1:11:00] was the word word with God Word was God
[1:11:02] and the Word was made flesh and the word
[1:11:04] is being made flesh
[1:11:06] today and dwelt Among Us he is God and
[1:11:09] God is the word and when his bride comes
[1:11:12] she'll be the same product that he is
[1:11:14] and what was he he was virgin to the
[1:11:17] word and you will are the same if you
[1:11:23] have been birst into the kingdom of God
[1:11:27] amen remember now because we are highly
[1:11:30] favored then we also must be high and
[1:11:34] behavior yes sir we're highly favored
[1:11:36] but there's a price to pay there's a
[1:11:39] price to pay there is a price to pay
[1:11:42] that price is total surrender to the
[1:11:44] word of God total surrender to the word
[1:11:47] of God I'll show you we'll talk about in
[1:11:49] a minute it's either heaven or hell we
[1:11:52] just you know it really just boils down
[1:11:54] to this it's either heaven or hell it's
[1:11:56] either serve God God's not going to take
[1:11:59] second place he's either number one or
[1:12:01] he's no place that's the way that's the
[1:12:03] way it has to be so there is a price to
[1:12:06] pay to be
[1:12:08] bride I'll take my way with the Lord's
[1:12:11] desp as few for me in my house we'll
[1:12:13] serve the Lord we sing that old song
[1:12:16] take this world but give me Jesus that's
[1:12:19] right total surrender to the word
[1:12:21] remember we're not converted till we
[1:12:22] receive the Holy Ghost and we are not
[1:12:24] sealed in until we receive the Holy
[1:12:26] Ghost the Bible says no man could even
[1:12:27] call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy
[1:12:31] Ghost and the Holy Ghost is Christ and
[1:12:33] Christ is that Pillar of Fire many
[1:12:36] manifestations of that logos what does a
[1:12:38] holy fire from God do for the believer
[1:12:41] what does it do let's find out what it
[1:12:43] does what will it do brother say the
[1:12:45] future home the Earth couldn't be a and
[1:12:48] the earth and the and and Humanity has
[1:12:51] to be redeemed cleansed the same way
[1:12:54] what will it do the Earth couldn't be a
[1:12:55] place for heaven to sit on now look at
[1:12:58] that the sin it has to be
[1:13:01] cleansed and he said and here it is
[1:13:04] here's a quote that I want to get to no
[1:13:06] man no person no woman boy girl I don't
[1:13:09] care who he is is fit to go into the
[1:13:12] pulpit or even claim to be a Christian
[1:13:15] without being filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:13:16] you have no right to the Lord's Supper
[1:13:18] any communion feet washing anything
[1:13:20] until you've been cleansed by the Holy
[1:13:22] Fire of God it's right there wow
[1:13:27] amen and there's a reason for it serious
[1:13:30] amen why did God Institute
[1:13:32] sanctification God can't dwell in
[1:13:34] unclean vessel that's right it's just
[1:13:36] like you know we've we've used that
[1:13:37] illustration many you find a dirty glass
[1:13:39] out you know you want to fill it with
[1:13:40] water you first thing you got first
[1:13:42] thing you got you got to take it up out
[1:13:43] of the mud that's that's justification
[1:13:46] second second thing is you got to wash
[1:13:48] it and cleanse it and set it aside for
[1:13:50] service third thing is you got to fill
[1:13:52] that glass with water so there three
[1:13:54] it's always three steps of redemption
[1:13:56] that's what the whole uh message of
[1:13:58] future home is whether it be the bride
[1:14:00] the 144,000 the foolish virgins the
[1:14:03] cleansing of the earth it's all got to
[1:14:05] be the same he said I've always believed
[1:14:08] in those three stages of Grace
[1:14:12] amen unless you've been cleansed by the
[1:14:14] Holy Fire of God no mother man said no
[1:14:16] man has a right to preach unless like
[1:14:18] Moses meets him him out there on the
[1:14:23] sacred grounds that now him that Pillar
[1:14:26] of Fire hanging there where he knows
[1:14:28] where he's at so we so we all know we
[1:14:32] know that Christ is that word Christ is
[1:14:34] that logos Christ is that Pillar of Fire
[1:14:37] Christ is that light that struck Paul
[1:14:39] down on the road Damascus and he met
[1:14:41] them called him Lord Brother said he
[1:14:42] wouldn't have called that Jew wouldn't
[1:14:44] have called anything Lord actually he
[1:14:45] know that he was Elohim in that great
[1:14:48] light now as I said we titled the sermon
[1:14:51] meeting that Pillar of Fire now brother
[1:14:54] B said in future home we must meet him
[1:14:57] so who really is
[1:14:59] him him him is Christ and Christ is the
[1:15:03] word and just not any word it's not just
[1:15:06] any word not just Luther's word what
[1:15:08] what is we got to meet him which is the
[1:15:11] word what kind of word present day truth
[1:15:14] that's why this message is so critical
[1:15:16] so crucial it's got to be present day
[1:15:19] truth nothing else like the song nothing
[1:15:22] else will satisfy well Jesus in
[1:15:24] historical form no that's good for them
[1:15:28] Jesus in Luther's day that's good for
[1:15:30] them but it won't work today that's
[1:15:32] right that's why even brother man said
[1:15:33] an invisible Union said the word that
[1:15:34] fell on the day of Pentecost won't work
[1:15:36] today it was he said Pentecost
[1:15:37] represented that but we have a new word
[1:15:39] it's all new new day new
[1:15:43] dispensation amen present day truth word
[1:15:46] will produce a word birth so what's the
[1:15:49] requirement for a word birth or the
[1:15:52] token what is the requirements brother
[1:15:54] says in the bo and the boken the token
[1:15:57] the the token in Bakersville and when we
[1:16:00] can display the token of the Holy Spirit
[1:16:03] shows that we have been accepted in
[1:16:05] Christ and that our token that all and
[1:16:09] is our token that all we have need of is
[1:16:11] already purchased by him amen we
[1:16:15] identified why did brother man say all
[1:16:17] everything you have need of in for your
[1:16:19] Earthly journey is where in that seed
[1:16:23] even the rapture
[1:16:26] it's in that seed everything you have
[1:16:28] need of is in that
[1:16:30] seed amen we are identified with our
[1:16:33] token the token must be ready the blood
[1:16:36] the Covenant Covenant blood is not rec
[1:16:38] he said the blood the Covenant blood is
[1:16:40] not recognized without the token the
[1:16:44] word assures us of the promise the token
[1:16:46] is a sign the purchase has been made for
[1:16:49] us and then he makes this great
[1:16:52] statement full obedience sir to the word
[1:16:55] of God entitles you to the
[1:17:00] Token so as we said how do we honor God
[1:17:03] how do we believe God how do we worship
[1:17:05] God it's all by full why did he choose
[1:17:07] us because he know he put something in
[1:17:09] us that we could give full obedience to
[1:17:12] him if he chose his bride before to the
[1:17:15] foundation of world he's not as we've
[1:17:17] we've heard it said so many times God's
[1:17:18] just not say well I hope they receive it
[1:17:20] I hope somebody's going to believe what
[1:17:22] I say no he made a way you could receive
[1:17:24] it cuz he put that representation in you
[1:17:27] and that representation will come to the
[1:17:28] word I don't know how old you'll be but
[1:17:30] it will come to the word it can't do
[1:17:33] anything else because it's part of God
[1:17:35] his representation when that light
[1:17:37] strikes that light it will come to
[1:17:40] birth full obedience to the full word of
[1:17:42] God entitles us to the Token no other
[1:17:45] way is there that could ever be entitled
[1:17:47] to the Token only you fully obey the
[1:17:51] word what does the book of Acts say
[1:17:53] about that God G gives the Holy Ghost to
[1:17:55] them that
[1:17:58] obey God gives the Holy Ghost to them
[1:18:00] that obey it's all got to be OB is that
[1:18:03] mean your flesh is going to be perfect
[1:18:05] not at all no way you w't going to
[1:18:08] measure up your flesh is rotten is
[1:18:10] stinking just like mine everybody else
[1:18:11] is sticky Until the End we're talking
[1:18:14] about the soul amen and the Soul brings
[1:18:16] the spirit under subjection the spirit
[1:18:18] brings the flesh under subjection and
[1:18:20] we're like Israel we're separated people
[1:18:23] true how simple is it to obey well the
[1:18:27] greatest honor you can bestow upon God
[1:18:29] is to Simply take him at his
[1:18:32] word obey his word all things are
[1:18:35] possible if you can believe Bible said
[1:18:37] God as I just said God gives the Holy
[1:18:38] Ghost to them that obey and Obey what
[1:18:42] Luther's word Wesley's word present day
[1:18:45] truth word it's got to be present day
[1:18:48] truth brother Ram told us that the
[1:18:50] evidence of the Holy Ghost is to believe
[1:18:51] and receive the word for the hour what
[1:18:54] is the evidence is oh you know the
[1:18:56] Pentecost was cabbaged down on speaking
[1:18:57] in tongue so you know we've had went
[1:18:59] through that so many times we know
[1:19:00] that's that's not true at all but they
[1:19:02] still believe that the Pentecostal
[1:19:03] believe that they believe why you come
[1:19:05] to the I mean I don't want to get off on
[1:19:07] this I was raised in the Church of
[1:19:09] Christ I mean you know that's million
[1:19:11] miles from Pentecostal I met my wife
[1:19:13] she's Pentecostal home and so you know I
[1:19:15] wanted the Holy Ghost before we come to
[1:19:17] the message you know so you get to the
[1:19:19] Holy Ghost you come to the Altar and
[1:19:20] they pray you pray and they beat on you
[1:19:21] and they wiggle your mouth and they uh
[1:19:24] bu vibrate your chin and do and you know
[1:19:26] say say it now say it say it say it say
[1:19:27] it you almost got it you almost got it
[1:19:29] say it oh we've been that way I don't
[1:19:32] read that I you know I I didn't know
[1:19:34] much about the Bible but I never read
[1:19:35] that in the book of Acts that's right it
[1:19:37] just didn't work that way they was in in
[1:19:40] the upper room in one mind and one
[1:19:41] Accord and they waited and carried there
[1:19:43] being in one Accord until the Holy Ghost
[1:19:45] Came Upon them then they were filled
[1:19:46] with the Holy Ghost nobody had to shake
[1:19:48] their jaw and make them speak in tongue
[1:19:50] the utterance came by God all together
[1:19:53] amen
[1:19:56] yeah I can remember that you know many
[1:19:58] many years ago and even even even raised
[1:20:00] in the Church of Christ I I knew better
[1:20:02] that and I said would youall leave me
[1:20:04] alone would y'all just leave me alone
[1:20:05] there's got to be that's not the way you
[1:20:07] do it I didn't know how you did it but
[1:20:08] that wasn't the way
[1:20:10] right age oh praise the Lord Amen
[1:20:14] brother R told us that the evidence of
[1:20:15] the Holy Ghost is to believe and receive
[1:20:17] the word for the hour and that your life
[1:20:20] Bears record of that word can I read
[1:20:22] that again
[1:20:25] the evidence of the Holy Ghost is to
[1:20:27] believe and receive the word that's
[1:20:28] present day truth and that your life
[1:20:31] Bears record of that
[1:20:33] word so it's not by you know we'll get
[1:20:37] to that in just a minute he told us to
[1:20:38] get away from all these Sensations and
[1:20:40] stuff as evidences and and of course
[1:20:42] that's one of the big questions today
[1:20:44] you know how will I know and brother B
[1:20:46] said Serv was the time he said one of
[1:20:48] the mysteries of this age was uh to be
[1:20:50] cleared up was uh the mystery of the
[1:20:53] baptism Holy Ghost without sin ation but
[1:20:55] the person of Christ performing the same
[1:20:57] Works in you that he did so it's not
[1:21:00] sensation we know that Satan can
[1:21:03] impersonate any of the gift sensation
[1:21:04] whatever but in the Masterpiece and
[1:21:06] we've heard this so many times but it's
[1:21:07] so important we'll get to this in just a
[1:21:09] second justification made way for
[1:21:11] sanctification you probably can quote
[1:21:13] the rest of it sanctification made way
[1:21:16] for baptism of the Holy Ghost baptism of
[1:21:19] the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy
[1:21:22] Ghost himself amen holy what was what
[1:21:25] what are we talking about we're talking
[1:21:26] about Revelation 10:1 Christ The
[1:21:28] Covenant angel coming down one foot on
[1:21:29] the land one foot on the sea coming down
[1:21:31] the fullness of the word the opening of
[1:21:32] the seals the person of Christ the Zoey
[1:21:35] of God Amen that's meeting the pillar of
[1:21:38] fire present day truth receiving the
[1:21:40] Life of Christ the literal Life of
[1:21:42] Christ receiving the token Christ on
[1:21:45] life now you know the difference I just
[1:21:48] thought I'd bring this in we talk about
[1:21:50] grace and mercy and
[1:21:52] Justice what is Grace
[1:21:55] Grace that's getting what you don't
[1:21:57] deserve that's
[1:21:59] Grace and what's Justice that's getting
[1:22:02] what you do
[1:22:04] deserve and what's Mercy Mercy is not
[1:22:07] getting what you do
[1:22:09] deserve I don't want Justice I want is
[1:22:13] Grace that's why this little bride is
[1:22:16] crying Grace Grace double Grace we
[1:22:20] didn't get what we reserve what we
[1:22:22] deserved but he give us Grace
[1:22:25] okay now we've talked some about these
[1:22:27] mechanics of meeting that Pillar of Fire
[1:22:29] and the Holy Ghost and New Birth so you
[1:22:31] say well brother Tera let's just make it
[1:22:33] real simple okay well just make it real
[1:22:35] simple let's talk about a few things
[1:22:37] here uh you say well I was raised in the
[1:22:39] message I never was in denomination
[1:22:41] Barnard I never went out in the world so
[1:22:44] how' I know okay let's make it real
[1:22:45] simple well you know remember what
[1:22:47] Albert Einstein said one time he said
[1:22:49] you know if you don't make it simple it
[1:22:50] show shows you don't understand it ful
[1:22:52] of yourself so let's try to make it
[1:22:54] simple
[1:22:55] that great mind said if you don't make
[1:22:56] it simple it shows you don't understand
[1:22:58] it
[1:22:59] yourself so let's try to make it simple
[1:23:02] I mean how could you take eals MC squar
[1:23:05] energy equals uh masstimes the speed of
[1:23:08] light squared how can you make that
[1:23:09] simple but he said you got to make it
[1:23:13] simple now let's look at some few things
[1:23:15] here try to make this meeting that
[1:23:17] Pillar of Fire real
[1:23:20] simple first of all we understand that
[1:23:22] church was inaugurated at Pentecost we
[1:23:24] know what happened there up a room all
[1:23:26] filled with the Holy Ghost 120 it wasn't
[1:23:29] anymore it was just God God above them
[1:23:31] it was God in them we understand that
[1:23:34] Peter preached that great sermon that
[1:23:35] day then their hearts were pricked
[1:23:38] because of great Peter's great sermon
[1:23:40] and he said what can we do sir what can
[1:23:42] we do in other words what can we do to
[1:23:44] be saved we want this what you've got
[1:23:46] what can we do to be saved he said
[1:23:47] repent be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:23:49] Christ every one of you for the miss you
[1:23:51] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:53] now we all know that that the emphasis
[1:23:55] is on
[1:23:57] repent anybody can be baptized in water
[1:24:00] anybody actually can repent say God I'm
[1:24:02] sorry you know I want to I want to go to
[1:24:05] heaven and so repent be bad but see
[1:24:07] repent and there's really more messages
[1:24:10] need to be uh preached on repentance
[1:24:12] because repentance is not just Lord I'm
[1:24:14] sorry just you know okay what's next
[1:24:17] repentance is death repent repentance is
[1:24:21] change of Direction it's a change of
[1:24:24] Focus it's a it's a complete change you
[1:24:27] were going this way now you want to go
[1:24:29] that way it's it's an about face it's a
[1:24:31] turnaround it's not just Lord I'm sorry
[1:24:33] for what I did that's all part of it but
[1:24:35] you're you're saying I'm finished with
[1:24:37] that even though you're a babe you're
[1:24:40] you're you're you're just believing unto
[1:24:42] basically in the beginning but you you
[1:24:45] you you you you're you got to make a
[1:24:47] decision I'm finished with this world
[1:24:49] I'm finished with sin I want to turn
[1:24:50] around there's got to be a it's got to
[1:24:52] be a genuine repentance I mean a a
[1:24:55] heartfelt
[1:24:57] desperation repentance it's got to be
[1:24:59] that so that's why most that's why most
[1:25:01] people don't receive the Holy Ghost when
[1:25:03] they're baptized because they haven't
[1:25:05] fully even understood and recognized the
[1:25:08] the the depth and the magnitude of what
[1:25:09] real repentance is it means a total
[1:25:12] turning around separation from unbelief
[1:25:15] as much as you know even at the
[1:25:16] beginning amen so that's that's that's
[1:25:19] the first thing that we got to
[1:25:20] understand repentance has got to be a a
[1:25:22] a total total reversal that's true okay
[1:25:26] that's that's just making it
[1:25:27] simple
[1:25:29] now the Bible says for grace are you
[1:25:32] saved through faith and that not of
[1:25:35] yourselves it is the gift of God let's
[1:25:38] make that real simple so what is Grace
[1:25:41] Grace is getting what you don't deserve
[1:25:43] it's unmar favor creates a bond it
[1:25:46] creates a connection and the love for
[1:25:49] The Giver that has given this favor what
[1:25:51] what is Grace it's actually unmar favor
[1:25:53] God gave you something you didn't
[1:25:54] deserve God gave me something I didn't
[1:25:56] deserve so by Grace that's how we say by
[1:25:59] Grace okay that's real simple are you
[1:26:02] saved through faith as I said before
[1:26:04] it's all got to be a faith walk brother
[1:26:08] remember had to believe he was saved and
[1:26:09] to fill with the Holy Ghost by
[1:26:12] faith you have to believe that you were
[1:26:14] saved and filled with the Holy Ghost by
[1:26:16] faith nobody gets a certified letter it
[1:26:18] all is by faith the whole church is
[1:26:21] built on faith it's all faith is a
[1:26:23] revelation it's all by faith you say
[1:26:25] well you know I would I want some kind
[1:26:27] of proof well that's what the Pentecost
[1:26:28] want was speaking in tongue you got it
[1:26:30] you got you're sealed in don't worry
[1:26:31] about it you're good to go
[1:26:33] no lots of people could speak in Tong
[1:26:36] didn't have it but it's through faith
[1:26:37] you've got to believe and you've got to
[1:26:39] have that Revelation so for grace are
[1:26:42] you saved through faith and that and I
[1:26:45] just I love the last part and that of
[1:26:47] not of
[1:26:48] yourselves the faith not of yourselves
[1:26:51] Paul said one time the life that I now
[1:26:53] live in Jesus Christ I live by the faith
[1:26:57] of the Son of God it wasn't even Paul's
[1:27:00] faith God chose Paul God told him uh
[1:27:04] ananas I think it was said that he's
[1:27:06] been chosen vessel to suffer many things
[1:27:07] from him and you know go up in three
[1:27:09] days and pray for him that he might
[1:27:11] receive his sight and so forth God chose
[1:27:13] Paul God chose
[1:27:17] you and whatever and it's like it's like
[1:27:20] the little seed package the little seed
[1:27:22] package with uh I preach on one time you
[1:27:25] get a little seed package of Maragos or
[1:27:27] whatever and the seeds in that package
[1:27:28] if you look on the back side of the
[1:27:30] package it's going to tell you all the
[1:27:32] characteristics of that of that plant
[1:27:34] that marago it's going to grow so many
[1:27:36] in just High it needs full sun it's
[1:27:38] going to be uh cheery it's I mean this
[1:27:40] sh everything that's it's all on the
[1:27:42] back what that seed is going to produce
[1:27:43] that's what it is and God has chose you
[1:27:46] to be the bride and you're going to
[1:27:47] produce that you're going to be
[1:27:49] cheery you're going to be you're going
[1:27:51] to need full Sunshine Too amen I mean
[1:27:54] this is a dark gloomy day but you got to
[1:27:56] have that full sun and Rise and Shine
[1:27:58] for the light is come and the glory of
[1:28:01] the Lord is risen upon thee amen it's
[1:28:04] not of yourself it's not even your faith
[1:28:06] did where did Abraham get the faith he's
[1:28:09] he's called the father of the faith
[1:28:11] where did Abraham give that faith God
[1:28:13] gave him the faith God gave him the
[1:28:15] faith to be able to sojourn in a Strange
[1:28:17] Land separate from his father and so
[1:28:19] forth like that and then God turns
[1:28:20] around and get and gives Abraham credit
[1:28:22] for having faith and God gave him the
[1:28:24] faith now brother that's Grace amen he
[1:28:28] didn't have the faith he was just
[1:28:29] ordinary idolator like anybody else but
[1:28:32] God chose him and give him the
[1:28:34] commission and come out and gave him the
[1:28:36] faith to do it and then give him credit
[1:28:37] for having that Faith that's my God we
[1:28:40] love him don't praise God it's not of
[1:28:42] yourself it is the gift of God so we
[1:28:44] even know that salvation is a free gift
[1:28:48] all your good works and all we know that
[1:28:50] all good and perfect gifts come from
[1:28:52] above so we know it comes from God Amen
[1:28:55] nobody in their right mind would turn
[1:28:57] down a perfect gift from God well that's
[1:28:59] the reason they're not in their right
[1:29:00] mind because they turned it down to
[1:29:03] truth God see God Is So persuasive
[1:29:06] because he's called you and chose you to
[1:29:07] be his bride he's so persuasive he made
[1:29:09] you an offer you can't
[1:29:12] refuse he may he gave you an offer you
[1:29:14] can't refuse well you can you can you
[1:29:17] can run for a while but I mean it's like
[1:29:19] a man running without a message God you
[1:29:21] can run for a while but God made you an
[1:29:23] offer you can't refuse use and somewhere
[1:29:25] he going to track you down like the
[1:29:28] blood hounds on the trail God's going to
[1:29:29] find your place brother sister amen but
[1:29:33] it takes faith it all together takes
[1:29:35] Faith B by grace are you saved through
[1:29:37] faith that not of yourself it's a gift
[1:29:39] of God it there again it takes Faith
[1:29:41] water baptism in the name of Jesus
[1:29:43] Christ it takes Faith receiving the Holy
[1:29:45] Ghost it takes faith believing that
[1:29:47] you're one of them it takes
[1:29:51] Faith let's look at another one how do I
[1:29:54] really know that I'm that God really
[1:29:56] loves
[1:29:57] me I can see he loves bam I can see he
[1:30:01] loves others how do I know he loves me I
[1:30:04] mean
[1:30:06] me yes sir remember remember the little
[1:30:10] armor outfit when the when the the armor
[1:30:14] outfit the great uh Cowboy you know was
[1:30:16] going out west to find a bride and
[1:30:18] everything and he went outside and he
[1:30:20] you know he asked a little um she was
[1:30:22] throwing out the dishwash this
[1:30:23] dishwasher dishw
[1:30:25] waterer and he said I found character in
[1:30:28] you that none of the others inside had
[1:30:31] and said will you be my wife and she
[1:30:33] said
[1:30:35] me me you want me I mean that's the
[1:30:38] great boss all Chicago armor outfit you
[1:30:40] want me to be your wife say yeah I do so
[1:30:43] I'll be back in a year from now well God
[1:30:45] chose us why me he loves me why let's
[1:30:50] look at this you see Church age
[1:30:52] book I tell you how you know God loves
[1:30:55] you you see they could not figure out
[1:30:59] God's love saman church age they thought
[1:31:02] that love meant no suffering they
[1:31:04] thought that love meant a baby with
[1:31:07] parental care but God said that his love
[1:31:11] was elective
[1:31:14] love elective love the proof of his love
[1:31:19] is
[1:31:21] election the proof of God's love to you
[1:31:24] you is election the proof of God's love
[1:31:27] to you is election that he called you to
[1:31:29] this message that's proof God loves you
[1:31:34] you don't if if you doubt that you don't
[1:31:36] believe the Bible if you doubt that you
[1:31:38] don't believe God's word if you believe
[1:31:39] if you doubt that you don't believe the
[1:31:41] message the proof of God's love is he
[1:31:43] called you by election to this message
[1:31:46] so that that's that's real simple that's
[1:31:48] real simple if you don't believe that
[1:31:51] you need prayer
[1:31:53] he loves you he called you amen by his
[1:31:57] love is proven truly by the fact that
[1:32:00] you were chosen un salvation and that
[1:32:02] takes Faith sure see it all takes faith
[1:32:06] everything we've talked about it takes
[1:32:07] Faith you must believe that you are that
[1:32:10] chosen amen amen you can't get a word
[1:32:13] birth out of denomination you can't get
[1:32:15] a word Birth by believing just God sent
[1:32:17] a prophet you can't go into Rapture
[1:32:19] without a word birth listen God winked
[1:32:21] at man's ignorance down through the
[1:32:22] church ages but the day since the full
[1:32:24] word's been born and restored and Christ
[1:32:27] is here in an open book lay claims on
[1:32:29] all these names that's in the book now
[1:32:31] he requires the token amen now he
[1:32:35] requires the token not just the baptism
[1:32:37] of the Holy Ghost on your spirit realm
[1:32:39] but the literal Life of Christ dwelling
[1:32:42] in your heart your heart your soul not
[1:32:46] your spirit Ram your soul the real you
[1:32:49] where that Gene of God is in the soul
[1:32:51] not on the spirit in your soul remember
[1:32:54] don't forget this in the Masterpiece I
[1:32:55] read it again but I'm going to say it
[1:32:57] again justification made way for
[1:32:58] sanctification sanctification made way
[1:33:00] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't
[1:33:03] stop there with Pentecost and a baptism
[1:33:05] the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy
[1:33:06] Ghost
[1:33:08] himself that's the only way we can
[1:33:10] understand this quote listen brother R
[1:33:12] said in leadership last message of the
[1:33:15] one of the last message you ever
[1:33:16] preached 1965 you're the choice of your
[1:33:20] conduct you could you don't mix it now
[1:33:22] you either for God against God and the
[1:33:25] outward expression shows exactly what's
[1:33:28] on the
[1:33:29] inside see the caber many of you think
[1:33:32] now listen this is a strong statement
[1:33:35] brother man said many of you think well
[1:33:37] I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm
[1:33:38] going to heaven that don't mean one
[1:33:40] thing that you're going to heaven no sir
[1:33:42] you can have the baptism of the Holy
[1:33:43] Ghost every hour of your life and still
[1:33:45] be lost and go to hell the Bible says so
[1:33:47] that's leadership 1965 what is he trying
[1:33:50] to tell us he said that listen the the
[1:33:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost as as we know
[1:33:55] down down through and it takes Faith to
[1:33:57] believe that it takes Faith to believe
[1:34:00] that
[1:34:02] listen and this this almost gets into
[1:34:05] another sermon and it gets really deep
[1:34:07] but I'm trying to make it just really
[1:34:09] simple uh why then did the baptism of
[1:34:13] the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy
[1:34:14] Ghost himself well first of all because
[1:34:16] it was only partial word that was given
[1:34:18] down to the through the church ages
[1:34:19] Luther had a dip into the Holy Ghost
[1:34:21] Wesley had a dip into the Holy Ghost
[1:34:23] Pentecostal had to dip into the Holy
[1:34:24] Ghost but now we have the full word is
[1:34:27] restored amen the the the perfect
[1:34:30] interpretation of the revealed word with
[1:34:32] Divine Vindication but we know that the
[1:34:34] that the baptism Holy Ghost it did
[1:34:36] several things and it it actually block
[1:34:39] it blocked the influence of Hell having
[1:34:41] the baptism of Holy Ghost but we have

[1:35:01] so many wonderful things about this
[1:35:02] message that we just uh we begin to
[1:35:05] understand it more and more he is here
[1:35:06] and we are becoming him am mean it was
[1:35:09] given the baptism the Holy Ghost was
[1:35:10] given to be victorious over the enemy be
[1:35:12] an overcomer but we have the anointing
[1:35:15] which is the token which is the literal
[1:35:17] life of Jesus Christ amen and we know
[1:35:19] that but when the Holy Ghost himself
[1:35:21] comes then you get a word g word word
[1:35:23] birth we know that the seventh seal
[1:35:25] brings him back to Earth and he we know
[1:35:27] that the seventh seal has been open it's

[1:35:54] because you're under the anointing of
[1:35:56] the of the Rapture translation of the
[1:35:57] bride all I mean this is this is uh
[1:36:00] Promises to the elect not not to just
[1:36:03] those denominational Believers you know
[1:36:05] back back in Pentecost so forth this is
[1:36:07] for the bride the elect amen walking
[1:36:10] like Enoch is ready to take a Rapture
[1:36:11] says when when we eat the book we are
[1:36:13] called by the third pull like Mary the
[1:36:16] bride says be it un me according to Thy
[1:36:18] word so you actually become the very
[1:36:20] existence of Christ amen Amen brother
[1:36:24] man says the rising of the sun you have
[1:36:25] been resurrected amen you've been
[1:36:28] resurrected now let's look at what one
[1:36:30] couple more things and then we'll try to
[1:36:32] find a closing place I'm not going two
[1:36:34] hours now so don't worry so next what's
[1:36:37] the result of the token we possess it's
[1:36:39] a complete nature change yes
[1:36:42] amen if it's the literal life of Jesus
[1:36:44] Christ it can't do anything else and
[1:36:47] that takes faith it takes faith and
[1:36:49] faith is a
[1:36:50] revelation I don't care if you've been
[1:36:52] raised completely the message and you
[1:36:54] say well you know Jesus said I'll be
[1:36:56] with you even in you it's not emotions
[1:36:59] emotions has nothing to do with it
[1:37:00] Sensations has nothing they all come
[1:37:02] part of it I don't believe in a dead
[1:37:04] religion I believe in all that too but
[1:37:06] it's going to take the literal Life of
[1:37:07] Christ to give us a word birth you say
[1:37:09] well my parents was a believer that
[1:37:11] don't have nothing to do with it either
[1:37:13] I don't care you say well I don't cut my
[1:37:14] hair and I don't wear pants uh that
[1:37:17] won't gain you interest in heaven that's
[1:37:19] that's required but that won't gain you
[1:37:21] interest amen you say well I I I never
[1:37:24] did go back in the world well what about
[1:37:26] the Rich Young Ruler he B the Rich Young
[1:37:28] Ruler he obeyed all the Commandments I
[1:37:30] mean he'd been to church all his life
[1:37:31] brother M Dr dramatized that and he he
[1:37:34] done everything and Jesus said but
[1:37:36] there's one thing you lack he said I've
[1:37:38] done everything else I've kept the law
[1:37:40] I've kept the Judgment I'm still Li I've
[1:37:42] been to church I've been to the
[1:37:43] synagogue I've done everything but one
[1:37:46] thing thou lack us what did he like what
[1:37:48] just because he was was rich and had a
[1:37:50] lot of possessions over that that wasn't
[1:37:53] that was issue the issue was he was not
[1:37:56] willing for total surrender it takes a
[1:37:59] total surrender I don't care if you're
[1:38:01] poor as a poer riches Bill Gates or
[1:38:04] whoever that has nothing to do with it's
[1:38:06] got to be a total
[1:38:08] surrender amen so even people that's
[1:38:11] raised in the message you know he said
[1:38:12] well you know it's like one brother he
[1:38:14] said and he he said he was raised in the
[1:38:16] message his daddy was a preacher he come
[1:38:18] to AIDS you know to receive and and the
[1:38:20] brother was the brother was he was he
[1:38:22] wasn't arrogant
[1:38:23] but he was genuine because he had never
[1:38:26] cursed and lied and drank and done
[1:38:28] anything been out in the world I mean
[1:38:29] he's raised in church stayed in church
[1:38:30] done everything right far as and he said
[1:38:33] daddy said I mean I'm not being arrogant
[1:38:34] said what do I have to repent of what
[1:38:37] have I got to repent of well first of
[1:38:39] all you're born in sin shaped iniquity
[1:38:41] come to this world speaking lies your
[1:38:43] first nature I don't care if it's a good
[1:38:45] nature it's still a corrupt nature it's
[1:38:47] not the nature of Christ it's not the
[1:38:49] life of Christ it's still got to be
[1:38:51] transformed it's got to be renovated
[1:38:53] be not conformed to this world but be
[1:38:55] you transformed by the renewing of your
[1:38:57] mind that word renewing means renovation
[1:39:00] when you renovate a house what do you do
[1:39:01] you take out all the old stuff and put
[1:39:03] new stuff in so your mind has got to be
[1:39:06] renovated because we got all that
[1:39:07] garbage and trash out there that we had
[1:39:09] in the world but maybe you didn't have
[1:39:11] all that stuff in the world like that
[1:39:12] but you still your mind has got to be
[1:39:15] renovated it doesn't matter whether you
[1:39:18] was whether you was out in the world or
[1:39:19] if you wasn't out in the world You'
[1:39:20] still got to have a nature change CU you
[1:39:22] born and old sour brother man said snake
[1:39:26] nature that's why he the prophet said
[1:39:29] full obedience to every word of God
[1:39:31] entitles you to the Token whether he's
[1:39:34] in the world or out of the world you
[1:39:35] still got to eat the book you still got
[1:39:37] to eat the word you've got to digest the
[1:39:39] word and when you digest the word you
[1:39:40] become the word and that's got to be in
[1:39:43] your
[1:39:44] soul this is a this this quote here out
[1:39:48] of the Dallas token I thought was really
[1:39:50] really good we're talking about that
[1:39:52] life has got to be on on the
[1:39:54] inside it's good to be on the outside I
[1:39:57] mean the German Baptist the Amish the
[1:40:01] menites they
[1:40:03] outshine the greater percentage of of of
[1:40:05] message women I mean they cover
[1:40:07] everything I mean from the top of their
[1:40:09] head to the soul of their feet you know
[1:40:11] what I mean but they don't have life I
[1:40:15] mean I'm not saying that none of them
[1:40:16] saved I'm not saying that I'm just say
[1:40:17] they don't have this token
[1:40:19] life brother man said in this message
[1:40:22] the token he said said God's bloodbound
[1:40:25] promises makes us free I want you to
[1:40:27] listen this is a tremendous statement
[1:40:29] God's bloodbound promises makes us free
[1:40:32] from sin and shame and different from
[1:40:35] the rest of the world different from the
[1:40:38] rest of the world he said now notice way
[1:40:42] he phrases this and don't get it wrong
[1:40:44] this is not giving you a license he said
[1:40:46] you don't have to dress different
[1:40:48] anybody can dress different in other
[1:40:50] words he's saying just because you dress
[1:40:52] different anybody can do that that like
[1:40:54] I just said Amish menites German
[1:40:56] Baptists they dress different but what
[1:40:59] do they have said anybody can dress
[1:41:02] different you have to be on the inside
[1:41:08] different so
[1:41:10] simple you have to be on the inside
[1:41:14] different life is on the
[1:41:17] inside life is on the
[1:41:21] inside life is in the blood where's the
[1:41:23] blood on your blood's on the inside life
[1:41:26] is on the inside he said it's not
[1:41:29] dressing not wearing that's all part of
[1:41:31] it but that's not it it's you got to be
[1:41:33] different on the inside that's why we
[1:41:35] have to have a word birth we have to
[1:41:37] have a nature change we have to meet
[1:41:38] that Pillar of Fire we got to see that
[1:41:41] he said the kingdom of God is Not meat
[1:41:42] and drink or wearing of apparel but it's
[1:41:45] a longsuffering goodness gness patience
[1:41:48] in the Holy Ghost he said now the
[1:41:50] promises makes free from sin show knows
[1:41:53] that God has has it recogn has it
[1:41:56] recognized your sin David said blessed
[1:41:58] is the man whom God will not impute sin
[1:42:01] isn't that wonderful blessed is the man
[1:42:04] who God will not impute sin it's not
[1:42:06] reckoned God doesn't hold any sin
[1:42:08] against you and God will never impute
[1:42:10] and God will never impute sin over the
[1:42:13] token so what does that show us if we
[1:42:15] got the token there's no there's no sin
[1:42:17] imputed that's right AB that's why he
[1:42:20] can say an invisible Union you stand
[1:42:22] absolutely virt
[1:42:23] as a Son of God before God you never sin
[1:42:25] in the first place you trapped into it
[1:42:28] but your virtuous blood wash pure uh
[1:42:32] unadulterated uh have a virgin womb and
[1:42:35] everything God will never impute sin
[1:42:37] over the token because the token is the
[1:42:39] paid sign that God has already received
[1:42:43] it and you got that token for it amen
[1:42:45] your faith again it's Faith your faith
[1:42:48] has bought it your faith has bought it
[1:42:53] your faith gives you God gives you the
[1:42:55] faith it well you said it's your faith
[1:42:57] but God gives you the faith we know it's
[1:42:58] your faith God gives you the faith but
[1:43:01] you got to have that faith and you have
[1:43:03] the purchase price of your redemption in
[1:43:05] your body to worship him and show forth
[1:43:07] his promises you get the inside right
[1:43:10] the outside will be right that's the
[1:43:12] whole thing you get the inside dressed
[1:43:14] right the outside will dress
[1:43:16] right don't dress the outside first you
[1:43:18] got to well you that's fine you know but
[1:43:20] you got to get the inside you got to get
[1:43:22] the inside right too amen but amen just
[1:43:26] because you dress right that don't prove
[1:43:27] you right on the inside but you've got
[1:43:29] to have life on the inside and again
[1:43:33] notice your faith is what bought it so
[1:43:35] another little simple thing you say well
[1:43:37] I how do I see the pillar of fire or do
[1:43:40] I see the fire or will I see the pillar
[1:43:42] of fire well then they say well will I
[1:43:44] see the pillar of fire the answer is
[1:43:46] actually yes and no you're not going to
[1:43:49] see it with your eyes but you're going
[1:43:50] to see it with your heart you're not
[1:43:52] going to see it with your eyes you may
[1:43:53] see it with your eyes but you're going
[1:43:55] you're definitely going to see it with
[1:43:56] your heart and and see means to
[1:43:58] understand see well I just can't see it
[1:44:00] you mean you don't understand it but you
[1:44:02] will see it with your heart Amen brother
[1:44:05] man said I'm going to call you bride so
[1:44:07] that you'll understand now listen I've
[1:44:09] got five more pages but I've run out of
[1:44:11] time so we just have to quit but I do
[1:44:13] want to cover this one thing or just for
[1:44:16] a for a
[1:44:18] minute uh we read that scripture
[1:44:24] about the Lord
[1:44:26] Jesus and
[1:44:28] he's Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost
[1:44:31] returned from Jordan and was led by the
[1:44:33] spirit Into the
[1:44:34] Wilderness what is being full of the
[1:44:36] Holy Ghost that's a that's a pretty deep
[1:44:40] subject what
[1:44:41] is so I'm gonna give it to you in about
[1:44:44] two and a half
[1:44:46] minutes it means
[1:44:50] this when the word for the hour
[1:44:53] has come to its season and embodied
[1:44:56] itself and the spirit of the word is in
[1:44:59] that vessel for his its fulfillment then
[1:45:03] you're filled with the Holy Ghost so we
[1:45:05] better read that again when the word for
[1:45:07] the hour has come to its season and
[1:45:09] embodied itself and the spirit of that
[1:45:12] word is in that vessel for it
[1:45:15] fulfillment and you could take Mary the
[1:45:17] word for the hour in her days was a
[1:45:18] virgin shall conceived that word came
[1:45:20] back through through an angel to her it
[1:45:22] had to body is somewhere so she said be
[1:45:24] it unto me so that word was embodied and
[1:45:26] then she believed it and then the spirit
[1:45:28] of God fulfilled it for that season so
[1:45:30] what you saying what's the word for this
[1:45:32] hour what's the word for our hour it's
[1:45:33] Malachi 4 for that word everybody can't
[1:45:35] receive it but that word has got to take
[1:45:37] has got to be embodied in somebody so
[1:45:39] that word has got to be take on a
[1:45:42] fleshly form so when that word for this
[1:45:44] hour is is embodied amen and then the
[1:45:47] spirit makes takes that word and makes
[1:45:48] it live then that's being filled with
[1:45:51] the Holy Ghost because brother so what
[1:45:52] is is the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:45:54] it's when you can receive the word for
[1:45:56] the hour and manifest the word for the
[1:45:58] hour so being full of the Holy Ghost is
[1:46:00] when you can receive the word and
[1:46:02] believe the word and manifest the word
[1:46:04] for this hour and you say well you know
[1:46:06] but I just need Assurance you you got
[1:46:09] Assurance I just gave you the Assurance
[1:46:11] if you've met the requirements of God
[1:46:13] then just believe
[1:46:15] it it ain't going to be no fleshly
[1:46:17] manifestation amen you don't have to be
[1:46:20] you might cry brother man said this he
[1:46:22] said when you get the Holy Ghost he said
[1:46:25] will I speak in tongues he said I may I
[1:46:28] may not will I shout he said you may
[1:46:31] shout you may not will I dance you said
[1:46:34] you may dance you may not but there's
[1:46:36] one thing you will do this is a direct
[1:46:38] quote he said the one thing you will do
[1:46:40] you will bear the fruit of the spirit
[1:46:42] and that's love joy peace longsuffering
[1:46:44] gentleness pees make kindness he said
[1:46:48] you will because that's the very nature
[1:46:50] of God that's the life of God that's the
[1:46:52] nature of character cuz when you get the
[1:46:54] Holy Ghost you get the literal life of
[1:46:56] God so that is the character of God if
[1:46:59] you dance fine if you speak in Tong fine
[1:47:01] if you shout fine that's all fine but
[1:47:03] that don't have nothing to do with it
[1:47:04] it's getting the the very nature of God
[1:47:07] to be transformed into His Image that's
[1:47:10] why he said you will bear the fruit of
[1:47:13] the
[1:47:14] spirit it's not a fleshly evidence
[1:47:17] people can say anything listen when we
[1:47:18] first musicians come on when we first
[1:47:20] come into the message
[1:47:23] we thought and we were wrong about it
[1:47:24] but we thought man if you can see this
[1:47:27] message you got the Holy Ghost you're
[1:47:30] you're good to go you're sealed and if
[1:47:31] you can understand seals and pulls and
[1:47:34] Mysteries and this and that and this and
[1:47:36] that 40 years ago if you if you can
[1:47:38] understand this message you got it but
[1:47:41] we found out that wasn't true amen that
[1:47:44] wasn't
[1:47:47] true well I don't call names but he said
[1:47:51] some some of the ministers that have
[1:47:54] fallen and it's all public knowledge
[1:47:56] I'll just take one I mean brother Tim of
[1:47:58] all Tim M of all the people I really
[1:48:00] really loved and admired I mean I mean
[1:48:03] I'm just I just my mind just don't put
[1:48:05] it together that's right brother I mean

[1:48:23] how can it
[1:48:25] be how can you have a how can you have
[1:48:27] an intellectual understanding and preach
[1:48:29] the truth preach the words and yet
[1:48:31] there's no
[1:48:32] Revelation no representation I trust he
[1:48:35] comes back I hope he comes
[1:48:37] back but how can it
[1:48:42] be it's first of all it's sovereignly
[1:48:45] given but it's got to be a word birth
[1:48:48] the literal Life of Christ has got to be
[1:48:50] in you it's got to be by Revelation you
[1:48:52] got to have it we've got to have it
[1:48:53] ain't going to make no Rapture without
