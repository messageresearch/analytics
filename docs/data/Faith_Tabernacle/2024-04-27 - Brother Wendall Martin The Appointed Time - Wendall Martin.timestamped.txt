[24:16] other we also get closer to God Amen and

[42:07] which God hath given to the sons in his
[42:11] time amen I want to minister tonight on
[42:15] the appointed
[42:16] time I would also like for us to turn
[42:20] just real quickly to uh uh Revelations
[42:25] 10 amen this a familiar passage of
[42:28] scripture amen and then we'll let you
[42:31] have your
[42:32] seats Revelations 10 and one and I saw
[42:37] another Mighty Angel come down from
[42:38] heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[42:40] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[42:44] were as it were the Sun and his feet as
[42:46] pillars of
[42:47] fire and he had in his hand a little
[42:51] book
[42:52] open now Revelations 5 lets us know
[42:56] there was a time
[42:58] of this Mighty Angel which was Christ
[43:00] the angel of the Covenant there would be
[43:03] a little book
[43:05] open so there's an appointed time and he
[43:08] set his right foot upon the sea and his
[43:10] left foot upon the Earth and he cried
[43:12] with a loud voice as when a lion Roth
[43:15] and when he had cried seven saying unto
[43:17] me seal up those things which the seven
[43:19] Thunders uttered and write them not and
[43:23] the angel which I saw upon stand upon
[43:26] the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his
[43:28] hand to heaven and swear by him that
[43:31] liveth forever and ever who created
[43:33] heaven the things therein are in the
[43:35] earth the things that therein are but in
[43:38] the days of the voice of the seventh
[43:41] angel now this is an appointed time he's
[43:44] given us a little time piece here when
[43:46] he shall begin to sound the mystery of
[43:48] God should be finished as he has
[43:49] declared to his servants the prophets
[43:52] and the voice which I heard from Heaven
[43:54] spake unto me again and said go and take
[43:58] the little book which is oer and I went
[44:01] unto the angel and said unto him give me
[44:03] the little book and he said take it and
[44:06] eat it and it shall make thy belly
[44:08] bitter but it shall be in thy mouth
[44:11] sweet as honey and I took the book out
[44:13] of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it
[44:16] was in my mouth sweet as honey and I
[44:19] soon as I eaten it my belly was in
[44:22] tongues and Kings thank you for your
[44:25] patience let's go to the Lord in prayer
[44:27] father we thank you for your
[44:30] love we thank you Lord for this
[44:33] wonderful meeting in the presence of the
[44:36] Lord that we have felt and the wonderful
[44:39] songs of Zion that have been
[44:41] sung and I pray Lord that have laid upon
[44:43] my heart I pray father that you would
[44:46] anoint me Lord to speak only as you
[44:49] would have to speak that you would
[44:51] anoint all of the ears to hear as you
[44:54] want them to hear father we love you and
[44:57] we thank you and we give you glory and
[44:59] honor in the name of the Lord Jesus
[45:02] Christ can the church the appointed time
[45:06] I I think finding our place in scripture
[45:10] is a
[45:11] must in order to have a resting place
[45:14] for Faith you have got to know where you
[45:18] are in
[45:20] scripture you have got to know what is
[45:22] required from you in
[45:25] scripture you've got to know
[45:27] amen that there's no way that faith can
[45:31] ever stand solid unless there is amen a
[45:36] a solid foundation because we are not
[45:40] amen salvation does not come from the
[45:42] bottomless pit salvation comes from a
[45:45] well-founded faith in the word of God
[45:48] Amen we're not based on Theory we're not
[45:51] God Amen and too many too many times we
[45:55] go from camp meeting to camp meeting
[45:57] meeting we go from preacher to preacher
[46:00] amen we we we get a a special feeling
[46:04] amen we we we we get something amen
[46:08] sometimes we're looking for something to
[46:09] know that we've got the baptism of the
[46:12] Holy Ghost or we with those things thank
[46:14] God for C meetings thank God for the
[46:17] gifts and thank God for the uh one and
[46:21] and even preachers thank God for the
[46:23] preacher but our faith is not Reliant
[46:26] upon the preacher our faith is Reliant
[46:30] upon thus saith the Lord the Vindicated
[46:34] word for this hour amen and there there
[46:37] is a position of the believer that can
[46:40] only be found through the word of God
[46:44] Amen now amen the we we do not rely on
[46:49] gifts we don't rely on gifted men I I
[46:52] Amen brother sea mentioned we came from
[46:55] uh Pentecost and we uh uh we I could
[46:57] tell you a few stories on Amen uh uh
[47:01] upon go back to that again you know when
[47:03] I came into the message of the hour I
[47:05] found that God had a very specific word
[47:08] for me and this specific word amen is
[47:12] something that no devil no trial no
[47:15] emotion no anything can take me from can
[47:18] you say amen amen and so through a
[47:22] Vindicated Prophet that has come in this
[47:25] generation we can stand clearly and
[47:28] identify and be able to see amen the the
[47:33] times that God has has placed upon the
[47:36] church amen not not every generation not
[47:39] every Church age knew what they were but
[47:42] it was in this generation that God came
[47:46] with a specific anointing place you in
[47:51] this book because it was going to be
[47:53] needed it was going to be it had to be
[47:56] something
[47:57] amen this is the ending up of all things
[47:59] can you say Amen now the three-fold
[48:03] purpose amen of Christ would be summed
[48:05] up in in this one phrase amen bringing
[48:09] many sons unto glory amen the promises
[48:12] of God now I want you to look at this
[48:14] because the promises of God in the
[48:17] scripture are on condition amen the
[48:20] there is a certain timing there is a
[48:24] certain season that that must be right
[48:28] Amen in other words you could not expect
[48:31] God Amen to send a Rapture in the second
[48:35] Church age or the fourth Church age
[48:37] there has to be the specific time a
[48:42] specific season for that time and for
[48:46] that
[48:47] message can you say Amen now the prophet
[48:50] would tell us there are three things
[48:52] that we must be we we must not do you
[48:55] must not misinterpret the scripture you
[48:57] must not misplace the scripture they are
[49:00] because only then will you be able to
[49:03] tell time well glory to God Amen now I
[49:07] just want to let you know right now
[49:08] God's got a master plan God's God an
[49:13] eternal purpose amen and he has been
[49:16] working this plan for the last 6,000
[49:18] years he has been prophets did not
[49:21] realize amen that they were bringing
[49:24] Stone upon Stone they were were bringing
[49:27] the Lord Jesus Christ the perfect
[49:30] Redeemer to the Earth amen and all of
[49:33] the offerings and all of the sacrifices
[49:35] and all of the temple and the priesthood
[49:38] all of these things were adding up to
[49:41] and Christ would come in a
[49:45] body oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[49:49] they did not know what was going on
[49:52] Hallelujah but I want to tell you amen
[49:54] when it came there was the elect that
[49:58] knew what God was
[50:01] doing
[50:03] man now he sets the times and then he
[50:06] works everything to that time the cogs
[50:10] of God's prophetic will they grind very
[50:14] slowly but they grind very
[50:17] surely to Abraham amen he told him he
[50:21] says at the appointed time you're going
[50:23] to have the child can you say m
[50:27] Christ came at the fullness at a
[50:30] specific time let me tell you here
[50:32] tonight you're not here by
[50:35] accident you're here at a specific time
[50:38] for a specific purpose you're here to
[50:41] fulfill a specific portion of the
[50:44] scripture I let Once you turn to your
[50:46] neighbor and tell them you're here with
[50:48] a
[50:50] purpose hallelujah amen now when God
[50:54] sets those times when God sets those
[50:58] times it would be it would be sin for
[51:01] you not to follow those
[51:05] Seasons Hallelujah the scripture says
[51:07] that the Israelite would be totally cut
[51:10] off from the people if he did not bring
[51:12] the offering in of the Lord in his
[51:15] appointed season and that that man would
[51:18] bear his sin so if you did not recognize
[51:21] the season and you did not worship in
[51:25] that season then then you would have to
[51:27] bear the reproach of your sin because
[51:30] God sets the seasons and he expects
[51:34] you he expects you to honor his word in
[51:40] that
[51:41] [Applause]
[51:43] season amen now identifying those
[51:47] seasons are so his
[51:49] plan
[51:51] season and the time strike
[51:55] zero then you can recognize God in his
[52:00] word because it is living before you in
[52:04] your
[52:07] presence well praise the Lord Brother
[52:10] Brandon in our life God sets times and
[52:15] time limits and then it works all to
[52:18] that
[52:20] time he says many of them before the
[52:22] coming of the Lord Jesus they were there
[52:25] uh they were many thought false things
[52:27] raised up that said this is the Messiah
[52:30] and many false things taking place
[52:32] according to scripture just before the
[52:33] coming of the Lord and people tried to
[52:36] do it within themselves they tried to
[52:38] make God's word fit in their program but
[52:42] you've got to do it vice versa amen
[52:45] you've you've got to fit in God's
[52:50] program now there's too many times amen
[52:53] there's been too many times that that
[52:55] we're trying to get God's program to fit
[52:57] in our program there ain't none of your
[53:00] praying there ain't none of your trying
[53:02] is going to make God's word do something
[53:05] different than what he's already
[53:08] predestinated so you know what God is
[53:10] looking for God's looking for a people
[53:12] that is going to identify what God is
[53:15] doing place them through and vindicate
[53:18] his word through
[53:23] you well glory to God
[53:26] because God's got an appointed
[53:29] [Applause]
[53:31] time can you say
[53:33] Amen now so we must carefully follow the
[53:39] scripture do you realize that that
[53:41] you're not going to find that in the
[53:43] first church of Pentecost or the First
[53:45] Church of the Nazarene or the first
[53:47] church of the Baptist you're going to
[53:49] find that in the prophetic will by the
[53:52] prophetic word coming through a prophet
[53:55] that was ordained for the this
[53:58] generation can you say
[54:00] Amen now God would give us
[54:03] types he would give us the four stages
[54:05] of the wheat plant and as a type of the
[54:08] church amen coming out of the Dark Ages
[54:12] amen one of the Mysteries that were to
[54:14] be unveiled was the mystery of the
[54:18] church that the church has been a
[54:21] mystery for seven Church
[54:24] ages Hallelujah
[54:27] and then we would find that there would
[54:28] be a blade and a tassel and a Shu amen
[54:33] that would bring back the seed the
[54:35] original seed that went into the ground
[54:37] at the beginning would come out can you
[54:40] say amen and declare what it was now we
[54:45] don't want to remain back in the in the
[54:47] blade we don't want to remain black in
[54:50] the in the tassel if the life of God is
[54:54] in the shock we don't want to go back to
[54:59] tassel and when the life of God is in
[55:01] the seed we sure don't want to go back
[55:02] to the
[55:04] shack because there is life in the
[55:10] seed I remember as a
[55:13] Pentecostal amen we would we would get
[55:17] the music and amen I call it Voodoo
[55:20] today amen playing and the beat to going
[55:22] and amen before you know it the the
[55:24] people that came in just I running all
[55:27] over the church and doing whatever and
[55:28] yaking and talking and amen before you
[55:30] know it everyone's sort of getting in
[55:31] the spirit of the voodoo you know and
[55:33] before you know it amen someone gets out
[55:35] and starts dancing and amen and and and
[55:38] and if you needed some help amen our our
[55:40] pastor come that was the kind of of
[55:42] worship that was the kind of and we
[55:44] called that a move of
[55:47] God we called emotions a move of
[55:50] God can you say Amen but what I found
[55:53] out is when the emotion was done I had
[55:57] nothing left in my heart I was still
[56:00] searching in my heart but when the
[56:02] Vindicated word comes along I can still
[56:05] do a little bit of jigging sometimes I
[56:07] can still feel like shouting sometimes
[56:10] but when the shouting is over I've got
[56:12] the power and the praise of God why
[56:15] because the word is Vindicated in
[56:19] me alar and you gave your life to God
[56:23] and you repented of your sin was that
[56:24] real
[56:27] amen but then the Lord begin to move on
[56:30] you and begin to say listen amen those
[56:32] movies you're watching is wrong and amen
[56:34] some of that stuff that you're doing is
[56:35] wrong and amen sanctification begin to
[56:38] work in your life what was it it was God
[56:40] coming on up it was the Holy Spirit
[56:42] dealing with you bringing you into a
[56:45] Sanctified life convicting you of sin
[56:49] telling you I don't want to live in that
[56:51] kind of a
[56:54] vessel that's right
[56:57] glory to
[56:59] God
[57:01] hallelujah I remember brother Sean's
[57:04] motherin-law sister Rebecca's mother was
[57:09] man she was a a rough lady amen and I
[57:14] and I I always thought that if the
[57:15] serpent seed had a
[57:20] picture Hallelujah now brother window

[1:02:02] more and more and
[1:02:07] more of

[1:02:12] fix God's got a purpose for you being
[1:02:16] here God's got a purpose for you being
[1:02:20] under this tent tonight God's got a
[1:02:23] purpose for you being in this generation
[1:02:28] God's looking for spoken word
[1:02:39] Believers
[1:02:41] now God's
[1:02:43] moving so we know that the the man the
[1:02:47] leaf the blade of grass the blade that
[1:02:50] came up that was
[1:02:52] justification the tassel sanctification
[1:02:57] the shut coming on up looking more like
[1:02:58] the wheat that went in the ground it's
[1:03:01] the Pentecostal the baptism of the gifts
[1:03:04] but then it had to
[1:03:06] come the prophet would put it this way
[1:03:10] justification made way for
[1:03:12] sanctification sanctification made way
[1:03:14] for the Harnet
[1:03:16] word it made way for a Son of God
[1:03:22] deputized by God to come complete his
[1:03:26] work here on
[1:03:33] Earth this is where we are
[1:03:37] today can you say Amen
[1:03:41] now he says God's got a time for all
[1:03:44] these things he's got a time we plant
[1:03:47] corn we got a time that we plow corn
[1:03:51] then at the time we harvest corn spring
[1:03:54] rains come Dro through the summer fall
[1:03:57] rain snows you just can't say I plant my
[1:04:01] wheat today and tomorrow and go out and
[1:04:04] harvest it God has time for
[1:04:12] season he has seasons for his
[1:04:16] word praise the
[1:04:18] Lord want wi at the end time he says now
[1:04:20] the Sun comes across and ripens the
[1:04:22] grain now it cannot ripen it all at once
[1:04:25] it goes on maturing constantly ripens
[1:04:29] until it comes to a full year so it is
[1:04:32] to the church today with the church
[1:04:34] started out in his infancy in the Dark
[1:04:35] Ages where it went under the ground and
[1:04:37] it's grow now into maturity and we can
[1:04:41] see it perfectly how that through God
[1:04:44] through nature always can you say Amen
[1:04:47] now now just as we in our individual
[1:04:50] walks we go through San justification
[1:04:53] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:56] we grow into that
[1:04:59] word so has it been throughout these
[1:05:02] Church
[1:05:04] ages they came out of the the Catholic
[1:05:06] system and came out with gesture by
[1:05:09] faith and Wesley comes with
[1:05:11] sanctification you got to live a
[1:05:13] Sanctified life
[1:05:16] 1906 power of the Holy Ghost fell down
[1:05:20] right there on isusa
[1:05:24] Street now there might been a little bit
[1:05:26] of voodoo in our worship but I don't
[1:05:28] believe there was any Voodoo in that
[1:05:29] worship you know why because God was in
[1:05:34] 1906 filling them with the baptism of
[1:05:37] the Holy Ghost they would come in within
[1:05:40] a couple of blocks of of a Zeus Street
[1:05:42] and they season what God said that he
[1:05:44] was going to
[1:05:46] do it was it but God couldn't
[1:05:49] Harvest God couldn't Harvest that
[1:05:53] plant because though
[1:05:56] am I too Elementary for you thou it was
[1:06:01] look so close to the
[1:06:05] seed though it looks so
[1:06:10] close man I wish I'd brought my pictures

[1:06:21] the shocks look so close to the seed
[1:06:26] life was in the
[1:06:30] shock
[1:06:32] but but I'm going to tell you God did
[1:06:35] not save me to be a tongue talking
[1:06:39] [Applause]
[1:06:42] Pentecostal God did not save me to be a
[1:06:46] a Justified church member he didn't
[1:06:49] saved me to be a Sanctified church
[1:06:51] member he those Seasons had their time
[1:06:56] but God had a purpose for me being here
[1:07:01] I am his
[1:07:04] son can you say
[1:07:06] Amen while I'm thankful for what I had
[1:07:10] back there that was not what God's
[1:07:13] intended purpose for me
[1:07:15] [Applause]
[1:07:24] was God sent a
[1:07:26] prophet God raised him up and the
[1:07:30] manifestation of the Holy Spirit was so
[1:07:32] real and he went around the
[1:07:33] world and it was the
[1:07:36] Pentecostals that took him around the
[1:07:38] world and sing the gift of God in his
[1:07:40] life and
[1:07:42] Buddy the manifestations of God were so

[1:07:57] they begin to when when when he came up
[1:07:59] for prayer amen when she came up for

[1:08:24] Vindication was real indication was
[1:08:26] right the Holy Ghost was there we seen
[1:08:27] the first and second amen but there had
[1:08:30] to come a time where the shock was going
[1:08:33] to abort the
[1:08:35] word there had to come a time to where
[1:08:39] the
[1:08:40] shock separated itself from the
[1:08:44] word from the
[1:08:47] [Applause]
[1:08:53] seed 1957 brother BR begin to start
[1:08:55] teaching amen and these things started
[1:08:58] and all of a sudden this one started
[1:09:00] pulling
[1:09:01] [Applause]
[1:09:04] back the
[1:09:05] season the season somebody say the
[1:09:09] season the CH was
[1:09:12] changing it was going from The Shack
[1:09:15] into the
[1:09:20] seed now there were a lot of
[1:09:21] Pentecostals out there am I going too
[1:09:23] slow am I all right there was a lot of
[1:09:25] Pentecostals out there that were that
[1:09:27] were wanting amen the the gifts and they
[1:09:30] loved the gifts and they amen and there
[1:09:32] was a lot of impersonations that were
[1:09:33] going forth but when brother brandham
[1:09:35] came in and the Vindication of God be
[1:09:37] through that Prophet begin to discern
[1:09:40] the changing of Time series he says
[1:09:47] listen you're all speaking in
[1:09:49] tongues you're all prophesying you're
[1:09:52] all doing wonderful things
[1:09:55] but this ain't
[1:09:59] it they were going whoa whoa whoa whoa
[1:10:01] what are you talking about this ain't
[1:10:04] in he said God's wanting to adopt his
[1:10:07] church God's wanting to place his sons
[1:10:11] Over The
[1:10:14] Inheritance what what was taking place
[1:10:16] all of a sudden those Pentecostals that
[1:10:20] were genuine Pentecostals at the
[1:10:22] beginning the power of God was there
[1:10:25] they begin to pull
[1:10:29] back what were
[1:10:30] [Applause]
[1:10:34] they well come on
[1:10:37] Church you know why because it was a
[1:10:42] changing of
[1:10:45] [Applause]
[1:10:47] Seasons it was
[1:10:51] God and just to prove just to prove that
[1:10:54] that that wasn't the original that went
[1:10:56] into the ground they
[1:10:57] denominated fighting over this and
[1:10:59] fighting over that and fighting they
[1:11:01] ended up baptizing three times forward
[1:11:03] three times backwards they were doing
[1:11:04] all everything was just going before you
[1:11:06] knew it the Pentecostal move was just as
[1:11:08] denominated as every other
[1:11:11] denomination and they begin to pull away
[1:11:14] brother brandom explains it really good
[1:11:15] in ad do in in in
[1:11:17] indictment he says now is in effect
[1:11:20] until that hour the blood of the Lamb
[1:11:23] the natural lamb was all right until
[1:11:26] that day but now at the
[1:11:29] crucifixion it changes the old system is
[1:11:33] done there is a new one and the lamb was
[1:11:37] at the sacrifice the lamb the
[1:11:39] sacrificial lamb was on the grounds they
[1:11:41] were condemning doing the very thing
[1:11:44] there that they had to do that's right
[1:11:47] God be blessed for sing this wonderful
[1:11:50] Heavenly light in this last day because
[1:11:54] the churches is doing the same thing
[1:11:57] today until the hour that organization
[1:12:00] and religion is condemned and proved to
[1:12:03] be sacrificing Christ's word from then
[1:12:06] on comes the word and the word only and
[1:12:10] from that Old pasal lamb passed away and
[1:12:13] Christ become our lamb at the day of
[1:12:15] crucifixion and the day that the
[1:12:17] denomination crucified the word of God
[1:12:20] and accepted a Creed in the stad of the
[1:12:22] word that's the day that the word come
[1:12:26] into full effect and that's just been
[1:12:30] [Applause]
[1:12:32] recently it took a
[1:12:34] prophet it took a prophet to

[1:12:55] somebody prepared to walk in the
[1:12:59] authority of that

[1:21:54] within this
[1:21:58] message what is the full
[1:22:00] adoption it's when
[1:22:07] this this old frail body of
[1:22:11] Decay sin and torment mind battles
[1:22:16] that's when this thing is fixing to let
[1:22:18] go of my
[1:22:22] soul and Buddy you think that I'm a
[1:22:24] little Pentecostal right now you wait
[1:22:25] till I get rid of this
[1:22:28] body you wait till

[1:22:35] get into that new
[1:22:37] body I'm going to
[1:22:39] Rejoice with joy
[1:22:43] unspeakable because the word has been
[1:22:47] made real in me it will be a season of
[1:22:53] sunship
[1:23:04] now what is season what is this season
[1:23:08] of
[1:23:09] adoption
[1:23:10] Sons Coming of
[1:23:14] Age
[1:23:17] Sons ain't little Pentecostal babies no
[1:23:20] more Sons
[1:23:24] not giving the preacher a hard time
[1:23:26] anymore
[1:23:30] Sons not flirting with the girl instead
[1:23:33] of loving on your that's coming into
[1:23:35] that
[1:23:36] word more God give me the
[1:23:41] reality can you say
[1:23:44] Amen now some people say it's
[1:23:49] Deeds they want to
[1:23:51] put adoption as if it's a bunch of
[1:23:53] legalism
[1:23:57] brother Bron says I don't condemn the
[1:23:59] good
[1:23:59] works I don't condemn their hospitals
[1:24:03] and good things they do I think it's
[1:24:06] wonderful God's blessing to poor
[1:24:08] suffering Humanity I don't condemn all
[1:24:10] those things those other the things
[1:24:12] they're doing fine just fine they're
[1:24:16] great organizations and millions of
[1:24:17] dollars I'd sure rather see that than
[1:24:20] bootle joints on the corner
[1:24:21] anytime I certainly honor them as
[1:24:24] minister standing in the
[1:24:25] Pulpit but when it comes to time for
[1:24:29] gathering together at the end of the
[1:24:33] dispensation Bunch your neighbor and
[1:24:35] what is Christ how do we get in him 1
[1:24:39] Corinthians 12 by one Spirit we are all
[1:24:40] baptized into one body which is the body
[1:24:43] of Christ made partakers of every gift
[1:24:45] and every good thing that he's got is
[1:24:47] that right and the Earth is groaning
[1:24:51] crying waiting for the Manifest ations
[1:24:55] that when Christ and his church will
[1:24:59] unite
[1:25:02] together
[1:25:05] now what makes this so
[1:25:09] different we've had the moving of the
[1:25:12] spirit every all through these other
[1:25:15] Ages come on go back and look at the
[1:25:17] church age
[1:25:18] books history says that Christ was there
[1:25:25] the supernatural was all through that
[1:25:32] church it's been said that Martin Luther
[1:25:34] had all nine spiritual
[1:25:36] gifts while smoking his cigar his
[1:25:50] pipe he's
[1:25:52] placing must be in a season then he
[1:25:54] stops again and says time and season and
[1:25:58] it must be according to his
[1:26:03] word it must I don't care how well you
[1:26:05] say this ought to be and that ought to
[1:26:07] be and this ought to be it's got to be
[1:26:12] according to his word be given
[1:26:15] accordingly praise the
[1:26:17] Lord because you are not here to fill up
[1:26:22] another church age
[1:26:24] you are not here to build up another
[1:26:28] kingdom you are here to raise the dead
[1:26:33] of the past Seven
[1:26:35] [Applause]
[1:26:42] Ages amen
[1:26:51] Sons the book was closed
[1:26:55] in the age of the fullness of time in
[1:26:58] the age then God sends a
[1:27:02] prophet opens time for you to stand in
[1:27:06] the position that I've been or that I've
[1:27:09] ordained for Adam the season is calling
[1:27:13] for matured
[1:27:16] [Applause]
[1:27:20] Sons that's right and since the season
[1:27:23] was calling for it there had to be an
[1:27:29] answer and since God is behind the grand
[1:27:32] scheme of things and he created the
[1:27:36] hunger he's also got to
[1:27:39] invented are you hearing
[1:27:42] me there there's a brother in our church
[1:27:44] he he invented a he invented a a a Saul
[1:27:47] he's a he he's a he's on it and so amen

[1:27:53] right inside the the office or in in the
[1:27:56] house or whatever and no dust is going
[1:27:58] to escape that and so he he went over to
[1:28:01] the is a world that is in need in this
[1:28:06] evil World demons are
[1:28:10] everywhere evil is everywhere if there
[1:28:14] was ever a time for Sons and Daughters
[1:28:18] to come to their
[1:28:22] position this is the
[1:28:29] Seasons denomination says I've got it
[1:28:32] didn't have it Baptist says we've got it
[1:28:35] didn't have it that great man says I've
[1:28:38] got it didn't have it it wasn't the
[1:28:42] season but now The Season's here now

[1:29:02] closing amen is this okay here
[1:29:06] tonight what was that adoption
[1:29:11] about gave him his
[1:29:14] name this is not done in a corner
[1:29:16] somewhere this is for all to see this is
[1:29:18] the
[1:29:19] day that he was going to place his son
[1:29:22] his air
[1:29:25] now before that day as long as that son
[1:29:27] was a
[1:29:29] child he differed nothing he was had no
[1:29:36] Authority he had
[1:29:41] no had nothing there
[1:29:44] to there was nothing there about him he
[1:29:47] was still a
[1:29:49] son I let let me just let me just put
[1:29:51] this right here
[1:29:55] what I have found is in all the
[1:29:57] wonderful and what I have what I have
[1:29:59] partook
[1:30:01] of what I have
[1:30:04] experienced there is nothing that is any
[1:30:06] more
[1:30:07] settling than Vindicated
[1:30:16] word the gifts have been throughout all
[1:30:18] of the
[1:30:19] ages the gifts have been that the gifts
[1:30:22] the gifts have been here
[1:30:26] and the prophet have told us that
[1:30:27] whether whether it be prophecy or
[1:30:30] whether it be knowledge or whether it be
[1:30:33] any of these things the prophet Paul
[1:30:35] says they will
[1:30:37] cease but there's one thing that'll last
[1:30:39] and endure
[1:30:40] forever and that's what has been given
[1:30:42] pastor's door of his office just begging
[1:30:46] God to give me a
[1:30:48] word now he wouldn't know it I'd be out
[1:30:51] there in the in the daytime at my at at
[1:30:53] at at my pastor's office in Pentecost
[1:30:55] and you know what God would move upon
[1:30:57] that Pastor he wouldn't know I was I was
[1:30:59] I was back I was to me was that real you
[1:31:02] better believe it was
[1:31:05] real come
[1:31:08] on but the next
[1:31:11] week I was backed down in the Molly
[1:31:13] grubs I was backed down
[1:31:19] [Applause]
[1:31:21] why hear me Church
[1:31:24] are you hearing
[1:31:26] me but when the message
[1:31:28] come when the power of the word
[1:31:31] come when that something come and
[1:31:33] settled my
[1:31:42] heart
[1:31:50] Hallelujah as we wind down here
[1:31:55] tonight I've preached too much and not
[1:31:58] not not got to where I wanted to get
[1:32:05] to but when God or when when a
[1:32:09] son that was that was the father
[1:32:11] initiating the son into
[1:32:15] manhood that's that's the
[1:32:18] time every one of
[1:32:20] us need to initiate our sons into man
[1:32:23] man hood matter of fact that's the
[1:32:26] reason why we've got so
[1:32:30] many wimy
[1:32:33] [Applause]
[1:32:35] males because the sons have never been
[1:32:38] initiated into manhood by their
[1:32:50] father it is the Father's responsibility
[1:32:54] to
[1:32:55] initiate his boy into
[1:33:00] manhood amen
[1:33:03] now I I I looked there at Adam and
[1:33:07] though Adam didn't really have to grow
[1:33:09] he was born in Perfection or created in
[1:33:13] Perfection no doubt when he looked into
[1:33:15] his father's eyes and he sees the sheer
[1:33:16] Delight re radiating from father and his
[1:33:20] father says you're my
[1:33:21] son purpose and call
[1:33:24] and maybe Gabriel looks up to father and
[1:33:28] says you know he looks like you and oh
[1:33:31] look at him he has your eyes and Adam is
[1:33:34] coming to grips with the fact that God
[1:33:36] is his father that the Creator is his
[1:33:40] father that he was created as God takes
[1:33:44] him through the garden and maybe the
[1:33:45] father shows him around the
[1:33:48] galaxies
[1:33:51] amen but there come a day
[1:33:55] when God comes to
[1:34:00] Adam and God initiates
[1:34:03] him and he begins to tell
[1:34:06] him you're
[1:34:09] blessed I want you to be fruitful and I
[1:34:11] want you to multiply and I want you to
[1:34:14] replenish and I want you to subdue the
[1:34:16] Earth and I want you to have dominion I
[1:34:18] want you to have
[1:34:19] authority Adam is no longer just seeing
[1:34:22] God as some something
[1:34:24] big Adam is seeing
[1:34:32] himself as the very one that he is
[1:34:36] adoring God is telling Adam I'm giving
[1:34:40] you
[1:34:41] Dominion I'm giving you
[1:34:44] Authority I'm calling you I'm placing
[1:34:48] you over the
[1:34:51] kingdom can you say Amen
[1:34:56] what was Mount
[1:35:04] Sunset it was God giving a
[1:35:09] book to his
[1:35:13] sons this wasn't done in secret this
[1:35:16] wasn't done but
[1:35:18] he he had Life Magazine take a picture
[1:35:20] and put it in there he had look and he
[1:35:23] and he had everyone all asking questions
[1:35:26] about but his sons knew what God was
[1:35:29] saying God told that Prophet go back to
[1:35:31] Jeffersonville it's time for the opening
[1:35:33] of the
[1:35:34] seals come on God was going to show them
[1:35:37] that it was going to be a sword in the
[1:35:38] hand that was going to be a place of
[1:35:42] authority we are not
[1:35:44] vagabonds we are not
[1:35:47] Misfits we are
[1:35:50] [Applause]
[1:35:52] Sons turn to your neighbor and say
[1:35:54] you're a
[1:35:56] son maybe you need to say you're a
[1:35:58] daughter on somebody else you are Sons
[1:36:02] and
[1:36:03] Daughters Kingdom Authority has been
[1:36:06] given to
[1:36:08] you the message has equipped you slaying
[1:36:13] my Devils I'll kill him
[1:36:19] myself I don't need somebody else
[1:36:22] getting victory for me
[1:36:24] I'm going to stand with authority I'm
[1:36:27] going to chase Devils I'm going to be a
[1:36:30] serpent
[1:36:36] Bruiser I can no longer look at God like
[1:36:39] I once did far out
[1:36:43] [Applause]
[1:36:44] there when God looked at Adam and said
[1:36:48] Adam I here your you're looking at my
[1:36:50] majesty and you're looking at my
[1:36:51] greatness and I've showed you around the
[1:36:52] galaxies and I've showed you through the
[1:36:55] garden but
[1:36:59] Adam you're a little
[1:37:02] me and what I've done out
[1:37:05] there you're going to do
[1:37:08] here you're in
[1:37:11] control you're in
[1:37:13] Authority this is your
[1:37:16] Galaxy this is your
[1:37:19] Dominion you take authority

[1:37:30] says I lost my church over it and I did
[1:37:32] brother I'm going to tell you right now
[1:37:34] I sing this message I came right in

[1:37:50] probably had 50 women in there with
[1:37:51] pants and shorts and probably had and uh
[1:37:56] so I came back to the next service and
[1:37:57] said what are y'all still doing in

[1:38:01] pants Hallelujah preached on a little
[1:38:04] while longer and short hair and you know
[1:38:06] not just just preaching month later I
[1:38:09] man nothing was happening I just jump I
[1:38:12] remember I jumped off the coming into
[1:38:13] this church building with your pants on

[1:39:15] again or yeah yeah that was the bad way
[1:39:17] of doing
[1:39:19] it huh
[1:39:24] but Mount
[1:39:28] Sunset has given me a totally different
[1:39:30] look of
[1:39:33] God it's not legalism come on it's not
[1:39:36] what I do or don't
[1:39:38] do it's
[1:39:40] [Music]
[1:39:42] not what I found at Mount
[1:39:45] Sunset was the great Eternal
[1:39:48] God has come to Earth
[1:39:53] yes and he's not
[1:39:56] keeping he sent his seventh angel
[1:40:00] messenger and says you are my
[1:40:04] sons you are my
[1:40:08] daughters you have a right to this you
[1:40:12] have come of age
[1:40:15] isn't it's the season of authority it's
[1:40:18] the season of adoption it's the season
[1:40:20] of a body change it's a season
[1:40:24] you can now take your rightful
[1:40:28] place because the
[1:40:31] season is
[1:40:34] here the appointed
[1:40:37] time is
[1:40:41] here if the musicians would
[1:40:46] come I
[1:40:57] I come with
[1:40:59] notes so close to what brother Wayne was
[1:41:02] preaching that then Jonathan got up and
[1:41:05] preached and I had to throw away those
[1:41:10] notes and I say I'm a cook
[1:41:19] Goose but this is something that's been
[1:41:21] been ministering on at our church
[1:41:26] we're not waiting for authority to
[1:41:28] come the authority is
[1:41:34] here come
[1:41:46] on now I told the Rebecca story I
[1:41:49] supposed to have told that right now
[1:41:54] The Time Is
[1:42:00] Here Josh all through history there's
[1:42:03] always been gifted
[1:42:07] men Smith Wigglesworth was one of the
[1:42:09] greatest men how many's ever read on
[1:42:11] Smith
[1:42:12] Wigglesworth one of the greatest Godly
[1:42:16] men God used
[1:42:18] him wonderful man
[1:42:23] throughout our
[1:42:25] history the anointing would call fall
[1:42:27] Upon A
[1:42:30] man the anointing fell upon William
[1:42:34] brandham but William brandham was not
[1:42:35] here just as a Gifted
[1:42:41] Man God can never work outside of a
[1:42:44] prophet so when God is wanting to give
[1:42:46] something to his people it has to come
[1:42:48] through a prophet now God had to
[1:42:50] vindicate that man through those gifts
[1:42:52] in his life
[1:42:53] [Applause]
[1:42:56] but the prophet wasn't going to keep it
[1:42:59] to himself now God is inviting every one
[1:43:04] of
[1:43:08] you I'm thankful for the gift that
[1:43:10] brother Jonathan has I'm thankful for
[1:43:12] the gift that brother Caleb has brother
[1:43:14] Lloyd
[1:43:17] has I'm thankful for the gift of Wayne
[1:43:21] Lawson but the book book has been handed
[1:43:23] to me
[1:43:24] [Applause]
[1:43:27] too I'm thankful for the gift of brother
[1:43:30] cross I'm thankful for these
[1:43:34] gifts but the book has been handed to me
[1:43:38] too Authority's been given to me too you
[1:43:41] see well Rebecca can I tell you finish
[1:43:45] telling the
[1:43:46] story that was brother Sea's first
[1:43:51] wife when Rebecca called me to baptize
[1:43:55] her
[1:43:58] mother and we baptized her and what seen
[1:44:01] the great moving of
[1:44:04] God the great Supernatural move of
[1:44:19] God Rebecca died
[1:44:24] six months
[1:44:26] later seven months
[1:44:36] later Rebecca was one of the most
[1:44:39] spiritual girls that I knew
[1:44:41] she used in dreams and a wonderful
[1:44:45] little
[1:44:48] lady and her one heart's desire was
[1:44:52] always
[1:44:53] I want my mama to be saved right Sean I
[1:44:56] want my mama to be
[1:45:04] saved 7 months
[1:45:06] later Sister Rebecca would die at the
[1:45:10] age of
[1:45:14] 30
[1:45:17] God used that little
[1:45:20] lady to speak salvation
[1:45:23] [Music]
[1:45:26] gave her her very heart's
[1:45:33] desire did you know that it was another
[1:45:36] year how how
[1:45:40] long little over a
[1:45:42] year her mother passed away
[1:45:55] God
[1:45:57] saved that woman that I said if there
[1:46:01] was a serpent seed in the dictionary
[1:46:03] there would be a
[1:46:12] picture
[1:46:14] Hallelujah yes sir God made a
[1:46:21] saint it was in his
[1:46:25] season Rebecca had been
[1:46:27] praying all of her
[1:46:32] life they snuck her to pwn E when she
[1:46:35] was just a little girl 15 years old to
[1:46:37] get baptized in Jesus
[1:46:41] name and she always Prayed For Mama but
[1:46:45] in the
[1:46:47] season you say what are you trying to
