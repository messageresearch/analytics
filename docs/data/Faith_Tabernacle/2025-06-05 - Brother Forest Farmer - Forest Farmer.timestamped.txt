[29:27] He's here to fill your cup. Amen. Oh,

[29:48] quench this
[29:50] thirsting of my soul.
[29:57] Oh, bread of
[30:02] heaven. Oh, feed me till I
[30:07] want no
[30:10] more. Here's my
[30:13] cup. Fill it up and make me whole.
[30:21] Sing it as a prayer tonight. For here's
[30:25] my
[30:32] [Music]
[30:40] God.
[30:43] This my
[30:46] [Music]
[30:48] soul. Bread of
[30:53] heaven, feed me till I
[30:58] want no
[31:01] more. Here's my
[31:04] cup. Fill it up and make me
[31:10] [Music]
[31:14] whole. Amen. God bless y'all.
[31:19] Pardon my voice. I
[31:23] uh we just got into a couple of real
[31:26] good services, but then I went outside
[31:30] in a cold front a little bit sweaty and
[31:33] it about caught up with me. But
[31:38] uh by the grace of God though, we're
[31:41] here. And uh if you while you remain
[31:46] standing, if you want to turn in the the
[31:49] scriptures with me to Colossians the
[31:52] first chapter.
[31:58] Uh I'll give you just a moment there to
[32:01] find it.
[32:03] And before we
[32:10] uh before we read it, let's just
[32:13] approach the Lord once again.
[32:16] Father,
[32:19] we've been instructed in this day to
[32:21] pray for revelation more than anything
[32:24] else.
[32:26] May you grant it, Father, that this
[32:29] portion of the word that you just open
[32:32] it up to us, Lord, everything that we
[32:35] have need of,
[32:38] grant it, Father, we pray. for we ask it
[32:41] and we trust you for it in the name of
[32:44] our dear Lord
[32:46] Jesus. Amen.
[32:50] In Colossians 1 and we'll start at uh
[32:55] the 12th
[32:58] verse. Colossians 1 and 12. Giving
[33:02] thanks unto the
[33:05] Father, which hath made us meat to be
[33:09] partakers of the inheritance of the
[33:13] saints in light.
[33:17] And you know that word meat there is not
[33:21] just
[33:24] okay but that word meat actually means
[33:29] fitting
[33:31] or what is perfect. All right.
[33:36] the same way that you wouldn't cram a
[33:39] puzzle piece in that doesn't go there,
[33:43] but you find one that fits it. And when
[33:46] you do, it's the only one that'll work
[33:49] right there. Are you hearing me? But I
[33:53] what I want you to notice in this is
[33:56] that he hath made us
[34:01] fit.
[34:06] who hath delivered us from the power of
[34:09] darkness and hath translated us. That's
[34:13] another big word, but it means to take
[34:16] from one position and to put into
[34:20] another. Praise God. Now I I I know you
[34:25] musicians, you're going to have it over
[34:27] on everybody here because sometimes we
[34:30] will take and transpose from one key to
[34:34] another
[34:35] one now where it was supposed to be one
[34:39] key, but because the singer maybe can't
[34:42] get that high or that low, we'll change
[34:45] it to another key. Then everything will
[34:48] be appropriate.
[34:51] But it's moved from one position of a C
[34:55] chord
[34:57] maybe over here to an A.
[35:01] Are you hearing me? And we that at one
[35:05] time was in darkness and in fellowship
[35:08] with darkness, but he completely moved
[35:12] us out of that key into something that
[35:15] would resonate with the voice of
[35:17] Almighty God.
[35:20] I just I don't know how to appreciate
[35:24] that enough that's good that where he
[35:27] has brought us from and to place he's
[35:32] made us fit
[35:35] into the body of Christ.
[35:38] He's made us fit into the word of the
[35:41] hour for this day. Not back in Luther's
[35:46] day, not back in Wesley's day, but for
[35:50] this day.
[35:52] Amen. Amen.
[35:54] hath translated us into the kingdom of
[35:59] his dear
[36:01] son, in whom we have
[36:05] redemption through his blood, even the
[36:08] forgiveness of sins, who is the image of
[36:13] the invisible God, the firstborn of
[36:16] every
[36:17] creature.
[36:21] Remember, it was
[36:23] Christ that all things that were created
[36:27] were created by him before he ever was
[36:30] in a physical body of Jesus. Amen.
[36:34] Christ, the anointed one, was creating
[36:37] all of it. There you go.
[36:40] For by him were all things created that
[36:43] are in heaven and that are in earth,
[36:46] visible and invisible, whether they be
[36:49] thrones or dominions or
[36:52] principalities or powers. All things
[36:56] were created by him and for him.
[37:02] Amen. May the Lord add his blessings to
[37:05] his word. And as you're being
[37:11] seated, you
[37:14] know what I'd like to look at for a
[37:17] little bit of a subject this this
[37:20] evening.
[37:23] uh just
[37:26] because now any of us that are old
[37:28] enough that we've raised children, we
[37:31] know that there's sometimes that we've
[37:33] had to tell the
[37:35] kids you tell them to do something and
[37:38] why.
[37:39] All right? Because it needs to be done.
[37:43] Why? And after a few times, you just say
[37:47] just because. Amen.
[37:50] Yeah. And and you know, too many times
[37:52] it was just because daddy said so or
[37:55] just because mama said so. You know what
[37:58] I mean? Because they don't really
[38:01] comprehend what the overall picture is.
[38:06] I may get in trouble for this here in a
[38:08] few days when I get home. But but I I
[38:11] I've got a grandson that when he was
[38:14] just a little old bitty fell, maybe four
[38:17] or five years old, uh the Thunderbirds
[38:20] was coming down to Little Rock and uh
[38:23] it's about 2 hours away from us. A and
[38:27] they said, "Well, you know, how are we
[38:29] going to ride?" And I said, "Well, JD
[38:30] can go with us." And Sherry said,
[38:33] "Forest, you don't know what you're
[38:36] getting into." said, "That boy will talk
[38:39] your ears off." I said, "Oh, baby, it'll
[38:43] be all right." And you know, we got
[38:46] about five miles down the road. Papa,
[38:49] how far how much farther is it? I said,
[38:52] "Son, it it's a long ways from here."
[38:55] Okay, we got another three or four
[38:57] miles. Papa, how much farther now?
[39:01] Well, his mama and daddy had driven
[39:05] nonstop about three or four months
[39:07] before that to go out and and uh my son
[39:11] was going to visit his sister. So, it it
[39:14] was the little JD's aunt and and uh they
[39:19] drove straight through from across
[39:22] Nebraska and all that just swapping off
[39:25] drivers. And I said, "Son," he asked me
[39:29] again, "How long is it?" I said, "Son,
[39:32] do you remember how long it was to
[39:36] Idaho?" And he goes,
[39:40] "Uhhuh." I was kidding around with him,
[39:42] of course. I said, "It's farther than
[39:45] that." He goes, "Uh-uh, papa, ain't
[39:48] nothing as far as
[39:50] Idaho." Right.
[39:53] You know, he didn't really understand
[39:55] it's going to be 2 hours or or or it
[39:58] it's going to be 110 miles down to
[40:01] there. And you know, I I couldn't blame
[40:04] it on wanting to take the kids, but
[40:06] because I enjoy seeing them things,
[40:12] y'all pardon me, but I I I'm just going
[40:15] to tell you about me.
[40:18] I I look up and at the end of their
[40:21] little display there of of showing you
[40:24] how that they can come down the runway
[40:26] and go straight up and they end it with
[40:30] five of them and one of them's going
[40:34] straight up a and they're all trailing
[40:37] smoke and four of them are splitting off
[40:40] to the sides like a banana. And that one
[40:44] that keeps going up, he's just going
[40:46] around and around and trailing that
[40:49] smoke.
[40:51] And I I left there one time and I told
[40:54] the kids, I said, "You know what? The
[40:57] prophet of God said that one day we're
[40:59] going to travel like a thought. And I
[41:02] don't know if you'll be able to see me
[41:04] traveling as a thought or not." I said,
[41:07] "But if you look up there and one of
[41:09] them's going yang, yang yang yang." I
[41:12] said, "Just look up there and know that
[41:14] your daddy's having a ball." And church,
[41:17] it is absolutely that real to me.
[41:22] But he didn't understand the distance.
[41:27] And you know what? It
[41:30] uh by the same token, we don't
[41:34] understand the
[41:36] distance in God's time.
[41:40] I told my wife here the other day, I
[41:42] said, you know, I I said, I pray for
[41:45] patience, but I want it right now.
[41:50] But it just don't happen that way,
[41:52] brother John.
[41:55] It it the trials that we go
[41:59] through, what we endure brings patient
[42:04] on us. And and sometimes the way that we
[42:08] get it, now I'm I'm not preaching this
[42:09] on account of what you said when you
[42:11] pulled up, brother. It just fed in
[42:14] there.
[42:17] Not everything that we get from
[42:20] God is good. Wow. But he takes it and
[42:25] makes it for our good.
[42:28] And if we was to ask God, why do I have
[42:31] to go through that? Because All right.
[42:37] Why? Because just because.
[42:40] All right. We can't see what he's doing.
[42:44] We can't see what he's doing with us. We
[42:47] can't see what he's doing with our
[42:49] brother. We can't see what he's doing
[42:51] with our sister. But we just have to
[42:54] pray and trust the Lord. It is him
[42:57] that's We sing the song of amazing
[43:00] grace. But I wonder sometimes if we slow
[43:03] down long enough to listen to the words,
[43:07] it's grace that's brought me safe thus
[43:10] far. And it's grace that's going to lead
[43:13] me on. Not a misplaced grace, not taking
[43:17] grace and making it a disgrace, but real
[43:21] genuine grace where we uh trust the Lord
[43:25] for what he's done and we know what he's
[43:28] brought us through. Amen.
[43:33] Amen. Church, there's a lot of people
[43:37] that the first time that I came to
[43:40] brother Dale Catch's
[43:42] meetings, they ain't here tonight.
[43:50] Well, you say, "Well, brother Farmer,
[43:52] you know, the reason though that we're
[43:54] still here is we just a better grade of
[43:57] people.
[44:01] Really?
[44:04] Well, y'all, I ain't got my wings yet.
[44:08] Come on. Hello.
[44:10] But it's only by his grace that we
[44:13] stand.
[44:16] Amen.
[44:17] We've all come through troubles. We've
[44:20] all come through trials. All right.
[44:24] We've all come up against things that we
[44:27] there was it was beyond our
[44:30] understanding.
[44:31] But the only answer that we could get is
[44:34] to go to the Lord in prayer. Amen. I
[44:38] remember seeing a a a plaque one time
[44:41] said, uh, Lord, grant me the courage
[44:45] to change the things that I can change.
[44:49] And grant me the patience to endure the
[44:53] things I can't change
[44:57] and grant me the wisdom to know the
[44:59] difference. Yes.
[45:02] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[45:05] Why? I want you to a as we would just
[45:16] God's
[45:17] fornowledge. You know, the prophet of
[45:19] God told us that the Bible was so
[45:22] perfectly mathematically set into order.
[45:27] Amen. Amen. Have you ever looked up and
[45:31] seen
[45:32] that in the fornowledge of God that it
[45:36] was going to be 14
[45:39] generations from the
[45:41] covenant with
[45:44] Abraham to the time of David.
[45:47] It wasn't measured in
[45:50] years. It was measured in generations.
[45:54] 14 generations. If a generation was 40
[45:58] years, that'd be 400
[46:01] and
[46:03] 560 years if if I'm figuring right.
[46:07] Yeah.
[46:09] 14 time
[46:11] 40. Are you hearing me? Not not just
[46:15] measured by years, but that it would
[46:18] perfectly fall at 14 generations. Amen.
[46:22] But
[46:25] then from the time of
[46:29] David until that the children of Israel
[46:33] were backslid and was carried into
[46:36] captivity down in Babylon
[46:43] was another 14 generations.
[46:51] It It's phenomenal.
[46:53] Yes, brother. But it's the truth.
[46:57] And then from there, from the time that
[47:00] they was carried into
[47:02] captivity until the time of the Lord
[47:05] Jesus that led all of us out of
[47:07] captivity was another 14 generations.
[47:12] Man can't figure those things. But yet
[47:15] in the mind of God, it always was. And
[47:18] they might have asked why. Why is it
[47:21] like this? But it was just because that
[47:24] God had it already forained in his mind.
[47:28] Why are we gathered here together
[47:30] believing the things that we do when
[47:33] there's churches up and down this holler
[47:36] that they'll preach this and that and
[47:38] something else. And yet when we try and
[47:41] show them what the word of God has made
[47:44] so plain in our day with the loosening
[47:47] of the seals,
[47:50] they can't even comprehend it. Amen. And
[47:54] they say, "Why do you believe that?"
[47:58] Because Amen.
[48:01] Because God ordained us to it.
[48:04] We can't see all of his plan of what he
[48:08] would do, right?
[48:10] Y'all, the first time that I came around
[48:13] you
[48:14] all, I thought we was going to be out of
[48:17] here in 1977.
[48:20] Yeah.
[48:22] Come on.
[48:25] I went to my
[48:27] pastor Sherry and I was going together
[48:30] there in
[48:32] uh the the winter of
[48:35] 75. And I went up to him and I said,
[48:38] "Brother, is it is there even any uh
[48:41] need in us looking forward? Is it a
[48:46] waste of time?" And and he said, "Well,
[48:48] son," he said, "I tell you what, he said
[48:50] the prophet said, "If you're planting
[48:52] ters, just go ahead planting ters."
[48:55] Best advice I ever got. Yes.
[49:01] 14 grand kids later and
[49:06] Amen. You see what I mean? But it wasn't
[49:09] the way that we thought it was
[49:12] that things didn't happen just that way.
[49:15] And then when people had it figured up
[49:17] in their mind instead of staying with
[49:20] the pure word of God, but they just fell
[49:23] away. But what caused you and I to stay
[49:26] with the word? Amen. Because God had a
[49:31] plan on down the road.
[49:33] I didn't think I was going to be here
[49:35] this long.
[49:37] If I'd have known I was going to live
[49:39] this long, I'd have probably took better
[49:41] care of myself.
[49:44] We thought in 2000
[49:47] that it was over. Yeah. Come on. But not
[49:51] everything that had been prophesied had
[49:54] happened yet.
[49:56] True. God had a plan. It was different
[50:00] than my thoughts. It was different from
[50:02] my plans. Amen. But God knew what he was
[50:07] doing. And church, God is right on time
[50:10] tonight.
[50:12] It I don't care how long that you've had
[50:15] a sickness. I don't care how long that
[50:18] you've had a problem. God is always
[50:21] right on time. We sing a song at home.
[50:24] He's an ontime God. Yes, he is. He may
[50:28] not come when you want him, but he'll be
[50:31] there right on time.
[50:34] We can make plans and we'll get held up.
[50:37] Why? Because we don't see what lays out
[50:40] ahead of us. Well, come on now.
[50:48] Brother Kevin met me uh uh down here on
[50:51] on his lunch break and and he said,
[50:54] "Brother," he said, "We we'll get there
[50:56] about the same time." Well, I got here
[50:58] about five minutes before him. And you
[51:02] know, when he got here, he he was
[51:05] apologizing. He said, "Oh, Brother
[51:07] Farmer." He said, "Man," he said, "I
[51:09] hate that you've been waiting on me."
[51:10] Well, I sitting here watching a turkey
[51:12] across the
[51:14] road. You know, it wasn't no big deal to
[51:17] me. And and he said, "Brother, I believe
[51:20] I got behind every slow driver that
[51:23] there is in Christianberg on the way
[51:25] here." And and you know, we can't
[51:28] foresee those things, but God does.
[51:31] Right?
[51:32] Why is it that sometimes he gives us a
[51:35] little nudge, you need to go a little
[51:37] early.
[51:39] Don't go this way. Go around this way
[51:41] over here.
[51:44] We don't know about the ambulance that's
[51:46] got the roadblock.
[51:50] I travel enough that I'm just going to
[51:52] share this with you. You know, a lot of
[51:54] times we get
[51:56] frustrated because of the road work
[52:00] until you get about 40 miles on down the
[52:02] road and you see an accident that just
[52:04] happened and the policeman ain't even
[52:07] got there yet. And it causes us to just
[52:10] say, "Lord, thank you for the road
[52:12] work." Amen.
[52:15] We don't know what's going on, but God
[52:17] has a plan.
[52:21] Church, what we need to do is to be more
[52:24] sensitive
[52:26] to the moving of the Holy Ghost.
[52:33] Amen. Brother Kevin, you're going to get
[52:36] a kick out of
[52:39] this. By the grace of God, I had
[52:42] opportunity to go into Africa uh here
[52:45] two years ago. And when I got over
[52:48] there, they
[52:51] uh I I don't believe that there's a
[52:54] separate message for Africa. Amen. And a
[52:57] separate one for the United States and
[52:59] another one for Europe and another one
[53:01] for the Philippines. I preach the same
[53:04] thing.
[53:06] But you know when I got there because it
[53:08] was a young people's meeting anyway. So
[53:11] I took a message on
[53:15] maturity and they had three bass players
[53:18] up
[53:19] there and they was not in
[53:23] sync and they was all trying to outplay
[53:26] the other one.
[53:30] They had about four guitars.
[53:33] They was all doing the same thing. They
[53:36] wouldn't honor one another when one of
[53:38] them was taking lead. It was just turn
[53:41] it up,
[53:44] boys. And I
[53:46] I somewhere down in the message, I I I
[53:51] said, you know, maturity in a a
[53:54] musician is they will honor the other
[53:57] ones around them. Come on.
[54:04] I said, "And maturity in a musician, the
[54:08] pastor won't have to turn around to you
[54:11] and say, "Uh uh, wait a second. We're
[54:13] having a prayer line here. Uh, we need
[54:16] to approach this a little bit more
[54:18] reverently.
[54:20] But something in a mature musician, he
[54:24] already knows that way the you know,
[54:30] we don't play Amazing Grace like we do
[54:33] our marching design.
[54:36] Amen.
[54:38] Are you hearing me? See, because God's
[54:41] got a plan for worship. And when we come
[54:45] into that, you won't have to turn around
[54:47] and rebuke somebody and tell them every
[54:50] move to make because when they're
[54:52] following the leadership of the Holy
[54:55] Ghost, everything works out well anyway.
[55:00] Gise the Lord,
[55:03] Brother Sean, this one's free.
[55:08] I went back through marriage and divorce
[55:10] here just a couple of weeks ago.
[55:13] Okay. And
[55:14] uh you know
[55:17] for I could see where that some of the
[55:20] sisters took offense to that because
[55:23] they didn't wait until the the very end
[55:26] of it.
[55:30] But brother Brandham was talking about
[55:33] how that a woman could break a man's
[55:36] heart.
[55:41] I I I'm off my notes now, so y'all just
[55:44] bear with me.
[55:46] And he said that nothing could rip his
[55:49] heart out of him like a bad
[55:52] woman. And he says, now I'm talking
[55:55] about the church
[56:03] now. And I
[56:05] wondered how many
[56:09] churches that are not mature
[56:12] enough, but instead of following the
[56:16] leadership of the Holy
[56:18] Ghost, they want to tell the pastor how
[56:21] to do something. Oh
[56:24] my. And I wonder how many of them try to
[56:28] wrap him around
[56:31] something and maybe even get him out of
[56:34] the will of God.
[56:39] Hello
[56:41] church. We all need to find our position
[56:44] and abide in that.
[56:47] And and let me say this. You pray for
[56:50] your pastor whether he's here or if he's
[56:53] not here. you pray for him because the
[56:57] ministry is under such an assault right
[57:00] now that that we see him if it's not a
[57:03] health
[57:04] issue it it's just getting
[57:07] tired but church it's no time for us to
[57:11] get tired
[57:13] it's no time for us to to quit heard
[57:16] brother Brandham talk about how
[57:18] that he didn't want to get docked
[57:22] because that you know if you quit before
[57:24] quitting time that they dock your pay. I
[57:28] don't want to get docked.
[57:32] Amen.
[57:35] I might be getting a little bit
[57:38] old, but it's experience that comes with
[57:41] it. Amen. Preach. But I ain't ready to
[57:44] quit. That's good, brother. Somebody
[57:47] says, "Brother Farmer, you can't drive
[57:49] 20 hours over to the the the East Coast
[57:53] by yourself." I tell them, "Watch me."
[57:56] Go ahead, brother. Amen.
[58:00] We used to sing a song back years ago.
[58:03] It said, "Uh, take up thy cross and
[58:07] follow me. I hear the blessed Savior
[58:10] call." How could I make a lesser
[58:14] sacrifice? Yes, sir. When Jesus
[58:19] gave his all,
[58:24] good, brother. Amen.
[58:27] Uh, church, I I know this ain't no place
[58:29] for jokes, and I'm not saying it is
[58:32] that, but they said the difference
[58:35] between a chicken laying an egg and
[58:37] eating fried chicken, one of them's a
[58:39] donation, the other's commitment.
[58:44] What the Lord Jesus had was absolutely
[58:47] commitment.
[58:49] Yes. I said it was commitment.
[58:53] I don't
[58:55] understand. I don't
[59:05] understand. It's all right, brother.
[59:14] If I was a
[59:16] king, would I leave my
[59:19] throne to die for
[59:24] y'all? But that's what he did.
[59:29] It wasn't a
[59:32] donation, but it was a full commitment.
[59:35] Amen. The prophet of God told us that
[59:38] the Lord Jesus did more dying in
[59:41] Gethsemane.
[59:44] Dying out to himself,
[59:47] he did more dying there than what took
[59:49] place up on Calvary. Amen.
[59:53] Why? Just because he had a plan.
[59:58] I wasn't on the face of the earth then.
[1:00:03] down through the years, how many more
[1:00:06] things could we look at along that same
[1:00:09] line? I I've got a quote in here
[1:00:12] somewhere. I I I'm just not going to
[1:00:14] take the time to read it, but brother
[1:00:16] Brandham was talking about that Isaiah
[1:00:19] said, "What would they think of a man to
[1:00:23] come out and say something that a virgin
[1:00:26] a a word that a virgin shall conceive?"
[1:00:30] Yeah.
[1:00:32] And could you imagine when Isaiah went
[1:00:36] off the
[1:00:37] scene, probably they were some scoffers
[1:00:40] saying, "Well, he missed it on that."
[1:00:42] And about the same way they do about the
[1:00:44] a 20th century prophet cuz they say,
[1:00:47] "Well, California ain't sink, it's
[1:00:49] sinking." Yeah, it is. Yes, it is. Amen.
[1:00:54] But 700 800 years later,
[1:01:00] Amen. Amen.
[1:01:02] Isaiah didn't see it in his time, but
[1:01:05] God had a plan. And because that a
[1:01:08] prophet is made as a reflector of the
[1:01:11] thoughts of God, he just had to say
[1:01:14] exactly what the Lord told him to say.
[1:01:17] It wasn't his obligation to bring it to
[1:01:19] pass no more than when we preach the
[1:01:22] word. It's not my responsibility to
[1:01:25] bring it to pass. But we honor God's
[1:01:28] word anyway because I know that it's the
[1:01:31] truth. Amen. I believe it's on the tape.
[1:01:35] Mary's belief that brother Brandon and
[1:01:38] of course a couple different times he he
[1:01:40] says it a little bit different. One time
[1:01:42] he he said that they was uh uh Mary and
[1:01:46] Joseph was walking down the road. He
[1:01:49] said, "The reason that the Lord Jesus
[1:01:51] came to them is because he always comes
[1:01:54] to somebody that's looking for it."
[1:01:58] Amen. But said that they was walking
[1:02:01] down the road maybe. And and and Mary
[1:02:04] said, "Joseph, did you hear what the
[1:02:06] pastor said this morning? Uh uh what
[1:02:09] does that mean on a virgin shall
[1:02:12] conceive?" Yeah. Amen. They didn't
[1:02:15] understand. Then uh on Mary's belief, I
[1:02:19] I believe is where it is that that
[1:02:21] brother Brandham said that uh uh they uh
[1:02:24] that Mary just wretch in the the the
[1:02:27] place there and pulled out a scroll by
[1:02:30] random and said, "Well, I guess we're
[1:02:33] going to read from Isaiah."
[1:02:36] All right.
[1:02:38] And Joseph started reading
[1:02:41] it. And she said, "Hold it right there."
[1:02:44] said, "What does that mean that a virgin
[1:02:47] shall conceive?" And Joseph said, "Uh,
[1:02:50] well, that's a little bit too deep for
[1:02:56] me." He said, "I don't understand it,
[1:03:00] but I believe it. All right,
[1:03:03] that's me. I don't understand
[1:03:06] everything. I don't know why it's got to
[1:03:09] be this way or that way or something
[1:03:12] else, but I believe it and I know that
[1:03:16] he's working it to my good because
[1:03:18] that's his promise because he has made
[1:03:23] us meet that we fit our part in the word
[1:03:28] of God.
[1:03:30] Amen.
[1:03:32] Praise the Lord.
[1:03:35] We need to
[1:03:37] pray to
[1:03:40] find what does the Lord want me to do.
[1:03:51] Amen.
[1:03:54] We have not been set here just to
[1:03:58] breathe in air and breathe out carbon
[1:04:01] dioxide.
[1:04:04] We've got a higher calling than that.
[1:04:08] There's something for us to do.
[1:04:12] And church, there's work to be done. You
[1:04:15] don't have to go to Africa to be a
[1:04:17] missionary. The prophet of God told us
[1:04:20] that the United States of America needed
[1:04:23] missionaries worse than any place in the
[1:04:25] world.
[1:04:27] I'm a witness of it.
[1:04:30] Amen. Amen.
[1:04:32] Why? We are here to be an example.
[1:04:37] We are here to be a pattern.
[1:04:45] I testify a lot.
[1:04:50] Praise the Lord. Lord, I testify a lot.
[1:04:54] Good, brother. The Lord's given me a lot
[1:04:56] to testify about. Hallelujah.
[1:05:02] I've got a knife here that
[1:05:07] uh it's just a stainless steel bladed
[1:05:10] pocket
[1:05:14] knife. But I I used to carry it all the
[1:05:18] time. It It stays in a case at home now.
[1:05:21] I'll tell you why in just a second.
[1:05:26] One time when we was living over in
[1:05:28] Kentucky there at
[1:05:30] Campbellville, I went to work one
[1:05:33] day and u I didn't have my knife with me
[1:05:38] and I don't feel like I'm dressed if I
[1:05:40] ain't got a pocketk knife. I I got that
[1:05:43] from dad, I guess. But
[1:05:46] uh so all day long I'm cutting open
[1:05:49] buckets, not with my knife, but with a
[1:05:52] razor knife. and and it just felt
[1:05:54] awkward because it ain't what I'm used
[1:05:56] to. And and yes, I get spoiled. I get
[1:06:00] used to something and I want it the way
[1:06:02] I'm used to. I'm probably the only one
[1:06:05] like that.
[1:06:10] Praise. I came home and I I said,
[1:06:12] "Baby," I said, "Have you seen my
[1:06:14] knife?" And and and she said, "For I
[1:06:16] haven't." And she said, "But uh we'll
[1:06:18] look." Well, I I'd done looked
[1:06:20] everywhere I knew to to look for it. And
[1:06:23] uh so the next day she had the boys turn
[1:06:26] over the recliner that I'd sat in and
[1:06:29] and and pulled the cushions out of the
[1:06:32] the couch and and she said, "Force, we
[1:06:36] can't find it." Said, "I've checked all
[1:06:38] your clothes, your work clothes, your
[1:06:40] your dress clothes." And this went on
[1:06:44] for I'm talking about almost two months.
[1:06:48] And I I said I I'm going to have to get
[1:06:52] me I came in from work one. I I said,
[1:06:55] "Baby, did she said force we tore this
[1:06:58] house inside out? They took the the boys
[1:07:01] took the seats out of the
[1:07:03] car. It ain't here."
[1:07:07] And I said, you know, the prophet of God
[1:07:09] said, I know that my billo is is laying
[1:07:13] on, I believe he called it the bureau or
[1:07:16] or the duopo, whichever one it was, at
[1:07:19] home. He said, but with enough faith, I
[1:07:23] could put my hand in my pocket and my
[1:07:27] bill would be there. Amen. Well, I'm
[1:07:30] right-handed. So, your pocket knife goes
[1:07:32] in your right hand front pocket. And
[1:07:35] right then I was sitting down at the
[1:07:37] table. I said, "Sherry, I wish that I
[1:07:39] had enough faith." And I stuck my hand
[1:07:42] in my left hand hip pocket and my knife
[1:07:46] was there. Glory.
[1:07:49] I believe that. Amen. Faith is not
[1:07:52] something that we build up.
[1:07:56] Faith is just something that it's there
[1:07:59] when we have need of it.
[1:08:02] You don't work it up. You don't pump it
[1:08:05] up.
[1:08:07] True, true, true. So I give God the
[1:08:10] glory
[1:08:12] for my pocketk knife. It's all right,
[1:08:14] brother. Are you hearing me? Yes, sir.
[1:08:17] About three years later, I took my first
[1:08:20] missionary trip into the Philippines.
[1:08:23] And when I did, uh there was a a brother
[1:08:26] there, Brother Nollie Viampa. He's he's
[1:08:29] gone on to be with the Lord. He uh was
[1:08:33] taking a tape up for a radio broadcast
[1:08:36] to the the largest city uh near their
[1:08:39] Beak City and uh uh was in an accident.
[1:08:43] A truck hit him, took his
[1:08:47] life, but he was there. We'd preach
[1:08:51] Sunday morning, Sunday night, and was
[1:08:54] just sitting there fellowshipping and
[1:08:57] watch the Lord do something there. two
[1:09:01] ministers church. Y'all think preachers
[1:09:04] don't have problems, but we got problems
[1:09:07] just like everybody else does. Yes, sir.
[1:09:12] These two preachers, they came there
[1:09:14] that evening because they there was an
[1:09:17] American preacher there. Otherwise, they
[1:09:20] wouldn't fellowship with this brother
[1:09:22] where I was at. Oh my. And while I was
[1:09:26] preaching, I got into a a deal. I I
[1:09:29] said, "You know, I'm not from here." I I
[1:09:31] said, "You might be able to tell me
[1:09:33] that's a coconut tree, and it would be a
[1:09:36] banana tree." I said, "But if it's
[1:09:39] putting off fruits, you can tell me it's
[1:09:42] a coconut tree all you want to, but if
[1:09:45] it's got bananas on it, I know what kind
[1:09:47] of a tree that it is." Y'all know what
[1:09:50] I'm talking about. I can preach on green
[1:09:52] beans.
[1:09:57] I said, "You tell me that you've got the
[1:10:00] Holy Ghost, but if we're not bearing the
[1:10:02] fruits of the Holy Ghost, then I know
[1:10:05] that there's something wrong." Those two
[1:10:08] preachers were the first ones at the
[1:10:10] altar that night.
[1:10:12] Oh, God's got a way of getting a hold of
[1:10:15] us. It's not because of some great
[1:10:18] theological idea, but church will just
[1:10:21] say what the Lord lays on our heart.
[1:10:26] At any rate, I
[1:10:31] was we were sharing testimonies and I
[1:10:35] pulled open that little sheepfoot blade
[1:10:37] and and showed him were that I my
[1:10:42] ignorance, but I broke it off using it
[1:10:44] for a screwdriver.
[1:10:51] And we rejoiced over my knife being
[1:10:58] right there.
[1:11:00] He's an everpresent help in the time of
[1:11:02] trouble. If we'll just lean on him and
[1:11:05] not get all frustrated over things.
[1:11:08] Amen. And uh we were sitting there
[1:11:11] fellowshipping. little old uh
[1:11:14] fluorescent light about that long was
[1:11:16] the only light that we had and it hooked
[1:11:19] up to a car battery. Oh my
[1:11:22] people may be poor in this world's
[1:11:26] possessions. Oh, but he was rich. So he
[1:11:29] started telling me about how that when
[1:11:31] they first started that work uh uh way
[1:11:35] out in the jungle where they is at of of
[1:11:38] how that he had worked for the
[1:11:40] government as as a contractor when he
[1:11:43] was in Manila and and when word of that
[1:11:47] got around the same way that in the
[1:11:49] United States we have farm policy but
[1:11:52] over there it was a sugar policy because
[1:11:55] they raised cane sugar and they thought
[1:11:58] that he was a spy from the government.
[1:12:01] So they wouldn't give him no work.
[1:12:03] Nobody would come to church with him
[1:12:05] except one old man started
[1:12:08] coming and they got down to where they
[1:12:11] didn't have any money. They didn't have
[1:12:14] any more groceries in the house. But
[1:12:16] what they did have was a row of trees
[1:12:19] that had coconuts and bananas. Both of
[1:12:23] them just grow over there almost while.
[1:12:26] And he had permission to eat the fruit
[1:12:29] off of that row of trees that bordered
[1:12:32] where the house was that he had rented.
[1:12:35] Amen.
[1:12:36] All they had right then there was no
[1:12:39] coconuts
[1:12:41] ready. But there was one stalk of green
[1:12:45] bananas. And he said, "I prefer eating
[1:12:48] bananas ripe." He said, "But sometimes
[1:12:51] we eat them green and fried. I don't
[1:12:53] like them as well but we eat them. So he
[1:12:57] asked his wife said sweetheart said do
[1:12:59] we eat fried green
[1:13:03] bananas or do we fast for a few days and
[1:13:06] eat ripe bananas? She said you're the
[1:13:09] head of the house. You tell me what to
[1:13:11] do and that's what we'll
[1:13:13] do. He said well then let's pray. He got
[1:13:17] down and he prayed. Amen. When they got
[1:13:21] up, she said, "Do we eat or do we
[1:13:24] fast?" He said, "We
[1:13:28] eat." He went and got his machete,
[1:13:31] climbed up the tree, cut a stalk of
[1:13:33] green bananas out, and his wife caught
[1:13:35] ripe bananas. Praise the Lord. I said,
[1:13:39] "Brother, I believe it. I've seen the
[1:13:42] Lord do too much that I couldn't dis
[1:13:45] it'd be impossible for me to disbelieve
[1:13:48] it." Amen. Praise Holy. The next morning
[1:13:52] we left riding in a little a little 125
[1:13:56] Kawasaki with a side car on it because I
[1:14:00] was the fat American. I was in the front
[1:14:02] seat of the little side car deal. When
[1:14:05] we went to church, there was seven of us
[1:14:08] on that
[1:14:09] thing. A brother was driving. Another
[1:14:12] brother was sitting on the seat. A third
[1:14:15] brother was sitting on the license on
[1:14:17] the uh tail light and license plate
[1:14:20] bracket holding on. I was in the front
[1:14:23] seat of the little side car. My
[1:14:26] interpreter, little old bitty brother
[1:14:28] and another brother was sitting behind
[1:14:30] me in the side car and the seventh man
[1:14:34] was hanging on the back of the side car
[1:14:36] until we started to climb a hill. Then
[1:14:38] he'd try to pop a wheelie. So he'd get
[1:14:40] around on the front of it. we'd climb
[1:14:42] the hill, then he'd get back around the
[1:14:44] back of it.
[1:14:47] If there's a desire to go to church,
[1:14:50] we'll do no matter what that it takes.
[1:14:54] Amen.
[1:14:57] Well, I showed him my knife.
[1:15:01] The next morning we left
[1:15:04] out and uh we got up to Beak City where
[1:15:10] we was catching a ferry that you ride
[1:15:12] the ferry boat about 30 mile over to
[1:15:16] Eloh of the major islands uh Negros and
[1:15:21] and
[1:15:22] Pani and I'm
[1:15:28] sorry I was just waiting on the fairy.
[1:15:32] And again, I inherit it from
[1:15:38] dad. Trimming fingernails with a pocketk
[1:15:41] knife. You know, I stuck my hand in my
[1:15:44] pocket. My knife wasn't there. I
[1:15:46] thought, well, I put it in my bag. I I
[1:15:48] had a a cloth bag with a a shoulder
[1:15:51] strap on it. And you can hang off the
[1:15:53] back of a jeep with that thing slung
[1:15:55] across your shoulder.
[1:15:59] I thought, well, I put it in my
[1:16:02] bag. But that evening when I went
[1:16:04] through my bag, my knife wasn't
[1:16:09] there. I uh I come home, I give a
[1:16:13] missionary report to the church, and I
[1:16:17] said, "I don't have that
[1:16:19] knife." I said, "But the Lord restored
[1:16:22] that knife to me once and he can do it
[1:16:24] again." Amen.
[1:16:30] About three weeks later, my interpreter
[1:16:33] got a letter from Brother Nollie. He
[1:16:36] said, "When Brother Farmer was here, he
[1:16:38] was preaching, one day we may have a
[1:16:41] sign that I've been here, but don't look
[1:16:44] for me. I'll be gone." I was talking
[1:16:46] about the
[1:16:48] rapture. He said, "I have a sign that he
[1:16:51] has been here." a mile and a half up the
[1:16:55] road from his house. It had fell out of
[1:16:58] my pocket. But if I had not showed him
[1:17:01] the broke blade,
[1:17:05] can I take you back to teaching on Moses
[1:17:08] that brother Brandham preached on
[1:17:10] Mother's Day one Sunday morning? You
[1:17:13] remember he was talking about little
[1:17:15] baby Moses that they had to put him in a
[1:17:18] reed basket and send him on down the
[1:17:20] river. He said, "If you keep it, you're
[1:17:23] gonna lose it. But if you lose it, you
[1:17:27] can keep it." I find in Revelation the
[1:17:31] 12th chapter that there's a recipe for
[1:17:35] us.
[1:17:36] It says they overcame.
[1:17:40] Praise the Lord. By the blood of the
[1:17:42] lamb and the word of their testimony.
[1:17:49] Amen.
[1:17:51] Now, I don't cook very
[1:17:55] much, but I've watched my mama and my
[1:17:58] wife make
[1:17:59] gravy. And you know what they'll do?
[1:18:02] They'll take them sausage trimmings and
[1:18:04] a little bit of grease
[1:18:08] and and she'll pour milk in there and go
[1:18:11] to stirring
[1:18:13] it. You know what I'm saying? And then
[1:18:16] they'll sift in some flour.
[1:18:20] And you know what it
[1:18:22] makes? Makes pretty good
[1:18:25] gravy. But what happens if you leave out
[1:18:28] just one ingredient like the flour?
[1:18:31] You're going to wind up with hot, greasy
[1:18:33] milk.
[1:18:36] It ain't going to make what is intended
[1:18:38] to. Right,
[1:18:40] church, if we want to overcome.
[1:18:46] Tell somebody
[1:18:48] about the overcoming power that's in you
[1:18:52] and be a witness of it.
[1:18:56] Can I share another scripture? I I'm not
[1:18:58] going to hold you real long tonight.
[1:19:12] That's how we overcome.
[1:19:17] If you keep
[1:19:18] it, if I have kept that testimony that
[1:19:22] night to
[1:19:25] myself, I would not have this with me.
[1:19:29] Wow. 20 years later.
[1:19:35] If we will
[1:19:37] tell what God has done for us.
[1:19:45] If we will
[1:19:47] tell, it'll cause
[1:19:51] others. Ye are the salt of the earth.
[1:19:56] Amen. On that gravy, you're going to
[1:19:58] have to have some salt in there, too.
[1:20:00] Y'all know that.
[1:20:05] What will this earth
[1:20:07] be if the salt loses it savior? See, God
[1:20:12] has a plan.
[1:20:15] God has a plan for Christian birth.
[1:20:19] I don't know how much longer we got to
[1:20:21] carry it out. I don't know of anything
[1:20:25] else that needs to happen.
[1:20:32] I don't know of anything that's missing
[1:20:34] that needs to happen before I I take a
[1:20:38] physical rapture out of here. And hey,
[1:20:41] if y'all see this a little bit different
[1:20:43] than me, uh just uh forgive me, but I
[1:20:47] believe that if we're not caught up if
[1:20:50] in the word of
[1:20:52] God and the spirit of Almighty God,
[1:20:56] Amen. If we are not raptured into that,
[1:20:59] you won't take a physical rapture.
[1:21:04] If we're not caught up in the revelation
[1:21:06] of God's word for our day, don't expect
[1:21:10] to get raptured out of the earth. Yes,
[1:21:14] sir. Because we've
[1:21:17] he said there was three things that he
[1:21:19] did as he descended. That was the shout,
[1:21:22] which was the message. Amen. The voice
[1:21:26] of the resurrection.
[1:21:30] Amen.
[1:21:33] When we
[1:21:35] heard this
[1:21:37] message and we left the other things
[1:21:46] because it and recognize that it was
[1:21:48] eagle food and we left the other things.
[1:21:53] Amen.
[1:21:57] The voice of the resurrection is what
[1:22:00] has resurrected you and I out of that
[1:22:04] darkness that translated us.
[1:22:07] It transferred us from that into a
[1:22:11] higher plane. Why? But be- because we're
[1:22:15] we're just more capable to get up to a
[1:22:18] higher step. No, no, no. You could hire
[1:22:20] a crane and get that high.
[1:22:26] But there's a desire in our heart to be
[1:22:29] operating on a higher level with the
[1:22:32] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:22:41] I was telling brother
[1:22:45] Kevin. Sure, it was a
[1:22:49] testimony, but we was in a meeting here
[1:22:51] several years ago out in uh Espanolia,
[1:22:56] New Mexico, out with brother Emanuel
[1:22:58] Salazar, uh uh brother
[1:23:09] uh up in Ohio.
[1:23:14] Boy, it's tough getting old.
[1:23:19] Brother Wayne
[1:23:21] Lawson was uh had one of the nights
[1:23:24] preaching out there. And here right
[1:23:26] about the end of the service, he went to
[1:23:29] skipping across the platform hollering,
[1:23:32] "I'm going in the rapture. I'm going in
[1:23:34] the rapture." And you maybe you've been
[1:23:37] in the ocean where you get out about
[1:23:39] chest deep in the water and a wave comes
[1:23:42] and it'll just lift you up off the sand.
[1:23:45] just bounce you. You know what I'm
[1:23:47] talking about. That is what it felt
[1:23:49] like.
[1:23:51] And there was a sister there that she
[1:23:53] thought she is going in the rapture
[1:23:56] right then turned around to grab a
[1:23:58] little seven or eight year old boy
[1:24:00] because she thought she is leaving and
[1:24:02] she didn't want to leave her baby
[1:24:04] behind.
[1:24:06] I was here with the Lord, but I'm
[1:24:09] looking for here.
[1:24:11] Amen.
[1:24:13] Church, if it's being greedy because I
[1:24:16] just want a a higher realm when the Lord
[1:24:21] called me greedy then. But I want more
[1:24:24] of him and more of him because I know
[1:24:28] that the more of him that I get, the
[1:24:33] less of me That's right. that there'll
[1:24:36] be. Amen. Amen.
[1:24:39] God bless y'all. I I I didn't even get
[1:24:43] into the quotes that I had.
[1:24:49] But church, God had a plan. Amenise
[1:24:54] for you and I. The prophet of God said
[1:24:58] that he that the enemy could not take
[1:25:01] him until he had completed what God
[1:25:05] ordained him to do. Amen.
[1:25:10] And it's the same way for all of us.
[1:25:14] What God has ordained for us to
[1:25:19] do, there's no political party that's
[1:25:22] going to stop
[1:25:23] it. There's no Roman Catholic Church
[1:25:27] that's going to prevent it.
[1:25:32] People says, "Oh my, brother Farmer, you
[1:25:34] know what? I got scared when when I
[1:25:36] heard that there's a a pope from America
[1:25:39] got voted in. My goodness, that's about
[1:25:42] a 65 year old prophecy.
[1:25:48] It wasn't nothing to get scared of. It's
[1:25:52] I It's just another piece that's that's
[1:25:55] fell into its place that it was already
[1:25:58] in God's mind and a prophet just told us
[1:26:01] that it was fixing to take place. Amen.
[1:26:05] Did he know what year it was going to
[1:26:06] be? I don't
[1:26:11] know. John the Baptist, let him come up
[1:26:14] to the music or I ain't going to
[1:26:17] quit. John the Baptist probably did not
[1:26:20] know what it was all about because when
[1:26:23] the Lord Jesus come to him and said,
[1:26:25] "John, uh uh uh I I'm here to be
[1:26:28] baptized." And he said, "Oh, no." He
[1:26:31] said, "I have needs to be baptized of
[1:26:34] thee."
[1:26:38] And the Lord Jesus just told
[1:26:41] him, "It's
[1:26:44] becoming. It's fitting." Brother
[1:26:49] John. It is proper. Right?
[1:26:54] He may not have had a revelation that
[1:26:56] the lamb had to be washed before the the
[1:26:58] time of its sacrifice,
[1:27:02] but at the Lord's
[1:27:04] word, he just obediently did it. Lord,
[1:27:08] let me be that same way. What where I'm
[1:27:12] lacking in
[1:27:14] revelation, Lord, help me.
[1:27:20] But whether I understand it or not, I
[1:27:24] believe it.
[1:27:26] It It just rings right.
[1:27:30] You know what I'm
[1:27:32] saying? I appreciate these brothers
[1:27:34] letting me play with them here a little
[1:27:36] bit
[1:27:37] tonight. But you know, have you ever
[1:27:40] played with somebody that was out of
[1:27:41] tune? Boy, we know what uncertain sound
[1:27:45] is when you get into
[1:27:48] that. But you know, there's something
[1:27:51] about when it's in
[1:27:55] tune. I can't even tune my
[1:27:58] [Music]
[1:28:00] guitar while brother Kevin's
[1:28:04] playing. You know why?
[1:28:07] because my guitar will pick up when he's
[1:28:11] playing an E note. It'll make an E
[1:28:14] string on my guitar start to
[1:28:18] ring. It'll make it start
[1:28:21] vibrating and I can't even read the
[1:28:26] tuner. What would it be though if we got
[1:28:28] in perfect
[1:28:30] pitch with the King of Kings?
[1:28:34] Oh, that just when the power of God goes
[1:28:37] to vibrating around us that it sets us
[1:28:42] at that same
[1:28:43] [Music]
[1:28:45] pitch that we rejoice with
[1:28:48] him in
[1:28:53] spirit. What y'all sing?
[1:29:00] [Music]
[1:29:04] Oh, spread your
[1:29:06] [Music]
[1:29:07] wings, little
[1:29:11] eagle, and
[1:29:17] fly. You weren't
[1:29:19] born for the
[1:29:23] valley. You were
[1:29:25] born for the sky.
[1:29:30] Don't let your
[1:29:32] trials get you
[1:29:35] down or drive your
[1:29:38] spirit to the
[1:29:41] ground. Mount up with
[1:29:46] wings. Little
[1:29:47] [Music]
[1:29:49] eagle fly.
[1:29:53] You all remember the prophet of
[1:29:56] [Music]
[1:29:57] God talking about when he was out there
[1:30:00] at Kremlin, Colorado
[1:30:02] hunting and about how oh was that bird
[1:30:06] really an eagle? Oh yeah, it was an
[1:30:08] eagle but the
[1:30:12] storm we we get into some storms, don't
[1:30:16] we? Had driven it down. It was still an
[1:30:21] eagle, but that's not really where he
[1:30:25] belonged. And you know, he he said that
[1:30:28] little old squirrel was just raising
[1:30:30] cane down there, just chatter, chatter,
[1:30:33] chatter, and said pretty soon he had
[1:30:36] enough of it. He just stretched them
[1:30:37] wings a little
[1:30:39] bit. Didn't take a whole lot of
[1:30:42] flopping, sister week.
[1:30:45] [Music]
[1:30:46] and just said
[1:30:48] it and he was gone. That's what we're
[1:30:52] fixing to do here in a few days.
[1:30:57] Amen. You weren't
[1:30:59] born for the
[1:31:03] valley. You was
[1:31:05] born for the sky.
[1:31:09] Don't let your
[1:31:12] trials get you
[1:31:15] down or drive your spirit to the
[1:31:22] [Music]
[1:31:25] ground. Little
[1:31:28] eagle and fly. Can we stand and sing it
[1:31:31] now? Oh, so spread your wings.
[1:31:38] Little
[1:31:40] le and
[1:31:45] fly. Oh, you weren't
[1:31:49] born for the
[1:31:52] valley, but you were
[1:31:55] born to soar the sky.
[1:31:59] Don't let your
[1:32:02] trials bring you
[1:32:05] down or drive your spirit into the
[1:32:10] ground. Just mount up with
[1:32:15] wings. Little league, go and fly one
[1:32:21] more time.
[1:32:23] Go spread your
[1:32:27] wings
[1:32:30] little and
[1:32:35] fly. Oh, you weren't
