thought about it um rayanna may know this song her grandmother wrote the song and uh I just I just have heard so much news lately about everybody talking about uniting you know and all the political aspects of it but I'm so glad you know the prophet of God talked about uniting way long ago and of course Satan tries to mimic everything that God has but I just I just love this song that dilia wrote so I'll just I indict this gy generation said the prophet of the age for the second crucifixion they turned the Lord away but there's a group of people who are chosen of the Lord and while the world is indied the bride is united united to the world of God there's a union going on between the bride and the groom invisible the world just cannot [Music] see it's over and they know it not a mystery and a paradox the bride is United the world is United she United with the word of God it is a uniting sign and time we know it's all fulfilled this day it is I got that start over it is the uniting sign and time this day it is fulfilled for we all know that a greater one than Solomon is here we're looking onto Jesus and the tokens been applied and while the world is indied the bright is united

amen for we're here not by our own faithfulness that's for sure amen but God is faithful and true to his word and we're so thankful for that amen the musicians can be dismissed it's uh good to see everyone this evening and uh good to have U Branson and anen back with us amen and um um made it home safe sounds like the Lord just kept his hands up on them and think they were said they were just inches uh from t-boning uh a lady that run out in front of them and so God was certainly faithful to them and merciful so we thank the Lord for that and uh good to have brother Amos Sister Lisa back with us and the um um heard they had good meeting and service so we're thankful for that as well and brother Andrew asked me to greet you all um as Daniel said he's preaching in Arkansas for brother Jason Jackson tonight and so um anyways we certainly appreciate brother Andrew Sister Mariah and and appreciate them um all that they're doing for the bride of Christ amen if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the Book of Joshua the 14th chapter amen Book of Joshua the 14th chapter and um there's a brother that uh there in Ohio has made these little pins uh of the cloud and uh he's given uh quite a bit of them to me and um if any of you would want want one uh just let me know and uh give you some or give you one that you could wear or whatever but I think it's kind of neat but u u so if you want one you can have one praise the Lord uh before we go into the word uh the Lord may we just bow our heads and just talk to the Lord father yes Jesus truly your faithfulness is beyond comprehension but Lord we truly recognize father if it hadn't been for you on our side and being constant consistent in your plan and your promise Lord we wouldn't be here today if father father because of your faithfulness Lord we can rest and be assured Lord that we will make it we will go through we will Lord overcome father we thank you that we can rest in you father I pray Lord that you would just be with us this evening bless what words we would have to say and pray that you would help me to yield myself to you lord lord I pray that you would bless every Minister that's preaching this message Lord this evening father to whatever people that they're preaching to anoint them in a special way father we just give this service into your hands now in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen amen and amen we've been reading this uh scripture for a little while but um I want to look at it again so Joshua uh 14 and we'll start at the 7th verse Caleb speaking here 40 years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from cadesh Baria to spy out the land and I brought him word again as it was in Mine Heart nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt but I wholly follow the Lord my God and Moses swear on that day saying surely the land where on thy feet have trotten shall be thine inheritance and thy children's forever because the Lord H or because thou Hast holy follow the Lord my God and now behold the Lord hath kept me alive as he said these 40 and five years even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo I am this day 40 or four score and 5 years old as yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me and my as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war both to go out and to come in now therefore give me this mountain whereof the Lord spake in that day for thou heardest in that day how the Anakin were there and that the cities were great and fenced if so be the Lord will be with me then I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said then uh Romans the 10th chapter Romans 10 amen and um we'll start at the eth verse but what saith it the word is n the even in thine mouth and in thine heart that is the word of faith which we preach amen amen do you love him amen amen you can have your seats this evening and we know that Caleb was a type of the believer um today who is following the end time message of God the prophet to us that so uh Caleb types no other person uh except those that are following this in time message Lord and um so you don't have to be a Baptist you don't have to be Pentecostal you don't have to be anything just follow the message of the hour and you have your type and that is Caleb and Caleb uh and Joshua res resisted the LIE of the 10 spies uh that they had told the people where you know that we cannot take the land we are as as grasshoppers in the sight of those Giants and and um and and and such and so basically what what these 10 spies done is they refuted the message of the hour and uh they they um and they caused the people's hearts to melt and and so because the uh the people were not really persuaded in the message uh of of the hour uh then they they listened and um to to what the the spies had said and they believed it they they actually believed it and the spies them 10 men were able to turn the hearts of the people and and uh against the the message of the hour and and uh because they listen to the negative report and and and so the Bible calls it an evil report these 10 men gave an evil report anything against the message anything against the promises of God is an evil report and uh I I don't care what it is it's it's an evil report and and you don't we don't want to be one of those that give an evil report is say well you know I I'm not going to make it and I'm not this and I'm not going to do this or I can't and I'm not whatever I'm not worthy you're given an evil report uh because if there's nothing negative in the message there's nothing negative in the Bible in in the gospel in Christianity it's it's all positive ain't that right and so uh uh then you know the so they they gave this evil report and and the people believed it which only confirmed what was in them already and that was what Paul would call an evil heart of unbelief they had this uh evil heart and so as we know that God always allows us to hear two reports uh always and uh you you you will hear you know that that what God has to say and then you'll hear what maybe the doctor has to say or what the banker has to say or what Mom and Dad or uh uh and then a lot of times even what preacher has to say or denominations or whatever but but you'll always hear uh uh both sides you'll hear the positive report you'll hear hear the negative report and and we know that Satan has His prophets um which only speak uh negative uh that that's that's what they are and uh uh they speak contrary to the word of God and they are influenced by demons uh demonic spirits uh that come from The Unseen World now many many people may not believe uh in in that there is an Unseen World and that there is a a spiritual uh spirits that are float you know or I say floating around they're they're they're everywhere they present is just in an unseen Rim that we would call dimensions and and so uh there's it's an Unseen World of demons and and and also the angels of God and all people as we're taught by the message are influenced by either one brother brandham used a uh uh he he drew a line and you know uh um and he drew this line on on the billboard I'm Reckoning and and he says in that line is is Humanity that's the Mortal being uh and they're all living in that line and and above the line is is is angels of God in an unseen rim and below that line is is a demonic Powers uh uh uh in in that unseen rim and so he said and all people within that line are influenced uh either from above from The Unseen World above or the Unseen World beneath uh there and and and so now Demons of course they are fallen angels and they are at the command of God uh they are the ones who cause people to become sick uh they are the the ones that they cause blindness and and diseases and and uh uh deafness lame um uh things like that they they cause people to become depressed and and uh nervous um many many times if you just study that uh in the prayer line brother brandom constantly talking about people with nervous problems and he said it's a demon that that's that's what it is it's Satan that has caused uh the these things uh uh uh cancer it it's it's from demons and and and things like that but these demons also cause people to disbelieve the word of God and and brother brandom said Satan and his demons anoints Humanity to disbelieve the word of God so so always watch the anointing and what kind what you what is anointing you uh uh to speak ain't that right we could say that these 10 spies were anointed they were anointed of Satan his demons and and and because the people listened to what they had to say they became Anointed with that same spirit and and uh uh Anointed with unbelief and so then the angels of God that are above that line are are at God's command and uh the Bible says that these angels are encamped about those who fear the lord and and that is so true uh angels are with you and they they encourage us along the way they Inspire us they they they build our faith they they get us to believe and and uh they drive back demon power from us and they keep us from harm and and from Evil and but but it's an Unseen World that is really real and and so uh uh we we know these things and but brother brandom said you know in that line uh is is darkness and gy and and sin and muck and and it's just black U because it it's coming from an the the the Unseen World from beneath but he said every once in a while you'll see a white dot in that line just a a white dot and he says what that that is that's that's born again Christians within that line and and they are not of the darkness even though they're in the darkness but they they're shining a light can you say amen and so that that's Christians them little lights uh is a Christian and their influence comes from uh above a ain't that right and so that's what you are in this world is is little lights uh if if you could see in in the spiritual realm it is this world is dark uh brother brandom even talked about it and he he draw that line of uh and he left just a little sliver uh in in there uh and and he did that when he saw it it was Plum Darkness but he left a little sliver to represent you and I as as lights in this world Amen but Satan's job is to get you to disbelieve God's word and and then if he succeeds in doing that then the word will become of no effect to you now think of that you can still set in a church you can still claim Christianity you can still but the word has no effect in your life see and so that's exactly what it was uh when Israel at Kadesh Baria they they chose to believe the evil report of these men that was anointed with a a DE demon of unbelief and and and and the word then become no effect to them amen and and even though they were still Israelites and but they wandered around in the wilderness um uh and and no doubt they probably heard about promises and because Caleb I guarantee you Caleb wasn't quite about it amen and and Joshua but at at the same time they they God had already told them you will not go in you you will not partake of the word of God in its fullness see and so brother Brandon would tell us we have to stop and and separate it uh uh we have to separate uh between what is Satan and what is God what the anointing that Satan is putting upon the people and the anointing that God is is putting upon the people what Satan is saying and what God is Satan or or saying and and and we've got to stop and separate amen don't don't just believe everything that you hear don't accept everything that comes along your your way uh first John 4:1 beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world ain't that right so so Kaleb representing us that are wholly following the message of the hour he refused to listen to the rhetoric of the unbeliever he just refused to give into it it it just it just wasn't there for he believed God's word and it was in his mouth it it it was there and the word never lost its Effectiveness to him it it never did uh uh you know years later he entered into the promised land and under the ministry of Joshua and and and that land was a land of rest do you believe that amen that's what brother Brown said it was a land of rest amen see out outside the land uh uh the children of Israel were just pilgrims and and strangers uh uh be you know brother said it because the land wasn't theirs amen see the land of Egypt wasn't Theirs to possess amen the land of the Wilderness wasn't THS to possess the land of Esau wasn't THS to possess uh and the land of Moab see it it wasn't their inheritance so they could not settle down and possess it it it wasn't a land of rest they had to keep moving they had to keep keep pressing ain't that right amen you know uh they they weren't able to settle down uh outside the land that God had given them others were settling down others were there enjoying it calling it home but they could not call it home they they could not because it wasn't their inheritance God told Israel that when you go through the land of of Esau don't don't mess with them don't fool around with them don't settle down with them you you know don't argue with them don't argue with Moab don't join up with them amen uh uh don't fuss with him see Israel were just passing through the land can you say Amen see and and and so it it was uh uh uh in the land of promise amen that's where their inheritance lay that's where the Word of Promise would take effect upon them and come into its full effect ain't that right so so and and and only in the land did the promises of God become a reality to them amen talking about it and being partakers of it is two different things talking about it talking about it talking about it but then there comes a time that they they would cross over into the land and partake of everything that God promised them see so now the prophet said Israel shouted and danced sure they had a great time but they found out they wandered for 40 years now in our wondering did you ever think of what they did out there in the wilderness did you ever think of what Israel done God blessed them sure uh uh see they had their Gardens their crops their married they married their wives they raised their children God blessed them and he's blessed the Pentecostal move and sure but remember that wasn't what God sent them out to live in the wilderness God never sent them to live in the wilderness yes they B blessed them and the all their Journey but they were not meant to to live in the land of Esau they were not meant to live in the land of Moab they they they weren't you know and so he says see they was just to pass through the Wilderness for they were on their road to the promised land can you say Amen they were on the road to the promised land and never as as far as I can read in scripture never do you find a Caleb a man trying to possess something outside of the land of inheritance amen never did he you find him in the land of Esau saying give me my Mountain I want this I got to have that no no that was Esau's to possess can you say amen amen and we must understand that amen God blesses people God blesses with with all kinds of things you say well how are they prospering and they're Sinners and they're and they're liars and they're this and they're that that may be their inheritance can you say Amen amen that's right see and so when a so when when a man crosses over into the land of promise see then what happens he doesn't live to possess Earthly things amen this world means nothing to him amen he's he's not out to possess Amen in the promise it was Caleb that wanted his inheritance can you say amen he wasn't looking out in the land saying man I was I could have that whatever Esau had and and I wish I could have this and I wish I could have had what Moab and him had bo if we could just if we could just act like a MOAB and and if we could just no no no no Caleb realized there was an inheritance in that land for him can you say amen amen see so so he he possesses in the land he possesses his inheritance and so that's what we read about of Caleb he had stood the test I believe God every promise is right we're more than able to overcome and because of his faith God brought him into that land of inheritance and everyone else the word would become non effect to them but everything that God promised would now become AFF Caleb and he realize that he's sitting there in the land of promise and now he wants to possess what is his ain't that right amen now you never find Caleb amen I believe Caleb knew what was his and what you know I I believe he knew he entered in that land knowing what was his he didn't go around and and wondering now what do I do now which one is mine well I think I want that and Ephraim says oh no you can't have that that's mine Joshua gave that to me really well you know and so he's wanting this and he wanting oh he knew exactly what God had given him ain't that right see and and so now we we read this last uh uh Wednesday to inherit something is to come into possession of or receive especially as a right or Divine portion see so then for you to have an inheritance God or someone has to leave you something and and and as we've been taught God did leave us something and when he left it he left it before the foundation of the world not when you come to the altar not when you decided and and and and all of a sudden you started acknowledging him he left you something before the foundation of the world and you don't have to work for it you don't have to beg for it it's yours because someone gave it to you can you say Amen now Caleb's inheritance was given by the word of the Lord amen that's right wasn't no denomination or anything like that see amen and and and therefore he knew it had to be sure because God had promised it it come from the the the mouth of a prophet amen therefore he was so confident in it that he laid claim to it laid claim he knew it was given to him ain't that right now we can we can relate Amen to this uh uh those of us um who are really truly following the message of the hour and I I believe all of us are amen but we can relate to Caleb's desire to possess what was given to him because we have been given an inheritance as well ain't that right amen look Believers and and I just what what the prophet or what the Bible says Believers are ordained to eternal life when was you ordained before the foundation of the world God left you eternal life do you believe that amen Believers are predestinated they're called they're just ified and they're already glorified when before the foundation of the world God left you something back then amen we're predestinated to the adoption of sons how many believes that we're predestinated God left us this as an inheritance for us our inheritance was predestinated to us as Paul would tell us and we were predestinated to obtain our inheritance yes sir you see we were predestinated to become to be conformed to the To His Image amen not only that but an eternal city has been prepared for us do you believe that amen remember there's a city that is coming down amen but there's also a people that's ordained to live in that City amen that is your inheritance before the foundation of the world the changing of our body amen from corruption to incorruption was left us before the foundation of the world the sons of God ruling and reigning amen not only in this life but in the life to come in this life our Dominion is a dominion over sin a ain't that right amen you don't have to wait till the next life you can Reign now and so is the believer reigning now over over sin amen but see something has been left us people don't believe in that predestination amen where you know how do you understand your inheritance amen your inheritance has been secure because God left it to you not what you done not what you will do but God by Grace left you an inheritance do you believe that see so so if you notice the promised land of the Old Testament represented the holy spirit amen now how do we know that we have an inheritance well and and Ephesians 1:13-14 it uh you know it it Paul would tell us that the Holy Ghost is the earnest everybody say the earnest it's the earnest or down payment of our inheritance until the Redemption uh of the purchased possession amen so that's what the Holy Ghost is when you you come into a land it is your down payment you that's what when you receive the Holy Ghost it's a down payment and and and the word down payment is a pledge that the full amount will be paid amen The Pledge that the full amount will be paid you see when God gave you the Holy Ghost he is so serious about you that he says I'm going to give it to you as a guarantee that you're going to make it amen I now God already knows you're going to make it but he gave you a guarantee he gave the world a guarantee that you brother Matthew are going to make it it's a down payment of your inheritance of your full inheritance can you sayen see so when God filled you with the Holy Ghost he confirmed to you that you have an inheritance you have an inh glad you got an inheritance amen we you think the Holy Ghost was uh make us feel good and got you know uh uh chill bumps and and shouted and got emotional amen but but brother BR is it all you know that power went all out the Smoke Stack you know because people didn't know what they had amen but we're beginning to understand that the holy goals is a confirmation to us that we do have an inheritance yes sir we got an inheritance brother BR said the holy spirit is the assurance that we have been received into Christ Christ the land of promise you believe Christ is that Land Of Promise Christ well Paul says here in 2 Corinthians 1:20 all the promises of God in him in that land are yay and amen amen that's right now now brother Brown says people outside the land knows nothing about what's in the land amen but when you're in that land you know what it's all about every promise is a guarantee to you ain't that right it's yay and amen in him amen see so brother Brandon goes on it is the Blessed hope and assurance that we do have have eternal life and are HS of everything that he purchased for us see so we have been baptized into Christ one body ain't that right by a spiritual baptism yes sir the Holy Ghost so brother brandom says see we we have the earnest now of our complete everybody say complete complete inheritance your inheritance is is the Eternal things your inheritance is the supernatural things your inheritance isn't a truck you know you you say well I received an inheritance from a natural family and all that but do you realize the inheritance that God gave you is far greater than a natural inheritance Moses was able Moses was supposed to inherit the throne but brother brandom says The Inheritance that he had inside of him was greater than the natural inheritance think of it he was supposed to inherit a a superworld a superpower he was going to inherit a a a throne that he could sit on and rule the world Amen but yet that inheritance in him was greater than that amen and God's The Inheritance that God has given you is so far greater than a mansion it's so far greater than the all the wealth of the world it's so far greater than the Hun new hunting bow you know that you could have it it's so far greater than than the the biggest buck that you can hang on your wall amen it's so far greater than all the riches you understand what I'm saying amen it it it it's an inheritance that God has given you amen see now he says see we have the earnest now the down payment of our complete everybody say complete again inheritance because God has already he pulled loose the grounded roots from the things of the world and has planted us on Higher Grounds see Lifted Me Out transformed me from the things of the world took out roots branches everything uh the things of the world see and lifted me up out of the my re clay out of the old muck of sin and planted me on top of Zion's Hill setting in the orchard of the Beloved saints of God and now we are citizens of that Kingdom brother and Sisters in Christ Jesus all filth and gum and nastiness has gone from our minds aren't you glad for that amen that you're living in a world of filthiness of perversion but God has so done something to you that that's gone out of your mind you can be tempted sure amen but it's gone it's not attaching itself to you because that's not your inheritance he said our B are washed with pure water and our hearts are sprinkled by the blood of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit is abiding with his Breeze blowing through our branches all day long shoving us pushing us making us take good roots and grow down deep that the earnest of our in Salvation ain't that right so what is the Holy Ghost it's the earnest of our uh uh inheritance the down payment it's also a seal it it it it also signifies a finished work a security ain't that right so it's telling you you can never be lost you can't be lost can you say amen amen and and and so brother Bram said see a seal means that it is a finished thing with God it's already settled and every believer was sealed with this promise from the very beginning because before the foundation of the world we were predestinated unto the adoption of sons aren't you glad for that see God knew that you were coming he knew that amen then he gives you his seal see so so God claims you a man uh shows a claim upon you when he fills you with the Holy Ghost brother brah said see when this new eternal life dwells in you it is the potential or the earnest of you being quickened from Mortal to immortality we're talking about our inheritance right amen see a full inheritance amen this is why we shout this is why we're excited this is why when tribulation is setting in we know there's a we that ain't our future we've got an inheritance and even though death and Corruption is setting in this body and it may we may go by the way of the Grave which I just don't think we will amen I mean I believe there's people that are alive on the Earth today that will never taste death that's just how I feel about it we we are that close to the coming of the Lord but if we were to go by the way of a grave there is a down payment in our soul amen that will Quicken this old body and raise us up into immortality yes sir so he says see he said Quicken from Mortal to immortality let me say that again when this Spirit has found you the individual and has come upon you it is the potential of your Eternal inheritance that God thought of you and made for you before the foundation of the world and that is your potential aren't you glad for that amen so what is the Holy Ghost today amen it's the Easter seal you go listen to the uh uh the Easter seal uh listen to rising of the sun listen to them messages uh but he tells us it's the Easter seal it's the Dynamics everybody say Dynamics it's putting you in a a position amen see and and so what is that it's proof that you are risen with Christ and that you are a new creature and the word has been quickened to you oh aren't you glad for that it's been quickened to you it is the earnest of your inheritance brother Brown said we have the evidence that God Lives we have the evidence that God is with us we have the evidence that God has not forsaken us and that we are his and he is ours see and so then we have the Holy Spirit within us crying out Abba Father oh aren't you glad for that see so and there's nothing that can ever take that away from us brother Brown said the trees don't have it the the flowers do not have it nature does not have it we're the one that has it amen all nature doesn't have it but we have the earnest of our inheritance now notice yet we're still groaning we're still groaning with them we're groaning with the trees we're groaning with all nature because we have not yet received the fullness everybody say the fullness of our adoption we've not received the fullness of our adoption amen see amen uh uh now you know I I know brother brandom says that he he says this when a man receives the Holy Spirit then his time of groaning is over because it is a finished work and that is so true amen but see we're not wandering if we have an inheritance we know we've got it amen it's it's it's been given to us we've we we we've got that Assurance we we know we're saved we know amen that there's the devil cannot get to our soul we we know that whatever trial we go through whatever things he puts upon us we're going to make it do you believe that we we know that we have an inheritance and and that inheritance is an eternal inheritance we're not looking out in the world uh for our inheritance we're not looking in church denomination for our inheritance we're not we're not looking for things we're not looking at the politicians to give us our inheritance can you say amen amen that's right see we're not looking for a messiah to give us our inheritance we are in the land of rest we've come into the land of rest do you believe that the land of adoption but yet we will still not groan stop groaning until we've come to our full adoption we're not groaning to be a Christian we're not groaning amen for for these I hope you understand what I'm saying in other words see uh we we know that we're going to make it we're secure in that amen we're at rest it's a land of rest how many's in that land of rest amen I I know that Satan ain't going to take me out I know that I'm going to make it into a Rapture I know I know what my inheritance is so I'm at rest but there's something in me that ain't going to settle amen just for a little experience I want everything that God's got for me that's right I thank God for what he's done for me so far but I know there's more give me my Mountain give me my inher in heritance see so now we're coming in there there's a fullness of our adoption so brother BR says see now we have the earnest our Spirits groaning for the full adoption but now we have the earnest of it as we receive the Holy Spirit it is the earnest of our complete adoption or complete salvation prise the Lord oh how beautiful I just love that all right we are waiting for the fullness of adoption this will take place when at the first resurrection that's when our bodies will be changed from these vile creatures that we are and we'll have a body like his own glorious body for we shall see him as he is and we will be like him when he appears we appear in his likeness oh do you believe that see so we're not saying well I believe in healing but I don't know if I'm going to make it in Rapture brother and sister all of it's yours healing is your inheritance salvation is your inheritance Deliverance is your inheritance everything that God died for is your inheritance how in the world would to give you the Holy Ghost and seal you with that and then leave you out of of a city amen without hands made without hands amen whose Builder and maker is God how would he leave you amen give you a portion of it and not give you the rest can you say Amen praise the Lord see so he says we will have a body like his a glorious glorified body and all the trials and struggles of life will fade off into a little mist and blow away to never be no more see and these Earthly Tabernacles which we grown in now we're waiting for the ear that earnesty for the Salvation fully in its fullness to come see so another place this is the ending up of the time time will be no more one of these days they keep prophesying about a great future in this world I'm telling you that's not your inheritance politics is not your inheritance this government is not your inheritance all right City set up on the hill I was listening to one of the the speakers last night at the RNC you know convention and talked about you know we're coming to a city upon a hill talking about America like oh my goodness you know that's fine if that's what their inheritance is but it's a false thing God promised a city can you say Amen the time will be no more one of these days we come see we we we we come out of Eternity stepped into a little time space here and stepped out of time back into eternity we was before there was a world then we came into the world and we go out of the world back into the unknown to us now see now in here he says you know in in here this little time we've had our savior come here to Earth to the Earth God himself made himself manifested to us give us the hope of the everlasting life eternal life and also in there he promised us joy happiness contentment that's your inheritance right yes sir that's that's that you got the down payment of your inheritance hello Church yes sir see think of it when you're going to that place when you when this is all over with we come back to a new Heaven A New Earth Satan's destroyed everything's going to be sin will be obliviated it bought no more to be remembered diseases sickness frailties weakness tempt nothing like that it'll be all an eternal Joy Eternal peace Eternal contentment but you've got a down payment now that you can enjoy Eternal peace Eternal Eternal Joy Eternal contentment can you say Amen you've got that down payment even though you go through the trials there is a joy amen even though you fall there is a mercy there is something that picks you up amen there's a praise there's a worship amen but one of these days you're going to come to the fullness of that amen where there will be no sin no trial nothing no failure you'll not be known as you are known this old life can you say Amen such as the the down payment and the power of that that God don't even look at you as a sinner no more amen so he said he promises joy happiness contentment which is the earnest of our Salvation that we have now as a golden inheritance the Lord he said the little touch that we have he said when I walk up there to that screen a while ago and they were screaming praising God and the Holy Spirit falling tears rolling down the cheeks when he was saying oh hell the power of Jesus name when I stood this morning I heard that little duet this morning sing that beautiful hymn I suppose they sung it again this evening he says and the Christians there them old veterans that was beaten in war and the tears rolling down their cheeks what was it it was the earnest of their inheritance amen when we feel the presence of God Amen down in our soul when something is pulsating within us that's the earnest of our inheritance can you imagine the time that you come there and that'll be so pulsating within you it it'll be such a glorious time that you don't have to deal with time anymore oh my we we have times of just Worship in on the Earth in our services and and you just bask it in the presence of God that's the earnest of your salvation but we're coming to the fullness of these things now again what is the Holy Spirit Holy Ghost today is the token life amen yes the Holy Ghost today is the token life the land we're talking about see it's it's the quickening power of God and and what is it doing it is quickening us our mortal bodies to the word of God in other words the word is becoming flesh in your flesh the word now taking on flesh yes aren't you glad for that amen see now now Caleb when he come into the Land There was a natural mountain and he possessed it amen and he lived there but the mountain that we're taking the things that we're the word is taking on flesh amen amen that's right can you say Amen the word is taking on fleshy which is Jesus Christ impersonated in his church amen this so flesh is becoming Quicken to the word you believe that what is it it's the son of man revealed amen see so the church has come through the land of justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost in This last days but it was not to settle down there it was to keep moving on moving on you believe that yes sir had to keep on moving the Lutheran settled down the Wesleyan settled down the the Pentecostals settled down and and all these things brother Bram said each one of those ages had a dip of the Holy Ghost of the Holy Spirit but what is it they didn't go all the way into it if if if Luther would have kept on moving he would have been Wesley yeah if Wesley would have kept on moving it would been Pentecostals and if the Pentecostals would have kept on moving that'd be what we are today they would have come into the land yeah amen can you say amen that's right see the true church of today what is the true church of today not a Pentecostal age the true church of today is in the promised land possessing their inheritance people that's not in that land you know they're looking at all the politics they're looking at everything that this world can give them and they're satisfied with that that's what they want that's what they're thriving on give me give me give me let me hear them promises but in those that are in the land they know the promise doesn't come from a politician the promise comes from God and it's not something materialistic it's something that is quickening them becoming part of them that's right can you say Amen yes sir the true church of today is in the promised land Church justification brother Brown said made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost notice now made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in Perfection back to the word again to manifest itself can you say Amen we we had to go through the land of justification we have to go through the land of sanctification we have to go through the land of Pentecost Amen to get where we are today that's right are you with me sir yes sir give me my Mountain Caleb didn't represent Luther right give me my Mountain he represent he wasn't a type of the methodists he wasn't a type of the Pentecostals and the baptism then I'm he's a type of you this last day bride that is following this end time message give me my Mountain believe now the 10 spies I believe they were a type of the Pentecostals of this last day oh yeah the Pentecostal age they went into the land and partook of the Holy Spirit see they went into the land they partook of the evidence of the land and they came back with an evil report right they partook of the land they saw the manifestation of God in this day they saw the ministry of Messiah of Christ they saw the Messiah sign hello and they called her the devil they partook of the Holy Ghost think about it but when the Holy Ghost himself came amen they rejected it ain't that right see so they went into the land partook of the Holy Spirit but did not come into its fullness yes sir now Hebrews 6:4 for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew themselves to renew them again unto repentance see uh uh seeing they crucified to themselves the Son of God aresh and put him to an open shame now notice what brother Brown says ye who have tasted the Heavenly gift tasted in other words you've seen it amen many people know that this message is the truth on now that's right they tasted see you've seen it you can't and then brother Braham smacks his lips together you can't just taste it with your mouth but you seen it and you knew it was the truth you know it was the truth tasted the Heavenly gift and made partakers of the Holy Spirit as it fell upon you speaking in tongues prophesying can you say Amen none not all of that was fake them were genuine things remember brother Ram goes to that meeting he never been into a Pentecostal meeting and and them two men one of them spoke in tongues the other one prophesied and was exactly right on word for word everything just right he thought man I've never seen this before he thought I come in the in the midst of angels and he and he and he said I got to meet these two men and and he shook he said he had that gift you know shook that one man's hand he said it was a genuine that man was a genuine believer and he thought oh wow that's incredible so he went and met that other man shook his hand he said if I ever met a devil that was one can you say Amen see and so see partakers of the Holy Spirit as a fell upon you tasted of the good word of God see taste it you seen it was right the Holy Ghost Fallen upon you the weed in the field and then turn away denying the very Christ that Sanctified you called you and put that anointing upon you there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin for that see it's imp paron unpardonable it's impossible for them to ever come to the knowledge of Truth think of that now it's impossible for them to ever come to the knowledge of the truth in other words the word being made open unto them see for it is impossible for those made who were made partakers of the Holy Spirit see it fell upon the weed started in with Jesus and saiding oh Lord I'm going through but when you hit that word you turn back see made partakers of the Holy Spirit even tasted or seen the word itself manifested and then turn away from it it's totally impossible for them to ever see it or come to it well that's exactly what happened to the 10 spies ain't that right they saw the word they knew the evidence of the land they knew it was right amen but the Giants their their evil heart of unbelief caused them to give an evil report and to turn from what Moses was saying and God says you'll never partake of it you'll never come into the fullness of it they can you say amen and God turned that Pentecostal shuck away and the Pentecostal Shu lays dead today but there is a people there is a Caleb there is a Young Generation that has come out of that and has entered into the promised land and what if they come to the fullness everybody say the fullness of the word fullness of the word that's why our hope is so real that's why we we we we I know I keep saying it but maybe it's just a critical time that's why we're not looking to politicians that's why we are not looking to government that's why we're not looking to all these things it does not matter to us we are in the land of inheritance God says I'm the god that Health thee I'm the god that provides all thy needs can you say Amen yes sir see so this is the day this is the day everybody say this is the day when the word has come to its full effect sir that's good that's why we're looking for a land Yonder that's why we are so you know so enthused and so excited and looking every day for the Rapture to come that's our inheritance we now are in the land praise the Lord I love it when Jesus walked the Earth the word had come to into full effect that day the scriptures were fulfilled concerning the Messiah Jesus said search the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life but they testify of me ain't that right the scriptures testified of him him him no longer was it a messiah coming he was the Messiah and every scripture was fulfilled in him and they turned it down turned it down and they died yeah can you say Amen see they turned it down now notice the prophet said the church was to go on to the full promise everybody say full promise they were to go on to the full promise it should be in her Splendor of Glory she should be waiting for the coming of the Lord instead of that she scattered everywhere wondering which is right looking for a politician to come and save her looking for this to come and save her no they should be in your spot looking for the coming of the Lord but they turn that word down but here we are we're not looking for the the the blessings of man we are looking to God for the Bible says when you see these things begin to happen lift up your head your Redemption draweth n what is it it's your full inheritance right amen it belongs to you the Rapture Belongs to You eternal life belongs to you the quickening power of God changing our vile body it belongs to us amen I hope I'm making little sense see she scattered everywhere wondering which is right is this right is that right I'll join this I'll go over here I'll go down there see next place he says and the first resurrection will come for forth for the bright age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism everyone that has turned it down they have they have followed right in the cycle of every age but not us there has come a resurrection for the first time out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power amen being waved over the People by the sign same signs and wonders that he did back there now listen church today we as a group of people and I'm not just talking about Faith Tabernacle I'm talking about Believers all around this world we are no longer passing through the land Hallelujah are you with me we're not just passing through the land there's no other Church ages left there's no time left left we have entered in the land of promise can you say Amen on not passing through the land we are in the land of inheritance and how did we get there by the message of the hour the Joshua Ministry has taken us over into the land of promise Lord now as we've said brother Brams talked about it how that land was it it was the second part part of redemption you read Exodus and that deals of e Egypt coming Israel coming out of Egypt that was the first part of redemption but Redemption has two parts it wouldn't be a full Redemption if if God left them in the wilderness I'm talking about the believer now that elect yeah that's right but Caleb showed that there would be a group of people come from the first first Exodus and enter first part of redemption but they would also go into the second part of redemption and that is when they entered into the land of promise their inheritance now in in in so it has two parts Redemption has two parts coming out and going into now in the message Paradox brother brandham spoke of the vision that he had of him standing on the map of Palestine and he says I I was coming to Down To The River Jordan he said he could hear the song being sung I'm going down to the Jordan and as he drew near to the Jordan River which Jordan means death and remember Israel had to cross in order to get into the promised land they had to cross the river of Jordan ain't that right see and and so as he drew near the Jordan River he said I look back from where I came from I looked back to where I had been and he said I realized I had come 2third of the way W which showing him that he had come already come from first and second pull and now he's looking at what was ahead and he says to himself he said oh praise God just on the other side is where all the promises lay every promise lays in the promised land can you say Amen promises in the third pool can you say amen and we know the third pool is the opening of the word yes sir the word had been shut up that's right but now it's time for the word to be open every promise in the book being revealed and we see our name in the book amen our inheritance Mage can you say Amen yes sir now brother brandham also showed or the Lord showed brother brandham that his ministry was Joshua Ministry remember he had been praying in a hand I believe or a Bible and a hand come down I don't know exactly how that went but if you you've studied it you know it but a hand come down the Bible opened before him and it fell upon Joshua and a hand came down and started uh uh showing him the scriptures as I was with Moses so shall I be with thee you know fear not be courageous you you know you know the and and brother Brown understood himself to be have that Joshua Ministry that would take the people over into the promised land Pentecostals had rejected it they had rejected the message they had rejected the promises hello yes sir they saw the Messiah sign didn't want nothing to do with it too afraid of the Giants afraid that's going to be kicked out and living under a bridge afraid they were going to lose their popul it afraid they're going to be called a fanatic all these things but Caleb didn't care he just knew he was going over God would take care of everything and I say to you don't fear for your life don't be afraid of your future don't be afraid of tomorrow don't be afraid of what the enemy can do oh church God will take care of you he's taking care of us now now Church Satan is trying his best to keep the message from getting to the hearts of the elect this message reveals what belongs to us amen it is positionally placing Us in the land can you say Amen yes sir have you ever noticed that when Caleb got into the land or when Israel got into the land of promise it was then that the enemy become a real reality to them the inheritance become a reality to them but the enemy become a reality to them the enemy was bigger than than they were they were they were on every side yeah right there was the old cities it it was real obstacles hello yes sir see the children of Israel they just didn't come in there and walk in there and it was just a breeze they had the enemy to deal with yes come on now have you ever noticed why demonic spirits are manifesting themselves more today than ever before that's right that's true you're dealing with enemy that is far greater than any other age true yes you've come into your land yes and the enemy not only is the promises now I don't know about you but if you if you were in a in a denomination or just a church outside the message and all that I guarantee you and well I know you didn't have no understanding of this Bible but when God LED you to the message and not only just LED you to the message but through the message of the hour began to open up the promises to you this Bible become a new book that's right brother bradam said it become a new book to him why because things began to unfold this book become revealed it wasn't a book of History it was a book of today and and the Bible says that when the lamb come down with that open book John looked upon that book and he shouted and he danced and he and he and he glorified God you all know the story there in Revelations 5 and brother BR says because John must have seen his name something was revealed to him so the inheritance our inheritance now has been revealed to us and it's becoming more and more clear and and every promise is becoming personal it's not just the Lord is coming he's coming for me it's not just the Rapture is coming I'm coming in that rapt can you say man it's becoming personal but as the promises are becoming more real to us the enem is becoming more real that's right this isn't you know I mean Satan ain't just a figment of your imagination it's real amen that's true what is it they're trying their best to keep us from our inheritance trying to keep that word from being fulfilled can you say Amen yes sir they're trying but brother R said this he said you know he says there ain't enough devils in hell to keep us from doing it amen we were for ordained of God for this hour if the word of God manifest itself right through US amen amen aren't you glad for that he saids see when you say you're going to do anything going to accept your healing or going to accept you know the baptism of Holy Ghost that's when the devil flies on you with all four feet yeah yes when you say I'm going to draw closer to God don't think you just going to do it with by bre with a breeze Devil's going to jump all over you and beat the tar out of you if he can I'm going to stand for my healing that's when the devil's going to fly upon you sure he will think about it yeah hello yeah he said see he says now we're longing we're longing for somewhere where there's no death no sorrow no heartaches no old age that land is somewhere how many believes that that land is somewhere that's not America oh no and we'll never be able to achieve it by guns and fighting and so forth of the carnal natural carnal weapon but there is a land that we can go to and it's a a battle to get there that's right when God gave Israel Palestine when he was in Egypt they had to fight for every inch of it he told Joshua he said wherever the SES of your feet Treads upon that have I given you so Footprints means possession just keep walking walking pressing on and every time you make a step into the kingdom of God that's yours and all things are possible that's given and all things that are given is possible but it's a battle all right every day you wake up it's a battle but I like what brother Wayne said the other night he says don't surrender your faith don't re re surrender anything that God has given you keep pressing on let us be one that knows with courage that if God were to take us today tonight let our testimony ring out they never stopped they never quit they never gave up they kept pressing we are laying caim to Healing how many's laying claim we are laying claim to full Redemption full adoption we are laying claim to the Salvation of our family we are laying claim to Total deliverance we are laying claim to eternal life we are laying claim to that Eternal City we are laying claim to to uh uh an immortal body we are laying claim to the translation of our vow body and by faith we are laying claim to it everybody say by Faith by faith I'm laying claim to it I'm not I'm I'm not having to get a gun and shoot anybody I'm not having to try to kill people like you know Islam and all them they any enemy that they they want to be head they want to kill well that's not where we're fighting we're just laying Claim by faith it's mine it's mine can you say Amen see Israel as we close but Israel could not enter into the land of promise because of what unbelief unbelief unbelief see because they would never be able to whip their Giants they would never be able to overcome them world cities by unbelief it it had to be by faith ain't ain't that right see they would have become slaves to the enemy instead of overcoming the enemy see so so because God never required them to overcome on their own and God has never left you by yourself for you to overcome your enemy on your own it's by faith Say by Faith by faith therefore by their unbelief they had nothing to overcome with and and people that doubt God's word have nothing to overcome they'll never overcome they can be religious and still defeated they they can still go to church even set in the message church and still be defeated takes Faith amen Faith now notice Hebrews 10:38 now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in in him but we are not of them who draw back under predition but of them that believe to the what the saving of the Soul right we believe to the saving of the Soul Romans 10:9 if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved for with a heart man believeth under righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation amen so as we close if you believe it confess it if you believe it confess it can you say Amen see you cannot have it until you confess it you say oh I believe it though no no no from the heart man believeth and with the mouth confession is made can you say Amen so you cannot have it until you confess it why because is the high priest of your confession that's he's not the high priest of your good will your good intentions he's the high priest of your confession can you say amen and we already know that confession is a confession of faith for Paul says in that previous scripture that we read Romans 10:8 it's the word of faith which we preach and that word is NY even in thine heart and in thine mouth is so therefore the word that you speak is a confession of faith it's a word of faith that has come to you and it's a confession of faith that you speak that's right sure amen so what kind of a faith are we to have a faith that doesn't look at the situation and does not consider any circumstance amen do not Faith does not consider any circumstance right Faith does not look at how hard it is versus how easy it is Faith does not look at and and weigh the difference and weigh the odds and weigh it all out it doesn't look at all that it just looks at God's word so therefore the confession of faith it may be storming it may be whatever but the confession of Faith right in all of that God is with me God is for me I will make it I will go through it's a confession of Faith amen amen hallelujah so your confession doesn't regard the situation or conditions you realize that brother Braham said you will never live higher than your confession oh I just wish I could be a Christian I wish I could be an overcomer start confessing it everybody say that start confessing oh man I just wish my children could get saved well what are you doing what are you confessing oh
