[43:08] Sister Lisa uh in our prayers they're in

[48:05] chapter uh we're going to just read a
[48:11] u familiar scripture we had read it last
[48:13] Sunday but you shall receive
[48:16] power after that the Holy Ghost has come
[48:18] upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto
[48:21] me both in Jerusalem and all Judea and
[48:24] Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of
[48:27] the
[48:28] earth and then if you'll turn with me to
[48:31] the Book of John the first
[48:34] chapter the
[48:37] um John
[48:46] 1 and uh we'll start at the uh 10th
[48:50] verse he was in the world and the world
[48:52] was made by him and the world knew him
[48:55] not he came unto his own and his own
[48:59] received him not but as many as received
[49:02] him to them gave he power to become the
[49:05] sons of God even to them that believe on
[49:11] his name which were born not of blood
[49:14] nor of will the will of the flesh nor of
[49:17] the will of man but of God Amen aren't
[49:22] you glad for that amen you can have your
[49:25] seats
[49:28] this morning and um uh sure thank the
[49:31] Lord for watching over brother Mark amen
[49:35] and just hearing the testimony there and
[49:39] uh we also want to remember um
[49:42] Fellowship after the service for those
[49:45] that would like to going to just meet I
[49:48] guess be up the road at what they call
[49:50] the Frog Pond and uh so uh if you're
[49:55] able to make it there uh we'd love to
[49:58] have you and um last Sunday we had taken
[50:03] up uh an offering for those that were
[50:06] affected by the hurricane Helen and um
[50:10] you know just uh as you all know just a
[50:13] real
[50:15] Devastation there and from what I hear
[50:17] they're still finding uh bodies and
[50:21] different things and uh it's just a a
[50:24] sad deal and um but uh we we had taken
[50:28] up about $500 and and so uh I do
[50:33] appreciate um you giving uh there and
[50:36] then also brother Daniel and sister
[50:39] Britany took some clothing and other
[50:42] articles or whatever there to brother
[50:45] Reagan's as they are uh kind of involved
[50:49] in the operation of dispersing or
[50:52] Distributing things out and um and and
[50:56] so it it is uh deeply
[50:59] appreciated um we will probably be
[51:02] taking up uh another offering next week
[51:07] uh for those that would like to give and
[51:09] and things and um we have decided
[51:13] instead of just giving
[51:15] cash uh we'll probably uh just go buy
[51:20] stuff they they've got a list of things
[51:23] that they need uh flashlights um
[51:27] coats um uh you know um I don't know
[51:33] other things to Charcoal there's a lot
[51:36] of folks that are without houses uh been
[51:39] their houses destroyed and
[51:42] also um you know uh they didn't have
[51:45] flood insurance so many of them are
[51:48] going to have to rebuild on their own
[51:50] and uh so we we had thought about trying
[51:53] to talk to some of these stores here and
[51:56] see if they'd be willing to give it in
[51:58] bulk or or whatever see if they will
[52:02] help and um I think that would be better
[52:05] than just giving
[52:06] cash uh there so uh we we do want to
[52:09] remember them in our prayer and um as
[52:13] one said uh you know uh there on the
[52:17] news um said you know it's so easy to
[52:21] look at it now and see the need but we
[52:24] always it's so easy to forget
[52:27] uh down the road and and these people
[52:30] are going to be needing help for a long
[52:32] time and um and so and I know they're
[52:36] going to need our prayer so uh anyways
[52:39] we just want to remember that uh because
[52:41] it could be us it could be us without
[52:43] homes it could be us in trouble and uh
[52:47] we would certainly appreciate all the
[52:49] help people can give uh also I do want
[52:54] to thank you for the the gift card
[52:57] uh I didn't know it was pastor's
[52:58] appreciation day uh I guess that's uh
[53:02] today and uh brother Mark uh sent thank
[53:08] you and things and and so I I certainly
[53:11] appreciate it and then I found a uh gift
[53:13] card there on my desk this morning and
[53:16] from the church and uh so thank you very
[53:18] much and we we love and appreciate each
[53:22] and
[53:23] everyone amen and um I'm just glad to be
[53:26] a part of you amen and uh uh you know uh
[53:32] it's it's it's almost going home time I
[53:36] you know can't stress that enough but uh
[53:39] we're we're just about ready to cross
[53:41] the finish line and um I I I want to
[53:45] cross it with you I want to to to make
[53:48] it amen and not only me but you and we
[53:52] all just be around the Throne of God
[53:54] together amen
[53:56] and uh so anyway the the uh the thing
[54:00] here uh that we've read uh first of all
[54:04] Jesus said you shall receive power after
[54:06] that the Holy Ghost comes upon you and
[54:09] the title I guess that I would have is
[54:13] the the church has the same Authority as
[54:17] Christ and then it says uh as many as
[54:22] received him gave he the power to become
[54:25] Sons and we've talked about it before of
[54:29] course we dealt with it last Sunday but
[54:31] the word power means Authority it's not
[54:35] it's not necessarily muscle it's it's uh
[54:38] but it's an authority it's it's a
[54:40] government it's something that uh this
[54:44] this word Authority I looked it up it's
[54:48] it's legal power or a right to command
[54:52] or to act amen a warrant an order or
[54:58] permission so so I I thought that was
[55:01] pretty powerful uh that's what we have
[55:04] we have the legal right to be sons of
[55:07] God we have the right to command or to
[55:10] act uh and we have the permission and
[55:15] and we have been given an order amen I
[55:19] like that it been given an order it's
[55:21] not just a wish that God had it's it's a
[55:25] command it's a in order this is this is
[55:28] what you are are in in uh uh in the age
[55:32] that we're living in you are sons of God
[55:36] Amen and so only the sons of God have
[55:41] the authority to be what they are and to
[55:45] do what they do in line with the
[55:47] scriptures amen and that's what sons of
[55:51] God are they they act they do they live
[55:55] within line of the
[55:57] scriptures amen and and so who who are
[56:01] the sons of God it is they are the gene
[56:05] seed of God it's a literal it's it's
[56:08] something that it's not a make belief
[56:11] it's not something that we imagine it is
[56:14] it you are literally Sons and Daughters
[56:17] of God it's it's just that's that's
[56:21] powerful when we can really think of it
[56:24] that way we're not trying to be the bill
[56:27] we we're not trying to be this we are
[56:30] sons of God and and so sons of God they
[56:34] they are an attribute of God's thinking
[56:37] um and and it's they are an eternal
[56:40] thought for uh uh God's thoughts are
[56:43] Eternal and they are real so it's not
[56:46] just a passing thought it's an eternal
[56:49] thought and once that thought was
[56:52] conceived in God's mind it it's forever
[56:55] it that's that's just way it is and so
[56:59] uh we we come sons of God come from the
[57:03] premeditated thoughts of God Amen and so
[57:07] as as Jesus was the predestinated son of
[57:11] God so are we the predestinated Sons and
[57:15] Daughters of God and and uh uh of course
[57:20] you know the Bible uses the word Sons
[57:23] but uh uh that that uh that includes all
[57:27] of us here so we're all Sons or and
[57:31] daughters we put it that way but uh so
[57:35] so Jesus was predestinated to be the Son
[57:38] of God he was predestinated to be the
[57:41] Lamb of God he was predestinated to be
[57:45] uh uh the the the sacrifice he was
[57:48] predestinated to be the word made flesh
[57:51] the son of man he was predestinated to
[57:55] be the the the the the priest uh the
[57:59] king the uh the the intercessor uh uh
[58:04] the prophet he he was predestinated to
[58:06] be what he was and to do what he did he
[58:10] was predestinated to be crucified to be
[58:13] buried and and to rise again amen 1
[58:18] Peter 1:20 tells us that he was
[58:22] foreordained before the foundation of
[58:24] the world not that he should just exist
[58:27] in life but his his life was already
[58:31] foreordained everything that he was to
[58:34] be and and to do was foreordained by God
[58:39] Amen and and so therefore uh uh he was
[58:42] for ordained before the foundation of
[58:45] the world he didn't just become the lamb
[58:48] and he was for ordained to be the lamb
[58:51] he he just didn't stumble into things in
[58:54] life he he was for or ordained to be
[58:56] that before the foundation of the world
[58:59] and the scriptures forto of him of what
[59:02] he would do and and and what he would be
[59:06] and and John uh 5:39 Jesus would say
[59:10] search the scriptures for they testify
[59:13] of me the scriptures testified of of him
[59:17] and so this shows that he was
[59:20] predestinated because this is God's
[59:23] thoughts in seed form the word is God's
[59:26] thoughts and Seed form and so therefore
[59:30] if he was in the thinking of God then he
[59:32] had to be in the written uh word of God
[59:35] Amen and and so no wonder the scriptures
[59:39] would tell of him and foretell of what
[59:42] he would be and and so this this word
[59:46] predestinate to predestinate means to
[59:48] for orain to an Earthly or Eternal lot
[59:53] or destiny by Divine decree Amen to
[59:58] appoint to limit in advance to ordain to
[1:00:03] PR uh to predetermine so even even his
[1:00:08] resurrection and his his suffering and
[1:00:11] and his death was all predetermined of
[1:00:14] God and and and and and the time of his
[1:00:18] death and the length of his death was
[1:00:20] already predetermined so there was a
[1:00:22] limit to to that death uh uh for he said
[1:00:27] in Psalms I'll not suffer my Holy One to
[1:00:29] see corruption or leave his soul in hell
[1:00:33] so so then Jesus knew that that
[1:00:36] scripture pertained of him so he knew he
[1:00:39] would rise within that three-day period
[1:00:42] because corruption had it had already
[1:00:44] been spoken that corruption would not
[1:00:46] set in can you say amen and and so the
[1:00:50] script was written of him before he ever
[1:00:53] came to the Earth and and then the
[1:00:56] prophet would say he said he came to
[1:00:58] fulfill the word of God what the
[1:01:01] prophets had said see he came to fulfill
[1:01:04] the prophecy of the Old Testament Jesus
[1:01:08] came to fulfill it that's why he was on
[1:01:11] Earth to fulfill everything that was
[1:01:13] written of him ain't ain't that right
[1:01:16] see so therefore he was the word made
[1:01:19] flesh he was the word made flesh notice
[1:01:23] Jesus did not spend his life
[1:01:26] presuming presuming about things well I
[1:01:29] just presume I am the Messiah I presume
[1:01:33] that that I am I'm to do this and I am
[1:01:36] to do that no no no uh uh uh uh see
[1:01:40] presuming means to Adventure without
[1:01:43] Authority amen but Jesus had authority
[1:01:47] to do what he did he didn't pursue he
[1:01:50] wasn't just adventuring out and not
[1:01:53] knowing uh uh see and and so there were
[1:01:56] men who came on the scene uh before
[1:01:59] Christ came claiming to be Messiah and
[1:02:02] uh but but they didn't have that
[1:02:04] authority to be Messiah see they they
[1:02:07] were just presuming to be Messiah but
[1:02:10] there was no scriptures written of them
[1:02:12] uh to be the Messiah there was only one
[1:02:15] Messiah that the scriptures pertained to
[1:02:18] and and that Messiah had the authority
[1:02:21] to fulfill the scriptures amen but these
[1:02:24] men that claim to be that adventured
[1:02:27] without Authority just presuming their
[1:02:29] Ministry their influence came to not and
[1:02:33] they perish see and and and you remember
[1:02:36] a a Pharisee by the name of G and uh he
[1:02:40] reminded the Jews that had determined to
[1:02:43] kill Peter and and the other disciples
[1:02:46] or Apostles and they had determined to
[1:02:48] kill them and and and so G stopped him
[1:02:52] and said hold it hold it you know uh uh
[1:02:55] and uh in acts acts 5:35 he says unto
[1:02:58] them ye men of Israel take heed to
[1:03:00] yourselves what you intend to do as
[1:03:03] touching these men for before these days
[1:03:06] uh rose up theodus uh boasting to be
[1:03:10] himself to be somebody to whom a number
[1:03:13] of men about 400 joined themselves who
[1:03:16] was slain and all as many obeyed him
[1:03:19] were scattered and brought to not see
[1:03:22] this man claimed to be something and yet
[1:03:25] it was brought T not cuz he had no
[1:03:27] Authority in it see to do what he did
[1:03:30] after this man rose up Judas of Galilee
[1:03:33] in the days of the taxon and Drew away
[1:03:35] much people after him he also perished
[1:03:38] and all even as many as obeyed him were
[1:03:41] dispersed now I say unto you refrain
[1:03:44] from these men and let them alone for if
[1:03:46] this counsel or this work be of men
[1:03:48] it'll come to not ain't that right but
[1:03:50] if it be of God he says then you cannot
[1:03:53] overthrow it l happily you be found even
[1:03:56] to fight against God ain't that right so
[1:03:59] he knew that these these Apostles had
[1:04:02] the
[1:04:03] authority uh to do what they were doing
[1:04:07] they they they weren't just like these
[1:04:09] other men and if they are like these
[1:04:11] other men then they're going to come to
[1:04:12] not because they have no Authority
[1:04:14] behind this amen and and it's just the
[1:04:17] same way David keshes and the and the
[1:04:20] Jim Jones and and and well you just got
[1:04:23] them all all kinds all over the place
[1:04:25] see people presuming to be but they they
[1:04:29] come to not ain't that right but but see
[1:04:32] Jesus had the authority to fulfill uh uh
[1:04:37] the word of God to do what he did to be
[1:04:39] what he was and it wasn't government
[1:04:43] Authority it wasn't denominational
[1:04:45] Authority uh that he had it was
[1:04:47] scriptural Authority amen scriptural
[1:04:51] Authority It Was Written of him ain't
[1:04:54] that right and so that the the the
[1:04:56] Gentiles and Centurion he recognized the
[1:05:00] authority that Jesus had but also the
[1:05:03] Jews recognized this Authority that he
[1:05:06] had Matthew uh
[1:05:09] 21:23 it tells us that the chief priest
[1:05:12] and the Elders of the people came unto
[1:05:13] him as he was teaching and said by what
[1:05:18] Authority does uh uh thou these things
[1:05:22] and who gave thee this Authority so he
[1:05:27] he was he was doing this and they
[1:05:29] recognized that there was an authority
[1:05:31] behind his actions there was an
[1:05:33] authority amen behind his words and his
[1:05:37] life amen see they prided themselves in
[1:05:40] having Authority they boasted in their
[1:05:43] Authority amen but they didn't have this
[1:05:45] kind of authority their Authority that
[1:05:48] was exercised over men and and and and
[1:05:51] and status and they they had a status
[1:05:54] and they had all of these things I'm
[1:05:56] better than you and I'm this and so they
[1:05:59] were above the people that was their
[1:06:01] Authority but Jesus had a different
[1:06:03] Authority he he could be with the common
[1:06:06] people he could speak their language and
[1:06:09] and and he could uh uh uh uh um uh you
[1:06:12] know he he could be with those uh the
[1:06:15] Sinners and and these things and and uh
[1:06:18] uh eat with him and where whereas the
[1:06:20] scribes and Pharisees they could not do
[1:06:22] that you know they were above all that
[1:06:24] see but Jesus he could do this and and
[1:06:28] live so simple and so humble but there
[1:06:31] was an authority behind his life he
[1:06:34] wasn't seeking gain he wasn't seeking
[1:06:36] position he had an authority above all
[1:06:39] men amen see so so uh uh uh their
[1:06:44] Authority uh uh they might have had that
[1:06:47] Authority but yet they couldn't do the
[1:06:49] things that he did amen mark 1:22 and it
[1:06:53] says they were astonished at his
[1:06:55] Doctrine for he taught them as one that
[1:07:00] had Authority and not as the scribes see
[1:07:03] amen see yet uh teaching amen taught
[1:07:07] them but as one that had Authority see
[1:07:10] and not only did he teach as one having
[1:07:13] Authority but he also had authority over
[1:07:17] demonic spirits amen Mark 1:27 they were
[1:07:21] all amazed in so much that they
[1:07:23] questioned among themselves saying what
[1:07:25] thing is this what new doctrine is this
[1:07:28] for with authority commandeth he even
[1:07:31] the unclean spirits and they do obey him
[1:07:35] ain't that right so where did this
[1:07:37] Authority come from well it come from
[1:07:39] God for he was God made flesh God that
[1:07:44] that spirit being that that Eternal
[1:07:47] being had come down in time in a body of
[1:07:51] Flesh amen and the Bible says the
[1:07:54] fullness of the godhead dwelt bodily in
[1:07:57] him ain't that right amen see and so so
[1:08:00] the the men that that came before him
[1:08:03] and came after him and claiming to be
[1:08:05] Messiah and trying to do what he did and
[1:08:08] and all of these things see they failed
[1:08:11] because they were not predestinated to
[1:08:14] it ain't that right their Ministries
[1:08:16] crumbled because they were not
[1:08:17] predestinated to be exactly to be what
[1:08:20] he was amen you know when you look at
[1:08:23] nature amen you you can tell amen that
[1:08:27] God gives us a a uh contrast he gives us
[1:08:31] a a witness of these things uh take take
[1:08:34] the Buzzard for example versus an eagle
[1:08:37] amen and and uh uh the Buzzard you know
[1:08:40] it cannot do what an eagle does it it
[1:08:43] cannot be what an eagle is it it it just
[1:08:46] ain't it can't because it's not made to
[1:08:48] be that way it's it's not predestinated
[1:08:51] it don't have the authority to be an
[1:08:53] eagle you understand what I'm saying
[1:08:55] amen just like a peacock it it ain't got
[1:08:58] the Authority or uh uh you know or to or
[1:09:02] a buzzard I think brother brandham
[1:09:04] called it a crow amen um uh you know
[1:09:07] trying to be the uh uh the the peacock
[1:09:09] he says you can't do it you know you you
[1:09:11] can put you can put peacock feathers all
[1:09:13] in and but but it's still not it it's
[1:09:16] still not a peacock you understand what
[1:09:18] I'm saying see so this Buzzard it it's
[1:09:21] not built to go where the eagle goes
[1:09:23] it's not it's not built to see what an
[1:09:26] eagle sees it it it has a different
[1:09:29] appetite it his eyesight is different
[1:09:32] and if you'll notice he's limited by
[1:09:35] Nature not by
[1:09:38] circumstance can you say amen amen a
[1:09:40] buzzard is limited amen by nature and
[1:09:45] not by circumstance but you know if an
[1:09:47] eagle cannot soar in the in in the
[1:09:50] heavenlies it's because he has become a
[1:09:52] slave to something you can't blame it on
[1:09:55] his nature you can't say well you know
[1:09:57] he wasn't made to be that way well we
[1:09:58] all know he was made to be that way
[1:10:00] because there's been Eagles like him
[1:10:02] that are soar into the heavenlies and
[1:10:05] and so if an eagle if you see an eagle
[1:10:07] that is not up there in the heavenlies
[1:10:09] and can't fly then you know there's
[1:10:11] something wrong there's a circumstance
[1:10:13] there that is holding him but it ain't
[1:10:15] his nature that's binding him ain't that
[1:10:18] right amen a prophet the prophet talked
[1:10:20] about being at a zoo and seeing an eagle
[1:10:23] in the cage and and and and he had once
[1:10:26] soared in the heavenlies but somehow he
[1:10:28] had been enslaved he had been captured
[1:10:31] and thrown into this cage and brother BR
[1:10:33] says I watched him he'd be sitting there
[1:10:35] looking looking in the in the heavenlies
[1:10:38] and and and looking up there and then
[1:10:39] he' take off aen trying to fly because
[1:10:42] it was his nature to fly it was his
[1:10:44] nature to live up there amen but the uh
[1:10:47] uh he had hit that them bars and just
[1:10:49] fall back he said he was a bloody and
[1:10:52] and bruised and all that see it wasn't
[1:10:55] his nature that was holding him back it
[1:10:58] was that he had been captured and thrown
[1:11:01] into a cave amen uh by by his captors
[1:11:06] Amen brother BR said see the poor fell
[1:11:08] was so out of place amen that he would
[1:11:10] jump with all that was within him
[1:11:13] against the big bars flopping his wings
[1:11:15] only to find himself to fall on his back
[1:11:19] and that poor Eagle had beat himself
[1:11:21] against those bars until all the
[1:11:23] feathers was beat from his wings his
[1:11:25] head and his face was bruised he says
[1:11:28] and I watched him you know as I watched
[1:11:30] him again proudly walked back and with
[1:11:32] all that he had he poured himself
[1:11:35] against the bars to only find himself
[1:11:37] knocked backwards again amen and as he
[1:11:40] laay there on that floor and his weary
[1:11:43] eyes soared the skies amen see amen and
[1:11:47] and see he was not made to be in a cage
[1:11:51] he was not made to be in an Earthbound
[1:11:55] uh uh Rim he was made a Heavenly bird to
[1:11:58] soar in the heavens he was designed to
[1:12:01] take it he was designed Amen to go
[1:12:04] against the winds and and use the
[1:12:06] adversity of winds to take him up high
[1:12:10] amen he was that way amen and I thought
[1:12:12] of so many times sons of God are living
[1:12:15] just like that amen living in bars they
[1:12:18] want to be free they say I'll get closer
[1:12:20] amen and when they get closer or when
[1:12:22] they try when they jump when they fly
[1:12:24] amen they're only knocked back down by
[1:12:27] circumstances and things like that it's
[1:12:29] not that you're not made to fly it's not
[1:12:31] M that you're not made to be these
[1:12:33] things God Made You Amen to soar into
[1:12:37] the heavenlies God Made You to soar in
[1:12:40] the Revelation and in the power of His
[1:12:43] might of this day amen see brother Brown
[1:12:46] says about that eagle his whole makeup
[1:12:48] was to live in the blue way above the
[1:12:50] haunts and cares of this world Amen see
[1:12:54] if you if if you ever study an eagle
[1:12:56] amen see uh he holds a law within him
[1:13:02] amen and and and and he's designed see
[1:13:06] amen then and and if you know that if
[1:13:08] you know the kind of law that he has and
[1:13:11] and what he's designed for then then you
[1:13:14] know amen that living in a cage is not
[1:13:17] what God intended for him to be amen
[1:13:20] that's why God would send a message to
[1:13:22] let you know what you're designed to do
[1:13:24] what you're made to do and and to let
[1:13:26] you know that if you're not there you're
[1:13:28] in a
[1:13:32] cage this Eagle
[1:13:35] swar until he become enslaved ain't that
[1:13:38] right and so yet even though as he sat
[1:13:42] in the
[1:13:43] cage and though he was he was he was
[1:13:47] enslaved yet they couldn't take what God
[1:13:49] made him to be they couldn't take that
[1:13:52] away from him they couldn't change his
[1:13:54] design
[1:13:56] amen of what God designed him to be even
[1:13:58] though he was in that cage he was still
[1:14:01] what he was because he was predestinated
[1:14:04] to be that can you say man if only that
[1:14:08] little that eagle could have been set
[1:14:10] free amen see but if you look at that if
[1:14:13] you look at the crow it's not that he's
[1:14:16] enslaved in that way a lot of times it's
[1:14:19] just his nature his nature keeps him
[1:14:23] from flying as high as the eal he has no
[1:14:26] desire to go there he doesn't have the
[1:14:28] ability to go up there see so so it's
[1:14:32] not by by circumstance that keeps him
[1:14:35] it's by his nature can you say amen amen
[1:14:39] oh yeah he may talk about privileges you
[1:14:42] know uh he may talk about privileges
[1:14:44] that he has but he don't have the
[1:14:46] Privileges that an eagle has amen yeah
[1:14:49] he can gloat about his privileges like a
[1:14:51] lot of folks today they brag about their
[1:14:54] American Rights and they brag about
[1:14:55] their gay rights and they brag about
[1:14:58] this and they brag about that and all
[1:15:01] the rights that they have and you just
[1:15:03] have to laugh at it you know because
[1:15:05] that's all they brag about but here we
[1:15:07] are we've got a a greater privilege and
[1:15:09] that is to be soned and Daughters of God
[1:15:12] to soar above the heavenlies amen amen
[1:15:16] it's greater than American Privileges
[1:15:18] and American rights they it's greater
[1:15:20] than even denominational rights and
[1:15:22] privileges and and all of these things
[1:15:25] those privileges don't compare to the
[1:15:28] Privileges that the sons and daughters
[1:15:30] have of this age it's a privilege to
[1:15:33] know that I'm going in a Rapture it's a
[1:15:35] privilege to know that I'm headed for a
[1:15:37] body change it's a privilege to know
[1:15:39] that I have an authority I have an
[1:15:42] authority over every devil of hell
[1:15:45] that's a
[1:15:46] privilege it's a
[1:15:48] privilege yes sir and if you
[1:15:51] notice not only did Jesus have authority
[1:15:55] over unclean spirits that denom that
[1:15:57] dominated other people but he had the
[1:16:00] authority over every spirit that tried
[1:16:03] to dominate him as well when he is
[1:16:07] tempted of the devil he had he had an
[1:16:11] authority over that Spirit of
[1:16:14] unbelief amen that tried that tried to
[1:16:19] qu make him question as to who he was
[1:16:22] and tried to get him to prove amen that
[1:16:25] he was what he said he was if thou be
[1:16:29] the Son of God if thou be isn't that
[1:16:31] something that old unbelieving spirit
[1:16:33] always throws the questions out if you
[1:16:35] are forgiven if you are this if you are
[1:16:38] saved if you really are amen a child of
[1:16:41] God then then do this and do that and do
[1:16:43] this see it's a spirit of unbelief that
[1:16:46] tries to take over but see he had an
[1:16:48] authority over that he had authority
[1:16:51] over that evil spirit that tried to get
[1:16:53] him to do something
[1:16:55] outside of what was written of him to
[1:17:00] do yes sir he had the authority Amen to
[1:17:04] place the scriptures exactly in line oh
[1:17:07] yeah Satan was PL quoting the scriptures
[1:17:10] but he was misplacing them
[1:17:14] scriptures ain't that right now if you
[1:17:17] think of it many people have an
[1:17:19] authority they're able to to cast out
[1:17:22] Devils to heal the sick
[1:17:25] and we can see J Judas had the same
[1:17:27] thing casting Devils out Healing The
[1:17:30] Sick and and all of these things but
[1:17:33] they don't have the authority over the
[1:17:35] devil in their own life to where they
[1:17:38] can do the will of the father now notice
[1:17:42] that's the key now is to do the will of
[1:17:44] the father amen Matthew 7:21 not
[1:17:48] everyone that sayth unto me Lord Lord
[1:17:50] shall enter into the kingdom of heaven
[1:17:52] but he that doeth the will everybody say
[1:17:54] say doeth the will of My Father which is
[1:17:58] in heaven see many will say to me in
[1:18:01] that day Lord Lord have we not profesi
[1:18:03] in thy name in thy name have cast out
[1:18:04] devils and in thy name done many
[1:18:07] wonderful works then will I profess unto
[1:18:09] them I never knew you depart from me ye
[1:18:13] that work iniquity amen now Jesus shows
[1:18:16] us that that in in on later on down he
[1:18:19] shows us that it's not the man that
[1:18:22] builds the house that counts go ahead
[1:18:26] ain't that right it's not the one that
[1:18:28] labors for the Lord that
[1:18:31] counts you can do God a service without
[1:18:33] it being his will that's ain't that
[1:18:36] right see but it's the man whose house
[1:18:40] is still
[1:18:41] standing after the test
[1:18:44] comes test is going to come your way
[1:18:48] you'll never beg your way out of it
[1:18:50] you'll never cry your way out of it
[1:18:52] you'll never be so sport in life to
[1:18:54] where he doesn't come your way trials
[1:18:57] are going to come your way
[1:18:58] disappointments are going to come your
[1:18:59] way things are going to hell is going to
[1:19:02] break loose upon your
[1:19:07] life it's going to
[1:19:09] come can you say
[1:19:12] Amen now so notice Jesus talks about the
[1:19:16] two men that built their house
[1:19:19] right now the real difference between
[1:19:21] the two is one heard the word
[1:19:25] and didn't do
[1:19:27] it and his house
[1:19:30] fell the other one built his house he
[1:19:34] heard the
[1:19:35] word received a revelation of it and he
[1:19:39] did it he was able to not just hear it
[1:19:43] but do
[1:19:44] it can you say Amen therefore his house
[1:19:49] stood so it's not it's not the Min it's
[1:19:52] not the man who builds his ministry that
[1:19:54] count
[1:19:55] it's not the man who has great influence
[1:19:57] in the community that counts it's it's
[1:20:00] not he that says well God s a prophet in
[1:20:03] this age that counts it's not even he
[1:20:06] that that says Amen to the prophet that
[1:20:08] counts amen you go listen to the Token
[1:20:11] in Jeffersonville brother Braham says
[1:20:13] you know you can say well I just believe
[1:20:15] every word brother Bram he said if you
[1:20:16] believe it you'll follow the message you
[1:20:18] it's it's not just believing it's not
[1:20:20] just saying I believe it there's got to
[1:20:22] be a token inside
[1:20:25] a life that is on
[1:20:28] display now so so here brother brandham
[1:20:32] or or Jesus said Matthew 7:24 whosoever
[1:20:36] heareth these things of mine and doeth
[1:20:37] him I will liken him unto a wise man
[1:20:40] which built his house upon a rock the
[1:20:43] rains descended the floods came notice
[1:20:46] the same rains that fell upon the uh uh
[1:20:48] that that came upon the man the the
[1:20:50] foolish man is the same that that fell
[1:20:53] upon the one that that the wise man the
[1:20:56] rains descended the floods came the
[1:20:59] winds blew and beat up on that house and
[1:21:01] it fell not for it was founded upon a
[1:21:05] rock can you say man that is the man
[1:21:07] that only hear the word but he done the
[1:21:10] word he was a doer of the
[1:21:12] word ain't that right so Jesus had an
[1:21:17] authority over his own life to do the
[1:21:21] will of the father I think that's
[1:21:23] important now
[1:21:25] Amen to do the will of the Father John
[1:21:27] 4:34 my meat is to do the will of him
[1:21:30] that sent me and to finish his work
[1:21:33] that's what Jesus said another place he
[1:21:35] said John 5:30 I seek not my own will
[1:21:38] but the will of the Father which hath
[1:21:40] sent me John 6:38 he says I came down
[1:21:43] from heaven not to do my own will but
[1:21:46] the will of him that sent me ain't that
[1:21:49] right Philippians 2 and8 being found in
[1:21:52] fashion as a man he humbled himself and
[1:21:56] became obedient unto death even the
[1:21:59] death of the Cross amen see John 10:17
[1:22:04] therefore Jesus said do my father love
[1:22:06] me because I laid down my life and that
[1:22:09] I might take it again no man taketh it
[1:22:12] from me oh you say well they they
[1:22:15] crucified him but he gave his life to
[1:22:18] them he gave himself to them can you say
[1:22:22] amen amen see no man taketh from me but
[1:22:25] I lay it down of myself I have power I
[1:22:29] have that authority to lay it down and I
[1:22:32] have power to take it again can you say
[1:22:35] Amen because this commandment have I
[1:22:38] received of my father It Was Written of
[1:22:40] him not only to cast out devils and not
[1:22:43] only to heal the Blind and and and cause
[1:22:45] the lame to walk it was written of him
[1:22:48] that he would go to Calvary It Was
[1:22:51] Written of him that he would be buried
[1:22:53] amen and he would raise again but notice
[1:22:57] as much as he had the authority to open
[1:22:59] blind eyes and and caus the dead to
[1:23:02] raise he had the authority to go into
[1:23:05] the Garden of Gethsemane he had the
[1:23:08] authority Amen to carry that cross and
[1:23:11] walk up Calvary and lay his life
[1:23:19] down in the Garden of
[1:23:21] Gethsemane he said father if it be thy
[1:23:24] will let this cup pass from me but
[1:23:27] nevertheless not my will but thine be
[1:23:29] done you see one might think that Jesus
[1:23:32] didn't have much
[1:23:33] opposition and that he just lived a
[1:23:35] Carefree life and his life was just a
[1:23:39] cakewalk but I beg to differ with you
[1:23:42] amen Satan was hounding him all the time
[1:23:45] Satan was you're hounded just you're
[1:23:48] hounded you're fought well can imagine
[1:23:51] he was fought because if he truly was
[1:23:54] the Messiah Satan knew if he truly was
[1:23:57] that Messiah amen you know I got to get
[1:24:00] rid of him am ain't that right amen
[1:24:03] because I he's he's he's doing damage to
[1:24:05] my kingdom but he he didn't realize amen
[1:24:09] that putting him to death done the
[1:24:11] greatest damage ever it it actually
[1:24:14] broke his power can you say Amen but
[1:24:17] Jesus had to do this see amen but now
[1:24:21] notice in John
[1:24:22] 16:33 Jesus said these things have I
[1:24:25] spoken unto you that in me you might
[1:24:27] have peace in the world you shall have
[1:24:32] tribulation so so so don't don't think
[1:24:35] this is going to be easy for you to be a
[1:24:37] Christian oh no no no you're not on a
[1:24:40] picnic amen just kind of like Paul God
[1:24:43] just broke Paul in he didn't tell him
[1:24:46] well Paul now now you're just a new
[1:24:48] Christian so I'm just going to baby you
[1:24:49] for a little bit and let you grow up no
[1:24:51] he just told him like it was you're
[1:24:53] going to suffer for me you're going to
[1:24:55] be persecuted for me you're going to
[1:24:57] you're going to go through many things
[1:24:58] Paul amen but I'll be with you ain't
[1:25:01] that right and I just tell you Church
[1:25:02] you're going to go through a lot of
[1:25:03] disappointments it it may come from
[1:25:06] family it may come from Friends it may
[1:25:08] come from the world it may come from the
[1:25:09] church it may come from from from uh uh
[1:25:13] work it may come it doesn't matter where
[1:25:15] it's going to come but you're just going
[1:25:16] to go through these things you're going
[1:25:18] to go through disappointment you're
[1:25:19] going to shed your tears you're going to
[1:25:21] be heartbroken amen you're going to
[1:25:23] fight bitterness you're going to fight
[1:25:24] hate you're going to fight divisiveness
[1:25:27] you're going to fight amen a uh
[1:25:29] loneliness you're going to fight a uh uh
[1:25:31] fight the the the the the uh Satan
[1:25:34] trying to call you and and get you away
[1:25:37] from the church and get you away from
[1:25:39] things and you know you're just going to
[1:25:41] fight that's that's just the way it
[1:25:44] is that's what Jesus did he fought he
[1:25:48] went through
[1:25:49] things and he says in the world you
[1:25:51] shall have tribulation but everybody say
[1:25:54] but be of good cheer I have overcome the
[1:25:58] world I have overcome the world now you
[1:26:01] all know the if you if you listen to the
[1:26:03] message brother Bram says if God takes
[1:26:06] things from you you know people say well
[1:26:09] if if God would just take this from me
[1:26:11] Lord if you just take this habit and
[1:26:12] You' take this he says well you know if
[1:26:15] God done all that you'd have nothing to
[1:26:17] overcome he just took it away from you
[1:26:19] God ain't going to push you through the
[1:26:21] pipe you don't push you amen and then
[1:26:23] you get on the other side and he say
[1:26:25] blessed is he that overcome he said you
[1:26:27] had nothing to overcome so if Jesus said
[1:26:30] I have overcome the world then you know
[1:26:32] good and well he was tempted he was
[1:26:34] tried every devil of hell was after him
[1:26:37] but he says be of good cheer I have
[1:26:40] overcome the world and if I have
[1:26:42] overcome the world you shall overcome
[1:26:44] the
[1:26:45] world you may have to shed your tears
[1:26:47] that's fine but get get
[1:26:50] up people get mad at God for so much
[1:26:55] I'd say the reason why they get mad at
[1:26:56] God is because they they don't even
[1:26:58] serve God like they
[1:27:00] should they want to go live a selfish
[1:27:02] life indulge in everything that they
[1:27:04] want to and then when something bad
[1:27:06] comes then they want to blame God for
[1:27:14] it
[1:27:16] listen he had
[1:27:18] opposition he had
[1:27:22] disappointments he had loneliness he he
[1:27:25] fought
[1:27:27] things but he had that authority to
[1:27:30] overcome
[1:27:32] them praise the Lord can you say Amen
[1:27:36] you may see a Believer going
[1:27:38] down not going down but going through
[1:27:40] the
[1:27:41] fire you may see that believer shedding
[1:27:44] tears you may see that believer
[1:27:47] perplexed you may see that believer
[1:27:50] sometime not knowing what to do but
[1:27:53] don't you hold that keep that believer
[1:27:56] out don't you count him out
[1:27:58] yet cuz he's got an
[1:28:01] authority
[1:28:04] hlu now what did Jesus
[1:28:07] fulfill that which was written of him in
[1:28:09] the
[1:28:10] scriptures Jesus said man shall not live
[1:28:12] by bread alone but by every word that
[1:28:14] proceeds out of the mouth of God he
[1:28:17] lived by that word the word of God so
[1:28:20] mattered to him Amen brother Bram said
[1:28:24] said he lived by the word of the father
[1:28:25] he live he so lived by the word till he
[1:28:27] became the word so he wasn't a loose
[1:28:33] cannon his ministry wasn't a loose
[1:28:35] cannon his life wasn't a loose
[1:28:38] cannon his testimony wasn't a loose
[1:28:42] cannon
[1:28:45] hello and no other Son of God is
[1:28:51] either brother Bram said God in ended
[1:28:54] for man to express his
[1:28:56] words God intended for us to express his
[1:29:00] words by our
[1:29:03] life and he says a life lived by the
[1:29:06] word would be the word
[1:29:08] expressed
[1:29:10] amen you may have ideas about things you
[1:29:13] may have opinions and all of these
[1:29:15] things but that isn't the way we live we
[1:29:18] live by this word that's right and a
[1:29:22] life lived by the word is the word
[1:29:25] expressed now Adam was given the word to
[1:29:28] live by Brother Bram said he was he was
[1:29:30] to live by every word and he failed to
[1:29:33] take keed to every word Moses failed to
[1:29:36] live by every word he failed in his
[1:29:39] anger David failed to live by every word
[1:29:42] he failed by adultery Abraham failed to
[1:29:45] live by every word Joseph failed to live
[1:29:48] by every word amen then he says but
[1:29:50] eventually in the fullness of time there
[1:29:53] came one the head even Jesus who also
[1:29:56] must be tempted to see if he would live
[1:29:58] by every word that proceeds out of the
[1:29:59] mouth of God then was Satan f for here
[1:30:04] was one who lived by it is written it is
[1:30:09] written it is written can you say Amen
[1:30:12] every time that Satan would come at him
[1:30:14] it was written it is written Satan
[1:30:17] couldn't enti him Satan couldn't deceive
[1:30:19] him Satan couldn't trap him he was so
[1:30:23] with the word
[1:30:24] that the word became preeminent in his
[1:30:28] life
[1:30:29] see he lived he says see here was one
[1:30:34] that lived by it is written and that
[1:30:36] Masterpiece of God overcame by
[1:30:39] reflecting God's word then was this
[1:30:42] manifested perfect one given to the
[1:30:44] Cross as the perfect Lamb of God for the
[1:30:46] perfect sacrifice and on the tree he
[1:30:49] received the wounds unto death that we
[1:30:52] by him and because of him might eat of
[1:30:56] the tree of life then that life freely
[1:31:00] given would enable us to
[1:31:03] overcome and express the word of God so
[1:31:07] you see how he overcome you see how he
[1:31:09] expressed the word of God he so lived by
[1:31:11] the word till he became the word amen
[1:31:14] every time Satan would come at him it is
[1:31:16] written Satan it is written Satan it is
[1:31:18] written
[1:31:21] Satan now you know how you're going to
[1:31:23] over come it is written it is written it
[1:31:25] is written that's
[1:31:29] right now watch Hebrews 2
[1:31:34] and9 we see Jesus who was made a little
[1:31:37] lower than the angels for the suffering
[1:31:39] of death crowned with Glory and Honor
[1:31:41] that he by the grace of God should taste
[1:31:43] death for every man for it became him
[1:31:47] for whom are all things and by whom are
[1:31:50] all things in bringing many sons on to
[1:31:54] Glory other words the prophet said to
[1:31:56] bring in many sons that's predestinated
[1:32:00] to eternal life to make the captain of
[1:32:02] their salvation perfect through
[1:32:04] sufferings for both he that sanctifieth
[1:32:07] and they that are Sanctified are of all
[1:32:11] one are all of one ain't that right see
[1:32:14] so God gave His only begotten son born
[1:32:18] of a woman but not by sex by a spoken
[1:32:22] word god God created that blood cell in
[1:32:25] the womb of Mary can you say amen and in
[1:32:28] in in Revelations
[1:32:30] 3:14 he is revealed as the beginning of
[1:32:34] the creation of
[1:32:36] God can you say that with me the
[1:32:39] beginning of the
[1:32:41] creation of God Jesus Christ was ain't
[1:32:46] that right he was Jehovah made manifest
[1:32:49] now notice the prophet said God in
[1:32:51] creation god with the Liv little part of
[1:32:54] the creation that God was living in
[1:32:57] himself he was the beginning of that
[1:33:00] creation of God and from him begat many
[1:33:06] sons ain't that right see he he he had
[1:33:10] the ability to multiply the fish and the
[1:33:14] loaves but that that Authority just
[1:33:16] didn't stop there he had the power to
[1:33:22] multiply himself
[1:33:26] praise the lord we sure he
[1:33:29] did God look he said he used the flesh
[1:33:32] that created himself in order to create
[1:33:34] through him and to bring many bring
[1:33:38] through him many sons into the world
[1:33:40] that he might show himself alive today
[1:33:43] God ain't showing himself alive through
[1:33:45] government
[1:33:47] politicians
[1:33:49] denominations just
[1:33:51] religion he's showing himself alive in
[1:33:55] the sons that he has brought
[1:33:58] forth that's right that's right see
[1:34:02] another place this logos that was in him
[1:34:05] which was the spirit of God the
[1:34:07] anointing through the sanctifying grace
[1:34:09] of the blood brought many sons to God
[1:34:12] which is Anointed with this same logos
[1:34:14] you're Anointed with that same logos not
[1:34:17] the different Spirit not some other
[1:34:22] Spirit on the day of Pentecost in
[1:34:24] another place he says it come down that
[1:34:26] Pillar of Fire and broke apart like that
[1:34:29] and tongues of fire licks of fire set
[1:34:32] upon each of them see not their tongues
[1:34:36] but tongues of fire set upon each of
[1:34:38] them a elected selected group identified
[1:34:43] by this Pillar of Fire showing that God
[1:34:46] had separated himself in the man do you
[1:34:49] get it God the lust separating himself
[1:34:53] in two men God not in one person now
[1:34:59] he's in his church
[1:35:01] Universal same God in many members many
[1:35:07] sons ain't that right God came in one
[1:35:12] son died on the cross and through him he
[1:35:17] produced many sons you are a
[1:35:20] multiplication of him
[1:35:23] amen hallu
[1:35:26] glory amen you're part of that new
[1:35:29] creation that's right God didn't start
[1:35:32] the creation with you he started the
[1:35:34] creation with him he's the beginning of
[1:35:37] the creation of
[1:35:40] God so Jesus died the prophet said the
[1:35:44] only begotten Son of God that he might
[1:35:46] make us adopted children that he might
[1:35:50] work his will through us right how
[1:35:54] shameful we should be of claiming to be
[1:35:56] children of God and letting the devil
[1:35:58] push us around like he does we've got
[1:36:01] the rights how many believes that church
[1:36:04] you've got the
[1:36:06] rights you're the one with the
[1:36:10] rights as many as received him to them
[1:36:13] gave he the power to be sons of God
[1:36:15] you've got a legal right to be a Son of
[1:36:17] God yes sir it's a shame that we would
[1:36:21] let Satan beat knock us around push us
[1:36:25] around it's a shame that we had accept
[1:36:28] what the devil gives us as though it
[1:36:30] belongs to us you don't have to accept
[1:36:33] nothing of the devil
[1:36:35] amen live by the word amen problem said
[1:36:38] we got the rights we're already risen
[1:36:40] with him can you say
[1:36:42] amen I hope this all right this

[1:43:41] gospel and the power of almighty God has
[1:43:44] spread around the world and the
[1:43:46] separation time is now taking place when
[1:43:50] God is calling a bride and the devil is
[1:43:53] calling a church let me be part of that

[1:44:35] not of this
[1:44:37] world they may legalize things but that
[1:44:40] does not mean it's right your life
[1:44:43] should be judged by this word and not by
[1:44:45] what they

[2:00:25] the ends of the
[2:00:27] Earth it's
[2:00:30] over the world is truly falling apart

[2:00:48] brother brah said he said this message
[2:00:51] is the
[2:00:54] sign that the world is
[2:00:57] finished it's a sign to us to get
[2:01:02] in to make sure you have that token in
[2:01:04] your
[2:01:05] hand because we're leaving this
[2:01:08] [Music]
[2:01:10] place so whatever privileges you have as
[2:01:13] an American as a human being they're
[2:01:16] fighting for human rights and yes you
[2:01:18] might have a lot of Human Rights
[2:01:22] don't dwell on
[2:01:24] that dwell upon your Redemptive
[2:01:28] rights because you them Redemptive right
[2:01:30] you're going to receive a body
[2:01:34] change you're going to receive something
[2:01:38] that's going to Quicken this old
[2:01:41] body you love
[2:01:43] him brother Brian said we are now at the
[2:01:47] end of the history of the world there
[2:01:51] will be no use of writing it because
[2:01:53] there won't be anybody to read it it's
[2:01:56] at the end of time and the whole world
[2:02:01] has succumbed to the demonic spirits
[2:02:05] that have poured in into this age and
[2:02:09] they're dominating this age but the sons
[2:02:12] of God have the authority over every
[2:02:15] foul Spirit do you believe that you have
[2:02:18] the authority of God over every foul
[2:02:21] spirit every unclean spirit amen is true
[2:02:25] brother brah said the holy spirit is
[2:02:27] here to fulfill the prophecy of the New
[2:02:29] Testament he fulfilled the prophecy of
[2:02:32] the Old Testament now he's here to
[2:02:36] fulfill it in you the prophecy of the
[2:02:38] New Testament and any disciple of Christ
[2:02:41] who has come in contact with him in
[2:02:44] Redemption and salvation has come into
[2:02:46] his heart he is a possessor of God and
[2:02:50] what kind of life should we we live how
[2:02:53] should we walk and how should we talk if
[2:02:56] God is representing himself through our
[2:02:58] own mortal bodies can you say Amen do
[2:03:01] you love him you know it looked
[2:03:06] like it looked like that the Holy Spirit
[2:03:09] would have no
[2:03:12] future in the church it looked like it
[2:03:15] just had no
[2:03:16] future if you go look at the Feast of
[2:03:18] the trumpets brother brandham said for
[2:03:20] nearly 2,000 years the the Holy Spirit
[2:03:22] has been bound under modum martyrdom
[2:03:25] back there and under the church ages
[2:03:27] it's been bound not at the r river
[2:03:29] Euphrates but at the door of Creeds and
[2:03:32] dogmas that the Holy Spirit can't work
[2:03:35] in the church because of man-made
[2:03:37] systems see it so so it just looked
[2:03:39] hopeless it looked like it would be
[2:03:41] forever bound it looked like it would be
[2:03:42] forever imprisoned by the Creeds and
[2:03:45] dogmas but then he would tell us but it
[2:03:47] is to be
[2:03:49] loosed and I say to you it has been
[2:03:52] loosed in this evening time by this
[2:03:55] evening time
[2:03:56] message brother Brandon may have not
[2:03:58] been had that authority to loose that
[2:04:00] eagle but he had the authority to loose
[2:04:02] that the holy spirit in this age by
[2:04:05] bringing back the word of God to us to
[2:04:08] where the Holy Spirit brother Braham
[2:04:10] said is back in the church again Christ
[2:04:12] himself revealed in human flesh in the
[2:04:15] evening time aren't you glad for that he
[2:04:18] said and the badge of authority is not a
[2:04:20] name of a den denomination but it's the
[2:04:23] power of the resurrection of Christ in
[2:04:26] each individual the life that's within
[2:04:29] us is not only a creative life but it's
[2:04:33] part of his own life and that's the
[2:04:35] reason we have the authority to speak to
[2:04:37] a devil because it's God's Own creative
[2:04:40] life if you're anointed see it's not you
[2:04:43] that speaketh but the father that
[2:04:46] dwelleth in you oh itn't be wonderful
[2:04:49] can you lift your hands unto the Lord
[2:04:51] and
[2:04:52] aren't you glad to be sons of God
[2:04:55] Daughters of God with the
[2:04:57] authority you don't have to knut down to
[2:05:00] the devil you don't have to give in to
[2:05:02] that Old Slew Foot hallelujah we're sons
[2:05:05] of God with the authority in this
[2:05:10] age he's identified us as Sons by
[2:05:14] pouring his Spirit upon us and giving us
[2:05:18] the
[2:05:19] authority how we're so thankful father

[2:11:08] now actually the Bible says the weight
[2:11:10] and sin lay aside every weight and sin
[2:11:14] which so easily to said

[2:11:23] to to sin and and to where it becomes
[2:11:26] sin lay it aside those things are so
[2:11:30] appealing so many so many
[2:11:34] men have fallen over the
[2:11:37] [Music]
[2:11:39] website CU there's so many things used
[2:11:42] to you could it was just always in a
[2:11:45] store you'd have to turn into the
[2:11:47] parking lot walk into the store and get
[2:11:50] in these things but now it's just right
[2:11:51] at the fingertips right on the internet
[2:11:54] and so many men have been enticed sad to
[2:11:57] say women too been have been enticed by
[2:12:00] the filth upon of them
[2:12:03] things church it's time to lay aside
[2:12:05] those things if if you're you're
[2:12:08] involved in any of that and if you keep
[2:12:11] falling into that there's there there's
[2:12:13] something that you got to lay aside lay
[2:12:15] aside those weights lay aside those
[2:12:18] things that them you say well I know
[2:12:20] they're trying to make it to where
[2:12:21] that's that's how you live in life you
[2:12:23] got to have internet you got to have
[2:12:25] this you got to have that you know I
[2:12:28] understand but I tell you what it's it's
[2:12:30] time for prayer it's it's time to really
[2:12:32] get with
[2:12:33] God can you say
[2:12:35] amen amen I don't it could be just
[2:12:39] anything amen but whatever it is if it's
[2:12:42] taking you away from God if it's taking
[2:12:44] you away from your dedication with God
[2:12:47] it's time to do just that that check
[2:12:49] that inventory in my life life our lives
[2:12:52] to say God you know whatever it is I I
[2:12:55] want to get away from now all that I I
[2:12:57] just I just want to get it see because
[2:12:59] it oh yeah you can go through the forms
[2:13:01] of it you can go through the form of
[2:13:03] preaching you can go through the form of
[2:13:04] playing music you can go through the
[2:13:06] form of saying amen you can go through
[2:13:08] the form of singing a special or
[2:13:10] whatever but that's not the point the
[2:13:12] point is you want to be anointed in it
[2:13:14] you you want God to be pleased with your
[2:13:16] life you want God to back your life up
[2:13:19] and if there's sins if there sins
[2:13:21] there don't don't make them excuses
[2:13:25] don't don't just live in it and and make
[2:13:28] that your Norm look at it and say I'm a
[2:13:30] Son of God with the authority over this
[2:13:34] I I'm I'm not going to accept it as part
[2:13:36] of my life can you say Amen I'm going to
