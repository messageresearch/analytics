[41:12] we'd read it
[41:16] again amen the Book of Joshua the 14th
[41:21] chapter amen had a wonderful time in um
[41:25] Arkansas and good meeting and people
[41:29] seem to have uh been blessed brother um
[41:33] wendam brother Andrew and brother Daryl
[41:36] just done an outstanding job and uh a
[41:40] lot of deliverances took place and so
[41:42] we're really thankful for that and uh
[41:45] just saw a lot of
[41:47] unity um uh there among the churches and
[41:52] and uh so that's that's just really
[41:55] wonderful and um so anyways I've got um
[42:00] ask brother Ben uh PR he's the pastor
[42:03] there in uh where we went to minister
[42:06] but asked him to maybe come and speak
[42:09] for us um on our fall festival and so
[42:14] Lord willing he'll be Mi ministering at
[42:16] that time so we're looking forward to
[42:18] that also
[42:20] um um not this Sunday but the following
[42:23] Sunday brother Matthew mcclard Matt
[42:26] mcclard is is to be ministering for us
[42:29] as well and he's from Indiana I think
[42:32] most I guess most of us know him um but
[42:36] just a wonderful brother and so he's
[42:39] he's going to be ministering for us uh
[42:42] that
[42:43] Sunday and um uh I made a real quick
[42:47] decision today uh this

[42:55] well they're going to uh brother Miguel
[42:59] uh his sister as we had announced uh she

[43:40] them will probably stay up during the
[43:42] night with the body and uh do whatever
[43:47] their ritual is uh but anyway uh made

[44:43] don't fall out of the sky amen praise
[44:47] the Lord I I used to like to fly and the
[44:50] older I get I I just like the ground I
[44:53] just just you know like solid footing
[44:58] amen so Joshua the 14th chapter and the
[45:02] seventh verse will
[45:04] start uh Caleb speaking uh 40 years old
[45:08] was I when Moses the servant of the Lord
[45:12] sent me from Kadesh barnea to spy out
[45:15] the land and I brought him word again as
[45:18] it was in Mine Heart nevertheless my
[45:21] brethren that went up with me made the
[45:23] heart of the people melt but I wholly
[45:26] follow the lord Lord my God and Moses
[45:29] swear on that day saying surely the land
[45:32] where on thy feet have trodden shall be
[45:36] thine inheritance and thy children's
[45:39] forever because thou H has wholly
[45:41] followed the Lord my God and now behold
[45:44] the Lord hath kept me alive as he said
[45:47] these 40 and5 years even since the Lord
[45:50] spake this word unto Moses while the
[45:53] children of Israel wandered in the
[45:54] wilderness and now lo I am this day four
[45:58] score and 5 years old as yet I am strong
[46:03] or as strong this day as I was in the
[46:06] day that Moses sent me as my strength
[46:09] was then even so is my strength now for
[46:13] war both to go out and to come in now
[46:16] therefore give me this mountain whereof
[46:19] the Lord spake in that day for thou
[46:21] heardest in that day how the anakims
[46:25] were there and and that the cities were
[46:29] great and fenced if so be the Lord will
[46:33] be with me then I shall be able to drive
[46:35] them out as the Lord said amen let's
[46:39] just bow our heads in a word of prayer
[46:42] before we go into the word
[46:46] father indeed we need you tonight Lord
[46:49] as we see the the chaos around the world
[46:54] and father uh just seems like the enemy
[46:57] is Conquering
[47:00] prevailing over the
[47:03] people but father we're so glad that you
[47:07] bought us you purchased us with your own
[47:10] blood you sealed us with your spirit
[47:13] father and Satan can't get to us and
[47:18] Lord we in this world of trouble in this
[47:23] world of chaos and fear father we have
[47:27] come with in anticipation to meet with
[47:31] you Lord our soul at peace and at rest
[47:36] Lord our faith
[47:38] intact knowing Lord that you promis to
[47:41] be with us you'd never leave us nor
[47:44] forsake us father now Lord we're just
[47:48] asking that you would anoint both
[47:49] speaker and hearer Lord may this service
[47:53] not be in vain but Lord May the word
[47:57] have its effect upon us and those that
[48:00] would be watching online father father
[48:03] may your anointing be Lord wherever
[48:06] they're at and may the word have an
[48:09] effect upon them we ask it in Jesus
[48:12] Christ's name and the church says amen
[48:16] amen and amen you can have your seats
[48:19] this
[48:20] evening and
[48:23] um you know uh according to
[48:27] Ecclesiastes three God has a time for
[48:31] for
[48:32] everything and uh Ecclesiastes 3:1 it
[48:37] says to everything there is a season a
[48:40] time to every purpose under heaven and
[48:45] and so throughout church history we have
[48:48] uh seen that there is a time not only
[48:51] for the world and not only for
[48:53] individuals but also for the church
[48:57] um there's been seasons and times that
[49:00] the church has gone
[49:02] through but as you know the the question
[49:06] would be I guess uh is what time is it
[49:09] now for the church what season are we
[49:13] living in am and you know the the the
[49:17] prophet said the church has got to keep
[49:20] time with the Bible it's got to keep
[49:23] exactly with the Bible speak uh in time
[49:27] and and she will she's going to she is
[49:31] keeping in perfect timing now we know
[49:35] that we
[49:37] are uh we know the time that we're
[49:40] living in by the types and the
[49:42] Shadows uh that are in the Bible uh the
[49:46] you know the Old Testament was was types
[49:49] and shadows that that that spoke of of
[49:52] future events and things like that and
[49:55] we also know the the time that the
[49:58] church is living in by prophecy uh uh
[50:03] the Fulfillment of Prophecy and and so
[50:07] God gives us uh uh ways to to know uh
[50:13] the time that we're living in and so it
[50:16] is so important that we would know the
[50:19] time and the day that we're living in we
[50:22] certainly don't want to guess we we
[50:24] don't want to uh be one that is living
[50:27] our lives without really understanding
[50:30] what God is doing and expecting of us uh
[50:34] and so uh God as the prophet has taught
[50:37] us that God has allotted his word to
[50:40] each age there's a a certain word that
[50:43] has been allotted uh to to every Age and
[50:47] and and it's it's it's meant for the
[50:50] people of that age to live that word out
[50:53] to fulfill that word and to express it
[50:56] and and so uh uh we find that the elect
[51:00] of that age will fulfill the word for
[51:04] their age and and as we know message
[51:08] Believers we we know that God has always
[51:10] had one in the age to catch the
[51:14] revelation of the word for the age amen
[51:18] and so the the word uh he he he would
[51:21] not leave the people uh without maybe an
[51:25] understanding of what he's doing and so
[51:28] he would raise up uh someone he would
[51:30] predestinate a a a a man uh uh and and
[51:35] which we would know to be a prophet and
[51:38] then the word would come to him the
[51:40] revelation of the word for that age for
[51:44] that hour and then he would let the
[51:46] people know uh what the word is it's
[51:50] like the word for Noah's day uh was
[51:53] revealed to Noah and then Noah uh uh
[51:57] caught that Revelation and began to
[51:59] preach it to the people and and then it
[52:02] would rally the elect uh uh for that age
[52:06] to him and under the message of the hour
[52:09] the word for Moses's day was revealed to
[52:12] Moses and and again Moses would be the
[52:16] one to declare the word for that age and
[52:19] and the people would rally around him
[52:22] and uh that that elect the word for
[52:25] Joshua's day was revealed to Joshua the
[52:28] word for Jesus day was revealed to Jesus
[52:31] and and so they they would Proclaim that
[52:34] word and then God would vindicate them
[52:37] to be the truth ain't that right and so
[52:40] the the the the people and uh that would
[52:43] listen and not only just listen but the
[52:46] they they believed uh the words of of
[52:49] the prophet and uh they were that elect
[52:53] and and and uh uh for that age
[52:56] well the the the Book of Revelation
[52:59] tells us that there are seven Church uh
[53:02] uh uh ages and there are seven
[53:06] Messengers uh and so each age has a
[53:10] messenger uh that is that God would
[53:13] predestinate to that church age and so
[53:17] uh uh brother Brandon would tell it like
[53:18] this the angel of the church catches the
[53:20] mystery of God not fully yet revealed
[53:24] but when he does he catches the mystery
[53:26] of God then he goes forth to the people
[53:29] after the mystery has been given to him
[53:32] he goes forth to the people and what
[53:34] does he do out there he begins to
[53:36] Proclaim that message and what does it
[53:39] start a war a spiritual war and then God
[53:43] takes his messenger with the elect of
[53:46] that age and lays them away asleep and
[53:49] then he drops a plague upon them who
[53:52] rejected a temporary judgment and then
[53:55] after that is over then he goes on and
[53:58] they denominate and bring in
[54:00] denominations and start off with that
[54:02] man's work like of Wesley and all the
[54:04] rest of them then it gets all in a a
[54:06] scruple again and then another mystery
[54:09] comes forth then what happens another
[54:11] messenger arrives on Earth uh uh for a
[54:15] church age then when he arrives the
[54:17] trumpet sounds he declares war then what
[54:20] happens finally he's caught away and
[54:23] then he's laid away then PL Falls and
[54:27] destroys them spiritual death hits the
[54:29] church and she's gone uh that group see
[54:32] and then he goes on to another one oh he
[54:35] said it's a great plan until it comes to
[54:38] that last angel now he has no certain
[54:40] mystery but he gathers up all that's
[54:43] been lost in them other age all the
[54:46] truths that wasn't truly revealed yet as
[54:49] the Revelation come then he reveals
[54:52] those things in his day to the people
[54:55] ain't that right
[54:56] and so then then the the elect are uh is
[55:00] the one who recognizes their day and
[55:03] they recognize their season they they
[55:06] recognize the message that God has sent
[55:09] to them and then the rest of the world
[55:12] goes on as though nothing has ever
[55:15] happened uh they're Tangled in the cares
[55:17] of Life they're entangled with with the
[55:20] PO political uh Powers they're entangled
[55:23] with the religious Powers they're just
[55:25] and and and they don't know what God is
[55:28] is is doing and they don't know what he
[55:31] has done and and so yeah they serve God
[55:35] as in future tense that it's coming
[55:37] coming coming and yet the elect knows
[55:40] that something has happened in their day
[55:44] and and so now our opening scripture is
[55:47] dealing with Caleb uh who has crossed
[55:49] over into the uh the land of Canaan
[55:52] under uh the message of Joshua uh the
[55:56] the the ministry of Joshua and and of
[56:00] course the prophet told us in in
[56:02] adoption series that the land of Canaan
[56:05] is a type it's it it's a type well now I
[56:08] believe and and I believe that the
[56:10] message would back it up that Canaan
[56:12] land is a type of the bright age of of
[56:16] today and and now we would never know
[56:20] that that that terminology phrase or
[56:23] whatever uh if it had not been for the
[56:25] message of the hour I know there's a lot
[56:28] of people that have put a bad name to
[56:30] bride Age and and so a lot of folks
[56:32] don't want to teach it and say it and
[56:35] mention it it becomes a bad word but but
[56:38] we wouldn't know bride age if the
[56:40] prophet hadn't taught it if the prophet
[56:42] taught it if he said it then we can
[56:44] teach it and we can say it amen he's the
[56:47] one that introduced the bride age to us
[56:50] now Canan did not represent the age of
[56:53] the Millennium that's what the prophet
[56:55] said it uh because uh there is no war
[57:00] and and and struggles and things in the
[57:02] Millennium but in the in in in Canaan uh
[57:05] there was there was fighting there was
[57:07] Wars there was conquering and all of
[57:10] these things so what the land of Canan
[57:12] represented was the age of the Overcomer
[57:16] the dispensation of overcoming ain't
[57:19] that right so so then Caleb entered into
[57:23] a land that had been promised under the
[57:26] ministry of Joshua and and notice the
[57:29] prophet said now what is the land
[57:31] promised to the New Testament believer
[57:34] the promise is the holy spirit how many
[57:37] believes that the promise is the holy
[57:40] spirit see and and if you notice Caleb
[57:43] there would have been no way for him to
[57:45] cross over into the land of promise
[57:48] except there was for the except for the
[57:52] Joshua Ministry had no other message
[57:55] could have taken him over it he had to
[57:57] come under the the the the Vindicated
[58:01] word for that age and that was under the
[58:03] ministry of Joshua ain't that right and
[58:06] so so Joshua was the one who God had
[58:10] called to take the people over and and
[58:13] was Vindicated uh by God now and and and
[58:17] so if we look at that then then in the
[58:20] message identification brother brandom
[58:23] starts off by saying this I'm sure
[58:25] tonight that that we ought to find
[58:27] ourselves somewhere in some character of
[58:30] The Bible so so this Bible ought to be a
[58:33] personal book to us it it should not
[58:35] just be a history book it should not
[58:37] just be you know a a book of love or
[58:40] whatever it it it it should be really a
[58:44] personal book to us because we ought to
[58:47] be able to find some character in the
[58:49] Bible that we can identify with today
[58:54] and say well that me well that that's
[58:57] why we look at Caleb tonight and been
[58:59] talking about Caleb is because uh he he
[59:03] is somebody that we should be able to
[59:05] identify ourselves with so he says now
[59:08] we ought to find somewhere in some
[59:11] ourselves somewhere in some character of
[59:13] The Bible so that we would know the
[59:17] outcome of that character and know what
[59:20] our outcome will be ain't that right now
[59:23] if if you're going to identify yourself
[59:26] as Goliath with Goliath well then you
[59:28] know that your outcome is defeat it's
[59:32] it's you're going to be stopped you you
[59:35] what your plans are going to be hindered
[59:37] and and and these things but if you can
[59:39] identify with Caleb well then you
[59:41] automatically know that there's no
[59:44] weapon going to be formed against you
[59:45] that's going to prosper you're going to
[59:48] overcome because that's what Caleb was
[59:50] he was an overcomer now see so brother
[59:53] Braham said Caleb represents the True
[59:57] Believer who stayed with Joshua so how
[1:00:01] many True Believers do we have amen now
[1:00:04] now then Caleb is your type Caleb is
[1:00:07] your type I I know we we're in a world
[1:00:10] full of trouble and demonic powers are
[1:00:13] everywhere but if you can take and
[1:00:16] identify with Caleb then you can find
[1:00:19] rest for your soul knowing that as his
[1:00:23] outcome was Victorious your out come
[1:00:26] will be victorious as well amen see so
[1:00:30] now from what I see uh Caleb only
[1:00:33] represents the sons of God for this day
[1:00:37] uh uh that that we live in and and so uh
[1:00:42] you know we we read you know uh the our
[1:00:45] opening scripture was from the Book of
[1:00:47] Joshua and and and and I guess all of us
[1:00:49] know this but brother Bram said that
[1:00:52] book of Joshua should actually be titled
[1:00:56] the book of Ephesians of the Old
[1:00:58] Testament and and he says the reason why
[1:01:01] is because the Book of Joshua parallels
[1:01:04] with the book of Ephesians of the New
[1:01:06] Testament see and and and so so the Book
[1:01:10] of Joshua is a book of redemption the
[1:01:12] prophet said of the Old Testament you
[1:01:15] see Exodus was a book of redemption
[1:01:17] dealing with the coming out two parts of
[1:01:20] redemption right and so the book of
[1:01:22] Exodus deals with the first part of
[1:01:24] redemption coming out of but the Book of
[1:01:27] Joshua deals with the second part of
[1:01:30] redemption and that is coming into ain't
[1:01:33] that right entering into and and so uh
[1:01:37] uh the the reason for God bringing them
[1:01:40] out of of Egypt was to take them and
[1:01:44] bring them into the land of promise it
[1:01:47] was not God's will for for them to die
[1:01:50] in the wilderness it was not God's will
[1:01:54] amen for them to be carried all off amen
[1:01:56] with Dayan and and Kora and balum and
[1:02:00] and all of that God sent a message to
[1:02:04] take them out and to bring them into and
[1:02:08] and and when God sends something he he
[1:02:11] he's got a reason to do that ain't that
[1:02:13] right amen see and so his his goal was
[1:02:17] his his idea his intention his purpose
[1:02:20] was to take him out and bring them into
[1:02:23] that they could partake of their
[1:02:26] inheritance take them out from slavery
[1:02:29] take them out from bondage take them out
[1:02:32] from a Strange Land and bring them in
[1:02:34] their Homeland not to be defeated not to
[1:02:38] be slaves amen but to possess their
[1:02:43] inheritance amen see now we've talked
[1:02:46] about it inheritance amen is something
[1:02:48] that has been left uh uh uh by someone
[1:02:52] else it's it's it's if you've got an
[1:02:55] inheritance well it was left you uh by
[1:02:58] someone you don't have to work for it
[1:03:00] you don't have to earn it you don't have
[1:03:02] to beg for it uh uh nothing like this
[1:03:05] it's an act of Grace aren't you glad for
[1:03:08] Grace it it's an act of Grace So
[1:03:11] Joshua's Ministry was a Ministry of
[1:03:14] Grace Amen to bring the people into that
[1:03:18] which has been given to them amen it was
[1:03:21] already given amen and they were just to
[1:03:24] come in and under that Ministry Joshua
[1:03:27] would place the people in the land of
[1:03:31] promise in the land of inheritance amen
[1:03:35] so brother brandom says now the book of
[1:03:37] Ephesians placed us positionally in
[1:03:41] Christ what they was in the Holy Land
[1:03:44] see we're not placed in the Holy Land we
[1:03:47] are placed in the Holy Ghost aren't you
[1:03:51] glad for that every promise amen that
[1:03:55] that God has given you is in the land of
[1:03:58] the Holy Ghost amen see now Joshua the
[1:04:02] way he could uh uh uh uh place them in
[1:04:06] positionally in the land he could only
[1:04:08] do that by Revelation he would not do
[1:04:11] that by his own understanding he he it
[1:04:14] wasn't his ideas he wasn't just guessing
[1:04:17] or probing at it he did it by Revelation
[1:04:20] ain't that right now Church no other age
[1:04:23] no other age has has has been has has
[1:04:27] had the privilege of being able to cross
[1:04:30] into the land of promise but this age
[1:04:33] that we're living in amen we we're we're
[1:04:37] this is the age that we are to uh uh
[1:04:39] that we've crossed over into the land of
[1:04:43] inheritance amen see see the church
[1:04:46] could not cross over until the
[1:04:48] denominational ages had run out do you
[1:04:51] believe that amen the denominational
[1:04:54] ages had to run out had to seas in order
[1:04:57] for uh the church to go on into the the
[1:05:01] land of inheritance you know in the
[1:05:04] message uh the seed is not air with the
[1:05:07] Shu uh uh brother brandham talked to
[1:05:09] three women in the Bible and that was
[1:05:11] Hagar Sarah and and Mary and and of
[1:05:16] course you know uh women uh in the Bible
[1:05:19] represent churches a type of churches
[1:05:21] and things like that so brother brandham
[1:05:24] said these three women hey G Sarah and
[1:05:26] Mary were a type of the three
[1:05:29] denominational ages Luther Wesley and
[1:05:33] Pentecost ain't that right amen and he
[1:05:36] says see the women always types churches
[1:05:38] three denominate denominational ages
[1:05:42] carriers which also must die and dry up
[1:05:46] like the shuck and so forth does to give
[1:05:49] room for what the seed ain't that right
[1:05:53] amen see the seed cannot get right or
[1:05:56] ripe rather until the Chuck stock and
[1:05:59] leaves are all dry you know they got to
[1:06:02] be dead every bit of life has got to
[1:06:06] leave it in in order amen uh uh for the
[1:06:10] seed to come together the life gathers
[1:06:13] itself in the seed ain't that right amen
[1:06:16] see and so uh uh what are these
[1:06:19] denomination denominational ages well
[1:06:23] brother Brown said the denominational
[1:06:25] ages he said they they would pick up a
[1:06:27] little Doctrine and then they would one
[1:06:29] would run off to one side with it and
[1:06:32] and and uh and then go off out on a limb
[1:06:36] uh uh with it and they'd say well this
[1:06:37] is it you know nothing else well then
[1:06:40] someone else would pick up another
[1:06:41] little Doctrine and they'd run off to
[1:06:43] that side with it and run off out and on
[1:06:45] a limb with it and say no this is it you
[1:06:47] know and and before you know it it was a
[1:06:50] a fussing and a fighting and and and
[1:06:52] these things and he says each one builds
[1:06:54] a denomination
[1:06:56] under it see denomination did not come
[1:06:58] from from the spirit of God Amen God
[1:07:02] didn't start denomination amen but
[1:07:05] denomination is a result amen of a
[1:07:08] Revival that God produced amen and then
[1:07:12] men would grab a hold of an idea and
[1:07:15] take off with it amen and it wasn't even
[1:07:17] in God's program at all and and then
[1:07:20] they would denominate see and and so he
[1:07:24] says see each one builds a denomination
[1:07:26] under it until we got hundreds of
[1:07:29] denominations but still in all of it to
[1:07:32] see the confusion people are wondering
[1:07:35] what is truth amen it's brought so much
[1:07:39] more confusion amen as to what is truth
[1:07:42] ain't that right well each age each
[1:07:45] Church age had had truth in it but they
[1:07:49] didn't have all of it amen see God would
[1:07:53] bring a little truth amen give a little
[1:07:56] truth irus and St Martin and Columbus
[1:07:59] and and uh uh Martin Luther and Wesley
[1:08:02] and all that brother Brown said they
[1:08:04] live long enough to bring a little light
[1:08:07] a little light to that age to shine that
[1:08:10] little truth to that age ain't that
[1:08:12] right see but then they left many things
[1:08:15] in darkness they they they they they
[1:08:18] didn't have all the truth they they just
[1:08:21] had a little bit of it ain't that right
[1:08:24] amen well then Luther come with his his
[1:08:27] uh uh little light his his Revelation
[1:08:30] and then the Lutheran ran out on a limb
[1:08:33] with it and then you you look at Wesley
[1:08:35] and then the Wesleyan ran off out on a
[1:08:38] limb with it the Pentecostals ran off on
[1:08:41] a limb with with what they had and so
[1:08:44] they ran uh they all ran out on limbs
[1:08:46] you understand what I'm saying see and
[1:08:49] and the prophet said the reason why is
[1:08:51] because the seals had not been broken
[1:08:54] yet the seals had not been broken this
[1:08:58] this word was closed up the
[1:09:00] understanding of this this word was was
[1:09:03] sealed up amen so men probed at it good
[1:09:07] men but but they didn't have all the
[1:09:09] light can you say amen amen and we have
[1:09:13] all these commentators throughout the
[1:09:15] church ages we didn't need a commentator
[1:09:17] we needed a prophet see but but we had
[1:09:21] the commentators and things but and they
[1:09:23] wrote significant thing and and smart
[1:09:26] men but they were only
[1:09:29] probing at it can you say Amen see and
[1:09:32] and so uh uh but but then we find that
[1:09:36] God promised that when these
[1:09:37] denominational ages run out amen when
[1:09:41] when they've when when they've done all
[1:09:43] that they can do and they've run out on
[1:09:45] all the limbs and and all of these
[1:09:48] things then the seventh angel would
[1:09:52] sound amen see now think of that the
[1:09:55] seventh angel with sound then the book
[1:09:59] would be opened can you say amen amen
[1:10:03] the the seven sealed book amen that was
[1:10:06] closed All Through the Ages now would be
[1:10:10] made known now I want to tell you what
[1:10:12] what's the significance of that is this
[1:10:14] is your
[1:10:16] inheritance everything in this book that
[1:10:19] is promised to the church belongs to you
[1:10:23] can you say Amen see so so the prophet
[1:10:26] said the Mysteries are promised to be
[1:10:29] revealed in the end time now notice he
[1:10:33] said see the lamb comes forth to take
[1:10:36] the book now watch to reveal the
[1:10:38] mysteries of God that others have
[1:10:41] guessed that uh uh in in all these
[1:10:44] denominational ages then the seventh
[1:10:47] angel he said see if this book Mysteries
[1:10:50] is the word of God the seventh angel has
[1:10:53] to be a prophet for the word of God to
[1:10:55] come to see the revelation of the word
[1:10:58] see no priests popes or anything else
[1:11:01] can get it see the word doesn't come to
[1:11:03] such the word of God comes only to a
[1:11:06] prophet always Malachi 4 everybody say
[1:11:10] Malachi 4 promise such promise such a
[1:11:14] one ain't that right see and when he
[1:11:17] come forth he' take all the mysteries of
[1:11:19] God where the church had got all
[1:11:21] scrupled up in all these denominations
[1:11:24] and restore the faith of the children
[1:11:26] back to the fathers in the world
[1:11:28] judgment would strike and the Earth
[1:11:29] would be burnt then the righteous would
[1:11:31] walk out upon the ashes of the wicked in
[1:11:33] the Millennium you understand it now see
[1:11:36] others had guessed at in the
[1:11:38] denominational age but this see he must
[1:11:43] be this man the seventh angel of
[1:11:45] Revelations 10 1-4 the seventh angel has
[1:11:49] the mysteries of God given to him and
[1:11:52] finishes all the mystery then left off
[1:11:55] down through the denominational ages can
[1:11:58] you say Amen so the denominational ages
[1:12:01] ceases amen and a People amen now stands
[1:12:06] in this age not confused not uh uh
[1:12:12] wondering what is truth and what is not
[1:12:15] amen they're they're not a part of them
[1:12:18] denominationally they're not part of
[1:12:19] that confusion they're can you say amen
[1:12:22] amen see so he says see if it's he said
[1:12:26] you see why I I do not strike at my
[1:12:28] brethren in denominational uh
[1:12:30] denomination it's the system of
[1:12:33] denomination see he said there's no need
[1:12:35] of them trying to know it because it
[1:12:37] cannot be revealed see it could not be
[1:12:40] revealed that's according to the word
[1:12:42] they presumed at it and believed it was
[1:12:44] there and by faith walked by it but now
[1:12:47] it is evidently proved can you say Amen
[1:12:51] now what is the importance of the
[1:12:53] seventh Angel's message it it is it
[1:12:56] brings on another Ephesians it brings on
[1:13:00] it's not just another Ministry that has
[1:13:02] come and and and a special Ministry like
[1:13:05] o Roberts and Billy Graham and and T
[1:13:07] osbor and Jack Cole and AA Allen and all
[1:13:11] these things and and and you've got even
[1:13:13] great ministers up today TD Jake Benny
[1:13:15] henss and and and and what whatever else
[1:13:18] you know out there amen that that are
[1:13:20] there but this was the seventh angel
[1:13:23] sounding
[1:13:25] a man to bring on another
[1:13:29] Ephesians can you say Amen not a man
[1:13:32] coming and standing here and Confused
[1:13:35] upon the Bible and and Confused upon
[1:13:38] what is truth and what isn't truth and
[1:13:40] and speaking his own ideas and speaking
[1:13:42] his own ways and his own opinion no
[1:13:45] nothing like that can you say Amen not
[1:13:48] because of Theologian could not bring on
[1:13:50] an Ephesians it could not bring the
[1:13:52] church into the land of promise and
[1:13:54] positionally place them in the land of
[1:13:56] promise it could not we needed somebody
[1:13:59] under an inspiration that could take us
[1:14:02] over now brother brandom said we're
[1:14:04] promised according to Revelations 10
[1:14:07] according to Malachi 4 and St Luke
[1:14:11] 2217 uh uh uh and so forth uh and he
[1:14:16] says that there has got to come an
[1:14:18] Ephesians to this can you say Amen
[1:14:21] what's going to bring the Ephesians amen
[1:14:24] when Revelations 101 through uh SE 7 is
[1:14:29] is fulfilled amen when re uh Luke 17:30
[1:14:33] is fulfilled when Malachi 4 is fulfilled
[1:14:37] and all these scriptures in there is
[1:14:40] promising the church and Ephesians when
[1:14:43] Malachi 4 comes there's going to be an
[1:14:45] Ephesians to this when Revelations 10:1
[1:14:49] amen through seven is fulfilled there is
[1:14:51] an Ephesians amen that comes to the
[1:14:54] church I hope you understand he said
[1:14:57] there is promised it uh friends he said
[1:15:00] there must come an Ephesians that the
[1:15:03] Sevenfold Mysteries of the word of God
[1:15:06] must be unfolded and it's in the Le
[1:15:10] oysan age that this takes place can you
[1:15:13] say Amen now we have come through uh a
[1:15:18] denominational age uh seven Church ages
[1:15:22] or whatever you want to call it and
[1:15:24] brother bandam says it's in that denom
[1:15:27] denominational age that Satan's works
[1:15:30] are exalted above God's word and
[1:15:33] manifested works he said the wisdom of
[1:15:36] Satan is exalted to the throne of
[1:15:37] worship in man above the Vindicated word
[1:15:40] of God for the hour our churches proves
[1:15:44] that by their seminaries and schools of
[1:15:46] learning that's learned more than God's
[1:15:48] word knows about it see they think see
[1:15:51] and they're doctor so and so and teacher
[1:15:53] so and so and professor so and so has
[1:15:56] exalted their own Knowledge socalled
[1:15:58] from Satan see so-called truth above the
[1:16:01] Vindicated promise of God made clear
[1:16:04] right before them and man falls for it
[1:16:08] can you say Amen so that's that's in
[1:16:10] them denominational ages it's man
[1:16:12] exalting himself under the inspiration
[1:16:15] of Satan and exalting their own opinion
[1:16:18] exalting their own Works above the
[1:16:20] Vindicated works of God and and the word
[1:16:23] of God can you say man and so brother
[1:16:25] Brandon said Satan is trying to prove
[1:16:28] God Wrong by his scientific achievements
[1:16:32] he said man's theology explains God's
[1:16:35] word to the people and makes it of no
[1:16:38] effect again like he had it in the
[1:16:40] denominational age when Jesus appeared
[1:16:43] on the earth remember that Jesus told
[1:16:46] them there in Mark 713 you have made the
[1:16:49] word of God of no effect through your
[1:16:53] tradition and brother Brown said that's
[1:16:55] their interpretation ain't that right by
[1:16:57] their in own interpretation they've made
[1:17:00] the word of God of no effect ain't that
[1:17:03] right now this tells us that Caleb was
[1:17:06] not part of
[1:17:08] that amen he was not part of that it it
[1:17:11] was the other spies that was part of
[1:17:13] that because they believe they man uh
[1:17:16] the people believe the 10 spies and that
[1:17:19] said they exalted their own word their
[1:17:22] own knowledge above the word of God and
[1:17:24] God God said you're able to take it and
[1:17:27] the people says oh we're not able to
[1:17:28] take it amen God says there's the
[1:17:31] promises there that you're inheritance
[1:17:33] amen and the people and the 10 spies got
[1:17:35] the people to believe it that they
[1:17:37] couldn't take it and that that there was
[1:17:39] no way they could overcome and and there
[1:17:41] was no way that they could live
[1:17:42] Victorious you understand what I'm
[1:17:44] saying and they died they died because
[1:17:47] they refused to take God at his word
[1:17:51] ain't that right see and so but Caleb
[1:17:54] now notice he says we we brother Brown
[1:17:57] says see we've gone through that
[1:17:58] denominational age but now everybody say
[1:18:01] but now we have come to a free age
[1:18:05] everybody say free age not a
[1:18:07] denominational age but a free age we're
[1:18:11] not part of denomination we're not tied
[1:18:13] to a denominational age amen we are part
[1:18:17] of a free age we've come to a free age
[1:18:21] where the Holy Spirit himself comes down
[1:18:24] and vindicates himself and makes himself
[1:18:27] known notice and makes every promise
[1:18:30] that he promised come to pass can you
[1:18:34] say Amen well that's what Caleb was amen
[1:18:37] the every promise that God promised did
[1:18:39] not come to pass in the wilderness it
[1:18:41] did not come to pass in Egypt oh yeah
[1:18:44] God God brought them out and God done
[1:18:46] all these things but the real
[1:18:48] fulfillment of the word of God was in
[1:18:50] the promised land can you say Amen now
[1:18:54] the church the church has had to wait
[1:18:57] until this time before it could enter
[1:19:00] into this second part of redemption you
[1:19:04] see the Joshua Ministry uh uh uh which
[1:19:07] is the end time message of the hour has
[1:19:11] come to take us over aren't you glad for
[1:19:13] that young people listen to me now amen
[1:19:17] that word this message God has sent this
[1:19:20] message to you to take you over take you
[1:19:23] over you're not like them out there

[1:19:31] and got their fancy things and their
[1:19:34] lights and and made a a a a show out of
[1:19:37] the house of God you're not like those
[1:19:40] things you should not want to be like
[1:19:41] those things Amen to dress like Jezebels
[1:19:45] and to dress like like the world and and
[1:19:48] and and all these things aren't you glad
[1:19:50] that that God took you know took a
[1:19:52] prophet and took the shorts off of us
[1:19:54] guys where we wouldn't act like sissies
[1:19:56] and and and and and taught us how to
[1:19:58] dress and taught us how to live and and
[1:20:01] taught he he he cut us away from all the
[1:20:04] denominational uh to where we now know
[1:20:07] that we have the truth in the right
[1:20:09] baptism and we know that there the truth
[1:20:12] as to what God kind of a God and how
[1:20:14] many gods there really are we know the
[1:20:17] truth we're not standing here confused
[1:20:20] we have the
[1:20:21] truth we have the truth we have the
[1:20:24] truth that we're not just Baptists or
[1:20:26] Pentecostals and identifying with some
[1:20:29] man-made Creed but we are the sons and
[1:20:33] daughters of God in this age we're not
[1:20:36] part of that denominational system can
[1:20:38] you say Amen so this end time message
[1:20:41] this Joshua Ministry has come to take us
[1:20:44] over and to positionally place us in our
[1:20:49] land our
[1:20:51] land hallelujah hallelujah now notice
[1:20:54] the message this message of the hour has
[1:20:57] brought forth a
[1:20:59] resurrection out of dark
[1:21:02] denominationalism and has brought us
[1:21:05] into the bright age our
[1:21:08] Canaan can you say Amen where a free age
[1:21:13] where the holy spirit is free to move
[1:21:16] the holy spirit is free to act the Holy
[1:21:20] Spirit has the preeminence can you say
[1:21:23] amen amen yes sir it Amen brother Bram
[1:21:28] said the full maturity of the word has
[1:21:30] turned back again in its full power full
[1:21:34] power it is not touched by denominations
[1:21:37] it's not tarnished it's not it's not cut
[1:21:40] and and spliced and taken out and added
[1:21:44] to and and all of that no no the full
[1:21:47] maturity of the word can you say that
[1:21:50] with me the full maturity of the word
[1:21:53] has turned back back again in full
[1:21:57] power it's full power and it's being
[1:22:00] waved over the People by the same signs
[1:22:03] and wonders that Jesus did back
[1:22:06] there now I really hope I'm making some
[1:22:09] kind of a sense to you
[1:22:11] today amen the Canaan land the full word
[1:22:16] not partial word full word oh word amen
[1:22:20] not not not just a Ministry but the same
[1:22:23] Ministry that Jesus had now is in the
[1:22:28] church can you say Amen notice the full
[1:22:31] maturity of the word has come in its
[1:22:35] full power yes sir now when Luther came
[1:22:39] he left the Catholic
[1:22:40] age when Wesley come he left the
[1:22:43] Lutheran age when Pentecost come and we
[1:22:47] say the Pentecostal age he left the
[1:22:49] wesleyian age can you say Amen now that
[1:22:53] that uh uh the Le ought to seean age or
[1:22:55] whatever see so so the Holy Spirit fell
[1:22:59] in
[1:23:00] 1906 and that's when the church moved on
[1:23:03] out of Wesleyan age into the Pentecostal
[1:23:05] age can you say Amen what was the
[1:23:09] Pentecostal age now people thought that
[1:23:11] that was the complete restoration it was
[1:23:14] not the complete restoration am it was
[1:23:17] only a restoration of gifts can you say
[1:23:22] Amen uh uh back into the church so it
[1:23:26] was not the fullness of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:30] and it wasn't the restoration of
[1:23:33] power can you say Amen if it was then it
[1:23:38] would have brought forth the
[1:23:39] manifestation of the sons of
[1:23:41] God but it did not bring forth the
[1:23:45] manifestation of sons of God Amen see
[1:23:48] the Pentecostal age only restored the
[1:23:50] gifts back into the church brother Bram
[1:23:52] said speaking in tongues gifts of
[1:23:54] healing and things to the church see and
[1:23:57] they did they did exactly what the
[1:24:00] scriptures said they would do and when
[1:24:02] they did they manifested it ain't that
[1:24:04] right but notice brother Brown says but
[1:24:06] do you realize we've moved on from that
[1:24:12] amen if Pentecostal age if 1906 was the
[1:24:16] fullness of restoration then there would
[1:24:19] be no need to move on but a prophet says
[1:24:23] we moved on
[1:24:25] we moved on well there's no other Church
[1:24:29] there's no other age outside the
[1:24:32] Pentecostal age but brother God would
[1:24:34] God would through the prophet would tell
[1:24:36] us there is an age and that's a bright
[1:24:40] age a bride age what is it we're moving
[1:24:44] on into an eternal
[1:24:46] age can you say Amen so he says see but
[1:24:50] did you realize we've moved on from that
[1:24:53] we are in the bride time the selecting
[1:24:57] time the time that the bride they said
[1:25:00] we would have see all the C all the
[1:25:03] caterpillar left said Joel 2:28 the
[1:25:06] Palmer worm eaten and the what all the
[1:25:09] palmerworm left the Locust eaten see
[1:25:11] each one of those organizations if
[1:25:13] you've read the Seven Seals of the Bible
[1:25:15] each one of those reformers went forth
[1:25:18] and preach the word but left something
[1:25:19] off then what did they do after the
[1:25:22] reformers over um and the light uh began
[1:25:27] to dim out instead of walking on into
[1:25:29] further light they organized
[1:25:32] denominational age right see and when
[1:25:34] they organized that we believe this
[1:25:36] light see this is the light this is it
[1:25:39] see and what did they do Wesley come
[1:25:41] right on and moved away from them what
[1:25:43] did Wesley do he organized after him uh
[1:25:46] his brother John and Charles and Along
[1:25:49] come Asbury and all those see and after
[1:25:52] their days they organized what was
[1:25:54] called the Methodist Church what did
[1:25:55] they do they rejected further light they
[1:25:58] just said you know this is the light
[1:26:00] this is it then come along the
[1:26:01] Pentecostal and show them up that God
[1:26:04] still sends down the baptism of the Holy
[1:26:06] Ghost he still brings down his power of
[1:26:09] healing which they've denied and what
[1:26:11] did they do walked right away from them
[1:26:13] because it was another light but what is
[1:26:16] it now what is it
[1:26:18] now he says see we passed around 60
[1:26:21] years the Pentecostals has organ ized we
[1:26:24] are this we are that and God has walked
[1:26:28] away from it out in Yonder and bringing
[1:26:32] forth a
[1:26:33] bride can you say Amen a bride and elect
[1:26:38] out of that group which there will never
[1:26:41] be another church age naal age there'll
[1:26:45] never be another age that we pass on to
[1:26:47] another to another no you are that one
[1:26:51] you are that
[1:26:52] Caleb the finally cross over Jordan into
[1:26:56] the promised land and receive the
[1:26:59] benefits of The
[1:27:02] Inheritance can you say amen amen see so
[1:27:06] he says there there will never be
[1:27:07] another church age the Philadelphian
[1:27:09] Church age was Wesley the leysan church
[1:27:11] age is the Pentecostal organization not
[1:27:14] the bride Pentecostal
[1:27:18] organization can you say Amen we're not
[1:27:21] part of that Pentecostal organization
[1:27:23] amen
[1:27:25] yes sir so brother Brandon would
[1:27:26] identify us in our part is a bride
[1:27:31] age can you say Amen good so so the lsan
[1:27:35] church age is the Pentecostal
[1:27:37] organization which all goes right
[1:27:39] straight into the mark of the beast but
[1:27:42] we're not going
[1:27:44] there we're not part of
[1:27:47] that amen can you say amen amen see
[1:27:51] that's the Bible as this brother was
[1:27:52] saying a few minutes ago is true right
[1:27:55] they're they're all them organizations
[1:27:57] because they refuse to walk in further
[1:27:59] light they organized themselves saying
[1:28:01] we believe this and when God does
[1:28:03] something check it with the scripture
[1:28:05] the Pharisees said we have it the
[1:28:07] Sadducees said we have it but God had it
[1:28:11] and God has turned on the key and showed
[1:28:14] the light it was rejected like it's
[1:28:16] always been the Catholic Church rejected
[1:28:18] Luther Wesley rejected Luther see uh and
[1:28:22] and so also the Pentecost
[1:28:24] rejected Wesley and the Holy Spirit
[1:28:27] today is rejecting the Pentecostals see
[1:28:30] you're just you're getting just as
[1:28:32] formal and cold as the rest of them and
[1:28:34] we know that to be truth years later we
[1:28:38] know that the Pentecostal are sitting
[1:28:41] dead
[1:28:42] cold
[1:28:46] formal can you say Amen so then where
[1:28:49] are we at what's our season it's seed
[1:28:52] time can you say that with me it's seed
[1:28:55] time it's seed time now what does that
[1:28:58] mean well each dip or each age had a dip
[1:29:01] of the Holy Ghost had a portion of the
[1:29:04] Holy Ghost each age had a portion it's
[1:29:06] just like it was in the Old Testament
[1:29:09] each age had a portion of the Holy
[1:29:10] Spirit and and each uh uh each
[1:29:13] manifested the word alloted for their
[1:29:16] day and and Elijah had a portion David
[1:29:19] had a portion Jeremiah had a portion
[1:29:22] amen they all had a portion
[1:29:25] of the Holy Spirit and and notice they
[1:29:27] all spoke of Messiah to come ain't that
[1:29:31] right their lives spoke of the Messiah
[1:29:33] their word spoke of the Messiah amen
[1:29:36] they were all looking for messiah to
[1:29:38] come they spoke of what he would do and
[1:29:40] what he would be and all that but then
[1:29:43] there come a time amen that the word
[1:29:47] became in its in
[1:29:49] fullness the word the entire word amen
[1:29:54] of the Old Testament speaking of Messiah
[1:29:57] became
[1:29:59] flesh can you say amen amen the word
[1:30:02] came in fullness full manifestation
[1:30:05] brother BR said the entire word
[1:30:07] everybody say the entire word was made
[1:30:09] flesh Among Us the entire word was made
[1:30:13] flesh Among Us so no longer just
[1:30:16] teaching about it no longer singing
[1:30:18] about it but now it was being lived one
[1:30:23] man Liv living what Isaiah said one man
[1:30:27] living what Jeremiah had prophesied one
[1:30:30] man living what Moses had predicted and
[1:30:33] prophesied one man living what Abel had
[1:30:37] typed out and and and and all uh uh
[1:30:40] these these uh prophets and sages of old
[1:30:44] had had lived out and prophesied and
[1:30:46] sung about promise upon promise upon
[1:30:49] promise upon promise was being fulfilled
[1:30:52] in one man
[1:30:56] because the entire word had now come
[1:31:01] flesh amen can you say
[1:31:04] Amen what was Jesus Christ brother Brown
[1:31:08] said he was all what the prophets were
[1:31:12] plus everybody say plus the rest of
[1:31:16] God that's right he was all that the
[1:31:19] prophets were plus the rest of God
[1:31:22] that's good right amen now Luke 17:30
[1:31:26] tells
[1:31:27] us that the son of man is going to be
[1:31:30] revealed again
[1:31:33] amen and the day when he would be
[1:31:35] revealed would be the days a day like
[1:31:38] the days of Noah in the days of lot
[1:31:41] ain't that right and we could all truly
[1:31:44] say as Bible Believers and message
[1:31:46] Believers that we're living in that day
[1:31:49] amen and you say Amen what does that
[1:31:52] mean we have come
[1:31:54] back to the full
[1:31:56] maturity of the word as it was when he
[1:32:01] walked the Earth yes hello amen every
[1:32:06] promise that has been spoken of this
[1:32:08] bride is our
[1:32:10] [Applause]
[1:32:12] inheritance do you believe
[1:32:14] that yes sir it's our inheritance I
[1:32:18] believe it amen hallelujah all that God
[1:32:22] was he poured into Christ yes sir all
[1:32:24] that Christ was he poured into the
[1:32:27] church so the word is being made flesh
[1:32:30] in our flesh right and the prophet said
[1:32:33] with the restoration of the word comes
[1:32:36] the restoration of
[1:32:37] power the full word brings full
[1:32:41] power can you say Amen or we could say
[1:32:44] full
[1:32:45] Authority full Authority so what are we
[1:32:48] talking about
[1:32:50] adoption to where you you you your name
[1:32:55] is just as good as the father's name
[1:32:58] Amen on the check Hallelujah can you say
[1:33:02] Amen the father has been running his
[1:33:05] business he's been conducting it
[1:33:08] everyone is having to talk to the father
[1:33:10] yeah about things and the father writes
[1:33:13] out the checks and the father does this
[1:33:15] and this and that amen but the time of
[1:33:18] adoption he steps back and the son comes
[1:33:22] forward and everyone has to answer to
[1:33:25] the son it's the son writing his name on
[1:33:29] the check it's his it's the son
[1:33:32] conducting the business as the father
[1:33:35] did why because the authority has now
[1:33:38] been given to the
[1:33:40] son can you say amen amen Pentecost uh
[1:33:44] 1906 did not bring the manifestation of
[1:33:46] sons of God it's in this age by the
[1:33:50] message of the hour has brought us into
[1:33:54] an
[1:33:55] Ephesians placing Us in the land and
[1:33:59] giving us the authority to claim our
[1:34:04] inheritance amen hallelujah do you
[1:34:07] believe that so what is the bride of
[1:34:09] Christ she is all that fell on the day
[1:34:12] of Pentecost plus the rest of God glory
[1:34:17] can you say amen amen did you know the
[1:34:20] day of Pentecost did not reveal the son
[1:34:22] of man that's right I know there's a
[1:34:23] teaching that that says that it was the
[1:34:26] son of man revealed on the day of
[1:34:27] Pentecost that's that's wrong brother
[1:34:29] Bram never taught it the Bible never
[1:34:31] taught it there's only one promise of
[1:34:33] the son being revealed again and that's
[1:34:35] in this age Luke
[1:34:38] 17:30 brother Brandon said when he
[1:34:40] returned on Pentecost he was the son of
[1:34:42] God again on the day of Pentecost in
[1:34:44] another place on the day of Pentecost
[1:34:46] the word came and was in the form of Son
[1:34:48] of God another place we find after his
[1:34:51] death burial and Resurrection he came on
[1:34:54] the day of Pentecost as Son of God God
[1:34:57] the spirit in the form of Holy Ghost
[1:35:00] what was he doing he was changing
[1:35:02] himself making himself known to his
[1:35:03] people in a different form like the Holy
[1:35:06] Spirit which is God he came to deal
[1:35:08] through the church ages as Son of God
[1:35:11] the Holy Spirit on another place on the
[1:35:14] day of Pentecost he changed himself from
[1:35:16] being son of man to the Son of God can
[1:35:20] you say Amen but in this age it's been
[1:35:23] promise that the Son of God would be
[1:35:26] changed back to son of man again the
[1:35:29] fullness of the word would now be made
[1:35:33] flesh not in one man but in a multiple
[1:35:37] group of people that is part of the body
[1:35:41] of Jesus Christ The Authority that Jesus
[1:35:44] had to do the works you've got that
[1:35:46] authority to do them same Works sir I
[1:35:50] hope you understand that Authority
[1:35:54] that's where we're living Hallelujah
[1:35:55] bright age what is it the fullness of
[1:35:58] God returned the fullness of the word
[1:36:01] the full manifestation of the power not
[1:36:05] in a man called Jesus Christ but in a me
[1:36:08] many membered body can you say Amen in
[1:36:12] sons of God Daughters of God who make up
[1:36:15] the bride of
[1:36:17] Christ
[1:36:19] amen if you
[1:36:21] notice brother Braham said God is
[1:36:24] calling a church to Perfection that's
[1:36:26] right by his word by his word think of
[1:36:32] that calling his church to
[1:36:37] Perfection What kind of a Perfection
[1:36:39] sinless Perfection
[1:36:45] no a
[1:36:48] Perfection that every part of the word
[1:36:52] that has been spoken of the
[1:36:56] Bride has come to
[1:36:58] manifestation a Perfection can you say
[1:37:01] amen that's
[1:37:03] right Jesus was that perfect
[1:37:07] Masterpiece God dwelt in that body the
[1:37:11] fullness of God dwelt in that body on
[1:37:14] ain't that right sinless
[1:37:18] perfect body yes hello
[1:37:24] he fulfilled all the word that was
[1:37:27] promised of him so much that Jesus said
[1:37:30] search the
[1:37:33] scriptures for in them you think you
[1:37:35] have eternal life but they testify of me
[1:37:39] the church couldn't testify of him the
[1:37:41] bishop couldn't testify of him and he
[1:37:44] wouldn't appeal to that denomination to
[1:37:46] testify of him because they called him a
[1:37:48] be elub they called him this and they
[1:37:51] called him that and ended up crucifying
[1:37:53] but Jesus could take his ministry his
[1:37:56] life back to the word all right and tell
[1:38:00] them I'm identified here amen and so is
[1:38:03] it in this bride today we are identified
[1:38:06] here every promise every promise so
[1:38:09] here's the fullness of the word the lamb
[1:38:12] opened that book and as we know amen
[1:38:15] John wept amen he wept because if no man
[1:38:19] was worthy to open that book all
[1:38:21] creation would be lost amen there would
[1:38:23] be no way that we could come into that
[1:38:25] inheritance there'd be no way that we
[1:38:27] could come in and claim what is
[1:38:29] rightfully ours we would be doomed all
[1:38:31] creation will be doomed creation is
[1:38:34] waiting for the manifestation of sons of
[1:38:36] God because we are the head of creation
[1:38:39] man is the head of creation when man
[1:38:41] fell everything under him fell with him
[1:38:44] but when he is restored everything is
[1:38:46] restored with him can you say amen and
[1:38:49] so John knew that it was important for
[1:38:51] this book to be open and and when the
[1:38:53] lamb opened the book John began to shout
[1:38:57] and scream and what a worship brother
[1:38:59] brand said it was time for worship ain't
[1:39:02] that right and he says John done so he
[1:39:05] worshiped he screamed he hollered he
[1:39:07] said he must have saw his name he must
[1:39:11] have been able to identify with every
[1:39:15] promise he saw the promises for what it
[1:39:17] was and it become a personal he saw his
[1:39:22] inheritance
[1:39:25] that's right he saw that he had
[1:39:28] inherited you're not bound for hell
[1:39:31] you've got an inheritance amen you're
[1:39:33] not bound for Destruction you've got an
[1:39:36] inheritance praise the Lord can you say
[1:39:39] amen amen oh do you love him so now God
[1:39:43] is calling a church to Perfection by his
[1:39:46] word and she will be perfectly
[1:39:50] restored by the opening of the seven
[1:39:53] sealed book do you believe that amen
[1:39:56] amen yes
[1:39:57] sir amen so brother Bram said what good
[1:40:00] would have done Martin Luther to
[1:40:03] continue on with the Catholic message
[1:40:05] what good would it done Wesley to
[1:40:07] continue on with the Lutheran message
[1:40:09] what good would have done the
[1:40:10] Pentecostals to continue on with the
[1:40:12] Methodist message or what good will it
[1:40:15] do Pentecost to continue on with the
[1:40:17] brides when the brides being called
[1:40:20] we're right up into the seed time we're
[1:40:22] here at the in time another place if I
[1:40:25] taught you a Methodist message it would
[1:40:27] take no effect on you this is bright
[1:40:29] time that's why we cannot mix Methodist
[1:40:32] with the with the message of the
[1:40:35] hour can you say amen that's not our
[1:40:40] inheritance can you say Amen so he says
[1:40:43] if Moses taught the message of Noah it
[1:40:45] would take no effect if Jesus taught
[1:40:47] Moses message it would take no effect
[1:40:49] because the predestinated seed are
[1:40:51] laying there that will only be watered
[1:40:54] by that type of water that's GI for that
[1:40:56] seed you understand what I'm saying if
[1:40:59] you are a predestinated seed for this
[1:41:01] age there's only one thing that can
[1:41:03] water that and that's the message of
[1:41:05] this
[1:41:06] hour it's the only way you you cannot
[1:41:09] stay in the Pentecostal age and be
[1:41:13] content with what they
[1:41:16] had
[1:41:18] amen it's called for further light it's
[1:41:22] called for the mature purity of the seed
[1:41:25] and only the message can do that for us
[1:41:29] can you say Amen another place the end
[1:41:31] time message should meet end time
[1:41:33] conditions where they've got off the
[1:41:36] message ought to bring it back always
[1:41:38] the end time message meets end time
[1:41:40] conditions all the way through the
[1:41:42] scripture it'll have to do it this time
[1:41:45] a call back to the original
[1:41:48] word not inheriting
[1:41:51] some doctrine of man we're not here
[1:41:54] inheriting some
[1:41:55] theology some Creed or whatever you want
[1:41:58] to call it we are inheriting what has
[1:42:02] been left
[1:42:04] us from the foundation of the world God
[1:42:08] has purposed in his mind before the
[1:42:10] foundation of the world to give you
[1:42:12] everything that you
[1:42:14] need he already purpose he's
[1:42:17] predestinated you to be Sons and
[1:42:20] Daughters of God it's written in the
[1:42:21] book yes amen can you say amen
[1:42:25] hallelujah he's predestinated you to be
[1:42:28] justified called
[1:42:30] glorified it's already
[1:42:35] there so he says this is not a
[1:42:38] Pentecostal age this is the latterday
[1:42:40] age this is the bright age this is the
[1:42:43] evening light this is when Malachi 4
[1:42:45] must be fulfilled to follow God's
[1:42:47] pattern and I will say to you brother
[1:42:49] Brandon was not the only one to fulfill
[1:42:51] Malachi 4 that's right
[1:42:54] he was the prophet of Malachi 4 but
[1:42:57] there was a people that was to have
[1:42:59] their hearts turned back to the original
[1:43:02] Faith by his
[1:43:05] message we're part of Malachi 4 and that
[1:43:09] Malachi 4 is being fulfilled amen
[1:43:13] hallelujah that's the truth so he says
[1:43:16] see we're not living in a Pentecostal
[1:43:18] age we're living in another age we're
[1:43:21] not living in a Methodist age we're
[1:43:22] living in another age we're living on up
[1:43:25] here to the bright age the calling out
[1:43:28] of the church and getting it together
[1:43:29] for the Rapture not getting it together
[1:43:32] for tribulation not getting it together
[1:43:34] for World Council of churches not
[1:43:36] getting it together for for the grave
[1:43:39] amen but getting us together ready for
[1:43:42] the Rapture the Rapture is our
[1:43:44] inheritance the Bible says so we that
[1:43:47] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[1:43:50] together with them uh in the air
[1:43:54] amen praise the Lord bless the name of
[1:43:57] the
[1:43:58] Lord I love it so he says that's the age
[1:44:02] that we're now living in to my honest
[1:44:04] opinion that's exactly the truth amen so
[1:44:07] this is not Luther's age this is not
[1:44:09] Pentecost age this is bride age bride
[1:44:12] age as Moses called a nation out of a
[1:44:15] Nation Christ today is calling a church
[1:44:17] out of a church you see the same thing
[1:44:20] in type taking them to the glory Eternal
[1:44:24] Promised Land Hallelujah do you love
[1:44:27] him another place I'm coming to you with
[1:44:30] the message that that sign Vindicated
[1:44:33] what did the church he said no it never
[1:44:35] denominated but what happened to the
[1:44:37] denominations over this revival what did
[1:44:39] they do they went straight into
[1:44:42] Leota amen millions and millions and
[1:44:45] billions of dollars poured into it and
[1:44:48] she's become Big and Rich and she builds
[1:44:51] millions of dollars worth of property
[1:44:53] and things like that and to receive the
[1:44:55] message no indeed they turn it away what
[1:44:59] is it it's the husk pulling away from
[1:45:02] the
[1:45:03] wheat that Pentecostal husk is pulling
[1:45:07] away so that you can ripen into every
[1:45:12] promise that God has for you amen oh
[1:45:15] church I hope you understand everything
[1:45:18] that Jesus Christ died for Belongs To
[1:45:20] You Right do you believe it I believe
[1:45:23] that's where our faith ought to be right
[1:45:24] now don't walk with your head down walk
[1:45:29] with your head up don't walk like a
[1:45:32] beggar walk as though you are as a Son
[1:45:35] of God for you are a son of God and if
[1:45:39] you are a son of God you are air to
[1:45:41] everything that belongs to Christ that
[1:45:44] Christ died for it's yours amen
[1:45:47] everything hallu everything can you say
[1:45:50] amen he said see so the the
[1:45:53] husk pulling away from the wheat now the
[1:45:57] wheat must be that way to lay in the
[1:46:00] presence of the sun why must it lay in
[1:46:03] the present Sun you are that wheat

[1:46:52] Full Gospel
[1:46:53] now notice then what does he mean by
[1:46:56] Full Gospel well brother Brown said what
[1:46:58] the Full Gospel means is to express
[1:47:02] Jesus Christ in the power of his
[1:47:05] resurrection and all the fullness of his
[1:47:07] promises that the Holy Ghost manifest
[1:47:10] these things and make them right that
[1:47:12] God has promised and he will do it you
[1:47:16] see what God would send the message for
[1:47:18] you see the power of this message to

[1:47:21] message and turn away from unbelief and
[1:47:24] everything in your life and lay hold to
[1:47:27] this message it's turning you to the
[1:47:29] Full Gospel where Jesus Christ is
[1:47:32] manifesting himself in you in the power
[1:47:35] of his resurrection and every promise he
[1:47:39] promised in this bride to this bride is

[1:47:56] brother Braham said the Holy Spirit has
[1:47:58] come upon us in the last days and
[1:48:00] identified himself right in our church
[1:48:03] and has proven the same works that he
[1:48:05] did when he was here in the fullness
[1:48:08] Upon Jesus Christ he did the same thing
[1:48:10] upon the bride and doing the same thing
[1:48:14] do you believe that do you believe
[1:48:16] you're part of that well some of you do
[1:48:20] amen we're part of that the same power
[1:48:23] that Jesus had not that Paul had I thank
[1:48:27] God for what Paul had I thank God for
[1:48:29] what they received on the day of
[1:48:31] Pentecost amen but it didn't bring forth
[1:48:33] the ministry of Jesus Christ it did not
[1:48:36] produce son of man it's in this day that
[1:48:40] you have been given the privilege to
[1:48:43] become the manifested sons of God to
[1:48:46] take the authority over the devil and

[1:49:11] Hallelujah death has no hold upon that
[1:49:15] believer do you believe it the Holy
[1:49:18] Ghost has come upon us in this last day
[1:49:21] and identified him self right in our
[1:49:24] church proving the same works that he
[1:49:27] did when he's here in fullness Upon
[1:49:29] Jesus Christ he is doing the same thing
[1:49:32] upon the bride ify musicians will
[1:49:37] come brother Bram said another place the
[1:49:40] last thing that the church is going to
[1:49:41] see is Christ manifested in his power in
[1:49:45] fullness in his church just before the
[1:49:48] fire falls and if you're sitting here
[1:49:50] waiting for that and you're saying well
[1:49:52] that's going to come don't you let that
[1:49:54] pass you by look for it now now can you
[1:49:59] say Amen if there's anything that's
[1:50:01] holding you back any unbelief take that
[1:50:04] thing and destroy it take bitterness and

[1:50:33] him wonderful
[1:50:35] Hallelujah yes sir so what does it do it
[1:50:39] makes you an overcomer for now you've
[1:50:42] come into the age of
[1:50:44] overcoming makes you an overcomer that's
[1:50:47] right just like Caleb did when he had
[1:50:49] nothing to overcome in that Wilderness
[1:50:51] he had nothing to overcome Amen in Egypt
[1:50:54] or whatever you want to call it amen all
[1:50:56] the way through there was nothing he
[1:50:58] wasn't possessing anything in Egypt he
[1:51:00] wasn't possessing anything in Esau's
[1:51:02] land moab's land balam's land uh uh uh
[1:51:06] whatever land he was he was walking
[1:51:08] through he he wasn't possessing nothing
[1:51:10] it was not his inheritance but when he
[1:51:12] come over into that Promised Land he
[1:51:15] become the
[1:51:16] Overcomer yes sir as I've told you last
[1:51:18] Wednesday that's when the Giants that's
[1:51:21] when the enemy become more real than
[1:51:23] anything in in that Journey it become
[1:51:26] more real to him when he walked into
[1:51:28] that Promised Land there they were
[1:51:30] guarding his inheritance trying to keep
[1:51:32] him away from that inheritance they were
[1:51:34] inhabiting that inheritance and now he
[1:51:38] had to look at them and command them to
[1:51:40] leave whatever it would take he had to
[1:51:43] deal with that enemy you understand what
[1:51:45] I'm saying it's in this age that every
[1:51:47] demon power has been Unleashed in this
[1:51:49] age because there's a people that have
[1:51:51] crossed over over into that promised
[1:51:54] land land of
[1:51:57] inheritance but as I've said before it
[1:52:00] wasn't up to Caleb to fight that
[1:52:03] giant it wasn't up to Caleb no God was
[1:52:07] with him God had already promised I'll
[1:52:10] go before you I'll drive him out I'll go
[1:52:14] before you so really what he was doing
[1:52:16] what Caleb was doing was dealing with a
[1:52:17] defeated enemy God had went before them
[1:52:21] and now Cale was just dealing with a
[1:52:23] defeated enemy and so are you dealing
[1:52:26] with the defeated enemy that enemy ain't
[1:52:29] got no power over you ain't got no say
