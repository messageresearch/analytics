[9:20] thank you, Lord God, for watching over
[9:22] us today. Lord, the last several days
[9:25] since we've been in service. Oh God,
[9:26] you've been so good, Lord. You kept us
[9:29] safe on highways, Lord, while we're
[9:31] working, while we're sleeping. Lord, we
[9:34] thank you, Father God. Lord, only
[9:36] eternity will reveal the many times that
[9:40] you kept us safe, Lord, while we slept,
[9:43] Lord, or while the enemy tried to creep
[9:45] up on us and you put us shelter. Your
[9:48] angels were watching over us, God. We
[9:50] thank you for that. We thank you for our

[14:01] Praise the Lord. You love the Lord
[14:02] tonight.
[14:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Good to have our brother with us
[14:05] tonight. Brother, I'm sorry I don't You
[14:07] told me your name,
[14:10] John. Good to have brother John. How
[14:12] many appreciates Brother John here
[14:14] tonight? Here he is on a Wednesday
[14:16] night, a student at Virginia Tech. He's
[14:18] here at church Wednesday night. I think
[14:20] that's awesome. Brother John, it's good
[14:22] to have you with us tonight again. And
[14:24] let's pray for all of our brothers and
[14:27] sisters. I think there's probably some
[14:28] more over there that are believers that
[14:30] are attending Virginia Tech. You know, I
[14:34] think they've got the largest student
[14:35] body that they've ever had this year.
[14:38] Somebody was telling me it's like 39,000
[14:42] and they're pushing for 50,000. I don't
[14:44] know where they're going to put them
[14:45] all, but till another year rolls around,
[14:47] but that's why the housing is getting so
[14:50] tight. And we need to pray because the
[14:53] roads have become more busier, of
[14:55] course, and all of that. Amen. But God
[14:57] is good all the time. Praise the Lord.
[15:01] Let's sing that song. And he paid a debt
[15:03] he did not owe. I owed a debt I could
[15:06] not pay. I needed someone to wash my
[15:10] sins away.
[15:12] He paid a debt. He did not owe. I owe a
[15:20] debt.
[15:21] Could not pay. I needed
[15:26] someone
[15:28] to wash my sins away.
[15:34] [Music]
[15:35] And now I sing a brand new song
[15:42] of amazing grace.
[15:45] All day long, Christ Jesus
[15:50] paid a debt that I could never pay.
[15:58] [Music]
[16:00] He paid out debt at Calvary.
[16:06] He cleansed my soul
[16:09] and set me free. I'm glad that Jesus
[16:15] [Music]
[16:17] did all my sins erased.
[16:23] [Music]
[16:24] I now can sing a brand new song.
[16:31] Amazing
[16:32] grace
[16:34] all day long. Christ Jesus
[16:38] paid a debt. that I could never pay.
[16:48] One day he's coming back for me
[16:55] to live with him
[16:58] eternally.
[17:00] On it be glory
[17:05] to see him on that day.
[17:12] I then will sing a brand new song.
[17:19] Amazing
[17:21] grace
[17:22] all day long. Christ Jesus
[17:27] paid a debt. that I could never pay.
[17:35] Verse one again.
[17:37] He paid a debt. He did not. Oh, I owe a
[17:45] debt. I could not pay. I needed
[17:51] someone
[17:53] to wash my sins away.
[17:59] [Music]
[18:01] And now I sing a brand new song.
[18:08] Amazing
[18:09] grace.
[18:11] All day long. Christ Jesus
[18:15] paid the debt that I could never pay.
[18:24] Aren't you glad for that? Praise the
[18:26] Lord. He certainly did pay the debt. He
[18:29] paid the whole debt.
[18:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Amen. I'm just going
[18:34] to ask that the ushers if they come at
[18:36] this time and we'll receive our evening
[18:39] tithes and offerings.
[18:46] Brother Bill, would you ask God's
[18:48] blessing over the offering, brother?
[18:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, brother Bill.
[19:16] Amen. Do we can we sing that God is good
[19:19] all the time? He puts a song of praise
[19:22] in my soul.
[19:25] Do we have that one?
[19:28] God is good
[19:31] all the time,
[19:34] but a song of praise in this heart of
[19:39] mine. God is good
[19:42] all the time.
[19:45] Through the darkest night, his light
[19:49] will shine. God is good.
[19:53] He's so good
[19:55] all the time. Let's just sing the
[19:57] chorus.
[19:59] God is good
[20:02] all the time.
[20:04] He puts a song of praise in this heart
[20:09] of mine. God is good.
[20:13] Through the time,
[20:15] through the darkest night, his light
[20:19] will shine. God is good.
[20:23] God is good
[20:26] all the time. Let's try a verse.
[20:29] [Music]
[20:31] If you're walking
[20:34] through the valleyies
[20:36] and there are shadows all around,
[20:42] do not fear.
[20:44] He will guide you.
[20:47] He will keep you safe and sound.
[20:52] He has promised
[20:55] to never leave you
[20:57] nor forsake you
[21:00] and his word is true. God is good
[21:06] all the time.
[21:08] Put a song of praise in this heart of
[21:13] mine. God is good
[21:16] all the time.
[21:19] Through the darkest night, his light
[21:23] will shine. God is good.
[21:27] He's so good
[21:29] all the time.
[21:32] [Music]
[21:34] We were sinners,
[21:37] so unworthy.
[21:40] still for us. He chose to die.
[21:45] Fill us with
[21:47] his holy spirit.
[21:50] Now we can stand and testify
[21:56] that his love
[21:58] is everlasting
[22:01] and his mercies
[22:04] they will never end. God is good
[22:09] all the time.
[22:11] He puts a song of praise in this heart
[22:16] of mine. God is good
[22:19] all the time.
[22:22] Through the darkest night, his light
[22:26] will shine. God is good.
[22:30] He's so good
[22:33] all the time.
[22:34] [Music]
[22:38] Praise the Lord. Aren't you glad for
[22:40] that?
[22:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:41] &gt;&gt; You know, there's some of us that's
[22:42] standing here tonight and some that
[22:45] couldn't be here tonight because of
[22:47] illness. But if it wasn't for the grace
[22:49] of God and God's goodness,
[22:52] we'd have probably buried them their
[22:53] bodies a long time ago
[22:56] &gt;&gt; because the devil would have tooken
[22:57] their life. But because the power of
[23:00] God, the blood, we should not take those
[23:02] things for granted. even our own health.
[23:05] You know, I think of Sister Alice, you
[23:07] know, the second liver transplant,
[23:11] &gt;&gt; I mean, the statistics if you know, if
[23:13] you really know what the statistics are
[23:16] on that first first liver transplant,
[23:19] but the second, my she is just a it's
[23:22] just astounding. It's the hand of God
[23:25] and we praise the Lord for that. Many of
[23:27] you can also testify, Sister Jane, you
[23:29] know how the Lord just touched you
[23:31] recently. Isn't he so good? Amen.
[23:34] &gt;&gt; We got so much to thank him for. Amen. I
[23:36] think with that, we're going to go to
[23:37] the prayer requests. Brother John, would
[23:39] you feel able to pray over the request
[23:42] tonight? If you don't mind, you can
[23:44] prepare for that. Um, I got first of
[23:48] all, we got quite a list here. Some are
[23:50] a great many is for healing.
[23:53] Just remember Sister Kimberly,
[23:56] I'm sure you put a request in here, but
[23:58] you uh Sister Alice, I'm sure could use
[24:01] her. It's for Sister Anne. Yeah. Oh,
[24:04] okay. Yeah, I got you. I'll read it here
[24:07] in a minute. Uh but we want to remember
[24:10] Sister Alice anyway. Uh let's remember
[24:13] Sister Janice. Uh she's not feeling well
[24:16] tonight. Uh
[24:19] let me see here. I want to make sure
[24:21] that I get Let's remember our little uh
[24:25] brother brother Shamai and his wife and
[24:28] their son. Amen. I'm sure they can use
[24:31] prayer. Uh there wasn't anything put in
[24:34] on them, but let's also remember our
[24:36] pastor as they'll be traveling uh
[24:39] probably tomorrow or something. I don't
[24:41] really know. But uh and then outside of
[24:44] that, uh let's remember
[24:48] brother David Farmer. uh been in touch
[24:50] with Sister Netti and she says that uh
[24:52] he's got some sort of blood blood
[24:54] condition and we want to continue to
[24:57] pray. You know, he was uh examined by a
[25:00] blood special uh blood specialist doctor
[25:03] and there was some issues there. So,
[25:04] let's remember him in prayer. Also, I
[25:07] failed to mention Sunday, and I really
[25:12] apologize that I didn't get that request
[25:14] out there to you, but there is a sister
[25:17] that attends Brother David Farmers that
[25:20] because of a diabetic uh infection,
[25:24] uh she had to have her uh I believe it's
[25:28] her right leg
[25:31] removed below the kneecap. It had to be
[25:34] amputated. Yeah, she had a severe
[25:37] infection. She's only 36 years old and
[25:41] uh she's also got a just uh I guess just
[25:45] a months several months old daughter if
[25:48] I remember correctly. And so we want to
[25:51] remember her in prayer. I should have
[25:53] mentioned again. I should have mentioned
[25:54] that Sunday. Uh she's been moved from
[25:57] the hospital over here at Radford up to
[26:00] the uh rehab clinic there at Marian
[26:03] close to where she lives. So, if you
[26:06] would remember her in prayer, she can
[26:08] use some encouragement. I'll tell you,
[26:10] if I've got her phone number, if any of
[26:12] you would desire, if you could just as
[26:15] much as call her or text her, uh even if
[26:18] you don't know her, I think she'd
[26:20] appreciate it. We went over to see her
[26:22] twice and she really appreciated having
[26:25] visitors. Uh she was kind of feeling
[26:28] feeling pain and so forth from that
[26:30] surgery. So, anyway, we want to remember
[26:32] that. And then also brother Terry's
[26:35] request here a friend of mine her
[26:38] daughter about 20 was having her tonsils
[26:41] removed and while in surgery her heart
[26:44] rate dropped to 20 took her straight to
[26:47] ICU in Rono and then airlifted her to
[26:51] Duke with fluid in her lungs. Please
[26:54] pray for her. So, uh, want to remember
[26:58] this, uh, friend, brother Terry's, her
[27:01] daughter, only 20 years old and
[27:04] complications have set in. Some pretty
[27:06] serious stuff. So, let's pray for that
[27:09] request. And then, Sister Anne put this
[27:11] in. Please pray for my coworker. She is
[27:15] 37 weeks pregnant and has just been
[27:18] informed that the baby doesn't have her
[27:21] lungs, kidneys, and gallbladder.
[27:24] Wow. The doctor has told her that the
[27:27] baby will die soon after birth. Beth is
[27:31] in her early 30s and hasn't been able to
[27:33] have children due to several
[27:36] miscarriages. This is the first baby she
[27:40] has been able to carry full term. This
[27:43] is uh Sister Anne's coworker. Now, God
[27:48] created a hip in Sister Anne. Is that
[27:52] right, Sister Anne? Praise the Lord.
[27:56] This ba this baby this woman's been
[27:58] trying to have babies. You think of it,
[28:00] people are throwing them away like
[28:01] trash, abortion and all that. This
[28:05] woman's been trying to have a baby. Here
[28:06] she has a baby coming to full term and a
[28:09] doctor gives her that report. Well, now
[28:11] that's what the doctor knows and says,
[28:14] but we've got another report.
[28:17] We believe in a God that can create
[28:19] organs and put them in that body that'll
[28:23] defy all things. I just heard something
[28:25] the other day that doctors are
[28:28] rethinking what they think about the
[28:30] brain. That may sound like a strange
[28:33] statement, but they said, "Not all of
[28:35] your thinking is done by your brain."
[28:37] Wow. Isn't that what the prophet said? A
[28:40] man thinkketh in his heart. But anyway,
[28:42] let's pray over these requests. many
[28:44] physical needs and I know many of you
[28:47] may have other needs that are not
[28:48] mentioned tonight. Let's remember Josiah
[28:50] as he's coming to speak for us. Amen.
[28:53] And amen. God bless you uh each and
[28:56] every one. Brother John, would you pray
[28:58] over these requests?
[29:00] Let's bow our heads.
[29:03] Lord Jesus, we thank you for giving us
[29:05] the opportunity to be in your house
[29:06] tonight. We thank you for giving us
[29:09] granting us safety on the roads and we
[29:10] thank you for giving us all the
[29:12] testimonies, giving us opportunity to
[29:14] praise you for them. I want to bring
[29:16] these uh requests before you the brother
[29:19] Terry's friend's daughter and I pray
[29:21] that you would heal her and I pray that
[29:23] you would help sister Anne's sister
[29:25] Ann's coworker who's trying to have a
[29:27] kid. I pray that you would help that
[29:29] child and heal her. I pray that you
[29:31] would help all the others who were
[29:32] mentioned who are having struggles with
[29:34] their health. you know about the
[29:35] testimonies that you've brought and we
[29:37] know you can do it again. I pray that
[29:38] you would continue to give us more
[29:40] testimonies. I pray that you would bless
[29:42] this service, Lord. I pray that you
[29:44] would bless the songs that we sing. I
[29:45] would pray that they would make a
[29:47] beautiful sound in your ear. And I pray
[29:48] that you would bless the preaching that
[29:49] we're going to hear tonight. Pray that
[29:51] you would speak to us. And I pray we
[29:53] would go home different. Lord Jesus
[29:54] name, I say, amen.
[29:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother John. I really
[29:59] appreciate that. We appreciate it. Amen.
[30:02] Let's sing that song as you're seated. I
[30:04] got so much to thank him for. Brother
[30:07] Terry, I'm going to ask you to get ready
[30:09] to come and sing your song. Amen. I've
[30:13] got so much to thank him for. So much
[30:20] [Music]
[30:21] to praise him for. You see,
[30:27] he's been so good to me.
[30:35] When I think
[30:38] of what he's done and where
[30:43] [Music]
[30:44] he brought me from. I've got so much
[30:49] to thank
[30:52] him for.
[30:55] Oh,
[30:56] I've got so much
[31:01] to thank him for. So much
[31:06] to praise him for. You see,
[31:12] he's been so good to me.
[31:18] [Music]
[31:20] And I think
[31:23] of what he's done and where
[31:29] he brought me from. I've got so much
[31:34] to thank
[31:37] him for.
[31:40] [Music]
[31:44] We certainly do have so much to thank
[31:46] him for. I would uh brother Kevin I just
[31:50] always love to hear brother Raymond sing
[31:52] this song so can't sing it as good as he
[31:55] but it's it's a worshipful song
[31:57] worshipful song to me and we're all in a
[32:00] journey but we're looking forward to
[32:02] that time when this journey is over and
[32:04] when we come to the end of this journey
[32:06] what's going to be waiting on us the key
[32:08] of D
[32:11] oh
[32:12] when I come to the end of my journey
[32:17] And no more I walk the roads I used to
[32:20] trudge.
[32:22] Oh I know the joys that wake me up in
[32:25] heaven.
[32:27] Oh resting in the arms of a never
[32:30] failing God. Well I'll be resting where
[32:34] the storm clouds never gather.
[32:38] Where hearts are never broken. There be
[32:41] no tear dimmed eyes. And I'll be
[32:44] drinking from the streams of living
[32:47] waters.
[32:49] Oh, resting in the arms of a never
[32:52] failing God.
[32:55] There'll be no sorrow in that sweet
[32:57] forever.
[32:59] And I'll see the many loved ones who
[33:02] have gone.
[33:04] Oh, a million years will seem as just a
[33:07] moment.
[33:09] or resting in the arms of a never
[33:12] failing God. Well, I'll be resting where
[33:16] the storm clouds never gather
[33:20] where hearts are never broken. There be
[33:23] no tear damned eyes. And I'll be
[33:26] drinking from the streams of living
[33:29] waters
[33:31] or resting in the arms of an everfailing
[33:35] God. Well, I'll be resting where the
[33:38] storm clouds never gather.
[33:42] Where storms broken, there'll be no tear
[33:45] damn dies. And I'll be drinking from the
[33:49] streams of living waters.
[33:53] Oh, resting in the arms of our never
[33:56] failing God.

[34:26] gleaned a lot from things he had to say
[34:29] and I had my pen out and was writing a
[34:32] lot of stuff down. Amen. But that's
[34:34] wonderful. Amen. No matter who is
[34:36] speaking, you know, God can delve us
[34:39] out. He always hand God gives us out
[34:41] pretty goodized portions when you think
[34:43] so. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, Amen.

[35:40] Greater is he that is in me.
[35:45] Greater is he that is in me than he that
[35:50] is in the world.
[35:54] Satan's like a roaring lion,
[35:59] roaming to and fro,
[36:03] seeking whom he may devour. The Bible
[36:09] tells me so.
[36:12] Many souls have been his prey to fall in
[36:18] some weak hour.
[36:21] But God has promised us today his
[36:26] overcoming
[36:28] power.
[36:30] Greater is he that is in me.
[36:35] Greater is he that is.
[36:38] [Music]

[37:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you thankful for all the many
[37:08] blessings and mercies that that that
[37:10] that he's given us every day?
[37:13] Amen. I'd like to turn um to Exodus
[37:16] chapter 3 verse one.
[37:28] Amen. Exodus 3:1-6
[37:35] says, "Now Moses kept the flock of
[37:37] Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of
[37:40] of the priest of Midian, and he led the
[37:44] flock to the backside of the desert, and
[37:46] came to the mountain of God, even to to
[37:50] Horeb. And the angel of the Lord
[37:52] appeared unto him in a flame of fire out
[37:54] of the midst out of the midst of a bush
[37:56] and and looked and behold the bush
[37:58] burned with fire. And the bush was not
[38:00] was was not
[38:02] con consumed. And Moses said, "I will
[38:05] now turn aside and see this great sight.
[38:07] Why the bush is not burnt?" And when the
[38:09] Lord saw that he turned aside to see,
[38:11] God called him out of the midst of the
[38:13] bush and said, "Moses, Moses." And he
[38:16] said, "Here I here, here am I." And he
[38:18] said, "Draw not nigh. draw not nigh
[38:21] hither put off thy shoes from off thy
[38:23] feet for the place whereon thou standest
[38:26] is holy ground. Moreover, he said, I am
[38:29] the God of thy father, the God of
[38:31] Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God
[38:33] of of of and the God of Jacob. And Moses
[38:36] hid his face, for he was afraid to look
[38:38] upon God. Let's all bow our heads.
[38:42] Our dear gracious heavenly father, Lord,
[38:43] how we love you. And Lord, how thankful
[38:46] we are, Father, for all the many
[38:47] blessings you've given us, Father.
[38:50] And Lord, we ask you, Father, now just
[38:52] to move in such a mighty special way,
[38:54] Lord, this evening. Ask you, Father,
[38:57] just to help me lay myself aside and
[38:58] just speak through me. Lord Jesus, we
[39:01] love you and we thank you in Jesus
[39:02] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Y'all can be
[39:05] seated.
[39:08] Amen. I was hoping to speak for just a
[39:10] few minutes tonight on the God of our
[39:12] fathers.
[39:13] Brother Brandham said um he said he said
[39:17] he said he he said my subject tonight is
[39:19] have faith in God. Now we are taught in
[39:22] God's blessed word that when faith
[39:24] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[39:26] word or the word or the and and hearing
[39:29] and hearing and hearing faith cometh by
[39:32] hearing and hearing by the word. He said
[39:34] now faith is also an experience and many
[39:37] times faith is had by a former
[39:39] experience. It makes faith grow. He said
[39:41] faith being in substance of things hoped
[39:43] for the evidence of things not seen. So
[39:46] many people fail to find the real
[39:47] meaning of what faith is. Some people
[39:50] some people believe that faith is is
[39:52] some is some sensation or some emotion.
[39:56] But the Bible said that faith is the
[39:57] substance of things hoped for. He he and
[40:00] he goes on to say he said now some some
[40:02] things thinks that it's a mental
[40:04] conception of the word but that is not
[40:06] right. Faith is the substance. Faith is
[40:09] not a myth. He he he he said faith is
[40:12] the substance of things hoped for the
[40:14] evidence. He he said to have an evidence
[40:15] it must be a substance and and catch
[40:18] this now. He said so it is not just
[40:20] something that you imagine in your mind.
[40:22] It's something that you absolutely have.
[40:25] It's something that you possess in your
[40:27] own in your own in your own in your own
[40:30] being. He said what is it? It's the
[40:32] evidence of things that you have hoped
[40:33] for. It's the evidence of things that
[40:36] you do not have as yet, but you have the
[40:39] authority of God to say to say that you
[40:42] that you you you that you have it. It's
[40:46] an evidence, something that you have in
[40:48] your heart.
[40:50] Amen. So, um, so we can we we can take
[40:55] these scripture and we can and we can
[40:56] take what the messages has has has has
[40:59] has
[41:02] taught us and and and we notice that
[41:04] Moses
[41:05] um um um he he he was he'd grown up to
[41:09] be a great man. He was a he was a
[41:11] general in Pharaoh's army. He had he he
[41:14] he had grown up he had grown up with the
[41:16] with the best of the best and and and he
[41:18] was an intelligent man. man. He was a
[41:20] smart man. He was a general in the
[41:21] greatest and the greatest military of of
[41:25] that time. But yet Moses had been a had
[41:28] been a bitter failure. But but but but
[41:32] because he had grown up and and and and
[41:34] and before he had and and he had he he
[41:37] had grown up with his mother and his
[41:38] mother had no doubt taught him him him
[41:41] him him him him him him him him him him
[41:42] him him him him him him him him him him
[41:42] him him him him him him him him him him
[41:42] him him him him him him him him him him
[41:42] him him him him him him him him him him
[41:43] him him him him him him him him him him
[41:43] him him him him him him him him him him
[41:43] him him him him him him him him him him
[41:43] him him him him him him him him him him
[41:43] him him him him him him him him him him
[41:43] him about the Jehovah of of of of
[41:46] old of of of of how that how that um
[41:51] Adam and Eve would would would walk in
[41:54] the garden and God would come down would
[41:55] come down in the evening and and will
[41:57] walk with them and talk with them and
[41:59] and commune with with them and that and
[42:00] and and how that how that how that um um
[42:05] Enoch had had this relationship with God
[42:07] and he and he walked with them day after
[42:09] day and year after year until he was not
[42:11] for God took him and and and how that
[42:15] and and and and and
[42:19] how that um that uh Abraham Ham Ham Ham
[42:23] had been called out
[42:27] by by by by by God and a and towards to
[42:33] where that Abraham had a personal
[42:35] relationship with with with with
[42:39] the great mighty God. A and and she and
[42:43] and no doubt she had begun to tell him
[42:45] tell him about about how that God had
[42:48] promised in 400 years years
[42:52] that that God was to set his people
[42:54] free. And no doubt Moses had this had
[42:57] this mental had this mental conception
[42:59] that that he was the deliverer. But but
[43:03] but but yet he had not met God. He he he
[43:06] he he had he he had he had heard of the
[43:08] God of his fathers through a mental
[43:10] conception. But but until that burning
[43:13] bush bush experience
[43:16] experience where that mental conception
[43:17] had become a personal relationship with
[43:20] Jehovah. So, so
[43:24] and so, and and so, and so brother
[43:26] Brandham says says he he said, "Now
[43:28] watch faith take a hold right quick." He
[43:30] said, "The old things are passed away."
[43:32] He said, "But Moses now has a new
[43:34] vision. He has a revelation. He has an
[43:37] experience. He had met God. He had
[43:39] talked to God. Before that, he had not
[43:42] he had not met God. He'd only read and
[43:45] known about what his mother had had told
[43:46] him by hearing what his mother had said
[43:50] or hearing what the pastor had said. He
[43:52] said, "Now Moses has a personal
[43:55] experience."
[43:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; So, so, so, so everything everything
[43:59] that that that mo that that that that
[44:01] his mother had taught him about to where
[44:03] and began to build up in his heart and
[44:05] be and begin to think think think that
[44:07] surely there's a God there's a God alive
[44:11] alive alive today. And even though he
[44:13] tried to take it to take it to take it
[44:17] in in his own hands, God had to take him
[44:19] out there out there out there in in the
[44:23] back side of that desert. And and he
[44:26] began to he began to show him who he was
[44:29] and and just how mighty that that that
[44:32] &gt;&gt; that he was and and Moses had had left
[44:35] there a changed man. He he he was
[44:37] different now. Why? Because he had now
[44:39] he had now he had met God on And so and
[44:43] and so everything the manifestation of
[44:46] everything of all those stories of all
[44:48] the men of faith of of old that that he
[44:51] had had had grown up listening to was
[44:53] now standing was now standing was now
[44:56] standing before him in that burning
[44:58] bush.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; It was no longer it was no longer the
[45:01] the God of of Adam or the God of Enoch
[45:03] or the God of of of Abraham or the God
[45:07] of Isaac or or the God of Jacob. It was
[45:09] his God.
[45:11] be because because he had he had had a
[45:14] personal relationship with with God.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said
[45:21] says that that said that but he'd come
[45:23] face to face with God with an experience
[45:25] who who had who had the armored angels
[45:28] of all of all of all the of of all the
[45:33] eternities to stand by him. And as Moses
[45:35] went and went went his way down went
[45:37] down with his wife straddled a little
[45:39] old mule and long whiskers was hanging
[45:41] down. He said, "I believe that 10,000
[45:43] times 10 thousands of of of angels rode
[45:46] along down those dusty those those dusty
[45:49] roads roads roads with them. He had an
[45:52] experience."
[45:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh and so we we can talk about
[45:56] Abraham and the life and the life that
[45:58] that man lived that that that man lived
[46:00] where he had he had total faith
[46:04] in and God to to to where he would he
[46:07] was he would he would he would he he
[46:09] would strike the sea and it would or he
[46:11] he would speak to the sea and it would
[46:12] open and and he he would speak to the
[46:14] rock
[46:16] and and it would it it would bring forth
[46:18] water to to where to to where to to
[46:20] where that day in and day out and day in
[46:22] in and day out. That man lived in the
[46:24] presence in the presence of God. And you
[46:27] can look at um at um Abraham. He was 75.
[46:31] He was just an idol worshipper. He
[46:33] worshiped idols. He made idols. A and
[46:36] and and yet God had come down and called
[46:39] him out out and called him out of there
[46:43] and said, "I will make you a father of
[46:45] many nations."
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Why? Um and he he he and and for 25
[46:51] years years he he he he he through faith
[46:55] he stood there day in and day out and
[46:57] claimed his victory
[46:59] and and this was no longer no no no no
[47:03] longer the god the god the god of his
[47:05] forefathers. It had become a personal
[47:08] relationship to for 25 years. He claimed
[47:10] that that that that he claimed that
[47:13] promise on until the until Isaac Isaac
[47:16] was was standing was standing was
[47:19] standing be be before him. Um and so we
[47:24] can look at at uh at at at at
[47:28] Nathaniel. I I I always like this this
[47:31] story. Nathaniel was was he was he was a
[47:35] he was a a a a a devout Jew. He was an
[47:38] Orthodox Jew and he he he would sit
[47:39] there and he read his Bible daily and he
[47:42] and and he prayed to and he prayed to
[47:43] Jehovah and and and yet and yet a and
[47:47] and yet and yet one day um one day I
[47:50] think it was his brother his brother
[47:52] Andrew Andrew Andrew went and got him
[47:54] and he brought him forth forth and and
[47:56] and fun of Jesus and he said and he said
[48:03] and a and and Jesus said behold an
[48:06] Israelite in who there is no
[48:08] And he said, "Master, when did you know
[48:09] me?" And he and he said he said, "Before
[48:11] Philip before before Philip called you,
[48:15] called you. I saw you." And and it was
[48:18] in that this starchy Orthodox Jew after
[48:21] he had seen the power of Christ. He fell
[48:24] on his knees
[48:26] and and and said, "Thou art the Christ."
[48:29] The the the man that I had that I h have
[48:32] have been have been been been reading
[48:35] about the the the very God that that
[48:37] that had that stood before be before
[48:40] before
[48:43] a Abraham and and said and said, "Why
[48:45] did Sarah laugh?" Because because
[48:47] because because God saw that or or
[48:50] Philip had had saw that that same sign
[48:53] that that God had presented to to that
[48:56] God had presented to Abraham was now had
[48:59] had presented to him him him him him him
[49:01] him him him him him him him him him him
[49:01] him him him him him him him him him him
[49:01] him him him him him him him him him him
[49:01] him him him him him him him the very
[49:02] same thing the God of his fathers was
[49:04] now standing be before him face to face
[49:09] and he could sat there and say thou art
[49:11] the Christ the king of Israel
[49:14] and and and and but But before now you
[49:17] notice now before he can he he couldn't
[49:20] say say it all all that before he met
[49:23] Christ all all
[49:26] he could say was Jehovah is a mighty
[49:28] God. Jehovah had had had
[49:31] a past tense now had spoken to Abraham.
[49:34] Jehovah in the past had had had
[49:37] delivered the Israelites. Jehovah the
[49:39] past had had had had he he he had walked
[49:44] and talked and talked with Enoch. He had
[49:46] the past talk to David, but now but but
[49:50] now he could sit there and say present
[49:51] tense Jesus is standing is standing
[49:54] before him. The God of his fathers, the
[49:56] the the Messiah, the king of Israel was
[49:57] standing before him manifested in human
[50:00] flesh.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said he he was he was he was
[50:06] talking about about David. He he he said
[50:08] he said he he he said why? He said why
[50:10] you can't fight that giant? He said, he
[50:12] said, "Just take all these degrees off
[50:14] of me and all these church papers and
[50:17] and everything and let me get get let me
[50:20] get get free once
[50:23] free once." He he he said he let me He
[50:26] said, "Let me let me tell let let me
[50:28] tell you something. Backyard when I when
[50:30] I was hurting my daddy's sheep, there
[50:32] was a bear a bear had had had come in
[50:35] had come in one day one day and grabbed
[50:38] one. And I picked up my my slingshot and
[50:40] I knocked it down. And I took the kid
[50:41] and brought it back. And a lion had had
[50:43] had had had
[50:47] come in and grabbed one and and and run
[50:50] out. And I knocked him I knocked him
[50:53] down down down down down down two. And
[50:55] when I got when I got to him, he raised
[50:57] up against me against me and I killed
[50:59] him. Yeah.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; He he he said the God that that that
[51:01] that he said the God that delivered me
[51:05] out of the paw of the lion and the bear,
[51:06] how much more will he deliver me out of
[51:08] the hands of that uncircumcised sized
[51:12] sized philistine who's defying the
[51:14] armies of the living God? And he and he
[51:16] says this. He said, "See, he had faith
[51:19] because he had experience. Men and women
[51:22] know who who who's never who who's never
[51:25] knowed God no more than just to read
[51:27] about him. They don't have um they don't
[51:29] have much experience, but they don't
[51:32] know or he he said he he said they don't
[51:34] know what to do. But a man that's ever
[51:37] met God and had an experience that
[51:40] settles it. So, so, so, so, so, so, so
[51:43] so so, so, so, so, so so so, so David
[51:45] had lived his life in the backside and
[51:48] the backside
[51:50] of of, of of, of, of, of, of, of, of,
[51:51] of, of, of, of, of the desert and he
[51:53] said the a, and he saw the mighty, the
[51:55] mighty, the the the mighty workings of
[51:57] God. He had read He had read He had read
[52:01] in and the scriptures where it said
[52:03] where it said if you are holy holy holy
[52:06] holy follow me then nothing shall shall
[52:09] shall be able to to to stand before you.
[52:12] And David was reading in these
[52:14] scriptures. He was meditating them day
[52:16] in and day out
[52:18] until
[52:19] until the adversary had had had had had
[52:24] risen up and and he put his faith into
[52:26] action. Yes.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; And so
[52:30] so so so so
[52:34] what what we know what what what what we
[52:37] know is that is that is that is that God
[52:41] is always going to to to to keep his
[52:44] word. We have seen it time and time and
[52:47] after and time again.
[52:49] and and and and we know that that that
[52:53] that that that
[52:55] if I'm not healed healed healed at this
[52:58] present time, God has has plenty of of
[53:01] of of healing power. A and tomorrow I
[53:04] will see the manifestation of of that
[53:06] healing.
[53:09] But but but but what we got to do is is
[53:11] we have to put our faith into action a
[53:15] and and sit there and say, "I am just as
[53:18] happy. I am just a ha as a as happy
[53:21] right now right now as if I've seen my
[53:24] manifestation because God will keep his
[53:26] word and that and that we know that God
[53:28] will bring it to pass.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; So so so so we can sit there and say and
[53:35] a and say and say I am going going I am
[53:38] going to to to to
[53:42] get g get well and we can walk off and
[53:45] forget all about it. Why? Because we
[53:47] know that God has promised in his word
[53:49] that whatsoever things that that we have
[53:52] need of, God will bring it to pass.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Faith is a substance. It's not a
[53:56] makeelie, but but but but
[54:01] we have we have a possession of it. We
[54:05] have we have the purchase power of our
[54:09] of our our our healing. He he healing
[54:13] tonight. And I'm still claiming my
[54:15] purchasing power of my stuttering. Amen.
[54:17] I'm going to get get through this
[54:20] through this thing this this thing
[54:22] eventually.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:25] Brother Brandham says says, "Now with
[54:28] this with this," he was talking about a
[54:30] a loaf of bread and how that and how
[54:32] that that if he was starving
[54:35] a and a man and a man would would would
[54:39] come up up up up
[54:41] to him and give him a a a a quarter.
[54:44] Now, now, now, now now if he was
[54:46] starving and he received a quarter to to
[54:49] to go get that that that that loaf of
[54:52] bread, he could start rejoicing right
[54:54] then and there as if he already had the
[54:56] bread. Right. Right. Because he had he
[54:58] had the purchased power of of of that
[55:02] loaf of bread.
[55:05] And he said he he now with this with
[55:07] this 25 cents, I might have to walk
[55:09] several miles to to get the loaf of
[55:12] bread. He said, "But all the time I'm
[55:13] walking, I'm getting weaker and weaker.
[55:16] But but I'm rejoicing all the time
[55:18] because I know as soon as I arrive as I
[55:21] arrive as I arrive at the place I'm
[55:23] going to have that that that that bread.
[55:27] I may I may I may I may I may I may I
[55:30] may have I may have to go over the hill
[55:32] down through the thicket across the
[55:34] river and and over the stumps and I may
[55:36] get I may get so hungry before I get
[55:38] there that till till I've even got I've
[55:41] even got the cramps the cramps in my
[55:43] stomach. But I'm rejoicing all the time.
[55:46] I'm I'm just getting worse, weaker,
[55:48] hunger, h and and hunger. But I'm
[55:52] rejoicing because I hold in my
[55:55] possession the purchased power of that
[55:57] bread. And and he said and he said, "And
[56:00] when a man really looks to God with
[56:01] unadulterated unadulterated faith that
[56:04] God is able to keep what he what what
[56:08] he's promised, he can he he he can
[56:10] rejoice no matter no matter no matter
[56:12] how sick he gets or or how bad he
[56:15] suffers, all the hurting he is or
[56:16] whether he's prayed for or whether or
[56:18] whether or whether he isn't, it's a
[56:20] settled thing with that man when he
[56:22] receives the faith." Right? And uh in
[56:26] Philippians chapter 3
[56:28] uh verse one says uh finally my brethren
[56:31] rejoice in the Lord
[56:35] to to write the same thing to you. To me
[56:37] indeed is not is not grievious but for
[56:40] you it is safe. He said he he says
[56:43] beware of dogs beware of evil workers.
[56:46] Beware of the concision. For we we are
[56:49] the circumcision which worship God in
[56:51] the spirit and rejoice in Christ in in
[56:54] Christ in Christ Jesus and have no
[56:58] confidence no confidence in the flesh.
[57:00] Though I might also have though I might
[57:03] also have have have ha have have
[57:05] confidence have confidence in the flesh.
[57:07] If any other man thinkketh that that
[57:09] that that he have whereof whereof he
[57:12] might he might he might trust in the
[57:14] flesh. I I'm circumcised the eighth day
[57:17] of the stock of Israel of the tribe of
[57:19] the tribe of of of of Benjamin and and
[57:22] Hebrew and Hebrew of the Hebrews that
[57:23] touching the law of Pharisee concerning
[57:26] zeal persecuting the church touching the
[57:28] righteousness which which is in the law
[57:30] blameless. But what things were gained
[57:33] to me, though I counted loss, those I
[57:36] counted loss, loss, loss for Christ.
[57:39] Yay, doubtless I count all things but
[57:41] loss, for the excellency, excellency of
[57:43] the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord,
[57:45] for whom I have suffered the loss of all
[57:48] things, and do count them but dung, that
[57:50] I may win Christ.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Peter, our or Paul, who who had grown
[57:54] up, he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees.
[57:56] He knew that scripture inside and out,
[57:59] backwards and forward to toward to where
[58:02] to word. They said they said that that
[58:03] that uh that uh that uh he could roll
[58:06] the scroll up and and pierce it with a
[58:08] pen and tell you every single word every
[58:10] single word word
[58:13] that that that that that
[58:15] pen pierced. He he was a man that was
[58:18] learned. He was educated. He was smart.
[58:20] He he he he he he he he had he had every
[58:23] single every every single every single
[58:26] single single single single degree that
[58:28] that that a man could possibly get. But
[58:30] but but but but yet on his road on his
[58:33] road road
[58:36] on his road to to Damascus, God struck
[58:39] him down and he was a blind as a bat.
[58:42] A and Paul Paul he as being the educated
[58:46] man man man man man man man man man man
[58:47] man man man man man man man man man man
[58:47] man man man man man man man man man man
[58:48] man man man man man man man man man man
[58:48] man man man man man man man man man man
[58:48] man man man man man man man man man man
[58:48] man man man that he was he he had known
[58:50] exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly
[58:54] what that what that what that what that
[58:56] light was he was it was a pillar of fire
[58:59] and he had been an educated man knew
[59:01] that that was the pillar of fire that
[59:02] that that led the children of Israel of
[59:05] of of Israel across the desert and he
[59:07] said and he said and he said who are who
[59:09] art thou who art thou Lord and in And if
[59:12] you look at at the direct translation to
[59:14] that that that and he has Lord who art
[59:16] thou that Lord Lord means Jehovah. He
[59:19] knew that that that that he was talking
[59:21] he was talking to he was talking to the
[59:23] God to the God of of of of his of his
[59:28] his his
[59:29] fathers. And when Jehovah answered back
[59:32] he he said I am Jesus. And then at that
[59:34] moment a moment right then and there it
[59:37] changed Paul. Paul uh it it it changed
[59:40] it changed him he him him him him him
[59:42] him him him him him him him him him him
[59:42] him him him him him him him him him him
[59:43] him him him him him him him him him him
[59:43] him him him him him him him him him him
[59:43] him him him him him him him him him him
[59:43] him him him him him him him forever he
[59:44] said everything that I learned I counted
[59:46] I counted it as done why because he had
[59:48] met the god of his fathers and and he
[59:51] had become a changed man
[59:55] &gt;&gt; John 4 and verse and verse 20 says our
[59:59] fathers and this this he Jesus it was
[1:00:01] just Jesus talking talking with with
[1:00:03] with the woman at the well he saw our
[1:00:06] fathers had worshiped had worshiped in
[1:00:07] mountain. And ye say that in that in
[1:00:10] Jerusalem um is the place where men
[1:00:13] ought ought to worship. And Jesus saith
[1:00:16] saith saith saith unto her, "Woman,
[1:00:19] believe me, the hour cometh, when ye
[1:00:21] shall neither in neither in this
[1:00:22] mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship
[1:00:26] the Father." Yet ye worship, ye worship,
[1:00:29] ye know, ye know not what
[1:00:32] but but we know what what what we
[1:00:35] worship. For salvation is is of the
[1:00:37] Jews. But the hour cometh and now is and
[1:00:40] now is when the true worshippers shall
[1:00:42] worship the father in spirit and in
[1:00:44] truth. For the father seeketh such to
[1:00:48] worship him. God is a spirit. And they
[1:00:50] that worship him must worship him in
[1:00:52] spirit and in truth. And the woman saith
[1:00:54] say and the woman say sayeth sayith
[1:00:57] sayaith s say saith unto him. I know
[1:00:59] that Messiah cometh cometh which is
[1:01:01] called Christ. when he has come, he will
[1:01:04] tell us all things. And Jesus said,
[1:01:06] saith un unto
[1:01:09] her, I I that speak unto thee am he. And
[1:01:14] if we skip down to the next verse, he
[1:01:17] said he said the woman left then left
[1:01:18] her water pot and went her way into the
[1:01:21] city and saith and saith, come see a man
[1:01:24] which told me which told me all these
[1:01:26] things that I ever did. Is this not the
[1:01:28] Christ? She she this woman this this
[1:01:31] woman had had had had a mental
[1:01:32] conception of of who the Messiah was.
[1:01:35] She sat there and said, "Our fathers
[1:01:36] have worshiped in this in this
[1:01:37] mountain." And she said she said, "Jacob
[1:01:39] hath hath dug this well." Which is our
[1:01:41] father. He he he had dug this well. And
[1:01:45] yet and yet the very God that that that
[1:01:48] she had had had grown up, she heard
[1:01:51] about him. She heard about the Messiah.
[1:01:53] She said, "We are looking we are looking
[1:01:55] for the Messiah." And there stood the
[1:01:56] very manifestation of what she had
[1:01:59] sought after her her
[1:02:01] what she had what she had had had had
[1:02:05] sought after was standing be be
[1:02:08] before her. She said come see a man. She
[1:02:11] was a changed person who one moment in
[1:02:14] the presence of Jesus Christ had changed
[1:02:16] her her her her forever.
[1:02:21] He it was no longer just a just a mental
[1:02:24] conception of of of who the Messiah was
[1:02:26] supposed to be or or or or of of who
[1:02:28] Jehovah was or or of who Jacob was. But
[1:02:31] yet the very manifestation was standing
[1:02:34] before her
[1:02:36] be
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; be
[1:02:38] be before her. Aren't you thankful?
[1:02:41] Thankful for that.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we notice now that that
[1:02:44] that that um that faith often times will
[1:02:49] produce a a praise, a a praise in our
[1:02:52] hearts. There's so many times where
[1:02:53] where where brother Brandon will sit
[1:02:55] there and say he he he'll he he'll he he
[1:03:00] he'll sit there and say and say thy
[1:03:02] faith has saved thee. Go on and and
[1:03:04] praise him now. and and and and if you
[1:03:08] look at at at at at at
[1:03:12] Abraham, he he says, "And when he said
[1:03:14] he was 75 years old, and God had given
[1:03:16] him he him
[1:03:19] God had given him the the the the
[1:03:23] promise of it." A a and a a and and and
[1:03:29] yet the Bible says Abraham staggered not
[1:03:32] at at stagger not at the promise of God
[1:03:36] through
[1:03:38] uh through through unbelief but was
[1:03:40] strong in faith giving praise on giving
[1:03:43] praise unto God and calling those
[1:03:46] symptoms and things and and things which
[1:03:48] was as though they were not and and and
[1:03:51] he testified
[1:03:53] only what God had had said was what was
[1:03:57] true. Why? Because he had the promise.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; And now if if we look at at at at at
[1:04:05] Joshua, Joshua, he the the the the um um
[1:04:10] the uh uh angel of the Lord had had told
[1:04:13] him had told him to to march around
[1:04:14] Jericho day in and day out for seven
[1:04:17] days. And they but but he said on the
[1:04:19] seventh day on the seventh time
[1:04:23] all around he he said blow the trumpets
[1:04:25] and and and on the trumpet blast ye men
[1:04:29] shout. And brother Brandham says and
[1:04:32] brother Brandham says and by the people
[1:04:34] shouting and giving a praise and giving
[1:04:37] a praise to God. The walls of Jericho
[1:04:40] the walls of Jericho the walls of
[1:04:43] Jericho fell down flat. one on on on top
[1:04:46] one on top one on top of the other. He
[1:04:48] said, "A little shouting helps helps
[1:04:51] helps once in a while." He said, "I
[1:04:53] believe it. It certainly does." He said,
[1:04:54] "And when they sounded the trumpet and
[1:04:56] the people shouted, down went the
[1:04:58] walls." And he said a and
[1:05:01] so so we can look at and say and to
[1:05:03] think that that the very walls that what
[1:05:07] had seemed an impossible obstacle
[1:05:11] these walls were so tall and so thick
[1:05:13] and and and and and
[1:05:16] so thick and so thick that they
[1:05:18] literally had had races on top of these
[1:05:20] walls. And and and and yet and yet to to
[1:05:25] to the to the to the human eye, th this
[1:05:31] this this this
[1:05:33] wasn't possible. But but but but but but
[1:05:35] but
[1:05:37] yet but but but yet when they began to
[1:05:38] praise the Lord, the walls came came
[1:05:41] tumbling down.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; And so we notice that when the
[1:05:44] omnipotent speaks, miracles miracles
[1:05:47] miracles happen. Brother Brandon has
[1:05:48] mentioned this. I know our pastor has
[1:05:50] has has has has has
[1:05:53] has
[1:05:56] preached about this many times, but but
[1:05:58] but when omnipotence speaks, the
[1:06:00] miracles happen. And the very word
[1:06:03] omnipotence means all powerful God
[1:06:07] and and and the omnipotent God, the all
[1:06:10] powerful Jehovah God, the all powerful
[1:06:13] Jesus, he has spoken, he has spoken o o
[1:06:16] o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o
[1:06:17] over over over over our our lives. He
[1:06:19] said whatsoever things that that ye have
[1:06:21] h have have ha have have need of need
[1:06:24] need of you can take it and and and you
[1:06:27] you can can can can can claim it
[1:06:30] tonight.
[1:06:32] Wh why do do we have any rivers rivers
[1:06:35] rivers rivers in our lives that we just
[1:06:36] think is is impossible? It's it's
[1:06:38] uncrossable. They're they're they're
[1:06:40] they're they're
[1:06:42] too great. And and it's and it's it's
[1:06:45] it's it's it's
[1:06:48] too mighty.
[1:06:51] But but yet we can be like Elisha where
[1:06:53] he stood there with Elijah's mantle and
[1:06:54] he said, "Where is the God of Elijah?"
[1:06:57] And we can strike that river that that
[1:07:00] that that that river tonight. He
[1:07:04] the the very God the very God of our
[1:07:06] father
[1:07:09] of of our fathers is standing in the
[1:07:11] building with us with us us us us us us
[1:07:14] us us us us us us us us us us us us us
[1:07:14] us us us us here tonight. If we can take
[1:07:16] take that mantle mantle and faith and
[1:07:18] and and speak the victory and speak the
[1:07:21] victory over our lives over our our
[1:07:23] lives our lives our lives our lives
[1:07:26] tonight. So, so, so, so, so you know,
[1:07:29] you noticed Elisha,
[1:07:31] Elisha, he he he had known God. He had
[1:07:35] worshiped God. But, but yet when he took
[1:07:37] when when he took Elijah's mantle and he
[1:07:40] and he and he and he and he said, "Where
[1:07:43] is the God of Elijah, that very God that
[1:07:45] that that he had saw working through
[1:07:48] Elijah? He he he he he he had no doubt
[1:07:51] seen seen seen the miracles and the
[1:07:54] manifestation of of what of what God was
[1:07:56] doing was doing was doing through
[1:07:58] through that prophet. And and now he had
[1:08:00] the very mantle that Elijah had and he
[1:08:02] can stand there in all confidence and in
[1:08:04] all assurance and say where be the God
[1:08:07] of Elijah and he could stand there in
[1:08:09] all faith and all assurance and watch
[1:08:11] that that that river apart. So, so, so,
[1:08:14] so, so, so, so, so, so
[1:08:16] and that very same anointing that was on
[1:08:18] Elijah fell fell has fallen has fallen
[1:08:22] on on Elisha and us and us in the in
[1:08:24] these la and the in in these last days
[1:08:26] today, we have saw we have saw the
[1:08:28] prophet Elijah. We have saw him him.
[1:08:35] We have saw him speak the word of faith
[1:08:37] over people. And we have saw God
[1:08:39] manifest himself countless and hundreds
[1:08:41] and thousands of times and thousands
[1:08:45] of of of of times. And now that the
[1:08:47] prophet is off the scene, there's a
[1:08:49] bride standing forth here with that same
[1:08:51] anointing, that same anointing that
[1:08:52] Elijah has has. And we can stand there
[1:08:54] with that with that mantle and say,
[1:08:55] "Where be the God beh
[1:09:01] that that we come across, we can watch
[1:09:03] it part
[1:09:05] in front of us." Why? Because we have
[1:09:07] the purchased possession of what what
[1:09:10] God has promised it is now standing
[1:09:11] before us in these last days through the
[1:09:14] message of the hour. what he he the the
[1:09:17] God of our fathers that we have heard
[1:09:19] about we have preached about that day
[1:09:22] after day our parents has has told us
[1:09:24] about about it day after day we have
[1:09:26] heard on those tapes
[1:09:28] of God coming down and revealing the
[1:09:31] hearts the hearts and the mind of people
[1:09:33] and and healing them day after day we he
[1:09:36] is now standing here before us why
[1:09:38] because because we serve a personal
[1:09:41] savior we are the Mrs. Jesus Christ. The
[1:09:44] God of our fathers is now living and
[1:09:46] dwelling inside the bride. She is Mrs.
[1:09:49] Jesus Christ. We worship the God of our
[1:09:52] fathers. Why? And he is worthy. He is
[1:09:55] worthy of it all. Though in how
[1:09:58] insignificant we may feel, though how
[1:10:00] how low down and downtrodden we that
[1:10:04] that that that that
[1:10:08] no matter how low down and downtrodden
[1:10:09] we feel, we can sit there and praise the
[1:10:11] God of of our fathers for all that that
[1:10:14] that that for all that he has that he
[1:10:17] has he has already done done past tense
[1:10:20] for us.
[1:10:22] hand in Revelation 5:1 it says, "And I
[1:10:26] saw in the right hand of him that sat on
[1:10:28] the throne a book written within on the
[1:10:30] backside sealed with seven seals. And I
[1:10:33] saw a strong angel and I saw a strong
[1:10:35] angel proclaiming with a loud voice, who
[1:10:37] is worthy, who is worthy to open the
[1:10:39] book, and to loose the seals thereof?
[1:10:40] And no man in heaven, nor in earth, nor
[1:10:42] under the earth was able to open the
[1:10:44] book, and neither to look upon." And I
[1:10:46] wept much because no man was found no
[1:10:49] man was was was was found was found
[1:10:53] worthy to open and to read the book,
[1:10:55] neither to to even look to even look to
[1:10:57] even look there on. And one of the
[1:10:59] elders and elders said unto me, "Weep
[1:11:02] not. Behold, the lion of the tribe of
[1:11:04] Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed
[1:11:06] to open the book, and to loose the seven
[1:11:08] seals thereof. And I beheld, and lo, in
[1:11:11] the midst of the throne, and of the four
[1:11:12] beasts, and in the midst of the elders,
[1:11:14] stood a lamb, as it had been slain,
[1:11:16] having seven horns and seven eyes, which
[1:11:18] are the seven spirits of God, sent forth
[1:11:20] unto all the earth. And he came, and he
[1:11:23] took the book out of the right hand of
[1:11:24] him that sat upon the throne. And when
[1:11:26] he had taken the book, the four beasts,
[1:11:28] and four and 20 elders fell down before
[1:11:30] the lamb, the lamb, having every one of
[1:11:32] them harps and golden vials full of
[1:11:35] olders, which are the prayers of the
[1:11:36] saints. And it says this, they sung a
[1:11:38] new song, saying, Thou art worthy to
[1:11:40] take the book and open the seals
[1:11:43] thereof, for thou was slain and hast
[1:11:45] redeemed us to God by thy blood out of
[1:11:47] every kindred kindred, tongue, and
[1:11:50] people and nation. And thou hast made us
[1:11:52] our made unto our God, kings and
[1:11:55] priests, and we shall reign on the
[1:11:56] earth. And I beheld and and I heard the
[1:11:59] voice of many angels round about the
[1:12:01] throne and the beast and the elders. And
[1:12:03] a number of them was 10,000 times 10,000
[1:12:05] and thousands of thousands saying with a
[1:12:08] loud voice, "Worthy is the Lamb that was
[1:12:10] slain to receive power and riches and
[1:12:12] wisdom and strength and honor and glory
[1:12:15] and blessings. And every creature which
[1:12:16] is in the heaven and on the earth and
[1:12:18] under the earth and such as are in the
[1:12:20] sea, all that are that are in them heard
[1:12:23] I saying, blessing and honor and glory
[1:12:27] and power be unto him that siteth upon
[1:12:29] the throne and unto the Lamb forever and
[1:12:31] ever. And the four beast said, "Amen."
[1:12:33] And the four and 20 elders fell down and
[1:12:35] worshiped him that liveth forever
[1:12:39] and ever. Why? Because brother Brandham
[1:12:40] said he must have seen his name on the
[1:12:42] book. and
[1:12:45] and we as the lowly humble bride of
[1:12:48] Jesus Christ can sit here and worship
[1:12:50] the God of the ages. The the God who
[1:12:53] rolled back the Red Sea. The the God who
[1:12:55] who has open the blind the eyes of the
[1:12:57] blind. The very God who has who has we
[1:13:00] we watched cancers fall off them. The
[1:13:02] very God who who has who who has set us
[1:13:06] free. Now he is worthy of all the
[1:13:08] worship, the honor, and the praise that
[1:13:11] that we could possibly give him.
[1:13:13] Brother Ram said, "You know, if I bought
[1:13:15] a home and it was mine, I'd go through
[1:13:17] the thing and see what I had. I'm just
[1:13:20] kind of a prospector. I like to dig
[1:13:22] around and find out and find out what
[1:13:23] I've got." He said, "I'm an heir of
[1:13:26] salvation. I'm an heir of divine
[1:13:28] healing. I'm an heir of heaven. I'm an
[1:13:30] heir to the earth. I'm an heir. I'm a
[1:13:32] joint heir with Christ." And all these
[1:13:33] things and I like to look through his
[1:13:35] book to prospect and see what all I'm an
[1:13:37] heir to. is who we as the bride of
[1:13:40] Christ, we are become an heir and a
[1:13:41] joint heir with Christ. Our name is just
[1:13:44] as good on the check as Christ is. We
[1:13:46] can whatever we have need of, we can sit
[1:13:48] here and sign it cuz the God of our
[1:13:50] fathers has made himself alive and well
[1:13:52] in in these last days. And we as the
[1:13:54] bride of Christ can stand here and say,
[1:13:55] "I'm an heir to it all." We have the
[1:13:58] purchased possession in our hands. You
[1:14:00] just got to take your quarter and go
[1:14:01] down and go down to that store and and
[1:14:04] and and
[1:14:06] purchase it. Why? because we are an heir
[1:14:09] to it all.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine Sam Walton, his son, you
[1:14:13] know, he he he and and I' I've I've
[1:14:16] heard uh uh brother Daryl Ward talk
[1:14:18] about this and that's where I got it
[1:14:19] from. He said he said he said what if D
[1:14:22] Sam Walton's son would would walk into
[1:14:23] Walmart and let's say he was a beggar
[1:14:25] and he was hungry and he said, you know,
[1:14:27] could I possibly have a bag of chips or
[1:14:29] or or could I possibly have a loaf of
[1:14:31] bread? But yet, but yet Sam Malton's son
[1:14:34] could if he was starving and he was a
[1:14:35] beggar, he could walk into Sam Malton's
[1:14:37] store and say, "My daddy owns it all."
[1:14:40] And he could sit there and say, "Give me
[1:14:41] that steak in over there. Give me that
[1:14:43] grill so I can go outside and grill it
[1:14:44] with." Why? Cuz he his daddy owns it
[1:14:47] all. And and we can sit there with all
[1:14:50] confidence and all assurance. And we're
[1:14:52] not some beggarly low trotten bride
[1:14:55] bride. We are We are an heir. We are
[1:14:57] royalty. We are the queen of heaven. and
[1:15:00] and whatsoever we have need of, we can
[1:15:02] sit there and and claim it and claim it
[1:15:04] for our own.
[1:15:06] There was a the prophet of the Lord was
[1:15:09] was was he was talking he was talking to
[1:15:11] to to to to
[1:15:13] the king one time and he and told him he
[1:15:16] he he said he said he said go get your
[1:15:17] bow and and he got his bow and he said
[1:15:20] put an arrow in it and he said and he
[1:15:22] said now now now now now now now now
[1:15:26] shoot the arrow and uh and after he had
[1:15:29] shot it he told him he said go get it
[1:15:31] and so he went he went got he got and
[1:15:33] come back and he said strike the
[1:15:36] And that king that king he struck the
[1:15:38] round three times. And the prophet of
[1:15:40] God was wroth with him. And and he said,
[1:15:42] "Why did you not did you not did you not
[1:15:45] strike it? Did you not strike it? Strike
[1:15:47] it. Why did you not strike it? Strike it
[1:15:49] more times than that."
[1:15:51] And and he said he said, "You struck it
[1:15:53] only only three times." He said, "So
[1:15:55] that means you will only have three
[1:15:57] victories." And and so when when we when
[1:16:01] we as the bride of Christ, whatsoever
[1:16:03] battle battle whatsoever ever ever ever
[1:16:05] battle we're going up against, whether
[1:16:07] our children have strayed or or whether
[1:16:09] we're we're fighting sickness in our
[1:16:11] bodies or or or whether we need a a
[1:16:14] deliverance from sin that that has drugg
[1:16:16] us through the mud. Well, we can sit
[1:16:18] there and keep striking that ground and
[1:16:20] keep striking that ground until we see a
[1:16:21] total victory. If you if you have
[1:16:23] something in your life, strike the
[1:16:25] ground with it. It'll be why? be because
[1:16:27] because God has promised it to us to to
[1:16:31] us in these last days. you you look at
[1:16:34] the at the woman. Um the I think it was
[1:16:37] a it was the it was a Shounomite
[1:16:41] it was a a Shounomite myite woman when
[1:16:44] when when her son died. The the the the
[1:16:48] prophet servant had come forth and said
[1:16:49] and said, "Is all well with you?" All is
[1:16:52] well. Is all well with your is is all
[1:16:54] well with with with your husband. All is
[1:16:57] well. Is all well with your boy? All is
[1:16:58] well.
[1:17:01] And and and and yet and yet but yet but
[1:17:06] yet the the the the
[1:17:09] Elisha told the w told the woman or he
[1:17:11] he told the servant he said go lay your
[1:17:14] go lay your staff go lay your staff or
[1:17:16] go lay my staff staff on the boy and the
[1:17:18] servant went and did what as he was
[1:17:19] told. But brother Ram says but the
[1:17:21] woman's faith wasn't in the staff it was
[1:17:24] in the prophet and and he said I and I
[1:17:27] like her determination. She said, "As
[1:17:29] the Lord lives and and your soul never
[1:17:31] dies, I will not leave you." And tonight
[1:17:33] we could we could and we tonight could
[1:17:36] hold on to God's rep representative
[1:17:41] like that. He said, he he said, "If you
[1:17:43] could tell the Holy Spirit tonight, as
[1:17:45] sure as as you are the immoral spirit of
[1:17:47] God, you give me a promise in the Bible
[1:17:50] of of you give me a promise in the Bible
[1:17:53] of my healing, and I'm going to hold on
[1:17:56] until I see something happen, there
[1:17:59] would be there would be miracles taking
[1:18:00] place. The lamb or the lame would be
[1:18:02] jumping and running, and the doctors the
[1:18:04] doctors of of the doctors of Los of Los
[1:18:07] Angeles would be surprised tomorrow to
[1:18:09] see their patients healed." And
[1:18:12] and and and see their patients healed
[1:18:15] and well. And if we could just take a
[1:18:17] hold of God's agent, God's agent then
[1:18:19] was Elijah. God's agent today is the
[1:18:21] Holy Spirit. Hold on to it. Whenever you
[1:18:23] come when whenever you come into contact
[1:18:26] and you feel the Holy the Holy Spirit on
[1:18:28] you, then hold then then then then hold
[1:18:31] on to it. I'll not leave you. Stay with
[1:18:33] it like like Jacob did like Jacob did
[1:18:36] when he wrestled with the angel. I'm I'm
[1:18:38] going to hold on hold on till you bless
[1:18:41] me and give me the things that I'm
[1:18:42] desiring. And Elijah had and Elijah seen
[1:18:46] he had her on his hands. There was
[1:18:48] nothing else to do but go but but go
[1:18:50] with her. And if you'll stay with the
[1:18:52] Holy Spirit, stay on his hands. He loves
[1:18:55] you well enough, well enough to come to
[1:18:56] you and bless you and save you. Then
[1:18:59] stay on his hands. Don't he he he said,
[1:19:02] don't you remember how Jesus teaching
[1:19:04] about the unjust judge? He said, "I fear
[1:19:06] neither God nor man, but this woman
[1:19:08] torments me day and night, crying after
[1:19:10] me. How much more God will give them the
[1:19:12] Holy Spirit who cry after him day and
[1:19:14] night." He He said, "We've got to have
[1:19:16] faith to believe that God that God that
[1:19:19] God
[1:19:22] that God can do it and we'll do it.
[1:19:23] Let's take a hold of it and hold on.
[1:19:25] Just don't let it go. Stay right with
[1:19:27] it. If it don't come now, it'll come 10.
[1:19:30] It will come 10 10 minutes later, hours
[1:19:33] later, two weeks later, a month later.
[1:19:35] No matter when it comes, I got a hold of
[1:19:36] it. I'm going to stay with it. We are
[1:19:39] not worshiping a dead god. We are serve
[1:19:41] a living God, a God that is alive and
[1:19:44] well, and he's living and dwelling in
[1:19:45] this bride. He is the almighty, the
[1:19:48] omnipotent, the omnipresent, the
[1:19:50] everlasting God. He is so wonderful. He
[1:19:54] is so wonderful to us,
[1:19:56] man.
[1:19:58] And and brother Brandham says that's
[1:19:59] what it takes. No matter how much faith
[1:20:01] you've got, if you won't use it, it's no
[1:20:04] good. It it's it's it's no good to you.
[1:20:06] That's right. What good is a God of
[1:20:08] Moses if he ain't the same God today? He
[1:20:11] said, "What good is a historical God?"
[1:20:13] You people who go to church and your
[1:20:14] church only teaches that that some
[1:20:17] historical fact about the Holy Ghost
[1:20:19] coming back on the day of Pentecost.
[1:20:21] There's no such a thing today. There
[1:20:23] there was healing healing back there. He
[1:20:25] he he said, "What good does does does
[1:20:27] that do you?" He He said he said, "Just
[1:20:30] no more just no more than reading George
[1:20:32] Washington once lived." That's right.
[1:20:34] Abraham He Abraham Lincoln once lived
[1:20:37] according according to the history.
[1:20:40] According to the history, Abraham
[1:20:41] Abraham Lincoln lived according to the
[1:20:43] history. George Washington lived, but
[1:20:45] they're dead and buried according to the
[1:20:46] history. But look, Jesus Christ lives.
[1:20:49] He died and he rose again according to
[1:20:51] according to the scriptures is alive
[1:20:53] forever more. Why? Our faith must be
[1:20:56] must be put must be put must be put in
[1:21:00] in into in in
[1:21:04] into action. We're not we're not serving
[1:21:07] we're not serving a God of history.
[1:21:10] We're not serving of God a God of
[1:21:12] yesterday. A God of a God who was but we
[1:21:14] are serving a mighty present God in
[1:21:16] these present tense. We are serving the
[1:21:19] the God of our fathers. But the God of
[1:21:20] our fathers has stood before us and he's
[1:21:22] made him himself manifested and known in
[1:21:24] these last days. He has loosed the seals
[1:21:27] and we have become worth we have we we
[1:21:30] have we have we have become worthy to
[1:21:32] worship the the the mighty God. He is
[1:21:35] the everlasting father. He's the prince
[1:21:37] of peace. He's the mighty God. Amen.
[1:21:39] Don't you love him?
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Don't you want to want to serve him with
[1:21:43] everything everything that you got with
[1:21:45] you?
[1:21:47] If you look at that at the Pharisees,
[1:21:49] Pharisees, they said that they said that
[1:21:52] that that they follow that that that
[1:21:54] they follow Moses's law. But yet, but
[1:21:56] but but but yet the mighty God, the law
[1:22:00] maker, was standing right before them.
[1:22:02] They and they they and all their
[1:22:03] intellect and knowledge
[1:22:06] and and and all that what they knew
[1:22:08] about God in the Bible, but yet they
[1:22:10] felt they felt to see the mighty God
[1:22:13] standing there wrapped in in in in
[1:22:17] human flesh was standing was standing
[1:22:18] before them and they missed it and they
[1:22:20] and they crucified him. Let's not be
[1:22:22] guilty be be guilty guilty to to today
[1:22:26] of failing to see what what our mighty
[1:22:28] God our mighty God can can can
[1:22:32] can
[1:22:35] do. Let's sit here and take and take him
[1:22:37] him at
[1:22:41] his word and claim every promise every
[1:22:43] promise that Jesus had died for is now
[1:22:46] ours.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; We serve a mighty God. Amen.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, how we love him. And if I if if the
[1:22:53] musicians will come, he how we love him.
[1:22:57] How I adore him.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; He's the wonderful, the counselor, the
[1:23:03] prince of peace, the mighty God, the
[1:23:04] everlasting father. He's the lily of the
[1:23:07] valley. He's the rose of Sharon. He that
[1:23:09] was, which is, and which shall come.
[1:23:11] He's the root and the offspring of
[1:23:13] David. He's the word, the life, the joy,
[1:23:16] the the joy, the our our our prince of
[1:23:18] peace. He's our all and all. He is God.
[1:23:20] How we love him and how we praise him.
[1:23:23] He's the matchless one, the great
[1:23:25] eternal one made flesh and dwelt among
[1:23:27] us. Don't you love him?
[1:23:31] And now he's the pillar of fire. He he
[1:23:34] he he's moving and dwelling with us in
[1:23:37] these last days. He has shown himself.
[1:23:39] He has vindicated himself to us time
[1:23:41] after time after time after time. And he
[1:23:45] and he is he is the mighty God. And he
[1:23:47] has come down down amongst us here to
[1:23:50] here here today showing who we are. Oh
[1:23:53] my.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him?
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. We we can we can praise him ahead
[1:24:00] ahead ahead ahead of the victory.
[1:24:04] Not not because of of how we feel. We
[1:24:06] might feel just sick as ever. We might
[1:24:08] feel just as as hopeless as ever. That
[1:24:10] sin may be may feeling like like it's
[1:24:13] weighing us down more than more than
[1:24:14] ever. But but yet we can rise up in
[1:24:16] faith and claim it. Why? Because it's
[1:24:18] our God. It's our God. It's our
[1:24:20] God-given gi given privilege. Christ has
[1:24:23] already made us free on Calvary. Christ
[1:24:25] has already ha has has already healed us
[1:24:28] on Calvary. Christ has has already set
[1:24:30] us free. Those prison gates are swinging
[1:24:32] wide. And we can sit here and praise him
[1:24:35] a and we can s here and praise them when
[1:24:38] as of yet. We don't feel nothing. We're
[1:24:41] still sick as ever. We we we might be be
[1:24:46] be sitting there be be sitting there
[1:24:48] just just thinking it's hopeless. But
[1:24:50] but yet we can praise him. Why? Because
[1:24:52] he has promised it. And we have we have
[1:24:54] his signed check check stand sitting
[1:24:56] here before us. And we are on our way to
[1:24:58] on our on our way on our way to the
[1:25:00] banquet. Though we might be getting
[1:25:01] sicker and sicker and sicker, but but
[1:25:04] yet we can claim the promise, the
[1:25:06] promise for our own.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:10] Don't Don't you love him?
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; It says, "By faith, Enoch walked with
[1:25:15] God and he was not and he was not for
[1:25:19] God had took him." By faith, Shamgar
[1:25:21] fought and defeated and defeated those
[1:25:24] those those 600 those six those those
[1:25:26] those those
[1:25:29] 600 those six those say 600 those those
[1:25:32] 600 Philistines and he killed them all

[1:26:07] devil and all of his demons. Every
[1:26:10] potential is laying in the bride right
[1:26:12] now. Transforming power is laying in the
[1:26:14] seed right now. It's going to be exactly
[1:26:17] what God said it what God has has has
[1:26:20] said has has said it will be. It has
[1:26:23] come to its full potential.
