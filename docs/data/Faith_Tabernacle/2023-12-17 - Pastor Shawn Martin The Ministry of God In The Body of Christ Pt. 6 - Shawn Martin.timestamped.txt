[43:17] and um good morning to you all and good
[43:21] to uh just see everyone musicians can be
[43:25] dismissed and um um those that have been
[43:30] sick and are in the house of the Lord
[43:33] we're certainly glad to have you back
[43:35] and uh just just everyone and uh
[43:39] appreciated the songs the worship that
[43:42] has gone forth and um amen and uh um
[43:47] want to say I appreciate the brothers
[43:49] for putting these changing out the
[43:51] lights amen and um they're um
[43:56] [Applause]
[43:58] and working in the back and and so we're
[44:00] going to put some more Lighting in here
[44:02] uh we just run out and uh so we've
[44:05] ordered some more and and make it a
[44:08] little bright I like a bright place not
[44:10] a dull place and so um uh so so it'll be
[44:14] a little brighter as we go and that way
[44:17] we can see your faces and and uh you so
[44:21] uh but also uh just going to let you
[44:24] know we are going to be uh doing a lot
[44:26] of um as time goes we're going to be
[44:29] remodeling this place and uh we want to
[44:32] change the carpets uh going to take out
[44:35] these pews eventually change them and
[44:38] replace the chairs put chairs in and uh
[44:41] so it's going to be a lot of remodeling
[44:45] uh as we get the money and so um we uh
[44:51] wanting to do that do an upgrade and so
[44:55] uh but I do want to say that if anyone
[44:57] is interested in it and would like to
[44:59] donate uh for that cause uh you're
[45:02] certainly welcome to and um if you do uh
[45:07] make sure you designate that money I
[45:09] mean let us know that that's what that
[45:11] money is for so brother Tim will be able
[45:14] to uh put it in the right account and uh
[45:17] so anyways um we um um you know the Lord
[45:23] has blessed us with this building uh
[45:25] we're not paying any rent on it and uh
[45:29] to be honest I have looked for other
[45:31] buildings and um to move to but we it
[45:35] ain't happening and um I have not wanted
[45:39] to uh remodel this because if we ever
[45:43] sold it we we not or we can't sell it if
[45:46] we ever decided to move we couldn't sell
[45:48] it so I really didn't want to put money
[45:49] into it but um as of this point this is
[45:53] where the Lord wants us to be I guess
[45:56] and uh so we're going to change things
[45:58] around here and make it a little bit uh
[46:01] uh better so um um so we're looking
[46:05] forward to that amen if you have your
[46:08] Bibles we're going to turn to first of
[46:10] all the Book of Matthew the 17th
[46:13] chapter and
[46:16] um just uh a card here note says thank
[46:21] you for your prayers may God richly
[46:23] bless you and says perhaps you spoke the
[46:26] kindest words as any friend could say
[46:30] perhaps you were not there at all just
[46:34] thought of us that day whatever you did
[46:37] to console our hearts we thank you so
[46:40] much whatever the part uh that's from
[46:44] the family of Alfred uh tickle uh
[46:48] brother of sister
[46:50] Jane and um so we we certainly uh even
[46:56] though I didn't get to meet him uh
[46:58] sister James told me about him and uh he
[47:02] he just seemed to be a just a fine man
[47:05] and and um a wonderful husband uh to his
[47:09] his wife and and uh so I'm I'm sure he
[47:12] would uh be greatly missed uh seemed
[47:16] like he lived a full life amen and
[47:19] traveled the world right him and his
[47:20] wife traveled the world and and uh done
[47:24] a lot of things together and but we want
[47:26] to uh just remember Sister Jane in our
[47:29] prayer and the family and that's no
[47:32] matter who it would be it's it's
[47:34] definitely not easy to lose a loved one
[47:38] and uh so uh and I want to say we really
[47:41] appreciate sister Jane love her dearly
[47:44] and um um so she's been a great
[47:49] inspiration to us here at the
[47:51] church but um uh before we go into the
[47:55] word may we just bow our heads and talk
[47:58] to our Lord
[48:00] father truly it is good to be in your
[48:03] house this morning with your people that
[48:06] you have
[48:07] redeemed Lord we just I feel so
[48:10] inadequate to stand before them this
[48:13] morning and but Lord we're just asking
[48:16] that you would um anoint me Father we
[48:20] need you Lord and not just me but anoint
[48:24] your people father and we have felt your
[48:27] spirit here already Lord as the people
[48:31] would press in to worship and to magnify
[48:34] you Lord and I know that must be
[48:37] pleasing to you father for the Bible
[48:40] says Lord that you inhabit the Praises
[48:43] of your people and father as the
[48:46] atmosphere is created Lord I I just ask
[48:51] that you would now feel at home to do a
[48:54] supernatural work in all of our Lives
[48:58] father and bless what little words we
[49:00] would have to say and father give us
[49:02] more revelation of you father not just
[49:05] knowledge but let it be a great
[49:08] understanding for you promised it would
[49:10] be in this day that we would have
[49:12] understanding of your word of who we are
[49:15] of where we're going of our position
[49:18] father in you we ask it in Jesus
[49:21] Christ's name and the church
[49:23] says amen amen
[49:26] The Book of Matthew the 17th chapter and
[49:31] we're going to just read the U first
[49:33] five verses but it
[49:36] says and after Jesus or after six days
[49:40] Jesus taketh Peter James and John his
[49:43] brother and bringeth them up into an
[49:46] high mountain apart and was transfigured
[49:49] before them and his face did shine as
[49:52] the sun and his reignment was as as was
[49:57] white as the light and behold there
[49:59] appeared unto them Moses and Elias
[50:02] talking with
[50:04] them then answered Peter and said unto
[50:07] Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here
[50:10] if thou will let us make uh here three
[50:13] Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses
[50:16] and one for
[50:17] Elias and while he spake Behold a bright
[50:20] Cloud overshadowed them and behold a
[50:23] voice out of the cloud which said said
[50:25] this is my beloved Son in whom I am well
[50:29] pleased hear ye him amen then if you'll
[50:33] go to the book of Ephesians we have read
[50:36] this several times now but the book of
[50:38] Ephesians the 4th
[50:43] chapter
[50:49] amen Ephesians uh chapter 4 and verse
[50:54] one we'll start there I therefore the
[50:56] prisoner of the Lord beseech you that
[50:59] you walk worthy of the vocation
[51:01] wherewith you are called with all
[51:03] loneliness and meekness and with
[51:05] longsuffering forbearing one another in
[51:08] love endeavoring to keep the unity of
[51:11] the spirit in the bond of
[51:13] Peace there is one body and one Spirit
[51:17] even as you are called in one hope of
[51:20] your
[51:21] calling then if you'll go with me to
[51:24] Revelations the 10th
[51:28] chapter Revelations chapter
[51:30] 10 and while you're turning just want to
[51:33] say you know um I guess next Sunday will
[51:36] be Christmas Eve and so we will be
[51:39] having service uh Sunday morning uh
[51:42] there uh and we we'll dismiss be
[51:45] dismissing the evening service so just
[51:48] remember that um uh Sunday morning we
[51:52] will have service regular time and uh um
[51:55] brother Andrew is going to be in town so
[51:57] I've asked him to uh take that service
[52:01] and so we're looking forward to what God
[52:04] has uh for us then praise the Lord uh
[52:08] Revelations the 10th
[52:10] chapter and I want to read the start at
[52:14] the eth
[52:15] verse and the voice which I heard from
[52:18] Heaven spake unto me again and said go
[52:21] and take the little book which is open
[52:23] in the hand of the angel
[52:25] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[52:28] Earth and I went unto the angel and said
[52:31] unto him give me the little book and he
[52:34] said to me take it and eat it up and it
[52:38] shall make thy belly bitter but it shall
[52:41] be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I
[52:44] took the little book out of the Angel's
[52:46] hand and ate it up and it was in my
[52:49] mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I
[52:53] had eaten it my belly was bitter and he
[52:56] said unto me thou must prophesy again
[53:01] before many peoples Nations and tongues
[53:05] and Kings amen you can have your seats
[53:09] this
[53:10] morning and I pray the Lord just helps
[53:13] us here today but we read in in Matthew
[53:19] there
[53:21] where God is is adopting
[53:26] his son the Lord uh
[53:29] Christ and he says hear me no
[53:33] longer but hear ye him and this is um as
[53:38] I was just listening to brother brandom
[53:42] early this morning and and that just
[53:44] rung out to me God saying hear me no
[53:49] longer but hear you
[53:51] him
[53:53] now we are standing
[53:55] standing we are standing in that same
[53:58] place
[54:01] today uh as the body of Christ The Bride
[54:04] for we are living in the time of the
[54:08] manifestation of the sons of
[54:11] God
[54:13] um no other time has it been uh for the
[54:19] sons of God to be manifested outside of
[54:22] this time amen this is the time right
[54:25] even as good as Pentecost was on the day
[54:27] of
[54:28] Pentecost this was that was not from
[54:32] what I see what brother brandham taught
[54:33] it was not the the the adoption time
[54:37] this is the time of
[54:40] adoption and this this manifestation of
[54:45] sons happens at the same time at the lid
[54:49] of hell has been lifted off and and
[54:54] demons are pouring
[54:56] in like like never
[54:59] before and and so this this
[55:03] manifestation did not happen in the
[55:05] Pentecostal age um uh it it is it is
[55:09] today and we must we must let that
[55:13] really sink into us because if you
[55:16] realize this is the hardest age ever
[55:19] this is the most deceptive age ever this
[55:22] is the most evil age ever to ever be and
[55:27] it'll be at this time that only those
[55:31] that are sons of God will overcome this
[55:34] age it'll be the only time uh the the
[55:38] the only ones that'll
[55:40] overcome so what is this manifestation
[55:43] what what is all this about you know
[55:45] brother brandom in in in one place in
[55:48] actually one in a million he says he is
[55:52] supposed to according to scriptures
[55:54] return to Us in this last days in this
[55:57] type of
[55:58] ministry after uh that will be after the
[56:01] baptism of the spirit speaking in
[56:04] tongues Divine Healing and so forth
[56:06] these things the capping of the
[56:09] Pentecostal message is what we're
[56:11] speaking of
[56:13] today see this ministry of the Christ
[56:17] himself
[56:18] impersonated among his people with the
[56:21] very same things that he did when he was
[56:25] here on Earth in his body the bride
[56:28] which is part of him doing the same
[56:31] things everybody say the same things as
[56:33] husband and wife or King and Queen just
[56:38] before the marriage ceremony hallelujah
[56:42] what a time what a day we're living in
[56:45] and and what a privilege and honor to be
[56:48] part of
[56:49] this now as sons of God as men members
[56:54] of the body of of Christ then we are
[56:57] part of the ministry we have a Ministry
[57:01] you see we are the agents that God uses
[57:04] here on Earth we are the hands feet lips
[57:08] mouth eyes we we if God's going to have
[57:12] a body it is us it is us and and so like
[57:17] it's you know in the natural if if our
[57:19] car breaks down on the highway you know
[57:23] there there's you know we we we will
[57:25] call we will wait for a tow truck to
[57:28] come and take it to the mechanic and
[57:31] then we wait for that mechanic to to fix
[57:34] the problem if our septic goes bad you
[57:37] know we call someone like brother Tim uh
[57:41] to to send one of his guys out there to
[57:44] take care of the problem if if we have a
[57:47] loved one that needs you know special uh
[57:51] care uh you know uh caretaker whatever
[57:54] then we we call someone like you know uh
[57:57] Sister Kim weeks or sister Hannah bate
[58:00] and uh someone like that to help us uh
[58:04] uh you know there there there are
[58:06] agencies that we can we can uh call for
[58:10] help to to get things done ain't that
[58:13] right well but but we're we're greater
[58:16] than these things we're we're because we
[58:19] are members of the body of Christ so if
[58:23] God is going to get anything thing done
[58:25] on the Earth today then he calls upon
[58:29] his body the members of his own body
[58:33] Amen to help help you know to to that he
[58:37] himself can do the job do you believe
[58:40] that so then um Mark 16:17 Jesus said
[58:45] these signs shall follow them that
[58:48] believe in my name they shall cast out
[58:52] Devils a higher Ministry you know they
[58:55] shall speak with new tongues they shall
[58:57] take up serpents and if they drink any
[58:59] deadly thing it shall not hurt them they
[59:02] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[59:05] shall recover John 14:12 Jesus said he
[59:08] that believeth on me the works that I do
[59:11] shall he do also and greater than thee
[59:14] shall he do because I go unto my father
[59:17] and whatsoever you shall ask and he's
[59:20] talking to his body not just everybody
[59:23] whatsoever you shall ask ask in my name
[59:26] that will I do it amen this is a son
[59:29] daughter of God that's coming to
[59:31] adoption see they they they uh uh that
[59:35] the father may be glorified in the son
[59:37] ain't that right it's not for our Glory
[59:40] it's not for our our uh everybody to
[59:43] look at me and see what kind of guy I am
[59:45] and and all these things see and if you
[59:48] shall ask anything in my name I will do
[59:50] it see God ain't going to send his
[59:53] members and commission you on on his on
[59:55] on something and then he don't back you
[59:57] up but just as Moses needed that Red Sea
[1:00:01] to be parted and and he started crying
[1:00:04] about it and God rebuked him and said
[1:00:06] why are you crying to me I've
[1:00:08] commissioned you to go forward now you
[1:00:10] speak amen and and and so we're we're
[1:00:14] standing in that same place here this
[1:00:18] morning I I believe that so so then uh
[1:00:22] um to to to to go further into the type
[1:00:26] of ministry that we have as the body of
[1:00:28] Christ I I hope that we can do that
[1:00:30] today amen uh because there is no
[1:00:34] Ministry amen outside the body of Christ
[1:00:37] that compares to the ministry in the
[1:00:39] body of Christ there there is no
[1:00:42] Ministry and I I cannot stress enough of
[1:00:46] importance of of what you are and the
[1:00:50] position you hold and the role you play
[1:00:53] in in the body of of Jesus Christ um God
[1:00:56] has set each member in the body as it
[1:01:00] has pleased him do you believe that amen
[1:01:03] as he it has pleased him so so God's
[1:01:06] body is important and and he takes very
[1:01:09] he takes very uh interest in you
[1:01:13] personal interest in you that if he
[1:01:15] called you if he ordained you he saved
[1:01:18] you he baptized you into that body now
[1:01:21] he is going to personally place you in
[1:01:23] that body position you in that body cuz
[1:01:26] he's got a specific work for you and
[1:01:29] this body must run together every that's
[1:01:32] why brother brandom said it in several
[1:01:34] places nobody can take your place I
[1:01:37] don't care how small you are and how
[1:01:38] insignificant you feel and and yada yada
[1:01:41] and all no one can take your place and
[1:01:44] no wonder the devil wants to tell us
[1:01:46] that we're insignificant that we don't
[1:01:49] matter I listening to brother Bri today
[1:01:51] and and he says you know he says even
[1:01:53] the devil had me uh you know trying to
[1:01:55] tell me that God doesn't love me and
[1:01:57] that that God doesn't care for me and I
[1:01:59] thought my Lord a a man that that that
[1:02:02] was in the presence of an Angel
[1:02:04] constantly and and and all these things
[1:02:06] and yet the devil was trying to even
[1:02:08] tell him so you could imagine we fight
[1:02:11] the same battles amen but you are
[1:02:14] important amen the the same angel that
[1:02:17] would talk to brother Brandon would tell
[1:02:18] him that how just important we are as
[1:02:22] the body of Christ amen you believe that
[1:02:25] and so so God would set each of us as
[1:02:28] members of his body as it has pleased
[1:02:32] him see and so then then we've read it
[1:02:35] but brother Brown said see he endows
[1:02:37] them the members of that body he endows
[1:02:40] them with their Ministry and he puts the
[1:02:44] gifts at her disposal amen see so uh now
[1:02:49] to me the the following quote uh uh is
[1:02:53] what makes the ministry
[1:02:55] within the bride different uh from the
[1:02:57] rest of the ministry uh uh outside the
[1:03:01] body of Christ and it makes it more
[1:03:03] powerful and and more effective than any
[1:03:07] other notice what brother Bram said
[1:03:09] those in the bride was so every member
[1:03:12] of the body do only everybody say do
[1:03:15] only this is very important now do only
[1:03:18] his will see no one everybody say no one
[1:03:23] can make them do
[1:03:25] otherwise see the this is now we're
[1:03:27] talking of adoption of sons now see
[1:03:30] they've come to maturity they've come to
[1:03:32] a place that they're not the foolish son
[1:03:34] they're not that foolish Guy where God
[1:03:36] can't put adoption can't place an
[1:03:38] adoption he just squanders he just does
[1:03:40] whatever God gives him this a certain
[1:03:43] Ministry God gives him a a certain
[1:03:45] talent and he just squanders it you know
[1:03:47] amen but those in the bride do only his
[1:03:51] will and no one can make make them do
[1:03:55] otherwise ain't that right you know uh
[1:03:58] uh uh I'm I'm going to to put it uh uh
[1:04:03] um uh brother brother Ray Erikson uh he
[1:04:07] he was talking about um um Corinthians
[1:04:12] the 13th chapter when that which is
[1:04:14] perfect has come that which is uh in
[1:04:16] part will do be done away with and and I
[1:04:19] I'll be honest uh I've not really
[1:04:22] understood that uh part
[1:04:24] of that scripture of course I've I've
[1:04:27] heard a lot of people uh use that as
[1:04:31] well the gifts are done with and all
[1:04:33] that because now that which is perfect
[1:04:35] is come uh and i' never believ that
[1:04:38] because brother Bram never said that and
[1:04:40] so but I uh what what Brother Ray uh he
[1:04:44] made the statement he said see when that
[1:04:46] which is perfect he said we have put up
[1:04:48] with a lot of false prophecies a lot of
[1:04:52] false dreams a lot of false things that
[1:04:55] was said in the name of the Lord and and
[1:04:57] yada yada yada uh and we've had some you
[1:05:00] know that was good some that was right
[1:05:03] some that was corrective but but a lot
[1:05:05] of it was saying things that God never
[1:05:08] even said you know and and these things
[1:05:11] he said but when that which is perfect
[1:05:14] is come then all of that which is in
[1:05:17] part and other words all that that is
[1:05:19] false will be done away with and I
[1:05:21] thought man that is so powerful that
[1:05:24] makes sense in other words you're not
[1:05:26] taking you're not taking gifts out of
[1:05:28] the church cuz brother Brown never did
[1:05:29] that but now reason why we don't have a
[1:05:33] lot of these things in the church like
[1:05:36] we used to in Pentecost is because a lot
[1:05:39] of that was false but here come that
[1:05:41] which is perfect now there's a mature
[1:05:44] bride that is not just saying thus
[1:05:47] sayith the Lord off of impression that
[1:05:49] is not accepting just every dream that
[1:05:51] they have amen they're they're not going
[1:05:54] by in Sensations and said oh this is of
[1:05:57] the Lord I man I would deal with a lot
[1:06:00] of that back in the day you know a
[1:06:02] Pentecost uh this old precious dear old
[1:06:05] woman you know uh uh God led her
[1:06:08] everywhere I'm just tell everywhere she
[1:06:11] she had make God's led me here you know
[1:06:12] tell my dad you know God's led me here
[1:06:15] to this church bless the Lord and and so
[1:06:17] LED yeah well praise the Lord you know
[1:06:19] month later she's gone you know and and
[1:06:22] then she'd come back 5 months later you
[1:06:24] know and dad said well sister were you
[1:06:26] well God led me over here you know God
[1:06:29] was leading her a lot you know places
[1:06:31] and and then you also hear these things
[1:06:33] of of well the Lord told me this and the
[1:06:35] Lord told me that I hear ministers all
[1:06:37] the time the Lord told me this and well
[1:06:39] the Lord told me this the other day and
[1:06:41] you're just sitting there and you're
[1:06:42] thinking man Lord Lord sure don't talk
[1:06:44] to me like that you know and and and and
[1:06:47] then you find out they're living a lie
[1:06:49] they they living a sin they're living in
[1:06:51] all corruption and and you know but the
[1:06:54] Lord's still talking you know and and it
[1:06:58] it just you know but that when that
[1:07:00] which is perfect is come then then all
[1:07:04] the the the nonsense will be done away
[1:07:06] with all all of the Impressions will be
[1:07:09] done away with all these Sensations will
[1:07:11] be there is a true dance there is a true
[1:07:14] tongue there is a true prophecy there is
[1:07:16] a true emotion there is a true spirit
[1:07:20] amen that is working among the bride but
[1:07:23] they only his will and nothing no one
[1:07:28] will ever convince them to do otherwise
[1:07:31] now this is where e failed in the
[1:07:33] beginning ain't that right see now
[1:07:36] notice what brother Brown said he
[1:07:38] continues they have thus sayith the Lord
[1:07:41] or they keep still they have thus sayith
[1:07:45] the Lord or they keep still let someone
[1:07:47] rise with a dream and they'll judge that
[1:07:49] thing before they go after it you know
[1:07:52] let someone come rise up with the
[1:07:54] prophecy and they'll judge that
[1:07:56] according to the word of God because
[1:07:58] thereafter thus sayi the lord they're
[1:08:00] not after your impression they're not
[1:08:02] after amen your friendship they're not
[1:08:05] after well bless God you know you meant
[1:08:07] well no no it's time for judgment amen
[1:08:10] can you say amen and so they have this
[1:08:13] sayith the Lord or they keep still they
[1:08:15] know they know it has to be God in them
[1:08:20] doing the works fulfilling his own work
[1:08:24] see God in his bride in this age able to
[1:08:29] fulfill his own word see so God in every
[1:08:33] member of the body the bride fulfilling
[1:08:35] he goes on he says see he did not
[1:08:37] complete all his work while in his
[1:08:40] Earthly Ministry so now he works in and
[1:08:45] through the bride now he works what's he
[1:08:49] going to do he's going to fulfill his
[1:08:51] ministry in you he's going to feel it do
[1:08:54] you believe that yes sir see he works in
[1:08:57] and through the bride she knows that I
[1:09:01] think that's important amen she knows
[1:09:04] that she's not just sitting here going
[1:09:05] to a mess of church just wonder what do
[1:09:07] I do I don't know I I just don't know if
[1:09:10] I'm going to make it no she knows that
[1:09:12] God is in her fulfilling fulfilling his
[1:09:17] own word through her see she knows that
[1:09:20] see for it was not time for him to do
[1:09:24] certain things see that he must do now
[1:09:27] so she knows it wasn't time for him to
[1:09:30] do certain things that he must do now
[1:09:33] but he will now fulfill through the
[1:09:36] bride that work which he left for this
[1:09:39] specific time can you say Amen so your
[1:09:41] life is not a waste get that out of your
[1:09:44] heads your life is not a waste no matter
[1:09:46] where you're at how discouraged you are
[1:09:48] and how small you feel and insignificant
[1:09:51] your life is not a waste if you're part
[1:09:53] of this boss body can you say amen and
[1:09:55] and God would send a message to make
[1:09:57] sure your life ain't a waste amen you're
[1:10:00] not just a pile of stones amen just here
[1:10:03] gathered up that God would send a
[1:10:05] message a stonemason Amen to take you as
[1:10:08] a stone take you out of that pile of
[1:10:11] rocks and begin to shape you and mold
[1:10:13] you and and all that to put you in the
[1:10:16] body now your life ain't a waste can you
[1:10:19] say amen that's right now in the body
[1:10:22] our nine spirit spiritual gifts that are
[1:10:24] still in operation amen today and and
[1:10:29] and they're they're within the body and
[1:10:31] and so I I do not believe that gifts are
[1:10:35] only being used outside the body of
[1:10:37] Christ if there's an impersonation still
[1:10:40] happening there's still a true that's
[1:10:42] still happening amen see so uh uh I I
[1:10:46] believe in the fifo ministry uh it is
[1:10:49] still in operation pastors teachers
[1:10:51] prophets evangelists ain't that right
[1:10:54] missionaries and and things like that uh
[1:10:57] uh they they God put them in in his body
[1:11:02] uh brother Brown said they are
[1:11:03] predestinated gifts amen see and so if
[1:11:07] we believe that the five gifts are in
[1:11:10] the body then there's got to be the nine
[1:11:13] spiritual gifts still in operation for
[1:11:16] God by Divine wisdom put them gifts in
[1:11:20] that body amen see so now I I want to
[1:11:24] say this cuz I uh uh a week ago or so
[1:11:28] heard a brother uh uh taking away these
[1:11:30] nine spiritual gifts out of the church
[1:11:33] uh because he says and he and he ties
[1:11:35] them with the first and second pull and
[1:11:38] he say see we're not in that second
[1:11:39] third pull we're in the third pull well
[1:11:42] first of all the nine spiritual gifts
[1:11:44] were in the body before the first and
[1:11:46] second pull and you never find brother
[1:11:49] brandham attributing the first and
[1:11:51] second pull to us
[1:11:54] that was for his ministry his ministry
[1:11:57] the nine spiritual gifts are for the
[1:11:59] body of Christ the first and second pull
[1:12:02] was for his ministry amen and that's
[1:12:05] what brother that's what the angel told
[1:12:07] brother brandom it's for your ministry
[1:12:09] it's for your Vindication can you say
[1:12:12] Amen gifts gifts the spiritual gifts are
[1:12:15] not for a Vindication of me not
[1:12:18] Vindication of you not Vindication of
[1:12:20] anybody it's it gifts have a purpose but
[1:12:24] the first and second pull was the
[1:12:26] Vindication of his ministry to catch our
[1:12:30] [Applause]
[1:12:31] attention can you say Amen so so the the
[1:12:35] first and second pull uh now this is
[1:12:37] just me the way I see it the way brother
[1:12:39] I feel like brother Brown taught it it
[1:12:41] was for him amen but the nine spiritual
[1:12:44] gifts are still in this body they are
[1:12:47] amen see so uh uh um uh you know I I see
[1:12:52] personally where where where according
[1:12:54] to the message where uh uh Satan took
[1:12:58] the gifts out of of the body and and he
[1:13:01] he he took uh he took a lot of things
[1:13:04] out of the body through the church ages
[1:13:06] that bride tree and it nearly killed the
[1:13:08] tree took it down to a stump ain't that
[1:13:10] right and then according to the message
[1:13:13] I see where God restored all this that
[1:13:15] Satan took out He restored it back into
[1:13:18] the body do you believe that see so so
[1:13:21] then here comes the the the word the
[1:13:24] perfect word the restored word amen and
[1:13:27] and we never I I have never seen where
[1:13:30] brother brandham took the gifts the nine
[1:13:33] spiritual gifts or even done away with
[1:13:35] the five gifts uh uh uh the five-fold
[1:13:39] ministry it's interesting how people
[1:13:41] want to take the five-fold ministry out
[1:13:43] amen but they'll only take the four
[1:13:46] gifts Pastor PR uh uh Pastor teacher
[1:13:49] evangelist and missionary and and they
[1:13:51] believe in one gift the prophet you know
[1:13:54] and and most of the time it's not
[1:13:56] brother brandom as the prophet it's some
[1:13:58] other Prophet oh so so they'll take out
[1:14:02] every gift except that one guy that one
[1:14:06] Prophet you you understand what I'm
[1:14:07] saying amen but God never promised that
[1:14:10] that's right never did never did see so
[1:14:15] uh uh uh then they want to limit you
[1:14:17] know uh oh oh well we believe in the
[1:14:19] five-fold ministry but you they just
[1:14:21] need to play tapes
[1:14:24] nonsense amen nonsense any preacher
[1:14:27] that's thinking about that you you just
[1:14:29] keep on
[1:14:30] preaching brother brah never took that
[1:14:32] out never did see so so he never took he
[1:14:37] never took any gift out of the body of
[1:14:40] Christ amen but rather He restored our
[1:14:43] faith our faith to believe in the whole
[1:14:46] word of God Amen you see for him to take
[1:14:50] for him to take anything out of the word
[1:14:52] out of the body which God put in that
[1:14:56] body based upon the word of God would be
[1:14:59] him to be a curse then you would be
[1:15:01] following a man that even Paul would
[1:15:04] consider a cursed ain't that right for
[1:15:07] Paul said in Galatians 1 and8 though we
[1:15:10] or an angel from heaven preach any other
[1:15:13] gospel unto you than that which we have
[1:15:17] preached unto you let him be a curse as
[1:15:19] we said before so say I now again if any
[1:15:22] man preach any other gospel unto you
[1:15:25] than that you have received let him be a
[1:15:29] cursed can you say Amen now we're not
[1:15:32] pro following a message that's been
[1:15:34] cursed we're not pro uh following a man
[1:15:38] and saying that he is a prophet of
[1:15:40] Malachi 4 and say then now that that man
[1:15:43] is cursed because he took out gifts out
[1:15:45] of the Bible he took or out of out of
[1:15:47] the body of Christ and he took the
[1:15:50] spirit he took the anointing he took uh
[1:15:52] uh divine Supernatural out of the body
[1:15:55] of Christ he never did that and we're
[1:15:57] not following a cursed message we're not
[1:15:59] following a cursed Ministry we're
[1:16:02] following a a Ministry that God himself
[1:16:05] indicated amen
[1:16:07] 1953 brother I'm just going to read some
[1:16:09] quotes 1953 God gives gifts and put
[1:16:13] people in the church for different
[1:16:15] things a confirmation of his word and
[1:16:19] love
[1:16:20] 1954 God has set in the church some
[1:16:23] Apostles prophets teachers Gifts of
[1:16:25] healings speaking in tongues
[1:16:27] interpretation of tongues uh and all
[1:16:29] different uh all the different gifts he
[1:16:32] said in the church for the edifying of
[1:16:34] the church to bring the church together
[1:16:36] to make us one is that right to make us
[1:16:39] one in him a Brotherhood of one Soul one
[1:16:42] heart one body one spirit for we're not
[1:16:46] baptized in two Spirits one Spirit one
[1:16:50] God father of us all through all in all
[1:16:53] overall there's where these gifts in the
[1:16:55] church some of them can speak with
[1:16:57] tongues speak uh a gift of speaking with
[1:17:00] tongues another one has the gift of
[1:17:02] interpretation of tongues some are sent
[1:17:04] to preach see now we know that people
[1:17:07] that don't believe uh uh uh in Divine
[1:17:10] gifts and yet they're preachers well how
[1:17:12] did they get their inspiration then to
[1:17:13] preach from if there's not a gift of
[1:17:16] preaching then according to that every
[1:17:19] uh uh person is a preacher then see if
[1:17:22] there's not a certain gift for preaching
[1:17:24] than everyone's a preacher ain't that
[1:17:26] right see uh uh but the Bible said God
[1:17:29] has set some in the church God has
[1:17:32] Apostles prophets teachers evangelists
[1:17:34] pastors so forth all in the church see
[1:17:37] God has set them in there and they're
[1:17:39] inspired for a certain work ain't that
[1:17:43] right and then some people may possess
[1:17:46] more than one gift but there at least uh
[1:17:50] be one gift or more in a person see uh
[1:17:54] then all these things together working
[1:17:57] together for the upbuilding of the body
[1:17:59] of Christ getting her ready to go ain't
[1:18:02] that right so so that was in uh uh 1954
[1:18:06] 1957 and I could have went a lot more
[1:18:08] quotes I I didn't want to take up your
[1:18:10] time but 1957 I believe in all the
[1:18:12] manifestation of the gifts but they must
[1:18:14] be reverently placed in the body working
[1:18:16] exactly in harmony with the word of God
[1:18:19] 1960 brother Brandon in praying said May
[1:18:22] there be Gifts of Prophecy and all
[1:18:24] different manifestations not make belief
[1:18:27] or try to believe or put on may it be
[1:18:30] real genuine coming with the word the
[1:18:33] word of God made known prophesying
[1:18:36] things that comes to pass you said in
[1:18:38] your word Lord if there be one among you
[1:18:41] who claims to be or supposed to be a
[1:18:43] prophet and what he says and if he don't
[1:18:45] it don't come to pass don't hear him if
[1:18:47] it does come to pass then hear that
[1:18:49] Prophet for I'm with him God give us
[1:18:51] that kind of prophets give us the real
[1:18:53] kind the real kind that speaks with
[1:18:55] tongues the real kind that has the real
[1:18:59] interpretations right 1962 if you
[1:19:02] couldn't take my word then you'd just
[1:19:04] have to go see or if I couldn't take
[1:19:06] your word I you know it'd have to go but
[1:19:09] see that's not that's not that God's not
[1:19:12] that way he sends gifts into the church
[1:19:15] Apostles what is an apostle missionary
[1:19:18] missionary is one cent see Apostle one
[1:19:21] cent see a prophet that's a Seer a
[1:19:23] pastor a teacher evangelist all those
[1:19:25] things they rightly divide the word of
[1:19:27] God bring it down then the gifts of the
[1:19:30] Spirit to work in the church to confirm
[1:19:33] the word to show that Jesus Christ lives
[1:19:37] in the church these all these gifts are
[1:19:40] to confirm the word to show that Jesus
[1:19:43] Christ is in the church can you say Amen
[1:19:47] 63 being baptized by this token into the
[1:19:50] body of Christ 1 Corinthians uh first 1
[1:19:52] Corinthians 12 now we are subject to
[1:19:56] gifts of the Spirit that's in there see
[1:19:59] in the body the world don't believe in
[1:20:01] gifts the church don't believe in gifts
[1:20:03] but God's word says there's gifts and it
[1:20:06] only and it takes only that token to
[1:20:10] identify those gifts absolutely in 65 in
[1:20:14] that body is nine spiritual gifts
[1:20:17] operating through the local church uh
[1:20:19] the local body the local church that's
[1:20:21] Apostolic if I ever knew of it ain't
[1:20:24] that right so so so there brother BR
[1:20:27] never took gifts out of the church in
[1:20:29] and
[1:20:30] whatsoever that is part of our ministry
[1:20:34] amen of of of the body and and so now
[1:20:37] brother brandham condemned the
[1:20:39] Pentecostals churches for being so
[1:20:42] gullible and believe me they they were
[1:20:44] and they are gullible and and and it's
[1:20:47] so sad to say that people in the message
[1:20:49] are so gullible you know uh uh which
[1:20:52] shows that not all Israel is Israel
[1:20:54] right and so they they you know the
[1:20:56] Pentecostals they were teaching and
[1:20:58] accepting anything that wasn't even in
[1:21:01] the word they wouldn't even check it
[1:21:02] with the word they just oh wow they said
[1:21:04] it's of god let's go for it you know and
[1:21:07] and it's not true so brother Brown says
[1:21:09] this he says many of us go into church
[1:21:11] by shaking hands many of us by baptism
[1:21:14] many of us by
[1:21:16] sensation they've even got it down in
[1:21:18] the Southlands that you're not you ain't
[1:21:20] got the Holy Ghost until there's allil
[1:21:22] pouring out of your face or out of your
[1:21:24] your hands could you imagine being under
[1:21:26] that kind of teaching oh the pressure oh
[1:21:29] goodness you know let let me drink
[1:21:31] enough oil so it come out of my ears or
[1:21:32] something I don't know you know but but
[1:21:35] the pressure that they put people under
[1:21:37] the confusion that they put people under
[1:21:40] see uh other they crazy ideas see oh the
[1:21:43] weakness of the Pentecostal Church how
[1:21:45] long will you stand such things no
[1:21:47] wonder God can't restore the gifts and
[1:21:49] put them in the church he has no
[1:21:51] Foundation to lay it on see he will
[1:21:55] never lay it on anything but the
[1:21:57] foundation of the word of God no wonder
[1:21:59] these things are happening the way he
[1:22:01] knows the hearts of men he knows what's
[1:22:03] in you no matter what you say here he
[1:22:06] knows what's in you and he can't lay uh
[1:22:09] uh that foundation on anything else but
[1:22:13] this Bible see and and when we become so
[1:22:16] frazzled and so weak until we fall for
[1:22:19] every little wind of Doctrine we're like
[1:22:22] a leaf on an Autumn Lake that every
[1:22:25] little wind sweeps us this way and that
[1:22:28] way but be stable on the word of God we
[1:22:31] don't follow after gifts we know they're
[1:22:33] in the church but we're stable on the
[1:22:36] word of God we don't accept everything
[1:22:39] that is of God we're stable on the word
[1:22:41] of God Amen be stable on the word of God
[1:22:46] for you'll never pass with the that word
[1:22:48] prise God Amen so notice a lot of quotes
[1:22:51] but brother BR says now if I'm his
[1:22:53] servant then his word would come through
[1:22:55] a servant see seers prophets whatever
[1:22:58] you want to call them see that would be
[1:23:01] secondarily to the individual is that
[1:23:04] right he says see this is his word for
[1:23:06] the world but then he has set in the
[1:23:08] church Apostles prophets Gifts of
[1:23:11] healing speaking with tongu
[1:23:12] interpretation of tongues and all
[1:23:14] different kinds of gifts see and God has
[1:23:17] set them then but this is God's word
[1:23:20] first then my word if I be a servant
[1:23:24] must compare with that word if it isn't
[1:23:27] it isn't true you understand what I'm
[1:23:29] saying if the gifts ain't working with
[1:23:32] the word it ain't
[1:23:33] true amen everything must compare with
[1:23:36] the word of God everything and if we're
[1:23:39] members of that body then he is able to
[1:23:42] operate Accord with me according to the
[1:23:44] word of God and he's able to operate to
[1:23:47] all of us according to the word of God
[1:23:49] as members of his body can you say Amen
[1:23:52] if if if if if we're called to preach he
[1:23:54] will take us and put his word in our
[1:23:57] mouth and we will preach that word and
[1:23:59] we know what the word is the message of
[1:24:01] today not Baptist not not yesterday's
[1:24:04] the message of today can you say amen
[1:24:07] that's right see if we've got the same
[1:24:09] Ministry amen then then we've got the
[1:24:12] same passion we got the same motives we
[1:24:14] got the same goals and that is go get
[1:24:16] after that bride go go go after that one
[1:24:18] can you say Amen wow we're going to get
[1:24:20] out of here Sunday amen I can't help it
[1:24:22] that people reject the message of that
[1:24:24] and brother brandom couldn't help it but
[1:24:25] he preached It
[1:24:26] Anyways preach
[1:24:29] it testify of it so now notice he says
[1:24:34] now God can work through anything
[1:24:36] anything that he has promised anything
[1:24:38] that he has
[1:24:39] promised he could work he could work a
[1:24:42] dream if there's no Pro if there was no
[1:24:44] Prophet then he could work a dream no
[1:24:46] matter what our little gifts are God can
[1:24:50] speak to us in any way he wants to but
[1:24:52] it has to be with the word am ain't that
[1:24:56] right now you know and and we'll get
[1:24:58] into it more but brother Brown said if
[1:25:00] there's a dream and there's not a
[1:25:02] prophet then then the way he done it
[1:25:04] with because he said you know the
[1:25:05] prophet interprets the
[1:25:07] dream so he said like like with Joseph
[1:25:09] there you know having problems with
[1:25:12] dealing with Mary's situation he was
[1:25:15] minded to put her away but there was no
[1:25:17] Prophet that he could go to for the word
[1:25:18] of God so the God gave him a dream but
[1:25:23] what did he say that the the dream was
[1:25:27] with the word it didn't need interpreted
[1:25:30] amen it didn't need interpreted are you
[1:25:33] with me it didn't leave Joseph in
[1:25:36] confusion and then say okay now what do
[1:25:38] I do where's a prophet that I can
[1:25:39] interpret this dream no no no no it was
[1:25:43] already so explanatory that when he got
[1:25:45] up he knew it was of God it lined up
[1:25:48] with the word of God Behold a virgin
[1:25:49] shall conceive he knew by that dream God
[1:25:53] spoke to him that Mary was that Virgin
[1:25:55] of that
[1:25:58] scripture ain't that right see it has to
[1:26:01] be the word it has to be according to
[1:26:03] the word so now every true sign you know
[1:26:07] uh uh is sent from God has a voice
[1:26:10] behind it do you believe that it's what
[1:26:12] brother Ram said every true sign so if
[1:26:15] you're dream if you if if you got a
[1:26:18] dream and it's going to lead you away
[1:26:19] from the word of God then you better
[1:26:21] watch that voice amen you know someone
[1:26:24] have a dream and say well you you're
[1:26:25] supposed to move out to Tim Buck too you
[1:26:27] know and so you just follow the dream
[1:26:29] and ain't no no church ain't no nothing
[1:26:32] you just out there because based off of
[1:26:34] a dream something wrong with
[1:26:37] that ain't that right how many people
[1:26:39] have gone to churches other left their
[1:26:41] church and go to another church based
[1:26:42] off dreams of somebody else that they
[1:26:45] that had a dream and it caus nothing but
[1:26:47] trouble
[1:26:49] there you know what I'm saying it it's
[1:26:52] it's because they didn't go by Leading
[1:26:54] of of the Lord they went by dream you're
[1:26:57] not supposed to be led by
[1:27:01] dreams amen true
[1:27:04] amen amen so every true sign that is
[1:27:09] sent from God has a voice behind it
[1:27:12] notice brother Brown says now Satan can
[1:27:15] impersonate almost anything there
[1:27:18] is and he says there are signs that are
[1:27:21] not of God
[1:27:22] God there's things that are not of God
[1:27:26] ain't that right but a true sign sent
[1:27:29] from God will have a scriptural voice
[1:27:32] behind it yes sir ain't that right
[1:27:35] aren't you glad you have a prophet in
[1:27:37] this
[1:27:38] day a word
[1:27:40] Prophet the seals have been open
[1:27:43] Vindicated so thoroughly that you have
[1:27:45] no questions about
[1:27:47] it that you've got able to read behind
[1:27:50] be between the lines and understand
[1:27:52] understand the whole scope of
[1:27:56] things now notice see it's got to have a
[1:27:59] scriptural voice behind it now notice
[1:28:02] see so every dream got to be by the word
[1:28:05] every gift got to be by the word every
[1:28:08] prophecy got to be according to the word
[1:28:09] and you know you you have every right to
[1:28:12] judge these things it's got to be
[1:28:15] judged spiritual people got to judge it
[1:28:18] it's got to be judged and and and and
[1:28:20] and we'll get more into that but brother
[1:28:22] says these they they they got to be
[1:28:24] tried and
[1:28:25] true the the the the people that are
[1:28:27] judging
[1:28:28] it you know uh uh and these things but
[1:28:32] but it's got to be by the word of God
[1:28:33] based upon the word now notice what the
[1:28:35] prophet said she's fixing to bring forth
[1:28:39] the perfect word back there and the word
[1:28:43] is coming for the word bride
[1:28:47] right I I truly believe that he saw us
[1:28:50] amen I I believe that this was prophetic
[1:28:53] of you and
[1:28:56] I that that which is perfect has come
[1:28:59] all the nonsense is going to be done
[1:29:01] away
[1:29:02] with see so so she's fixing to bring
[1:29:06] forth the church is fixing to bring
[1:29:08] forth that perfect word back there and
[1:29:11] the word is coming for the word bride
[1:29:14] see the shuck see uh uh you you know
[1:29:18] what brother Bram said in in the the
[1:29:20] seed shall not be air and with the Shu
[1:29:22] and is not air with the shook preach
[1:29:24] titled it both different ways but but
[1:29:27] the Shu we thought that that was the
[1:29:29] seed but it wasn't the seed it had to
[1:29:31] open up and and it rejected the message
[1:29:34] it rejected the message it it rejected
[1:29:37] us it rejected the seed but all the life
[1:29:39] went into the
[1:29:40] seed and that's
[1:29:42] us we we're not Chuck we're we're were
[1:29:46] the genuine word seed that are ripening
[1:29:49] in the presence of the sun I'm not
[1:29:50] ashamed of this message
[1:29:52] I'm not ashamed of what God has done in
[1:29:54] this age I don't care who believes it
[1:29:56] and who don't believe it I ain't scared
[1:29:57] to offend anyone about it God sent a
[1:30:00] prophet I believe it it's my
[1:30:04] message and if they kicked him out
[1:30:06] they're going to kick you out just as
[1:30:07] much now we're not trying to be odd
[1:30:10] brother Bram never tried to be odd he
[1:30:12] was the he was the most friendliest
[1:30:13] loving kindness guy man there was and I
[1:30:17] think all of us need to be that way we
[1:30:19] should never walk up with with out of
[1:30:21] this and and go to our jobs or out in
[1:30:24] the stores and all that with our nose
[1:30:25] stuck up like we're some big hot shot
[1:30:28] amen no sir amen we are what we are by
[1:30:31] the grace of God God called you God
[1:30:33] ordained you but don't be ashamed of
[1:30:35] this
[1:30:38] message see so she's fixing to bring
[1:30:41] forth the perfect word back there and
[1:30:43] the word is coming for the word bride
[1:30:45] see a woman is part of a man taken from
[1:30:48] him so the church will have to be a word
[1:30:51] dividing Church church every word of the
[1:30:53] Bible not systems dogmas or nothing
[1:30:55] added to it it'll have to be an
[1:30:58] unadulterated pure virgin word can you
[1:31:02] say Amen now we we know that the the
[1:31:05] restoration of the gifts are part of the
[1:31:07] word uh uh the same as justification and
[1:31:11] sanctification but but every one of them
[1:31:15] uh Through the Ages denominations got it
[1:31:18] all mixed up with their own ideas and
[1:31:21] and creeds and showing that they did not
[1:31:24] eat from the Tree of Life they ate from
[1:31:26] the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:31:29] it's a mixed
[1:31:31] tree so they they didn't bring forth Eve
[1:31:34] did not bring forth a pure word
[1:31:37] son amen so so they get every they get
[1:31:41] all this stuff justification s
[1:31:43] everything that God done the Revival
[1:31:45] that God sent them they mixed it up with
[1:31:47] denominational ideas and teaching and
[1:31:50] but but in this age we're living in the
[1:31:53] evening light do you believe that we're
[1:31:56] living in the evening light and notice
[1:31:59] what brother Brown says it means that
[1:32:01] the
[1:32:02] denominational have faded away and the
[1:32:05] token has been
[1:32:07] applied and the token is Christ do you
[1:32:11] believe that see John 14:18 I will not
[1:32:14] leave you comfortless I will come to you
[1:32:17] amen yet a little while and the world
[1:32:19] seeth me no more but you see me because
[1:32:22] I live you shall live also and at that
[1:32:24] day you shall know that I'm in my father
[1:32:26] you in me and I in you see it's not a
[1:32:29] sensation that we have received it's not
[1:32:31] a doctrine that we have received it's
[1:32:33] it's not an emotion that has come to us
[1:32:36] it's the living word that has come to us
[1:32:38] it's the quickening power the Dynamics
[1:32:41] that has come to us it's it's bringing a
[1:32:44] pure word see what is it brother Bram
[1:32:47] said it's uniting time of God and his
[1:32:51] bride
[1:32:52] coming together it's uniting time he
[1:32:54] said see the churches are uniting
[1:32:56] nations are uniting the unbeliever see
[1:32:59] the unbeliever and make Believers are
[1:33:00] actually uniting you don't find a makeb
[1:33:02] believer in this day really truly
[1:33:04] uniting with a real believer they ain't
[1:33:07] going to do that because if you stay
[1:33:09] with the message it shows them up every
[1:33:11] time shows just how carnal they are
[1:33:13] shows the carnal Ministry they have and
[1:33:15] shows their carnal actions and and and
[1:33:18] really their unbelief it it it's just
[1:33:20] there so it's the unbeliever and the
[1:33:22] make Believers that are uniting amen but
[1:33:25] but you'll never find a True Believer
[1:33:27] amen that that'll feel at home with the
[1:33:29] unbeliever and the makeb believer you
[1:33:31] know where they feel at home around the
[1:33:33] carcass of God's word Eagles Eagles are
[1:33:37] gathering amen Eagles are gathering
[1:33:40] around the word of God Eagles feel at
[1:33:43] home together because they're not
[1:33:46] gathering around some man's idea some
[1:33:50] personality some man's Ministry they're
[1:33:53] gathered around the word of God the
[1:33:56] revealed word now brother Braham said
[1:33:58] see I say this with reverence and
[1:34:01] respect I believe that the bride of
[1:34:03] Christ is called I believe she is sealed
[1:34:06] in the kingdom of God I believe the
[1:34:09] mechanics is there they're waiting for
[1:34:12] the Dynamics that'll take her off the
[1:34:14] earth into glory in the Rapture I
[1:34:17] believe it with all of my heart yes sir
[1:34:19] we know we don't know how he's going to
[1:34:22] do it but he shall do it he is the
[1:34:27] Dynamics he is the Dynamics we just
[1:34:30] become members of the machine of his
[1:34:33] body forming ourselves into his image
[1:34:36] and see him uniting himself with us in
[1:34:41] works with his love gifts as he hands
[1:34:44] them to us just before the wedding
[1:34:46] supper we're waiting we're watching for
[1:34:48] that notice the Dynamics of this church
[1:34:51] will will be a refilling of the holy
[1:34:53] spirit that we have worked in a small
[1:34:55] measure while The Headstone is coming
[1:34:57] down to unite with the body but when the
[1:35:00] head and body unites together the full
[1:35:04] power of the Holy Ghost will raise her
[1:35:07] up just exactly like that and I say the
[1:35:10] full power of the Holy Ghost is here the
[1:35:13] holy spirit that has been bound by these
[1:35:15] denominational Rivers has been loosed in
[1:35:17] this evening time by the evening time
[1:35:19] message the D dyamics is here upon the
[1:35:24] mechanics he said see when that head and
[1:35:27] body unites together the full power of
[1:35:29] the Holy Ghost will raise her up just
[1:35:30] exactly like that even the dead that's
[1:35:33] dead in Christ for hundreds of years ago
[1:35:35] will rise in the beauty of his Holiness
[1:35:37] and take a flight to the skies the
[1:35:39] Dynamics is the Holy Spirit you see the
[1:35:41] difference between our understanding the
[1:35:43] world and the Christian world they're
[1:35:44] prophesying America America America
[1:35:46] God's going to bless America Revival
[1:35:48] Coming to America but we have an
[1:35:50] understanding we know he's with us they
[1:35:52] don't see him the way we see him they
[1:35:55] don't understand who he is in this day
[1:35:57] he is the Dynamics that has come to us
[1:35:59] and has quickened us we have come head
[1:36:02] and body has United together now we're
[1:36:06] saying even so Lord Jesus
[1:36:10] come see it's you notice it's you and
[1:36:14] Christ as persons together it's the Holy
[1:36:17] Spirit his life in
[1:36:18] you working his own life through you
[1:36:23] another place the new token is the new
[1:36:25] life that comes through Jesus Christ
[1:36:27] when his blood was shed to sanctify a
[1:36:29] church and fill it with his presence
[1:36:31] that he might manifest his word and his
[1:36:36] promises to the people God going to
[1:36:38] manifest his promises God's going to
[1:36:40] manifest his word God's going to do
[1:36:42] carry his word out through somebody amen
[1:36:45] it might as well be us can you say amen
[1:36:49] that's why we must be sincere more than
[1:36:50] we've ever never had before get out of
[1:36:52] our worldly ideas and our our
[1:36:54] materialistic thinking I understand that
[1:36:56] we' got to live we got to we got to make
[1:36:58] dos and all that but don't you let life
[1:37:00] overtake you and this life become more
[1:37:03] prominent in your life than this word
[1:37:05] this
[1:37:06] message don't ever get too
[1:37:11] busy we're
[1:37:13] coming amen we're ready for a Rapture
[1:37:17] this life means nothing to
[1:37:18] us amen can you amen amen not making
[1:37:23] more excuses anymore no life God has
[1:37:26] become the most important thing church
[1:37:29] is important to us preaching is
[1:37:31] important sing Everything is
[1:37:33] important to us our coming in this place
[1:37:37] our attitudes is important to
[1:37:39] us yes
[1:37:42] sir see so notice now he in another
[1:37:46] place it's the head everybody say it's
[1:37:48] the head Christ see see so he's the
[1:37:53] Dynamics he's he's he's the the
[1:37:58] token now he's saying it's the head amen
[1:38:02] Christ coming to the body the body of
[1:38:03] Christ he is the one who knows see my my
[1:38:06] hand don't know how to act just by my
[1:38:08] head but he is the one who knows why
[1:38:12] He's the head that's the reason he is
[1:38:15] the word I'm not the word I'm a man
[1:38:18] you're not the word you're just a man a
[1:38:20] woman part of a body he's the word he's
[1:38:25] the
[1:38:26] head now because the head knows he knows
[1:38:30] what his will is he knows what God wants
[1:38:32] done he's the one he's the
[1:38:36] intelligence ain't that right see I'm
[1:38:38] not the word I'm a man see he said but
[1:38:41] you see he uses this body because he
[1:38:44] died to sanctify this body that he might
[1:38:46] use it and give a gift just like pulling
[1:38:49] it out of gear
[1:38:51] then the Holy Spirit takes over
[1:38:55] amen amen God see another place it's
[1:38:58] like the head has to go to take the foot
[1:39:01] the head has to go to take the hand the
[1:39:03] head has to go to take the heart the
[1:39:05] head has to go to take the mouth in
[1:39:06] other words you got to have a
[1:39:08] head if the mouth is going to speak you
[1:39:11] got to have a head the hands are going
[1:39:12] to move you got to have a head right
[1:39:16] body can't do nothing without
[1:39:18] headship cu the intelligence is in the
[1:39:20] head
[1:39:21] and the head has come to the body we're
[1:39:24] not doing our own will no more we we are
[1:39:26] now the only thing you don't have to
[1:39:27] work up a gift well if I could just have
[1:39:29] a dream if God would just use me if God
[1:39:31] just used me yield to him yield to this
[1:39:34] word yield to the message just believe
[1:39:37] make yourself
[1:39:39] available
[1:39:41] headship he will use you when he wants
[1:39:43] to use
[1:39:47] [Music]
[1:39:48] you brother Brown said see the the last
[1:39:51] thing is is his divine presence the word
[1:39:55] itself he is the word the head the word
[1:39:58] it's coming to the body so his divine
[1:40:00] presence the word is come to the body
[1:40:04] the Lord I'm so glad for that
[1:40:06] amen even though each member has their
[1:40:10] own Ministry and is used in different
[1:40:12] ways every one of us as members of the
[1:40:14] body are under the same headship it's
[1:40:17] the same spirit that operates each
[1:40:19] member of the body Now 1 Corinthians
[1:40:23] 12:4 now there are diversities of gifts
[1:40:26] but the Same Spirit there are
[1:40:28] differences of administrations but the
[1:40:31] same Lord there are diversities of
[1:40:34] operations but it's the same God which
[1:40:36] worketh all in all see it's all under
[1:40:39] headship but the manifestation of the
[1:40:41] spirit is given to every man to provit
[1:40:43] with all for to one is given by the
[1:40:47] spirit the word of wisdom Amen to
[1:40:49] another the word of knowledge knowledge
[1:40:51] by The Same Spirit to another Faith by
[1:40:55] The Same Spirit to another Gifts of
[1:40:56] healing by The Same Spirit to another
[1:40:59] working of Miracles to another prophecy
[1:41:01] to another Discerning of spirits to
[1:41:02] another diverse kinds of tongues to
[1:41:04] another the interpretation of tongues
[1:41:06] but all these worketh that one and
[1:41:08] self-same spirit dividing to every man
[1:41:11] severally as he will ain't that right so
[1:41:15] it's the same Spirit Dynamics amen token
[1:41:19] right that that is operating throughout
[1:41:22] the
[1:41:23] body hope you understand that see don't
[1:41:29] I don't I don't know where what you all
[1:41:30] have been taught with gifts and and
[1:41:32] things but gifts belong in the
[1:41:35] body and he's here he's here to operate
[1:41:39] them things in a perfect
[1:41:44] way now brother Braham said God's
[1:41:47] Eternal Plan of Salvation for his people
[1:41:50] is the Holy Spirit in the church so say
[1:41:53] that again that's powerful brother BR
[1:41:55] said God's Eternal plan for his people
[1:41:58] is the holy spirit in the church Born
[1:42:02] Again men and women operated by the Holy
[1:42:05] Spirit not trying to operate the Holy
[1:42:08] Spirit but the Holy Spirit operating
[1:42:11] them that's right don't try to be
[1:42:15] somebody just be yielded to the Holy
[1:42:18] Spirit that's God's Eternal Plan of
[1:42:20] Salvation
[1:42:21] is Christ in
[1:42:24] you you believe
[1:42:26] it can't be dissatisfied with our gifts
[1:42:29] can't be dissatisfied with our calling
[1:42:32] whatever God has called us to be let's
[1:42:34] do it with everything that's within us
[1:42:36] let him have his P full potential in
[1:42:41] US Yes
[1:42:44] sirl again those in his body his bride
[1:42:48] do only his will what does that mean it
[1:42:51] shows that he is able to have
[1:42:53] preeminence in his bride yes sir brother
[1:42:56] Braham said if you're born of the word
[1:42:57] of God if you're born of the word of God
[1:43:00] baptized by one Spirit into one body
[1:43:02] God's word has preeminence in his church
[1:43:05] that's what he died for that's his
[1:43:07] purpose that he might be able to achieve
[1:43:09] to have preeminence working in his
[1:43:12] church how we need more word
[1:43:17] birth amen true we need more word birth
[1:43:21] word birth then God can have
[1:43:25] preeminence
[1:43:28] yes that's right that's
[1:43:31] true Romans
[1:43:33] 8:14 Paul said for as many as are led by
[1:43:36] the spirit they are the sons of
[1:43:39] God they're not led by feelings they're
[1:43:42] not led by emotions they're not led by
[1:43:45] Impressions they're led by the spirit of
[1:43:48] God Amen these people God is able to
[1:43:51] have total preeminence they'll be
[1:43:54] misunderstood but they'll be right with
[1:43:56] the
[1:43:56] word they'll not be popular but they'll
[1:43:59] be right with the
[1:44:01] word they they they may not even
[1:44:03] understand themselves but it'll all be
[1:44:05] right with the word yeah you believe it
[1:44:07] they're not led by feelings
[1:44:09] emotions all these things see they have
[1:44:12] thus sayi the Lord they keep still that
[1:44:14] what the prophet said they have thus
[1:44:16] sayth the Lord or they keep still yes
[1:44:18] sir Impressions don't move them right
[1:44:21] feelings emotions don't move them you
[1:44:24] know whatever you know there see every
[1:44:27] member of the body is disciplined now to
[1:44:30] the word of God to the word it's a word
[1:44:32] birth amen and so their thoughts are
[1:44:35] disciplined to the word their actions
[1:44:36] are disciplined to the word their gift
[1:44:38] is disciplined to the word their
[1:44:39] Ministry is disciplined to the word
[1:44:41] brother Bram says if the spirit leads
[1:44:43] you contrary to the word then it's not
[1:44:45] of the spirit of God that's right I
[1:44:46] don't care what it is and this is where
[1:44:49] people get so mixed up on God Godly love
[1:44:51] and human love human love takes them
[1:44:53] totally contrary to the word of God
[1:44:55] every time compassion compassion
[1:44:58] compassion compassion and by compassion
[1:45:01] they're building hospitals and by
[1:45:02] compassion they're having you know all
[1:45:04] of these these societies and by
[1:45:07] compassion God never told us to do them
[1:45:09] things that's right come on Brother come
[1:45:11] on
[1:45:12] brother amen see so if the spirit leads
[1:45:15] you contrary to the word then it's not
[1:45:17] the spirit of God if the holy spirit is
[1:45:19] leading you it'll say Jesus Christ the
[1:45:22] same yesterday today and forever if it's
[1:45:24] a religious spirit or some other type of
[1:45:26] spirit that isn't of the spirit of God
[1:45:27] it'll say oh that was for a day gone by
[1:45:30] don't worry about that right he says so
[1:45:33] how can you make that act right now
[1:45:36] we've read it before but in another
[1:45:38] place he says make no mistake about it a
[1:45:40] person that is truly baptized by the
[1:45:42] Holy Ghost into the body of Christ
[1:45:44] receiving the fullness of the spirit
[1:45:46] will be in the word all the way that is
[1:45:49] the evidence of being baptized with the
[1:45:51] Holy Ghost that's why a True Believer
[1:45:54] that's in the word all the way does not
[1:45:56] take away dancing shouting worshiping
[1:45:59] praising God it doesn't take away all
[1:46:01] these things it's in the word you're in
[1:46:03] the word all the way can you say amen
[1:46:06] that's why we don't take gifts out of
[1:46:07] the church that's why we don't we just
[1:46:09] we we come as a word people yielded to
[1:46:13] the word of God that God you just have
[1:46:16] your way
[1:46:17] tonight can you say Amen why we're in
[1:46:20] the word all the way from Genesis to
[1:46:22] Revelations our what our faith is based
[1:46:24] upon it runs all the way
[1:46:27] [Applause]
[1:46:29] through am in the word all the way so
[1:46:33] we're not a people that take some out
[1:46:35] and add some too make it fit our little
[1:46:39] fancy see so
[1:46:42] then if a person is in in the word all
[1:46:45] the way then he has received the spirit
[1:46:47] of truth and not the spirit of eror
[1:46:48] remember the Bible talks about the
[1:46:49] spirit of Truth and the spirit of air
[1:46:52] and and in this day there is the spirit
[1:46:54] of truth that God promised to sin but
[1:46:56] also at the same time there is the
[1:46:58] spirit of air and it's so deceptive so
[1:47:02] one one hears the truth and the other
[1:47:05] one doesn't hear one follows after the
[1:47:07] truth the other one doesn't see and and
[1:47:09] so this is how we know the difference
[1:47:11] between the TR the the the the the the
[1:47:13] two because both will operate in their
[1:47:16] Ministries both operate the gifts both
[1:47:18] are used in Prophecy t and and miracles
[1:47:22] and and and and and and both operate
[1:47:24] within the fivefold ministry just as
[1:47:26] much as anything else both carry offices
[1:47:29] in the church both they they they they
[1:47:31] both but but but one is led by the
[1:47:34] spirit of Truth the other one is led by
[1:47:36] the spirit of
[1:47:38] error come on now all right and the
[1:47:42] spirit of Truth the spirit of Truth has
[1:47:45] preeminence within the body of
[1:47:47] Christ not the spirit of air amen
[1:47:51] the spirit of air is leading those
[1:47:54] outside the
[1:47:57] body can you say amen I hope this all
[1:48:00] right but brother BR said Satan can
[1:48:03] impersonate any kind of gift that God
[1:48:05] has got but he cannot everybody say
[1:48:07] cannot one thing he cannot do he cannot
[1:48:09] bring that word word by word word by
[1:48:12] word word by word amen you realize that
[1:48:14] all the people that through all the ages
[1:48:16] have failed failed in one way or another
[1:48:19] were one way or another but in this day
[1:48:21] the word is coming perfect word bride
[1:48:24] perfect word bride perfect word bride
[1:48:28] man to be part of this yes sir to to to
[1:48:31] to be this is It's the grace of God Amen
[1:48:35] sure Judas you know was numbered with
[1:48:39] the 12 and and actually had a part with
[1:48:42] the ministry sure he did previous to to
[1:48:46] Pentecost brother Bram said he had a
[1:48:48] god-given holy ghost Ministry but lost
[1:48:52] it sure did ain't that right he said he
[1:48:55] was chosen of God was instructed in
[1:48:57] truth he shared knowledge of the
[1:48:58] Mysteries had a Ministry of power
[1:49:01] granted unto him he healed the sick cast
[1:49:03] out devils in jesus' name but when The
[1:49:05] Showdown came he solded out for gold and
[1:49:08] political power he did not go up to
[1:49:10] Pentecost to receive the spirit of God
[1:49:13] he was devoid of the spirit other place
[1:49:16] he SED Jesus see Judas SED Jesus the
[1:49:19] word to his denomination and betrayed
[1:49:21] Jesus Christ after he claimed to be a
[1:49:23] part of it notice what brother BR said
[1:49:26] if any gift or any angel or anything
[1:49:30] doesn't speak directly by the word of
[1:49:32] God it is not the right kind of Angel
[1:49:34] right amen another place false teachers
[1:49:37] can rise teaching all kinds of
[1:49:41] trinitarianism and everything else and
[1:49:43] be Anointed with the Holy Ghost and
[1:49:45] perform just as many miracles as the
[1:49:47] true gospel can but by the the word
[1:49:51] here is what does
[1:49:53] it by the word can you say Amen do you
[1:49:58] prophesy
[1:50:01] wonderful do you speak with tongues
[1:50:05] great you see Visions dreams wonderful
[1:50:09] have you had spiritual Supernatural
[1:50:11] experiences
[1:50:13] great we're glad for you amen but the
[1:50:17] question
[1:50:18] is are you standing with the
[1:50:20] [Music]
[1:50:22] word ain't that
[1:50:25] right see we we we don't deny the gifts
[1:50:28] we don't deny them things this is
[1:50:29] exactly what Jesus said we to
[1:50:33] do
[1:50:36] right but does the word have preeminence
[1:50:38] over you over your gift over your
[1:50:44] ministry is everything being checked
[1:50:46] with the word even brother Bram checked
[1:50:48] everything with the word if an angel
[1:50:50] came to him and start talking to him he
[1:50:52] said I always check it with the word
[1:50:54] always check it with a word thank God
[1:50:56] for a true word
[1:50:58] Prophet don't just say well you know
[1:51:01] what I've been in the presence of God so
[1:51:03] any Angel going to come to me is going
[1:51:04] to be just right and then he starts
[1:51:06] leading by inspir uh uh uh what what uh
[1:51:09] uh you know Impressions and this and
[1:51:11] this and all this thing nope he checked
[1:51:13] it all with the word he wanted to make
[1:51:15] sure his inspiration was right with this
[1:51:17] word can you say Amen
[1:51:20] it's a word
[1:51:22] ministry a word bride Amen brother amen
[1:51:26] one night brother brand had just started
[1:51:28] preaching and I think it was in the
[1:51:30] church ages uh he he's preaching the
[1:51:32] church ages and he just started
[1:51:33] preaching and a woman started speaking
[1:51:35] in
[1:51:36] tongues and and when she finished
[1:51:40] brother Bram didn't say nothing he just
[1:51:41] immediately started
[1:51:43] praying and in his prayer he said Our
[1:51:45] Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy
[1:51:47] name thy kingdom come thy will be done
[1:51:49] in earth as it is in heaven we ask you
[1:51:52] to be with us father and bless us and
[1:51:54] help us to be wise Master Builders in
[1:51:57] this hour of great distress amongst the
[1:52:00] people when confusion and all is being
[1:52:03] carried on help us to be our best Lord
[1:52:05] to be your servants through Christ's
[1:52:07] name amen am what a prayer
[1:52:11] right then he says this he said now I
[1:52:15] said that first that you might know did
[1:52:18] you notice the interpretation didn't
[1:52:19] come to the word see our sister was
[1:52:22] anointed with the Holy Spirit no doubt
[1:52:25] but she had gave the message after the
[1:52:27] word had already coming to see it's just
[1:52:30] a little bit from the order of the thing
[1:52:33] now that was all right dear sister
[1:52:35] whoever you are see Holy Spirit upon you
[1:52:38] oh it's so hard to hold it like that see
[1:52:41] I know he says or when you be saying
[1:52:44] something and another see that it was
[1:52:46] all right but you probably felt it even
[1:52:48] before that we started see and that's
[1:52:51] the reason see it comes back when the
[1:52:54] spirit's working the spirits of the
[1:52:57] prophesy are subject to the prophets you
[1:53:00] see that's you see so he says now maybe
[1:53:04] the Holy Spirit anoints you again I hope
[1:53:06] he does just after the service is over
[1:53:08] and you watch the interpretation come
[1:53:10] because it should be straight right be
[1:53:13] right straight in order then you see but
[1:53:16] we're just approaching the words you see
[1:53:18] in here now that was really of God it
[1:53:21] really was I I believe it and I feel it
[1:53:23] with my all my heart because I felt it
[1:53:25] come back to it you see but the Holy
[1:53:28] Spirit it wasn't time see he's got a
[1:53:30] message to the sister for the church but
[1:53:32] here here's where he's working his
[1:53:36] message now that's you see he won't
[1:53:38] confuse himself he puts all things in
[1:53:43] order wow see that's what God was doing
[1:53:47] in this age by this message putting it
[1:53:50] all in order we had a lot of confusion
[1:53:53] in
[1:53:53] Pentecost and a lot of Pentecostals have
[1:53:56] come into this message bringing a lot of
[1:53:59] confusion and a lot of Methodist and
[1:54:01] Baptist and naysay all them coming in
[1:54:03] the message bringing a lot of
[1:54:05] confusion but to this bride she has thus
[1:54:08] said the Lord and no one no one will
[1:54:11] convince her to do otherwise
[1:54:14] amen see God is not the author of
[1:54:16] confusion everything he does is
[1:54:18] according to the promise word If he
[1:54:21] prophesies if he prophesies right
[1:54:23] through you then it'll be right in line
[1:54:26] with the word of God if he speaks in
[1:54:28] tongues through you it'll speak
[1:54:30] according along right with the word of
[1:54:33] God the way the word of God says it if
[1:54:34] he interprets tongues it'll speak
[1:54:36] according to the word of God any Divine
[1:54:38] gift that God uses will operate
[1:54:40] according to the word of God it'll be in
[1:54:42] scn do you believe that now notice I'm
[1:54:44] getting ready closed now but I'm going
[1:54:46] to say some things and and I want it
[1:54:48] said this morning see but 1 Corinthians
[1:54:51] 1:10 Paul said now I beseech you
[1:54:53] Brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:54:56] Christ that you all everybody say you
[1:54:58] all speak the same thing amen amen and
[1:55:02] that there be no divisions among you but
[1:55:05] that you be perfectly joined together in
[1:55:08] the same mind and in the same judgment
[1:55:13] amen now if you notice he's not telling
[1:55:15] us all do the same thing no no no see we
[1:55:19] all don't have to work the same gift for
[1:55:22] Paul says there are diversities of gifts
[1:55:24] there's there's differences of
[1:55:25] administration there are diversities of
[1:55:27] operation one is given the word of
[1:55:29] wisdom another word of knowledge another
[1:55:32] Faith another gift of healings others G
[1:55:34] workings of Miracles gift of prophecies
[1:55:36] different you know Discerning of spirits
[1:55:38] and and and and to another divers of
[1:55:40] tongues and another interpretation of
[1:55:42] tongues but all these worketh that one
[1:55:45] and self Same Spirit dividing to every
[1:55:47] man severally as he will but but we are
[1:55:50] commanded all commanded to say the same
[1:55:54] thing amen ain't that right see so
[1:55:57] brother R says what causes division what
[1:55:59] causes it is men getting away from the
[1:56:02] word that's what causes division see see
[1:56:05] before before the Tower of Babel was
[1:56:07] built you can read about it in the Book
[1:56:09] of Genesis they were all had all one
[1:56:11] language they were all together right
[1:56:14] one heart all these things but they all
[1:56:15] spoke one language and and and brother
[1:56:18] Bram in the church AG book quotes a a
[1:56:21] writer and and this writer said see for
[1:56:24] many ages men lived under the government
[1:56:27] of of
[1:56:29] Jo J ove and then parenthesis not Roman
[1:56:34] Jo but Jehovah of the Hebrews who
[1:56:37] predates Roman history but they all
[1:56:39] lived under the government see of of
[1:56:43] Jehovah of the Hebrews without cities
[1:56:47] without laws and all speaking one
[1:56:50] language but after that mercury uh Kush
[1:56:55] uh uh uh Kush was the father of nimrod
[1:56:59] and he became the father of the Gods you
[1:57:01] see and and and he he actually ended up
[1:57:05] being called
[1:57:07] baale uh uh but but he interpreted the
[1:57:10] speeches of men see went an in
[1:57:14] interpreter is called uh some word her
[1:57:17] her Herman Herman or something like that
[1:57:21] the same individual distributed the
[1:57:23] Nations so he he he he began to take
[1:57:25] order see then Discord began see it is
[1:57:29] seen from this that Bale or Kush the
[1:57:32] father of nimrod originally was the ring
[1:57:34] leader that led the people away from the
[1:57:36] true God yes and encouraged the people
[1:57:39] as The Interpreter of gods to take
[1:57:42] another form of religion he encouraged
[1:57:44] them to go ahead with the tower which
[1:57:47] his son actually built this encouraged
[1:57:49] judement is what brought the confusion
[1:57:51] and the division of men so that he was
[1:57:53] both interpreter and
[1:57:56] confuser is that not what men have done
[1:57:59] with Satan has allowed him to be both
[1:58:02] interpreter and
[1:58:05] confuser of the word of God Amen that's
[1:58:07] right see so so then then this explains
[1:58:12] why brother Brandon would say many will
[1:58:14] misunderstand talking about the prophet
[1:58:16] of Malachi 4 when it comes many will
[1:58:18] misunderstand because they have been
[1:58:21] taught scripture in a certain way which
[1:58:24] they consider truth
[1:58:27] yeah when he comes against that of what
[1:58:31] they consider truth they will not
[1:58:33] believe even some true ministers will
[1:58:36] misunderstand the messenger because so
[1:58:39] much has been called God's truth by
[1:58:42] deceivers amen can you say Amen but does
[1:58:45] that make his message of no good oh no
[1:58:48] no no brother said he is the last
[1:58:51] Messenger to the elect and word born
[1:58:55] bride he didn't come for everybody he
[1:58:58] didn't stop all confusion in this world
[1:59:00] but he did stop it for this
[1:59:02] bride this elect this word born bride
[1:59:06] amen can you say Amen so if
[1:59:11] division is is caused by men getting
[1:59:14] away from the word of God then Unity
[1:59:17] people speaking the same thing Paul was
[1:59:19] saying comes by men staying with the
[1:59:22] word of God ain't that right so then in
[1:59:25] Revelations 10 John was commanded to go
[1:59:28] to the angel and get the book and eat
[1:59:31] it very powerful yes very important for
[1:59:36] us amen because John represented the
[1:59:39] bride for this day he represented you
[1:59:42] amen right amen and and and notice he
[1:59:47] wasn't being led by the spirit of of air

[2:04:48] the C Canon climbed up up where the
[2:04:50] Eagles was flying around I was watching
[2:04:53] some deer standing there and I knelt
[2:04:55] down to pray and raised my hand and a SW
[2:04:57] sword struck my hand I looked around and
[2:04:59] I thought what's that he said I'm not

[2:05:14] Revelation amen see he said I Heard a
[2:05:17] Voice say that's the king's SW
[2:05:19] and I said a king kns a man with the
[2:05:21] sword and he The Voice come back said
[2:05:24] not a king's sword but the king sword
[2:05:27] watch the word of the Lord and said fear
[2:05:30] not it's only the third pull can you say
[2:05:34] that with me the third pull the third
[2:05:37] pull he never Associated the first and
[2:05:40] second pull to you but he Associated the
[2:05:43] third pull to you the first and second
[2:05:46] pull was not for you and me it it was
[2:05:48] for his ministry to vindicate his
[2:05:50] ministry but the third poll which is the
[2:05:53] opening of the
[2:05:56] word coming back to a
[2:05:59] bride it's your ministry it's part of
[2:06:03] you and you say amen amen another place
[2:06:07] said something hit and said Don't Fear
[2:06:09] this is that third pool yes sir one
[2:06:11] place brother Bram identified it as the
[2:06:13] opening of the
[2:06:14] word another place he said the third
[2:06:16] pool was the opening of them Seven Seals
[2:06:18] to R the hidden truth that's been sealed
[2:06:20] in the word you get it John did not eat
[2:06:24] anything outside of what the seventh

[2:09:41] little book out of the Angel's hand now
[2:09:43] that's you this what's going to happen

[2:09:52] mouth in my mouth as sweet as sunny and
[2:09:54] as soon as I had eaten it it was in my
[2:09:57] belly

[2:10:31] wrong and and and and you can either
[2:10:35] accept it or not but I ain't you know
[2:10:36] you ain't going to be your friend just
[2:10:38] or or try to sit there and please you
[2:10:41] and Shine Your Boots just just so you
[2:10:44] accept
[2:10:45] me you eat the word it becomes bitter
[2:10:49] the world comes against
[2:10:51] you why because you're you you're going
[2:10:54] to be considered Oddball you're going to
[2:10:57] be considered hateful you're going to be
[2:10:59] considered
[2:11:00] narrow-minded and yet all the time
[2:11:02] you're loving them you're loving
[2:11:04] people but see it's because Something's
[2:11:07] Happened it's not because you're SE
[2:11:09] segregating it's not something that
[2:11:11] you're just well I hate you I don't like
[2:11:13] you and you're being snobby you've V in
[2:11:15] a
[2:11:16] book it's it's it's something
[2:11:19] everybody's against you everybody
[2:11:20] telling oh you're a Holy Roller you're
[2:11:22] this that or the other see you're off
[2:11:25] your head see so it's hard to digest it
[2:11:29] but when you're testifying of his glory
[2:11:32] it's sweet in your lips when you stand
[2:11:34] up in a meeting and you say glory to God
[2:11:37] hallelujah oh see when you're going
[2:11:40] through that great Siege it's hard but
[2:11:42] then when you're out of that great Siege
[2:11:44] you can testify of it then it's sweet in
[2:11:47] the lips can you
[2:11:48] amen amen then the next thing after he
[2:11:51] ate the book The Voice told him in
[2:11:53] Revelations 10:11 thou must prophesy
[2:11:56] again before many peoples Nations
[2:11:59] tongues and Kings why now he's being
[2:12:03] commissioned because the word is in him
[2:12:07] amen the word is in him it's in his
[2:12:10] mouth it's in his soul it's in his being
[2:12:13] so what's he going to say what what now
[2:12:15] what is John going to say is he going to
[2:12:17] continue on with the Babbling and the
[2:12:19] confusion of the other ages is is is he
[2:12:23] now going to come and and start
[2:12:24] operating gifts and his ministry the way
[2:12:27] it's always being operated under the
[2:12:29] Pentecostal age is it going to just just
[2:12:32] well it doesn't matter glory to God I'm
[2:12:34] you know praise God you know and then he
[2:12:37] just sits there and causes a bunch of
[2:12:38] confusion what's he going to do with
[2:12:40] this amen you're going to prophesy every
[2:12:42] one of you got something to do you eat
[2:12:45] this book you're going to do something
[2:12:47] now what are you going to do do with
[2:12:50] it
[2:12:52] true I don't think so I don't think John
[2:12:54] was going to sit there and his prophecy
[2:12:56] going to be a mass
[2:12:58] confusion his prophecy going to be of
[2:13:00] Doubt to where when he's done and and
[2:13:03] and as I've told you before it's not the
[2:13:05] gift of prophesying that he's doing it's
[2:13:07] speaking the word yes it's his ministry
[2:13:10] it's it's for all of us every one of us
[2:13:12] going to have to prophesy we got some
[2:13:13] prophesying to do as the body of Christ
[2:13:16] when you eat this book
[2:13:19] you've got some prophesying to do
[2:13:22] True Praise the Lord so here we are he
[2:13:26] represents the
[2:13:27] bride and here's this last day John
[2:13:30] writes Revelations 22 And1 17 and the
[2:13:35] spirit and the bride say come amen come
[2:13:41] right notice what the prophet says now
[2:13:43] listen to the authenticated prophet of
[2:13:45] God who appears in this last age what he
[2:13:48] says from God the bride will say the
[2:13:51] spirit and the prophet and the bride
[2:13:54] will be saying the same
[2:13:58] thing and what they will say will have
[2:14:02] already been said in the word do you
[2:14:06] love him amen she is the final voice yes
[2:14:09] sir to this final
[2:14:12] age if the musicians will come that's
[2:14:15] good and John wasn't told to follow
[2:14:17] after gifted
[2:14:20] people he wasn't told to go after
[2:14:25] prophesied Visions all the time and
[2:14:28] dreams he wasn't told to go after people
[2:14:31] that dance and shout all the
[2:14:33] time or that is so Pious and you
[2:14:39] know he was told to go to the one that
[2:14:42] had the
[2:14:43] book amen can you say amen amen go go to
[2:14:48] that quickening
[2:14:50] power go to the quickening power let it
[2:14:53] Quicken brother brother Brown said the
[2:14:55] word was quickened to John it was
[2:14:58] quickened go to the Dynamics can you say
[2:15:01] Amen yes gifts will be impersonated
[2:15:04] fruits of the spirit will even be
[2:15:06] impersonated sure brother Bram even
[2:15:08] talked about that how that that the the
[2:15:11] the the priest in jesus' day showed more
[2:15:15] fruits of the spirit than Jesus did when
[2:15:17] he went in there and let his R righteous
[2:15:20] IND
[2:15:21] thetion people call it losing his
[2:15:24] temper but he got that Whip and he beat
[2:15:27] them guys out of that that
[2:15:31] church he said that day the priest
[2:15:34] showed more fruits of the spirit than
[2:15:36] even he
[2:15:39] did but
[2:15:41] notice he said remember Satan will try
[2:15:44] to impersonate he will try to
[2:15:47] impersonate everything that the church
[2:15:48] will do he's tried to do it we've
[2:15:51] noticed it through the Antichrist but
[2:15:53] this is one thing he cannot impersonate
[2:15:57] there will be no mimics to this cuz he
[2:16:00] don't know it there's no way for him to
[2:16:03] know it it's the third
[2:16:07] pull he just knows nothing about it he
[2:16:10] doesn't understand it and remember what
[2:16:13] the Bible says in this day there will be
[2:16:16] a famine
[2:16:18] [Music]
[2:16:20] not for water or for bread but for
[2:16:23] hearing the word of
[2:16:25] God they don't know what it
[2:16:31] is I hope it's all right to you brother
[2:16:35] brandham said see he
[2:16:39] said Paul said that the word came in
[2:16:42] power as well as voice the word preached
[2:16:45] actually demonstrated itself like a a
[2:16:47] flaming cutting sword it went to the
[2:16:50] consciences of men like a surgeon's
[2:16:53] knife it cut out the diseases and set
[2:16:56] captives free everywhere those early
[2:16:58] Believers went they went preaching the
[2:17:00] gospel see word and God confirmed that
[2:17:02] word with signs following the sick were
[2:17:04] healed the Devils were cast and they
[2:17:06] spoke in new tongues that was the word
[2:17:08] in action see that word has never failed
[2:17:11] in the mouths of believing Christians
