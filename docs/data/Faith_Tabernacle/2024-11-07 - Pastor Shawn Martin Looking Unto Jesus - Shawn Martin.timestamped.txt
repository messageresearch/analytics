[45:27] uh before we uh read let's go in to
[45:31] prayer and invite uh the presence of the
[45:34] Lord and and as Daniel had mentioned uh
[45:38] sister
[45:39] berer um brother Thomas berer uh Pastor
[45:43] there in in uh Kentucky
[45:46] she uh had uh was kind of feeling not
[45:51] feeling good or whatever and went to the
[45:54] doctor and found out she's ate up with
[45:55] cancer and so I know that's got to be
[45:59] devastating news uh to to them but uh
[46:03] they're asking for prayer so we want to
[46:05] continue to pray and I'd implore you to
[46:08] do that and and um uh take this upon
[46:13] your heart CU you know no matter how bad
[46:15] it seems we know that God works in the
[46:19] impossible amen he is our only hope amen
[46:23] and so we'll just pray father
[46:27] truly you are
[46:29] worthy of our praise our worship
[46:33] and so often we're guilty Lord of not
[46:38] giving you what you
[46:40] deserve but Lord I pray that you would
[46:42] help us to become more
[46:44] conscience of your presence and when we
[46:48] become conscience of your
[46:50] presence we know that we're in the
[46:54] presence of someone greater than a
[46:56] president
[46:57] president or a king or whatever it would
[47:01] be Lord for you are the supreme god you
[47:06] rule and Reign Over
[47:08] All and father
[47:11] Lord you are our savior you are merciful
[47:16] god and we wouldn't be here today
[47:19] without you and help us Lord to be more
[47:23] sincere than ever before and to walk
[47:25] with you and
[47:27] Lord to desire to please you wholly if
[47:31] there's anything in our lives that's not
[47:33] pleasing to you I pray that you would
[47:34] take it out
[47:36] father Lord I'm asking now that you
[47:39] would just minister to your
[47:42] people uh help me to get myself out of
[47:45] the way and that You' speak through
[47:47] these mortal lips father for Lord you
[47:50] alone know the needs and know how to
[47:53] meet them and I pray that you would do
[47:55] so tonight in Jesus Christ's name we
[47:59] pray
[48:01] amen we'll turn uh the the Book of
[48:05] Genesis um very familiar scripture um
[48:09] here but we'll start at the first verse
[48:12] and it came to pass after these things
[48:15] that God did him to
[48:17] Abraham and said unto him
[48:20] Abraham and he said behold here am
[48:24] I he said to take now thy son thine only
[48:28] son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee
[48:32] into the land of
[48:34] Moriah and offer him there for a burnt
[48:38] offering upon one of the mountains which
[48:41] I will tell thee
[48:43] of and Abraham rose up early in the
[48:46] morning and saddled his ass and took uh
[48:50] two of his young men with him and Isaac
[48:54] his son and clave the wood for the burnt
[48:57] offering and Rose up and went unto the
[49:01] place which God had told
[49:03] him then on the third day Abraham lifted
[49:06] up his eyes and saw the place a far off
[49:09] and Abraham said unto his young men
[49:12] abide ye here with the ass and I and the
[49:16] lad will go Yonder and worship and come
[49:20] again to you now that's a statement of
[49:23] faith ain't it and Abraham took the wood
[49:27] of the burnt offering and laid it upon
[49:30] Isaac his son and he took the fire in
[49:33] his
[49:34] hand and a knife and they went both of
[49:38] them
[49:39] together and Isaac spake unto Abraham
[49:42] his father and said father or my father
[49:46] and he said here am I my son and he said
[49:50] behold the fire and the wood but where
[49:52] is the Lamb for the burnt
[49:55] offering and Abraham said my son God
[49:58] will provide himself a lamb for a burnt
[50:02] offering so they went both of them
[50:06] together and they came to the place
[50:08] which God had told him of and Abraham
[50:11] built an altar there and laid the wood
[50:14] in order and bound Isaac his son and
[50:17] laid him on the altar upon the wood and
[50:20] Abraham stretched forth his hand and
[50:22] took the knife to slay his son and the
[50:25] angel of the Lord called unto him out of
[50:28] heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he
[50:31] said here am I and he said late not
[50:34] thine hand upon the lad neither do thou
[50:38] uh anything unto him for now I know that
[50:41] thou fearest God seeing that thou Hast
[50:43] not withheld thy son thine only son from
[50:48] me and Abraham lifted up his eyes and
[50:52] looked and
[50:53] behold uh behind him a ram caught in in
[50:56] a Thicket by his horns and Abraham went
[50:59] and took the RAM and offered him up for
[51:03] a burnt offering in the stad of his son
[51:06] and Abraham called the name of that
[51:08] place Jehovah Gyra as it is said to this
[51:12] day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be
[51:17] seen then if you'll turn to the book of
[51:20] Hebrews the 12th
[51:25] chapter and just go to read part of the
[51:28] second verse the the first part of
[51:31] it Hebrews chap
[51:35] 12 and uh
[51:40] two but it says looking un
[51:43] Jesus the author and finisher of our
[51:47] faith amen you can be seated this
[51:51] evening
[51:57] if I have a title to use I guess I would
[52:00] use looking unto Jesus I I was actually
[52:04] going to speak on something totally
[52:06] different tonight and on the way to
[52:09] church just felt to go this direction so
[52:14] I hope uh something will be said to help
[52:18] you and uh but we're very familiar with
[52:23] Abraham's life and and the story we're
[52:26] familiar with the
[52:28] story um and and I guess a lot of us or
[52:32] most of us
[52:34] could could uh say that we're familiar
[52:38] with his life in in a personal way uh in
[52:43] in some way or
[52:45] another because Abraham's life is a type
[52:48] of our life he it uh very similar his
[52:52] journey very similar to
[52:54] ours um and and um he was a type of of
[53:01] us the elect of God the Chosen and of
[53:05] course we we the first time we hear of
[53:09] uh Abraham his name was Abram and he's
[53:12] an idolator he's in the land of ER I
[53:16] believe um um a part of the Babylonian
[53:21] Kingdom uh the prophet would tell us and
[53:24] so he knows nothing about about God who
[53:28] God is he's a heathen his family's
[53:30] Heathen uh doing all the Heathen ways
[53:34] but then God appeared to him and it must
[53:38] have been some real reality to Abraham
[53:42] for Abraham to uh it caught his
[53:47] attention but it Arrested his heart it
[53:51] it God was able to
[53:53] Captivate um Abraham's heart he didn't
[53:57] need to study it out he didn't need to
[53:59] go find all the books to learn about
[54:01] this God who is speaking to him it it
[54:05] was a supernatural
[54:08] connection and and of course we know
[54:11] what that would be and that is the
[54:13] predestinated seat of God that was
[54:15] laying there Abraham was predestinated
[54:18] and God knew Abraham before the
[54:20] foundation of the world and so God had a
[54:24] purpose for Abraham and and and and this
[54:27] plan just as he has a purpose for us and
[54:31] so God wouldn't have wasted his time
[54:33] calling Abraham or even introducing
[54:37] himself to Abraham in in a personal way
[54:41] if if he knew that Abraham wasn't going
[54:43] to respond but Abraham uh responded and
[54:48] but God not only just introduced himself
[54:50] to Abraham but he told
[54:52] Abraham uh get get thee out of Thy Thy
[54:55] country get get away from your Kindred
[54:59] get away from all these idols and just
[55:02] just get away from everything I've got a
[55:04] land for you and Abraham without
[55:08] questioning and I think that is the
[55:10] Marvel of it Abraham without questioning
[55:13] God asking proof of God just followed
[55:19] now we we know that he took his dad with
[55:21] him and he took lot and and these things
[55:24] but the and and and Abraham that that
[55:28] was to be a separation that would come
[55:30] but uh regardless Abraham did leave that
[55:34] land and he began to search for a land
[55:38] he he he uh uh started out on a journey
[55:43] that would change his life and and that
[55:47] is all of us
[55:49] here we're not just here as church
[55:53] members uh if if it was just about
[55:56] joining a church we could join any
[55:58] church it's not just about us believing
[56:02] in something different than maybe what
[56:05] other religions believe in and all of
[56:09] these things that's not that's not it we
[56:12] we can there's other people that believe
[56:14] in a prophet and there's other people
[56:16] that that different religions that
[56:19] believe in Malachi for is to come of
[56:22] course we believe that brother brandham
[56:25] uh uh fit that description and fulfilled
[56:27] that scripture but but there's other
[56:30] people that that that have ideas and and
[56:33] things like that so why are we different
[56:37] well it's it's the same thing that made
[56:39] Abraham different is that God came to us
[56:42] in a personal way I I I would trust that
[56:47] that's happened to all of us here this
[56:49] evening not only to uh you older ones
[56:53] but to you young people whether you were
[56:56] raised in the message or
[56:59] not it's it's got to come to you and God
[57:03] to where that God some at some point
[57:07] reveals himself to you in a personal way
[57:11] you can know all about brother brandom
[57:13] you can know all about the quotes and
[57:15] and be taught in the message and that's
[57:17] good and and you're you're better off to
[57:20] be be that way but it it takes God to
[57:24] give you that personal relationship
[57:27] and I I think that's that's what we we
[57:29] need is a personal relationship with God
[57:33] I I think so often that people just
[57:36] forget about that they learn about God
[57:38] through head knowledge but they lack
[57:40] that personal
[57:42] relationship and and it's not the head
[57:45] knowledge that's going to to keep you
[57:47] through the times of trouble it's the
[57:50] personal relationship that you have with
[57:53] God and and so we we understand that
[57:56] this is what Abraham had was he started
[58:00] out with that his walk was actually a
[58:03] personal relationship it was a walk with
[58:06] Christ it was a walk that he would begin
[58:09] to learn about this God that had come to
[58:13] him and and the whole life of of Abraham
[58:17] is God showing Abraham to Abraham
[58:21] revealing himself to Abraham and I and
[58:25] and and church if if if we go through
[58:29] life no matter how old we are in God as
[58:33] far as when we say old Christian I'm
[58:36] I've been a Christian you know we say
[58:38] well I've been a Christian for 50 years
[58:40] or I've been a Christian for 10 years or
[58:42] whatever if if if in your journey that
[58:46] God is not revealing himself to you more
[58:50] and more in a personal way something's
[58:53] wrong with that relationship something's
[58:55] wrong with that that that profession
[58:58] because this is what God done to Abraham
[59:01] he he he he he started Abraham out on a
[59:05] journey for the sole purpose leave all
[59:07] of them Gods behind Abraham you you know
[59:11] all about them you and and no doubt he
[59:14] did maybe there was go rain gods and and
[59:17] and certain types of Gods uh a god of
[59:20] fertility a God of this and a god of
[59:22] that and and he knew all about these
[59:24] gods of course none of them would answer
[59:27] but but but he was trained in them
[59:29] things it it it it was an idol worship
[59:33] it was an i a place of idolatry and and
[59:37] none of them uh none of his his priest
[59:40] or whatever uh could tell him about this
[59:42] this this God here uh uh that uh this
[59:46] unknown God if you want to call it that
[59:48] way but but God had come to Abraham so
[59:51] so that he could reveal himself uh uh uh
[59:55] to to Abraham in a personal way get him
[59:59] away from all these other gods get him
[1:00:01] away from all this other worship get him
[1:00:03] away from all this uh uh uh this
[1:00:07] teaching that would draw him to other
[1:00:09] things to where Abraham was totally
[1:00:13] dependent upon God himself and it would
[1:00:17] be through this relationship that that
[1:00:20] Abraham would know the one true God he
[1:00:24] would know that that this God was was a
[1:00:28] God that would answer this this is the
[1:00:31] god that would keep his promises this is
[1:00:33] a God that would never leave him or
[1:00:36] never fail him this was a God that that
[1:00:40] that could could could do the impossible
[1:00:43] can you say Amen but well before Abraham
[1:00:47] could understand that God could do the
[1:00:50] impossible God had to do
[1:00:53] something that that that would be
[1:00:56] impossible so he you know through
[1:01:00] through the life of of Abraham we know
[1:01:03] that God uh uh promised that that uh uh
[1:01:07] Abraham would be a father of
[1:01:10] Nations and Abraham never had a child
[1:01:14] and he said that it would be through
[1:01:15] Sarah that he would have a son and and
[1:01:19] and and in this son he would be blessed
[1:01:21] and and and and you know the story and
[1:01:25] and and what what what is is is amazing
[1:01:29] is is is God would promise Abraham
[1:01:32] something that Abraham could not do in
[1:01:36] himself sarak could not do in herself
[1:01:40] ain't that right so so see uh uh and and
[1:01:44] and that's the way uh uh uh uh God does
[1:01:48] us he's called us out of the World
[1:01:51] Church we we we know through the life of
[1:01:54] Abraham that God does not want us
[1:01:57] looking at all of the things that we're
[1:01:59] used to and and these other gods and
[1:02:02] making Idols out of
[1:02:04] things uh the world's made so many
[1:02:08] Idols out of things amen for their
[1:02:12] comfort for for their supplier of needs
[1:02:15] and we know that none of these gods have
[1:02:18] been able to help the world's in a worse
[1:02:21] condition than ever before do you
[1:02:24] believe that and and so whether it's a a
[1:02:28] a politician or whether it's in the
[1:02:30] medical field or whether it's in the
[1:02:32] sports or whether it's in whatever we
[1:02:34] can make Gods out of
[1:02:36] anything we we can make God out of our
[1:02:39] house and we can make God out of our
[1:02:41] cars and we can make a God out of
[1:02:44] ourselves or you you know uh brother
[1:02:46] Bram even talks about women being being
[1:02:49] uh uh uh worshiped in this age and and
[1:02:53] there but there's so many well the
[1:02:54] prophet said there's so many Vo voes in
[1:02:56] this age that is drowning out the voice
[1:02:58] of God I want everyone to listen to me
[1:03:04] and so we we find that that through
[1:03:07] through all of these things uh uh God
[1:03:11] has called us to come out of the world
[1:03:14] he's called us Church to be separated
[1:03:17] how many believes that to be separated
[1:03:20] see see so so that that we Abraham God
[1:03:24] didn't want Abraham going back there
[1:03:26] there's no place where where God calls
[1:03:29] somebody to come out that he allows them
[1:03:32] to go back he did not want Israel when
[1:03:35] he called them out of Egypt to turn back
[1:03:37] even though Egypt now listen Egypt amen
[1:03:41] or or Israel because they they God
[1:03:44] brought them out of Egypt but he
[1:03:46] couldn't get out Egypt out of them when
[1:03:49] the hard times come they always look
[1:03:51] back oh we had it better there we had it
[1:03:53] better there we had it better and and
[1:03:56] they forgot about the slavery they
[1:03:58] forgot about they were in a helpless
[1:04:00] condition they forgot amen that God
[1:04:02] could actually help them so they go back
[1:04:06] well that was with s lot and his wife
[1:04:09] and and all that God told them don't you
[1:04:10] look back come out but don't you look
[1:04:12] back and and we find out that that that
[1:04:15] a uh Lot's wife looked back see amen so
[1:04:18] so God God didn't God called Abraham
[1:04:23] out not to ever return back back again
[1:04:26] not to go back to that thing and God has
[1:04:29] called us out for the same
[1:04:31] reason do you believe
[1:04:33] that so we we find that that we have
[1:04:37] been C out of the world to walk with God
[1:04:40] and and he he too has given us promises
[1:04:44] that it is totally absolutely
[1:04:48] impossible for us to fulfill on
[1:04:50] ourselves it is totally impossible amen
[1:04:54] for the church to fulfill it it's it's
[1:04:57] totally impossible for any any
[1:05:00] politician government uh uh uh doctor or
[1:05:04] whatever to fulfill God gives us
[1:05:06] promises that that that uh uh we we have
[1:05:10] to stand upon his word and and just
[1:05:14] simply believe
[1:05:17] God the problem is is we tried to make
[1:05:19] things happen we tried to bring things
[1:05:22] uh uh to pass and this is exactly what
[1:05:25] Sarah did she didn't have that Faith
[1:05:28] like like Abraham did as as we all know
[1:05:31] she got discouraged amen with it and and
[1:05:35] she was in her time of of trial and and
[1:05:39] she uh uh convinced Abraham to to take
[1:05:43] Hagar for for a a uh uh wife or a maid
[1:05:48] or or whatever and a concubine and and
[1:05:51] have have a child and and of course we
[1:05:54] know he had a child ain't that right
[1:05:56] they they he uh uh Hagar had a child
[1:06:00] ishmail and and but ishma was not part
[1:06:03] of the promise amen Israel was not part
[1:06:07] of God's promise it never changed God's
[1:06:10] mind and and ishmail has been a a thorn
[1:06:15] in in the side of of the promised seed
[1:06:18] for all these years ain't that right see
[1:06:22] it's it's still been in and and and I'll
[1:06:24] be honest with you our doubt sometimes
[1:06:27] can cause things to come up in our life
[1:06:29] that becomes a problem to
[1:06:33] us ain't that right it it becomes a
[1:06:37] problem to us it becomes a hindrance to
[1:06:40] us it becomes a sticker or Thorn in our
[1:06:45] flesh see and and and so but but we find
[1:06:49] that that even though uh uh uh uh uh uh
[1:06:54] Sarah tried had uh uh to to make this
[1:06:58] thing happen amen uh uh through Hagar it
[1:07:02] never changed God's mind
[1:07:05] whatsoever and that never did see and
[1:07:08] and so then then we find that it takes
[1:07:12] patience everybody say it takes patience
[1:07:14] it takes patience to walk with God Amen
[1:07:18] a lot of times we want things in a hurry
[1:07:20] sometimes we don't understand God's ways
[1:07:23] of of doing things we we don't
[1:07:26] understand why God allows things to
[1:07:28] happen in our lives we wonder why he
[1:07:30] terries uh uh uh in in delivering the
[1:07:34] promise in fulfilling the promise but
[1:07:37] sometimes we have to wait and be patient
[1:07:41] upon God that's the part of Walking with
[1:07:45] God can you say Amen if you're going to
[1:07:48] walk with God if you you say well I'm a
[1:07:51] Christian I'm I'm going to serve God
[1:07:53] then then you're going to have to serve
[1:07:55] him with
[1:07:55] patience you're going to have to serve
[1:07:58] him waiting sometimes upon the promise
[1:08:02] amen ain't that right why because God
[1:08:05] moves in his own time God's not man he
[1:08:09] doesn't work like man God God works in
[1:08:12] his own way God's ways are higher than
[1:08:15] our ways his thoughts are higher than
[1:08:17] our thoughts amen and and so he moves in
[1:08:20] his own time he fulfills his word not
[1:08:22] when we want him to do it but he does it
[1:08:25] in his own time and it's in these times
[1:08:28] that we must not get discouraged while
[1:08:30] we're waiting upon the promise we can't
[1:08:34] get discouraged we can't just just Cast
[1:08:36] Away our
[1:08:37] confidence can you say amen he moves in
[1:08:41] his own time now Romans 8 and 24 I I
[1:08:44] didn't even give y all these scriptures
[1:08:45] so uh for we are saved by hope but hope
[1:08:50] that is seen is not hope so we're not
[1:08:53] saved by things that we see
[1:08:56] amen but but uh uh for what a man seeth
[1:09:00] then why does he yet hope for it would
[1:09:03] be easy to to have everything at our our
[1:09:06] our fingertips it would be easy to
[1:09:09] understand everything of why we're going
[1:09:12] through things and and we wouldn't have
[1:09:14] to wait for it and and it just
[1:09:16] everything just coming but if if that
[1:09:18] did then You' never have to wait for it
[1:09:21] you'd never have to hope for it it would
[1:09:23] be there ain't that right but he says
[1:09:26] but if we hope for that we see not then
[1:09:30] do we with patience wait for it can you
[1:09:33] say Amen how many's hoping in things
[1:09:36] that you cannot see amen well you have
[1:09:39] to if you're going to walk with God
[1:09:41] you're going to have to wait for things
[1:09:43] that you cannot see because the promises
[1:09:46] are uh uh are beyond your ability the
[1:09:49] promises are Beyond amen your
[1:09:52] understanding so many times Amen to
[1:09:54] where you just have to wait for it God
[1:09:58] says he going to deliver you well you
[1:10:00] you say well I've been having issues and
[1:10:02] I just don't know and I just don't know
[1:10:04] you've got to wait for it what about
[1:10:07] healing well there's times that well God
[1:10:09] does heal amen sometimes instantly but a
[1:10:12] lot of times he doesn't do it that way
[1:10:14] and you have to sit there and wait for
[1:10:17] it but you can't give
[1:10:20] up but see in in all of this God is
[1:10:24] trying to show us that he's God he's not
[1:10:27] a God that just a fix and quick fix
[1:10:30] quick quick fix you know that that's not
[1:10:33] what God is amen it's not that God wants
[1:10:36] to answer our every wh God wants us to
[1:10:40] have a relationship with him to where we
[1:10:43] can understand that it doesn't matter
[1:10:46] how difficult it is he's still God it
[1:10:49] doesn't matter how how long it takes
[1:10:51] he's still God it doesn't matter if
[1:10:54] corruption takes it over and is sitting
[1:10:57] there spoonful of dust he's still
[1:11:00] God he's still God that's right that's
[1:11:06] good if God gave us everything we wanted
[1:11:09] on a whim you'd never know God for what
[1:11:12] he
[1:11:13] is you'd never understand
[1:11:17] that how many times have you've gone
[1:11:20] through things that you think you just
[1:11:22] bubbled you know I I remember
[1:11:25] when I was I don't know how old I was
[1:11:27] but I couldn't
[1:11:29] swim and me and Dad went down a a big
[1:11:32] water
[1:11:34] slide and of course I always been short
[1:11:37] and it was
[1:11:38] deep and I didn't have a life
[1:11:41] jacket and Dad just was walking off and
[1:11:45] I'm sitting there bubble up and down you
[1:11:48] know and I'd go under
[1:11:50] Ando you know and actually it happened
[1:11:53] at the lake one time everybody mom and
[1:11:56] them was on the shore and I got out too
[1:11:58] far and I was going up and down but I
[1:12:02] thought this is my last time I was I was
[1:12:04] trying to scream I couldn't scream I
[1:12:06] getting water down in my you know and it
[1:12:08] was just the grace of God that dad
[1:12:10] turned around and looked and saw me for
[1:12:12] going down the last time you know but
[1:12:14] sometimes in life that's the way we
[1:12:17] feel and and you know it's amazing that
[1:12:21] God isn't like our parents that or or us
[1:12:24] that we would forget or or maybe we got
[1:12:27] busy talking and we we forget where our
[1:12:30] child was amen and and uh God's not that
[1:12:34] way he he's he's been there all this
[1:12:37] time he's
[1:12:39] watching you understand what I'm saying
[1:12:41] he knows what you're saying he knows
[1:12:43] your tears that you're crying he he
[1:12:46] knows the agony he knows the the your
[1:12:49] your your heart is tore up he he knows
[1:12:52] the depths of your heart and you're
[1:12:54] crying out for him and it seems like
[1:12:57] he's not helping it seems like he's just
[1:12:59] sitting there but what he's trying to
[1:13:01] get us to do is to rely on him and
[1:13:05] understand that he's
[1:13:12] God and and so we have to be
[1:13:15] patient we have to be patient and
[1:13:18] waiting upon God as we walk with him now
[1:13:22] Hebrews 10:35
[1:13:25] it says cast not away therefore your
[1:13:27] confidence cast not away your
[1:13:30] confidence when did you get that
[1:13:32] confidence when God saved
[1:13:34] you I believe that's when Abraham's
[1:13:37] confidence was is when God saved him it
[1:13:41] it's not
[1:13:43] that again it's not that you you go
[1:13:46] through the schooling before you decide
[1:13:49] say well I think he'll he'll make a he
[1:13:51] he's the best candidate for me I can put
[1:13:54] my TR trust in him no it's not that it's
[1:13:58] not that God has to campaign it's not
[1:14:01] that God has to sway you in one way or
[1:14:03] the other I I just believe that there's
[1:14:05] a predestinated seed there's a g Gene
[1:14:08] seed of God that when he passes over us
[1:14:13] and there's just something that
[1:14:16] responds I I don't know if that's the
[1:14:18] way it was with you but that's the way
[1:14:19] it was with me I didn't even know him
[1:14:23] but all I knew is I fell in love with
[1:14:26] him amen I I I didn't even know just how
[1:14:29] capable he was brother Bill I but but I
[1:14:33] knew that that I I just I I wanted to
[1:14:37] follow
[1:14:38] him we sing that song I Feel the
[1:14:41] pool well that's what it was when we
[1:14:43] come to him that's why brother Bram was
[1:14:45] against altar calls in in in the way
[1:14:47] that they used to do it you know that
[1:14:49] persuade them and they would say well
[1:14:51] you're you know your mama have been
[1:14:52] praying for you and you know and all all
[1:14:55] these things it once you come on up you
[1:14:57] know I've seen that so many times you
[1:14:59] know and then then they'd call them up
[1:15:01] and but it wasn't nothing see but but
[1:15:03] when we came to God God swept over us
[1:15:06] and he began to introduce himself to
[1:15:10] us and and we came to him willfully
[1:15:14] ain't that
[1:15:15] right and I I think that's when the
[1:15:18] confidence
[1:15:19] came but it doesn't stop us from the
[1:15:22] troubles and the trials and the
[1:15:25] agonies and and all of these things that
[1:15:28] we go
[1:15:29] through I think people do them and
[1:15:32] themselves an
[1:15:34] injustice when they don't build a
[1:15:36] relationship with
[1:15:39] God because the trials are going to come
[1:15:43] amen issues are going to come you cannot
[1:15:47] stop
[1:15:50] that I may go tomorrow and my children
[1:15:53] my wife will be left here alone and if
[1:15:57] they have not built their confidence in
[1:16:00] God if something has as arrested them
[1:16:04] despair is going to fall you understand
[1:16:07] what I'm saying it's easy to blame God
[1:16:09] it's easy to all of these things when
[1:16:11] you don't know him when you haven't
[1:16:13] built have that personal relationship
[1:16:15] with God it's easy to fall apart when we
[1:16:20] ain't got a a relationship with him I
[1:16:23] hope this makes sense to you amen see it
[1:16:26] it it it's got to come to a
[1:16:29] relationship so so Abraham began to walk
[1:16:32] with God not in knowledge not some
[1:16:35] preacher just constantly telling him
[1:16:37] about God and and what he should do and
[1:16:39] what he shouldn't do and all this this
[1:16:41] was God leading
[1:16:44] him and you can always tell a difference
[1:16:46] when someone's really got the Lord has
[1:16:48] really personally come to them in a
[1:16:50] special way and someone is just doing it
[1:16:53] through the motions and and the PR just
[1:16:55] constantly have to correct and someone's
[1:16:57] constantly having to remind them now you
[1:16:59] need to do this and you need to do that
[1:17:00] and you need to do this you know and and
[1:17:02] and but there's something there that
[1:17:05] brings them a conviction when you have a
[1:17:08] real walk with God there there's that
[1:17:10] just that personal thing keep coming
[1:17:12] follow me follow me come on I've got a
[1:17:15] place for you can you say man have you
[1:17:17] ever had that before I know you have
[1:17:20] there's just something there you start
[1:17:22] to settle down you you know maybe some
[1:17:25] enticements of the world and and and but
[1:17:27] there's something out in your heart said
[1:17:29] there's more there's more what is it
[1:17:31] that's God calling you personally come
[1:17:35] to
[1:17:38] me now you can't Cast Away your
[1:17:41] confidence a Christian walk has got a
[1:17:44] person to walk with God's got to have
[1:17:46] confidence in God
[1:17:50] true so cast not away therefore your
[1:17:53] confidence which hath great recompense
[1:17:55] of reward for you have need of patience
[1:17:58] that after you have done the will of God
[1:18:01] you might receive the promise you have
[1:18:03] need of patience that after you've done
[1:18:06] the will of God you've done everything
[1:18:08] that is required of you just like job
[1:18:11] did ain't that right he he he had
[1:18:13] offered the sacrifice what God had
[1:18:16] commanded what God had required he
[1:18:18] offered that atonement not only for
[1:18:20] himself but for his
[1:18:22] family right right and there was he went
[1:18:26] into the biggest trial of his life but
[1:18:28] he stood there with the
[1:18:31] patience never casting his away his
[1:18:34] confidence that's right Lord so he says
[1:18:38] for yet a little while he that will
[1:18:41] come uh for he that shall come will come
[1:18:44] and will not t now the just shall live
[1:18:48] by faith what are we to live by
[1:18:53] faith and if any man draw back my soul
[1:18:56] shall have no pleasure in him amen but
[1:19:00] we are not of them that draw back under
[1:19:03] predition but of them that believe to
[1:19:06] the saving of the
[1:19:07] Soul we live by faith can you say Amen
[1:19:11] faith in what faith in God's promised
[1:19:14] word yes sir amen God's word is the only
[1:19:17] thing that will never fail ain't that
[1:19:20] right so here in Romans 5:1 therefore
[1:19:24] being justified by faith we have peace
[1:19:27] with God through our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:19:30] by whom also we have access by faith say
[1:19:33] that again being justified by faith
[1:19:37] justified by faith amen you've got to
[1:19:40] have that faith and you're believing on
[1:19:43] him ain't that right we have peace with
[1:19:45] God through our Lord Jesus Christ by
[1:19:47] whom also we have access by faith into
[1:19:50] this grace wherein we stand and rejoice
[1:19:53] in Hope of theor glory of God not and
[1:19:56] not only so but we Glory everybody say
[1:19:59] we Glory we glory in tribulations also
[1:20:04] amen we are people that glory in
[1:20:08] Tribulation why because we we we're
[1:20:11] walking with him we've not Cast Away our
[1:20:15] confidence we know that he's going to
[1:20:17] take care of us we know that he's going
[1:20:20] to provide for us we know that he's
[1:20:23] going to answer and fulfill his word to
[1:20:26] us can you say Amen am see we we're
[1:20:29] we're we're not looking at all we've
[1:20:31] left the idols behind and now we're
[1:20:35] walking with God and we're looking only
[1:20:38] unto him who is our help
[1:20:42] amen glory and tribulations also knowing
[1:20:46] that tribulation worketh patience and
[1:20:50] patience
[1:20:52] experience Lord yes sir
[1:20:55] can I ask you have you
[1:20:57] waited long enough to have experience
[1:21:00] with God the
[1:21:04] lord it's in the tribulations that it's
[1:21:06] so easy to deny God it's so easy just to
[1:21:09] sit down and
[1:21:11] quit it's so easy just to give
[1:21:14] up it's so easy to start looking around
[1:21:17] at other
[1:21:19] things but when you with patience you're
[1:21:22] waiting and and and and and you're in
[1:21:25] that tribulation the tribulation Now is
[1:21:27] working patience and patience
[1:21:31] experience and experience
[1:21:36] hope why why would god promise something
[1:21:40] that we cannot do on our own I you know
[1:21:43] I was listening to the the message today
[1:21:46] I
[1:21:47] know and brother brandham he says now
[1:21:52] why do these wh why do we come to the
[1:21:54] these
[1:21:55] troubles
[1:21:57] why what makes these things
[1:22:00] come why should a Christian ever be
[1:22:05] perplexed and I want to say that to all
[1:22:07] of us why should we be
[1:22:15] perplexed why would not everything just
[1:22:17] run perfect for a
[1:22:19] Christian but it doesn't and we know it
[1:22:23] very true
[1:22:25] and you say
[1:22:26] Amen so God is not someone that just
[1:22:30] gives us full of
[1:22:31] promises just
[1:22:34] uh just to make us feel
[1:22:37] good nope he's there giving us promises
[1:22:43] but he also sends us through
[1:22:47] experiences that we have to wait
[1:22:50] sometimes we have to pray sometimes
[1:22:54] you understand what I'm saying we got to
[1:22:57] confess it sometimes and we don't see it
[1:23:00] we don't know when it's going to happen
[1:23:02] but we know it's going to happen because
[1:23:04] we have confidence in God
[1:23:08] Amen now he says see why doesn't
[1:23:11] everything just run perfect why would
[1:23:13] not everything just run perfect for a
[1:23:14] Christian but it does it and we know it
[1:23:17] sometimes we have more troubles
[1:23:19] everybody say we have more
[1:23:22] troubles sometimes we have more more
[1:23:24] troubles than a uh uh when we become a
[1:23:29] Christian than we did when we were
[1:23:32] sinners now think of that that's what a
[1:23:34] prophet is saying and he backs it up he
[1:23:37] says of course it is written many are
[1:23:40] the afflictions of the righteous not
[1:23:44] many are the afflictions of The Sinner
[1:23:46] many are the afflictions of the
[1:23:48] righteous ain't that right how many go
[1:23:51] through your afflictions we all go
[1:23:53] through our AFF afflictions trust you me
[1:23:55] we go through afflictions and and and
[1:23:58] and yet God deliver him from them all
[1:24:05] you've gone through your afflictions but
[1:24:07] God has delivered you through them all
[1:24:12] is that your testimony God has delivered
[1:24:15] us we could stand like David if it had
[1:24:17] not been for the Lord upon on our on our
[1:24:20] side the waters would have swallowed us
[1:24:23] up if it hadn't not been for the Lord on
[1:24:26] our side the enemy would have come in
[1:24:28] and devoured us if it had not been but
[1:24:32] even though God sends us through these
[1:24:34] things he Deliver us out of them
[1:24:40] all
[1:24:41] that's so he says now notice what he
[1:24:44] says God promised many
[1:24:46] afflictions strange feelings strange
[1:24:50] things that would be beyond our
[1:24:52] understanding but it's always done
[1:24:55] everybody say it's always
[1:24:57] done it's always done for our
[1:25:02] good ain't that right it's always done
[1:25:05] for your good see you're walking with
[1:25:08] God how me ever gone through a trial and
[1:25:11] when you got through the end of the
[1:25:13] trial you've come out of the trial
[1:25:15] you've known God better than what you
[1:25:16] did before you come in into it what is
[1:25:19] it you're walking with
[1:25:23] God come on
[1:25:26] it's always done for our good just can't
[1:25:29] understand it because if we did then it
[1:25:31] would not be Faith to us we would go
[1:25:34] with an understanding in other words
[1:25:36] we'd go through our trials with an
[1:25:38] understanding but sometimes we're going
[1:25:39] through our trials and not understanding
[1:25:41] why we're going through our trials but
[1:25:43] there's something in us that has a
[1:25:45] confidence in God the Lord
[1:25:51] amen see so he says but we do it and we
[1:25:54] have it and we believe by faith his word
[1:25:57] that it's going to work some good thing
[1:25:59] for us if we could just grasp that today
[1:26:03] see if we could grasp that uh all of our
[1:26:07] troubles and and there is none of us
[1:26:10] immune from them and if we could realize
[1:26:13] that those things are for our
[1:26:21] good now God gave that Abraham that
[1:26:24] promise in time didn't matter to
[1:26:27] Abraham the Bible says that he believed
[1:26:29] God and he counted God Faithful that
[1:26:32] promised and we know that God gave
[1:26:36] Abraham the son that he had promised him
[1:26:40] God fulfilled his word 25 years of
[1:26:43] waiting Abraham's body grew weaker amen
[1:26:46] but his faith grew stronger the Bible
[1:26:49] says he was strong in faith can you say
[1:26:51] Amen so it was just the B body that that
[1:26:54] was growing weaker but not the faith
[1:26:57] amen and I I I I think that's that's the
[1:27:00] difference you know if between someone
[1:27:03] that is is serving God by H knowledge
[1:27:06] and and just going through the going
[1:27:08] through the ritual of things and just
[1:27:11] going through religion and someone
[1:27:13] really having a personal walk with God
[1:27:16] that your faith gets stronger and
[1:27:19] stronger and stronger can you say Amen
[1:27:23] come on Church God doesn't keep us from
[1:27:25] our trials so that our faith stays
[1:27:28] strong you can go through the trials and
[1:27:31] your faith still gets stronger because
[1:27:33] you're learning about God you you're
[1:27:35] experiencing God every day should be an
[1:27:38] experience with God every trial should
[1:27:42] be an experience with
[1:27:45] God a personal
[1:27:48] relationship but we know that when that
[1:27:50] child got up Isaac got up to the age of
[1:27:53] 12 or whatever he was just a
[1:27:57] child as we read God told Abraham to
[1:28:00] take that child and offer him
[1:28:03] up and if you notice Abraham didn't
[1:28:06] question God he didn't sit there and say
[1:28:09] God why you see it was a test it was the
[1:28:12] final test for
[1:28:14] Abraham he had learned all that time of
[1:28:17] Walking with God through all of the
[1:28:20] things that he went through yes he had
[1:28:22] failed yes he had done that but in
[1:28:24] through everything God was faithful to
[1:28:26] him God never failed him and and so when
[1:28:30] it come to this final test amen and God
[1:28:34] requiring him to to to offer his son
[1:28:37] Abraham was so
[1:28:39] confident so full of trust God never
[1:28:42] told him that that oh this is just going
[1:28:45] to be I'm just kidding you just go ahead
[1:28:46] and go through the act and you know it
[1:28:49] ain't going to really be no as far as
[1:28:51] Abraham con was concerned he was going
[1:28:53] to offer for that son to God but he knew
[1:28:57] that God could raise him up that's just
[1:29:00] the confidence that Abraham had he
[1:29:03] didn't go to to some he he didn't say
[1:29:05] sir it's about time we go back I'm just
[1:29:07] tired of all this no he his faith was
[1:29:11] strong in
[1:29:14] God so much so that when he got to the
[1:29:17] the bottom of the mountain and they left
[1:29:19] the servants there he says me and the
[1:29:21] lad will return amen me and the lad will
[1:29:24] return I like is that your faith is that
[1:29:27] your confidence we're going to go
[1:29:29] through this thing God's going to
[1:29:33] provide can you say amen and I think
[1:29:37] that's as as
[1:29:40] Abraham as Abraham was and God had
[1:29:43] revealed that part to him so is it God
[1:29:47] revealing to us and I understand that
[1:29:49] God has already provided a sacrifice for
[1:29:51] us but you see in every aspect of Our
[1:29:55] Lives there's an element of of
[1:29:59] Supernatural that is required for these
[1:30:03] promises to come to pass do you believe
[1:30:05] that it's it's it's even it it's even
[1:30:09] not just just simply hearing the message
[1:30:13] preached it's simply not just going
[1:30:15] through the actions of going to church
[1:30:18] and day in and day out and hearing the
[1:30:20] preacher preach there has to be a
[1:30:22] supernatural element
[1:30:24] to this that God provides
[1:30:27] himself he quickens it to us he he's the
[1:30:32] one that gives us the faith he's the one
[1:30:34] that that quickens the word to us and
[1:30:37] and and as as we're walking with him
[1:30:40] trust me there's a change that is taking
[1:30:45] place and and it comes from God
[1:30:48] providing do you believe it amen
[1:30:51] amen if we didn't have the spirit of God
[1:30:54] in our lives whatsoever and we just
[1:30:56] relied upon head
[1:30:58] knowledge we would learn more about God
[1:31:02] more about the message more about the
[1:31:03] Bible and the and these things we could
[1:31:06] even get it to where we could put quotes
[1:31:08] and all these things together and yet it
[1:31:11] would all be a carnal understanding and
[1:31:13] there would be nothing quickened to
[1:31:15] us now
[1:31:17] Church why does God send the message to
[1:31:21] us why does God do these things why has
[1:31:23] has he done
[1:31:24] it to build us
[1:31:27] up church as the prophet said there's
[1:31:31] going to it's going to take more faith
[1:31:32] than ever
[1:31:33] before in this age do you believe that
[1:31:37] amen it's going to take more faith and
[1:31:40] church we we can't look at the natural
[1:31:42] things for our substance yeah I get it
[1:31:46] we got to work we got to do these things
[1:31:48] we got to live it takes money it takes
[1:31:51] these things but when Trouble Comes our
[1:31:53] way way when our back is against the
[1:31:56] wall when when the money ain't coming in
[1:31:58] or maybe laid off of the job or maybe
[1:32:01] the child is sick or maybe we've gotten
[1:32:04] received bad news uh uh uh and and we
[1:32:07] just don't know what to do and and
[1:32:09] naturally we would just cave in we would
[1:32:11] fall
[1:32:13] apart but God by
[1:32:17] Grace he has been working something in
[1:32:20] our lives that's been building a faith
[1:32:23] Within
[1:32:24] us that has caused us to turn from the
[1:32:27] world turn from the idols turn from the
[1:32:30] things that the world looks to for help
[1:32:33] and we're walking with God keeping our
[1:32:35] eyes upon God Amen and God requires
[1:32:38] things from us that we just don't
[1:32:41] understand and and and and and he puts
[1:32:43] things in our lives or he brings us in
[1:32:46] the path that we just don't understand
[1:32:49] but we wait upon
[1:32:51] God I think that's where we've got to
[1:32:54] pray
[1:32:55] church I think people lack prayer in
[1:32:58] their lives so
[1:33:03] much amen can you say
[1:33:06] Amen we go through our day and I'm I'm
[1:33:09] I'm guilty just as much but we can go
[1:33:13] through our day without
[1:33:15] praying but I'm telling you church God
[1:33:18] wants a relationship with us
[1:33:21] amen hello amen amen
[1:33:25] you know God doesn't want us to come 15
[1:33:28] 20 25 years into the gospel and then
[1:33:31] we're still being blowed by our trials
[1:33:34] and we're just Teeter tottering and
[1:33:36] we're just so disappointed and so let
[1:33:39] down and so whiny and so this and so
[1:33:43] that we should be at a
[1:33:46] place that we just have this confidence
[1:33:49] in God he's going to work it out out
[1:33:52] because we could look back and we've
[1:33:54] gone through experiences not just
[1:33:56] experiencing trials but we've
[1:33:58] experienced God in that trial we we have
[1:34:01] actually experienced a a personal
[1:34:05] relationship with God to where we have
[1:34:07] seen God in every trial work things out
[1:34:10] we've seen God meet the need we've seen
[1:34:13] God answer the prayer we've seen God
[1:34:15] heal the sick we've seen God Deliver us
[1:34:19] so many times that our faith should be
[1:34:21] strong in God can you say Amen will
[1:34:25] again amen you love him amen amen if the
[1:34:30] musicians will
[1:34:33] come walk with God looking unto Jesus
[1:34:38] amen not just knowing about his word but
[1:34:41] knowing the author of the word that's
[1:34:43] the point yes
[1:34:46] sir I think it interesting that the man
[1:34:49] that was criticizing brother brandham
[1:34:51] you know he's trying to belittle brother
[1:34:53] brandham yeah you don't know your
[1:34:55] Bible they criticized him for his
[1:35:00] grammar that he doesn't say things right
[1:35:03] doesn't present his message right
[1:35:05] doesn't present things right you just
[1:35:08] don't know the
[1:35:09] Bible but brother Brown says but I know
[1:35:12] the
[1:35:12] author and I promise
[1:35:16] you none of them guys hardly ever
[1:35:22] did yes sir I'm sure they know a little
[1:35:24] bit maybe some but a lot of them
[1:35:27] depended upon their knowledge of this
[1:35:29] Bible But Here Come A man that had an
[1:35:32] understanding of who God was he knew the
[1:35:35] author he kept in relationship and it
[1:35:38] wasn't just a prophet you know you don't
[1:35:40] have to have an angel visit you you
[1:35:43] don't have to have Jesus Christ to stand
[1:35:46] in front of you you don't have to have
[1:35:48] these Supernatural visitations all the
[1:35:51] time just walk with God
[1:35:54] trust God pray seek him can you say amen

[1:36:07] message but remember when you're doing

[1:40:15] the other Idols of this
[1:40:18] world hallelujah hallelujah I I truly
[1:40:22] believe the more that Abraham knew God
[1:40:25] and and understood God all them other
[1:40:30] Idols just faded out of the
[1:40:32] way Hallelujah we should never compare
[1:40:35] God to any other things oh so many
[1:40:40] people are guilty of that when God
[1:40:42] doesn't move they they turn around and
[1:40:44] look into other things for convenience
[1:40:46] and for satisfaction for Joy for help
[1:40:50] for for all kinds of things it just
[1:40:54] shows that the relationship just ain't
[1:40:57] there oh May that relationship come to
[1:41:00] us may we have him and know
[1:41:03] him I tell you what there's no God
[1:41:07] liking there there's no provider like
[1:41:11] him there's no joy that can be given
[1:41:14] like he
[1:41:15] gives there's no peace there's no
[1:41:18] Comfort there's no
[1:41:20] nothing at any any any
[1:41:23] anything that this world has to offer
[1:41:26] they can't give it like God
[1:41:29] hallelujah teach me
[1:41:32] Lord teach me
[1:41:35] Lord
[1:41:37] to sing it now oh they that
[1:41:42] way remember Abraham when he had the
[1:41:46] choice they had to separate from
[1:41:51] lot Abra Abraham actually gave lot first
[1:41:58] choice because he was so in comfort and
[1:42:02] so trusting God to take care of
[1:42:05] [Music]
[1:42:06] him it was Lot he didn't have a walk
[1:42:09] with God he he didn't have that personal
[1:42:12] relationship he began to look at the
[1:42:14] plains of Sodom and Gomorrah everything
[1:42:17] that he felt that that that could Supply
[1:42:19] his needs was there but Abraham he could
[1:42:23] sat out in that tent and Sarah being a
[1:42:25] law to her husband sitting out in that
[1:42:28] old dried desert and all these things
[1:42:31] and nothing really going for him in life
[1:42:34] if you could say it that way but oh he
