========================================

[Music] [Music] thank you foreign [Music] amen aren't you glad he's here to do that amen and we certainly a man wanting him to just pour it out just over and over and over amen and he certainly willing to do that and and I'm so glad that we can be a recipient of that a man the musicians can be dismissed it's good to see everyone now it's the Lord trust you I had a good week and a good day amen been a little warm but uh we're surviving praise the Lord and there's as hot as it is here it's uh other places very hot I still am downstairs you know in Oklahoma looking up the weather there it's in the triple digits 106 108 109 and they they probably got three weeks of this to look forward to and so it's been pretty pretty warm but the Lord is good to us and um if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the Book of Psalms the 23rd chapter and it's good to just to have everyone that was gone over the weekend back in the house of the Lord and we want to just keep those that are sick in our prayer man that Psalms the 23rd chapter and before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to the Lord precious father how we long just to feel your spirit and not just feel it Lord but to have you just to pour yourself into us more and more and more where we can be molded into your image and your likeness father for that's what you have predestinated us to Lord is to be conformed to the image of your dear son and father we know that the spirit makes that word live and it creates something with the in US Lord that the world could never create and oh God we need you more today than we ever have before and I pray father that you would just come move among your people anoint not only me Lord but nor the people father and may we just get ourselves out of the way father may your blood just cover us now Lord and speak to our hearts May Faith be quickened we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen Psalms 23 and 1 says the Lord is my shepherd everybody say that the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want amen you can have your seats this evening of course I I want to continue along that thought the Lord is my shepherd and you know this this passage of scripture has been a comfort uh to many uh throughout the years and it's been used a lot in in funerals and and things like that and uh but I I think that the scripture has this scripture has been misunderstood many times I've been to funerals you know and and some of them as you hear what their lives were or you know what their lives were and and you study you know maybe their life uh that are in the casket and and you ask you know was the was the Lord really their Shepherd you know and and them type of funerals you just don't like to be at you know and uh but you know you you wander you know because this you know it appears today that people have a different idea or concept as to what a Shepherd is than what David understood as Shepherd to be and so David understood what it meant when he said the Lord is my shepherd and so um and and he gives a list of things that he wouldn't have experienced if the Lord wasn't his Shepherd for he says I shall not want. that's that's one of them I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul not they but he he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake and this is the shepherd that's that's leading and restoring and and and and and providing these benefits and so the scripture is more uh than just a comfort it's to be more than just a comfort to those who have lost a loved one these words that David writes there is more than just a cliche that we use but the Lord is a person and we know him to be Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and he has taken on the role of a shepherd to his sheep ain't that right and so the benefits that David speaks of is something that every sheep of God experiences this isn't just an isolated experience that David has with the Lord but this is something that all sheep of God experience the benefits and no man can experience such benefits unless the Lord is his Shepherd only the Sheep of God have fear taken away from them by his presence because he is their Shepherd only his sheep are comforted by his rod and staff and there's no other rod in staff that can Comfort them there's nothing else that can comfort not God sheep but the shepherd's rod and staff they comfort me ain't that right so it shows the relationship that we have with our Lord he is the shepherd and we are his sheep you know sheep as the prophet tells us you know uh sheep they're they're not as wild animals that run all over the place but sheep actually are a an object of property and so um you know Jesus there he says my sheep know my voice my sheep showing that it's a personal possession of his sheep is his personal possession ain't that right and so he lays claim to them as being his own property sheep don't just follow anyone they're going to follow the shepherd ain't that right so as much as the shepherd lays claim to his sheep as being his so does the sheeply claim to the shepherd as being theirs the Lord is my shepherd ain't that right and David saw him not just as a Shepherd to the world leading multitudes but he's my shepherd he made it personal so it's a personal relationship that the Sheep the lamb has with or a Believer has with the Lord ain't that right David didn't have many Shepherds for he said the Lord is my shepherd ain't that right he only had one Shepherd so he was the Lord's property and the Lord was his Shepherd I think you know God's sheep are not running around here following anything that comes along friends come friends go but they're not the shepherd churches come and churches go but they're not the shepherd preachers come and preachers go but they're not the shepherd dad may come and dad make gold but he's not the shepherd children may come and children may go but they're not the shepherd seminaries will come and go but they're not the shepherd can you say Amen not my shepherd amen for the Lord is my shepherd and I I I I think it's the Sheep of God David is showing us that the Sheep of God know who they're following they're not just following blindly they're not just following anything that looks good but down inside there's a knowledge that the Lord is my shepherd and that's the one I will follow ain't that right another thing the shepherd leads his sheep to designated places to care for them and and the shepherd or the Sheep are attached to their to their Shepherd their confidence is in him their trust is in him their dependency is on him they have confidence in his ability to lead they have confidence in his ability to protect them they have this confidence in his ability to feed them they have this confidence in their Shepherd a man to provide for them can you say amen for sheep are totally dependent upon the shepherd now I know we've we've probably going over things that we've talked about but I'm just going to drive that that home and so just as a sheet knows its Shepherd David knew his Shepherd but also the shepherd knows his sheep have you ever just wondered if the Lord knew you or not you're claiming to know the Lord but does the Lord know you and it's a lot of times in the trials that we really wonder does he love me does he know me does he does he have any dealings with me but the shepherd knows his sheep and if it it it's it's I believe brother Branham even tells us that it is the the the duty of that Shepherd to know the sheep that he's leading ain't that right and and so if that is in the natural that it is also in the spiritual brother Brown says the shepherd stays with the Sheep so much until he even laughs like the Sheep bleeding he talks like the Sheep he smells like the Sheep that's right because he's with the Sheep that's all he knows is his sheep God's world if you could say it that way is you that's all he knows is you is sheep I think that's comforting Psalms 139 1 just starting there oh Lord thou have searched me remember this is the shepherd oh Lord the Lord is my shepherd thou has searched me and known me thou knowest my down sitting and mine Uprising thou understand is my thought of far off thou compasses my path and my lying down and art acquainted with all my ways for there is not a word in my tongue but Lo O Lord thou knowest it all together thou Hast beset me behind and before and laid thine hand upon me such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high I cannot attain unto it whether shall I go from thy Spirit or whether I shall flee uh from my presence if I Ascend into heaven Thou Art there if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art there if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the outermost parts of the sea even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me if I say surely the darkness shall cover me even the night shall be light about me yea the darkness hideth not from thee but the night shineth as the day the darkness and the light are both a light to thee for thou has possessed my Reigns thou has covered me in my mother's womb I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and and that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being informed unperfect and in my book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious also are thy thoughts unto me o God how great is the sum of them if if I should count them they are more in number than the sand when I awake I am still with thee he knows the Sheep so we we find that there's no Shepherd that could be more acquainted with the Sheep than the great shepherd with his sheep because his knowledge is an infinite knowledge that when you weren't even in existence he knew you it that when you weren't even thought of in an Earthly thought there was a Heavenly thought about you he knows you can you say Amen see he knows his Sheep by an infinite knowledge and wherever he leads his sheep it is already been prepared can you say Amen he prepared your natural birth he prepared the time that you would be born speaking of this natural he he's prepared everything about your life ain't that right he prepared the town that you would live in to think that God would create a town have a town established for you to live in hello I believe Bethlehem was was established for Christ to be born I believe the whole nature of Bethlehem and the characteristics of Bethlehem what was designed the way it was for Christ to be born in amen he prepared the family that you would belong to he prepared the genetics that you would belong to and that would be in you he prepared the age that you would live in can you say Amen so see the shepherd knows you and he's the one that is leading and guiding your footsteps he's the one that's prepared the new birth you believe that he prepared the time for you to have your new birth he prepared the prophet of Malachi 4 to give you a message he prepared your heart to receive that message everything of your life is him literally leading you up to something can you say amen and the way has already been prepared even though it would seem to be a time of death of Devastation a place of misery a place of whatever but yet God prepared it for you he's the shepherd so you're you're not just stumbling into this thing he's the shepherd can you say man and he's been leading you all alone from place to place in your life from event to event to event in your life from happening to happening and he gets you to the place that he can have total preeminence in your life amen now I've thought of this preparation in John 14 2. in my father's house this is Jesus speaking and of course he identifies himself as the great Shepherd so David was speaking of of of Christ and he says in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again now like I said many things have been prepared in this life for you but to think of it that he prepares a place that is so far beyond the thoughts of humanity he prepares a place that the devil will have no influence whatsoever ain't that right and if I go and prepare a place for you listen I will come again this is the shepherd I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also listen what's the purpose of his coming again to receive us and lead us to the place that he's prepared that that that politics knows nothing about the greatest genius can ever get us there it would take the Lord Our Shepherd to lead us to the place that he's prepared ain't that right so then we find the meaning of this in John 14 and 18 I will come to you remember he said I'll not leave you comfortless I will come to you ain't that right come to you and yet a little while the world seeth me no more but you see me because I live you shall live also and at that day you shall know that I'm in the father my father you and me and I in you ain't that right now what is it in this day we realize that he's here you believe he's here brother random said he's here in the Dynamics he is the Dynamics ain't that right that brother Brown says my Ministry is a different Ministry it's different from Radio preachers his television preachers from any kind of preacher his ministry is different so so to think of this now you'll not get what you need in any other you you ain't going to get it in TD Jakes Benny him you ain't gonna get in some Baptist Doctrine Pentecostal Doctrine his ministry is totally different from anything else my Ministry is a different Ministry from a pastor or a teacher and if I say things wrong Brethren forgive me I don't mean it but this is my Ministry and that's to declare that he's here can you say Amen he's here amen so then we find that he's here to receive us and to lead us to the place he's prepared you believe it John 16 13. Jesus said how be it when he everybody say he the Lord Our Shepherd and now Jesus would reuse another terminology when he the spirit of Truth is come not not many he's there's not many many people or or whatever Gods when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth and brother Brandon said what this is is giving you all these Divine promises and you say Amen you you will not be able to get into the Divine promises until the shepherd which is the spirit of Truth come and lead you into it ain't that right these promises are true every other promise is just a mirage but the promises that God makes is true and it takes a Shepherd to lead us through them ain't that right giving you all these Divine promises he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come ain't that right notice now he does not come to us in his physical body but he does come to us as the spirit of Truth how did he come to Jesus John said he saw the Holy Spirit descend upon him in the form of a dove ain't that right yes sir so the great Shepherd that David is speaking of is the spirit of Truth and he comes to us our Shepherd think of it he comes to us in the form of a dove that's why brother Brandon would preach them sermons The Lamb and the dove you ought to go listen to them he said the dove is the only bird there is that doesn't have a goal there's no bitterness about a dove that's why the dove had to return to the Ark in in Noah's day why because it could not eat off them dead carcasses you understand that brother Brown says if the dove is in you it will never lead you to the dead carry on things of the world it ain't gonna lead you to the dead formalities of church it ain't going to lead you to the dead seminaries and the dead religions and the dead philosophies of the world amen talking about our Shepherd the Lord is my shepherd see and so uh the dove just can't digest another thing to Dove is the meekest of all the birds that fly into heaven a lamb is the meekest of all animals that are upon the Earth the dove is the most gentle thing of the heavens the lamb is the most gentle thing there is on the Earth so God would make himself in the same like nature as us or make us in the same night like nature as him lamb and the dove a lamb ain't going or the dove ain't gonna lead a wolf it catch brother Brown said it won't even land upon a wolf it has to have a nature their nature a right kind of nature for it to come into or land on can you say man and the prophet said there's nothing like a dove the dove is a lover and it cools in the evening time you know I looked it up the word Dove according to Webster is the soft cry or the word coup means a soft cry when I read that it just come to mind you take it whatever you want to but I thought of Matthew and I don't think I gave you the scripture Judah but Matthew 25 and 6 and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom comes go ye out to meet him that cry is a cooing making love hello amen it's it's the Holy Spirit cooing to us making love can you say man and the prophet said when the Holy Spirit Coos through his word because you remember the prophet said the bridegroom coal will come out of this the message and he said when the Holy Spirit comes to us we could back and he cools through us through his word ain't that right and we could back in answer to him see so it's the holy spirit in us that Dove that has come into us that is answering back to the word his own word can you say Amen so hopefully we can see kind of the nature that our Shepherd has he's a leader but he can only lead a certain nature can you say Amen and that nature certain Nature has to be there in order to follow him ain't that right it landed Upon Jesus the lamb and Jesus was led by that dove now he will guide you into all truth do you realize this couldn't happen to this age there's only one way to know what is truth brother Brandon said that's by the Holy Spirit Ain't Gonna Know It by Seminary ain't gonna know about doctors of divinity you'll only know it by the Holy Spirit Our Shepherd ain't that right and the Holy Spirit is the prophet of the day and he will show you things to come Prophet said he will in other words be the revealer of the secret of the heart visions and so forth and he shall speak are Shepherds going to speak I think that's important as we talked about before because the Sheep know their Shepherd by his voice not by his physical stature so to speak but by his voice ain't that right so he's come to receive us unto him but he's got to speak and that voice is a cooing it's actually a making love ain't that right to receive us unto himself now you you know these scriptures we we read them all the time I guess Revelations 10 1 John tells of his dissension and he says he cried with a loud voice ain't that right Revelations 18 8 and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people what a cooing what of what what what a voice come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her pliques at the end of the laodicea and age Jesus cries out there in Revelation 3 20. behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man will hear my voice it's the only time in the ages that we hear Christ having a voice and he's speaking and you say man and it's not just any voice it's the voice of the bridegroom it's a bridegroom call you believe that see and so hear my voice and we know why he's speaking because his sheep know my voice my sheep know my voice and it's got to speak in order for us to follow in order for him to lead us to a place that he's prepared ain't that right and I'll open the door I will come unto him come into him and will sup with him and he with me Revelations 4 1 after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither I will show you things to come I'm telling you no other voice can bring us up to that place and you say man and what is it brother Brown says and the voice sounds at the end of the church ages after the church Jesus are done finished then the voice speaks to John come up hither ain't that right brother Rand said see after the church Ages was over and everything was come ready made ready the setting of the fourth chapter here the church Ages was done he had done let the Earth remembered the voice that spoke to him behind him in the seven golden candlesticks the work was finished now that same voice was speaking up in heaven what was it he had done redeemed his people his Earthly work was finished and he's in glory calling to John come up hither ain't that right it's a Heavenly voice and after he says in another place after the church Ages were over we find then that John was a type of every True Believer that will be summoned by Christ on high every believer every sheep of God is going to be summons brother Brown said this is the bride going in the rapture hello it's true so it's the voice of the shepherd speaking in this day I believe this is just where we're at Amen in this hour if the Lord isn't your Shepherd you're not going in a rapture ain't that right you're going to miss it see so the Rapture is an event that only happens by the voice of the Lord ain't that right first Thessalonians 4 16 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven this I I believe every scripture that we're reading here today it ties them together I will come again I will I've gone to prepare a place and I will come again then he says I will come to you and at that day you will know that I am with the father and the father in me or you and me and I and you and and all of these things and the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with the Shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first first can you say Amen there's something about the voice of the shepherd that it has the power to raise the Dead ain't that right brother Brown said it's the same voice that summoned Lazarus out of the grave look at him in an impossible situation four days dead the worms had already devour in his body but the voice of God spoke can you say amen and it doesn't matter where the believer is he could be ate up by sharks he could be ate up you know uh uh suck at the bottom of the old he could be you know caught up in a house fire and burned ashes he had blown up it does not matter when the voice of the Lord speaks the dead in Christ will rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord what is it he's come to lead us and to guide us his voice I thought also brother Branham in speaking of Israel coming out of Egypt said they had what first the word second the prophet third an angel to lead them to guide them and everyone agreed with the other the three of them the word agreed with the prophet and the prophet agreed with the word the angel agreed with all three of them or all of them the word the prophet and Angel and they were ready for the March hello that's how they come out of Egypt the word the prophet and an angel to go before them to lead them in the way what a Shepherd do we have he said oh blessed be the name of the Lord God we're at the end time the word the prophet and the angel all three of them together one great testimony God always said in the mouth of two or three witness let every word be established and a true Prophet will always agree with the word and any angel will testify of Truth we're ready for marching orders we're back to that day again we've had a prophet we've got the word and the angel of the Lord is here and they're all saying the same thing can you say Amen so what a day that we're living in oh that's so wonderful amen our our hopes should be alive tonight now David says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want. one definition for the word one is Desiring to have I shall not want David says I shall not be dissatisfied I shall not be discontented you know some children are so spoiled that no matter what you give them they'll never be content right never content always wanting more but David said I shall not want. I like that word you see if you notice the shepherd's not an Aaron boy the Sheep telling the shepherd what they want and what they need and go do this and go do that that's that's not the relationship that sheep have with the shepherd the Sheep isn't telling him leading him but for knowledge the knowledge to know what the Sheep need lays in the shepherd you believe it the Sheep the shepherd knows the Sheep another definition for the word want is to lack to be without to have a need now they're they're you know well we'll go on so the Lord is my shepherd I shall not lack I shall not be without he's my shepherd what a comfort it is to know that you won't lack ah this is important for this day it's really important that we should not lack that we should not want when there is a lack in the human body it causes a person to act strange remember brother Brandon tell us about the boy that was eating the erasers off the pencils and eating a rubber off his bicycle pedals that's not normal his parents realized something wrong that boy to eat rubber so they take him to the doctor and they've done a lot of tests upon it on him trying to find out and they found a lacking and that was the lack of sulfur his body was craving sulfur and there was a lack for it and so he was he was doing strange acting strange you know the prophet also says that when people are hungry they'll eat from anywhere if children and people are starving they'll eat from a garbage can that once ate from a nice table but if they're hungry they'll eat anywheres ain't that right because there's a lacking and when there's a lacking it causes it causes people to just go crazy to do whatever they need to do to fulfill that lacking ain't that right see sheep have needs that must be taken care of but the thing is the shepherd is the only one that can take care of it ain't that right you got to have a shepherd now we we find brother Brown says now God gives the control tower to you I'm just thinking of this want now this this this this one this desire this crave this because of the lack God gives the control tower to you to give to you the things that you need and the control tower in you is what directs you like this thirst it runs in see this you know this control tower and tells you what you have need of spiritually speaking just like a man in the natural he's thirsty he's got to find water he's got to find something ain't that right I don't know about you but man I've been thirsty just so thirsty and drink pop after you drink it it's still you're thirsty still you drink Kool-Aid you're still thirsty you drink whatever you're still thirsty but really what you need is water to really satisfy that quenching now David found something that would satisfy verse said the Lord is my shepherd I shall not watch so so so whatever he was lacking the shepherd found it to meet the need right so now he says see it tells you what you have need see the control tower in the body and in the soul also there is a control tower in the body that tells you the need that's needed in your body and it's brought to you by thirst also there is a control tower in your soul that tells you the spiritual things that you have need of something in your spirit and you can and and and you buy this can tell what kind of life is controlling you by The Desires in your soul you can tell what nature is controlling you the wolf has no need of a shepherd but he's got a different life in him he's got a different nature can you say Amen the coyote doesn't have need of the shepherd but the sea and his desire is totally different than the Sheep now you find the need has to be met and there's something in you that's calling out no matter what life is in there it's calling out the need has to be met right now brother Brown says when you can see what your desires are then you can tell by that what kind of something that's in you that's creating this desire that you have see there is a certain thing that you thirst for and it can tell you in your soul what this desire is by the nature of The Thirst that you have so there is a control tower of the Soul one for the body and each Tower is a warning caller for the needs of the other each one calls you the need for the for what the caller is calling for and it sends out a wave of warning is that right I gotta have I gotta have water I'm thirsty I'm dying of thirst you know I gotta have something to eat dying of starvation there's something in there that's calling ain't that right so is it to every believer there's something that's calling God didn't send a prophet in vain he sent a prophet to meet that need so does he send preachers today still to meet that need right so he says now see for instance the flesh thirsts to satisfy the desire that's in the body and the spirit desires for the things that's in the soul see desire is many times and they wore one against the other we find what a great trouble is today that too many people try to live between those two desires one of them desires the things of the earth and the other desires the things of Heaven can you say Amen one desires the carnal things and the other desired spiritual things oh my God now the world is there to try to satisfy that flesh you got to find out what kind of Shepherd the Lord is he ain't gonna feed his sheep candy bars when they need grass he ain't going to feed his sheep Briars when they need healthy things he's not going to feed his sheep things that will hurt him and too many people desire and they're following that fleshly desire expecting the Lord to meet the need but the Lord isn't going to lead his sheep out that way he's a dove is this all right so we we find that if we have the Lord as our Shepherd we shall not want we shall not lack anything but notice it comes from the soul the desire is not from our flesh how can you desire in your flesh to serve God how can you desire in your flesh to to give up the world you you can't do that that has to come from something within can you say man and what you're Desiring what you're feeding off shows what kind of life is in you now notice the Lord is my shepherd so the need is going to be met then why why can't everybody be satisfied with the Lord being their Shepherd because they've got different desires than what his sheep would have ain't that right now notice Peter tells us that the Lord is the shepherd and Bishop of our soul our soul Psalms 107 9 he satisfied the longing soul and feel it the hungry soul with goodness ain't that right now brother Brian Murray talked about we we talked about even last Wednesday about the the the Sheep the lamb being a sacrificial lamb and how that we have to die out every day every day to desires of the flesh every day dying out to this world dying out to our own thoughts dying out to it all can you say Amen amen sheep's got to be fed right is that right and notice Psalms 34 2 the Lord shall preserve thee from all evil I didn't give you these scriptures either they came to me as as I was down there he shall preserve thy soul ain't that right so when David is saying I shall not want the desire from his soul remember he says one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after and you say Amen but then he realized that the Lord is my shepherd and that desire is going to be met you say man Psalms 35 9 my soul shall be joyful in the Lord it shall rejoice in his salvation oh that's wonderful huh so now if there's a need it shows that there's something lacking something lacking what makes people get tattoos on them something's lacking what makes them be homosexuals and transgender something's something's lacking man what makes them to steal something's lacking murder it says you know there's something lacking in this world they have feasted they have feasted off the carry-ons of this world they have feasted off the carry-ons of religion they have feasted off the Creeds of man and traditions of man and they're still lacking can you say Amen the seminaries have not satisfied The Thirst that's in this world politics has not satisfied The Thirst that is lacking or this need that is lacking can you say Amen and when you're lacking you do things that you normally wouldn't do don't feed off them video games it will lead you to a place you don't want to go because anything you're feeding off you're going to show the results of it lift off candy bars all your life you're gonna show results honestly I have not that I used to drink Mountain Dew all the time that's what I'd say but what you feed off is going to show hello there's things that you can feed off that'll give you strings and there's other things you can feed off and you can feed and feed and feed and be not Mount malnutrition and you say man now the the the the flesh the world is is trying to satisfy the flesh that ain't meeting the need for the soul can you say Amen it's the soul that needs to live it's the soul that needs to be restored it's the soul that needs to be quickened and you say Amen you you can be materialistic hungry and have all the money in the world and is still locking something in your soul but David says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want I mean people said in churches and they're not satisfied because the Lord ain't their Shepherd they'll go to a basketball game and they'll shout and they'll scream and only to be dissatisfied even if their team is winning and even if they go to the Nationals because the soul is not satisfied only the shepherd can satisfy the soul what makes young people been raised in church want to be like the world it shows there's a need hello shows there's a need because they're trying to serve the Lord by their flesh you ain't going to get any peace I live it like the world girls you can go cut your hair you'll be so dissatisfied you don't put on the britches like them other women but you're going to be dissatisfied you can put tattoos all over your face and you'll still be dissatisfied because it has nothing to satisfy the soul ain't that right now notice brother Brown says just going to read here different places the church lacks the warning of making ready that's a need in the church the church lacks wisdom that's a need in the church now I want you to understand there's a difference in nominal Church in in Bride hello the church lacks a burning Everlasting faith you know the Bible says that uh I I don't know if it was Peter or Paul but said they'd have a form of godliness speaking of the people of this day that they'd have a form of godliness and deny the power thereof and brother Brown says what it would be it's not the lack of power that we have it's the lack of faith that we have they deny the power the power is there but they ain't got the faith enough to tap into that power and use that power turn to doctors they'll turn to psychologists they'll turn to psychiatrists and turn to everything else so brother Brown says they lack the faith to operate the power amen he says he is here right now right at this minute he is here and the only thing it lacks is for your faith to pick up that word and anoint it to yourself and he will heal you so it isn't that he wasn't there in that meeting it's not that he's not here tonight it's the lack of faith that people have to take that word and anoint it to themselves so that God could heal them he said I want you to get built up now all this holy Oracles of God in the faith and notice what he says the faith of this hour everybody say the faith of this hour now see the shepherd knows what we have need of for this hour he knows what we have need of oh if we can understand see the faith of this hour it's going to take more faith than ever was in any age for this has to be a rapturing faith to be taken up so there's a need in the church brother Brandon speaking to the Pentecostal church that had all the gifts speaking in tongues roll it on the floor all the sensations all of them things and after Azusa Street and now he's telling them there's a lacking in the church we've got to have faith more faith than ever but the shepherd knows his sheep and knows how to provide another thing and I'm going to close in a moment but another thing the church is lacking is love that's what he said not filial love that most people run on thinking it's divine love bitty said we need Divine love that's what's lacking and as we said before Divine love causes you to do the will of God first and foremost but notice what he says now he says thus saith the Lord it'll take perfect love to put you in that place for that's all there was there remember what place the place he's prepared amen and it's going to take perfect love to put you there no matter how many how much religious demonstrations how many Good Deeds you've done or whatever you've done that won't count nothing on that day it'll take perfect love so whatever you do you lay aside everything else until you're just so filled with the love of God till you can love those who hate you you say man now notice I believe it was the angel of the Lord speaking to brother Branham or baby brother Branham just telling of his his experience of going beyond the curtain of time that he says this press on everybody say Press On press on in that perfect love which will take you to that beautiful place joyful place beyond the curtain of time so you see the lacking you see the the things that you know and and and you could uh uh there was just a great lacking in the church but Philippians uh I believe 419 Paul would tell us but my God everybody say my God the same same God that David said the Lord is my shepherd Paul is saying my God shall supply all your needs according to his riches in Glory by Christ Jesus now brother Rams would say we've got to have rapturing faith in a church that can be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye to go out or will not go but notice he doesn't stop there but he says but don't worry it'll be there why the Lord is my shepherd he said I believe that the Ages come now the miraculous the phenomenal the baptism of the Holy Spirit and power and signs and wonders this great pouring out of God's spirit in the last days that's the thing that'll bring Faith into the people that'll take a rapturing faith that'll take the church and the glory he promised to meet the need and he came himself in power in the phenomenal in the Supernatural to give Faith to this bride one place brother Bram says God intended this church to be a powerful Church a glorious Church so you see the need right he intended this church and people want to go back to the the Azusa Street that wasn't what God intended now that that's part of it that was a place prepared for that time but there's another place prepared can you say man that'll have no more trouble that'll have no more trial that'll be no more Sorrows than crying and and and and crying over lost loved ones and and and and and the ones that have gone on there'll be no more of that no more enemy to deal with can you say Amen and he's intended for this church to be a powerful Church a glorious Church a church that the whole world could look upon as the bride of Christ think of that now that's a need not look upon this church as a Pentecostal Church as a Baptist Church as as a Methodist Church but as what she is the bride of Christ well expected and espoused to live in such an atmosphere in conduct in itself uh conduct itself in such a way that God would be proud of this church to present it to Christ at the coming of the Lord black the need but he promised it'll be there he's here he's here he's come to us to lead us oh this okay now the prophet said God uh uh well I just read that but Psalms 34 9 oh fear the lord ye his Saints for there is no want everybody say there is no want to them that fear Him and that word fears respect him reverence him can you say Amen and believe me only his sheep will reverence him and fear Him for he's their Shepherd amen there is no want to them that fear Him the Young Lions do lack and suffer hunger but they that seek the Lord shall not want or lack any good thing what a contrast to this laodicean church Revelations 3 and 15 I Know Thy works the Thou Art neither cold nor hot I would that that word cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and either cold or hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich increase with goods and have need of nothing and know it's not that thou art wretched miserable poor blind and naked so they're saying they have everything they ain't got nothing no need of nothing and yet the prophet or Christ is telling them you have need of everything and you say man but what is it what they desire see they had what they desired that they still act right they chose Creeds but they're still lacking they chose traditions of man but they're still lacking they chose just to be religious but they're still lacking and God knows that they're lacking right Isaiah 4 1 in that day seven women shall take a hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and we're on apparel but only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach now you know brother bran tied this to this day as an adulterous day adultery both spiritual and natural now notice the Bible said that the people of this day will be led by their own lusts ain't that right they want to take the name of God they want to bear his name but they want to be led by their own lust we'll lead our own bread we we we will eat what we think is best for us but the Sheep relies upon the shepherd right and as Peter said even denying the Lord that bought them they deny him the right to rule over them they Delight him the right to lead them and to guide them they they deny him the rights to care for them and you say Amen I want you to notice Deuteronomy 28 47. because thou service not the Lord thy God with joyfulness see we've got to serve the Lord in the right way because thou service the Lord not the Lord thy God with joyfulness and gladness of heart for the abundance of all things therefore shall thy shalt thou serve thine enemies which the Lord shall send against thee in hunger in thirst in nakedness and in want of all things and he shall put a yoke of iron upon my neck until he have destroyed thee now look where we're at look at the church world today look look at it all God sent them what they had need of spiritually but they did not did not Delight in that abundance they they did not Delight in the abundance of his care for them they did not Delight in his the abundance of his provisions and you say man and they put him outside the church and he's knocking trying to get into the age again hello and so this is where the nominal Church stands today you did not Delight in the Lord you certain not the Lord thy God with joyfulness and gladness of heart for the abundance of all things he come with his abundance but they didn't want it they wanted to take his name but eat of their own bread of their own provisions so then served the Lord and they're doing it today They don't serve the Lord with gladness for what he's done for them oh they serve the Lord they worshiping the Lord thinking their Worship in the Lord anyways singing and dancing but all the while look what we've done oh we made a name for ourselves we're Baptists look at our organization look what we're doing we're Pentecostals and they're not rejoicing and serving the lord with gladness for the abundance he's provided can you say man therefore they're going to serve their enemy which the Lord sins against them in hunger thirst nakedness and in want of all things Peter tells us to add to our faith virtue knowledge Temperance godliness patience brotherly kindness and charity Divine love right we got to add these things second Peter 2 or 1 and 8 and if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor and fruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ you shall not lack right but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see it far off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins but notice what the prophet would say the confidence of the believer that he has in his maker that he promised to meet the need you love the Lord if the musicians will come and brother Brandon would say the voice of God today is here to meet the need of the hour the voice of God today is meeting the need of the hour and we're finding that our desire is not for fame and fortune our desire is not for wealth and power we're not craving position in this life that's not the need that the church has that we're finding the shepherd has spoken in this age and he's meeting the needs can you say Amen don't worry it'll be there I love the Lord do you love the Lord the Lord is my shepherd see it was his voice that when the world Earth was without form it was void and darkness covered the Earth it was his voice and said let there be and there was that's the that's the shepherd Shepherd that David's talking about he's my creator it's the same Lord that met with Abraham that would take as the prophet say take a spoonful of dust just to dust and create a body and live in it and walk to Abraham and talk to him face to face and then telling this time according to life you shall have the time of life you shall have a son ain't that right That Glory that God that would discern Sarah's heart her thoughts amen that Lord is my shepherd and we've seen him come today in this hour Discerning the thoughts and the hearts of the people we've seen that same voice create squirrels into existence we've seen that same voice speak life to a fish and give Hattie Wright her boys salvation to them boys then you say Amen and that same voice is speaking today meeting the need in your life I'm so glad he's my shepherd I love him what song you're playing because he lives I can
