[1:17:05] licks of fire with uh Believers amen
[1:17:09] when you get Believers all gathered
[1:17:11] together and when you know that the
[1:17:13] supernatural power of God is here with
[1:17:16] us tabernacling in us well then it's
[1:17:20] it's unlimited what God can do for us
[1:17:23] nothing is impossible with God and
[1:17:28] nothing is impossible with you either
[1:17:30] all things are possible to them that
[1:17:33] believe and
[1:17:34] it's just it just what can we say about
[1:17:38] the word that we've heard thus far and
[1:17:42] uh just uh brother Timothy and uh
[1:17:46] brother Wendell and last night and it's
[1:17:49] just been a tremendous time and just
[1:17:53] feeding on the word and I I think it's
[1:17:55] what the prophet said it's the unfailing
[1:17:58] Bodywork word of the son of man this is
[1:18:02] not a man that we're feeding on we are
[1:18:04] feeding on Jesus Christ
[1:18:07] and uh I tell you what it's giving us
[1:18:10] rapturing strength it's giving us
[1:18:12] Rapture and Grace and uh you you feel it
[1:18:16] you you see it and um it's uh I tell you
[1:18:21] what I want more of him
[1:18:23] amen and uh we uh we just want to Echo
[1:18:29] what brother Wayne said uh yesterday and
[1:18:33] what he was before he started he just
[1:18:36] spoke my heart as well speaking of all
[1:18:39] of the work and the labor and and to
[1:18:41] everyone that has uh just uh put their
[1:18:45] their efforts in making this uh meeting
[1:18:48] possible and
[1:18:50] um I tell you what the the work uh it's
[1:18:54] a tremendous tremendous undertaking but
[1:18:58] I believe that the the the rewards and
[1:19:01] the fruit is eternal
[1:19:04] and I I think from these meetings it's
[1:19:08] going to be something that uh on the
[1:19:11] other side will truly see everything
[1:19:14] that took place and uh what God has
[1:19:17] truly done through these meetings and so
[1:19:20] if you have your Bible
[1:19:22] we uh we just deem it a great privilege
[1:19:25] to be here and
[1:19:27] uh
[1:19:28] to be able to preach
[1:19:31] the message of the hour with such a
[1:19:34] caliber of of men as that is preaching
[1:19:38] these meetings
[1:19:39] we can turn to John the first chapter
[1:19:46] and then
[1:19:48] we'll turn to Isaiah
[1:19:51] the 60th chapter
[1:19:58] these are very familiar scriptures to us
[1:20:05] but as we read out of John the first
[1:20:08] chapter
[1:20:10] I think that we read this portion of
[1:20:12] scripture with a revelation
[1:20:15] that this is not just speaking
[1:20:17] of
[1:20:19] a day gone by but this is also speaking
[1:20:22] of the day that we live in
[1:20:26] and so John the first chapter
[1:20:30] in the beginning
[1:20:32] was the word
[1:20:34] and the Word was with God
[1:20:37] and the Word was God
[1:20:41] brother Branham would take us to the
[1:20:43] meaning of in the beginning was the word
[1:20:46] and he would say that it is meaning the
[1:20:49] logos or the Christ
[1:20:53] or the pillar of Fire
[1:20:56] or the angel of the Covenant it's all
[1:21:00] referring to the same one the word
[1:21:05] so in the beginning was the word
[1:21:08] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:21:11] was God
[1:21:13] the same was in the beginning with God
[1:21:16] all things were made by him
[1:21:19] and without him was not anything made
[1:21:22] that was made in him was life and the
[1:21:26] life was the light of men
[1:21:29] and the light shineth in darkness and
[1:21:32] the Darkness comprehended it not
[1:21:35] there was a man sent from God whose name
[1:21:38] was John
[1:21:39] the same came for a witness to Bear
[1:21:41] witness of the light that all men
[1:21:45] through him might believe he was not
[1:21:49] that light
[1:21:50] but was sent to Bear witness of that
[1:21:53] light
[1:21:53] that was the True Light which lighteth
[1:21:57] every man that cometh into the world he
[1:22:01] was in the world and the world was made
[1:22:03] by him and the world knew him not
[1:22:07] he came unto his own in his own received
[1:22:11] him not
[1:22:12] but as many as received him
[1:22:15] to them gave he power to become the sons
[1:22:19] of God even to them that believe on his
[1:22:24] name
[1:22:25] which were born not a blood nor of the
[1:22:28] will of the flesh nor of the will of men
[1:22:31] but of God and the Word was made flesh
[1:22:35] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[1:22:37] glory the glory as of the only begotten
[1:22:41] of the father full of grace and truth
[1:22:45] John bear witness of him and cried
[1:22:47] saying this was he of whom I spake he
[1:22:51] that cometh after me is preferred before
[1:22:54] me for he was before me now let's turn
[1:23:00] over to Isaiah 60
[1:23:03] and we'll read the first two verses
[1:23:11] arise
[1:23:12] shine now we know who he's talking to
[1:23:15] he's talking to you
[1:23:18] he's talking to a last day people the
[1:23:21] Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:23:23] arise Shine for thy light is come whose
[1:23:29] light has come
[1:23:30] thy light is come and the glory of the
[1:23:36] Lord is risen upon thee
[1:23:40] before Behold The Darkness shall cover
[1:23:42] the Earth and gross Darkness the people
[1:23:46] but the Lord shall arise upon thee
[1:23:51] and His glory shall be seen upon thee
[1:23:57] now let's just if we can let's just bow
[1:24:00] our hearts one more time in a word of
[1:24:02] prayer father we want to express our
[1:24:06] love and confidence and appreciation for
[1:24:10] your grace upon us and to allow us to
[1:24:13] come into these meetings father we're
[1:24:16] gathered under a Vindicated message
[1:24:19] and Lord we're here identified as
[1:24:22] Believers of this message
[1:24:24] then Lord Let the Fire Fall just pour
[1:24:28] out your spirit and move in such a
[1:24:30] supernatural way we give ourselves
[1:24:33] completely over to you Lord do as you
[1:24:37] will Lord in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:24:40] amen and amen God bless you you may be
[1:24:44] seated the prophet or for a title I
[1:24:49] would like to just title this the
[1:24:52] manifested word
[1:24:54] and uh we we are in a season of
[1:24:59] manifestation and the prophet of God
[1:25:02] would say in spiritual food and do
[1:25:05] season he says I want you to get built
[1:25:08] up now in this holy Oracles of God in
[1:25:13] the faith the faith of this hour the
[1:25:16] faith it's going to take more faith than
[1:25:20] ever was in any age for this has to be
[1:25:22] rapturing Faith be taken up and so we
[1:25:27] want you to believe tonight in all that
[1:25:30] you have seen heard the word that you
[1:25:34] have heard preached the signs and
[1:25:37] wonders that you have seen done we want
[1:25:41] you to accumulate all that together in
[1:25:45] your heart and consider it whether if
[1:25:48] that be of God or not whether that be
[1:25:52] God or not now I think that we have made
[1:25:57] our decision we have seen we have heard
[1:26:01] we have heard the message of the hour we
[1:26:06] have seen the signs and the Wonders and
[1:26:08] the Vindication of the message of the
[1:26:11] hour and we do declare that this is God
[1:26:15] this is not a man this is not a workup
[1:26:18] this is not a man's Revival this is not
[1:26:22] something that man is trying to organize
[1:26:24] lives and trying to put over but we see
[1:26:28] that this is the manifestation of the
[1:26:31] power and the anointing of God in this
[1:26:34] last day this is the Fulfillment of
[1:26:37] Prophecy that that says that in the
[1:26:40] evening time there shall be lied now the
[1:26:45] prophet taught us what light is is the
[1:26:49] word made manifest is lied now we have
[1:26:53] went through the denominational ages and
[1:26:56] where men have tried to figure out the
[1:26:59] Bible and they have brought forth
[1:27:01] teachings and they probed out these
[1:27:04] secrets and the Mysteries that have been
[1:27:06] hid and and it has brought much
[1:27:09] confusion it's brought an idea here and
[1:27:13] they denominated and it's brought
[1:27:14] another idea here and they denominated
[1:27:16] over that and and it's it's brought us
[1:27:20] into uh the age that we are in and that
[1:27:23] is dark
[1:27:24] laodicea and the spiritual condition is
[1:27:28] death it's a it's a spiritually dead
[1:27:31] Condition it's identified in the
[1:27:34] scripture as Babylon which is confusion
[1:27:38] there's much confusion everywhere you
[1:27:41] turn it's confusion no one knows what to
[1:27:45] believe in this hour amen and so again
[1:27:49] it is identified as Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:27:53] as it was in the days of lot Sodom
[1:27:58] conditions so shall it be in the
[1:28:00] revealing of the son of man and so gross
[1:28:04] darkness of unbelief has covered
[1:28:07] Humanity but you see the only thing that
[1:28:10] can defeat darkness is light
[1:28:13] amen it's not another idea it's not
[1:28:17] another church it's not another Creed
[1:28:20] it's not another idea the only thing
[1:28:24] thing that can defeat darkness is light
[1:28:27] and again what is light the word made
[1:28:32] manifest is the light now you see the
[1:28:36] prophet says that just like he did in
[1:28:39] Genesis 1 3 it said let there be light
[1:28:42] and light come forth his word went forth
[1:28:46] and light followed it and cleared away
[1:28:49] the mist and the Darkness went to one
[1:28:52] corner and the light shined on the other
[1:28:55] side that's the way God does today he
[1:29:00] sends his word for this hour and the
[1:29:03] Holy Spirit comes and makes that word
[1:29:06] live and the Darkness goes on to their
[1:29:09] Creeds and denominations but light
[1:29:12] shines because it is the word of God
[1:29:15] being Vindicated that his word is true
[1:29:19] now there is nothing fictitious about
[1:29:22] that that's just exactly exactly the
[1:29:25] scripture you see then this is the
[1:29:28] message of the hour this is the message
[1:29:32] that we have heard amen that this is the
[1:29:36] message that God is light and in him
[1:29:40] there is no Darkness at all and John
[1:29:45] said if we walk in the light as he is in
[1:29:50] the light we have Fellowship one with
[1:29:53] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:29:56] his son cleanseth us from all sin amen
[1:30:01] there is no true Unity outside of the
[1:30:04] Vindicated light of the hour if you want
[1:30:07] True Fellowship then you unite around a
[1:30:11] Vindicated word in this day and hour if
[1:30:14] you want to see Jesus Christ raised to
[1:30:17] the power of his resurrection you unite
[1:30:19] around a Vindicated word amen if you
[1:30:23] want the blood that you cover your sins
[1:30:26] and take away all of your unbelief and
[1:30:29] you want to be clothed with the
[1:30:31] righteousness of the blood of Jesus
[1:30:33] Christ then you come under the headship
[1:30:36] of a Vindicated message for he is the
[1:30:40] word made manifest it's not a dead Creed
[1:30:44] it's an anointed light there is a man
[1:30:48] that can turn on the light there is a
[1:30:51] man that can take away the confusion
[1:30:54] there is a man that can give you
[1:30:56] rapturing Faith there is a man that can
[1:31:00] break the shackles there is a man that
[1:31:03] can defeat sin there is a man he's here
[1:31:07] he's the anointed reveal the word of the
[1:31:11] hour it's not a man it's the man
[1:31:16] Jesus Christ the Vindicated word of the
[1:31:20] hour
[1:31:21] Hallelujah
[1:31:24] you see his son it's the Sun that
[1:31:27] influences the natural seed it creates
[1:31:30] an atmosphere for life to be made
[1:31:33] manifest
[1:31:34] and we are under the teaching and the
[1:31:38] influence and the creative atmosphere of
[1:31:42] the Vindicated word of the hour you see
[1:31:45] a prophet is a teacher amen that's what
[1:31:49] a prophet is a teacher of his message
[1:31:53] amen and the fruit of the message is the
[1:31:58] words
[1:31:59] a man not a word that is here dormant
[1:32:03] but it is a sunlight that is shining
[1:32:07] upon this word to pull out the
[1:32:10] scriptures that is prophesied for this
[1:32:13] last day and to shine light upon this
[1:32:16] scripture and say these signs shall
[1:32:20] follow them that believe in my name you
[1:32:24] shall cast out Devils that's not a myth
[1:32:27] that's not some man it's the Vindicated
[1:32:30] sunlight shining upon this word the
[1:32:34] words that I do shall you do also every
[1:32:38] devil is under your feet it is the
[1:32:43] anointed revealed word
[1:32:45] shining upon this word
[1:32:49] we are under the influence
[1:32:52] what's wrong with your preacher I'm
[1:32:55] under the influence

[1:33:00] the influence why are you so fanatical
[1:33:03] with this faith I'm under the influence
[1:33:07] amen I know what it is to be under the
[1:33:11] influence of death I know what it is to
[1:33:14] be under the influence of hybrid
[1:33:16] religion but I know what it is to be set
[1:33:21] free by the power of the Risen sunlight
[1:33:24] he's not dead He's Alive it's the Healer
[1:33:29] and I miss it's the deliverer in our
[1:33:32] midst he has risen
[1:33:39] you see the prophet of God said that
[1:33:41] it's the manifestation of the son of man
[1:33:45] it's the manifested words
[1:33:51] you see
[1:33:54] remember
[1:33:56] he said John
[1:33:58] was sent to prepare the way
[1:34:01] for the word to be made manifest
[1:34:04] he was not the light
[1:34:06] but he was to prepare the way for the
[1:34:10] light to be made manifest
[1:34:13] and the prophet of God he says now he
[1:34:16] was the voice of one crying in the
[1:34:18] wilderness prepare the way of the Lord
[1:34:19] and make his path straight was he
[1:34:23] preparing the way of the word then that
[1:34:25] the word could be made manifest and the
[1:34:27] prophet says hallelujah

[1:34:34] minute in the last days there's got to
[1:34:37] be a place prepared for the work to be

[1:39:17] of the hour
[1:39:19] it's Christ
[1:39:22] it's the anointed one
[1:39:26] as
[1:39:29] listening to a message the other day and
[1:39:31] brother Branham says that that Moses
[1:39:33] following the pillar of fire let the
[1:39:35] children of Israel to the Red Sea
[1:39:39] and then here come pharaoh and his
[1:39:40] armies
[1:39:43] and Hallelujah and they begin to cry and
[1:39:45] they begin to well and they begin to
[1:39:48] amen we're going to be lost in
[1:39:50] everything else
[1:39:51] and then the prophet says but then Jesus
[1:39:53] came
[1:39:55] you mean Jesus was in the Old Testament
[1:39:58] how did Jesus get in the Old Testament
[1:40:02] how did Jesus amen Jesus well I'll tell
[1:40:06] you how Jesus got there in the beginning
[1:40:09] was the word and the Word was with God
[1:40:12] and the Word was God and the Word was
[1:40:16] made flesh and dwelt Among Us and John
[1:40:19] the Elijah anointing said this is the
[1:40:22] one that I've been telling you about
[1:40:24] he's preferred before me because he was
[1:40:28] before me but I declare that he's the
[1:40:31] same yesterday today and forever he is
[1:40:36] the word he'll be the word hell I'm
[1:40:39] going through a hard time the word I'm
[1:40:42] going through difficulty the word oh but
[1:40:45] brother Jonathan you don't understand
[1:40:46] but the word and it's not a letter it's
[1:40:51] the manifested Vindicated word shining
[1:40:54] on the word and says you can't believe
[1:40:57] it
[1:40:57] [Applause]
[1:41:01] he's already manifested healing he's
[1:41:04] already manifested Deliverance he's
[1:41:07] already manifested Joy he's already
[1:41:09] manifested the Holy Ghost
[1:41:12] we're not waiting for it to be
[1:41:14] manifested we are the manifestation
[1:41:18] [Applause]
[1:41:27] oh yes we're living by the evidence
[1:41:32] grape juice all over me
[1:41:36] it's the wine of stimulation when a
[1:41:39] promised word is made manifest it
[1:41:41] stimulates
[1:41:43] if the word has not been made manifest
[1:41:45] then you've got an excuse there's no
[1:41:48] stimulation but if this message has
[1:41:50] become a personal revelation to you
[1:41:53] there is a stimulation of Revelation The
[1:41:56] Joy bills are ringing in your soul it's
[1:41:59] because you are stimulated
[1:42:02] what happened on the day of Pentecost
[1:42:04] when the new wine was being poured out
[1:42:06] amen they didn't burst amen they were
[1:42:09] fresh skins they were fresh anointed
[1:42:12] skins they were fresh word made manifest
[1:42:16] that was waiting for the Vindicated
[1:42:18] light to break forth upon their flesh
[1:42:21] they were waiting for the mechanics to
[1:42:23] become the Dynamics they were waiting
[1:42:26] for the stimulation of Revelation to
[1:42:29] sweep over them oh yes they have to wait
[1:42:31] they waited until the day of Pentecost
[1:42:34] was fully come but when it came oh it
[1:42:38] was joy unspeakable and full of Glory
[1:42:41] they became drunk men stackering under
[1:42:45] the influence of this is that this is
[1:42:48] the word main manifest I am that I am
[1:42:53] have made this word live in my flesh
[1:42:59] what's the shouting about brother
[1:43:01] Jonathan this is that
[1:43:04] why are you being so stimulated this is
[1:43:07] that
[1:43:08] [Applause]
[1:43:13] I hate to break the news but let me just
[1:43:16] break a seal over you we're not waiting
[1:43:19] for it it's already come
[1:43:23] what's the secret what's the mystery
[1:43:26] Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:43:30] [Applause]
[1:43:36] you see the prophet of God said the
[1:43:38] seventh Angel's message is to call the
[1:43:40] people the bride out of the Pentecostal
[1:43:44] and World tradition to the genuine
[1:43:47] atonement the word Christ impersonated
[1:43:51] in his word here made flesh Among Us
[1:43:55] science has proved it by pictures the
[1:43:58] church knows it the world around we
[1:44:01] firmly know it
[1:44:05] for he's never told us one thing in thus
[1:44:09] saith the Lord but what's been the truth
[1:44:13] you see I begin to look at that if the
[1:44:16] seventh angel is calling us to a genuine
[1:44:19] atonement the word then there must have
[1:44:21] been somehow they aired and they thought
[1:44:24] that they were under the atonement but
[1:44:26] they're not under the atonement and how
[1:44:28] did it take place because of false
[1:44:31] teaching you see we're not interested in
[1:44:33] just preaching about Calvary we want the
[1:44:36] effects of calvary
[1:44:37] you see you see if all we needed was
[1:44:42] just a man was just a good sermon on
[1:44:46] Calvary then all we needed was just
[1:44:48] Billy Graham's message
[1:44:52] but you see we're not just trying to get
[1:44:55] you to the altar we're not just trying
[1:44:58] to get you to make some confession
[1:45:01] we want Calvary to be effective
[1:45:04] we want a genuine blood a genuine bleach
[1:45:09] that can annihilate unbelief in your
[1:45:12] life that you can come to a perfect
[1:45:14] faith and a perfect confidence in the
[1:45:18] blood of Jesus Christ
[1:45:23] Malachi 4 the Vindicated message of the
[1:45:27] hour has brought us back to the genuine
[1:45:30] atonement and that is the blood works
[1:45:34] the bleach of Calvary is exactly what
[1:45:39] you need to live an overcoming life
[1:45:43] to be washed
[1:45:45] girly clean
[1:45:48] you see it's a perfect place calling you
[1:45:51] to that Perfection and you have to be
[1:45:53] perfect to get there the Bible said so
[1:45:57] Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even
[1:46:01] as your father in Heaven is perfect it's
[1:46:04] a perfect Kingdom so it must be a
[1:46:07] perfect people come because you have to
[1:46:10] stand and be married to a perfect Son of
[1:46:13] God and you must be a perfect bride
[1:46:18] there's no discussion there's no well
[1:46:21] maybe and what about this no you must be
[1:46:25] a perfect bride so how can you do it
[1:46:30] through anything else but the perfect
[1:46:32] word of God which is the Waters of
[1:46:35] Separation that washes us from our sins
[1:46:38] that's right the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:46:43] think of it the dripping bloody word and
[1:46:47] the blood the word of God bleeding blood
[1:46:51] to wash the pride in yes sir she stands
[1:46:56] perfect very origin and adulterated she
[1:47:00] never sinned in the first place she was
[1:47:04] trapped into it I don't know about you
[1:47:07] but I'm not waiting for that word to be
[1:47:08] made manifest I am the manifestation I
[1:47:13] stand Here Redeemed by A Perfect lamb
[1:47:16] sacrifice I know that I know that I know
[1:47:21] that I stand Justified my faith is
[1:47:25] anchored in the atonement and I have no
[1:47:28] fear to say that I am perfect
[1:47:35] I am sinless
[1:47:37] [Applause]
[1:47:38] my confidence is in my sacrifice my
[1:47:43] confidence is in what God has Vindicated
[1:47:45] to be thus saith the Lord in this hour I
[1:47:48] have no fear to preach this message
[1:47:50] because it's the Vindicated where the
[1:47:54] Vindicated blood of God in this hour
[1:48:02] you'll never become sinless without it
[1:48:05] [Applause]
[1:48:11] because it's Jesus Christ
[1:48:14] [Applause]
[1:48:16] all right
[1:48:18] Revelations 1 and 5 from Jesus Christ
[1:48:22] who is the faithful witness once he a
[1:48:26] faithful witness over his word
[1:48:28] and the first begotten of the Dead
[1:48:32] and the prince of the kings of the earth
[1:48:35] unto him that loved us and washed us
[1:48:41] from our sins in his own blood
[1:48:45] wash means loose
[1:48:49] it's the same word that when Lazarus was
[1:48:52] dead
[1:48:54] in a cold
[1:48:56] cold
[1:48:59] formal
[1:49:04] [Applause]
[1:49:08] no life
[1:49:11] just dead
[1:49:14] but Jesus
[1:49:17] Jesus said there's a season for my word
[1:49:19] to be made manifest
[1:49:22] so they're trying to bring him on the
[1:49:24] scene
[1:49:27] but he cannot operate outside of his
[1:49:30] season
[1:49:33] so instead of going to Lazarus
[1:49:36] he just waited
[1:49:38] because my meat is to do the will of the
[1:49:40] father
[1:49:42] so Jesus had to wait what is he waiting
[1:49:45] for for the right season so the Bible
[1:49:49] says that he went four days journey
[1:49:54] and when he came in the season of
[1:49:57] restoration
[1:49:58] [Applause]
[1:50:00] when he came on the fourth day when he
[1:50:04] came in the fourth light you know I'm in
[1:50:07] the restoration of the Bride tree when
[1:50:10] he came in the fourth message
[1:50:12] [Applause]
[1:50:13] he went to the tomb of Lazarus and said
[1:50:17] hi Swiss come forth who is he calling
[1:50:21] for for that predestinated seed that was
[1:50:24] in that cold formal grave and he called
[1:50:27] him by name what is the revealing of the
[1:50:31] word doing it's calling those names you
[1:50:34] don't have to be buried in some dead
[1:50:37] cold formal tradition he's alive the
[1:50:40] Vindicated word of the hour is Jesus
[1:50:44] Christ risen and his sunlight is
[1:50:47] breaking all the denominational ideas
[1:50:49] out of us it's ripening the grain that
[1:50:53] just simply say I am him
[1:50:57] [Applause]
[1:50:58] come out of her
[1:51:06] Jesus had some help
[1:51:08] he has some Messengers
[1:51:12] he has some faithful Ministry
[1:51:17] the voice of the Resurrection The
[1:51:19] Message the shout went forth but there
[1:51:21] had to be some voice of Resurrection
[1:51:23] that said hey we gotta move this Stone
[1:51:28] we've got to roll the stone away and
[1:51:32] Jesus sent a word and said Row the stone
[1:51:35] away
[1:51:37] but it didn't stop there because Lazarus
[1:51:41] was bound up with grave clothes from the
[1:51:44] top of his head to the bottom of his
[1:51:46] feet there was a restoration message but
[1:51:51] there still had to be a word of
[1:51:54] Resurrection over Lazarus and loose him
[1:51:58] lose him from slavery loose him from
[1:52:01] those ideas lose him from unbelief lose
[1:52:05] him from all of the difficulties of
[1:52:08] complexes and fear and depression and
[1:52:12] all of the lust of laodice here
[1:52:17] stand as a witness a messenger of this
[1:52:20] evening light and say whom the Shadows
[1:52:24] set free is free indeed
[1:52:29] you're lost
[1:52:32] it's not what I said it's what he
[1:52:36] Vindicated
[1:52:37] [Applause]
[1:52:42] how'd you get here
[1:52:45] because you're loosed
[1:52:47] how'd you get out of that Baptist
[1:52:49] tradition you're loosed
[1:52:52] how'd you get out of that Pentecostal
[1:52:54] tradition you're loosed
[1:52:57] but it's time to go ahead and just loose
[1:52:59] you all the way
[1:53:01] these complexes that keep you bound up
[1:53:03] that you can't say that you're the Bride
[1:53:05] of Jesus Christ that you are not the
[1:53:07] perfect sinless blood but redeemed Pride
[1:53:10] of the Lord Jesus Christ I say I rebuke
[1:53:12] that in the name of Jesus you're loosed
[1:53:16] believe it believe you are him
[1:53:19] believe you are the word made manifest
[1:53:22] believe it
[1:53:23] [Applause]

[2:03:59] from a chicken to an eagle changed for
[2:04:04] being from a hybrid to an anointed son
[2:04:07] and daughter of God changed from kids

[2:05:34] we beheld his glory
[2:05:39] the glory
[2:05:41] as of the only begotten
[2:05:46] the prophet of God I'm not going to I've
[2:05:48] got so many quotes and things I can't
[2:05:49] get to them
[2:05:51] the prophet of God said the reason that
[2:05:53] the bridegroom had to be so plainly
[2:05:56] manifest
[2:05:58] is because the bride is coming as the
[2:06:02] Omega
[2:06:03] here's the alpha bridegroom and he is
[2:06:07] the Omega bride
[2:06:11] and the bridegroom was so plainly
[2:06:14] manifested that you would be able to
[2:06:18] look into the manifested word and say
[2:06:21] that is me
[2:06:26] he's the alpha he's the Omega
[2:06:31] he's the Masterpiece and you were taking
[2:06:34] out of this side through Redemption and
[2:06:38] he is now by his word created a
[2:06:41] masterpiece bride and has brought you
[2:06:44] back into perfect union with the word
[2:06:50] Alpha has become Omega
[2:06:53] you see who you are
[2:06:55] [Applause]
[2:07:00] I can feel I can I can feel that fear
[2:07:02] demon trying to come back on
[2:07:04] wait a minute you you mean
[2:07:07] you mean
[2:07:08] the bridegroom was made plain
[2:07:12] so I would be able to look at him
[2:07:16] and see me but you don't know my
[2:07:19] complexes you don't know my mistakes
[2:07:21] that's why I'm preaching to you a bloody
[2:07:23] pleading word
[2:07:24] [Applause]
[2:07:26] that's why I'm manifesting the blood
[2:07:28] that's why I am manifesting Calvary
[2:07:31] that's why he said if I be lifted up
[2:07:34] I'll draw oh man unto me
[2:07:36] [Applause]
[2:07:42] oh but brother Jonathan you just don't
[2:07:44] see whenever a time I look in the mirror
[2:07:46] I see all of my mistakes you're not
[2:07:48] looking through the blood
[2:07:50] [Applause]

[2:07:55] through your own ideas of it but you've

[2:08:20] got to come through Vindication and then

[2:08:27] you will say I am him everything he is I
[2:08:32] am he's my example he's my example and

[2:13:19] and delivered them so what is the word
[2:13:23] to do it is the glory of God shining
[2:13:27] upon you bringing healing body spirit
[2:13:30] and soul and delivering you oh yes sir
[2:13:35] the glory of God is risen upon thee
[2:13:42] you are God's miracles
[2:13:45] you are God's paradox
[2:13:49] greatest mystery to hit this Earth is
[2:13:52] how you in sin and the devil had you so
[2:13:57] bound but God under the power of His
[2:14:01] glory
[2:14:02] resurrected you freed you wash you and
[2:14:07] now you are spotless
[2:14:13] restart
[2:14:15] [Applause]
[2:14:21] you see
[2:14:24] you see Divine healings God's glory
[2:14:29] the testimonies that have been coming
[2:14:30] back
[2:14:33] you were this way
[2:14:35] but then the Lord came upon you
[2:14:37] and we've seen his glory
[2:14:40] and it changed you
[2:14:42] you were sick now you're healed
[2:14:45] what is it it is his glory that is risen
[2:14:49] upon thee
[2:14:51] the pillar of fire accompanies this
[2:14:55] message always
[2:15:01] all right I'm getting very close
[2:15:05] you see
[2:15:08] John
[2:15:09] in Revelations 5
[2:15:12] came to a book
[2:15:15] that it was a written word
[2:15:17] but had not been a manifested word yet
[2:15:21] you see the prophet of God said that as
[2:15:23] long as it's just in its written form
[2:15:27] anyone has a right to put their own
[2:15:29] interpretation
[2:15:34] I don't know if I don't know if I maybe
[2:15:36] I should reword that they don't have a
[2:15:37] right to it
[2:15:39] but they do it
[2:15:43] they come along and they begin to try to
[2:15:46] say well
[2:15:47] the days of Miracles have passed
[2:15:50] and they try to take you to their
[2:15:51] scriptures for it and they'll try to
[2:15:53] twist your mind
[2:15:55] and then they'll come right around and
[2:15:57] say well we don't believe in all of that
[2:15:58] emotion and that's all fanaticism and
[2:16:00] that's we got the word now we don't need
[2:16:02] all of that
[2:16:04] thank you
[2:16:08] see
[2:16:10] the problem is that so many are still
[2:16:12] trying to Rally around a close book
[2:16:17] [Applause]
[2:16:21] they're trying to make the word live
[2:16:24] under another age another anointing
[2:16:27] they're out of season
[2:16:33] you see the Pentecostal age was the
[2:16:36] shock
[2:16:38] but the prophet of God says that the
[2:16:41] tassel made a way or the stock made a
[2:16:45] way for the tassel
[2:16:46] and the tassel made a way for the shock
[2:16:50] and the shock made a way for the grain
[2:16:52] the Holy Ghost the word to be made
[2:16:55] manifest
[2:16:57] justification made a way for
[2:16:58] sanctification sanctification made a way
[2:17:01] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[2:17:03] the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way
[2:17:05] for the word to be made manifest it is
[2:17:09] fullness
[2:17:13] Revelations 10
[2:17:15] [Applause]
[2:17:17] malachiophore
[2:17:19] Luke 17 30.
[2:17:21] all of these scriptures accumulated
[2:17:24] together manifest the full word born
[2:17:28] into manifestation again in the last
[2:17:31] days
[2:17:34] we're not looking for a word to be made
[2:17:36] manifest we are under the anointed
[2:17:39] Vindicated word made manifest we are not
[2:17:43] waiting for the word to be born into
[2:17:45] manifestation we already are born into
[2:17:50] manifestation
[2:17:55] all right
[2:17:58] I got the quote so I can go there but I
[2:18:00] don't have time
[2:18:05] you see under the written word
[2:18:07] John was looking at a closed book and he
[2:18:11] you talk about depression
[2:18:13] you talk about spirits of Oppression
[2:18:15] being able to get to you
[2:18:19] when you're still looking at a closed
[2:18:20] book your subjects to you're subject to
[2:18:23] all kinds of doubt
[2:18:29] you're subject to all kinds of
[2:18:31] influences
[2:18:33] you're subject to all kinds of demonic
[2:18:36] lies
[2:18:40] and John wet
[2:18:44] because no one was Worthy
[2:18:47] no one was worthy to even to to even
[2:18:50] look upon the word
[2:18:53] this book of redemption a man he looked
[2:18:56] at that book of redemption and and all
[2:18:59] he had in his heart was sorrow and pity
[2:19:02] and woe is me and there's no hope and
[2:19:06] we're Beyond hope
[2:19:08] and we're just going to barely make it
[2:19:10] and I sure hope I make the Rapture but I
[2:19:13] don't know if I'm gonna make it
[2:19:16] I sure hope I'm going to miss the
[2:19:17] tribulation maybe the blood isn't for me
[2:19:20] baby baby the blood's not powerful
[2:19:22] enough for me
[2:19:25] come on you know I'm dealing with those
[2:19:28] same voices that attack your mind
[2:19:31] [Applause]
[2:19:35] Hallelujah
[2:19:37] but all the sudden there was an angel
[2:19:41] there was an angel with a message
[2:19:44] there was an angel with a declaration
[2:19:47] there was an angel that began to cry out
[2:19:50] don't weep John thy light has come
[2:19:55] don't weep John the lion of the tribe of
[2:19:58] Judah have prepared and His glory the
[2:20:03] glory the glory the glory of the Risen
[2:20:08] manifested sunlight is on thee
[2:20:13] don't weep don't worry you can't miss it
[2:20:17] you're predestinated
[2:20:21] your life is in the roots
[2:20:23] [Applause]
[2:20:26] you're a part of the sea Gene and this
[2:20:30] word is manifested the fruit
[2:20:33] [Applause]
[2:20:36] you are the fruit of the open book
[2:20:40] you can't be lost
[2:20:45] [Applause]
[2:20:46] [Music]
[2:20:52] thank you
[2:20:54] you are the fruit of this message
[2:20:58] teaching
[2:21:02] and the Dynamics
[2:21:04] that is the latter rain falling
[2:21:08] that is quickened that predestinated
[2:21:11] seed
[2:21:12] refuse this to allow you to believe that
[2:21:16] you are going to the tribulation
[2:21:18] refuses to allow you to believe that
[2:21:21] you're going to miss God you you are
[2:21:25] predestinated to see the manifestation
[2:21:28] of his presence
[2:21:31] [Applause]
[2:21:38] you know what I did
[2:21:40] when the line prevailed
[2:21:42] and that message began to go forth
[2:21:45] it changed the whole atmosphere
[2:21:47] just like it did in the garden when the
[2:21:50] whole world was in chaos and darkness
[2:21:52] and
[2:21:54] but all of a sudden the original spoken
[2:21:57] word is the original light
[2:22:01] and it began to clear out the darkness
[2:22:03] and it began to create an atmosphere of
[2:22:06] joy
[2:22:09] begin to create an atmosphere of life
[2:22:13] and now this risen this word this
[2:22:17] manifested word is now producing an
[2:22:20] atmosphere over John who is a type of
[2:22:23] the Bride of Jesus Christ and this
[2:22:25] atmosphere is changing from Doom and
[2:22:28] Gloom and darkness and fear and unbelief
[2:22:32] and tread and what if and what if and
[2:22:35] what if to an atmosphere of real Joy of
[2:22:39] real faith of real understanding they
[2:22:43] that know their God shall do great
[2:22:46] exploits they're coming under the
[2:22:48] revealing of the son of man and they're
[2:22:51] identifying that hey I can't miss it I
[2:22:54] am him I am the manifestation of his
[2:22:58] word I can take you to this written word
[2:23:00] and show you where I am I know my place
[2:23:04] in the scripture I'm a believer I'm
[2:23:07] anointed to make this word live
[2:23:13] when the lamb took the book Revelations
[2:23:16] 5 8-10 when he had taken the book The
[2:23:19] Four beasts and Four and Twenty Elders
[2:23:21] fell down before the lamb having every
[2:23:23] one of them Harps and golden vials full
[2:23:25] of odors which are the prayers of saints
[2:23:27] and they sang sang a new song saying
[2:23:30] Thou Art Worthy oh that sounds like last
[2:23:34] night that sounds like the previous nice
[2:23:37] that sounds like there's a revival going
[2:23:41] on I'll tell you what it is it's not an
[2:23:43] intellectual Revival it's a word Revival

[2:24:07] seals they're up for thou wrestling and
[2:24:11] the house redeemed us to God by thy
[2:24:14] blood out of every Kindred and tongue
[2:24:17] and people and nation and has made us
[2:24:19] unto our God Kings and Priests and we
[2:24:22] shall reign on the earth amen if you

[2:24:28] that everything and in heaven everything

[2:24:45] Revelation had come his light had come

[2:25:02] shadow of the king is in the camp it's
[2:25:05] the shadow of the blind lies being open
[2:25:08] it's the shelter of those that once were
[2:25:11] lost and now they are found it's the
[2:25:14] shelter of those that were in drugs but
[2:25:16] now they are set free it's the shelter
[2:25:19] of those that were under the death
[2:25:21] sentence death sentence and slavery of
[2:25:23] sin but now they are set free there's a
[2:25:26] shout of the anointed king in the camp

[2:25:35] King lamb worship time
[2:25:40] no no
[2:25:42] brother Ronnie shared this quote this
[2:25:44] morning it says when you walk through
[2:25:47] the blood of Jesus Yonder and God has
[2:25:50] cleansed your soul there'll be another
[2:25:52] dancing party take place the joy bells
[2:25:55] of heaven will leap up in your heart why

[2:26:23] you are his victory and dance is a
[2:26:27] victory it's a revelation but hey I'm
[2:26:31] going in the Rapture the word has found
[2:26:34] me the word has found me the word has
[2:26:37] found me it's the word age
[2:26:40] [Applause]
[2:26:41] I'm predestinated to this seventh under
[2:26:44] Revival I am predestinated to hear the
[2:26:48] voice of my shepherd I am predestinated
[2:26:53] thank you
[2:26:54] for my change let the musicians come
[2:26:59] can I share one more with you
[2:27:04] one time Elijah was feeling sorry for
[2:27:07] himself
[2:27:10] because he thought that he was the only
[2:27:12] one that believed
[2:27:17] the prophet of God in the fourth seal
[2:27:18] says Elijah never
[2:27:22] knew
[2:27:24] even one of them was that way
[2:27:28] he thought he was the only one saved
[2:27:31] are you ready
[2:27:33] until God opened one of the seals and
[2:27:36] showed him the mystery in the book that
[2:27:39] he had 700 that never bowed down to them
[2:27:42] Creeds that they had when God opened his
[2:27:45] book to Elijah said now wait a minute
[2:27:47] son I got 700 that's tucked around out
[2:27:50] there that's got their names on the book
[2:27:52] since the foundation of the world their
[2:27:55] mind
[2:27:56] the prophet says
[2:27:58] God opened the seals
[2:28:02] are you ready for it
[2:28:04] that's the reason I think John was doing
[2:28:07] a lot of shouting the other night he
[2:28:09] must have seen his name on there
[2:28:13] [Music]
[2:28:18] do you think God allowed the prophet to
[2:28:21] look beyond the curtain of time not just
[2:28:24] beyond in that in that era not just
[2:28:29] those bodies but maybe some bodies right
[2:28:32] here in 2023 that believe this message
[2:28:36] do you think that the angel of the Lord
[2:28:40] said let me show you a vision there's
[2:28:43] more to come there's more to come this
[2:28:46] is only the Sheep waving this is only
[2:28:49] the Declaration there's more Sons to
[2:28:53] come

[2:30:07] picture right now

[2:30:10] surrounding you
[2:30:14] we're not making this up

[2:30:24] is with you
[2:30:30] the pillar of heart never leaves this
[2:30:33] message
[2:30:36] and I hope I did a good enough job of
[2:30:39] saying it this way
[2:30:40] and you are the manifested word of the
[2:30:44] hour
[2:30:51] the alpha
[2:30:53] the alpha has become the Omega
[2:30:56] Jesus never went around trying to become
[2:30:59] the word
[2:31:01] Jesus never took the letter and said if
[2:31:04] I could only be that if I could only be
[2:31:06] that if I could only be that he was the
[2:31:09] word
[2:31:11] he was the sea Gene of God
[2:31:18] we are not trying to become the word
[2:31:25] we are not trying to if I could just
[2:31:29] believe it if I could just believe it
[2:31:33] whether you've got enough Faith right
[2:31:35] now to believe it now or not you are
[2:31:43] I didn't say it
[2:31:46] it is the revealing of the son of man

[2:31:51] responsibility over his own bride and he
[2:31:55] said I'll not lose one
[2:31:58] we are under the responsibility of the
[2:32:02] Vindicated sunlight of the hour he said
[2:32:04] I will have a harvest
[2:32:06] I will have a bride
[2:32:09] the prophet said how is she going to be
[2:32:11] there I don't know
[2:32:16] he said it's not up to me to know it's
[2:32:18] up to me to preach the word it's his
[2:32:21] responsibility
[2:32:26] [Music]

[2:32:36] know
