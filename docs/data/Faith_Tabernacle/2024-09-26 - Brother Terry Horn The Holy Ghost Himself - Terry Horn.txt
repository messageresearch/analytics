Bible class so I'll say to you good evening Bible class so um we appreciate the Lord thank you musicians it's good to be in the service of the Lord tonight God is so wonderful and brother Sean I stole one of your handker just down there I thought if he used it I'm going to use it anyway so just you know this we're going through treacherous times I I see what Israel's going through Israel you know the the brides promis to squeeze I think Israel is going through her squeeze right now this is this is the toughest time she's had since 1948 when she become you know a nation the five major Wars that she fought all of them supernaturally they she won by the grace of God but and she will win this one but uh we just pray for Israel can you hear okay yeah no can't you hear okay anyway all right but anyway we're going to uh talk tonight a little bit about a subject that um a message subject that's all I know I'm just a message preacher that's all I know to talk about is a message so that's what we're going to let's turn if we could to the Book of Luke and we'll read a little bit and let you be seated Luke chapter 21 and we'll start with verse 25 now this is Jesus speaking and let me take my coat off Jesus speaking now he's speaking to the people in his day of course but this scripture that we're reading actually is referring to our day and so we we always we really like to uh be updated on present day truth and speak about present day truth so that's what we're going to kind of talk about a little bit tonight Luke chap 21: 25 and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring men's Hearts fading them for fear see we begin to see you were talking about our day and for the looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great Glory now we absolutely know that that particular scripture verse 27 Luke 21:27 was fulfilled in our day the son of man came in a cloud with power that was what actually happened in 63 the cloud in Arizona that even brother Ram said there's our Lord up there so you know they had first Exodus you had the pillar of fire pillar of cloud second Exodus you had Pillar of Fire pillar of cloud Third Exodus Pillar of Fire pillar of cloud this is such a tremendous Ministry that God has given this day just like the first just like the second also the third verse 28 and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your Redemption draweth nigh now we know how close we are getting surely skip down to verse 31 so likewise so likewise ye when you see these things come to pass know you that the kingdom of God is n at hand that's what the whole message is is the getting a bride prepared being clothed with the word 32 verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass till all be fulfilled which generation not the generation J was Jesus speaking to but the generation that saw which saw actually see or saw the son of man being revealed that's a generation that won't pass away that's our generation amen this generation will be the witness of the son of man coming in a cloud verse 33 Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away verse 34 and and take heed to yourselves lest at any time you are now here's a challenge to all of us it really does the bride doesn't fall in this category however it's a challenge the leay out to seea she has fallen to this take heed to yourselves less than any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting drunkenness cares of life and so that that Day come upon you unawares you know what surfing means it's really strange surfing means the giddiness and he headache caused by excessive drinking surfing I mean you know just like brother B talks about you know arth of godfre knows you know America just ha haa that's just the spirit of America you know giddiness and you know that's that's surfing drunkenness you know actually drunkenness that that dulls your senses to the proper reality think about these words you're for minuted even the cares of this life that's anxieties and the consumption you know of of worldly pleasures and then of course unawares you know Revelations 3 I was thinking about that being unaware he said in Revelations 3:14 you're wretched miserable naked blind poor and don't even know it unaware they don't even know it yet they're blind amen verse 35 for as a snare shall come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth that the snare actually is unexpected un uh unexpected sudden trap that's a snare not on on them but not us 36 watch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be counted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man remember that's this day we're going to talk about the son of man the son of man Ministry prophecy of it what it means and parallel that with uh actually the Holy Ghost himself now I want you to turn let's read that again wherefore watch you therefore pray always that you might be cter worthy to escape all these things as shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man we'll find out who the son of man is and turn we to First Peter 1113 I'm going to read that one scripture all to be seated this is probably my favorite one of my favorites I'm all of them are favorite but I really have a favorite scripture 1 Peter 1113 I just love this scripture it's just it's so relevant to our day is it very seldom ever preached on but it's so relevant to our day and Peter says wherefore gir up the loin of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is future is when he wrote that Grace that is to be brought to you brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ now you understand Peter wrote this in .64 that was 30 something years after the Lord Jesus was crucified ascended so he's talking about when is when was or when is the revelation of Jesus Christ not at his day our day this is the son of man when the son of man is reveal so you see already the the the parallel there hey wherefore guard at the laws of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace now here's a really striking thought about that that Grace actually literally is translated as gift read it again G up the Lord with your mind be so and hope to the end for the gift that is be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ then my mind went back to acts 238 what do it say repent therefore How does it go repent Peter said to them repent be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remiss of sins and you shall receive the gift the gift of the Holy Ghost what is the gift of the Holy Ghost it's not tongues interpretation the gift of the Holy Ghost is eternal life the gift not the gifts the gift of the that's eternal life so the gift that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ and that's absolutely beautiful to me amen let's pray Lord Jesus such a small amount of scripture but such an array of of of depth Lord when we really could be begin to break it down we pray Lord you just give us understanding as what I'm going to try to bring by your help and give us understanding to the word Lord sanctify my thoughts Bless the people Lord that may we leave this place and say did not our hearts burn within us as he talked to us along the way we ask for your guidance Direction and Leadership and Bless the people we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and everybody says amen you can be seated and brother Daniel we sure are glad to see you back had a safe trip and all is well as I told them down there when I the trips that I made overseas I prayed two requests from the Lord Lord let me be a blessing to the people and don't let me get sick and by his grace he he honored that and and brother Daniel as far as I can understand the same blessing there he made it back without getting sick so that's just that's a that's a wonderful thing yes we're going to speak on tonight the Holy Ghost itself now we we taken that from the m Masterpiece brother B said the Masterpiece the Holy Ghost made way for the the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost itself so let's we're not going to do any foundation introduction we're going to jump right into the middle of it okay class okay notice brother man says in the Masterpiece notice here the life that was in the shook Now Catch these life life life the life that was in this in the husk in the stalk and in the tassel and the all gathers in the seed and the life that was in the St went one went to make the other justification made way for sanctification sanctification sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost itself yeah one 2 3 4 Holy Ghost itself he said made way for the Holy Ghost himself to come right down this listen what he's saying to come right down in Perfection back to the word again to manifest itself so he said the Holy Ghost itself has come to do what to bring to come right down in Perfection back to the word again to manifest itself so it's all focused the life is going to be back in the grain the life is back into the seed back into the grain why to manifest itself back into Perfection back to the word again so it's all back to the word the word you can't get away from that it's back to the word yeah imperfection now only in this age could you come Perfection this is age of adoption no other age this age the age of adoption then he goes on to say but what denom what but what denominated he's talking about the hus the stalk the tassel and so forth but what denominated died why do you think the prophet of God preached Souls that are now in prison why do you think the prophet of God preach indictment all of those carriers they were good for their day but after the life left those carriers they died but what what denominated dies like Luther like I'm sorry like life in Luther went to make Wesley and from Wesley it went to Pentecost and from Pentecost to make the original seed on to Pentecost came out of Wesley until that time the reason that Pentecost came out of Wesley is because it was no denomination at first we know that Pentecost was then Pentecost went to denominate and what did it do it turned to the husk it looked like the real thing but it was not the real thing so now we're talking about life the life the life the life the life transfer from the hook to the stall and down to the tassel on on out to the seed the life so we're talking about that life and that life of course is symbolic of eternal life and this is the adoption Age The Bride age the placing of the sun this is a time of full maturity of the Bride so that's why if if we talk about uh this it's titled the Holy Ghost itself or you could say the Holy Ghost himself really the same thing doesn't really matter he he used to use the term Holy Ghost itself but brother BR says it 16 or 18 times both ways himself itself same thing so if we just would to ask what we're going to be speaking about some of these questions is what is the Holy Ghost itself or himself what what is this life and uh what life actually dies and we talk about even the scripture talks about even so shall it be when the son of man is revealed and and who is the son of man who is this Mighty angel that descended in Revelation 10:1 and some of these things if we could just we know what they are but if we could just get a little bit clearer picture of it would help us to I think a little bit to tie some of this together especially for this thought tonight now we're talking about the life now don't miss it the whole spoken whole Focus now is is of this analogy that I'm talking about beginning is the life now the life L the left the husk it left the stalk it left the tassel and all that life gathers into the seed okay where seed time Harvest Time maturity time uh adoption time it all gathered into the sea but what happens to all the other carriers they were all carriers they all died once that life left they all died they had their they were good for their day but they died because they denominated and and he you know but the but the original scene every so we ask the question now what condition was that life in the original scene the life in the Original Seed was perfect absolutely perfect perfect pure absolute and all God's seeds are perfect I remember a a statement that brother bisco made years and probably 25 30 35 years ago he said and it always stuck with me he said God cannot father an imperfect seed simple statement but it's so true God cannot father an imperfect seed everything God fathers is perfect everything in his creation perfect everything outside of that is just a perversion of what is perfect or what was made perfect so say it again God cannot father imperfect seed now remember it's more important to believe what the word says you are than what you believe you are yourself so if the Original Seed is perfect and the life that was in that seed was perfect and all that life was passed through the hook the hus the stalk and the tassel back into the seed again then I ask you a simple question what is condition of the seed that's the life that's in the seed now it's got to be perfect the same life it's got to be perfect because it's God's perfect life he don't hybrid it man did that so God's perfect seed word life it has to be back to the original life now brother B says in the token message therefore as the listen to what he says therefore as the evening Shadows are appearing and the Wrath is ready to be poured out on high we know that's the truth upon the ungodly Nations and upon the ungod L unbelievers upon the professors without a profession upon these things and I've tried to unfold myself and live right among it to see what where it was standing before I said these things now this in the token message now we are living in the shadows and the Wrath is ready to strike buddy there's ever been a time we could certainly say Amen to that the Wrath is ready to strike really really today he said the Wrath is ready to strike and God is requiring a token that you yourself have received his token the Holy Ghost it's the only way and the only sign that God will ever pass he's talking about passing over when you see that sign because it is the it is the literal life and we're talking about life passing from all these different carriers back into the seat itself it is the literal life of Jesus Christ returned back into the believer it is the literal life of Jesus Christ returned back back into the believer I'm going to say it a third time it is the literal life what does literal mean literal the literal life of Jesus Christ returned back into the believer it's more important you to believe what the word says you are than what you think you are yourself Satan is not going to be happy with you getting a revelation of what this quote just said he's not happy with that but you get a revelation of it I get a revelation of it the pastor got to have a revelation of it all the bride must have a revelation of who she is that she is that spoken word seed bride that he for ordained chose predestinated put in the Lamb's Book of Life and so forth and so on like that's that that statement the literal life of Jesus returned back into the believer because it is the literal life of Jesus Christ returned back into the believer now you you just hold that as we go that's why brother Bam could say all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he p into the church the bride right Luther had a dip in the Holy Ghost Wesley had a dip in the Holy Ghost Pentecost the same had a dip in the Holy Ghost but the bride has the Holy Ghost himself now what does that mean let's go a little further see what does that really mean the Holy Ghost himself the person the man Christ in you the Christ is the word the full word made manifest for you by the new birth not just justification not just sanctification not just the baptism of Holy Ghost on your spirit realm but the Holy Ghost himself the person of the word himself there's only one person in the godhead that's Christ he's not a second person a third person he's the person he's a fullness of the godhead bodily he is God he's both God and man he's 100% man he's 100% God and you want to know really how important this is to have the the the true word birth let me read you this quote uh but you just they said boy they would they would tar and feather you right quick you listen what brother B said and Leadership 65 just a month before God took him home the choice of your conduct you could you can't mix it now you either for God or against God and the outward expression shows exactly what's on the inside the cucker now many of you think he said brother M said now many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven he said that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven no sir you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour of your life and still be lost and go to hell the Bible says so that's exactly right whoa you won't hear that anywhere outside of this message because we come to realize there's something beyond the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's true it was good for his time it's still good for I guess for whosoever will but for the bride got to come a little farther this is adoption this is full word time a little bit further down the road amen but see and another one the Rapture message brother man said you say 65 also you say I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost that don't mean that you're saved not by a long ways look at here you're a triome being you are the inside little fellow here is a soul and next is a spirit and the next is a body and you got five senses of the body that contact your Earthly home they don't contact the rest of the you got the five senses of the spirit here love conscience and so forth here in the soul is where you live that's what you are that's the real you that's what you are and you know it's just like exactly what brother Sean was preaching on Sunday morning the church has the authority as of Christ he the church has the authority of Christ he's given that to us he's given us that Authority through the new birth through a word birth through a invisible Union the bride with Christ manifested the same life that he did in this day in this hour the church has that same Authority as Christ you may not recognize it you may not know how to use it but you have it potentially it's there The Authority has been granted but remember much of it just like the spoken word is sovereignly given God only gives it as you have need of it amen Christ gave the church that Authority because it's his life In You by the new birth remember the prophet of God said your bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life what's the next three words she is him that's right now you hold on three those three words because we're going to parallel that with something else in a few minutes she is him amen now you know I are y'all you believe that I mean really you believe that you believe that I believe that she is him by the end of the service you're going to believe that I believe it I believe you believe it now but I want it to go from here all the way down to Revelation your heart I'm one of them I don't care if there's just one coming out of Virginia I'm one of them y'all better y'all better move cuz I'm going I mean that's that's the Revelation you got to have you got to have that Revelation amen so bone of his bone and flesh ofish flesh life of it life we talking about life earlier going from this the shook I mean from the the the the stalk the tassel sh and everything into the seed we're talking about that life she is him it's his life in you now let's look at this life his life in us from just a little bit different angle now we know that God's perfected in threes justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost water blood spirit I'm just going to list a few of them uh God above us God With Us and God in us outer Court inner Court holies of holies Eagle lamb blind father son Holy Ghost and on and on and on okay that's good and we believe that 100% God's perfecting in three but what about the number four yeah what about the number four where does that come in God's numerology is always perfect what is the number four okay the four is Deliverance now let's look at this just a minute baptism of Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost himself that's four three sons names son of man Son of God Son of David okay that's that's exactly those three but that's not but it's not complete yet right listen to this as we will know you know I'm just I'm covering some some some some thoughts here verification thoughts brother man said do God Chang his mind now Jesus came in three names son of man which is a prophet Son of God which went through the church ages son of David but in between the Son of God and son of man according to his own word and according to Malachi 4 and many scriptures he's to return back into his church in physical form in the people in human beings in the way of being a prophet in son of man so that's why you now have where has you know has been taught down to son of Son of Man Son of God Son of David but there's a little injection in here that God permitted the bride to put in there the prophet to put in there for the bride son of man Son of God Son of Man son of David yes amen four yeah according to Malachi 4 now I want to read something here now this this quote is just so tremendously it's it's it's intriguing brother man says in birth pains he makes a statement Now quickly notice she's in the stage Beyond this we know she's in the stage Beyond The Shadow doubt he talking about the birth pains where she's getting ready to deliver now her messenger talking about Malachi 4 her messenger is Promised in Malachi the 4th chapter he's promised to do it and the message is to bring back the word bring the people back to the word birth is to be she is to be delivered of a due birth according to Malachi 4 I'm reading it just like he said it she is to be delivered of a new birth Earth according to Malachi 4 I have read Malachi 4 14,25 times and there's not one word in Malachi 4 about a new birth we know what Malachi 4 is i s Elijah Prophet turn the heart of the fathers to the children children of Father lest I come and smite the Earth of the curse nothing there about a new birth but why is he saying that we Pro we are promised a new birth according to Malachi 4 there's an answer for that I know you want to hear this is so tremendous now these next quotes in the restoration of the brid tree uh I just love it I just love this he really explaining what I'm talking about now you know son of man Son of God Son of Man son of David and so forth and so on that fourth being injected in there now listen are you ready I love it now listen don't miss this now there's four death Messengers you talk about the p K four death measures or you would he said or would you rather just close amen there's four death there there was four four death Messengers that kill that tree we're talking about God's bride tree kill that tree is that right what was it Palmer worm Locust korm caterpillar is that right four messengers of Roman Devils Dogman kill that tree one took its fruit one took the bark or took his leaves one took the bark one took the life one took the life life is that right four message of dogas kill the tree all but the roots and if four Messengers kill the tree four messengers of Life restores the tree amen I'm going to have a time here I thought everything was in threes why is four four is Deliverance Fourth Man in fire four days Lazarus been in the grave four okay you see now you can see why the Masterpiece brother man said the Masterpiece the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way three made way for the Holy Ghost himself four our day adoption full maturity everything now let's stop here just for a minute but I want to you know what let me let me get this quoted here first he said do you get it amen for God said I will restore he's going to restore by how four death Messengers you killed it and then four life Meers Messengers will restor it what was at first Martin Luther justification what was the second John Wesley by sanctification what was the third Pentecost with the restoration of gifts and the Holy Ghost he said the restoration of the gifts the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost what was the fourth the word see there again he's going back to Pentecost justifications satification baptism Holy Ghost but there's one more what is it the word the word now now you see why the master and he said the Masterpiece that the the baptism the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost itself now we cannot go back to the anointing the Pentecostal anointing just the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your spirit realm with the restoration gifts that's incomplete as as we just read uh we we've got to have present day truth the fourth messenger of life to restore the bride tree back the word and we've read this quote before and you're familiar with it but I want to touch on it here but brother man said the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work this day now listen how he says it and listen what he says he said will not work this day no sir that was for Pentecost this is for the bride the going home of the Bride we got something different the Pentecostals represented that again now read the rest of it read all the quote there we're in the bride age no more than a word of Noah would work for these for the days of of Moses no more than Moses law would work in the time of Paul he tried to tell them you are dead to that you cannot have that okay now he also goes on to say in the brid Tre continue on with this thought there's four great prophets one of them Martin Luther now this is really really I just love this there's four great prophets Martin Luther began to shine a light now we know he's a reformer but he's calling them prophets you know it was a little light just a very small strength of justification long came Wesley stronger sanctification after Wesley was stronger than him Pentecostal the baptism of the Holy Ghost another great prophet see but it but in the last days of Malachi 4 Elijah is to come with the very word so he's he's just saying again trying to elaborate on that the word that fell on the Pentecost he said the Pentecost represented that again we've got something different he's trying to tell them you know that that that but in the last days of Malachi 4 Elijah is to come with the very word the word of the Lord came to a prophet and the even last it is to come forth and restore and bring back what turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the father's the fourth light you see when you really think about that when really think about what what did Malachi 4 say turn the heart of the fathers your children that was John the Baptist and the children back to the fathers the faith turn to Faith or the heart really speaking about the faith so our faith is turned back to the Pentecostal fathers not the the Manifest station of tongues interpretation of Prophecy and all the gifts like it was restored in Pentecost but return back to the faith they did have the faith they had Resurrection faith it was God living in them God above us now God in them they had the faith they had the faith so he said this fourth light messenger William brand might as well say it turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers of fourth light for is Deliverance again a little bit farther restoration of Bri tree four Killers took took it four Messengers destroyed it four messengers of death took it away in dogmas four messengers of righteousness restore it back again then he says prophesy then we get to Ezekiel 37 Dry Bones he says prophesy son of man can these bones live wish we had time we got it wrote down here but I have to miss that prophesy can these bones live what is the four stages of the coming forth of that church what was the four stages of e ezekiel's dry bones we don't have time to go through that but you go read the the three stages the senu the and the the bones the Senus and the skin so forth like that but there was no life in it then he said prophesy son of me that the wind would blow the fourth one the fourth one brought the life we're talking about the life the fourth one brought the life the life is only back in the seed now the carriers is dead the carriers has no life in them that's why that's why brother BR said I well I don't want to get ahead of myself but the life only come not when the senu skin was on them but when the wind blowed upon them that's when it come back that fourth messenger of life was brought it back I will restore sayith the Lord hallelujah Glory praise God Amen that's why the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost himself in Ezekiel 37 you don't have to turn to it in verse 8 it said and when I beheld lo the Senus and the flesh Came Upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in them the next verse says then said unto me prophesy unto the when prophesy son of man son of man Ezekiel now Ezekiel is a prophet and I don't and I've got it all wrote out but I do not have time to go to it but what the origin of the son of man how it got started son of man what what was referred to back in the early days Ezekiel is used probably more 80 85 times he was a that title was referred to him more than any of the other prophets and of course Jesus only referred to himself as son of man always I'm the son of man son of man of course he did you know the son of man he never said that it was Son of God the actually the only time Jesus ever really actually told who he was as brother R said was St John 4 the woman in the well said we we believe you know that the the Messiah is going to come and brother B said I am brother man said about Christ saying I am he that's the only time he ever devoted that he had he admitted he was that Messiah but other than that you know and that's one of the reasons that he used the son of man because son of man Man actually come well we won't we won't get in that cuz we don't have time for that but it's not really important what the origin of that son of man actually is and he says oh and he says prophesy unto the wind oh son of man and say to the wind thus sayith the Lord God come for the war Four Winds o breath and breathe upon these slain that ye may live what do we have in this day the revealing of the son of man the revealing of the son of man uh listen friends that's what a tremendous prophecy now not only is that Ezekiel 37 a prophecy of Israel to be restored if you go read Ezekiel 37 it's a total restorative Israel she'll be reborn again she'll rise up stand on her feet be a great Army so forth so on but brother man said that's also the rebirth and restoration of the brid tree uh in the evening time the bride tree being restored that's uh as he said most scriptures have a compound meeting it certainly does apply today because the brid tree has been restored goes on to say in the restoration of the brid tree the fourth light is to come that will bring the same signs watch justification brought back to pulpe sanctification brought back to Bar the doctrine of Holiness what brought back the Lea Pentecost what is it Pentecostal leaves claps their hands Joy rejoicing Pentecost what then the fourth the fourth the fourth was the word itself yes now we're talking about the Holy Ghost himself okay follow me now the Holy Ghost himself he said what was the fourth the word is self the word made flesh never never been a generation like we have today that that bride member uh uh redeemed saints of God is actually fleshing out this word if you want to say it that way the word being made flesh God's word manifested in your flesh amen oh man what what a day we're living in what a tremendous day we in living in the word itself say the word made flesh again in Bride tree first line justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost and then there again again he says then coming of the cap now we have a something a little to look at now after justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost then coming the cap now we can take time but we're not going to do it but go back to uh s what is the time Junior Jackson's dream took that crowbar uh pull that broke the top that mountain back you know and pulled off what was that white Gran he said light has never shown upon this writing before and you know we know we know the story there but he said now you got to go west get the interpretation of that Unwritten word that's you know that's written uh this the light is never shown upon before a different day a total different day we're living in amen Danny says then the coming cap what is it that Holy Ghost Bunch being honed out he talking about his bride members now that fourth light restoring back Christ in this bride what is that the Holy Ghost Bunch being honed out so that it can fit with the same kind of ministry he had when he went away right the same kind of ministry he had when he went away so the same Ministry he had when he went away is got to be in the bride when he come back we're not talking about everybody's got to preach the gospel and signs and wonders and raise the dead and explosion all like that he's talking about the word being made flesh in you whatever our your calling is that's the word me and flesh for you if you stay true to the present day truth that's that's fleshing out the word for this day living the life living the life the life his life the literal life living in you whatever your calling is comes back he said and he says what is it the Holy Ghost Bunch being H out so it can fit with the same kind of ministry he had when he went away that when he come back it'll catch the whole thing in a Rapture now what did brother man say was the Capstone Revelation what is the Capstone Revelation see the the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ he is God not a second person the person he's God himself God in flesh he's 100% God and he was 100% man the whole mystery of the New Testament who W who was who was that MDC why did Brother BR when he preach who is this mzc why didn't he say who was that mzc why did he say who is this mzc because that power of vend this life is for our day not back then Jesus Christ become mesic but that's the day that's the life for our day the power of an endless life it's all about eternal life now Capstone Revelation Supreme deity of Christ Christ is the Capstone The Headstone now you you you have to uh the bride has to be honed out with the same Ministry to fit that Capstone so these two must be one they can only be one one by a word birth and that fourth light came to blow that fourth wind into the bride so that now these are my words but I just wrote it down fourth wind into the bride so that those dry bones that were dead in denominational dog could stand up on her feet now the seals of death taken off of her those Dry Bones resurrected now the prophet adopted with a sword in his hand and the bride adopted with the son of man when the son of man put that sword word in her heart oh brother what a resurrection this is he said what a resurrection that was I he said what a resurrection this is there has been a resurrection in our day resurrected what how what was the reur Resurrection Day resurrected out of those dead denominational system Luther was good Wesley is good Pentecost was good but the once the life left that system he said when they denominated that's why they died now the life is in the Grain in the seed not in the shuck anymore not in the tassel anymore but in the seed in the seed that's where we are now he brother man said visible Union we know that the church could not the Pentecostal Church by no means by no means could carry out the last day message message in his present condition Congress says no it could not why why they can't even GRE on one or two words in the Bible how you going to do he can't do it see your denomination out that's right it's going to be it's going to be an elected people that's elected for it what did he say to church a book he said there got to be a special designated people amen a special designated people to receive that it's got to be a prophetic class of people now know and so do every one of us know that the whole listen now know and so do every one of us know that the whole rank of denominations Pentecost and all are dead that is to the born again Christian message of the born again Christian of the message uhhuh he said your first husband is dead I don't care if our first husband was the world if our first husband was a denomination it's dead you know it's dead God let it die God let it die then after you recognize the very word of God was Eagle food then oh I just love it then when you recognize the word of God was Eagle food then you left the other thing you have then been formed into the living image of the Living God you heard from your that word body you heard from your theophany when you received that listen to it believed it caught that Revelation you heard from your theophany invisible Union again and we read this but I've got to cover this and go a little bit farther you're standing completely never sin in the first place how many believe that amen did you ever did you ever sin did you ever sin in this life sure you did but he said you never sin in the first place and I asked you the question where was the first place right he said you never stand in the first place did Adam ever sin in the first place before the garden of before the Fall In the Garden of Eden the first place was that eden-like condition or that Eden condition before sin ever come to the picture that's before even the foundation world when our names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life amen that was the first place you didn't sin before the foundation of the world you didn't sin when God saw you as a perfect redeemed Son of God you only came down this life you bypass your copy come down this life to be tested tried put through all this and this pest house that we live in yes we've sin we've made mistake done all kinds of things like that but God does not as brother CH said Son blessed is a man whom God does not reckon sin read first John again a man that's born of God cannot sin because his seed remaineth in him for he cannot sin why why can't he sin because God's seed lays in that man continually forever amen it was dormant for years but now it's come to life amen oh I just love it yes Glory praise the Lord oh you're just completely you never he said you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you are predestinated to be a son or daughter of God you're standing here washed and your old book of divorcement is put away it's dead absolutely out of the existence even in the mind of God you're The Virtuous bride of Christ washed in the blood of Christ precious ver you know there's not there's not a piece of poetry anywhere is as beautiful as this invisible Union there's not a poetry there's not there's nothing that's as beautiful as this quotation out of visible Union it's not written anywhere you're The Virtuous bride of Christ washed in the blood of Christ precious virtuous sinless Son of God standing with a pure unadulterated bride word God gave him such inspiration to speak them words I could just Lord I just love you Washed by the Water of his own blood that become flesh and manifested that he take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same that he was he was that great attribute of God Called Love Now next qu the next quote is one of the most favorite quotes in this whole message bridegroom tree and bride tree taking out restoration bride tree but watch he Christ was God's perfect Prophet tree the example tree remember Christ was a prophet but he was a god prophet he was God's perfect Prophet tree the example tree the bridegroom tree amen glory I'm going to say something directly he says it right now if he is a bridegroom tree you believe it from the Garden of Eden then the bridegroom tree without the female don't bear [Music] fruit I just love it I just love it the bridegroom tree without the female don't bear fruit that's right what did what what's since the fall God's desire was to be able to even back in the beginning multiply and replenish the Earth spoken word children spoken word children spoken word children not through sex spoken word children God wanted God had a created Son of God Adam he wanted to Adam to replenish the Earth and be more Sons like Adam more Sons like Adam daughters like Adam's nature was he was both masculine f femish so for spoken word children so the bridegroom tree without the bride tree cannot produce fruit you believe that from the Garden of Eden then the bridegroom tree without the female don't bear fruit so he he's got to have a brid tree that's right he's got to have a brid tree see God don't need me God needs you he's got to have a brid tree tree the bridegroom tree without the brid tree cannot produce fruit how is God going to reproduce himself without a bride without a female to to to to to bring The Offspring of bringing sons of God it's got to be a brid tree to have Union with a bridegroom tree so he's got to have a brid tree she's got to be listen what she's got to be she's got to be born of the same material that's why we're talking about baptism of the the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost himself what is it what is the token the literal life of Jesus Christ back in the Bri believer himself got to be born of the same material the word made flesh from the tree said I hope you get it I hope you get it from the tree I hope you get it see the same life remember we talked about it in the beginning the life in the the the the hus the shook the tassel so forth now is in the seed he said that but it was all correct life it was all correct life going through those those carriers but it that original life is now in the seed he said that same life is in the female tree the bridegroom as it is in the bride The Works that I do so you do so you do also is that right he was a bridegroom oh man we can just stop right here say thank you God I'm glad there was a bridegroom tree I'm glad there's a bride tree I'm part of it the union of the bridegroom tree with the bridegroom is going to bring produce fruit amen so you see the brid tree is born of the same material it's a word made flesh and she has the same life as he has therefore she is him she's got to be born of the same material made of the the same material that he is that's why the prophet God said say in the M spe she is him she's word of his word bone of his bone word of his word life of his life she is him that's what's the matter today going on saying Be not Afraid 2 Psalm 63 we just just take them in a confession instead of taking them on to receive Christ till they're born of the spirit of God that's what we need today is them all night meetings not just saying I believe in all of our things we do I believe in shouting believe in speaking tongues I believe in interpretation tongues I believe in Divine I believe in all those things but yet it's something he said it's something yet it's something better than that it's a birth itself it's the Holy Ghost itself coming in us the Holy Ghost itself coming in US not just the manifestation not just the sensation not just all these wonderful things it was all good back in Pentecost but he said that's we got something better than that it's a birth it's the Holy Ghost itself coming in us hallelujah to God Amen ain't nobody tired yet of there I've just got just a little bit more yeah I'm not going to say I'm closing so just forget it I'm not going to say I'm closing CU my wife she I just can't stand the preacher get up there and say I'm going to be closing I'm closing I'm closing I'm closing I'm closing 30 minutes later I'm closing I ain't going to say it the Holy Ghost itself coming in us the fullness of the deity of Christ is here another thing he said the son of man the Holy Ghost itself what did he do for us in our generation John was told up to come up higher representing the bride we all in Le Osa we steeped in Den ninal he and or just was just plain loss one or the other no wonder the prophet could say what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is amen and this time he came down to lift us up God came down to lift us up yeah let me just uh this is this is really interesting because I want to bring this to you he came you know John was told to come up higher so we have to come up higher we have to even come up higher than even when we were obviously back in the world but even coming out of denomination we got to come up higher because we have to be made of the same material that he was so we got to come up higher so I like this analogy here and elzar found Isaac a bride but it was Isaac who took the lovely Brecker into the tent to fulfill and consumate the marriage relationship now our marriage with the Lord Jesus uh gave us a resurrection so it gave us new life amen there had to be an invisible usion with our mate the reveal word we had a resurrection resurrected out out of those dead denominations like any Resurrection there got to be a death first but by having received the seed genene from God God put that seed in our heart it was dormant for years but he placed that there we were born with it put it in there really from the foundation where we was born with it but yet it was dormant for all these years but our marriage to the Lord Jesus Christ uh um the status of this bride certainly we needed to be elevated even we was back in in denomination we needed to be elevated so what did he do so look at listen to this here's some types in the Bible now you take the Harlot Rahab she was was married to a Jewish General by the name of Salon okay the Harlot Rahab they had a son his name was Boaz now what happened Rahab actually she got elevated because she married this uh Jewish General okay you take Ruth a moabit the descendant of lot she married Boaz she was elevated you take Gomer the Harlot and she married the prophet Hosea she was elevated you take zavor zapor even an Egyptian she married the prophet Moses was a concubine wife but still you know and tried to have a God said go ahead have but it wasn't his perfect will so all of these women they they were elevated because they were married to this special person amen and we were of less agree and we needed the same status we needed our status to be changed and elevated brother I like this in Titus going to read that and then we'll go on to something else just in a minute in Titus 3 and three uh it's really good said for we ourselves were this what we used to be before for we ourselves were sometimes foolish disobedient deceiving serving diverse lust Pleasures living in Malice and envy hateful and hating one another but after that kindness and love of God our savior toward man appeared not by works of righteous which we have done but according to his Mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost Paul says and I I'm going to read this out of the emphatic diaglog when you really read some of these words here we were foolish disobedient deceived serving divver lust Pleasures living in Pleasures living in Malice and envy hateful and hating one another that's what we were yeah that's what he said yeah if you read it at the original Greek it says we for we ourselves also were formerly senseless we were senseless that's the original Greek we were disobedient we were airing being in bond to various inordinate desires and Pleasures living in Malice and envy detestable and hating each other boy we was in bad shape we needed to come up higher we really needed to come up higher but you know God made a way that we could come up higher oh what a tremendous truth brother bam after the seal was open he said my minute listen we got to we going to find a place to wind down my Ministry on Earth is to declare that he is here he is here now I'm going to parallel this with that other three words in just a second we have the return of the pill of fire 1950 the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost himself just pass him some thoughts here the son of man has been revealed the son of man revealing a son of man revealing the son of man these are all familiar to though brother man says he's my Ministry is to clothe the bride with the word there had to be an adoption of the Prophet the first sheave like listen to this I I just love this nothing happens by by coincidence like in Transfiguration Jesus was adop adopted there a cloud appeared three Witnesses Peter James and John okay realize brother R was adopted too out in two son 1963 during that same time a sword came in his hand three three Witnesses were out there brother random and two other persons you ever thought about that what their name are Jean Norman Fred sofman remember this is a son of man Ministry son of man Ministry what's the last name of both of those Brothers Jean Norman Norman n o r m an Fred sof man now you say that's coincidental I don't say that's coincidental three Witnesses just like when he was adopted just like when Jesus adopted three was a witness there you had brother brandom which was even brother Brand's own name branam Ham means father of Nations which he was a a spiritual father of this whole bride so to speak him Jean Norman Fred off man the son of man ministering this day the son of man appearing in a cloud a cloud Luke 21:27 it ain't by coincidence aren't you glad God is perfect in all that he does am now you say well what does that mean well it just means God's perfect his name his numbers is right his numerology is Right amen I don't think it's coincidence what else declaring that he is here declaring that he's here the indictment brother B said I indict this generation in the presence of the judge showing that he's here Isaiah 61 rise and shine and the glory of the Lord has risen upon thee remember brother man said God ain't going to show us share his glory with anybody that's true but you got to remember there's several types of Glory there is one Glory that God is sharing with his bride that is Oneness because he said he the only the only request that Jesus ever requested of himself he said I will that father that where I am there they might be also that's the only thing Jesus ever desired he asked of the father one thing that where I am there my people will be also so don't forget these three words he is here now he is here and I want to call your attention to the other words she is him remember now she is the matching piece to the Masterpiece okay we getting real close now brothers and sisters real close now these next few thoughts only scratch scratch the service but I hope it's helped us a little understand a little bit more about the Holy Ghost himself first Thessalonians 4:16 4:14 remember I'm talking about these two scriptures he is here she is him for if we believe that Jesus 1 Thessalonians 4:14 for if we believe that Jesus dies and rose again even so them also which sleep with Jesus God will bring with him know you're familiar with these scriptures but I hope you catch this I know you will for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the come to the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep now brother says hinder which it does mean hinder prevent or hinder but actually uh a more clear understanding was is that actually the rendering is in in no eyes shall precede so if you read it with that understanding reads this way uh that we which are alive and remain unto the come to the Lord shall shall in no wise uh precede them that which are asleep which prevent Hendry either one of them means the same thing but it's not we're not going to proceede those that are alive remain we not proceede those that that are to be resurrected and so verse 16 for this is just such a beautiful scripture and I got to thinking about this today we're talking about the Holy Ghost himself we're talking about Revelations 101 coming down now what is 1 Thessalonians 4:16 say the first verse for the Lord himself himself himself the Lord himself baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost himself for the Lord himself that makes it real definite and real personal shall descend from heaven with a shout what is a shout the message going forth he is the word the message going forth he is the word with the voice of the AR Archangel and the Trump of God and dead in Christ shall ride first for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven that's a message thank God for that amen so that's why we see that for the Lord himself the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost himself who is who is the himself it's Christ the revealed word present day truth same thing as the son of man a son of man revealing the son of man what an hour that we're living in to seeing the complete revelation the veil is completely been taken off of Christ the whole book of Revelation the part that we need to understand has been revealed to us the rest of it to the Jews we don't really need to know that but that's fine we understand a lot of more than we ever did before but that's why we know that Revelations 101 the mighty Angel Christ that's fulfilled he came down himself that Mighty Angel Christ amen and brother man said now because it he is here he has come we can lay in the Pres in the presence of the sun to ripen we're talking about why the Holy Ghost himself why did the son of man why did he have to come in the fullness of the word why did he have to reveal himself why did he have to come down himself in the fullness of the word he didn't come in literal physical form we'll see that when we're caught up to beet him in the air but he came down in the fullness of the word amen that's why we can lay in the presence of the son the son of man Christ the word amen this message came to bring Sons and Daughters to full maturity that's why God has has even established an eden-like condition music musicians if they'll come I'll finish this up here while they're coming God established an eden-like condition you say well I want proof of that well just go back to the Colorado Storm it's very clear it a't that perfect he walked with God he was changed back to a young man again saw his young saw his wife young again there nature even obeyed him no fear in the animals the deer come right up to him with feet out of his hand he said he was walking in virgin Timber he kept his promise not to kill the game for other people and finally that burden lifted but he said he said speak to the storm speak to the winds and it obey you spoken word given permission to speak that word as we know the five manifestation of the spoken word he's given that permission but God put him in that eden-like condition there in that Colorado Storm just to show just to show us to show us that that has been restored back to us by the son of man by the Holy Ghost himself by re Revelation 10:1 that Covenant age will come down it's all been restored back so well that was only in the prophet yeah that's only in the Prophet The Prophet was the first mature Son of God he was waving of the sheep signifying what what does that signify more to come in the field just like him not him but the Christ that's in him oh brother don't you love him amen let's stand our feet I just stop right here here that good enough I told you I wasn't going to tell you I was going to stop but I've stopped amen the son of man justification made way for sanctification sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost himself the person the real person of Christ Revelations 101 1:7 101 27 amen you love him brother Sean come take the service Hallelujah we uh I just even even every time you hear message preached I don't care who preaches it should give us thank you Lord for this message thank you Lord for this message thank you Lord for letting me see this message we were we were deceived in denomination where would we be today thank you Lord for this message [Music] amen oh he became me that I might become him [Music] by aren't you glad for [Music] that so that I [Music] might oh oh he took my place so that I might in love [Music] be oh he became me that I might become what a privilege what an honor sing it again oh he do you believe that church that I might become him by Grace amen his full purpose being made known his full desire God's desire becoming made known through you and I oh he took my place so that I might through his love could take care oh he became me that I might become him by gra amen as they just play softly did you enjoy it tonight amen amen praise the Lord uh there's ever a time we we should be more sincere than ever ever before it's it's now we should ever take our calling and election with all seriousness and you know the the Lord told the prophet that he'd have to be more sincere hadd be more more sincere remember when he was had that binding of the snake and then he would he would loose it and then he would bind it again and the angel told him now you must be more sincere in church we we must be sincere let's lay aside every everything things that cloud our mind things that that just you know uh we're like a sponge we can just take in things and take in things but if we get too full we get too much of something then then we can't you know the sponge can only take so much and I I think that's the devil's plan is to get us to where we're we're taking in all this other stuff through technology and then when it comes forth for the word to come forth and God wants to but we can't it's hard for us to receive that because we're so full of everything else but church God didn't put us here on this Earth for us to live be happy go lucky and just to enjoy ourselves and entertainments and and things like that because we we know the curse of the age if I could say it the curse it's it's definitely a prophecy of the ages that men would become lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God so they become a sponge to the things of the world more than the sponge to God and the channels become clogged up and and God has waited all these years 6,000 years he's been waiting for this time right here he saved the best for the last this is it Church we're it God didn't put us in any other age he put us right here and we must take it sincere God took it seriously and we must take it seriously amen lay aside the things of the world lay aside those things even as Paul would say those things would so easily be such us can you say Amen the weight and sin and and so we we certainly we certainly believe it and if we are a a forward people then we believe it All We Believe It All We believe what God sent to Luther we believe what God sent to Wesley we believe what God sent to Pentecost and now we believe what God sent to us we believe it amen you uh how many believes in justification you believe in that you believe in sanctification how many believes in the nine spiritual gifts we believe in it all and we we have more of a balance we have a greater balance to justification than what Luther have that's right we have a greater balance to sanctification than what Wesley had we have a greater balance to the spiritual gifts than what Pentecost had and God put that balance so he could bring us to an adoption we're no longer children just running off ear on Limbs and all that but he's got us in complete control we know what the father wants of us amen and so uh I certainly thoroughly enjoyed it
