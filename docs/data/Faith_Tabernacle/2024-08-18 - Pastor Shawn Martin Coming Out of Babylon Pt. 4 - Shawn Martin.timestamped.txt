[26:52] heads Lord what a privilege it is to be
[26:54] living in this dark sinful age it's
[26:58] quite a paradox to even make that
[27:00] statement but we're thankful Lord that
[27:02] the prophet of God you permitted him to
[27:04] draw a little bit of light there just
[27:06] for the bride and in the evening time it
[27:09] shall be light and we know that there's
[27:11] darkness in the world and gross Darkness
[27:12] from the people and Lord we don't never
[27:15] want
[27:15] to uh dwell on the negative side because
[27:19] we have such a bright future and a
[27:21] promise and Escape out of this land but
[27:23] truly Lord we the reality of it is um
[27:27] it's all falling apart very very very
[27:29] rapidly and Lord It's just prophesied to
[27:32] be that way because this is Satan's
[27:34] kingdom this is his Zenith this is his
[27:36] time but Lord you said in all of that
[27:39] you would have a bride and we're so
[27:40] thankful to be part of it you called us
[27:42] ordained us to be thus predestinate us
[27:45] put our name there oh God how we thank
[27:47] you for this wonderful message every
[27:49] time we think about anything that's
[27:51] going on in the world we say thank God
[27:53] you send us a prophet Lord even because
[27:55] you even said in Malachi 4 that L you
[27:58] have to Smite this Earth with a curse
[27:59] you sent a prophet even for that reason
[28:02] oh God how we thank you and I pray for
[28:04] these requests brother Shay and his

[28:16] the need there we just ask that you
[28:17] undertake in the behalf and Lord we uh I
[28:21] know there's many needs signified by
[28:23] raised hands and pray you'll just anoint
[28:25] brother sha as he brings the morning
[28:27] message and
[28:28] Lord we may we feed on the word of God
[28:30] may it be a lamp into our feet and a
[28:32] light into our pathway and Lord may we
[28:35] even though we've been in the message
[28:36] many many years but Lord may it never
[28:39] become common or old or grow staled and
[28:42] may we never just take for granted these
[28:44] things but truly Lord it may be fresh
[28:46] manner all the time for us even though

[43:15] for those who would want to uh meet at
[43:17] sister Psy's and was going to just sing
[43:20] some songs and and uh for an hour or so

[43:28] little bit and so if you're wanting to
[43:30] go uh you're more than welcome to
[43:33] come and uh also we want to uh keep uh
[43:37] little shuile in our prayer and uh uh
[43:42] yesterday morning brother shmaya had U
[43:46] went up there
[43:48] to um feed the baby and notice a not uh
[43:54] be on
[43:55] his around his J his ear swollen a
[43:58] little bit and uh so he had uh made
[44:03] mention to the nurse and um nurse come
[44:07] in check the temperature and I think it
[44:09] was
[44:10] 101 or so and so um we had I'd went up
[44:15] there and prayed with the uh the baby
[44:20] and um so while we were there uh in the
[44:25] room the uh they come and draw
[44:28] blood and uh baby didn't cry at all uh
[44:33] through all that and but it's oxygen
[44:36] went all the way down just you know it
[44:38] supposed to be up 98 and went down to
[44:41] one and uh so it was a little concerning
[44:45] uh but after a little bit it got back up
[44:47] uh there to normal but wouldn't eat uh
[44:50] he he he wouldn't eat and um so this
[44:55] morning um um they say that the knot is
[44:59] still there the SW swelling is still
[45:01] there and its white blood cell count uh
[45:05] is up and so uh they were waiting to
[45:09] hear from the doctor so don't really
[45:11] know what's going on at this time but I
[45:14] know of course parents are really
[45:16] worried and um and um rightly so you
[45:21] know I mean it's just a normal thing but
[45:24] we want to really pray uh for the child
[45:28] and and that the Lord will just touch
[45:31] that baby and I believe he's going to
[45:34] and uh brother shemaya of course is sick
[45:38] and so I know that's got to be uh rough
[45:40] on him wanting to be there and uh but
[45:45] not able to at this point but the baby
[45:49] um weighs uh 5 lb 2 O I believe as of
[45:53] yesterday and so this is good and and um
[45:58] um he's they've moved him up from the
[46:02] the room that he was in or they call it
[46:04] pods the Pod that he was in to another
[46:08] uh area so it shows that he's improving
[46:11] in things and so we're really thankful
[46:13] to the Lord for that and uh so as we go
[46:16] into the word uh maybe we just pray and
[46:19] let's just pray for that baby that the
[46:22] Lord will just uh come by and touch uh
[46:26] touch the child and and uh just give Mom
[46:29] and Dad strength there so let's bow our
[46:32] heads

[46:42] to but you when the doctors say there's
[46:45] no hope or they don't understand or know
[46:48] what's going on Lord we know that you've
[46:50] got it all in
[46:52] control we realize that it's just a
[46:55] spirit a demon that is trying to afflict
[46:58] that child but Lord you did not give us
[47:03] the ability maybe to work in the medical
[47:05] field some do but Lord you have given us
[47:09] all the ability to lay hands on the sick
[47:12] and to cast out
[47:13] Devils father and we're just um asking
[47:18] that you would go to that area that room
[47:22] where that baby's laying father Lord as
[47:25] it can't help itself is just relying
[47:28] upon mom and dad and others Lord we're
[47:33] just your children relying upon you now

[48:45] to face the enemy oh Father we just
[48:48] humble ourselves before you now in Jesus
[48:52] Christ's name and the church says amen
[48:56] amen and
[48:58] amen Revelations the 17th
[49:03] chapter
[49:05] and we're going to start at the first
[49:10] verse and there came one of the Seven
[49:12] Angels which had the seven vows and
[49:15] talked with me saying unto me come
[49:18] hither and I will show unto thee the
[49:21] Judgment of um the great that sth
[49:25] upon many Waters
[49:28] with whom the kings of the Earth have
[49:30] committed fornication and the
[49:31] inhabitants of the Earth have been made
[49:34] drunk with the wine of her
[49:37] fornication so he carried me away in the
[49:40] spirit uh Into the Wilderness and I saw
[49:43] a woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast
[49:46] full of names of blasphemy having seven
[49:49] heads and 10 horns and the woman was
[49:52] arrayed in purple in scarlet color and
[49:55] decked with gold and pre ious stones and
[49:58] Pearls having a golden cup in her hand
[50:01] full of Abominations and filthiness of
[50:03] her
[50:04] fornication and upon her head forehead
[50:07] was a name written mystery Babylon the
[50:10] great the mother of harlots and
[50:14] Abominations of the earth amen then um
[50:19] Revelations the 18th chapter the fourth
[50:23] verse and I heard another voice from
[50:26] from Heaven saying come out of her my
[50:28] people that you be not partakers of her
[50:31] sins and that ye receive not of her
[50:35] plagues amen you can have your seats
[50:39] this
[50:40] morning and um it's certainly good to
[50:44] just to have everyone
[50:47] um um I know different ones have been
[50:50] sick and some may be still struggling in
[50:53] their bodies but um um we know the Lord
[50:57] is is the Healer amen and
[51:02] um I I want to just speak on this
[51:05] thought coming out of Babylon we've uh
[51:08] talked about it
[51:11] um and this is the the
[51:15] age that um God is calling us out of of
[51:20] of it and um and I thankful to be part
[51:23] of that that time I think think it's
[51:26] more than just uh uh going to a message
[51:30] church but the message must have a an
[51:33] impact it must have an influence over
[51:36] our lives in every aspect of it and um
[51:41] and so this this is what it's doing in
[51:44] this age one of the things that Babylon
[51:48] is known
[51:49] for uh and and I guess is still uh known
[51:53] for is is
[51:55] confusion uh so when God calls us out of
[51:58] Babylon he's calling us out of
[52:02] confusion and and this word confusion is
[52:05] a state of disorder a mixture of several
[52:10] things so um um God is not the author of
[52:15] confusion he is um uh everything that
[52:19] God does is
[52:20] original um if if it then that that was
[52:24] all the way from the beginning
[52:27] uh of time God is the original of
[52:30] creation and so Satan is the author of
[52:34] confusion he is the one that mixes
[52:37] things up he's the one that brings other
[52:40] things into the picture but when it
[52:43] comes to God he's original and this
[52:46] original means consisting or
[52:49] constituting the origin or the beginning
[52:53] and so uh God is the origin originator
[52:57] of what comes from him anything that
[53:00] comes from God he's the originator he
[53:03] does not copy things he does not
[53:05] impersonate things uh uh if God's going
[53:08] to do something it'll come from him he
[53:11] doesn't need to copy off of what anyone
[53:13] else does man copies off what God does
[53:17] Satan copies off what God does but God
[53:20] is the originator and he can be the
[53:23] originator because he's the only one
[53:25] that can create
[53:26] God is the Creator and so uh um so he's
[53:31] the originator and the word originator
[53:34] means the source or cause from which
[53:37] something arises so God is the source
[53:41] he's the originator so there is an
[53:43] original love there is an original uh
[53:47] godliness there is an original patience
[53:49] there's original Joy there is an
[53:52] original uh Church there is an original
[53:55] creation there is a a a a an original
[53:59] marriage there everything that that God
[54:02] does he it's an original thing and and
[54:06] so uh then then everything that Satan
[54:09] does just brings confusion because he is
[54:13] an
[54:14] impersonator uh and and and and to
[54:17] impersonate is to act like or look and
[54:21] and pretends to be like amen he's not
[54:24] really that but he he copies he's a
[54:28] pretender he's an impersonator and so
[54:31] remember it's it's Satan is the one that
[54:34] said I will be like the most high amen I
[54:37] will be like so so then then he's an
[54:40] impersonator he's wanting to copy not
[54:43] not just copy something he wants to copy
[54:46] God himself amen he wants to copy he
[54:49] wants to be God and so in in 2
[54:53] Thessalonians
[54:54] 2:4 uh uh Paul would talk about it and
[54:57] say he as God sth in the temple of God
[55:01] so he sits in the church showing himself
[55:04] that he is God Amen but he's not really
[55:08] God he's just an impersonator he's a
[55:11] copycat and and uh so uh we would call
[55:15] it a fake he's just um uh a knockoff
[55:20] right and and so uh so then then we see
[55:24] how uh there is a lot of confusion as to
[55:29] who is who what is what because um uh uh
[55:34] he wants to be like God and so he can he
[55:37] can get so close amen he has been
[55:40] working on this for so long to where
[55:43] he's come to a Perfection to where it's
[55:46] it's really hard to know the difference
[55:48] between if it's really God or if it's
[55:51] act actually Satan looking like God and
[55:54] and so uh now
[55:56] you know uh uh Satan is the worship
[56:00] person of the world today Satan is and
[56:04] the prophet said the people are ignorant
[56:07] of worshiping Satan but it's it's Satan
[56:11] impersonating himself as the church see
[56:14] the church see they worship Satan
[56:17] thinking that they're worshiping God
[56:20] through the church so so this is where
[56:24] we're at now Jesus already propes side
[56:26] of this day for he said that it would be
[56:29] so close so close that it would actually
[56:33] deceive the elect if it were possible
[56:37] but now it's not possible because the
[56:39] elect can know the difference and God
[56:42] would make sure she knew the difference
[56:45] amen by sending a message in this age
[56:49] now so it it would be so close so such a
[56:53] lookalike that you couldn't tell the
[56:55] difference you know um I used to uh uh I
[56:59] told you before I used to sell shoes and
[57:02] they were knockoffs you know they were
[57:03] Nikes or knockoff Nikes and and Adidas
[57:07] and you know and all these things you
[57:09] know and so you get people coming up and
[57:12] we sold them for 20 bucks you know and
[57:14] and so you you could if you went down to
[57:16] the and bought the real thing it'd be
[57:18] 300 200 bucks you know so they were just
[57:21] yeah I mean they were just beside
[57:23] themselves when they come up and saw
[57:24] these guys you know and uh they thought
[57:27] they were really real you know they
[57:28] thought they were Nikes you know and the
[57:31] only thing difference was the Nike
[57:33] instead of it you know having that swoop
[57:35] up it ours was down you know it had to
[57:38] swoop down you know and so they were so
[57:41] excited and they were calling friends
[57:43] Nikes for 20 bucks you know and of
[57:45] course I I couldn't sell them you know a
[57:48] Nike for 20 you know and and let him go
[57:51] home thinking they got Nike you know so
[57:53] I'd have to tell them look these ain't
[57:55] Nikes you know they they just look like
[57:57] Nikes you know but but it it it was just
[58:01] all it was just a little difference and
[58:03] most people didn't know the difference
[58:05] they they didn't know so they were so
[58:07] excited you know now this is just the
[58:09] truth I had some of them buying 20 pairs
[58:12] of shoes you know loading their their
[58:16] you know and uh but now when I told him
[58:19] it wasn't really Nike they really didn't
[58:21] care you know so I was thankful for that
[58:23] you know uh uh but but but you know in
[58:27] in the day that we're living in when it
[58:29] comes to religion it really makes the
[58:32] difference in in what you really have it
[58:35] it really makes the difference if you've
[58:37] got the goods or you don't if you got
[58:40] the genuine or you got the fake you you
[58:42] know what I'm saying and so so there is
[58:45] a a so much confusion and and if we're
[58:48] not careful people join the church and
[58:51] come into church thinking oh I got it I
[58:53] got the real thing and you know and if
[58:57] it God would send a prophet that would
[58:59] really be honest with us to tell us the
[59:02] difference whether we got the real thing
[59:04] or we didn't get the real thing and I
[59:07] I'm so glad that we've got parents we've
[59:08] got preachers we've got we've got lay
[59:11] members we've got people that'll
[59:13] actually tell someone whether it's the
[59:15] real thing or if it's not the real thing
[59:18] instead of just letting them go thinking
[59:19] they've got the real thing now we find
[59:23] that Satan comes as a teacher of the
[59:25] word he comes as a pastor he actually
[59:28] even comes as a prophet amen he comes as
[59:31] a deacon or as a trustee and in judas's
[59:35] case he he came as a Treasurer and uh
[59:39] following the message of the hour he
[59:42] comes as a lay member or a Sunday school
[59:45] teacher he comes as one who is wealthy
[59:48] um and got great personality and great
[59:51] influence and or he comes as one that is
[59:54] just pours job's turkey you know and uh
[59:58] has to lean against the wall to Goble
[59:59] you know uh uh they just so poor and and
[1:00:03] so but Satan comes in any way that he
[1:00:06] that he he wants to come and and this is
[1:00:10] why uh uh uh I think it was Peter or
[1:00:13] Paul talks about men uh uh crept in
[1:00:16] unaware among you uh be because it was
[1:00:20] so close you know and and and and and
[1:00:24] that was a deceptive age all the way
[1:00:26] down has been through deception but
[1:00:28] there's never been a deception like this
[1:00:30] age here amen Jesus never said about any
[1:00:33] age where it' be so close that it
[1:00:35] deceive the elect but this age right
[1:00:37] here can you say Amen now if if it
[1:00:40] wasn't that a deceptive age back then
[1:00:42] and even in Jesus's day look how close
[1:00:45] it was and look how deceiving it was and
[1:00:49] yet it wasn't the most deceptive age but
[1:00:51] when Jesus said one of you going to
[1:00:53] betray me and Judas is in the room not
[1:00:56] one of them looked at Judas and says I
[1:00:58] knew you were that one you know no no
[1:01:00] they all said is it me is it I is it I
[1:01:03] you know and and had no clue that the
[1:01:06] son of predition was sitting right there
[1:01:08] among them see it was deceptive but not
[1:01:11] as deceptive as this age that we're
[1:01:13] living in but notice how Paul would
[1:01:16] expose him he says see he opposes
[1:01:20] everybody say he opposeth see Satan
[1:01:23] opposes and exalteth himself above all
[1:01:26] that is called God or that is worshiped
[1:01:30] ain't that right now we we know that
[1:01:33] this man of sin is not going to be
[1:01:36] revealed it wasn't promised that he
[1:01:38] would be revealed except in this age
[1:01:41] there there would be a people that would
[1:01:43] actually be able to look at him and and
[1:01:46] say I know exactly who you are you you
[1:01:49] understand what I'm saying and so uh but
[1:01:52] his motives no matter what he comes in
[1:01:54] whether it's a teacher whether it's a
[1:01:56] musician or whether it's a uh uh uh uh
[1:01:59] lay member or whatever uh the spirit of
[1:02:02] him he comes in opposing and exalting
[1:02:06] himself above all that is called God or
[1:02:09] that is worship now brother brandom says
[1:02:12] now Lucifer thinks and exalts himself
[1:02:16] above the humble word of God's truth by
[1:02:20] the knowledge of the Revelation so he
[1:02:23] exalts himself above the revelation that
[1:02:26] God gives his people amen anything that
[1:02:29] God does anything that God shows himself
[1:02:32] to be amen and even even brother
[1:02:35] brandham says he Associates himself with
[1:02:37] the real thing amen see and so and and
[1:02:41] that's why he would tell us that the
[1:02:43] Baptist would not they're not deceiving
[1:02:45] amen the formal churches Catholic and
[1:02:48] that's not deceiving type amen we're so
[1:02:50] far beyond that that that's not the
[1:02:52] deceiving type and and and even even
[1:02:55] even the Pentecostals really they're not
[1:02:58] really a deceiving type look at them
[1:03:00] today they're they're so they're so
[1:03:02] entrenched in dead and formal and and
[1:03:05] all of that but it's up to the real
[1:03:08] thing can you say Amen now see so so we
[1:03:12] we're looking at this because God wants
[1:03:14] us to come out of confusion he's calling
[1:03:16] us out of this confusion Satan will
[1:03:19] never be able to agree with the full
[1:03:22] word of God he agrees with part of the
[1:03:25] word amen but he will not agree with the
[1:03:28] full word ain't that right see and so
[1:03:31] then then brother Bram would tell us
[1:03:33] then we need the full word of God we
[1:03:36] need the full word of God in this age
[1:03:40] ain't that right so now how can we tell
[1:03:43] the difference between what is false and
[1:03:45] what is true well brother brandham he he
[1:03:48] asked that qu how can you tell them how
[1:03:50] can you tell them apart he said give
[1:03:52] them the word test how how can you know
[1:03:54] it speak the word and see what they say
[1:03:56] about it if they don't believe the word
[1:03:59] they have no seed germ in them they are
[1:04:02] of the evil one and deceive you ain't
[1:04:04] that right so brother brandham says uh
[1:04:07] in another place he said the people
[1:04:09] exalt him they exalt him above all
[1:04:14] that's called God the authority of a
[1:04:17] denominational Church the peoples uh
[1:04:20] believing that denomination more than
[1:04:23] they believe God Amen so God can do
[1:04:25] something in in a way of miracle and if
[1:04:28] the if their denomination says that the
[1:04:30] days of Miracles are passed they won't
[1:04:32] won't even
[1:04:33] believe in in Miracles you you remember
[1:04:37] that brother brah talked about that man
[1:04:39] on the radio he got the gave the
[1:04:41] challenge that anyone that can prove a
[1:04:43] miracle I'll give you I'll give you
[1:04:44] $1,000 I think it was so brother
[1:04:46] brandham heard it and and he says all
[1:04:48] right he he says I'll take that thousand
[1:04:51] he said I'll I'll send it to the mission
[1:04:53] Fields you know he said I ain't going to
[1:04:54] let that man just just uh make his brag
[1:04:57] about it so he went and got uh four
[1:05:00] people four people that were sick and uh
[1:05:03] uh uh diagnosed medically and then uh
[1:05:06] medically proven to be healed and so he
[1:05:09] got four people and brought the doctors
[1:05:11] in there and that man looked at him and
[1:05:14] says I tell you what he said you cut
[1:05:16] that child up he said you you you cut
[1:05:18] her up and then then then work a miracle
[1:05:20] and I I'll I'll believe it and brother R
[1:05:23] said you're you're you're sick he said
[1:05:24] you're you're sick in the head you know
[1:05:27] any man that would want a girl a child
[1:05:29] to be cut up you know uh uh something
[1:05:31] wrong with that man well he didn't even
[1:05:33] pay the ,000 you know but uh uh but see
[1:05:37] that they'll believe their
[1:05:38] denominational Creed above the word of
[1:05:40] God which exalts Satan above all that's
[1:05:44] called God can you say Amen so anything
[1:05:47] that exalts itself above the word of God
[1:05:51] then you know that Satan at work right
[1:05:54] there see now see our coming out of has
[1:05:58] to do with more than just a physical
[1:06:00] change from one Church to another church
[1:06:02] from from one Doctrine to another
[1:06:05] Doctrine and and and going from one
[1:06:07] place to another and all that but it's
[1:06:09] actually coming out of the
[1:06:11] organizational system it's coming out
[1:06:14] it's cut doing away with from Creeds and
[1:06:18] dogmas and and ideology of man and and
[1:06:22] and and to that that really means to
[1:06:24] come out come out of the conf confusion
[1:06:26] see and in order to do that a man must
[1:06:29] first hear and then Believe the full
[1:06:34] word of God everybody say full word of
[1:06:37] God see full word of God and of course I
[1:06:41] I I be honest now we all know it that
[1:06:43] that no no no ages had the full word of
[1:06:46] God uh revealed uh uh uh like it has in
[1:06:50] this age Luther had part of the word
[1:06:53] Baptist had part of the word Ley and
[1:06:56] Pentecostal and and all these things
[1:06:58] they had part of the word but the full
[1:07:01] word was to be restored unto us to the
[1:07:04] ministry of Malachi 4 and the angel
[1:07:08] 7eventh angel of Revelations 10:7 which
[1:07:11] they both tied together the prophet of
[1:07:13] Malachi 4 is the seventh angel of
[1:07:17] Revelations 10:7 can you say amen and he
[1:07:20] wasn't to bring a new doctrine and a new
[1:07:24] idea a new Theory something that just
[1:07:26] would make us a little bit different
[1:07:27] from the rest of them amen uh uh you you
[1:07:31] that would be a David Kesh or that would
[1:07:33] be a Jim Jones or that would be whatever
[1:07:36] we're we're not just following something
[1:07:38] like that but this is the full
[1:07:39] restoration of the word of God the full
[1:07:43] word of God had been restored unto us do
[1:07:47] you believe that see now separation come
[1:07:51] out of her my people well in the Old
[1:07:54] Testament God ordained that there be a
[1:07:58] water of Separation a water of
[1:08:01] separation and and and in numbers 19
[1:08:05] and9 it it it says and a man that is
[1:08:07] clean Shall Gather up the ashes of the
[1:08:10] hepher and lay them up without the camp
[1:08:13] and and uh in a clean place you know
[1:08:16] outside the camp remember what Paul said
[1:08:18] let us go outside the camp and let us go
[1:08:21] unto him and bear his reproach see going
[1:08:25] out of the camp it must be laid them up
[1:08:28] without the camp in a in a clean place
[1:08:31] and it shall be kept for the
[1:08:33] congregation of the children of Israel
[1:08:35] for a water of
[1:08:38] separation and what was that water of
[1:08:40] Separation it is a purification for sin
[1:08:45] sin is unbelief ain't that right so so
[1:08:48] we don't have time to go into it today
[1:08:50] but but but the water of separation is
[1:08:54] is the type of of our water of
[1:08:57] Separation so the water of Separation in
[1:08:59] the Old Testament is a type of the water
[1:09:01] of our separation in this day which is
[1:09:05] the word can you say Amen the word of
[1:09:09] God the revealed word amen see and so in
[1:09:13] John 17 and6 Jesus said in his prayer
[1:09:18] they are not of the world they are not
[1:09:20] of the world even as I am not of the
[1:09:23] World San ify them separate them from uh
[1:09:29] uh them through thy what truth sanctify
[1:09:34] them separate them call them out they're
[1:09:37] not of this world I know they look like
[1:09:40] it and and and made they were born
[1:09:42] Sinners and and and born in sin and
[1:09:45] shaped in iniquity and and a lot of them
[1:09:47] are caught up in this denominational
[1:09:50] thing but the foundation of God stand
[1:09:52] assur the Lord knoweth them that are is
[1:09:56] they are not of the world see they
[1:09:59] belong to God ain't that right so now
[1:10:01] he's calling for a separation sanctify
[1:10:04] them and the only way this could happen
[1:10:07] is through thy truth and thy word is
[1:10:11] truth Thy word is truth ain't that right
[1:10:15] now Ephesians 5:25 husbands love your
[1:10:18] wives even as Christ also loved the
[1:10:21] church and gave himself for it that he
[1:10:24] might
[1:10:25] sanctify separate and cleanse it see
[1:10:29] with the washing of Water by the word
[1:10:34] that he might present it to himself a
[1:10:37] glorious church not having spot wrinkle
[1:10:41] or any such thing but that it should be
[1:10:43] holy and without blemish so then the
[1:10:47] word is a
[1:10:50] purification uh for sin for our sin for
[1:10:53] our unbelief ain't that right another
[1:10:56] another scripture uh just comes to mind
[1:10:58] where it John first John I believe he
[1:11:02] was manifested to take away our sins our
[1:11:06] unbelief can you say Amen now now notice
[1:11:11] uh uh so the prophet said see they took
[1:11:13] the ashes of the hepher and put them in
[1:11:16] the courts for use for a water of
[1:11:20] Separation to wash the unbeliever in the
[1:11:23] waters of separ ation for a purification
[1:11:27] for we are now washed everybody say we
[1:11:30] are washed we are washed who's that we
[1:11:33] the believer we are Washed by the Water
[1:11:37] of the word of God it washes us it
[1:11:41] separates us and that's why you can't be
[1:11:43] a you can't you can't be a Christian and
[1:11:46] still hang on to the world there is
[1:11:48] something that washes you but you it's
[1:11:51] not just out drinking and smoking and
[1:11:53] all that but it's it's clean in you from
[1:11:56] every unbelief of man every tradition
[1:11:59] every Doctrine every man-made thing can
[1:12:02] you say Amen see so so faith brother
[1:12:06] bran would quote the scripture Faith
[1:12:07] cometh by hearing hearing by the word of
[1:12:10] God that word hearing is understanding
[1:12:13] amen Faith cometh by understanding if
[1:12:16] you want in rapturing faith it takes an
[1:12:18] understanding of the
[1:12:19] message can you say Amen receiving it
[1:12:23] believing it and and brother BR say what
[1:12:25] it does it only separates us from our
[1:12:28] sin it it doesn't kill you the word
[1:12:30] doesn't kill you if if you're being
[1:12:33] killed by the word you're under a law
[1:12:36] amen of of Commandments if it's
[1:12:38] condemning you then then you're under a
[1:12:40] law but the word is really to be used to
[1:12:44] separate you from your sins and separate
[1:12:47] you from your unbelief that you can
[1:12:49] actually walk with God and have
[1:12:51] fellowship with him how many believes we
[1:12:53] can have fellowship with him we're we're
[1:12:55] not waiting to go to heaven to have
[1:12:57] Fellowship we're having fellowship with
[1:12:59] him by the separation of the word we've
[1:13:02] been cut out we we've been separated to
[1:13:05] go unto him and to have this
[1:13:09] Fellowship see so so you can understand
[1:13:13] why we need the word of God preached to
[1:13:16] us see more than speaking in tongues and
[1:13:19] interpretation of tongues more than
[1:13:21] singing and dancing and prophesying we
[1:13:25] we need the
[1:13:28] word do you believe that now brother
[1:13:31] Brandon in speaking to the Pentecostal
[1:13:33] said you twist your baptisms you twist
[1:13:36] your evidences and you make it fit some
[1:13:39] kind of a Creed instead of taking the
[1:13:41] word well let the word bear its own
[1:13:43] fruit let the word bear its own fruit
[1:13:46] see you you make some kind of a thing
[1:13:49] you got to do to bring you an Evidence
[1:13:51] of it and Satan everybody say Satan can
[1:13:55] interpret every evidence that you want
[1:13:57] to put forth sure he can he he certainly
[1:14:01] can see but he cannot produce the word
[1:14:06] that's one thing that burns him
[1:14:10] up he wants to be like God he's doing
[1:14:13] everything he can to impersonate to show
[1:14:16] that he is God but one thing that burns
[1:14:19] him up is he cannot impersonate the
[1:14:22] word he can't live that word word by
[1:14:25] word word by word word by word can you
[1:14:27] say Amen can't bring it the prophet said
[1:14:31] that's right
[1:14:33] see so the the devil could make us
[1:14:36] impersonate every
[1:14:38] gift you know brother Bram said he could
[1:14:40] go out here he can make us lay hands on
[1:14:42] the sick and they
[1:14:44] recover he can make us speak with
[1:14:47] tongues he can make us interpret tongues
[1:14:49] he can make us have wisdom and knowledge
[1:14:51] but that isn't What It Takes ain't that
[1:14:54] right amen then brother Brown says to
[1:14:57] know
[1:14:58] him to know him is
[1:15:02] life not to know the orders but to know
[1:15:05] him the
[1:15:06] person ain't that right now I found out
[1:15:10] long ago that speaking in
[1:15:12] tongues interpretation of tongues
[1:15:15] prophecy dreams and all these things it
[1:15:19] does not get you out of confusion
[1:15:22] amen that's right that's true
[1:15:26] a young lady I hope this is all right
[1:15:28] for me to tell this um but a young lady
[1:15:32] was presented the
[1:15:33] message and uh she's like oh y'all's a
[1:15:36] cult y'all's following a man you know
[1:15:40] and
[1:15:42] uh and so uh said I wouldn't no sir I
[1:15:46] wouldn't be part of that
[1:15:48] M and uh so she working somewhere and
[1:15:54] here in town and and
[1:15:57] uh a young man come in and I saw her and
[1:16:03] at the register and came over there and
[1:16:06] you
[1:16:07] know doter says I had a dream last night
[1:16:11] I've been wanting to know you know I
[1:16:14] didn't know what was about or who it was
[1:16:16] for but when I saw
[1:16:18] you I just knew it was for you so I
[1:16:22] began to tell this dream and and and and
[1:16:25] she was telling the dream to a uh well
[1:16:29] my daughter and uh it was so it was so
[1:16:34] way out there you know I mean you and
[1:16:38] and it it puzzled her cuz she she I mean
[1:16:41] it I don't know you know it was bad
[1:16:43] about you know this is how bad it was
[1:16:46] you know maybe an elephant up on the
[1:16:47] moon or something I don't know if that
[1:16:49] was a dream but but it was that bad you
[1:16:52] know and so uh uh and and so but but she
[1:16:58] had she was telling uh my daughter about
[1:17:01] it and she was so excited and she said
[1:17:04] man you know says I uh I uh it baffled
[1:17:09] me when when he told me that and told me
[1:17:11] it was for me and I didn't even
[1:17:14] understand the dream it was so out out
[1:17:16] far out fetched but if he said it was of
[1:17:18] the Lord then it's of the Lord and so
[1:17:22] she uh she said you know I've been
[1:17:23] thinking about this and pondering about
[1:17:25] this wondering what that dream meant and
[1:17:27] I come to figure it out I'm meant to go
[1:17:29] to Bible
[1:17:33] school so she now she's building her
[1:17:35] dreams for Bible school now you know now
[1:17:38] now I'm telling you now she thought we
[1:17:41] were a cult yeah following a man right
[1:17:44] and we got
[1:17:46] Vindication oh but here comes some guy
[1:17:50] with a dream that she didn't even know
[1:17:52] yeah and now she's going to build her
[1:17:55] whole
[1:17:56] life on a man's
[1:17:59] dream now that's how gullible people are
[1:18:02] in this age that's exactly right so
[1:18:05] close amen so so then speaking in
[1:18:09] tongues
[1:18:10] prophesying interpretation of tongues
[1:18:13] dreams does not get you out of
[1:18:18] confusion
[1:18:21] now gifts of the Spirit they're
[1:18:24] wonderful
[1:18:25] yeah and they're in the
[1:18:29] church but they are to be
[1:18:32] judged everybody say they are to be
[1:18:35] judged they are to be judged now if
[1:18:38] you've known the message long enough you
[1:18:41] know that there's a difference between a
[1:18:44] a prophet and a gift of Prophecy a gift
[1:18:47] of Prophecy has to be judged before the
[1:18:51] church can receive it yes ain't that
[1:18:54] right
[1:18:55] but the word of the Lord comes to a
[1:18:58] Vindicated prophet and that Prophet
[1:19:00] doesn't have to be judged he stands
[1:19:03] before no one brother BR said you never
[1:19:05] did see Isaiah standing before a group
[1:19:07] of men you never did see you know uh
[1:19:10] Moses or whatever uh uh Paul and and all
[1:19:13] the standing before a a a a group of men
[1:19:16] no one stands before that Vindicated
[1:19:19] prophet and judges
[1:19:21] him but when when it comes to a gift of
[1:19:25] discernment or a gift of Prophecy a
[1:19:27] dream a uh whatever it would be it has
[1:19:31] to be judged before it can be received
[1:19:35] by the
[1:19:37] church brother Ram said a man can send
[1:19:39] his soul to hell with a Divine gift but
[1:19:42] remember knowing him is life knowing
[1:19:47] Jesus Christ the person of Christ is
[1:19:50] life now now notice and I and I hope
[1:19:53] this all makes sense to you but but
[1:19:55] justification the prophet said
[1:19:57] justification made way for
[1:19:59] sanctification sanctification made way
[1:20:02] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:20:04] the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way
[1:20:07] for the Holy Ghost itself to come right
[1:20:11] down in Perfection back to the word
[1:20:14] again to manifest itself can you say
[1:20:17] Amen so those three stages the
[1:20:21] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:20:24] of the Holy Ghost amen brought forth the
[1:20:28] revealing of the son of
[1:20:30] man the word made manifest can you say
[1:20:33] man see so so the church had to go
[1:20:36] through these stages justification
[1:20:38] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[1:20:40] Ghost uh so that the son of man could be
[1:20:44] revealed do you believe that see well so
[1:20:48] does the individual the individual has
[1:20:51] to go through these stages you have to
[1:20:52] go through that you have to go through
[1:20:54] just justification sanctification the
[1:20:56] baptism of the holy spirit before the
[1:20:59] word can be made flesh in you amen amen
[1:21:04] now now watch and today before Jesus
[1:21:07] comes again the prophet says the full
[1:21:09] manifestation everybody say the full
[1:21:11] manifestation of the person of Jesus
[1:21:14] Christ is to be manifested in flesh and
[1:21:18] you say Amen the full manifestation of
[1:21:21] the person of Jesus Christ is to be made
[1:21:24] flesh or be manifested in flesh think of
[1:21:26] it Jesus said as it was in the days of
[1:21:29] Sodom so shall it be at the coming of
[1:21:31] the son of man when the son of man is
[1:21:33] being revealed what is revealed unfolded
[1:21:36] it's made known the secret has been
[1:21:39] brought forth revealed in the day that
[1:21:42] the son of man will be revealed the
[1:21:45] world will be in a Sodom condition see
[1:21:49] and to know him is life to know him
[1:21:55] can you say Amen now Jesus ain't in
[1:21:59] confusion he's calling us to come out of
[1:22:02] confusion unto him that we may know him
[1:22:05] the person the full word the revealed
[1:22:09] word for the
[1:22:13] hour now notice another quote brother
[1:22:16] Bram says the church will come through
[1:22:18] justification through Luther through
[1:22:20] sanctification through Wesley through
[1:22:22] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:22:23] Pentecostal
[1:22:25] and go right on into the Perfection of
[1:22:29] the son of man see when that when
[1:22:32] husband and wife how many is his
[1:22:34] wife amen you've gone from being bride
[1:22:37] to his wife the marriage is happening
[1:22:41] right
[1:22:42] now you're married to him the word can
[1:22:46] you say Amen married to him not married
[1:22:49] to a Creed not married to a Dogma you're
[1:22:51] you're out of all of that and you're
[1:22:53] married to him the word see see so
[1:22:57] husband and wife will be the selfsame
[1:23:01] persons God will be so manifested into
[1:23:05] his brightest church till they will be
[1:23:08] both be the same they are one everybody
[1:23:11] say they are one you can put it in a
[1:23:14] personal I am one with him now he says
[1:23:17] you see where we're at you see the age
[1:23:20] that we're living in can you say Amen
[1:23:24] see so now how do we know that it's him
[1:23:26] in us and it's not just a feeling it's
[1:23:30] not just an emotion it's not just some
[1:23:32] good time it's not just a good thought
[1:23:36] how do we know that we're not just being
[1:23:37] deceived about this well brother brandom
[1:23:40] said the word being manifested everybody
[1:23:42] say it with me the word being
[1:23:45] manifested is the evidence that it's
[1:23:48] right amen the word being manifested is
[1:23:52] the evidence that it's right see the
[1:23:55] word being
[1:23:57] manifested he said see but people never
[1:24:00] look to that they look to everything
[1:24:03] else instead of to the word they look
[1:24:07] for all kinds of feelings they look for
[1:24:09] emotions they look for manifestations of
[1:24:12] gifts but they don't look for the
[1:24:14] manifestation of the
[1:24:19] word
[1:24:21] hello people speaking tongues and still
[1:24:23] wearing their shorts women wearing their
[1:24:25] shorts people speaking in Tong women
[1:24:28] speaking in tongues prophesying and
[1:24:30] preaching the
[1:24:33] gospel and people will ignore that word
[1:24:37] they'll ignore the word and look at the
[1:24:39] manifestation of a gift amen and the
[1:24:43] gift could even be right amen the gift
[1:24:46] could be even
[1:24:48] accurate and you say
[1:24:50] Amen uh uh the one that had the uh the
[1:24:56] PTL that had the TV program Jim
[1:24:59] Baker you know when he got out of prison
[1:25:02] and stuff and of course everything fell
[1:25:03] apart but he he he come to an audience
[1:25:08] and it was just right after he' gotten
[1:25:10] out of out of prison
[1:25:12] but he uh was speaking before an
[1:25:15] audience and I was listening to him and
[1:25:17] he took that word and uh uh depart from
[1:25:21] me ye worker of iniquity I never knew
[1:25:23] you
[1:25:25] and so I thought that's going to be
[1:25:26] interesting and of course I wasn't even
[1:25:28] we weren't even in the message at the
[1:25:30] time but he he broke that word down new
[1:25:33] intimate I never had an intimate
[1:25:35] relationship with you I never you know
[1:25:39] uh I never CA you to
[1:25:41] conceive NE never planted my seed in
[1:25:44] you and I thought wow you know this is
[1:25:47] profound you know Jim Baker talking
[1:25:49] about this you know and he says you know
[1:25:52] and and he says this has really been
[1:25:54] made made clear to me known to me he
[1:25:56] says you know he says when we got to
[1:25:58] talking about the days of the PTL and
[1:26:01] things he said we would have I'd have a
[1:26:03] man come in and he said he could read he
[1:26:06] could tell you your whole life he could
[1:26:08] read everything about you tell you where
[1:26:10] you live tell you what's wrong with you
[1:26:12] tell you I mean read you like a book and
[1:26:15] go right outside and use the lord's name
[1:26:18] in Vin and smoke and cuss and he said
[1:26:22] that happens all the time
[1:26:26] it's not the
[1:26:28] gift it's the word amen can you say Amen
[1:26:33] see so they look to everything else
[1:26:35] instead of the word so brother BR says
[1:26:37] how will you know him he is when you see
[1:26:40] his nature his word being manifested and
[1:26:44] doing just exactly what it's always done
[1:26:47] then you know that's
[1:26:49] him that's why in a when a church gets
[1:26:52] formal and they say they've got God in
[1:26:55] it that's not God God's not in that
[1:27:01] church it's true if God started his
[1:27:04] Pentecostal Church on the day of
[1:27:07] Pentecost and look what them people done
[1:27:10] by him coming in them it so quickened
[1:27:15] them and then people just sit there on a
[1:27:17] Pew barely say Amen barely worship God
[1:27:20] barely they got so restricted in their
[1:27:23] worship that the people can't even be
[1:27:25] free to sneeze
[1:27:32] anymore so how will you know it's him he
[1:27:36] is when you see his nature his word
[1:27:39] being manifested and doing just exactly
[1:27:43] what it's always done then you know it's
[1:27:46] him you can't change
[1:27:50] him come on Church you can't change his
[1:27:53] way Hebrews 138 says you can't he's the
[1:27:57] same yesterday today today uh uh
[1:28:00] yesterday today and forever ain't that
[1:28:02] right so so then see this is the reason
[1:28:05] that God sent the prophet of Malachi for
[1:28:08] to us he came to introduce Jesus Christ
[1:28:12] the
[1:28:13] [Music]
[1:28:15] word such a
[1:28:17] deception as to wondering what's right
[1:28:20] who's right what's going on where is he
[1:28:23] this look looks like it's God this looks
[1:28:25] like it's of God this looks like it but
[1:28:28] that God would send a
[1:28:30] prophet right to introduce he's got the
[1:28:34] key to introduce to us Jesus
[1:28:39] Christ
[1:28:41] Lord if you believe the message you have
[1:28:43] to believe that John the Baptist was the
[1:28:46] key to Christ he was the key to knowing
[1:28:50] Christ ain't that right for his message
[1:28:54] introduced the
[1:28:56] Messiah it wasn't a a group of people it
[1:28:59] wasn't a denomination it wasn't a bunch
[1:29:01] of preachers there was a
[1:29:03] prophet and he came to introduce Christ
[1:29:07] to the people ain't that right now
[1:29:10] notice brother Brown said that same
[1:29:12] Spirit see Elijah spirit that that same
[1:29:15] spirit that was upon John the Baptist
[1:29:17] shall appear in the last days to bring
[1:29:20] the people back to the word without that
[1:29:23] prophet but you ain't coming back to the
[1:29:25] word no one will come back to that word
[1:29:28] without this message of the
[1:29:30] hour he was the anointed one to bring
[1:29:33] the people back to the word so that the
[1:29:36] bride will know her husband know her
[1:29:40] mate the revealed word so this bride
[1:29:44] isn't going to be
[1:29:46] deceived God sent a a a message to
[1:29:50] introduce to her Jesus Christ
[1:29:54] right that's right bring her out of this
[1:29:57] confusion bring her out of this mess you
[1:30:00] can't introduce people to a living
[1:30:03] Christ through a Pentecostal message you
[1:30:06] can't even introduce people to Jesus
[1:30:08] Christ by a Baptist message there's one
[1:30:12] that has the key to it to introduce
[1:30:14] Jesus Christ to this bride and that's
[1:30:17] the prophet of this age as John forun my
[1:30:21] first coming so shall your message forun
[1:30:23] my
[1:30:26] second you realize you can't even
[1:30:29] introduce people to Jesus Christ by the
[1:30:31] nine spiritual
[1:30:32] gifts if that me the case the
[1:30:34] Pentecostals would have had it they
[1:30:37] would have had the key and there had
[1:30:38] been no reason for Elijah the uh a
[1:30:41] prophet to come in this age it amazes me
[1:30:44] you know when I hear people within the
[1:30:47] message ring say we need to get the
[1:30:48] people to Christ before we get them to
[1:30:50] the message you can't get to Christ
[1:30:52] without knowing this
[1:30:54] message can you say amen amen if the
[1:30:58] prophet was to stand here and introduce
[1:31:00] Jesus Christ where was he going to
[1:31:02] introduce him at in The
[1:31:04] Bride Can you say Amen in the
[1:31:09] bride get the people to Christ before
[1:31:11] the message they don't understand the
[1:31:13] message then the message is
[1:31:16] Christ the message is Christ what is the
[1:31:19] message it's the shouten remember the
[1:31:22] Lord himself would descend with the
[1:31:24] Shout with the shout the shout comes
[1:31:26] from him yet it's the message of the
[1:31:29] hour why because that Prophet is
[1:31:32] Anointed of Jesus Christ amen to declare
[1:31:35] him and introduce him to the
[1:31:39] people that's true John the Baptist went
[1:31:42] out into the Wilderness Prophet said
[1:31:45] because he didn't want to get mixed up
[1:31:46] in all the traditions of the church he
[1:31:49] had an important job to do amen he was
[1:31:52] ordained of God to introduced the
[1:31:54] Messiah and notice the prophet said see
[1:31:57] he got away from all that mix up all
[1:32:00] that confusion one saying of this and
[1:32:02] one saying this and one saying this and
[1:32:04] one saying that he just got out of from
[1:32:06] all that confusion because he had a job
[1:32:09] to do and that was to introduce the
[1:32:11] Messiah and he had to be sure that he
[1:32:15] knew he was the
[1:32:17] one can you say amen he had to be sure
[1:32:22] of who the Messiah was
[1:32:24] see he couldn't take the denominations
[1:32:27] idea of it amen because the
[1:32:29] denominations did not know who he was he
[1:32:31] couldn't take just the lay member's idea
[1:32:33] of it because the lay member didn't know
[1:32:35] who he was he couldn't take a preacher's
[1:32:38] idea of it because the preacher didn't
[1:32:39] know who he was he was the one amen as a
[1:32:43] prophet ordained to let everybody know
[1:32:46] who that Messiah
[1:32:49] was do you believe it and did you
[1:32:52] realize the world would have not
[1:32:54] recognize Jesus if a prophet hadn't
[1:32:58] come you say oh that's nonsense well you
[1:33:02] you you take that up to God then yeah
[1:33:05] come on God winess sent a a prophet John
[1:33:08] the Baptist and give him a specific me
[1:33:11] Ministry to introduce Jesus
[1:33:15] Christ if the world was already going to
[1:33:18] see
[1:33:20] him can you say amen amen but it took it
[1:33:25] took a a prophet to stand there and
[1:33:28] thank God you could know now listen you
[1:33:32] can know who that Jesus Christ was the
[1:33:34] true word because he did not go to a
[1:33:37] denomination he did not go to some lay
[1:33:39] member he didn't go just to any old
[1:33:42] preacher he went to the
[1:33:44] prophet because the word always comes to
[1:33:47] a
[1:33:49] prophet and because it was John's
[1:33:52] mission to to uh uh introduce him to the
[1:33:55] people Behold the Lamb of
[1:34:00] God you believe
[1:34:02] that see so we find brother Bram says
[1:34:05] now we are told that in the last days
[1:34:08] that will repeat again there is going to
[1:34:10] be a message come forth that will
[1:34:12] introduce the Messiah to the
[1:34:15] people you believe that so this message
[1:34:18] is so different from the rest of them in
[1:34:20] the other ages this message is to enter
[1:34:23] roduce Jesus Christ Living the person
[1:34:28] Jesus Christ and you must have it in
[1:34:32] order for the elect not to be
[1:34:34] deceived so close that it would deceive
[1:34:36] the elect so
[1:34:38] close but God would send a Vindicated
[1:34:41] Prophet to introduce the real Messiah
[1:34:44] can you say
[1:34:46] amen amen he says see he says come forth
[1:34:50] a message that'll introduce the Messiah
[1:34:52] to the people and it'll be in such a way
[1:34:55] they'll stand dumbfounded like they did
[1:34:57] then but he promised it amen he says so
[1:35:01] how will the people that's believe in
[1:35:03] him know it unless they're constantly in
[1:35:04] the word to know what he is Daniel said
[1:35:07] the wise shall know but the foolish the
[1:35:09] unwise wouldn't know but they shall know
[1:35:11] their God ain't that right now I won't
[1:35:15] keep you just too much longer but
[1:35:17] brother Bram says the Bible is a living
[1:35:20] forto witness of Jesus Christ do you
[1:35:22] believe that see so as the Earth has
[1:35:25] growed into its fullness uh uh and also
[1:35:29] Vines grow into their fullness the day
[1:35:32] grows into its fullness well the Bible
[1:35:35] was manifested in its fullness in the
[1:35:38] person of Jesus Christ see he was the
[1:35:41] word of God revealed the whole Complete
[1:35:43] Book of redemption the Bible is God's
[1:35:46] word forthtelling the future events its
[1:35:49] Believers is commanded by its author to
[1:35:52] read and to believe every word of it not
[1:35:55] just part of it one word to disbelieve
[1:35:58] it you might as well quit trying until
[1:36:00] you believe that word see every word is
[1:36:03] absolutely a part of almighty God God
[1:36:06] made manifested wound into his word to
[1:36:09] show forth who he is and we are
[1:36:12] commanded as Believers to believe every
[1:36:15] word of it do you believe that and and
[1:36:19] and I can say this it it whatever
[1:36:21] whatever uh uh uh you're dealing in in
[1:36:25] your life whatever situation you've got
[1:36:27] to take the word to apply it don't just
[1:36:30] apply it when you come to church apply
[1:36:33] it when you're facing troubles apply it
[1:36:35] when bitterness is trying to come in uh
[1:36:37] apply it when doubt is trying to come in
[1:36:39] apply it when when unforgiveness is is
[1:36:42] trying to take over apply it when pride
[1:36:45] is trying to take over take that word
[1:36:47] and apply it then you're believing every
[1:36:50] word of it don't make excuses one ey
[1:36:56] OD every word is absolutely a part of
[1:36:59] almighty God God made manifest wound
[1:37:01] into his word to show forth who he is
[1:37:03] and we are commanded as Believers to
[1:37:05] believe every word of it and it's wrote
[1:37:07] by the author of God himself see there
[1:37:10] is no one nobody can add anything to it
[1:37:13] or take anything from it if you would it
[1:37:16] would be a freak body of God it would
[1:37:18] have maybe like six fingers in one hand
[1:37:20] and three arms and or something you know
[1:37:23] add to something take away something
[1:37:25] from it maybe an arm short one finger
[1:37:28] short it's the complete body of Jesus
[1:37:30] Christ and in Christ being the male the
[1:37:33] groom the bride is represented in him
[1:37:37] also and these two are one and when does
[1:37:41] it become manifested that they are one
[1:37:44] in this day that's right for at that day
[1:37:47] you'll know that I'm in the father and
[1:37:49] the father in me and I in you and you in
[1:37:51] me ain't that right brother Brown says
[1:37:53] what complete picture we've come to the
[1:37:55] complete
[1:37:57] picture see and the True Believers in
[1:38:00] this word who accept it that way believe
[1:38:02] it and with patience wait for its
[1:38:04] prophesied promises every one of them to
[1:38:07] be manifested in its age every believer
[1:38:11] has watched for it every believer that's
[1:38:13] been on the toes watching is the one
[1:38:16] that's it's been revealed to aren't you
[1:38:18] glad for that yes sir see so those who
[1:38:22] make up the the bride of Christ the wife
[1:38:26] of Jesus Christ in this day has come out
[1:38:30] of confusion got to come out of the
[1:38:32] confusion why because we've got to
[1:38:35] identify who he is this bride ain't
[1:38:38] confused on any promise he got confused
[1:38:40] on one promise that he's the same
[1:38:42] yesterday today and forever ain't that
[1:38:44] right but this bride is not confused on
[1:38:46] any promise of the word of
[1:38:49] God she's watching for it she's waiting
[1:38:52] for it
[1:38:54] you believe it and it's
[1:38:56] happening it's
[1:38:59] happening see now if you look at it the
[1:39:02] the Pentecostal age was a time of God
[1:39:05] restoring the gifts to the church that's
[1:39:08] was the Pentecostal age but there was so
[1:39:12] much confusion
[1:39:17] absolutely in
[1:39:19] it the Propet said it's because the
[1:39:21] people didn't know how to control the
[1:39:22] gifts
[1:39:25] so much confusion and and if you wasn't
[1:39:27] part of that that that type era of
[1:39:32] Pentecostal uh you really wouldn't
[1:39:36] know you know what was in it but if you
[1:39:40] could go on YouTube and kind of watch
[1:39:42] the uh what it's led to today in The
[1:39:46] charismatics Barking like
[1:39:49] dogs rolling on the floor and shaking
[1:39:53] and one of them you know one in a
[1:39:56] Revival I think it was the Brownsville
[1:39:58] Revival woman came up and said the
[1:40:00] spirit of the Lord told me I needed to
[1:40:01] bark like a dog or how like a wolf and
[1:40:04] she's like oh Lord you mean that you
[1:40:06] really I got to do that yeah you got to
[1:40:08] do that so here it goes
[1:40:10] oh a spirit of the
[1:40:14] Lord Spirit of the Lord if it hadn't
[1:40:17] been for a prophet we would have been
[1:40:18] caught up in that
[1:40:21] stuff we would have been justce
[1:40:30] confused but there's so much
[1:40:32] impersonation and and so it gives you
[1:40:34] the idea of why the importance of
[1:40:37] brother Brown standing against that
[1:40:39] spirit that was trying to take over the
[1:40:41] church that poor
[1:40:43] man you know when you really think of
[1:40:45] the pressure that brother Brandon was
[1:40:47] under what he had to go through how many
[1:40:49] knows Kenneth Hagen well you know he
[1:40:52] claims to be a Prophet too and someone
[1:40:56] sent me a a a a a uh meeting of brother
[1:41:01] brandham a full meeting now we only hear
[1:41:04] the we only hear him preaching brother
[1:41:06] brandham me uh
[1:41:08] preaching but there's actually
[1:41:10] recordings of the entire businessman's
[1:41:15] meeting and before brother brandham gets
[1:41:17] up they introduce Kenneth Hagen and
[1:41:21] Kenneth Hagen gets up and starts
[1:41:22] prophesying over the
[1:41:25] people and the people oh yes yes now
[1:41:29] brother bradon's got to come on behind
[1:41:31] this
[1:41:32] yeah so we just hear him preaching a
[1:41:35] sermon oh I and and I wished I knew what
[1:41:39] message he preached it was a it was a
[1:41:42] barn
[1:41:44] burner and yet he had to preach that
[1:41:48] Kenneth Hagen standing there sitting
[1:41:50] behind him claiming to be a prophet
[1:41:55] yeah pronouncing
[1:41:58] blessings and then here comes the true
[1:42:04] Prophet it makes you it just makes you
[1:42:06] thankful that brother brandham couldn't
[1:42:09] be
[1:42:10] bought that he couldn't be
[1:42:13] swayed he wouldn't turn to the left or
[1:42:15] to the
[1:42:16] right he didn't bother about popular
[1:42:19] opinion he didn't bother about hurting
[1:42:22] people he just had to speak the truth
[1:42:25] but what was he doing he was introducing
[1:42:28] not a me not an
[1:42:30] impersonality not a a a a another
[1:42:34] prophet he was introducing Jesus
[1:42:37] Christ we needed
[1:42:40] it so we wouldn't be
[1:42:44] confused
[1:42:45] right in Pentecostal there was so much
[1:42:48] impersonation that came with it and sad
[1:42:50] to say there still is imperson
[1:42:54] ations uh that
[1:42:57] that that are happening and and many of
[1:43:01] it was considered to be of God but it
[1:43:05] wasn't many acted upon
[1:43:08] impulse thinking it was God many of them
[1:43:11] acted on you know uh sensation
[1:43:14] feelings uh uh Impressions
[1:43:17] whatever and and so uh uh but that that
[1:43:21] doesn't mean it's the Lord you you can
[1:43:23] be impressed to do something but that
[1:43:25] don't mean it's the
[1:43:27] Lord and and so but then there was that
[1:43:31] genuine
[1:43:33] article but they they brought disorder
[1:43:37] to the church brother BR said it
[1:43:40] disorder confusion can you say Amen
[1:43:43] brother random actually called the
[1:43:45] Pentecostal meetings a modern confusion
[1:43:47] of
[1:43:49] Babylon a modern confusion of Babylon it
[1:43:52] it is so you know you know uh
[1:43:57] uh how many how many men have been
[1:44:01] prophesied over that they're called to
[1:44:03] preach and they ain't got a lick of
[1:44:05] calling in their life there ain't no
[1:44:08] anointing in it they just stand there
[1:44:09] and just
[1:44:10] talk there ain't anointing in it but
[1:44:13] because somebody
[1:44:16] prophesied or had a vision or had a
[1:44:19] dream that they're standing behind the
[1:44:21] pulpit
[1:44:23] you understand what I'm saying it even
[1:44:25] got so bad that they were rearranging
[1:44:29] marriages that's happened and it's
[1:44:31] happened in this
[1:44:34] message you talk to some up in Canada
[1:44:37] some guy claimed to be a prophet and he
[1:44:40] he split marriages because he saw that
[1:44:42] they weren't supposed to be
[1:44:45] together it's a mass of
[1:44:51] confusion can you say Amen am but see it
[1:44:55] it was a massive confusion because it
[1:44:57] didn't work according to what the Bible
[1:44:59] teaches now notice what the prophet said
[1:45:01] God never placed signs ahead of his word
[1:45:04] he said amen that's a scorcher God never
[1:45:07] placed signs ahead of his word they were
[1:45:10] added for proof of the word but the word
[1:45:13] come first to prove it Elijah said to
[1:45:16] the woman bake me a cake first then
[1:45:18] watch the miracle happen come to the
[1:45:20] word first then watch the miracle see
[1:45:23] the seed word itself is what the Holy
[1:45:26] Spirit
[1:45:27] energizes another place brother Brown
[1:45:29] said the leadership of God is follow the
[1:45:33] Vindicated word of the hour by the Holy
[1:45:36] Ghost oh I'm feeling led to do something
[1:45:38] let it be within the bounds of the
[1:45:40] Vindicated word of this hour oh I feel
[1:45:43] to prophesy it better be within the
[1:45:46] bounds of the of the Vindicated word for
[1:45:48] this
[1:45:50] hour can you say Amen say see we we're
[1:45:53] coming that's the leadership of God they
[1:45:56] that are Le they that are the sons of
[1:45:57] God are led by the spirit of God oh I
[1:46:00] feel that it will be within the bounds
[1:46:04] of the Vindicated word you're following
[1:46:06] the Vindicated word you can't be so
[1:46:08] outled or so led by the holy spirit that
[1:46:11] the Holy Spirit takes you from the
[1:46:13] Vindicated word of this age of the hour
[1:46:16] can you say Amen nope the more you're
[1:46:19] led by the Holy Ghost the more it takes
[1:46:21] you in submission to what the prophet
[1:46:23] said for this
[1:46:26] age you believe
[1:46:30] it now brother Braham said speaking in
[1:46:32] tongues is a gift of God but it's
[1:46:34] subject to what's on the floor at the
[1:46:35] first place now there Christian there's
[1:46:39] where you make your mistake he said now
[1:46:40] I don't know someone told me that Monday
[1:46:43] night or Tuesday night when I was
[1:46:44] preaching that somebody spoke in tongues
[1:46:46] while I was preaching it's a good thing
[1:46:47] I didn't hear it or I'd have stopped and
[1:46:49] called you right out called you out
[1:46:51] right there cuz you was out of
[1:46:53] order can you say Amen what's he doing
[1:46:56] now he's going to bring order into the
[1:46:59] church he's bringing order because we're
[1:47:02] he's taking us out of
[1:47:06] confusion is this okay see he don't
[1:47:09] speak he said see the Holy Spirit if I'm
[1:47:12] anointed of God speaking by the Holy
[1:47:13] Spirit he's speaking here he don't speak
[1:47:16] over here and over here and over here
[1:47:19] see it's a confusion the Bible says that
[1:47:21] Christian see so that's right we must
[1:47:23] get those things down in our heart
[1:47:26] everything has to come in its
[1:47:29] season amen do you love the Lord amen
[1:47:33] just a little bit more time and then
[1:47:35] I'll
[1:47:36] close coming out of Babylon coming out
[1:47:39] of
[1:47:40] confusion do you realize that that
[1:47:43] tongues and interpretation of tongues
[1:47:45] and
[1:47:46] prophecy it's a private
[1:47:51] Ministry go ahead that's right brother
[1:47:54] bradam say it's not an open ministry
[1:47:56] right as is the five-fold ministry amen
[1:47:59] ain't that right he said it's a Ministry
[1:48:03] to help the church but it isn't to be
[1:48:05] done in the main
[1:48:07] congregation he said it's the only way
[1:48:09] I'm going to tell you is to it's to be
[1:48:12] done so brother Bram he was pretty
[1:48:15] strict on that it's the only way it's to
[1:48:17] be
[1:48:20] done it should be done in a room a
[1:48:23] private room separate from the
[1:48:26] congregation then he says then whatever
[1:48:29] a brother speaks another brother gives
[1:48:31] the interpretation then let someone
[1:48:33] write down on paper what is
[1:48:36] said he says now we all know that the
[1:48:39] coming of the Lord is coming we're aware
[1:48:42] of that how many knows the Lord's coming
[1:48:44] if you don't know that you've been
[1:48:46] living in your
[1:48:49] closet the Lord is coming
[1:48:53] he says now see and and if brother
[1:48:55] Neville got up brother Neville being a
[1:48:58] preacher being a pastor being he's he's
[1:49:00] the part of that five-fold Ministry if
[1:49:03] brother Neville got up each night and
[1:49:05] said behold the Lord is coming behold
[1:49:07] the Lord is coming that would be all
[1:49:10] right see but he's saying that the
[1:49:14] pastor at the platform for he's got the
[1:49:17] word for
[1:49:18] that can you say Amen he's got the word
[1:49:21] for that and if he be a pastor a prophet
[1:49:24] to the church or a pastor rather he's to
[1:49:27] study the word of God and tell you
[1:49:30] what's written in the word of the Lord
[1:49:33] about the coming of the Lord and you
[1:49:36] warned by
[1:49:39] that ain't that right but a Ministry
[1:49:43] otherwise to the church which he
[1:49:45] wouldn't have any connection with is
[1:49:48] tongues interpretation of tongues which
[1:49:50] is prophecy or a prophet speaker see
[1:49:53] that's something that's not written in
[1:49:55] the word what's written in the word the
[1:49:59] pastor brother Neville you know what the
[1:50:01] five-fold minut he's to bring it see but
[1:50:04] what's not written in the word is what
[1:50:07] you're to tell him prophecy tongues yeah
[1:50:12] hello yeah now he's going to give us an
[1:50:16] example because he's not going to take
[1:50:18] us outside the
[1:50:20] word right so he gives us an example of
[1:50:24] what this kind of a Ministry
[1:50:25] interpretation of tongues tongues and
[1:50:28] and these things what it's for for ex
[1:50:31] instance tell brother wheeler thus
[1:50:33] sayith the Lord tomorrow in his sandpit
[1:50:36] not to go to it because there will be a
[1:50:38] truck turn over or something like that
[1:50:40] and it's got to be
[1:50:43] done
[1:50:45] hello see so he says when these people
[1:50:48] meet together in in a room see let them
[1:50:52] who have wisdom first come because you
[1:50:54] see if one speaks in tongues and gives
[1:50:56] an interpretation according to the
[1:50:57] scripture that cannot be received unless
[1:51:00] it be witnessed by two or three people
[1:51:03] two or three two or three more witnesses
[1:51:05] see has to witness that that they
[1:51:07] believe it to be the word of the Lord
[1:51:09] and that's to be done before brought
[1:51:11] before the whole
[1:51:14] church ain't that right now
[1:51:18] notice why is it because sometimes in
[1:51:23] these minor
[1:51:25] Ministries now Pentecost put them
[1:51:28] Ministries above the five-fold
[1:51:30] ministry anytime they wanted to speak in
[1:51:33] tongues anytime they wanted they just
[1:51:34] felt led to jump up they just jumped up
[1:51:36] whether the preacher was preaching or or
[1:51:39] whatever brother brandom says you know
[1:51:41] for someone to jump up and start
[1:51:43] speaking in tongues while the preacher
[1:51:44] is going on he said it'd be just as bad
[1:51:47] if if the if the song leader or someone
[1:51:49] else got up and started singing a song
[1:51:50] during the preaching
[1:51:52] as just as rude just as disorder
[1:51:56] confusion
[1:51:57] hello see so sometimes in these minor
[1:52:01] Ministries just like any other Ministry
[1:52:03] you get Spirits that's wrong they'll fly
[1:52:06] in there and we don't want that we don't
[1:52:09] want confusion amen we want these
[1:52:12] Ministries ready to be exposed if
[1:52:15] they're to be exposed because anything
[1:52:17] that is of god you don't worry about
[1:52:20] exposing it it'll stand the the test if
[1:52:23] it's of
[1:52:24] God so just like the pastor if somebody
[1:52:27] challenges him on the word he don't have
[1:52:30] to back up about it he knows exactly
[1:52:32] what he's talking about see come come on
[1:52:35] up here see and the and same as these
[1:52:38] other Ministries got to be the same way
[1:52:40] and if one speaks in tongues and gives a
[1:52:42] message see now people speak in tongues
[1:52:45] when they're just edifying themselves
[1:52:48] and the Bible says they're just having a
[1:52:49] good time they'll speak in tongues
[1:52:51] they'll feel see they they they do speak
[1:52:54] in tongues they actually speak with
[1:52:55] tongues and it's the spirit doing it but
[1:52:57] if it's sitting out there in the
[1:52:59] audience speaking in tongues just
[1:53:00] edifying themselves it isn't anything
[1:53:03] profitable for the church it's the man
[1:53:05] edifying himself or the woman or
[1:53:08] whoever's doing it ain't that right but
[1:53:10] to speak in tongues is a gift of God to
[1:53:14] edification as Paul says in the
[1:53:16] scripture that's to edify the church so
[1:53:19] it had to be some direct message from
[1:53:22] God to the church outside of what's
[1:53:25] wrote here in the
[1:53:28] Bible do you believe that it must be a
[1:53:32] direct message to the people of
[1:53:34] something that's fixing to take place or
[1:53:37] something they should
[1:53:42] do you love the Lord now I want to say
[1:53:45] he did not do away with speaking in
[1:53:48] tongues did not do away with the nine
[1:53:50] spiritual gifts amen
[1:53:52] did not do away with that can't show me
[1:53:55] in the Bible where he says it can't show
[1:53:57] me in the message where it says it Paul
[1:53:59] didn't take away from
[1:54:01] it brother brand said I preach what Paul
[1:54:04] preached ain't that right but what did
[1:54:07] he do he took the confusion out of
[1:54:11] [Music]
[1:54:13] it so he says now when you go into a
[1:54:15] meeting the first thing you do you go in
[1:54:18] there and you have a bunch of tongues
[1:54:19] and interpretations and somebody raised
[1:54:21] up and and keep quoting the scripture
[1:54:25] now that's
[1:54:26] carnal absolutely God said for us not to
[1:54:29] use vain repetitions well what about him
[1:54:32] then if he's wrote it once you believe
[1:54:36] it you understand what I'm saying if
[1:54:39] he's wrote it here believe it I'll go
[1:54:42] even as far as if God sent a Vindicated
[1:54:44] prophet and what he says you believe it
[1:54:47] you don't need some other uh Prophet to
[1:54:50] come on the scene just take what God
[1:54:55] Said ain't that right see so if he's
[1:54:59] wrote it once you believe it he don't
[1:55:02] have to say it
[1:55:05] again tongues and interpretations is
[1:55:08] right but it's to be a direct message to
[1:55:11] the church and to
[1:55:14] somebody another place it cannot be
[1:55:16] repeating scriptures he's already wrote
[1:55:18] that it must be a direct message to
[1:55:21] somebody yeah and then before it can be
[1:55:24] received then two or three Witnesses at
[1:55:27] least two out of three had to witness it
[1:55:29] was of God and then them Witnesses have
[1:55:32] to be
[1:55:34] proven can you say Amen so two or three
[1:55:38] two out of three Witnesses had had to
[1:55:40] witness it was of God or it wasn't
[1:55:42] received if they said it's of God they
[1:55:44] wrote it down they signed their name to
[1:55:45] it thus said the Lord tomorrow at 2:00
[1:55:48] tell brother Jones to move away from
[1:55:51] that railroad track there there's going
[1:55:52] to be a wreck out there and his house
[1:55:54] will be torn up in the wreck they wrote
[1:55:55] it down because they thought it was of
[1:55:57] God it's a direct
[1:55:59] message right and you say amen amen not
[1:56:03] the lord loves you the lord loves
[1:56:05] you now it's okay for a minister to say
[1:56:09] that because he's taking the word of God
[1:56:11] and he's showing you all through that
[1:56:13] that well brother Brandon said this is a
[1:56:14] love
[1:56:15] story it's love secrets you understand
[1:56:19] what I'm saying it's a love letter to
[1:56:20] you brother will so there's a pastor
[1:56:23] there's an evangelist there's a teacher
[1:56:25] of the fivefold ministry that takes this
[1:56:27] word and let you know just how much God
[1:56:29] loves
[1:56:30] you but you don't need somebody to
[1:56:32] prophesy over you and say oh God loves
[1:56:34] you God love that's vain reput just take
[1:56:36] the word of God and believe
[1:56:42] it that's all
[1:56:46] right well for some it is
[1:56:52] see what we're doing is we're anchoring
[1:56:54] our faith in the
[1:56:56] word that's right anchoring our faith in
[1:56:59] the
[1:57:00] word I remember when we was in the
[1:57:03] Pentecostal when we got discouraged we
[1:57:05] needed somebody to have a dream need
[1:57:07] someone to have a vision needed someone
[1:57:09] to prophesy so we'd start feeling better
[1:57:12] but what about when that prophesy ended
[1:57:15] if you can't take the word what makes
[1:57:16] you think you're going to believe
[1:57:18] that a word that's Vindicated a word
[1:57:21] that's being revealed healed then what
[1:57:23] makes you think you're going to take
[1:57:24] somebody else's
[1:57:25] word then you're going to wonder about
[1:57:28] them when that preacher
[1:57:29] Falls then you realize that preacher
[1:57:31] ain't preaching all the way
[1:57:34] right then how you going to ank yourself
[1:57:36] on that
[1:57:38] prophecy then you just go from church to
[1:57:40] church Revival to Revival prophecy to
[1:57:44] prophecy before you know it you become
[1:57:46] sign Seekers instead of just staying
[1:57:47] right with the word of God can you say
[1:57:50] Amen you love the Lord
[1:57:53] see so we believe what is written in the
[1:57:56] word now then God sends a direct message
[1:57:59] cuz we I can't tell you what's going to
[1:58:01] happen tomorrow I don't know if you're
[1:58:03] going to be in a wreck tomorrow but
[1:58:05] wouldn't have been something wouldn't it
[1:58:06] be something if God moves upon somebody
[1:58:09] in the
[1:58:10] congregation
[1:58:12] yes and begins to tell exactly what's
[1:58:15] going on and what's going to
[1:58:16] be I believe that happens
[1:58:22] that's just me
[1:58:24] amen and I believe it'll be so direct
[1:58:27] that it ain't going to be well God's
[1:58:28] going to bless you in the future yeah
[1:58:31] come
[1:58:32] on that's right you know what I mean
[1:58:36] amen lot of these prophecies that are
[1:58:38] going forth It's so it's so open that
[1:58:43] that you can't just sit there and judge
[1:58:45] and say all right let's see what time
[1:58:46] it's going to happen that's right but
[1:58:48] brother Bram said you should be so
[1:58:49] direct it should be so specific amen
[1:58:53] amen at such and such time this is going
[1:58:55] to happen don't be there well then we'll
[1:58:58] know if something something
[1:59:00] happen right one place brother BR said
[1:59:03] to prophecy go forth and tells a brother
[1:59:05] said don't be at your house because the
[1:59:06] tornado's coming at 2:00 something like
[1:59:09] that and said sure enough 2:00 here it
[1:59:12] comes totally destroys the
[1:59:15] home but then next service everybody's
[1:59:18] rejoicing because brother Jones is with
[1:59:19] them or brother so and so's with them
[1:59:22] and and God spared his life he said if
[1:59:24] it doesn't happen that way then you got
[1:59:27] a lie in spirit among
[1:59:29] you but anybody anybody can can tell you
[1:59:33] well brother Amos you got it you got it
[1:59:35] okay great well got what yeah got
[1:59:39] money got the
[1:59:42] chills amen chicken poie what well you
[1:59:46] know what do I got
[1:59:52] you love the
[1:59:53] Lord if the musicians will
[1:59:56] come so brother Bram says then after a
[1:59:58] while maybe a spirit of Prophecy come
[2:00:00] among them that wasn't in the main
[2:00:02] Auditorium where Sinners and things were
[2:00:05] setting that was in their own room the
[2:00:07] gifts operating then the first thing you
[2:00:09] know some prophecy hit one there's a lot
[2:00:12] of difference between a gift of Prophecy
[2:00:14] and a prophet see a gift of Prophecy may
[2:00:16] be on one tonight and never again and be
[2:00:19] on another the next night see it's them
[2:00:22] nine spiritual gifts that works in the
[2:00:23] body but a prophet is born to Prophet
[2:00:26] all down through Li their life it's thus
[2:00:28] sayith the Lord but a gift to prophecy
[2:00:30] has to be judged but you never seen
[2:00:32] anybody you know stand before Isaiah or
[2:00:35] Jeremiah to judge them no but the Bible
[2:00:37] says if one prophesies let two or three
[2:00:40] judge whether it's right or not see
[2:00:42] because Satan can slip in there then
[2:00:45] these discerners with the spirit of
[2:00:47] discernment then said you know thus said
[2:00:49] the Lord tonight there will be a woman
[2:00:50] see how direct it is there will be a
[2:00:52] woman coming from a certain place she'll
[2:00:54] have a green scarf over her head she'll
[2:00:56] be brought in she's from Ohio and have
[2:00:58] brother brandom to lay hands on her but
[2:01:00] first before doing that tell him to tell
[2:01:02] her that she was a Treasurer in a
[2:01:05] certain Church she stole money and
[2:01:06] that's the reason she's paralyzed you'll
[2:01:08] make that right and God will heal her
[2:01:11] see discerner raise up and say well
[2:01:13] that's that's of God another one says I
[2:01:15] believe that's of God see so all right
[2:01:18] they they put that message down then
[2:01:20] when it come to the platform a little
[2:01:22] buzzer rang from my study I walked out
[2:01:24] here's these prophecies was I give it to
[2:01:26] the people right the way it was wrote
[2:01:28] there with the man with discernment on
[2:01:31] it see no slip UPS there they was see
[2:01:34] and and that night there come a woman in
[2:01:37] she's in a wheelchair caught whatever it
[2:01:39] was she's brought up there green scarf
[2:01:42] all the congregations looking for it
[2:01:44] there she was I said lady you stole
[2:01:46] money out of the treasurer when you was
[2:01:48] a young that's right that's right
[2:01:49] brother brandom that's right God forgive
[2:01:51] me I'll make it right well stand up to
[2:01:53] your feet Jesus Christ makes you well
[2:01:55] well there it was see brother Jones move
[2:01:58] away tomorrow at two: it's going to
[2:02:00] happen see all right he moves away and
[2:02:02] it happens well fine we thank the Lord
[2:02:05] go on but what if it don't happen now
[2:02:07] there's an evil spirit among them see
[2:02:10] they don't get that no more till they
[2:02:13] pray that thing away see cuz you know I
[2:02:16] said you know you don't want that Spirit
[2:02:17] on you you don't want no Folly you don't
[2:02:20] want no Hawks right right you want the
[2:02:23] real holy ghost or don't pass any at all
[2:02:27] he said now you put your church in that
[2:02:29] kind of order and watch what Pentecost
[2:02:32] Rises to do you love him aren't you glad
[2:02:36] that we've been able to come out of the
[2:02:40] confusion whereas what Paul says I know

[2:02:46] put my trust I know whom I anchored my
[2:02:50] soul to Hallelujah not a gimmick not
