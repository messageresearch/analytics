[47:16] brother Anthony brother Christian's dad
[47:19] was his right-hand man and um they was
[47:22] just all devastated over the loss there

[48:33] well amen uh Joshua the first chapter
[48:38] and the first verse it says now after
[48:40] the death of Moses the servant of the
[48:43] Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake
[48:46] unto Joshua the son of nun Moses
[48:49] Minister saying Moses my servant is dead
[48:52] now therefore arise go over this Jordan
[48:56] that thou and all this people unto the
[48:58] land which I G do give to them even to
[49:02] the children of Israel and every place
[49:05] that th that the soul of your feet shall
[49:07] tread upon that have I given unto you as
[49:12] I said unto Moses amen if we could turn
[49:14] also to Matthew uh chapter
[49:22] 24 amen let's keep in mind that the Lord
[49:25] spoke unto Joshua jhua and he gave him a
[49:28] promise as he did unto Moses in chapter
[49:31] 20 or Matthew
[49:38] 24 just a single verse here chapter 24
[49:42] verse
[49:44] 35 it says in Heaven and Earth shall
[49:48] pass away but my words shall not pass
[49:51] away amen can we just bow our hearts for
[49:54] a moment now dear heavenly father Lord
[49:56] Lord we just count it an honor and a
[49:58] privilege Lord to Lord to be here and
[50:01] Minister your word father and Lord we
[50:04] feel your presence here this morning
[50:06] already Lord and Lord we ask that you

[50:20] find Comfort Lord and and and knowing
[50:23] that your word is always faithful Lord
[50:26] father Lord we just ask that you would
[50:27] have your way this morning we ask it all
[50:30] in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen
[50:34] amen you can be
[50:36] seated amen we uh I'll um I'll have
[50:39] brother Josiah put this flyer there in
[50:42] the back um so y'all can um see it there
[50:46] um but if I um uh if I were to give a
[50:50] title this morning I would like to um
[50:53] maybe uh title it he is faithful to his
[50:57] word amen so we seen that um God gave
[51:02] Moses or Joshua a promise for them to go
[51:05] and possess the promise and um so God
[51:10] keeps his word he's got to keep his word
[51:13] amen in order to be God Amen in order to
[51:16] be God he has to stand behind everything
[51:19] he said in his word amen and that's
[51:22] exactly where our faith should rest this
[51:25] morning is is upon the spoken word of
[51:28] God Amen do you believe that so if we
[51:30] look back when the children of Israel
[51:32] were in bondage and
[51:35] and and in Egypt and God promised them a
[51:39] deliverer God sent his word and he
[51:41] promised a deliverer now God uh made a
[51:44] covenant with Moses that he would lead
[51:47] them he made a promise with Moses that
[51:49] he would Le them and take them to the
[51:51] land flowing with milk and honey amen
[51:54] and no matter how long it took God was
[51:56] faithful to his word and was able to
[51:59] perform exactly what he had promised
[52:03] amen and and no matter how long it took
[52:07] no matter what he did or had to do to
[52:09] get the job done he he had to call the
[52:12] Flies down he had to create the frogs he
[52:14] had to turn water into the blood and he
[52:17] had to allow death to come in but he was
[52:20] faithful to his word and after they had
[52:24] uh done seen the glory of God down in in
[52:26] Egypt and how God kept his word of of
[52:29] delivering out of Egypt with signs and
[52:32] wonders they had seen the signs and
[52:34] wonders of what God had done and when
[52:36] they seen the the pressing time come and
[52:40] when they when the Red Sea had cut them
[52:43] off the desert had had cut them off and
[52:45] Pharaoh's Army was just behind them and
[52:48] and brother Brown says oh what an hour
[52:50] but God seems to take pleasure in
[52:53] getting his children in such a position
[52:56] it's strange how God leads his children
[52:59] amen as a poet used to say some through
[53:01] the waters some through the flood some
[53:03] through deep trials but all through the
[53:06] blood God has a way of leading his
[53:08] children so odd and pec uh peculiar uh
[53:12] amen do you believe that but God's uh
[53:16] path happened to lead through the Red
[53:18] Sea amen and if God provides a way he or
[53:23] if God has a provided way he has to make
[53:25] a way amen if you come to a Red Sea in
[53:28] your life it's up to God to part that
[53:31] Red Sea it's up to God to make a way
[53:33] amen and and how beautiful to notice
[53:36] just in that crucial hour God waits to
[53:39] the very God always waits to that very
[53:42] crucial moment but he can speak and
[53:45] things Heap up according to his word
[53:47] amen he had promised uh them to take
[53:50] them to the promised land and he's
[53:52] obligated to keep his word amen that
[53:56] great dark crucial moment how easy it
[53:58] was God to figure it out amen when they
[54:01] come up to the Red Sea and they were
[54:03] confused they didn't know what to do
[54:05] they seen that what God did for them in
[54:07] Egypt and now they come up to another
[54:09] trial and and they just become confused
[54:12] and they were asking Moses why would God
[54:14] lead us here but it was brother brand
[54:16] says it was so easy for God to make a
[54:19] way amen and God didn't get all confused
[54:22] he he had the whole situation under
[54:25] control amen he just took the pillar of
[54:28] fire and he moved it over in between the
[54:30] Egyptians coming and it was light to
[54:33] Israel and it was dark to the Egyptians
[54:36] oh the Red Sea got scared and just
[54:38] walled itself up because God's path LED
[54:41] through the middle of it that's the way
[54:44] God does things amen God loves to prove
[54:48] himself to his people amen sometimes as
[54:51] humans we we don't understand why we go
[54:54] through things and we don't understand
[54:56] why we why certain things happen to us
[54:58] and and why God does certain things and
[55:02] and sometimes we we just want to get
[55:04] confused and and sometimes we just want
[55:06] to ask God why but we must remember who
[55:08] holds tomorrow in his hands amen he
[55:11] promised you will see brighter days and
[55:14] he's obligated to keep his word Amen
[55:17] brother brandom says because these
[55:19] people was keeping his word and walking
[55:21] in the light and moving on following
[55:24] God's Commandments everything just
[55:26] opened up for them and if you want
[55:29] things to open up for you you take God
[55:31] out his word and start moving forward
[55:33] walk in the light of his word as he is
[55:36] in the light amen walk in the light for
[55:38] he is the light amen now we understand
[55:43] that they came to the place called
[55:45] Kadesh Baria and that was the Judgment
[55:47] seat for the testing time for or for a
[55:50] testing time for all of Israel and God
[55:52] always test his children by his word
[55:55] amen
[55:56] and did you uh did you hear that God
[55:58] test his children by his word if you
[56:01] believe his word God test you by the
[56:04] word amen now if you notice they come a
[56:07] time to go over and spy out the land
[56:10] amen they they sent out spies and and
[56:13] they sent out 12 Spies and when they
[56:14] went over to spy out the land they came
[56:16] back the 12 and 10 of them said we can't
[56:20] take it we just can't take it they're
[56:22] they're they're much bigger than we are
[56:24] and the cities are walled and we look
[56:26] like grasshoppers beside those great
[56:28] Giants and it just looks impossible amen
[56:32] how many times have we come to a
[56:34] situation it looks impossible for us
[56:37] amen the giants look too big the walls
[56:39] look too big the walls look too strong
[56:41] and and we just don't know what to do
[56:44] but Caleb and Joshua they had uh they
[56:47] had another uh promise they they held on
[56:50] to amen numbers 13:30 says and Caleb
[56:54] stealed the people before Moses
[56:56] and said let us go up at once and
[56:59] possess it for we are more than able to
[57:02] overcome it amen Caleb and Joshua were
[57:05] looking at one thing and the 10 was
[57:07] looking at something else oh my the 10
[57:10] was looking at circumstances the 10 was
[57:13] looking at things that was impossible
[57:15] and and the 10 was just looking at their
[57:17] own ideas and how they seen things but
[57:21] Caleb and Joshua was looking at one
[57:23] thing and that was God's word
[57:26] amen you got to look at God's word this
[57:28] morning amen I don't know how it's going
[57:30] to be done amen if we could just look
[57:33] past those circumstances this morning
[57:35] and focus on what God's word says it'll
[57:38] be okay amen I don't know how it's going
[57:40] to be done but God said that he would
[57:42] have a church without a spot without
[57:45] wrinkle without blemish and I believe
[57:47] he's going to have it oh my he's going
[57:50] to have it just believe it amen it's not
[57:53] up to us to know how God is going to do
[57:56] with the world is getting darker and
[57:58] darker and it just looks bleak and Bleak
[58:00] but as long as there's light amen
[58:02] Darkness can't Prevail

[1:28:04] things happen and and she just become
[1:28:07] depressed and and just just didn't know
[1:28:10] what to do and so one day she she told
[1:28:14] the Lord she says Lord I'm going to
[1:28:17] backslide but before I do I want to give
[1:28:20] you thanks first and so she began to
[1:28:23] thank the Lord out loud and she said

[1:28:33] out to you Lord and you were faithful to
[1:28:36] meet my need thank you Lord I want to

[1:29:29] us and as she began to go through each
[1:29:32] testimony of the faithfulness of God she
