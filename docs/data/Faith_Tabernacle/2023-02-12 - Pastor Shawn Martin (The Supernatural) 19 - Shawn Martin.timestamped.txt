[27:47] and glad we was able to make it and all
[27:50] this weather and and uh it's always good
[27:54] to be in the house of the Lord
[27:56] man we got different ones that are out
[27:59] in the vacation and sick and the
[28:03] whatever but so we want to keep them in
[28:06] our prayer
[28:09] to have service here today and believe
[28:12] the Lord will be with us amen the
[28:15] musicians can be dismissed and enjoyed
[28:18] the worship and the songs that were sung
[28:21] today and
[28:23] um if you have your Bibles we're going
[28:26] to go back to the book of Ephesians
[28:28] chapter 1.
[28:31] and while you're turning there
[28:33] um
[28:34] February the 26th would be on a Sunday
[28:38] where we're only going to have a morning
[28:40] service
[28:41] and um
[28:43] then the evening
[28:45] I'm going to have a Bible study for the
[28:49] young people young couples and
[28:52] so
[28:53] um
[28:54] so just remember that Sunday morning
[28:57] service February 26th and no evening
[29:01] service then so and for you young
[29:05] couples if you've got questions write
[29:08] them down
[29:11] um or just remember them and we'll get
[29:14] together and discuss amen and um
[29:19] if I don't know how to answer your
[29:21] question I'll let you know but
[29:23] by God's help we'll
[29:26] we'll be able to look in God's word and
[29:29] and see if we can
[29:32] help you praise the Lord also I've asked
[29:35] the deacons and really just anyone
[29:38] working in the back but especially the
[29:41] deacons not to be holding babies
[29:45] uh so if you have your child don't pass
[29:49] them to the deacons uh because if
[29:53] anything happens
[29:55] uh if if they're needed on a spot we
[29:58] don't want to put a baby in danger and
[30:01] they need to have their hands free and
[30:04] so uh just remember that I know they
[30:06] would love to
[30:08] babysit your child but they're they
[30:12] they've got a position here so and
[30:15] they've got to make sure they they are
[30:18] available at all times without putting a
[30:21] Child In Harm's Way if that would happen
[30:23] and we might say well we never know you
[30:27] know we're just small we're in
[30:29] Blacksburg but we did have that one that
[30:32] you know came up a few years back and
[30:35] and he made his way to the platform and
[30:39] almost got up here and I thanked the
[30:42] Lord or brother Johnny was sitting over
[30:44] there and he caught it and he took off
[30:47] right here and and grabbed him just in
[30:50] time it was in the middle of preaching
[30:53] and um he didn't like what was being
[30:56] said and and it was it was the weirdest
[30:59] thing because that was on a Wednesday
[31:01] night Tuesday night I I had a real
[31:04] burden for the young people and I was
[31:06] asking the Lord Lord what what would I
[31:08] preach and
[31:10] so I came down here Wednesday morning
[31:12] all day Wednesday just studying and a
[31:16] thought had come to me that morning
[31:17] about the man from Galleria and so I got
[31:22] to just looking that up and how brother
[31:24] Brown talked about
[31:26] that that you know how he's a citizen
[31:29] good citizen family man and he told lie
[31:33] I believe it was or he he done something
[31:35] then he told a lie and he said it just
[31:38] started accumulating the spirit and just
[31:40] accumulating and I fought all day long
[31:44] that day of use depression just feeling
[31:47] just uh uh oh it was horrible and my
[31:52] wife had come down while the songs were
[31:54] gone said everything okay and I said I
[31:57] don't want to go up there something's
[31:58] something's wrong I just don't know what
[32:00] it is I'm just fighting something
[32:02] so anyway I came up and just started
[32:05] preaching and and the man was sitting
[32:07] back there where Mindy's at and and
[32:10] um you know he had his head down the
[32:12] whole time I welcomed him uh so I'm glad
[32:14] to be here and so anyway we got to
[32:16] preaching about the man of gathering and
[32:19] uh got talking about you know the demons
[32:21] and then I was saying of how that you
[32:24] know uh think of how worse it is today
[32:27] than it was back then and what they had
[32:30] back then and yet he accumulated all
[32:33] them demons just by lying and by this
[32:35] and here we got movies and and things
[32:38] like that and and uh he got up and and
[32:42] he walked out and and passed the the
[32:46] brothers and and and so I was watching
[32:49] him as I was preaching and then he
[32:51] turned around and I just saw it uh it
[32:54] was just a wicked face and and I knew it
[32:56] wasn't him but uh just demonic and here
[33:01] he come you know and he'd come walking
[33:02] all the way down here and and anyway it
[33:06] that is and he caught everybody off
[33:08] guard is what it did you know and so I
[33:11] was really thankful that brother Johnny
[33:12] uh he was aware enough he said he had
[33:15] been watching him out of the corner of
[33:16] his eye and watched what he'd done and
[33:18] uh so so then the brothers come and and
[33:21] helped him out and he was yelling you
[33:24] know stop stop you know these young
[33:26] people don't need to hear this stop and
[33:28] so I knew I was on target then so
[33:32] um yeah you know the Lord has his way
[33:35] ain't that right so anyway we want the
[33:38] deacons to be free they're hands-free
[33:40] and so if you don't mind just uh
[33:43] respecting that
[33:45] today sir as from now on but
[33:49] um also those that were in Florida good
[33:52] to have you back I'm glad you made it
[33:54] home safely amen hope you had a good
[33:56] time I heard it was in the 80s up there
[33:59] and so I almost left too you know
[34:04] but uh beautiful weather I'm sure but
[34:07] good to have you back home amen the book
[34:10] of Ephesians the first chapter and the
[34:14] 22nd verse it says Anne hath put all
[34:17] things under his feet and gave him to be
[34:21] the head over all things to the church
[34:23] which is his body
[34:26] the fullness of him that feeleth all in
[34:29] all amen let's just bow our heads talk
[34:33] to our Lord father
[34:36] we just come to you with Humble Hearts
[34:39] Lord
[34:41] knowing that we're just mortal people
[34:43] father it's got a lot of maybe things
[34:48] that we go through and limitations and
[34:53] was just Humanity Lord but we also know
[34:57] that we're your children

[35:01] within his father and it's pulled us to
[35:04] come to your house today
[35:07] and father we've gathered under a
[35:09] promise
[35:10] that where two or three are gathered in
[35:12] your name you would be here Lord and you
[35:14] promised that
[35:16] and father you you said for us to not
[35:19] forsake the assembling of ourselves
[35:21] together even the more as we see the day
[35:24] approaching and we believe that we're
[35:26] here in this day father and and Lord
[35:30] we've come gathered and we're now asking
[35:34] that you would just move Among Us
[35:36] Lord Speak Lord through these mortal
[35:40] lips
[35:41] and I pray father that you would help
[35:44] the people to receive anoint Lord not
[35:47] only me but anoint the hearts of your
[35:49] children
[35:50] father may we be elevated in Heavenly
[35:53] places this morning Father
[35:55] oh God May the Eternal speak and may the
[35:59] Eternal receive
[36:00] we ask it father in Jesus Christ's name
[36:04] we pray
[36:05] amen and amen you can have your seats
[36:09] this morning
[36:12] and we certainly want to keep brother
[36:14] and Walker and Sister Walker in our
[36:17] prayer
[36:18] and the Lord will just
[36:22] be with him encourage them and um
[36:26] there are great Veterans of the Gospel
[36:29] amen but you know we we have uh reading
[36:33] here from the book of the Ephesians and
[36:35] and we've we've talked of how that the
[36:40] book of Ephesians parallels the the Book
[36:42] of Joshua
[36:44] and um
[36:46] you know again brother Brahm said you
[36:49] know I think it was in the message
[36:50] Paradox but he says the the Book of
[36:53] Joshua was the book of Ephesians of the
[36:56] Old Testament
[36:57] it was it is a book of redemption
[37:00] it is a book of redemption and brother
[37:03] Branham taught us that there are two
[37:05] parts of redemption uh and that was the
[37:09] coming out of and going into
[37:12] and so the the Book of Joshua uh dealt
[37:17] with the second part of redemption and
[37:20] that was going in in two
[37:22] and and so uh and and we find the
[37:27] commission that God gave Joshua and to
[37:30] be strong to be of good courage and
[37:34] um and and these things but uh then then
[37:38] here brother Branham says and we find
[37:40] out that we've come we have come to
[37:43] another Ephesians another Ephesus now
[37:47] and he says where that in our
[37:50] intellectual denominations and so forth
[37:53] and all of our educational programs has
[37:56] come to its Jordan and we know what
[37:59] Jordan represents this death so it's
[38:02] come they've come to their death they've
[38:04] served their purpose and now they've
[38:06] died ain't that right and and remember
[38:10] they had to come to Jordan first before
[38:13] they come into the promised land and so
[38:16] he says see it's Jordan it's come to its
[38:19] Jordan then we must have an Ephesians
[38:23] again we must have an exodus to come out
[38:28] see and to go into for the Rapture so as
[38:35] as in and so in one sense as looking at
[38:38] that quote we could we could look at it
[38:41] that that we're not waiting for in
[38:43] Exodus the Rapture would not be the
[38:47] Exodus that he's talking about but that
[38:51] we've got to have an exodus before we go
[38:53] into a Rapture and so which would
[38:56] fulfill now again I know brother Brown
[38:59] talked of of Exodus and I do believe
[39:01] that we are we are an exodus people of
[39:05] coming out from the from Mortal to
[39:07] immortality and these things but I'm
[39:09] talking about the Exodus that you should
[39:12] have now and and Revelations 8 18 4 says
[39:18] and I heard another voice from Heaven
[39:20] saying come out of her my people now you
[39:23] don't come out of her my people uh when
[39:27] you go into a Rapture these this this
[39:30] Exodus should be happening now or should
[39:32] have already happened
[39:34] but come out of her my people that you
[39:37] be not partakers of her sins and that
[39:40] you received not of her plague so so
[39:43] when brother Brown said we must have an
[39:45] exodus I believe that's the Exodus he's
[39:47] talking about for he says we must have
[39:49] an exodus and and and go into for the
[39:53] Rapture and so uh The Exodus is come out
[39:57] of her my people and and so now that
[40:01] that's a a that's a challenge uh for
[40:04] every broad member for every if you're
[40:07] going to interrupture you got to come
[40:09] out out of her so you've got to come out
[40:12] of her Traditions come out of her
[40:14] teachings come out of her doctrines so
[40:16] many people amen they come into the
[40:18] message but they're holding on to to
[40:20] traditions of of years goal and and
[40:24] these things and you can't do that uh uh
[40:27] you've got to come out of her doctrines
[40:29] you've got to come out of her system you
[40:31] got to come out of her unbelief you see
[40:35] come out and go into for the Rapture
[40:38] ain't that right now some people may
[40:40] think that they're okay because they're
[40:42] not part of the denomination well I go
[40:44] to an independent church I'm a
[40:47] non-denominational but still that does
[40:49] not make you okay uh because uh uh
[40:54] Israel we we understand that the the
[40:57] reason why God brought Israel out of
[41:00] Egypt that Exodus coming out was because
[41:03] he had a land for them to go into and
[41:07] and so uh uh when anyone you know uh
[41:11] anyone that refused to follow and uh
[41:15] that Pillar of Fire a man they died they
[41:18] perished they God would not allow them a
[41:21] to raise a nation uh in in the
[41:24] wilderness it just couldn't do it amen
[41:27] and and see the land was their
[41:29] inheritance so God would take them out
[41:32] of something that was not there years
[41:34] well it didn't belong to them uh and and
[41:38] even though they were in slavery God
[41:40] never looked at them as slaves he looked
[41:43] at them as another people it's separate
[41:46] and and so he would bring them out by a
[41:48] mighty hand amen but but be the land was
[41:52] their inheritance they could not
[41:55] overcome until they went into their land
[41:57] they they could not overcome cities they
[42:00] could not establish themselves as a
[42:03] nation until they went into the promised
[42:06] land ain't that right they went into
[42:08] other other nations then uh Esau's uh
[42:12] they went through the land of Esau the
[42:13] land of Moab and and and different ones
[42:16] but but they they were not to to to
[42:19] dwell there they were not to uh to argue
[42:22] with them they were not to uh remain
[42:25] with them they had a land to go to ain't
[42:28] that right and so uh uh we we find that
[42:32] they could not overcome anything thing
[42:34] until they went into the land and
[42:37] brother Brown said the land represented
[42:39] the age of the Overcomer ain't that
[42:42] right so so those who refused to go into
[42:46] they came out but those who refused to
[42:49] go into a man perished a man and and so
[42:53] we we find that the reason why they
[42:57] could not go unto into because Paul
[43:00] would tell us of their unbelief uh the
[43:04] hardness of their heart uh uh uh they
[43:08] they were full of unbelief ain't that
[43:11] right and and it proved it because when
[43:13] they saw their Giants now they had the
[43:15] promises and remember the spies went on
[43:18] in into the land and and and they had
[43:21] the promise with them they had the
[43:23] supernatural they had they had the
[43:25] atonement they had the rock they had all
[43:28] of these things a man but when they went
[43:31] into that promised land they saw the
[43:33] Giants and and and the giants made them
[43:36] look like grasshoppers ain't that right
[43:39] and you know I mean the the compared to
[43:41] the size of these Giants and and and
[43:44] then they saw the walled cities and and
[43:47] all of these things they forgot about
[43:49] the promises a man and their heart
[43:52] because what they saw they were filled
[43:55] with their heart was hardened a Man
[43:58] became hardened at at the the obstacles
[44:02] in in the land that they saw ain't that
[44:05] right but see God told them that they
[44:07] would overcome but but but they would
[44:10] overcome by the supernatural ain't that
[44:15] right it would take the supernatural for
[44:18] them to overcome amen and so here we are
[44:21] we're in that Ephesus again we are in
[44:24] that time of going into and I believe
[44:27] brother branham's Ministry fit both
[44:29] Joshua and and Moses I I believe it was
[44:32] the message that brought us us out of of
[44:36] uh from her from that that system but I
[44:39] also believe that the message of the
[44:42] hour is a Joshua Ministry a man that
[44:46] would lead us into the promised land
[44:48] ain't that right or the land of promise
[44:51] and and and I believe that that uh uh
[44:55] adoption is a promise I I believe that
[44:57] that healing is a promise I believe a
[45:00] body changes a promise I I believe the
[45:02] catching away is a promise I believe the
[45:04] Millennium is a promise I I believe
[45:07] Heaven the the new Heaven A New Earth is
[45:09] a promise I I believe that that that
[45:12] we're not just entering to something in
[45:14] a natural sense amen but we're actually
[45:17] entering into an eternal uh uh Promises
[45:21] of God ain't that right amen and and so
[45:25] but but but see the Rapture is in the
[45:28] promised land the the the Millennium is
[45:31] in the promised land if you want to say
[45:33] it that way amen uh uh your body changes
[45:37] in a in the promised land everything
[45:39] that we're looking for if this end time
[45:43] is in the promised land amen so you got
[45:46] to come out and you got to leave it all
[45:48] because you cannot go into the promised
[45:51] land a man land a promise until you
[45:54] cross Jordan and Jordan is a time of
[45:57] death it's that's what it represents
[46:00] your ideas have got to die man's
[46:02] Traditions have got to die our old
[46:04] thinking has got to die amen everything
[46:07] that you've been taught has got to die
[46:09] amen if it's not according to the
[46:11] message of the hour it's got to die
[46:13] anything right you you you can't bring a
[46:17] man all of these things along with you
[46:19] we we uh uh and I hope that makes sense
[46:23] I know there's other people that claim
[46:25] to be prophets and they can't claim to
[46:26] be the uh uh you know uh uh something to
[46:30] lead the people but that's I I don't I
[46:32] don't believe that I believe that there
[46:33] are are a five-fold Ministry prophets
[46:36] amen but they're not leaders in the
[46:39] sense that the bride has to listen to
[46:41] them ain't that right and usually when
[46:43] you find people like that they'll
[46:45] seclude their Church from everybody else
[46:47] Amen to where the church all they know
[46:50] is them and and a prophet or brother
[46:52] Branham and most of the time it's them
[46:55] exalting their own Ministry even above
[46:57] brother Branham amen and they don't they
[46:59] and and a lot of churches don't know
[47:01] that there's other evangelists out there
[47:03] they don't know that there's pastors out
[47:04] there they just think they're off on a
[47:06] little island and you know why it's
[47:08] because that man maybe he's got a gift
[47:11] maybe he's got something special and and
[47:13] and he uses that to bring the people to
[47:16] himself brother Branham even says he
[47:18] uses it to bind the people to him can
[47:21] you say man well we're not here to bind
[47:24] the people to us I believe you ought to
[47:25] have respect a band for the men of God I
[47:28] I think that's what the Bible says give
[47:30] honor where honor is due ain't that
[47:33] right I believe believe that you are to
[47:35] follow the pastor as as as Paul would
[47:38] tell us follow me as I follow Christ
[47:40] ain't that right that that's exactly
[47:42] right but if the pastor is not following
[47:45] the message if it's not in the Bible
[47:46] don't follow it amen that that's just
[47:49] the way it is if the Evangelist ain't
[47:50] following the message don't follow it
[47:52] amen if if the fivefold ministry a man
[47:56] is not following the message don't
[47:57] follow it because I believe that God
[47:59] sent us a Joshua to take us over into
[48:03] the promised land ain't that right so so
[48:06] we're not here to exalt other gifts
[48:08] we're not here the the the one thing
[48:10] that I wanted to exalt of course is the
[48:13] is the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but
[48:16] we see that the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[48:18] is is is Vindicated this message
[48:21] thoroughly can you say Amen it is so
[48:24] thoroughly Vindicated that that that I
[48:26] should never have questions uh about the
[48:29] message of the hour amen and I don't
[48:32] want you having questions about the
[48:33] message of the hour so I want to preach
[48:36] it in such a way that when you leave
[48:38] this building and you keep leaving these
[48:40] services that you it I never build up
[48:42] questions about whether brother Branham
[48:44] missed it here whether he was here
[48:46] whether he's here I say if God
[48:48] Vindicated it's good enough for me and
[48:51] it's good enough for you can you say man
[48:53] amen why why do we want to be like this
[48:56] is because I want you to be so sure that
[48:58] this message is right I want you to be
[49:01] so sure that it is the absolute for this
[49:04] age because it's time amen that you've
[49:07] got to go into the promised land amen
[49:09] you've got to go into your inheritance
[49:11] and you can't do it amen with questions
[49:13] in your mind you can't do it amen with
[49:16] doubt of of whether the message is right
[49:18] or some of it is inspired some of it is
[49:20] in it and and you're so confused I
[49:23] understand people worship brother
[49:24] Branham amen but you know when I come
[49:26] into this message it was it it it it it
[49:29] it wasn't no mystery that brother
[49:31] Branham was a man I could stand here and
[49:34] preach to you brother bran was a man
[49:35] brother Brandon was a man brother
[49:36] Brandon was a man and all I'm going to
[49:38] do amen is is calls doubt to come into
[49:41] your mind Amen to where everything
[49:43] brother Brown says you're going to
[49:45] question it amen but I want to show you
[49:47] a man that is the miracle not that he's
[49:49] a man he is a man amen he made mistakes
[49:52] he told us about them things that the
[49:55] miracle is is that there was a God that
[49:57] would vindicate his ministry so fairly
[50:00] amen that you can look past the man and
[50:02] see God can you say Amen you can look
[50:05] past the man look past his failures look
[50:08] past it all and say well if God
[50:10] Vindicated him well I'm going to follow
[50:12] him if God amend what he said I'll amen
[50:16] it too amen if God showed up with him
[50:18] amen then I want to be part of it can
[50:21] you say Amen it was so supernaturally
[50:23] Vindicated amen so we ain't got time
[50:26] Amen to be around messing around and and
[50:29] and questioning this and questioning
[50:31] that now I understand you got questions
[50:33] maybe I've got questions amen as far as
[50:35] I don't understand what he said amen but
[50:39] I believe it amen so my questions don't
[50:41] go so deep Amen to where I began to
[50:45] question his his ability to teach his
[50:47] ability to lead his ability to say well
[50:50] is he really the one that that Malachi 4
[50:54] spoke of you understand what I'm saying
[50:55] people get so many questions amen and
[50:59] and they dwell upon the questions amen
[51:01] uh uh uh well you know and and to be
[51:05] honest brother Brown didn't raise the
[51:06] question unbelievers raises the
[51:08] questions brother Branham just told us
[51:10] that there were 16 men that fell off
[51:12] their lives off that bridge that's good
[51:14] enough for me it's the unbeliever that
[51:16] says well I want proof well you know I I
[51:19] just say well them them and I got to be
[51:21] careful you know them dumbos hey man why
[51:24] aren't they seeking proof amen that the
[51:26] Red Sea opened up can you say man why
[51:29] aren't they why why aren't they seeking
[51:31] proof amen that the water turned into
[51:33] wine why ain't they seeking proof that
[51:35] Jesus is really there's the Skeptics
[51:37] that tell us that Jesus was not amen
[51:40] Messiah that he was just a prophet you
[51:42] understand what I'm saying questions
[51:44] doubt can go so it just it's never
[51:48] ending it just constantly goes and
[51:50] constantly goes and constantly goes that
[51:53] I'm here to tell you amen that that
[51:55] there was an answer God provided the
[51:59] answers Amen to every question if you
[52:02] just have the faith to believe it can
[52:04] you say Amen so so it's time to go into
[52:07] the promised land amen and I believe
[52:09] that's where we're at amen we're
[52:12] entering into the promised land and you
[52:14] you might be saying oh my I see the
[52:16] obstacles in my life I see the obstacles
[52:18] and it's just over bear whelming amen
[52:21] well they have the obstacles too but one
[52:23] thing about it they believe the message
[52:24] of the hour one thing about it the
[52:27] message showed them that is the promises
[52:29] amen it's your promise it's your
[52:31] inheritances it's yours to claim it's
[52:33] yours to take can you say Amen there's
[52:36] not one time that Joshua would tell them
[52:38] I know it's too big I know I know I know
[52:40] I don't know maybe let's go to something
[52:42] smaller where it's more easier for you
[52:44] amen no no he would keep them reminded
[52:49] of the promises he would lead them to
[52:52] whatever obstacle it didn't matter amen
[52:54] but it was God leading them ain't that
[52:56] right well the obstacles that come in
[52:58] your life you can either let your heart
[53:00] be hardened by unbelief amen and say
[53:03] well I just can't do it I just don't
[53:05] know or you could look at it and take
[53:07] Courage by the message of the hour amen
[53:10] for God said as I was with Moses so
[53:13] shall I be with you amen we ought to
[53:15] take courage in that amen that if God
[53:18] would never leave brother Adam God will
[53:20] never leave us
[53:22] ain't that right so it's going to take
[53:24] the supernatural in this day for us to
[53:28] overcome it's not by might remember what
[53:30] the Bible says and and actually it was
[53:33] at the coming of The Headstone not by
[53:35] might nor by power but by my spirit
[53:37] saith the Lord amen see and so I'm
[53:41] looking at this and I I believe that the
[53:44] church will be the ones to overcome
[53:46] everyone that's part of the Church of
[53:48] the Living God they're the ones that's
[53:50] going to overcome and I don't care what
[53:52] obstacle you know you can look at it and
[53:55] despair you can look at it and say
[53:56] there's no hope you can look at it
[53:58] whatever you want to but I'm telling you
[54:00] it doesn't matter what kind of a devil
[54:03] there is amen that the bride of Christ
[54:05] is facing they're going to overcome amen
[54:08] because of the Church of the Living God
[54:11] Amen and they are the body of Jesus
[54:14] Christ now that makes the difference
[54:16] you're the body of Jesus Christ as we
[54:19] have read the body is the main Central
[54:22] uh the main Central or principal Park
[54:25] the material part it gives form or shape
[54:28] too it's the expression of Amen so the
[54:33] body doesn't make the life what it is
[54:35] the life makes the body what it is amen
[54:39] the body only expresses the life amen
[54:43] the body does not control the life the
[54:45] life controls the body ain't that right
[54:48] so it only expresses the life that's in
[54:50] it amen the body of a plant expresses
[54:53] the life a man that's in it amen the
[54:56] body of of an animal expresses the life
[55:00] that's in it the human body expresses
[55:02] human life ain't that right uh uh uh
[55:06] plant life expresses botany life animal
[55:08] life uh uh or body expresses animal life
[55:12] a man see human life expresses uh uh uh
[55:16] the human body expresses human life amen
[55:19] but then we look at God God needed the
[55:21] body to express himself through hey
[55:24] ain't that right now he could have come
[55:26] up with some some idea of body somebody
[55:29] amen that that he wanted he he created
[55:32] the animals the way it is for for animal
[55:34] life he created the the the the body of
[55:37] plants and all that for uh uh botany
[55:40] alive he created the humans amen the way
[55:42] they are Amen to express human life
[55:45] ain't that right amen and and that's
[55:48] what humans do amen so he could have
[55:50] made himself a body of any of any kind a
[55:53] man and that body would have expressed
[55:55] himself uh uh in that but we find out he
[55:59] did create a body called the Melchizedek
[56:01] the body of Melchizedek ain't that right
[56:04] he lived in that body amen and what did
[56:07] that body do Express God Amen he
[56:10] expressed God he performed the
[56:13] supernatural through that body how did
[56:15] that man stand in there know about Sarah
[56:17] where what Sarah was how did he know
[56:19] about the changing of Abraham name and
[56:22] Sarah's name and and how did he know
[56:25] that she laughed secretly behind him
[56:27] amen it was God living in that body amen
[56:31] and expressed itself himself through the
[56:34] body we find he created a man for
[56:37] himself another body in the womb of a
[56:40] woman ain't that right amen it's the
[56:43] only begotten Son of God for he came
[56:46] through the womb of a woman and called
[56:50] his name Jesus so both bodies expressed
[56:53] amen the god that lived inside of them
[56:56] amen but but God didn't want to create
[56:59] just more bodies and more bodies no he
[57:02] would take he would take uh bodies that
[57:05] had already been born and he would
[57:07] redeem them so that he could live in
[57:10] them and express himself through
[57:14] now that's what's hard for people to
[57:16] understand that God could take a
[57:18] redeemed body and perform the same
[57:21] Messiah sign that he done in the body of
[57:23] Melchizedek and that he done in the body
[57:25] of Jesus Christ and he would stand in
[57:28] this day in a body a human body a
[57:31] seventh grade educated Kentuckian and
[57:34] performed the same Supernatural sign and
[57:37] people don't understand don't believe
[57:38] that but that's what God desired he
[57:41] wanted to take a body a man redeemed
[57:43] that body that he could express his
[57:46] deity through
[57:47] it ain't that right amen soap but he
[57:50] didn't want to just leaving the body
[57:51] brother Branham so that's why we don't
[57:53] put it all to brother Branham we thank
[57:55] God for brother Branham I thank God for
[57:57] his ministry if it had not been for the
[57:59] ministry we wouldn't be here today amen
[58:01] but you can't just sit here and say well
[58:03] I believe in a prophet and then just sit
[58:05] dormant amen not knowing the god of the
[58:08] Prophet that God wanted to take your
[58:10] body as well brother beagle amen and he
[58:13] wanted to express his deity through you
[58:15] he wanted to express deity through
[58:17] through us as human beings ain't that
[58:19] right amen and I'm so glad for that amen
[58:22] that he didn't want to just create
[58:23] another body out there but he would take
[58:25] our sex-born body and he'd have a blood
[58:28] and atonement that was so powerful
[58:31] enough that a holy God could live in
[58:34] this Mortal body and express his power
[58:36] Express his deity Express the supremess
[58:40] of God
[58:41] can you say Amen to think of it that the
[58:44] Mortal body can never diminish God your
[58:47] mortal body can never amen Dethrone God
[58:50] if God is uh if if God was all
[58:53] magnificent on the on the first day of
[58:56] creation amen he still all magnificent
[58:59] if he's Almighty back then he's still
[59:02] Almighty amen if there was nothing
[59:05] greater back then there's nothing
[59:07] greater today
[59:09] nothing greater
[59:12] see God is Supernatural
[59:14] we talked about it Supernatural
[59:16] departing from what is normal usual
[59:20] so as to appear to transcend the laws of
[59:23] nature
[59:24] see it's an uh it supersedes
[59:28] overrides overpowers the natural God can
[59:33] do that
[59:34] God can do that
[59:36] God can soak live in your body
[59:38] a man that he can change you
[59:41] a man for mortal
[59:43] a man from expressing mortal man Mortal
[59:47] Thoughts Mortal Mortal Humanity amen and
[59:51] and all of these things and yet come in
[59:54] that body of corruption and express who
[59:56] he is deity
[59:59] amen the prophet said deity's not in
[1:00:01] heaven it's in you
[1:00:03] ain't ain't that right and God would
[1:00:06] call you the body amen a part of his
[1:00:08] body because you are just only something
[1:00:12] that he expresses you're only something
[1:00:15] that expresses what's inside of you
[1:00:20] it's so sad that a lot of church speaks
[1:00:22] people don't believe in the Supernatural
[1:00:25] can you say man the prophet said he
[1:00:28] could not be Supernatural if he wasn't
[1:00:31] omnipotent
[1:00:32] and that word omnipotent again is having
[1:00:35] unlimited Authority or influence a force
[1:00:39] of unlimited power
[1:00:41] so you're just the body of unlimited
[1:00:43] power you're you're the body where
[1:00:46] omnipotent dwells in ain't that right
[1:00:49] and he's the only one that is omnipotent
[1:00:52] brother Brown said God likes to show his
[1:00:55] power not that he has to God doesn't
[1:00:58] have to show his power but he likes to
[1:01:00] show his power he loves to do it it
[1:01:03] pleases him in his omnipotence to let
[1:01:07] his subjects know who he is
[1:01:11] oh man you know it's it's one thing to
[1:01:13] learn about him
[1:01:15] it's it's one thing you know you those
[1:01:18] of you that have been to school and been
[1:01:20] trained for something you know I went to
[1:01:22] school for electricity and and in class
[1:01:26] you know the teachers there and and you
[1:01:29] he's put it all on paper and you're
[1:01:30] you're studying the books you're you're
[1:01:32] writing things down you're taking your
[1:01:34] tests amen and that's one thing you're
[1:01:36] getting book learning but oh it's
[1:01:39] another thing to be Hands-On when you
[1:01:42] get out on the field on the job amen now
[1:01:45] you're experiencing something that is
[1:01:47] far greater than your book learning you
[1:01:49] understand what I'm saying and and so
[1:01:52] many people have stopped just with book
[1:01:53] learning amen just coming to church
[1:01:56] hearing about God learning about God
[1:01:58] Amen and yet know nothing about his
[1:02:01] realities amen but God doesn't want you
[1:02:04] just sitting in a church a man like it's
[1:02:06] a school amen you're taking your little
[1:02:09] notes and you're learning about him and
[1:02:10] all of these things he wants you out on
[1:02:12] the field so to speak Amen to where you
[1:02:15] can have your own experiences amen I
[1:02:18] just you know there's one thing to hear
[1:02:20] the experiences of my teacher and how he
[1:02:22] would tell me this and he would tell me
[1:02:24] this some of them were funny some of
[1:02:25] them were was horrific and some of them
[1:02:27] you know wow you know you could
[1:02:29] understand you know you're teaching you
[1:02:31] know all these things but but then then
[1:02:33] was I got out there a man hands on I
[1:02:37] began to develop my experiences amen and
[1:02:40] I got some experiences to tell ain't
[1:02:41] gonna tell you today amen but see uh uh
[1:02:45] as Christians how many people don't have
[1:02:47] experiences of God they've learned about
[1:02:49] it amen they've been taught about it
[1:02:52] they sung about it they wrote about it
[1:02:54] amen but to have experiences for
[1:02:57] yourself amen now that's what God has
[1:02:59] has come and that's why we are the body
[1:03:01] of Jesus Christ ain't that right amen uh
[1:03:04] uh I didn't you know I was studying to
[1:03:07] be electrician on at at school amen but
[1:03:11] I became an electrician out on the field
[1:03:13] ain't that right and God doesn't want
[1:03:16] you studying about being sons of God God
[1:03:18] wants you to be sons of God God doesn't
[1:03:21] want you to study about being a daughter
[1:03:23] of God God doesn't want you to study
[1:03:25] about laying hands on the sick God wants
[1:03:27] you to lay hands on the sick and watch
[1:03:29] them recover amen God wants you to
[1:03:32] testify and what some soul come in by
[1:03:35] your testimony can you say amen God
[1:03:38] doesn't want just you to learn about
[1:03:41] overcoming God wants you to overcome
[1:03:46] ain't that right yes sir amen let's set
[1:03:49] our sights a little higher
[1:03:52] amen we're Sons and Daughters of God
[1:03:56] now not everybody sees his omnipotent
[1:03:59] power
[1:04:00] amen because they don't believe in it
[1:04:02] Amen brother Brown said churches that
[1:04:04] don't believe in Divine Healing amen and
[1:04:07] the Performing of Miracles are dying
[1:04:10] they have withered up to a bloodless
[1:04:12] cult
[1:04:14] amen they've withered up to a bloodless
[1:04:17] cult and and we find that that that it's
[1:04:20] become a social gospel and the Social
[1:04:23] Gospel brother Brown said is becoming
[1:04:25] predominant amen today it's it's so
[1:04:28] predominant it's because the seminaries
[1:04:30] and everything else has taken all the
[1:04:33] phenomenal away from God sure it's easy
[1:04:36] to take the phenomenal away from God
[1:04:38] when you're just talking about him it's
[1:04:40] sure it's easy Amen to take the
[1:04:42] phenomenal away from the a man from the
[1:04:44] congregation a man from the church amen
[1:04:47] when you're just sitting there just
[1:04:48] doing a little Bible Lesson you know
[1:04:50] amen well that that's fine for Bible
[1:04:52] lessons amen but you can take away the
[1:04:55] supernatural amen the phenomenal of God
[1:04:58] to where no one says even says and amen
[1:05:00] anymore amen you just slowly strip the
[1:05:03] people up strip the church up and all
[1:05:05] this to where everybody just goes home
[1:05:07] well that was a good sermon and a lot of
[1:05:09] people don't even remember the sermon
[1:05:10] anymore these days because they got
[1:05:12] baseball on their mind they got movies
[1:05:13] on
[1:05:15] everything else on their mind amen but
[1:05:18] see when you really know the
[1:05:20] supernatural power of God
[1:05:22] it's not just something you can forget
[1:05:27] ain't that right
[1:05:29] see so when the power of God is taken
[1:05:33] out of the Gospel it then becomes a
[1:05:35] social gospel
[1:05:37] and Social Gospel promotes education
[1:05:40] knowledge and learning
[1:05:43] and the prophet says it hatches out
[1:05:45] Infidel preachers with education instead
[1:05:48] of Salvation ain't that right ministers
[1:05:52] who preach a social gospel just stand
[1:05:54] and talk about little petty things a
[1:05:57] little bitty Bible stories of the Bible
[1:05:59] or something like that instead of
[1:06:01] preaching repentance and bringing men
[1:06:03] and women to the altar hey you ain't
[1:06:06] that Ryan see why because they taking
[1:06:08] the power of God out of the church
[1:06:11] they've taken the power of God out of
[1:06:13] the Gospel amen no wonder we just don't
[1:06:16] think that people can get saved anymore
[1:06:18] well I'm one to tell you that God can
[1:06:21] still save a person and we ought to be
[1:06:23] busy trying to send somebody leads
[1:06:27] somebody to the Lord if we believe in
[1:06:29] this gospel ah can you say amen amen
[1:06:33] that's right I don't think we got to be
[1:06:34] trained on how to do it I just think we
[1:06:37] ought to let God to be so alive in our
[1:06:40] lives amen that it'll pulsate with in us
[1:06:43] that you just can't help if you hear if
[1:06:46] you go get a restaurant and you taste
[1:06:48] that food and you think man that is
[1:06:50] awesome that's the best steak I've ever
[1:06:52] eaten you're going to tell somebody
[1:06:53] about it amen you've experienced it you
[1:06:56] know it amen ain't that right amen it
[1:06:59] ain't just the preacher up here just
[1:07:00] preaching some little old a hum dung of
[1:07:02] a message you know amen and and
[1:07:04] everybody just being in their little
[1:07:06] class and and taking their little notes
[1:07:08] and all that and then we go out the door
[1:07:10] and the world has more life in us then
[1:07:12] God has more life God wants to have a
[1:07:16] body he will have a body he has a body
[1:07:19] on this Earth
[1:07:24] so they make Jesus just a philosopher
[1:07:27] see because they don't believe that he
[1:07:30] what he was
[1:07:32] they don't believe that he is
[1:07:35] and they don't believe a lot of people
[1:07:37] don't believe that Jesus is more than
[1:07:39] just a philosopher or just a prophet
[1:07:42] amen
[1:07:43] and so they certainly don't believe in
[1:07:45] the power of God today
[1:07:47] amen
[1:07:49] now brother Brian said they're trying to
[1:07:51] take all the deity all the glory away
[1:07:54] from Christ and trying to make him just
[1:07:56] a prophet if Christ was just the prophet
[1:08:00] every one of us is lost
[1:08:04] ain't that right
[1:08:05] so those who preach a a social gospel
[1:08:09] deny the blood of Christ they deny the
[1:08:11] Miracles healings the Holy Ghost they
[1:08:13] denied the supernatural signs and so
[1:08:16] again most people have lived their life
[1:08:19] going to church amen learning about God
[1:08:23] and yet they've never experienced him in
[1:08:27] his realities can you say Amen now this
[1:08:31] is where you've got to come out of come
[1:08:34] out of her my people can you say Amen
[1:08:36] come out of her my people amen see
[1:08:39] they're religious to the core but yet
[1:08:41] they've never experienced the
[1:08:43] supernatural God Amen because amen the
[1:08:47] Social Gospel has lured them has lured
[1:08:51] them brother Branham types the Social
[1:08:53] Gospel he Likens it to a snake he said a
[1:08:56] snake can catch the eye of a bird and he
[1:08:59] can get the direct hold on that bird
[1:09:01] amen and he can make that bird come
[1:09:04] right off his Roost flutter right around
[1:09:06] and around and around and come right
[1:09:08] straight to the snake's mouth I'm told
[1:09:11] that this eye of a snake is so powerful
[1:09:13] that when it catches the eye of a bird
[1:09:16] it charms him lures him right into the
[1:09:19] snake and they say that little bird will
[1:09:21] flutter and flutter and flutter coming
[1:09:23] down and if it don't quickly start
[1:09:26] raising its head and shaking from that
[1:09:29] snake and start looking upward it'll
[1:09:31] never free itself that's the only way it
[1:09:35] can free itself can you say amen and
[1:09:38] that's the only way he says that the
[1:09:40] church can free itself Amen to come out
[1:09:42] is to look at Christ of who he is amen
[1:09:46] and God in this age did not reveal
[1:09:49] Christ through some Sunday school lesson
[1:09:52] he revealed himself by the supernatural
[1:09:55] God being manifested upon the Earth
[1:09:58] today and we can say that's Jesus Christ
[1:10:01] amen that's Jesus Christ
[1:10:03] I know there's a lot of uh
[1:10:05] impersonations and you got a lot of
[1:10:07] speaking in tongues a lot of prophecies
[1:10:08] a lot of shaking a lot of emotions a lot
[1:10:11] of that amen and and and and and there's
[1:10:13] a lot of impersonations of all of that
[1:10:15] amen but there's a real one stick keep
[1:10:17] your eye up on Christ amen there's a
[1:10:19] more Supernatural anyone can shake and
[1:10:21] cry amen win a million dollars and see
[1:10:23] what happens to you amen you talking
[1:10:25] about oh I'll jump amen I'll be excited
[1:10:28] you know what I'll do I'll go calling
[1:10:30] everybody around that I know that I just
[1:10:32] won a million dollars you understand
[1:10:34] what I'm saying you ain't gonna have to
[1:10:35] you ain't gonna have to push me brother
[1:10:36] Terry to say that amen there's something
[1:10:39] about it amen that has got me excited
[1:10:41] ain't that right amen if that's just
[1:10:43] something normal that's I mean that's
[1:10:44] just something that a a human being will
[1:10:47] do amen so you come into church and
[1:10:49] people can shout and be emotional and
[1:10:51] all of that and that distilled doesn't
[1:10:53] have nothing to do with it what we want
[1:10:55] is God to live in this body amen and
[1:10:58] reflect his Supernatural power
[1:11:04] you know the word for social gospel
[1:11:07] is whoredom
[1:11:11] whoredom
[1:11:13] is prostitution
[1:11:15] it speaks of an immoral woman
[1:11:18] now the Bible Likens the church
[1:11:20] as being a woman
[1:11:23] the Bible calls the Catholic Church a
[1:11:26] which is a woman immoral woman God sees
[1:11:30] her as a prostitute why because she's
[1:11:32] unfaithful to his word
[1:11:35] ain't that right
[1:11:37] and all denominations are her daughters
[1:11:41] and they're prostitutes
[1:11:43] because they're unfaithful
[1:11:45] to the word of God and yet they claim to
[1:11:48] be the Bride of Jesus Christ they deny
[1:11:51] the word the very God that they claim to
[1:11:54] serve he's the word and they deny the
[1:11:57] word ain't that right so as the Bible
[1:12:00] says they have a form of godliness but
[1:12:02] denying the power thereof amen they deny
[1:12:05] the power that heals the sick they deny
[1:12:07] the power that raises the dead they deny
[1:12:09] the power to cast out demons they they
[1:12:12] deny that Supernatural power that
[1:12:15] changes a sinner into a saint
[1:12:18] ain't that right amen they deny it see
[1:12:21] they deny it now they're teaching their
[1:12:23] people amen how to cope with their
[1:12:25] problems ain't that right hey hey yeah
[1:12:28] uh uh a a is becoming more welcome in
[1:12:32] churches their programs in the churches
[1:12:34] amen because that that's their idea of
[1:12:38] fixing people's problems that ain't the
[1:12:40] idea of fixing people's problems get the
[1:12:43] supernatural back in the in the church
[1:12:48] and you say Amen
[1:12:50] well if you're a Believer you can say
[1:12:52] Amen to that because it's the truth
[1:12:55] Jesus didn't tell us to go out and and
[1:12:57] preach the gospel and come up with these
[1:12:59] man-made ideas
[1:13:01] man-made programs we were to preach the
[1:13:04] gospel and lay hands on the sick and
[1:13:06] they shall recover
[1:13:08] to cast The Devils out and they would
[1:13:10] flee
[1:13:13] ain't that right
[1:13:15] yes sir so we find amen that that we are
[1:13:20] to preach the gospel
[1:13:22] now now Paul tells us what it means to
[1:13:25] preach the gospel First Corinthians 2
[1:13:27] and 4 and my speech and my preaching was
[1:13:30] not with enticing words of man's Wisdom
[1:13:33] but in demonstration of the spirit and
[1:13:35] the power
[1:13:36] notice why that your faith should not
[1:13:40] rest uh or stand in the wisdom of men
[1:13:44] but in the power of God ain't that right
[1:13:48] amen not in the personalities of men not
[1:13:51] not in in in in anything but the power
[1:13:55] of God
[1:13:59] and he says so he says my speech am I
[1:14:02] preaching was not with enticing words of
[1:14:05] man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the
[1:14:07] spirit and the power now notice Paul in
[1:14:10] writing to the galatian church said in
[1:14:13] Galatians 1 and 6 I Marvel that you are
[1:14:16] so soon removed from him that called you
[1:14:19] into the grace of Christ unto another
[1:14:22] gospel now Paul was telling what gospel
[1:14:25] he preached it was one with
[1:14:26] demonstration and one with power ain't
[1:14:29] that right hey man he wasn't just given
[1:14:31] a theological sermon he wasn't given a
[1:14:33] little sermon Ed a little Sunday school
[1:14:35] lesson no it was priests with power and
[1:14:39] demonstration
[1:14:41] ain't that right and he says now he's
[1:14:44] looking at the galatian church and they
[1:14:46] were moved he said removed from him that
[1:14:48] called them into the grace of Christ
[1:14:50] unto another gospel which is not another
[1:14:53] God now which is not another but there
[1:14:55] be some that trouble you and would
[1:14:57] pervert the gospel of Christ but though
[1:15:00] we or an angel from heaven preach any
[1:15:03] other gospel unto you than that which we
[1:15:05] have preached unto you let him be
[1:15:07] accursed as we said before so say I
[1:15:10] again if any man preach any other gospel
[1:15:13] unto you then then that you have
[1:15:16] received let him be accursed ain't that
[1:15:20] right so what was that other gospel that
[1:15:23] Paul was referring to that they they
[1:15:25] have turned brother Brown said it was a
[1:15:27] make-belief gospel to a denominational
[1:15:30] fiction turning from that good news
[1:15:33] ain't that right and more people have
[1:15:36] turned away from the good news listen to
[1:15:39] some fiction of some God of a historical
[1:15:43] God Amen that can't do nothing else
[1:15:45] today
[1:15:49] ain't that right well they turn from the
[1:15:52] good news and what is the good news what
[1:15:55] is the gospel it's the good news and
[1:15:58] what's the good news he has risen
[1:16:00] he's alive
[1:16:02] he's he he he's he's here today ain't
[1:16:05] that right brother Brown said the Social
[1:16:07] Gospel will not meet the challenge of
[1:16:09] the age
[1:16:10] it will not meet the challenge of this
[1:16:12] day you can never come into the promise
[1:16:15] of land of of the promised land the
[1:16:18] promises of God and overcome the Devil
[1:16:21] by a social gospel we are facing a
[1:16:24] powerful enemy it's the worst darkest
[1:16:26] age the most evil age ever amen and it's
[1:16:30] in this age we've got to have something
[1:16:32] to meet the enemy with
[1:16:37] Daniel 11 32 the people that do know
[1:16:39] their God shall do be strong
[1:16:41] and do exploits great exploits
[1:16:45] ain't that right
[1:16:46] now God himself is phenomenal
[1:16:49] amen he's a Creator being he's Jehovah
[1:16:52] he is the great reality he is the
[1:16:55] substance of everything that was made on
[1:16:57] the Earth
[1:16:58] the Bible says for all things were made
[1:17:00] by him and for him so we we look and you
[1:17:05] can see the power of God God every
[1:17:07] morning God shows his power by raising
[1:17:11] the Sun up every morning
[1:17:13] God chose His power Amen in the
[1:17:16] springtime amen when when things are so
[1:17:19] dead and Bleak and looks like there's no
[1:17:21] hope but wait till the spring comes and
[1:17:23] God shows his power amen and it in it's
[1:17:26] it's a it's a it's it's it's a type amen
[1:17:30] of the Resurrection Life a man that is
[1:17:32] in the bride amen see he displays his
[1:17:35] power by sending the Reigns amen setting
[1:17:39] his rainbows in the sky he displays his
[1:17:41] power amen by coming down to his
[1:17:44] subjects and healing their sickness and
[1:17:46] saving their sins ain't that right see
[1:17:49] there's God everywhere showing his power
[1:17:52] amen and as the prophet said it always
[1:17:55] takes amen the miraculous Amen to to
[1:17:59] show the omnipotence or to speak of
[1:18:02] omnipotence amen he says omnipotence is
[1:18:05] the all-powerful and it takes the
[1:18:08] miraculous to vindicate the omnipotence
[1:18:10] ain't that right amen it's good to come
[1:18:12] to church but that's not what vindicates
[1:18:15] the omnipotence it's good to learn about
[1:18:18] God but that's not what it takes to
[1:18:20] vindicate the omnipotence amen and if we
[1:18:23] believe that the omnipotence is in US
[1:18:25] amen then God works the miraculous
[1:18:28] through us to vindicate the omnipotence
[1:18:31] can you say Amen yes sir that's why
[1:18:34] we're not looking for any other Jesus
[1:18:36] we're not looking for any other message
[1:18:38] we've seen the Vindication of
[1:18:40] omnipotence through the ministry of
[1:18:41] brother Branham
[1:18:44] ain't that right and I believe it's
[1:18:46] through the bride as well so only the
[1:18:48] miraculous can do that teaching of the
[1:18:50] word is a very fine thing it comes see
[1:18:53] uh Faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[1:18:55] the word but it always everybody say it
[1:18:58] always takes the miraculous to vindicate
[1:19:01] that the omnipotent still lives and
[1:19:03] Reigns we must everybody say we must
[1:19:06] have the miraculous
[1:19:09] we must have the miraculous ain't that
[1:19:13] right I know you preachers believe that
[1:19:15] right amen we must have the miraculous
[1:19:18] amen nothing else is going to work don't
[1:19:20] be satisfied with just having a form of
[1:19:22] godliness don't be satisfied with just
[1:19:25] reading this Bible all all year long
[1:19:27] don't just be satisfied with knowing the
[1:19:29] the quotes you must have the miraculous
[1:19:34] ain't that right
[1:19:36] the prophet said God cannot be
[1:19:38] Supernatural without being omnipotent
[1:19:40] but it takes the miraculous to vindicate
[1:19:43] the omnipotence and this is why we
[1:19:45] believe the message is Jesus Christ
[1:19:47] because the omnipotence has been
[1:19:49] thoroughly Vindicated not not man
[1:19:52] Ministry but Jesus Christ has been
[1:19:55] thoroughly Vindicated by the message of
[1:19:58] the hour can you say amen that's right
[1:20:01] and by this message We Know by what
[1:20:03] we've seen amen we know that Jesus
[1:20:05] Christ is alive and well today now in
[1:20:09] 1956 brother Brown said I believe that
[1:20:12] the church is now standing on the
[1:20:14] threshold of the greatest Vindication of
[1:20:18] omnipotence that the world the world has
[1:20:21] ever known
[1:20:23] ah
[1:20:24] to me that's that's powerful
[1:20:26] because you you creation was one thing
[1:20:29] and and and what what what a what a show
[1:20:33] of omnipotence
[1:20:34] at creation
[1:20:36] God takes nothing and makes it right
[1:20:38] look look at all down Through the Ages
[1:20:41] even into the life of Jesus walking on
[1:20:44] water turning water into wine raising
[1:20:46] the dead him himself raising from the
[1:20:49] dead and all the things that he'd done
[1:20:52] amen look at what Paul done look what
[1:20:54] was in the book of Acts look at
[1:20:55] everything that that was done Through
[1:20:57] the Ages and yet the prophet would tell
[1:20:59] us we're on the threshold of the
[1:21:01] greatest Vindication of omnipotence that
[1:21:04] the world has ever known
[1:21:06] and to think of it you're part of it
[1:21:12] we're part of this
[1:21:14] so see man has to recognize the
[1:21:16] omnipotence the prophet said before when
[1:21:19] it's before him man has to recognize it
[1:21:22] when it's before him amen so we are as
[1:21:26] Jesus said there in Matthew 13 16 but
[1:21:29] bless are your eyes for they see and
[1:21:32] your ears for they hear
[1:21:34] you're not looking at the omnipotence
[1:21:36] and saying well that's of the devil
[1:21:38] that's Beelzebub that's this but now
[1:21:40] you're able to see that this is the
[1:21:42] Vindication amen of what the prophets
[1:21:45] have talked about it's it's what the
[1:21:47] prophets have longed for amen it's the
[1:21:49] writers have ruled about this amen it's
[1:21:51] the greatest vindication
[1:21:54] so throughout the the scriptures we can
[1:21:56] see that God chose
[1:21:59] to show people his Supernatural his his
[1:22:02] omnipotence miraculous power
[1:22:06] uh to and through them
[1:22:09] God would choose certain people for this
[1:22:11] look at Abraham Abraham was one of them
[1:22:14] nothing special about Abraham
[1:22:17] uh uh he was he was an idolter
[1:22:21] you know and and he was just normal man
[1:22:24] and and and caught up in idolatry and
[1:22:28] all these things following the paths of
[1:22:30] a family tree
[1:22:31] coming through this this is all he
[1:22:33] knowed
[1:22:34] amen his thoughts wasn't even on God
[1:22:38] and and these things and just worship
[1:22:40] will is worshiper but probably
[1:22:42] worshiping some other God Amen his
[1:22:44] thoughts on the gods that he worship not
[1:22:46] the Almighty
[1:22:47] but see God had elected Abraham before
[1:22:49] the foundation of the world
[1:22:51] a man and he elected Abraham for a
[1:22:54] reason to show his omnipotence
[1:22:56] to show that he's alive
[1:22:58] and not only that but he would take
[1:23:00] Abraham and show through Abraham about
[1:23:02] this day
[1:23:04] you believe that
[1:23:05] Avery God would show through Abraham
[1:23:08] what he would do in this age I think
[1:23:11] that's powerful
[1:23:12] so Abraham didn't deserve it but God
[1:23:15] chose him so God called him amen told
[1:23:18] him get out of your land come out of
[1:23:19] your land Exodus come out you know come
[1:23:22] out you know from the your Kindred come
[1:23:24] out from the land come out from
[1:23:25] everything he was to separate he was to
[1:23:28] separate from his Heathen ways he was to
[1:23:31] separate from the the his Heathen
[1:23:33] friends and family he was to separate
[1:23:36] from his Heathen ideas and thoughts he
[1:23:39] was to separate from his Heathen worship
[1:23:41] amen because God is not going to share
[1:23:44] his glory with another
[1:23:46] ain't that wrong amen so God chose
[1:23:49] Abraham to show his mighty power and God
[1:23:52] didn't want anything else laying claim
[1:23:54] to Abraham
[1:23:56] amen God didn't want anything else to
[1:23:58] lay claim to to the experience that
[1:24:00] Abraham a man would receive he didn't
[1:24:03] want unbelief hanging on to Abraham he
[1:24:06] didn't want Heathen traits and
[1:24:07] traditions hanging on a man see anything
[1:24:10] that was against God and that would try
[1:24:13] to take the place of God Abraham was to
[1:24:17] separate from
[1:24:21] why God wanted to walk with Abraham
[1:24:24] God wanted Abraham to walk with him to
[1:24:27] talk with him to experience him
[1:24:29] ain't that right to believe him
[1:24:32] and he didn't want other other gods
[1:24:35] to come in between
[1:24:37] the relationship that would be
[1:24:39] established between him and Abraham
[1:24:42] ain't that right God wanted to establish
[1:24:44] a relationship with Abraham just the
[1:24:47] same as he wants to establish a
[1:24:49] relationship with all of us and he
[1:24:51] doesn't want any other thing to come in
[1:24:53] between that relationship he doesn't
[1:24:55] want any other God to get Glory he
[1:24:57] doesn't want any other object to get
[1:24:59] glory amen he wants to have the glory
[1:25:01] amen in your life
[1:25:05] therefore it would take complete trust
[1:25:07] and confidence
[1:25:09] on Abraham's part
[1:25:12] see you have to believe in the
[1:25:14] Supernatural if you're going to see the
[1:25:16] supernatural
[1:25:17] you're going to have to trust in the
[1:25:20] Supernatural if you're going to see the
[1:25:22] supernatural you're going to have to
[1:25:25] walk with the supernatural if you're
[1:25:26] going to walk with God
[1:25:28] ain't that right and have a relationship
[1:25:30] with him
[1:25:31] now as God has shown to Abraham and
[1:25:34] everybody everyone else down Through the
[1:25:35] Ages
[1:25:36] amen God will put you through the test
[1:25:39] that means I've been through tests
[1:25:41] he'll put you through testing times
[1:25:43] he'll put you through trials he'll put
[1:25:46] you to where your back is against the
[1:25:47] wall
[1:25:48] he'll put you where you don't know your
[1:25:50] future you at once thought you knew your
[1:25:53] future
[1:25:54] you had once thought you know that that
[1:25:57] you had everything secure but then God
[1:26:00] allows you to come into the situation to
[1:26:01] where you don't know anything anymore
[1:26:05] have you ever just been there if you
[1:26:06] ever just said well I just don't know
[1:26:07] anything about anything anymore
[1:26:09] I don't even know what happened next
[1:26:12] well I've been there
[1:26:15] God allows these things
[1:26:17] to happen
[1:26:18] because God don't want you to get the
[1:26:21] glory
[1:26:22] God don't want you to flaunt your own
[1:26:24] self
[1:26:25] your own talents your own ability your
[1:26:28] own wits
[1:26:30] we're not holding ourselves by our wits
[1:26:35] can you say Amen
[1:26:37] so God will put you bring you face to
[1:26:39] face with things that you cannot
[1:26:41] overcome in your own strengths
[1:26:45] he will give you promises
[1:26:48] that you know yourself or you will
[1:26:52] eventually come to know
[1:26:55] that you cannot fulfill these promises
[1:26:58] in your own strength
[1:27:01] can you say Amen
[1:27:03] so this is why you have to be separated
[1:27:05] from everything that would cause you not
[1:27:07] to believe God
[1:27:11] ain't that right
[1:27:13] seek God God wants you to be separated
[1:27:16] so God requires a total separation from
[1:27:20] all unbelief
[1:27:21] brother Graham says when God shows
[1:27:23] Supernatural with his word he expects
[1:27:26] you to believe it don't question it
[1:27:29] believe it
[1:27:34] can you say Amen
[1:27:36] now listen church if you're part of the
[1:27:38] message it should be because you're the
[1:27:41] result of believing the supernatural
[1:27:44] your your faith should be should be uh
[1:27:48] built upon the supernatural
[1:27:53] can you say Amen
[1:27:55] that's right because you can take bro
[1:27:57] you can say well brother Brown said
[1:27:59] adoption all that and still not believe
[1:28:00] it in your heart
[1:28:02] then you'll question it the longer it
[1:28:04] goes the longer you don't see things
[1:28:06] going on in your life and the more
[1:28:07] problems you have and the more faults
[1:28:09] you have and the more this and Humanity
[1:28:11] you see you'll actually start
[1:28:13] questioning what he said about it all
[1:28:15] right therefore you have to have faith
[1:28:17] in the Supernatural
[1:28:19] can you say Amen
[1:28:20] and that seems Supernatural That's why
[1:28:22] brother Brown would tell us the angel of
[1:28:24] the the the what the angel of the Lord
[1:28:27] follows this message always accompanies
[1:28:30] the message always can you say Amen so
[1:28:33] the Supernatural is with the believer
[1:28:35] today
[1:28:36] ain't that Ryan see so when God shows
[1:28:39] the supernatural with his word not just
[1:28:42] anything not blood coming out of the
[1:28:43] hands and and the oil falling and coming
[1:28:46] out of the forehead and all that jazz
[1:28:47] you understand what I'm saying amen that
[1:28:49] that stuff people follow we ought to be
[1:28:52] beyond that
[1:28:53] I don't care what prophet comes along
[1:28:58] God will show his Supernatural with his
[1:29:00] word
[1:29:02] he expects you to believe it he had
[1:29:05] promised Abraham and then he by
[1:29:08] Supernatural had proved it to Abraham
[1:29:11] can you say Amen so see the the the
[1:29:14] promises that God gave Abraham were
[1:29:17] Beyond Abraham's ability to fulfill
[1:29:19] yes sir amen God promised that he would
[1:29:22] be the father of many nations and yet
[1:29:24] Abraham had no child he could not have a
[1:29:27] child and not through Sarah anyways and
[1:29:29] God promised that the the child would
[1:29:31] come through Sarah
[1:29:33] ain't that right amen that's right see
[1:29:36] and here Sarah is not able to have it
[1:29:38] but the Bible says Abraham believed God
[1:29:45] ain't that right Abraham believed God
[1:29:48] before he saw the supernatural at work
[1:29:51] in his life he believed God
[1:29:56] amen he was a believer
[1:29:59] so every promise that God gave Abraham
[1:30:01] he believed it he didn't consider how
[1:30:04] impossible it was for it to happen
[1:30:08] he just believed God
[1:30:11] gave it and it was up to God to take
[1:30:14] care of it
[1:30:18] he counted God Faithful that promised
[1:30:21] the Bible says he considered not his own
[1:30:23] body now dead
[1:30:24] considered not the deadness of Sarah's
[1:30:26] womb ain't that right
[1:30:28] even Paul said of Abraham in Romans 4
[1:30:31] and 20 he staggered not at the promise
[1:30:34] of God through unbelief but was strong
[1:30:36] in faith given glory to God
[1:30:38] being fully persuaded that what God had
[1:30:43] promised he was also able to perform why
[1:30:48] he saw God as Supernatural
[1:30:55] so Abraham had fully separated from the
[1:30:58] voices of unbelief
[1:31:00] just like we've got to today
[1:31:02] separate from any voice of unbelief any
[1:31:05] thought of unbelief he was full of faith
[1:31:09] ain't that right
[1:31:11] yeah you might say well he lied he
[1:31:13] disobeyed he got out of the will of God
[1:31:15] he left the promise and and went into
[1:31:17] Egypt and all these things and yes he
[1:31:19] did
[1:31:20] but you know what in the New Testament
[1:31:22] that was that was before the blood in
[1:31:25] the New Testament you never find
[1:31:26] anything like that
[1:31:28] hello when the atonement of Jesus Christ
[1:31:31] was shed and provided you never found
[1:31:33] Abraham as a liar then
[1:31:35] you found Abraham as being fully
[1:31:38] persuaded that God was able to keep his
[1:31:40] word
[1:31:43] Abraham even laughed at God the Bible
[1:31:44] says that Abraham laughed at God not
[1:31:47] only Sarah Abraham laughed at God
[1:31:50] can you say man yes sir but Abraham was
[1:31:54] strong in faith now look in Genesis 12
[1:31:57] and 7 we read and the Lord appeared unto
[1:32:00] Abram and said unto thy seed will I give
[1:32:02] this land
[1:32:04] Genesis 13 15 and for all the land which
[1:32:08] thou seest to thee will I give it and
[1:32:12] divine seed forever and I will make thy
[1:32:15] seed as the dust of the earth so that if
[1:32:17] a man can number the dust of the earth
[1:32:19] uh uh then shall thy seed also be
[1:32:23] numbered ain't that right now and they
[1:32:25] yet that promise was given to Sarah and
[1:32:28] yet Sarah knew she was convinced that it
[1:32:31] could she herself could not fulfill that
[1:32:34] promise now we know that Sarah being
[1:32:37] convinced of that and and discouraged in
[1:32:39] her heart she convinced Abraham to go to
[1:32:42] go into Hagar
[1:32:44] which produced Ishmael ain't that right
[1:32:47] but notice how God done it it would not
[1:32:50] be on human effort
[1:32:51] amen here it was Abraham's effort that
[1:32:54] produced Ishmael
[1:32:55] amen see the the the promise being
[1:32:58] doubted but God told Abraham no Ishmael
[1:33:01] will not be your seed that's not the one
[1:33:02] I'm talking about amen see I'm at the
[1:33:05] end and then it's true now Ishmael was
[1:33:08] not the promise seed the seed was to
[1:33:10] come through Sarah
[1:33:14] ain't that right no human effort
[1:33:18] this was going to take a supernatural
[1:33:20] thing
[1:33:21] and you realize that's what it's going
[1:33:23] to be for this rapture
[1:33:24] it's what it's going to be for anything
[1:33:26] you get in god it's not going to be by
[1:33:28] your efforts it's not going to be by
[1:33:30] anything else but it's by believing the
[1:33:32] word of God God said it he promised it I
[1:33:35] believe it it's going to be done
[1:33:37] God can't back upon his word
[1:33:39] can you say Amen
[1:33:41] yes sir
[1:33:43] see you must not get in a hurry
[1:33:47] I'll close in just a minute but you
[1:33:49] you're not to get in a hurry and tried
[1:33:52] to produce the promise on your own
[1:33:55] it ain't gonna work
[1:33:58] ain't that right
[1:33:59] ain't gonna work see because only the
[1:34:02] supernatural can finish can can do it
[1:34:05] God gave Abraham the promise when he was
[1:34:07] 75 years old
[1:34:10] and then God Waits
[1:34:13] until Abraham gets into the into a
[1:34:16] condition
[1:34:17] to where he's dried up there's no way he
[1:34:20] could have a child
[1:34:22] right
[1:34:24] yeah he's he's what uh 95 99 99
[1:34:31] and then here's Sarah a few years
[1:34:33] younger than him
[1:34:37] and God's taking his time
[1:34:39] but Abraham as time went never looked at
[1:34:43] it
[1:34:43] he looked at the promise
[1:34:47] then you say Amen
[1:34:49] you know I I know this is simple and and
[1:34:51] yet I'm hoping it's it's going to be a
[1:34:54] help to you
[1:34:55] but if we can trust the supernatural
[1:34:59] then no matter how long the promise
[1:35:01] Waits
[1:35:03] no matter how long it takes
[1:35:05] we can still be at rest knowing it's
[1:35:08] going to happen
[1:35:13] ain't that right
[1:35:16] but we find see so so the age had
[1:35:19] nothing to do with the promise of God
[1:35:20] because God wanted it in that way
[1:35:23] because it would take the miraculous
[1:35:25] now notice Genesis 17 15 and God said
[1:35:29] unto Abraham as for Sarah thy wife thou
[1:35:32] shall not call her name Sarai but Sarah
[1:35:35] shall be her name
[1:35:37] and I will bless her and give thee a son
[1:35:41] also of her yea I will bless her and she
[1:35:46] will be a shall be a mother of Nations
[1:35:48] Kings of people shall be of her
[1:35:52] ain't that right but it's gonna be not
[1:35:56] by my nor by power but by my spirit
[1:35:58] saith the Lord
[1:36:01] then Abraham fell upon his face and
[1:36:03] laughed
[1:36:04] and said in his heart shall a child be
[1:36:07] born unto him that is a hundred years
[1:36:09] old and shall Sarah that is 90 years old
[1:36:13] sit bear see and Abraham said unto God
[1:36:16] all that Ishmael might live before thee
[1:36:22] have we ever just given god's second
[1:36:24] choice
[1:36:26] it says God if you could just do a
[1:36:28] little bit with me
[1:36:30] if you could just take one little bit
[1:36:32] you can use then that's fine
[1:36:34] you can just take one little towel and
[1:36:36] what little thing and yet God says no
[1:36:39] we're gonna settle for that
[1:36:41] I've called you to be my bride
[1:36:44] and every promise that I've declared
[1:36:46] I've declared it for you
[1:36:50] even God Abraham couldn't change God's
[1:36:53] mind
[1:36:56] ain't that right
[1:36:59] so he goes in and he says see the 20th
[1:37:02] verse and as for Ishmael I have heard
[1:37:05] thee behold uh uh or actually let's go
[1:37:08] up oh that Ishmael might live before the
[1:37:10] 19th verse and God said Sarah thy wife
[1:37:13] shall bear thee a son indeed and thou
[1:37:15] shalt call his name Isaac and I will
[1:37:18] establish my Covenant with him for an
[1:37:20] Everlasting Covenant and with this seed
[1:37:22] after him and as for Ishmael I have
[1:37:25] heard thee behold I have blessed him and
[1:37:28] will make him fruitful and will multiply
[1:37:30] him exceedingly twelve princes shall he
[1:37:32] beget and I will make him a great nation
[1:37:34] but my Covenant I will establish with
[1:37:38] Isaac which Sarah shall bear unto thee
[1:37:41] at this set time in the next year
[1:37:44] ain't that right
[1:37:46] and then we find out again Genesis 18
[1:37:49] 10-14
[1:37:50] Melchizedek appears to Abraham and gives
[1:37:53] him the same promise
[1:37:55] I'm going to visit thee
[1:37:58] ain't that right why because God's going
[1:38:01] to show his his omnipotent power
[1:38:03] and God did and she had a son and God
[1:38:06] changed their body
[1:38:09] ain't that right change them from being
[1:38:11] old uh from old to young again and
[1:38:15] change the condition
[1:38:17] to where she could have a child
[1:38:20] ain't that right
[1:38:23] they couldn't explain how it happened
[1:38:24] they just knew it happened
[1:38:26] and that's the same way with us
[1:38:28] everything that was there brother Brown
[1:38:30] said it was the show about us that God's
[1:38:33] going to change our mortal bodies
[1:38:35] God's going to change us it looks
[1:38:37] impossible I understand that but that's
[1:38:39] not what we're looking at we're looking
[1:38:40] at the supernatural God
[1:38:43] can you say man yes sir do you love the
[1:38:46] Lord
[1:38:47] amen see we can't even begin to explain
[1:38:50] the supernatural brother Bram said we
[1:38:53] cannot bring God down to our level of
[1:38:55] thinking we've got to rise ourselves to
[1:38:57] his level of thinking and meet him on
[1:39:00] the grounds that he provided for us to
[1:39:03] meet him on ain't that right so we see
[1:39:06] the seed that God promised was both
[1:39:09] natural and spiritual Supernatural
[1:39:12] Israel was the natural lineage of
[1:39:15] Abraham and of course as God as always
[1:39:18] he's dealt with Israel as a nation ain't
[1:39:21] that right and notice what he tells them
[1:39:24] Isaiah 43 and 1. and and if you've
[1:39:27] noticed God never forgot his Covenant
[1:39:30] with Abraham Abraham's long gone and yet
[1:39:34] he still has never forgot his Covenant
[1:39:37] and even today he still hasn't forgot
[1:39:40] his Covenant amen with that natural seed
[1:39:42] but if God won't forget his natural seed
[1:39:46] then what about the Covenant with the
[1:39:48] supernatural seed
[1:39:50] God won't forget
[1:39:52] now Isaiah 43 1 but now thus saith the
[1:39:56] Lord that created the old Jacob and he
[1:39:59] that formed the O Israel fear not for I
[1:40:01] have redeemed Thee I have called thee by
[1:40:03] thy name Thou Art mine
[1:40:07] can you say man when did he become years
[1:40:10] before the foundation of the world
[1:40:12] Thou Art mine
[1:40:14] he left it called
[1:40:17] amen and look in in numbers 24 9 God
[1:40:21] tells Israel just that natural seed
[1:40:23] blessed is he that blesseth thee and
[1:40:26] cursed is he that curse of Thee my
[1:40:29] that's just to a natural people
[1:40:32] ain't that right but God had called them
[1:40:34] for his own purpose to show his
[1:40:37] Supernatural power
[1:40:40] Deuteronomy 30 and 6. he says to Israel
[1:40:43] the Lord thy God will put all these
[1:40:46] curses upon thine enemies and on them
[1:40:48] that hate thee which persecuted thee
[1:40:51] ain't that right so we see that Israel
[1:40:53] is God's chosen people a natural people
[1:40:56] a natural seed but yet God would choose
[1:40:59] them to show his omnipotent power
[1:41:04] and did he do it
[1:41:05] yes he did
[1:41:07] look at the Covenant Genesis 22 17 God
[1:41:10] said to Abraham thy seed shall possess
[1:41:13] the gates of thine enemies ain't that
[1:41:15] right of his enemies that's right and
[1:41:18] that seed was not a super seed that seed
[1:41:21] was just a natural seed ain't that right
[1:41:23] but God would show amen by a natural
[1:41:27] seed his Supernatural power a natural
[1:41:30] lineage yet a people that God would
[1:41:33] choose and God would allow them to get
[1:41:35] their back against the wall he would
[1:41:37] allow them to go into Egypt and become
[1:41:39] slaves yet that he could bring them out
[1:41:42] by a mighty hand amen God always
[1:41:45] delivered Israel by his Supernatural
[1:41:48] power
[1:41:49] do you believe that that's why I love
[1:41:51] just reading about the stories amen of
[1:41:54] what God done in Samson's life what he
[1:41:56] done in Gideon's life what he done amen
[1:41:59] by uh rolling back the Red Sea what he
[1:42:02] done Amen in Joshua's life what he done
[1:42:05] in in in in in all the lives of his
[1:42:08] people because they were a covenant
[1:42:10] people that God would show his
[1:42:12] omnipotent through
[1:42:16] I know
[1:42:17] it sounds impossible
[1:42:20] now a man could take an ox golden kill
[1:42:22] 600 soldiers I believe it was
[1:42:27] amen he could kill them one man
[1:42:30] that was a farmer and killed these
[1:42:32] well-trained soldiers
[1:42:35] but he was a covenant person
[1:42:38] he was a person that had a covenant with
[1:42:40] God that God made a covenant with ain't
[1:42:43] that right and thy seed shall possess
[1:42:46] the Gate of his enemy ain't that right
[1:42:49] yes sir so we're looking at all of these
[1:42:52] things even how that he calls an ax head
[1:42:55] to swim
[1:42:56] amen because a covenant man needed it a
[1:43:00] man that God had made Covenant with he
[1:43:02] was in that Covenant and he needed that
[1:43:04] that's it
[1:43:07] and God provided it
[1:43:09] ain't that right God sent fire down from
[1:43:12] heaven
[1:43:13] oh my just because a prophet of God
[1:43:16] called down called it down
[1:43:18] he Vindicated it Israel was so
[1:43:22] Vindicated the people of God was
[1:43:24] Vindicated by God ain't that right
[1:43:27] yes sir
[1:43:29] oh do you love him
[1:43:31] these people were just mortal men they
[1:43:32] knew what it was to fear they knew what
[1:43:34] it was to be scared
[1:43:35] they knew what it was to go through
[1:43:37] trials and sufferings they had their
[1:43:39] faults and failures that's Balaam Balaam
[1:43:41] could tell you all about that
[1:43:43] amen he thought it was surely a holy God
[1:43:46] couldn't could not have uh any any
[1:43:48] dealings with these people amen see and
[1:43:51] he was going to curse him
[1:43:54] but the prophet said he failed to see
[1:43:55] the the smitten Rock the Brazen serpent
[1:43:58] the atonement he's looking at it through
[1:44:00] a moral standpoint ain't that right but
[1:44:04] it was God that had called these people
[1:44:06] for his glory
[1:44:08] we may not be much in the world's eyes
[1:44:11] but we are much in God's eyes
[1:44:13] can you say Amen
[1:44:18] God proved that they were part of that
[1:44:21] Covenant he watched over them by the
[1:44:23] supernatural he cared for them by the
[1:44:25] supernatural he lived with them
[1:44:27] with the the in the in the Supernatural
[1:44:31] form of the pillar of Fire
[1:44:33] a man see but then as the prophet would
[1:44:35] tell us there came that rule seat of
[1:44:37] Abraham and as I get ready to close
[1:44:40] but Jesus Christ The Royal Seed of
[1:44:43] Abraham which is of the faith Seed of
[1:44:45] Abraham he was the supersede ain't that
[1:44:48] right and what was he going to do he was
[1:44:50] not going to produce a natural lineage
[1:44:52] he was going to produce a spiritual
[1:44:53] lineage which be which would be a super
[1:44:56] race in this age
[1:44:58] a super people
[1:45:03] aren't you glad for that
[1:45:05] you know what the bride the prophet
[1:45:07] calls you the supernatural bride of
[1:45:08] Christ
[1:45:09] Supernatural
[1:45:11] ain't that right
[1:45:12] amen so here he was the super seed made
[1:45:16] flesh
[1:45:17] God in Christ reconciling the world to
[1:45:19] himself
[1:45:21] ain't that right
[1:45:23] and so we find as as we talked about
[1:45:25] before you know it where the Bible says
[1:45:29] that that God took on the form of man
[1:45:32] did not take on the form of a plant
[1:45:36] did not take on the form of a tree
[1:45:39] did not take on the form of an animal
[1:45:43] but God would take on the form of a man
[1:45:50] not to become human life
[1:45:54] but that his life
[1:45:56] would come in the form of a body
[1:45:59] human body
[1:46:03] amen
[1:46:07] so we find
[1:46:10] he took on the form of a servant and was
[1:46:13] made in the likeness of men he was found
[1:46:15] in fashion as a man didn't even take on
[1:46:18] the form of angels that he was made in
[1:46:20] the likeness of sinful flesh
[1:46:23] ain't that right
[1:46:25] and so here the Greek word uh form as we
[1:46:28] said last Sunday means amorpha brother
[1:46:31] Brian said that means he changed himself
[1:46:33] he came down and he changed himself from
[1:46:36] what he was to what he is or changed his
[1:46:39] Mass to another Act
[1:46:41] and he came to take him someone himself
[1:46:44] the full form of man body Soul spirit
[1:46:50] to redeem the full form of man back to
[1:46:54] God
[1:46:55] that's why he came in flesh and in Soul
[1:46:58] can you say Amen
[1:47:00] so there as a man he hungered he
[1:47:02] thirsted he cried he he he
[1:47:05] died and and he went and and he felt the
[1:47:09] pain but yet the prophet said he was
[1:47:12] born amen with the power in his veins to
[1:47:16] conquer death and Hell
[1:47:19] he was the super seed
[1:47:21] he was born by a supernatural birth
[1:47:25] ain't that right
[1:47:27] born by a supernatural birth in
[1:47:29] Revelations 3 14 says he is the
[1:47:32] beginning of the creation of God
[1:47:37] brother Graham said how could God be
[1:47:39] created he is a spirit he's eternal he
[1:47:43] said he he never was created and never
[1:47:45] will be created because God is is at the
[1:47:48] beginning
[1:47:49] but he that is the beginning of the
[1:47:51] creation of God was Jesus Christ when he
[1:47:53] was made manifest when God lived in him
[1:47:55] he is God's creation
[1:47:59] aren't you glad for that
[1:48:01] he is God's creation
[1:48:03] what do you think you are
[1:48:06] amen
[1:48:07] see he's the first the last the amen the
[1:48:11] beginning of the creation of God when
[1:48:13] God created himself a body he come down
[1:48:15] and lived in it that's the beginning of
[1:48:17] the creation of God
[1:48:19] God came into this little sailing to
[1:48:21] begin to develop cells Drew from his
[1:48:23] mother's vitamins and things then when
[1:48:25] he become old enough to eat himself he
[1:48:27] began to eat and what is that it's the
[1:48:30] dust of the earth which you come up and
[1:48:32] plant life and animal life and so forth
[1:48:34] and as he began to eat the fish and the
[1:48:36] bread and so forth it began to develop
[1:48:38] cells and then when it's fully matured
[1:48:41] at 30 years old he was baptized into
[1:48:43] obedience to God in the water and went
[1:48:46] out and what happened the dove which was
[1:48:48] God descending from heaven with the
[1:48:50] voice saying this is my beloved Son in
[1:48:52] whom I'm pleased to dwell
[1:48:55] ain't that right
[1:48:58] so so only Christ
[1:49:01] amen only in Christ is God a creation
[1:49:06] ain't that right amen in Christ amen is
[1:49:10] God a creation and he was that perfect
[1:49:12] Masterpiece now I'm trying to get
[1:49:15] somewhere right fast but God was created
[1:49:17] in human form in Christ Jesus his son
[1:49:20] God dwelt see he he built his uh
[1:49:24] Tabernacle of Flesh and Bones and lived
[1:49:26] in that Tabernacle God Emmanuel see God
[1:49:29] With Us he built himself a house to live
[1:49:32] in so he could reflect his word to his
[1:49:35] subjects through that you know what God
[1:49:38] is when you see Christ why he was the
[1:49:41] body of God
[1:49:44] it ain't that right
[1:49:45] now I'm glad to be a body of God
[1:49:48] I'm glad in this day that we can be the
[1:49:51] body of God
[1:49:53] that omnipotence the same omnipotence
[1:49:55] that was in Jesus Christ is now in the
[1:49:58] church today
[1:49:59] can you say man Jesus Christ was the
[1:50:01] body of God full of omnipotence when he
[1:50:04] spoke to the winds and the waves peace
[1:50:06] be still it happened why it was the
[1:50:08] creator speaking
[1:50:12] and the miraculous Vindicated it's to be
[1:50:14] so
[1:50:15] when he spoke at the winds at the grave
[1:50:18] of Lazarus it was omnipotent speaking
[1:50:20] and the miraculous Vindicated it to be
[1:50:23] so ain't that right even the Roman
[1:50:26] Centurion recognized the omnividence
[1:50:28] that was in Christ for he said just
[1:50:31] speak the word and my servant shall live
[1:50:34] an omnipotent spoke and the miraculous
[1:50:37] Vindicated it to be so
[1:50:39] ain't that right and God promised he
[1:50:42] would speak again in these last days
[1:50:47] every word in the Bible came from the
[1:50:49] omnipotent god brother Brown said when
[1:50:51] the omnipotent speaks from the Bible the
[1:50:53] miraculous will take place where that
[1:50:55] seed sets root in the heart of the man
[1:50:58] or woman it'll produce just exactly what
[1:51:01] the promise is because it's the word of
[1:51:04] omnipotent it has to can you say Amen if
[1:51:09] the musicians will come Jesus said that
[1:51:11] all power
[1:51:13] in heaven and in Earth is given unto me
[1:51:15] heal the sick he raised the Dead
[1:51:18] amen calls the blind eyes to see
[1:51:21] and notice he conquered the gates that
[1:51:24] the natural seed could never conquer
[1:51:27] I think that's powerful he conquered
[1:51:30] sickness
[1:51:31] he conquered death
[1:51:33] he conquered temptation
[1:51:36] when the enemy sped in his face smote
[1:51:39] his jaw he turned the other side when
[1:51:42] they jerked his beard from his face and
[1:51:44] spit on him he never riled back so he
[1:51:46] conquered the Gate of Temptation and
[1:51:48] took it
[1:51:49] see all those now notice what brother
[1:51:51] Brown says all of those back there in
[1:51:53] the Old Testament were just Shadows of
[1:51:57] his coming
[1:51:58] you seem conquered conquering through
[1:52:00] through Samson you see him conquering
[1:52:03] through David you seem conquering
[1:52:05] through Moses you seemed conquering
[1:52:07] through Joshua you see him conquering
[1:52:09] through all them saints Abode they were
[1:52:10] just Shadows of his coming what they
[1:52:13] conquered was testifying of a conqueror
[1:52:15] to come
[1:52:17] can you say Amen see they were just
[1:52:20] Shadows of his coming but when he come
[1:52:23] he finished the whole fight
[1:52:26] it's over
[1:52:28] that Calvary said it is finished
[1:52:31] ain't that right so the fight was
[1:52:33] finished at Gethsemane and at Calvary
[1:52:36] now we just stand as conquerors
[1:52:41] ain't that right
[1:52:43] oh think of it every gate of the enemy
[1:52:46] is possessed brother Brown said there's
[1:52:48] no fighting to do
[1:52:51] and you say that with me there's no
[1:52:52] fighting to do there's no fighting to do
[1:52:55] think of it
[1:52:57] see the fight's over
[1:52:59] we just own it
[1:53:02] every gate that that Christ overcome and
[1:53:05] conquered we just Own It abstract deed
[1:53:08] to it written a written guarantee by God
[1:53:11] our Father who raised his hand and said
[1:53:13] I'll swear by myself that his seat shall
[1:53:15] possess the Gate of the enemy and notice
[1:53:17] his seed capital S his seat Christ The
[1:53:21] Royal seed shall possess the Gate of the
[1:53:23] enemy and there it is it's already took
[1:53:26] he was wounded by our transgressions
[1:53:28] with the stripes we were healed it's
[1:53:30] already done it's a finished work we
[1:53:32] just possess it and the works that I do
[1:53:34] shall you do also
[1:53:37] can you say man that was not given to a
[1:53:41] natural seed that was given to you and I
[1:53:43] as the super seed
[1:53:45] Supernatural seed why because we're
[1:53:48] living on this side
[1:53:50] of every gate being conquered
[1:53:56] we're not seen by natural
[1:53:59] brother shalomy
[1:54:01] Isaac was seen by natural seed
[1:54:04] David all the natural seed
[1:54:07] but you know what we've received a
[1:54:08] supernatural birth
[1:54:10] Jesus Christ had a new Supernatural
[1:54:12] birth that's how he come
[1:54:14] and produce Jesus Christ the
[1:54:16] supernatural birth produce Jesus Christ
[1:54:18] and that's why you must have a birth it
[1:54:20] must be a supernatural birth not signing
[1:54:23] your name on a card not shaking a
[1:54:24] preacher's hand not coming to church for
[1:54:26] 10 years and then belonging to a church
[1:54:28] it not by knowing quotes not by reading
[1:54:30] the Bible once a year it's it's none of
[1:54:33] that it's by a supernatural birth that
[1:54:35] makes you part of this body of Jesus
[1:54:37] Christ and you're part of a supernatural
[1:54:41] Supernatural birth
[1:54:43] part of a supernatural God
[1:54:46] ain't that right you love him
[1:54:48] now notice he says the sacrifices paid
[1:54:51] the rule seed died the Royal seed rose
[1:54:53] again now the church stands justified by
[1:54:56] believing that
[1:54:58] and the Royal seed can come into these
[1:55:00] people think of it now the Royal seed
[1:55:03] can come into these people and even make
[1:55:05] them joint heirs Sons and Daughters of
[1:55:09] God
[1:55:10] notice what Paul says and from him to
[1:55:13] get many sons
[1:55:15] from him begat
[1:55:18] see Abraham begets Sons but this Royal
[1:55:21] seed begets Sons
[1:55:23] and we're part of that roll seed
[1:55:25] aren't you glad do you love him isn't he
[1:55:28] wonderful
[1:55:29] oh we can go on and on I appreciate your
[1:55:32] patience but I hope you understand hope
[1:55:34] you I hope it distracts A Fire Inside
[1:55:36] you amen no matter what demon you're
[1:55:39] facing you are the Royal seed of a man
[1:55:42] you are the supernatural
[1:55:44] we believe in the Supernatural because
[1:55:46] we're part of God
[1:55:47] and he is Supernatural
[1:55:49] and that's why we can say every promise
[1:55:51] in the book is mine
[1:55:55] not by power not by might
[1:55:57] but by my spirit saith the Lord
[1:56:00] amen you love him

[2:07:03] Hallelujah
[2:07:05] oh I love the Lord
[2:07:07] thinking of all the times
[2:07:10] you know I look at our elders and
[2:07:12] brother and sister Walker brother Terry
[2:07:15] sister Alice it's my Jane
[2:07:22] brother Bill the different ones
[2:07:29] thinking of the testimony that they are
[2:07:31] to us
[2:07:32] [Music]
[2:07:34] God's keeping power
[2:07:36] [Music]
[2:07:39] you know
[2:07:40] most of us I guess know a little bit
[2:07:42] about sister Alice's condition and
[2:07:44] brother Terry was just
[2:07:46] talking to us at lunch the other day
[2:07:48] about it
[2:07:51] you know that
[2:07:53] to a lot of people in that her condition
[2:07:57] it would be frightened they'd be scared
[2:07:59] they just they would probably give up on
[2:08:01] life so so many ways
[2:08:05] that I think of how she's
[2:08:09] always doing her best to come to the
[2:08:11] service to
[2:08:13] Worship the Lord to praise God and yet
[2:08:15] into all that condition
[2:08:17] fighting sicknesses and things like that
[2:08:23] sometimes we don't know what people go
[2:08:26] through but you young people if you
[2:08:29] could just know that
[2:08:32] our elders are not here by their own
[2:08:34] mind but all the testings that they've
[2:08:37] gone through and their heart is still so
[2:08:40] tender toward God they've never let
[2:08:42] their heart become hardened like the
[2:08:44] children of Israel
[2:08:46] and it's it's it's it's something and
[2:08:48] and the supernatural has been able to
[2:08:50] express itself through them
[2:08:53] and and I have to say I see God in them
[2:08:57] and I I so love them and and I and I say
[2:09:01] that I I see God in you young people
[2:09:04] I see God in you parents and I see God
[2:09:07] in you
[2:09:09] because I
[2:09:11] I look past the moral part of you
[2:09:14] [Music]
[2:09:16] and I know that you go through your
[2:09:18] trials you go through your things
[2:09:20] because I mean just that's just Humanity
[2:09:23] they don't take a lot of guesswork but
[2:09:26] but I do have like teenagers I do have
[2:09:29] children that
[2:09:32] so I I know what what the Mind battles a
[2:09:35] lot that they go through
[2:09:38] The Temptations that they face my boy's
[2:09:41] face
[2:09:42] as as young teenagers and things and
[2:09:46] they they sure face you guys face a lot
[2:09:48] more than I did
[2:09:50] back in my day and I I faced a lot
[2:09:55] that all we can say is God's keeping
[2:09:57] power in there's a supernatural element
[2:10:03] that stays with us
[2:10:05] and never leaves us
[2:10:07] even through your trials that you you
[2:10:10] may not feel like you're anointed you
[2:10:12] may not feel
[2:10:13] like you're doing any good but that
[2:10:16] Supernatural element is keeping you
[2:10:19] I think this is why we can sing that
[2:10:21] song
[2:10:22] and it become precious and all my life
[2:10:25] you've been faith
[2:10:27] we're not singing all of my life I've
[2:10:29] known how to do it all my life I've been
[2:10:32] strong all my life I've never failed
[2:10:36] but it's you've been faithful
[2:10:40] you've kept me you've you've guided me
[2:10:43] you've protected me
[2:10:47] and I'm so glad for a mighty God
[2:10:51] that could be here today
[2:10:53] living
[2:10:54] in this Horn of Flesh
[2:10:58] so God bless you
[2:11:00] may just keep pressing on
[2:11:03] and may you walk with God
[2:11:07] may you experience him in such a
[2:11:09] phenomenal way
[2:11:11] even more than you've ever had before
[2:11:14] amen for we are the body of Christ
[2:11:17] amen let's just bow our heads
[2:11:21] prayer
