[44:41] all to you now in Jesus Christ's name
[44:46] amen uh so we'll start at the 10th verse
[44:49] Ephesians 6:10 finally my brethren be
[44:52] strong in the Lord and in the power of
[44:54] His
[44:55] might put on the whole arm armmer of God
[44:58] that you may be able to stand against
[45:00] the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not
[45:04] against flesh and blood but against
[45:07] principalities against Powers against
[45:09] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[45:14] against the spiritual wickedness in high
[45:18] places amen then if you'll turn with me
[45:21] to the Book of Matthew the 4th chapter
[45:25] the 13th verse Matthew
[45:32] 4:13 or we can actually just start at
[45:35] the 12th verse Matthew 4
[45:39] and12 now when Jesus had heard that John
[45:42] was cast into prison he departed into
[45:44] Galilee and leaving Nazareth he came and
[45:47] dwelt in
[45:49] Capernaum which is upon the Sea Coast in
[45:52] the borders of zebulun and neph nephlim
[45:58] that it might be fulfilled which was
[45:59] spoken by isaas the prophet saying the
[46:02] land of zebulun and the land of
[46:05] nephalem by the way of the sea Beyond
[46:07] Jordan Galilee of the
[46:09] Gentiles the people which sat in
[46:12] darkness saw great light and to them
[46:16] which sat in the region and shadow of
[46:19] death light is sprung up amen you can
[46:24] have your seats this evening
[46:33] we are living in in such a wonderful
[46:37] age and I
[46:40] um I think you know the
[46:44] devil his job would be to get us
[46:49] to
[46:50] undermine and or not see the value of
[46:54] the message and also to see the
[46:57] value of us being in the message of the
[47:02] hour and um this as the prophet said
[47:07] this is the greatest age ever we've
[47:10] heard that so many times
[47:12] but I think it really needs to soak into
[47:16] to our hearts as just how great of an
[47:19] age we're living in the world has uh
[47:24] down through the history ever since
[47:28] mankind it is not only spoken of of the
[47:31] prophecy of speaking of Christ the first
[47:35] coming but there's actually more
[47:37] scripture that speaks of this day than
[47:40] it actually spoke of his first coming
[47:44] it's because that not only did God plan
[47:47] for messiah to come and to redeem but he
[47:53] he looked beyond that to see the the
[47:57] results of redemption the results of
[48:00] Calvary and he so anticipated it I mean
[48:04] it was just a an um something to God
[48:09] as if if you um if you've you know plan
[48:15] for something whether it be to build a
[48:18] home or um to to do a garden or
[48:23] whatever um you look for the results of
[48:27] that and so in and anticipating results
[48:32] you you prepare and Calvary was just a
[48:38] preparation uh what Messiah was uh 2
[48:42] years ago that was just a
[48:45] preparation of of what God was looking
[48:49] for and of course we are the the uh
[48:55] finale
[48:56] everything had been building up all the
[48:58] way down even the Old Testament was
[49:00] building up for messiah to come and and
[49:04] then all through it and um uh has been
[49:07] building up for the day that we're
[49:09] living in and with that in mind um uh
[49:15] we're we're fighting harder than we ever
[49:18] have
[49:19] before because Satan is trying
[49:23] to trying to uh Hinder the the plan of
[49:28] God and and so we're we're fighting it
[49:32] seems like one battle after another just
[49:35] just one after another one after another
[49:38] one blow after blow after blow after
[49:41] blow and it's not only uh physically but
[49:45] it's mentally and and it is it is
[49:48] spiritually as well and um you know
[49:53] brother brandom in his prayer in one
[49:56] place he said thy children are
[49:58] struggling in in these days uh the
[50:01] oppression of the enemy is so
[50:04] strong and and the reason uh for this uh
[50:08] is because there is a contest that
[50:12] started in heaven and um of course Satan
[50:16] rebelled against God as as we know and
[50:20] he was able to draw I think 2/3 I
[50:24] believe of the uh angels with him
[50:27] we would call them Fallen Angels
[50:29] whatever but but when he was kicked out
[50:33] uh when he rebelled he was kicked out of
[50:36] heaven and and brother brandom said
[50:38] Satan was kicked out into the Earth and
[50:41] then he become an enemy to God's people
[50:45] amen he become an enemy I mean he's
[50:48] directing his attacks to to God's people
[50:53] why because he knows that God is is is
[50:57] trying to do something within man God's
[51:00] plan is all about man
[51:02] humankind God God God uh from from God
[51:07] he created Sons we we aren't just a
[51:11] creation but we are literally part of
[51:15] God and and you know it's kind of like
[51:18] brother Bram said if you you love me
[51:19] love my family uh because they're part
[51:23] they're they're part of him and and
[51:25] that's the same way our children are
[51:27] part of us and and so we are part of God
[51:31] and so so God's God's Ambitions God's
[51:34] plans God's purpose it all is wrapped up
[51:38] in his children in his family God wanted
[51:41] to be family God wanted to to uh to to
[51:45] be able to express himself and and so he
[51:49] he's within him is is Redeemer within
[51:52] him is savior within him is healer
[51:55] within him is deliverer within him is
[51:58] all of these attributes and and and and
[52:01] really he wanted to direct that to to us
[52:05] as his children that we could love him
[52:09] and that we could fellowship with him
[52:11] and he would call us his children his
[52:13] sons and daughters he would call us his
[52:16] bride um uh but whatever he would call
[52:19] us it it would be him his family and and
[52:24] that's that's his whole goal his whole
[52:26] OB objective is he allowed us to fall
[52:29] and but yet he would not leave us that
[52:31] way but he would raise us up that was
[52:34] all in his plan that that that we could
[52:38] become one in fellowship with him and
[52:41] truly love him and and truly truly give
[52:45] our lives to him and that he could have
[52:48] total preeminence in us and and that he
[52:52] could reflect himself in us and through
[52:55] us yes he he was able to you know to to
[52:59] create him a body and you know I was um
[53:04] uh talking just kind of getting off uh
[53:06] here but my notes but I I was I had in
[53:10] Pennsylvania had made a a statement how
[53:13] that um uh God was able to um uh let's
[53:19] see how was that um work through a a a
[53:24] redeemed body or uh talking of MDC and a
[53:29] young man he he said I'm not
[53:31] understanding that how how you say that
[53:34] he's able to you know to to work in that
[53:38] way as as he did in MDC and you know and
[53:42] and so I was talking to him you know and
[53:44] trying to explain to him of how that you
[53:47] know when God when God uh uh appeared to
[53:51] Abraham he wanted to appear to Abraham
[53:54] as a man but he had no body he he
[53:57] couldn't he he he had no body to work
[54:00] with and so he created himself a body
[54:04] the prophet said he grabbed a a handful
[54:06] of dust and he blew and and uh you know
[54:10] and he created that body and of course
[54:13] we know it was a theophany body a word
[54:15] body but but then God stepped into that
[54:18] body and he appeared as a man to Abraham
[54:22] and that was wonderful he' done the
[54:24] Messiah sign and and that that was great
[54:27] and then he wanted to come later on as
[54:30] as Messiah and same God and and uh and
[54:35] yet he had no body to work through uh
[54:39] that he could you know have he couldn't
[54:41] go through a sex born body as and these
[54:43] things a sinful man and so uh uh he
[54:48] created a a blood cell in the womb of
[54:52] Mary and and through that body God was
[54:56] able to condens send in that body and
[54:59] the fullness of God dwelt in the body of
[55:04] Jesus Christ ain't that right but it was
[55:07] in this day that God wanted to visit us
[55:10] again God wanted to come in in just as
[55:14] he did in MDC just as he did in Jesus
[55:17] Christ he wanted to come but in this
[55:21] time he didn't have to create a body he
[55:24] didn't have to go and and create a blood
[55:27] cell you know Virgin uh uh to come again
[55:32] he he was able to come in a sex born
[55:35] body because the blood was so perfect at
[55:40] Calvary it was God's own blood and and
[55:45] and God was Able by his own blood to
[55:48] loose us from our sins he was actually
[55:52] able to loose us from our sins and and
[55:56] by loosening us the prophet said if it
[55:59] was perfect blood that loosed us then
[56:01] it's a perfect loosening Amen to where
[56:04] Satan has no control over us and the god
[56:08] of heaven was able to come through that
[56:11] sex born body amen and manifest himself
[56:16] like he did in in me uh in the body of
[56:20] MDC and of course it was later on called
[56:23] Jesus Christ ain't that right and and so
[56:26] this is where we're at is that God
[56:29] through the work of Calvary through the
[56:31] work of redemption has finally been able
[56:34] to get a church a group of people that
[56:37] he can actually Express himself through
[56:41] holy amen not just part but holy Express
[56:46] himself through and Satan hates it Satan
[56:51] hates the fact that that God is able to
[56:54] achieve his plan and he's hey he is
[56:57] trying his best to stop it can you say
[57:00] Amen now so so Satan become an enemy to
[57:04] God's people and he says since then he's
[57:07] used all of his strength and his
[57:09] strategy to try to pull God's people
[57:12] across the fires or into his fire see
[57:17] and so now Abraham Lincoln uh uh made
[57:21] this statement in time of peace prepare
[57:23] for war and brother randam he said see
[57:26] that's right in a time while everything
[57:29] is running smooth you better get ready
[57:32] for Satan isn't going to let it run
[57:35] smooth very long ain't that right so so
[57:40] you you you might be looking for good
[57:42] times and you might be but even in them
[57:45] good times and it seemed like maybe
[57:47] you're coasting and everything is just
[57:49] going smooth sailing you better prepare
[57:52] for war because Satan ain't going to let
[57:54] let it last that long ain't that right
[57:57] he isn't going to let it run smooth very
[57:59] long you're in a convention now he's
[58:01] talking to a crowd and everything will
[58:03] pour along just fine but you're going to
[58:06] leave here in a few days and you're
[58:08] going to meet the real enemy ain't that
[58:10] right and he says he might not even wait
[58:13] till you get ready to leave he might
[58:14] attack any time he's wicked and ruthless
[58:19] ain't that right he just carries on
[58:21] whenever he can whatever he can say or
[58:24] do he does it right now so it's best to
[58:27] be dressed all the time in in in another
[58:31] place he said as we leave this building
[58:33] to go to our different places our homes
[58:36] to meet outside to meet the world let's
[58:38] not go as we have in formal times now
[58:42] notice how he's going to tell us how to
[58:44] meet the enemy let us not go as we have
[58:47] in former times in former ages or
[58:50] whatever but let's go in the power of
[58:54] his resurrection see let's go in the
[58:57] name of Jesus Christ with the banner
[58:59] lifted high and with faith in his word
[59:02] to handle the two-edged sword with the
[59:05] shield and the full armor of God on to
[59:08] meet the enemy can you say amen amen now
[59:11] think of that we're we're going to meet
[59:13] the enemy amen so we want to be dressed
[59:17] up we we want to to to go forth amen and
[59:21] not meet the enemy in as we have in
[59:23] former times as as as through the ages
[59:26] but now looking at the enemy and
[59:29] realizing that we've got to meet him in
[59:31] a different way meet him in the power of
[59:35] his resurrection and go forth in the
[59:38] name of Jesus Christ can you say Amen to
[59:41] meet the enemy because he's getting
[59:44] stronger and more powerful every day
[59:48] ain't that right see so he says this he
[59:50] says now if we have come to the end of
[59:53] these things and the Mystery of God has
[59:56] been completed with us we are looking
[59:59] for more strength don't don't don't just
[1:00:03] don't just go through life relaxed amen
[1:00:06] God God has put you in this message for
[1:00:10] a reason he's called us and he's uh
[1:00:13] connected us U uh uh uh with the most
[1:00:17] powerful message on the face of the
[1:00:19] earth that is ever been can you say Amen
[1:00:22] see and so he says if if we've come to
[1:00:25] these in and and we've got to look at
[1:00:27] this church we're we're here at the end
[1:00:30] of of all things um the End of Time the
[1:00:34] end of civilization the end of mortality
[1:00:38] the the the end of of it all and and the
[1:00:41] reason why we're at the end is because
[1:00:43] God has been able to accomplish what he
[1:00:47] has wanted in us we are the finale of
[1:00:51] God's plans can you say Amen we we are
[1:00:54] we're we're not a victim we're not just
[1:00:57] just uh
[1:00:58] vagabonds we are part of God's plan and
[1:01:02] uh uh the prophet placed us at at the
[1:01:05] very end of this thing amen God has been
[1:01:09] after a bride we are that bride God has
[1:01:12] been after a perfect picture we are that
[1:01:15] perfect we are the last puzzle if you
[1:01:18] could say it that way see so now God you
[1:01:23] know it's all ending with us there is a
[1:01:25] BRI died upon this Earth and everything
[1:01:28] there's no need for time to continue
[1:01:30] there there's no need for for for things
[1:01:33] to keep uh uh continuing as we have seen
[1:01:36] it we're at the last age there will not
[1:01:38] be another church age after us there
[1:01:41] will not be another denomination after
[1:01:43] us there will not be another whatever we
[1:01:46] are the finale of it all now it's got to
[1:01:49] change from Mortal to immortality it's
[1:01:53] it's got to change from a corrupt
[1:01:55] civilization to an eternal civilization
[1:01:58] it's got to change from from uh uh uh
[1:02:01] corruption to innocence can you say Amen
[1:02:03] we're going back to where we come from
[1:02:07] everything that God has has desired and
[1:02:11] set out and purposed in this Nick of uh
[1:02:14] uh uh Little Nick uh in eternity called
[1:02:17] time it's it God has has wound that up
[1:02:21] in US amen see so now the mysteries of
[1:02:25] God has been completed with us we are
[1:02:28] looking for more strength how many's
[1:02:30] looking for more strength we're looking
[1:02:32] for more strength we're not on a picnic
[1:02:35] now and notice what he calls it a
[1:02:37] rapturing strength Amen to meet a worse
[1:02:42] Force that'll Rapture the church and
[1:02:45] take it into Glory we must have it can
[1:02:48] you say Amen so see you can understand
[1:02:51] why the powers of darkness is is is
[1:02:55] running rampant amen is he's trying to
[1:02:58] stop amen that that that mortal to
[1:03:02] change to immortality he's trying to
[1:03:05] stop with everything that he can to keep
[1:03:09] that church from from escaping out of
[1:03:12] here now that's right he's trying to
[1:03:15] keep us in doubt he's trying to keep us
[1:03:16] in unbelief he's he's trying to do
[1:03:19] everything he can to affect us can you
[1:03:22] say Amen first Peter 5 and8 says Be
[1:03:25] sober everybody say be sober be vigilant
[1:03:29] for your adversary not just a adversary
[1:03:33] an adversary your adversary the devil
[1:03:36] you've got an adversary that the devil
[1:03:40] as a roaring line walketh about seeking
[1:03:44] whom he may devour can you say Amen so I
[1:03:46] want to just say it to you tonight uh I
[1:03:49] ain't going to take you take long but
[1:03:51] it's not that God it's not God against
[1:03:54] you it's not that God has forgotten you
[1:03:57] I know we could go through trials and we
[1:03:59] can go through things and we we think
[1:04:02] maybe that God has just forsaken us and
[1:04:04] all that that's that's just wrong God is
[1:04:07] not against you God has not forsaken you
[1:04:11] amen but the prophet explains what
[1:04:13] what's going on he says it's the
[1:04:15] darkness everybody say it's the darkness
[1:04:17] Gathering itself to try to keep the
[1:04:20] light from coming that's what it is the
[1:04:23] pressure that we're feeling the the the
[1:04:26] the situations that we go through it's
[1:04:28] the darkness trying to keep that light
[1:04:32] amen from coming forth right come on now
[1:04:36] amen and you got to keep that in mind
[1:04:38] can you say Amen keep that in mind see
[1:04:41] so so the the the coming light the the
[1:04:44] coming light amen uh uh is is why this
[1:04:49] darkness is gathering amen and and uh
[1:04:53] all the foress forces together and it
[1:04:57] gets the darkest just before the light
[1:04:59] shines can you say amen amen see and and
[1:05:03] so we we we look at this and and realize
[1:05:07] that God has called us to Prevail that
[1:05:11] that's that's what we're we're here to
[1:05:12] do amen is to walk in that that perfect
[1:05:16] will of God how many wants to walk in
[1:05:19] that perfect will Amen to walk in that
[1:05:21] perfect will and I I say to you tonight
[1:05:23] don't get sidetracked
[1:05:25] don't don't don't look to the left don't
[1:05:28] look to the right I don't care how
[1:05:30] discouraged it may seem I I I I you know
[1:05:33] don't care how bad the way it may be and
[1:05:36] and all of these things but you cannot
[1:05:39] look back God has called you to move
[1:05:42] forward in him ain't that right and and
[1:05:45] you remember though that the Bible says
[1:05:48] greater is he that is in us than he that
[1:05:51] is in this world and and to think of it
[1:05:54] now there has to be there has to be the
[1:05:56] power of Darkness there has to be
[1:05:59] something to restrict and and and uh
[1:06:02] there's the opposition there because we
[1:06:05] are sons of God we have come to a place
[1:06:09] Amen to where we have been given the
[1:06:12] authority everybody say I've been given
[1:06:14] that
[1:06:15] Authority you have been given the
[1:06:18] authority by the word of God to speak
[1:06:21] the word of God can you say Amen you
[1:06:24] know uh we hear the word of God the the
[1:06:27] word of God is the most powerfullest
[1:06:29] thing on on the face of this Earth is is
[1:06:32] the word of God it's the greatest weapon
[1:06:34] that you could have is the word of God
[1:06:37] uh Satan you know when he had uh come to
[1:06:40] Jesus and you know Jesus was the
[1:06:42] fullness of the godhead and uh uh the
[1:06:45] the the uh God dwelt bodily in him he
[1:06:48] was the image of God uh well he was the
[1:06:52] image of the visible image of the
[1:06:54] invisible God
[1:06:56] Jesus said he that has seen me has seen
[1:06:58] the father I mean you you couldn't get
[1:07:01] any closer to God than him he was God
[1:07:04] Amen and he was the body that God dwelt
[1:07:07] in and yet Satan would come to him uh uh
[1:07:12] you know uh uh come to him trying to
[1:07:14] keep that light for Jesus said I am that
[1:07:17] light I'm the light and he lit up every
[1:07:20] scripture that that pertained to him he
[1:07:22] lit it up he he he made it come to pass
[1:07:26] every scripture laying there concerning
[1:07:28] the Messiah he made it live ain't that
[1:07:31] right and Satan was doing everything he
[1:07:33] could to stop this thing from happening
[1:07:36] he knew amen and and and so uh but when
[1:07:40] he come to Jesus and and Jesus would
[1:07:44] would uh come back to him by saying
[1:07:47] Satan it is written Satan it is written
[1:07:50] ain't that right every time Satan would
[1:07:52] come to him amen Jesus would just come
[1:07:55] back with the word of God it is written
[1:07:58] brother Braham said he had power upon
[1:08:00] power upon power but he used not a one
[1:08:03] to defeat Satan with he took the word of
[1:08:06] God to defeat Satan showing amen he was
[1:08:10] doing it to show us that the weakest
[1:08:13] Christian could take the word of God and
[1:08:15] defeat Satan any time any place under
[1:08:19] any situation can you say Amen now you
[1:08:22] you think of that now and and and so
[1:08:25] here we are amen we're we're back to the
[1:08:28] place again where the fullness of God is
[1:08:32] in the church not in a just one body of
[1:08:36] a man but in his church in this day
[1:08:40] we've come to that place to where we are
[1:08:44] at uh uh well we're in the age of
[1:08:47] adoption amen see here's the enemy it's
[1:08:51] it's the greatest Force it's the darkest
[1:08:54] age but God would not it would happen in
[1:08:57] this age when it's the when when it's
[1:09:00] the the the greatest light that is ever
[1:09:03] that has ever come and and so we we are
[1:09:06] in that age of adoption amen you say
[1:09:09] well well you know when does that happen
[1:09:13] you know in the well I just want to say
[1:09:14] it this way you know I I don't you know
[1:09:17] we we could go into all of this of how
[1:09:20] long it takes and all that I don't
[1:09:21] believe there's any time of of of
[1:09:24] whatever of how long it takes to to come
[1:09:27] into the adoption and all that all I
[1:09:29] know is this that if you'll take God's
[1:09:31] word and simply
[1:09:33] believe take all that doubt out and just
[1:09:36] believe God's word can you say Amen just
[1:09:40] take God's word and just believe it amen
[1:09:43] now we've hear the word of God we we we
[1:09:46] hear it you know when you're hearing
[1:09:48] brother Brandon preach or you're hearing
[1:09:50] you know uh Pastor preach or some other
[1:09:53] evangelist or the ministers here to
[1:09:55] preach or whatever you're hearing that
[1:09:57] word but but don't just be hearers but
[1:10:01] be doers take that word and start
[1:10:04] speaking that word to Satan can you say
[1:10:09] Amen on ain't that right amen now I know
[1:10:13] Satan can get in our mind he can possess
[1:10:15] you know he can he can get in our
[1:10:17] thoughts and he'll tell us we're not no
[1:10:20] good we're not we're not overcoming it's
[1:10:22] not worth it we you know and he'll just
[1:10:24] try to bring fear Fe I don't know what
[1:10:26] he tells you but I do know this that
[1:10:28] Satan does talk and he puts thoughts in
[1:10:31] our head ain't that right amen and it's
[1:10:34] a Warfare amen it's a Warfare of what
[1:10:37] he's trying to do it's it's powers of
[1:10:40] Darkness he might tell you that you're
[1:10:42] not loved he might even get you to
[1:10:44] feeling like God has forsaken you and
[1:10:47] and we all go through them times amen
[1:10:50] but but but what we've got to do instead
[1:10:52] of letting him just have his way with
[1:10:55] our mind we've got to start taking the
[1:10:57] word of God and start speaking that word
[1:11:01] back to him come on now can you say Amen
[1:11:05] yes you believe that amen well
[1:11:08] apparently you don't do you believe that
[1:11:11] amen if you believe that see then you
[1:11:13] speak that word amen I mean you know I I
[1:11:18] you know I I don't I I think of my um uh
[1:11:23] sister-in-law uh Laura you know she's
[1:11:26] saying that uh last night you know or
[1:11:29] well her youngest son has been fighting
[1:11:33] starts snoring you know when he's
[1:11:35] sleeping and it's irregular pattern just
[1:11:38] something weird about it you know and
[1:11:40] and so she didn't you know she just
[1:11:42] thought that was strange they they've
[1:11:44] been thinking that was strange but she
[1:11:46] was down in she's down in Oklahoma and
[1:11:48] uh she said you know that um you know I
[1:11:51] don't know how old Andrew is just young
[1:11:54] boy but
[1:11:55] uh he was in the other room and she
[1:11:58] could hear him all the way in in where
[1:12:01] she was just snoring and it was just
[1:12:03] irregular and she'd been looking up uh
[1:12:06] uh sleep apnea and different things you
[1:12:08] know maybe what was causing this and and
[1:12:11] um so she she thought well maybe ought
[1:12:14] to just in the morning just set at a
[1:12:16] doctor's appointment and find out what's
[1:12:18] going on and all that and then she's
[1:12:20] like no so I'll just wait for the
[1:12:22] meeting and and just have have the
[1:12:25] brothers to pray and and we'll go that
[1:12:28] way and and then it just come to her I
[1:12:30] am a daughter of God I don't have to
[1:12:33] wait for the meeting I'm a daughter of
[1:12:35] God I can lay hands on my boy and and
[1:12:39] and so she just did that she just went
[1:12:41] in there and and laid hands on him
[1:12:43] didn't wake him up just laid hands and
[1:12:45] said Satan I rebuke you in the name of
[1:12:47] Jesus Christ you leave my boy alone and
[1:12:50] and whatever is going on may may that
[1:12:53] thing leave in Jesus Christ's name she
[1:12:55] said he snored twice and then just
[1:12:58] stopped and and slept all night long and
[1:13:01] and and no snoring whatever God just
[1:13:03] touched it right there touched that
[1:13:05] child right there well what is it is is
[1:13:08] because someone is taking God at his
[1:13:10] word somebody is going to take God at
[1:13:13] his word can you say amen and and this
[1:13:15] is where we're at church it's it's we we
[1:13:18] we can't just look at this thing like
[1:13:20] we're just you know trotting down and I
[1:13:23] just wish God would do something to take
[1:13:25] me out of here and all this this you

[1:13:34] you know how much time you've got left
[1:13:36] and I don't know you know when the
[1:13:38] Rapture is coming but but all I know is
[1:13:41] this you don't have to live defeated
[1:13:43] right now you know whatever the devil is
[1:13:45] doing whatever you can silence him right
[1:13:49] now you don't have to listen to it you
[1:13:51] don't have to let him plag your mind you
[1:13:53] can you know as as they said you know
[1:13:55] you uh uh uh you know you you you you
[1:14:00] can you you may not be able to stop the
[1:14:03] the the birds from flying over but you
[1:14:05] can sure stop them from building a nest
[1:14:07] in your hair you understand what I'm
[1:14:09] saying and that's just the same way the
[1:14:11] devil's got free reign to our thoughts
[1:14:14] or our mind so to speak that he can put
[1:14:17] stuff there he can put negative stuff
[1:14:19] but he ain't got free reign over your
[1:14:21] soul that that we can take this word do
[1:14:24] you understand that God placed us under
[1:14:26] the greatest message we've got the pure
[1:14:30] perfect interpretation of this word i i
[1:14:33] i there ain't no sense in arguing with
[1:14:36] this message there ain't no sense in
[1:14:38] trying to figure it out just believe it
[1:14:40] even if you don't understand it just
[1:14:42] believe it I don't have to understand it
[1:14:45] just believe it and I just believe it
[1:14:48] God Is So Vindicated this thing that
[1:14:51] that that that that there should be no
[1:14:53] questions in our mind about what was
[1:14:55] taught and what was this just take it
[1:14:57] and believe it God didn't give these
[1:15:00] things for us to fight over and to fuss
[1:15:02] over and to feuded about and and all
[1:15:04] these things he gave it to his people
[1:15:07] that we could believe it in this age to
[1:15:09] get Supernatural strength and you say

[1:15:41] filled you with the Holy Ghost amen then
[1:15:44] then then that you're sealed to the day
[1:15:46] of your Redemption so you cannot let
