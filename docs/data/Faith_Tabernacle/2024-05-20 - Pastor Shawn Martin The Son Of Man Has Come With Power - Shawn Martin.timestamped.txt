[28:32] Lord
[28:37] amen uh Luke
[28:40] 21 and before we go into the word may we

[28:48] moment Lord
[28:51] Jesus we're so thankful for the victory
[28:54] that we have in
[28:55] you father and that we can rest knowing

[29:58] we ask it in Jesus Christ's name
[30:02] amen the uh uh
[30:06] Luke 21 and
[30:10] 25 it says and there shall be uh signs
[30:14] in the Sun and in the moon and in the
[30:16] stars and upon the Earth distress of
[30:19] nations with perplexity with uh the
[30:23] sea uh uh and the waves roaring 's
[30:28] Hearts failing them for fear and for
[30:30] looking after those things which are
[30:32] coming on the earth for the powers of
[30:34] Heaven shall be
[30:35] shaken and then shall they see the son
[30:38] of man coming in a cloud with power and
[30:43] great glory
[30:45] amen then
[30:48] um uh John the 14th
[30:51] chapter um we're familiar with
[30:56] this um but John chapter
[31:00] 14 and
[31:04] um
[31:08] um I believe uh would start at the 17th
[31:16] verse or we'll just the 16th and I will
[31:19] pray the father and he shall give you
[31:21] another comforter that he may abide with
[31:23] you forever even the spirit of Truth
[31:26] whom the world cannot receive because it
[31:28] seeth him not neither knoweth him but
[31:31] you know him for he dwelleth with you
[31:32] and shall be in you I will not leave you
[31:36] comfortless I will come to you yet a
[31:40] little while and the world seeth me no
[31:41] more but you see me because I live you
[31:43] shall live also and at that day you
[31:45] shall know that I in my father and you
[31:48] in me and I in
[31:51] you and I believe that this ties in with
[31:55] what we just read in Luke 17 or Luke uh
[32:00] 21 the son of man coming with power and
[32:04] great glory and then uh in
[32:08] Philippians
[32:10] 3 and
[32:14] 8
[32:16] um Philippians
[32:19] 3:8 yay doubtless and I count all things
[32:23] but lws for the Excellency of the
[32:25] knowledge of Christ Jesus
[32:28] my
[32:31] Lord and and of course the knowledge is
[32:33] not learning like you go into school but
[32:37] it's an
[32:38] experience may have that knowledge of
[32:42] Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have
[32:45] suffered the loss of all things and do
[32:47] count them but dung that I may win
[32:50] Christ and be found in him not having
[32:53] mine own righteousness which is of the
[32:55] law but that which is through the faith
[32:58] of Christ that the righteousness which
[33:00] is of god by
[33:02] faith that I may know him everybody say
[33:05] that I may know
[33:07] him and the power of his resurrection
[33:11] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[33:13] being made conformable unto his death
[33:17] amen you can have your seats this
[33:20] evening and
[33:23] um if I have a title it would be the son
[33:28] of man came with
[33:30] power and um not coming with power but
[33:34] he came with power for we believe that
[33:37] he is here he has come but the the power
[33:42] of God is important to us as Believers
[33:45] very important and one one would think
[33:50] that uh uh the world would recognize the
[33:54] power of God when it came and uh
[33:57] manifested and and these things but
[33:59] that's not so for there in in Timothy uh
[34:04] 2 Timothy 34 the Apostle uh Paul
[34:08] prophesied that in the last days
[34:10] perilous times shall come and that in
[34:14] other words dangerous times uh shall
[34:17] come and and he gives a a list of
[34:20] reasons as to why uh they're dangerous
[34:23] times but one of the one of the things
[34:26] that he listed was was that the the the
[34:29] people would have a form of godliness
[34:32] but would deny the power
[34:35] thereof and uh I thought that'd be
[34:39] interesting how that it's it's at the
[34:42] same time that the son of man uh comes
[34:45] in a cloud and we know what that cloud
[34:47] is it's not a thunderbolt amen but that
[34:51] cloud come in in uh uh 63 in Tucson
[34:58] um uh there and and he would come in a
[35:01] cloud with uh uh Power and great glory
[35:06] and at that time then Paul would let us
[35:09] know that not everybody is going to
[35:11] receive the power but they would deny
[35:15] that power they they would have a form
[35:17] of godliness but when that power would
[35:20] come they would deny the power thereof
[35:24] now the the Amplified says that for
[35:27] although they had a form of piety True
[35:31] Religion and that word piety is
[35:34] obligation or devotion being devoted see
[35:37] so so although they had an obligation
[35:41] and devoted to religion they deny and
[35:45] reject and are strangers to the power of
[35:48] it see their conduct belies the
[35:51] genuiness of their profession so so this
[35:55] word belies is to present an appearance
[35:59] not in agreement with uh to show
[36:01] something to be false or wrong so so uh
[36:05] uh one writer says the history of balai
[36:08] illustrates a certain connection between
[36:10] lying and disguising in Old English Bai
[36:14] meant to deceive by lying and in time
[36:17] was used to mean to tail lies about uh
[36:20] taking on a sense similar to that of the
[36:25] modern word slander eventually its
[36:28] meaning softened shifting from an act of
[36:31] outright lying to one of M
[36:36] misrepresentation and by the early 1700s
[36:38] the word was being used in the sense to
[36:41] disguise or conceal so so they they they
[36:46] they've got this form of godliness and
[36:49] and yet the very thing that that makes
[36:53] godliness is the power well they deny
[36:56] that power so so their their their life
[36:59] is is it's it's a contradiction of what
[37:03] they're claiming to be and so uh uh uh
[37:06] it's it's it's like taking a monkey out
[37:09] of out of the Jungle from where you know
[37:12] he swings from tree to tree and and he
[37:14] does what he does you know cuz that's
[37:16] his nature and he's at home in the
[37:19] jungle and you take him out and then you
[37:22] you dress him up in in in clothes and as
[37:25] as a human and and you teach teach him
[37:28] you know uh how to live like a a a uh a
[37:32] human and and you you house train him
[37:35] and and all of these things and and
[37:37] they've done that uh uh there but but no
[37:40] matter how much you train him he cannot
[37:43] be totally human uh because his nature
[37:47] is is as a monkey amen and so you could
[37:50] teach him to go through all the uh uh
[37:53] the the the uh uh rituals that maybe we
[37:56] would go through but that doesn't mean
[37:58] that he's human uh he's still a monkey
[38:01] he still has the nature of a monkey
[38:03] still the life of a m monkey and and so
[38:06] uh uh he will always be that a and and
[38:09] and in in time given a chance he will
[38:12] automatically revert back uh to to the
[38:15] habits of of his nature as a monkey
[38:19] ain't that right and see and and the
[38:21] only way that that could change is that
[38:24] the power of transformation would come
[38:26] into that monkey and and change him from
[38:29] what he is to a human being so so the
[38:32] the the the rituals that we could teach
[38:35] him uh to do as as as you know going to
[38:38] the bathroom and and and getting a cup
[38:41] and drinking and and doing all of that
[38:43] that we can never make him uh uh a human
[38:46] being it takes the power of
[38:48] transformation and so so many people are
[38:51] claiming Christianity and by by the form
[38:55] of it but not by the power and so form
[38:58] of godliness doesn't mean that you're a
[39:01] Christian at all and and so uh uh so
[39:04] this power uh that they will deny is the
[39:08] power that the son of man comes with
[39:11] when he is revealed and and of course
[39:14] the son of man has been revealed how
[39:16] many believes that the son of man has
[39:18] been revealed there's no question to
[39:20] that and and if there is then then ask
[39:23] the Lord to help you with that uh
[39:25] because because truly he has been
[39:27] revealed red and and and if he has been
[39:29] revealed then he has come with power uh
[39:33] uh he he has done that and so the power
[39:36] of God you know uh when we thinking of
[39:38] that it's it's been manifested really
[39:41] since the beginning of time uh uh God
[39:44] created the world by his power he he
[39:47] upholds the World by the word of his
[39:50] power and and so in in in the beginning
[39:54] there in in Genesis we see how that that
[39:56] that uh the world was without form it
[39:59] was Darkness covered the earth and the
[40:01] water and and all these things it it it
[40:04] it was an awful condition but God by his
[40:07] power and the prophet would call it the
[40:09] power of transformation he actually
[40:12] began to change these things and and and
[40:14] he talks about that there was seed that
[40:16] was laying in the earth and and and
[40:19] these things but then God would would
[40:21] through the power of transformation he
[40:23] would take chaos and he would transform
[40:26] it into to a Garden of Eden ain't that
[40:29] right but we not only just see the power
[40:32] of God in that we see the power of God
[40:34] through the preservation of the Hebrew
[40:36] children and and we see the power of God
[40:39] as we had mentioned this morning in in
[40:41] shutting the the the mouths of the lion
[40:44] for Daniel we see the power of God
[40:46] exhibited when he rode back the Red Sea
[40:50] uh uh for the children of Israel it we
[40:52] see the power of God when he made the ax
[40:55] head to swim and and it was all
[40:57] by the power of God ain't that right
[41:00] amen so so the power of God has has been
[41:04] essential and is so needed amen because
[41:07] it is more it it it's Supreme it it it
[41:10] does things that man can never
[41:13] accomplish is by the power of God now
[41:16] today the prophet said Satan's power is
[41:19] becoming a more of a reality amen uh in
[41:24] the world than God's power he said see
[41:27] Satan by the laws of sin and death makes
[41:30] everything that sin and death bought
[41:33] operate to Satan see uh uh uh you know
[41:37] he sends cancer Satan will send cancer
[41:40] and he says see the man recognizes it
[41:43] receives it Satan sends heartaches and
[41:45] we recognize it and we receive it see
[41:49] and and and you know today there's more
[41:51] sickness and and more corruption and and
[41:55] more more negative More Everything uh
[41:59] than ever before and people are fearing
[42:01] it uh because they are recognizing it
[42:05] and and receiving it see and and and yet
[42:09] it's the manifestation of Satan's power
[42:12] ain't that right people are living in
[42:14] fear today because they they have
[42:17] accepted this evil power of Satan as a
[42:21] part of normal life amen uh they is just
[42:25] becoming a a normal
[42:27] uh people are afraid of getting the flu
[42:29] they're afraid of of getting cancer and
[42:32] and and they don't even have to get
[42:34] cancer they don't have to get the flu
[42:36] and yet they're all scared of it and and
[42:38] afraid that you know and and and believe
[42:41] it or not they I believe they confess it
[42:43] enough to bring it upon themselves well
[42:46] even job said the thing I feared Came
[42:48] Upon me and and so fear does a lot of
[42:51] things fear opens the door uh for Satan
[42:54] to gain access and his to manifest
[42:58] that's why we should not fear uh
[43:00] anything that goes on in the world Amen
[43:03] well uh uh shouldn't fear cancer amen
[43:06] shouldn't fear heart disease shouldn't
[43:08] shouldn't shouldn't fear even if the
[43:10] doctor told you you got something you
[43:12] shouldn't fear that amen you you should
[43:15] just cast it off and and but but see uh
[43:18] uh uh but anyways they they're they're
[43:21] becoming more sensitive recognizing the
[43:25] power of Satan in in in the world and
[43:28] and so uh uh whatever Satan is sending
[43:31] up on the earth well the people
[43:33] recognize it and they receive it they
[43:35] they just simply accept it well if you
[43:38] know because negativity is becoming more
[43:41] and more and more the norm for people
[43:44] they're just negative people and and so
[43:47] uh you used to didn't worry about germs
[43:49] and all of a sudden we worry about germs
[43:51] and we worry about shaking people's
[43:53] hands and we worry about this and I hope
[43:55] so and so doesn't come to church tonight
[43:57] if they got a cough because we might get
[43:59] it and all of these things and and they
[44:01] become more sensitive to the Satan's
[44:04] power than they do God's power used two
[44:07] people didn't matter care about them
[44:08] things if God was just God and God was
[44:11] able and God was you know if if if
[44:14] something comes on we just rebuke it and
[44:16] just move on Amen see but but uh uh
[44:19] Satan's power is becoming recognized and
[44:22] becoming predominant as the main power
[44:26] among
[44:27] uh the Earth today but see as they
[44:30] recognize Satan power well when God
[44:32] sends his power and and uh down upon the
[44:37] Earth well then the people deny it and
[44:40] and the prophet say well they just say
[44:41] it's of the devil you know uh that
[44:44] that's amazing you know we'll accept
[44:46] Satan's power any time and if if if
[44:49] someone says well you know doctor says
[44:51] you're sick well we just accept it it's
[44:53] just oh oh okay I'm say you know and and
[44:57] we don't even have to cough we don't
[44:58] even have to have these things and all
[44:59] of a sudden oh I was around somebody and
[45:02] and oh my I don't know I better check my
[45:04] fever I better just check just in case
[45:06] you know I might just have that you know
[45:08] and and and so we bring it but when God
[45:10] comes with his power oh that's of the
[45:13] devil we just ain't going to accept that
[45:16] no sir ain't going to have that in our
[45:18] home ain't going to have that in our
[45:19] church ain't going oh no you know well
[45:21] see it it's it's that it's amazing how
[45:24] people will receive Satan's power but
[45:27] the Bible says that when he would come
[45:29] with as Jesus comes in his power well oh
[45:32] we deny that see and the Very the very
[45:36] uh uh religion the very thing that the
[45:39] power is supposed to bring well we'll
[45:41] keep that ritual we'll keep that form no
[45:44] wonder people get tired of church well
[45:46] there's no power in their in their
[45:48] service no wonder amen people just
[45:51] doesn't accept God and and they get
[45:53] bored with it all you know and it just
[45:55] becomes a dread and it just becomes that
[45:58] well they deny the very power of the god
[46:02] that they claim to serve you understand
[46:04] what I'm saying and and so then we we
[46:07] find amen you know I it's it's it's
[46:10] actually funny well it's sad too but
[46:13] there are actually preachers in the
[46:15] message that are afraid to lay hands on
[46:17] the sick because they're afraid that
[46:19] they will get what they've got you know
[46:21] and I thinking man what what woohoo you
[46:24] know uh that's just a little bit too far
[46:27] but but see but but notice the son of
[46:29] man which is Jesus Christ how many
[46:32] believe that amen the son of man is
[46:35] Jesus Christ he has come with power and
[46:40] great Glory so then if you want to find
[46:43] where Jesus Christ is it's not in your
[46:46] imagination that you find him it it's
[46:49] not through theology that we would find
[46:51] him find where the power is and you will
[46:54] find Christ because he comes with great
[46:59] power can you say amen amen see so uh uh
[47:03] this is why brother Brandon would would
[47:05] would would hit against formalism and
[47:08] and and formal worship formal uh
[47:10] churchianity and all that because that
[47:12] was not where Jesus is he would point us
[47:15] to where the power is and if you can tap
[47:18] in that power that's where Christ is see
[47:22] amen now brother brandom says see now if
[47:24] Satan by his power make his laws work in
[47:28] man how much more ought god with his
[47:31] power make his laws work in man see see
[47:35] so if Satan can make his laws be sure
[47:39] and US recognize it see how much more
[47:42] ought God to his children make his laws
[47:46] be recognized among his people of Divine
[47:49] Healing Revelation power gives
[47:52] manifestation of the spirit see the law
[47:54] of sin and death works in the people
[47:57] and the law of Liberty of Christ has
[48:00] come unto us to set us free from those
[48:03] things ain't that right see so Satan's
[48:06] power will make you sick Satan's power
[48:09] will drive you into an insane asylum
[48:12] amen Satan's power will you not
[48:15] only physically but spiritually mentally
[48:19] Satan's power is a power of deforming
[48:22] that's what the prophet called it
[48:24] deforming power see but then it the same
[48:27] time that Satan power increases and and
[48:30] demonic Powers flow in and pour in and
[48:34] people are becoming so possessed of it
[48:36] God would send his power to break that
[48:40] power and to set us free and that power
[48:43] brings a law of Liberty unto us amen you
[48:48] see God Saves by his power he heals by
[48:51] his power he delivers by his power he
[48:54] preserves his Saints by his power he
[48:57] upholds by his power he transforms by
[49:00] his power he raises the dead by his
[49:04] power he redeems by his power can you
[49:08] say amen amen see that's what his power
[49:11] has come to do so so the power we would
[49:14] call it saving power healing power power
[49:18] of
[49:19] transformation uh healing power
[49:21] delivering power redeeming power the
[49:24] prophet would call it quickening power
[49:26] power resurrection power see it's not
[49:30] just him just flexing his muscles there
[49:32] is a power there and amen not not just I
[49:36] hope you understand amen so so many
[49:39] titles to this power to let us know that
[49:42] his power is not limited just to one
[49:45] thing but the power that can heal you
[49:47] can save you and the power that can save
[49:49] you can redeem you and the the power
[49:51] that can redeem you can transform you
[49:53] and and the power that can transform you
[49:55] can actually change your your mortal
[49:58] body amen the power is here he has come
[50:02] with power and great Glory see this is
[50:05] God's power and so then we who have
[50:09] recognized the power of God through the
[50:11] son of man Ministry ought to take
[50:14] courage amen that there's nothing
[50:17] impossible amen with you if you just
[50:20] believe that's what the Bible says amen
[50:22] nothing impossible to them that believe
[50:25] ain't that right why because we
[50:27] recognize the power amen I may need one
[50:30] thing but there's a power that is here
[50:33] Amen to to help me you may need another
[50:36] thing but that same power is here to
[50:38] help you amen and all of God's people
[50:42] amen will not be left behind amen all of
[50:45] God's people all of this elect amen is
[50:48] coming into what God has called them to
[50:50] do by that same
[50:52] power
[50:54] now uh uh brother Ram says God the
[50:57] Creator who created All Things by his
[50:59] power through his spoken word and
[51:01] everything that is is the word of God
[51:03] made manifest the entire world was made
[51:07] and how we do error when we try to
[51:09] ignore God's word or try to limit God's
[51:12] power by our own imagination you you
[51:16] don't please amen God help us all not to
[51:19] limit God's power by our own imagination
[51:23] amen you may be down in the dumps and
[51:25] you may be going through hell but don't
[51:27] you limit your situ God's power by your
[51:30] situation just let God be God can you
[51:34] say Amen Now watch how the power of God
[51:38] is connected with the word of God I hope
[51:40] this all right amen but Romans 1:16
[51:43] we've read it this morning I'm not
[51:45] ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it
[51:47] is the power of God under salvation
[51:51] ain't that right to everyone that
[51:53] believeth amen 1 Thessalonians 1 5 for
[51:57] Our Gospel came not unto you in word
[52:00] only but also in power and in the Holy
[52:04] Ghost and in much Assurance amen so the
[52:08] power is connected to the word of God
[52:10] Amen when God speaks the power is there
[52:13] to make it come to pass you believe that
[52:16] it doesn't matter if if it needs
[52:18] transformation The Power of
[52:19] transformation is there if if it if if
[52:21] sickness is in the way amen then the
[52:24] power of God is to drive that sickness
[52:26] away way amen whatever it is God's word
[52:29] is going to come to pass amen because
[52:31] there's a power in the word of God so
[52:34] you cannot you will not find amen power
[52:37] out God's power outside of his
[52:40] word can you say amen yeah you just
[52:43] won't do that see amen but it's
[52:46] connected with the word now notice uh
[52:48] brother Brandon said notice now Luther
[52:50] comes in the cunningness and breaks the
[52:53] unity of God to man just like he did in
[52:56] Eden by great
[52:59] Temptations of promises of
[53:02] self-power and exaltation in this day he
[53:07] comes with great and Promises of of
[53:10] self-power and exaltation no wonder
[53:13] people don't want the they they deny the
[53:16] very power of God he's got them in in a
[53:19] place to where they're lifting
[53:21] themselves up by self-power amen it
[53:24] blows my mind he says you know uh they
[53:27] say well why why you can become a bishop
[53:29] if you'll stay with us you might be the
[53:31] district presbyter you know why why why
[53:34] would you go to something like that see
[53:36] that's Pentecostal see see the Catholic
[53:39] and so forth see a great false promise
[53:42] to men to receive power outside the word
[53:45] and promise of God he says see but you
[53:48] receive power when the Holy Ghost comes
[53:50] upon you not when you become a bishop
[53:53] not when you become a deacon not when
[53:56] you take a position in a church or in in
[53:58] in a public office or whatever the power
[54:02] comes after the Holy Ghost comes upon
[54:05] you so he says Lucifer comes in in
[54:08] cunning like he did then by Temptations
[54:11] and false promises a power outside apart
[54:15] from the word of God ain't that right so
[54:19] so Satan doesn't mind people having a
[54:21] form of godliness amen but it's the
[54:25] power see he wants the people to to deny
[54:28] the power because the power is what
[54:31] brings the change he does not mind you
[54:34] under knowing this Bible uh uh by heart
[54:37] and being able to quote it from from
[54:39] Genesis to Revelation and he doesn't
[54:41] mind you having a full schedule of
[54:43] reading this Bible year after year after
[54:46] year and finishing it amen when when the
[54:49] year is up and and all of these things
[54:51] he doesn't mind you coming to church and
[54:53] and and and knowing about God learning
[54:55] about God hearing about God he doesn't
[54:57] even mind you sitting in a m his church
[54:59] but he does not want you to accept the
[55:02] power amen that comes with the word of
[55:04] God ain't that right for the power is
[55:07] the is is the is the thing that it
[55:09] brings about the change now how else
[55:12] could the manifestation of sons come
[55:15] about without the power how else could
[55:17] the predestinated seed come forth in
[55:19] this last day how else can the changing
[55:22] of our body take place how else can the
[55:25] dead in in Christ rise amen how how else
[55:29] uh can we be caught up to meet the Lord
[55:32] in the air if if there's no power can
[55:35] you say amen and and see religious
[55:37] status is not the one that's going to
[55:39] change you amen just coming to a church
[55:42] and and being a moral good moral
[55:45] individual amen is not the thing that's
[55:47] going to change you it's the power of
[55:50] God that's going to bring about this
[55:52] thing you see we're living in an age of
[55:55] rapture do you believe that we're living
[55:57] in the age of rapture now in his prayer
[56:01] brother brandham said may we just not be
[56:03] satisfied Lord with joining church and
[56:06] trying to be a Christian amen being some
[56:09] self-effort see some way to try to
[56:11] manufacture something saying well I
[56:14] joined church and the people going to
[56:16] expect me to be a Christian see and now
[56:18] I'm not to have to do this and and not
[56:21] have to do that no more because I'm a
[56:23] Christian oh God may we get away from
[56:25] that Pharisee condition God that bunch
[56:29] of Hypocrites oh God somehow let the
[56:32] Holy Spirit speak at what I mean Lord I
[56:35] can't find the words to say it he says
[56:37] we don't want to be self-made Pharisees
[56:41] see God fill us with deity fill us with
[56:46] power and energy until our souls are a
[56:50] flame that our strength will be him our
[56:52] testimony will be God our words will be
[56:55] his and then the Devils will tremble and
[56:58] the world will shake and rock under the
[57:01] impact of it can you say Amen see so the
[57:05] power without the power then we're just
[57:07] self-made Pharisees so to speak we're
[57:10] self-made Christians we're self-made
[57:12] taught we're self-made this we're
[57:14] self-made that that's why we want the
[57:16] presence of God in our church that's why
[57:19] we want the power of God in our lives
[57:22] amen we want to welcome him can you say
[57:25] Amen we want to welcome him amen that's
[57:28] what this message is all about is to
[57:30] introduce us to the the son of man with
[57:34] power yes sir see now we are living in
[57:38] the season of
[57:39] change you know and and and uh uh uh
[57:44] here's the way the the Catholics think
[57:47] about change uh one priest told brother
[57:50] brandham he said that God gave the the P
[57:53] the church power to change the
[57:56] scriptures anytime they want to so
[57:59] that's the change that they're they like
[58:02] they like to where they can take it and
[58:04] make this word fit what they want to and
[58:06] take what they want to leave out and
[58:08] what they want to add to and and all of
[58:10] these things ain't that right but see
[58:13] God gave the church power not to change
[58:16] his word amen but that so that the
[58:20] people can be changed into His Image I
[58:24] don't want to change his word
[58:27] hello amen I don't want God to give me
[58:30] an authority to change his word what I
[58:33] want is an authority to be changed
[58:35] myself to his
[58:39] word amen yes sir so so here's the
[58:43] change 1 Thessalonians 1:5 for Our
[58:46] Gospel came not unto you in word only
[58:48] but also in power and in the Holy Ghost
[58:51] and in much Assurance as you know what
[58:53] manner of men we were among you for your
[58:56] and you became followers of us and the
[59:00] and of the Lord having received the word
[59:03] in much Affliction with joy and of the
[59:06] Holy Ghost so that you were in samples
[59:08] to all that believe in Macedonian AI for
[59:12] from you sounded out the word of the
[59:15] Lord not only in Macedonia and AI but
[59:18] also in every place your faith to God's
[59:20] word is spread abroad so that we need
[59:22] not speak anything see for they
[59:25] themselves show of us what manner of
[59:27] entering in we had unto you and how you
[59:30] turn to God from Idols to serve the
[59:33] living and true God see so the gospel
[59:36] that Paul preached there was a power
[59:39] there and when the people received his
[59:42] word as the truth the power took effect
[59:46] and the word took on a manifestation in
[59:50] their lives now brother Brandon would
[59:53] tell us the gospel is the power of God
[59:56] to make the word act what it says it'll
[59:59] do now think of that the power the
[1:00:01] gospel is the power of God to make the
[1:00:04] word act what it says it'll do now
[1:00:07] church we we this Bible has been laying
[1:00:10] dormant for years and years scriptures
[1:00:14] that have been laying there dormant now
[1:00:18] is is becoming alive because he has come
[1:00:23] with
[1:00:24] power can you amen so now brother
[1:00:28] brandom says in the Church of the Living
[1:00:30] God this morning lays the power to heal
[1:00:31] all sickness do you believe
[1:00:34] that something you don't want to deny
[1:00:36] right in the church this morning is the
[1:00:39] power to heal all sickness see in the
[1:00:42] Church of the Living God lays power to
[1:00:45] overcome all temptation in the
[1:00:47] possession of the Church of the Living
[1:00:49] God this morning lays the power to
[1:00:51] change sin and throw it away and receive
[1:00:54] the baptism of the Holy Ghost aren't you
[1:00:56] glad for that that power is in the
[1:00:58] church amen we we don't have to say oh
[1:01:00] God if you just please help me please no
[1:01:03] the power's there it it's it's there
[1:01:05] within the church uh uh uh now amen see
[1:01:09] and and so we can't look at all the
[1:01:11] sickness and we can't look at the habits
[1:01:13] and the sin and then start judging and
[1:01:15] saying well I I I know well God Can Heal
[1:01:17] Me of the headache but I just don't know
[1:01:19] if he can heal me of this this tumor you
[1:01:21] know and D D D no the power is in the
[1:01:24] church if we can recognize the power
[1:01:27] amen that has come uh to
[1:01:31] us thinking of this power Romans 88:18
[1:01:35] for I reckon that the suffering of this
[1:01:37] present time are not worthy to be
[1:01:39] compared with Glory which shall be
[1:01:41] revealed in us what a hope for the
[1:01:44] earnest expectation of the creature
[1:01:46] waited for the manifestation of the sons
[1:01:48] of God for the creature was made subject
[1:01:51] to vanity not willingly but by reason of
[1:01:55] him who has subjected the same in Hope
[1:01:59] see because the creature itself also
[1:02:02] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[1:02:05] corruption into the Glorious Liberty of
[1:02:09] the children of God now I believe that
[1:02:12] Paul was talking about this day that
[1:02:15] scripture have been laying there dormant
[1:02:17] until waiting for the power to come into
[1:02:22] the
[1:02:24] church so we have been subjected not
[1:02:27] only to vanity but to
[1:02:30] Hope ain't that right been subjected to
[1:02:34] Hope notice what Romans
[1:02:36] 15:13 now the god of Hope fill you with
[1:02:41] all joy and peace in believing that you
[1:02:44] may abound in Hope through the power of
[1:02:49] the Holy Ghost he did not just subject
[1:02:52] you to Hope but now he wants you to
[1:02:55] abound in hope in the things that he
[1:02:59] subjected you to now as a sinner we
[1:03:02] abounded in in in the vanity we we were
[1:03:06] subject to vanity we abounded in
[1:03:09] that ain't that right amen we started
[1:03:13] out as just a little innocent baby
[1:03:15] before you know it you know we' lie with
[1:03:17] this with that then we come and being
[1:03:20] maybe drinking smoking swearing you know
[1:03:23] adultery or or whatever and because we
[1:03:26] were subject to vanity but then that
[1:03:29] same God that subjected us to vanity
[1:03:32] subjected us to a hope right so then he
[1:03:36] says you would abound that you may
[1:03:38] abound in Hope through the power of the
[1:03:42] Holy Ghost
[1:03:44] amen that's right that's right oh do you
[1:03:47] love him you're not one just that just
[1:03:50] attends a church you're you're not
[1:03:53] you're not one who just has moral
[1:03:55] standards you're not one who just goes
[1:03:56] through the religious ritual you have
[1:03:58] been subject to uh to Hope and are bound
[1:04:02] abounding in Hope amen through the power
[1:04:06] of the Holy Ghost ain't that right look
[1:04:09] how you know brother brandom I believe
[1:04:10] in countdown and and other messages he
[1:04:14] he he showed us how fast the the world
[1:04:17] has progressed you know started with the
[1:04:19] horse and buggy then the automobile then
[1:04:22] the airplane and and now you know the
[1:04:25] the the the astronaut and all that
[1:04:27] happened the progress within what 50
[1:04:30] years or so been I've been you know
[1:04:32] reading of of the uh uh R Brothers I've
[1:04:35] got a book of the history of the R
[1:04:37] Brothers and and here they were the ones
[1:04:39] that that that put man up in in in the
[1:04:42] air and and they were actually lived to
[1:04:45] see man go into space amen by what they
[1:04:48] had accomplished but but the progression
[1:04:51] had has has gone so fast so fast see it
[1:04:54] had been laying there horse and for how
[1:04:56] many years and years and years and years
[1:04:59] but all of a sudden something took hold
[1:05:01] and brother Brown said the natural it it
[1:05:04] was an anointing there and and even
[1:05:06] though it's the natural it was typ in
[1:05:07] the spiritual because look how fast the
[1:05:10] church has
[1:05:11] progressed and you say Amen in this last
[1:05:14] day we progress in so much because there
[1:05:18] is a power there upon the church to
[1:05:22] cause her to abound
[1:05:25] that's right
[1:05:28] abound God hates a powerless religion it
[1:05:32] has to have power in it can you say Amen
[1:05:35] people may shout in the spirit they may
[1:05:36] dance in the spirit they may sing in the
[1:05:38] spirit they may they may whatever in the
[1:05:41] spirit see but that's not power that's
[1:05:45] blessings ain't that right we've seen it
[1:05:48] we've seen it all all through my
[1:05:49] lifetime of people dancing in the spirit
[1:05:51] and still the same way they were were
[1:05:53] before they started dancing sing and
[1:05:56] shouting and and all of that and and
[1:05:58] still uh uh in the same condition that
[1:06:01] they were before they started doing all
[1:06:02] of that see Amen brother brand said oh
[1:06:05] you say I went down there and there's a
[1:06:07] lot of power brother the whole floor was
[1:06:09] dancing in the spirit and not enough
[1:06:11] Faith to heal a toothache and you call
[1:06:13] that power that that's not power that's
[1:06:15] blessings he said there's a lot of
[1:06:17] difference between blessings and power
[1:06:19] ain't that right we thank God for the
[1:06:21] blessings and and I appreciate the
[1:06:23] blessings I I I love it when he when he
[1:06:26] falls Among Us and and we we we get
[1:06:28] excited and and some dance and shout and
[1:06:32] and cry and whatever see but that's
[1:06:35] blessings up that that that falls upon
[1:06:38] the people ain't that right but he said
[1:06:40] there's a lot of difference between
[1:06:41] blessings and power see God makes his
[1:06:44] blessings uh uh fall upon the righteous
[1:06:48] and the unrighteous amen that's why a
[1:06:50] man can be totally possessed the devil
[1:06:52] and speaking tongues and and and a man
[1:06:55] can Dan and shout and prophesy and and
[1:06:58] and and and and speak whatever you know
[1:07:01] just like cafas did and he's one that
[1:07:03] crucified the Lord Jesus and yet he was
[1:07:05] prophesying among them and and all of
[1:07:07] these things see it's the spirit of God
[1:07:09] falling amen up upon the congregation
[1:07:12] and it's the blessings ain't that right
[1:07:14] but we're not talking about the blessing
[1:07:17] we're talking about the son of man
[1:07:19] coming with power and it changes it
[1:07:23] changes that's right amen amen now
[1:07:27] brother brandham said notice he says you
[1:07:29] know sincerity brings power it also
[1:07:31] brings worship not forms it brings
[1:07:35] genuine power worship to know that you
[1:07:37] pass from Death un life now he says that
[1:07:41] God wants to perform by his power God
[1:07:44] wants to perform amen remember he says
[1:07:47] it's not by might nor by P might or by
[1:07:50] power but by my spirit not by your power
[1:07:52] but by my power by my spirit ain't that
[1:07:55] right
[1:07:56] so he says now when the church denies
[1:07:58] his power how can he perform and
[1:08:02] vindicate his word he said see God wants
[1:08:05] to perform by the Holy Ghost and
[1:08:07] vindicate his word and the church wants
[1:08:09] to perform see so so the church has its
[1:08:13] own way of bringing in Souls amen it has
[1:08:16] its own way of sending preachers out it
[1:08:19] has its own way amen of of making uh uh
[1:08:23] people Christians it has its own way of
[1:08:25] forgiving sins it has its own way of
[1:08:28] showing What Love Is Right see and and
[1:08:31] so the church wants to perform and and
[1:08:33] brother brand said they want to perform
[1:08:35] to make a big organization and what else
[1:08:38] to bring membership see no matter what
[1:08:40] you have to baptize Sinners see drunkers
[1:08:43] bootleggers and anything else and take
[1:08:46] them into the body of Christ and that's
[1:08:48] why the church is so messed up today is
[1:08:51] because the church is trying to perform
[1:08:53] the church is trying to make uh uh make
[1:08:56] the monkey into the human being so to
[1:08:58] speak they're trying to take the Sinner
[1:09:00] and make him a saint but it takes the
[1:09:03] power of God to do that amen that's
[1:09:07] right now brother Brown says in order
[1:09:09] for the church to perform they must deny
[1:09:11] the Holy Ghost right and have they done
[1:09:14] it yes they have amen they they've done
[1:09:17] that and and see he says denying the
[1:09:20] power and yet going through all the
[1:09:21] rituals see so then as as as I not take
[1:09:27] too much longer but when we think of the
[1:09:29] power of God we think of deity right
[1:09:33] deity amen when when the power of God is
[1:09:37] is manifested and is performed then we
[1:09:40] say God is Among Us that it's it's it's
[1:09:43] deity it it speaks of deity you know and
[1:09:46] and how many times have we been guilty
[1:09:49] of separating God from mankind by
[1:09:53] keeping deity in heaven
[1:09:58] right am we've been guilty of separating
[1:10:01] God from mankind by keeping deity in
[1:10:04] heaven you know it we're we're carnal
[1:10:07] human beings but just put deity back in
[1:10:10] heaven where it
[1:10:12] belongs but for the you know the purpose
[1:10:15] for redemption in the first place was to
[1:10:18] reconcile God and man back together and
[1:10:21] and to make one man one with God is that
[1:10:25] true and this is exactly what Jesus was
[1:10:29] he was one with the
[1:10:31] father and man knew that deity wasn't in
[1:10:35] heaven it was on Earth in a body of a
[1:10:39] man that's right ain't that right amen
[1:10:43] see John 14:7 if you had known me you
[1:10:47] should have known my father also from
[1:10:48] henceforth you know him and have seen
[1:10:50] him Philip saith unto him Lord show us
[1:10:52] the father and it sufficeth us and Jesus
[1:10:55] said unto him have I been so long with
[1:10:57] you and yet thou Hast not known me
[1:10:58] Phillip he that has seen me has seen the
[1:11:00] father how sayest thou then show us the
[1:11:03] father right well what was Jesus John
[1:11:06] 1:1 in the beginning was the word and
[1:11:09] the Word was with God the Word was God
[1:11:12] 14th verse and the Word was made flesh
[1:11:16] and dwelt Among Us can you say Amen so
[1:11:20] the word took on
[1:11:23] flesh and we behave his glory but then
[1:11:27] we find in John 17th chapter and and I
[1:11:30] won't read it but Jesus prays to the
[1:11:32] father that that he would make us one
[1:11:37] with him as he and the father was one
[1:11:40] bring us into that same
[1:11:43] Oneness can you say Amen sir
[1:11:48] now the world is trying to be make a
[1:11:51] Oneness and they're they've been trying
[1:11:53] to do it for years and years
[1:11:55] through a force everybody beli the same
[1:11:58] thing everybody say the same prayer
[1:12:00] everybody do the same thing and
[1:12:02] everybody this and everybody that and
[1:12:04] it's a force of Oneness and it's coming
[1:12:07] again the World Council of churches is
[1:12:09] you'll either be in it or you'll be out
[1:12:12] it's it's just that way ain't that right
[1:12:14] but it ain't going to work that's not
[1:12:16] the Oneness that Jesus was talking about
[1:12:18] ain't that right but see so God was in
[1:12:22] Christ reconciling the word World unto
[1:12:26] himself and notice Jesus had power for
[1:12:30] he says all power both in heaven and in
[1:12:34] Earth is given unto me oh man I think
[1:12:38] that's powerful he had the power to heal
[1:12:41] the sick and he did it right he had the
[1:12:44] power to cast out devils and he did it
[1:12:46] right he had the power to raise the dead
[1:12:48] he had the power to forgive sins he had
[1:12:50] the power to open the blinded eyes but
[1:12:52] not only that he had the power to
[1:12:54] fulfill every scripture that was
[1:12:56] prophesied of him for that day and he
[1:13:00] did it did he not he manifested that
[1:13:02] power there was no devil on the earth
[1:13:05] that could that could uh detour him that
[1:13:08] could break him that could destroy him
[1:13:11] nothing Satan remember he was going
[1:13:14] across the sea and Satan caused the
[1:13:17] Tempest and the winds to to start
[1:13:18] blowing and the waves to start rocking
[1:13:20] he was trying to drown him in the ship
[1:13:24] let's get rid of him let's drown him in
[1:13:26] the middle of the lake but Jesus stood
[1:13:28] there with the power and said peace be
[1:13:30] still and the power of God closed or
[1:13:34] shut uh calmed the storm can you say
[1:13:37] Amen see so he manifested that power and
[1:13:41] notice in the end that power quickened
[1:13:45] him when he was dead it quickened him
[1:13:49] and raised him up because there was
[1:13:53] scripture that was pertaining
[1:13:56] him yes
[1:13:58] sir so the grave had no right to hold
[1:14:02] him death had no right to keep him amen
[1:14:05] because there was prophecy concerning
[1:14:07] him and he was full of quickening power
[1:14:11] to raise him back up again now the blood
[1:14:15] of Jesus Christ as we know and this is
[1:14:17] simple but the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:14:19] made
[1:14:20] preparation the whole point of Calvary
[1:14:22] we can sing about the blood there's
[1:14:24] power in the blood we can sing about how
[1:14:26] that it reaches to the highest mountain
[1:14:28] and reaches to the lowest Valley we can
[1:14:30] we can sing about all of these things
[1:14:33] thank God for the blood and thank God
[1:14:35] for Calvary and He Paid a Debt that he
[1:14:37] did not owe and I owed a debt I I I
[1:14:40] could not pay and I needed somebody to
[1:14:43] wash my sins away and and we sing all of
[1:14:46] them songs and that's wonderful but why
[1:14:48] are we seeing it what was Calvary to
[1:14:52] reconcile us back to God
[1:14:55] yes sir that's right see amen see so the
[1:14:59] blood of Jesus Christ prepared the way
[1:15:02] for deity to come into man and deity and
[1:15:07] power go hand in hand sir oh I got the
[1:15:12] Holy Ghost and then God remained silent
[1:15:14] in you he didn't do it in
[1:15:19] Christ that's right now notice Luke
[1:15:22] 24:49 behold I send the promise of my
[1:15:25] father upon you but te ye in the city of
[1:15:27] Jerusalem until you be ued with power
[1:15:30] from on high Acts 1:8 but you shall
[1:15:33] receive power after that the Holy Ghost
[1:15:35] is come upon you ain't that right so
[1:15:38] this power relates to the Holy Ghost and
[1:15:41] the Holy Ghost is none other than the
[1:15:43] spirit of Christ and this is exactly
[1:15:46] what happened on the day of Pentecost
[1:15:48] the Holy Ghost came into them and they
[1:15:51] received what power power from on high
[1:15:56] that's right and then we can see what
[1:15:58] took place look at Peter's life look
[1:16:00] look at the disciples amen what they
[1:16:02] were before they received the Holy Ghost
[1:16:05] and what they were after they received
[1:16:07] the Holy Ghost a book of Acts could not
[1:16:10] have been written
[1:16:12] beforehand but after they received the
[1:16:15] Holy Ghost they received that power
[1:16:17] there was a book of
[1:16:18] Acts Hallelujah they cast out Devils
[1:16:22] they healed the sick ain't that right
[1:16:25] yes sir see and so now of course that
[1:16:29] was the beginning on the day of
[1:16:30] Pentecost that was the first church it
[1:16:32] was God planting his Pentecostal seed
[1:16:36] that first church was in seed form ain't
[1:16:39] that right but it hadn't yet went into
[1:16:42] the ground and rotted that's right so
[1:16:45] the prophet told us that God planted
[1:16:46] that Pentecostal seed on the day of
[1:16:48] Pentecost it was a perfect seed that he
[1:16:53] planted you take a SE an apple seed
[1:16:56] every Apple that that seed will ever
[1:16:58] produce is already in the
[1:17:01] seed ain't that right everything about
[1:17:04] that apple and uh that that seed that
[1:17:06] the tree everything it's already laying
[1:17:09] in that seed
[1:17:10] potentially ain't that right so
[1:17:13] everything that God was was laying in
[1:17:16] that seed everything that the church
[1:17:17] would be was already laying in that seat
[1:17:20] for it was a perfect seat but the
[1:17:23] prophet told us that was under the
[1:17:26] dispensation of the Son of God the son
[1:17:29] of man was never promised to be revealed
[1:17:31] anywhere outside of this age according
[1:17:34] to Luke 17:30 ain't that right it was a
[1:17:37] perfect seed and it had the full power
[1:17:40] of God in it but it never came to
[1:17:43] maturity for the seed had to die
[1:17:46] everybody say the seed had to die
[1:17:50] to it had to die and the prophet said
[1:17:53] that Pentecostal Church died at Nia Rome
[1:17:57] the seed fell into the ground into the
[1:18:01] dirt it was buried you know what the
[1:18:03] dirt was brother randam said that dirt
[1:18:05] was
[1:18:06] denominations ain't that right so he
[1:18:09] says see the first church was that
[1:18:11] reproduction the bride that seed that
[1:18:14] word made manifest that fell into the
[1:18:17] ground at ner Rome he said see there is
[1:18:20] your dirt is them denomination see there
[1:18:23] is where the word was cruci ified they
[1:18:25] accepted dogma and for hundreds and
[1:18:28] hundreds of years of Dark Ages the power
[1:18:31] and manifestation of the word was hid
[1:18:33] from the world only Catholicism ruled
[1:18:37] ain't that right but notice but that
[1:18:39] Pentecostal church is to be resurrected
[1:18:43] in the brigh tree in the last
[1:18:46] days amen aren't you glad for
[1:18:50] that now it's not the planting of
[1:18:53] another seed God didn't take away
[1:18:55] that seed and decided to plant another
[1:18:57] seed in this day nope see it's the same
[1:19:00] seed that went into the ground on the
[1:19:03] day see that was planted on the day of
[1:19:05] Pentecost went into the ground that N
[1:19:07] seea All Through the Dark Ages now it's
[1:19:11] coming up and we're now at the stage of
[1:19:16] maturity it's not another planning as we
[1:19:19] know brother brandom's taught it so many
[1:19:21] times it has gone this seed has gone
[1:19:24] through three
[1:19:25] uh stages of growth Luther Wesley
[1:19:28] Pentecostal ages ain't that right but
[1:19:30] notice brother Brown says now everybody
[1:19:33] say now that's very important I know
[1:19:35] people deny that fourth age that fourth
[1:19:38] stage but but brother Brown taught the
[1:19:40] fourth stage we would have known the
[1:19:41] fourth stage now we've see we've gone
[1:19:45] through West uh Luther Wesley
[1:19:47] Pentecostal age now we're down to the
[1:19:50] end time and Christ has returned in his
[1:19:54] form of the holy spirit in the fullness
[1:19:57] of his power into the church to manifest
[1:20:02] himself what son of
[1:20:05] man the fullness of the word every
[1:20:09] promise that was promised to the church
[1:20:12] is now to be made manifest in this age
[1:20:16] by a people yes
[1:20:18] sir a people who were not born perfect a
[1:20:21] people who had faults and still has
[1:20:23] faults
[1:20:25] a people that has weaknesses and born
[1:20:27] with weaknesses and born with all of
[1:20:29] these things and yet there is a power to
[1:20:32] rest upon them to come into them to
[1:20:35] manifest the word of
[1:20:38] God we're not
[1:20:40] self-made we're not a self-made bride
[1:20:43] we're not a self-made
[1:20:46] people can you say Amen you love the
[1:20:49] Lord amen so brother Braham says I have
[1:20:52] to watch Parables the way nature runs
[1:20:55] I haven't the education to do it I don't
[1:20:57] want it I'd rather have what I've got
[1:21:00] and than all the education in the world
[1:21:02] I have Jesus Christ I see him live his
[1:21:04] word right through and that's all I need
[1:21:06] to know and if a man is born of the
[1:21:08] spirit of God he'll search the scripture
[1:21:10] to see if it's the answer for today the
[1:21:12] answer of the day is Christ Christ is
[1:21:14] the word and when the word comes to life
[1:21:17] it shows the light that's promised of
[1:21:19] the day this dark Le otsy and age just a
[1:21:22] few as many as I receive I chasen I
[1:21:26] rebuke Repent Jesus said and return turn
[1:21:30] back turn to the word he is the word
[1:21:32] come to him yes sir now he says watch
[1:21:35] the light it come from the East going
[1:21:38] west see we're at the West Coast see it
[1:21:41] had three stages didn't it it had three
[1:21:43] stages it crossed the water three times
[1:21:46] from Paul and across the Mediterranean
[1:21:48] come into Germany Germany lit up with
[1:21:51] Luther cross the English Channel uh over
[1:21:53] into England See England see and it it
[1:21:57] come uh uh uh with John Wesley and then
[1:22:00] it come across the Pacific to the United
[1:22:02] States see she has worked her way down
[1:22:05] through Luther's message on down until
[1:22:07] the last part of it is here on the West
[1:22:10] Coast again and from the ripening of the
[1:22:12] grain all the way back from Luther all
[1:22:15] the way back down through the age notice
[1:22:18] it ought to be the fullness of the
[1:22:20] Gospel now the power of God to R
[1:22:25] ripen what's it ripening that
[1:22:27] predestinated seed inside
[1:22:33] you the light has been shown through
[1:22:36] justification sanctification the
[1:22:37] Pentecostal age ought to ripen the bride
[1:22:40] tree for the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:22:42] Christ that Christ could be manifested
[1:22:44] in his church as one person him and his
[1:22:48] wife him and his bride and this is the
[1:22:51] hour We're living this is the light of
[1:22:54] the day do you love him we could go on
[1:22:58] and on with these
[1:23:01] things if the musicians will
[1:23:07] come brother BR said what Luther had
[1:23:09] what Wesley and what the Pentecostals
[1:23:11] had we've got plus everybody say plus
[1:23:16] plus until Jesus Christ is made manifest
[1:23:20] in the fullness of his power as he
[1:23:22] promised to be in this last day
[1:23:25] you know when Jesus was
[1:23:27] born he really didn't show anything that
[1:23:30] he was
[1:23:32] special he laid there as a baby
[1:23:36] crying in that manger anyone that would
[1:23:39] have looked on
[1:23:40] him would say oh that's you know cute
[1:23:45] baby maybe like me and you know yeah
[1:23:50] it's kind of ugly
[1:23:55] you know and but he didn't show anything
[1:23:58] really special
[1:24:00] but when he become a
[1:24:03] man the world had to take notice the
[1:24:05] world of that day had to take
[1:24:08] notice that something was different
[1:24:11] about
[1:24:12] him that was God
[1:24:16] right and brother randam said see now
[1:24:20] the church now that was once dressed
[1:24:22] like that little manger experience
[1:24:25] that we've been
[1:24:26] through there was a time we didn't
[1:24:28] really just show much we just you know
[1:24:30] yeah that's just a normal church just
[1:24:33] the normal people going through their
[1:24:35] thing
[1:24:36] yeah but he says now the church has come
[1:24:40] to a place that the people are realizing
[1:24:43] that the deity and the power of almighty
[1:24:45] God is living in the human
[1:24:47] being that's where we're at
[1:24:49] church I hope you recognize that
[1:24:55] to say that the church the power of the
[1:24:56] Living God is in us and we don't
[1:24:58] recognize
[1:25:00] that if God is in US it has to come
[1:25:03] forth and it's changing us day by day
[1:25:06] it's changing us little by little it's
[1:25:09] changing
[1:25:10] us your your believing is not in vain
[1:25:14] your your testimony your confession is
[1:25:17] not in vain there's a power that's
[1:25:19] actually changing us we're leaving this
[1:25:22] place Church
[1:25:24] and and the god that subjected us to
[1:25:26] vanity has subjected us to Hope do you
[1:25:28] realize they without us cannot be made
[1:25:31] perfect all the saints of old of of that
[1:25:34] have gone before they cannot be made
[1:25:36] perfect without us we're we're the last
[1:25:39] we're the last generation standing we're
[1:25:41] the last Church we're the last
[1:25:42] Age and and it's in this age in this age
[1:25:46] when it looked like it was all hopeless
[1:25:47] when it looked like it was it just
[1:25:49] nothing was going to change everything
[1:25:51] was just going to remain the same cycle
[1:25:53] after cycle after cycle just cycles of
[1:25:55] Revival bride bride bride bride churches
[1:25:57] churches churches bride bride as the
[1:26:00] prophet said but then there comes
[1:26:02] one that's not only got the mechanics
[1:26:04] but she's got the Dynamics she's
[1:26:07] different from the rest what is it the
[1:26:10] power has come and has changed her
[1:26:14] changed her making us ready for a
[1:26:17] Rapture not going to another age not
[1:26:21] being introduced to another church age
[1:26:23] another another messenger there is none
[1:26:27] the power had to come if it didn't come
[1:26:31] we'd all go through the Great
[1:26:34] Tribulation but the power has come I'm
[1:26:37] so glad for
[1:26:39] that really look at
[1:26:42] it this
[1:26:45] power brother brah said no wonder you
[1:26:47] know he said talking about
[1:26:50] Jesus being adopted on Mountain
[1:26:52] Transfiguration
[1:26:57] I know some don't believe that but
[1:26:58] brother Bram taught that that Jesus on
[1:27:01] Mount Transfiguration that was his
[1:27:04] adoption then when he come down from
[1:27:07] there and we all know what the adoption
[1:27:08] is it's a it's it's the son that had
[1:27:10] been tutored and tutored and raised you
[1:27:13] know to learn the the will of the father
[1:27:15] subjected to the will of the father
[1:27:17] doing the will of the father he he had
[1:27:19] been an obedient child under under the
[1:27:22] under the tutor a ship of of the tutor
[1:27:25] and and and and and you know then the
[1:27:28] father uh uh you know uh gets the report
[1:27:31] that this this son is worthy to come
[1:27:34] into this adoption he he's been obedient
[1:27:37] He's been Faithful he's been you know
[1:27:39] attendant Amen to everything that I've
[1:27:41] showed him and about the father's
[1:27:43] business and and then then the father
[1:27:46] takes that son and and adopts him not
[1:27:49] not our adoption to where we take
[1:27:51] someone outside of her family and bring
[1:27:52] an you know an adopted into our family
[1:27:55] no he's always the Son of God he he he's
[1:27:57] always but now he gives the father gives
[1:28:01] him full power full Authority places
[1:28:04] that on that son in an adoption and now
[1:28:07] the father stands back and the son
[1:28:09] stands forward and now he conducts as
[1:28:12] the father would it it because they
[1:28:15] become
[1:28:16] one can you
[1:28:19] sayen oh
[1:28:21] my brother BR said after after that
[1:28:23] adoption no wonder Jesus say all power
[1:28:25] in Heaven and Earth has been given unto
[1:28:27] me it' come to his
[1:28:29] adoption now do you realize that he the
[1:28:32] son of man coming with
[1:28:35] power people looking for a physical
[1:28:39] body but what they not understanding is
[1:28:41] that power has come to the
[1:28:44] church because there's Sons and
[1:28:46] Daughters of God that has come to
[1:28:49] maturity it's an adoption
[1:28:54] can you say Amen brother brandom talks
[1:28:57] about it in hear ye him and adoption and
[1:29:00] he preaches several sermons on he hear
[1:29:02] ye him you ought to go listen to them
[1:29:04] all talks about all these things and
[1:29:07] what is it it's the power coming to the
[1:29:10] church that is here because there's sons
[1:29:13] and
[1:29:14] daughters that have been faithful to the
[1:29:16] will of God they've rejected all other
[1:29:21] thing and they've listened to the T
[1:29:24] ership the power of God is in
[1:29:28] them that they can
[1:29:30] speak can you say Amen you love
[1:29:34] him I think the world rejects the power
[1:29:37] of God because they can't be obedient to
[1:29:40] the word of God they have to argue with
[1:29:42] it they have to they have to dissect it
[1:29:46] they have to say well that was just man
[1:29:47] that was just brother Brand's opinion
[1:29:50] that's right and by saying that they
[1:29:51] denying that power they're not coming
[1:29:54] into that adoption but there is a church
[1:29:57] saying Amen to every word be it unto me
[1:30:00] according to Thy
[1:30:02] word and it's the son of man being
[1:30:04] revealed in your
[1:30:06] flesh you say well how do we know he's
[1:30:09] here because we have seen the Messiah
[1:30:10] sign it's been done we know he's here he
[1:30:14] didn't leave here with brother brandham
[1:30:16] he's still here with them that church
[1:30:19] he's pouring his power into the Church
[1:30:21] of the Living God don't you fear about
[1:30:24] things don't fear about the world don't
[1:30:27] fear there's so much arguing and fussing
[1:30:29] in the white house and even in churches
[1:30:31] and and in in in Republicans and among
[1:30:35] themselves and Democrats among
[1:30:36] themselves and just so much all this
[1:30:38] confusion and chaos but don't you worry
[1:30:41] about all of
[1:30:43] that God's power is with you to
[1:30:45] transform you I'm so glad for that
