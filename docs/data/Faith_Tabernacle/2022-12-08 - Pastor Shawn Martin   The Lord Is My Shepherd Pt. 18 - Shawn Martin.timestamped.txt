[18:31] we've got
[18:33] a couple praise reports
[18:36] first of all this one's uh
[18:39] put in by Sister Jane
[18:41] it says when I had my yearly physical
[18:43] last year a
[18:47] scantum mount
[18:49] scant amount of blood was found in my
[18:52] urine this year my doctor said that
[18:55] there was much more so she scheduled an
[18:59] ultrasound to determine the cause for
[19:01] the Sean and the church prayed for me
[19:04] and I believe that God
[19:06] would take care of whatever it was
[19:09] the results of ultrasound was no Mass
[19:13] was found and everything was stable
[19:16] meaning in place
[19:19] and doing what it was supposed to do I
[19:22] want to thank my church family for their
[19:24] prayers and thank God for all the times
[19:26] he has touched me God is so faithful and
[19:30] I praise His holy name Jesus Christ

[38:58] and um
[39:01] I'm going to continue just with this
[39:03] thought on
[39:05] the Lord is my shepherd and and we have
[39:08] been dealing uh for some time now in the
[39:12] third verse he restoreth my soul
[39:16] and um
[39:19] but I uh looking at this and I may not
[39:23] get all the way into it tonight but I'm
[39:25] going to just kind of go back
[39:28] into some areas but this last part of
[39:32] this verse David said he leadeth me in
[39:36] the paths of righteousness for his
[39:38] namesake
[39:40] now I believe that
[39:43] um David shows us in the preceding
[39:46] verses
[39:49] as to how we come to this point
[39:52] he leads me in the paths of
[39:55] righteousness and as we've talked about
[39:58] the first chapter he or first verse he
[40:01] he starts out with the Lord is my
[40:04] shepherd
[40:06] and
[40:07] um so uh
[40:10] as David would put it he's not a
[40:12] Shepherd but he is mine he's personally
[40:16] mine and I I think that's a something
[40:20] that we we must
[40:23] acknowledge we must have a revelation of
[40:26] that the Lord is my shepherd personally
[40:29] to me
[40:31] and for him to be my shepherd means that
[40:34] I am his sheep ain't that rhyme you know
[40:38] brother Brown said Jesus has nothing but
[40:40] Sheep amen so it's all sheep that are
[40:44] his and so he knows his sheep
[40:48] and his sheep know him
[40:51] it's it's something that is a
[40:54] relationship
[40:55] and of course we I am made his sheep you
[40:59] are made his sheep uh by having his
[41:02] nature uh within us that gives us a
[41:05] sheep like nature ain't that right
[41:08] and so this tells a lot of who I am it
[41:12] tells a lot of who you are as as sheep
[41:16] sheep cannot be driven they must be led
[41:19] so ever all the relationship with Christ
[41:22] is not that he drives you to it but he
[41:26] leads you to it every every part of this
[41:30] is is is us being led now so whereas a
[41:34] goat cannot be led now he can lead but
[41:37] he cannot be led himself and so uh uh we
[41:42] find that the devil does exactly what
[41:45] the goat does you know uh uh you know
[41:48] brother Brown talking about you know the
[41:51] the goat he said he will lead God's
[41:53] sheep right up to the slaughter and then
[41:56] he steps out out of side he said that's
[41:59] right so be careful what's leading you
[42:03] ain't that right and and so you know
[42:06] we've seen it's it's and I'm sure you
[42:09] have too or you've seen uh guys you know
[42:12] come in church and start being you know
[42:15] uh uh putting on this Christian uh act
[42:19] and and all of these things and when's
[42:22] the affection of a young lady and uh you
[42:25] know and before you know it he's got her
[42:27] out the church and and uh what when and
[42:31] and and what's sad about it is is after
[42:34] he's got the girl totally messed up and
[42:36] and all these things he leaves her for
[42:39] another girl and and you know and here
[42:42] she's left in shambles or life is broken
[42:45] into pieces and you know you you look at
[42:49] it and that's exactly what the devil
[42:51] does he'll bring someone in a church
[42:54] just to uh uh set under the disguise of
[42:59] it all and become you know as the
[43:01] prophet said just sit sit there and and
[43:04] win the affection of the people and and
[43:07] all these things and before you know it
[43:09] Satan will shoot that guy with the
[43:11] poison dart and and and before you know
[43:15] it he's he's uh you know the many people
[43:20] in the church get caught up in the
[43:22] excitement and and they're left mad
[43:25] they're bitter they're struggling in
[43:27] their walk as as as Christians and and
[43:31] they pull off to themselves instead of
[43:34] joining up with the Brotherhood and and
[43:37] and the guy that started it all he's
[43:39] already gone and moved on you know and
[43:41] that's that's that's that goat that's
[43:44] that goat nature amen and and brother
[43:48] Branham says you know it's hard to tell
[43:50] the difference between professed
[43:53] Christians and genuine real Christians
[43:57] ain't that right he says the goat
[44:00] represents the world they'll lead you
[44:02] right down the wrong road to your
[44:05] Eternal separation from God they'll
[44:07] they'll lead you into trouble so if we
[44:10] are sheep we better watch what kind of
[44:13] Shepherd we've got ain't that right and
[44:16] and he goes on and talks of how that the
[44:19] Cry of the goat sounds exactly a uh like
[44:24] a sheep and he says the the goat will
[44:27] cry exactly like a sheep he's a little
[44:30] let a little old Billy Goat get hung up
[44:33] out there somewhere and a little sheep
[44:35] on one side going bad you know and then
[44:38] bad just the same see he says I've heard
[44:42] them down at the altar just to cry and
[44:44] crying oh God sobbing away like that and
[44:48] and oh God and a goat all the time see
[44:52] so he says you better he said you better
[44:55] be a Shepherd if you want to know the
[44:58] difference ain't that right so a
[45:00] Shepherd is the one that knows the
[45:02] difference and and I'm glad that God is
[45:05] our Shepherd Jesus Christ is the
[45:07] Shepherd Of Our Lives he knows the
[45:10] difference ain't that right and and so
[45:12] he he knows the Bible says he knows his
[45:16] own uh the foundation of God stand to
[45:19] sure having this seal the Lord knoweth
[45:22] them that are his ain't that right so so
[45:26] there is a bond there is a relationship
[45:29] so so so the Lord doesn't know who you
[45:33] are tonight he knows exactly who you are
[45:37] and as sheep you've got to trust that
[45:40] he's leading you and and you say but I I
[45:43] don't see where where where where you
[45:46] know I just you know how did I get here
[45:48] well the Lord's LED you there amen and I
[45:51] just believe that do you believe that
[45:53] the footsteps of the righteous are
[45:55] ordered of the Lord
[45:58] so we we find that the Sheep are led by
[46:02] the voice of their Shepherd and and of
[46:05] course you know the the the the voice of
[46:08] Our Shepherd today is the Vindicated
[46:11] word for for this hour for this day amen
[46:16] and and his voice has been clearly
[46:19] identified by Malachi 4. you believe
[46:23] that amen uh so we don't wonder who the
[46:27] voice of God is it's it's it's it's made
[46:30] clear to us it's the Vindicated voice
[46:33] word of God for this age amen and and a
[46:38] true Vindicated Prophet has thus saith
[46:41] the Lord do you believe that now I know
[46:43] a lot of folks are saying thus saith the
[46:45] Lord but but but I I I and and and a lot
[46:49] of confusion that goes on uh uh in the
[46:52] world today and and even in the message
[46:54] ranks and and all of this but but I'm
[46:57] telling you the people of God should not
[46:59] be confused a man about what to listen
[47:02] to and what voice to listen to I I don't
[47:05] care if they say the god of Heaven and
[47:08] Earth came down to visit them in a form
[47:10] of an Angel if it's against what the
[47:13] Bible what the prophet of God Vindicated
[47:16] Prophet has said then then it's not the
[47:19] voice of God see because any other voice
[47:23] is the voice of a stranger now we've
[47:26] already got a promise and it's a comfort
[47:27] to us that Jesus would say that that
[47:31] they they they will follow not the voice
[47:33] of a stranger a stranger they will not
[47:36] follow ain't that right and and and and
[47:39] I I tell you what uh uh if there's ever
[47:42] a time that you young people us Elders
[47:46] uh preachers me your pastor we we got to
[47:50] get solid stable uh uh parents deacons
[47:56] uh trustee everybody y'all it's stable
[47:59] I'm not saying you're not but I'm
[48:01] telling you we've got to get more stable
[48:03] get so stable in this message that that
[48:07] when the the when the things begin to
[48:10] come and the winds begin to blow and and
[48:13] you're going to find people falling left
[48:15] and right and so much again so much
[48:17] confusion left and right but if you'll
[48:20] hear the voice of your Shepherd hey can
[48:23] you say man Vindicated word amen then
[48:27] you'll sell right through it amen that's
[48:29] right now we we find that the Sheep
[48:33] cannot lead themselves they are so
[48:36] dependent upon their Shepherd amen
[48:40] because they do not have an independent
[48:42] nature amen their nature is to depend a
[48:47] man up on a Shepherd even when they get
[48:49] lost as we said brother Branham tells us
[48:52] that they they will just they they will
[48:54] just sit there you know instead of
[48:56] trying to find their way back they'll
[48:58] get there and and stand there and and
[49:01] just bleep bad bad bad bad and and and
[49:05] they're defenseless against anything
[49:07] they'll never be able to find their way
[49:09] back it takes the shepherd and and and
[49:12] the shepherd knows his own and he loves
[49:15] his sheep that he will leave the 99 in
[49:19] the foal to go after that one sheep
[49:22] ain't that right because he knows
[49:24] without his help that sheep is going to
[49:27] perish and it would be a disgrace if the
[49:30] shepherd loses his sheep ain't that
[49:32] right but God says you'll not I'll not
[49:34] lose you all that the father hath given
[49:37] me I will not lose a one aren't you glad
[49:41] for that and that's why we're here
[49:43] tonight because he ain't lost you yet
[49:45] and he will no he won't lost you lose
[49:48] you so we find that there is a bond
[49:51] between the shepherd and the sheep and
[49:54] so the shepherd isn't going to leave his
[49:56] sheep and the Sheep isn't going to leave
[49:59] the shepherd amen now we remember you
[50:01] you know about the little lamb you know
[50:03] he's young and dumb and and all these
[50:06] things and and he he might leave that
[50:08] Shepherd a little bit and the shepherd
[50:10] keeps bringing him back bring him back
[50:12] but one day that Shepherd says you know
[50:14] the Sheep's got to learn a lesson here
[50:16] and he'll take that rod and he'll break
[50:18] that leg of that Sheep amen and it looks
[50:21] mean and but we would call it like a
[50:23] prophet would call it the tender hand of
[50:25] Jehovah the tender hand of of a shepherd
[50:28] and he will bind or take that sheep bind
[50:31] that leg up and all of these things and
[50:33] nurse that little sheep back then he
[50:36] holds that sheep and Carries that she
[50:38] talks to that sheep and when he when
[50:40] that sheep heals that leg heals that
[50:42] sheep just stays right with that
[50:43] Shepherd never leaves again ain't that
[50:46] right I don't know about you but I've
[50:48] I've had my leg broke a little bit and
[50:50] and and and I just don't want to leave
[50:53] the shepherd amen I I love I love the
[50:56] voice of the shepherd amen do you love
[50:58] God voice of the shepherd amen I don't
[51:01] understand why people just want to go
[51:02] away from this message I just don't amen
[51:05] maybe they're goats I don't know but
[51:07] anyways you know uh uh but I tell you uh
[51:12] uh we know where David's loyalty was and
[51:15] any other sheep a man for he said the
[51:18] Lord is my shepherd there's a lot of
[51:21] things that we could go on for for for a
[51:25] long time on just that thought the Lord
[51:28] is my shepherd but he's he's saying it
[51:31] without saying it in other words my my
[51:34] pledge is to him my loyalty is to him
[51:38] again there in 60 Psalm 63 8 David Cries
[51:43] Out My Soul followed with hard after
[51:47] thee so we know he's a real sheep ain't
[51:49] that right he's not just one that
[51:51] professes to be sheep he's a real sheep
[51:54] because his soul is following hard after
[51:57] him I've thought of even Psalms 5 and 1
[52:01] give ear to my words O Lord consider my
[52:05] meditation hearken unto the voice of my
[52:08] cry my king and my God for unto thee
[52:12] will I pray my voice shalt thou hear in
[52:16] the morning O Lord in the morning will I
[52:18] direct my prayer unto thee and we'll
[52:22] look up ain't that right amen that's a
[52:25] true sheep see amen uh in in Isaiah 26
[52:29] and 8 it says yea in the way of thy
[52:33] judgments O Lord have we waited for thee
[52:36] the desire of us of our soul is to thy
[52:40] name and to the remembrance of of thee
[52:43] with My Soul have I desired thee in the
[52:47] night and Yea with my spirit Within Me
[52:50] will I seek thee early so there's an
[52:54] attachment when it comes to Sheep amen
[52:57] to to the Lord be their Shepherd they're
[53:00] such an attachment that nothing can
[53:03] steer them away
[53:04] Temptations and the trials and and all
[53:08] of that but down in the heart of a sheep
[53:11] a man it's beating God I need you oh God
[53:15] I I love you can you say Amen so we we
[53:20] find then David says our shepherd He
[53:23] leads me in the Green Pastures and and
[53:27] of course as we said the Green Pastures
[53:29] is where our food supply is and we feed
[53:33] there which the is is the open book the
[53:37] the the the full Revelation the the true
[53:40] interpretation is what every sheep is of
[53:44] God is feeding off of in this age and
[53:48] it's where we're strings and it's where
[53:51] that we are sustained amen and I think
[53:55] what the prophet said we do he have to
[53:58] Day by God's help the perfect
[54:01] interpretation of the word with Divine
[54:05] Vindication ain't that right so so our
[54:09] Shepherd has led us into Green Pastures
[54:12] because why would he do that because he
[54:15] cares for us a man he doesn't want you
[54:17] so just uh skinny sheep so to speak and
[54:21] and barely making it in Weak sheep and
[54:24] just staggering along just you know just
[54:26] faint-hearted oh no he's going to give
[54:29] you the best kind of food that will
[54:32] sustain you ain't that right amen now I
[54:36] want to say this about these Green
[54:38] Pastures and we see we don't need uh uh
[54:43] another uh translation of the Bible to
[54:47] eat in these Green Pastures see
[54:50] different translations don't help us to
[54:53] understand better God's Divine word amen
[54:58] and and now don't get me wrong I ain't
[55:00] rebuking no one here tonight because we
[55:02] do know what brother Brandon said about
[55:04] uh you know and and I I use them uh uh
[55:08] Vines I use the uh dye glot and and uh
[55:12] we we use them things brother Terry is
[55:15] studying and things but but I'm I'm
[55:17] talking about we've got so many
[55:19] translations today that and people are
[55:23] looking for better understanding of the
[55:26] word and I will tell you this that that
[55:28] even if I if I read the uh any kind of a
[55:31] translation maybe to get a word or
[55:34] whatever I always go back to what a
[55:37] prophet said about it amen before I put
[55:40] an interpretation to it ain't that right
[55:43] amen but see they think that the world
[55:46] thinks that if if I if I can get it down
[55:49] better in in translations then I I can
[55:53] understand God better and and that's not
[55:55] true amen and and you can read this yes
[55:59] um that brother Branham talks about
[56:00] these things of how that most Bible
[56:03] students believe that the New Testament
[56:05] was originally in the Greek language and
[56:09] and he says our our Greek Scholars today
[56:11] say that the Greek language of the Bible
[56:14] days is so perfect and exact that is the
[56:18] student of the Greek is refined and and
[56:22] uh is a re as is a refined and accurate
[56:27] grammarin uh that he can truly know
[56:30] exactly what the New Testament teaches
[56:33] so so that they're saying that it's the
[56:35] Greek you you got to know the Greek and
[56:37] anyone that's really uh uh trained in
[56:41] that Greek that that can can know all
[56:43] the ins and outs of Greek then he's the
[56:45] one that can better understand uh what
[56:49] the Bible says you understand and so uh
[56:53] but yet the prophet would say but every
[56:55] Greek scholar of reputation from one one
[56:58] denomination baits another debates
[57:01] another student of another denomination
[57:04] and their arguments are based on
[57:06] identical Greek words and identical
[57:09] rules of grammar see so so we find that
[57:14] that even history talks about or tells
[57:16] us that of of two two Greek uh students
[57:21] that got in a debate and it was such a
[57:23] it was at the Nicene Council in in that
[57:26] time and and and and and such was the
[57:30] debate In the Heat of debate that had
[57:32] spread worldwide of that of that time
[57:35] and and it became a worldwide debate and
[57:39] and so and and the prophet says that
[57:42] that that the world the intents of this
[57:45] debate that the world was divided over
[57:48] it was over a a a diphthong if I could
[57:52] say it that right and and he says that
[57:54] the diphthong is the sound of two vowels
[57:57] in a single syllable ball so they're
[57:59] they're they divided the whole world
[58:01] divided over one one word diphthong over
[58:05] a two-syllable uh uh uh two vowels and a
[58:10] single syllable that's just the debate
[58:13] of you you see how Petty the debates are
[58:16] a man see and and so the the prophet
[58:20] asked if the Greek is so perfect and so
[58:23] ordained of God then why was there a
[58:27] dispute in the first place see so so God
[58:30] did not intend for all of us to know
[58:33] Greek Amen in in in all of the uh you
[58:38] know uh these things so today you know
[58:40] we've got uh uh uh one Greek uh
[58:44] philosopher you know cannot persuade the
[58:47] the other Greek philosophers to to
[58:49] believe his interpretation of the Greek
[58:52] and and every Greek student has their
[58:55] own learned version of what the Greek
[58:59] means and and that's just the same way
[59:01] you just get one Bible and everybody's
[59:03] going to debate on the Bible it it it
[59:06] it's it's just that way ain't that right
[59:08] so how can you feed off of confusion uh
[59:12] uh and and questions in in all of these
[59:15] things see and and so then you you have
[59:18] that that there there are learned men
[59:21] who claim that the original manuscripts
[59:24] of the Bible were were written in aramic
[59:27] I I believe that's how you would say
[59:29] that in the rainiac language which was
[59:32] the language that Jesus and and the the
[59:35] rest of the people used of his day see
[59:38] and and so they claim that the people uh
[59:41] did not speak and write in the Greek as
[59:45] is so commonly believed today and and
[59:48] the prophet would tell us that even our
[59:50] historians are divided on that amen so
[59:54] so uh you know trying to get to accuracy
[59:57] of things uh one Professor has proven to
[1:00:01] his satisfaction through research that
[1:00:04] the New Testament was written in
[1:00:06] vernacular uh in the vernacular of the
[1:00:10] Greek speaking people of that day on the
[1:00:13] other hand amen Dr Lanza uh I guess
[1:00:17] that's his name lamsa lamsa was
[1:00:19] convinced that the New Testament was
[1:00:21] written in the aramic and so brother
[1:00:24] Branham says if you read the King James
[1:00:27] version of the Bible and compare it to
[1:00:29] the translation by Dr lamsa you you will
[1:00:33] find that there is no difference in the
[1:00:35] content or doctrine see so brother
[1:00:37] Branham goes on to say that God has
[1:00:40] allowed these newly discovered
[1:00:42] manuscripts and recent publications of
[1:00:46] already known scripts to come before us
[1:00:49] to prove the authenticity of what we've
[1:00:52] already got can you say man and we find
[1:00:55] that through trans that though
[1:00:57] translation leaders May fight each other
[1:01:00] the scriptures do not ain't that right
[1:01:03] so so there there is a truth to this and
[1:01:06] even though all the trans translators
[1:01:08] are debating over this right here and
[1:01:11] they're trying to make it plainer and
[1:01:13] plainer and plainer to us to where we
[1:01:16] can understand yet there is a truth that
[1:01:19] is laying right here and has been laying
[1:01:22] here all along do you believe that amen
[1:01:26] and that's where the Green Pastures are
[1:01:28] a man see so we we see that a man cannot
[1:01:31] base his interpretation upon students
[1:01:35] profound knowledge of the language the
[1:01:37] Bible is written in and and if if and
[1:01:41] brother Brown says if you cannot see
[1:01:43] that then you're veiled in your mind by
[1:01:46] Traditions ain't that right because the
[1:01:49] the Sadducees the scribes and and and
[1:01:53] the Pharisees and all the writers and
[1:01:56] the great Scholars uh there uh uh uh in
[1:02:01] Jesus's day knew the exact meaning of
[1:02:05] the word in which the Old Testament It
[1:02:08] Was Written these people were well
[1:02:11] skilled they were Scholars and not just
[1:02:14] in memorization but in what language the
[1:02:17] Bible was written in they they knew all
[1:02:21] the ins and outs about it the periods
[1:02:23] and the dots and the commas and the ands
[1:02:26] and the conjunctions and and and and and
[1:02:28] and so well versed in the Scrolls that
[1:02:32] it is said that they could roll up a
[1:02:33] scroll point and push a needle through
[1:02:35] it amen and tell you the words that that
[1:02:38] need a went through they were so well
[1:02:41] versed in this in the Bible in the
[1:02:45] Scrolls ain't that right amen but the
[1:02:48] prophet says but even though they had a
[1:02:50] superb knowledge they missed the
[1:02:53] revelation of God's promised word
[1:02:56] manifested in the sun ain't that right
[1:02:59] you see Jesus was the main theme
[1:03:02] throughout the the Old Testament from
[1:03:04] Genesis to to Malachi he was the main
[1:03:08] theme and yet their their education of
[1:03:12] the Bible their knowledge of the grammar
[1:03:14] everything about it and and the
[1:03:17] pronunciations and and and all of these
[1:03:20] things could not reveal to them what was
[1:03:23] hidden in the book can you say man so
[1:03:26] when Jesus came to manifest a man what
[1:03:30] the word actually said with all of that
[1:03:34] Grammar with all of that schooling with
[1:03:36] all of that knowledge and education they
[1:03:40] could not see him in the Bible ain't
[1:03:44] that right so brother Brown says as much
[1:03:47] as we believe in trying to find the
[1:03:49] oldest and the best manuscripts to get
[1:03:51] the best record of the word possible we
[1:03:54] will never get the true meaning of it by
[1:03:57] study and comparison of scriptures
[1:04:00] sincere as we may be it will take a
[1:04:04] revelation from God to bring it out can
[1:04:08] you say man so David when he's saying he
[1:04:11] leads me in these Green Pastures he's
[1:04:14] not saying it's because I know amen the
[1:04:17] grammar of it and I know all the
[1:04:19] pronunciations and and I can just say it
[1:04:22] out to you that way it wasn't that it
[1:04:24] had been a revelation that had come to
[1:04:27] him and he was eaten in the Green
[1:04:30] Pastures
[1:04:32] can you say man
[1:04:33] amen we got Bibles everywhere and yet
[1:04:36] more trouble more confusion more uh
[1:04:39] chaos than we've ever had before can you
[1:04:42] say man that's even even you you
[1:04:45] understand we had a Bible that was given
[1:04:47] to us years before a Prophet come and I
[1:04:50] know these these scoffers and these
[1:04:52] critics tell us well you need to get
[1:04:53] back to the Bible you don't message
[1:04:55] people they don't know their Bible I
[1:04:57] gotta beg to differ with you I know it
[1:04:59] more amen the bride knows it more than
[1:05:01] the than the scholars of the day and and
[1:05:03] and the commentators and all of that why
[1:05:06] because the true interpretation has come
[1:05:10] to this Bride Can you say Amen they
[1:05:13] could knock the the scholars of this
[1:05:15] Bible could not put us in the Green
[1:05:17] Pastures amen the theologians of this
[1:05:21] Bible the Seminary could not put us in
[1:05:23] the Green Pastures that God would send
[1:05:26] his voice through a prophet and would
[1:05:28] reveal and take what was between the
[1:05:31] lines and reveal it to his people and I
[1:05:34] say to you he has led us into Green
[1:05:36] Pastures
[1:05:43] now this is exactly what Paul said
[1:05:46] in First Corinthians 2
[1:05:50] and 13.
[1:05:52] which things also we speak not in The
[1:05:55] Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but
[1:05:59] which the Holy Ghost teacheth
[1:06:01] and so brother Branham says that the
[1:06:04] true Revelation is God interpreting his
[1:06:07] own word
[1:06:09] by vindicating what is promised
[1:06:12] so yet you understand the true
[1:06:15] revelation if you want the true
[1:06:17] Revelation it's God interpreting his own
[1:06:21] word by vindicating what he has promised
[1:06:25] Scholars don't even know that God is
[1:06:27] fulfilling his word today they're taking
[1:06:30] us all the way back to a baby in a
[1:06:32] manger and they're taking us all the way
[1:06:34] forward to to whatever uh they they uh
[1:06:38] have imagined in the future and all this
[1:06:41] time God is doing something right under
[1:06:43] their nose and very few people know what
[1:06:47] he's doing but to us it's Green Pastures
[1:06:50] can you say man I just want to make that
[1:06:53] clear to you the Revelation is the Green
[1:06:56] Pastures that we that he Our Shepherd
[1:06:59] has led us in it's our food ain't that
[1:07:04] right so we believe that the Bible is
[1:07:07] accurate amen not because of what man
[1:07:10] has been able to do but we've seen it
[1:07:13] we've seen God interpret his own word
[1:07:15] ain't that right amen see so Jesus
[1:07:19] completely authenticated the Old
[1:07:22] Testament when he walked the Earth and
[1:07:24] and it was compiled exactly as the New
[1:07:28] Testament uh uh yes see so we we have
[1:07:32] the infallible word of God today and no
[1:07:36] man dares to add to it or take from it
[1:07:39] ain't that right but brother Branham
[1:07:42] says we need everybody say we need we
[1:07:45] need the same spirit that gave it to uh
[1:07:49] that gave it to teach it to us we need
[1:07:53] the same spirit that inspired them into
[1:07:55] right can you say amen and I'm going to
[1:07:58] be honest he didn't Inspire I don't know
[1:08:01] and and I'm not here for debate but I
[1:08:03] don't believe that he inspired uh or he
[1:08:06] may have but but I'm not going to focus
[1:08:08] on that as that is inspired the
[1:08:10] translators you understand what I'm
[1:08:12] saying but what was inspired is these
[1:08:16] men that wrote the Bible can you say man
[1:08:19] if if Moses told us what happened in in
[1:08:23] the Garden of Eden that was what was
[1:08:26] inspired now the translator can say what
[1:08:29] he wants in in all of these and he's
[1:08:30] tried his best to get it right amen but
[1:08:33] but what what we're needing in this hour
[1:08:36] is not a translator to reveal it to us
[1:08:39] amen and and some will to do guy that
[1:08:43] could that could take the scriptures and
[1:08:46] unfold it to us even even you know uh
[1:08:50] even Paul said though I understand all
[1:08:52] Mysteries and yet not have charity I'm
[1:08:54] nothing can you say man so so there is
[1:08:57] an element of truth that has been laying
[1:09:00] there as a mystery amen but it takes the
[1:09:04] holy spirit amen to reveal it to us we
[1:09:07] don't need Paul in our day to reveal it
[1:09:09] to us can you say amen and I'm going to
[1:09:12] tell you even this that that that that
[1:09:14] that we don't need brother Bradham to
[1:09:16] come back amen and get it down into our
[1:09:18] minds we've already got the tapes and
[1:09:21] yet there will be people that'll listen
[1:09:22] to them tapes and still miss what's
[1:09:24] happened we need the spirit of God to
[1:09:28] come and reveal what the prophet said
[1:09:33] amen we need Revelation by the spirit
[1:09:37] we don't need a new Bible the prophet
[1:09:39] said we don't need a new translation
[1:09:40] though some are good he says I'm not
[1:09:43] against them but we need the revelation
[1:09:46] of the spirit can you say amen he said
[1:09:50] see and we can have what we need for God
[1:09:53] wants to reveal his word to us by his
[1:09:57] spirit
[1:09:58] ain't that right I thank God for the
[1:10:00] translators aren't you I I thank God for
[1:10:03] for uh King James that's why we call it
[1:10:05] King James there's actually King James
[1:10:06] uh that that had different men uh uh uh
[1:10:11] take take the Scrolls or take whatever
[1:10:13] they they had and he wanted to make it
[1:10:16] known him but yet he wanted to be so
[1:10:17] accurate the best he could make it uh
[1:10:20] accuracy so he had different men take
[1:10:22] the Bible separate and and and and
[1:10:24] interpret it write it all down amen and
[1:10:27] it found out that then he came up with
[1:10:29] the best translations ain't that right
[1:10:32] but even then we find brother Branham
[1:10:34] even as a prophet correcting some of the
[1:10:36] translation even in King James
[1:10:42] ain't that right
[1:10:43] so so so again we need the spirit of God
[1:10:47] Amen and and so we we find that God
[1:10:51] isn't given us a greater understanding
[1:10:54] by giving us other translations of the
[1:10:56] Bible ain't that right amen he gives us
[1:11:00] understanding Revelation by his spirit
[1:11:04] amen and brother Branham said may God
[1:11:06] Begin by his Spirit to give us
[1:11:09] continuous life-giving and prevailing
[1:11:13] revelation
[1:11:15] that's what we need ain't that right so
[1:11:19] we find when we get a fresh Revelation
[1:11:21] and become the Living Word manifested by
[1:11:24] it then Prophet said we'll do the
[1:11:27] Greater Works and glorify God our Father
[1:11:29] in heaven when we get a fresh Revelation
[1:11:33] see what what has come in this age amen
[1:11:37] a revelation and become the Living Word
[1:11:40] manifested by that Revelation amen then
[1:11:43] we'll do the Greater Works and glorify
[1:11:46] God our Father ain't that right so it's
[1:11:49] in these Green Pastures in this open
[1:11:51] book in that Revelation that God has
[1:11:55] given this perfect interpretation by
[1:11:58] Divine Vindication is where we're made
[1:12:00] to rest at
[1:12:04] but then notice David said he leads me
[1:12:07] beside the Still Waters
[1:12:09] now we we we know we realize that the
[1:12:12] Green Pastures and and water speaks of
[1:12:15] life
[1:12:16] Still Waters signify rest peace
[1:12:19] quietness ain't that right
[1:12:21] water what does water represent the Holy
[1:12:23] Spirit
[1:12:26] ain't that right
[1:12:28] but notice
[1:12:29] David said Still Waters
[1:12:32] plural
[1:12:34] now I I'm personally looking at this and
[1:12:36] I I can't help but believe that it has a
[1:12:39] connection with Psalms 1.
[1:12:42] one and and three where David talks
[1:12:45] about the rivers of water
[1:12:47] and here in our scripture reading uh uh
[1:12:52] and and I won't keep you much longer but
[1:12:54] I want you to keep in mind what we're
[1:12:56] saying and and we'll go more into it
[1:12:58] Wednesday of of this the last third
[1:13:01] verse but next Wednesday the Lord
[1:13:04] willing but here in our scripture
[1:13:06] reading David Likens us as being sheep
[1:13:10] who are led to the waters
[1:13:13] in Psalms 1 3 David Likens us as a tree
[1:13:18] that is uh uh uh being planted uh uh by
[1:13:25] the rivers of water ain't that right now
[1:13:28] brother Branham identifies these Rivers
[1:13:31] as being nine different Springs coming
[1:13:34] from the same water supply
[1:13:37] so these rivers or Springs are the nine
[1:13:40] spiritual gifts that God placed within
[1:13:43] the body of Christ and notice they are
[1:13:47] flowing from the water
[1:13:50] Waters flowing from water
[1:13:53] ain't that right nine Rivers flowing
[1:13:56] from the same source of water ain't that
[1:13:59] right and the prophet says and that
[1:14:01] water is The Rock
[1:14:04] see that water came from from a rock
[1:14:07] ain't that right and that rock is Christ
[1:14:09] hey ain't that right now so it's the
[1:14:12] smitten Rock they're flowing from the
[1:14:14] smitten Rock which is Jesus Christ amen
[1:14:18] now I'm going to read a scripture Isaiah
[1:14:21] 32 and 1. where he says Behold a king
[1:14:25] shall reign in righteousness and princes
[1:14:27] shall rule in judgment and a man
[1:14:31] speaking of Christ Jesus a man shall be
[1:14:35] as in hiding place from the wind and a
[1:14:38] covert from the tempt us as rivers of
[1:14:42] water and a dry place as the shadow of a
[1:14:46] great rock in a dreary or in a weary
[1:14:49] land ain't that right so so a man shall
[1:14:53] be as Waters a man uh uh flowing in the
[1:14:58] desert uh so we we find that that rock
[1:15:02] in the wilderness was a type of Christ
[1:15:05] amen but then that rock become flesh
[1:15:08] amen become a man and dwelt Among Us
[1:15:11] ain't that right amen and notice notice
[1:15:15] because Jesus amen now here is that rock
[1:15:19] uh the uh uh in flesh amen and he went
[1:15:23] to the woman at the well and he told her
[1:15:26] whosoever drinks of the water that I
[1:15:29] shall give him shall never thirst but
[1:15:32] the water that I give him shall be in
[1:15:35] him a well of water springing up into
[1:15:39] everlasting life ain't that right so
[1:15:43] here he is offering water to her she was
[1:15:45] going to get water from the well and he
[1:15:48] says but if you'll look at and and ask
[1:15:50] of me to drink if you only knew the gift
[1:15:53] of God you would ask of him for a drink
[1:15:57] ain't that right and then he looks at
[1:15:59] and says but I will give you them Waters
[1:16:01] and and and and if you drink from these
[1:16:03] Waters you'll never ever never searched
[1:16:06] again and she needed a drink didn't she
[1:16:09] amen her life was internal her life was
[1:16:12] in sin it was messed up to where the
[1:16:15] church rejected her Society rejected her
[1:16:18] that he's offering her water oh my amen
[1:16:23] and and what happened amen she performed
[1:16:26] he performed the Messiah sign to her
[1:16:29] ain't that right that's right and she
[1:16:32] knew right then what he was talking
[1:16:34] about amen when he performed the Messiah
[1:16:38] sign and she could recognize that he was
[1:16:41] more than just a man flirting with her
[1:16:43] amen he wasn't just a man that wanted uh
[1:16:46] some business with her but he literally
[1:16:49] was the Messiah that could give her a
[1:16:52] drink can you say man oh then she began
[1:16:56] to ask oh give me the drink
[1:16:59] Hallelujah brother Branham said see she
[1:17:02] had seen it perfectly Vindicated amen
[1:17:05] that he was that Fountain of Life let me
[1:17:09] introduce her to you see she left that
[1:17:12] amen she left that amen when he was
[1:17:16] proved to be the word of life she left
[1:17:19] it and had discovered that the same rock
[1:17:21] that was smitten in the wilderness was
[1:17:24] sitting right there present before her
[1:17:26] amen and she left that old well of Jacob
[1:17:30] amen for a greater water can you say
[1:17:32] amen amen so what it tells us then is
[1:17:36] that these non-spiritual gifts these
[1:17:38] nine Rivers they are not coming from a
[1:17:42] fanatic they're not coming amen from uh
[1:17:46] uh uh uh uh Hypocrites make-believers
[1:17:50] they're they're not coming from
[1:17:51] Sensational the um emotion work up amen
[1:17:56] but they're coming from the very Rock of
[1:17:58] Life can you say Amen Jesus Christ these
[1:18:02] Rivers this Waters amen this streams are
[1:18:05] coming from the very Rock himself
[1:18:10] ain't that right
[1:18:11] amen yes sir amen and what when the
[1:18:15] woman the water that that woman had been
[1:18:18] drinking had lost its taste amen
[1:18:22] hallelujah and brother Branham says this
[1:18:25] he says let me say the same God that was
[1:18:28] in the days gone by that we speak so
[1:18:30] much of he is present here now not by
[1:18:35] some theological understanding but by a
[1:18:38] personal knowledge of his Vindication
[1:18:40] that he would pour out in this last day
[1:18:44] the Holy Spirit upon his church he is
[1:18:47] not and I was he is still the I am
[1:18:51] present tense always can you say amen
[1:18:55] amen in other words the the shepherd has
[1:18:59] led us not to Old stagnant Waters but
[1:19:03] he's led us to present tense Waters that
[1:19:06] the rock that was of yesterday is
[1:19:08] present here today amen and you don't
[1:19:11] have to read a Bible story to take a
[1:19:13] drink you can experience the same Rock
[1:19:16] and drink the same water amen that the
[1:19:19] the the lady at the whale had drank can
[1:19:22] you say Amen yes sir now we know the
[1:19:26] devil can impersonate any gift that God
[1:19:28] has you believe that but David isn't
[1:19:31] talking about something that's been
[1:19:33] impersonated amen he's talking about the
[1:19:36] genuine thing coming out of a genuine
[1:19:38] Source ain't that right all these Rivers
[1:19:42] all come from one source of water Amen
[1:19:45] brother Brown said Rivers what is that
[1:19:47] it's the nine spiritual gifts rivers of
[1:19:50] one water one Spirit one water coming
[1:19:54] from nine different resources of rivers
[1:19:56] of water see he says there are
[1:19:59] diversities of gifts some are called to
[1:20:00] prophesy some called uh give gift of
[1:20:03] healing some have the wisdom some have
[1:20:05] knowledge by The Same Spirit some speak
[1:20:07] with tongues some interpret all by The
[1:20:10] Same Spirit see for First Corinthians 12
[1:20:13] what is it rivers of many Waters many
[1:20:16] water many rivers of one water the Holy
[1:20:19] Spirit giving many gifts and blessings
[1:20:21] from everywhere he brings Rich gifts to
[1:20:24] you aren't you glad for that he brings
[1:20:27] Rich gifts to you gifts of healing Gifts
[1:20:31] of Salvation gifts of the Holy Spirit to
[1:20:33] work in your church and among the people
[1:20:36] see Rivers ain't that right now but
[1:20:39] notice I I I'm looking at this that that
[1:20:42] the the chapters 1 and and 23 of Psalms
[1:20:46] uh have something in common have a
[1:20:49] common ground and that is the waters
[1:20:51] amen God leads his sheep to Waters God
[1:20:55] plants his tree By the Waters ain't that
[1:20:59] right so water is very important to God
[1:21:03] brother Brandon even tells us in the
[1:21:05] house over why Bethlehem I believe it is
[1:21:07] why Bethlehem and and and he says that
[1:21:11] that Jesus Jesus is crying out for water
[1:21:14] today ain't that right the spirit of God
[1:21:17] crying out for water today and if you
[1:21:20] remember Amen brother Brown takes that
[1:21:23] of of David when David was a fugitive
[1:21:26] and and and uh he he the enemy had
[1:21:30] excommunicated him from his own City and
[1:21:34] and they had barred the the town the
[1:21:37] city of Bethlehem to where David
[1:21:39] couldn't get back in and in that City
[1:21:41] amen was Wells of living of of a
[1:21:45] fountain it was an Artesian whale I
[1:21:47] think that's how they put it it was an
[1:21:48] Artesian whale so it was fresh water it
[1:21:51] was cold water and and and so David you
[1:21:55] know uh he had been away from that water
[1:21:57] for a little while and and and so we we
[1:22:01] find that that now David did have water
[1:22:03] to drink from wherever he was but they
[1:22:06] were they were cisterns right the the
[1:22:10] water that he could drink was was a
[1:22:12] friend were cisterns and that that word
[1:22:14] cistern is uh an artificial Reservoir
[1:22:18] such as an underground tank for storing
[1:22:21] water like rain water or whatever but
[1:22:24] that water would get stagnant have y'all
[1:22:26] ever seen stagnant water I guess you
[1:22:28] have where you know the the little
[1:22:30] tadpoles and the little things that you
[1:22:32] know that it's just scummy and nasty and
[1:22:34] and well that's a sister and that's
[1:22:36] that's it's got water but the water's
[1:22:39] not flowing again and and so it gets
[1:22:41] stagnant and I'm sure being out in the
[1:22:43] desert and it's hot and and all that
[1:22:45] that water got hot as well and and it
[1:22:48] just something wasn't wasn't
[1:22:50] um uh desirable at all but but David he
[1:22:54] he began to desire a a cool fresh drink
[1:22:58] of that water amen from that Artesian
[1:23:02] whale ain't that right the Bible tells
[1:23:04] us that David cried out and said oh that
[1:23:07] one would give me a drink of the water
[1:23:09] of the whale of Bethlehem which is by
[1:23:12] the gate and and and and David's Mighty
[1:23:15] Men picked that up they heard him crying
[1:23:18] out for water and the Bible says that
[1:23:20] three of David's Mighty Men amen they
[1:23:23] buckled up amen they armored up amen and
[1:23:27] they said we're going to go get him some
[1:23:28] water see the the prophet said David's
[1:23:32] least desire was their command they knew
[1:23:35] he was coming into power they knew that
[1:23:38] one day he would be their King ain't
[1:23:41] that right amen and he's the the prophet
[1:23:44] says that they fought their way 15 miles
[1:23:47] through enemy territory to get a bucket
[1:23:50] of water for their King that was coming
[1:23:53] into Power amen 15 miles there and 15
[1:23:57] miles back of fighting the enemy ain't
[1:24:00] that right amen see and they regarding
[1:24:02] that bucket of water to give to the to
[1:24:05] give to David amen see and the and the
[1:24:08] Bible says that when he finally came
[1:24:10] into power they David made each one of
[1:24:13] them a ruler over a certain city and
[1:24:17] brother Brown says that's the type of
[1:24:19] the Overcomer today can you say Amen
[1:24:21] they overcame and gave water for their
[1:24:25] King amen because he desired it amen and
[1:24:29] Christ as today has been driven away
[1:24:32] from his own church and they will not
[1:24:34] let him back in the enemy has garrisoned
[1:24:38] him Amen to where he cannot come into
[1:24:40] the church can you say Amen Prophet said
[1:24:44] he's called Holy Roller he's cast off to
[1:24:46] one side he's a Fanatic in everything
[1:24:49] rejected by the churches they've got
[1:24:52] their Creeds and things drawn up in this
[1:24:54] Christmas like they did at the first one
[1:24:57] we know that but we know that this word
[1:24:59] ever remains true and it's got to be
[1:25:03] fulfilled everybody say it's got to be
[1:25:04] fulfilled amen and the desire of Christ
[1:25:08] is for men Warriors to stand and
[1:25:12] he said he's a fugitive to his own
[1:25:14] church they reject him they love their
[1:25:16] Creeds and big dignitaries instead of
[1:25:19] the word and they won't let him be
[1:25:22] manifested they won't let him be
[1:25:24] preached in his power they've cut away
[1:25:26] from it just like the Bible said they'd
[1:25:29] do in Revelation 17. what are they doing
[1:25:32] now going up here today and all going in
[1:25:35] this world a council of churches
[1:25:37] Catholicism and Protestants and uh uh
[1:25:40] uniting together making the mark and the
[1:25:43] image of the Beast and the Protestants
[1:25:44] falling right for it Pentecostals
[1:25:47] everywhere dignitaries going into Rome
[1:25:49] from Pentecost and coming back and
[1:25:51] saying you know most spiritual place and
[1:25:54] in Texas and everywhere else they're
[1:25:56] opening up and giving understanding of
[1:25:58] these stations and so forth knowing that
[1:26:01] that that's Creeds that's been injected
[1:26:04] to this word ain't that right but he
[1:26:06] said Jesus is crying for a fresh drink
[1:26:10] of water oh do you hear him tonight amen
[1:26:14] he's crying for a fresh drink of water
[1:26:17] amen see the only water that these
[1:26:20] churches have offered him amen is
[1:26:22] stagnated water water from broken
[1:26:24] cisterns ain't that right amen so
[1:26:27] noticed the cry that brother Branham
[1:26:29] gives out oh come stand with me by my

[1:27:53] hole through this line of unbelieving

[1:28:40] Pentecost not a bunch of caring on
[1:28:42] screaming hollering here I mean a
[1:28:45] genuine Holy Spirit baptism that

[1:29:01] standing Toe to Toe with the Enemy to

[1:29:07] flow
[1:29:10] brother Branham said see God's going to
[1:29:12] have a people that will drink from that
[1:29:14] well
[1:29:15] Hallelujah he said you might think me
[1:29:18] I'm crazy and maybe I am then I'm crazy
[1:29:20] about Jesus and his word if I have to be
[1:29:23] called a fool let me be called a fool
[1:29:25] for his word I've never been against the
[1:29:27] men in them organizations I'm against
[1:29:29] that system that's barring the word of
[1:29:32] God out let's cut Warriors stand by you
[1:29:36] see let's go into that well he is our
[1:29:40] Bethlehem ain't that right and in him is
[1:29:44] that water that's flowing these old
[1:29:47] cisterns the World Council of churches
[1:29:49] organizing now let's restore the fresh
[1:29:52] word of God not a denomination let's not
[1:29:55] take a Creed that's old stagnated
[1:29:57] cisterns that fell 40 years ago 20 years
[1:30:01] ago 30 years ago or either last year I
[1:30:05] want God's word that's promised for
[1:30:08] today that's the drink he wants me to
[1:30:11] have is this word today can you say amen
[1:30:15] I aren't you glad that you've been
[1:30:17] planted there aren't you glad your
[1:30:19] Shepherd has led you there you've got
[1:30:22] you know where the water is amen and
[1:30:25] wherever the pure word is that's where
[1:30:27] the spirit of God is amen and where that
[1:30:30] pure word is is where the Living Waters
[1:30:34] is flowing
[1:30:38] is that all right
[1:30:44] notice
[1:30:47] after that woman at the well tasted that
[1:30:50] water Living Water
[1:30:52] brother Brown said then the sister lost
[1:30:54] its taste
[1:30:56] and so does every man who ever falls
[1:30:58] into the power of God by the baptism of
[1:31:00] the Holy Ghost the denominational
[1:31:02] systems lose their taste you don't want
[1:31:05] no more of that stagnated frogs and
[1:31:08] lizards and bugs and so forth you're
[1:31:10] drinking from a fountain that's fresh
[1:31:12] and pure the word of God fresh every
[1:31:15] hour in your soul the same as now when
[1:31:19] the word has been proven to be the truth
[1:31:21] taste and see if it's not right can you
[1:31:24] say Amen see if it's not right see amen
[1:31:28] so he says seeds though the cistern had
[1:31:30] served its well uh it served its time
[1:31:33] well but you see the Fountain of Life
[1:31:36] was there not Jacob's Well no more for
[1:31:38] Spiritual drinking and see so what they
[1:31:41] thought if they drank from that whale
[1:31:43] why it would be all right but now the
[1:31:46] Fountain of life itself was sitting
[1:31:49] right there well I believed them Waters
[1:31:52] that David is talking about them both in
[1:31:54] chapters is the Water of Life can you
[1:31:57] say amen amen and and he's LED you not
[1:32:00] only just LED you to him but he's
[1:32:03] planted you right there by them
[1:32:05] oh that that that that means a lot can
[1:32:08] you say man oh yes sir so brother
[1:32:11] Branham says see the bright the Bright
[1:32:13] Tree had come up at Pentecost there's a
[1:32:16] tree that David saw see it's planted by
[1:32:19] the rivers of water One River the Holy
[1:32:21] Spirit and all these Waters flowing into
[1:32:24] it spiritual gifts flowing into it ain't
[1:32:26] that right and notice what David said
[1:32:29] about this tree his leaves cannot wither
[1:32:32] ain't that right and it will bring forth
[1:32:35] its fruit his fruit in his season
[1:32:39] ain't that right so then then as as I'm
[1:32:43] going to get ready to close appreciate
[1:32:45] your patience but one thing I'm getting
[1:32:47] out of these two scriptures is the word
[1:32:49] restoration
[1:32:50] David talks about it in Psalms 23 and 3
[1:32:54] we've talked about it he restoreth my
[1:32:57] soul ain't that right but we find that
[1:33:00] there is a restoration in Psalms one and
[1:33:02] three about that tree and brother
[1:33:04] Brandon would take us over into Joel
[1:33:07] ain't that right and where where Joel uh
[1:33:10] 2 25 God said I will restore to you the
[1:33:13] years that the Locust hath eaten the
[1:33:16] canker worm the caterpillar the Palmer
[1:33:18] worm my great Army which I sin among you
[1:33:20] and you shall eat in plenty and be
[1:33:24] satisfied Green Pastures ain't that
[1:33:27] right you will eat in plenty and be
[1:33:29] satisfied but notice see brother Branham
[1:33:33] says that what Joel is talking about
[1:33:35] he's talking about the tree that David
[1:33:38] talked about amen so the tree was
[1:33:41] attacked amen by that room and by that
[1:33:44] that that that demon ain't that right it
[1:33:46] was attack and the tree was cut down
[1:33:49] amen but the Bible people had already
[1:33:51] prophesied through David God would
[1:33:54] prophesy and says the Lee shall not
[1:33:56] wither amen the fruit it will bear its
[1:33:59] fruit but it took a restoration ain't
[1:34:01] that right it took a restoration just as
[1:34:04] much as God ordained you before the
[1:34:07] foundation of the world to be Sons and
[1:34:09] Daughters of God yet the devil trapped
[1:34:12] you the devil admired you the devil had
[1:34:14] you in a slave of sin but it took a
[1:34:17] restoration it could never deny God's
[1:34:19] word it could never take him away even
[1:34:22] take you away from what God had
[1:34:24] originally planted amen and the same
[1:34:26] thing about that tree God planted that
[1:34:29] tree by the rivers of water and the
[1:34:32] devil could not take it away from that
[1:34:33] water and the tree as the tree began to
[1:34:37] drink from that water it began to be
[1:34:39] restored again
[1:34:43] and you say Amen
[1:34:45] how can the tree be restored
[1:34:48] it was planted
[1:34:53] by the river of water
[1:34:55] brother Bremen said see it was planted
[1:34:57] by the rivers of water showing that it
[1:34:58] was predestinated to be there
[1:35:02] can you say man
[1:35:03] so it cannot die
[1:35:05] job talks about it Job 14 7 for there is
[1:35:08] hope of a tree if it be cut down
[1:35:11] that it will Sprout again
[1:35:13] and that the Tinder Branch their fourth
[1:35:16] thereof will not cease though the root
[1:35:19] thereof wax old in the earth and the
[1:35:22] stock thereof die in the ground yet
[1:35:24] through the scent of water it will but
[1:35:28] and bring forth balls bowls like a plant
[1:35:31] can you say man oh aren't you glad amen
[1:35:34] it will it will live it will be restored
[1:35:38] why you're planted by the rivers of
[1:35:40] water can you say man and David would go
[1:35:43] through the steps and he would show us
[1:35:46] that before the soul could be restored
[1:35:48] he was in the Green Pastures and he was
[1:35:51] lit to the Waters of Life can you say
[1:35:53] man and what was he drinking spiritual
[1:35:56] Waters he was drinking of something that
[1:35:58] would restore him back to where he began
[1:36:01] in the mind of God can you say man
[1:36:04] church and I'll just be honest if you
[1:36:06] don't partake of the Waters of Life
[1:36:08] you'll never be restored back you can
[1:36:11] know this Bible full backward and
[1:36:13] forward you can know all the quotes
[1:36:15] backward and forward but until you drink
[1:36:18] of the rivers of Life till you drink
[1:36:20] just like that woman at the whale drag
[1:36:23] you can never be back and restored again
[1:36:26] now that woman could drink from the
[1:36:28] Waters of life because she had
[1:36:29] representation in the mind of God can
[1:36:32] you say amen amen and God made sure that
[1:36:35] she could drink from the Waters of Life
[1:36:37] yes she was a prostitute yes she was no
[1:36:40] good yes she was an outcast of society
[1:36:42] that God made sure to give her a drink
[1:36:46] of fresh water
[1:36:53] going to be restored
[1:36:55] trees planted
[1:36:58] look at David did not David
[1:37:00] when the enemy come and got the sheep
[1:37:03] and took it out
[1:37:04] did not David the shepherd go after that
[1:37:07] sheep and restore it
[1:37:10] back to where he belonged
[1:37:13] and you say man
[1:37:16] now notice as we close
[1:37:18] brother Brown says about this this tree
[1:37:21] he says this man's that's planted he
[1:37:24] isn't stuck out
[1:37:26] he he isn't just you know set out
[1:37:28] transposed from this to that
[1:37:31] but he was planted everybody say he was
[1:37:33] planted let's make that personal I am
[1:37:37] planted
[1:37:39] predestinated to the rivers of water
[1:37:43] see he's got Roots then he's not just
[1:37:45] stuck out have you ever just stuck a you
[1:37:47] know a limb that you you took off of a
[1:37:50] tree and it may have all the roots and
[1:37:52] or or not the roots but the the leaves
[1:37:55] are still green and you stick it in the
[1:37:56] ground and give it the end of the day or
[1:37:59] whatever and the leaves are starting to
[1:38:00] wither give it another day too and
[1:38:03] before you know it it's it's stuck in
[1:38:05] the ground but it has no roots it was
[1:38:07] not planted ain't that right well so God
[1:38:11] did not stick you in the ground he
[1:38:14] planted you by the rivers of water see
[1:38:17] so the prophet said see he's
[1:38:20] predestinated to be there not just by
[1:38:23] chance he was predestinated to catch
[1:38:26] that word when it was sold means that
[1:38:29] they'll be right there when it sticks
[1:38:31] she is there he's planted not just a
[1:38:35] down but he's actually planted ain't
[1:38:38] that right so you know what that means
[1:38:40] then you're at home you're at home by
[1:38:43] the rivers of water had the rivers of
[1:38:46] life you're at home you're at the place
[1:38:48] amen where God has predestinated you to
[1:38:51] be can you say man that's where you
[1:38:53] belong
[1:39:01] so you're not just led to these
[1:39:03] Pentecostal waters for a day or two
[1:39:06] that God has planted you there by
[1:39:08] predestination
[1:39:10] so this shows that you didn't get to the
[1:39:12] Waters of life just like that the the
[1:39:15] event of the woman in the well meeting
[1:39:18] Jesus was not by chance
[1:39:20] it was not by accident
[1:39:22] it was by predestination
[1:39:25] can you say man
[1:39:27] now I don't know if any of that made
[1:39:29] sense to you tonight I hope it did in
[1:39:31] some way
[1:39:32] but all I know is this if you're
[1:39:34] predestinated to drink from that water
[1:39:36] it's not just for yesterday and it's not
[1:39:39] just for tonight but in your lowest of
[1:39:42] lows in The Valleys in your darkest of
[1:39:45] times that water is still there because
[1:39:48] you were planted there there ain't no
[1:39:50] devil big enough to take that away from
[1:39:52] you there ain't no trial big enough to
[1:39:54] take it away from you and you say well I
[1:39:57] used to be I just remember when I I was
[1:40:00] closer to God than I am now but you're
[1:40:02] planted by the rivers of water there's
[1:40:05] always restoration for you can you say
[1:40:08] man there's always restoration that's
[1:40:11] why bitterness cannot grip your heart
[1:40:12] amen that's why uh uh if you fall down
[1:40:16] you're going to get back up that's
[1:40:18] that's why the habits are falling off
[1:40:20] that's why all these things because he
[1:40:22] planted you by the rivers of water can
[1:40:24] you say man which is a fountain where
[1:40:26] you'll never thirst again aren't you
[1:40:29] glad you're satisfied that you're never
[1:40:31] having a thirst again you're planted in
[1:40:33] the right place you're not going from
[1:40:35] revival to Revival that you can be in
[1:40:38] the in the desert to The Darkest Hour of
[1:40:41] your life and you're still prospering
[1:40:43] because he planted You By the Waters
[1:40:48] that means a lot
[1:40:51] Abraham said because it's predestinated
[1:40:53] the tree can't die
[1:40:56] now listen because your soul is a gene
[1:40:58] seed of God you cannot die
[1:41:01] he restoreth my soul
[1:41:03] ain't that right
[1:41:05] amen see the real brother Brown said the
[1:41:08] real ordained of God that real uh Gene
[1:41:11] that real germ a soul of God that was in
[1:41:14] God before the foundation the room the
[1:41:16] world remember you that's really got the
[1:41:18] spirit of God in you tonight you were
[1:41:20] here in Christ because he was the
[1:41:23] fullness of the word
[1:41:25] another place you have an immortal soul
[1:41:27] that cannot die
[1:41:29] that's not that's not made with atoms or
[1:41:31] with hydron hydrogen uh or with oxen
[1:41:35] oxygen or with anything that's on this
[1:41:37] Earth it's made by spirit that almighty
[1:41:40] God created himself and give it to you
[1:41:43] can you say Amen
[1:41:45] so that tree is planted by the wall
[1:41:47] rivers of water and its roots are
[1:41:49] drawing from that water and so therefore
[1:41:52] it cannot die
[1:41:54] can you say man and its leaves cannot
[1:41:57] wither it's bringing forth its fruit and
[1:42:00] in in hopefully Lord willing we will get
[1:42:03] more into that that that David is
[1:42:05] talking about the same thing about the
[1:42:07] man about the Sheep amen he leadeth me
[1:42:11] in the paths of righteousness for his
[1:42:14] name's sake you'll find that the tree
