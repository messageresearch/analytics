sister hope do you have a song Jehova God almightyy Prince of Peace that's why we create an atmosphere of worship for him to come him to speak the word to our hearts that the spirit could just meet every [Music] need in the Pres [Music] of the king as they just play softly we want to make ready for the word of God and um uh just the announcement that there will be no Sunday school in the morning and so just uh just keep that in mind but we're we're happy to have brother Jonas hild Brandt and uh with us today and and of course brother Isaac and and um we appreciate his love for the Lord and um for the message of the hour and his dad is a pastor there in Canada somewhere he can tell you where and uh but brother Kelly Hil de brand and his his father and and doing a just a wonderful work up there and uh but uh so we just uh just really honored to have him and uh wished his whole family could come but uh uh he's got brother Isaac as a sidekick and and uh so hopefully we'll get him to sing or whatever and uh so but we want him to come if everybody could just stand to your feet and I think this is the most important part of the service is uh the word of God and um you know the the message taught us that Christ is the word he's more than just Spirit he is he is word and um if if he could just speak to our hearts that's what we want that that word to come and whether it's reproof whether it's just encouragement whatever it is but I I've I've I'm a witness that if you're dealing with something in your life whether it's sin whether it's oppression discouragement whether it's just sickness or whatever it is physically mentally spiritually when that word comes forth it has the ability to drive them Spirits away and break the feathers I've seen it amen time and time again I've had it happen in my life there's times that I have come and visiting Minister coming and just fighting things in my mind maybe discouragement and uh and and you know you're you're worshiping God and entering in and then the the ministers just start speaking and it's almost like he's personally directing it to you and and I've just had the that that burden just lift and I know the power of the word I know what it is that if we could just believe it and and receive it and just amen the word it doesn't matter who's preaching it it just matters the word Goes Forth amen and if we can just believe it and how many's got a need in your heart and whatever it would be amen I've seen the physical blind eyes open just by the preaching of the gospel I've seen the crippled walk just through the preaching of the gospel I've seen The Sinner saved by the preaching of the gospel and I promise you God is here to do that today amen praise the Lord so let's just sing it again in the presence [Music] of [Music] Jehovah God [Music] Almighty oh hearts are and there in the presence oh of the king amen aren't you grateful for that presence what a what a wonderful Lord we have that's mindful of each of us amen and it's a privilege to be here today and uh if you'd like you could have your seats and uh I'm going to play a song on the guitar yeah amen well thank you br well I'm not much of a a

was my first time ever preaching outside of our home church at his brother's place brother wends and uh I just uh I'm sure enjoyed the Martin family and to see so many people that uh serve the Lord and I think he had a good mom and a good daddy amen and brought him up well and and you can see the fruits of their labor still coming uh up through their children and I think it pays to do things right from the beginning amen [Music] and um I'm going to try this song here in the key of D and that'd be great if you played along I'm going to go g to C and then it's pretty simple Moses stepped into Egypt fire in his eyes he said [Music] I'm taking God's people with me going to a promised land pharoh and your army they don't mean a thing to God and me the I am is sent me I believe what he said is true [Music] the plagues began to fall Faith began to rise and the captives became free we're taking all our families our loved ones and the children we're not going to leave no one behind no matter what you bring against us our got is standing for us by his grace we will arise Moses came to the river heard the hoof beats of The Sinner growing louder at his back he stepped up to the waters they soon became parted for God had a promise and we [Music] believe we're taking all of our families our loved ones and their children we're not going to leave no one behind no matter what you bring against us our God is standing for us by his grace we will arise the horsemen and his rider they perished in the waters by God's great wonderful plan Satan and all his cronies they will soon burn down to ashes according to the Revelation prophecy oh Satan were're taking all of our families our loved ones and their children we're not going to leave no one behind no matter what you bring against us our God is standing for us by his grace we will [Music] arise amen you believe that amen we're not going to leave a hoof behind we're taking everyone with us amen God gave them to us and we're not going to let them be taken away aren't you grateful that he's mindful Amen in this [Music] life we are faced with [Music] choices sometimes we choose the right and sometimes we choose the wrong often times we Face decisions not knowing where to go or where to turn it's then we look up and see Jesus looking down he says somebody love loves you yes somebody really cares these trials that we're facing I'm going to help us make it over there into heaven keep your eyes on his pred word it'll guide you through a all all every time somebody loves [Music] you yes my Jesus really [Music] cares you

than you even want to desire him God is right there wanting to be a part of you amen we bring you greetings from our pastor in in Saskatoon Saskatchewan it's a cre word and so it's a twister you know brother Jonathan's had us and he can't say it either so you did well to just pass it off to me but no my daddy's been a pastor there for 25 years this year and um God called him uh just uh at my age he was 39 years old never preached a sermon in his life and uh and he's been just a tremendous blessing um God knows when to place a man in a position for the right season of time do you believe that amen and so we just uh uh love my dad brother Kelly and um and some of you maybe uh remember brother Harold hild de Brandt uh yeah so that would be my grandfather's first cousin and so uh he's been a tremendous blessing as well uh for the bride amen and we just are grateful to share the same name as him and trust that uh we can do our part as we are here now and he's gone off to his reward amen amen tonight we're going to speak to you just real simple uh maybe a bit of a Sunday school young people's type of a thing and uh and I trust it'll be a blessing we're going to speak uh on with all our heart uh the title and and one thing that I just I love about the message is um we can see how the word brings every bride member into Unity amen and and it's it's just unfailing uh because we're on the same diet amen and and there's this connection by that Same Spirit brother brandham said so many times how do we get into the bride and it's by one Spirit you are baptized into one body amen it's not a church it's not a group uh in terms of a fellowship a hall but it's a universal bride member that's coming together amen and and I just love the uh the message for that uh not bringing us out of balance but uh zeroing Us in on the target amen hallelujah if you'd like to stand we're going to turn in our Bibles to 1 Samuel uh chapter 17 um that's 1 Samuel 17 uh verse 32 amen and where I'm from it's cold outside so it's about 0° Fahrenheit there and and we hit Celsius and Fahrenheit meets at minus 40 and so we had that for about 14 days this year and and we do still survive uh we don't just travel around on the um dog sled teams we have vehicles like you guys and so you know we're normal we're thankful for those cars amen but uh yeah it's a my wife sends her love as well I've been married this year will be my 20th anniversary and we've got uh four lovely children Hannah is my eldest she's 17 and then we've got Isaac with me here today A fine young man loves the Lord and and Isaac is 15 I think almost and then uh I have a Jesse uh who is uh 13 and a Gabriel we got only one Angel amen we're grateful for him amen so they are all praying for the meetings and trusting that God will move uh according to his purpose uh so we thank thank the Lord for that 1st Samuel 17:32 and David said to Saul let no man's heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine verse 33 and Saul said to David Thou Art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth and he a man of war from his Youth and David said unto Saul thy servant has kep his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and I went out after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me I caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him thy servant slew both The Lion and the bear and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them seeing he hath defied the army of the Living God Amen let's just pray Heavenly Father we come to you this this evening so thankful father for this church and what it stands for Lord and thankful for your word Lord how it's been ministered and there's an altar here where lives have been changed we thank you Father that we could come into this this building again that you've made uh privilege for it Lord and but father we know that in our own elv we are uh but a vapor Lord and we're totally depending upon you now dear Jesus to come and to open this word unto us both the speaker and the hearer today we ask dear Jesus that you would uh anoint the message now father I yield myself both Body Soul and Spirit to you now Lord and and I ask father Use Me For Your Glory that the name of Jesus might be lifted on high Lord that lives would be changed Lord that those that are sick would be healed father that those that are struggling in mental battle would have Victory today Father we believe that you're able to do that and we're looking forward to the victories we ask it for your blessing Lord For Your Glory in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you you're welcome to have your seats and amen from David's youth uh he knew that he was sent from God because he had gifts and callings the Bible tells us are without repentance election and calling is sure and David he'd learned that it's not him that willth nor him that runneth but it was God that showeth Mercy it's not necessarily what I want but it's to do the will of God Amen and for us we as Christians know it's God's will to save the Lost can we say amen and we know that it's God's will to heal the sick do you believe believe that amen healing is in God's promise it's in the word and salvation is is God's promise it's in the word and and we know we believe that God's word it never fails amen so during the early years of David knowing this in his own heart uh the nation of Israel had went off into a bad spot and they had wanted to be like the world and and they had said give us a king and so God had given them a king after the people's heart King Saul and and Saul rose up uh you know little in his own eyes but with time as God gave Victory he became puffed up feeling that he really was a somebody that he really had part to play and and we know that brother brandham taught us that when that happens God just puts you on the Shelf until you humble yourself back down and then he can use you again Hallelujah so David had seen this and uh and and he was uh uh preparing himself God preparing him rather for the work that was coming ahead amen they wanted to be like the rest of the world so God gave them a king and and and I've heard it myself at times where you'll go to a church and somebody will say well you know we we would like to uh go to the movies uh or or this church here they they allow girls to cut their hair uh or this church that they wear the short dresses and and and I've said well why would we want to go on the devil's territory Hallelujah we've been given the privilege to live above those things of the world can we say Amen so we don't want to be like those uh uh seeking Assa going after you know the the ways and the effects of the other assemblies per se if there be some like that here but we want to stay on that straight and narrow way knowing that it leads to safety hallelujah amen bless the Lord now now I'm not really a legalist myself but I believe that the gospel can change a person person Hallelujah we don't have to cope with Spirits we don't have to uh uh deal with demons in our lives but we believe in total Deliverance Hallelujah we believe that we can arise and be free it's our privilege being a blessed Children of the Lord amen now a true filling of the Holy Spirit just changes everything Hallelujah it'll save you it'll clean up your life it'll cleanse every dirty spot we sing that song what can wash away my sins now all man was born in sin and came into the world speaking lies Hallelujah and when Jesus came he hasn't redeemed our flesh yet now our Spirits have been redeemed but our flesh well it still gets sick and you know there's there's times where even Paul said when I do good evil is present we make mistakes and but that isn't our Destiny we're moving to a body that'll be perfect that is very soon in the peripheral it's just ahead of down the road but down here we may be struggling just a little bit at times with oh I did that the other day and the devil's coming and he's beating on your mind with condemnation and all you have to do is say thank you Jesus for the blood there's a crimson stream that's flowing and it and it makes me white as snow I was seen in Revelations as a bride in a perfect spotless garment now that was not my perfection but Christ came and perfected me Hallelujah do you believe that amen and he makes my temple beautiful in his in his sight in the book of Jude the Bible says and unto the only true wise God who is able to keep me from falling well what a powerful state to be able to be uh uh to eliminate falling but you know that word they falling doesn't mean exempt from mistakes it means not a Cast Away seeing how Satan fell out of Heaven as a cast away no longer no more remission for his sin he was cast out he fell from his seat but God is able to keep me from falling Hallelujah I believe David had quite a personal testimony about this point right here because David was not a perfect man but David served a perfect God Amen Hallelujah not only does Jesus save me his power continues to keep me saved Hallelujah not only does he heal me but he continues to keep me healed when I get sick again amen and we know that David was a man after God's Own Heart brother brandham said that he was actually a Divine healer he healed with music hallelujah how many enjoyed our musicians up here today aren't you grateful to be blessed by those amen let's give them a hand amen hallelujah amen I I started playing the uh the piano at our assembly when I was 15 years old um judah's age I guess and uh and i' been I'm still playing it uh um with a lot of encouragement uh so those of you that are musicians it's a battle you know and and and your mind thinks well I'm not good enough but you are because it's predestined that you'd be doing it how do we know that because you're doing it so it's God's plan to have you there and so you can be confident that you didn't put yourself in that spot I trust but God placed you there so that way you could be a blessing to the body amen a and so in that God will use that music to heal yes he'll use that music to bring Deliverance Hallelujah he'll use that music to prepare for the moving of the word it says that way when this preaching comes forth there will be Deliverance do you do you believe that amen so we're thankful for god-given talented musicians now I I am not not well taught um I I just play by ear mostly um and I I make lots of mistakes we have a a a theme back home if you hit the wrong note twice they'll think it was right I don't know if it's a good one but that's the way we do it back home Hallelujah and you know it just takes a little bit of that nervousness away it is that way it's not about playing it right it's not about being the best preacher it's not about but it's just Allowing God to use you and and you know I would play and as a young man I'd be coming up and I'd be thinking sometimes you know I'm getting better I'm getting pretty good and and then I would just really mess up the next song you know and I realized that I needed to pray and you know it's it's almost like being a minister you're you're fighting devil spirits and we seen David fighting off these evil spirits with his harp as he would come in you know think about this out of a two million some odd people how would they have found David to be a cunning player of the harp you know he was on the backs side of the desert forgotten when Samuel came and somehow he was noted to be a cunning player of the harp I don't have any Scripture on it but I think they must have had some sort of a recital you know sometime where they come together and and that that playing would have just calmed people you know and and somebody in that high level close to the king would have remembered there was somebody because their mind went well Saul needs to be freed of this evil spirit now remember Saul was not lost he just lost his position while he was in the flesh because of a mistake but Saul was saved he went to Paradise you remember right but now we're going to send David and they found David this cunning player of the harp amen it just brought brought a lot of joy to my my heart when I thought how David was found and moved into position and I believe it's the same uh for every musician uh they are called by God for a a position for a role Hallelujah to be used for his glory to create that atmosphere so when you're all said and done and and you're done criticizing you make sure you look at that musician and you thank them for their their efforts you know thank you sis and each one that was up here the the guitar and the bass player and and all of that it's a tremendous blessing amen and God will just continue if you stay humble to move you further into your ministry and all of a sudden you'll be like me looking 25 years behind you and thinking I don't know how I got this far but I made it and you you'll probably quit a few times but you know just brandom the Bible tells us to just get up and try again don't don't be embarrassed Hallelujah I've turned quite red at times but hallelujah it's good for you you know God's doing something when you're in that spot and here David was being trained he was moved close to the king to see how a king needed to operate it's just awesome how God does things God testified of David in Acts 13:22 he says and when he had removed him he raised up unto them David to be their King a removed Saul to whom also he gave testimony and said I have found David the son of Jesse a man after mine own heart which shall fulfill all my will Hallelujah that was God's testimony what a what a testimony you know you can look at that time and really there was a a quite a church split that happened over there uh in Israel when David came to the throne the whole Kingdom became divided and David was over here and it was it Jobo uh I think it was uh was over here and and it looked like David was out of the will of God but he was the anointed the one that was risen up to bring Deliverance to Israel Hallelujah now we're getting a little ahead of ourselves but won't try to otherwise I'll be way longer than brother Sean God provided Hallelujah we thank the Lord in Deuteronomy 30:6 the Bible says and the Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart and the Heart of thy seed to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul that thou mayest live and that's just the thing you might feel that I am I'm not qualified but God will circumcise thine heart and your seed that are after you to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and that's our subject today with all our heart an important key in David's life is David was quick to ask for forgiveness when he fell he was quick to be obedient to the will of God noticing that mistakes don't separate you from God but remaining in error is what separates you because when you're in that spot you've allowed the devil to talk you out of the word hallelujah in FA Faith once delivered to the Saints brother brandom says I got lots of respect for a man when he does make a mistake he's got courage enough to rise and try again we're all going to make mistakes the best makes mistakes but a soldier is not one who will lie down when he's knocked down but with rise up again we used to sing this little song Let Me rise and try again and I like that for I have made brother brandom saying I have made many mistakes in my life as we all have but I've always been thankful to God for Grace to let me rise and try again not a cast away but to him that's able to keep you from falling Hallelujah so don't focus on what was done right wrong whether it was you or someone else but focus on the promise made by God Almighty and rise and try again everything David did he did it with all of his heart over in Psalms 42:1 David said as the heart panteth after the water Brook so panteth my soul after thee Oh God my soul thirsteth for God for the Living God When shall I come and appear before him hallelujah what a confidence David gained by putting his whole trust his whole being all his faith rested with God not with David no but he put his trust in one that could not fail Hallelujah in Psalms 27:1 the Bible says the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes come upon on me to eat up my flesh they stumble and fall though an host should encamp against me with my my heart shall not fear say me my heart shall not fear Hallelujah though War should rise against me in this will I be confident because God's already fought that battle for us the battle is the Lord's but the Victory Is Ours amen aren't you grateful that he's figh fighting your battles for you Hallelujah the one that's never lost the battle is standing at the very entrance of your battle saying put me into action but you've got to call him on the scene you've got to say I Trust You Lord just like David did you've got to say I believe you can deliver me and then God will come moving on the scene he might do it a little different avenue than what you'd like it it might be like what are you doing God I don't know but that's because that's God's way amen not our way God's not going to deliver us by according to our way but God will come in his perfect will and he'll bring things to pass amen amen do you believe that wisdom to man is foolish to God but wisdom to God sometimes we don't understand it but it's still God's wisdom Amen in possessing all things brother brandom says the promise is yours but if you ever get it you ain't going to get it easy I'm going to tell you that you're going to have to take it away from Satan Satan captures your health you've got a right to go to Satan and say give it back hand it over I come in the name of the Lord the possessor of heavens and earth and I'm his Heir say that's me Hallelujah give it back brother brandom says you took my child you got her mixed up with the wrong boy or you took my boy and mixed him up with the wrong girl but I claim claim them that's right I claim my children I claim my brother I claim my sister yes Satan you've took them from God's house you've coaxed them out there but I'm coming after them I claim them do you believe that now we as adopted children we possess the deed the tital deed given to us at Calvary it's mine devil amen we could say give me back my health when we're sick amen we could say give me back my joy when we lose our joy thank the Lord give me back my marriage if there's trouble in your marriage give me back my child give it back Satan it's my property do you believe that amen my father owns it and I come by a right of inheritance I'm his child amen we know the Bible says healing is the children's bread Hallelujah I would that my people would be well so if you're sick just take the promise and don't look at the symptoms brother brandom taught us but you look to that promise and you say that is my promise I am walking towards my promise by his stripes I am healed victory is mine Hallelujah I'm going to arise and I'm going to be well amen believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thy and thy house shall be saved it doesn't just say part of your house it says all of your house can we say all Hallelujah that is your possession God didn't just give you some serpent seat for kids God has given you bride seats Hallelujah do you believe that amen hallelujah those are ours and we are Gods so by a right of adoption we can come and we can say with authority that is my child amen hallelujah they might get worse but they're coming home [Music] amen amen I I wrote that song we're we're taking our families our loved ones and our children we're not going to leave no one behind uh we just had a a brother in our church that's my age that just walked away from his family and went into the world and and God inspired me to write that song for him because I believe that we're not going to lose a one we're not leaving a hoof behind we don't have to settle for some broken and tore up life down here but we can go after them and we can claim them our Prophet taught us that do you believe that that is our property amen oh they might get scars they might be a little bit like Samson they might step aside and and and not give God their entire heart and they'll suffer for that well they'll reap what they sow but Samson was still an elected bride member and he's going to be there whether his his hair got cut and it wasn't supposed to or not he'll be there whether he went after the wrong girlfriend or not Hallelujah but God will bring him there and God will do the same for your child there's no circumstance too hard Our God Is Bigger he's powerful more Mighty than anything the devil has the devil's just a counterfeit do you believe that Hallelujah so we can have confidence when we pray we can ask anything in the name of Jesus Jesus Christ and it shall be granted that's the word that's what we believe amen that's right we're Believers Devils so step aside in the name of Jesus Christ who's given us the right that we could ask anything in his name Hallelujah in John 14:14 the Bible says if you ask anything in my name I will do it so give back our property devil whether it's sickness whether it's doubt what whatever it is maybe you're questioning something you just go and you take back your property you say he's promised to give me a sound mind I can have peace I don't have to be all tore up I can have freedom in the love divine amen now the devil he'd stolen from shamgar for years but there came a day when shamgar he just had enough and he stood with faith against the enemy and the enemy fell now it wasn't shamgar that killed that devil it was his hand that done it but it was the power of God that delivered shamgar do you believe that Hallelujah there was a time when Gideon needed to be stirred up and God chose Gideon Hallelujah and Gideon stood whether with lots or with few and he conquered the enemy was it Gideon that done it it was God that done it Gideon was their present Hallelujah we heard a song on the three Hebrew children Hallelujah and those boys they had faith in the word of God and they believed in the promise Hallelujah they didn't have any Scripture they didn't have any word for it but they knew that there was a God in heaven that could interpret dreams that could uh uh tell them what was happening and they believed in their prophet of the day Hallelujah so they said well we don't know if we'll be delivered from the fire or not but we believe and we're not willing to bow down to worship some Idol hallelujah amen and they was delivered Daniel was not armed by the Lions Hallelujah was it Daniel that protected himself no it was God that came down and protected so I'm I'm telling yes amen it it's not you that's got the power but you've got the authority you've got the title deed in your hand and you can look at that devil and you can say this is the word I'm a Believer now I might be the weakest of Christians but I know when I go on my knees I know that you're trembling so Satan give it back in the greatest battle ever fought brother Bram says see his attack watch listen close his attack is what disbelieving God's word that's his attack there can you see the greatest battle was ever fought there's only two forces that's Satan and that's God yes what is Satan's weapon against you is to try to get you to disbelieve your weapon he disarms you let's brother says let's real quiet down now listen if we can if if he can get you to disbelieve your weapon is equivalent if he gets you to believe that your weapon is not strong enough he has disarmed you Hallelujah right so brother brandom he says look he's disarmed you you when he gets you to disbelieve that weapon when you lay that down that finishes your fight you're done true so he's telling you hold that weapon don't you lay it down down Hallelujah are you willing to hold that weapon up now what is that weapon that weapon is a faith in the finished work of Calvary that weapon is I believe that God has sent me the seventh Church age messenger I believe that that word is the message to the final age do you believe that Hallelujah I believe that this Bible is true it's Vindicated Hallelujah you know if we didn't have a Bible we wouldn't know about a message those two go hand in hand you can't separate one from the other they dovetail from Genesis to Revelations Hallelujah but we believe that that is the word of God and and we know the Bible says heavens and earth shall pass away but my word shall dwell forever Hallelujah so now you could take something of Eternal value and we know that Satan isn't Eternal Hallelujah Satan is coming to a demise he's got a an appointment at the back of the book in Revelation where he's going to a lake of fire Hallelujah I'm going to help push him in I don't know about you I'm going to enjoy it hallelujah amen there's going to be a moment in time where he's going to be finished but God's word will still abide Hallelujah a and which part of you is going to be there that part of you that listen to the word that word that's within you the word is nigh thee even in thy heart Hallelujah that word that that I'm feeding on daily day by day that that spiritual Mana that's coming into my soul they can my brother-in-law sings that song lock me in a prison and throw away the key deprive me of the food that I eat but I've got Jesus you can't take away from me the revelation of the truth of this hour Hallelujah do I got a witness in here hallelujah do we got some Believers in here that you believe this message that you believe this Bible is true that you believe Jesus Christ is risen from the grave Hallelujah do we got some Believers in here amen well then you can March against the devil with your weapon in your hand Hallelujah with a weapon sharper than a two-edged sword Hallelujah piercing and dividing amen Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever the same God who opened the Red Sea he's still present he's still alive and well the same God that fell in the day of Pentecost in acts the same God that raised up Lazarus from the grave he's still the same yesterday today and forever uh Peter said on the day of Pentecost this is that and brother Brandon says if this isn't that I'll just keep this till that comes for I believe this is that Hallelujah I do too I'm convinced that this that it's the gospel and the power and the demonstration of the resurrection of the appearing of the Lord Jesus in this last day Hallelujah making the church ready to be caught away in the bride Hallelujah do you believe that are you dressing yourself in this word is it changing you from glory to glory you know I I I'd just like to say has anybody in here been touched by the Lord could I get some could you stand up if you've been healed amen if you've been healed of a disease of some sort now look at that now I maybe you've had to overcome some conflict in life you just take a look around and you could see the devil's losing he's just nothing but a bluff he's nothing but a loser because Jesus Christ the chief Captain is still alive and well he's still delivering amen oh bless the Lord aren't you grateful that you're on The Winning Side aren't you grateful that you heard the voice and it came and changed your life Hallelujah so I believe that we ought to be serving the Lord with all of our hearts amen we ought not to be holding back there should be no hold back you can sit down there should be no hold back in your life Hallelujah because what has God done in your life what has he done he's provided he's paid my power bill Hallelujah he's filled up my vehicle with fuel bless the Lord he's given me a job I thank the Lord for it he's he's blessed me with my family what has the good things God has done and then I'm going to come to church and fall asleep because I'm tired no I say pinch yourself arise and be doing it's time to be building on the temple which Temple no you not you're a holy Temple amen it's time to be building on the temple and just you know when God that word comes by and and it maybe strikes you a little different than what you've heard well what should you do you should go and you should study it out not just go home and talk about the pastor you should go home and you should pray and and dig into the word and say Lord what are you trying to tell me here I maybe didn't understand what brother Jonah said today h I didn't understand how he was so but Lord maybe you're trying to tell me something I believe I prayed for the service I asked you to come and speak to me you ought to have done that and so Lord I'm expecting that you spoke today because that's what I prayed so there wasn't any false Doctrine ministered today because I prayed that there wouldn't be Hallelujah that's your job if something's going wrong at the pulpit it's because you haven't done your job out there amen you've got a great job to do Amen to keep the body clean amen what did Brother brandham say that the gifts were in the body for the speaking in tongues and all of that it was to keep the body clean now he never uh uh God never just you know put something on the shelf and we don't need that no more no God continues to add horsepower he continues to just make it a little better make it a little bit more powerful oh sure they go off in Pentecost and we know all about that but we're in the message we're the Bride of the lord we don't have to worry about that nonsense I hope amen amen amen bless the Lord I better get back on my notes I'll get in trouble I'm just an evangelist today so brother Sean can straighten it all up when I'm gone and the other pastors I feel so blessed to have these brothers here all the ministers and I'm Just a Nobody I I I'm really just a small little one amongst these Mighty Men God bless your Ministries and we're thankful for you all and the labor that you Brothers have labored uh rolling out the paving the road for me that I might be able to come Amen brother brandom and by faith Moses says what good is a God that could deliver from the fiery furnace the Hebrew children if he isn't the same God today what good is a God that would judge between right and wrong wrong in a day gone by and punish the wrong and bless the right if he isn't the same God today what do we go to church for why do we abstain from the things of the world if he isn't the same God of the same judgment and the same opinion that he always was what good would it be for a God who could touch a woman's hand with a raging fever and the fever stop if he isn't the same God today what good would it be to serve a god who could call his friend from the grave after being dead for our days if he isn't the same God today brother brandham he's getting to something here but by faith we believe that some glorious day he shall call us from the earth though we be a spoonful of Ashes again how do we prove it we do not prove it we believe it we're not asked to prove anything but we're asked to believe and we've got all this nonsense now people trying to out profit the prophet and disprove what we know to be real what we know to be true and they're looking for a proof we're not to prove anything the Bible says only believe what was it that Jesus says when I come back will I find faith on Earth he wasn't looking for some great psychology or or some magnificent Minister that could put it all together in just such a perfect way he was looking for simple Faith Hallelujah so that gives me hope because I can't do all those other things but I can only believe I can hold to the promise of God and I can say Lord I can't see how it'll be done but I know you promised it and if you promised it I know that you're the same yesterday today and forever in Isaiah 54:17 the Bible declares no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me saith the Lord so I'm not standing here on my own righteousness my righteousness is filthy rags but the Bible declares that I'm standing on the very righteousness of God and that's what's holding me that's what's going to take me from glory to Glory Hallelujah in Revelations 5:12 the Bible says sang with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessings and I believe Jesus Christ is worthy he's the only worthy one amongst us he deserves all of our praise Hallelujah he deserves everything I can give him if that means that I'm to vacuum this church I ought to do it with all my heart Hallelujah if that means that I I'm to pray and my job is to be a prayer Warrior I say be a real Warrior pray without ceasing just be constant in prayer fervent zealous your name maybe never gets called you maybe never come up for a special but you've got the greatest role out of any person to pray brother brandham says that that what is the uh uh uh how do I do so well in the meetings it's because there's those that are praying for me they're the ones that bring the victory Hallelujah Prayer Changes Things amen we ought to be praying more the Devil comes along and he makes us so busy and he distracts Us in so many ways he's got he he's a master at it he's been tring this for 6,000 years but I say greater is he that's within me I say prick your conscience stir up your minds and get back to a prayer life get back to having communion with God back to a a all night prayer meeting would be a good thing right now I'd say amen back to a a fellowship with the love divine not just to go to church on on Sunday and then go to the restaurant Sunday afternoon but a real fervent a desire to see God moving on the neighborhood a desire to see God moving on on our families that are maybe from without that we don't see often Hallelujah was it at isusa Street Revival where they prayed and it was how many six blocks out I believe it was that people would fall under the conviction of the Holy Spirit by prayer amen and lives be changed healings be happening there was no preaching it was prayer in those instances read the testimony of it sometime what an example we'll get back to David here we find David being called from his father's sheep I like that he was working and he went to uh uh to the castle and he delivered Saul from all of those spirits and then there be there there comes the battle David and Goliath you know all the boys like David and Goliath and I I think the girls like Esther or Hannah or something right right and we need to write a song only a girl named Esther I don't know anymore we have to write that brother Sean you know we got David with his sling and Esther but you know David left the castle and he went back right straight to his job you know he didn't just take a holiday he just left the palace and playing the harp and and and he was an example and then his dad called him to bring some cakes and uh and deliver those down to the captains and and some cheeses and whatnot and so he's bringing his cart down there and and so he comes up to the scene of the battle and excitement and all the armaments and the port cutlasses Pro no they didn't have those quite yet but they had swords and Spears and Shields and daggers and armor all over the place and uh and then there were some Cooks over there no doubt then they was doing the real work at this time these guys were all scared Hallelujah and it got real quiet and all of the work that happened at the battlefield everybody was listening there was a devil that had placed a spell of unbelief on God's Army and they had lost their faith because this Goliath was so tall and so strong and so well protected uh how possible could it be to kill such a mighty mighty Giant and they were scared all of Israel the whole host they didn't know how they could uh Break Free yeah the people of Israel knew where he was from they knew about his father and about his mommy and they'd done all their research on Google and they knew the doctors and the devils and they knew everything about him and they knew he'd never been conquered they were scared they knew the promise of God but it just seemed so impossible they they looked at the simp symptoms and the pain and the discomfort and they could hear this boast and the chain mail and the spear and my it was just overwhelming these Israelites but wait David heard and he didn't look at the problem his mind went straight to the promise who's this uncircumcised lying low down good for nothing devil who is this guy that would dare speak let Al show himself he wasn't cowed down by a uh this demon he he'd try to stop the move of God this devil attempt to take away peace and attack our worship and uh let's cast them out who's fighting with me David said well David was in for a surprise even uh Abner and uh and Saul and all of his brothers uh they kind of thought he was just some madeup stuffed shirt and well who do you think you are that you can come in here you're no match for this devil David said absolutely I am I'm anointed I'm a bride member I'm just going to March and go forward I'm not going to look right nor left I'm going to take them I'm taking my Mountain he's he's going to die today Hallelujah David's mind it moved away from all of that doubt and it went to the word you know his thought they would have went to those stories that he heard about Moses at the Red Sea and uh he remembered his mommy telling him about Joshua and the mighty walls and and of course he believed that Josh David was a believer in Hebrews 138 Hallelujah he didn't believe that it was a god of history but that God was alive still today Hallelujah God is here he'll deliver me it doesn't matter any alcohol Spirit any demon of depression any demon of cancer any demon of drugs any demon of immorality lust music any demon it's going to fall Hallelujah I'm going to cut its head off and it's happening today that was David's attitude do we got some Davids in here hallelujah amen in John 14:14 it says if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it so Goliath just like the devil made his boast but at the last time the wrong time his voice fell on the ears of a Believer amen hallelujah on David and David remembered God's promises he knew God had promised I will be with you that was good for David amen amen amen and God's got one for you too the Bible says in John 14:8 it says I will not leave you comfortless Hallelujah this is my property I will come to you Hallelujah yet a little while and the world seeth me no more we're living in that time but ye see me because I live ye shall live also at that that day ye shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you oh what a place to be in Jesus Hallelujah he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him you want to you know fridge scripture John 14 : 18 to 12 you ought to write it down and put that one on your refrigerator and just a little further down the Bible says peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid that's the atmosphere that David was walking into all of this fear and uh what are we going to do where we live you guys are living too in a in a trade War we're we're really having a war and it's a taxation it's going to make things expensive how are we going to pay for everything but we don't need to fear we don't need to worry well the world is all in distress and they're following after all of these different conspiracies and who knows this and that and whatever else but we don't need to do that we don't need to figure any of that out I am in my beloved my beloved has everything in control I don't have to worry Hallelujah yeah he's given me peace if ye abide in me and my words abide in ye you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you Hallelujah those of you looking at the question of Salvation say it's mine Hallelujah Mark 16:16 the Bible says he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved uh but he that believeth not shall be damned okay so you just got to be a believer okay and now what happens when you become a Believer these signs shall follow them that believe Lorden in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover Hallelujah David was just a nobody he was a forgotten Hallelujah Joseph was really a nobody he became a forgotten but he rose up to be The Prince of Egypt shamgar was a nobody Daniel he really was a nobody he was just in with those however many come out of Israel at the time under Babylon and you you might be a nobody but that's just the kind of bodies God looking to look for amen Christ was in them and Christ is in you Hallelujah the hope of glory veiled in your flesh Hallelujah that makes a God man amen in perfect strength brother brandom says I hope that gets down deep to us both here and the tape world too that you realize that you got to become a nothing not a know-it-all not a great somebody but a nobody you got to come to dust that's really low but that's where we got to be Hallelujah you've got to get to a place that you know that you're nothing and don't never rise above it for as soon as you rise above it you rise above God you've got to keep yourself in the dust and on the road to Damascus you've got to keep yourself off your high horse Hallelujah and that's for everywhere Hallelujah you know the definition of a nobody it means no and body Hallelujah no person no one just a a nobody just who I am I'm just a nothing right but what is that light that shining from within that people would come by and they would say there's something special about you brother Jonas that's him that's Jesus Christ and it's just him living through me and I love to hear that because that means that I'm reflecting now I'm starting to reflect that image of Christ I'm coming into the right channel because now they're not seeing me because I'm just a wretch I'm just a filthy something but when I they're seeing something good they're seeing Jesus hallelujah amen there's no clock in this church amen and I'm on Saskatchewan time so we haven't even started yet bless the Lord yeah you're not going to get the musicians to come on me are you you and bless the Lord I'm I'm probably almost done I hope this is okay are you encouraged amen I I felt led to come brother Sean's invited me and I'm not much of a Preacher I'm I'm just a I'm who I am but I'm content I'm just content to be Jonas because that's who I'm supposed to be I was predestined to be this and so why would I say to God that he made a mistake you made me this way I'm fearfully and wonderfully made I need to do what he's called me to do amen and I felt to come just to say Jesus loves you he cares about you fight the fight of Faith don't let down your sword you're more than able Jesus has made you an overcomer hallelujah amen in the message Oneness brother brandham says oh God how I could think when the church was on the move when Moses got a little scared down there at the sea he be to cry to the Lord and the Lord said why are you crying to me what for are you crying to me speak and go forward have not I commissioned you to the job amen speak speak what the word of God Amen we're the same we don't need to cry just speak the word amen and just March don't get nervous say God's told me this is what his Bible says I'm content to do what his Bible says amen don't cut anybody out and don't pull anybody in that's up to God we just March amen we live a clean life we let God do the increase that's the lord it's in you speak and go forward don't cry unto me go forward and Lord God today I come in the name of the Lord Jesus I come yielding this sword of Faith claiming the Oneness of God in Man by the Holy Ghost through the mercies and sacrifice of Jesus Jesus Christ his son I defy every devil that's bound anybody in any way in this building whether he be boy or girl man or woman I defy every sickness I defy every doubt I defy every fear I defy everything that's ungodly leave this Auditorium in the name of Jesus Christ and come out of this audience that we can be one with God and can serve god without sickness or fear May the power that made us one with God how can that devil squawk himself around the anointed how can that devil stand out there and squawk himself like a Goliath when David come into the camp he said you mean you let that uncircumcised Philistine stand there and defy the armies of the Living God brother brandom saying oh God make men and women rise in the power of the spirit let that unconverted that dejected devil that's harmed the human race down Through the Ages stand here and defy the Church of the Living God Satan come out and leave in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah do you believe that I believe we're in the position of taking a Rapture I believe that we're just getting ourselves ready for the catching away and I really believe that God he's prolonged it because there's been some of us that have been slow he's been waiting on us just to get us into the right position position so that way we can take our body change you remember that testimony of that little lady that fell into the river and died and brother Brandon went prayed for her and she resurrected and then just a few months later she passed on what was go brother brandom question God remember that and and what did he say God came and told him she was supposed to go then but she wasn't right with me yet so I just needed to give her a little more time says that way she would be where I wanted to be Hallelujah isn't God so good you know he will not lose one every single bride member will come in they might be some of your children there might be some of them that are struggling it might be a an uncle it could be I don't know who they are I don't hardly know any of you but God knows exactly every single need and he's not finished yet he has a great plan that he is going to be projecting it's just getting right into that place where God is saying it's getting close and we're going to take that Rapture hallelujah amen then we don't have to worry about Democratic and Republican and we don't have to worry about the person down the road and what they said the other day we can just let it all go I I think we probably should just let it go now Hallelujah and just say let God have his way you know offenses are such a terrible thing because they bind people when they ought not to be bound and you know the best way there's not a one of us that has not been offended so you're not alone maybe you feel like it was worse for you but it wasn't no it was hard for everybody and you know as long as you stay in that offended State you're paralyzed your sword has been put down so I say become unoffended release it just forgive them my my daddy he preached a sermon on Let It Go Do you know how much power there is in letting something go did you know if you never owned a skid steer you'd never have to change oil in it yeah it's that simple yeah that's them tractors with the bucket on the front you know if you never owned a truck you never had to fuel it up and if you don't get an fence you don't have to fuel that fire you can just let it die right out and continue on in the freeness peace you'll love everybody it makes me love everybody Hallelujah that oldtime religion you ought not to have any sticky nature what did Brother brandham say that's a lack of rain it happens to Cactus just let that Holy Spirit rain down and where's that going to happen in your prayer life on if you feel like you're getting cold or maybe you're just I don't want to be this way pray true pray and what did Brother brandom say you get down on your knees and that person that was you know contempt you'll get in their shoes and you'll say oh Lord I never knew it was like that for them brother brandham said no man in that presence could ever didn't use the word criticize but could never criticize another Hallelujah that's where I want to be is in his presence amen amen amen well aren't you grateful for his Mercy amen bless the Lord I told God to just move me wherever and uh that's what we want him to do amen why don't the musicians come and do we know that song in his presence Let's uh sing that song if we could and as they're preparing themselves and playing that softly if you would just close your eyes and why don't you why don't you pray and as that presence would come and sway by you just as David played on the harp you know that story had ended David killed his Goliath he didn't have any struggle with it at all and I believe whatever trouble is in your life whatever problem is besetting you I believe that that could be the same as Goliath right right now if you'll just reach out to God in faith and if you'll say Lord Jesus I'm depending on you I've fought as hard as I could I've done all I humanly know how to do but Jesus I know I'm not enough but I'm looking to you the one who holds tomorrow and I know that they're the best hands that I could ever place this trouble in I've been sick I've been very sick and nearly lost my life due to a a situation and but God healed [Music] me cuz he wasn't done with me yet so I stand here today knowing god as a Healer you know I ran from God when I was a boy but my mommy and my daddy they prayed and I know God as a savior Mercy came running after me I've been depressed before but God came and he took that away and he gave me peace and joy in the trial he's the same God he's not dead he hasn't lost power the devil isn't too much it seems like it sometimes that flood is rising but God raised up a standard that would be greater than anything the devil ever could give and that standard is living in your heart it's a standard of Hope to the Hopeless rest for the weary you have something that the world knows nothing about I say we ought to praise him we ought to give him our whole heart and say Lord Jesus I'm sorry for holding back I'm sorry for the times that I've been critical I'm sorry for those thoughts I'm stuck in this flesh Tabernacle but thank you for the blood blood that brought me forgiveness and Lord I want to drill down on the devil I'm going to arise and be doing I'm going to work for the kingdom whatever you have need of Lord just ask me and Lord I will do all that I can I I maybe feel inadequate Lord I
