that um uh to be acquainted with you and and fellowship with you as Sons and Daughters of God amen and um the musicians can be dismissed got several out this morning and uh but um uh we want to just keep all them in prayer as they would make their way back um traveling and um uh the Lord will keep them safe on the highway and um it's h good to uh I believe uh have uh uh sister Connie will wine amen good good to have you this morning amen and uh just uh it's a beautiful day today and uh the Lord has just sure blessed us and I uh checking the weather you know on my phone and and um it looks like we're going to have good weather uh during our meeting fingers crossed right so we've been praying for that and and believing it our uh it has been really windy uh as yall know and so our tent has been put through the test it's tried and tested and and it's standing so this is good wonderful and uh we appreciate uh uh brother Tim uh you know he he helped us get it all together and he's been going out there every day uh making sure that it's there and uh we have one pole U we got you know it's it's pressure really tight and I think it sunk uh sunk a foot or so down in the dirt and um on one corner so actually I I kind of felt tall uh because the top of the tent is here to me and uh I like wow this is really neat so we're going to have to fix that but uh uh uh but anyway the Lord's been good to us and if you have your Bibles uh we're going to turn to the book of Hebrews the 13th chapter and um I have uh decided to dismiss the evening service uh uh today and um my reason is I'd like to uh take some um time this evening to pass out flyers around town and maybe uh put them in stores or uh talk to people or uh there and and just invite them to come and so anyone that would like to uh join me to do that um we're going to meet here around 5: here at the church and then um we can Branch out from there and um um it'll just be casual dressed and and so um yeah so we don't want people think we're Mormons or anything but um so we we'll just um however you want to address if you'd like to come uh but also a uh prayer request uh uh 13 year old girl is in uh real need of our prayer and I don't know if they can put her up on the screen right there she's uh she's from Alaska and they've U had to LifeLight her to Seattle Washington and um her one of her kidneys have quit working and the other one is having a hard time functioning and so she is in real need of our prayer so I thought I'd put her picture up there so kind of give you an idea of of who to pray for and um I know they would really appreciate that amen and uh that her name is Emily as well but also a prayer request that I had uh was um I had forgot to give Daniel and that's um um you remember the young uh boy that was killed uh by truck um he was on a skateboard out in front of his house I from what I've gathered and and and run out in the street and A truck hit him and killed him but uh his mom uh sister Unice and um um her daughter is really struggling and they they just need our prayer and I guess it happened about a month ago or maybe not even that long but they they they really need our prayer and then another prayer request that I had um uh forgot to give and that's a brother in the message and I I'm not going to tell where he's from but he is from another country war war torn country and um he has been abducted by the his government and uh is being forced to serve in the front lines um he is a he he doesn't look just real young um I don't know how old he is but um uh but he he was the he's the song leader in their church and uh just a real uh pillar uh in in the church there a message church and uh so they have um uh you know of course asking for prayer for him and and uh his family and of course the church and uh we just want to keep them in our prayer and so before we go into the word may we just bow our hearts and our heads kids to our Lord and maybe pray for these needs father Lord You're our comforter you are the only only one we can depend on you're faithful to your word father there's so many needs around the world so much suffering this girl this child father that is suffering Lord and her body not functioning right I pray Lord that you would touch her kidneys father raise her up out of that bed father oh God I pray Lord that your healing power would go to that hospital father cuse a restoration Lord and I you've done that Lord for even my son when his kidneys and liver everything started failing he was dying Lord in the hospital God you you restored him and father I I know you can do it Lord I pray that you would just touch our sister and her daughter that have lost her loved on Father Comfort them Lord in this time and may they look to you may they Lord rely upon you for you promise to be a comfort in these times and I know by personal experience that you are Lord and I just pray for them pray for this brother Lord that is father that is being forced to fight on the front lines and pray that you would protect him father just be with that family and their church and the Believers in that in that country pray that you would just protect them Lord father you know all things Lord and no matter what the devil determines on our lives you have the final say oh God we thankful Lord that we can rely upon you and I pray that you would just help us today as we would Endeavor to minister your word and uh Help the People father I just pray that your anointing would come aresh now Lord and help me just to get myself out of the way Lord in any spirit that would try to hinder the service Lord Lord I I pray that you would come and drive that thing away Lord May our faith be risen into Heavenly Heavenly atmospheres today we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen thank you Lord if you had turned to the book of Hebrews the 13th chapter and the the 14th verse but it says for here have we no continuing City but we seek one to come amen you can have your seats this morning and I I want to continue along the lines of we look for an eternal city of Peace for that's what this city is it's a city of Peace um Revelations the 21st chapter the 2 verse it says and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem and uh uh of course Jerusalem was first called Salem and Salem that word means city of peace and and so this is the um uh the city that we are looking for and it's not just just a uh City but it's the city of peace and it's an eternal City and as John said it's a holy city amen a holy city for it would have to be holy in order for it to continue and and so we remember that Abraham he met the king of this city there in Hebrews 7 and2 Paul talks about it says Abraham gave a tenth part of all first being in by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of Salem which is king of peace and he without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life so then we know that there's only one uh that would be that and that's God Amen uh uh Abraham met God in human flesh amen and and and and then in Hebrews 11 and9 Paul would tell us that Abraham looked for a city he he met the king of the city and he knew he knew that that there had to be a city and he began to look for a city which had Foundation whose Builder and maker is is God and and according to 1 Corinthians 14 and and 33 uh uh it would say that God is the author of Peace amen a city of Peace the king of peace and he's the author of of Peace So as I stated last Sunday that the word peace it it means rest quietness uh no fear uh Tranquility uh safety free from Rage and free from Havoc of war no war no it's no no no fear uh it's a place of safety and and so then peace means that the enemy has been conquered it it it means that you're in agreement and in Fellowship uh you have been delivered from the enemy and are now dwelling in safety amen so then this city of Peace would mean that the enemy ain't there uh that it is a place of safety it's a refuge it's there there's there's no fear there's no torment there's because that's what the the the the word demon means it means Tormentor and but but this is a city of Peace but that no no more wars and rumors of wars and and uh no more panic attacks and and worrying and all of that it's it's it's a place of of Peace amen and in Jeremiah 29 and11 God says I know the thoughts that I think toward you uh sayith the Lord thoughts of Peace amen and not of evil uh to give you an expected end ain't that right so so the thoughts that God has uh uh toward us is thoughts of peace I'm so glad for that amen and to give us an expected end so what is our end well according to Psalms 37:37 we read it last Sunday but the end is peace peace for it says Mark the perfect man and behold the upright for the end of that man is what peace it's not wrath it's not torment it's not destruction it's it's peace amen and so this is the the thoughts that God has uh uh toward us thoughts of peace and to bring us to an expected end and that's the end of Peace ain't that right amen I like what Paul said in in 2 Timothy 4 and18 he says the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work amen if we're going to a an eternal city of peace and the end of uh uh our end is peace then then we're looking at this and the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his Heavenly Kingdom to whom whom be glory forever and ever aren't you glad that there is a delivering power amen that delivers us yes sir and so whatever work that God does in a man's life the end of it is peace and always remember that that if God's hand is upon you no matter what he allows in your life uh um the end of that will be peace for that's what God thinks of you and his thoughts toward you is of Peace after Jesus healed the woman who had the issue of blood he said to her he said thy faith have made thee whole go in peace Amen in other words the the Tormentor that had tormented you is no longer there now go in peace ain't that right amen he said to the prostitute who had washed uh his feet and and uh and there she was uh uh uh kneeling before him and he says thy sins which are many uh are now forgiven thee go thy way in peace amen amen so here's a woman that was afflicted in her body and and now the devil had been driven from her and was told to go in peace and and here's a woman who had many many sins and a wretched prostitute and and yet God had forgiven her sins and she was told go in peace amen see that's the thing is it's our way is peace when God does something for us it's it's it's to bring peace to us amen he's the God of Peace and when he came to live with man he came uh uh to guide our feet into the way of Peace according to Luke 179 amen you see his work of redemption brought peace to us amen Colossians 1:20 and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself Ephesians 2:15 having abolished in his flesh the enmity amen even the law of Commandments contained in ordinance for to make in himself of Twain one new man so making peace amen that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby and came and preached peace Amen to you which were a far off and to them that were nine amen another place in the Bible it says that God has called us to peace amen peace ought to be something that is very dominant in our life it should be pred dominating amen over us amen is peace no matter the storms and no matter the trials and no matter uh whatever we have every promise has been given to us Amen to let us know that we are still secure amen if the winds are blowing you're still secure amen if you're going through the fiery furnace you're still secure amen whatever you're going through you're still secure for the God of Peace amen amen uh uh has you in his hands amen Psalms 55 and8 Heath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me for there were many with me or against me and so we find that this king of peace is also called the king of saints amen not only is he the God of Peace and the king of Peace but he is is the king of saints and and and you'll find that there in Revelations 15 and and three so what that means is that we are under his domain now amen and and he has to say so amen as Colossians 1 uh uh the first chapter I believe 123 maybe of of where uh it it talks about that Christ amen has died for us that he might have the re emance in us and over the church amen because he is now the king now now that is a privilege to us that that if you're the king of the country amen or or you're under a country then you're under the laws of that country you're under the protection of that country ain't that right well we are under the domain uh uh uh or the domain of the king amen a peace amen and we do that but and we become that by the Paul would tell us by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body ain't that right and therefore the prophet would tell us we are now we are now citizens of the kingdom of God Amen so that's what the Church of the Living God is we're citizens aren't you glad for that you're citizens yes you may be in in a where we're in a Strange Land but we're citizens amen and God's domain can reach all the way from eternity down into time amen and and control every situation of our lives and he is the God of Peace ain't that right so so in the Old Testament the known church was called the kingdom of God which is God's kingdom amen and in in other words uh uh uh God is a king he's the king of righteousness he's the king of peace and the church is uh uh is his domain if you ever want to see God in his power and his authority and his mighty acts watch him move in the church amen because that's his domain ain't that right amen yes sir and so that means that the devil has no say over us amen God has the final say ain't that right yes sir see and so in the New Testament the church is called the Messiah uh Messianic U uh empow Empire uh that's what the church is and other words the messiah's Empire where the Messiah rules and Reigns so that's what the church is today the Church of the Living God is Messiah Empire amen where Messiah rules and Reigns I am so glad for that Amen brother brandom said there's no denominational bearers or nothing see in the church for messiah rules in his Empire amen see so we may be uh in the world but we're not of the world now notice uh uh I'm just going to read some quotes uh we as Christians as Christians as the church are only reflecting him amen see and who is he the king of Peace amen his domain is a peace his rule is a peace ain't that right amen so what you are here is a reflection of what you are somewhere else amen if your domain amen if you're under the control of Satan well then you're going to reflect that amen if if and and there's only two places that people are going it's heaven or hell ain't that right that and that's just facts it's just Heaven and Hell you'll never be just obliviated and and be nothing after you die you're going to one place or the other amen and if you're going to heaven you're going to reflect that where here not when you get over there you're going to reflect where you're going here and if you're going to hell you'll reflect that here Amen in this life see so what you are here is a reflection of the place you're going somewhere else see he said I do not believe that Christians uh consist of joining churches or Creeds I believe Christianity is a reflection of Jesus Christ in a human being another place Pentecost is an experience it's a reflection of Christ where he uh started on the day of Pentecost to reflecting himself through the people that's what Pentecost is it's not a an organization Pentecost is an experience where the king of peace is now reflecting himself in his subjects the people ain't that right in another place if you are reflecting by your mortal life the light of heaven then you're reflecting the eternal life God then when you die you can no more than go to that light because that's what you've reflected here on the earth ain't that right so then then then look at the reflection that we are to reflect Amen on this this Earth 1 Peter 3 and10 for he that will love life see and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no G let him isue evil shun evil and do good let him seek what peace and ensue it it pursue it always seek for peace ain't that right James 3:17 the wisdom that is from above is first pure then Peaceable gentle and easy to be intreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace Hebrews 12:4 follow peace with all men now that doesn't mean compromise on your beliefs amen but but but avoid Strife avoid things that that would bring contention why because we are of a domain of Peace the king of Peace we are subjects of his ain't that right and we are reflecting another world we are reflecting another land we are truly reflecting the city that we're looking for so follow peace with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord amen Romans 14:19 let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace and I I I have to tell you there's only one thing that really brings peace and that's God Amen and and and the things of God the Eternal things amen only make for peace can you sayen guns don't make for peace amen you can have a whole closet full you can have every room your line walls lined with guns but that ain't going to bring peace you can have a a whole arsenal of bombs and and in the war chest and of of national uh security that ain't going to bring peace amen but there's one thing that will bring peace and that's the God of Peace follow after those things which make for peace can you say amen amen see so therefore make which make for peace and things wherewith one may edify another if we are under the domain of the king of peace and we are citizens of the city of Peace then we are to reflect peace amen ain't that right now brother Brandon made the following statement while praying he said May Our Lives be so submitted to thee and the Holy Spirit will or that the holy spirit will live itself through us and speak through US Lord may we remember in our minds as we walk up the street and rub arms with the world amen that we're not supposed to be like those man may we step aside and give them the place Lord and their rightful position here on Earth we'll take the back seat knowing that we are delicates from another world we have a kingdom that's coming into Power all of this world there's no F there's no sense in fussing over it am me King Nation fighting against Nation there's no reason to fight we've got another kingdom we're from above can you say Amen all these materialistic things doesn't matter anymore amen not to a true child of God that's been born again that's really looking for another city amen what is it that we gain the whole world and then die the second we gained it what does it do us can you say amen amen see so we'll take the back seat knowing that we are delegates From Another World we have a kingdom that's coming into Power Lord and our great king will soon arrive and take over all the kingdoms that's in his domain and he shall Rule and reign with him here on Earth thousand years and be with him forever aren't you looking forward to that time oh my that's why we can be humble that's why we can give things up we don't have to be first place and we don't have to have the best and we don't have to have that because we know we've got a city that's that we're going to we know that that the king is we've seen that King we're in the presence of that King amen and it speaks in our heart that there is a city amen and in that City we'll rule we'll reain it'll be ours the meek shall inherit the earth can you say amen amen see so we're looking uh for this city in one place instead of using the word looking Paul would use the word groaning we're groaning and and and and Romans 8:23 we ourselves grown everybody say groan we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to Wi the Redemption of our body oh if you only knew exactly the time that we're living in in the day this is the time of adoption amen and there's nothing left but the the Redemption of our body amen and and brother Brandon would say of this scripture he says see we understand this will take place at the first resurrection nature is groaning we are groaning everything is groaning because we realize something's not right there is no Republican that can make it right there's no Democrat that can make it right there's no M Earthly Messiah as far as what the world is looking for that can make it right there's no bomb there's no King there's nothing that can make it right right amen not in the way we're looking for it to be we realize that there's something not right and the only way you can grown and wait for it is because there has been New Life coming here that speaks of a new world Amen when the Holy Ghost comes in a man a woman boy girl there's something that begins to pul say within them I'm not here I don't belong here there's it causes us to to confess like a like the Old Testament Saints and those Saints before us that we're pilgrims and strangers in this land but we're seeking a city to come we're looking for it and we're groaning for it can you say say amen amen so then we find that the scriptures tell us that there is an eternal Kingdom and that Jesus Christ is the king in Luke 1:33 when the angel of the Lord appeared to Mary he makes the following statement concerning the Christ child and says and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end it doesn't talk about Putin it doesn't talk about amen the United States it doesn't talk about Trump Biden doesn't he's not a Republican Democrat he's not of this Earthly Kingdom and all that but yet this child amen this Jesus Christ his kingdom there shall never be an End Amen now the the Jews thought that Jesus was to had come to set up his kingdom amen and and to reain so their their thinking was carnal amen because they thought that he was going to have a natural Kingdom a natural Throne a natural government a natural uh dominion and and so they expected him their idea of Messiah coming was that they expected him to overthrow the Romans and and to defeat them amen and bring peace to the Jews you know and and to the world and and things like that and and and yet but Jesus would tell them now he told pilate actually uh there in John 18 35 he said my kingdom is not of this world right amen so I'm not going to set up my kingdom the way governments set Their Kingdoms up and and I'm not going to you know I'm I'm not establishing my kingdom on that he said if my kingdom were of this world then my servants would fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence amen his kingdom is not from this world it's not made up of this Earthly things ain't that right but see the Jews were blinded amen and they were blinded for our sake and therefore they could not recognize their day and hour amen and and they didn't understand the prophecy ain't that right amen see now I truly believe uh that the world is in the same condition right now that they don't understand the prophecy that is is is being fulfilled amen uh things that are happening to Israel right now is not by chance amen it's it's according to prophecy everything that is happening all the corruption and all the things that are going on in the politics and the the the the filth and and and the uh I mean it's just it's bad but it's all prophecy and yet people do not recognize their day and age and and and uh but I pray that that we do right amen see and so Jes Jesus had told the people of this this Le oysan age that they were blind amen and then Paul would say they are without understanding so living in this age seeing all the events that take place and yet without understanding because they are blind you see Jesus could not set up his kingdom a man in the days of his first coming he he couldn't uh uh because because it wasn't the right timing you see I I want to say this that you cannot force things to happen hello you cannot force things you cannot force world events to happen you cannot force Church events to happen you cannot force your personal things that are happening in your life you cannot make them happen you cannot force them to happen they will happen in God's timing there has been scriptures that have been laying here in this Bible just laying dormant waiting for the right timing it doesn't mean that God was slack it does not mean that well the Bible says that God is Not slack concerning his promise it it doesn't mean that God forgot about them but there is a timing for everything do you realize there's a time for your trial and there's a time for your Victory there there is a time for things to happen in your life we would call them seasons in our lives but they have to happen but they are a time and so the Jews without understanding they were trying to make prophecy come to pass without understanding the scriptures ain't that right you see God does things in his own timing he can give prophecy as he has thousands of years before they happen and yet they lay dormant waiting for the right timing God doesn't do things automatic he just does it he says it and we know and we trust him that it's all going to work out ain't that right so we we find they didn't recognize their day of visitation therefore they crucified him amen see and so if if a man doesn't recognize what God is doing do you realize the prophet said if he doesn't recognize it he'll actually turn against the very God he claims to serve if if he don't recognize God moving in his life now church God just doesn't stay with you just just when things are going good that's right he's with he says I'm Lo I'm with you always ain't that right but he that so so if you if you don't understand what God is doing you allow your heart to get bitter you allow your heart to get hardened amen but God has called us to a a a a peace that's right brother amenl peace can you say Amen we we find that second Peter 3 And1 The Second Epistle beloved I now write unto you in both which I steer up your pure Mind by way of remembrance that you may be mindful of The Words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the Commandment of us the Apostles of the Lord our and savior knowing this first that there shall come in the last day scoffers walking after their our own their own lust and saying where is the promise of his coming ain't that right so this proves that they are without understanding that they are blind and they they don't know what's happening they're actually can see the prophecies all starting to fulfill prophecies that's been laying dormant from genis all the way to Revelations and now they are being fulfilled and they ask the question where's the promise where is he at it it just mindboggling but that's that's what happens when you're without understanding of scripture so we find that according to the Book of Daniel the reason why that Christ could not set his kingdom up at that time was because other prophecy had yet to be fulfilled now we had talked uh about this uh last Sunday and I'm going to continue with that but in Daniel 2:31 there there was this is a prophecy Nebuchadnezzar had a dream and he didn't understand the dream actually I think he even just forgot about the dream and and so he needed someone to not only interpret the dream but he needed someone to tell him the dream that he had and and he was troubled well then Here Comes Daniel Daniel was brought before him and Daniel Prayed and and and these things and God gave him amen not only the interpretation but showed him what the dream was and he said thou oh King sawest and behold a great image this great image whose brightness was excellent stood before thee and the form thereof was terrible this image's head was a fine gold now now we talked about it so we're going to move on but this this gold uh uh and Daniel says it uh this was Nebuchadnezzar uh his Babylonian Kingdom and then it says his breast and his arms of silver which was the kingdom of the mes and Persians his belly and his thighs was of brass uh which was the kingdom of Greece under Alexander the Great and his legs of iron which is the Roman Empire now we we find that when Jesus come first time who was in control it was the Roman Empire ain't that right see and so but yet it had not come to the the the the Fulfillment of Prophecy it had not come all the way uh as as we know now the two legs uh uh of iron it shows that the Roman Empire was to be made of two divisions main divisions so this is a prophecy this isn't just a dream it's it's it's God prophesying of the Gentile kingdoms uh and and of what was to come and so this is exactly what happened uh the Roman Empire literally split in two the East and the west and and and both were very powerful crushing all before them but then it went from the legs into the toes and and the feet and the toes and in the feet and the toes it was mixed with clay and and iron ain't that right a mixture see Daniel says his feet was part of iron and part of clay amen see so then we look at it the the former kingdoms uh Nebuchadnezzar the MS of the Persians and and um um uh Greece they they were pure minerals uh gold brass uh uh silver and and so uh uh uh the prophet would tell us and and we would know it but mineral and soil does not mix nor does it produce consistency or constancy and strength ain't that right so then the prophecy shows us that the Roman P Empire which is the last everybody say it's the last it's the last World Empire would endure because that was the iron right the iron in the legs and then the iron went into the feet and into the toes but when it got into the feet and Toes it was mixed with Clay right and so brother Brandon says that shows us that this last World Empire the Roman Empire cuz that was the last that went all the way to the toes amen would endure in its peculiar mix state right up until Jesus returns and is that right so again what Nebuchadnezzar and I'm going to just try to take some time because uh uh some most of you know what I'm talking about some have never maybe have heard it or uh need to be reminded or whatever but but what Nebuchadnezzar saw was all the Gentile kingdoms uh uh there starting in Babylon and and and and ending up in in the Roman Empire and and so but notice notice at the end of uh at at at when when when the the whole image was seen Then There came something else and it says Daniel says in the 34th verse thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands which smoke the image upon his feet that were of iron and Clay ain't that right see so and and break them to Pieces so if Jesus was to set up his kingdom at that time well then it hadn't come to the full effect of of the feet where where uh uh it the iron was mixed with Clay ain't that right see and we'll get into that more but says then was the iron notice then was the iron the clay the brass the silver the gold broke Bren to pieces together and became like the shaft of the summer threshing floors and the wind carried them away and that there was no place found for them and the stone that smoked that image became a great mountain and filled the Earth can you say amen that's right see and so then we find that Daniel gives the interpretation of the dream and he tells in the 37th verse he tells the king thou art this head of gold and he says in the 39th verse says after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee which is the mes and Persians and another third Kingdom of brass shall bear rule over all the Earth see a world Empire which was Greece under the Alexander the Great and the fourth Kingdom shall be as strong as iron for as much as iron breth in pieces notice how that is it breth in pieces and subdueth all things and as iron that [Music] prophecy they could have accepted the Messiah in the way he came see now iron is the hardest of these four metals metals and and iron signifies power and great destructive force against opposition ain't that right now so we we look at it uh the 41st verse it says and where as thou sawest the feet and Toes part of Potter's clay and part of iron the kingdom shall be divided but there shall be in it uh uh of the strength of the iron for as much as thou sawest the iron mixed with my Reay and as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken now that's a significance because it's it's telling us of the day that we're living in that's right see so and whereas thou saw iron mixed with my Reay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with Clay ain't that right and in the days of these Kings shall the god of Heaven set up a kingdom see which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever that's the kingdom that we're looking for that's the city that we're looking for ain't that right but it could not come until the prophecy was totally fulfilled of these four Gentile kingdoms ain't that right so for as much as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it break in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver and the gold the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass Hereafter and the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof ain't that right so then we know by this dream and interpretation that when when it gets down we're not in the the the we're not in the age of the head of this image we're not in the age of in of of of the body or even the legs but when it gets down to to the T toes the the feet uh iron mixed with Clay the T toes then we know then we know that the end is nine then we know that God will turn from the Gentiles to the Jew the the Jews ain't that right then we know that time shall be no more hello that's right see why because the comes and hits the tolls the Gentile kingdoms are no more ain't that right when that Stone comes there the iron ain't going to be able to withstand that power of that that stone there's no Kingdom Gentile Kingdom I don't care how great of a superpower they are they cannot withstand the power of the stone yes sir it's then that God sets up his eternal Kingdom now this Kingdom that God is going to set up is not part of the the image that Nebuchadnezzar uh saw in his dream he only saw the four Gentile kingdoms which made up that image ain't that right and again the iron was the last of uh uh of the that image and it went all the way to the end of the uh uh Gentile kingdoms so then this city that we're looking for this this city of Peace has nothing to do with what we have here in this Mortal life man can rise up as we're seeing it in in in their election speeches better world better peace I'll provide it but there's only one Kingdom of peace and no man can set it up it takes the power of the stone to come you realize every Kingdom of this Earth is part of this Gentile as you'll see it's it it has to do with at all see so you remember that this city only exists in the new Earth and it's a new Earth because it has been re renovated and cleansed by a holy fire hello this Earth that this city is on is a redeemed Earth yeah no sickness no disease no germs no Temptations Hallelujah no adulteries committed no evil thoughts no murder it's a redeemed Earth yes it is aren't you glad for that no mind battles praise the Lord for no enemy to to try to rock our boat amen ain't going to be there thank God it's a new Earth and this city of Peace abides on that Earth amen it it takes a renovation for it to happen it takes God to wipe all of this Gentile kingdoms out every nation will be obliviated everything will be gone amen cuz he's going to set up his city of Peace hallu he's the God of Peace and and and you ought to go back and listen to that future home yes of the Earthly bride and the Heavenly bridegroom brother Bram goes through it of how that and he explains what how that God redeemed you and brought peace into you and cleansed you and and and took Satan out of you to where he couldn't couldn't have dominion over you anymore he does the same thing to this earth he goes through the same process can you say amen that's right see and the prophet said it's the city the city is prepared and designed by the Divine architect amen oh aren't you glad for that hallu another place he says he has designed it with tender hands for his beloved bride another place it's a prepared City for a prepared people amen that's what God's doing for you right now he's preparing you he's getting all the doubt out of us getting all the things that are not like him out of us amen amen true brother and if you notice Revelations 22 and 2 in the midst of the street of it and on either side of the river was there the Tree of Life which bear 12 manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the Nations think of that now where is this at on the new Earth right that City amen it was healing for the Nations brother BR said see this is when the kings are living in peace here it's Nation against Nation right on now look look this thing's about to the the kake's about to explode he right Iran's already attacking Israel and and and I mean it's just it's we're getting going into World War II this thing's about to blow ain't that right but in this place in this place it's saying that the kings are actually living in peace there's a healing that takes place he says when they go out they'll pick a leaf a leaf off like that see like the dove come back see that the wrath of God it testified that the wrath of God had been settled and brought the holy leaf holly leaf into the ark so when the king see these leaves by bringing his glory into the bride's chamber here into the city see he'll hold a leaf to his neighbor King and that's a sign we're in peace forever more amen amen see it's healing everybody say healing heal of the Nations it's all settled ain't that right see one time we fought for one another's blood see and we cherished and hollered and shot and burnt children everything but now there is peace see that it's the healing of the Nations not disease healing not healing of our body that's all done with we've already been changed changed but this is healing of the Nations can you say Amen then you go in the third verse and there shall be no more curse Hallelujah talking about a peace God a city of peace there's no more curse the curse is lifted off this Earth the curse is lifted off the peopleall but the Throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it and his servants Shall Serve him can you say amen amen see so this is why we don't get wrapped up in the politics we don't get wrapped up in the things of this life Christians Listen to me we don't get wrapped up in this stuff us Lord amen amen there's no promise of a man that you should put your hope into going to surprise you on these days the world is looking for a messiah and they're going to get one true but the Messiah that God has sent them they reject it is true ain't that right on so what we are living in now is Satan's Eden that's why you know every nation on the earth is under his control and is his domain that's why there's jealousy as we read you know I talked about last Sunday demons even get jealous of one another Spirits get jealous of one another what causes the fighting it's Satan not the goip peat amen Satan loves turmoil he loves friction yeah he loves to destroy what the Bible says he come to do is to kill still and Destroy he'll destroy your faith he'll destroy your happiness he'll destroy your doctrines he'll destroy truth he'll destroy it to you if you'll let him that's right amen now if we go back to Daniel 7 and I hope this all right this morning yes Sir Daniel 7 and one in the first year of belshazzar King of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters Daniel spake and said I saw in my vision by night and behold the Four Winds of the earth strove upon the great sea and four great beasts came up from the sea diverse one from another now we know that Beast represents power so four great Powers rose up and and these powers are National powers political Powers ain't that right so Satan is the head of all national all political Powers amen he sure is and it's the power of the devil right so we'll go on into it the fourth verse the first was like a lion and had Eagle's Wings I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked this is speaking of Nebuchadnezzar actually and it was lifted up from the earth and made hand upon the feet as a man and a man's heart was given to it and behold another Beast a second like to a bear see a power and it raised up itself on one side and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it and they said thus unto it arise devour much flesh that's speaking of the me and Persians after this I beheld and lo another like a leopard which had upon the back of it four wings of a foul the Beast had also for heads and Dominion was given to it speaking of the Greece uh Alexander the Great and so forth after this notice I saw in the night visions and behold a fourth Beast Dreadful and terrible and strong exceedingly and it had great iron teeth it devoured and break in pieces and stamped the residue with the feet of it and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it and it had 10 horns now we know that this that is the fourth power which brother brandom called Roman power and it's diverse from all the other powers for it was Dreadful terrible strong exceedingly and it had great iron teeth it devoured and break in pieces and stamped the residue with the feet of it ain't that right so then the last World power goes into the feet goes into the feet runs all the way into the toes to the end of the toes which means that that its power and influence is sp spread throughout the world right it has come to the T toes and it's spread out into the world the prophet say see that streak of ROM and iron Runs Out in every nation in the world today in every nation that streak of ru ISM goes out like in the 10 toes of Daniel's Vision right so after the Romans defeated Greece brother Bram says who's ruled the Gentile world ever since Romans that was the iron and then notice Rome everybody say Rome exists to the end because it went to the end of toes ain't that right so so I hope I'm not just repeating uh but but just to get it to us but we find that the the legs of the image was pure iron it was nothing but iron but then in the feet toes it was mixed in with with clay and therefore it was no longer a solid iron Empire uh uh because of the clay mixed into it and yet the prophet would tell us that it is still there this iron is still there even though it's mixed in clay it's running the Affairs of the world right now it's running the Affairs of the world in both democratic nations and the more despotic ones right this is prophecy sure amen see he could not set his kingdom up when they were just pure iron a Roman Empire on but here we are in the in the feet and Toes mixed there are of course uh in the feet uh he saw the 10 toes and and brother brandham brings this out in in in the 10 toes and but it's including two big toes you and I again uh uh I I thank God for a prophet to allow let us give give us Insight but one of the big toes was was eisenh and his name means iron the other big toll is crof and his name means clay in 1960 there were five eastern Nations and five Western Nations that were assembled at the UN in 1960 and these two main world leaders Eisenhower and kof uh they were there Koff he was he spoke for the five eastern Nations whereas Eisenhower spoke for the five Western Nations and of course you know the brother Braham talks about when this is when kof took off his shoe and and uh beat the desk with it right now brother Brandon says see now now this is significant for us because it's showing that we're not in the feet we're not in the legs we are in the the toes we're right here we're at the end and when kof done that what he did it showed that they're not going to mingle clay and iron ain't going to mingle they exist but they're not going to mingle so brother RM said see these two main leaders of the world these two big toes of the feet of iron and Clay were side by side yes now this is telling us just one of them but tells us exactly what time we're living in have you noticed I mean it was it was also at this time uh uh of in this age that Israel becomes a nation amen they're they're gathered from all around the world things are happening in the Middle East like never before look what's happening in America look what's happening in the churches that's right it couldn't happen until the end came hello now we're at the end no wonder the mighty angel of Revelations 10:1 has descended in this day declaring and what has he declared time shall be no more right amen right time shall be no more can you say amen I want to and I won't keep you much longer but I want to read Revelations 13 And1 and I stood upon the sand this is John speaking I I stood up the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea now again this is the fourth Beast that Daniel saw and it it's a power rising up amongst the people Prophet said and having seven heads and 10 horns and upon his horns 10 crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy and the Beast which I saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great Authority ain't that right so it's at the end of the Gentile domain that all these beasts that Daniel saw separated are now represented in one brother Ram said it's the same old Devils demons that possessed each kingdom of the Romans down through the Greeks and so forth all the way down through the den spacation has come right on down and all met up in one Beast ain't that right yeah and I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death what was this this exactly happened when Rome the in Roman Empire fail to The Barbarians and it looked as though Rome would no longer rule for she had lost her temporary power brother Bram says the nation that ruled by crushing all which became the strongest empire ever known was finally wounded to death her power was physically gone as to control by armies Etc and so as as the glory and power of of all empowers Empire s fail so this Empire this Roman Empire it it began to fall this uh uh Pagan Empire and it was no longer iron it it not that pure iron right it fell right but prophecy says it endured and kept going through so the iron was no longer pure and and if you notice the stone the stone that was not because the stone come rolling down the mountain for it had not rolled down the mountain it had not come hello so so so the end of pagan Rome uh uh it wasn't that because Daniel said that when the stone come and struck that image there would be no more there wouldn't be no more place for a gentile Kingdom it's over it's done time is finished ain't that right right and and and if the stone would have come then then the wound wouldn't have healed but here John saw that there was a wound he was wounded to death but then that wound was healed can you say Amen so the whis translation says that one of his head uh appeared to have been mortally wounded the throat having been slashed and his Deathstroke was healed and the whole world the whole earth f followed after the wild beast in amazement now the healing of this wound took place at NAA counil through Constantine ain't that right so Daniel's prophecy shows that this iron would continue to rule but it would not rule as Pagan Rome it would rule as paple Rome ain't that right I looked up the word paple it's relating to a pope or to the Roman Catholic Church so Nia Council swung the power of political Rome to the church brother BR says see people look at Rome they look at the nation of Italy and as they look they do not realize that Rome with her strict confines where the pope has an actual area as his domain is literally a nation within a nation she has ambassadors and she receives ambassadors he says see po Papa false Christian Rome she is even called the Eternal City how Blasphemous Now controls by religion even more ably than when Pagan Imperial Rome controlled by the pure iron of force Rome took on the a new lease of life when Constantine joined church and state and back the Union by force the spirit that motivated Pagan Rome is the same spirit that motivates now that now motivates the false Christian Rome oh my now you can see that is so because you now know that the fourth Empire never went out of existence it just changed in its outer texture can you amen amen and the very thing that caused the Roman Empire to succeed was divide and conquer divide and conquer and it's the same thing that has called Pap roome the church right to succeed through the ages divide and conquer divide and conquer ain't that right so brother Ram says see her iron teeth and and uh tore and devoured and whom she tore and deved could not rise again and that's why no denomination will ever rise again what Revival they had is no longer and never will come back into Revival it never it could not rise again as when she destroyed Carthage and sold her salt and the same iron seed remained in her when she arose as the false church and her policy has remained the same divide and conquer and you sayen and that power that she has is of Satan and he is the one who seeks to kill steal and destroy Revelations 13:7 and says and it was given unto him to make war with the Saints and to overcome them and he did so I don't know have you ever read the foxes book book of Martyrs yes amen has anyone read the fox's book of Martyrs if you haven't you ought to go get the book and read the fox's book of Martyrs yes sir it's uh it's it's U it's it's it's I would say a mustre of what happened to the Christians but it was given unto him to make war with the Saints and to overcome them he burned them at the stake he flayed them alive the fed them to the Lions he killed them in any way possible that he could true Augustine of Hippo made it a rule that the church ought to and must use Force if necessary to bring her children back into the fold and that is it was in harmony with the word of God to kill the Heretics and apostates think about that as I close now in his controvers uh controversy with um uh donus I guess he wrote this it is indeed better that men should be led to worship God by teaching than that they should be driven to it by fear of punishment or pain but it does not follow that because the former course produces the better men therefore those who do not yield to it should be neglected for many have found Advantage as we have proved and are daily proving by actual experience in being first compelled by fear or pain so that they might afterwards be influenced by teaching so that they might follow out in act what they have already learned in word whilst those are better who are guided a right by love those are certainly more numerous who are corrected by fear for who can possibly love us more than Christ who laid down his life for the Sheep yet after calling Peter and the other Apostles by his words alone when he came to summon Paul he not only constrained him with his voice but even dashed him to the Earth with his power what a perverse thing and that he might forcibly bring one who is Raging ad mid the darkness of in infidelity to desire the light of the heart he first struck him with physical blindness of the eyes why therefore should not the church use force in compelling her lost Sons to return the Lord himself said go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in wherefore if the power which the church has received by Divine appointment in its due season through the religious character and Faith Of Kings be the instrument by which those who are found in the highways and hedges that is in heresy and schemes are compelled to come in then let them not find fault with being compelled now brother Bram says of this man hippo uh a Augustine of Hippo that he had actually had an opportunity once to receive the Holy Ghost about under St Martin and yet he he refused to do that therefore he become too more child of Hell than he was to begin with and he moved down to hippo Africa and set his school there he was more interested in the dogmas of Rome till he couldn't receive the Holy Spirit and brother brandham said that's exactly what is happening today people are more interested in things of the world to where they can't even receive the Holy Ghost he says sometimes were so interested in time that we're brought right into the presence of the Lord Jesus and we turn and walk away but Augustine's if the musicians will come Augustine's verdict through the doors wide open for them to kill anything they wanted to then that denied the Pagan church and from that time of St Augustine about 300 years after Christ until 1850 the great Massacre of Ireland there was 68 million Protestants killed by the Catholic church that iron still rules yes and if you notice when Daniel looked in the 17th chapter or not Daniel but John in the 17th chapter of Revelations he saw a woman now he wasn't looking at a Beast he was looking at a woman and woman represents church and that deadly wound had been healed and you find in Revelations 13:7 and power was given him over all kindreds tongues and Nations brother Brian said it never did become that way in Rome until Pagan Rome was converted into Papa Rome and Catholic power spread the world and made the universal Catholic Church can you say Amen Revelation 17:6 John says and I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the Saints and with the blood of the martyrs of [Music] Jesus as we get into it you'll find there in the Book of Revelations that Not only was there four
