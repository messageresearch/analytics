[1:00:27] chapter and we're going to start at the
[1:00:29] first
[1:00:31] verse furthermore then we beseech you
[1:00:35] Brethren and exhort you by the Lord
[1:00:38] Jesus that as you have received of us
[1:00:41] how you ought to walk and to please God
[1:00:44] so ye would abound more and more for you
[1:00:48] know what Commandments we gave you by
[1:00:50] the Lord Jesus for this is the will of
[1:00:52] God even your sanctification that you
[1:00:54] should abstain from
[1:00:56] fornication and that every one of you
[1:00:58] should know how to possess his vessel in
[1:01:02] sanctification and
[1:01:04] honor then if you'll go to First John
[1:01:08] the uh 3DD chapter 1 John chapter
[1:01:12] 3 and
[1:01:15] um we're going to start at the 18th
[1:01:18] verse
[1:01:26] um 1 John 3
[1:01:28] and18 says my little children let us not
[1:01:32] love in word neither in tongue but in
[1:01:35] deed and in
[1:01:37] truth and hereby we know that we are of
[1:01:40] the truth and shall assure our hearts
[1:01:42] before them for if our heart condemneth
[1:01:45] God is greater than our heart and
[1:01:47] knoweth all things beloved if our heart
[1:01:50] condemneth condemn us not then we have
[1:01:54] confidence toward God
[1:01:56] and whatsoever we ask we receive of him
[1:02:00] because we keep his Commandments and do
[1:02:02] those things that are pleasing in his
[1:02:04] sight and this is his Commandment that
[1:02:07] we should believe on the name of the
[1:02:09] Lord
[1:02:10] Jesus uh name of his son Jesus Christ
[1:02:14] and love one another as he gave us
[1:02:19] commandment amen and he that keepeth his
[1:02:22] Commandments dwelleth in him and he in
[1:02:25] him
[1:02:27] hereby we know that he abideth in Us by
[1:02:30] the spirit which he hath given us amen
[1:02:34] you can have your seats and pray that
[1:02:37] the Lord just blesses the word
[1:02:39] today and if I would use the title I
[1:02:42] want to continue with the Thought Walk
[1:02:45] pleasing unto
[1:02:47] him and um you know how how many
[1:02:51] believes you're a Christian you believe
[1:02:53] you're a Christian amen well we we look
[1:02:57] at that word
[1:02:58] Christian and uh it means to be
[1:03:03] Christlike and um um and so when we
[1:03:08] think of that it's uh it's a really a
[1:03:11] sobering
[1:03:12] thought um and and uh we the scriptures
[1:03:17] you know that we've read as as I've said
[1:03:20] before you know they're talking to a
[1:03:23] group of people that have been
[1:03:27] um translated out of Darkness into uh
[1:03:31] His Marvelous Light they have been ta uh
[1:03:35] Divine been made partakers of the divine
[1:03:38] nature having escaped the corruption
[1:03:41] that is in the world through lust so so
[1:03:45] Paul and and and and and well the Bible
[1:03:47] is is speaking these scriptures are
[1:03:50] speaking to a a direct specific group of
[1:03:54] people and so the only way for a man to
[1:03:58] know well you know I'm a Christian that
[1:04:01] means Christlike and and so the only way
[1:04:04] for us to know that we are Christlike is
[1:04:07] to look into the word of God how many
[1:04:10] believes that and and we know that the
[1:04:13] word of God is more than just a book
[1:04:15] it's it's the mirror the word of God is
[1:04:18] is a mirror and and so we're we're not a
[1:04:23] people that are guessing what what it
[1:04:26] means to be Christlike um we're we're
[1:04:29] we're not a people that have no mirror
[1:04:33] uh or we're not even a people who have
[1:04:35] just a piece of mirror uh you know
[1:04:38] brother brand I'm talking of the of of
[1:04:41] when he was growing up in that one room
[1:04:43] law cabin and and he said you know that
[1:04:47] uh you go outside and and and hanging on
[1:04:50] a tree tacked to a tree was just a
[1:04:52] little piece of mirror you know and and
[1:04:55] you couldn't see your full reflection
[1:04:57] cuzz it was just a little piece and he
[1:04:59] was talking about that boy that was
[1:05:02] raised up no doubt in the same uh like
[1:05:05] he was you know that uh just had a
[1:05:09] little piece of mirror to look at or
[1:05:11] whatever and maybe you could just see
[1:05:12] the eyeball or maybe you could just see
[1:05:14] the nose or or whatever but he had went
[1:05:18] went to uh the city to his aunt's house
[1:05:21] or something to that effect and when he
[1:05:23] walked in there was a full mirror
[1:05:26] and he could not just look at his nose
[1:05:29] or whatever but he could see himself a
[1:05:32] full self right and and so when he was
[1:05:35] looking at it he you know he he realized
[1:05:39] that when he lifted his hand up the boy
[1:05:41] in the mirror lifted his hand up and and
[1:05:44] uh kept imitating what he would do and
[1:05:47] finally says that's me you know I'm that
[1:05:50] that's that's who I am you know and and
[1:05:52] so that that would tell us and I think
[1:05:55] brother brandom and telling us this
[1:05:57] story lets us know where we're standing
[1:05:59] at that we're not a people without a
[1:06:02] mirror we're not a people who have just
[1:06:04] a little piece of mirror but we actually
[1:06:07] by the opening of the word we were able
[1:06:09] to completely fully look at ourselves
[1:06:12] and and say that's me that's uh that's
[1:06:15] who I am ain't that right so so it's not
[1:06:18] just guessing as to what a Christian is
[1:06:22] uh uh it's it's when we're looking in
[1:06:25] the word
[1:06:26] then we're seeing it's the same action
[1:06:28] as that boy looked into the mirror it
[1:06:31] was the same action what whatever he did
[1:06:33] the boy in the mirror did it it was just
[1:06:36] it it was the same thing and and so then
[1:06:40] uh uh we can see ourselves fully in the
[1:06:43] word of God and our action is the same
[1:06:46] action that is in the word amen they're
[1:06:50] written in the word of us to do amen and
[1:06:54] so uh it's just like the action of
[1:06:57] Christ was the same action that the
[1:06:59] Bible uh had spoke of him and and so
[1:07:03] that's why he would tell them search the
[1:07:05] scriptures for in them you think you
[1:07:06] have eternal life but they testify of me
[1:07:10] amen and so uh uh we find that the Bible
[1:07:14] tells us what and who Christ was it
[1:07:17] tells us what he was who he was and and
[1:07:22] John 1:1 a very familiar scripture to us
[1:07:25] but it says in the beginning was the
[1:07:27] word the word was with God and the Word
[1:07:30] was God and the word the 14th verse was
[1:07:33] made flesh and dwelt Among Us so that's
[1:07:36] what the father was or that's what Jesus
[1:07:39] was he was he was the word amen made
[1:07:43] flesh and so uh he was it was the mirror
[1:07:47] in John 10:30 Jesus says I and my father
[1:07:53] are one ain't that right
[1:07:56] see God was the the word amen that's
[1:07:58] what it says in the beginning was the
[1:08:00] word the word was with God the Word was
[1:08:02] God that word became flesh and here is
[1:08:06] Jesus saying I am my father are one we
[1:08:10] know there in John 148 Philip Sith unto
[1:08:13] him Lord show us the father and it
[1:08:15] sufficeth us and Jesus Sith unto him
[1:08:19] have I been so long with you and yet
[1:08:21] thou Hast not known me Phillip he that
[1:08:23] has seen me has seen the father how
[1:08:25] sayest thou then show us the father
[1:08:28] believest thou not that I'm in the
[1:08:29] Father the father in me the words that I
[1:08:31] speak unto you I speak not of myself but
[1:08:34] the father that dwelleth in me he doeth
[1:08:37] The Works ain't that right so we we
[1:08:41] believe that Jesus was made in the image
[1:08:43] of God and thought it not robbery to be
[1:08:46] equal with God ain't that right that's
[1:08:49] right he was the expressed image of God
[1:08:52] how many believes that he was the
[1:08:54] expressed image of of God for he was God
[1:08:57] he acted like God he preached like God
[1:09:00] he talked like God he walked like God
[1:09:03] Amen e everything about him he had the
[1:09:06] authority like God he raised the Dead uh
[1:09:09] like God uh uh there and the prophet
[1:09:12] says that God made Man In His Image
[1:09:16] after his kind amen after his kind Amen
[1:09:21] to be his word on
[1:09:23] Earth ain't that right he expressed it
[1:09:26] in Christ he was able to express his
[1:09:29] word which we would say he expressed
[1:09:32] himself in Jesus Christ and he says and
[1:09:36] what was God was in Christ everybody say
[1:09:39] God was in Christ he said that's a man
[1:09:42] after his kind God was in Christ that's
[1:09:46] a man after his kind when God which is
[1:09:49] the word how many knows he's the word
[1:09:52] and when the word was in Christ a man
[1:09:54] human man expressing itself through him
[1:09:59] that was God the word in Christ
[1:10:01] expressing itself ain't that right so
[1:10:05] really there's no other Christian
[1:10:07] outside of that God manifesting himself
[1:10:12] in in a body ain't that right so what is
[1:10:15] God's kind the prophet would ask well
[1:10:18] God's kind is the word for that's what
[1:10:21] God is he is the word ain't that right
[1:10:24] so that's the kind of man the prophet
[1:10:26] said he makes today amen is is the word
[1:10:30] man amen and so according to Romans
[1:10:35] 8:29 we have been predestinated to be
[1:10:38] conformed to the image of his dear son
[1:10:42] ain't that right amen and and you look
[1:10:45] in in 2 Corinthians 3:18 Paul says but
[1:10:49] we all with open face amen beholding as
[1:10:53] in a glass or a mirror the glory of the
[1:11:00] Lord excuse me are changed into the same
[1:11:05] image we're changed into the same image
[1:11:09] from glory to glory so this this isn't
[1:11:13] just something that we uh is just a
[1:11:16] figment of our imagination or just a
[1:11:18] mirage that we're looking at it's it's
[1:11:21] reality we're being changed into the
[1:11:23] same image from glor glory to glory even
[1:11:26] as by the spirit of the Lord ain't that
[1:11:30] right well then how is it that we're
[1:11:33] changed from from from uh uh uh uh this
[1:11:38] uh uh Into His Image amen how can we be
[1:11:42] changed well Jesus says I will be with
[1:11:45] you even in you ain't that right just as
[1:11:49] Jesus became the word amen because the
[1:11:53] the the Word was God and God God was in
[1:11:56] Christ so is it Christ saying I will be
[1:12:00] in you can you say am
[1:12:02] man so a a man must be born again which
[1:12:06] makes him a new creation in the image of
[1:12:10] God after his kind to express amen uh
[1:12:14] the word on Earth ain't that right so
[1:12:17] brother brandom says well what are we to
[1:12:20] be then he answers sons of God too see
[1:12:24] we are to be sons of of God too see with
[1:12:27] the expressed word in the church
[1:12:29] carrying on see that's the mystical Body
[1:12:32] of Christ carrying on the same works
[1:12:35] that Jesus did when he was here on Earth
[1:12:39] that's the kind after his
[1:12:42] kind can you say
[1:12:44] amen that's the kind after his kind
[1:12:48] carrying on his same Works amen carrying
[1:12:52] on that same image amen that Jesus
[1:12:55] Christ was when he was upon the earth
[1:13:00] now every denomination each denomination
[1:13:02] has its own kind each political party
[1:13:05] has its own kind each uh uh nation has
[1:13:09] its own kind the world has its own kind
[1:13:13] and if you're of the world then you
[1:13:15] you're you're after the world that's
[1:13:17] that's your kind amen but but we are
[1:13:20] sons of God we've been predestinated to
[1:13:24] be sons of God
[1:13:25] so therefore God has made us after his
[1:13:28] kind we're not of the world we don't fit
[1:13:31] in the world we can't identify with the
[1:13:34] world we identify with God can you say
[1:13:37] Amen sons of God are of God's kind now
[1:13:42] Jesus being of God's kind amen the
[1:13:45] expressed image of the father he sought
[1:13:48] to do the father's
[1:13:50] will John
[1:13:52] 4:34 he says my meat is to do the will
[1:13:55] of him that sent me and to finish his
[1:13:58] work his passion was to fulfill the word
[1:14:01] of God everything about him every fiber
[1:14:04] of his being was to do the will of the
[1:14:07] father to carry out that will amen and
[1:14:11] to please God Amen his life was filled
[1:14:14] with heartache it was filled with
[1:14:16] Rejection it was it was filled with
[1:14:19] misunderstandings and and all of these
[1:14:22] things because the world knew him not
[1:14:25] amen and so he stood in a in a society
[1:14:29] that did not understand him that
[1:14:31] rejected him despised him he was hated
[1:14:34] and despised Without a Cause amen he was
[1:14:37] ridiculed and mocked ain't that right
[1:14:40] and the only reason he was ridiculed and
[1:14:42] mocked was not because he acted weird as
[1:14:45] far as you know painting his you know
[1:14:48] his hair you know uh uh green and and
[1:14:51] and uh doing all kinds of weird things
[1:14:55] it was just simply he sought to do the
[1:14:57] will of the father he was an expressed
[1:15:00] image amen he was reflecting another
[1:15:03] kingdom that the world did not know
[1:15:06] understand amen he was holy in a midst
[1:15:10] of of a sinful generation he was
[1:15:12] righteous in the middle of the of an
[1:15:15] unrighteous generation can you say amen
[1:15:18] amen and an Unholy people despised him
[1:15:21] an Unholy people rejected him because
[1:15:25] they didn't understand his life they
[1:15:28] they didn't you know we could put it in
[1:15:30] our term when he was a teenager they
[1:15:31] wanted to go you know drink they wanted
[1:15:34] to go to the parties they wanted to amen
[1:15:37] uh live it up but he didn't do them
[1:15:39] things so therefore they said oh you're
[1:15:41] weird and and and but his own life
[1:15:44] condemned them amen he didn't condemn
[1:15:47] them but his life condemned
[1:15:51] them
[1:15:53] amen he continued to do the will of the
[1:15:56] father he even submitted to death
[1:15:59] knowing it was the will of the father
[1:16:01] for him to die amen and yet his body
[1:16:05] didn't want to that human flesh was
[1:16:07] screaming out no amen but yet he was
[1:16:10] able to bring his body under subjection
[1:16:13] Jesus said if it be thy will let this
[1:16:16] cup pass from me amen but nevertheless
[1:16:18] not my will but thine be done ain't that
[1:16:21] right so then you know the Bible tells
[1:16:25] us that there was a purpose for his
[1:16:28] death though God wasn't just sending his
[1:16:30] son to to die just to do it amen to show
[1:16:34] his power of Resurrection but there was
[1:16:37] a purpose in his death amen and I want
[1:16:41] to read some scriptures uh to establish
[1:16:44] that fact to us Romans uh 5 and 6 when
[1:16:48] we were yet without
[1:16:51] Strength In Due Time Christ died
[1:16:55] for the
[1:16:57] ungodly ain't that right that's me see
[1:17:01] for scarcely for a righteous man will
[1:17:03] one die uh uh yet per adventure for a a
[1:17:07] good man some would even dare to die but
[1:17:11] God commendeth his love toward us in
[1:17:14] that while we were yet sinners Christ
[1:17:16] died for us so the the death was for us
[1:17:21] him hanging on the cross was for us do
[1:17:24] you believe that that was the will of
[1:17:26] God that was the will of the father amen
[1:17:29] the whole purpose of Christ's life was
[1:17:31] for
[1:17:33] us first first Corinthians
[1:17:36] 15:3 says I delivered unto you first of
[1:17:40] all that which I also received how that
[1:17:43] Christ died for our sins according to
[1:17:46] the scriptures Christ died for
[1:17:49] us amen John 17 uh 19 for their sake
[1:17:54] Jesus prayed
[1:17:55] break it in here it says for their sake
[1:17:57] I sanctify myself that they might also
[1:18:00] be Sanctified through the truth so see
[1:18:03] the life that Jesus lived and we're
[1:18:05] talking about being a Christian
[1:18:07] Christlike walking pleasing unto him the
[1:18:09] life that Christ lived was a sacrificial
[1:18:12] life do you believe that his ministry
[1:18:15] was was uh an unselfish Ministry he
[1:18:18] didn't think of himself he didn't try to
[1:18:20] build a name aen for himself he lived
[1:18:23] for others
[1:18:25] can you say that with me he lived for
[1:18:27] others he lived for others amen now
[1:18:30] there are good people throughout the
[1:18:32] world that you know that lives for
[1:18:34] others as well but they operate by
[1:18:36] humanitarian efforts amen humanitarian I
[1:18:41] I just looked it up it means showing
[1:18:43] concern for the welfare of humanity
[1:18:46] especially in acting to improve the
[1:18:49] living conditions of impoverished people
[1:18:52] a person promoting human welfare and
[1:18:55] social reform so there there there's a
[1:18:57] lot of humanitarian efforts and people
[1:18:59] are doing this out of Good Will to help
[1:19:02] others they feed the poor they help the
[1:19:05] needy build hospitals for the sick build
[1:19:07] mental WS uh for those who are who have
[1:19:11] uh the mentally insane and and and you
[1:19:14] know we're we're th thankful I am for
[1:19:17] for the the work that these institutions
[1:19:19] do and and all these things but when you
[1:19:22] when you really think of it none of
[1:19:24] these have the ability to break the
[1:19:26] power that sin has on an individual's
[1:19:31] life can you say Amen they Thrive
[1:19:34] through education and science but when
[1:19:37] Jesus came to Earth he didn't build
[1:19:39] hospitals he didn't build menal WS he he
[1:19:42] he didn't start charity missions and
[1:19:45] things like that that's not what the
[1:19:48] father sent him to
[1:19:51] do can you say Amen and I uh you know
[1:19:55] and if you disagree with that then show
[1:19:57] me where he did show me where he started
[1:20:00] these things but yet he said I do the
[1:20:02] will of the father now now Christian
[1:20:05] Christianity the only form of
[1:20:08] Christianity is being Christlike it's
[1:20:10] not being patterned after anything else
[1:20:13] but patterning our lives after Christ
[1:20:16] and and and so then uh we look Luke 4
[1:20:19] and18 Jesus said the spirit of the Lord
[1:20:23] is upon me so he knew and and then he
[1:20:26] goes into why it wasn't to build
[1:20:28] hospitals it wasn't to start functions
[1:20:30] and charity things and all these things
[1:20:33] but Heath anointed me to preach the
[1:20:35] gospel to the
[1:20:37] poor he has sent me to heal the
[1:20:40] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[1:20:43] the captives and recovering of sight to
[1:20:45] the blind to set at Liberty them that
[1:20:47] are bruised to preach the acceptable
[1:20:49] year of the Lord you look at 1 John 3
[1:20:52] and8 breaking in it says for for this
[1:20:55] purpose the Son of God was manifested
[1:20:57] that he might destroy the works of the
[1:21:00] devil can you say amen amen not teach us
[1:21:04] how to cope with the devil but to break
[1:21:07] the the very power of the devil in our
[1:21:12] lives now so we we see that Christ live
[1:21:16] for others and like I said there there's
[1:21:19] others that that other people that live
[1:21:22] for others but but Christ Liv for others
[1:21:25] that he might destroy the devil's uh
[1:21:28] Power in their lives that that he might
[1:21:32] uh that he might heal them from the
[1:21:34] devil's scars that he might heal up the
[1:21:37] wounds from from from whatever the devil
[1:21:40] has done to them that's way Christ lived
[1:21:43] for them amen was to take Satan or take
[1:21:47] them out of Satan's
[1:21:49] grip you see his ministry didn't operate
[1:21:53] on the side of Education in science his
[1:21:56] ministry was
[1:21:57] Supernatural see and so the prophet said
[1:22:00] the church wasn't commissioned to build
[1:22:02] you know uh schools and hospitals and
[1:22:05] and and and things like that that's not
[1:22:07] what our commission is amen but but
[1:22:10] notice Mark
[1:22:12] 16:15 Jesus said go ye into all the
[1:22:16] world and preach the gospel and that
[1:22:19] word preaches to
[1:22:21] demonstrate amen the gospel in its power
[1:22:24] Amen to Every Creature he that believeth
[1:22:27] and is baptized shall be saved but he
[1:22:29] that believeth not shall be damned and
[1:22:33] these signs shall follow them that
[1:22:35] believe in my name they shall
[1:22:38] what cast out Devils they shall speak
[1:22:41] with new tongues they shall take up
[1:22:43] serpents and if they drink any deadly
[1:22:45] thing it shall not hurt them they shall
[1:22:48] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:22:50] recover amen John 14:12 verily verily I
[1:22:53] say unto you Jesus saying he that
[1:22:56] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:22:57] shall he do also and Greater Works than
[1:22:59] these shall he do because I go unto my
[1:23:02] father now the prophet would tell us
[1:23:05] that education has taken the place of
[1:23:07] the holy spirit in the church but he
[1:23:10] said education's all right but that is
[1:23:12] not God's
[1:23:14] program the church is not to rely upon
[1:23:17] education the church is not to rely upon
[1:23:19] science the church is not to rely upon
[1:23:22] the carnal mind amen see that's not
[1:23:25] God's program he said if education was
[1:23:27] to take the place well then Christ would
[1:23:30] have established schools when he was
[1:23:32] upon the Earth but Christ never did
[1:23:34] establish a school Christ established a
[1:23:39] church
[1:23:41] amen not a church of intellectual but
[1:23:45] out of a bunch of illiterate fishermen
[1:23:48] who were willing to listen to the Holy
[1:23:50] Spirit and be led
[1:23:53] accordingly ain't that that right now in
[1:23:56] John 20 21 Jesus said as my father has
[1:24:00] sent me even so send I you ain't that
[1:24:04] right brother brandom asked well how did
[1:24:06] the father send him though because as
[1:24:09] the father sent him he sends us the same
[1:24:12] way that's right so how did the father
[1:24:15] send him the father that sent him came
[1:24:18] down from heaven and dwelt in
[1:24:21] [Music]
[1:24:22] him and he went forth and he said I
[1:24:25] always do that which pleases my father
[1:24:27] he went about doing the things that the
[1:24:29] father was showing him to do I do
[1:24:32] nothing except my father for show me the
[1:24:35] god that sent him was on the inside of
[1:24:38] him and he sends the church the same way
[1:24:41] the father sent
[1:24:43] him God in us can you say
[1:24:48] Amen so brother Brandon would ask then
[1:24:50] what is it it's God in you that's right
[1:24:53] can you say that God in me it's God in
[1:24:56] Me this this isn't a a a natural thing
[1:25:01] it's God in
[1:25:03] Meen God and me carrying out what the
[1:25:07] same Works carrying on the same works
[1:25:11] and by this we are showing forth his
[1:25:14] resurrection that he's alive today
[1:25:17] that's right can you say Amen now second
[1:25:21] Corinthians and I'm I'm getting
[1:25:23] somewhere but 2 Corinthians
[1:25:26] 5:20 Paul would tell usow then we are
[1:25:29] ambassadors for
[1:25:31] Christ we're not ambassadors for the
[1:25:34] United
[1:25:35] States we're not speaking in the name of
[1:25:37] the United States we're not speaking for
[1:25:40] some political party but we are
[1:25:43] ambassadors for Christ amen he has sent
[1:25:47] us and as he was an ambassador for God
[1:25:50] Almighty we are ambassadors for Christ
[1:25:56] amen as though God did beseech You by us
[1:25:59] we pray you in Christ
[1:26:02] dead you get it I'm standing here
[1:26:05] preaching to you in Christ
[1:26:07] dead when you're witnessing to others
[1:26:10] you're witnessing in Christ dead when
[1:26:12] you're praying for others you're praying
[1:26:14] in Christ dead for others you are the
[1:26:18] Ambassador now amen when you're singing
[1:26:21] when you're when you're going out in
[1:26:23] into the world and and they're watching
[1:26:26] your life you are there in the stad of
[1:26:29] Christ you're in Christ dead you're
[1:26:33] there on the job in Christ dead you're
[1:26:35] at school in Christ
[1:26:38] dead can you say man yes sir see we pray
[1:26:43] you in Christ dead that you be
[1:26:45] reconciled to God was that not Christ's
[1:26:49] desire was the people to be reconciled
[1:26:52] back to God sure it was God was in
[1:26:55] Christ reconciling the world unto
[1:26:57] himself that was The Passion of Christ
[1:27:01] therefore we stand in Christ dead saying
[1:27:03] be ye reconciled to God Amen it's the
[1:27:07] same passion it's the same desire it's
[1:27:10] the same
[1:27:11] life now notice the 21st verse for he
[1:27:15] hath made him to be sin for
[1:27:19] us God made Christ to be sin for
[1:27:22] us who knew no sin that we might be made
[1:27:27] the righteousness of God in
[1:27:30] him don't you see it that the burden now
[1:27:33] is within
[1:27:35] us as the father sent him out into the
[1:27:38] world that the world may be reconciled
[1:27:41] back to God so he has sent us into the
[1:27:44] world that the unbelieving sinner may be
[1:27:48] reconciled back to God in this
[1:27:52] age what is God he was made in the image
[1:27:57] of God he was the conformed in that same
[1:28:03] image well John 1 John 4:8 tells us that
[1:28:07] God is love say it with me God is
[1:28:11] love God is
[1:28:14] love now we know by the message that
[1:28:16] there are different kinds of love it's
[1:28:18] not all one love the same love there's
[1:28:21] different kinds of love but this love
[1:28:23] that God is is the purest of
[1:28:26] love this love is divine love which is
[1:28:29] agapo love
[1:28:31] agape and the word Agape in the Greek is
[1:28:34] a term that denotes a
[1:28:36] profound and sacrificial
[1:28:39] love that transcends and
[1:28:42] persists regardless of circumstances all
[1:28:46] right I want to say that again because
[1:28:49] again God is
[1:28:51] love agapo love in the Greek is a term
[1:28:55] that denotes a
[1:28:57] profound and sacrificial love Lord that
[1:29:03] transcends and persists regardless of
[1:29:07] circumstances amen now is that not how
[1:29:09] God loved
[1:29:12] you right we all have our own story and
[1:29:17] if you really feel the way Paul felt we
[1:29:19] all feel like we were the chiefest of
[1:29:22] Sinners I know I was
[1:29:25] and yet God's love was
[1:29:28] persistent to me regardless of my
[1:29:32] conditions regardless of the
[1:29:33] circumstance that I was in it was able
[1:29:35] to
[1:29:37] transcend its profound love and
[1:29:40] sacrificial
[1:29:42] amen it is the highest form of Love Char
[1:29:45] characterized by its selflessness and
[1:29:48] unconditional
[1:29:50] nature it's the love that God has for
[1:29:53] his people and is the re reciprocal love
[1:29:58] that they have for God and extends to
[1:30:02] fellow Humanity so so again this agapo
[1:30:06] love is not only a love that God has for
[1:30:09] his people but it's a love wherein God's
[1:30:13] people loves him
[1:30:15] back and loves his fellow
[1:30:18] manise Lord
[1:30:20] right because now we're made in the
[1:30:23] image of God yeah we're after God's Own
[1:30:26] Kind amen that's right it's a love that
[1:30:30] is
[1:30:34] intentional not
[1:30:35] accidental it's
[1:30:39] intentional in other words I we we we
[1:30:42] won't say well I didn't know that guy
[1:30:44] was like that or I wouldn't have even
[1:30:45] been
[1:30:46] tried it's intentional God knew where
[1:30:50] you
[1:30:51] were God knew how of a whole life I was
[1:30:55] but he loved me
[1:30:56] anyways while I was yet a sinner Christ
[1:31:00] died for
[1:31:02] me because this love is
[1:31:08] intentional it's a love that is
[1:31:10] intentional and notice what this other
[1:31:13] definition or whatever it's a conscious
[1:31:17] Choice yes sir so it wasn't just he
[1:31:20] accidentally stumbled upon me it was a
[1:31:23] conscience choice that he loved me
[1:31:27] amen and is not motivated by emotional
[1:31:31] attraction of familial
[1:31:34] bonds can you say Amen true see so then
[1:31:39] if if we look at this agapo love that
[1:31:42] God is God is love agapo love the
[1:31:45] highest form of love that there is well
[1:31:48] then this love cannot be
[1:31:51] impersonated amen you can't you you you
[1:31:55] you understand right it cannot be
[1:31:57] impersonated because it's God and comes
[1:32:00] from God
[1:32:01] Alone there's all other loves but it can
[1:32:04] never come to this type of a love
[1:32:06] because it's
[1:32:09] God the Lord you cannot impersonate love
[1:32:13] you realize Satan cannot impersonate
[1:32:15] this kind of
[1:32:17] love Jesus was not an
[1:32:20] impersonator he was not going around
[1:32:22] saying I love you I love you bud
[1:32:24] I love you sis I love you no it was he
[1:32:28] wasn't an
[1:32:30] impersonator he was God manifested in
[1:32:37] flesh Lord ain't that
[1:32:40] right so see he came the prophet said he
[1:32:43] came to show man what God
[1:32:46] is here he is a human
[1:32:50] being manifesting God to human man
[1:32:54] amen
[1:32:56] true ain't that right we didn't
[1:32:59] understand God as a
[1:33:01] spirit so God became
[1:33:04] man and in that body of Jesus Christ God
[1:33:08] would show us really what he
[1:33:11] is how could he show us such Divine love
[1:33:15] unless he was rejected and despised and
[1:33:18] spat upon and mocked and re ridiculed
[1:33:22] and hated without a c
[1:33:24] and yet and his death hanging on a cross
[1:33:27] looking at his Killers his murderers and
[1:33:30] saying father forgive them true
[1:33:36] amen so we find that this first display
[1:33:41] of love that we
[1:33:43] see was in the garden after man
[1:33:46] disobeyed
[1:33:48] God and right after man and woman had
[1:33:51] sinned the holy image of God left him
[1:33:53] the Prophet said and they covered
[1:33:55] themselves the Bible says they covered
[1:33:57] themselves with with fig leaves because
[1:34:00] they realized that they were
[1:34:02] necked and so uh they covered themselves
[1:34:05] up but when God came looking for them
[1:34:08] they ran and hid themselves from the
[1:34:10] presence of God which showed that their
[1:34:13] man-made covering was not good enough to
[1:34:17] hide their sins from God
[1:34:20] Amen and and so they couldn't stand in
[1:34:23] the presence of God without being
[1:34:27] condemned and and we find that this
[1:34:31] first display of love if we could say it
[1:34:33] that
[1:34:34] way that that we see to
[1:34:38] humankind man is when God slew a
[1:34:44] lamb and he took the skin of that lamb
[1:34:47] and he wrapped them he clothed them to
[1:34:51] where they could stand there and talk
[1:34:53] walk with God
[1:34:56] right and and
[1:34:58] so we understand what God said to them
[1:35:01] you know he asked Adam you know why are
[1:35:03] you in this condition she made me do it
[1:35:06] and then he asked the woman well she
[1:35:08] points to the serpent he made me do it
[1:35:11] so the buck was passed all the way down
[1:35:14] God cursed the serpent God spoke to Eve
[1:35:18] God God done every God spoke to them you
[1:35:21] understand and we all know what he was
[1:35:23] say said if you don't go back to Genesis
[1:35:26] and read it but before God sent them
[1:35:30] away and and and the prophet describes
[1:35:33] it and he tells us that he's looking
[1:35:36] through he says we're going to we're
[1:35:37] looking now and he's actually through
[1:35:40] vision watching Adam and Eve is is
[1:35:44] hugging one another they got their heads
[1:35:47] bowed and they're running out of the
[1:35:48] garden and he says the the bloody blood
[1:35:51] from that animal is dripping down down
[1:35:53] their legs and that skin is flapping
[1:35:56] against their he says we're watching
[1:35:57] this and as they're going this way God
[1:35:59] is going this
[1:36:01] way and then he says God stops and turns
[1:36:04] around and says but wait
[1:36:08] wait here they're sobbing because they
[1:36:10] know what they did they've been rejected
[1:36:13] from the presence of God and he says
[1:36:16] then out of
[1:36:17] love God says but I will I will redeem
[1:36:22] you I'll come back you ain't always
[1:36:26] going to be this way I'll bring you
[1:36:29] back he said what was it it was
[1:36:32] L he loved his children until he
[1:36:36] couldn't turn them away and so God made
[1:36:39] preparation to redeem brother brandom in
[1:36:42] another place he says I can hear
[1:36:44] something going on like this and he
[1:36:45] claps three times what is it it's the
[1:36:47] old bloody sheep skin beating against
[1:36:50] Adam's big manly legs as he went walking
[1:36:53] out of the presence of God God couldn't
[1:36:54] stand at all that great eternity come
[1:36:56] down to four letters l o e God so loved
[1:37:00] he couldn't see his children go out in
[1:37:02] that kind of a condition separating from
[1:37:04] him he stopped and he said wait a minute
[1:37:08] I'll put enmity between your seed and
[1:37:10] the Serpent's Seed promising a savior he
[1:37:13] said let's turn our camera now 4,000
[1:37:15] years later there's a great carrying on
[1:37:17] in Jerusalem we're sitting in a building
[1:37:20] saying and we say what is all this noise
[1:37:22] about where where did it it come from
[1:37:24] and look out and somebody say well
[1:37:27] there's a Holy Roller out there they're
[1:37:29] going to crucify him this morning he's
[1:37:31] done nothing but just tear up the
[1:37:33] churches around here and everything and
[1:37:35] so they're going to crucify him let's go
[1:37:37] at the window and look out there comes
[1:37:39] the man down the street over them
[1:37:42] cobblestones dragging an Old Rugged
[1:37:44] Cross he's got a garment on wol
[1:37:47] throughout without seams and he starts
[1:37:49] up gotha yonder I look I began to look
[1:37:52] on his back I see little red spots over
[1:37:55] his coat and I say what are those red
[1:37:58] spots I keep watching them as he goes
[1:38:01] the spots get bigger and bigger and
[1:38:02] bigger now they just run into one big
[1:38:04] bloody spot I hear something going on
[1:38:07] brother Brandon claps three times he
[1:38:09] says what is it it's the second Adam the
[1:38:11] Redeemer going Yonder to Calvary bearing
[1:38:15] away the Lamb of God taking away the
[1:38:17] sins of the world up yonder to Calvary
[1:38:20] it's the most pathetic picture that was
[1:38:22] ever pictured
[1:38:24] you see God had prepared a lamb and this
[1:38:28] was what
[1:38:29] Jesus was doing is I've I my meat is to
[1:38:33] do the will of him that sent me the
[1:38:36] Bible tells us that God had prepared a
[1:38:39] way before the foundation of the world
[1:38:41] for the lamb was slain uh then before
[1:38:44] the foundation of the world God knew
[1:38:46] that man would become enslaved to the
[1:38:49] devil and and he would fall but because
[1:38:53] he so loved Humanity that he prepared A
[1:38:57] A Plan of Redemption can you say man and
[1:39:00] even though that Adam and Eve had fall
[1:39:03] he made sure that they understood God
[1:39:06] made sure I mean this is by his love God
[1:39:09] so loved man that he made sure that Adam
[1:39:14] and Eve understood that there would come
[1:39:19] Redemption amen before they ever left
[1:39:22] that that Garden before they left his
[1:39:24] presence he wanted them to have a clear
[1:39:27] understanding that they would not be
[1:39:29] like this
[1:39:30] forever that's the love of God amise the
[1:39:35] Lord the lamb that Abel killed for a
[1:39:38] sacrifice was a type of Christ as we
[1:39:40] know brother Bram said Abel's death was
[1:39:43] the type of Christ's death Abel's birth
[1:39:47] was a type of Christ
[1:39:50] Resurrection Isaac carrying the wood of
[1:39:52] the burnt offering up the mountain was a
[1:39:55] typee of Christ carrying the cross up
[1:39:57] the hill Isaac laying on the altar was a
[1:40:01] type of Christ on the cross the ram that
[1:40:04] God spoke into existence to be the
[1:40:08] sacrificial substitute was a type of
[1:40:10] Christ being our
[1:40:12] substitute Moses striking The Rock in
[1:40:15] the wilderness so that the Waters of
[1:40:16] life could come forth it spoke of Christ
[1:40:19] being smitten so that the Waters of life
[1:40:22] could come forth for an eternal uh uh uh
[1:40:28] preservation see God moved upon men to
[1:40:31] write songs throughout the Bible
[1:40:33] throughout time that spoke of the
[1:40:35] Redeemer to come he moved on men to
[1:40:38] write poems of of the coming Redeemer
[1:40:42] it's all been through this Bible that's
[1:40:44] why the the prophet would tell us that
[1:40:46] this Bible is is one big Love Story it's
[1:40:49] it's a love story because it speaks of
[1:40:51] Christ every every part of of of of of
[1:40:55] the the pages of every verse every word
[1:40:58] every letter it's it's speaking of
[1:41:01] Christ Christ Christ is the theme and
[1:41:04] and it's all speaking and all of this
[1:41:07] comes from the love of God you
[1:41:09] understand what I'm saying Christ would
[1:41:11] make sure that when one Prophet died
[1:41:14] another Prophet would rise it would be
[1:41:16] he would be speaking of Christ the
[1:41:18] Redeemer to come of a people that would
[1:41:20] be come to Salvation of a people that
[1:41:23] would be redeemed and would be restored
[1:41:25] and when that Prophet would go down God
[1:41:27] would raise up another Prophet telling
[1:41:29] the same story amen there's not one
[1:41:32] contradiction in this
[1:41:34] Bible it's all one thing because the
[1:41:37] spirit of God would fall upon one
[1:41:38] Prophet then it would fall upon another
[1:41:40] Prophet it would fall upon another
[1:41:42] Prophet it would fall upon Ruth and and
[1:41:44] it would fall upon uh uh all of these
[1:41:47] others you know just even the the the
[1:41:49] the story of Ruth speaks of redemption
[1:41:51] of the bride and and we all all know
[1:41:53] these things and sometimes we take it
[1:41:55] for granted but this was the spirit of
[1:41:57] God he's
[1:41:59] love God is love how can you have god of
[1:42:03] love move and there's no story of
[1:42:06] Redemption how can we have God moving
[1:42:08] who is
[1:42:13] love and and and then the people be
[1:42:16] condemned leave
[1:42:18] condemned
[1:42:20] without without having a chance of of
[1:42:24] restoration I hope you
[1:42:26] understand love calls him to do
[1:42:30] it we see that through time and Through
[1:42:33] the Bible God rebuked and punished
[1:42:36] Humanity for their
[1:42:38] sins but through all of that time the
[1:42:41] love of
[1:42:43] God he kept reminding them he kept
[1:42:47] reminding there's coming a redeemer he
[1:42:50] never let them lose that Focus because
[1:42:54] he couldn't lose it right he so
[1:42:57] loved that no matter what sins they done
[1:43:00] he kept Christ Christ is coming yes he
[1:43:04] would punish them but he would always
[1:43:05] bring an atonement in their midst
[1:43:08] Lord can you say Amen whether it was the
[1:43:12] lamb or whether it was the Brazen
[1:43:13] serpent or whether it was you know the
[1:43:16] the angel coming upon the waters of
[1:43:18] Bethesda it was always speaking of
[1:43:20] redemption
[1:43:26] but love caused him to keep reminding
[1:43:29] mankind of the coming
[1:43:31] Redeemer there are many types that God
[1:43:34] used in the Bible to testify of the
[1:43:37] Redeemer that was to come because it was
[1:43:40] the expression of God's love to
[1:43:43] humanity and we see that it is the love
[1:43:46] of God that produced Christ to the
[1:43:48] world we thinking of well you know he
[1:43:51] was the spoken word he was he you know
[1:43:54] God just spoke his word and and it
[1:43:56] formed in the womb of Mary but but what
[1:43:58] was that what was the motive
[1:44:02] love ain't that right so love produced
[1:44:05] Christ God's love brought forth
[1:44:12] Christ and I said today it's the only
[1:44:14] thing that'll produce him
[1:44:16] again love divine love will be the only
[1:44:19] thing that will produce Christ again
[1:44:27] it took God 4,000 years to make this
[1:44:30] masterpiece
[1:44:32] Christ and again God's motive for making
[1:44:34] this masterpiece was divine love you see
[1:44:38] love must be the motive behind
[1:44:40] everything that we
[1:44:41] do as
[1:44:43] Christians it was the motive behind God
[1:44:45] when he had raised up Prophet after
[1:44:47] Prophet it was love that caused him to
[1:44:49] do it amen it was the grace of God
[1:44:54] how how did the smitten Rock come it was
[1:44:56] love Lord the Brazen serpent it was love
[1:44:59] who would have ever thought of these
[1:45:01] things but God's love produced it
[1:45:04] because it was speaking of Christ to
[1:45:06] come he wanted his people to
[1:45:09] know that I ain't going to leave you
[1:45:11] like
[1:45:12] this now I'll give you a temporary
[1:45:15] relief but remember he's
[1:45:17] coming and it'll give you an eternal
[1:45:21] restoration the Lord so then when Christ
[1:45:24] come which was God's love gift to the
[1:45:27] world he kept putting himself as that
[1:45:30] one I was that
[1:45:32] rock I am that rock I was the one before
[1:45:36] Abraham right you understand what I'm
[1:45:39] saying he he kept revealing himself I
[1:45:41] was that Brazen serpent I am
[1:45:46] him because it was love you see love
[1:45:50] what would cause Jesus to continue doing
[1:45:52] the will of the father it was love but
[1:45:55] he didn't have a different kind of love
[1:45:57] than God because God was in him am so
[1:46:01] therefore God reflecting that love
[1:46:03] through all the prophets and through all
[1:46:04] the sages and through every story in the
[1:46:07] Old Testament now was being reflected in
[1:46:09] this
[1:46:10] man that would cause him to fulfill
[1:46:14] every type of the Bible that spoke of
[1:46:17] Messiah to come can you say
[1:46:20] Amen now love must be the motive behind
[1:46:22] our
[1:46:23] preaching behind our singing behind our
[1:46:27] worship behind our life it must be
[1:46:31] behind the motive behind our testimony
[1:46:34] it must be the motive behind everything
[1:46:36] that we do love must be its
[1:46:39] motive that's
[1:46:42] true it must be the motive behind gifts
[1:46:45] amen can you
[1:46:47] sayen see so when the New Testament
[1:46:50] Church went forth from the day of
[1:46:52] Pentecost
[1:46:53] they preached the gospel they prayed for
[1:46:55] the sick they witnessed they established
[1:46:58] churches they gave their time they gave
[1:47:01] their energy they gave it all to God yes
[1:47:04] they sold everything that they had but
[1:47:07] what was the motive
[1:47:10] love see they had nothing selfish it
[1:47:14] wasn't a selfish Ministry it wasn't to
[1:47:17] say well see look at me I just preached
[1:47:20] to a thousand people today man we had a
[1:47:22] good great great time great time great
[1:47:25] time no it was love divine
[1:47:29] love why because the very spirit that
[1:47:33] was in Christ now was in
[1:47:36] them amen can you say
[1:47:40] Amen so we we find I know I hope this is
[1:47:43] a help to you but it's it's just
[1:47:45] something simple but Christ being God's
[1:47:48] love gift John 3:16 we know it very well
[1:47:51] for God so loved the world that he he
[1:47:53] gave his only begotten son you realize
[1:47:55] this love is so profound that we can't
[1:47:57] even attain to it without God himself we
[1:48:01] can't even understand this kind of
[1:48:04] love but yet it's there it's written and
[1:48:07] it's become the most common scripture I
[1:48:09] think for God so loved the world that he
[1:48:12] gave his only begotten son and yet so
[1:48:14] many people so many men preach from this
[1:48:16] sermon with selfish attitudes and
[1:48:18] selfish
[1:48:19] motives because they have not that love
[1:48:22] within
[1:48:25] them God so loved that he sought to
[1:48:27] redeem his children and this word redeem
[1:48:30] means to bring back to its original
[1:48:32] condition original place so see Divine
[1:48:36] love look for a redem remedy to bring
[1:48:38] the elect back to the original place
[1:48:41] this love produced the remedy which was
[1:48:43] Christ ain't that right and Jesus says
[1:48:46] without me you can do nothing another
[1:48:48] place I am the way I am the truth and
[1:48:50] the life another place he says I am come
[1:48:53] that you may have life and have it more
[1:48:55] abundantly if I be lifted up I will draw
[1:48:58] all men unto
[1:49:00] me why because God's love cannot produce
[1:49:05] anything greater or anything better than
[1:49:11] Christ that's why when a man has the
[1:49:14] true love of God he can't look for any
[1:49:17] other way than point to Christ that's
[1:49:21] right and we know that Christ the only
[1:49:24] way you can point to Christ is to
[1:49:26] manifest Christ we're not pointing to a
[1:49:29] Doctrine we're not pointing to a
[1:49:31] personality we're not pointing to a gift
[1:49:35] we are wanting to reflect Christ so that
[1:49:38] people can see Christ can you say
[1:49:44] Amen how different this love is from
[1:49:48] Human love see human love pies man it
[1:49:51] sympathizes with man in its Fallen
[1:49:54] state but it doesn't seek to bring
[1:49:57] people to
[1:49:58] Christ again it produces human love
[1:50:01] produces a lot of humanitarian effort
[1:50:04] programs degrees hospitals seminaries
[1:50:08] professionalism but it never gets people
[1:50:11] to Christ human love produces all kinds
[1:50:14] of churches and more churches and more
[1:50:17] churches and more churches but the
[1:50:20] prophet would would talk to the the
[1:50:22] churches of that day he says I'm afraid
[1:50:24] we're getting the people to church but
[1:50:26] not to Christ so somewhere they were
[1:50:29] lacking in
[1:50:31] love somewhere they were lacking in that
[1:50:34] Godly love can you say Amen if Divine
[1:50:38] love would produce Christ and the Divine
[1:50:40] love in us would bring him to Christ and
[1:50:43] produce Christ
[1:50:45] again God so loved the world that Christ
[1:50:48] was manifested to destroy the works of
[1:50:50] the devil now if you look uh uh Luke
[1:50:55] 1:76 and thou child shall be called the
[1:50:59] prophet of the highest for Thou shalt go
[1:51:01] before the face of the Lord to prepare
[1:51:03] his ways to give knowledge of Salvation
[1:51:06] unto his people by the remission of
[1:51:07] their sins through the tender mercy of
[1:51:10] our God whereby the day spring from on
[1:51:13] high hath visited us to give light to
[1:51:16] them that sit in darkness and the in the
[1:51:18] shadow of death to guide our feet into
[1:51:21] the way of Peace can you say amen so see
[1:51:24] if you could see that God being loved
[1:51:26] now you can see what that love that
[1:51:28] desire that is is being produced from
[1:51:31] that
[1:51:32] love it's to deliver the people from
[1:51:36] Darkness it's to set the people free can
[1:51:40] you say Amen everything that Satan has
[1:51:43] calls in in to humanity amen that love
[1:51:47] the desire of God by that love
[1:51:52] has wants to set him free pise the Lord
[1:51:55] God doesn't want us to set in
[1:51:57] confusion God doesn't want us to remain
[1:51:59] what we are helpless and beggarly can
[1:52:03] you say Amen so God wants to destroy
[1:52:05] Satan's power in people's lives that is
[1:52:08] the motive behind Divine love can you
[1:52:11] say Amen see so the love of God always
[1:52:15] always everybody say it always seeks to
[1:52:17] destroy the works of the
[1:52:20] devil why are we called old sons of
[1:52:24] God how did we get there the Bible gives
[1:52:27] the answer behold what manner of
[1:52:31] love is this that we should be called
[1:52:35] the sons of God so it was a
[1:52:38] love we are sons of God because God so
[1:52:42] loved and it's not just a gift of God it
[1:52:45] is
[1:52:50] God so we look at it 1 John 3:1 behold
[1:52:53] what manner of love the father hath
[1:52:55] bestowed upon us that we should be
[1:52:57] called or named the sons of
[1:53:02] God so we know whatever your
[1:53:06] name your named or called that's what
[1:53:09] identifies you right that's what
[1:53:12] identifies
[1:53:13] you when my dad called me son I realized
[1:53:16] I was his son he called me that before I
[1:53:19] understood what son was when he called
[1:53:21] me Shawn
[1:53:23] I didn't understand sea but I knew all
[1:53:25] of a sudden I just started responding to
[1:53:27] my name you call you know you you call
[1:53:31] Zoe you know and that little baby
[1:53:33] doesn't know much about it but you call
[1:53:36] her name and she looks because she's
[1:53:39] already identifying what you've named
[1:53:42] her you understand what I'm saying what
[1:53:45] manner of love the father hath bestowed
[1:53:47] upon us that we are named sons of God
[1:53:51] lord we can't can't identify with
[1:53:53] nothing else we are Sons how many sons
[1:53:56] and daughters of
[1:53:57] God Amen see so that's what identifies
[1:54:01] us therefore therefore John says the
[1:54:04] world knoweth us
[1:54:06] not because it knew him not beloved now
[1:54:09] we are the sons of God and it does not
[1:54:12] yet appear what we shall be but we know
[1:54:14] that when he shall appear we shall be
[1:54:16] like him for we shall see him as he is
[1:54:19] now one writer said of the scripture he
[1:54:21] says this love is an exotic
[1:54:25] love well I I looked up what exotic it
[1:54:29] it means that this it's it's foreign
[1:54:32] This Love This Kind of Love is foreign
[1:54:36] to the human
[1:54:38] heart see so he goes on to say the
[1:54:41] father permanently everybody say
[1:54:44] permanently the father permanently
[1:54:47] bestowed this love upon us to the end
[1:54:50] that we may be named children children
[1:54:53] born ones of God and we
[1:54:56] are can you say amen and he have besto
[1:55:00] this love I looked up this word bestow
[1:55:03] to put to
[1:55:05] use to
[1:55:06] apply to put in a particular or
[1:55:10] appropriate
[1:55:12] Place true can you say amen amen so this
[1:55:16] love is placed upon us as a
[1:55:20] gift it's not earned
[1:55:23] can you say say Amen it's a gift not
[1:55:27] earned and then the writer goes on and
[1:55:29] on this account the world does not have
[1:55:32] an experimental knowledge of
[1:55:34] us because it has not come into an
[1:55:37] experiment experimental knowledge of him
[1:55:42] Divine loved ones now born ones of God
[1:55:46] we are can you say amen amen So Divine
[1:55:50] love is an exotic love it's foreign
[1:55:53] something that I looked up this foreign
[1:55:55] it means something that is introduced
[1:55:57] from another country mysteriously
[1:56:00] different unusual is not this love come
[1:56:04] from God is different yeah it's it's
[1:56:08] it's it's been introduced to Earthly man
[1:56:11] from a another
[1:56:13] world what kind of love is this but all
[1:56:16] we know it was bestowed upon us and now
[1:56:18] we are the sons of God and Satan has
[1:56:22] lost his power over
[1:56:24] us because of such
[1:56:27] love can you say Amen it's foreign
[1:56:31] because no man has it and you say amen
[1:56:34] and we know it's foreign we know it's
[1:56:36] foreign because it's produced something
[1:56:38] that no other love has
[1:56:41] produced man may feel sorry for you out
[1:56:44] of human love but it'll never produce
[1:56:45] sons of God but God's love bestowed upon
[1:56:49] us produce Sons amen
[1:56:54] amen what if this Divine love didn't
[1:56:57] exist but we couldn't be called sons of
[1:57:00] God
[1:57:02] right then then this tells us that
[1:57:06] Divine love has its own
[1:57:09] effect and produces its own
[1:57:12] results no matter the
[1:57:15] gift no matter the ministry the
[1:57:18] knowledge the work and ability the
[1:57:20] testimony that a man may have
[1:57:23] have without Divine love it cannot
[1:57:26] produce what God
[1:57:28] desires
[1:57:29] sons of God the Lord can you say
[1:57:34] amen amen what good would it do to
[1:57:37] preach to sing to testify to witness to
[1:57:40] others it Divine love isn't
[1:57:43] there what good would it do to pray for
[1:57:45] the sick if Divine love wasn't there
[1:57:48] what good would it do to have a gift
[1:57:52] and it be operated every night if it
[1:57:55] isn't operated by Divine
[1:57:57] love can you say amen amen 1 Corinthians
[1:58:01] 13 And1 though I speak with the tongues
[1:58:04] of men and angels and have not charity
[1:58:06] I'm become a sounding brass or a
[1:58:08] tinkling symbol and though I have the
[1:58:10] gift of Prophecy and understand all
[1:58:12] Mysteries and all knowledge and though I
[1:58:14] have all Faith though that so that I
[1:58:16] could remove mountains and have not
[1:58:18] charity I am nothing and though I bestow
[1:58:20] all my goods to feed the poor and though
[1:58:22] I give my body to be burned and have not
[1:58:24] charity it profiteth me nothing so
[1:58:27] brother Brandon would tell us I'd rather
[1:58:29] have the love of God sealed in my heart
[1:58:30] than all the gifts there is in the Bible
[1:58:32] am another place he said if the Lord
[1:58:35] Jesus should stand on the platform
[1:58:36] tonight and look me in the face and say
[1:58:38] I'm going to give you your choice you
[1:58:40] can be a great person a great Minister
[1:58:43] I'll give you a gift of preaching the
[1:58:45] gospel or I'll give you a gift of
[1:58:46] teaching the word or I'll give you the
[1:58:48] gift of Divine Healing I'll give you the
[1:58:50] gift of Prophecy or I'll make you a
[1:58:52] prophet or any of those the fine Gifts
[1:58:55] of Faith uh he says any of the gifts
[1:58:58] that's in the Bible I'll give them every
[1:58:59] one to you but then I will withhold love
[1:59:02] from you or either I'll give you love
[1:59:05] and withhold the gift from you I'd say
[1:59:07] Lord take all the gifts and let me have
[1:59:09] the love for no matter what how many
[1:59:12] gifts we've got they will never do us
[1:59:14] any good except the love of God is the
[1:59:16] motive behind the gift we must everybody
[1:59:19] say we must we must have love can you
[1:59:24] say Amen we must and this love must be
[1:59:28] divine love which can only come from him
[1:59:32] amen that's good what was the motive
[1:59:35] behind Jesus preaching the gospel to the
[1:59:37] poor Divine love that's right what was
[1:59:41] the motive his motive of praying for the
[1:59:43] sick Divine love can you say amen amen
[1:59:48] what was his motive of healing the
[1:59:50] Brokenhearted Divine love
[1:59:52] amen see so we find what the motive
[1:59:57] behind him preaching the acceptable year
[1:59:59] of the Lord thinking of this church you
[2:00:02] can preach you can be free you can be
[2:00:05] free but if Divine love ain't behind
[2:00:07] that if it ain't the motive it it does
[2:00:10] us no
[2:00:11] good but when Jesus preached that
[2:00:14] acceptable year of the Lord there was
[2:00:16] divine love behind
[2:00:17] it amen
[2:00:20] amen he wasn't judg in his ministry by
[2:00:23] how good he preached he wasn't judg in
[2:00:24] his ministry by how well the people
[2:00:26] accepted
[2:00:28] him he wasn't judg in his ministry by
[2:00:31] whether they understood or not
[2:00:32] understood
[2:00:33] him it was just by Divine love he had to
[2:00:36] help them somehow amen and divine love
[2:00:40] caused him not to compromise with the
[2:00:43] word of
[2:00:44] God can you amen everything that he did
[2:00:48] was so that the people could be free and
[2:00:50] be delivered
[2:00:52] see you we have to understand it's
[2:00:55] divine
[2:00:56] love is what breaks the power of Satan
[2:01:00] upon people's lives it's not how good we
[2:01:04] preach it's not how well we
[2:01:06] sing it's not how well we play the
[2:01:10] music it's not how well we dress it's
[2:01:13] just Divine
[2:01:14] love can you say
[2:01:16] Amen you see brother brandham said when
[2:01:19] love is put him in in its place it'll
[2:01:23] defeat any enemy there is on the Earth
[2:01:26] or in
[2:01:28] torment brother bradam used the
[2:01:30] different examples like the
[2:01:32] bull that come to attack
[2:01:35] him and he said now please don't take
[2:01:38] this as juvenile but something happened
[2:01:42] now notice he said I wish it would
[2:01:44] happen right
[2:01:45] now always in those cases that something
[2:01:48] happens instead of hating that bull
[2:01:50] there was something I sympathized with
[2:01:53] him I loved him and I was no more afraid
[2:01:57] of that animal than I was I am standing
[2:01:59] here with my brotherr and all fear had
[2:02:02] left can you say man what a love
[2:02:06] right and I thought you poor creature
[2:02:09] I'm on your territory you're an animal
[2:02:11] you don't know any different that's the
[2:02:13] only thing you know is protect your
[2:02:16] rights and I said to this bull in these
[2:02:18] words oh creature of God I am God's
[2:02:21] servant
[2:02:22] and I'm on my way to pray for my sick
[2:02:24] brother I'm sorry I Disturbed you now
[2:02:25] notice a prophet apologizing to an
[2:02:28] animal we can't even apologize to one
[2:02:32] another but here he is under Divine love
[2:02:36] and he's apologizing to an
[2:02:38] animal and he said I'm sorry I Disturbed
[2:02:41] you but in Jesus name go lay down and he
[2:02:45] threw his horns in the ground throwing
[2:02:47] the dirt he fell to his knees and threw
[2:02:49] the dirt again and I stood stood there
[2:02:52] just as calm as I am now and he rushed
[2:02:55] towards me just as hard as he could come
[2:02:57] in a charge but I just stood there for I
[2:03:00] wasn't afraid and when he had gotten
[2:03:02] about 5et of me he threw his big feet
[2:03:06] out like that and stopped and he looked
[2:03:08] this way and that way so depleted and
[2:03:10] turned around and went over and laid
[2:03:12] down he said and I passed within 5et of
[2:03:15] him and he never moved no more what was
[2:03:18] it Divine love it had subdued a Wild
[2:03:22] Heart a wild nature an animal nature
[2:03:26] ain't that right the maniac that
[2:03:28] intended to kill brother brandham
[2:03:30] brother Bram said when that Maniac at up
[2:03:33] at Oregon when he ran to the platform to
[2:03:35] kill me he said something happened there
[2:03:38] you've often wondered I guess how those
[2:03:40] things happen it's something in the stad
[2:03:43] of despising that man though he was
[2:03:45] there to take my life a Divine love a
[2:03:48] Divine Law set in for him and he called
[2:03:51] me a hypocrite a snake in the grass and
[2:03:54] thousands of people sitting there and
[2:03:55] spit in my face and and Drew back his
[2:03:58] fist and said I'll break every bone in
[2:04:01] your body people probably sitting here
[2:04:03] was there he said but instead of
[2:04:06] despising the man Grace came in in a
[2:04:10] moment when I needed it how many needs
[2:04:13] it
[2:04:16] amen Grace sets in and projected Divine
[2:04:20] love into my heart that I could project
[2:04:22] to him and I thought there stands a man
[2:04:24] like I am he likes to eat drink and his
[2:04:29] family but the devil has him so bound
[2:04:33] you see if we could realize that it's
[2:04:35] not the human it's the devil that has
[2:04:39] people
[2:04:41] bound it's the devil that causes people
[2:04:44] to where they can't believe it's the
[2:04:46] devil that gets them so tore up it's the
[2:04:48] devil that causes
[2:04:50] misunderstandings it's the devil that
[2:04:52] tries to separate Brotherhood it's it's
[2:04:54] the devil and so many times we're
[2:04:57] looking at the
[2:04:58] individual instead of what's causing
[2:05:01] it true but there he was and he says oh
[2:05:05] my says that the
[2:05:06] devil has him so bound and so the love
[2:05:09] of God constrained me and the man
[2:05:12] humbled himself and fell across my feet
[2:05:15] Grace stepped in When Love Was
[2:05:18] projected another place he says I didn't
[2:05:21] hate the man I loved him I felt sorry
[2:05:24] for him that's what slew him on the
[2:05:27] platform that's what slew those witch
[2:05:29] doctors standing there that day human
[2:05:31] beings that God died for standing there
[2:05:33] trying to throw spells on me witches
[2:05:35] like that and standing there before him
[2:05:38] him and you see them fall to the ground
[2:05:41] throw their head down like this and give
[2:05:43] their hearts to Christ it was love that
[2:05:45] did it love everybody say love is the
[2:05:48] mightiest Force there is
[2:05:52] you believe it love is the mightiest
[2:05:55] Force see what is it it's an exotic love
[2:05:58] it's something that is foreign to the
[2:06:00] human
[2:06:02] being but it it it's not something that
[2:06:05] that that can't come to the human being
[2:06:07] because we just saw it it wasn't just
[2:06:10] Jesus now there was a man that that was
[2:06:14] redeemed that was born a sinner now
[2:06:17] redeemed and the love of God could
[2:06:18] reflect and subdue a bull it could
[2:06:21] subdue a
[2:06:23] maniac it could subdue Hornets can you
[2:06:26] say Amen on and on and on it it could
[2:06:30] brother Bram talking about the Hornets I
[2:06:32] know I've kept you long please forgive
[2:06:34] me but he says now anyone knows what a
[2:06:36] hornet is he'll kill you one Hornet can
[2:06:39] flatten you on the ground and me with no
[2:06:40] shirt on and I was standing there and
[2:06:42] something happened I don't know what it
[2:06:43] is it's just something that happens it's
[2:06:46] love instead of hating those Hornets I
[2:06:50] thought poor little creatures of God
[2:06:53] well I have nothing again you that's
[2:06:55] your home and I Disturbed you sounds
[2:06:57] like a child but the trouble it is we
[2:07:00] try to be grown-ups when we ought to be
[2:07:02] children we just we we take things just
[2:07:05] as we're so intelligent we'd happen to
[2:07:08] measure our intelligence with God's
[2:07:10] grace one time I wonder where it would
[2:07:12] come up but in this these Hornets was
[2:07:14] all over me and I wasn't afraid of the
[2:07:16] little creatures I said little creatures
[2:07:18] go back into your nest I'll not harm you
[2:07:21] and as God Lives them Hornets world
[2:07:23] around me three or four times and went
[2:07:25] straight back to their nest can you say
[2:07:28] Amen brother Branham and I'll Clos but
[2:07:30] brother brandham talking about the blind
[2:07:33] man that came in the prayer line he said
[2:07:35] the old man as he stood there I began to
[2:07:38] feel sorry for him I looked at his old
[2:07:40] ragged coat I put my shoulders up the
[2:07:42] side of his to see if my coat would fit
[2:07:45] him I looked at his feet no shoes on
[2:07:47] great calluses on his feet Dusty all the
[2:07:50] way up as far as you could where his
[2:07:52] ragged trouser uh uh uh leg my shoe
[2:07:56] wasn't nothing like big enough for him
[2:07:58] and I began to look and I thought this
[2:08:00] that poor old man maybe had never had a
[2:08:02] good meal in all of his life see the
[2:08:05] economics of Mexico are very poor The
[2:08:08] Brick Mason gets about eight pesos a day
[2:08:11] and it takes about four days good hard
[2:08:13] labor to buy himself a pair of shoes
[2:08:16] that's uh uh Poncho Frank and what does
[2:08:19] Pedro do working for about two pesos
[2:08:23] with six or eight children to raise it's
[2:08:25] terrible and I thought after all of that
[2:08:27] and then nature the devil has given him
[2:08:29] evil to Blind this his poor old blinded
[2:08:33] eyes how cruel it was to him and I began
[2:08:36] to enter into something I can't express
[2:08:40] it it was a love of sympathy and as the
[2:08:44] old fella come and laid his head on over
[2:08:46] on my shoulders and I hugged that old
[2:08:48] ragged coat and I said Lord be be
[2:08:51] merciful God please help this poor old
[2:08:54] blind daddy if my dad would have lived
[2:08:56] he had been about that age will you help
[2:08:58] him and I heard him hollering glory
[2:09:02] and the man could see as good as I
[2:09:05] could the people began screaming
[2:09:07] everywhere what was it it was entering
[2:09:09] into that Fellowship of his suffering
[2:09:12] and his blindness you must do it can you
[2:09:15] sayen what this tells us church is we
[2:09:18] cannot defeat demons without divine
[2:09:24] love we need Divine love can you say
[2:09:27] man it's
[2:09:29] interesting how that Satan is able to
[2:09:32] gain access when Divine love is not
[2:09:34] there look at the homes that are broken
[2:09:37] brother Brandon preached the invasion of
[2:09:39] the United
[2:09:41] States but he also tells us that love
[2:09:43] was waning love was going love was
[2:09:47] leaving and when love is not in the home
[2:09:50] the devil's able to gain access and
[2:09:52] break up that home look at the marriages
[2:09:55] that are broken today because there is
[2:09:57] no love the nation is broken because
[2:10:00] there is no love churches are divided
[2:10:03] because there is no love ministers fight
[2:10:06] behind their pulpits because there is no
[2:10:08] love can you Amen brother bradam said
[2:10:11] see look at the divorce courts between
[2:10:14] husband and wife look at the juvenile
[2:10:16] delinquency look at the homes break and
[2:10:18] everything No Love No Love and and now
[2:10:21] the only time that you even know your
[2:10:23] neighbor's dead is when you read it in
[2:10:25] the paper that's about right he said see
[2:10:27] we don't know about one another anymore
[2:10:30] because there's no love no more can you
[2:10:32] say Amen but see God is love and all
[2:10:37] that God is he poured into
[2:10:39] Christ and he became love he became the
[2:10:42] expression of love to the world and all
[2:10:45] that Christ is he poured into the
[2:10:48] church can you say Amen you love him if
[2:10:52] the musicians will
[2:10:57] come and that is the mystery that Paul
[2:11:00] spoke
[2:11:02] of about the church it's Christ in you
[2:11:07] the hope of
[2:11:09] glory it's something that is
[2:11:11] exotic but yet we
[2:11:14] hold it's something that is foreign to
[2:11:17] the human
[2:11:19] heart but we as his r deemed Made In His
[2:11:23] Image after his
[2:11:25] kind lord it's not a human love that we
[2:11:28] operate through its Divine love the very

[2:13:24] let himself become
[2:13:26] indifferent couldn't let himself become
[2:13:32] selfish he had to keep himself available
[2:13:35] and yielded that the father could use
[2:13:38] him not only just use him to speak not
[2:13:41] only just use him to have a Ministry and
[2:13:43] to lay hands on the sick and have
