[28:07] craziness but uh I tell you what we have
[28:09] a promise we're leaving this place amen
[28:14] and uh so I'm so so looking forward to
[28:17] that and it's uh certainly good to just
[28:20] see everyone house of the Lord good to
[28:23] be back amen and um heard y'all had just
[28:27] a good service uh there uh uh Sunday and
[28:32] uh so we thankful to the Lord for that
[28:36] and uh the Lord seemed to move there uh
[28:41] in the services where we were and so
[28:43] just appreciate your
[28:45] prayers and um um also before I forget
[28:50] uh brother bro uh asked me to just thank
[28:54] everyone uh those that have called and
[28:58] checked on them and all the prayers that
[29:00] have been prayed for him and uh the boys
[29:04] and we want to just continue praying for
[29:07] them and uh he's got a long road uh
[29:10] ahead of him of
[29:11] recovery and uh you know just um I'm
[29:16] sure there's a lot of worry there with
[29:18] him being off of work and you know and
[29:22] and things like that and uh probably you
[29:24] know I I don't know even how long he's
[29:27] got before he'd be able to work and
[29:29] again but kind of messed him up um think
[29:33] broke eight ribs broke his pelvis and
[29:36] then his leg and so he's he's got a
[29:39] little ways to go but you know God can
[29:42] help him God can help him uh just heal
[29:46] and uh fast so we we we want to just
[29:48] keep them in our prayer and uh um I know
[29:54] the Lord is is certainly good and uh was
[29:57] good to them and uh is with them praise
[30:00] the Lord and uh so anyways uh we're
[30:04] really glad to have uh our visitors uh
[30:08] Sister Mariah and brother Andrew and
[30:12] uh uh and uh you know uh uh you know
[30:17] that's the Lord's just uh has blessed
[30:20] them and uh he's on demand you know uh
[30:25] traveling all around and and uh so I
[30:28] know it's got to be tiring for them and
[30:31] a lot of uh young preachers thinks
[30:33] that's it's a lucrative thing to be able
[30:36] to travel but uh it's not uh when you're
[30:40] evangelizing and you're out uh church
[30:43] service after church service and
[30:46] preaching and you know you're packing
[30:48] and unpacking packing and unpacking and
[30:52] just uh there's a lot to it but we
[30:54] certainly appreciate uh uh brother
[30:57] Andrew for giv uh his uh life to the

[36:26] way but as you came Lord and helped me
[36:29] to get myself out of the way and you
[36:30] spoke to your children and broke the
[36:32] bread of life and we'll be sure to give
[36:34] you all the praise all the honor and all
[36:36] the glory in the wonderful name of our
[36:38] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and
[36:42] all the believer says amen and amen The
[36:45] Book of Romans the 10th chapter and then
[36:48] the 11th verse Paul here writing says
[36:51] for the scripture saith whosoever
[36:54] believeth on him shall not be ashamed
[36:56] named for there is no difference between
[36:59] the Jew and the Greek for the same Lord
[37:01] over all is Rich unto all that call upon
[37:05] him for whosoever shall call upon the
[37:07] name of the Lord shall be saved how then
[37:11] shall they call on him and whom they
[37:13] have not believed and how shall they
[37:15] believe in him of whom they have not
[37:17] heard and how shall they hear without a
[37:19] preacher and how shall they preach
[37:22] except they be sent as it is written how
[37:24] beautiful are the feet of them that
[37:26] preach preach the gospel of peace bring
[37:28] Glad Tidings of good things but they
[37:30] have not all obeyed the gospel now watch
[37:33] here for Isaiah sayth Lord who hath
[37:36] believed I report so then Faith cometh
[37:39] by hearing and hearing by the word of
[37:42] God now I love how brother Bram
[37:44] interprets that he says hearing by the
[37:46] word of God made manifest so we're not
[37:49] just hearing about the word but we're
[37:51] actually hearing about that word being
[37:53] made manifest now in The Book of Mark
[37:55] the 11th chapter
[37:57] I know you all uh know these verses by
[37:59] heart in Mark 11 and verse 22 I actually
[38:03] today had something toally different uh
[38:05] on my heart and a direction to go and
[38:07] this afternoon about 4:00 the Lord just
[38:10] stopped by my little study there and
[38:12] changed it so we just follow him tonight
[38:14] in Mark 11 and verse
[38:17] 22 Jesus here speaking he says have
[38:21] faith in God for verily I say unto you
[38:25] that whosoever shall say unto this
[38:27] mountain be thou removed and be thou
[38:30] cast into the sea now watch this and
[38:33] shall not doubt in his heart notice not
[38:36] shall not doubt in his head but shall
[38:39] not doubt in his heart but shall believe
[38:42] that those things which he saith shall
[38:44] come to pass he shall have whatsoever he
[38:47] saith now therefore I say unto you what
[38:50] things soever you desire When you pray
[38:53] believe that you receive them and ye
[38:56] shall have them can we say that last
[38:59] line together and ye shall have them we
[39:03] ask Lord this evening to bless the
[39:04] reading of his word as you can be seated
[39:06] here this afternoon I want to by the
[39:08] help of the Lord maybe just to continue
[39:11] uh with you on the thought that we were
[39:12] speaking on last time we spoke to you on
[39:14] faith cometh by hearing but I want to
[39:16] take a little something out of that
[39:17] tonight and maybe a subtitle of Faith
[39:20] from the innermost Faith from the
[39:23] innermost brother Bram says here in 1957
[39:26] he says until something comes down on
[39:28] the inside of you to just say it so he
[39:31] said that's all there is to it he said
[39:34] then there's not enough demons out of
[39:36] Torment that could ever shake you from
[39:37] it it's something on the inside called
[39:40] the heart he said that's where real
[39:43] Faith Finds Its resting place amen so
[39:46] the faith of God has got to dwell in the
[39:48] heart of a Believer and another place in
[39:51] have faith in God 58 he said if you got
[39:53] real faith in your heart he said that
[39:55] God's going to keep his word all the
[39:57] hurts and aches and pains and shadows
[40:00] will not amount to anything amen if you
[40:03] believe it in your heart it's yours and
[40:05] there's nothing somebody say nothing
[40:07] amen there's nothing can take it away
[40:09] from you it's yours it's a gift that God
[40:12] has given you he said it's the Blessed
[40:14] assurance that what you ask for he is
[40:17] able to perform it because he promised
[40:19] it that's real Faith now amen as
[40:22] Believers tonight we're not just
[40:23] Desiring intellectual Faith or emotional
[40:26] Faith amen but there's something in the
[40:28] heart of a son and daughter of God Amen
[40:30] that is Desiring real Faith now the last
[40:33] time we were speaking to you on this we
[40:35] were looking very heavily in the Book of
[40:37] Luke the 8th chapter where the Bible
[40:38] tells the parable of the swer amen who
[40:41] went forth sewing his seed and the Bible
[40:43] says there amen that that seed is the
[40:45] word of God and we found that that seed
[40:48] actually falls into four different types
[40:50] of ground and when Jesus himself begin
[40:52] to interpret that Parable he will
[40:55] actually show us that those four types
[40:56] of ground were actually hears now if you
[40:59] all remember there was the indifferent
[41:01] here there was the emotional here there
[41:03] was the worldly hair amen but then amen
[41:05] there was the receptive here which was a
[41:08] type of the good ground amen which an
[41:11] honest heart has heard and receives the
[41:13] word of faith amen and when that word
[41:15] falls into good ground amen that word is
[41:18] going to produce the promise of the word
[41:21] that it's fallen into amen if it's an
[41:23] apple tree it's going to bring forth
[41:25] apples if it's an orange tree it's going
[41:27] to bring forth oranges then if it's a
[41:29] promise for salvation it's going to
[41:30] bring forth salvation if it's a promise
[41:33] for healing it's going to bring forth
[41:34] healing amen and we left off looking at
[41:37] how amen that those receptive hearers
[41:40] actually have amen a teachable spirit on
[41:43] the inside of them now in the book of
[41:45] Hebrews 11th chapter and the first verse
[41:48] I know you know this scripture by heart
[41:50] amen but Paul here says now that Faith
[41:53] amen is the substance of things hoped
[41:55] for amen it's the evidence of Things Not
[41:57] Seen he said for by it the elders
[42:00] obtained a good report and through faith
[42:03] we understand that the worlds were
[42:05] framed by the word of God so that the
[42:07] things which are seen amen were not made
[42:10] of things which do appear brother B
[42:12] preaches a message 1955 and he calls it
[42:15] the power of God and he asks this
[42:17] question he says what is Faith amen what
[42:20] is Faith he said is God by the spirit
[42:23] amen revealing to you something that
[42:25] he's going to do or that he's promised
[42:27] so Faith amen is not just a feeling it's
[42:30] not just a sensation amen but faith is a
[42:34] revelation from almighty God Amen that
[42:37] is revealed to you of something he's
[42:39] going to do amen or something that he
[42:41] has promised now amen if you only hear
[42:44] he said Faith cometh by hearing amen but
[42:46] hearing is not Faith Now Catch This amen
[42:49] Faith cometh by hearing amen but hearing
[42:52] is not Faith he said a loaf of bread
[42:55] amen is the purchase just for 25 cents
[42:57] amen but the 25 cents is not the loaf of
[43:00] bread see amen hearing only brings the
[43:03] word that produces the faith amen so
[43:06] hearing brings the word into your heart
[43:09] amen that produces the faith to bring
[43:11] the promise of the word to pass amen
[43:13] faith is the substance of things hoped
[43:15] for amen it's the evidence of Things Not
[43:18] Seen he said then you see you hear the
[43:20] word amen then God reveals it to you
[43:23] that it is the truth amen and by the
[43:26] spirit revealed truth confirms your
[43:28] faith to God that's a mouthful Church
[43:31] you see amen you hear the word god
[43:34] reveals it to you then it is the truth
[43:36] and by the spirit revealed truth he
[43:39] confirms your faith to God he said
[43:42] that's the church that God built upon
[43:44] the rock amen that the Gates of Hell
[43:47] cannot Prevail against it amen then that
[43:50] tells me that Faith amen has got a power
[43:53] behind it and the prophet said Faith's
[43:55] power is to to bring to pass amen God's
[43:58] revealed Revelation that's why the devil
[44:01] does not want F Amen to move Beyond
[44:03] intellectual Faith he does not want this
[44:05] to move amen Beyond head knowledge
[44:08] because when it becomes Revelation you
[44:11] will move from being able to be defeated
[44:13] into being an invincible Army listen
[44:16] with just intellectualism the devil will
[44:18] defeat us with just head knowledge amen
[44:20] the devil will defeat us but let me put
[44:23] my voice with Jesus who said on this
[44:25] rock
[44:26] I will build my church and the Gates of
[44:29] Hell will never Prevail against it I
[44:31] tell you tonight I believe we're a part
[44:33] of that church amen that has been
[44:35] founded upon a rock of Revelation amen
[44:38] we can testify tonight that storms have
[44:40] come but we're still standing amen amen
[44:43] situations have come but we're still
[44:45] here amen because something has dropped
[44:48] in our hearts which is Faith now in
[44:50] Romans the 10th chapter Paul there is
[44:52] speaking to the Romans which they had
[44:54] been heathens which were Idol
[44:56] amen and they had just come over into
[44:59] Christianity Amen brother said watch and
[45:01] Faith cometh by hearing he said Paul
[45:03] sending this letter to the Romans amen
[45:05] getting the church in order amen he's
[45:08] speaking to them about faith in the
[45:10] fourth chapter of Romans he speaks of
[45:12] Abraham amen being justified by faith in
[45:16] in ninth chapter of Romans he speaks on
[45:18] the election of God how that God called
[45:20] Jacob and ordained them and he said by
[45:23] election he chose by his own choosing
[45:26] amen chose Jacob instead of Esau amen
[45:28] though Esau being rightly to the
[45:30] birthrights he chose Jacob instead of
[45:33] Esau amen so here we find amen that
[45:36] Abraham was justified by
[45:38] faith here we find that election is done
[45:42] by faith when Paul comes to the 10th
[45:44] chapter here re said now we find him
[45:46] dividing what faith is amen so the
[45:49] fourth chapter Abraham justified by
[45:51] faith ninth chapter Jacob chosen over
[45:54] Esau by faith election faith amen the
[45:56] 10th chapter he's going to divide what
[45:59] faith is now do you all know amen that
[46:01] we're living in a generation of a Joshua
[46:04] Ministry amen where Moses brought him
[46:06] out of Egypt amen but Joshua took him
[46:09] into the land and sister Jane Joshua
[46:11] positionally plac them amen in their
[46:14] inheritance of what belonged to them and
[46:16] here is a Joshua Ministry amen that's
[46:19] not just bringing the church out of
[46:21] confusion but he's bringing them into a
[46:23] position of Faith amen by the the word
[46:26] of God he said now Faith is Burly he
[46:29] said my how I like to think of Faith
[46:31] amen hope faith and charity those three
[46:33] things amen hope what a beautiful thing
[46:35] hope is he said little timid hope lovely
[46:38] sweet as she is amen yet she's the
[46:40] greatest enemy that faith has amen the
[46:43] greatest enemy faith is got is Hope
[46:46] because a person becomes so hopeful amen
[46:49] till they leave away from Faith he said
[46:51] now watch hope will agree with the Bible
[46:54] amen hope will say it's true hope hope
[46:55] will say I believe every bit of it I
[46:58] believe that it's the word of God I
[46:59] believe that God will keep his promised
[47:01] amen hope believes all that amen but
[47:04] then hope says now I believe God will
[47:06] heal amen but look at my condition amen
[47:09] so in other words hope believes it as
[47:11] long as its way out there amen but when
[47:14] it comes to you personally then hope
[47:16] becomes timid and backs up and says but
[47:18] your conditions this and your diagnosis
[47:21] is this and your problem is this amen
[47:23] but the prophet said faith is not t
[47:26] amen faith is Burly he said as I once
[47:28] said faith has hair on the chest and
[47:31] when it stands up it pulls its big
[47:32] muscles out and everything else vanishes
[47:35] away amen When Faith really takes a hold
[47:38] nothing else stands now I love the way
[47:41] the prophet breaks this down he said if
[47:43] you just rely on Hope amen then You
[47:46] Hinder faith if you just rely on Hope
[47:49] amen then You Hinder Faith amen because
[47:51] hope looks for something way off amen
[47:54] but Faith claims it right now how many
[47:56] how many say on this Wednesday night I
[47:58] just need a faith claiming service amen
[48:01] it's not out in the future it's not
[48:03] coming it's not going to be amen but
[48:05] there's something in the innermost part
[48:07] of my soul amen that declares it's not
[48:09] in the future and it's not in the past
[48:12] amen but I'm going to call Healing right
[48:14] now I'm going to call Deliverance right
[48:16] now I'm going to call for a Revival and
[48:19] a refreshing from the presence of God
[48:21] right now amen it's not tomorrow it's
[48:24] not next meeting it's not next
[48:25] convention it's right now see amen that
[48:28] settles it I don't care if I'm still
[48:30] crippled if I'm still blind if I'm still
[48:33] sick that don't have nothing to do with
[48:35] it amen it's mine right now and as long
[48:38] as Satan can put you off to another day
[48:41] that's as good as he wants amen but
[48:44] Faith acts now well somebody say Amen
[48:48] Faith acts now and faith is
[48:52] positive there's nothing negative in
[48:54] faith faith is positive he said oh my
[48:58] When Faith speaks everybody else keeps
[49:00] still amen that's right so we find then
[49:03] amen that Faith cometh by hearing amen
[49:06] and hearing of the word of God now there
[49:08] is a connection amen between Bible
[49:10] teaching and Bible Faith the prophet of
[49:13] God said in adoption part one he said
[49:15] Bible teaching is usually a little
[49:17] treacherous amen it's kind of like
[49:18] walking on thin I amen but we just feel
[49:21] that maybe at this point and at this
[49:23] time it might be good to kind of bring
[49:25] the church to what I think to a complete
[49:29] understanding amen positionally of what
[49:31] we are in Christ Jesus and sometimes
[49:34] preaching is wonderful amen teaching
[49:36] goes beyond that especially to the
[49:38] church he said preaching catches The
[49:41] Sinner and brings him under condemnation
[49:44] by the word amen but teaching places a
[49:47] man positionally what he is and we can
[49:50] never rightly be able to have faith
[49:52] until positionally we know what we are
[49:55] amen then this message is not just a
[49:58] message Amen to set us up on the
[50:00] Mountaintop and keep us up on the
[50:02] mountain amen the fruit of freeze upon
[50:04] on the mountain amen but this message
[50:06] has the power Amen to take us from the
[50:09] mountain to the valley and we'll still
[50:11] believe God in the valley amen the same
[50:14] way we would on the Mountaintop this
[50:16] message has the ability to teach us how
[50:18] to be Christians in our trials and how
[50:20] to be Christians in our victories it
[50:22] teaches us how to be Christians in
[50:24] sickness and to be Christians in health
[50:27] I'm not preaching some little Baptist
[50:29] idea I'm preaching the faith of God that
[50:31] has been sent into this age by the voice
[50:33] of Malachi 4 to bring a church to a
[50:36] position of authority over every devil
[50:39] every spirit and you know who you
[50:42] are I tell you that's a powerful
[50:45] Revelation Church amen that you don't
[50:47] just know who you are when things are
[50:48] going good and you don't just know who
[50:51] you are when things are happy but you
[50:53] know who you are when the wind is
[50:54] blowing and the rain is falling and the
[50:57] devil is howling and Spirits are all
[50:59] around you there is something in the
[51:01] innermost part of a Christian that can
[51:03] say though he slays me yet I will trust
[51:06] him amen if God give you the gift of the
[51:09] Holy Ghost well the word of God is a
[51:11] conductor to use that power with he said
[51:14] whatever the Holy Ghost promised you
[51:16] that's what you can do see whatever the
[51:19] Holy Ghost promised you that's what you
[51:21] can do then the Bible teaching was
[51:24] coming not from just a prophet it was
[51:27] coming from the spirit he said that's
[51:29] the thing that delivers the word amen is
[51:32] the word goes right out and the Holy
[51:34] Spirit follows the word you see your
[51:37] pastor preaching and the first thing you
[51:39] know it but makes a blowing sound he
[51:42] said across the building goes the Holy
[51:44] Ghost that's right amen it's the
[51:46] conductor of the word then listen church
[51:49] when you feel the inspiration of the
[51:51] Holy Spirit that's not just a cold chill
[51:54] coming through the room that's not just
[51:56] a preacher trying to work you up amen
[51:58] but it is a wind of the holy spirit that
[52:01] is following the words you're being
[52:02] taught and that spirit is bringing the
[52:05] word to you position it in your
[52:08] heart now the prophet said the word is
[52:10] the conductor right of the spirit he
[52:13] said because where the word is preached
[52:15] amen the spirit follows it wherever it
[52:18] goes why the spirit follows the word I
[52:20] like that I like sound Bible teaching
[52:23] and the Bible Holy Ghost coming back
[52:26] amen confirming Bible teaching let me
[52:29] say this Bible teaching is not Church
[52:31] teaching Bible teaching is not
[52:33] denominational teaching he said you know
[52:35] I believe if he would come tonight it
[52:37] would be all together different than
[52:39] what we've got figured out he will come
[52:41] he always seems to do it but yet it's
[52:43] straight with the scripture amen see
[52:45] they was expecting him coming in his
[52:47] second coming his great power amen which
[52:49] then he come for them and for us but we
[52:51] know in his first coming amen he was to
[52:53] come lowly riding on the mule amen
[52:56] coming in the city how that even his
[52:58] disciples amen didn't understand it now
[53:01] listen to the prophet and how it is
[53:03] tonight that sometimes amen things
[53:06] happen and if it doesn't equal up to
[53:08] what our church teaches then we want to
[53:10] throw it out and say there's nothing to
[53:12] it I'm just going to take the Liberty to
[53:14] preach here amen cuz we've come to an
[53:16] age where things are being taught amen
[53:18] that don't equal up with a message amen
[53:20] but people still feel a pressure to
[53:22] follow it amen because of the person
[53:24] who's teaching it amen I don't care what
[53:26] the man's name is I don't care what
[53:28] church is representing amen if you hear
[53:30] anything contrary to what the seventh
[53:33] angel has t you throw it out the window
[53:36] and you stay with the message of the
[53:37] hour it's the only thing that'll bring
[53:39] you to a stability it's the only thing
[53:42] that'll bring you across the mountain
[53:44] and through the valley is the message of
[53:46] the hour and that message is not
[53:48] something to water down and dilute and
[53:50] put intellectualism with it amen if it's
[53:53] not in the message For Heaven's Sake
[53:55] four an alpha window and somebody say
[53:57] what a prophet
[53:59] said and Ne oh my here I am and neither
[54:02] am I going to get bogged down and
[54:04] dissecting this message on what should
[54:06] be said how it should be said when it
[54:08] should be said who should say Amen
[54:10] either we believe this message or let's
[54:12] close the doors and go be a Baptist
[54:15] somewhere amen I say if a prophet stood
[54:17] with it we ought to stand with it and
[54:19] contrary to what some people believe a
[54:21] prophet stood with this picture he stood
[54:23] in a pull pit with this picture behind
[54:26] him and he testified it was a scientific
[54:29] proof of a supernatural visitation
[54:31] listen if a prophet wasn't ashamed of it
[54:33] you better believe I'm not ashamed to
[54:36] stand with a Joshua Ministry that is
[54:38] coming to this age to positionally place
[54:41] me in the faith of Jesus Christ we will
[54:43] not back up we will not lay down we have
[54:46] been called to the faith of God and it's
[54:49] positioned Us in the word of God
[54:52] anything contrary to what the word
[54:54] teaches thr it
[54:55] out throw it out get rid of it and stand
[55:00] with a prophet you know the thing we
[55:02] ought to do sensibly is to look at it in
[55:04] the light of the scripture now I believe
[55:06] that every Bible teaching or every
[55:08] church every Revelation must be built on
[55:10] this word and if anybody teaches
[55:13] anything contrary to the word I wouldn't
[55:16] believe it how much more pler could it
[55:19] be said if anybody teaches anything
[55:23] contrary to the word
[55:25] am I wouldn't believe it see this Bible
[55:29] is God's foundation and there's no other
[55:32] Foundation can be laid but that which is
[55:35] already laid in Christ Jesus I love
[55:37] another place if whole Bible teaching
[55:39] and preaching don't make you sick then
[55:41] it don't do you no good see it's got to
[55:44] stir up your spiritual gastronomics
[55:46] another place there's many people who
[55:48] get prayed for and they'll go through a
[55:50] prayer line with a crippled hand and a
[55:52] crippled foot and a sick stomach and the
[55:54] next morning and get up and say I'm just
[55:56] as sick as I was he said what you need
[55:59] is some good Bible teaching then do you
[56:01] see that's what was separating William
[56:04] Brandon from AA Allen and Oral Roberts
[56:06] and Jack Cole amen as they was all
[56:08] hollering healing amen but a prophet was
[56:11] standing there and he was laboring in
[56:13] the word to establish a foundation for
[56:16] healing to come upon that's why they
[56:19] could go through all Robert's prayer
[56:20] line and come back the next night and
[56:22] say nothing has changed but they could
[56:24] go through William brandom's prayer line
[56:26] and he could say you're healed of that
[56:28] Gorder you're healed of that stomach
[56:29] trouble and go home in the same
[56:32] condition that they went through the
[56:33] prayer line in but two weeks later the
[56:35] Gorder disappear and the stomach trouble
[56:38] resolved amen because a prophet was not
[56:40] building him up on the mountain without
[56:42] giving him a sure place to stand when
[56:45] the devil come against him I know it's
[56:47] Wednesday night but I got to preach I
[56:49] say thank God for this message that has
[56:51] give us a rock to stand on when the
[56:53] Devil Comes against us on Monday and
[56:55] comes against us on Tuesday we can stand
[56:57] on the rock of Revelation and say you're
[57:00] too late devil it's already dropped in
[57:02] the innermost part of my soul I'm Healed
[57:05] I'm saved I'm Justified I'm forgiven I'm
[57:08] redeemed I'm Rapture Ready I'm glorified
[57:11] I'm
[57:13] perfected listen a prophet give you
[57:15] somewhere to stand by teaching you the
[57:17] word of God Amen what you need is some
[57:19] good Bible teaching you don't look at
[57:21] the symptom you look at the word
[57:25] it's never watch this if you look at
[57:28] that you'll never get well now I know
[57:30] people say well teaching well the Bible
[57:32] tells us that in the beginning was the
[57:34] word right and the Word was with God and
[57:36] the Word was God and the Word was made
[57:39] flesh who was the first person let me
[57:41] say it like this who was John 1:14 he
[57:44] was none other than the Lord Jesus
[57:46] Christ then the Bible said that Jesus
[57:49] himself being the word took time to
[57:52] teach and preach in St Matthew 4:2 3 the
[57:55] Bible says that Jesus went about all
[57:57] Galilee amen teaching in their
[57:59] synagogues and preaching the gospel of
[58:01] the kingdom and healing all manner of
[58:03] sickness and all manner of disease among
[58:06] the people now don't tell me that I
[58:08] cannot identify that prophet in that
[58:11] scripture because that Prophet under
[58:14] that Pillar of Fire came with that
[58:16] continuation of ministry which was none
[58:18] other than the ministry of Jesus Christ
[58:21] and you got thousands of tapes and every
[58:24] one of them brother random teaches and
[58:26] he testifies and he preaches and then he
[58:28] says let's call the prayer line you know
[58:31] why because he was giv you a sure place
[58:33] to stand when the devil come against the
[58:35] word that you had heard to bring faith
[58:37] in your heart now I love what the Bible
[58:39] says the Bible says that Jesus amen
[58:41] taught in the temple in Luke the 5th
[58:44] chapter the first verse it came to pass
[58:47] amen that the people pressed upon Him
[58:49] Amen to hear the word of God brother
[58:52] Sean they literally pressed upon Him
[58:54] Amen to hear the word and he stood by
[58:56] the lake of Janar and believest thou
[58:58] this the prophet said the church today
[59:01] ought to be pressing everywhere Amen to
[59:03] hear the word of God now watch what he
[59:06] says staying with the word the church
[59:09] ought to be pressing everywhere to hear
[59:11] the word but not just hear it but stay
[59:14] with
[59:15] it I'm just going to preach I'm home
[59:18] amen just hear it but stay with it
[59:20] listen friends you can hear it but you
[59:22] got to stay with it the battle's not
[59:24] just hear it amen the battle is stained
[59:26] with it are you hearing me amen the
[59:29] battle is stained with the word when
[59:31] every other sense of your body is giving
[59:33] you reason to rebuke the word or to
[59:35] doubt the word amen but there's
[59:37] something on the inside of the inside oh
[59:41] my then there's something that will make
[59:43] you stay with the word when people walk
[59:45] away there's something will cause you to
[59:47] stand with this word amen when your
[59:49] friends deny this word amen what is it
[59:52] it's faith in the innermost now the
[59:54] Bible says in Amos 11 Spirit of Prophecy
[59:57] spoke and said there would be a famine
[59:59] right amen it would not be for bread or
[1:00:01] water but of hearing the word of the
[1:00:03] Lord re said there will come a famine in
[1:00:06] the land he said for the hearing of the
[1:00:07] word of God Amen the true word of God
[1:00:11] Amen I want you to catch something
[1:00:12] brother amamos it's not a famine for the
[1:00:14] word amen it's a famine for the hearing
[1:00:17] of the word listen Church there's plenty
[1:00:20] of word the seals have been tore off the
[1:00:23] Mysteries have been revealed the
[1:00:25] Revelation is in the church there's
[1:00:27] plenty of word amen but the famine has
[1:00:29] come amen for the hearing of what has
[1:00:32] been reveal I might as well go ahead and
[1:00:33] say it he said if that don't fit this
[1:00:36] nation at this time I don't know where
[1:00:38] it does fit he said see we got plenty of
[1:00:40] clothes nice homes everything but
[1:00:43] there's a famine of the hearing of the
[1:00:45] word of God he said a man won't know
[1:00:47] what to believe you're all confused one
[1:00:49] says this and one says that and one says
[1:00:53] this and one says something else amen
[1:00:55] but base your thoughts on thus saith the
[1:00:58] Lord and God will confirm it here is the
[1:01:02] secret the bride has the mind of Christ
[1:01:05] she has thus sayth the Lord or she will
[1:01:08] keep still now can I ask you something
[1:01:10] where do you keep secrets at amen if
[1:01:13] they're real Secrets brother Tim you
[1:01:15] keep them in the innermost part amen of
[1:01:17] your heart amen then this message did
[1:01:20] not come brother Bob to deal with our
[1:01:22] head it come to take the off of her
[1:01:25] heart and put the secrets of God in
[1:01:29] there can I read you this quote I pray
[1:01:31] you be merciful tonight he said May
[1:01:33] there not be a blind man here a blind
[1:01:35] woman but may there be some that's he
[1:01:37] said May there be some that's blind to
[1:01:39] your presence of you being here their
[1:01:41] souls are packed away with some sort of
[1:01:43] man-made theology in this great day you
[1:01:46] permitted it to be you said Lord they'll
[1:01:48] come a time when there won't be a famine
[1:01:50] for bread and water but of hearing the
[1:01:52] word of God and men would run to and fro
[1:01:54] seeking it now listen to the prophet and
[1:01:57] we've lived to see that
[1:01:59] day brother Terry I can read Amos 81 and
[1:02:02] say this day is this scripture fulfilled
[1:02:06] we've lived to see that day when one
[1:02:08] says this way and one says that way now
[1:02:11] are you hearing me we're we've come back
[1:02:13] to it I hate to say it but we've come
[1:02:15] back to it where one preacher says this
[1:02:17] way and another preacher says that way
[1:02:19] and a teacher says this way and a pastor
[1:02:22] says this way amen but could we just
[1:02:24] come back to what the prophet said he
[1:02:26] said but we're thankful Lord that you
[1:02:28] said I am the way amen then we're not
[1:02:31] looking for a preacher to point us this
[1:02:33] way brother junior or a teacher to point
[1:02:35] us that way amen we're listening to the
[1:02:37] sound of the word of the Lord Jesus when
[1:02:40] he said I am the way and if you are the
[1:02:42] way then your present tense here now to
[1:02:45] prove you are the way in other words
[1:02:48] this message is the way to Rapture this
[1:02:51] message is the way to body change this
[1:02:53] message is is the way to the Future home
[1:02:56] it's the way to the New Jerusalem it's
[1:02:58] the way to the resurrection amen and if
[1:03:00] a man says go that way you'll miss it
[1:03:02] and if a man says go this way you'll
[1:03:04] miss it but if you'll stay with a
[1:03:06] message which is Christ amen it'll bring
[1:03:08] you to a place to stand oh God I say God
[1:03:12] bring our young people Amen to a rock of
[1:03:15] Revelation when the world says go this
[1:03:17] way and preacher says go that way now
[1:03:20] come on church and man I'm just going to
[1:03:22] say it if we quit promoting
[1:03:23] personalities and start promoting the
[1:03:25] message we'd have a lot less distrust in
[1:03:27] the pews that's right free of
[1:03:31] charge preach the message it's the way
[1:03:35] he's the truth he's the life now the
[1:03:39] prophet of God said not any church
[1:03:40] doctrine any theology or any
[1:03:42] denomination but you are the way now you
[1:03:44] say preacher how do you say that because
[1:03:46] Daniel 9 says I Daniel understood by
[1:03:48] books we today understand by books right
[1:03:52] in the last days there come a famine he
[1:03:54] said understand that he'll send Elijah
[1:03:55] before that day comes at the end time
[1:03:58] and he'll have a message that'll turn
[1:04:00] the hearts so the message of Malachi 4
[1:04:03] is a message that's going to turn the
[1:04:06] hearts of the children amen back to the
[1:04:09] fathers to the original amen go back
[1:04:12] again to the end and
[1:04:14] start brother M go back to the end again
[1:04:17] and start he said I understand that'll
[1:04:20] take place amen just before the spirit
[1:04:23] leaves the Gentile Church church amen to
[1:04:25] return to the Jews then listen friends
[1:04:28] amen I know it's not popular amen but
[1:04:30] time is running out we are living in the
[1:04:33] Fulfillment of the forthcoming of Elijah
[1:04:35] and Revelation 11 will be fulfilled so
[1:04:38] why there's time to take a pull pit
[1:04:41] while there's time to have a meeting
[1:04:43] while there's Grace to preach this
[1:04:44] message why don't we just get back to
[1:04:46] humbl ourselves and say I'm wrong you're
[1:04:49] wrong and the prophet is right and just
[1:04:51] say what he said now I'm I'm pushing
[1:04:53] against Spirit I'm going to push it
[1:04:55] right out of here amen we just need to
[1:04:57] get back to being able to read a quote
[1:04:59] and keep on
[1:05:01] preaching whatever happened to just
[1:05:04] being able to stand behind the pull pit
[1:05:06] and say what a prophet said and keep on
[1:05:08] preaching it's got to where now if you
[1:05:10] read a quote you got to stop and spend
[1:05:12] 30 minutes explaining why you said it
[1:05:14] and what direction you're going to say
[1:05:16] it amen but I will not lay down and
[1:05:18] waste time Amen to pet that devil around
[1:05:21] I'm not going to read a quote and spend
[1:05:23] all night explaining I'm going to say
[1:05:25] what a prophet said and let the presence
[1:05:27] of the way the truth and the life come
[1:05:30] in the church and put Faith in the
[1:05:32] hearts of the Believers Elijah's message
[1:05:35] will be a heart message it will be a
[1:05:37] washing of the heart that he would
[1:05:39] sanctify the church and he would cleanse
[1:05:41] it with the washing of the Water by the
[1:05:43] word now brother Bram says it very
[1:05:45] beautiful he says the Waters of
[1:05:47] separation is the word the word of God
[1:05:50] the Waters of Separation through the
[1:05:53] washing of the water Water by the word
[1:05:55] he said you come and you hear the word
[1:05:58] and the first thing it does is it
[1:06:00] separates you to move your thoughts from
[1:06:03] the evil to the
[1:06:05] good so in other words you should leave
[1:06:07] church with more answers than you leave
[1:06:09] with confusions you should leave with a
[1:06:12] clear direction as opposed to which way
[1:06:14] do I go who do I follow are you hearing
[1:06:18] me the message of the hour separates
[1:06:20] your thoughts from the good or from the
[1:06:22] evil and the good now you all know the
[1:06:24] prophet teaches this Amen in a hidden
[1:06:27] life with Christ he says that every
[1:06:29] person lives in a three- room house no
[1:06:31] matter how big your house is how many
[1:06:33] rooms you got amen you only live in a
[1:06:36] three-bedroom house brother said now
[1:06:38] notice this God lived in a three room
[1:06:40] house back in his Tabernacle the
[1:06:42] congregation the courts of the
[1:06:44] congregation was the Holy place and then
[1:06:46] the holies of holies so what you're
[1:06:48] doing is you're moving from the
[1:06:49] outermost to the innermost you're moving
[1:06:52] from the outer Court to the inner court
[1:06:55] amen but you can't stop there you got to
[1:06:57] go to the holies of holies which the
[1:06:59] holies of holies amen was the innermost
[1:07:02] place of the sanctuary right now watch a
[1:07:05] prophet he said and now then the three
[1:07:06] rooms what represents just like the
[1:07:09] steps you come amen the place of a full
[1:07:12] consecration with Christ amen so the
[1:07:14] outer Court was the first step the inner
[1:07:17] Court was the Second Step but the holies
[1:07:20] of holies was the final step into a
[1:07:23] place of full consecration to the Lord
[1:07:26] Jesus Christ he said the kitchen is
[1:07:28] where you eat so the sinner comes to the
[1:07:30] meeting and he Feast on the word because
[1:07:33] Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of
[1:07:35] the word so he comes to hear the word
[1:07:38] now watch a prophet many times we
[1:07:40] substitute so much instead of the word
[1:07:43] especially today we are substituting
[1:07:46] phenomenal we are substituting a lot of
[1:07:48] other things that shouldn't be now don't
[1:07:50] get mad at me but let me just say what a
[1:07:52] prophet said after all all the church is
[1:07:55] for preaching the
[1:07:58] word now if we want to sit around here
[1:08:00] how great you are Amen Let Us meet
[1:08:02] somewhere and have a cup of coffee so
[1:08:04] we'll at least be comfortable is that
[1:08:06] okay am mean if we want to hear how
[1:08:08] anointed you are at least let us get
[1:08:10] somewhere we kick our feet up and enjoy
[1:08:12] ourselves well God have mercy and not
[1:08:14] have to enjoy how intellectual and how
[1:08:16] intelligent you but the house of God is
[1:08:19] for the preaching of the word which
[1:08:21] means there should be nothing else in
[1:08:23] the p
[1:08:24] outside of the word of God he said
[1:08:27] testimonies are fine and different
[1:08:29] things we do is wonderful but we must
[1:08:31] give the word first place because it's
[1:08:33] for The Sinner and for the people that
[1:08:36] has the Holy Spirit also now come on
[1:08:38] Church brother Brandon put tongues in
[1:08:40] order because Paul said if the unlearn
[1:08:43] come in among you won't they all say
[1:08:44] you're crazy amen now listen church amen
[1:08:47] if a if an unlearned person comes in
[1:08:50] everybody speaking in tongues running
[1:08:51] all across the building amen you know
[1:08:53] what they're going to do they're going
[1:08:54] to walk out and say them people's crazy
[1:08:56] but a prophet put it in order now let's
[1:08:58] just go on to the next step if a sinner
[1:09:01] comes in and all they hear you talking
[1:09:02] about is how this message is not Jesus
[1:09:05] Christ and brother brandham had faults
[1:09:07] and there was failures in the message
[1:09:08] and brother brandham made mistakes
[1:09:10] they're going to walk out there and say
[1:09:11] them people's confused on what they
[1:09:13] believe amen but why don't we get back
[1:09:15] to just having church and not caring
[1:09:18] about what anybody thinks caring about
[1:09:20] what anybody says and just left the
[1:09:22] anointing of the Holy Ghost break out in
[1:09:24] the church again and bring a fire in
[1:09:27] there that'll heal the sick and raise
[1:09:28] the dead and save the lost the church is
[1:09:31] for the word it's okay to have
[1:09:33] testimonies but it's for the word see
[1:09:35] Jesus said it is written man shall not
[1:09:37] live by bread alone but by what every
[1:09:40] word not every
[1:09:43] testimony every word well come on Church
[1:09:48] let's get that devil out here and have
[1:09:49] church every word that proceedeth out of
[1:09:52] the mouth of God you say preach you must
[1:09:54] be against testifying have you heard me
[1:09:56] preach I share testimonies but if that's
[1:09:59] not the direction of the body what oh
[1:10:02] God I'm get in trouble what God does in
[1:10:04] my Ministry is not your headship brother
[1:10:06] Tim what God uses me to do on the field
[1:10:09] is not the direction for the entire
[1:10:11] bride this message is the direction for
[1:10:14] the bride that's why I've got to lay
[1:10:16] myself aside and lay yourself in the
[1:10:18] message and hear what a prophet said to
[1:10:21] give the people a direction to go see
[1:10:23] the Holy Spirit feeds on the word of God
[1:10:26] he takes the word and he places it into
[1:10:29] your heart and makes you grow in
[1:10:31] strength amen good Bible exploits I love
[1:10:34] it he said so you see the argument of
[1:10:36] that just doesn't stand we're not to
[1:10:39] argue we are to preach the word so some
[1:10:42] guys get up and all they do is talk
[1:10:43] about themselves then other guys get up
[1:10:45] and spend all night arguing with a
[1:10:47] prophet amen but that's not what the
[1:10:49] pulpit is for the pulpit is for the
[1:10:52] faith of God to come into the Church of
[1:10:54] God and not just get on your flesh and
[1:10:57] not just get in your spirit but to go
[1:10:59] into the
[1:11:01] innermost and God will have some I love
[1:11:03] this God will have somebody that'll hear
[1:11:06] it and receive it are you ready for this
[1:11:08] those who Jesus died to hear the word
[1:11:11] they'll hear it those who Jesus died to
[1:11:14] hear the word they will hear it so you
[1:11:17] don't have to water it down to present
[1:11:19] it you don't have to back off of it to
[1:11:21] present it are you hearing me they'll
[1:11:23] just say what a prophet said because God
[1:11:26] never intended for his word to be
[1:11:29] accepted by intellectualism but by faith
[1:11:32] neither did he intend for the word to be
[1:11:34] hidden in the mind but to be hidden in
[1:11:37] the heart that's why the prophet said
[1:11:39] there's too much intellectual faith in
[1:11:41] the stead of being heart Faith there's
[1:11:44] too much intellectual faith in the stead
[1:11:47] of being heart Faith now brother B
[1:11:49] preaches an entire sermon amen if you
[1:11:51] get time listen to it you ought to do
[1:11:52] this week it's called believe from the
[1:11:55] heart 1957 believe from the heart amen
[1:11:58] now what is he showing you brother he's
[1:12:00] showing us that we're not believing from
[1:12:02] the head but we're believing from the
[1:12:04] heart in the Book of Proverbs 23:7 Bible
[1:12:07] says for as he thanketh in his heart so
[1:12:10] is he in Psalms 119:1 Thy word have I
[1:12:14] hid in my heart that I might not sin
[1:12:16] against thee in Romans 10:10 for with a
[1:12:19] heart man believeth under righteousness
[1:12:22] and with a mouth conf confession is made
[1:12:24] unto salvation now this is the quote I
[1:12:27] was on today when the spirit of the Lord
[1:12:29] just dropped in my study and be to show
[1:12:31] me some things on it he said therefore
[1:12:33] if a man or woman could ever get their
[1:12:35] thoughts and their testimonies and their
[1:12:37] lives so lined up with God Amen not this
[1:12:41] way not that way amen but the way which
[1:12:44] is God Amen until the channel of the
[1:12:47] Holy Spirit would be perfectly one with
[1:12:50] God Amen what would take place if the
[1:12:54] man and the woman could ever get lined
[1:12:56] up with the freedom from their hearts
[1:12:59] with Faith from their innermost amen if
[1:13:02] they could ever get their thoughts get
[1:13:04] their testimony brother Bill and their
[1:13:06] lives lined up in the channel of the
[1:13:09] holy spirit amen with freedom from their
[1:13:11] hearts and with Faith from the innermost
[1:13:14] he said now many people come to the
[1:13:15] altar to be prayed for they have
[1:13:17] intellectual Faith they confess their
[1:13:19] sins they join the church by
[1:13:21] intellectual Faith they believe it in
[1:13:22] their mind they believe it because they
[1:13:24] heard it they believe it because they
[1:13:26] know it's the best policy but that's not
[1:13:29] what God looks at he doesn't look at
[1:13:31] your intellectual Faith he looks on the
[1:13:34] heart or on the inside and when it comes
[1:13:37] from the heart all things are possible
[1:13:40] then then your confession meets up with
[1:13:42] your life and your life speaks as loud
[1:13:45] as your confession does but when your
[1:13:47] confession says one thing and your life
[1:13:50] another then there's something wrong
[1:13:51] somewhere because you you got an
[1:13:53] intellectual faith and not a Faith from
[1:13:56] your heart and that shows that the
[1:13:58] outside here is a knowledge of God but
[1:14:02] inside here is a demon of doubting you
[1:14:04] say I believe in Divine Healing but it's
[1:14:06] not for me you see it could be so but I
[1:14:09] don't believe it get it outside you say
[1:14:12] yes but inside your conscience says no
[1:14:16] listen church outside you get in the
[1:14:18] atmosphere of the sunlight and the
[1:14:21] candle light amen but that light will
[1:14:23] not sustain you on the rainy days and
[1:14:26] the cloudy days you got to get in the
[1:14:28] holies of holies where the light that is
[1:14:30] shining is not coming from a man it's
[1:14:33] not coming from a candle it's coming
[1:14:35] from the Shina himself shining in your
[1:14:39] heart you can be on the outside and say
[1:14:42] yes come on y'all know what I'm talking
[1:14:44] about y'all been enough good hot

[1:14:59] faith is you got to move into the faith
[1:15:01] of God where it's something beyond the
[1:15:03] emotions of the church come on now amen
[1:15:06] the outside's good to say yes but I want
[1:15:08] the inside to say yes I don't just want
[1:15:11] my outside come on y'all know me I love
[1:15:13] to dance I want my feet to say yes but
[1:15:16] sister Faith when my feet don't feel
[1:15:18] like dancing I still want my soul to say
[1:15:21] yes when my hands don't feel like
[1:15:23] clapping I still want my soul to say yes
[1:15:26] when my body don't feel like going to
[1:15:28] church I still want my soul to raise up
[1:15:30] and say yes we're going to the house of
[1:15:32] God because we're serving a God who is
[1:15:35] greater and bigger oh hallelujah
[1:15:38] hallelujah I'm talking about a God that
[1:15:41] can move on the depths of a Believer and
[1:15:43] can bring him to a stability around this
[1:15:46] message oh the outside says yes and the
[1:15:49] Conscience Says No get them lined up
[1:15:53] amen I'm going to preach you tonight he
[1:15:55] said just a moment everyone Reverend

[1:15:59] your heart don't be emotionally have
[1:16:01] faith your emotions will never build a
[1:16:04] material it builds intellectual Faith
[1:16:06] but it'll never build a faith in your
[1:16:09] heart so what are we going to do stand
[1:16:11] here and spend all night and explain
[1:16:12] that quote I'm going to preach and keep

[1:16:17] Daughters of God I don't need to spend
[1:16:19] 15 minutes explaining I do believe in
[1:16:21] Emotion see oh
[1:16:24] I'm getting in trouble sure is the world
[1:16:26] that's what happens when we make a man
[1:16:28] the filter instead of the
[1:16:33] message if you're listening to the
[1:16:35] message you know brother BR said
[1:16:36] wildfire and then he said and then he
[1:16:38] said sing solid gospel teaching some
[1:16:41] other day they said you know they said
[1:16:42] there's a real famous quote right now I
[1:16:43] said what is that they said Jesus picked
[1:16:46] up the Scrolls read the word Supreme
[1:16:48] anointing supreme power is the anointing
[1:16:50] it's in control you know the quote right
[1:16:52] and sat down and and precious words
[1:16:53] proceed out of their mouth so some guy
[1:16:55] asked me brother Sean he said you ever
[1:16:57] preach that I said oh yeah I preached
[1:16:58] that before they said now you got to be
[1:17:00] careful quoting that quote you got to be
[1:17:02] real careful I said why they said
[1:17:03] because if you quote it somebody's going
[1:17:05] to thank you King shout I said brother
[1:17:07] I've quoted that quote dancing down the
[1:17:09] aisle of a
[1:17:10] church are you hearing me because my
[1:17:13] faith knows what a prophet was saying I
[1:17:15] have been brought to a stability there's
[1:17:17] a faith in my soul that says a prophet
[1:17:20] was not confusing the church he was
[1:17:22] given the church a place to stand and
[1:17:25] emotions is not a place to stand though
[1:17:27] we believe in them but the faith of God
[1:17:30] is not built upon the shifting Sands of
[1:17:32] a man's emotions the faith of God is
[1:17:35] built on thus sayith the Lord or that
[1:17:37] man keeps
[1:17:40] still now don't get built up he said he

[1:22:28] one in this
[1:22:30] service somebody shout my soul one
[1:22:33] brother Sean how many sermons have we
[1:22:35] preached that our flesh didn't win and
[1:22:37] our spirit didn't win but our soul won
[1:22:40] if it was up to our flesh we would have
[1:22:42] stayed in bed if it was up to our spirit
[1:22:44] we wouldn't have stood before the people
[1:22:46] but there was a Dynamo in our soul and
[1:22:49] there was a fire shut up in our bones
[1:22:51] ready to express
[1:22:53] that Jesus Christ is still a god of his
[1:22:56] word somebody shout hallelujah
[1:22:59] hallelujah out thank God my soul
[1:23:02] one thank God my soul one thank God my

[1:23:10] sister Mindy you're Soul one are you
[1:23:12] hearing me that's why you're still here
[1:23:14] it's CZ greater is he that's in your
[1:23:18] soul verily I say unto you whosoever
[1:23:21] shall say un this mountain be thou
[1:23:23] removed and be thou cast into the sea
[1:23:26] and what shall not doubt in his what
[1:23:30] heart in his innermost shall believe
[1:23:33] that those things which he say shall
[1:23:35] come to pass he shall have whatsoever he
[1:23:39] saith he shall have whatsoever he sayith
[1:23:43] listen to Prophet well it seems like
[1:23:44] being up thinking those things that
[1:23:47] there could be a
[1:23:50] placing there could be a placing
[1:23:53] by reading the word of faith that would
[1:23:55] go beyond the intellectual
[1:23:59] conceptions Into the
[1:24:05] Heart Jesus said if Thou shalt say in
[1:24:09] their heart in the heart now watch this
[1:24:11] we cannot somebody say cannot we cannot
[1:24:14] mix the intellectual with the
[1:24:17] supernatural they have no dealings with
[1:24:19] each other at all the intellectual says
[1:24:21] one thing
[1:24:22] brother Matthew but the supernatural
[1:24:24] says another so we got to stay where
[1:24:27] Jesus is the way well we're not saying
[1:24:30] one thing and another thing we're all
[1:24:32] saying the same thing he said any man
[1:24:35] ever led by the spirit of God does not
[1:24:38] take any thought but he's LED from his
[1:24:40] heart by the spirit of God and that man
[1:24:43] is misunderstood I can prove that to you
[1:24:46] by Hannah in the temple she went to the
[1:24:49] temple and when she walked in brother
[1:24:51] Branson the priest actually thought she
[1:24:53] was drunk she said I'm not drunk on
[1:24:55] strong drink she said no he said and
[1:24:58] that's way a lot of people are that get
[1:24:59] sincere is they're just misunderstood
[1:25:02] she she wasn't drunk she was
[1:25:04] misunderstood and any men and women who
[1:25:06] are really from the core of their heart
[1:25:09] really fully surrendered to the Lord
[1:25:11] Jesus Christ they're not crazy they're
[1:25:16] misunderstood the world knows their own

[1:27:44] but she believed it brother Tim when
[1:27:46] Abraham was confessing Sarah you're

[1:27:55] milk veins Beyond her dead womb beyond
[1:27:58] the wrinkles in her head he had to give
[1:28:00] her a revelation and he gave her a

[1:28:50] dead womb she would have got them on the

[1:31:09] believing whatever you're listening to
[1:31:12] is directly influencing what you're
[1:31:14] believing now today many people are
[1:31:16] listening to enticing Spirits instead of
[1:31:18] taking the word of God Spirits they're
[1:31:20] in the world they're demons they go out
[1:31:23] into places they get amongst men
[1:31:25] ministers they get amongst church
[1:31:27] members they get amongst good people and
[1:31:30] they caus them to come into an
[1:31:33] illusion now don't get mad at me but
[1:31:36] cifi preaching around this message has
[1:31:39] opened the door for
[1:31:45] illusion shock Factor right sissified
[1:31:49] preaching has opened the door wide up to
[1:31:51] let Spirits just walk right in the
[1:31:53] church and now they're influencing the
[1:31:55] pull pit they're influencing the pews
[1:31:57] they're influencing the young people
[1:31:59] come on when men put gloves on oh God
[1:32:03] when they put gloves on and started
[1:32:04] preaching this message is when we
[1:32:06] started hearing people get up and say
[1:32:08] the cloud didn't happen well come on
[1:32:10] church it's when we started debating
[1:32:12] whether that picture should be in the
[1:32:14] church house or not well if it don't
[1:32:17] belong in a sanctuary somebody stand up
[1:32:19] and tell me where in the name of the
[1:32:20] Lord does it belong if it don't belong
[1:32:23] in a sanctuary then somebody pray tell
[1:32:26] me where does it belong does it belong

[1:32:30] shop amen come on Amen I'll go ahead and
[1:32:32] preach since I'm here amen I tell you
[1:32:34] where people want it they don't want it
[1:32:35] at all because if they're too ashamed to
[1:32:37] put it in the church they're ashamed to
[1:32:39] have it in their home they're ashamed to
[1:32:40] have it among their kids amen but I say
[1:32:43] thank God in this age that Jesus Christ
[1:32:45] come down in the form of a pillar of
[1:32:47] fire and he give me a place to stand and
[1:32:50] right here is where I stand I stand with
[1:32:53] this picture you can mock me criticize
[1:32:55] me laugh at me do what you want to but I

[1:33:18] God I say thank you brother Sean thank
[1:33:21] you for not being ashamed to hang that
[1:33:23] picture up and let our young people know
[1:33:25] there's a power in that
[1:33:29] picture
[1:33:31] well enticing
[1:33:34] Spirits enticing Spirits trying to adopt
[1:33:38] new plans I tell you why we don't have
[1:33:40] prayer lines is they adopted psychology
[1:33:43] to fix
[1:33:44] marriages tried to adopt science to fix
[1:33:47] our sicknesses brother said they tried
[1:33:49] to I'm I'm closing that Devil's
[1:33:50] squirming right now now but y'all
[1:33:52] sicking me pretty good right
[1:33:54] now they're trying to adopt education to
[1:33:57] take the place of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:59] education will never take the place of
[1:34:02] the
[1:34:03] leadership of the Holy
[1:34:06] Spirit now tell you what it's all about
[1:34:08] oh my tell you what it's all about right
[1:34:12] here give me a few minutes and I'm done
[1:34:16] the devil is trying to establish the
[1:34:18] church in the wisdom of men
[1:34:22] instead of the power of
[1:34:26] God let's establish him in what a man
[1:34:29] can say and the way a man can counsel
[1:34:32] and the way a man can talk and the way a
[1:34:34] man can present let's get them over here
[1:34:36] in the wisdom and get them out of the
[1:34:38] power of God listen what the prophet
[1:34:40] said he said you know that Satan's
[1:34:42] gospel is knowledge he said now
[1:34:44] sometimes we make the church programs
[1:34:46] they also call for their Pastor the
[1:34:47] church goes to vote the pastor they say
[1:34:49] well this pastor now he's got two
[1:34:51] degrees in college he learned four years
[1:34:52] of
[1:34:54] psychology thank you brother brandom he
[1:34:57] took this that and the other and they'll
[1:34:58] vote that kind of man in instead of a
[1:35:00] pastor who believes in God's word being
[1:35:02] inspired and being God and will preach
[1:35:05] the word regardless of how the people
[1:35:07] feel about it he said now God told
[1:35:09] Ezekiel preach that where they believe
[1:35:11] it or not you preach it anyhow see right
[1:35:13] where they accept it or not that ain't
[1:35:14] it they didn't accept Jesus but he went
[1:35:17] right on preaching just the same can I
[1:35:19] dedicate this to our pastor will that be
[1:35:21] okay instead of a real Pastor that will
[1:35:24] really preach the word of God and
[1:35:26] believe in God they try to bring in the
[1:35:28] intellect the man who has the best
[1:35:29] education stands in the pull pit don't
[1:35:32] take more than 15 minutes can get us
[1:35:33] home right quick and Ricky can hot rod
[1:35:36] and start out and go the twist parties
[1:35:38] and it's nothing but a hybrid pollution
[1:35:40] he said that's right he said now watch
[1:35:43] he said that's exactly right it
[1:35:45] satisfies their taste it satisfies a
[1:35:48] worldly Church member's taste he said
[1:35:50] but it don't satisfy a oh God it don't
[1:35:54] satisfy a Saint's taste he said if
[1:35:57] you're a real son or daughter of God he
[1:35:59] said when your pastor's in the pull pit
[1:36:01] and he's preaching that word you'll say
[1:36:03] preach it anyhow
[1:36:05] preacher preach it anyhow preacher come
[1:36:07] on I know what I'm talking about amen I
[1:36:09] may not be here every service but I've
[1:36:11] driven down the road long enough and
[1:36:12] heard this man preach and I spoke out in
[1:36:14] my car preach it anyhow preacher you
[1:36:17] know why because he's laboring to bring
[1:36:19] a faith in the church to Pi give you a
[1:36:22] place to stand brother Sean we thank you
[1:36:24] for preaching this message we thank you
[1:36:26] for standing with this word we thank you
[1:36:28] for not changing this way and changeing
[1:36:30] that way and turning this way brother
[1:36:32] Sean We Salute You we thank you for
[1:36:34] standing where a prophet give us a place
[1:36:36] to stand you know what I say we ought to
[1:36:39] kick every devil out of the house of God
[1:36:41] and stand with the man of God and the
[1:36:42] word of God and the power of God and the
[1:36:45] pillar of fire of
[1:36:47] God because faith faith is in the church
[1:36:50] what do you get getting that preacher
[1:36:53] I'm getting it this right here and I'm
[1:36:54] done brother says it like this he said
[1:36:56] now watch they'll preach it anyhow
[1:36:59] because the word is what produces the
[1:37:01] victory they're not looking at the
[1:37:03] reaction of the people the man's Works
[1:37:05] declares his character and Christ was
[1:37:07] God's work so he preaches the word
[1:37:10] regardless now y'all ever I just listen
[1:37:12] this today and Believe from the heart
[1:37:15] said Here I Am the other day down there
[1:37:16] with the two Woods Brothers Banks and L
[1:37:18] he said brother Woods said to his
[1:37:19] brother L he said I would it be would it
[1:37:22] not be great now he's talking about that
[1:37:24] old sister you know that got saved
[1:37:25] around so would it not be great now if
[1:37:27] we go back and find that old sister and
[1:37:29] let her know that we're saved now
[1:37:31] Brother Sam here is a prophet of God
[1:37:33] y'all forgive me here is a prophet of
[1:37:35] God in a boat with the with the Woods
[1:37:38] Brothers and he has a vision there's
[1:37:40] going to be a resurrection of life right
[1:37:43] and in the vision he's going to go
[1:37:44] through muddy waters and all these
[1:37:45] things but while they're in the boat
[1:37:47] brother Junior one of them looks at the
[1:37:49] other and says wouldn't it be good to go
[1:37:50] back and tell that old Jehovah Witness
[1:37:53] lady we're saved and brother said when
[1:37:55] they said that he said now that word
[1:37:57] found favor with
[1:38:00] God come on Church everywhere else
[1:38:03] brother Terry we preach we found favor
[1:38:06] with God God we found but these words
[1:38:09] found favor with God he said now watch
[1:38:12] for a long time he said those two
[1:38:13] Jehovah Witness boys both them aged men
[1:38:15] wanting to find an old woman and tell
[1:38:16] her they was saved two brothers and when
[1:38:18] they said that the spirit of God and his
[1:38:21] sovereignty fell on me sitting there in
[1:38:24] that boat oh I wish I could had a voice
[1:38:26] some way I could sink that into the
[1:38:28] people's heart I could not no more
[1:38:30] control myself than you could fly to the
[1:38:33] moon just by that word and I said boys
[1:38:36] there's something fixing to happen it's
[1:38:38] a little animal of some sort it'll be
[1:38:40] brought to life there's going to be life
[1:38:43] connected with it and you will see it
[1:38:44] right away and I thought now what have I
[1:38:47] said and I begin to think of some things
[1:38:50] what made me say that no vision it was
[1:38:52] just something spoke are you hearing me
[1:38:55] if you have faith in God and do not
[1:38:58] doubt in your heart you can have
[1:39:00] whatsoever things you say he said what
[1:39:03] was it it wasn't my intellectuals I
[1:39:05] couldn't even think of such a thing it
[1:39:07] was down below that oh God it was down
[1:39:11] below that brother Junior in the heart
[1:39:13] that God had come into he was doing the
[1:39:16] speaking I didn't even wasn't thinking
[1:39:19] of such a thing but
[1:39:21] spoke oh God I got here too late I'm
[1:39:25] sorry I think there is where Jesus said
[1:39:27] if thou believest in the heart and shall
[1:39:30] say to this tree or this mountain then

[1:39:34] say to come to pass you will have what
[1:39:36] you say are you ready for this there's
[1:39:38] my point get to that spot to where it's
[1:39:41] something is not yourself it's something
[1:39:44] beyond your reason that speaks it and
[1:39:47] you say from your heart God it's the
[1:39:50] truth and there alone I
[1:39:54] stand are you hearing me brother Terry
[1:39:56] here's a prophet in the boat with two
[1:39:59] Woods Brothers and his brother Bob he's
[1:40:01] ready to stand by himself listen if the
[1:40:04] Woods Brothers wouldn't have believed it
[1:40:05] William Brandon would have believed it
[1:40:07] because the intellectual had gone beyond
[1:40:09] it was in his heart he said and let that
[1:40:12] just keep in here until it drops into
[1:40:14] here and from your head to your heart

[2:01:05] hallelujah
[2:01:07] hallelujah
[2:01:09] amen you know just thinking U been
[2:01:15] thinking a lot past couple days you know
[2:01:19] uh it was said that pictures like that
[2:01:22] right there is not a Fitting Place for
[2:01:24] the house of
[2:01:26] God and
[2:01:28] [Music]
[2:01:32] uh caused some confusion with the young
[2:01:35] people and SW is because when people
[2:01:38] come in they think we're worshiping that
[2:01:40] man right
[2:01:43] there now there's all kinds of pictures
[2:01:46] of brother Brandon and you'll never find
[2:01:49] one in this
[2:01:52] Sanctuary I got to thinking if you if
[2:01:54] you cut that picture out take take
[2:01:56] brother brand out and all you got is
[2:01:58] that Pillar of Fire now most people's
[2:02:01] got that right there that picture of
[2:02:03] Jesus
[2:02:04] Christ and like one Minister
[2:02:09] said that ain't Jesus Christ that's just
[2:02:13] some man's I idea of what Jesus Christ
[2:02:17] looked like now brother Brown said
[2:02:19] that's the closest to what Jesus Christ
[2:02:22] looks like but that's not but that there
[2:02:24] is
[2:02:25] God you you can't get any
[2:02:28] closer that that's not a
[2:02:32] painting that's that's God that's the
[2:02:35] same Pillar of Fire that was with Moses
[2:02:37] and all the way through that that's
[2:02:39] that's it now if we take that brother
[2:02:43] Brandon totally out of that picture and
[2:02:44] we just keep the pillar of fire we
[2:02:47] totally defeat what God done there we
[2:02:50] totally defeated if if God just wanted
[2:02:53] his picture taken he he could have had a
[2:02:56] picture taken anywhere he could have
[2:02:58] moved in the in the the art gallery or
[2:03:02] the the photographer gallery and moved
[2:03:06] on a photographer to just take a picture
[2:03:08] and there' be the pillar of fire but the
[2:03:10] point was the point was God would answer
[2:03:15] all of our questions by fire
[2:03:19] he in his wisdom didn't think about his
[2:03:24] elect worshiping that
[2:03:26] [Music]
[2:03:27] man but when the questions would rise
[2:03:30] today and Ministries would rise today
[2:03:32] and preach all kinds of stuff to where
[2:03:34] the people don't know what to believe
[2:03:36] God Answers by fire and says believe
[2:03:39] that believe the voice believe what he
[2:03:44] says he gives us a place to stand
[2:03:47] because God stood there too
[2:03:49] too that's God standing taking his place
[2:03:53] in this generation and says I'll be
[2:03:55] willing to have my picture
[2:03:57] taken any other man I challenge you the
[2:04:01] millions of of pictures that you want
[2:04:04] outside the message in Dr doson TD Jake
[2:04:08] Billy Graham o Roberts bringing on in
[2:04:11] Shawn
[2:04:12] Martin uh uh brother Terry Horn brother
[2:04:15] Wayne Lawson brother Tim PR brother Ron
[2:04:17] Spencer brother coffee any brother
[2:04:21] Donnie Reagan to to uh brother Amos cuts
[2:04:24] and anyone put all the pictures up there
[2:04:27] that we could just keep putting on on
[2:04:30] the screen and you'll never see a pillar
[2:04:32] of fire one time would you have a pillar
[2:04:34] of fire over anyone's head but God took
[2:04:38] his picture with the
[2:04:40] prophet and he gives us he gives us a
[2:04:43] place to stand and says I'm behind him
[2:04:47] can you say Amen so we're not worshiping
[2:04:50] a
[2:04:51] man
[2:04:53] now yes Washington DC has a picture just
[2:04:57] like that it's got the authentic but you
[2:04:59] know what to go to see that picture you
[2:05:01] have to ask for the picture you have to
[2:05:04] ask to see the picture then you've got
[2:05:07] to go and sign all kinds of
[2:05:10] forms before you can even see the
[2:05:12] picture but how many people how many of
[2:05:15] us have been to the White House to see
[2:05:17] the picture have y any of y'all seen a
[2:05:19] picture of course
[2:05:21] not so we provide a picture so you don't
[2:05:24] have to travel all the way to washingon
[2:05:27] to see a picture can you say
[2:05:30] Amen God's just been so good to
[2:05:33] us so young people if you want to know
[2:05:36] where to stand God stood by stand with
[2:05:40] him we're not worshiping the prophet at
[2:05:43] all that what he said is the truth stand
[2:05:47] with him can you say amen you love the
[2:05:50] Lord I sure love the Lord amen I thought
[2:05:54] of how that you know when that picture
[2:05:56] was taken it was the critics God's Own
[2:05:59] critics that took that picture right and
[2:06:02] and and you know where God took it at
[2:06:05] brother Brandon wasn't in an art gallery
[2:06:07] or a phot
[2:06:08] photographer in in some private you know
[2:06:11] where it was before the people thousands
[2:06:14] of people gathered and it was a big old
[2:06:17] debate right some some unbeliever was
[2:06:20] trying to criticize brother brandom's
[2:06:22] Healing Ministry and say that Divine
[2:06:25] Healing was a fraud and all of that and
[2:06:27] that's where God took his picture at
[2:06:30] ain't that right so Satan could not
[2:06:33] could could not keep the people from
[2:06:35] doubting amen cuz brother Brown said
[2:06:37] they all saw it right there they saw
[2:06:39] that Pillar of Fire come over his head
[2:06:41] and then you know and and uh but now
[2:06:45] Satan is so cunning in this age that he
[2:06:49] now that is God yes that is God and that
[2:06:53] that that's that's Vindicated that's
[2:06:55] authentic but notice how he does it now
