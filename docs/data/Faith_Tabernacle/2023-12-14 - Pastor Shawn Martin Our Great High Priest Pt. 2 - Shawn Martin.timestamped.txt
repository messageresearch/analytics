[33:30] Tim amen with us as well and and the
[33:34] musicians can be dismissed if you uh
[33:38] have your Bibles we're just going to go
[33:39] right into the word um Hebrews uh the
[33:45] fourth
[33:47] chapter
[33:51] um Hebrews chapter
[33:55] 4 and uh
[33:57] um going to read the the 14th verse uh
[34:01] or start
[34:03] there praise the
[34:06] Lord but before we uh go into the word
[34:08] may we just bow our heads and talk to
[34:11] the author of the word
[34:14] father truly we are people that know
[34:18] what you can do that you work the
[34:21] impossible Lord
[34:23] when science fails when the doctors
[34:28] fail when we fail ourselves Lord that
[34:33] father you are still faithful and you
[34:35] remain God and Lord how we love you for
[34:39] that and Lord we have come under great
[34:42] expectation tonight to hear from you and
[34:45] to see you
[34:47] perform we had ask Lord that you would
[34:50] come and have your way feel at home here
[34:53] tonight Among Us Lord anoint the word
[34:56] word and want the speaking and the
[34:58] hearing of your word father is our
[35:01] prayer Lord let every need that is here
[35:05] let it be met father we ask it in Jesus
[35:08] Christ's name amen and amen praise the
[35:13] Lord now the um Hebrews the 4th chapter
[35:18] the 14th verse says saying then we have
[35:22] a high
[35:23] priest or a great high priest that is
[35:26] pass into the heavens Jesus the son of
[35:30] God let us hold fast our
[35:34] profession for we have not an high
[35:37] priest which cannot be touched with the
[35:40] feeling of our infirmities but was in
[35:42] all points tempted like as we are yet
[35:45] without sin Let Us therefore come boldly
[35:48] unto the throne of grace that we may
[35:50] obtain mercy and find Grace to help in
[35:54] time of need then if you'll go to the
[35:57] 10th chapter same
[35:59] book
[36:01] um chapter 10
[36:06] and verse 23 says let us hold fast the
[36:10] profession of our faith without
[36:12] wavering for he is faithful that
[36:15] promised amen you can have your
[36:20] seats
[36:21] and
[36:23] I'm so thankful for the grace of God
[36:27] and um uh if it hadn't been for his
[36:30] grace then uh we would be in certainly a
[36:34] lot of trouble we we wouldn't have any
[36:36] hope of eternal life there would be no
[36:39] Rapture there would be no Millennium
[36:41] there would be no body change there'd be
[36:44] no Heavens or New Earth and and we
[36:47] certainly wouldn't be
[36:48] preaching uh the things that we preach
[36:51] wouldn't be believing the things that we
[36:53] believe we wouldn't even have faith amen
[36:56] man but it's it's by the grace of
[36:59] God and you know we we know according to
[37:03] the scriptures that that God
[37:06] predestinated a
[37:07] church and uh to be
[37:11] uh without spot wrink or blemish and he
[37:15] said he would have a church like that
[37:18] when he came and and so that that is a
[37:22] high standard uh that God had set for
[37:25] for you and I is that we would be
[37:27] without spot wrinkle or blemish and
[37:30] several scriptures that I'm just going
[37:31] to read right through uh Matthew 5:48
[37:35] Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even
[37:37] as your father which is in heaven is
[37:39] perfect amen 1 Corinthians 1:8 breaking
[37:43] again that you may be blameless in the
[37:45] day of our Lord Jesus Christ Philippians
[37:48] 2:15 that you may be blameless and
[37:51] harmless the sons of God without rebuke
[37:55] uh 1 Thessalonians 5 23 breaking in I
[37:58] pray God your whole Spirit soul and body
[38:01] be preserved blameless unto the coming
[38:04] of our Lord Jesus Christ and notice how
[38:07] he puts it in the second verse there
[38:09] there the 24th verse Faithful Is He that
[38:11] called you and who also will do it so so
[38:17] we get the idea that we are to be
[38:19] perfect we are to be blameless without
[38:21] spot wrinkle or blemish
[38:24] undefiled and yeah
[38:27] uh uh this could only happen uh uh
[38:31] through uh the work of redemption so if
[38:34] it had not been for Grace we we wouldn't
[38:38] even have the word redemption in our
[38:41] vocabulary and uh it certainly wouldn't
[38:44] be in our songs or our sermons it it it
[38:47] certainly wouldn't be our heartbeat but
[38:50] but of course as the prophet brought
[38:52] Redemption out so beautifully to us uh
[38:56] Redemption is to bring back to its uh
[39:01] original condition and and so of course
[39:04] this is redemption of nature the
[39:06] Redemption of man and and so man is
[39:11] restored back to fellowship with god um
[39:15] his Dominion that he once had is
[39:17] restored back to him his innocence is
[39:21] restored the word uh that he had lost is
[39:24] restored unto him
[39:27] and so under this this Banner of
[39:29] redemption uh man is no longer a sinner
[39:33] uh he he cannot and and and you know I I
[39:37] pray that God really puts that into our
[39:39] hearts and and and reveals that to us
[39:42] because how can we have faith and this
[39:45] is this is where uh the Apostle Paul as
[39:48] we read let us uh hold fast the
[39:52] profession or confession of our faith so
[39:56] so our Faith uh um there's a confession
[39:59] that we and I you you and I must have
[40:02] and and it must be the confession of
[40:04] faith and then that Faith must rest in
[40:07] something that is is solid and and so if
[40:12] if we're up and down and and we're
[40:14] tossed to and fro and and and and uh
[40:18] we're not really secure and anchored
[40:22] then then we can never hold fast to the
[40:24] profession of Faith or the confession of
[40:27] our faith so God has given us something
[40:31] that would anchor us and under this law
[40:35] of redemption then you are no longer a
[40:39] sinner so you're not a sinner to uh
[40:41] today and tomorrow you're a Christian
[40:43] and to Next Day You're a sinner and and
[40:46] it's topy you know Topsy Turvy because
[40:49] you cannot maintain your confession of
[40:51] faith if if you're up and down so so
[40:55] then uh uh uh uh in this Redemption man
[40:59] is restored back to his original
[41:02] condition fear has no more hold on
[41:06] him um
[41:09] uh sin or Satan um has no more hold
[41:14] sickness and disease has no more right
[41:18] Amen to uh uh inhabit your your life you
[41:22] afflict your body or or whatever because
[41:26] as we were saying last um uh uh
[41:28] Wednesday and I'd like to get more into
[41:30] that uh eventually but uh Calvary took
[41:34] care of not only your spiritual problem
[41:37] but he it took care of your physical
[41:41] amen sickness and disease has been taken
[41:44] care of under this uh Banner of of
[41:49] redemption amen and so this is all about
[41:52] the grace of God though uh uh because
[41:55] before there could be Redemption then
[41:59] God required a payment uh for sin and
[42:03] and uh uh it it had to be paid in full
[42:07] and and so that was that's the question
[42:10] as uh you know who who who could have
[42:13] paid for that and who could have met
[42:15] that and and you know uh according to
[42:19] God's law of redemption not just anybody
[42:22] could pay the price ain't that right not
[42:24] anybody could and and I God uh uh it for
[42:29] one it it had to be a kinsman redeemer
[42:32] so then the prophet says even though the
[42:34] Angels were worthy they're sinless they
[42:37] they could not uh redeem us they could
[42:40] not meet God's requirement uh because
[42:43] there it it to be to redeem man it had
[42:47] to take a man uh uh to bring Redemption
[42:51] and so uh he had to be a kinsman
[42:54] redeemer uh uh so so he had to be a man
[42:58] and and and then we know that this man
[43:00] had to be worthy ain't that right amen
[43:04] so Prophet said he couldn't be some
[43:05] Outlaw he he had to be you know
[43:08] religious
[43:09] sinless a good person and and things
[43:12] like that then he had to be able to
[43:15] redeem and then the prophet said he had
[43:17] to make a public testimony before the
[43:20] elders that he had redeemed ain't that
[43:24] right so we we that the Angels couldn't
[43:27] redeem and yet no man there was no man
[43:31] uh in his Fallen condition that could
[43:35] take on that kinsman redeemer amen could
[43:39] not meet the requirements because as we
[43:42] talked about Wednesday night that God
[43:44] the price that God required for
[43:46] Redemption was blood ain't that right
[43:49] amen that it was blood see the prophet
[43:52] said it was blood that took man out of
[43:55] the garden uh sex blood ain't that right
[43:58] and so this is why Abel uh uh offered a
[44:02] lamb unto God because he had a
[44:04] revelation that it was blood that that
[44:06] took them out amen and the prophet said
[44:10] see it uh uh uh he saw that it was a
[44:13] sexual Affair Through Blood and that
[44:16] that took man out of the garden another
[44:18] place it was an apples that brought us
[44:20] out of the garden like people think here
[44:22] today but it was blood life more life
[44:26] that took us out of the garden it was
[44:29] not fruit that brought them out Eve
[44:31] never ate no apples certainly see so how
[44:34] did she realize she was naked if she ate
[44:36] an apple Prophet said we need to pass
[44:38] the apples around again right if it was
[44:40] Apples amen but it it it it he said it
[44:43] pertained to the sexual life amen see so
[44:48] life doesn't lay in Plants it lays in
[44:50] Blood and and Leviticus
[44:53] 17711 it says for the light life of the
[44:56] flesh is in the blood and I have given
[45:00] it to you upon the altar to make an
[45:04] atonement for your souls for it is the
[45:08] blood that maketh an atonement for the
[45:11] soul aren't you glad for that amen so
[45:14] it's the blood amen and and under God's
[45:17] law he required life for life and and so
[45:21] it it couldn't be nothing else but but
[45:24] but the blood amen so blood had to be
[45:27] offered the prophet said as a substitute
[45:30] because the Bloods were life laid and
[45:33] God required life at sin so then we know
[45:38] that that the animal blood it was not
[45:40] sufficient to to to bring this
[45:43] Redemption and and uh to pay the price
[45:46] of sin amen for one it it had no soul
[45:50] and so the the life even though it was
[45:53] an innocent lamb but it had no soul so
[45:56] the life could not mix uh its life could
[45:59] not mix with the life of of the human
[46:03] life ain't that right and and so uh uh
[46:06] uh we we know that in the Old Testament
[46:10] God ordained the high priest and and uh
[46:14] uh it it was there that that high priest
[46:16] was to be a mediator and and and an an
[46:20] intercessor but he could not be an
[46:22] intercessor by bringing fruit he he
[46:25] couldn't be an intercessor by bringing
[46:28] himself uh he had to bring blood Amen in
[46:32] order to intered ain't that right amen
[46:35] so but the only blood he had was the
[46:38] animal blood that he could offer unto
[46:41] the Lord but as we know as Paul taught
[46:44] us and and things that that blood that
[46:47] blood of that animal life could not uh
[46:50] divorce sin it it wasn't sufficient and
[46:53] as Paul would tell us in Hebrews it
[46:56] could not make the worshipper perfect
[46:59] ain't that right so so then sin had to
[47:03] be divorced in order for Eternal
[47:07] Redemption uh uh to be obtained and and
[47:11] and so brother brandom said see the
[47:13] blood made a covering that animal blood
[47:16] it made a covering but it could not
[47:20] perfectly atone see the man left the
[47:23] building with the same desire to sin
[47:26] as he had in the first and uh first
[47:29] place and and so uh um uh it says but
[47:33] doing this he was looking forward to a
[47:35] time uh when there would be a perfect
[47:38] lamb come and he did it on the burnt
[47:41] offering because it was the only way he
[47:44] knew about see so he said see when the
[47:47] blood was pouring and the life went from
[47:49] the animal it could not go back to the
[47:52] man for uh one was animal one the other
[47:56] was man and and so an innocent animal to
[47:59] a guilty man see it just couldn't do it
[48:02] so this is why we have to have the Holy
[48:05] Ghost and this is why Satan fights us on
[48:08] the Holy Ghost and and if there's ever
[48:11] anything that Satan wants to keep you
[48:13] from or to keep anybody from and that is
[48:17] receiving the true baptism of the Holy
[48:20] Ghost amen see because when that life of
[48:24] God the Holy Ghost is it's not a
[48:26] sensation it's it's more than just a
[48:28] tickle it's more than just whatever it
[48:31] is the life of God returning back up on
[48:34] the
[48:35] believer declaring that your sin has
[48:38] been separated from you amen your sin
[48:42] has been separated from you and and so
[48:45] it's the only way that sin can be
[48:48] divorced and that man can come back into
[48:52] uh uh Redemption aren't you glad for
[48:54] that amen so this this is why it took a
[48:57] kinsman redeemer to redeem amen uh
[49:01] because uh the life of an animal could
[49:04] not mix with the life of a of the human
[49:06] being the blood and and things like that
[49:09] see and so the kinsman redeemer the only
[49:13] way see you know people people think
[49:15] well I've come to the Altar and and but
[49:17] then they get up and and then they just
[49:19] be continue being a sinner it's they're
[49:22] they're safe Sinners or religious
[49:24] Sinners or whatever want to call it amen
[49:27] but that's not what Redemption is it it
[49:30] had to take somebody to divorce the sin
[49:33] it it had to take somebody to take that
[49:36] root of sin out of us anden it's one
[49:39] thing to keep getting forgiven you know
[49:41] you know and over and over and over and
[49:44] over and and coming back to the Altar
[49:46] and coming back to the Altar and coming
[49:47] back to the altar but see there there
[49:50] comes a time when you you just stop amen
[49:53] re saying the sinner's prayer it it it
[49:56] just comes a time when you just stop
[49:59] amen that's what God wanted so we can
[50:01] move up and and move on and recognize
[50:04] who we are get past being a
[50:08] sinner can you say Amen so his his life
[50:12] uh it had to come back upon the believer
[50:14] but in order for it to come back upon
[50:17] the human being there had to be a
[50:19] perfect blood to bring forth a perfect
[50:22] life amen now we realize that human
[50:25] blood just could not work amen because
[50:28] the prophet said it was sinful blood
[50:31] every human being on the face of the
[50:34] Earth has sex blood which in turn is
[50:38] sinful blood amen so all of us are born
[50:42] by sexual desire and blood in us or
[50:45] sinful blood the prophet said through a
[50:47] perverted way of bringing children to
[50:50] the Earth ain't that right see another
[50:53] place he says see man cannot do do it in
[50:56] himself he's a total failure now if
[51:00] there's ever anything that this
[51:03] Christian Life and this message ought to
[51:06] teach us and that is get away from
[51:09] ourselves you you can never ever perfect
[51:13] yourself you can never ever help
[51:17] yourself in any way can you say amen and
[51:20] if you can't do it then no other man can
[51:23] do it if if you can't get yourself out
[51:25] of the pit then the guy in the pit with
[51:28] you can't get yourself get you out of
[51:30] the pit as well amen see so man is total
[51:34] failure and he says God let him see that
[51:37] through the law through the judges and
[51:40] through all the Old Testament he sent
[51:42] the prophet he sent the righteous men
[51:44] and they found out that everyone fell
[51:48] every Prophet has fallen every every
[51:51] patriarch has fallen every there there
[51:54] was nothing Worthy can you say Amen John
[51:57] even saw that when the voice there uh uh
[52:00] uh when the book was closed there went a
[52:02] voice that said who is worthy to open
[52:05] the book and and the prophet lets us in
[52:08] this and and everyone was around and
[52:10] John began to search and he looked and
[52:13] and and all the prophets that he looked
[52:15] to had to hold their head down and the
[52:17] Patriarchs had to hold their head down
[52:20] as good of men as they were and anointed
[52:22] men and great Ministries that they had
[52:25] on the face of the earth when they were
[52:27] here but they all had to hold their head
[52:30] down because nothing was worthy ain't
[52:32] that right well the Bible says that the
[52:35] law made nothing perfect and and and I
[52:38] want to uh uh uh just get that to us for
[52:41] just a moment the law everybody say the
[52:43] law made nothing perfect it it amazes me
[52:48] how people still want the law amen but
[52:51] the law was nothing but carnal
[52:54] Commandments am amen and and and and we
[52:57] all know that uh uh according to the
[52:59] message that it was not God's idea Amen
[53:03] to give the people his law amen he chose
[53:07] them by grace that he he you know that
[53:10] that's what he started Abraham out as is
[53:13] by Grace amen an unconditional Covenant
[53:16] ain't that right so so we are today to
[53:20] live by his grace it's it's through
[53:23] Grace that that we see election the
[53:26] promises are given by grace and not by
[53:29] law the the the power of God is known by
[53:32] Grace the faithfulness of God is known
[53:35] by Grace the longsuffering of God the
[53:38] mercy of God the patience of God Amen
[53:41] and and the loving kindness of God is
[53:44] known by Grace see so it was Israel that
[53:48] chose to live by law amen and and
[53:51] instead of living by the grace of God
[53:54] but here's what a prophet says you can't
[53:56] everybody say I can't no matter what you
[53:59] do you he says you quit you quit
[54:01] drinking you can quit smoking quit
[54:03] telling lies you can even go to church
[54:05] and try to do this and try to do that
[54:08] and yet you're still carnal he said see
[54:11] that's just law you're not perfected by
[54:14] a carnal commandment you're not restored
[54:17] to God by a carnal commandment you'll
[54:19] not go in a Rapture by a carnal
[54:22] commandment amen you're not healed by a
[54:25] carnal commandment can you can you say
[54:27] Amen you're not justified by a carnal
[54:30] commandment so so we we don't want to
[54:34] live under a law we don't want to live
[54:37] under carnal commandment amen faith is
[54:39] shut up under the law you the car that
[54:43] carnal Commandment that law cannot bring
[54:45] forth Faith to where we can actually
[54:47] rest in every Divine promise of God can
[54:52] you say amen amen how can you hold hold
[54:55] fast to your profession uh of faith that
[54:58] confession of faith when you're living
[55:00] by law amen you do good today but
[55:03] tomorrow you're going to fall somewhere
[55:04] amen and then in your own mind you're
[55:06] going to have to start back all over
[55:08] again and and it becomes a merit system
[55:10] and we all know how that goes I know how
[55:12] it is when I go on to die you know and
[55:14] and when you fall off the wagon then you
[55:16] have to like man I got to go it again
[55:18] you know and it's almost like you got to
[55:19] start all over again but do you realize
[55:22] that you don't have to start all over
[55:24] with God Amen God doesn't want you to
[55:27] have to start all over God wants us to
[55:31] be established in his grace can you say
[55:35] amen amen not not saying well well bless
[55:39] God I feel great today I I'm going in a
[55:41] Rapture oh I'm saved I'm I'm I'm
[55:44] Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost
[55:46] well what about tomorrow when you don't
[55:47] have them feelings what about tomorrow
[55:49] when you when you fall flat upon your
[55:51] face you've got to have something to
[55:53] maintain that that profession of Faith
[55:56] amen whether I feel like it or not I'm
[55:58] still going can you say Amen see God
[56:02] never intended for us to be legalist
[56:05] brother brandom said there's no scratch
[56:07] of legalist in the Bible amen it's it's
[56:10] it's I I'll be honest it's carnal Minds
[56:12] that finds legalism in the Bible but but
[56:15] but you'll never find in this message a
[56:18] true Revelation now when you get a true
[56:20] revelation of the message you'll never
[56:22] find legalism in the Bible can you Amen
[56:25] brother Bram said I'm calvinist and and
[56:27] he says now I'm legalist wherever the
[56:29] Bible is but he says I'm more I lean
[56:31] more to calvinist than I do the legalist
[56:33] side amen why because it it it you you
[56:37] you've got Amen to have your faith
[56:40] established in the grace of God in the
[56:43] works of God in the in the power of God
[56:47] Amen I find amen that legalism does not
[56:51] establish the people's faith in Christ
[56:54] amen if if if if there's you know uh you
[56:57] know we we were around that stuff of of
[56:59] legalism and things and and you never
[57:01] found people just SOL it in faith you
[57:04] you really never found them just
[57:06] anchored in faith it was just constantly
[57:08] oh please God I hope God I wish God I I
[57:11] I don't know and and and and you go go
[57:14] go look in into a lot of these guys that
[57:16] that do that they got the altars full of
[57:18] the same people just about every service
[57:22] amen because they're they fa somewhere
[57:26] and and if if you're looking at yourself
[57:29] amen you're you're going to fail every
[57:32] day and and well the prophet says you
[57:34] know we backslide every day and you know
[57:36] what it's good to it's good that a
[57:37] prophet would tell us that it's okay to
[57:41] say that right that we backslide every
[57:44] day amen see but legalism doesn't
[57:47] establish the people's faith in Christ
[57:50] but rather it in instead of pointing
[57:52] them to Christ it points them to to
[57:55] themselves brother Brown says well I
[57:56] might quit lying quit stealing quit
[57:58] committing adultery quit chewing quit
[58:00] all these things and I'm still carnal
[58:03] God doesn't receive it are you with me
[58:07] God doesn't receive it because I have
[58:10] nothing to offer him in
[58:13] propitiation oh my see how could we come
[58:16] into worship amen and truly come into
[58:19] the presence of God Amen based upon what
[58:22] we have done well thank God that don't
[58:25] smoke but that doesn't save you thank
[58:27] God you don't drink but that ain't
[58:29] meaning anything amen uh uh I know
[58:32] Sinners that have just totally quit
[58:33] smoking amen for any any kind of Reason
[58:36] maybe they just get tired of it or maybe
[58:38] they just trying to do it for their
[58:39] grandchild or the children now that
[58:41] they're born or you you never know amen
[58:44] but when you come to God you have to
[58:47] have something as a propitiation to
[58:50] bring to him and it ain't our works see
[58:54] see so legalism passes the work of
[58:57] redemption do you believe that so here
[59:01] here uh Hebrews 7 and 18 just breaking
[59:03] in Paul says there is verely a dising
[59:07] everybody say a dis analing of the
[59:09] Commandment going before for the
[59:12] weakness and profitable un
[59:14] unprofitableness thereof so there is a
[59:17] disining of that law there's a dising of
[59:20] that carnal commandment for the law made
[59:22] nothing perfect but notice but the
[59:25] bringing of a in of a better hope did
[59:29] now the prophet says now what is that
[59:31] better hope it's Christ amen that is the
[59:35] thing that would make us perfect the law
[59:37] made nothing perfect the carinal man
[59:40] commandment made nothing perfect amen it
[59:43] it only just caused man to to recognize
[59:47] more and more that he's a failure that
[59:48] he's a sinner that he's a no good
[59:50] individual well I want to tell you
[59:52] something there's more than just is
[59:54] coming to church and hearing and and
[59:57] feeling so rejected and so beat down
[1:00:00] that's not what church is for sure
[1:00:02] judgment begins at the house of God Amen
[1:00:05] but let Grace be preached let the blood
[1:00:08] be effective in a man's life to where we
[1:00:11] can leave he can he can leave feeling
[1:00:14] saved he knows that he's a Son of God
[1:00:16] he's a child of God can you say Amen so
[1:00:20] for the law made nothing perfect but the
[1:00:22] bringing in of a better did and that's
[1:00:25] Christ by the which we draw nigh unto
[1:00:29] God Amen now the prophet says that I
[1:00:32] won't keep you much longer but God God
[1:00:35] can only work through Perfection because
[1:00:38] he's perfect now you think of that here
[1:00:40] God chose man to work through man he
[1:00:43] only works through man he's man's going
[1:00:45] to carry out his plan man is going to
[1:00:47] carry out his his work and his purpose
[1:00:50] and man's got the ones that's got the
[1:00:53] ministry you're the one that's got a do
[1:00:54] it if anybody's got going to do it
[1:00:56] you're the one that's going to do it
[1:00:57] amen I I you know you you can you can
[1:01:00] sit there on the bench and cry your
[1:01:01] little hearts out and and say well I
[1:01:03] just don't know and you can feel
[1:01:05] helpless all you want but if you're part
[1:01:06] of the body of Christ God's depending
[1:01:09] upon you to do something now you
[1:01:10] remember what Moses done when he faced
[1:01:12] the Red Sea sat there and just bald and
[1:01:14] boohoo and all that and God got upset
[1:01:16] with him and Moses I'm the one that
[1:01:18] called you to do it why you sitting
[1:01:20] there calling me I put you on this
[1:01:22] commission now you go do it you you
[1:01:25] speak to that thing can you say Amen see
[1:01:28] so so we can get all down in the dumps
[1:01:30] and mly grubs and all of that and act
[1:01:33] like amen there ain't no hope and all
[1:01:35] that well if you're the bride of Christ
[1:01:37] God puts you in charge of the situation
[1:01:40] for you to speak to the mountain for you
[1:01:42] to say it for you he's the one that said
[1:01:45] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:01:47] that is in this world so don't sit there
[1:01:49] and bellyache about things look at the
[1:01:51] promise of God now God God see God chose
[1:01:56] man to work through but he can only work
[1:01:58] through Perfection amen because he's
[1:02:01] perfect now notice another place brother
[1:02:03] Brown said it has to be a perfect
[1:02:06] channel that God works through cuz he
[1:02:09] can do nothing else but work through
[1:02:12] Perfection so then that that leaves us
[1:02:15] into a what are we then amen see well
[1:02:18] then if we are the channel that God
[1:02:20] works through then he's got to have
[1:02:23] something Perfection Perfection oh to
[1:02:27] think of that God God would work through
[1:02:29] a perfect church God would work through
[1:02:33] a perfect individual God Amen if he
[1:02:36] chose you amen then he only chose you
[1:02:40] because he can work through
[1:02:42] you and yet God only works through
[1:02:45] Perfection through that which is perfect
[1:02:47] can you
[1:02:48] sayen so I hope this all right but
[1:02:52] Ephesians 1:4 Paul says according as he
[1:02:55] ha chosen Us in him before the
[1:02:57] foundation of the world that we should
[1:02:59] be what holy and with Without
[1:03:03] Blame before him everybody say before
[1:03:06] him amen a god that is Holy a God that
[1:03:10] can't stand sin a God that hates the
[1:03:12] very thought of sin that amen and and
[1:03:15] and yet our own righteousness is as
[1:03:18] filthy rags in his sight and yet he
[1:03:20] chose you amen before the foundation of
[1:03:23] the world that you should be holy and
[1:03:25] Without Blame sinless spotless blameless
[1:03:29] before not Shawn Martin not before the
[1:03:32] Deacon board not before the pope or the
[1:03:35] president and everybody who's and alls
[1:03:36] over you but before the very God that
[1:03:40] cannot stand the the the stench of sin
[1:03:43] can't even look upon sin without his
[1:03:46] wrath being exercised and yet he chose
[1:03:50] you to stand before him holy blameless
[1:03:54] less
[1:03:57] spotless
[1:03:59] good sir God had already chosen us to be
[1:04:04] that God holy and Without Blame before
[1:04:06] him in
[1:04:07] love if he chose us then the all-wise
[1:04:12] God and the Bible says he's the all wise
[1:04:15] God he wouldn't have done something
[1:04:18] beforehand I mean has ever done anything
[1:04:21] you know and and you really don't know
[1:04:23] what you're doing I I remember remember
[1:04:25] dad trying to be a shade tree
[1:04:32] mechanic we didn't know anything about
[1:04:35] cars but we were broke so he going to do
[1:04:38] it
[1:04:40] himself and me and me and Wendell of
[1:04:44] course was appointed to
[1:04:46] help and oh I hated that
[1:04:50] cold and then he had to yes bless my
[1:04:53] heart and and we we had to take out the
[1:04:58] transmission and so we're out bundled up
[1:05:01] you
[1:05:02] know and and we started fairly early
[1:05:05] that
[1:05:06] morning we finally got it all done out
[1:05:09] which was good and so we didn't have
[1:05:12] phones and all that to take a step by
[1:05:15] step and and so Dad would go into the
[1:05:20] house make a phone call and try to get
[1:05:22] some ideas and porner and then we'd go
[1:05:25] out there and we would put that puppy up
[1:05:28] and and and you know it it was a um it
[1:05:32] was a uh a not an automatic a manual
[1:05:35] where you had to stab that thing in
[1:05:37] there and that transmission and oh it
[1:05:40] was a mess we finally got it stabbed in
[1:05:43] there and I'm
[1:05:44] secretly you know and and we get all the
[1:05:47] boats but that last one and then you
[1:05:51] know as we're looking around starting me
[1:05:52] and windows already cleaning up I mean
[1:05:54] you know Dad's got this we're done you
[1:05:56] know and then we see this part and and
[1:06:00] we say now dad what what do you think
[1:06:02] this is and he looks at it and stares at
[1:06:05] it for a little bit and he says boys we
[1:06:08] got to redo it got to do it again like
[1:06:11] Dad you you got to be kidding don't you
[1:06:13] think that thing will run without this
[1:06:15] no no we got to redo it you know I
[1:06:18] remember I remember you know we done it
[1:06:20] five times taking that crazy thing out
[1:06:23] you know I really wanted to kick them
[1:06:25] tires you know and and the in the
[1:06:27] transmission too but but see we we
[1:06:30] didn't know what we were doing so so we
[1:06:33] always had to take but see here was God
[1:06:35] that had already chosen us to be without
[1:06:37] spot wrinkle or blemish he had already
[1:06:39] chose us to be holy and Without Blame
[1:06:42] before him in love and he done that
[1:06:44] before anything happened and so then if
[1:06:48] he had done that then he's already got a
[1:06:51] he's already prepared a way to make us
[1:06:54] into this this place ain't that right
[1:06:57] and and this is why the scripture is so
[1:07:00] uh important and and yet so very well
[1:07:03] known is John 3:16 for God so loved the
[1:07:07] world right God so loved so this
[1:07:10] preparation came from his love it it
[1:07:13] wasn't just something I well I guess I'd
[1:07:15] better do it because I've already done
[1:07:16] this no no it it was a love amen and so
[1:07:20] the prophet said when his love was
[1:07:22] projected to the world Grace stepped in
[1:07:25] and produced a savior see that's the
[1:07:28] only way that could have re produced a a
[1:07:31] kinsman redeemer it wasn't that that he
[1:07:34] had to do it it was his love that done
[1:07:36] it amen and he said see God wanted to
[1:07:39] see you well so much and I I want you to
[1:07:42] see that God wants to see you well so
[1:07:46] much amen God wants to see you saved so
[1:07:49] much God God wants you to make it to
[1:07:51] heaven so much God wants you to to be
[1:07:54] restored back into Fellowship so much
[1:07:57] amen it's his love see his love went out
[1:08:00] and it produced an atonement for your
[1:08:02] sickness as well as your sins amen it
[1:08:05] was the love of God that constrained him
[1:08:08] to do it can you say Amen so God would
[1:08:11] now become our kinsman redeemer because
[1:08:15] there was nothing else that could amen
[1:08:17] and there was no man no matter how
[1:08:19] righteous they were no matter how good
[1:08:21] will and determined or whatever amen
[1:08:24] there's no man that could have done it
[1:08:26] so God would create himself amen be
[1:08:29] himself our kinsman redeemer so as we
[1:08:32] talked about it the Holy Ghost the
[1:08:34] brother Braham said overshadowed Mary
[1:08:37] amen and created a blood cell woman did
[1:08:40] not have anything to do with this amen
[1:08:43] uh uh uh and and and man had nothing to
[1:08:46] do with it and and so then it was a
[1:08:49] created blood cell in the womb of that
[1:08:52] woman of and and as as the prophet told
[1:08:55] us that Mary really wasn't even the
[1:08:57] mother of Jesus Amen she was just the
[1:08:59] incubator amen for God God just borrowed
[1:09:03] her womb amen so he could become the
[1:09:06] kinsman redeemer a ain't that right and
[1:09:10] so through that blood cell came our
[1:09:12] kinsman redeemer now notice Hebrews 9
[1:09:15] and 24 amen break it in Christ is not
[1:09:18] entered into the holy places with made
[1:09:21] with hands amen which are the figures of
[1:09:24] the true but into heaven itself now to
[1:09:26] appear appear in the presence of God for
[1:09:29] us see not nor yet that he should offer
[1:09:33] sin uh offer himself often as the high
[1:09:36] priest entereth into the holy place
[1:09:38] every year with blood of others see uh
[1:09:41] uh uh for then he must for then must he
[1:09:45] often have suffered since the foundation
[1:09:47] of the world but now once in the end of
[1:09:50] the world hath he appeared to put away
[1:09:54] sin by the sacrifice of himself aren't
[1:09:57] you glad for that amen we're part of
[1:10:00] that see now Acts 20 and 28 take heed
[1:10:03] unto yourselves andto all the flock over
[1:10:05] the the the which the Holy Ghost has
[1:10:07] made you overseers to feed the Church of
[1:10:09] God which Heath purchased with his own
[1:10:12] blood there there's so many scriptures
[1:10:15] here that that that apply and and to
[1:10:17] speak of it not just with blood you he
[1:10:19] didn't purchase you with blood he
[1:10:22] purchased you with this own blood and
[1:10:25] you say Amen to let it know let you know
[1:10:27] that he could be our kinsman redeemer he
[1:10:29] could be our lamb he but yet not the the
[1:10:33] blood of an animal amen a natural animal
[1:10:36] he could be our a kinsman redeemer a man
[1:10:39] and yet not have the the the the the
[1:10:41] sexual blood as you and I it's his own
[1:10:46] blood his own blood Lord amen Hebrews
[1:10:51] 13:12 wherefore Jesus also that he might
[1:10:53] might sanctify the people with his own
[1:10:55] blood suffered without the gate ain't
[1:10:57] that right Revelations 1:5 and from
[1:11:00] Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness
[1:11:02] and the first begotten of the dead and
[1:11:03] the prince of the kings of the earth
[1:11:05] unto him that loved us washed us from
[1:11:07] our sins in his own blood thank God we
[1:11:10] had a prophet to let us know what that
[1:11:12] really meant it loosed us from our sins
[1:11:16] aren't you glad for that so now God is
[1:11:19] giv us uh something that we could that
[1:11:22] is stable that something something that
[1:11:24] is concrete something that is perfect
[1:11:26] that we could rest our faith upon amen
[1:11:29] and no matter what comes and no matter
[1:11:31] what goes we can maintain our profession
[1:11:34] of Faith ain't that right amen Hebrews
[1:11:39] 911 Christ being come and high priest of
[1:11:42] good things to come by a greater and
[1:11:44] more perfect Tabernacle not made with
[1:11:47] hands that is to say not of this
[1:11:49] building neither by the blood of goats
[1:11:51] and calves but by his own blood he
[1:11:54] entered in once into the holy Place
[1:11:56] having obtained everybody say he
[1:11:58] obtained Eternal
[1:12:00] Redemption something that had never been
[1:12:03] done before something that couldn't even
[1:12:04] been spoken of under the law amen
[1:12:07] because who who could really grasp that
[1:12:09] amen but now under the shed blood Amen
[1:12:12] on this other side there's the
[1:12:14] Revelation that this was the lamb this
[1:12:17] was that perfect sacrifice this was the
[1:12:21] perfect kinsman redeemer and now we have
[1:12:24] eternal
[1:12:26] Redemption Eternal Redemption all fear
[1:12:28] of being lost is gone all fear of going
[1:12:31] to hell is gone all fear of being left
[1:12:34] behind and going into tribulation is
[1:12:37] gone all fear of sin and sickness and
[1:12:40] sorrow is gone because we have been
[1:12:44] obtained Eternal
[1:12:46] Redemption can you say man by his own
[1:12:49] blood by his own blood God was able to
[1:12:53] create a
[1:12:54] blood amen didn't need us didn't need
[1:12:57] woman didn't need anything he created
[1:12:59] his own blood Amen to bring us an
[1:13:02] eternal Redemption amen for if the blood
[1:13:06] of bulls and goats and uh the ashes of
[1:13:09] an hepher sprinkling the unclean
[1:13:11] Sanctified to the P purifying of the
[1:13:13] flesh how much more shall the blood of
[1:13:15] Christ who through the eternal spirit
[1:13:18] offered himself without spot to God
[1:13:21] Purge your conscience from dead works to
[1:13:23] serve the Living God and for this cause
[1:13:26] he is the mediator of the New Testament
[1:13:28] see amen that by means of death for the
[1:13:31] Redemption of the transgressions that
[1:13:33] were under the first testament they
[1:13:36] which are called might receive the
[1:13:38] promise of Eternal inheritance so as as
[1:13:42] the prophet said his blood his blood is
[1:13:44] the only thing that will make atonement
[1:13:48] and he says it was a power of God that
[1:13:51] was made blood amen the power of God
[1:13:55] that was made blood that he might take
[1:13:57] away your sinful Blood by sexual desire
[1:14:01] and make you a free man and woman of God
[1:14:05] how many believes you're
[1:14:06] free amen you're free not just tonight
[1:14:10] but tomorrow and and not just tomorrow
[1:14:13] but the next day and the next day you're
[1:14:16] free forever it's an eternal
[1:14:19] Redemption and you sayen see think of
[1:14:22] that he might take take away your sinful
[1:14:24] Blood by sexual desire take away that to
[1:14:28] where amen see so he's able to to to
[1:14:31] obtain Eternal Redemption now so brother
[1:14:34] brandom says see since it is the blood
[1:14:36] of God not the blood of animal not the
[1:14:38] blood of a human but it's the blood of
[1:14:41] God then it is perfect blood and if it's
[1:14:45] perfect blood that is loosening us then
[1:14:48] from the power and bondage and
[1:14:50] defilement of sin then the loosing is
[1:14:52] perfect and
[1:14:55] complete perfect and complete perfect
[1:14:58] and
[1:14:59] complete can you say
[1:15:01] Amen you can't have faith when you're
[1:15:04] worrying amen God wants us to get past
[1:15:07] the
[1:15:08] worrying well I just don't know what's
[1:15:10] going to happen to me quit worrying
[1:15:11] about it there's a perfect
[1:15:15] blood oh God Amen and so this this
[1:15:19] perfect blood brought forth a perfect
[1:15:22] loosening right yes divorce the sin from
[1:15:27] us now notice Psalms 103:12 as far as
[1:15:31] the East is from the West so far hath he
[1:15:34] removed our transgressions from
[1:15:38] usen
[1:15:40] it not not not not just leave you take
[1:15:44] you know separate you from your sin and
[1:15:45] then your sin is just right next to you
[1:15:48] that's all baggage following you
[1:15:51] around but he's so separated your sin
[1:15:54] that there's no end to it I mean he's
[1:15:57] taken it as far as the East is to the
[1:16:01] West aren't you glad for
[1:16:04] that so then Romans
[1:16:06] 3:24 being justified freely by his grace
[1:16:09] through the Redemption that is in Christ
[1:16:13] Jesus whom God has set forth to be a
[1:16:16] propitiation through faith in his blood
[1:16:20] Amen to declare his right righteousness
[1:16:23] for the remission of sins that are
[1:16:25] passed through the forbearance of God
[1:16:29] see so we've Now by his own blood have
[1:16:33] been Justified freely by not a carnal
[1:16:36] commandment but by Grace prise the Lord
[1:16:40] ain't that right and we the prophet
[1:16:42] would let us know what Justified is as
[1:16:44] though you never done it in the first
[1:16:45] place that's exactly what Justified
[1:16:48] means you never did it in the first
[1:16:51] place God provided a remedy Hallelujah
[1:16:55] to destroy the sin amen praise the
[1:17:01] Lord amen see the prophet said his death
[1:17:04] gave us the
[1:17:06] blood now there's nothing to be
[1:17:08] condemned
[1:17:09] for because the blood has loosed us from
[1:17:12] sin we're
[1:17:14] free we are
[1:17:16] Guiltless don't listen to man listen to
[1:17:19] the word amen you are loosed by the
[1:17:25] blood yes amen
[1:17:27] amen and through the blood God's able to
[1:17:30] bring forth a perfect channel on Earth
[1:17:33] today that he could work his purpose
[1:17:36] through Hallelujah can you say
[1:17:38] Amen so you say well what about the
[1:17:41] mistakes what what about all these
[1:17:43] things surely God's angry surely that
[1:17:46] God can't have anything to do with me
[1:17:50] you
[1:17:51] know who are you
[1:17:53] who am
[1:17:55] I well we
[1:17:59] have the prophet has told us over and
[1:18:01] over and over you're the Bride of Jesus
[1:18:03] Christ am so much that he called us miss
[1:18:06] Jesus Christ in this
[1:18:08] day he preached the message the
[1:18:11] invisible Union of the Bride
[1:18:13] amen you are the bride of Christ and
[1:18:16] you're that by predestination amen you
[1:18:19] believe that so then everyone who is
[1:18:23] part of the bride of Christ has had
[1:18:25] their name written in the Lamb's Book of
[1:18:27] Life before the foundation of the world
[1:18:29] they are the predestinated ones and and
[1:18:31] and if you are predestinated to be in
[1:18:33] that bride then here's the thing you
[1:18:37] were chosen in Christ before the
[1:18:39] foundation of the world Amen I believe
[1:18:42] now to me that that is
[1:18:45] significant because we were in him see
[1:18:49] the prophet said see he come to redeem
[1:18:52] or to bring to life those predestinated
[1:18:55] seed that God seen before the foundation
[1:18:58] world and put their names in the Lamb's
[1:18:59] Book of Life see so God showed in the
[1:19:02] beginning of creation that woman is part
[1:19:05] of man she was in
[1:19:07] man God didn't make her apart from man
[1:19:10] he put her in man amen praise the Lord
[1:19:14] and at the due time he took her out of
[1:19:17] man ain't that right see so so then then
[1:19:21] it shows that that when Jesus he came to
[1:19:25] redeem his bride he come to redeem all
[1:19:29] that were in
[1:19:31] him ain't that right so he didn't do
[1:19:33] this half-heartedly he knew exactly what
[1:19:35] he was
[1:19:38] doing he he went to Calvary with
[1:19:42] purpose he he didn't say well I'm going
[1:19:44] to go to Calvary hoping that someone
[1:19:46] will accept what I've done no no no
[1:19:49] no that's what the world paints today as
[1:19:52] a pitiful
[1:19:53] Christ that is begging for people to
[1:19:57] come but he's the one that said all that
[1:20:00] the father hath given me shall come I've
[1:20:03] not lost the one they're going to
[1:20:06] come and and he held to that that that
[1:20:10] profession of
[1:20:12] Faith him going to Calvary knowing that
[1:20:16] he was going with a a people in mind yes
[1:20:19] sir yes sir ain't that right prise see
[1:20:23] so so he come to redeem that bride and
[1:20:26] that bride was in him we were in him
[1:20:30] ain't that right see so the prophet said
[1:20:33] see in God's Own thinking God the great
[1:20:35] spirit in the beginning before there was
[1:20:36] the beginning he was God and did you
[1:20:38] know that you were in him then see if
[1:20:41] you're a Christian now you was in him
[1:20:43] then see then if that be so the whole
[1:20:46] godhead bodily shaped up in the person
[1:20:48] of Christ see then when Christ died at
[1:20:52] the cross I died with him for I was in
[1:20:55] him then amen see for he was the
[1:20:58] fullness of the word manifested knowing
[1:21:00] that we would be manifested
[1:21:02] later ain't that right see so we was at
[1:21:07] Calvary with him we went in the grave
[1:21:10] with him we raised with him in his
[1:21:14] resurrection ain't that right and now
[1:21:17] we've ascended by his Spirit to the
[1:21:19] throne of grac amise isn't that what
[1:21:23] Paul said come to the throne of grace
[1:21:25] boldly well how do you get there you've
[1:21:28] ascended up there yes sir amen sitting

[1:21:40] from father to father to father to
[1:21:41] father so is the Life of Christ gerti
[1:21:45] that's the reason God uses Elijah's
[1:21:47] Spirit five different times what is it
[1:21:49] it's the handing down see just as your
[1:21:52] natural life life and traits is handed
[1:21:53] down from the natural breeding of your
[1:21:55] father so is the spirit of God that was
[1:21:57] predestinated before the foundation of

[1:22:10] he says when the entire word of God
[1:22:13] incomplete was headed up in a human body
[1:22:15] called Jesus Christ in there God made me
[1:22:20] pay for my sins in him
[1:22:23] there aren't you glad for that in him
[1:22:28] there I paid for my
[1:22:30] sins there's nothing to pay for

[1:22:50] then amen you you paid for it it's done
[1:22:54] it's a finished
[1:22:55] work Lord ain't that right so then he
[1:23:00] rose me raised me up with him in the
[1:23:04] resurrection and now we are seated with
[1:23:07] him with power and authority over every
[1:23:12] devil do you understand that did it get
[1:23:14] really to you you're sitting brother
[1:23:17] Bill in Heavenly places with power over
[1:23:19] every
[1:23:20] devil name the devil
[1:23:23] just name him what little wimp or imp of
[1:23:26] the devil is bothering you
[1:23:30] right well if you're seated in Heavenly
[1:23:32] places this isn't just something a
[1:23:35] message a quote or brother B just trying
[1:23:38] to tickle our fancy this is reality to
[1:23:40] the bride of Christ amen can you say
[1:23:44] Amen see now he says see we are now
[1:23:47] seated with him with power and authority
[1:23:49] over every devil oh if you could only
[1:23:52] believe what God has given you that's
[1:23:54] right see but if you're not seated there
[1:23:56] then you don't have it but if you're
[1:23:58] seated there and don't believe it and
[1:24:00] afraid to move you'll never use it but
[1:24:01] no then notice what he says but if you
[1:24:03] are seated there you will use it for
[1:24:06] you're ordained to do what you
[1:24:09] do you realize that God ordained you to
[1:24:13] defeat the
[1:24:15] Devil he finally found a channel that he
[1:24:17] could perfectly work
[1:24:19] through he was been able to trip up
[1:24:22] every all the prophets all the sages of
[1:24:25] old and all these things amen he's been
[1:24:27] able to trip them up but now there is a
[1:24:29] bride on this Earth that God has been
[1:24:31] able to
[1:24:33] perfect you will
[1:24:36] overcome you
[1:24:39] will praise God that's right you say
[1:24:42] Amen so then the prophet says this he
[1:24:45] said do you
[1:24:47] realize that when MDC appeared to
[1:24:51] Abraham and talking to him
[1:24:53] and he told him that you're going to
[1:24:55] have a son through Sarah and she laughs
[1:24:57] in the tent she laughed at God and the
[1:25:02] prophet said God would have killed her
[1:25:04] right
[1:25:05] then but he couldn't do it because it
[1:25:07] would have hurt
[1:25:09] Abraham she was part of
[1:25:13] Abraham now God you see through all
[1:25:16] these types and shadows God letting know
[1:25:18] you know how secure you are
[1:25:20] right he couldn't touch her because of
[1:25:23] Abraham now she was only part of a
[1:25:25] natural man ain't that right but notice
[1:25:29] he says see that's the reason our sins
[1:25:32] today we would every one of us be
[1:25:35] condemned but God can't take
[1:25:39] us can you say that with me God can't
[1:25:41] take
[1:25:42] us because if he does he hurts
[1:25:46] Christ see we're part of him we're the
[1:25:49] bride don't you see it so there it is so
[1:25:52] Grace everybody say grace holds us in
[1:25:56] our mistakes until we can see better
[1:25:59] amen Grace holds us in our
[1:26:04] mistakes cuz he knows we're going to
[1:26:07] come to
[1:26:09] it can you say amen amen so he says we
[1:26:13] are perfected with our sacrifice he
[1:26:16] makes no
[1:26:19] mistakes he wouldn't bring you in if you
[1:26:22] wasn't worthy he knows your heart that's
[1:26:25] right he knows what you are he knows
[1:26:27] your motives he knows what you are
[1:26:29] there's traps all along the road sure
[1:26:31] the devil will cause you to stumble and
[1:26:33] you say I didn't mean to do that God see
[1:26:36] you you know it see what you're still
[1:26:40] perfect you good think about it you're
[1:26:43] still
[1:26:44] perfect this this is what he's done with
[1:26:46] his own blood amen for you thank you
[1:26:50] you're still perfect because there's a
[1:26:52] perfect blood offered for you every
[1:26:55] day that's right by who our great high
[1:27:01] priest amen and a bleeding sacrifice
[1:27:04] hanging Before the Throne of God
[1:27:08] Almighty another place he says the
[1:27:10] church is the blood of Christ by the
[1:27:13] spirit because the life is in the
[1:27:16] blood that shows that the blood of
[1:27:18] Christ atones for you because his life
[1:27:21] is in you
[1:27:22] and he's not just in in in human blood
[1:27:26] sexual blood he's in his own
[1:27:30] blood you've got the his blood flowing
[1:27:33] through your
[1:27:34] veins and his life just like a human
[1:27:38] life couldn't flow through animal
[1:27:41] blood sir ain't that right so God's
[1:27:45] blood is in us and the spirit Bears
[1:27:48] record that we have his blood atoning
[1:27:51] for for
[1:27:53] us so the church is the blood of Christ
[1:27:56] by the spirit because the life is in the
[1:27:58] blood amen that's the baptism of the
[1:28:00] Holy Ghost that baptized us into his
[1:28:02] body that that recognizes only his body
[1:28:06] his flesh his word denomination won't
[1:28:09] never touch that it's a revelation and
[1:28:11] she knows it so did Eve know it but she
[1:28:13] fell but this one knows it and won't
[1:28:16] fall amen she's ordained amen hallelujah
[1:28:21] she is ordained not to fall she won't
[1:28:22] fail she is predestinated to it and
[1:28:25] blessed is the man whom God will not
[1:28:28] impute sin amen aren't you glad for
[1:28:31] that Daniel 11:32 breaking in but he
[1:28:35] says the people that do know their God
[1:28:37] shall be strong and do
[1:28:40] exploits I like what brother brandham
[1:28:43] he's he's preaching in that Hebrew
[1:28:46] series and he said it's just not knowing
[1:28:49] god but it's knowing god in his
[1:28:51] perfection
[1:28:53] knowing god in his Perfection see the
[1:28:56] the the wicked will not know the god of
[1:28:59] Heaven see the prophet said they know
[1:29:01] him in a form and in a
[1:29:04] ritual but they don't know him by the
[1:29:07] way of
[1:29:08] perfection but here we've been allowed
[1:29:12] we've been blessed by the grace of God
[1:29:15] to know him in his Perfection by his
[1:29:20] Perfection amen
[1:29:22] oh do you love him amen that's
[1:29:25] good so he says see God can do nothing
[1:29:28] else but work through Perfection he
[1:29:30] can't stain himself in any way
[1:29:33] am you think of that God living in you
[1:29:36] has already made a way so he wouldn't
[1:29:39] stain
[1:29:41] himself God coming in you is a testimony
[1:29:46] testifying is proof that he has come up
[1:29:49] with something that it will not hurt him
[1:29:53] he's holy amen he's un he's
[1:29:58] undefiled he can't
[1:30:00] change and then he comes into US mortal
[1:30:04] beings because he found a
[1:30:07] way that it wouldn't blemish him at all
[1:30:11] amen praise the Lord and he says that's
[1:30:14] why Jesus came to take away our sins
[1:30:16] that we might be perfected that God
[1:30:18] could work through his church there is
[1:30:21] is where the secret lays amen if the
[1:30:25] musician will come prise the
[1:30:29] Lord Hebrews 12:2 it says looking unto
[1:30:32] Jesus the author and finisher of our
[1:30:35] faith who for the joy that was set
[1:30:37] before him endured the cross despising
[1:30:39] the shame and and sat down at the right
[1:30:40] hand of God the right hand of the Throne
[1:30:43] of God so then we must not look to
[1:30:46] anything else but him don't look to
[1:30:49] yourself don't don't look to the
[1:30:51] preacher don't don't look to and and I
[1:30:54] say don't even look to a
[1:30:56] prophet looking un Jesus amen the author
[1:30:59] and the finisher of our
[1:31:01] faith anything else is going to
[1:31:03] fail he is your accepted
[1:31:07] sacrifice you believe that amen he's the
[1:31:10] one who met God's requirement for sin
[1:31:13] he's the one that paid it he's the one
[1:31:16] amen he's the only one that appeases
[1:31:17] God's
[1:31:18] Wrath now brother Brandon talks
[1:31:22] about the law of redemption and what it
[1:31:25] really
[1:31:26] means he said under the Old Law of
[1:31:28] redemption he said let's just say a
[1:31:30] mother horse has given birth to a
[1:31:36] colt and that
[1:31:39] cold he's a mule and his ears are
[1:31:42] hanging down his knees are knocked
[1:31:45] together his eyes are
[1:31:46] crossed what a
[1:31:48] mu now that little fella if he could
[1:31:51] think and he'd say wow look look look
[1:31:53] what I am I won't even be able to
[1:31:57] live I mean that poor little fell he's
[1:32:00] just so messed
[1:32:02] upk
[1:32:04] Lord he says well when the man of the
[1:32:07] house the owner when he comes out and he
[1:32:09] sees me why he's going to knock me in
[1:32:11] the head he'll never feed me he won't
[1:32:14] care for
[1:32:15] me you know now if the old mother was
[1:32:19] instructed right by the laws of God she
[1:32:21] would say now wait a minute honey you
[1:32:24] know what the high priest will never see
[1:32:27] [Music]
[1:32:29] you he will never see you but you're
[1:32:33] born with a birth Birthright you're my
[1:32:35] cult and you're my first one you have a
[1:32:37] Birthright right now what if the man
[1:32:41] comes out and sees him oh there's a
[1:32:43] horrible looking
[1:32:45] mule now what happens he has to go get a
[1:32:49] lamb a perfect lamb L without blemish he
[1:32:53] has to take it down to the high priest
[1:32:55] and the Lamb's throat is cut the lamb
[1:32:58] died so the mule can live why it was
[1:33:01] born with the
[1:33:03] birthright they never examine the mule
[1:33:07] they examine the
[1:33:09] lamb the priest ain't looking at the
[1:33:12] mule for Perfection he's looking for
[1:33:15] perfection in the
[1:33:18] L so he don't care about the mule
[1:33:22] he's not there to examine the mule he's
[1:33:24] there to look at the lamb
[1:33:26] right now the prophet said see you Bible
[1:33:29] readers know that that is under the laws
[1:33:31] of
[1:33:32] redemption in the New Testament no
[1:33:35] matter what's wrong with you don't look
[1:33:38] at
[1:33:39] yourself look at your
[1:33:43] lamb then he ask the question can you
[1:33:46] find fault with
[1:33:48] him can you find fault with the lamb can
[1:33:51] can you find fault with the work of
[1:33:53] Calvary can you find fault with his
[1:33:55] presence here
[1:33:57] tonight his manifestation of today Among
[1:34:03] Us he says God don't look at you he
[1:34:06] looks at the
[1:34:08] lamb so if there's no fault in the
[1:34:11] lamb there's no fault with
[1:34:14] you can you say Amen there's no fault
[1:34:17] with the lamb then there's no fault with
[1:34:19] you so then half Faith he says have
[1:34:24] faith amen rise up and claim your
[1:34:28] god-given
[1:34:31] privilege no matter what it looks like
[1:34:34] how feel how sick you feel how advanced
[1:34:38] how far Advanced your faith is you can
[1:34:41] be
[1:34:43] healed you can receive whatever you have
[1:34:46] need of if you just look at your
[1:34:50] lamb amen don't find fault with the
[1:34:54] [Music]
[1:34:56] lamb don't be dissatisfied with your
[1:35:00] lamb you imagine that worshipper having
[1:35:04] to bring the lamb to the high
[1:35:07] priest for it for the for that that
[1:35:09] worship for that high priest to make
[1:35:11] intercession for
[1:35:13] him and he had to be identified that
[1:35:16] worshipper had to be identified with the
[1:35:17] lamb he had to lay his hands upon that
[1:35:20] head of that lamb while the the priest
[1:35:22] is cutting that throat the blood
[1:35:24] squirting all over that worshipper the
[1:35:26] worshipper had to be identified with his
[1:35:27] lamb but he brings the lamb up there and
[1:35:30] then he says you know what I don't think
[1:35:31] I need that lamb I don't want that lamb
[1:35:34] let's go look for something else there
[1:35:35] could be no intercession
[1:35:37] done ain't that right the lamb was there
[1:35:41] for him amen and if he if he could bring
[1:35:45] that lamb before that high priest and
[1:35:48] say I know it's right and the high Prest
[1:35:51] priest examine that lamb and say yep
[1:35:53] you're right it's
[1:35:55] right then he can make the
[1:35:58] intercession and that worshipper could
[1:36:00] be free he could lift his hands unto God
[1:36:03] and have fellowship with God but how
[1:36:05] much greater when God is already proven
[1:36:09] that he's accepted that
[1:36:11] sacrifice he's already said it's done
[1:36:15] it's over it's
[1:36:17] finished what do you say about that
[1:36:20] lamb I say he's perfect amen then hold
[1:36:24] fast your profession of faith without
[1:36:26] wavering can you say Amen you love him
[1:36:30] am praise the Lord what

[1:40:35] there ain't no sin but when God himself
[1:40:37] is telling us what sin are you talking

[1:40:49] she was trying to tell her Prophet how
[1:40:52] bad she was and how unworthy she was and
[1:40:54] what a wretched sinner she was and on
[1:40:58] and on and the prophet said but but I've
[1:41:00] searched your life there ain't nothing
[1:41:03] there what was it it was the word of God
[1:41:06] searching that woman's
[1:41:08] life and and yet she the devil was
[1:41:11] telling her that she was The Sinner the
[1:41:13] devil was telling her bringing up all of
[1:41:15] her past failures but God was saying
[1:41:17] through that Prophet there is no sin if
[1:41:21] we could understand that tonight that
[1:41:23] the blood of Calvary has so washed us
[1:41:26] clean that there is no
