Praise the Lord so amen I'm glad that um God's got young people on the battlefield too amen serving the lord amen the musicians be dismissed and I trust you had a good day today amen and if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to Second Kings amen the uh fourth chapter praise the Lord amen um Second Kings 4 and uh we'll start at the 18th verse and when the child was grown it fell on a day that he went out to his father to the Reapers and he said unto his father my head my head and he said unto a lad carry him to his mother and when he had taken him and brought him to his mother he sat on her knees till noon and then died and she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God and shut the door upon him and went out and she called unto her husband and said send me I pray thee one of the the young men and one of the asses that I may run to the man of God and come again and he said wherefore wilt thou go to him today it is neither New Moon uh nor Sabbath and she said it shall be well then she saddled an ass and said unto her servant drive and go forward slack not thy writing for me except I bid thee so she went and came unto the man of God to Mount Caramel and it came to pass when the man of God saw her a far off that he said to Gesa his servant behold Yonder is that shunamite run now I pray thee to meet her and say unto her is it well with thee is it well with thy husband is it well with the child and she answered It is Well amen let's just bow our heads unto the Lord father truly it is good to be in your house again this evening and now we ask that you would take what simple words that we would have and may it be life to all of us Lord I pray that your anointing would be here and anoint me as I would Endeavor to speak your word pray that you would anoint the congregation father may we leave here closer to you better Christians father I pray that you would build our faith up even to a higher level than it's ever been in Jesus Christ's name amen you can have your seats and I'm not going to uh be long uh but just thinking of this uh scripture uh it is well and uh I think the the attitude her attitude is is of all of that uh of of the bride of Christ today and U here of course she wasn't able to have a child and uh but she uh if you noticed um and we didn't read it but um she had U found uh something special about this man and uh no doubt had heard about him and maybe even listen to some of his sermons I don't know but she knew that this man was a prophet and that uh God was with him and so she knew that he would come by uh their way and she wanted to do something special for him and so um she had asked her husband and if they could build a room or something for him to to come uh when he was through the area and so it was that they done that the Lord and so uh the prophet uh wanted to do something for her because uh she had been kind and so as we know uh she said nothing you know of course then she wasn't doing it for something she just out of a good heart wanted to do something for the Lord and um um so the servant said well she's Barren she can't have child and then the Lord spoke through that Prophet you will have a child and of course if you uh read there she she when when he told this the lady lady that she said now don't lie to me you know don't don't lie to me and and he said well you shall surely have a child and um and she took that to heart I'm going to have a child and so this is where we're at in in the the deal but also uh when the child got sick if you notice she did not give up she didn't say well the Lord did give me a child and and so you know I'm just happy with what he gave me and allowed me to have but she thought no no if God gave me that child then I can still that child should live death ain't going to take that child away from me and because the prophet was still in the land she she knew that if I could get to that Prophet if I could just you know and and I think it's interesting that uh you know the prophet said well why why you know when she got to the prophet then she just she said all is well and he said well what would make her say that and and he says because she got in the presence of the prophet and she knew that everything's going to be fine and well why is that is that because she was worshiping a man is it because that uh you know uh uh you know whatever no it wasn't that it was that she knew that the word of of the Lord come to a prophet and and she knew that you know a prophet had more and I I'll say it this way Prophet has more superiority over anything over a king over over a doctor over um uh uh a preacher a bishop uh whatever because the words that a prophet would speak would be the word of God so it's coming from a Supreme Being and more than just a a prophet ain't that right amen and so she knew that if if she could just get to that Prophet now I I there a lot of things that we could say out of this uh text and and things and uh but but one of the things that I I I think of is of of of of the respect that she had uh toward the man of God she but also in the situation that she had no was in look at the the the response and the attitude that she had uh toward him she she could have went all kinds of ways when she got to that Prophet she could have said man you lied to me you know or or you know I you just let me down and and on and on and on she could have berated the prophet of God she she could have done anything but instead of doing these things her her respect amen caused her uh uh uh to say all is well all is well everything's going to be fine I mean her baby's dead laying laying at home her husband don't know what to do uh the prophet described in one place that he's just walking the floors ringing his hands and and and and you know I mean their son just died and yet uh uh her Fai stayed in contact and stayed intact because of her respect now you know the word of the Lord comes to us and we've we've had a prophet in this age say many many things uh gave us many promises uh we were we were kind of like that woman baren uh in many ways and and uh I I think uh we we were in in worse shape in a lot of ways because of of uh that was in a natural sense but here we were caught up in in all kinds of things whether it if you come from a denomination if you were taught in in the ways of the world or the ways of of man and and false doctrines and things like that and and you know uh uh what hope did we have but then you know we hear the words began to come from a prophet's mouth in this age a word Prophet not just any Prophet but a word prophet and and he began to speak promises over our lives uh you you you are the bride of Christ uh you you got a future home man he he wasn't just describing the home he was describing it for a people right and I believe I'm one of them he he was trying to show us what our home is what our future is it's one thing for a man to talk about it but then when he starts pointing and making it personal you know to you and you know and and and I think like I you know uh Elisha could have just told a woman well a woman's going to have a child well okay a woman's going to have a child but it didn't make it anything personal to her but when he said you're going to have that child then that's different and this is what this message does is to us I think I take the message in a personal way because I believe it's promises for me and and you know like to say is listening to brother brandom talk of the uh uh uh going beyond the curtain of time he is having brother Neville to read the vision and I don't know as as I was just listening you know something just began to just rise up in my heart and I thought oh God I want to press the battle and I want to do all that I can I uh I want to make it I I just do and well why because to me that's personal to me that he's telling of where I'm going and and he's describing uh a place that I long to be and there's just something that starts connecting me with that and and and I yearn so so there's promises here that that come from a prophet not speaking of any age but your age us we are that people do you believe that we are the people that all the promises of God have given I the the Rapture Who who how many would have longed to to be part of that as a group of people that never go taste death never and actually have a changing of the body amen and yet we are that people here on Earth we are seeing things like like never before but yet because we have these promises and we feel good when we hear them uh uh maybe a a minister preaching and and talking about them or we're hearing it on tape and whatever and it's good when the Lord just comes and he and he and he just uh uh excites us it the word of God should always excite us uh no matter how many times we've heard it it it should do something for us because it's always a reminder of where we're going and what's happening and that we're not in the world and but yet yet the word of the Lord is always um we're going to go through things in life that's that's and this is where this lady was is God had given her the promise yes the promise come uh she had that baby but now Satan was death was trying to take the child but but she just would not look at that and just call it quits she wouldn't call it that and but she would hold to that promise yeah she kept that promise dear to her and I think that's where we're at today is that that uh uh yes God gave you know the prophet's been gone a long time now uh uh I don't know how many years been been quite a while and and we just it just seemed like it's just one trial after another it's just one thing after another and now God does answer our prayers we've we I think all of us and hearing sister Brenda uh today give her testimony and and then uh uh brother shemiah and sister Bethany and her testimony sister Jane's got her we've all got our testimonies of what God has done for us and that's that's that's wonderful but but when the Trials come you you you just can't call it quits and and and and just say well God's been good to me this far and so now you know and then we just accept what a lot allotted to us that maybe Satan's trying to give to us I just don't think we we ought to say no to the devil I I think if if God gave us a promise we ought to hang on to it I I'm glad that I've enjoyed my Christianity this far but uh I don't expect the de I ain't going to let the devil take my joy from me now I I'm glad for everything up to this point that God has done for me but I don't see that my future's too dark I'm not going to let the devil paint me a dark future uh uh I I just feel like every word is is mine every promise is mine and if he if God can heal me and he has healed me then why can't I just accept that op option is mine and and if adoption is mine why can't I accept for a Rapture and a body change and why can't I accept everything that God has for us but the testings the trials everything is going to be there I I was thinking of a scripture uh there in Psalms 10519 and I think it was talking of uh uh Joseph here Joseph was given Visions dreams and Promises of everything and and uh you if yall know the story of Joseph uh God had given him quite a bit of promises and it just seemed you know ridiculous really and when he even told his Brethren they laughed at him and thought this was crazy and his even his father you know thinking man you know maybe he's stretching this out a little too far but God had given him to him and and Joseph clinged to them and of course it got him in trouble for for even talking about them promises just like a lot of times us Satan hates it when you talk about the promises God gave you he hates it ain't that right but but you got to you got to tell it anyways amen tell tell what God has done for you tell what God has revealed to you tell if you feel like you're a child of God tell people about it if you if you feel like you know you believe in your heart that God has revealed to you that that you're going to make it in a Rapture tell somebody about it don't be ashamed of it well they say they might say well that's stretching a little too far no it's not when when you're a Son of God when God reveals these promises it's more real than anything on this Earth because the word of the Lord must come to pass and well well and so anyway uh Joseph had these Pro uh promises given to him but it didn't come right away the word of the Lord the Bible says the word of the Lord can you pull that up Psalms 105 the word until the time that his word came can you say that with me until the time that his word came the word of the Lord Tried Him think of that the word of the Lord is going to try us and and for you young people especially uh uh life is not uh uh a cakewalk and if if you're looking for things that are easy you know we we're living in an age where everybody wants get rich quick you know and uh they're willing to gamble their house and everything just to just to win that million dollars people spend money just to for the lottery so just hoping that they can come a millionaire overnight everybody wants something fast everybody wants something quick everybody want like the the magic one you know to to wave over them and then their whole life changes well that ain't going to happen but I will tell you uh uh you don't have to gamble your life away on these promises amen every promise of God is sure it's steadfast and you're not gambling you don't have to lose your home you don't have to lose your money you don't you don't have to lose your mind your marriage or anything amen just to stand up on the word of God can you say Amen see because because they're true but but it's not it's it's not get rich quick it's not always the word of the Lord is going to try us right can you say Amen it's going to try us but you've got to stand upon that word of God you got to stand knowing that God had promised it knowing that God is is is true to his word how many beli that God is true God is true to his word another thing in in just uh thinking here uh and that is that when she got to the pro the prophet of God that she had a respect for that man she had respect to the words that he would say and have respect and I I thought you know now I understand that the prophet is gone and and so it would have been nice to be in his presence and not that he's God but as brother Brandon would say that a prophet of God that prophet of God was a representative of God so this little lady could not see God but she knew that God was working through that individual and so that she found comfort in his presence to know that that he he's he can get in touch with God maybe when she couldn't get in touch with God you understand what I'm saying and and I I thought of even Martha uh in in her situation uh there her brother Lazarus had died and and uh it was an impossible situation but when she heard that Jesus had come there to visit there was such a respect toward him that she ran out and and brother Brown says she could have berated him she could have given him the cold shoulder she could have uh done anything but instead of doing something negative she fell at his feet and she called him Lord Lord if I would have been here my La my brother Lazarus wouldn't have died but see the fact that she showed him respect in what he was he was her Lord and and brother Ram said now if she would have approached him in any way other way then she would have never got what she asked for that's right but she was in need and she recognized that there was somebody that was that could get in touch with God there was God in flesh can you say Amen you know I I think of of and you might think I'm stretching it and I don't think I am uh but I I think well what about Representatives here today in on the Earth today yes it would have been nice to have have have uh you know the prophet like I said to be here to where we could drive to Indiana many people drove to Indiana just to have him to pray and and they got they got what they asked for a lot of them just would call him on the phone I thought of uh that that young man Luke Garrett uh brother BR talks about him of how that every time he got a cold anything that happened to him they just called uh brother Bram brother Bram just pray over the phone and God would just instantly heal uh uh and not that brother brandham was God but he was a representative it was a prophet of God the word come to a prophet ain't that right amen and so it would have been nice in that way but I it would have been nice uh to be there with Mary or Martha Mary to uh you know uh to where we could just have that physical contact with Jesus Christ uh and to know to know that everything's okay because he's come think of that if you come to your house and Jesus coming to your house or walking into the church in his physical stature what it been nice to be able just to sit down and talk to him and just to have a one-on-one conversation or um if you have needs I mean people even gave Jesus their babies to just to bless to touch and and that was a blessing right uh I thought of uh you know the the Catholics of how that when that uh when the pope you know he goes downtown or wherever he goes and there's a big old line and they're passing babies you know holding their babies out so he just touches them and they figure that's a blessing you know and so uh but but they they want some representation and they think that the Pope's a representative of God but in this age we know that the Bride is a representation of God they're they're a representative every one of us is a representative of Jesus Christ do you believe that I I I just believe that I I think when we come together am among a body of Believers uh uh we we ought to show and and know that that that God is with us God is with us I I I believe God's with brother Amos I I believe God's with brother Tim faith I believe God's with you and sister Jane and sister Brenda brother Branson brother Cole you know and and and and all of us we we we are a body of Jesus Christ amen and and with that being said we ought to find comfort in one another's presence not that we would ex exalt one another I I think some times we're too afraid of exaltation that we belittle one another and and we shouldn't belittle one another we we shouldn't get to the place that well I ain't I ain't exalting anyone you know because they get lifted up and all that well you you're missing the point just like everybody misses the point by not having the picture you know I'm not saying everybody but some don't have the picture in in in the church they don't think it's right A fitting place but uh because they afraid that everybody think that we're lifting brother brandom up well that's just so far from the truth but because we you know we ain't going to let negativity I mean there might be some people think that but I'm not going to let their negativity keep me from uh having a picture of really why I have that picture you know and and same way is it today we don't exalt one another just like we don't exalt brother brandham so so people say well you read too many quotes and and you're just exalt brother BR well that's not true uh you know we've been accused of of uh being deity you know deifying the flesh because we just believe what brother Brown says is the truth and that's it and shouldn't be debatable and but but just because they believe them things don't don't uh keep us from believing what we believe and so is it today you know Satan would tried to put a a a stumbling block of of of maybe getting us to where we don't look at one another the way we really should look at one another we we are representatives of God and we ought to have such a respect for one another a faith in one another that we really have confidence in one another's prayers you believe that I I think that's actually scriptural is that we could have confidence in one another's prayers and and know that if I'm in need if if uh uh you know if if I'm down if I'm here and or whatever that we could ask someone say Hey you know I'm I'm really needing prayer you know and and when someone says I'm praying for you that should really mean something to us can you say Amen why because we're not just churchgoers we're not just church members we are representatives of Jesus Christ on this Earth I just believe that can you say amen and and if we can we're we're so anyways I that's just what I've been thinking uh today is is that you know um uh I believe that God is for us're we're not just beggarly people we're not just we're not victims to the enemy at all God has given us promises can you say Amen he's given us the word of God that we can stand on Amen and so I wanted just encourage you to keep pressing the battle amen and whatever you do press the battle take take your Christianity take what God has done for you in all seriousness be sincere amen be sincere in what you do be sincere in your worship be sincere in your prayer be sincere in your life be sincere always watch what you do watch what you go where you go watch what you say always just just let the presence of God be with us because we realize that we are representatives of Jesus Christ can you say Amen you love the Lord if the musicians will come amen the Lord representatives of Jesus Christ that's right amen that we ought to be a people let's not be cast down amen but let's look at the promises of God and know that all is well amen amen you believe all is well there's that little song all is well we've heard the message Shalom maybe we could just sing that amen all
