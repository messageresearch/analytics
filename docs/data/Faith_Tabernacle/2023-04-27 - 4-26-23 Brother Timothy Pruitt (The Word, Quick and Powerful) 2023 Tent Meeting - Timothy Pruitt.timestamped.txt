[54:51] uh we looking forward to what God's got
[54:54] in store and I I just believe we serve a
[54:57] God that that does the impossible
[55:00] and and so whatever you have need of
[55:04] tonight
[55:05] amen I just believe God can move any
[55:09] mountain
[55:11] touch any situation that you would have
[55:14] and I trust that you've come expecting
[55:17] God to move
[55:18] amen and we were just really honored to
[55:22] to have each and every one of you and um
[55:26] I'm not going to mention names because
[55:28] I'll forget somebody but we're just
[55:31] really good to just welcome you and
[55:35] we're having a little issues with the
[55:38] sound but that's okay we're going to
[55:40] have church anyways and I wanted to
[55:43] maybe just read you a quote
[55:46] uh here but it says uh brother Brown
[55:49] talking he said this morning brother we
[55:51] had one of the nicest times of
[55:53] fellowship with the ministers here of
[55:54] the city
[55:56] and the visiting ministers that came to
[55:58] the breakfast he said one of the nicest
[56:00] little fellowships I ever I believe I
[56:03] ever set in with he said oh everyone
[56:05] with one Accord and they were different
[56:08] denominations the Baptist and different
[56:10] ones that shook my hands as they left
[56:12] the door
[56:13] and that's what I call sitting together
[56:15] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[56:18] and if the Holy Spirit could meet with
[56:20] us in a hotel room this morning in that
[56:22] manner with that many Christians what
[56:25] should it do with this great host of
[56:28] Christians here
[56:30] it could just do anything and I'm
[56:33] expecting him to do great things
[56:36] are you expecting him
[56:40] Hallelujah
[56:46] God thought of how that the Lord was
[56:49] with brother Branham as he he would give
[56:53] a message
[56:55] to to the church
[56:58] and he was preaching to many people that
[57:00] did not believe
[57:02] in what he was saying did not understand
[57:04] what he was saying then understand the
[57:08] importance of what he was and his
[57:10] ministry and that he's still labored and
[57:13] the angel of the Lord was with him
[57:15] because he was calling people out
[57:17] pulling people out of denomination
[57:20] restoring the faith and bringing us
[57:23] bringing the people back for a bride of
[57:25] Christ
[57:27] and I thought if the angel of God could
[57:29] meet when that situation
[57:32] what will he do tonight we are a people
[57:34] that's been called out
[57:37] where the message is not being
[57:39] introduced to us the angel of the Lord
[57:42] isn't being introduced to us we've had a
[57:45] personal relationship with him
[57:48] can you say Amen we've been called out
[57:51] of all the unbelief we've been called
[57:53] out of all the all the the baggage that
[57:56] that of traditions and denominations and
[57:59] ideology of men a man what a faith
[58:02] should be here tonight
[58:04] amen amen and I believe that we're we've
[58:07] got ministers in this meeting that is
[58:09] preaching the same message under the
[58:11] same inspiration that has caught hold of
[58:14] what brother Branham was trying to tell
[58:16] us and you say amen and I believe that
[58:19] well the prophet said the angel of the
[58:20] Lord accompanies the message always and
[58:23] I just believe the angel of the Lord is
[58:25] here tonight do you believe that amen
[58:28] and so we're under great great
[58:30] expectation and uh before we have uh
[58:33] brother Timothy to come and um I I do
[58:38] have some announcements uh that I want
[58:40] to share with you
[58:42] um
[58:44] first of all we've got restrooms there
[58:47] right and left here on the right as
[58:50] you're walking out is the men's and the
[58:52] the sisters uh on the left and there's a
[58:55] nursery in that building there and it
[58:58] does have uh even though there's two
[59:00] doors there's six stalls in each in each
[59:04] bathroom uh restroom there so uh there
[59:09] but also the brother uh that that is is
[59:14] over the parking uh he's asked that if
[59:17] you are here throughout the day that is
[59:20] just you want to be here and
[59:22] fellowshipping ask that you do not park
[59:25] uh behind us in this parking over here
[59:29] but just drive up the road up the hill
[59:32] and there's a sign that will point you
[59:34] to the left and it's called on-site
[59:38] parking and so if you want to stay
[59:40] throughout the day you just park over
[59:42] there and then that way uh it will give
[59:45] them Freedom through
[59:48] sometimes if you park over here uh and
[59:52] then they're trying to park people for
[59:54] service then your car might be in the
[59:57] way of what they're trying to do so if
[59:59] you could do that that would be great
[1:00:01] also uh uh we we got this uh no savings
[1:00:05] seat policy uh and and we're sorry to do
[1:00:09] that but as as as the wheat goals uh uh
[1:00:15] we we're going to just fill up all the
[1:00:17] seats as the best we can and and so if
[1:00:21] you want a seat and you want a good seat
[1:00:23] come early and uh and then that way
[1:00:27] we'll all be satisfied praise the Lord
[1:00:31] and so
[1:00:32] um also asking uh for the children
[1:00:36] parents not let your children play in
[1:00:39] the tent
[1:00:40] during the day running around we've got
[1:00:44] expensive things here that
[1:00:48] the sound the music and things so and we
[1:00:51] also even though it's a tent and we want
[1:00:54] to keep this as as Reverend as we can
[1:00:58] and so uh plenty of acres to play uh
[1:01:03] have a ball we want you the the children
[1:01:05] to enjoy themselves uh just not in the
[1:01:08] tent and uh we'll keep that for service
[1:01:11] amen and so also uh every year we we
[1:01:16] have a lot of things left over after the
[1:01:19] meeting a lot of Bibles a lot of
[1:01:21] blankets a lot of whatever and clothes
[1:01:25] and so if you are missing something
[1:01:28] throughout the meeting and if it is
[1:01:31] found we're going to put it right in the
[1:01:32] back there uh uh at that table and so if
[1:01:37] you're you're missing glasses keys or
[1:01:39] whatever and if we do find it that's
[1:01:41] exactly where it will be if you can not
[1:01:44] find it there then maybe ask one of the
[1:01:47] ushers that you see and hopefully
[1:01:51] they'll be able to help you locate them
[1:01:55] there and if you have uh any anything
[1:01:59] that you're needing let us know we want
[1:02:03] to make your stay as as comfortable as
[1:02:07] we can and for we as a Faith Tabernacle
[1:02:11] really honored that you would take the
[1:02:14] time out of your busy schedule to come
[1:02:16] and visit us and and be a part of the
[1:02:18] meeting and also tomorrow night we're
[1:02:21] going to have or tomorrow night tomorrow
[1:02:23] at 12 we're going to have a Minister's
[1:02:26] luncheon and it will be for the
[1:02:29] ministers and their wife and uh so at 12
[1:02:34] o'clock they're in Blacksburg at
[1:02:36] Preston's restaurant and so if you'd
[1:02:39] like to come we would love to have you
[1:02:42] and to have Fellowship and we always
[1:02:45] have a great time Fellowship among the
[1:02:48] ministry amen and I think that's what we
[1:02:50] need is just good fellowship and and let
[1:02:53] our hair down so to speak and and have a
[1:02:56] have a good time amen how he's come to
[1:02:59] hear the word of God
[1:03:01] amen I'm I'm just come uh so excited and
[1:03:06] and expecting God to do great things and
[1:03:09] many I guess uh of us know brother
[1:03:11] Timothy Pruett and his family just a
[1:03:15] wonderful brother in the Lord and
[1:03:17] appreciate his ministry very much and
[1:03:20] his love for the message his love for
[1:03:23] the people of God and if there's ever a
[1:03:26] time that we need Ministry it's now
[1:03:28] they're trying to shut us up you know
[1:03:30] and and which the prophet already warned
[1:03:32] us that the devil doesn't like ministers
[1:03:34] that preach in the message stand behind
[1:03:36] the pulpit amen and and so uh he's doing
[1:03:40] his best to discourage the ministry but
[1:03:43] we're here to uh put our shoulder to the
[1:03:48] wheel and as the prophet told us it's
[1:03:50] it's not the minister he doesn't have
[1:03:53] magic in his in his bag he doesn't bring
[1:03:55] Revival amen you operate the gift God
[1:04:00] supplied the gift of in the man before
[1:04:03] the foundation of the world a man but I
[1:04:06] just believed not only did he ordain
[1:04:08] brother Timothy to stand behind his
[1:04:09] Pulpit tonight but he ordained the
[1:04:11] people that would stand here tonight and
[1:04:13] pull on that gift because they would
[1:04:15] need that gift amen and God's going to
[1:04:18] speak to us in a great way and so as
[1:04:21] brother Timothy would make his way if we
[1:04:24] could just stand to our feet and
[1:04:26] um and we want him just to take his time
[1:04:29] and preach the gospel to Us Praise the
[1:04:33] Lord let's just sing only believe all

[1:08:38] in the last year and
[1:08:39] three of my my three older children are
[1:08:43] married now and and so
[1:08:46] things change very quickly and very
[1:08:48] rapidly and brother Wayne I'm waiting

[1:08:54] place to be ain't it that's what I told
[1:08:55] him I said I'm Gonna Let You Get Married

[1:09:00] hey you got to have some reason for
[1:09:02] being this old
[1:09:04] any man amen so uh but uh sister Katie's
[1:09:08] with us and she's not available
[1:09:32] [Music]
[1:09:54] and out of his mouth when a sharp
[1:09:56] two-edged sword and his countless was as
[1:09:59] the sun shineth in its strength
[1:10:02] and when I saw him I fell at his feet is
[1:10:05] dead and he laid his right hand upon me
[1:10:07] saying unto me fear not I am the first
[1:10:10] and the last I am he that liveth and was
[1:10:14] dead and behold I'm Alive forevermore
[1:10:17] amen and have the keys of hell and of
[1:10:21] death one more scripture Romans 8 and
[1:10:23] verse 11 it said if the spirit of him
[1:10:26] that raised up Jesus from the dead
[1:10:28] dwelling you he that raised up Christ
[1:10:30] from the dead shall also Quicken your
[1:10:33] mortal bodies by his spirit that
[1:10:36] dwelleth in you
[1:10:38] amen I'd like to speak to you this
[1:10:40] evening on the word quick and Powerful
[1:10:44] amen I believe that's the word that we
[1:10:46] have in our our day amen we'll let you
[1:10:48] be seated
[1:10:50] just looking at this word quick
[1:10:53] it means to be alive
[1:10:55] it means to be Lively
[1:10:57] it means to breathe it means to be among
[1:11:00] the living
[1:11:01] it means not to be lifeless and not dead
[1:11:04] but active blessed and endless in the
[1:11:08] kingdom of God it's Living Water
[1:11:11] therefore having vital vital power in
[1:11:14] itself and exerting the same upon the
[1:11:16] soul is to be full of vigor to be fresh
[1:11:20] to be strong to be efficient to be
[1:11:23] active and to be powerful I believe
[1:11:26] that's the word that we have in this day
[1:11:28] that we live in it's not a word that's a
[1:11:30] dead letter or dead Creed or some dead
[1:11:33] theolog Theologian or theology somewhere
[1:11:36] or some psychology but it is alive and
[1:11:40] it's moving among his people
[1:11:42] amen and we can read in Ephesians 2 and
[1:11:44] verse 1 and then this is the same word
[1:11:46] you hath he Quicken so therefore not
[1:11:49] only is the word to be alive but if he's
[1:11:52] quickened you you are to be alive amen
[1:11:54] you are to be full of the power of
[1:11:56] almighty God who were once dead in
[1:11:59] trespasses and sin we're in times past
[1:12:02] you walked according to the course of
[1:12:04] this world according to the prince of
[1:12:06] the power of the air the spirit thou now
[1:12:08] worketh and the children of Disobedience
[1:12:10] among whom also we all had our in our
[1:12:13] conversation in times past and the lust
[1:12:16] of our flesh fulfilling the desires of
[1:12:18] the Flesh and the mind and we're by
[1:12:19] Nature the children of Wrath even as
[1:12:22] other but God who's rich in Mercy amen
[1:12:26] that's why we're here tonight because
[1:12:27] God's rich in Mercy it's not because of
[1:12:30] what I've done or how I I I was you know
[1:12:33] born in a certain of this and always God
[1:12:35] rich in Mercy for his great love
[1:12:37] wherewith he loved us even when we were
[1:12:40] dead in sins
[1:12:42] so and it wasn't because you was a good
[1:12:44] person he loved you he loved you even
[1:12:46] when you was dead in sins but he has now
[1:12:49] made us alive together in Christ by
[1:12:52] Grace he are saved and has raised us up
[1:12:54] together and made us sit together in
[1:12:57] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus in other
[1:12:59] places Colossians 2 and verse 13 it says
[1:13:02] you being dead in your sins and the
[1:13:04] uncircumcision of their flesh hath he
[1:13:07] quickened together with him having
[1:13:09] forgiven you all trespasses amen
[1:13:13] somebody say all all trespasses blotting
[1:13:16] out the handwritten of ordinance that
[1:13:18] was against us which was contrary to us
[1:13:20] and took it out of the way nailing it to
[1:13:22] his cross and has four old
[1:13:24] principalities and powers and made a
[1:13:27] show of them openly try open over them
[1:13:30] in it see the word of God was spoken
[1:13:32] many many years ago before his coming
[1:13:34] speaking of Jesus spoke of his
[1:13:37] crucifixion spoke of his dance spoke of
[1:13:39] his suffering but it also spoke of his
[1:13:41] resurrection
[1:13:42] and brother Brian said of all those
[1:13:44] things that Jesus did all the healings
[1:13:46] he did all the Deliverance he did all
[1:13:49] the Vindication of God's word and what
[1:13:51] he did to a fulfill it of Healing The
[1:13:53] Sick raising the dead casting out Devils
[1:13:55] preaching the gospel to the poor
[1:13:57] fulfilling every word that God said he
[1:13:59] would do when he came even suffering for
[1:14:01] our sins and going to the Cross being a
[1:14:04] perpetuation for our sins at the cross
[1:14:06] where no one else could have done it but
[1:14:08] him but above all of that he said I
[1:14:11] think the Resurrection on Easter morning
[1:14:14] sealed the whole thing
[1:14:17] amen we could talk about a good man long
[1:14:19] ago and we could talk about what he'd
[1:14:21] done but we can but we have a different
[1:14:23] story we're not talking about a man who
[1:14:25] lived and died and somewhere in a grave
[1:14:28] somewhere but we're talking about a man
[1:14:30] who lived he overcomes Satan he defeated
[1:14:33] him in every place he defeated him in
[1:14:35] every situation he healed the sick he
[1:14:38] raised the damn amen but he's not
[1:14:40] somewhere in a tomb but he's raised amen
[1:14:43] he said I once was dead but I'm Alive
[1:14:45] forevermore that is the god that we are
[1:14:49] speaking about and that is his word that
[1:14:51] we're talking about hey man we can read
[1:14:53] about it in Matthew 27 and verse 62. it
[1:14:56] says the next day that follow the day of
[1:14:58] preparation the chief priests and
[1:15:01] Pharisees came together and under pilate
[1:15:03] saying sir we remember that that
[1:15:06] deceiver said while he was yet alive
[1:15:08] after three days I will rise again now
[1:15:11] you would think if they really believed
[1:15:13] he was deceiver they wouldn't worry
[1:15:14] about what he said
[1:15:16] amen was something on the inside of them
[1:15:18] was like What if he's telling the truth
[1:15:20] what if what he said is the truth he
[1:15:23] said the command therefore that the
[1:15:24] Sepulcher be made sure until the third
[1:15:27] day
[1:15:28] lest his disciples come by night and
[1:15:31] steal them away and say unto the people
[1:15:33] he has risen from the dead so the last
[1:15:35] Heir be worse than the first
[1:15:39] ain't that the way the devil operates
[1:15:41] he's from the pilate said you have a
[1:15:43] watch go your way making a sure as you
[1:15:45] can so they went and made the sepulchers
[1:15:48] to her sealing the stone and setting a
[1:15:51] watch but in the end of the Sabbath as
[1:15:54] it began to draw Dawn toward the first
[1:15:56] day of the week Came Mary Magdalene and
[1:15:58] the other Mary to see the Sepulcher and
[1:16:01] behold there was a great earthquake for
[1:16:03] the angel of the Lord descended from
[1:16:05] heaven and came and rolled back the
[1:16:07] Stone from the door that is set on and
[1:16:10] his countenance was like light in his
[1:16:12] raiment white as snow and the fear of
[1:16:14] him the keepers did oh the keepers did
[1:16:17] shake and became as dead man
[1:16:21] amen and became his dead man and the
[1:16:24] angel answered and said of the woman
[1:16:25] fear not she for I know that you seek
[1:16:28] Jesus which was crucified but he's not
[1:16:31] here he is risen and come see the place
[1:16:34] where the Lord lay
[1:16:37] amen now I heard it said like this and I
[1:16:39] thought it was really good one time
[1:16:40] Jesus did not roll away the stone so he
[1:16:43] could get out he rolled away the stone
[1:16:45] so they could go in and see he wasn't
[1:16:48] there no more because his body could
[1:16:50] walk through walls his body could
[1:16:52] transfigure and go into another place
[1:16:54] and be found on the on the shore with
[1:16:57] fish he he could be taken over on the
[1:16:58] road of Emmaus he didn't need the stone
[1:17:01] Lord away but God rolled away those
[1:17:04] songs for us
[1:17:06] and I think about that how the devil
[1:17:08] will try to put a watch over our life
[1:17:10] and he tried to keep us in a group tomb
[1:17:13] somewhere and he tried to keep the power
[1:17:15] of God Amen away is sealed away and he
[1:17:18] sealed it with his seal and he tried to
[1:17:20] put whatever he tried to put over your
[1:17:21] life but there was a word spoke for your
[1:17:24] Resurrection
[1:17:26] there was a word spoke for your time to
[1:17:29] rise up out of the Grave out of whatever
[1:17:31] the devil had you in
[1:17:35] and there wasn't nothing the devil could
[1:17:37] do about it when your time come amen the
[1:17:41] word came and it spoke to you and it
[1:17:43] brought you out of the grave
[1:17:45] and all those demons that were that were
[1:17:48] there to try to keep you they fell as
[1:17:51] dead men
[1:17:52] [Applause]
[1:17:55] come on now hey man we're not talking
[1:17:57] about now the resurrection power just in
[1:18:00] one man it's in many men many women it's
[1:18:04] the same power of God that raised that
[1:18:06] body that's in this tent tonight
[1:18:10] it's the same power of God that raised
[1:18:12] that body that'll heal your body that'll
[1:18:15] deliver you that'll set you free
[1:18:17] [Applause]
[1:18:21] amen is a powerful word and it's a quick
[1:18:24] word
[1:18:26] I was just going through it quick you
[1:18:28] know it's another you do something quick
[1:18:31] and it's amazing how many times you can
[1:18:33] go through the scriptures of Jesus and
[1:18:35] it says and immediately
[1:18:37] and suddenly
[1:18:40] amen one day you can be a sinner and
[1:18:43] then suddenly a saved Son of God
[1:18:48] listen God's still doing that
[1:18:51] just had a man come and speak to our
[1:18:53] pastor brother Tim he said listen I had
[1:18:55] no no desire to serve God he said I was
[1:18:58] on my way I thought I had things done
[1:19:00] and I thought I had my life made and he
[1:19:02] said I wasn't looking for God he said I
[1:19:04] used to serve him but I walked away from
[1:19:06] him and I thought it was all over
[1:19:09] [Music]
[1:19:10] and he said he uh he went to his
[1:19:12] business there and he laid down on the
[1:19:14] couch and he hears a voice saying hey
[1:19:16] it's your time to come to me
[1:19:20] and suddenly he was changed
[1:19:24] amen I wouldn't give up on children I
[1:19:26] wouldn't give up on husbands I wouldn't
[1:19:28] give up on wives amen all of it takes is
[1:19:31] the voice of God and say it's your time
[1:19:33] it's your moment it's your time
[1:19:38] maybe somebody have a time in this tent
[1:19:40] tonight or this weekend it's our time
[1:19:43] it's our moment with the King
[1:19:46] [Applause]
[1:19:49] oh
[1:19:51] the resurrection proved who he was
[1:19:55] amen
[1:19:57] and has sealed the word of God forever
[1:19:59] for the True Believer all Gloom and
[1:20:01] doubt was shattered at that moment that
[1:20:04] Blissful morning man had been shut up in
[1:20:06] a prison house even even to religious
[1:20:09] people before this day but when a man
[1:20:11] died it seemed to be settled but when
[1:20:13] this one come and he said I have power
[1:20:15] to lay my life down and I have power to
[1:20:17] raise it up again then it didn't go
[1:20:20] prove what he said
[1:20:22] amen God purpose is to prove his word to
[1:20:26] be the truth there's only one man that
[1:20:27] could do that and that was Jesus and it
[1:20:30] came and proved to be the truth and it
[1:20:32] sealed it all and that broke all the
[1:20:35] seals of glue
[1:20:38] they have scattered all the
[1:20:40] superstitions of other religions where
[1:20:42] great men had raised up and said some
[1:20:44] things but they died and went down to a
[1:20:46] grave but in our religion it's the only
[1:20:48] one with an empty tooth
[1:20:51] Hallelujah and it proves to me that he
[1:20:55] is God of the Dead He's god of the
[1:20:57] living he can raise up the dead and
[1:20:59] bring him back to life again that's the
[1:21:02] quickening power of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:07] foreign
[1:21:08] [Applause]
[1:21:10] he proved it by his promise
[1:21:13] he's still proving it tonight
[1:21:16] where proofs of his resurrection
[1:21:22] we're supposed to be resurrected and
[1:21:24] we're dead
[1:21:28] I don't think that's the way it works
[1:21:32] when he proved by his promise this
[1:21:35] concrete conquering power he had on
[1:21:37] Easter he proved he could conquer death
[1:21:39] Hell In The Grave I am he that is dead
[1:21:41] and is alive again Alive forevermore I
[1:21:43] have the keys to death Hell In The Grave
[1:21:45] what a statement for anyone to make and
[1:21:47] not only did he make it he proved it
[1:21:51] there's a lot of been a lot of men that
[1:21:53] made a lot of statements but they never
[1:21:55] proved nothing
[1:21:57] but this God not only walk talk to talk
[1:21:59] but he walked the walk
[1:22:01] [Applause]
[1:22:02] amen the world had been shut up and
[1:22:06] doubt for many ages until then this
[1:22:08] proved not only what was talked about
[1:22:09] but it was proven and therefore now
[1:22:12] Jesus said go ye therefore and teach All
[1:22:14] Nations prove to them by demonstrating
[1:22:16] the power of God to them these signs
[1:22:18] shall follow them that believe them who
[1:22:20] promise and say they believe he give us
[1:22:23] a definite understanding of this this
[1:22:25] these signs will follow them that
[1:22:27] believe
[1:22:28] it will be proof of their testimony
[1:22:34] hey there's a lot of people talking to
[1:22:36] talk but they ain't walking the walk
[1:22:39] amen he said but until we have a proven
[1:22:42] sign that he said that would be upon us
[1:22:45] then we're just confessing to be
[1:22:47] Believers and not possession of
[1:22:49] believers
[1:22:52] Jesus said go ye into all the world and
[1:22:55] preach the gospel to Every Creature how
[1:22:57] far all the world to who Every Creature
[1:22:59] they'll never they've never received all
[1:23:01] these signs shall follow them to believe
[1:23:02] how long all the world to who every
[1:23:04] creature
[1:23:06] that commission is still in effect
[1:23:11] amen and these signs shall follow them
[1:23:15] amen that believe in my name they shall
[1:23:18] cast out Devils speak with new tongues
[1:23:23] and they'll take up deadly things
[1:23:25] serpents drink a deadly thing it'll not
[1:23:27] harm them and they'll lay hands on the
[1:23:30] sick and they shall recover he said that
[1:23:33] is his last commission to the church
[1:23:35] mark 16.
[1:23:40] is it was different than what poor Paul
[1:23:42] ordaining these gifts in the church
[1:23:44] years later
[1:23:45] said he ordained these same gifts and he
[1:23:48] said in Galatians 1 if an angel from
[1:23:50] heaven preached to you any other gospel
[1:23:52] than this that's already been received
[1:23:54] let him be accursed
[1:23:57] direct quote I believe that Pentecost
[1:24:00] began without an ending
[1:24:02] I believe it's to Every Creature all
[1:24:05] times all place that Pentecost should
[1:24:07] always remain the Pentecostal blessing
[1:24:10] should be upon the people he said now
[1:24:13] what is this Pentecostal blessing it's
[1:24:15] the confirmation of the Resurrection
[1:24:20] in other words no wonder the gospel
[1:24:22] itself means good news
[1:24:25] good news good news of what he's raised
[1:24:28] he's alive
[1:24:31] he has death under his feet
[1:24:34] death is the greatest enemy that we got
[1:24:37] and if that enemy has been conquered
[1:24:39] every enemy under him is conquered
[1:24:42] therefore every sickness is conquered
[1:24:44] every disease is conquered every
[1:24:46] situation you say well what about my
[1:24:48] family I was born like this if you don't
[1:24:51] let the word have preeminence in your
[1:24:53] life it'll conquer it
[1:24:56] [Applause]
[1:25:00] amen it'll conquer it
[1:25:03] if you'll let it work in you it'll
[1:25:05] conquer it
[1:25:08] well my daddy was like this and my
[1:25:10] granddaughter
[1:25:11] what about that Daddy
[1:25:18] amen anyhow
[1:25:21] oh boy that's getting better and better
[1:25:25] getting gunpowder into Brother Ray
[1:25:31] oh man
[1:25:34] it's the confirmation of the
[1:25:36] Resurrection
[1:25:37] that's why we got to have we got to have
[1:25:39] the confirmation that he's not dead
[1:25:42] he's not back 60 years ago
[1:25:45] he's not back a hundred years ago
[1:25:47] thousand two thousand years ago he's
[1:25:49] present living among us
[1:25:52] with the same signs the same wonders the
[1:25:55] same manifestations
[1:25:57] it's the same word and if it's the same
[1:26:00] word it has the same manifestation
[1:26:03] it has the same effect
[1:26:10] yeah he said because I live you live
[1:26:12] also ye who wants dead can live
[1:26:17] are ye who are dead can live
[1:26:21] amen amen amen
[1:26:24] praise the Lord anyhow
[1:26:29] the very essence of this Resurrection is
[1:26:32] the talent show and to prove Jesus is
[1:26:34] raised from the dead he's not dead he's
[1:26:36] alive he's living here he's in us if I
[1:26:39] be with you even in your little while
[1:26:41] the world will see me no more yet ye
[1:26:43] shall see me for I'll be with you even
[1:26:45] in you into the end of the world notice
[1:26:48] it's the same spirit that raised him up
[1:26:50] in the grave that is now dwelling in us
[1:26:52] how could that be the spirit that raised
[1:26:54] up Jesus from the dead is now dwelling
[1:26:57] in the people
[1:27:00] amen it is the spirit that quickens
[1:27:06] in other words if you ain't got the
[1:27:07] spirit you got a dead letter
[1:27:16] you got a dead letter
[1:27:18] might have a good life might live A good
[1:27:22] whatever but without the spirit of God
[1:27:25] it's dead
[1:27:28] that's the word
[1:27:30] amen
[1:27:32] the letter killeth but the spirit-given
[1:27:34] life it's the spirit that quickens the
[1:27:36] word or gives the word life it gives it
[1:27:40] wings to fly
[1:27:43] it gives it access it's the spirit that
[1:27:46] does that
[1:27:48] what he said in second Corinthians is
[1:27:50] the letter killeth but the spirit giveth
[1:27:53] life
[1:27:55] so the wheat seed alone is just a wheat
[1:27:58] seed
[1:27:59] unless there's something to Quicken it
[1:28:02] amen but if it then it gives it life and
[1:28:05] we were once Dead made in the image of
[1:28:07] God yet dead in sins and trespasses but
[1:28:09] there had to be some way God could get
[1:28:11] this quick in life into our mortal
[1:28:13] bodies he said I'm talking about your
[1:28:15] body
[1:28:18] amen amen your body he said as a
[1:28:22] promised Messiah he quickened every word
[1:28:24] that was prophesied that he would do he
[1:28:26] healed the sick he raised the dead how
[1:28:29] he'd be born a virgin how it all come he
[1:28:31] fulfilled all of those words amen but he
[1:28:34] wanted more than just one body
[1:28:39] he wanted many bodies
[1:28:41] amen with the same power with the same
[1:28:44] Vindication with the same spirit with
[1:28:47] the same life with the same everything
[1:28:52] he said now with that same spirit that
[1:28:54] was upon him to be the Redeemer in that
[1:28:57] age that we have accepted now the
[1:28:59] promise in this last days what would
[1:29:01] take place if you become part of that
[1:29:03] word you redeem with him because the
[1:29:06] same spirit that dwelt in Christ now
[1:29:08] dwells in you and it quickens your life
[1:29:10] into this age he said it's also in the
[1:29:12] end time quickens your mortal body it
[1:29:15] resurrects you it brings you up again
[1:29:17] that takes away the Gloom when we look
[1:29:20] at that
[1:29:21] Hey listen there's a lot of Gloom in
[1:29:24] this world I'm gonna deal with that word
[1:29:25] just a moment there's a lot of Gloom in
[1:29:27] this world you read the news there's
[1:29:28] Gloom you look around there's Gloom you
[1:29:30] know what Gloom is it's partial or total
[1:29:33] darkness
[1:29:35] and that's exactly what the devil's
[1:29:37] trying to put on our services is Gloom
[1:29:41] bring in the darkness and the worry am I
[1:29:44] getting too fanatical am I doing it am I
[1:29:46] getting a he says a darker shadowy place
[1:29:49] it's a loudness of spirit it's a
[1:29:52] dejection it's an atmosphere of
[1:29:54] despondency
[1:29:58] people can hear the truth of God and sit
[1:30:01] there like bumps on the law and no
[1:30:03] response to the word of God listen there
[1:30:05] has to be something a deep that calls
[1:30:08] into the deep there has to be a deep to
[1:30:10] respond
[1:30:12] [Applause]
[1:30:19] I read this this evening I said Lord let
[1:30:23] this be the
[1:30:24] prayer of this meeting
[1:30:26] he said May the spirit of the Lord Jesus
[1:30:29] Christ move down
[1:30:31] and settle down over this audience
[1:30:34] and may the glooms of fear and doubt and
[1:30:38] unbelief be moved all away
[1:30:43] amen he said Lord I believe you'll give
[1:30:46] that to us just a touch of your presence
[1:30:49] just a touch if they'll receive it it'll
[1:30:52] move the Gloom back enough that their
[1:30:54] spiritual eyes can be opened to see
[1:30:56] what's standing in our midst
[1:31:00] it's your presence as Among Us that's
[1:31:02] who is here
[1:31:08] amen that's that'll be all right Lord
[1:31:10] don't let me sit in some atmosphere
[1:31:12] despondency
[1:31:15] all right
[1:31:16] what you need to turn your eyes to he's
[1:31:19] risen
[1:31:20] and if he's risen all things are
[1:31:22] possible
[1:31:24] your family situation can change just
[1:31:27] like that
[1:31:28] your sickness can change immediately or
[1:31:31] suddenly it don't take but one little
[1:31:32] touch
[1:31:39] tonight
[1:31:42] maybe a cancer has conquered you

[1:37:50] heads for a moment for this little
[1:37:52] nervous sister oh Father this is some
[1:37:56] Mother's darling baby perhaps some man's
[1:37:58] wife maybe some child's mother and she
[1:38:00] stands here with this Gloom Satan's
[1:38:02] making her nervous oh he'd make her
[1:38:04] commit suicide he would he'd put an
[1:38:06] insane asylum set her against a padded
[1:38:08] sail against the wall but she's come
[1:38:11] forward to confess her love and then
[1:38:13] reaching out just now oh God send down
[1:38:15] Sovereign Grace and may the Holy Spirit
[1:38:17] drive away this enemy from her and may
[1:38:20] right now it leave her and never return
[1:38:23] and she'd be happy all the rest of her
[1:38:25] life and free from this disease and
[1:38:27] affliction in Jesus name
[1:38:31] he said now sister with your head bowed
[1:38:33] wouldn't you like to look look away has
[1:38:37] it left you you feel all right it's gone
[1:38:40] now you can raise your head now you can
[1:38:43] go off the platform happy rejoicing and
[1:38:47] praising God
[1:38:52] Hallelujah
[1:39:01] he was saying another place and he said
[1:39:03] if that little Gloom he caught a little
[1:39:04] Gloom that little Gloom that little
[1:39:07] shadow that I look at of darkness in the
[1:39:10] room if that would only could leave here
[1:39:12] some way we could get that away from
[1:39:15] here there wouldn't be a feeble person
[1:39:17] in the building in one minute from now
[1:39:27] the word is powerful
[1:39:30] powerful is a source of power as a
[1:39:33] source of energy in the Bible there's
[1:39:35] many references to the power of God's
[1:39:37] word his his word will get you through
[1:39:39] anything
[1:39:40] and everything this world can throw at
[1:39:42] you we read it the word is like a
[1:39:45] like a cut through life
[1:39:47] through confusion and
[1:39:49] we can help us see the reality of the
[1:39:52] truth
[1:39:53] God's word is a discerner therefore it
[1:39:56] can it can thoroughly examine Our Lives
[1:39:58] it can do what no other a book can do
[1:40:02] it's the penetrating power of God's word
[1:40:04] it can probe into the innermost access
[1:40:07] of our thinking
[1:40:10] and let me tell you he's still the
[1:40:12] discerner
[1:40:16] I I mean I probably could let me just
[1:40:19] ask how many has ever come to a service
[1:40:21] and you you maybe talk to somebody that
[1:40:24] week or maybe that day and the preacher
[1:40:25] get up and report but it just repeat
[1:40:27] exactly your conversation back to you
[1:40:31] he's still the discerner
[1:40:34] God knows your address
[1:40:38] and listen his GPS is always up to date
[1:40:42] it'll never need updating
[1:40:47] amen that GPS that the man has made
[1:40:49] it'll get you off on some dirt road
[1:40:51] somewhere and lost
[1:40:54] that's pretty good most of the time but
[1:40:55] let me tell you it'll leave you some
[1:40:57] Dark Places sometimes but this word
[1:40:59] right here it'll bring you out and it'll
[1:41:02] bring you in
[1:41:03] it's not going to leave you it's not
[1:41:05] ever going to forsake you but he's going
[1:41:07] to be with you
[1:41:12] we can read about God's word is like a
[1:41:14] fire it refines it purifies this word is
[1:41:18] like a hammer in Jeremiah 23 is capable
[1:41:20] of breaking hard hearts and shaping our
[1:41:23] character God's word is like a lamp it's
[1:41:25] it's like food it's like seed it's all
[1:41:28] this in the scripture this word is like
[1:41:30] a mirror his word is like gold it's like
[1:41:32] rain snow and water it cleans and
[1:41:34] refreshes his word is like an anchor it
[1:41:37] gives us security there in turbulent
[1:41:39] times his word is a source of strength
[1:41:42] that'll never run out it's a power and
[1:41:45] an energy
[1:41:47] that you don't ever have to worry does
[1:41:49] it still have enough is there still
[1:41:51] enough there it'll always have enough
[1:41:53] it'll always be enough
[1:41:57] what man makes and they build power
[1:41:59] plants and they build energy plants but
[1:42:01] one day they go away and they fade away
[1:42:03] but this word will never fade this word
[1:42:06] will never fail
[1:42:08] but it will prevail all throughout the
[1:42:11] world and into the eternities
[1:42:13] [Applause]
[1:42:17] the truth is there's nothing more
[1:42:19] powerful than the word of God it is the
[1:42:21] answer to every question it contains the
[1:42:24] power to meet every need it's word
[1:42:26] promises it will produce health and it
[1:42:28] will
[1:42:30] it's the answer to every human that need
[1:42:32] it will defeat the Devil anytime
[1:42:34] anywhere any place this power is
[1:42:36] unlimited it'll pull you through on your
[1:42:39] hardest days it'll sustain you when you
[1:42:41] feel all your strength is gone it's the
[1:42:43] Holy Ghost it's a word it's in the
[1:42:46] Church of the Living God and it's a
[1:42:48] sustainer and the energizing Force
[1:42:53] [Applause]
[1:42:59] so if you're going to preach the word
[1:43:01] you got to be anointed to preach the
[1:43:02] word
[1:43:05] hey
[1:43:10] please honey quote okay
[1:43:13] he says many of you ministers here you
[1:43:16] wouldn't want to say that you spit out a
[1:43:18] sermon
[1:43:20] or just popped it off
[1:43:22] direct quote
[1:43:25] you want to say it come from inspiration
[1:43:28] it has to come from the holy spirit that
[1:43:32] energizes you to speak that message if
[1:43:35] it isn't you will never be successful
[1:43:40] well this one's keeping me from doing
[1:43:42] this and this one's keep thought
[1:43:44] you know I get amazed people get to
[1:43:46] believe in men are bigger than God
[1:43:48] if God called you the gift will make
[1:43:51] place for itself so don't get mad at men
[1:43:54] unless you're getting mad at this man
[1:43:55] you
[1:44:04] Hallelujah anyhow
[1:44:06] he said this is Charles Finney and so
[1:44:08] forth men who copied their sermons out
[1:44:10] when I got up there and preached with
[1:44:11] the inspiration the Holy Ghost the same
[1:44:13] sermon he preached the night before
[1:44:14] hundreds brought to the altar there's
[1:44:16] such a difference
[1:44:18] it's got to be inspired the holy
[1:44:21] spirit's got to oceanize that
[1:44:25] so it is with healing it's got to be
[1:44:27] something there that takes place through
[1:44:30] a Divine gift that'll energize the
[1:44:32] people with the Holy Spirit to believe
[1:44:36] amen and so that's why we need the
[1:44:38] spirit of God in our services and we
[1:44:40] don't want to do anything that clamps
[1:44:41] down on him or puts him in a box he only
[1:44:44] does things certain way or he only does
[1:44:46] it in my way
[1:44:48] most boxes are our boxes and the way we
[1:44:51] want things done
[1:44:54] get some more gunpowder
[1:44:59] we want God to operate just a certain
[1:45:02] way
[1:45:03] so do the Pharisees
[1:45:06] so do the Sadducees they wanted God to
[1:45:09] come a certain way and when he come in
[1:45:11] the way of a Manger born with a woman
[1:45:12] who supposedly met an angel they called
[1:45:15] him what they call him
[1:45:17] illegitimate child
[1:45:20] we were not born of sin
[1:45:26] Hallelujah but God's got to oceanize it
[1:45:31] listen
[1:45:32] tonight there was a hundred things
[1:45:34] thousand things that God could preach
[1:45:36] every service these men of God there's
[1:45:39] thousands of things
[1:45:41] but you want the right thing
[1:45:43] and you know what God wants
[1:45:46] and listen you you have to learn that
[1:45:48] sometimes it's hard sometimes you get to
[1:45:50] learn real hard sometimes what God wants
[1:45:54] I remember as a young man young Minister
[1:45:56] and you know I was very dependent on
[1:45:58] notes and and uh
[1:46:01] I was overseas one time with brother
[1:46:02] Danny steaming and we split up one night
[1:46:04] and we then the next night we were
[1:46:06] splitting up and going into the opposite
[1:46:08] churches and the one Church they only
[1:46:10] had a lady for a translator first night
[1:46:13] I stayed at the town where he was in and
[1:46:15] preached there and Lord started putting
[1:46:17] something he started on tonight
[1:46:20] I started writing down scriptures
[1:46:22] and I saw Withers was headed I said God
[1:46:25] I can't do this
[1:46:27] so I took my notes
[1:46:29] got up and preached
[1:46:34] rub my nose in that concrete
[1:46:37] that hurt
[1:46:40] next night I'm on my way with a brother
[1:46:43] who couldn't speak English was just
[1:46:44] sitting in the car for two hours and I'm
[1:46:45] looking at my notes I wasn't started
[1:46:48] whirling started writing down
[1:46:51] same scriptures same thought same thing
[1:46:55] and I thought God here's my thoughts
[1:46:57] I'll be honest I said God if tonight's a
[1:46:59] flop it ain't my fault
[1:47:01] because I'm not doing what I did last
[1:47:03] night
[1:47:07] I got up with that little sticky pad of
[1:47:09] notes through scribbled down and my
[1:47:11] Bible and I began to preach and the
[1:47:12] power of God began to move in that place
[1:47:15] preaching on a little subject called Let
[1:47:16] My People Go just the subject of
[1:47:18] Deliverance and I got on suicide and I
[1:47:21] got to going down that trail on suicide
[1:47:22] and all of a sudden I don't know how
[1:47:24] long I was preaching without a
[1:47:25] translator but I looked over and the
[1:47:26] lady wasn't translating the more she
[1:47:28] couldn't she was just a puddle
[1:47:30] she looks at me and she's like give me a
[1:47:32] minute
[1:47:33] so I waited for her to get herself back
[1:47:35] together and we kept on going and ended
[1:47:37] up about 20 or 30 in that little service
[1:47:39] and prayed for the church the pastor
[1:47:41] everybody
[1:47:42] God moved in a mighty way got in the car
[1:47:45] with the pastor and his wife and the
[1:47:47] sisters translating
[1:47:48] she looked at me she said brother
[1:47:50] Timothy
[1:47:51] she said this was God
[1:47:54] she said this week I tried to take my
[1:47:56] life
[1:47:58] but I want to testify God delivered me
[1:48:01] right there
[1:48:06] see God knew me
[1:48:08] he knew what I was going to do so he
[1:48:11] drug my face to the mud the night before
[1:48:13] where it would have to be priests who
[1:48:15] needed to hear it
[1:48:17] but he wants to oceanize it
[1:48:20] now it's only happened a handful couple
[1:48:22] handfuls of time that that would happen
[1:48:24] in the back office things will change
[1:48:25] real quickly amen but I've learned if it
[1:48:28] happens I'm going to follow what he says
[1:48:30] we want to be led by the spirit I don't
[1:48:33] even know how it got there but that's
[1:48:34] where we're at we want to be auctionized
[1:48:37] and it ain't just for the preacher to be
[1:48:39] junctionized
[1:48:41] we need the spirit of God ocean eyes and
[1:48:44] hearts amen moving and touching and
[1:48:47] changing
[1:48:54] he said the vine he talks about the
[1:48:56] Divine the branches you know the the
[1:48:58] many times brother Branham used that
[1:49:01] well Jesus would say I'm the vine you're
[1:49:03] the branches he said the branch is
[1:49:05] energized by the life of the Vine
[1:49:08] therefore Jesus has no lips tonight on
[1:49:10] Earth but mine are yours he has no eyes
[1:49:13] but mine is yours he has no hands but
[1:49:16] mine is yours and he energizes and bring
[1:49:19] forth his life as he brings it through
[1:49:21] us whether it's preaching the gospel by
[1:49:23] lip or seeing visions by eye whether
[1:49:27] whatever it is laying hands on the sick
[1:49:28] whatever it is is Christ working through
[1:49:31] the branches of his church every office
[1:49:34] literally electrified by his presence
[1:49:40] amen literally electrified by his
[1:49:44] presence
[1:49:45] that's what we want amen we want the
[1:49:47] power of God moving in our midst
[1:49:50] [Music]
[1:49:52] we got to have more than just some
[1:49:54] theology or some psychology or some just
[1:49:57] this ain't just need to be just a better
[1:49:58] way to live
[1:50:00] [Applause]
[1:50:02] listen we're not interested in a better
[1:50:04] way to live yes it is a better way to
[1:50:05] live but that's not what the goal is
[1:50:07] this message is life-changing it's body
[1:50:10] changing it's Soul changing
[1:50:13] [Applause]
[1:50:17] it has to literally Electrify every part
[1:50:21] of everybody
[1:50:29] you say well I don't know about life
[1:50:30] because you ain't got a hold of it yet
[1:50:37] get over here and get yourself in that
[1:50:39] electricity
[1:50:43] we're talking about limited power
[1:50:46] it can only handle so much it can only
[1:50:49] do so much
[1:50:51] it'll blow a fuse because it's made by
[1:50:53] man
[1:50:55] sound like a lot of man-made churches
[1:50:57] they can only handle so much of the
[1:50:59] movement of God it can only handle so
[1:51:01] much of the electrification of the Holy
[1:51:04] Ghost it can only handle so much of the
[1:51:06] spirit of God falling and moving it'll
[1:51:09] blow a fuse

[1:53:03] reap if you faint not second
[1:53:05] Thessalonians 3 again said be ye brother

[1:53:11] faint or to be utterly spiritless to be
[1:53:14] wearied out or exhausted

[2:00:47] goat milk's good if it's taken care of
[2:00:49] Done Right is good stuff it's in the
[2:00:50] Bible
[2:00:53] Thou shalt have goat's milk anyway
[2:00:59] but when it turns bad
[2:01:03] no
[2:01:05] if it's got a little bit of bad in it no
[2:01:09] I walked in that house and I smelt it
[2:01:12] bad when I walked in the door my Peppa's
[2:01:14] sitting over there with a with a bowl of
[2:01:17] cereal he'd fix that evening my mama had
[2:01:20] and she'd pour that goat milk in it it
[2:01:21] was Sour
[2:01:22] it was so bad it was curdled
[2:01:25] and he's like he seen me he said Timothy
[2:01:27] come tell me I'm all this milk's bad
[2:01:30] oh I don't even have to come over and
[2:01:32] look at it it's bad my own she grabbed
[2:01:34] her a big old Spoonful up ain't nothing
[2:01:36] wrong with that milk
[2:01:38] I said Mama it might not be nothing
[2:01:40] wrong with it to you but to me and Papa
[2:01:42] that stuff's bad let me go get him
[2:01:44] another jug of it
[2:01:47] was inspired and passed his due date or
[2:01:49] his good date and then your sickness has
[2:01:53] the same expiration date
[2:01:56] it's wrote on it already by the pie hand
[2:01:58] of almighty God your day comes to end
[2:02:01] here
[2:02:03] [Applause]
[2:02:05] thanks
[2:02:07] but a Believer has no expiration date
[2:02:10] there's no end to you amen when you're
[2:02:14] still millions of years shouting against
[2:02:16] the Hills of Glory and that cancer so
[2:02:19] far back you don't even remember it no
[2:02:21] more and that person's gone you don't
[2:02:23] even know about it there's no more tears
[2:02:25] no more sorrow no more partying no more
[2:02:27] nothing like that for the devil has
[2:02:29] brought in it's all over why because it
[2:02:32] expired
[2:02:35] I pray this weekend some expiration
[2:02:37] dates will be pulled on some devils this
[2:02:40] is your last time over that one this is
[2:02:42] your last time over that one you have
[2:02:44] come to your end
[2:02:48] because there is a word here that has
[2:02:51] jurisdiction has power over that Spirit
[2:02:54] of hell
[2:03:01] he's the Everlasting God he's the Lord
[2:03:04] the creators of the ends of the Earth
[2:03:06] and he fainteth not neither is weary
[2:03:11] so
[2:03:13] when you give up don't mean God gave up
[2:03:17] there is no searching of his
[2:03:18] understanding he'd give power to the
[2:03:21] faint
[2:03:22] to them that have no might he increases
[2:03:24] strength
[2:03:25] even the youth shall fade
[2:03:28] hello
[2:03:31] and I'll tell you right now I'm a
[2:03:33] stronger I can do all kinds of things I
[2:03:35] can do 50 chin-ups and push-ups
[2:03:37] just keep living
[2:03:46] even the youth shall feign and be weary
[2:03:48] and young men shall utterly fail
[2:03:51] but they that wait upon the Lord
[2:03:53] shall renew their strength they shall
[2:03:56] Mount up with wings as eagles they shall
[2:03:58] run and not be weary they shall walk
[2:04:01] and not faint
[2:04:08] my
[2:04:09] I got so many things here
[2:04:14] just touch this for a moment
[2:04:18] the random preaching this in
[2:04:20] Jeffersonville
[2:04:21] to see you Church by the world
[2:04:23] he says where is our power
[2:04:26] where is our Glory
[2:04:28] what is it
[2:04:29] we have went after the wisdom of men
[2:04:32] instead of the power of God
[2:04:35] you want to lose power go after the
[2:04:37] wisdom of men go after psychology go
[2:04:41] after intellectualism
[2:04:43] our preachers and things have become so
[2:04:45] stiff and starchy they've organized as
[2:04:47] us us to we're so still starchy and
[2:04:50] stiff neck so you never hear us shout in
[2:04:52] the church anymore
[2:04:53] you never hear anybody cry the mourner's
[2:04:56] benches in the basement there's no more
[2:04:58] glory in the church all we do is set
[2:05:00] back just as stiff as we can be we're
[2:05:02] not free we're bound
[2:05:05] the devil with his modernistic demons
[2:05:07] has bound the Church of the Living God
[2:05:08] there's no more power there's no more
[2:05:10] freedom there the people are so starchy
[2:05:12] and still why God can come in the midst
[2:05:14] of Pentecostal people and show that he's
[2:05:16] God and prove his signs of his
[2:05:17] resurrection and it don't even shake
[2:05:19] them no more it's a disgrace
[2:05:24] I walk across the country and God
[2:05:26] working and Performing signs and people
[2:05:28] sit and say well I guess that's all
[2:05:30] right oh I know it can be it doesn't
[2:05:32] move them they're bound with the light
[2:05:34] of the world they are in Fetters they
[2:05:37] even got them to where they're Bound in
[2:05:39] the Confederation the Philistines are
[2:05:40] upon these Samson what are you going to
[2:05:43] do about it oh we got denominations we
[2:05:45] got greater membership but where is the
[2:05:47] spirit
[2:05:48] where's the Holy Ghost that's what the
[2:05:51] devil has done it's wooed into the
[2:05:53] church and has kept wooing the church
[2:05:55] come to me I'll give you this big
[2:05:57] Tabernacle if you do this I'll get you
[2:05:59] get rid of that fanatic preacher you got
[2:06:00] and get your doctor Divinity that's got
[2:06:02] some sense and some nice big classical
[2:06:04] Church you'll be we'll be like the rest
[2:06:06] of them shame on you he said I'd rather
[2:06:08] have a man that didn't know split beans
[2:06:10] but it's coffee from beans but was
[2:06:12] filled with the Holy Ghost and he would
[2:06:14] be uncompromised by the power of
[2:06:16] almighty God
[2:06:17] [Applause]
[2:06:21] but it's God so starchy that some poor
[2:06:24] Saint can break through in a meeting
[2:06:26] speak in tongues or shout a little bit
[2:06:28] and the rest of them will all Gander
[2:06:30] around say what was that I wonder where
[2:06:31] that was why must be something that he
[2:06:33] dropped in here he said you know that's
[2:06:35] the truth some poor Saints step in and
[2:06:37] get happy and raise their hands cry
[2:06:39] praise God somebody will holler a man
[2:06:41] preaching the gospel to the preaching of
[2:06:43] the Gospel
[2:06:45] somehow it's all right if we're singing
[2:06:46] we can jump and shop and preach and we
[2:06:48] can't
[2:06:49] the rest of them turn around and see
[2:06:51] what he said that's Pentecostal that's
[2:06:53] what's the matter your pattern out the
[2:06:55] Methodist and after the Baptist and
[2:06:56] their pattern after the Catholic and the
[2:06:58] Catholic are pattern after hell
[2:07:00] [Applause]
[2:07:03] Delilah is woojoo
[2:07:06] find educated ministers a better class
[2:07:13] what are we going to do
[2:07:15] what's going to happen and I'm just
[2:07:16] skipping through here you can go listen
[2:07:18] to it
[2:07:21] he said Samson the Philistines is on the
[2:07:23] Branham Tabernacle worldlyism is
[2:07:26] creeping it among you
[2:07:28] direct quote
[2:07:30] what about it have you exposed your
[2:07:32] secret have you exposed that secret that
[2:07:34] God gave you when you're Walling there
[2:07:36] in the sawdust a few years ago have you
[2:07:38] let it creep out by some social formal
[2:07:40] worship
[2:07:43] what happened to you God can come down
[2:07:45] and perform Miracles and go right down
[2:07:48] to the audience and tell people the
[2:07:49] secrets of their heart and everything
[2:07:51] and heal the sick The Afflicted do signs
[2:07:53] of Wonders preach his word as hard as
[2:07:55] they can by the Holy Ghost and people
[2:07:56] say well I guess that's all right we
[2:07:58] enjoyed listening to it once in a while
[2:08:00] if we're not too tired
[2:08:05] but we're not too tired at a ball game
[2:08:07] we're not too tired in the world
[2:08:11] we're not too tired when we're watching
[2:08:13] movies late at night or playing games
[2:08:15] all night we're not too tired but all of
[2:08:17] a sudden the word of God comes and we're
[2:08:19] tired
[2:08:21] I tell you what I'm tired of I'm tired
[2:08:24] of a formal Social Gospel
[2:08:26] I'm tired of a man that has to be bound
[2:08:29] because he can't preach the Holy Ghost
[2:08:30] he can't believe some Deliverance he
[2:08:33] can't preach some Miracles he can't
[2:08:35] preach the signs I'm tired of that
[2:08:37] spirit that wants to clamp down upon us
[2:08:42] that's what I'm tired of
[2:08:49] well you're just working up the people
[2:08:51] what are you doing working them down
[2:08:54] [Music]

[2:09:38] come into her in demonstration of the
[2:09:41] spirit Mark 16 can follow that church
[2:09:44] Acts 2 4 Acts 2 38 and all of it if you
[2:09:48] follow along with the church signs and
[2:09:50] wonders accompanying the apostles great
[2:09:52] signs of his resurrection among them
[2:09:56] listen to the prophet he says while
[2:09:59] we're in prison surely God's growing a

[2:13:27] he didn't say it'd make your way easy
[2:13:30] he didn't say he'd make it without
[2:13:32] trials or
[2:13:33] heartaches or
[2:13:35] Church issues
[2:13:37] whatever he just said he'd make it
[2:13:39] perfect
[2:13:40] all things work together
[2:13:42] for the good to them that are they
[2:13:45] called according to his purpose his

[2:14:22] 5 great is our Lord and of great power
[2:14:24] and his understanding is infinite acts 1
[2:14:28] and verse 7 says and for you to know
[2:14:30] that it's not for you to know the times
[2:14:31] of the season but the father has put in
[2:14:33] his own power but ye shall receive power
[2:14:36] after the Holy Ghost has come upon thee
[2:14:39] Oh you said well I don't know about well
[2:14:41] acts 4 33 and with great power Gravely
[2:14:44] gave the apostles witness of the
[2:14:47] resurrection of Jesus Christ Stephen
[2:14:49] Full of faith and Power
[2:14:53] First Corinthians 2 1. I brother when I
[2:14:56] come to you come now with excellent
[2:14:57] speech or wisdom declaring you the
[2:14:59] testimony of God for I'm determined not
[2:15:01] to know anything among you save Jesus
[2:15:02] Christ and then crucified I was with you
[2:15:04] in weakness and fear and must trembling
[2:15:06] and my speech and my preaching was not
[2:15:09] with enticing words of man's Wisdom but
[2:15:12] in demonstration of the spirit and the
[2:15:15] power
[2:15:17] the Holy Spirit oceanizing
[2:15:22] First Corinthians 4 19 so I will come to
[2:15:25] you shortly if the Lord will and will
[2:15:27] know not the speech of them which are
[2:15:28] puffed up but the power for the kingdom
[2:15:32] of God is not in word but in power
[2:15:38] second Timothy 1 7 says for God has not
[2:15:41] given us the spirit of fear but of power
[2:15:45] it's a spirit of power
[2:15:47] and of love and of sound mind
[2:15:54] let me finish with this one right here
[2:15:56] musicians can come
[2:15:58] he said how can a man today upon the
[2:16:00] principles of what Jesus promised he
[2:16:02] sized all the world and these blessings
[2:16:03] to all the world and the Holy Ghost to
[2:16:05] fall like it did in the beginning and
[2:16:06] whatsoever God would call how can a man
[2:16:09] call himself a Christian and deny that
[2:16:11] word and say the holy spirit is in him
[2:16:13] the Holy Spirit Will punctuate every
[2:16:16] word of God with an amen
[2:16:19] oh brother our Educational Systems has
[2:16:22] drawn us away from it
[2:16:26] oh
[2:16:28] I think I need to read that again
[2:16:31] he said the Holy Spirit Will punctuate
[2:16:33] every word of God with an amen oh
[2:16:36] brother our Educational Systems has
[2:16:39] drawn us away from it
[2:16:43] and our denomination has separated us
[2:16:45] from one another and from Christ and
[2:16:47] they'll continue to do that you take a
[2:16:49] substitute or any other thing it has no
[2:16:51] more fig leaves again God rejects it he
[2:16:54] said but when the church comes under the
[2:16:56] blood of Jesus Christ with the token of
[2:16:58] the Holy Spirit upon them and then
[2:17:00] you'll see it see Brotherhood again
[2:17:02] you're going to see a church full of
[2:17:06] power
[2:17:07] you're going to God hates a powerless
[2:17:10] religion it's got to be power it's a
[2:17:14] power to save a man from sin it's a
[2:17:16] power that can do signs and wonders and
[2:17:18] miracles it's a power God doesn't want a
[2:17:21] powerless religion God doesn't want that

[2:18:20] shall you do also even more than this
[2:18:21] how you do I go to my father the church
[2:18:24] tries to deny that and get a way to get
[2:18:28] more members to be more popular
[2:18:30] but he said I want to ask you something
[2:18:32] God is trying to perform in his church
[2:18:35] God the church is trying to perform with
[2:18:39] a Creed
[2:18:40] but the two will never work together
[2:18:43] you've got to get rid of the Creed and
[2:18:45] get Christ in and when he sees the blood
[2:18:47] and the blood's been applied and the
[2:18:50] Hand laid Upon Jesus Christ and the
[2:18:52] heart that's true before God and confess
[2:18:54] him wrong and be born of the Holy Ghost
[2:18:56] then the works of God will follow
[2:19:00] he said it would be so
[2:19:02] your church wants to perform through
[2:19:04] their Creed see how many members they
[2:19:06] can get God wants to perform through the
[2:19:08] power of the blood and get Christians
[2:19:11] born again
[2:19:16] he says you got to reject the Holy
[2:19:18] Spirit and his performing power to
[2:19:22] accept a Creed you have to see the truth
[2:19:25] before you can accept the arrow Arrow if
[2:19:28] you're going to be a Christian you have
