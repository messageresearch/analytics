who are sick in our prayer and uh certainly appreciate your prayers uh on my behalf and um doing doing a lot better still fighting the cough but uh uh uh doing just uh feeling a lot better praise the Lord so we thank the Lord for that and uh uh I didn't mention it uh to Daniel but uh we want to keep brother Cole in our prayer and um he's having some issues going on in his body and and um can't

Among Us and work a supernatural work father we know that we don't have to leave here the same whatever need we came in with Lord we can be changed and leave totally different and that's what we

father I don't know what's going on and Lord I I just pray that you would touch him and raise him up to be a a testimony and more than anything I pray that you would just draw him closer to you father be with sister Amanda and the children and pray that you would just be with us today anoint me Lord and anoint your people and father may your word be expressed Lord uh by through our lips and Lord let it just sink into our soul that we could express it to the world father we just Commit This service into your hands now in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord thank you musicians amen and um if you'd like to turn with me uh the book of Psalms 145 and um I received this uh text from uh sister Bethany this morning it says last night shal uh weighed um 10 lb and 9 oz and he's gained at least six pounds since we've arrived the doctors are very pleased and um they confirmed this morning that if they can get a pump uh tomorrow uh then they'd get be able to go home and so we're definitely looking forward to that and um so uh thankful that the Lord is um with them and helping a little man there through this trial and um uh just believing everything going to be all right and he's going to continue to uh to get better amen and um he was pretty dehydrated when they got there to the hospital and but uh doing doing good and so we thankful to the Lord for for that amen and uh but the book of Psalms 145 and we want to start at the eth verse it says the Lord is gracious and full of compassion slow to anger and of great Mercy the Lord is good to all and his Tender Mercies are over all his works all thy Works shall praise thee Oh Lord and thy Saints shall bless thee they shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom and talk of thy power to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts and the Glorious Majesty of his kingdom praise the Lord you can have your seats this morning and I'm also going to turn to First Peter which we uh know um but 1 Peter 2 and9 but it says but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who ha called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light which in time pass were not a people but are now the people of God which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy praise the Lord if I would uh use a title it uh maybe it would be testify of the Lord and U we don't um necessarily I guess talk of this word testify too much and um but uh I do believe in in testifying and uh we should all have a testimony and um uh we do use talk of the word confession and uh which is the same as testifying um and so it is it is important that we as Believers testify uh of and uh we know that that's how we overcome the devil for that's that's what the Bible says there in Revelations 1211 says they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and so brother Bram said this is why we love to testify because we overcome the devil when we when we give testimony and uh so I I thank God for the the blood of the Lamb how many glad for the blood but I'm also glad that I have a testimony Amen to share because I I couldn't overcome without it and um so brother Bram says well what is their testimony he said Jesus Lives that's our testimony is Jesus Lives we're not talking testifying of what was yesterday and and the days gone by but we're testifying of a living God that he has risen and that he is alive uh forever more and brother brandham also called it the word of testimony to Jesus Christ amen and so uh uh our testimony uh is to Jesus Christ so to testify is to give a testimony and and um I I looked up that word testimony is is the evidence giving given from what has been witnessed amen so that that's that's you you won't have a testimony if if you don't have if you haven't witnessed because the testimony is the evidence of what you have witnessed it's it's a personal uh uh a personal thing and so the word testimony has the same meaning as the word testify uh uh and testify means to make a solemn declaration amen uh verbal or written to establish some fact to give testimony for the purpose of communicating to others a knowledge of something not known to them so so this is this is our testimony is establishing a fact amen we've witnessed something amen and we're going to declare it and establish it to people who don't know can you say amen and and and how we need testimonies in this age amen uh when we have so much contradiction of the word when we have so much unbelief so much skepticism and so much of of of other voices amen and so uh testify is also in judicial proceedings to make a solemn declaration under oath for the purpose of establishing or making proof of some ACT to a court uh to Bear witness to to support the truth of by testimony amen and and I'm I'm I'm glad that God gave us a testimony that we can bear witness of the truth amen and so to testify is to Bear witness amen it's like brother Bram said when you go to a trial to be a witness well you're testifying for somebody now now you know uh we we could say the world is the court and and and and the people is the the jury and and they're going to decide uh what we testify about can you say amen and and we've got you know we we've got all kinds of uh people uh bearing witness of of other things but God wants a people to Bear witness of him in the age that we're living in and so again before you could testify uh be before they would call you to testify well they they would want you to to experience you you you you had to have an experience you you must know something before you can testify in the court of the law uh they're they're not just going to go get somebody off the street and say would you be willing to testify you know no no they want someone that was involved they want someone that witnessed they want someone that saw something heard something and and and and these things and so uh the prophet said a witness is a person who has seen something that knows that it is the truth they know they're not guessing it's the truth they're they're not going he said she said and and I don't know but I'll I'll give it my best shot but they know that this is the truth see and and they know it's the truth and they're called to give witness and and then a witness must know what he's talking about he must not well someone told me a certain thing see he must be the witness himself if not then he's speaking of someone else that could be a witness at the scene ain't that right so testifying is not just rambling of words you know getting up there you know uh uh well would you testify for you know Jim Bob yeah I'll give a testimony you know and get up there say well I went fishing yesterday with with Scott and and boy we not a big one you know well that's not testifying amen uh you got to testify what the trial is about what the subject is and and and who's ever on uh uh uh needing you to show evidence or proof of Innocence or or whatever it would be and so testifying I I I you know we used to have testimonies in service you know and and in the Pentecostal and and uh anybody got a testimony you know not everybody at once you know anyone got testimony you got you know and then you know it'd be usually some elder sister get up and talk for a good 15 minutes about who knows what you know just rambling well that's not testimony you know testimony and and and and so um uh it would a testimony it would have to be a statement of truth based on what we personally experienced ain't that right so if our testimony isn't a statement of truth then we are found to be false Witnesses and and and I'm afraid there's a lot of false Witnesses in the world today that that are taking uh the Bible and and and and declaring that God isn't the god of of what he was yesterday he's not the same today but he is the same I I declare that that he's still filling with the baptism of the Holy Ghost I I still declare that that people can be so wrapped up in God that they can live h a a life uh over sin and overcome the things of the world do you believe that amen there's a lot of talk about a lot of things and and people talk about the trouble as as we all know when you're out on the jobs or schools or where wherever uh but there's a lot of trouble that are going on and they talk about it they talk about the politics or they talk about sports they talk about the economy they talk about and uh just all kinds of things and the world is consumed by what's going on around them and you know they they uh um uh and and and that's just what's up upon the people's minds and most conversations these days are have have a have fear mixed in it or anxiety or hate or bitterness or uh worry um all of these things uh it's mixture of in the conversations because uh uh it it shows how people have been affected by the events that are taking place in the world and and you know and and so it it it's so much of of uh testifying of negative uh of things but but we find here in 1 Chronicles uh 16:24 it says declare his glory somebody say declare his glory declare his glory among the Heathen uh uh you know don't don't get wrapped up in in in in world conversations and we we shouldn't let our testimony or our conversations or our lives be tainted with uh bitterness or hatred or worry and fear and and as the world would be but declare his glory among the Heathen His Marvelous Works among all nations for great is the Lord and greatly to be praised he is also to be feared Above All Gods can you say Amen excuse me and so the the the word declare is another word for testify testify of his glory among the Heathen can you say amen amen see testify about His Marvelous Works amen for the Lord is great how many believes he's great he's greater than Trump I promise you that he's greater than Biden he's greater than any politician or any preacher or or or anything that we could we we could think of great is the Lord can you say amen and so uh the the word is uh declare is testify our life should testify of him now it's not just testifying out out in in the church I I know we don't do a lot of testifying in the church anymore like you know and I'm kind of glad for that uh because it seemed like testimonies uh like I said a lot of rambling and it and it took up the the service amen and and so we kind of uh you know brother Brian kind of set a lot of that in order and and we thank the Lord for that amen but you can still testify for our life should testify of him our our worship should testify of him how we worship the way we worship and and way we put our energy into worship it should testify of of of what we really think of God can you say Amen our mouth should testify of him our attitude should testify of him everything about us should testify and declare how great God is in in the world today can you say amen amen see so why why would God save us and and then keep us uh living in in a a world of sin and and chaos and all of that and and yeah yeah I I I believe that uh it does allow us to know him more I I I truly believe I know the Lord and have experienced him in a greater way than when I first gave my heart to him and and it it should be that way every day that we're we're Experiencing God we're we're we're growing in God God we're we're loving God I I believe I love him more than I did yet yesterday it he he just becoming more I I I I'm becoming consumed of him by him and and and and and I I think that's what it ought to be but also think it is for us to fulfill our purpose here in life and and and that is to glorify God I God should get the glory out of all of our Lives amen when you sing a song he should get the glory out of that when we preach a message he should get Glory out of that when we play music God should get Glory out of that when we're out on the road or out in the streets or wherever God should get the glory out of our Lives you believe that amen see and so Romans 15 and6 it says that you may with one mind and one mouth glorify God Amen even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ and then if you go to the eighth verse now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God to confirm the promises made unto the fathers that the Gentiles might glorify God for his Mercy can you say Amen how many's received of his Mercy amen well it's not for us just to sit here and just oh yeah I'm on my way to heaven amen but it's to glorify God for his Mercy then then we do have something to talk about he gave us a testimony when he showed us his Mercy if you ain't got nothing to testify about you ought to testify of his mercy and glorify God by his Mercy that he has showed you amen yes uh he may not answer another prayer of mine I don't care but he's been so good that I still have a testimony amen of his Mercy amen so and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his Mercy as it is written for this call I will confess to thee among the Gentiles and sing unto thy name and again he saith Rejoice ye Gentiles with his people again praise the Lord all ye Gentiles and L him all ye people praise Him declare him can you say amen amen you know you're you're when you when you're testifying to somebody on the street of the Lord you're actually worshiping God it's not just our worship is here it yes we worship here by lifting our hands and singing song we should do that that should never get common to us amen knowing where we're going what he brought us from and and the promises that are ours and and that that we we should be able to praise him from the heart amen whether the music is going or whether it's not going where someone's singing on tune or not singing on tune it shouldn't matter we're here to glorify God Amen but when we're out on the streets and we're talking to our friends and we're talking to our co-workers about the things of God you're glorifying God you're worshiping God Amen you're you're giving God the praise that is Du his name amen but see God wants us to glorify him uh First Corinthians 620 you are bought with the price think of that now you are bought with the price how many believes that amen now you think of that when God saved your soul he snatched you from the devil amen and and and he bought you with the price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit can you say Amen which are Gods amen that that's why we don't go to church and we say Amen to the word and then we go out and live any old way we want to act any old way we want to because we're glorifying God in this body I know you got you got you know you got song leaders now there's just tattoos preachers tattoos and nose rings ear rings all kinds of rings and metal amen they wouldn't pass security amen and the metal detector you know and and uh uh but but we find amen but we glorify God we sanctify the Lord in in our bodies and and we keep ourselves holy and clean can you say Amen why because we're bought with a price God bought you that you could glorify him in your body amen I know the world's acting like heathens but you don't have to do that because God bought you with the price that Redemption price Satan has no claim on you anymore he has no claim on your body he has no claim on your spirit he has no claim on your mind amen glorify God in body and in your spirit which are Gods which are Gods amen Acts 1:8 but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses you shall be Witnesses of me can you sayen if God's going to have someone to uh that he's going to ask to come on the stand and be a witness it's you it's I amen that we would be gladly we should be glad to give a testimony of our Lord Jesus amen Psalms 19 And1 The Heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiworks now brother Brown talked about that was his first Bible was the stars and and and the the the universe and nature and and things but the the Sun the moon the stars and the planets and they all speak of him the heavens declare the glory of God Amen and in Psalms 97 and6 the heavens declare his righteousness and all the people see his glory they may not recognize it but they see his glory they're without a witness of God Amen they're without a witness amen because there is a a a the heavens declaring him amen but then the trees the flowers declare him the grass the The Four Seasons that we have it it speaks of him animals uh life speaks of him and you can see God in in the flowers and in the trees and and and and you can see God in in the birds and as they sing of him and they're glorifying him see so God is is glorified in his creation but then we find that God created a people for his glory now you think of it he created a people for his glory Isaiah 43 and6 it says I will say to the north give up and to the South keep not back bring my sons from far and my daughters from the ends of the Earth even everyone that is called by not my name for I have created him for my glory aren't you glad for that amen created him I have formed him yay I have made him and then if you go to the 21st verse of the 40 thir chapter this people have I formed for myself they shall show forth my praise can you say Amen they're going to declare me not not all men declare a God not every man you got men that are spatting words against God and and oh they they may bless him with their lips and yet their heart is far from him and and and yet they're they're cursing and they're oh we're we're Christian and and and and yet swearing and us the lord's name in vain and saying all kinds of ungodly things and all these things but God has created a people for himself you understand that church they're not them people are not swearing and using God's name in vain amen but they've been kept apart for God and for his glory they are Sanctified they are chosen people now who is this people that God formed for himself 1 Corinthians 3:16 know ye not that you are the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you amen If any man Devour the temple of God him shall God destroy for the temple of God is Holy which Temple you are amen you've been bought with a price why that God that you could be the Temple of the Living God Amen see and and and then the 2 Corinthians 6:16 and what agreement have the temple of God with Idols right amen that's why you ain't going to be joined up with the the World Council of churches that's a that that's just a swamp of all all ungod coming into that well what what agreement would the temple of God have with them things that's why we can't join up with all kinds of nonsense that's in the world today for you are the Temple of the Living God as God has said I will dwell in them and walk in them you're talking about an experience God going to give you a testimony amen when they're telling that the world is not or God ain't real and God ain't doing what he used to do and and and this and that God says I'm going to dwell in you I'm going to walk in you I'm I'm going to make myself known ain't that right he says and I will dwell in them walk in them I will be their God and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate sayith the Lord and touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you can you say Amen so we are living temples of the Living God lord now you know there there's a lot of temples out in the world today that are erected for Gods there's a lot of gods and there's a lot of temples and and so it it's interesting that the how that the heathens Even build temples for their gods amen and and temples all over the world uh uh when Christianity first came to Rome that there was uh about what uh 400 temples I think the prophet said you know that that were uh within a s mile radius uh 7 mile radius 400 temples for all these gods that were out there and and uh to think of that see and and so temples are they they they have a purpose and and not only does it for God but for for the world you got to have a temple for your God uh uh to come in to live in temples are sacred amen whatever you do out in the world when you come into that Temple you just don't do things like you did out in the world Amen because it's a sacred it's a place of sacredness it's a place where deity is to dwell it's a place where a deity is exalted and worshiped ain't that right and so these people think that there's deity in their idols and so they erect temples and and and and place the the their gods in these temples and and it's a it's a it's a place of sacredness to them and a place of worship and exaltation and a place of honor ain't that right and and so well we we know that in the Old Testament there was the temples and and and Moses uh uh uh had there there was the Tabernacle of Moses amen and and it was for deity to come it was it was a place for God to dwell and and it had the three compartments uh uh there the outer Court the inner court and the holiest of holy and and of course these three these three courts represents the the the three parts of man the the flesh which is the outer the spirit which is the inner and then the Soul of of man and and so each of these courts had different uh uh functions uh different uh things uh furniture and different kinds of light the outer Court had sunlight the inner Court had candle light and then the the the the holiest of holy that third Court it it had shakina light it it was God himself the pillar of fire ain't that right and so but but this was three compartments and and and it was a type of what man is um there but in that third room uh uh the holiest of holies uh it it had there The Arc of the Covenant or uh another word for it is the Ark of testimonies and and so that that Ark I I wished I had a picture of it uh uh but that the Ark of the Covenant it was just a wooden box and and and uh uh it was a wooden box and inside of that box was the law or or we would call it the word the testimonies uh uh the testimony and things in E Exodus 25 and 21 it says and thou shalt put the mercy seat up upon the ark see uh uh and in the ark Thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee and there I will commu or meet with thee and will I will commune with thee from from Above The Mercy Seat from between the two cherubims which are upon the Ark of the testimony of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel ain't that right so the Covenant was in the ark the testimony amen was was in the ark and The Mercy Seat covered the testimony covered that word amen and and and that was placed in that that third compartment that third room amen and and that's where the word was and that's where the presence of God come amen is where the word was can you say amen amen and so we we find that God would come and settle in between the cheram and he would commune amen not not in the first room or the outer court and the the the the the second court but that third Court where the Ark of the testimony was ain't that right and so it it was put in there the Tabernacle of Moses and brother Bri said see it was veiled behind veiled behind the old Badger skins in the old Temple was the word see was the word manifested on tables of stone ain't that right see and and and so uh uh to think of it now it says and then another place behind the old temple in the veil what was behind there he said what was Jehovah what was hid back there what was the veil hiding oh hallelujah what was the veil hiding it was hiding the word see The Veil The Old Badger skins was hidden hiding the word to their natural or to their eyes natural behind there also was the shoe bread uh behind there also was the shik glory ain't that right remember the the old Mana it died every day it got old and every morning they can't they weren't allowed to keep it or eat it or anything cuz it'd get nasty and wormy and maggoty and and they had to throw it away they weren't allowed to keep it but then God would tell them to get a bowl of of this mana and take it not in the outer Court the inner court but that third room where the word was amen where the ark was where the The Mercy Seat hovered over that testimony amen and and put it in there and that Mana would would not get old but it was Kept For Generations that the priest could come into that room and partake of of that same mana and it was still as fresh as it was when it first fell showing that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and whoever partook of that had a different testimony than those that were on the outside they'd say well I I I I ate some of that stuff that was a week ago that fell a week ago and it was nasty but whoever come into that in that third room amen could come out and say it's still fresh it's still the same amen what was the difference it was where the word was right can you say amen and so we we find that the prophet said see it was hid from from it was all hid from them it was all hid all all the glory of God was right behind that old Badger skin all hid to the natural eye only those that were chosen to go in there and partake amen could see the glory of the Lord that's right but this showed where the word would be positionally placed in man amen it it wouldn't be in the flesh rim and it would not be in the spirit real but it would be kept in the soul of man can you say man you're you're made up of three compartments and you're the temple of God Amen you have that flesh uh that flesh rim and and this outer court and you have that inner court amen that that still can get smoked up and and all of these things but then in that Soul amen is kept where that word is to be kept can you say Amen where the word will not get stale and your testimony will not get stale but your testimony remains fresh because you're seeing him as the same yesterday today and forever it doesn't matter what this flesh says it doesn't matter what our spirit feels it it doesn't matter what I think or how I feel there's something down inside that I'm partaking of the Mana of the Hidden mana and the realities of God can you say amen that's why I can testify beli Living God whether I feel him or not amen where where whether it seemed like uh uh the mountain is just so far great I don't know what to do but I can stand there with the testimony and declare the glory of God Amen because there's something down in the soul notice uh in Hebrews 10 and 16 uh Paul wrote of the Covenant that God made uh and and and this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days sayith the Lord I will put my laws in their hearts and in their minds while I write them and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more amen aren't you glad for that oh what a mercy seat amen yes sir and so we find that Jesus also said from the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh so wherever what's in that heart is what the mouth is going to declare ain't that right it's down in the abundance of the heart and this is why God promised to write his law his word of course we know it as the Word of Promise a word of Grace amen that he would write it in our heart amen oh I'm so glad for that and and so then so in in the Tabernacle of Moses the word was put behind the bad your skin in the holiest of holy and and exodus 40 and 34 four it says then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation and the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle think of that the cloud covered the tent of the congregation and the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle and Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation because of the cloud Abode there on and the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle think of that filled the temple Amen brother Bri said now notice the old Temple had in it the shakina glor Glory see the light of the shikina over the word the word is a seed and it brought forth the Sho bread to Believers only see the blood also was upon the Covenant see the blood is the water the water that's uh that liens the grain see the the the wheat the seed which is the word so we we see and and we could go more into the study of of the Tabernacle of Moses but we find that David one time he he said you know it's not it's not good that I live in a nice house here they build built me a house and it's a palace and all all these things and yet the Lord dwells in the tent the the testimony dwells in the tent the the Covenant and and so he determined that he was going to build a house for God a temple and of course I think it was Nathan the prophet said do all that's in your heart for the Lord's with the and but the Lord come back and told Nathan said now go tell David it's it's not meant for him to build the Tabernacle he he's his hands are just too bloody of war and things but his son will and and and so we we find that Solomon being the natural son of David did build a temple uh and I guess it would be known as Solomon's Temple uh and and if you go and read what what he did I mean he put some he put Time and Labor into this to make sure everything was just right and and then he offered Sac thousands of sacrifices and when he offered the sacrifices and he got done the glory of the Lord coming into that place to where even the priest could not Minister and it must have been a a real real uh time what a day that would have been to finally get this thing I mean took years to build the temple and and uh lot of work went into this and then then they see the glory of the Lord descend and and come into that Temple it it must have been a glorious day but we find that that that was just a type and Shadow because uh uh really God was telling David that your son the true son which was Jesus Christ would build a temple amen and and and that would be the real thing and so brother brandham says see the true son of David is Christ Jesus that built the real Temple that was born a virgin birth and in his body is the Everlasting temple of God ain't that right see so now Solomon's Temple had the Ark of the testimony it had the Ark of the Covenant amen all of these things and and I I'll I'll read it here but 2 Chronicles 7:1 it says and when Solomon had made an end to praying the fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and the glory of the Lord filled the house and the priest could not enter into the house of the Lord because the glory of the Lord had filled the Lord's House and and when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down and the glory of the Lord upon the house they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement and worshiped and praised the Lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth forever amen it it brought a song it brought a response from the people seeing the glory of the Lord descend upon the Tabernacle ain't that right so Prophet said the see the P Pillar of Fire it it passed over and went down and took his resting place with the Ark of the Covenant there in Solomon's Temple but we find years later that that Temple was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar in in 586 BC and and and it it it remained that way until uh the Jews had come out of Exile and and then they rebuilt the temple uh uh there and and so uh when the and they were proud of that but when the real uh son of David came to Earth he he looked at him and he told him he says now there will not be one stone upon another on this Temple and all he tell them that this Temple all that work you've done and all of these things is going to be destroyed and and and so of course they didn't believe that and all that but the prophet said what he was trying to do he was trying to point them to another Temple amen an everlasting Temple another Temple and get your eyes off of that Temple and look to another Temple can you say Amen but they couldn't get their eyes off of it now there was a promise given by the prophet hegi in in hegi 2 and9 and it says the glory of this latter house shall be great than of the former sayith the Lord of host and in this place will I give peace sayith the Lord of host can you say amen amen so now they're thinking that they built this second they restored the the the Temple of Solomon and and so they they were looking for the glory to come as it did in the first house and they were looking for it to be greater Glory than what it was when Solomon first built that Temple but it never happened it it never took place and and now as they're waiting on this glory to come then Jesus is telling them this Temple is going to be destroyed and and so we we find that uh uh they they thought it would be greater and and so uh we find that the glory of the latter house never did become greater uh upon that Temple as it was the former can you say Amen because it was not part of the promise they they were totally looking at the scripture wrong they didn't understand it but notice in Acts 7 and 48 how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet can you say Amen so if they could have understood that that that Temple of of Moses and the Temple of uh the Tabernacle of Moses and the Temple of Solomon was only a a a a prefigure a a type A telling of another Temple that was to come and them temples had to be destroyed can you say amen and and and and must have been great for the glory of the Lord to to descend upon them the Tabernacle and and upon Solomon's Temple but oh God was telling me don't get don't don't look at this there's something greater that's coming in another Temple can you say amen and and so how be it the most high dwelt not in temples made with hands where where the stone is cut with with saws and and and the timber has been cut down and all of these things Hebrews 9 And1 Christ being come and high priest of good things to come by a greater everybody say a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands can you say amen amen so uh uh and then go Hebrews 10 and5 wherefore when he cometh into the world he says sacrifice and offerings thou wouldest not but a body thou H has prepared me not made of stone and bricks and sticks and all that but a body thou Hast prepared me see so that's the latter house that God was speaking of can you say man remember a greater than Solomon is here amen see so a body not made with hands is a greater and more perfect Tabernacle than the Tabernacle of Moses and of of uh the Temple of Solomon so we look now amen John 1:1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the 14th verse and the Word was made flesh can you say Amen no longer the Ark of the Covenant amen come being able you can't put the Ark of the Covenant into this Temple it the word now becomes flesh [Music] can you say Amen see amen greater than just uh uh uh the word resting in a in a building but now the word has taken on skin can you say Amen the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth what was he he was the expressed image of of God he declared God to the people testified of God can you say Amen see he declared God the Tabernacle of Moses couldn't do that the T Temple of Solomon couldn't do that can you say Amen we look I I think we could all agree that that the Tabernacle of Moses was was uh made after the Heavenly it was it was the image of heavenly things amen that right but notice what Jesus Christ was he was the expressed image of God that's right amen he was the expressed image and the voice of God came from him he was the word can you say Amen even God testified of him saying this is my beloved Son hear ye him in in whom I'm well pleased to dwell in see the word of God flowed through him hello he was the Temple of the Living God and the word of God flow through him the word of God rested in him the word of God manifested itself through him can you say amen he testified of the word and the word testified of him you believe that he didn't testify of a denomination he testified of what the father showed him testified of what the father was for he was the father now can you say amen amen Lord we find brother Ram said now that same logos has a part he's got a bride and the same logos this word can that cannot be tampered with is brooding over the churches today trying to bring back the word to its full manifestation and you say Amen see and now it it's true and I'm going to close i' I've got more to go but it's true that a man can be used of God and yet not express God so that's not the temple of God uh uh the spirit of God can fall upon the Flesh of our flesh can can come fall upon a man's Spirit he can speak in tongues and he can do all kinds of things dance shout and and actually work miracles prophesy all of these things and and yet not be the temple of God not not express God not speak of God because the word is not in him can you say Amen but notice the prophet said when Christ left he Sanctified the church that the church might take his place not just have a religious experience not just so they have a religious feeling but a people that would stand in his place to where that God could be the same in every detail but the physical body can you say Amen every detail you believe it yes sir and that the church might take his place and express the word of God Express the the promises of God become that Living [Applause] Word now he says in another place say it taken him 4,000 years to make this masterpiece now he's been nearly 2,000 years making another Masterpiece a bride for Christ another Masterpiece can you say amen and she can only be a perfect Masterpiece the prophet said when it's the perfect word that's right so notice he says we are made partakers of his Holiness see we're we're we and this may not even make sense I hope it's making a little sense to you but we are we are we are partaking we are experienced something that the world knows nothing of therefore Our Testimony is becoming so enlightening it's we we are speaking of something we know not something that we've learned about not head knowledge but something because the God is now living within us we are made made partakers of his Holiness we In His Image are living images of a living God then dead to self raised with him now listen listen to this his word made flesh again in us when they want to speak doubt we can't speak doubt when they ain't got no hope we don't talk like we ain't got no hope a living God is in US can you say Amen we're not we're not we're not talking of a god of yesterday we're the Temple of a living God the god that Reigns is within us the god that is supreme is within us the god that rolled back the Red Sea is living within us it's a testimony that we have he said what is it it's not the mythical imaginary God sitting out there but the Living God what is the Living God the word in you making itself real glory to God he said I know you think I'm a holy roor maybe I am but oh brother do you see it triumph over every denomination triumph over all paganism a living God made manifest in a living Temple and the word of God which is God made flesh in you therefore you hold the word within you the word is now in the bride you believe it brother Braham said as soon as God's word sinks in your heart get up and give a testimony soon as God's word sinks in your heart get up and give a testimony Hallelujah that's it see when God takes the Holy Spirit and brings that word to you he's able to bring it to you cuz you're a temple of the Living God he showed in the Old Testament that the word would always be there can you say Amen now it's living in living temples amen Abiding and when God takes that Holy SP takes the Holy Spirit and brings that word to you and makes it alive to you a reality that your faith stand up and claim it you don't have to feel nothing hello you just have to believe something you don't have to feel it just believe it what is it the word of promis is inside of you not in your spirit not on your flesh in that Soul it's living that soul is the main part that's you that's controlling the outward emotions TR controlling all other senses and it's calling those things that are not as though they were can you say Amen therefore God comes and and quickens that into that you into you you're that Holy Temple you're a living Temple you're not just setting off in a in a desert somewhere that's right you're a walking living breathing temple temple that that talks a temple that walks a temple that breathes and that word is to be expressed in you it's not just to lay dormant in you it's to be expressed in you lord your life is to express the word what word word of condemnation no a word of Grace A Word of Promise bless the Lord as soon as Mary received the word of the Lord she had to testify of it Prophet said she testified of it before she seen even seen the results of it she testified of it why because the word become in her Hallelujah that word was laying in her it had come life it had been quickened to her the promise had been quickened to her that she was that one she was the Virgin girl that the prophet had spoke of can you say amen glory to God now she become the expression of that word she had to testify of that word that was in her can you say Amen brother Bram said God give us more some more marries down here in Cleveland we'll say blackburg right amen that'll take God at his word and testify about it before anything happens just because the word of God says so we're holding that word down in our hearts cuz we're temples of the Living God it's not something magical or mythical it's not it's something that we really truly know something that's anchored down inside let the feelings come let it go let the symptom come let it go it doesn't matter the word I'm going to tell testify of the word of God the word says I'm Healed the word says I'm saved the word says I'm delivered I'm testifying of it brother Braham said as soon as the real genuine Christian faith anchors in a person's heart let them be bound in a wheelchair blind whatever it is they'll tell it that's right I'm Healed yet they be bound in a wheelchair But I'm Healed heal they could be blind But I'm Healed amen they could be all in racked in pain but I'm Healed can you say man doctor says they're going to die tomorrow but I'm Healed why it ain't mythical it's not just something we're Imagining the word is anchored down inside of us and the word is more real than the symptoms the word is more real than our sins and our failures and and whatever the word is more real and it's found its resting place in us as the temple he said well how do you know you're healed he said Jesus said so and I believe it there you are he said oh I I'd like to throw that in the devil's face when he stood there at Mayo's them group of doctors around me and said Reverend brandom you're finished and Jesus says I'll heal you oh the word found a resting place in the temple can you say amen amen and there was a mercy seat there was a blood over that word Lord Brother brandham could claim the promises see he said yes I I uh and he says uh uh he said you're finished and Jesus says I'll heal you Hallelujah I took him at his word yeah the devil hates me I know he does but Christ loves me because he redeemed me he said all right yes I like to push it back at him every chance I get see he says and and he said oh you don't feel any better than you ever felt when I come out of there I said oh boy if you want to hear me praise God then stick around cuz you're going to hear me yes sir I mean to praise Him Till Death Shall Set Me Free yes sir Let It Be little big whatever it is he's worthy of all praise and glory hey can you say amen he didn't dwell upon what a doctor said he didn't he didn't he didn't conform his testimony to what a doctor said you're finished amen the word had coming to him and he just took God at his word amen and the testimony was I am healed the testimony was Christ does love me the testimony was I'm going to praise Him Till Death Shall Set Me Free but I ain't going to set in the Molly grubs I'm not going to speak doubt I'm not going to speak Gloom I'm not going to look at the dreary world and let fear grip me the word amen has found the resting place of my soul and I will testify I will declare of him yeah you hold the testimony within you amen you believe that the word is in the bride that's true now 2 Corinthians 3 and5 for as much as you are manifestly declared to the be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart what is it now people become manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ Psalms 10216 and when the Lord shall build up Zion he shall appear in his glory a glory greater than the latter do you believe it when the Lord shall build up Zion and church I believe that's where we've come to we've arrived the building is finished the body is complete Hallelujah we've come through all the stages amen through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and now we're here where the person himself has come in his glory son of man being revealed not a church being revealed son of man being revealed and I am identified with him as Miss Jesus Christ can you say man he shall appear in his glory you remember amen the The Headstone was rejected at on on Solomon's Temple right it it was rejected amen and and or the Cornerstone and we find that Christ was rejected of the Jews but here in this day The Headstone the Cornerstone has become The Headstone and he's not rejected when he comes but there's a people crying Grace Grace To The Headstone and when the Lord shall build up Zion he shall appear in his glory he will regard the prayer of the destitute and not despise their prayer this shall be written for the generation to come and the people which shall be created shall praise the Lord church do you love him what is it the word is flowing through you Hallelujah the greater the glory has become the greater in this age Lord thank God for what he done in the Tabernacle of Moses and what he done in the temple of Solomon but God was prefiguring what a people that he would show forth his glory and the word would become prominant inside of them 1 Thessalonians 1: 184 from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and AI but also in every place your faith to godward is spread abroad so that we need not speak anything can you say Amen do you love him isn't he wonderful if the musicians will come Isaiah 61 6 And1 arise Shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee wow what a greater day than it was than the day of Solomon God's glory resting upon not a natural building but a people am that are the Temple of the Lord and for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee believe Hallelujah brother brandham said here he said God wants time test a Time tested church not somebody is a Christian today and a backslider tomorrow and is in and out up and down he can't place you nowhere but he's got a church that's tested went through the trials through losses through sickness through sorrow through death and still standing with the testimony that's the man yes that's the man he's looking for and I believe he's found him I believe that he's found a group of people in this day that has still got a testimony no
