[38:43] one coming up is it an Ethiopian
[38:46] and and he says you know what's the
[38:50] matter with you people you know
[38:52] and he said after hearing that word and
[38:55] nothing moves you anymore
[38:57] and so is these there he said you know
[39:00] he said you can walk out he said you
[39:02] walk out today he said you can walk out
[39:05] and he said
[39:07] you'll walk out to your Eternal
[39:09] destination
[39:11] and he's so he this was in 61.
[39:15] and he says they're going to come a time
[39:17] he said in the name of the Lord that you
[39:19] will cry for a service like this
[39:22] he said you wished you had it it'll be
[39:26] too late
[39:27] and you know I that really struck home
[39:32] and when I heard that this morning and
[39:36] and here lately especially this past
[39:38] week that's all you're hearing is we
[39:40] want a move of God we need a move of God
[39:42] God help us give us a move you know and
[39:46] they they are willing to take any kind
[39:48] of a move of God and
[39:51] um but I I I just thank God
[39:55] every day that we've been able to
[39:58] believe the message of the hour
[40:01] and to know that we're right on track
[40:03] because not because we're following
[40:06] another David koresh
[40:08] but we have seen it supernaturally
[40:10] Vindicated over and over again
[40:14] and we're not we're we're not crying out
[40:18] for Revival we are the Revival we're not
[40:22] crying for something that we haven't
[40:25] received this is something that is
[40:27] ongoing in our personal lives and I'm so
[40:31] glad for that I thought you know back
[40:33] there in 61 if them people would have
[40:36] only realized
[40:38] the effect of their actions to their
[40:42] children and to their grandchildren
[40:44] because now it's their what their
[40:46] grandchildren I guess that are crying
[40:48] out for a move of God in in in this age
[40:51] you know and
[40:53] um but I just thank the Lord I think of
[40:56] the move that is going on right now you
[40:59] know and uh in the in the college and
[41:02] and most of you probably heard it and
[41:05] things and how it's supposed to be is
[41:08] such a move of God such a you know and I
[41:11] say God bless them
[41:12] but at the same time
[41:15] there's no word that is being preached
[41:19] and I've I've you know I wanted to know
[41:22] about this revival what you know so you
[41:24] hear of the testimonies I've been
[41:26] listening to the testimony and not one
[41:28] thing about a miracle not one thing
[41:30] about supernatural signs not one thing
[41:32] it's just singing you know and the uh
[41:37] what seems to be the supernatural to
[41:39] them is that a group of young people
[41:41] been there for all week long
[41:44] singing songs and in somehow it's an
[41:46] attraction you know to to the world uh
[41:51] and they're saying this is it this is
[41:53] the beginning this is the Revival you
[41:55] know and and which you know that that's
[41:58] fine that could be the foolish virgin I
[42:00] don't know but uh but I'm I'm so glad
[42:04] that we're not moved away from the word
[42:05] of God
[42:07] and that we're not moved away from the
[42:09] supernatural
[42:10] we still believe in the Supernatural and
[42:13] we find it out as brother Branham was he
[42:16] he told us and he told us and how right
[42:18] it is that the the the Abraham seed
[42:22] received a a different sign than what
[42:26] Sodom and Gomorrah received amen Abraham
[42:29] received that Supernatural Messiah sign
[42:32] and uh I I'm just glad that we were
[42:35] we've been introduced to that and
[42:37] believed that amen do you love the Lord
[42:41] a man and so here we find in uh in
[42:46] Ephesians 1 22
[42:48] and hath put all things under his feet
[42:51] and gave him to be the head over all
[42:54] things to the church which is his body
[42:56] the fullness of him that filleth all in
[43:01] all amen let's just bow our heads father
[43:06] we as your children come to you this
[43:09] morning
[43:10] with bowed heads humbled hearts Lord
[43:14] thankful
[43:16] Lord that you have called us for this
[43:20] age and that you have given us a messiah
[43:24] sign Lord
[43:26] oh Lord and we can see it in scriptures
[43:29] Lord and how it fits
[43:31] and just
[43:33] before your coming you have given us
[43:36] this sign Lord we know it to be real
[43:39] true fulfilled
[43:42] and Lord we've got our heads lifted up
[43:45] knowing our Redemption draweth nigh
[43:49] that I pray father that you had just
[43:51] blessed the service this morning
[43:54] may you speak to every Heart Lord
[43:58] and I pray father those that are
[44:00] listening in may be sick I pray that you
[44:02] had touched them and heal them
[44:05] by your Mighty power Lord
[44:07] and I just pray God that you will just
[44:10] Elevate us all into a higher Realm Lord
[44:15] in you father May the word become more
[44:18] living and more real in our personal
[44:21] lives
[44:23] we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the
[44:27] church says amen you can have your seats
[44:31] this morning
[44:40] I want to just continue on this thought
[44:44] that we've been speaking on Sunday
[44:45] mornings and we know that God is a
[44:46] person and with a personality
[44:49] and he has existed before all things and
[44:53] by him were all things made
[44:57] he has always existed
[45:00] for he is eternal
[45:02] he's always and in him are attributes
[45:06] and God wanted to express himself
[45:10] through a body for he is he is Spirit
[45:14] and and and a spirit has to have a body
[45:17] a man to express itself
[45:22] um he didn't need another person to
[45:25] represent him such as you know a second
[45:29] or third person of the godhead
[45:31] uh but he just you know he needed a body
[45:37] that he could live in and express
[45:39] himself through
[45:41] uh for he's the only person in the
[45:44] godhead
[45:45] and how people get that all messed up I
[45:48] I don't know but that's just the way it
[45:51] is for uh the Bible says great is the
[45:54] mystery of godliness God was manifested
[45:58] in the flesh
[45:59] so we find that Jesus Christ Jesus was
[46:03] the human body of of God he was the
[46:06] express image as the Bible would say of
[46:10] God and in him Paul told us that uh in
[46:15] him dwelt the fullness of the godhead
[46:18] so all that God was he poured into
[46:21] Christ and and so
[46:24] um uh brother Branham said that all all
[46:27] the richness of God was formed into him
[46:31] that human body all the mercies of God
[46:35] was formed into him all the wisdom of
[46:40] God all the knowledge all the power of
[46:44] God was formed into him in that human
[46:48] body and God took shape himself in in
[46:53] that body and expressed himself people
[46:57] say today that Jesus was just a prophet
[46:59] brother Branham said if he was just a
[47:02] prophet then we're all lost because we
[47:04] needed more than a prophet ain't that
[47:07] right and so but we know that he was
[47:10] deity God manifested In the Flesh that's
[47:14] that's what it was and and brother
[47:18] Branham said that the thoughts of God
[47:20] was expressed through that body a man
[47:24] for the word was made flesh and dwelt
[47:27] Among Us and the word is a thought first
[47:31] amen so Jesus Christ is the Living Word
[47:34] a man not just the written word but he
[47:38] is the Living Word ain't that rhyme and
[47:41] so God expressed himself to the world
[47:44] through that body brother Brown said he
[47:47] came down in a body of Flesh and
[47:49] expressed himself in a life of love to
[47:53] take all that goodness that he was and
[47:57] give it willingly as the Supreme
[48:00] sacrifice that he might take the guilt
[48:03] of the guilty amen so think of that God
[48:07] holy may get God love and he would take
[48:11] all of that love and express it through
[48:13] the body of Jesus Christ it's the only
[48:16] way he could go to Calvary was by by the
[48:19] love of God that's the only way he could
[48:21] stay true and and and and and take the
[48:24] rejection and and and uh the sufferings
[48:28] and the ridicule is because the love of
[48:32] God and that love was expressed to you
[48:34] and I and It produced the person of
[48:37] Jesus Christ so God walked through that
[48:41] body God lived in that body he he talked
[48:46] through that body God had hands he had
[48:49] he had feet God had a tongue God God had
[48:53] ears he had uh uh uh it was it was
[48:58] Christ and he had eyes and and and and
[49:00] that's what he was and so he gave that
[49:04] body as a sacrifice amen he gave that
[49:08] body as a sacrifice and the purpose of
[49:11] that is that he might bring all of his
[49:14] sons and and daughters uh uh back to him
[49:20] and that the Holy Spirit can speak
[49:22] through us and continue his work amen
[49:26] now it's good to to know what he done in
[49:29] Jesus Christ and it's good to to you
[49:33] know uh you I'm sure you've seen him uh
[49:36] movies or uh of of of uh reenactment of
[49:40] what Christ was his life and how you
[49:43] know uh they do it the best they you
[49:46] know to their interpretation of what he
[49:48] was back then and and these things and
[49:51] and and some of them can be moving some
[49:54] of them can be stirring and you think
[49:55] wow that was you know and and you know
[49:58] and that's fine uh you know you can go
[50:01] to the Passion Play there in in uh uh
[50:05] Eureka Springs Arkansas and and uh they
[50:09] they do the reenactment of Jesus's life
[50:12] and and the crucifixion and all that and
[50:14] that's that's fine that's that's
[50:16] something that you know is is is a good
[50:19] thing but but but he he did that for the
[50:23] sole purpose is to bring other Sons and
[50:26] Daughters unto him that he could
[50:29] continue his work through them a man and
[50:33] so uh said he went away and the Spirit
[50:37] come in that that through his death he
[50:40] might perfect the church and bring the
[50:43] church submissive everybody say
[50:46] submissive see bring the church
[50:48] submissive and then the same spirit that
[50:51] was in Christ is in the church doing the
[50:54] same things Christ did amen and this is
[50:58] why it doesn't stump us when he says in
[51:00] the little a little while and the world
[51:02] seeth me no more but you'll see me for
[51:06] I'll be in you and with you even to the
[51:09] end of the world ain't that right I want
[51:13] to just drop this in because uh there's
[51:15] been you know there's only three times
[51:18] in the history of the world that God has
[51:22] come in his fullness in a body and the
[51:26] first time we see it there when God
[51:29] appeared to Abraham a man and it was in
[51:34] the form of Melchizedek and see uh uh
[51:38] Abraham and Sarah had come to their end
[51:42] of life and so God had taken a handful
[51:47] of dust as the prophet would tell us and
[51:50] he blew a man uh uh and and he formed a
[51:55] body a body was created and he actually
[51:58] done three bodies a man uh for Gabriel
[52:01] to step in one and another one to step
[52:03] in another and so two angels and then he
[52:07] created himself a body a spoken word
[52:09] body a man uh uh
[52:13] a human being and he he stepped into
[52:16] that body and that's how he appeared to
[52:19] Abraham was as a man ain't that right a
[52:23] man but Abraham by Revelation knew that
[52:26] it was more than a man it was God and
[52:30] and yet that that uh God in that body
[52:33] amen he drunk milk from the cow he he he
[52:37] ate uh uh meat from the cow of a calf
[52:41] and and he sat down with Abraham and
[52:44] talked with Abraham but uh something
[52:47] that showed that he was God is that he'd
[52:51] done a sign as and we all know that
[52:55] listened to brother Branham a man he
[52:57] performed he appeared as the son of man
[53:00] the prophet said a man and he performed
[53:04] the sign of son of man which is the
[53:07] Messiah sign ain't that rhyme and we all
[53:10] know what that sign was is that that as
[53:13] he's talking to Abraham and he's
[53:15] promising Abraham that he would visit
[53:18] them and and that it would the seed
[53:21] would come through Sarah Sarah was in
[53:24] the tent behind him and snickered amen
[53:26] within herself the Bible says she
[53:28] laughed within herself and God says
[53:31] where's thy wife Sarah and he says he's
[53:33] in the tent behind you she's in the tent
[53:36] behind Jesus well why did she laugh and
[53:38] she says I didn't laugh and he says you
[53:41] but you did laugh and and of course we
[53:44] we know that it was God Amen in a human
[53:48] body the second time that God came in
[53:51] his fullness is when uh the the natural
[53:54] Seed of Abraham uh the Jew came to its
[53:58] End Amen and God created a body in the
[54:03] womb of Mary and manifested himself as
[54:09] son of man ain't that right he becomes
[54:11] son of man again and he called himself
[54:14] son of man a man and he lived in that
[54:17] body amen for 33 and a half years a man
[54:21] but he performed a sign a man and it was
[54:24] the same sign that that Melchizedek uh
[54:28] uh manifest or performed a man it was
[54:31] the sign of the son of man a messiah
[54:34] sign ain't that rhyme a man and over and
[54:37] over he would uh uh he he performed it
[54:41] to Philip he uh I believe it were
[54:43] Nathanael he performed at uh uh uh to
[54:47] the woman at the well and he he he
[54:50] performed it uh to the Jew and the
[54:52] Samaritan a man's seat and so uh uh that
[54:56] that was the second time but then we
[54:59] find a man that this third time a man
[55:02] the Gentiles a man is to receive that
[55:06] same sign at their End Amen the Gentile
[55:12] a man and the Royal Seed of Abraham a
[55:15] man we're at the end of our time ain't
[55:18] that right amen but God promised that
[55:22] just before the fire falls a man he
[55:25] would come in flesh again he would
[55:29] appear in a body and he would perform a
[55:33] man as the son of man he would perform
[55:35] the sign of the son of man ain't that
[55:38] right and so we find that this is where
[55:41] we're at today that God has got a body
[55:44] here upon the Earth amen God's able to
[55:48] uh to accomplish a body on the earth and
[55:52] and the prophet said today God
[55:54] represents himself in the human flesh of
[55:57] his church God the Holy Ghost in his
[56:00] church moving through his church
[56:02] speaking with tongues interpreting
[56:04] tongues Healing The Sick and then the
[56:06] last sign the word so manifested till
[56:09] it's a discerner of the thoughts and in
[56:12] the intents of the heart ain't that
[56:15] right amen so last Sunday we spoke of
[56:18] the promise amen I just touched on it
[56:21] the promise that God gave to Abraham a
[56:24] man reads some scripture here Genesis 12
[56:26] and 7 and the Lord appeared to Abraham
[56:29] or Abram and said unto thy seed will I
[56:34] give this land now think of that
[56:36] undivised seed Genesis 13 15 for all the
[56:41] land which thou seest to thee will I
[56:44] give it and to thy seed forever and I
[56:48] will make thy seed as the dust of the
[56:50] earth so that if a man can number the
[56:53] dust of the earth then shall thy seed be
[56:57] also be numbered amen see in Genesis 22
[57:01] and 17 God said to Abraham thy seed
[57:05] shall possess the gates of his enemy
[57:10] ain't that right amen now we know that
[57:13] God blessed Abraham a man with a natural
[57:16] seed and with the spiritual seed uh uh
[57:21] there and and the natural seed was Isaac
[57:24] a man but but we see through the message
[57:27] of the hour a man that and and the Bible
[57:30] it all goes together but uh that the
[57:34] natural seed was not the seed that God
[57:37] was really talking about amen uh uh it
[57:41] was not the real promise see uh many
[57:44] people today have it in their mind that
[57:46] God was speaking to the naturals about
[57:48] the natural seed and and that's not true
[57:51] he was actually speaking of of a
[57:54] spiritual seed a man a seed that would
[57:57] come forth from the supernatural ain't
[58:00] that right I'm just so glad for the
[58:03] supernatural amen if you take away the
[58:05] supernatural you ain't got nothing at
[58:07] all you wouldn't even have a testimony
[58:09] you wouldn't even have hope you you
[58:11] ain't got nothing to go off of ain't
[58:14] that right a man's seed but now we know
[58:16] that Israel is of that natural seed and
[58:20] and they were a people that God chose a
[58:23] man to display uh the supernatural by
[58:26] amen but yet they were the natural seed
[58:29] and and so the Bible tells us of the
[58:32] supernatural power a man that was
[58:35] performed by that natural seed Waters
[58:39] rolled back uh the dead raised Giants
[58:42] fell walled cities uh uh uh crumbled uh
[58:46] uh the jaws of a lion was ripped apart
[58:50] and and the Lion's mouths were were shut
[58:54] uh for Daniel as he was in that Den of
[58:57] Lions and and fire the fire lost its
[59:01] power Amen to the three Hebrew children
[59:04] as they were in the fiery furnace and
[59:07] and these things all of these things and
[59:10] many more a man but they were are done
[59:13] by the supernatural amen it took the
[59:17] supernatural to do this amen and yet
[59:20] they they were conquerors amen as as we
[59:24] mentioned just a little bit of how that
[59:26] that that that that natural seed were
[59:28] conquerors a man and and Sham guard for
[59:31] example he realized that he was the uh
[59:35] uh the seed a part of a covenant that
[59:38] God had made with his forefather Abraham
[59:40] and and here he was the enemy I believe
[59:43] of the many nights or something like
[59:45] that kept coming over and stealing his
[59:47] crop and and uh finally he just got
[59:50] tired of it and and he realized hold it
[59:52] amen they ain't got no right Amen to to
[59:55] bother me and my family and and and to
[59:59] mess with us I am of the Covenant of God
[1:00:01] Amen and I am of that natural seed and
[1:00:04] so he as being just a farmer took an ox
[1:00:07] gold and he went and met 600 of them uh
[1:00:12] uh the anime or maybe even more I don't
[1:00:14] know but the Bible says he killed 600 a
[1:00:17] man by one man with an ox gold a man but
[1:00:21] under an anointing by a covenant promise
[1:00:24] that God gave his forefather amen
[1:00:27] Abraham so so they were conquerors amen
[1:00:31] David stood there and faced that Goliath
[1:00:33] amen unafraid because he was part of a
[1:00:36] covenant amen see the seed even that
[1:00:39] natural seed you'll find that there was
[1:00:42] conquering a man ability conquering
[1:00:44] power and it wasn't that that David had
[1:00:47] the ability he wasn't that sham guard
[1:00:49] had the ability it was God was honoring
[1:00:52] the Covenant ain't that right but but in
[1:00:55] all that they conquered a man they did
[1:00:58] not conquer sin they didn't conquer
[1:01:00] death hell and the grave they they they
[1:01:03] weren't able to bring mankind into
[1:01:06] relationship with God they they were not
[1:01:09] able to to to make a man justify God in
[1:01:13] the sight of God they didn't conquer the
[1:01:16] lust and the passions of men they didn't
[1:01:19] conquer Pride amen they were just born
[1:01:22] of Flesh ain't that right they were a
[1:01:24] natural seed and and so they were not
[1:01:27] the seed of the woman who would bruise
[1:01:30] the the head of the serpent as God
[1:01:33] promised in in Genesis see and and if
[1:01:36] you just notice for a moment no woman
[1:01:38] has a seed of her own amen she's she's
[1:01:42] only a carrier of of man's seed ain't
[1:01:46] that right but God said to that serpent
[1:01:49] the woman's seed will bruise thy head
[1:01:53] you'll bruise his heel a man but he's
[1:01:56] going to bruise your head ain't that
[1:01:57] right a man's seat and so he said it
[1:02:00] would be the woman's seed and so it
[1:02:03] showed that God was speaking of a virgin
[1:02:05] birth a man because that was the only
[1:02:09] way a man that it could be attributed
[1:02:11] not to man's seed but to the woman's
[1:02:14] seed a man see it could only be her seed
[1:02:18] if it didn't come from man so God
[1:02:21] created the seed within her and it
[1:02:25] attributed it amen to being her seed
[1:02:27] ain't that right amen that's right see
[1:02:30] so we find that Jesus Christ is the true
[1:02:34] Royal Seed of Abraham amen because the
[1:02:39] natural seed could not bruise the
[1:02:40] Serpent's head amen but that would be
[1:02:43] one gate that God would conquer amen
[1:02:46] that would be one gate of the enemy amen
[1:02:49] that would be the main gate that of the
[1:02:51] enemy is that the seed would conquer the
[1:02:54] Gate of the enemy a man by bruising his
[1:02:57] head ain't that right amen now you know
[1:03:00] they they they they conquered but they
[1:03:02] didn't conquer everything because they
[1:03:04] didn't bruise a man of the Serpent's
[1:03:06] head and that word bruise means to make
[1:03:09] an atonement uh uh the prophet said that
[1:03:11] word bruise is to make an atonement so
[1:03:14] God even in the beginning was promising
[1:03:17] a redeemer ain't that right amen and he
[1:03:20] said it would be a seed that would come
[1:03:23] it would be a seed and then later on he
[1:03:26] would tell Abraham it would be thy seed
[1:03:28] amen and and but it wouldn't be a
[1:03:30] natural seed amen it would be of the
[1:03:33] faith Seed of Abraham ain't that right
[1:03:36] so God promising a redeemer to come the
[1:03:40] Messiah to redeem a man not to redeem
[1:03:43] the seed of man amen but to redeem the
[1:03:46] word of God Amen the word seed can you
[1:03:50] say amen amen not Redeeming the seed of
[1:03:53] man but to redeem the word seed now
[1:03:57] brother Branham says he come uh uh uh he
[1:04:01] said redeem is to pick up that which has
[1:04:03] fallen ain't that Ryan so to redeem back
[1:04:06] to a place where it was at the beginning
[1:04:09] amen he come to redeem back to a place
[1:04:13] where it was at the beginning so none
[1:04:16] will be picked up but them that was in
[1:04:19] his thoughts at the beginning ain't that
[1:04:22] right amen he come to redeem his Fallen
[1:04:25] thoughts amen and in order to do that he
[1:04:29] had to defeat the Gate of the enemy the
[1:04:33] very enemy that had to ride over you
[1:04:35] that kept holding you back a man that
[1:04:37] kept condemning you that had a right to
[1:04:39] condemn you before God before the
[1:04:41] atonement amen he come to make that
[1:04:43] atonement amen and defeat the enemy and
[1:04:46] conquer the enemy ain't that right see
[1:04:49] he come to redeem not this cannon father
[1:04:52] that we see running around professing to
[1:04:55] be Christians but that he came to redeem
[1:04:59] that which was in God's thinking at the
[1:05:02] beginning amen another place he come to
[1:05:05] redeem or to bring life to life those
[1:05:09] predestinated seed that God seen before
[1:05:11] the founding nation of the world and put
[1:05:14] their names in The Book of Life ain't
[1:05:17] that right amen another place he says
[1:05:19] God by his death the shed blood brought
[1:05:23] back bought back his own he bought back
[1:05:27] the spoken word seed bride ain't that
[1:05:31] right a man so this was the Conquering
[1:05:34] power a man that that that the natural
[1:05:38] Seed of Abraham could not do amen it
[1:05:41] could not bring back it could not buy
[1:05:44] back it could not break the power Amen
[1:05:47] to where the word could come forth amen
[1:05:50] and be made a reality it just couldn't
[1:05:52] do it to think of it today amen that
[1:05:55] you're here in Flesh and Bones and and
[1:05:57] and and and born of Sinner and yet you
[1:06:00] could stand here singing praises unto
[1:06:03] God lifting up holy holy hands think of
[1:06:07] that lifting up holy hands not because
[1:06:10] you say they're holy or I say they're
[1:06:12] holy but their holy hands before God
[1:06:15] Amen which show that the enemy had been
[1:06:18] conquered
[1:06:20] ain't that right see so we we find a man
[1:06:25] that that uh it was impossible for that
[1:06:29] natural seed to bruise the Serpent's
[1:06:31] head amen but all those Old Testament
[1:06:34] Saints in their Conquering the prophet
[1:06:36] said we're only Shadows of his coming so
[1:06:41] when you see them conquering amen uh uh
[1:06:44] when you read about sham guard and he's
[1:06:46] defeating the uh the the 600 Philistines
[1:06:49] that was just a a a type to show of a
[1:06:54] real conqueror that was coming amen when
[1:06:56] you see David standing there with just a
[1:06:58] slingshot amen and he's conquering a
[1:07:01] Goliath that was well trained and and
[1:07:04] put fear in the hearts of the people but
[1:07:06] there was a young boy amen and defeated
[1:07:09] that thing it was only showing of a real
[1:07:12] conqueror to come ain't that right so
[1:07:15] they were only Shadows of his coming
[1:07:18] amen reflecting Christ
[1:07:20] amen see but the prophet says but when
[1:07:23] he come it finished the whole fight amen
[1:07:27] as we had read Sunday it finished the
[1:07:30] whole fight amen so it was Jesus Christ
[1:07:33] The Royal seed at the Royal seed a man
[1:07:37] who was born with the power as the
[1:07:40] prophet says in his veins to conquer
[1:07:43] death and Hell amen see he was more amen
[1:07:48] than just a natural seed amen he came
[1:07:50] from the Royal Seed of Abraham ain't
[1:07:54] that right and the prophet said he
[1:07:56] conquered sickness he conquered
[1:07:58] Temptation when the enemy spit in his
[1:08:00] face mowed his jaw he turned the other
[1:08:03] side when they jerked his head or his
[1:08:06] beard from his face and spit on upon him
[1:08:08] he never wrought back he conquered the
[1:08:11] Gate of Temptation and took it he
[1:08:13] conquered and took the Gate of the
[1:08:15] leprosy he took the Gate of fever amen
[1:08:18] he took and he made every nature obey
[1:08:21] him amen he made that and think of that
[1:08:24] church amen so all of this diseases and
[1:08:27] all these things that are out here that
[1:08:29] it is causing the world to fear and to
[1:08:32] tremble amen we stand here knowing that
[1:08:34] he conquered them things amen he
[1:08:37] conquered it all amen you can say Amen
[1:08:39] if you're a Believer amen he conquered
[1:08:42] it amen to where you don't have to fear
[1:08:44] it you don't have to worry about it and
[1:08:46] he even conquered death amen to where if
[1:08:49] you went by the way of the Grave you
[1:08:50] don't have to fear it amen because you
[1:08:52] know you'll raise again amen it's
[1:08:55] already been conquered ain't that right
[1:08:57] so we're not looking for a conquer we
[1:09:00] found a conqueror amen he created a body
[1:09:04] Amen to where he could bruise amen the
[1:09:07] devil's head amen by anatoman amen that
[1:09:11] he could live in another body and show
[1:09:13] forth his victory
[1:09:17] the natural seed had conquered Seas
[1:09:21] they had conquered nature
[1:09:24] they had conquered lions and Fire
[1:09:28] but they couldn't conquer death
[1:09:30] but Jesus conquered death hell and the
[1:09:33] grave
[1:09:34] he's the one
[1:09:36] David didn't do it
[1:09:37] Joseph even as perfect he only had one
[1:09:40] flaw but he couldn't do it
[1:09:42] they couldn't take the keys from Satan
[1:09:46] but this Concord did
[1:09:48] God would come in a body
[1:09:50] Amen in his fullness
[1:09:53] amen and all power in Heaven and Earth
[1:09:56] was given unto him that's what Jesus
[1:09:59] said amen and that body took the took
[1:10:02] took the took your sickness he took the
[1:10:05] everything that you that would bother
[1:10:07] you and he took all the darts and he put
[1:10:10] it in himself can you say amen and he
[1:10:13] and as the prophet said he took the
[1:10:14] stinger out of Satan
[1:10:17] you know I think oh isn't a wasp or a
[1:10:19] bumblebee or something like that and
[1:10:21] once they sting you it's over
[1:10:23] I can't sting you again
[1:10:25] well the prophet said that was the devil
[1:10:27] amen he sunk his stinger in so deep in
[1:10:31] Christ a man that he couldn't get it out
[1:10:34] amen now he has nothing to sting you
[1:10:36] with he's a liar to begin with he's an
[1:10:40] imitator to begin or a a uh he's won
[1:10:44] that that uh not imitates uh well he
[1:10:47] does that too but uh uh he makes people
[1:10:49] scared of him but all he is is a bluff
[1:10:52] can you say man amen for we we found the
[1:10:55] Conqueror a man that that would fulfill
[1:10:58] amen what God Said thy seed shall
[1:11:02] possess the Gate of his enemy amen
[1:11:05] that's right and Christ did that ain't
[1:11:07] that right so the prophet said the fight
[1:11:09] was finished at Gethsemane and that
[1:11:11] Calvary now we everybody say now we we
[1:11:15] stand as conquerors
[1:11:18] amen there's no fight to it you stand as
[1:11:21] a conqueror it's already finished are
[1:11:23] you with me church it's already finished
[1:11:25] no wonder he could justify you before
[1:11:27] you ever got here no wonder amen that he
[1:11:30] could already glorify you before you
[1:11:33] even done your first sin amen you we
[1:11:35] would always think well uh or maybe just
[1:11:38] in my mind that that I had the first to
[1:11:41] give my heart to God and then God would
[1:11:42] act upon that amen but I found that he's
[1:11:45] already done it before the foundation of
[1:11:47] the world because he knew he would
[1:11:49] become the Seed of Abraham he he would
[1:11:53] become the role see he would create a
[1:11:56] body and he would become that seed to
[1:11:58] defeat the Gate of the enemy can you say
[1:12:01] amen he took the fight
[1:12:04] amen he conquered
[1:12:06] amen and he rose again
[1:12:08] now as the body of Christ
[1:12:11] as the body
[1:12:13] we are heirs and Joint heirs with him in
[1:12:18] all the blessings in all the promises
[1:12:22] ah can you say man that's right see now
[1:12:25] we talk and we read about the body of
[1:12:28] Christ today and I I believe that that
[1:12:31] we are part of the body how many
[1:12:33] believes you're part of the body amen
[1:12:35] we're part of that body but maybe to get
[1:12:37] a clear picture as to who we are as the
[1:12:40] body I want to just talk a little bit
[1:12:42] more about the Covenant uh that God made
[1:12:45] to Abraham and and you see the prophet
[1:12:48] said the only way that we can be saved
[1:12:50] is by being in the Covenant with Abraham
[1:12:53] that's the only way a man can be saved
[1:12:56] is he has to be in the Covenant with
[1:12:58] Abraham now that means that God had to
[1:13:01] foreknow you that when God was given the
[1:13:04] Covenant and said it's to thy seed amen
[1:13:07] Sean Martin was on his mind can you say
[1:13:10] amen amen and I was in that Covenant
[1:13:12] right then and we say that we were you
[1:13:15] know we sing that song while he was on
[1:13:16] the cross I was on his mind now church
[1:13:18] that's a reality for he was making the
[1:13:21] Covenant he was confirming the Covenant
[1:13:23] amen right there he was God's covenant
[1:13:26] to Abraham amen and while he was there
[1:13:29] hanging on the cross and that Royal
[1:13:31] Blood was dropping down and and uh uh
[1:13:34] Redeeming the earth I was on his mind I
[1:13:37] was redeemed right then can you say amen
[1:13:40] amen that's right see the blood was for
[1:13:43] me amen so but see you you cannot you
[1:13:48] cannot be in the Covenant unless you're
[1:13:50] the Seed of Abraham for it's to his seed
[1:13:53] thee and thy seed ain't that right but
[1:13:56] we're not of the natural Seed of Abraham
[1:13:58] a man so we're not the children of
[1:14:01] Promise in that way amen we have no
[1:14:04] claims to the promise of Abraham as
[1:14:07] being a natural seed I'm not of Israel
[1:14:09] I'm not I'm not part of the Israel in
[1:14:12] the natural lineage amen but see we find
[1:14:15] out amen you're reading in the Bible
[1:14:17] listening to the message you find out
[1:14:19] that it's not the natural that counts
[1:14:22] out it's not a natural lineage it's not
[1:14:25] the natural seed a man for we find out
[1:14:28] that that Abraham had other Sons besides
[1:14:31] Isaac ain't that right amen and and and
[1:14:34] we find of course it was uh Ishmael but
[1:14:38] then he had seven or had other Sons a
[1:14:41] man uh uh you know uh after Isaac a man
[1:14:46] you know uh God had changed Abraham to
[1:14:49] youth again and so when Sarah died uh uh
[1:14:53] uh Abraham married another woman and had
[1:14:56] other Sons and Daughters by by her but
[1:14:59] they were not part of the Covenant amen
[1:15:02] they were natural seed but they were not
[1:15:04] part of the Covenant amen for in Genesis
[1:15:07] 21 12 God told Abraham and Isaac
[1:15:11] everybody say in Isaac in Isaac shall
[1:15:14] thy seed be called in Isaac amen so we
[1:15:18] we again see the election of God and
[1:15:22] amen and and I say it this way your
[1:15:24] natural lineage is not a guarantee a man
[1:15:28] of of uh anything when it comes to the
[1:15:31] promises of God Amen your parents could
[1:15:34] be holy and righteous and clean living
[1:15:36] and and spotless amen but but that does
[1:15:39] no guarantee that you're part of the
[1:15:42] promises of God can you say amen for
[1:15:44] it's not by a natural lineage amen we we
[1:15:48] find uh looking at even Joe Josephus the
[1:15:51] well-known historian he tells us that
[1:15:54] even Adam had 70 sons and uh or had 70
[1:15:58] children a and and uh of course a mix of
[1:16:02] sons and daughters and yet we only read
[1:16:05] of Abel and we only read of Seth after
[1:16:07] Abel you understand what I'm saying it
[1:16:10] was Enoch which was the seventh from
[1:16:12] Adam who was translated amen uh that he
[1:16:16] should not see death of who was of that
[1:16:19] lineage ain't that right see amen
[1:16:21] forward came from that lineage amen but
[1:16:24] he but but only he and his family a man
[1:16:28] uh uh went into the ark and and what
[1:16:31] happened to the rest of them you
[1:16:32] understand what I'm saying amen the
[1:16:34] Bible says or that the sons of God
[1:16:37] looked upon the daughters of of men and
[1:16:39] so that they were Fair the prophet says
[1:16:41] it was the sons of Seth a man that
[1:16:43] looked upon the daughters of men and
[1:16:45] committed adultery and and fornication
[1:16:48] and all this and and got destroyed the
[1:16:51] world ain't that right so it's not
[1:16:53] natural lineage if you're looking for
[1:16:55] natural lineage and and using that for
[1:16:57] your Alibi amen that that's not it ain't
[1:17:00] that right amen see so so we find it has
[1:17:03] to do with election so people think that
[1:17:07] all the Jews are God's chosen people but
[1:17:10] that's not true amen Romans 9 and 6 says
[1:17:13] breaking in Paul says they are not all
[1:17:16] Israel which are of Israel neither
[1:17:20] because they are the seed of Abraham are
[1:17:23] they all children ain't that right amen
[1:17:27] see and so brother Brown says see that
[1:17:29] don't make them Israelites now watch
[1:17:32] what are you typing brother Branham I'm
[1:17:34] typing the church see all that confess
[1:17:37] Christ is not Christians all that go to
[1:17:39] church are not Christians all Abraham's
[1:17:42] seed wasn't them uh did not have the
[1:17:46] promise amen all of Abraham's seed did
[1:17:49] not have the promise it was in Isaac
[1:17:51] shall thy seed be called
[1:17:54] ain't that right Amen in the eighth
[1:17:57] verse that is he says Paul says they
[1:18:00] which are the children of the flesh
[1:18:02] these are not the children of God but
[1:18:05] the children of the promise everybody
[1:18:07] say the children of the promise the
[1:18:10] children of the promise are counted for
[1:18:12] seed amen so not all the Seed of Abraham
[1:18:16] a man was counted of the promise amen
[1:18:19] not all of them was of of of of of of of
[1:18:23] the seed that God was speaking in the
[1:18:26] Mantra Amen brother Brown said it was an
[1:18:28] elect it was the promise and the promise
[1:18:31] was foretold to Abraham and the elect of
[1:18:34] God was for ordained before the
[1:18:36] foundation of the world so not all
[1:18:39] Israel is considered to be God's chosen
[1:18:43] people amen Revelation 7 tells us that
[1:18:47] God is going to take a hundred and forty
[1:18:49] four thousand Jews amen and and and that
[1:18:53] would be 12 son out of uh uh each tribe
[1:18:57] and there's 12 tribes ain't that right
[1:18:58] and he's going to seal them with this
[1:19:01] Spirit they are the ones who are really
[1:19:04] part of the Covenant amen amen they're
[1:19:08] the ones hey man but the rest of them
[1:19:11] are just cannon fodder and yet they're
[1:19:13] Jews ain't that right that God's got
[1:19:15] according to election he's got a number
[1:19:18] and he's going to seal 12 000 out of
[1:19:21] each tribe a man to be uh uh uh part of
[1:19:25] that that this in time uh uh uh when he
[1:19:28] when he deals with Israel amen he deals
[1:19:31] in other words he's dealing with Israel
[1:19:32] not all Israel amen but he's dealing
[1:19:35] with that 12 144
[1:19:37] 000. amen and when when Moses and Elijah
[1:19:40] come and begin to preach the message
[1:19:42] there will be 144 000 that'll accept
[1:19:45] this the message of the hour can you say
[1:19:48] amen amen that's right amen uh notice
[1:19:51] what the Jews now the Jews consider
[1:19:54] themselves all a part of the Covenant
[1:19:56] all Abraham's seed and and so they they
[1:20:00] look at what they said to Jesus in John
[1:20:02] 8 33 they answered him we be Abraham him
[1:20:06] seed but notice what Jesus said in the
[1:20:10] 37th verse I know that your Abraham's
[1:20:13] seed but you seek to kill me because my
[1:20:17] word everybody say my word has no place
[1:20:20] in you so there were Jews a man that
[1:20:25] were not that the word did not have any
[1:20:28] place in them the Covenant didn't mean
[1:20:30] amen anything to them ain't that right
[1:20:33] like it did to David like it did to Sham
[1:20:35] guards like it did to Moses like it did
[1:20:38] to all of the elect down Through the
[1:20:40] Ages ain't that right amen so now the
[1:20:43] prophet said see the real Seed of
[1:20:45] Abraham believes the promise just like
[1:20:48] Abraham did because it's to Abraham and
[1:20:53] his seed after him can you say Amen now
[1:20:58] so we we look for just a moment and I
[1:21:01] hope I'm making a little sense to you
[1:21:02] but the natural seed who were part of
[1:21:05] the Covenant said amen they were
[1:21:08] believers
[1:21:09] hey can you say man Daniel was a
[1:21:12] Believer and he was supernaturally
[1:21:15] delivered from the Lion's Den amen the
[1:21:18] prophet said a supernatural light a
[1:21:21] supernatural angel came down by a man
[1:21:23] that believed in the Supernatural he
[1:21:27] trusted in a supernatural God do you
[1:21:31] believe that amen the Hebrew boys were
[1:21:33] Believers amen they were thrown into a
[1:21:36] fire that was heated up seven times
[1:21:39] hotter amen than it has ever been do you
[1:21:43] realize we're living in an age that's
[1:21:46] seven times worse than it has ever been
[1:21:48] amen worse right here in the middle of
[1:21:52] it all that God would prove by that
[1:21:54] natural seed that if you're a Believer
[1:21:56] he will deliver you just like he did in
[1:22:00] them
[1:22:02] amen there is a Deliverance you don't
[1:22:04] have to worry about it you don't have to
[1:22:05] fear you say oh it looks Troublesome
[1:22:08] don't you fear you stand like that
[1:22:10] natural seed and say I believe God I
[1:22:13] don't care how bad it looks I don't care
[1:22:15] what kind of a situation stand there as
[1:22:18] a Seed of Abraham and say I believe
[1:22:20] regardless
[1:22:24] brother Brown said while they were in
[1:22:26] the midst of the fire there was a
[1:22:28] supernatural sign of a supernatural God
[1:22:31] standing in the fire supernaturally
[1:22:33] saving them
[1:22:35] God is supernaturally saving his people
[1:22:37] today they are supernaturally being
[1:22:40] redeemed there supernaturally amen
[1:22:42] there's a a suit by Supernatural there's
[1:22:46] a faith that is being built in them for
[1:22:48] a Rapture amen there's other people that
[1:22:50] listen to this message don't get nothing
[1:22:52] out of it but there is a Believer a man
[1:22:55] that by the supernatural there is a
[1:22:57] faith amen ready for a Rapture rapturing
[1:23:00] faith is being built in them because
[1:23:03] they are a believer
[1:23:06] [Applause]
[1:23:08] Moses was a believer
[1:23:10] Bill Graham said he believed in a
[1:23:12] supernatural God
[1:23:13] and it met him and talked to him in a
[1:23:16] supernatural way
[1:23:17] at a supernatural Bush at a supernatural
[1:23:20] fire on a bush and he got a supernatural
[1:23:23] message a one-man going down a one-man
[1:23:26] Invasion to take over Egypt a
[1:23:28] supernatural message but it was from the
[1:23:30] supernatural God and I stand here to
[1:23:33] tell you the message that we have
[1:23:34] received has come from a supernatural
[1:23:37] God it has come supernaturally it ain't
[1:23:40] some man-made gimmick it ain't some some
[1:23:42] man-made idea amen it was from God
[1:23:45] himself and I'm so glad that I'm part of
[1:23:47] it that I am a recipient for that
[1:23:50] Supernatural message that came from a
[1:23:52] supernatural God supernaturally
[1:23:55] delivered a natural people out of the
[1:23:57] land of Egypt
[1:24:00] come on now
[1:24:01] the prophet said the people were
[1:24:03] delivered supernaturally
[1:24:08] now
[1:24:09] how are we a part of the Covenant of
[1:24:11] Abraham
[1:24:13] see notice in thy seed
[1:24:15] in Isaac shall I see be called
[1:24:18] yet through Isaac
[1:24:21] come Christ
[1:24:22] the rule Seed of Abraham
[1:24:25] now listen now he's the Royal Seed of
[1:24:28] Abraham and through Isaac he came
[1:24:31] notice Christ was in Abraham Christ was
[1:24:35] in Isaac Christ was in Jacob look how he
[1:24:38] come Christ was in Joseph Christ was in
[1:24:42] Moses Christ was in David Christ was in
[1:24:45] Jeremiah amen he's coming down to that
[1:24:48] natural seed you understand what I'm
[1:24:49] saying amen and as you're looking at it
[1:24:51] we're not reading about man's lives
[1:24:53] we're reading about Christ amen Paul or
[1:24:56] brother Brown said if you read the Bible
[1:24:58] through and through and don't see Christ
[1:24:59] in every bit of it you need to read it
[1:25:01] again it was Christ coming down through
[1:25:03] that natural seed Christ was shown in in
[1:25:07] sham guard Christ was shown Amen in the
[1:25:10] Hebrew children Christ was revealed it
[1:25:13] was Christ the Christ Christ all the way
[1:25:16] through that natural seed can you say
[1:25:18] amen amen but he is the real true seed
[1:25:24] ain't that right
[1:25:26] now notice we're talking about natural
[1:25:28] and spiritual now
[1:25:30] the first seed was Isaac of Abraham
[1:25:34] which came by the natural
[1:25:36] a flesh
[1:25:39] ain't that right
[1:25:40] Bram said Abraham's seed was Isaac which
[1:25:43] is Jewish natural
[1:25:46] he was the Lesser son
[1:25:51] Isaac was Abraham's son sexually
[1:25:55] ain't that right
[1:25:57] something that Abraham produced
[1:26:02] but the second seed was Jesus Christ
[1:26:06] which was spiritually
[1:26:09] I Isaac came through a sex act
[1:26:13] Christ came by promise
[1:26:18] for he was God's word made manifest
[1:26:21] ain't that right
[1:26:23] see he came by promise you got you got
[1:26:26] to study the message now brother Graham
[1:26:28] talks about it he came by promise Christ
[1:26:33] came by promise not by sex act
[1:26:35] hello that's right Isaac came by what
[1:26:39] Abraham did
[1:26:41] [Music]
[1:26:43] Christ came by what Abraham believed
[1:26:47] ain't that Ryan
[1:26:49] so it is with the body of Christ today
[1:26:57] now notice John 1 12 as and as many as
[1:27:01] received him to them gave he power to
[1:27:04] become sons of God
[1:27:06] even to them that believe on his name
[1:27:10] which were born not a blood nor of the
[1:27:13] will of the flesh nor of the will of man
[1:27:17] but of God
[1:27:19] you were born by the will of God
[1:27:23] can you say Amen
[1:27:25] so when it comes to us as being the body
[1:27:27] of Christ there's no natural lineage
[1:27:30] tied to us
[1:27:32] there's no natural tied to us it wasn't
[1:27:36] a church that birthedist
[1:27:37] it wasn't a denomination that brought us
[1:27:41] we came by the will of God
[1:27:46] ain't that right so the prophet said
[1:27:48] you're the Royal lineage everybody say I
[1:27:51] am though the Royal lineage
[1:27:55] then he says you are the promise
[1:27:59] you are the promise
[1:28:01] nothing natural you are the promise
[1:28:03] ain't that right he said see the rule
[1:28:06] Seed of Abraham which is by faith in the
[1:28:09] promised word is now being made manifest
[1:28:12] on the Earth today
[1:28:14] who is it Jesus Christ the same
[1:28:17] yesterday today and for ever
[1:28:21] right ain't that right now he goes and
[1:28:25] says now Isaac was only substitutionary
[1:28:29] until Christ came
[1:28:31] so Isaac being of the natural seed was a
[1:28:34] type of Christ
[1:28:36] just as much as Rebecca was the type of
[1:28:38] the Bride
[1:28:40] Isaac was substitutionary
[1:28:44] until Christ come
[1:28:46] and through the natural seed of Isaac
[1:28:48] look at that little lineage
[1:28:51] and what they conquered
[1:28:53] look at the enemy they defeated
[1:28:56] look at the supernatural that worked
[1:28:58] through that substitutionary
[1:29:00] but it was only until Christ came
[1:29:04] ain't that right
[1:29:06] yes sir so Christ did not come by
[1:29:10] Abraham's natural life but rather by
[1:29:13] Abraham's faith
[1:29:16] in the word of God
[1:29:18] see so the natural seed of Isaac finally
[1:29:21] failed the prophet said and died
[1:29:24] it backslid and hybrid too
[1:29:27] but notice the faith Seed of Abraham
[1:29:30] that he believed God's word regardless
[1:29:33] of what the circumstances was there you
[1:29:36] are who he says you know I just feel
[1:29:39] like shouting look the faith Seed of
[1:29:42] Abraham what was it not Abraham's body
[1:29:46] that produced Christ but Abraham's faith
[1:29:50] that produced that seed ain't that right
[1:29:53] Abraham's faith in what God's word no
[1:29:57] matter what come he called anything
[1:30:00] contrary to it as though it wasn't even
[1:30:03] there
[1:30:04] [Applause]
[1:30:07] and what was Jesus neither Jew nor
[1:30:09] Gentile he was God
[1:30:13] ain't that right he didn't come
[1:30:15] reflecting a Jew he didn't come
[1:30:16] reflecting Gentile he was the body of
[1:30:20] God
[1:30:29] said he came by Abraham's spiritual life
[1:30:33] who took everything contrary to God's
[1:30:35] word and called it as though it was not
[1:30:37] and believed God against hope he
[1:30:39] believed in hope that's the real seed
[1:30:42] that we're speaking of Amen now Abraham
[1:30:45] could only be a father of many nations
[1:30:47] through Christ not through Isaac
[1:30:51] can you say man
[1:30:52] Abraham look in Revelation 7 and 9.
[1:30:55] after this I be held in law a great
[1:30:58] multitude a man which no man can number
[1:31:02] now notice he's not speaking of the
[1:31:04] nation of Israel a man of the natural
[1:31:06] seed but he says of all Nations and
[1:31:09] kindreds and peoples and tongues stood
[1:31:14] Before the Throne and before the lamb
[1:31:16] clothed uh with white robes and Palms in
[1:31:19] their hands and cried with the loud
[1:31:21] voice saying salvation to our god which
[1:31:24] sitteth upon the throne and unto the
[1:31:27] lamb can you say Amen see amen notice
[1:31:30] Romans 4 and 16 therefore it is of faith
[1:31:35] that it might be of grace to the end the
[1:31:39] promise might be sure to all the seed
[1:31:43] not to that only which is of the law but
[1:31:46] to that also which is of the faith of
[1:31:49] Abraham who is the father of us all
[1:31:52] ain't that right so now we can find out
[1:31:55] that every nation amen peoples of every
[1:31:58] nation tongues and language amen can be
[1:32:01] included in this Seed of Abraham in the
[1:32:04] promises in The Inheritance that God
[1:32:07] gave Abraham as an Everlasting Covenant
[1:32:10] a Grace Covenant can you say Amen but it
[1:32:13] can only be by the Royal see Jesus
[1:32:16] Christ could Abraham become the father
[1:32:19] of us all
[1:32:21] [Music]
[1:32:23] you see Faith produces what God Said
[1:32:26] so God wasn't dependent upon Abraham
[1:32:29] a man to to produce the seed on his own
[1:32:33] the seed would come by his faith in
[1:32:37] God's word do you realize faith gets you
[1:32:39] somewhere faith can move mountains faith
[1:32:42] can bring things into existence faith
[1:32:44] can bring things out of existence
[1:32:47] your faith can defeat the devils
[1:32:50] your faith can bring life to people
[1:32:55] it's true
[1:32:57] that's what that's what a prophet said
[1:32:59] if you have enough faith for yourself
[1:33:02] then have faith for that law wayward son
[1:33:04] or daughter
[1:33:05] no matter how Wayward they are even if
[1:33:08] God has to put them on a death's bed
[1:33:10] they'll be there anyhow
[1:33:15] by faith
[1:33:18] all things are possible to them
[1:33:21] that believe
[1:33:23] is that right
[1:33:25] so his faith Abraham's faith in God's
[1:33:27] word produced a supernatural seed
[1:33:31] amen see the promised word brother Brown
[1:33:34] said was that raw seed what God promised
[1:33:37] there was Christ everything that God
[1:33:40] promised was there in Christ in that
[1:33:43] body now today it stands the same thing
[1:33:46] everything that God promised is now in
[1:33:49] the body today
[1:33:56] so brother Graham said the sacrifice is
[1:33:58] paid the rule seed died the Royal seed
[1:34:01] rose again now everybody say now
[1:34:05] he's not giving us a history lesson in
[1:34:07] stopping
[1:34:09] now he brings it today the church
[1:34:14] stands Justified
[1:34:16] by believing that
[1:34:20] God believe in that work of calvary
[1:34:23] not by what you do what you don't do
[1:34:24] it's by believing
[1:34:26] regardless of the circumstance I believe
[1:34:29] how do you know because the work is
[1:34:31] finished and I believe it
[1:34:33] ain't that right
[1:34:35] amen see it stands justified by
[1:34:38] believing that and the rule seed the
[1:34:40] Royal seed Christ can come into these
[1:34:43] people
[1:34:44] and even make them join heirs Sons and
[1:34:47] Daughters of God is that not what
[1:34:49] happened to you
[1:34:51] Christ God almighty came and chose your
[1:34:55] body before he could do it he had to
[1:34:57] redeem you he had to cleanse you up
[1:35:00] justify you sanctify you
[1:35:03] [Music]
[1:35:04] give you a supernatural birth
[1:35:09] can you see amen see so now we are the
[1:35:13] rule Seed of Abraham
[1:35:15] remember Paul said from him begat many
[1:35:17] sons from him the seed be yet many sons
[1:35:23] notice in in Galatians 3 and 29 Paul
[1:35:28] writes if ye be christs
[1:35:32] then you are Abraham's seed and heirs
[1:35:36] according to the promise I think it
[1:35:39] behooves us
[1:35:40] to look at this book as promises
[1:35:44] [Music]
[1:35:46] it all depends who you are
[1:35:50] not every scripture applies to the bride
[1:35:53] and not every scripture applies to the
[1:35:55] foolish virgin not every scripture
[1:35:58] applies to The Sinner
[1:36:00] and ungodly
[1:36:01] yellow now I know we've had ministers
[1:36:05] mix it all up
[1:36:06] and they have tried to threaten the
[1:36:08] bride they have tried to to put pressure
[1:36:10] on people
[1:36:12] you can't do it it's promises
[1:36:16] we are Heirs of the promise
[1:36:21] ain't that right if God can't do it who
[1:36:25] can
[1:36:26] if God is the one that saved you he
[1:36:29] saved you to make you an heir of a
[1:36:31] promise
[1:36:32] not to be afraid of God not to Amen to
[1:36:35] fear God oh yeah you fear Him in a
[1:36:38] reverence
[1:36:39] but not fear Him in the way that he's
[1:36:41] going to strike you that it is
[1:36:43] impossible for a Believer Amen to cross
[1:36:47] the line
[1:36:53] amen
[1:36:55] so if you be Christ's
[1:36:58] then you argue Abraham's seed and heirs
[1:37:01] according to the promise and brother
[1:37:02] Brown says it like this if you be in
[1:37:05] Christ
[1:37:07] then you are Abraham's seed
[1:37:10] not according to the flesh
[1:37:12] but according to the promise
[1:37:15] ain't that right
[1:37:17] see so brother Brown says now these who
[1:37:19] are of the Roll seed are the elect of
[1:37:22] God are the predestinated foreknown of
[1:37:25] God and were in the mind of God in his
[1:37:28] thoughts
[1:37:29] in very plain language the true bride of
[1:37:32] Christ was in the mind of God
[1:37:35] eternally
[1:37:37] I know you're you're you're you're
[1:37:39] you're in time here
[1:37:41] and things happen in time
[1:37:45] that it can never change what has been
[1:37:47] eternal
[1:37:49] and what is eternal
[1:37:53] ain't that right
[1:37:55] when it comes to Eternity time is just a
[1:37:58] little glitch
[1:38:00] just a little scratch
[1:38:03] when it comes to Eternity there's not
[1:38:05] spaces
[1:38:06] it's just a scratch
[1:38:12] so your little lifespan of
[1:38:16] say you lived a thousand years
[1:38:19] it's just a little scratch in in in and
[1:38:24] it never God doesn't look at them things
[1:38:26] I hope you understand God looks at what
[1:38:30] you've always been
[1:38:33] that's right that's good
[1:38:35] so what you are here can never change
[1:38:42] you know trying to even imagine trying
[1:38:46] to even describe how time is to God is
[1:38:48] impossible
[1:38:50] but we do know what was Paul that would
[1:38:53] say A Thousand Years is as a day
[1:38:57] so could you imagine what your 70 years
[1:39:00] is like to God
[1:39:03] just a millimeter of a second
[1:39:06] to God
[1:39:08] to us it seems like forever
[1:39:10] but God is just
[1:39:15] oh I love him
[1:39:17] you were eternal
[1:39:19] Hallelujah
[1:39:20] and and it'll never be erased from God's
[1:39:23] mind
[1:39:24] can you say man
[1:39:26] so here we find he says now see that you
[1:39:30] was in the mind of God
[1:39:32] eternally though not expressed until
[1:39:34] each came forth in the designated
[1:39:38] decreed season
[1:39:41] and as each member came forth it became
[1:39:45] expressed and took place in took its
[1:39:49] place in the body
[1:39:51] yes amen not natural body
[1:39:55] Supernatural body
[1:39:57] word body thus this bride is the literal
[1:40:01] everybody say literal
[1:40:03] spoken word seed bride
[1:40:09] and though she is feminine in
[1:40:11] designation she is also called the body
[1:40:14] of Christ
[1:40:16] it is very apparent that she ought to be
[1:40:19] called that for she was predestinated in
[1:40:22] him
[1:40:23] came from the same Source was eternal
[1:40:26] with him and is now manifesting God in a
[1:40:31] many membered body whereas once God was
[1:40:34] manifested in one member even our Lord
[1:40:37] Jesus Christ
[1:40:40] ain't that right so now as Jesus came
[1:40:44] forth by the word for he was the word so
[1:40:47] does this body of Jesus Christ today
[1:40:50] come forth by the word
[1:40:52] [Applause]
[1:40:54] for she is the word the word spoke of
[1:40:56] her
[1:40:57] First Corinthians 12 13 for by one
[1:40:59] Spirit are we all baptized into one body
[1:41:04] and notice now First Peter 1 22 he says
[1:41:08] being born again
[1:41:10] remember Jesus told Nicodemus except a
[1:41:12] man be born again he cannot see the
[1:41:14] kingdom of God and Nicodemus in His
[1:41:16] Brilliant intelligent intellectual
[1:41:18] carnal mind
[1:41:19] thought that he was speaking about
[1:41:21] entering the his mother's womb again he
[1:41:23] says how does a man enter his mother's
[1:41:25] womb again for the second time to be
[1:41:27] born again
[1:41:28] but then Peter explains how that birth
[1:41:30] happens being born again not of
[1:41:33] corruptable seed a sexual seed but of
[1:41:37] incorruptable by the word of God
[1:41:40] which liveth and abide us forever
[1:41:43] oh I hope you understand that you could
[1:41:46] not have a new birth except the word of
[1:41:49] God spoke of you there is a whole book
[1:41:52] of promises that was already foretelling
[1:41:55] of you
[1:41:56] thank you
[1:41:59] ain't that right
[1:42:02] so what is she the prophet said she is
[1:42:04] flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life
[1:42:07] of his life power of his power she is
[1:42:11] him
[1:42:13] ain't that right
[1:42:15] I hope it makes some sense to you today
[1:42:17] we are of that Royal seat of Abraham
[1:42:20] not by natural lineage
[1:42:23] but by this word
[1:42:27] so according to the Bible
[1:42:29] we see that the bridegroom and the bride
[1:42:32] must have blood relation
[1:42:34] they will be blood relation
[1:42:37] Isaac which type the the uh which was
[1:42:40] the type of Jesus Christ married his own
[1:42:43] blood relation his cousin ain't that
[1:42:46] right
[1:42:46] see and brother Brown said that's why
[1:42:49] she could go to the Waters of life so
[1:42:52] quickly
[1:42:54] this is why the angel of the Lord could
[1:42:57] speak to her
[1:42:58] she was blood relation to Isaac
[1:43:01] oh man
[1:43:03] see and he says a blood relation is who
[1:43:07] the angel of the Lord can speak to today
[1:43:12] the voice of God speaking today falls on
[1:43:15] many deaf ears
[1:43:17] millions of people can understand the
[1:43:19] voice of God and now he explains it
[1:43:22] you've got to be a blood relation
[1:43:25] there has to be a relation can you say
[1:43:27] amen and if he was their old seed I am
[1:43:31] that roll seed that's why the voice of
[1:43:33] God can speak to you today
[1:43:36] they were both they were blood relation
[1:43:38] not by mothers but by fathers
[1:43:41] and you say amen and Jesus said God was
[1:43:44] his father
[1:43:45] and the same father that was his father
[1:43:47] is our father
[1:43:49] [Music]
[1:43:50] Spirit can you say man in word so the
[1:43:54] bride the Bride In Christ are of the
[1:43:57] same word see do you believe that
[1:43:59] both were predestinated before the
[1:44:01] foundation of the world both carried the
[1:44:04] word Gene within them both have the same
[1:44:07] life within them have the same spirit in
[1:44:10] them both have the same power in them
[1:44:13] their blood relation
[1:44:16] ain't that right
[1:44:18] and and so that's why each of us have
[1:44:21] come uh uh see blood relation to Christ
[1:44:25] brother Branham says see uh uh through
[1:44:28] the sacrifice when our sins are emitted
[1:44:30] by the blood of Jesus not by what some
[1:44:33] church says what somebody else says but
[1:44:36] what the blood has done and proved that
[1:44:40] it's done by the word working to the
[1:44:43] same thing carrying out the same
[1:44:46] Ministry he had
[1:44:48] that's why we cannot just put it all on
[1:44:50] brother Branham
[1:44:52] but the works that I did Jesus said
[1:44:54] shall you do also that wasn't just
[1:44:57] speaking of brother Brown that was
[1:44:58] speaking to his role seed bride why
[1:45:01] they're of the same relation the same
[1:45:04] word that spoke of him now speaks of us
[1:45:08] and we are inheritance we are heirs with
[1:45:11] him
[1:45:14] heirs can you say Amen Church
[1:45:17] heirs God choose you for this last day
[1:45:20] the worst age ever
[1:45:21] to show that your Heir is a promise
[1:45:26] yes sir
[1:45:28] so you gauge in your Christianity by how
[1:45:31] you feel
[1:45:33] you're not doing it according to Abraham
[1:45:34] did it
[1:45:36] amen
[1:45:38] that's right so Isaac can Rebecca now
[1:45:42] notice they could marry being cousins
[1:45:44] they could marry because her seed was
[1:45:46] strong
[1:45:47] where Brown said their seed was strong
[1:45:49] the seed wasn't weak as it is today
[1:45:52] ain't that right
[1:45:54] and the seed that's in Christ and the
[1:45:56] Bride is a strong seed
[1:45:59] it ain't weak
[1:46:01] Church seeds weak
[1:46:04] hello
[1:46:05] they can't be United
[1:46:07] God can't Unite with the weak seed
[1:46:10] but this bride seed is strong
[1:46:13] because she's bone of his bone flesh of
[1:46:15] his flesh she's she's strong she'll take
[1:46:17] every word
[1:46:19] she'll count everything a lie
[1:46:22] it's strong enough to defeat the enemy
[1:46:24] with if Jesus can do it you can do it
[1:46:27] if Jesus stood it by the words you can
[1:46:30] stand by this word Jesus defeated the
[1:46:32] devil based upon the word of God he had
[1:46:35] power upon power upon power but he used
[1:46:37] not a want to show that the weakest
[1:46:39] Christian can take the word and defeat
[1:46:41] the same Devil by
[1:46:44] yeah this this seed ain't it ain't weak
[1:46:46] it's a word seed it isn't become weak
[1:46:49] with all this hybridization and Creeds
[1:46:51] and dogmas and all that can you say man
[1:46:54] it's a pure word seed
[1:46:59] and notice brother Brown said Rebecca
[1:47:01] made her decisions quick watch her real
[1:47:04] quick then in the meeting
[1:47:06] quickly if they're ordained to life
[1:47:08] they'll know it there's something in the
[1:47:11] message that stares them that's what
[1:47:13] steered Rebecca see the message stared
[1:47:16] her for the angel was leading her
[1:47:20] can you say amen he says in another
[1:47:22] place there's no way at all of getting
[1:47:25] to him getting a man to God unless he's
[1:47:28] predestinated to be a Son of God there's
[1:47:31] just no way of doing it amen Jesus said
[1:47:33] no man can come to me except my father
[1:47:36] draws him and that's the truth
[1:47:38] everything he did there was something
[1:47:40] contrary see everything he did there was
[1:47:43] somebody to to be contrary to it if he
[1:47:46] did it this way well then it was
[1:47:48] supposed to be this way and this way see
[1:47:51] it was supposed to be back that way see
[1:47:53] it's just unbelief amen see every
[1:47:56] Everything he'd done there was always
[1:47:58] someone to question it everything he did
[1:48:00] it didn't matter how Supernatural it was
[1:48:02] there was always a crowd there being a
[1:48:05] skeptic and why did you do it this way
[1:48:06] why didn't you do it this way and and
[1:48:08] all that and brother Ben just plainly
[1:48:10] says it's because of unbelief
[1:48:13] ain't that right it takes being blood
[1:48:16] relation
[1:48:19] aren't you glad you're the body of Jesus
[1:48:20] Christ
[1:48:22] Lord praise the Lord amen so Jesus is
[1:48:26] the word he says and he is the
[1:48:28] bridegroom and the Bride is a part of
[1:48:31] the groom
[1:48:32] therefore the word that is to be
[1:48:34] fulfilled this day is the same part of
[1:48:38] the word that was fulfilled in his day
[1:48:41] and it's the same word same experience
[1:48:45] same life
[1:48:48] another place he said watch what God did
[1:48:51] to the Royal seed to make the Covenant
[1:48:53] confirm he took Christ which was the
[1:48:56] Seed of Abraham on Calvary he tore him
[1:48:58] apart he took the spirit off of him and
[1:49:01] put his body in the grave and his soul
[1:49:03] in hell and raised him up on the third
[1:49:05] day and raised up his body and brought
[1:49:08] it up into glory and there sent the
[1:49:10] spirit back down and kept the body on
[1:49:13] his right hand side
[1:49:15] sent the spirit back down to live in the
[1:49:19] church to make a church just so much
[1:49:22] with the Life of Christ that in the
[1:49:24] Resurrection the two will come together
[1:49:25] bride and bridegroom the church in
[1:49:28] Christ will be exactly alike with the
[1:49:31] same kind of ministry the same kind of
[1:49:33] power same kind of spirit he raised up
[1:49:36] the body of Jesus Christ and set him on
[1:49:38] his right side his right hand and poured
[1:49:41] down the spirit upon the church on the
[1:49:43] day of Pentecost and that's how he
[1:49:45] proved his Covenant with his church
[1:49:48] and that's how he proves that you're
[1:49:50] part of this Covenant amen and that
[1:49:52] you're part of the church is the same
[1:49:54] power same life the same word is now in
[1:49:57] you quickening you
[1:49:59] [Music]
[1:50:00] the Seed of Abraham
[1:50:04] another place brother Brown said we're
[1:50:05] born by Christ
[1:50:08] which makes us
[1:50:11] the supersede
[1:50:13] with Christ to God
[1:50:19] we're supersede
[1:50:26] I know this is simple
[1:50:28] but I hope it gets down into your soul
[1:50:32] we're supersede
[1:50:35] not by flesh
[1:50:37] not by the natural
[1:50:39] not because you got a lineage of
[1:50:44] a family tree that was all Christians
[1:50:47] not because your grandpa was in a brand
[1:50:49] of meeting
[1:50:51] can you say Amen
[1:50:53] you're supersede because you were
[1:50:55] birthed by Christ
[1:50:57] that rules seed
[1:51:00] Hallelujah
[1:51:02] don't look at your flesh
[1:51:04] look at what you are by the birth
[1:51:07] can you say man
[1:51:09] now we've talked about it notice in
[1:51:11] second Corinthians 5 17 If any man be in
[1:51:14] Christ he is a new creature he is a new
[1:51:16] creation
[1:51:19] oh things are passed away and behold all
[1:51:21] things are become new
[1:51:23] one place brother Brian said when you
[1:51:25] receive the Holy Ghost your sexual blood
[1:51:27] is dismissed
[1:51:29] buddy that means a lot
[1:51:33] your sexual blood is dismissed
[1:51:36] everything that was passed down to the
[1:51:37] genealogy of your family tree is
[1:51:39] dismissed
[1:51:41] I don't care what it is if it's in the
[1:51:43] physical if it's in the middle you say
[1:51:44] well my family's been mental had mental
[1:51:47] complications it's dismissed
[1:51:50] why because you're a rule Seed of
[1:51:53] Abraham
[1:51:54] you are what God was talking about thee
[1:51:57] and thy seed shall possess the Gate of
[1:52:00] its enemy
[1:52:01] can you shame I am you say well then if
[1:52:04] if Jesus conquered the gates then why am
[1:52:06] I having to fight amen is to show that
[1:52:09] he was Victorious remember Satan's
[1:52:12] already been stripped
[1:52:14] you're fighting a defeated enemy I think
[1:52:16] even the prophet said that you're
[1:52:18] fighting a defeated enemy
[1:52:22] when Jesus fought him he had your grand
[1:52:25] Satan had the grounds but Jesus defeated
[1:52:28] him by paying the atonement and the
[1:52:30] Redemptive price
[1:52:32] ain't that right there is no sacrifice
[1:52:35] that is needed anymore there is no more
[1:52:37] need for the shed the blood to be shed
[1:52:39] again
[1:52:40] now you have that token and that token
[1:52:43] must need to be displayed and that token
[1:52:45] is not natural blood it's the very life
[1:52:48] Supernatural life of God living in you
[1:52:52] now you're defeating and you're you're
[1:52:54] you're dealing with a defeated enemy
[1:52:56] quit let him talk to you
[1:52:59] quit let him defeat you
[1:53:02] quit listening to the lies that tell you
[1:53:06] that you're a defeated individual
[1:53:09] you're the super seed your blood
[1:53:12] relation
[1:53:14] you realize you're more than what that
[1:53:16] natural seed was
[1:53:18] if a natural seed if God could use the
[1:53:20] natural seed to defeat the natural enemy
[1:53:22] what can God do through a royal seed
[1:53:29] roll seed
[1:53:32] what is it you're the body of Jesus
[1:53:36] Christ
[1:53:37] the same God that lived in that one body
[1:53:41] is now living in you
[1:53:46] it's Christ in you
[1:53:49] not you and Christ it's Christ in you
[1:53:53] we read that quote
[1:53:55] a while back brother Brown says I'll
[1:53:58] choose a people
[1:53:59] and through them
[1:54:01] I'll defeat my enemy through them
[1:54:05] that's right and you say man
[1:54:07] let the sickness come and through them
[1:54:10] sickness will be defeated
[1:54:14] let that old cancer come and through
[1:54:16] them that cancer will be defeated
[1:54:24] you believe it
[1:54:29] people don't like the Old Testament
[1:54:30] because it's it's it's you know it's
[1:54:32] hearing someone the other day said it's
[1:54:33] just too gruesome you know what actually
[1:54:35] they're trying to they're trying to take
[1:54:38] stories out of the Bible That's too
[1:54:40] gruesome
[1:54:43] I think it was one professor in a
[1:54:44] Christian College
[1:54:46] if I remember right in a Christian
[1:54:48] College just just the other day reading
[1:54:51] from the Bible from the Old Testament
[1:54:52] and a group of people got together that
[1:54:55] the students got together
[1:54:57] to to take that out since he had no
[1:55:00] right to to read that
[1:55:02] I don't know what it was maybe it's
[1:55:04] Joshua's standing on a king's head
[1:55:06] I don't know but it was gruesome to them
[1:55:11] but you know what what they don't get
[1:55:14] is every in the net they were a natural
[1:55:16] people conquering if you can let quit
[1:55:19] this ringing
[1:55:21] in the the natural people conquering
[1:55:23] natural Gates
[1:55:26] but they were only testifying of what
[1:55:28] you would do in the Supernatural
[1:55:31] there there were Gates that were
[1:55:33] stronger than them
[1:55:35] that they could not defeat
[1:55:38] but you're on this other side of
[1:55:40] California
[1:55:41] you're on the other side of the
[1:55:42] atonement you you remember now they
[1:55:45] could do that under a blood atonement
[1:55:47] but it was a natural blood
[1:55:50] ain't that right they did they conquered
[1:55:53] remember Moses amen speaking flies into
[1:55:55] existence and brother Brown said he
[1:55:57] could only do that by natural blood he
[1:55:59] was under a blood atonement but it was a
[1:56:01] natural blood
[1:56:02] what can the church do under a royal
[1:56:05] blood
[1:56:07] when the true enemy has been defeated
[1:56:09] and conquered now you can go to your
[1:56:12] gate you can that the thing that is
[1:56:14] troubling your family you can stand up
[1:56:16] that gate and say devil you're a liar
[1:56:18] you've already been conquered I ain't
[1:56:20] gonna believe you
[1:56:22] see you're you're you're now fighting
[1:56:24] off of a finished fight
[1:56:27] you with me now see they were standing
[1:56:31] looking ahead to be done you're standing
[1:56:34] looking back and see what has already
[1:56:35] been done so now you're defeating on
[1:56:38] what has been done and if the blood of
[1:56:41] Jesus Christ ain't that strong then why
[1:56:43] are we serving God but it is so strong
[1:56:46] that you can defeat every devil of hell
[1:56:48] you can stand there based upon the
[1:56:51] action of calvary
[1:56:55] and now that rule blood is flowing
[1:56:57] through your veins his his do you
[1:56:59] realize that the very literal life of
[1:57:01] God is in you
[1:57:03] deity is not in heaven it's in you you
[1:57:07] are that body of Jesus Christ today
[1:57:14] your hands your mouth your eyes your
[1:57:16] feet are his
[1:57:19] see he done it
[1:57:21] at work to bring
[1:57:23] and I I really like that
[1:57:26] he done it
[1:57:28] to bring Satan defeat Satan
[1:57:33] so that he could bring you submissive
[1:57:37] to him
[1:57:39] oh man you love him
[1:57:42] the Royal Seed of Abraham
[1:57:46] now we know
[1:57:50] that Jesus reveals himself in Revelation
[1:57:52] as the beginning of the creation of God
[1:57:57] but we see that we are the continuation
[1:58:01] of the creation of God
[1:58:03] Abraham said now every son that you eat
[1:58:06] and born of a natural sexual birth the
[1:58:10] way you come see then when it it comes
[1:58:13] to a place to where you go through water
[1:58:15] baptism then Holy Ghost baptism
[1:58:18] then the Holy Ghost comes down at the
[1:58:20] fire baptism
[1:58:22] and claims this creation
[1:58:24] the same as he did him
[1:58:29] the Holy Ghost and God is the same
[1:58:31] Spirit it comes down and claims this
[1:58:34] body for the resurrection
[1:58:37] he was raised for our justification
[1:58:39] all the father has given me will come
[1:58:42] not one will be lost I'll raise it up at
[1:58:45] the last day not one hair of the head
[1:58:48] will even perish
[1:58:50] that is the beginning of the creation of
[1:58:52] God this is the continuation
[1:58:57] of the creation of God
[1:59:00] see it was through his blood cell
[1:59:02] that your natural blood cell was broken
[1:59:05] away
[1:59:06] brother Brown says now you're enshrouded
[1:59:09] you are enshrouded
[1:59:12] with the blood cell of Abraham's seed
[1:59:15] which is Christ
[1:59:17] there is no iniquity
[1:59:20] no filth inside of that blood cell
[1:59:26] for it can only contain the life of God
[1:59:29] which is the Holy Ghost
[1:59:33] aren't you glad for that
[1:59:35] what it means to have the Holy Ghost
[1:59:39] there's no filth in it there's no
[1:59:41] iniquity in it
[1:59:45] what you are born of is a new creation a
[1:59:48] blood cell which is of god word
[1:59:52] and in that blood cell that you're
[1:59:54] surrounded by and shrouded by there's no
[1:59:57] filth there's no iniquity there's
[1:59:58] there's nothing there but God Holiness
[2:00:02] righteousness
[2:00:08] empty musicians will come
[2:00:11] brother Brown says in this day there is
[2:00:14] to come a super
[2:00:16] raw Seed of Abraham
[2:00:19] when 2 000 years ago no this day
[2:00:24] that's exactly what it'll be
[2:00:28] would be a royal bride to the Royal
[2:00:33] promised son
[2:00:37] what's happening to show that your blood
[2:00:41] relation amen the show that the same
[2:00:44] life flows in your veins has it done him
[2:00:47] that's a conquering life
[2:00:50] it's a creative life
[2:00:55] and every word that he fulfilled now
[2:00:58] you're fulfilling
[2:00:59] now the same Ministry
[2:01:04] same Ministry
[2:01:06] was he a conqueror yes he was and you
[2:01:09] are too
[2:01:10] did heal the sick yes he did and this
[2:01:13] bride this body is too
[2:01:15] hello
[2:01:17] for you to walk over for people to walk
[2:01:19] away claim him and to be the body of
[2:01:21] Christ and do away with the supernatural
[2:01:22] shows they're not blood relation
[2:01:25] ain't that right
[2:01:27] he said now as I spoke last night it
[2:01:29] won't be a natural seed it'll be a
[2:01:31] spiritual seed
[2:01:33] there is to be a spiritual bride raise
[2:01:36] up which will be the rule seed of the
[2:01:38] rule faith of Abraham's rule son
[2:01:41] she is to come on the scene in the last
[2:01:43] days and the time and the place is a
[2:01:46] promise that's given to her
[2:01:49] according to Malachi 4 a scripture there
[2:01:52] is to rise a message that'll shake the
[2:01:55] hearts of the people right back to the
[2:01:58] apostolic fathers again
[2:02:01] why to bring forth that word bride that
[2:02:04] Royal bride
[2:02:06] Theirs to rise on the scene and the
[2:02:08] power of Elijah that'll rise on the
[2:02:10] scene A wilderness man that'll come out
[2:02:12] and will have a message that will run
[2:02:14] right straight back to the word again
[2:02:16] and that's the hour we're living in
[2:02:22] you realize you're not a product of a
[2:02:24] church you're a product of this message
[2:02:27] your faith ain't coming in from inspired
[2:02:30] or come in existence by a Creed of man
[2:02:32] or some uh uh uh false Revelation or
[2:02:36] some personality of a man it comes
[2:02:39] straight by restored word that came from
[2:02:42] a Malachi for
[2:02:45] wow
[2:02:47] because your children of promise
[2:02:49] promise
[2:02:51] preacher promise no God promised
[2:02:55] ain't that right
[2:02:57] so this Malachi 4
[2:03:00] that the prophet is calling you by the
[2:03:04] word
[2:03:05] Glory
[2:03:07] why that's your identification was that
[2:03:11] not Jesus's identification he found
[2:03:14] himself he identified who himself by the
[2:03:18] word
[2:03:20] and if you remember he told them
[2:03:22] Skeptics and them doubters if you really
[2:03:25] want to know who I am go search the
[2:03:27] scriptures you claim to know
[2:03:29] for they testify of me
[2:03:32] that's my vindication
[2:03:36] and so is it today the word of God is
[2:03:39] this rule bride's vindication
[2:03:42] it speaks of us
[2:03:45] you want to know if you can conquer look
[2:03:47] at what the word says
[2:03:49] no weapon formed against you shall
[2:03:51] prosper
[2:03:53] that's what the word says it speaks of
[2:03:56] you can you say man you love him
[2:03:59] amen
[2:04:01] what song
[2:04:03] in the book is mine
[2:04:08] oh every promise in the book is mine
[2:04:15] every chapter every verse every line
[2:04:23] trusting in his love divine
[2:04:29] every promise in the book is mine saying
[2:04:35] now oh every promise in the book
[2:04:39] is mine
[2:04:42] [Music]
[2:04:43] every chapter every verse every line
