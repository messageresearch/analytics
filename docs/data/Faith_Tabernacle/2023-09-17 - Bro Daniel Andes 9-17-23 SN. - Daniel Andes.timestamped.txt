[25:21] um through our prayers

[26:25] way for them to see the life of it I
[26:27] don't know where they stand spiritually

[42:51] sometimes we don't appreciate and it's
[42:53] sometimes you have to go my wife and I
[42:56] were talking the other day about Samson
[42:57] how did he didn't know what it was not
[43:00] to have the power he just always when
[43:03] the you know the the lion come out he
[43:05] tore him apart when when they trapped
[43:08] him in Gaza he just picked up the gates
[43:10] and so he started playing with Delilah
[43:12] he didn't know what it was brother Sean
[43:13] did not have the power until he had
[43:15] forfeited it Eve didn't know what death
[43:18] was amen it would be a shame that we
[43:20] would walk without the Lord or somewhere
[43:23] have to backslide to appreciate being in
[43:25] the house of the Lord amen have the
[43:27] presence of the Lord the freedom of the
[43:29] Holy Spirit we have a sister in our
[43:31] church she visits China her parents her
[43:34] mother's in China and they don't have
[43:35] the ability to to meet together they
[43:37] kind of have to meet in an apartment
[43:39] meant they can't sing brother Sean they
[43:41] just whisper they can't worship they
[43:43] can't and we have the ability in America
[43:45] to praise God to shout and scream and
[43:47] glorify him he would be a shame brother
[43:50] Daniel we'd have to go to a communist
[43:51] Nation before we'd ever appreciate being
[43:53] able to Worship the Lord amen I believe
[43:56] uh there in the Psalms he said let
[43:58] everything that hath breath praise the
[43:59] Lord so I don't know what God's will is
[44:01] for my life well I know one thing if
[44:03] you're breathing God's will is for you
[44:05] to praise the Lord and Worship the Lord

[45:37] appreciate that about brother Sean and
[45:39] the Martin family they've always loved
[45:41] the Bible and loved the word of God I
[45:43] love a church that believes in the
[45:44] message of the hour you all don't seem

[46:13] message God already Vindicated a message
[46:15] I'm here to tell you it's the truth I'm
[46:17] here to tell you that God you're doing
[46:19] the right thing
[46:20] you're doing the right thing by
[46:22] believing this message and going to a
[46:23] church that believes the message of the
[46:25] hour Saint John chapter 15 just one
[46:28] verse here in Saint John verse chapter
[46:30] 15 verse 16. ye have not chosen me but I
[46:35] have chosen you
[46:37] is that in red in your Bible how many
[46:39] have a Red Letter Bible
[46:40] Jesus didn't speak and read letters but
[46:42] somebody had this idea like let's take
[46:44] the letter the words of Jesus and put
[46:46] them in red and Jesus said to you you
[46:48] haven't chosen me but I've chosen you
[46:52] now I ask you we could just take right
[46:54] there we could just take that and say
[46:56] God chose me
[46:57] Jesus chose me he told me he chose me
[47:00] amen but he had a reason for that and he
[47:03] chose you and ordained you that you
[47:05] should go and bring forth fruit and that
[47:08] your fruit should remain what is your
[47:10] fruit it's your testimony it's your life
[47:13] he said I want your fruit and your
[47:15] testimony to remain that whatsoever ye
[47:18] shall ask of the father in my name he
[47:20] may give it thee we got to read verse 17
[47:24] don't we these things have I commanded
[47:26] you that you love one another
[47:29] that's not one of the 10 suggestions
[47:31] that's a commandment I've commanded you
[47:33] must love one another now he didn't say
[47:35] you got to agree with one another
[47:37] so many times we have this in America if
[47:39] I can't say I love you because we
[47:41] disagree on something well I'm here to
[47:43] tell you we're probably not always going
[47:44] to see things eye to eye but one thing
[47:46] we have a commandment we got to love one
[47:48] another
[47:49] amen go back to Colossians behind that
[47:52] Colossians chapter 1.
[47:56] this Bible is God in letter form
[47:59] it's God in letter form holy men of God
[48:02] were moved by the Holy Ghost which is
[48:04] the eternal spirit of God and they wrote
[48:06] this Bible
[48:09] Colossians 1 verse 15.
[48:12] who is the end of Isabel let's back up
[48:14] to verse 13. who hath delivered us from
[48:17] the power of darkness and hath
[48:19] translated us into the kingdom of his
[48:21] dear son in whom we have Redemption
[48:23] through his blood even the Forgiveness
[48:25] of sins who is the image of the
[48:28] invisible God the firstborn of every
[48:30] creature for by him were all things
[48:33] created
[48:35] that are in heaven that are in Earth
[48:37] invisible visible and invisible whether
[48:40] they be Thrones or dominions
[48:41] principalities or Powers all things were
[48:43] created by Him and for him
[48:46] by him and for him so if he chose you he
[48:49] created you the Bible says all things
[48:51] were created by Him but they were also
[48:53] created for him so if God created you
[48:56] you were created for Jesus Christ that
[48:59] you might bring forth fruit verse 17. he
[49:02] is before all things and by him all
[49:05] things consist all things are held
[49:07] together wouldn't that mean a nation
[49:09] that we have is held together by Christ
[49:11] so when you ask Christ to leave your
[49:14] schools to leave your church he's the
[49:16] word right so when you ask the word to
[49:18] leave your church then the churches
[49:20] don't consist they're not held together
[49:21] our society we had a President Obama
[49:24] that went 20 times around the world and
[49:26] said America is no longer a Christian
[49:28] Nation and so when we've asked him to
[49:31] leave and not be our god it doesn't
[49:33] consist and we see it falling apart or
[49:35] educational system our military our
[49:37] financial system because the Bible says
[49:39] by Jesus Christ everything is held
[49:42] together and I'm going to preach right
[49:43] through this all right this is my savior
[49:45] this is Jesus Christ this is the this
[49:48] man here is Mount the Fulfillment of
[49:50] Malachi 4 that Jesus sent behold I send
[49:53] you Elijah the prophet that would bring
[49:55] us a message and turn our hearts back to
[49:58] Jesus Christ not to William Branham to
[50:01] Jesus Christ and he was before all
[50:03] things all things were created by Him
[50:05] and for him he is my savior he is my
[50:07] redeemer I'm trying to get you to Jesus
[50:10] Christ any true man of God is trying to
[50:12] get you to Jesus Christ as our Savior by
[50:15] him all things consist he is the head of
[50:17] the body the church who is the beginning
[50:19] the firstborn from the dead that in all
[50:22] things he might have the preeminence and
[50:25] it pleased the father that in him should
[50:27] all fullness dwell amen may God add his
[50:30] Blessing to the word you may be seated
[50:34] amen I might read two more verses there
[50:37] if you still have your Bibles keep your
[50:39] Bibles close I'm a Bible believer that's
[50:40] the name of our church back home Bible
[50:42] Believers so we believe the Bible what
[50:46] we believe comes from the Bible
[50:48] Brandon brought a message it wasn't a
[50:50] new message from a cloud out here it was
[50:53] the already written word revealed
[50:55] they told Brother Randolph said brother
[50:57] bam you could write the 23rd chapter of
[51:00] Revelation you could do it with all the
[51:02] Miracles and signs and wonders he said
[51:04] no no I can't do it because the Bible
[51:06] says if you add to the book or you take
[51:09] away from the book your part will be
[51:10] taken from the book of light for the
[51:12] plagues will be added to you so what we
[51:14] believe has to come from the scripture
[51:16] so if I teach you something that's not
[51:18] in the scripture you don't have to
[51:20] believe it but if I breathe if I bring
[51:22] something from the word of God then you
[51:24] have to believe it man shall not live by
[51:25] bread alone but by every word that
[51:28] proceeds out of the mouth of God and I
[51:29] know you have a pastor that believes
[51:31] this amen I know he believes the word of
[51:33] God verse number 26 let's go down
[51:36] Colossians 1 26 even the mystery which
[51:39] hath been hid from ages and from
[51:41] Generations but now is made manifest to
[51:44] his Saints to whom God would make no one
[51:47] what is the riches of the glory of this
[51:49] mystery among the Gentiles which is
[51:52] Christ in you the hope of glory it was a
[51:56] mystery before but now it's been
[51:58] revealed in this day what is it it's
[51:59] Christ inside of you Christ in you the
[52:03] hope of glory a great Revelation brother
[52:05] and preaches a message called the token
[52:07] amen he tells us as the holy spirit is
[52:09] not not a sensation it's not an emotion
[52:12] it brings a sensation it brings an
[52:14] emotion but it's the very literal life
[52:17] of Jesus Christ Living inside of an
[52:20] individual now that's just not something
[52:22] we just say or a tingle up the spine but
[52:24] it's something a very sober seriousness
[52:27] to say I have the life of Jesus Christ
[52:30] Living inside of me I tell you that's a
[52:32] sober Revelation it'll cure road rage
[52:35] it'll cure it's an anger management cure
[52:38] when you're like Daddy is that really
[52:40] the Life of Christ
[52:41] so they asked brother Branham in
[52:43] questions and answers they said I've got
[52:45] a temper and how do I he said sweeten
[52:48] your temper with prayer
[52:49] so when that little boy says daddy daddy
[52:52] you need to go pray whatever's coming
[52:56] out of you isn't the Life of Christ you
[52:58] need to go swim Sweden you see how
[53:00] serious it is when you say I've got the
[53:01] Holy Ghost you say I have the token I
[53:03] have the life of Jesus Christ oh may God
[53:06] help us it's more than just amen running
[53:08] and shouting Niles which we all believe
[53:10] in that because that Life of Christ will
[53:12] produce an emotion anything that doesn't
[53:14] have any motion we better bury it right
[53:16] amen so it should have an emotion we got
[53:18] too much dead religion laying around
[53:20] even around our message I said Lord
[53:22] bring me alive amen you hath he
[53:24] quickened who are Once Dead and sin and
[53:26] trespasses it should Quicken us way away
[53:29] from a life of sin and evil amen and
[53:31] bring it to us a life that's a living
[53:33] amen that's the thought I want to bring
[53:35] tonight if we would take chosen to bring
[53:37] forth fruit chosen to bring forth fruit
[53:40] as we read here in the scripture Christ
[53:42] is the image of the invisible God and
[53:45] brother Rand preaches this message
[53:46] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[53:48] and he tells us that all of the Psalms
[53:51] and all of the scriptures portrayed
[53:53] Jesus Christ amen the invisible God and
[53:56] now God became flesh yeah we were
[54:00] talking the other day and and my wife
[54:02] and I've portrayed the Trinity and I I
[54:04] was raised
[54:06] um I was talking to brother Sean in the
[54:08] back room brother Wendell had posted uh
[54:10] had just mentioned something just the
[54:12] the background of where he'd been and
[54:13] his his father I appreciated their
[54:17] father wonderfully and the path that
[54:19] they journeyed through the denominations
[54:21] and the Pentecost and into a great
[54:23] message and the the power of this
[54:25] message and how it brought such a depth
[54:27] and stability to our lives how's the one
[54:30] man said I got tired of going to church
[54:32] every day to prove to myself that I was
[54:34] saved and to prove to everybody else
[54:35] that I would say because of some emotion
[54:38] amen and it went deeper than that that I
[54:40] was an attribute in the mind of God
[54:42] before the foundation of the world
[54:43] Galatians says because you were Sons he
[54:46] sent forth the spirit of his sons to
[54:48] find you all that the father hath given
[54:50] me they will come to me amen and so what
[54:53] what is it it's yielding to the Holy
[54:54] Spirit that's drawing at our heart I say
[54:57] Lord Here I Am Lord and I yield all all
[54:59] of my life to you Lord and receiving the
[55:02] holy spirit is as easy as yielding to
[55:04] God and say Lord Here I Am Lord take
[55:06] anything that's not like you Lord take
[55:08] it out on me and fill me with the Holy
[55:09] Spirit how many would like to be filled
[55:11] with the Holy Spirit tonight say Lord
[55:13] just baptize me from the top of my head
[55:15] to the bottom of my feet Lord you've
[55:18] chosen me and you've not just chosen me
[55:20] to say I'm chosen but you've chosen me
[55:22] to thou I might bear fruit
[55:24] that I might bear fruit and there's
[55:26] something about it I see our brother
[55:28] here how old are you brother
[55:30] 75 years old now they get a little older
[55:33] the devil tell you look you're all
[55:34] washed up you're nothing but I'm here to
[55:36] tell you there's this magic is all right
[55:38] if I just share a few things from my
[55:39] heart you know that there's a there's
[55:41] this come a magical age and I don't know
[55:43] where it is brother Sean but you can say
[55:44] anything and people just they don't
[55:46] persecute you you don't lose your job
[55:48] you don't lose Social Security you can
[55:51] just say anything so when the devil
[55:52] tells you washed up you say no I'm
[55:54] getting close to that age where I can
[55:56] witness for the Lord and and the
[55:58] barbershop I can win sir the Lord on an
[56:00] airplane I can witness for the Lord in
[56:02] the grocery store and it came as a
[56:04] revelation to me one day we were flying
[56:06] on an airplane and this lady said Merry
[56:08] Christmas and I'm too old to care if I
[56:11] offend anybody
[56:12] and I thought you know that is you get
[56:15] to that age the devil says look you can
[56:17] but you can just say anything you say
[56:19] Jesus Christ is my savior the blood of
[56:21] Jesus Christ cleanses me from all sins
[56:23] this world in our nation is held
[56:25] together by Jesus Christ what are they
[56:28] going to do to you step on your oxygen
[56:30] and hoes oh we're going to live and be a
[56:33] light for the Lord and shine a light as
[56:35] long as we can when we sing that little
[56:37] song This Little Light of Mine I'm gonna
[56:39] let it shine I'm gonna let it shine I'm
[56:41] gonna let it shine in the darker and the
[56:43] darker it gets the greater and greater
[56:45] the light shines you can be in this room
[56:48] and maybe turn on a little light and it
[56:50] doesn't do much but I tell you you turn
[56:52] all the lights out here you can take
[56:53] this light on this on this pack right
[56:55] here this little green light and you
[56:57] could take that little green light and
[56:59] shine in here and it'll illuminate you
[57:00] can almost find your way and we're
[57:02] living in such a dark hour whatever
[57:04] little light you got just shine it just
[57:07] shine it amen we sing that little song
[57:08] Take the name of Jesus with you when you
[57:10] get in trouble just say the name of
[57:12] Jesus Jesus amen because there's power
[57:15] in the name of Jesus when you say Jesus
[57:18] the devil flees he hates the name of
[57:20] Jesus I learned that years ago there's
[57:22] two things the devil hates he hates the
[57:24] name of Jesus Christ and he hates the
[57:26] blood of Jesus Christ because we read it
[57:28] we're made nigh by the blood of Jesus
[57:30] Jesus Christ not by some Revelation in
[57:32] our mind but amen by the blood of Jesus
[57:35] Christ and faith in Jesus Christ now we
[57:37] don't realize it but we're living by
[57:38] faith we just talk about it they talk
[57:41] about these movies that all the movies
[57:43] now have uh have some type of magic or
[57:46] or witchcraft in them and the devil's
[57:48] just catching up that that the devil and
[57:51] his perversion but you know what we've
[57:52] been walking around shaking people's
[57:53] hand and saying God bless you I put a
[57:56] blessing on you I put a blessing if
[57:57] we've been doing that for years have we
[58:00] not we should have been and they're
[58:01] coming around and cursing people and
[58:03] cursing people and cursing people amen
[58:05] they're just really late you know they
[58:07] come out with these movies called
[58:09] zombies walking or whatever the people
[58:10] but the Bible you go away back in the
[58:13] Bible the Bible says she that is dead
[58:15] and she that liveth in pleasure is dead
[58:17] while she yet lives so the devil is just
[58:20] making movies about what God has told us
[58:22] many many years ago oh I love the word
[58:25] of God I love being a part of it I I'm
[58:27] there's great power brother Sean and
[58:30] knowing that he chose us and he didn't
[58:32] choose us on a particular night amen he
[58:35] chose us before the foundation of the
[58:37] world and he made a list and he put our
[58:40] names on it amen putting names on it on
[58:42] that list and you say I don't remember
[58:43] those verses well this is the way you
[58:45] remember I got a bad memory so I got all
[58:47] these crutches you know so people like
[58:49] oh I gotta crutch I'm trying to get
[58:51] along like we all have crutches
[58:53] I've got contacts in my eyes and I can't
[58:55] drive I can barely get around my house
[58:57] without my my vision so bad brother Sean
[58:59] I put these contacts in and it helps me
[59:01] and maybe you've got a little crutch and
[59:03] maybe take a little medicine or
[59:04] something it helps you get through life
[59:06] right maybe we can all sing Perfect
[59:08] Pitch and we have a piano or a keyboard
[59:10] it helps us get through our song service
[59:11] right so we have these little things but
[59:13] our goal is to bear fruit if I need a
[59:16] little crutch along the way I'll get a
[59:18] little crutch along the way to to lead
[59:19] me and help me through this life I'm
[59:21] just you know we we start at zero over
[59:23] here a little timeline you children we
[59:25] start at zero and Bible says by reason
[59:28] of you know it's three score and ten
[59:30] which is 70 and by reason of strength 80
[59:32] years old and I call them bonus years
[59:34] after that you get those bonus years 100
[59:36] and 110 you know we're all just trying
[59:38] to make it from the Cradle to the Grave
[59:40] right we're just trying to make it if
[59:42] somewhere in there the Lord comes in a
[59:43] Rapture we're going in a Rapture I need
[59:45] all the help that I can to get me
[59:47] through this life can you say Amen to
[59:48] that something somebody sings a little
[59:50] song like and we get to this little mind
[59:52] and say like I don't agree with them so
[59:55] I'm going to throw that out no no no no
[59:56] no no if it helps us along the way I
[59:59] think brother Brown said it he said it's
[1:00:01] a selfish uh jealousy spirit that won't
[1:00:03] acknowledge a chiropractor or the
[1:00:05] surgeon or or somebody that helps uh
[1:00:08] make life a little easier for somebody
[1:00:10] hey man I think that's what we ought to
[1:00:12] do is just make life a little easier for
[1:00:14] somebody try to help them along the way
[1:00:16] there's enough hurting people in this
[1:00:17] world
[1:00:18] true I got this sign on my wallet says
[1:00:20] people are fighting a battle that you
[1:00:22] know nothing nothing about
[1:00:25] how many times brother Sean we've come
[1:00:27] to services and have a prayer and people
[1:00:29] come up pray and say this was my last
[1:00:31] service I was done I was going out but
[1:00:33] God has a way of catching us amen the
[1:00:36] God has a way of finding you wherever
[1:00:38] you go Psalms 139 he says if I had to
[1:00:41] send down into hell Thou Art there if I
[1:00:43] go up to heaven Thou Art there amen
[1:00:45] wherever I go he's there he knows how to
[1:00:47] find us amen he knows where we are he's
[1:00:50] got our number as we say he's got our
[1:00:52] number and he knows where to find us
[1:00:54] even he brings a guy from Indiana comes
[1:00:56] down and speaks something maybe we don't
[1:00:58] know anything about but God I don't know
[1:01:00] you you don't need me know me but God
[1:01:02] knows you he knows all about us he knows
[1:01:04] every tear we've cried he knows every
[1:01:06] heartache he knows every pain that we've
[1:01:08] suffered amen he come to bind up the
[1:01:11] brokenhearted tonight maybe you're
[1:01:13] bearing a heavy burden in your heart but
[1:01:15] he knows all about it amen he knows
[1:01:17] every tear that you've cried every
[1:01:19] heartache every pain that you're going
[1:01:21] through he's a high priest that can be
[1:01:23] touched by our feelings of our
[1:01:25] infirmative this we preach so much
[1:01:27] against feelings but the Bible uses that
[1:01:30] word he said he's a high priest who can
[1:01:32] be touched by our feelings Lord I feel
[1:01:35] lonely tonight Lord I feel afraid
[1:01:37] tonight Lord I don't know what I'm going
[1:01:39] to do about social security Lord I don't
[1:01:42] know what I'm going to do about this
[1:01:43] situation oh it just doesn't come to lay
[1:01:45] people it comes to ministers away Lord I
[1:01:47] don't know what I'm going to do about
[1:01:48] that I don't have all the answers Lord I
[1:01:50] need you Lord no papa God will you hold
[1:01:52] my hand will you strengthen me will you
[1:01:55] help me and if God be for us who could
[1:01:57] ever be against us greater is he that is
[1:02:00] in you than he that is in the world do
[1:02:02] you believe that tonight I believe it
[1:02:04] because it's the word of God even when I
[1:02:06] don't believe it I believe the word of
[1:02:08] God I believe God's word is true and
[1:02:11] everybody that believed God's word they
[1:02:13] came out all right in the end
[1:02:15] I don't know any of the names of the
[1:02:17] people that were outside the ark but I
[1:02:19] know him sham and japon amen I know the
[1:02:22] name of Noah I don't know any of those
[1:02:24] people that died when the Red Sea closed
[1:02:26] up I know Pharaoh's name is just in a
[1:02:28] disgrace that God raised him up and
[1:02:29] hardened his heart but I know Moses I
[1:02:31] know Jude I know Levi I know Miriam I
[1:02:34] know are you with me tonight I say let's
[1:02:36] just believe God's word hey man I'm not
[1:02:39] really smart but there's one thing
[1:02:41] better than learning from your mistakes
[1:02:43] is learn from somebody else's mistakes
[1:02:45] like it didn't come out well for those
[1:02:47] that stood against the message of the

[1:04:23] believe I say that's what Believers
[1:04:26] believe you I know there's a lot of
[1:04:27] revelation we believe he came as the son
[1:04:29] of man who revealed himself as a word
[1:04:31] amen but it's no different and people
[1:04:33] get caught up between the you know the
[1:04:35] the the the shout the voice and the
[1:04:36] trumpet I tell you let me just explain
[1:04:38] it this way when the shout come it was
[1:04:40] such a great thing after 2000 years if
[1:04:42] not the shout was such a powerful
[1:04:44] manifestation of God there was ministers
[1:04:46] and preachers like wow this this is it
[1:04:48] there's nothing else there this is so
[1:04:50] this is a and it was the coming of the
[1:04:52] Lord in in Revelation of the word but
[1:04:55] the second part about the the voice that
[1:04:57] raises the dead is going to be another
[1:04:58] great great part when they raise in the
[1:05:01] dead and Grandpa and Grandma and they
[1:05:02] come and they they're sitting there
[1:05:04] that'll be a just as great as the shout

[1:05:09] to the Revelation the message the
[1:05:11] Rapture I know when we're caught up and
[1:05:13] we meet the Lord in the air amen and
[1:05:15] brother around said that's something
[1:05:16] that you feel in your heart that

[1:05:20] evil desires and that feeling that
[1:05:21] whatever that was he said someday you'll

[1:06:07] it don't go to the world and the
[1:06:08] Fashions of the world if you love the
[1:06:10] world the things of the world the love
[1:06:11] of God's not even in you well stay with
[1:06:13] the author of the book he chose us and
[1:06:15] ordained us to bring forth fruit to
[1:06:17] bring forth a testimony say Lord I'm
[1:06:19] gonna stay with you
[1:06:21] blessed be the name of the Lord I my
[1:06:24] things timing out here I don't know
[1:06:26] praise the Lord amen many scriptures if
[1:06:29] you have your Bibles Luke keep them
[1:06:31] Close to You Luke chapter 10 read a few
[1:06:34] scriptures here Luke chapter 10 I love
[1:06:37] ministry that's in the Bible
[1:06:39] amen too much Ministry sometimes gets
[1:06:42] outside of the Bible but we need to stay
[1:06:44] in the Bible
[1:06:45] amen sometimes like I said some people
[1:06:47] want to get a great Revelations outside
[1:06:49] the Bible they forget that this message
[1:06:51] all came from the Bible brother random
[1:06:53] said now another Revelation because the
[1:06:55] opening of The Seven Seals and he said
[1:06:56] now turn in your Bible
[1:06:58] amen the word of God is a seed and so
[1:07:00] the prophet of God came and he took the
[1:07:01] revelation of serpent seed or
[1:07:04] predestination or the son of man or all
[1:07:07] these great future homes the God of this
[1:07:08] evil age and he'd say turn in your Bible
[1:07:10] and then the word of God became manifest
[1:07:12] it began to grow and grow and he
[1:07:13] preached a three-hour sermon and the
[1:07:15] other day I listened to spoken word as
[1:07:17] the Original Seed a six-hour message and
[1:07:19] it's such a powerful powerful thing I've
[1:07:22] been studying the Ministries because
[1:07:23] brother randoms wasn't the only Healing
[1:07:25] Ministry there was A.A Allen and Jack
[1:07:27] Cole and Oral Roberts and so I went back
[1:07:29] and thought wow what does brother random
[1:07:31] listen in 1962 if you'll go back and
[1:07:34] read it it's it's interesting if you
[1:07:36] take Jesus ministry with three and a
[1:07:38] half years right the son of man and so
[1:07:40] if you take from 1962 it kind of started
[1:07:42] there in the in in uh in around
[1:07:45] March or April Berlin preaches the
[1:07:47] spoken word his Original Seed he said
[1:07:48] I'm gonna I owe it to you all to show
[1:07:50] you why my Ministry is on the decline
[1:07:53] he preaches a six-hour message he said
[1:07:55] there's three kinds of seeds that have
[1:07:57] been sown one is the denominational C he
[1:07:59] said that's Billy Graham he said one is
[1:08:01] the Pentecostal charismatic movement
[1:08:03] which is Oral Roberts isn't it amazing
[1:08:04] that oral means from your voice and oral
[1:08:07] something that spoke or Oral Roberts it
[1:08:09] was the Pentecostal movie where they
[1:08:10] believed speaking in tongues was the
[1:08:12] evidence the Holy Spirit and he said the
[1:08:13] third seed is the word of God and he
[1:08:16] said now all these seeds have been sown
[1:08:18] he said now we're going to wait for a
[1:08:19] crop to come up and we see the
[1:08:21] denominations begin to rise up and then
[1:08:23] we saw the the Pentecostal movement all
[1:08:25] went to a charismatic Jesus only
[1:08:27] movement a glossiola that I don't have
[1:08:29] time to preach the whole thing and he
[1:08:31] said but there's a word bride there's a
[1:08:33] word that's been sown as well there's a
[1:08:35] people that believe that everything we
[1:08:36] believe has got to come from the Bible
[1:08:38] and he said now these two seeds the
[1:08:40] denomination and the Pentecostal he said
[1:08:42] they'll merge together amen all together
[1:08:44] but he said show me where they're in the
[1:08:46] scripture show me water baptism in Jesus
[1:08:48] name show me Holiness in there a woman
[1:08:50] to cut her hair when Paul's all that she
[1:08:53] just a woman Paul was a woman hater Paul
[1:08:55] said If any man think himself to be
[1:08:57] spiritual let him acknowledge that the
[1:08:59] things that I write unto you are the
[1:09:01] Commandments of God so he had a prophet
[1:09:04] amen he preached the word of God and
[1:09:05] said everything we preach and believe
[1:09:07] has to come from the scripture amen oh
[1:09:09] no don't you love doesn't that give you
[1:09:11] a strength to know that what I believe
[1:09:12] comes from the Bible we were just in
[1:09:15] Salt Lake City I had to go up to see um
[1:09:17] we were up on vacation there in Utah and
[1:09:19] I thought well we'll just go to salta
[1:09:21] Lake City and I've seen the whole Joseph
[1:09:22] Smith and heard the whole story and he
[1:09:24] got an amazing story but what as I think
[1:09:27] brother Raymond said this evening he
[1:09:28] said I don't doubt that an angel came to
[1:09:30] Joseph Smith he said but what the angel
[1:09:32] said to Joseph Smith was contrary to the
[1:09:34] scripture and they had to write another
[1:09:36] Bible to vindicate their message we
[1:09:38] didn't have to write a Bible amen the
[1:09:40] prophet of God said go back and read
[1:09:41] your Bible the Bible says I will put
[1:09:43] enmity between your seed and the serpent
[1:09:46] seed the prophet of God just said read
[1:09:48] it serpent seed didn't come from William
[1:09:49] random it came from the Bible he just
[1:09:51] said go back and read it there's no
[1:09:52] place in the Bible that anybody was
[1:09:54] baptized in the titles of Father Son and
[1:09:56] Holy Spirit he said go back and read
[1:09:58] your Bible again everywhere they were
[1:09:59] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:10:01] if there is wisdom I'm just preaching
[1:10:03] the Bible okay and if there was somebody
[1:10:05] that was baptized any other way than in
[1:10:07] the name of Jesus Christ Acts chapter 19
[1:10:09] they had to go back and be re-baptized
[1:10:11] in the name of Jesus Christ that they
[1:10:12] would receive the Holy Spirit oh isn't
[1:10:15] that wonderful to know what you believe
[1:10:16] comes right from the Bible and say oh
[1:10:18] well you all are long hair long skirts
[1:10:20] Prophet y'all are a cult well I don't
[1:10:23] care what you call me Paul has said in
[1:10:24] the way that's called heresy so
[1:10:26] worshiped by the god of our fathers amen
[1:10:28] we worship Jesus Christ amen Luke
[1:10:31] chapter 10 verse 21.
[1:10:34] the Bible says in this hour in that hour
[1:10:36] Jesus rejoiced in the spirit and said I
[1:10:38] thank thee Oh Lord oh Father Lord of
[1:10:42] Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these
[1:10:44] things from the wise and prudent and has
[1:10:46] revealed them unto babes even so father
[1:10:49] for so it seemeth good in thy sight you
[1:10:53] mean that God would actually hide
[1:10:55] something and say it was be good yes
[1:10:58] that's what the Bible says but in
[1:11:00] another place he said blessed are your
[1:11:02] eyes for they see blessed are your ears
[1:11:05] for they hear I ask you tonight what are
[1:11:07] you doing in this building we make this
[1:11:09] thing so complicated amen the Bible says
[1:11:11] no man can come except the father draws
[1:11:13] him but something has drawn you to come
[1:11:15] to church tonight can you say Amen to
[1:11:16] that unless you're five years old and
[1:11:18] Mommy and Daddy brought you because they
[1:11:19] know in the presence of God every seed
[1:11:21] will manifest what it is and we keep and
[1:11:24] that's the thing if kids get out and
[1:11:25] they date and this and that or whatever
[1:11:26] but you know the Bible says what is it
[1:11:28] um Hebrews chapter 4 12 everything is
[1:11:31] naked and bare in the sight of God so
[1:11:34] you bring into the presence of God and
[1:11:35] it'll manifest whatever seed is there it
[1:11:37] just meant it doesn't change the seed it
[1:11:40] just manifests what's is inside of it I
[1:11:42] mean there's something about the
[1:11:43] presence of God Amen it's the water
[1:11:45] there's something about the sunlight
[1:11:46] which is the word of God and it shines
[1:11:48] and every seed begins to manifest amen
[1:11:51] manifest what it is that we got around
[1:11:53] our message and my wife and I were
[1:11:54] listening to it this morning
[1:11:56] uh brother random when he first got
[1:11:58] among the Pentecostal people he said I
[1:12:00] was standing there and they were
[1:12:01] speaking in tongues he said I didn't I'd
[1:12:03] never he said that was the first time I
[1:12:05] encountered he tells it in his life
[1:12:06] story man speaking in tongues and
[1:12:08] another one interpreting he said I had a
[1:12:10] gift I got close to him found out one
[1:12:12] was a real man of God the other one was
[1:12:13] living in adultery brother bam said I
[1:12:16] didn't understand that he said I just
[1:12:17] kind of got away from him he didn't
[1:12:18] speak against it he just kind of got
[1:12:20] away from it a little bit but then later
[1:12:22] on he realized that the rain falls on
[1:12:24] the just and it falls on the unjust now
[1:12:26] he preached a message called The False
[1:12:28] anointed ones at the end time actually
[1:12:30] and it was the anointed ones that took
[1:12:32] down and so we we around our message we
[1:12:34] get so worried about the false annoying
[1:12:36] ones at the end time we don't want any
[1:12:37] rain to fall but I can tell you the
[1:12:39] predestinated sea will never grow if
[1:12:41] they don't get the rain I said send down
[1:12:44] the rain Lord send down the rain Lord I
[1:12:46] need the rain Lord I want to grow I want
[1:12:48] to be manifested I want to grow and
[1:12:50] produce fruit you'll never produce fruit
[1:12:52] without the rain
[1:12:54] I got a message called let it rain let
[1:12:57] it rain we need the rain Lord and let's
[1:12:59] stop worrying about if that brother's a
[1:13:00] terror that sister's a terror and
[1:13:02] everything about their life that's okay
[1:13:03] if they're not right God will lead them
[1:13:05] and guide them into all truth that's the
[1:13:07] evidence the Holy Spirit when he the
[1:13:08] spirit of Truth has come he will lead
[1:13:10] you and guide you into all truth oh what
[1:13:13] a rest that is to every one of them say
[1:13:15] well this brother isn't right or that's
[1:13:17] that church is this but if they are
[1:13:19] children of God and they have the Holy
[1:13:20] Spirit it will lead them it will guide
[1:13:23] them into all truth now you may be up in
[1:13:26] ninth grade or tenth grade spiritually I
[1:13:28] might just be in third grade but you
[1:13:30] have patience with me and you believe
[1:13:32] that I got the spirit of God and if I
[1:13:33] don't see it just right just like
[1:13:35] brother manham didn't understand he
[1:13:36] walked away and then God revealed it to
[1:13:38] him oh the rain falls on the just and it
[1:13:41] falls on the unjust alike we just got to
[1:13:44] stay in the rain we got to stay in the
[1:13:46] rain too many times we see somebody I
[1:13:49] mean they like well I know that brother
[1:13:50] or that sister they're not living right
[1:13:51] and then they well I'm just going to
[1:13:53] stop going to church I'm I'm not going
[1:13:54] to go to those meetings anymore I'm not
[1:13:56] because I've seen a tearing but you
[1:13:58] don't realize it's the rain we need the
[1:13:59] rain
[1:14:00] send down the rain Lord Brother around
[1:14:03] says this in the message Christ is the
[1:14:04] mystery of God revealed if a man says
[1:14:06] he's born again and try to place these
[1:14:08] promises of God and some in these last
[1:14:10] days in some other age making him Christ
[1:14:12] yesterday but not today then that man or
[1:14:14] that person has been in a delusion by
[1:14:17] Satan
[1:14:18] so Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:14:20] today and forever amen if that man says
[1:14:23] he believes that and it doesn't manifest
[1:14:25] itself through him Jesus said Mark 16
[1:14:28] these signs shall follow them that
[1:14:29] believe into all the world in every age
[1:14:32] casting out Devils speaking with tongues
[1:14:34] and all the great manifestations of the
[1:14:36] gifts that would follow that they shall
[1:14:39] not they may or they ought to but they
[1:14:41] will heavens and earth will pass away
[1:14:43] but my word want won't brother Branham
[1:14:46] goes on to say if you have your Bibles
[1:14:48] let's go to Saint John chapter 14.

[1:15:40] the alphabet was C I don't remember but
[1:15:43] I just know it right so we have these

[1:16:59] at a time
[1:17:01] amen footsteps mean possession foot
[1:17:03] accepts me in possession say brother Dan
[1:17:06] I'm so low I feel like I'm the soul of
[1:17:08] the bottom of the body of Christ but
[1:17:10] you're still a part of the body of
[1:17:11] Christ you're still a part of the body
[1:17:14] of Christ I might be the least of the
[1:17:16] least but when this body makes a step
[1:17:17] amen I'm a part of it amen when it takes
[1:17:20] another step I'm a part of it and man
[1:17:22] we're not living back in the 60s we're
[1:17:24] not living in the 70s anymore some of
[1:17:26] you have been around a long time this is
[1:17:27] 2000 2023 and by now we should start
[1:17:31] seeing fruit
[1:17:33] we should start seeing mature Christians
[1:17:35] amen that are not blowing about with
[1:17:38] every wind of Doctrine can you say Amen
[1:17:40] to that some churches are tied to their
[1:17:42] Pastor come on somebody say Amen Pastor
[1:17:45] makes a mistake and backside the whole
[1:17:46] church backslide you weren't tied to
[1:17:48] Christ my job as a minister is to get
[1:17:51] you so tied to Jesus Christ amen that
[1:17:54] you will no matter what happens to me
[1:17:55] you'll be tied to Jesus Christ I don't
[1:17:58] have a church age book around here but
[1:18:00] there's a last paragraph in the church
[1:18:02] age book brother M said I have no desire
[1:18:04] to start a church or a fellowship or an
[1:18:06] organization he said I have one desire
[1:18:08] and he said that is to see a
[1:18:10] relationship between God and man I
[1:18:12] believe he had a pure desire amen he had
[1:18:15] a pure desire that you would have a
[1:18:16] relationship with God you get down on
[1:18:18] your knees and say Lord I love you Lord
[1:18:21] forgive me of my sins Lord God would
[1:18:23] send back the witness of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:24] that you'd feel the power of God can you
[1:18:27] say Amen you feel the witness the same
[1:18:29] as Simpson felt a witness oh he made
[1:18:31] mistakes and he was grinding at the Mill
[1:18:33] but there's one thing the devil forgot
[1:18:35] his hair began to grow back
[1:18:37] amen he began to be restored back to
[1:18:40] almighty God and his hair grew back and
[1:18:42] when he grew back he said you lead me to
[1:18:44] the pillars lead me to the Strong place
[1:18:46] what was he saying Lord lead me back to
[1:18:49] the place of what I'm supposed to do I'm
[1:18:51] supposed to destroy these Philistines
[1:18:53] amen and what did he do he started
[1:18:55] praying he's put his hands on the
[1:18:57] pillars they said Lord remember me
[1:19:00] Lord remember me is that your desire
[1:19:02] tonight like Samson he might have made
[1:19:04] mistakes we all made mistakes we can get
[1:19:06] back like Samson Lord get me in the
[1:19:08] presence of God get me to where I'm
[1:19:09] supposed to be and say Lord Remember Me
[1:19:12] Lord strengthen me Lord avenge me of my
[1:19:16] enemies and he pushed the pillars down
[1:19:19] and it fell in his in his death he
[1:19:21] killed more than he did in his whole
[1:19:22] life oh may God strengthen us tonight
[1:19:24] may he avenge us amen of our enemies no
[1:19:27] matter how old we are to what we're
[1:19:29] going through say Lord avenge me let me
[1:19:31] rise and bear fruit you say brother
[1:19:33] Daniel I've been stinted in my growth
[1:19:35] and things have deformed me I'm going to
[1:19:37] preach God's power of transformation
[1:19:38] right here is that okay brother random
[1:19:40] said as long as that seed stays in the
[1:19:43] channel it'll grow and mature but some
[1:19:45] things lean against it and it gets
[1:19:46] deformed and it grows out of the way but
[1:19:48] there's something about it when you cut
[1:19:49] away that thing that's deformed it will
[1:19:52] always grow back to the sun it will
[1:19:55] always point back toward the Sun
[1:19:58] I've got this little devious thing about
[1:20:01] my nature my wife has these plants and
[1:20:03] they all grow towards the window toward
[1:20:05] the Sun and I do this little thing I
[1:20:07] take it and I turn it all the way around
[1:20:09] and it's this way then you come back in
[1:20:11] the room a few days later and it's
[1:20:13] completely turned back towards the sun
[1:20:15] you can take a knock down a Son of God
[1:20:18] you can let something deform them or or
[1:20:21] kind of push them a different way can
[1:20:22] you say Amen to that I guess we're all
[1:20:24] living in a day where we've encountered
[1:20:25] technology in our life and I wish it was
[1:20:27] all good but the Bible says it's a tree
[1:20:29] of Good and Evil and so sometimes those
[1:20:31] things deform us and turn us away from
[1:20:33] the Sun
[1:20:36] and we find ourselves but there's
[1:20:37] something about a son and daughter of
[1:20:39] God when they find themselves turned
[1:20:40] away from the Sun amen there's something
[1:20:42] in them that causes them to look back
[1:20:44] towards the Sun and then grow towards
[1:20:46] the Son of God oh blessed be the name of
[1:20:49] the Lord I want to grow towards the Son
[1:20:51] of God tonight if there's something
[1:20:53] that's pulling you away say Lord speak
[1:20:55] to me Lord I've got turned aside I got
[1:20:57] turned away but Lord turn me back that I
[1:21:00] can grow towards the Son of God oh
[1:21:03] blessed be the name of the Lord my son
[1:21:05] used to sing a song it's called you
[1:21:07] probably heard it called Take Me To The
[1:21:09] Cross
[1:21:10] take me into the cross it's a little
[1:21:12] story about a man that had a little
[1:21:13] child and he said look this is a little
[1:21:15] Country Town
[1:21:17] and he said but down in this Valley you
[1:21:19] all got these valleys over in in West
[1:21:22] Virginia and West Virginia and Rural
[1:21:23] down in the valley he said Son now when
[1:21:25] you get down here if you ever get lost
[1:21:27] he said the highest thing in this city
[1:21:29] is this cross and it's on top of this
[1:21:32] church if you ever get lost you tell
[1:21:35] whoever's there say take me to the cross
[1:21:38] then the song goes on to say how many
[1:21:40] times we've got lost in our life maybe
[1:21:42] feel like a snowball that's rolling down
[1:21:44] the hill and then you just stop
[1:21:46] somewhere and the song says no matter
[1:21:48] where you find yourself just say take me
[1:21:51] to the cross
[1:21:52] take me to the cross of Jesus Christ
[1:21:54] where if I confess my sins he's faithful
[1:21:57] and just to forgive me of my sins and
[1:21:59] cleanse me from all righteousness say
[1:22:01] brother Daniel you're living in a
[1:22:02] snowball and all of a sudden it doesn't
[1:22:03] matter just take me to the Cross take me
[1:22:06] to the presence of God take me to the
[1:22:08] witness of the Holy Spirit when I can
[1:22:10] cry in his presence and cry oh Abba
[1:22:12] Father Lord I didn't ask to come into
[1:22:14] this thing you came and came looking for
[1:22:16] me amen he said how the the son of man
[1:22:19] came to seek and to save that which was
[1:22:21] lost am I quoting scripture tonight
[1:22:23] seeking to save that which was lost
[1:22:25] these people they have the idea that
[1:22:27] Jesus died on the cross he ascended up
[1:22:29] told a bunch of disciples tried to go
[1:22:31] tell this sob story and then God comes
[1:22:32] down at the end and okay all the people
[1:22:34] that believe the story about me get
[1:22:36] nails in my hand you're my kids come on
[1:22:37] that's that's a nice denominational idea
[1:22:39] but that's not Bible
[1:22:41] the Bible says the son of man came to
[1:22:43] seek and to save that which was lost
[1:22:45] there's a group of names that are
[1:22:47] written on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:22:48] Hebrews chapter 13 8 that's what I was
[1:22:50] getting too early Hebrews 13 8 the way
[1:22:52] you remember that is Revelations 13 8
[1:22:55] all will be deceived whose names are not
[1:22:57] written on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:22:58] mentions it again in Revelations chapter
[1:23:00] 17 verse 8 the same as Jesus Christ is
[1:23:03] the same yesterday and forever it's
[1:23:06] Revelations 13 8 there was a group of
[1:23:08] names before the foundational world that
[1:23:10] were written down and he said the son of
[1:23:12] man came and said oh I need Sean Martin
[1:23:14] I think I'll go find Sean and any Daniel
[1:23:17] Daniel Andes what's your name
[1:23:19] Levi that's a really good name Levi and
[1:23:22] I believe Levi's name is on the Lamb's
[1:23:23] Book of Life and so the son of man is
[1:23:25] coming and seeking to save him and
[1:23:27] dealing with Levi's heart and touching
[1:23:28] his heart and touching and he's
[1:23:30] beginning to manifest some kind of fruit
[1:23:32] he's not in a bar somewhere tonight and
[1:23:34] playing like oh look at that little guy
[1:23:36] playing the drums on no he's manifesting
[1:23:38] a Godly fruit how old are you Levi eight
[1:23:41] years old in a few years he'll be 12
[1:23:42] years old like Jesus was and they turned
[1:23:44] him loose that's an amazing thing to see
[1:23:46] what kind of life since I just turned
[1:23:48] something loose
[1:23:49] does it meow like a cat or does it raise
[1:23:51] its tail and spray you like a skunk
[1:23:54] and whatever it manifests buy their
[1:23:56] fruits we'll know what they are so they
[1:23:58] turn Jesus loose I think it was three
[1:24:00] days they turned his 12 year old kid
[1:24:01] loose where'd they find him back in the
[1:24:03] synagogue back in the church said I must
[1:24:05] be about my father's business
[1:24:08] at 12 years old he's about his father's
[1:24:10] business amen blessed be the name of the
[1:24:13] Lord I want to go back because this just
[1:24:15] comes to mind
[1:24:17] I was studying those thoughts about the
[1:24:19] the different Ministries and so this man
[1:24:22] I forget where we were and
[1:24:24] and I saw this man he was ministering he
[1:24:27] was talking about the trinity
[1:24:30] and I had given this illustration before
[1:24:31] and this and this man got up and he
[1:24:33] spoken and he said it and he said
[1:24:35] basically the father comes to the son
[1:24:36] and said son we got a sin problem down
[1:24:38] there on Earth I need you to go down and
[1:24:40] there's only one person that can take
[1:24:42] care of that and that's you and
[1:24:43] sometimes we don't realize that maybe
[1:24:45] we're raised hero is with the Lord your
[1:24:46] God is one God scriptures and Timothy
[1:24:49] there great is the mystery of Godless
[1:24:51] God was manifested in the flesh right
[1:24:54] was it Saint John 1 1
[1:24:56] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:24:58] was with God and the Word was God Saint
[1:25:00] John 1 14 and the word became flesh and
[1:25:02] dwelt Among Us that's what we believe
[1:25:04] from the Bible but go on the other side
[1:25:06] and realize how complex it is if you're
[1:25:09] a trinitarian even to pray a prayer
[1:25:10] because if you believe there's three
[1:25:12] equal part Persons Of God you can't
[1:25:14] acknowledge the sun without the great
[1:25:16] father or the father without
[1:25:18] acknowledging you got to remember this
[1:25:20] when you're praying and father we and
[1:25:22] then you're like the son the Holy Spirit
[1:25:23] and so when you think about this idea of
[1:25:26] this old man that come up with this idea
[1:25:29] of the earth and a perfect Earth and
[1:25:31] children on it and just right off the
[1:25:32] bat the thing went astray and it all
[1:25:35] fell and it got all messed up and he
[1:25:37] looked over and said son I made a mess
[1:25:39] down there um will you go down and and
[1:25:42] and and and die for those people I made
[1:25:44] a mess but you go down and die and let
[1:25:46] and clean that up and I know it's going
[1:25:48] to be difficult but I'll send this
[1:25:50] little Dove he'll flop around you this
[1:25:52] little Holy Spirit he'll help you on
[1:25:53] encouragement doesn't that just sound
[1:25:56] no no no but great is a mystery of God's
[1:25:59] God the great Eternal God had a plan in
[1:26:02] his mind amen he had an attribute to be
[1:26:04] a redeemer and when something fell he
[1:26:07] had a desire to redeem it back so God
[1:26:09] the word became flesh and dwelt God
[1:26:12] became flesh and dwelt Among Us and died
[1:26:15] on the cross for your sins and my sins
[1:26:17] that he could express this attribute to
[1:26:19] be a redeemer these attributes to be a
[1:26:21] Healer but there was nothing there was
[1:26:23] nothing sick they had an attribute to be
[1:26:26] a father but there was no children so
[1:26:28] God Amen developed this great plan so I
[1:26:30] say this tonight if you're sick in your
[1:26:32] body let God Express his attribute as
[1:26:34] being a Healer don't suffer on with your
[1:26:37] your pain and oh God this no he he was
[1:26:39] wounded for our transgression bruised
[1:26:41] for our iniquity and by his stripes you
[1:26:43] can be healed the Bible says they shall
[1:26:46] lay hands on the sick and God will have
[1:26:48] an opportunity to express his great
[1:26:50] attribute of healer and restore your
[1:26:53] health back
[1:26:55] maybe you've fallen into sin and you've
[1:26:57] done something is wrong don't
[1:26:58] commiserate in your sin let God Express
[1:27:00] his great attribute of Redeemer and
[1:27:03] redeem you back to fellowship with God
[1:27:05] can you say Amen to that once I see it
[1:27:07] from the scripture say Lord I'm not
[1:27:09] going to sit here in condemnation Lord
[1:27:11] I'm going to let you redeem me back to
[1:27:13] fellowship with almighty God and we've
[1:27:15] all been there right amen we were all
[1:27:17] born in sin shaped in iniquity and God
[1:27:19] reached down his hand I didn't go
[1:27:20] looking for God he came looking for me I
[1:27:24] believe that's what Peter meant when he
[1:27:25] said work out your own salvation realize
[1:27:27] I just didn't get you know wrapped up or
[1:27:29] married into this great movement called
[1:27:30] the message but God came looking for me
[1:27:33] and He restored me back and then he
[1:27:35] placed the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:36] inside of me give me a power to be a
[1:27:39] witness and give me a power to bear
[1:27:41] fruit for God because it takes the Holy
[1:27:43] Spirit
[1:27:44] you can't live good enough you can't you
[1:27:46] know we say well if we could handcuff
[1:27:48] ourselves to brother Sean Martin if I
[1:27:50] could just handcuff myself I would never
[1:27:52] do wrong and some of us would like to do
[1:27:54] it just I'll Never back talk my husband
[1:27:56] as long as brother Sean's in the room
[1:28:00] but you gotta remember Peter was
[1:28:02] handcuffed to Jesus for three and a half
[1:28:03] years Peter walked on water Peter had
[1:28:06] five thousand Peter was right there and
[1:28:09] he still I don't even know the man I I
[1:28:11] don't even know him and the Bible says
[1:28:12] he cussed he cursed and said he said oh
[1:28:15] you gotta he's a cussing preacher so
[1:28:17] it's not being with Jesus this is a this
[1:28:20] is an amazing thing that
[1:28:22] just a few days before this Jesus gives
[1:28:24] him the keys to the kingdom
[1:28:26] so Peter whatever you buying on Earth
[1:28:28] I'll bind it in heaven whatever you're
[1:28:29] buying on Earth and then Jesus knowing a
[1:28:32] couple days later he's going to deny
[1:28:34] he even knows him
[1:28:37] and then you just think about that in in
[1:28:39] just businesses maybe a brother works
[1:28:41] and he gets a little business and he
[1:28:43] said look I'm going to give you
[1:28:44] everything that bank account and the the
[1:28:47] keys to the success and here it is and
[1:28:49] then a couple days later this man is
[1:28:50] going to deny that he even knows you or
[1:28:52] anything about you think you wouldn't
[1:28:53] even do that in your natural mind would
[1:28:55] you I wouldn't do it but Jesus had such
[1:28:58] confidence in the Holy Spirit he said
[1:29:01] I'm going to go away and there's going
[1:29:02] to be something that comes inside of you
[1:29:04] Peter and this power it's actually my
[1:29:07] own life is going to leave live inside
[1:29:09] of you I mean he said I must go away or
[1:29:11] this comforter can't come because I will
[1:29:13] be with you even in you now the body of
[1:29:15] Jesus Christ didn't come inside of Peter
[1:29:17] it was the spirit of almighty God not
[1:29:21] the third person of the Trinity it was
[1:29:23] God himself that lived inside of him
[1:29:25] I'll tell you if you ever want
[1:29:26] inspiration the Holy Ghost just go to
[1:29:27] witness to somebody and say the very
[1:29:29] same God that created the heavens and
[1:29:31] earth he all things were created and by
[1:29:33] him and for him and by him everything
[1:29:35] exists and that God lives inside lie to
[1:29:38] me and watch the Holy Spirit just stands
[1:29:39] well up inside of you amen because it's
[1:29:42] not you it's him it's all about him
[1:29:45] it's all about Jesus Christ it's not
[1:29:48] about the bride it's about the
[1:29:49] bridegroom amen he chose us I'm just
[1:29:52] glad to be a part of it I'm glad that he
[1:29:55] came and he found me one day brother
[1:29:57] Sean that day on Calvary said it doesn't
[1:29:59] make a stuffed shirt it makes you just
[1:30:01] real humble to say he chose me
[1:30:03] blessed are your eyes that they see you
[1:30:06] realize I got family that's better than
[1:30:08] I am they're not Believers in the world
[1:30:10] and and and and and people and they're
[1:30:12] better people than I am these citizens
[1:30:14] and my just better but God chose you he
[1:30:18] chose me I said oh thank you Lord now
[1:30:21] Lord let me bear the right kind of fruit
[1:30:23] Lord Lord let me bear the right kind of
[1:30:26] fruit don't let me I always be reading
[1:30:28] something the other day brother Brown
[1:30:29] said we should try to reflect Christ in
[1:30:31] everything that we do
[1:30:33] and if you don't do it just because you
[1:30:35] just remember when you got baptized and
[1:30:37] they put you down in the water and they
[1:30:38] brought you up you came up as a
[1:30:40] Christian they called them Christians
[1:30:42] because they were like Christ and they
[1:30:44] were from Antioch isn't that the book of
[1:30:45] Acts and they were Christians remember
[1:30:47] people are watching your life
[1:30:49] don't bring a reproach on Jesus Christ
[1:30:52] don't bring a reproach on Jesus Christ
[1:30:55] blessed be the name of the Lord so many
[1:30:58] things are trying to get back you all
[1:31:00] are pulling me in so many different
[1:31:01] directions
[1:31:02] Ephesians chapter one well uh

[1:31:29] like you're in Heavenly places amen
[1:31:31] that's where that's what going to church
[1:31:32] is about that's why people walk away
[1:31:33] they never get in Heavenly places they
[1:31:35] just sit in a critical like oh they sing

[1:31:43] yeah people are solar interior
[1:31:45] decorators you see this shouldn't be
[1:31:47] setting here this should be sitting like
[1:31:48] this to be symmetrical with the one
[1:31:50] that's sitting over there and that's all
[1:31:51] they get out of the service you get the
[1:31:53] musicians like oh this is like and I was
[1:31:55] a deacon for many years I go out like it
[1:31:57] was hot in there I said I'm glad you got
[1:31:58] something out of the service
[1:32:01] brother Shawna I believe and I've quoted
[1:32:03] this many wasn't it your wedding where
[1:32:04] somebody fainted wasn't it something
[1:32:07] was it Daniel it was Daniel I tell this
[1:32:09] example I might as well bring it home
[1:32:11] here we are I tell them you can preach a
[1:32:13] perfect sermon with perfect verses and
[1:32:15] and quotes and illustrations and people
[1:32:18] don't even remember their serving but
[1:32:20] you can make one mistake and say yeah
[1:32:21] you came out and you tripped over your
[1:32:23] thing and that's all they remember you
[1:32:25] can have a perfect wedding and just have
[1:32:27] the music and the violins and the
[1:32:29] dresses and all that and nobody ever
[1:32:30] remembers it and you can have Daniel
[1:32:32] faint at a wedding many years ago in
[1:32:33] Prescott and everybody remembers when
[1:32:35] Daniel fainted
[1:32:36] everybody written what a wedding like he
[1:32:38] fainted up there he just smacked that
[1:32:40] right on his face and I was like man the
[1:32:42] way to get people to remember your
[1:32:44] wedding is you do two or three stage
[1:32:45] things that look like accidents and then
[1:32:47] everybody remembers your wedding right
[1:32:49] but it's the way people get they get if
[1:32:52] you know they go to church and so you
[1:32:53] know and you so you gotta I like to
[1:32:55] misquote a scripture here and there in
[1:32:56] my preaching Souls you misquoted it I'm
[1:32:58] glad you got something out of the
[1:32:59] service
[1:33:00] because I preached the perfect sermon
[1:33:02] you wouldn't got anything the critics
[1:33:03] wouldn't have got anything they're going
[1:33:04] like man I didn't get anything out of
[1:33:06] that that was perfect
[1:33:08] so we want everybody to get something
[1:33:10] out of the service
[1:33:12] even the critics amen we're not perfect
[1:33:14] the last perfect man we hung on the
[1:33:17] cross
[1:33:18] hung him on the cross and amen called
[1:33:20] him a devil amen we're humans ministers
[1:33:24] were humans
[1:33:27] and deacons and I've been a Sunday
[1:33:29] school teacher my wife's assistant we're
[1:33:31] humans brother Ram said this he said if
[1:33:33] you get somebody lifted up too high God
[1:33:35] will allow that person to make a mistake
[1:33:37] so that your eyes stop looking to them
[1:33:39] for your salvation and you look over on
[1:33:41] Jesus Christ
[1:33:43] amen my job and brother Sean we're
[1:33:45] pointing you to Jesus Christ say I want
[1:33:47] to be a signpost sometimes my signing
[1:33:49] might get a little it might get uh you
[1:33:51] know dingy we live in a life you drive
[1:33:53] down the road and mud gets splashed up
[1:33:55] on the signpost but I'm trying to clean
[1:33:57] my son off so I'll be a better signpost
[1:33:59] for Jesus Christ amen so we make
[1:34:02] mistakes I make mistakes I'm human don't
[1:34:04] make a list I already got the list made
[1:34:06] I'll give you the list save you the time
[1:34:08] they have all kinds of problems we
[1:34:10] battle the devil just like you the Devil
[1:34:12] comes like look you got this in your
[1:34:13] life you're never gonna does he come to
[1:34:15] you that way he comes to me all like
[1:34:16] you're never gonna make it then you
[1:34:17] start saying it's because of this and
[1:34:19] because of this and this is hereditary
[1:34:20] you never and I am so thankful that they
[1:34:22] don't have all those tests ADHD and and
[1:34:25] I don't know I can't even remember I am
[1:34:26] so glad they didn't have him when I was
[1:34:28] young
[1:34:29] because I am I I probably got at least
[1:34:32] three maybe four of them I know I do and
[1:34:34] they just and that's what people do they
[1:34:36] get those little things a little and
[1:34:37] they start petting that devil and
[1:34:38] petting that devil and petting everyone
[1:34:40] I say Lord I don't care what handicap I
[1:34:42] have I'm gonna be a Christian Lord Jesus
[1:34:44] I don't care what thing the devil has
[1:34:46] tried to have struck my life I'm gonna
[1:34:47] be the best Christian that I have amen
[1:34:50] my eyes may be dim but I'm gonna get up
[1:34:52] every morning and put my contacts in my
[1:34:54] crutches in and I'm going to preach the
[1:34:56] best sermon that I can preach can you
[1:34:58] say Amen to that I might have some
[1:35:00] handicap in my life but I'm gonna be the
[1:35:02] best Christian that I can even with my
[1:35:04] handicaps because that's all God
[1:35:07] requires of us is that we do our best
[1:35:09] for Jesus Christ sometimes as a minister
[1:35:12] brother Sean I look at the mirror and
[1:35:13] say God I'm doing the best that I know
[1:35:16] how to do and if there was something I
[1:35:18] could do better you know how we'd be
[1:35:19] doing it and aren't you glad God looks
[1:35:21] at your heart
[1:35:23] Sam remember they brought all the sons
[1:35:25] of Jesse I'm just preaching tonight we
[1:35:27] haven't got to anything and all they
[1:35:29] bring all the sons to Jesse and even the
[1:35:31] prophet said surely this is the one
[1:35:33] surely this is the one and God pulls the
[1:35:35] prophet aside and says look I want to
[1:35:36] teach you something Samuel I wanted even
[1:35:38] a prophet a man of God he has all this
[1:35:40] Vindication says Samuel come over here I
[1:35:43] don't look on the outside I look at the
[1:35:45] heart
[1:35:46] oh really Sam oh is that okay God yeah I
[1:35:49] get it okay and it goes back hey it's
[1:35:51] not it may not be you and it comes all
[1:35:53] the way down and he was so sure he said
[1:35:55] wait we went through all your don't you
[1:35:57] have another one
[1:35:58] he said I got another one but he's a
[1:36:00] little Ruddy he said we're not sitting
[1:36:01] down do you go get Mr ready the little
[1:36:04] guy that's everybody thinks he's nothing
[1:36:05] but a sheep herder and they brought him
[1:36:07] up and they and there David comes in
[1:36:09] like hey what's going on he's and Jesse
[1:36:11] says I don't know David everything's
[1:36:13] gonna just kneel down so he kneels down
[1:36:14] and all of a sudden Samuel takes the oil
[1:36:16] and starts pouring his on his head and
[1:36:18] oil is running down over his face he
[1:36:20] said Daddy what what does this mean ever
[1:36:22] been in the presence of God and the
[1:36:24] anointing of a god you say what does
[1:36:25] that mean I don't know what it means but
[1:36:27] just stay there the anointing of God is
[1:36:29] falling something's happen in your life
[1:36:31] amen greater is he that is inside of you
[1:36:33] than he that is in the world and David's
[1:36:35] there and he says what was all that all
[1:36:37] about he said God has chosen you to be
[1:36:39] the king
[1:36:40] so he gets up and he says what do I do
[1:36:42] go be king no go back and take care of
[1:36:44] sheep
[1:36:47] brother randoms on the river 1933. Angel
[1:36:50] the Lord comes down and said is John the
[1:36:52] Baptist 4run my first coming you will go
[1:36:54] and forerun my second coming did he run
[1:36:56] around the world and no he went back to
[1:36:58] his church
[1:36:59] until 1946 13 years later David back out
[1:37:03] there and God is teaching him amen he
[1:37:06] kills a bear and then then a lion comes
[1:37:09] out he gets the lion and
[1:37:12] but somehow that anointing that thing
[1:37:14] when he had this experience with God are
[1:37:16] you with me today he had had an
[1:37:18] experience of God he was in the presence
[1:37:19] he was anointed by God's prophet and the
[1:37:22] anointing he was there when it happened
[1:37:24] he ought to know and something came over
[1:37:26] him and the word of God came to him
[1:37:27] you're going to be the King David you
[1:37:30] can't die because you're going to be the
[1:37:31] king so when this bear comes out to try
[1:37:33] to destroy him it can't destroy me
[1:37:35] because I'm going to be the King by a
[1:37:37] prophecy amen the Bible has shown us
[1:37:39] there is a bride that's without spot or
[1:37:42] wrinkle amen God has chosen you to bear
[1:37:44] fruit you have not chosen God God chose
[1:37:47] you and revealed this message to you
[1:37:49] Ellie's your message go get me a bride
[1:37:51] and somewhere you heard about the
[1:37:53] message and it's drawing you back
[1:37:56] and then remember David he was just a
[1:37:58] little bitty guy he's going he was just
[1:38:00] like a
[1:38:01] um a GrubHub driver
[1:38:04] he was taking meat and cheese to his
[1:38:06] brothers right they were fighting the
[1:38:07] battle he was just Uber he was like hey
[1:38:09] here's your meat and cheese all of a
[1:38:10] sudden this big man come out about 10
[1:38:12] foot tall and he's gone who will come
[1:38:14] and fight me there's no reason we all
[1:38:16] die or you die who will come and fight
[1:38:18] me and the Bible makes this amazing
[1:38:20] thing it says and David heard it
[1:38:23] and David heard it and something came
[1:38:26] back and David that experience that he
[1:38:28] had with God Amen that experience that
[1:38:31] he had of God you're going to be the
[1:38:33] king why isn't Saul fighting because God
[1:38:35] has chosen you David David said I'll go
[1:38:38] fight him and he said look you need this
[1:38:40] and you need this and you need a degree
[1:38:41] and you need to go learn this and you
[1:38:43] need to learn all these quotes in the
[1:38:44] message and you need to get a computer
[1:38:45] and you may be able to search them all
[1:38:47] this what about just preaching the
[1:38:49] gospel
[1:38:50] what about doing I mean Peter couldn't
[1:38:52] run an iPad he couldn't sign his own
[1:38:55] name he didn't know how to log in and
[1:38:56] put that stuff in her he was ignorant
[1:38:58] and unlearned amen what about just going
[1:39:00] and taking what you got your little
[1:39:02] sling your faith in Jesus Christ amen
[1:39:05] and David heard it and David starts
[1:39:07] going he said you come to me with the
[1:39:09] sword and spirit but I come to you in
[1:39:11] the name of the Lord and David picks up
[1:39:14] five smooth Stones I like what the
[1:39:16] brother said at Camp he didn't pick up
[1:39:18] four extra ones because he thought he
[1:39:19] might miss David he picked up four extra
[1:39:22] ones because he thought Goliath had four
[1:39:24] brothers he was going to kill them too
[1:39:26] amen God we are more than conquerors
[1:39:30] through Jesus Christ we are not defeated
[1:39:32] we're Sons and Daughters of almighty God
[1:39:34] not because we said we were because God
[1:39:36] chose us amen and ordain just that you
[1:39:39] would see water baptism in Jesus name
[1:39:41] and you'd come back and say I'm not
[1:39:43] ashamed to be identified with Christ
[1:39:45] I'll lay down my old maiden name I'm
[1:39:47] gonna preach invisible Union right here
[1:39:49] amen that old nature that had us bound
[1:39:51] that old law amen that old husband amen
[1:39:54] is dead our old nature and we rise and
[1:39:56] newness with Jesus Christ and be married
[1:39:58] to Christ the word not man's ideas and
[1:40:01] traditions not brother Daniel's ideas
[1:40:02] not brother Sean's amen but Christ the
[1:40:05] word of God and brother Daniel showed me
[1:40:07] from the scripture that I had to be
[1:40:09] baptized in Jesus name brother Daniel
[1:40:10] showed me from the scripture serpency
[1:40:12] brother did you show me from the
[1:40:14] scripture predestination
[1:40:16] oh Hallelujah bone of his bone and flesh
[1:40:20] of his flesh here a little there little
[1:40:22] God is changing us from glory to glory
[1:40:25] he's changing us let the mind that was
[1:40:27] in Christ let it be inside of you
[1:40:30] too many people in our generation
[1:40:32] they're
[1:40:33] they say things we don't realize with
[1:40:35] our words we we create atmospheres
[1:40:39] the Bible says by your words you're
[1:40:41] Justified
[1:40:42] and by your words you're condemned
[1:40:44] you're a creator
[1:40:46] in the beginning
[1:40:49] God created heavens of the earth it was
[1:40:51] that without Earth without form and it
[1:40:53] was void and the Bible says the spirit
[1:40:55] of the Lord began to move over it just
[1:40:57] like people they get in a meeting and
[1:40:59] the spirit of God moves over it but it
[1:41:00] takes more than the spirit of God moving
[1:41:02] over because the spirit of the Lord
[1:41:03] moved over the Earth but nothing
[1:41:05] happened until God said something which
[1:41:07] was let there be light and then there
[1:41:09] was light so when God begins to speak to
[1:41:12] you there's power in the word if you're
[1:41:15] a son and daughter of God you have power
[1:41:16] in the words that you say so you should
[1:41:19] never say I'm a weak Christian
[1:41:22] I'll never make it I'll never amount
[1:41:25] anything
[1:41:26] I'm losing my mind
[1:41:28] no no we are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:41:33] and can you imagine here the father he's
[1:41:35] he's building remember what is it Saint
[1:41:37] John 14 I go and prepare a place for you
[1:41:39] if I go and prepare a place I will come
[1:41:41] and yeah anybody anybody ever build a
[1:41:43] house here it takes a long time doesn't
[1:41:45] it it takes longer and so it's been a
[1:41:47] little while more than what we thought
[1:41:48] it would be around this message but it's
[1:41:50] going to be really nice when he gets
[1:41:51] done with it right but he's over there
[1:41:53] working all of a sudden he hears
[1:41:55] something like Father father what is it
[1:41:57] oh yeah I'll just keep this up I'm gonna
[1:41:59] go my son so son of her I'll never make
[1:42:02] it like hey that's not the way we talk
[1:42:04] we're Sons and Daughters of God all my
[1:42:07] children make it
[1:42:09] All My Children make it there's no such
[1:42:12] thing as a wedding supper and like oh
[1:42:13] yeah they didn't make it tonight they
[1:42:16] didn't make it my grace wasn't
[1:42:18] sufficient for them no no his grace is
[1:42:21] sufficient for all of us there's no plan
[1:42:24] B With God all that the father hath
[1:42:25] given me will come to me they will come
[1:42:28] to me now we make a decision like so
[1:42:30] like well you know Samuel was uh young
[1:42:33] six eight ten years he's in the temple
[1:42:35] of God he hears the voice of God he
[1:42:36] doesn't even know what it is he goes to
[1:42:38] some backslidden preacher and the
[1:42:39] preacher's like I just just go back to
[1:42:41] bed and after a while the backslidden
[1:42:42] preacher said you know that's probably
[1:42:43] God speaking that boy you just say
[1:42:45] here's your here's your servant uh Lord
[1:42:47] what would you have me and so God be
[1:42:49] Samuel is learning the voice of God to
[1:42:52] him so he could do it at a young age or
[1:42:54] like Samson you could go your whole head
[1:42:55] pig headed and just butt against the
[1:42:57] things of God but God's going to get you
[1:43:00] we can do this the easy way or the hard
[1:43:02] way we're better off as a Young Man Levi
[1:43:05] right amen is eight years old to be
[1:43:07] drumming for the Lord amen rather than
[1:43:09] out in the world this backslidden man
[1:43:11] told these people one time said look you
[1:43:13] need to go to the world and learn to
[1:43:14] play rock and roll and then come to the
[1:43:16] church and and play it in the church
[1:43:17] somebody around this message we don't
[1:43:20] need the world we just need Jesus Christ
[1:43:22] amen the Bible says Praise Him upon the
[1:43:25] symbols the loud sounding symbols when
[1:43:27] God will give you Rhythm amen God will
[1:43:29] give you Rhythm we don't need the
[1:43:30] world's Rhythm we need God's rhythm in
[1:43:32] our life we need God's spirit in our
[1:43:34] life oh praise be to God and so David he
[1:43:37] goes down there and he hears the
[1:43:38] anointing and he runs to Goliath hey man
[1:43:40] he slings this I could he believe he
[1:43:42] could have slung it that way and the
[1:43:43] Holy Spirit would have got him brought
[1:43:45] it right to his head Amen to hit Goliath
[1:43:47] and he fell down and he cut his head off
[1:43:48] amen because greater is he that is in
[1:43:50] you than he that is in the world
[1:43:52] praise the Lord where's your clock at
[1:43:54] brother son you know don't knock clocks
[1:43:57] oh my goodness may the Lord help us he's
[1:44:00] chosen us amen before the foundation of
[1:44:03] the world
[1:44:05] amen we need the mind of Christ
[1:44:07] got so many things here
[1:44:10] this might be a little too does the
[1:44:12] devil get out this far does he get up
[1:44:14] here in the mountains he does okay his
[1:44:17] sister said well sometimes they get out
[1:44:18] there like the devil may get out here I
[1:44:20] was up in Canada it was 30 below zero I
[1:44:22] said I know the devil doesn't make it up
[1:44:24] this call he just goes down he's a
[1:44:25] snowbird he runs like
[1:44:28] we were talking about this the other day
[1:44:30] in our in one of the libraries they
[1:44:32] brought a they're teaching these kids
[1:44:34] the alphabet and they talk about this
[1:44:36] lgbtq question mark excellent people
[1:44:39] don't even know what gender they are my
[1:44:41] I think it was my daughter-in-law sent
[1:44:43] me a picture of one of these books and
[1:44:45] it had B and I said B is for bye you can
[1:44:48] shout out loud I like more than one
[1:44:50] gender and gender and it makes me proud
[1:44:53] that's what the public schools and the
[1:44:54] libraries are teaching these kids that
[1:44:57] they can be two different Sexes the
[1:44:59] Bible says in Genesis that God made them
[1:45:01] male and female there was only two
[1:45:03] genders so let the world get confused
[1:45:05] God is not the author of confusion amen
[1:45:09] God has not given us the spirit of fear
[1:45:12] but of power and a love and of a sound
[1:45:15] mind Amen Let don't let your mind waffle
[1:45:18] don't let your mind go into
[1:45:19] experimentation stay right with the word
[1:45:21] of God you'll save yourself a lot of
[1:45:22] trouble these people that go out into
[1:45:24] that the the suicide rate between people
[1:45:26] that go trans and then try to get back
[1:45:28] to suicide rate is twice what the normal
[1:45:30] suicide rate is
[1:45:32] I was reading an article is this okay
[1:45:34] you can get up and straighten me out if
[1:45:36] you had a person that went and they they
[1:45:38] used them as their um poster child and
[1:45:41] got the the agendas pushed out it's like
[1:45:43] Satan the devil will pull you out there
[1:45:45] and make you and use you even Judas came
[1:45:47] back and said hey here's the money back
[1:45:48] said hey we didn't want your money we
[1:45:50] wanted something to push this agenda
[1:45:51] through we got what we want even the man
[1:45:53] that went to the military was a
[1:45:55] homosexual he went into the military and
[1:45:57] then he came back and said no you all
[1:45:58] have ruined my life he said no so too
[1:46:00] late we already got the agenda pass that
[1:46:01] we wanted to you see that Judas spirit
[1:46:05] amen may God help us to keep a sound
[1:46:07] mind in this day
[1:46:09] amen don't let the devil pull you aside
[1:46:11] as the one person said the other day I
[1:46:13] was reading an article they said uh
[1:46:15] child City because they give them those
[1:46:17] hormone blockers where a child doesn't
[1:46:19] develop and then they have to as they
[1:46:21] grow older they had in chronic pain and
[1:46:23] they said this person said look they
[1:46:25] made me a a a medical
[1:46:28] patient for the rest of my life I have
[1:46:30] to take their injections to for the pain
[1:46:33] and all these things they've messed up
[1:46:34] my body and it's actually the the
[1:46:36] mutilation of children who was it the
[1:46:39] other day I seen was it Donald Trump
[1:46:40] they did an interview and he said I
[1:46:42] absolutely will stand up against this
[1:46:44] who would ever thought 10 years ago we
[1:46:46] would had legislation that would
[1:46:48] legislate that we need to stop
[1:46:49] mutilating our teenagers but that's what
[1:46:52] it is allowing them its insanity is what
[1:46:54] it is may God give us a sound mind say
[1:46:57] oh y'all just a bunch of people up in
[1:46:59] the hills no we got a sound mind we got
[1:47:02] the mind of Christ that God made a male
[1:47:04] and he made it a female and we need the
[1:47:06] holy ghost that will Empower us to say
[1:47:08] God made me a man I'm a man
[1:47:10] I'm a man and a sister say I'm a sister
[1:47:13] I don't need the world to come and try
[1:47:14] to influence me and young people say hey
[1:47:17] this is what God made me and how I have
[1:47:19] said it like this the young people this
[1:47:20] is the youngest people's service right
[1:47:21] there's some decisions that are in two
[1:47:23] two important for you to make
[1:47:26] so God makes them for you
[1:47:28] like who your parents are going to be
[1:47:30] or what gender you are God makes those
[1:47:32] decisions for you so you don't have
[1:47:34] that's too important because we I
[1:47:35] remember one time my dad it was great
[1:47:37] wisdom he he told us he said now I've
[1:47:39] done never done this before raised kids
[1:47:41] and he said there's no manual for it I'm
[1:47:44] just doing the best that I can there's
[1:47:45] there's something about humility to say
[1:47:47] you know I'm not perfect and there's
[1:47:48] something about a minister hey I'm not
[1:47:50] perfect I'm doing the best that I can I
[1:47:51] probably make some mistakes along the
[1:47:53] way so my dad said now if there's
[1:47:55] something in that I'm doing that you
[1:47:56] don't understand you come to me because
[1:47:57] I'm trying to figure this out too and I
[1:47:59] said so a little while later I went to
[1:48:00] him and said yeah Dad Dad Dad
[1:48:02] um I want to change my name to mark
[1:48:04] because there was this man that was a
[1:48:06] hero and I looked at him I just the
[1:48:08] power of influence he stood in the back
[1:48:09] of the church and he raised his hand a
[1:48:10] certain way wow I went to my dad said
[1:48:12] hey I want to change my name to Mark
[1:48:14] like that man
[1:48:15] my dad said we're not changing your name
[1:48:17] to Mark I've already chose that and God
[1:48:21] chose a past for all of us we can't
[1:48:23] choose who our parents were sometimes
[1:48:25] people make decisions that affect us
[1:48:27] that there's nothing we can do about it
[1:48:31] think back through your life like I
[1:48:32] maybe it's a separation of marriage like
[1:48:34] I had no choice somebody else made that
[1:48:36] decision and it affects my life and get
[1:48:38] up and walk on with God and amen you
[1:48:40] think about brother banham and all the
[1:48:42] things and you know his father was a you
[1:48:44] know uh he he didn't even just today it
[1:48:47] would be like a drug dealer he wasn't
[1:48:49] just doing drugs he was doing he was
[1:48:51] making the drugs and and he was he sold
[1:48:54] moonshine and brother random uh was was
[1:48:56] carrying the water for this drug the
[1:48:59] drug of his day was moonshine and so he
[1:49:00] was are you with me today and here's the
[1:49:02] problem of God yeah my dad was this and
[1:49:04] I had to drop out of school and they put
[1:49:06] carbolic acid on my head when you
[1:49:07] remember he said he was at church one of
[1:49:09] the brothers from his church he was
[1:49:10] there and they were talking about
[1:49:11] hunting a man breaks back gets a bottle
[1:49:12] and dumpster on the head and pretty soon
[1:49:13] all brother Brown's hair is gone
[1:49:15] and and you think of the complex he
[1:49:17] could just sat down yeah I got all this
[1:49:19] thing I got ADHD and PSD and all these
[1:49:22] things I just can't do no he just stood
[1:49:24] up and said I'm going to be the best
[1:49:26] Christian that I can for the Lord Jesus
[1:49:28] Christ God has given me the power of the
[1:49:30] Holy Spirit I'm gonna be a Christian can
[1:49:32] you say Amen to that I say Amen the
[1:49:34] Bible says they were in the upper room
[1:49:36] and the Holy Spirit fell on all of them
[1:49:37] and they walked out and spoke the word
[1:49:39] of God with boldness
[1:49:41] I know there was other times they spoke
[1:49:43] in tongues and glorified God but there
[1:49:44] is one place in Acts chapter 4 that they
[1:49:46] walked out and the Bible says they spake
[1:49:48] the word of God with boldness maybe this
[1:49:50] being acts for a reinvention brother
[1:49:52] Sean we walk out and say you know what
[1:49:54] I'm a man I'm a woman if you're a woman
[1:49:56] and you know I believe this message is
[1:49:58] the truth let's speak the word of God
[1:50:00] with boldness
[1:50:02] we're coming up to the holidays and
[1:50:04] everybody likes to get around go over to
[1:50:05] other people's house and we hide our
[1:50:07] Christianity like hey no this is a
[1:50:08] Christian home we read the Bible at
[1:50:11] Thanksgiving somebody hand me a Bible
[1:50:13] don't make your wife do it you do it get
[1:50:15] your Bibles look go around in a circle
[1:50:17] and say everybody here we got something
[1:50:19] to be thankful for and let's be thankful
[1:50:21] it doesn't matter if you're a Christian
[1:50:22] the Bible says every good and perfect
[1:50:24] gift comes from above
[1:50:27] good and perfect gift comes from the
[1:50:29] body above he said I'm the Lord that
[1:50:30] heals all of your sicknesses and all of
[1:50:32] your diseases
[1:50:35] I have the quotes right here I can't
[1:50:36] find them very quick on my iPad I'm
[1:50:38] really kind of new at this so I would
[1:50:39] try to find them and I'd get lost
[1:50:40] somewhere in between there so I'm not
[1:50:42] going to go to that but brother Brown
[1:50:43] said God does Miracles through surgeons
[1:50:46] a miracle through a surgeons or through
[1:50:49] medicine but the Bible says I'm the Lord
[1:50:52] that heals all of your sicknesses
[1:50:55] now you might smash your car up and come
[1:50:57] on oh God will you heal my car will you
[1:51:00] hear my God could do it he could do a
[1:51:01] miracle and all that tin can that got
[1:51:03] wrinkled up you ever take a tin can of
[1:51:04] wrinkle and never comes straight again
[1:51:05] right but God could do a miracle and
[1:51:07] make it straight but he probably while
[1:51:09] you're praying say you know what I got a
[1:51:11] man called a body shop and you just keep
[1:51:13] praying don't tell me how to do it just
[1:51:15] say God I need my car fixed and maybe 30
[1:51:17] days from now maybe six weeks from now
[1:51:19] your car will come back and God has
[1:51:21] healed your car
[1:51:23] not the way you thought it should be
[1:51:25] healed but God answered your prayer and
[1:51:28] healed your car Lord I'm sick in my body
[1:51:30] God will you hear my body yes and
[1:51:32] brother bam says 90 of healing is Divine
[1:51:35] Healing which is life inside of you the
[1:51:37] power that works in you overcomes the
[1:51:39] bad sales and you become well ten
[1:51:41] percent of his miracles we know that but
[1:51:43] God is healing us God heals by music
[1:51:46] God heals by a doctor he heals my
[1:51:48] surgeon I really don't care how it comes
[1:51:50] Lord You're the god that heals all of my
[1:51:52] sicknesses and all of my diseases
[1:51:55] now that's a crippleness in our body but
[1:51:57] I can tell you I know more crippled
[1:51:59] people in their Spirit than I do in
[1:52:01] their body
[1:52:03] you know we're a complex person we got
[1:52:05] see taste feel smelling here on the
[1:52:07] outside man then inside of that you've
[1:52:08] got conscience memory affection and
[1:52:10] reason inside of that you got a soul I'm
[1:52:12] preaching greatest battle ever fought
[1:52:13] and and things that are to be or not
[1:52:16] things and knoweth it not those are
[1:52:17] those three sermons you can go back and
[1:52:18] listen to it but so we have people that
[1:52:21] are have their hand or their eyes or
[1:52:22] something and that's one kind of healing
[1:52:24] but there's another healing down inside
[1:52:25] their imagination or their conscience or
[1:52:28] their memory and we become crippled can
[1:52:30] you say Amen to that we become crippled
[1:52:32] how many people you know who want to
[1:52:34] just take the sheets and pull them up
[1:52:35] over their head and say I just want to
[1:52:37] stay in bed when God's called you to be
[1:52:39] a witness for him
[1:52:41] God's called you to be a witness I say
[1:52:43] Lord will you fill us again with the
[1:52:45] Holy Spirit Lord I need to get these
[1:52:47] covers off of me because I got to be a
[1:52:49] witness for you today and be a testimony
[1:52:51] for you today we don't need more
[1:52:53] medicine we need more of the Holy Ghost
[1:52:54] Power inside of us to heal us and say I
[1:52:57] can do all things through Christ who
[1:52:59] strengthens me Lord I can't do it in
[1:53:01] myself but off go the covers Lord I'm
[1:53:03] gonna be a testimony for you today I'm
[1:53:05] going to be a witness for you today
[1:53:10] I know there's a lot of positive mental
[1:53:13] attitudes we're going to go out here and
[1:53:14] kill some devils and that all sounds so
[1:53:16] good and it all you know but my wife and
[1:53:19] I were talking about that this morning I
[1:53:21] said you know the prophet of God tells
[1:53:22] us that Spirits don't die I know it
[1:53:25] sounds good we're gonna go kill some
[1:53:26] devils but you're not gonna kill any
[1:53:27] devils
[1:53:29] all right that's at the Lake of the fire
[1:53:30] remember the 2000 demons that came out
[1:53:32] and said don't destroy us before our
[1:53:34] time and they went into the pigs right
[1:53:35] but you can't kill the devil you might
[1:53:37] cast out a devil but Spirits don't die
[1:53:39] they're alive that there'll come at
[1:53:41] times they'll be cast in the Lake of
[1:53:42] Fire so we're not killing the Devils
[1:53:44] we're just casting them away from us so
[1:53:46] I'm not here to destroy to Kill Devils
[1:53:48] but I am here by the preaching of the
[1:53:50] Gospel that are cast out Devils evil
[1:53:51] spirit
[1:53:52] into our mind and say I am
[1:53:54] conquer through Jesus Christ who loved
[1:53:56] me he called me and ordained me to bear
[1:53:58] fruit and I'm gonna bear fruit I'm going
[1:54:00] to Bear it in my family come
[1:54:01] Thanksgiving I might not even wait till
[1:54:03] Thanksgiving I'm going to get my family
[1:54:05] around us and tell us we're here because
[1:54:06] of Jesus Christ you don't know where our
[1:54:08] family was in denomination and God sent
[1:54:10] a mighty message in this day the message
[1:54:12] by a prophet and we are what we are
[1:54:14] today because God sent a prophet in this
[1:54:16] day and he sent the Holy Spirit to
[1:54:18] Vindicated in our life and look at what
[1:54:20] a wonderful thing God's done with our
[1:54:21] families
[1:54:23] amen we are a miracle
[1:54:26] you are a miracle people are looking for
[1:54:28] a miracle but if you have a sound mind
[1:54:30] today you are a miracle
[1:54:32] if you're married today I say you're a
[1:54:34] miracle
[1:54:35] if you're a man and you know you're a
[1:54:37] man you're a miracle
[1:54:38] if you're a woman and you know you're a
[1:54:40] woman you're a miracle because this
[1:54:42] world is perverted it's all messed up so
[1:54:44] when you see something that's straight
[1:54:45] and something that's right it's a
[1:54:47] miracle
[1:54:48] the Bible says acts with Acts chapter 2
[1:54:50] save yourself
[1:54:52] from this on toward this crooked
[1:54:54] generation what are y'all doing at
[1:54:56] church on Sunday night we're saving
[1:54:57] ourselves we're saving ourselves from
[1:54:59] this Cricket crooked generation Psalms
[1:55:03] chapter one let's go there and then I'll
[1:55:05] close I don't know where time I'm not
[1:55:07] one of those Revelation 10 6 and time
[1:55:10] shall be no more I'm not one of those
[1:55:12] kind of preachers
[1:55:13] [Laughter]
[1:55:14] Psalms chapter one let's let's hit
[1:55:17] Psalms chapter one I haven't got to my
[1:55:19] notes so
[1:55:21] we'll not try to start now Psalms the
[1:55:24] first chapter
[1:55:25] this is David
[1:55:28] the Bible says blessed is the man that
[1:55:30] walketh not in the Council of the
[1:55:32] ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[1:55:33] Sinners nor sitteth in the seed of the
[1:55:35] scoring spool but his Delight is in the
[1:55:38] law of the Lord and in his law that he
[1:55:40] meditate day and night he shall be like
[1:55:42] a tree
[1:55:44] he shall be like a tree planted by the
[1:55:47] rivers of water aren't you so glad for
[1:55:49] people in your life that are consistent
[1:55:52] you may not even like them you may not
[1:55:54] even like their mannerisms but there's
[1:55:56] something about a tree it's just there
[1:55:58] and every time I go to church he's just
[1:56:00] there he just stands there I don't like
[1:56:02] the way he dresses and he Parks his car
[1:56:03] in the wrong place but he's there he
[1:56:06] shall be like a tree planted by the re
[1:56:08] he's not up and down and then moves over
[1:56:10] there and today he believes the message
[1:56:12] of the hour and tomorrow he doesn't
[1:56:13] believe no his roots go down deep where
[1:56:16] does his roots go down into the word of
[1:56:18] God Jesus said I'm going to build a
[1:56:21] church and the Gates of Hell will never
[1:56:22] Prevail against this church so when you
[1:56:25] see people that are blowing about with
[1:56:26] every wind of doctors saying look your
[1:56:28] roots didn't go deep enough into the
[1:56:30] Bible somewhere you might have heard
[1:56:32] about a prophet and all these Miracles
[1:56:33] but they didn't go deep enough into
[1:56:35] Malachi 4 5 Revelation 10 7 Luke 17 3 as
[1:56:38] Amos 3 7 Zachariah in the evening time
[1:56:41] at Shelby are you with me today my job
[1:56:43] is to get you to see what you believe
[1:56:45] comes from the scripture because Jesus
[1:56:47] said I'm building a church and the Gates
[1:56:49] of Hell will never Prevail against this
[1:56:52] church that's built on a rock of
[1:56:54] Revelation I have a rock of Revelation
[1:56:57] amen by the word of God and the Bible
[1:56:59] says this man is going to be like a tree
[1:57:00] you can put a swing set on it little
[1:57:03] swing put a tree house in it man you can
[1:57:06] get the fruit Planet get another tree
[1:57:07] out of it the words his words hey man
[1:57:10] let's go on to read the rest of he shall
[1:57:11] be like a tree planted by the rivers of
[1:57:13] water that bringeth forth his fruit and
[1:57:14] his season his Leaf also shall not
[1:57:16] wither and whatsoever
[1:57:19] whatsoever he'd doeth shall prosper do
[1:57:22] you believe the Bible whatsoever Sons
[1:57:24] and Daughters of God they do it prospers
[1:57:26] I was telling my son that the other day
[1:57:28] the Bible says in all labor there's
[1:57:29] profit
[1:57:31] say but brother Daniel I don't
[1:57:32] understand I started that business and I
[1:57:34] was trying to build a house and I hit my
[1:57:35] finger on a nail and I bet you won't do
[1:57:38] that again will you
[1:57:40] hit your finger with the hammer like
[1:57:42] that like so in all labor there's profit
[1:57:44] and so whatsoever he does he'll profit
[1:57:47] from it he'll learn from it are you with
[1:57:48] me today bet you'll never make the cake
[1:57:50] like that again
[1:57:52] laugh
[1:57:53] I gotta tell this story
[1:57:57] we had you all have little get-togethers
[1:58:00] and things like that so one day we were
[1:58:01] having a little get-together
[1:58:05] and my wife she was just trying to get
[1:58:07] everything together for this little
[1:58:08] potluck get together and she put some
[1:58:10] cornbread in and she went about getting
[1:58:12] everything ready and she came back and
[1:58:14] it posed in too long and it was black
[1:58:15] just total black so well I got enough
[1:58:18] time since he pulled it out put it in
[1:58:19] the trash can went back and made another
[1:58:21] thing it was going about and cooking the
[1:58:23] other well I just happened to be going
[1:58:24] out of the garage and I looked down man
[1:58:26] there's a nice thing of cornbread round
[1:58:28] cornbread in the trash and it's black
[1:58:30] and my little mind started turning um
[1:58:33] so I got this little piece of cornbread
[1:58:34] and I stuck it in the back of our
[1:58:35] vehicle brother Sean and when they came
[1:58:37] to the little potluck thing and
[1:58:38] everybody set their food out I got that
[1:58:40] little black because everybody went who
[1:58:41] made that who made that who made that I
[1:58:43] got this little black piece of cornbread
[1:58:45] and I set it up there on the top right
[1:58:46] there my wife said she's going down the
[1:58:48] line all of a sudden she looked
[1:58:50] and she saw her burnt cornbread sitting
[1:58:52] on the thing
[1:58:54] how did that Daniel
[1:58:58] and whatsoever you do will prosper you
[1:59:00] think she'll ever do that again no she's
[1:59:02] gonna break that thing up and bury it
[1:59:03] underneath of it everything that a son
[1:59:05] and daughter God does they Prosper it's
[1:59:07] all right to laugh Jesus told say go

[1:59:25] temper brother Branham took him at him
[1:59:27] and he made them laugh at themselves and
[1:59:28] they made them laugh there's something

[1:59:44] in Ephesians chapter one we're caught up
[1:59:45] together in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:59:47] Jesus amen Jesus said I come from God
[1:59:50] I'm going back to God can you say Amen
[1:59:52] to that is that the way you feel I was
[1:59:53] an attribute in the mind of God I came
[1:59:55] from God I'm going back to to God and
[1:59:58] when I go to church I forget about my
[1:59:59] problems I forget about my bad neighbors
[2:00:01] and my motor and the sickness in my body
[2:00:03] because I came from God I'm going back
[2:00:05] to God I'm just on this earth going
[2:00:07] through brother being said you're put
[2:00:08] here to make a decision for Jesus Christ
[2:00:10] and I've made my decision for Jesus
[2:00:12] Christ and we're in Heavenly places
[2:00:13] right I said I tell you I can already be
[2:00:15] there I can see my name right there my
[2:00:18] name written by the table and they say
[2:00:19] look here we got your place right down
[2:00:21] here and this is where you're supposed
[2:00:22] to sit we're in Heavenly places
[2:00:24] are you with me today in a few minutes
[2:00:27] we'll go back to that bad thing called
[2:00:28] Earth they'll say the dismissing prayer
[2:00:30] and we'll go out and get in our cars and
[2:00:31] we need to rotate the tires and we got
[2:00:33] to make that bread next week and our
[2:00:34] bills are coming down we got taxes and
[2:00:36] all that stuff but right now we're in
[2:00:39] Heavenly places I mean everything's okay
[2:00:41] in Heavenly places all my problems seem
[2:00:44] so far away that's why the devil only
[2:00:46] has perversion remember the day of
[2:00:47] Pentecost they came out these are not
[2:00:49] drunk as you suppose there's something
[2:00:50] about the intoxication of the Holy
[2:00:52] Spirit and the alcohol of the world and
[2:00:54] the Bible says be not drunk with wine
[2:00:56] but be filled with this holy spirit amen
[2:00:59] when your troubles seem so far away and
[2:01:01] you just love everybody
[2:01:04] how do you know when somebody's drunk
[2:01:05] they just love everybody they just want
[2:01:07] to love everybody we need some of that
[2:01:09] around the message a little bit start
[2:01:11] loving everybody you need to start with
[2:01:14] the preachers right see when the people
[2:01:16] see the preachers loving each other then
[2:01:18] they'll love each other blessed be the
[2:01:21] name of the Lord what so here you do it
[2:01:23] shall prosper this verse number four is
[2:01:24] so powerful especially young people who
[2:01:26] start looking at the world and the
[2:01:27] glamor of the world the ungodly or not
[2:01:30] so
[2:01:31] but are like the chaff which the Wind
[2:01:33] Drive at the way therefore the ungodly
[2:01:36] shall not stand in the judgment
[2:01:38] nor sinners in the congregation of the
[2:01:41] righteous
[2:01:42] amen we were talking about that the
[2:01:43] other day as a preacher it's my job to
[2:01:45] preach hell hot enough that the sinner
[2:01:47] doesn't want to come in and just sit and
[2:01:48] be comfortable in the house of the Lord
[2:01:49] he says I want to repent amen can you
[2:01:52] say Amen to that that's what's happened
[2:01:54] the church has let down their bar and
[2:01:55] the world's come in and pretty soon we
[2:01:57] got the church in the world sitting
[2:01:58] right together we forget the word church
[2:02:00] means Ecclesia that called out from the
[2:02:02] world we need to stop being like the
[2:02:04] world say we're called out we are
[2:02:06] different we believe in holding us we
[2:02:08] believe in it and filling of the Holy
[2:02:09] Spirit we believe in a prophet we
[2:02:11] believe in the Bible
[2:02:12] say well we don't want your Bible
[2:02:14] remember they told Brother random you
[2:02:15] come to the place he said look Billy you
[2:02:17] can come here but we don't want your God
[2:02:19] and brother bear made this amazing thing
[2:02:21] I'm going to say something right here
[2:02:22] we'll go right down to Facebook and
[2:02:24] Twitter and Snapchat and Instagram and
[2:02:27] all of it because remember there's no
[2:02:29] new thing under the sun the devil just
[2:02:31] changes the way he presents it he was at
[2:02:33] the garage they were having lunch and
[2:02:34] brother Brandon go in there and testify
[2:02:36] and say look Billy we love you and
[2:02:37] you're welcome here but we don't want
[2:02:39] your Jesus brother random made this
[2:02:41] amazing statement he said where Jesus
[2:02:44] Christ isn't welcome I'm not welcome
[2:02:47] brother random said he walked out of the
[2:02:50] place and he said that man he was his
[2:02:52] icy day his man walked got on the curb
[2:02:54] and he slipped on the curb and fell down
[2:02:56] in a big dual axle truck went and ran
[2:02:58] right over the man brother man said I
[2:03:00] wonder if he wanted Jesus Christ then
[2:03:02] and I tell you in this social media when
[2:03:04] the power goes out and you have no way
[2:03:06] to charge your cell phone to get
[2:03:07] Snapchat and Twitter and Instagram I
[2:03:09] wonder if they'll want Jesus Christ in
[2:03:11] Snapchat and Twitter and then and
[2:03:13] Facebook then I said brother you can't
[2:03:15] be a part of that you can't be preachy
[2:03:16] you just kind of got to be love
[2:03:17] everybody and lovey-dovey well I'm sorry
[2:03:20] God called me to be a witness and if I
[2:03:22] can't be a Christian where I am I
[2:03:25] probably don't need to be there if I
[2:03:27] can't be a witness for Jesus Christ I
[2:03:29] probably don't need to be there
[2:03:32] if I say something wrong brother Sean
[2:03:34] you can correct me here but I found
[2:03:36] Facebook in the Bible it's first what is
[2:03:39] it James uh a 4-4 he that is a friend of
[2:03:42] the world friendship with the world is
[2:03:44] enmity with God so when you see somebody
[2:03:47] dressed immoral a girl and moral or man
[2:03:49] out in the bar somewhere and got a pair
[2:03:51] of shirts on and you click like
[2:03:53] my friend you have just become an enemy
[2:03:57] of God there should be something rise up
[2:03:59] inside of you amen it says that's sinful
[2:04:02] that's evil you were once in the house
[2:04:04] of God and you backslid I don't like
[2:04:06] that I like you when you're in the
[2:04:07] presence of God but I don't like this
[2:04:08] backslid and said oh may God help us
[2:04:12] amen Sinners won't stand in the
[2:04:14] congregation of the righteous for the
[2:04:15] Lord knoweth the way of the righteous
[2:04:17] but the way of the heat of the ungodly
[2:04:19] Shall Perish the way of the ungodly
[2:04:21] Shall Perish amen I didn't finish that
[2:04:24] over in Ephesians we got to that one
[2:04:26] part but not the second party Ephesians
[2:04:28] we read the first verse
[2:04:30] Ephesians 1 4 according as he hath
[2:04:32] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[2:04:34] of the world that we should be holy
[2:04:37] now I know in the message we love to
[2:04:39] preach predestination I love it it's
[2:04:41] amazing scripture comes from the Bible
[2:04:43] but the Bible says he's predestinous and
[2:04:46] chosen us before the foundation of the
[2:04:47] world to be holy not Unholy and sinful
[2:04:51] and evil but he ordained us chose us to
[2:04:54] be holy is that what the Bible says that
[2:04:56] we should be holy and Without Blame
[2:04:58] before him in love verse 5 Ephesians 1 5
[2:05:01] having predestinated us unto the
[2:05:04] adoption of children
[2:05:06] he didn't ordained us just to be
[2:05:08] packages in the seed
[2:05:09] a seed in a package I want to just say
[2:05:12] this in this then I'm close
[2:05:14] we heard this and we've said this for
[2:05:16] years I'm a predestinated seed and I'm a
[2:05:19] predestinated seed well that was
[2:05:20] probably okay in the 60s and 70s because
[2:05:22] the message was just coming out but at
[2:05:24] some point we should have stopped being
[2:05:26] a seed and should have got in the ground
[2:05:28] got in a good church where the Holy
[2:05:31] Spirit was falling down where the
[2:05:32] sunlight was falling on us and now we're
[2:05:35] not just a seed but we're a manifested
[2:05:37] seed that is growing through adulthood
[2:05:39] and growing up in Jesus Christ and we
[2:05:41] should have been putting out leaves and
[2:05:43] fruit and now there should be fruit that
[2:05:45] people don't have to ask you if you're
[2:05:46] predestinated see people should say hey
[2:05:50] buy their fruit they will know that your
[2:05:53] predestinated sea is that fair enough
[2:05:55] amen we're talking about chosen Amen to
[2:05:58] be to bear fruit he said I've chosen you
[2:06:00] that you might bear fruit I say Lord I
[2:06:03] want to bear fruit set your desire today
[2:06:05] say Lord I want to bear fruit
[2:06:07] hey man sometimes there's things that
[2:06:09] come in our lives that deform us all of
[2:06:11] us they push us aside whatever that is
[2:06:13] say Lord would you just cut it away
[2:06:15] Ephesians chapter 4 said the word of God
[2:06:17] is a discerner
[2:06:19] of the thoughts and the intents of the
[2:06:21] heart and I haven't preached about a lot
[2:06:23] of things I don't know you you don't
[2:06:24] know me but the holy spirit is a
[2:06:26] discerner today
[2:06:27] and that law goes the pillar of fire
[2:06:29] that was over brother Brandon that's the
[2:06:30] word of God the word of God became flesh
[2:06:33] the word took on flesh and dwelt among
[2:06:34] us and that Pillar of Fire we believe is
[2:06:36] in this room right now and that Pillar
[2:06:38] of Fire is a discerner I don't have to
[2:06:40] know your life but he the Holy Spirit
[2:06:42] knows your life so he'll discern he'll
[2:06:44] go right in your closet he'll go right
[2:06:46] in your history on your on your uh your
[2:06:48] history on your whatever browser you're
[2:06:50] in you go into your phone he'll go into
[2:06:52] your likes and just he needs a discerner
[2:06:54] of the thoughts and the intents when you
[2:06:57] get a little phone number like what are
[2:06:58] you going to do with that and the Holy
[2:06:59] Spirit discerns what that is
[2:07:01] aren't you glad for that God
[2:07:03] I'll serve a God Like That
[2:07:06] we're not serving God because we're
[2:07:07] chained to brother Sean but we're
[2:07:09] chained to a church or a Creed oh the
[2:07:11] message said no we're chained to Christ
[2:07:13] the Bible says in he the Holy Spirit
[2:07:15] when he come he'll reprove the world of
[2:07:17] sin so when you get the Holy Spirit and
[2:07:19] you do wrong the holy spirit says look
[2:07:21] we don't talk like that we don't do that
[2:07:25] we're Sons and Daughters of God but you
[2:07:27] don't understand what she did she stole
[2:07:28] my recipe and she did it at the thing no
[2:07:32] but if you forgive don't forgive your
[2:07:34] brother their trespasses neither will
[2:07:36] your father forgive you your trespasses
[2:07:38] so somewhere you forgive even if it's
[2:07:41] for a selfish reason
[2:07:42] I really don't want to forgive you but I
[2:07:44] got a selfish reason God's not going to
[2:07:46] forgive me if I don't forgive so I
[2:07:48] forgive you so that God will forgive me
[2:07:49] of my trespasses we got too many
[2:07:52] moss-back Christians sitting around and
[2:07:54] got a Mossy and I don't want to be like
[2:07:56] that I want to be a man a Christian
[2:07:58] that's forgiving forgetting those things
[2:08:00] that are behind pressing towards the
[2:08:03] mark of the high calling in Christ I
[2:08:04] want to Bear the fruits of Christ are
[2:08:07] you with me tonight don't you love the
[2:08:09] Lord Jesus you feel his presence here
[2:08:11] tonight listen aren't you glad you went
[2:08:13] to church or you felt the presence of
[2:08:15] God and not because it's brother Daniel
[2:08:17] but God came down my aisle God went into
[2:08:19] my dresser God went into my phone God
[2:08:21] went into them my imaginations and he
[2:08:23] began to discern things and he said look
[2:08:25] that's wrong you can't do that you can't
[2:08:27] and some people walk away because they
[2:08:28] never experience the power of the real
[2:08:31] God they never experienced the real
[2:08:33] power of God and it's in that presence
[2:08:35] where you make changes
[2:08:37] I've talked to the young people about
[2:08:38] that I can stand here and look you need
[2:08:40] to address the Bible says without
[2:08:41] Holiness no matter would be God and
[2:08:43] women be dressed they're modest apparel
[2:08:44] I can tell you but remember Moses walked
[2:08:46] in the presence of God and God said look
[2:08:48] take off your shoes
[2:08:50] and the difference was the presence of
[2:08:52] God now if I walked of this brother said
[2:08:53] take off your shoes like who are you I
[2:08:55] don't have to take off much but it was
[2:08:56] the presence that he was in that says if
[2:08:59] I need to change my wardrobe I'll take
[2:09:01] off my shoes Lord if you think this
[2:09:04] isn't right Lord I'll change my music
[2:09:06] Lord I'll change the places I go I'll
[2:09:09] change how do you say let no corrupt
