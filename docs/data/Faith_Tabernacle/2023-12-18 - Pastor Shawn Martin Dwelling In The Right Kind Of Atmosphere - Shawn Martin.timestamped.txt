[32:13] amen uh the musicians can be dismissed
[32:16] if you have your Bibles we're going to
[32:17] turn to the book of
[32:19] Ephesians the second
[32:22] chapter amen it's certainly good to be a
[32:26] Christian
[32:27] praise the
[32:33] Lord and um let's see Ephesians the 2
[32:39] chapter the uh first verse we will start
[32:44] there it says and you hath he quickened
[32:47] who were dead in trespasses and
[32:49] sins where in time past you walked
[32:52] according to the course of this world
[32:55] according to the prince of the power of
[32:57] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[32:59] the children of
[33:01] Disobedience among among whom also we
[33:04] all had our conversation in times past
[33:07] in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the
[33:09] desires of the Flesh and of the mind and
[33:13] were by Nature the children of Wrath
[33:15] even as
[33:16] others but God who is rich in Mercy for
[33:20] his great love wherewith he had loved us
[33:22] even when we were dead in sins hath
[33:24] quickened us together with Christ by
[33:28] Grace you are saved and hath raised us
[33:31] up together and made us sit together in
[33:35] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen
[33:39] let's just bow our
[33:40] heads
[33:42] father Lord it is an honor to be able to
[33:45] know you and we certainly couldn't know
[33:48] you without you first revealing yourself
[33:51] to
[33:51] us father may we never take this for
[33:54] granted Lord there's going to to come a
[33:57] time when we will gather here for our
[34:00] last
[34:01] time we'll sing Our Song here in this
[34:04] Mortal life for the last time we'll
[34:06] raise our hands in this Mortal body for
[34:10] the Last
[34:11] Time Lord and we want to do all that we
[34:15] can while we're still here father May
[34:19] our hearts yearn Lord just to know you
[34:24] more father may you come in a special
[34:26] way this evening bless what simple words
[34:28] we would have father multiply it Lord as
[34:32] you did the The Fish and Loaves Lord we
[34:35] ask it in Jesus Christ's name
[34:39] amen you can have your seats this
[34:43] evening
[34:45] and the
[34:48] um I guess the my uh thought would be
[34:54] living in the right
[34:55] kind of uh
[34:58] atmosphere and I want to read this
[35:00] scripture from the Amplified Bible and
[35:05] um but it says and you he made alive
[35:10] when you were dead slain by your trans
[35:13] trespasses and
[35:15] sins in which at one time you walked
[35:20] habitually you were following the course
[35:23] and fashion of this
[35:25] world uh were under the sway of the
[35:28] tendency of this present age following
[35:32] the prince of the power of the air you
[35:34] were obedient to and under the control
[35:37] of the demon spirit that still
[35:40] constantly works in the sons of
[35:43] Disobedience the careless the rebellious
[35:46] the unbelieving who go against the
[35:48] purposes of
[35:50] God among these we as well as you once
[35:54] lived and conducted
[35:57] um
[35:58] ourselves uh in the passions of our
[36:01] flesh our Behavior governed by our
[36:04] corrupt and sensual nature obeying the
[36:08] impulses of the Flesh and the thoughts
[36:10] of the Mind are Cravings dictated by our
[36:13] senses and our dark
[36:15] imaginings we were then by Nature
[36:18] children of God's Wrath and Hees of his
[36:21] indignation like the rest of
[36:23] mankind but God's so rich in his
[36:28] Mercy uh because of and in order to
[36:32] satisfy the great and wonderful and
[36:34] intense love with which he loved us even
[36:39] when we were dead slain by our own
[36:41] shortcomings and
[36:43] trespasses he made us alive together in
[36:46] fellowship and in Union with
[36:48] Christ he gave us the very Life of
[36:51] Christ himself the same new life with
[36:55] which he quickened him for it is by
[36:59] Grace his favor and mercy which you did
[37:03] not deserve that you are saved delivered
[37:06] from judgment and made partakers of
[37:08] Christ salvation and he raised us up
[37:13] together with him and made us sit
[37:15] together giving us joint seating with
[37:18] him in the Heavenly sphere by virtue of
[37:23] our being in Christ Jesus the Messiah
[37:27] the anointed one I thought that uh that
[37:31] was pretty
[37:32] powerful and it it actually describes uh
[37:37] really our day and and the the uh where
[37:41] we are because we are seated with him in
[37:45] an Heavenly
[37:47] atmosphere and I'm not going to to keep
[37:50] you long but um I think every part of
[37:54] the word is so important to to us and
[37:58] amen if there's ever a time that we need
[38:01] need to know and I think we should want
[38:03] to know uh what we need to do in life
[38:09] uh it's it's now we we should we want to
[38:13] know I I I I God forbid that we would be
[38:17] just churchgoers of all of our life
[38:19] without really understanding the power
[38:22] and the depth of God's love to us and
[38:26] and the inheritance that he has given to
[38:29] us um and and so we want to we we want
[38:33] to know these things and and so uh
[38:36] brother brandham he he talked about the
[38:38] church he said the Church of the Living
[38:40] God is the pillar of truth of the truth
[38:44] amen and and so then uh uh if truth is
[38:50] going to be proclaimed it's by the
[38:52] Church of God uh it's by the body and
[38:56] and so truth is
[38:58] established uh by it being
[39:01] fulfilled in the church there there
[39:04] there's the written word but then this
[39:06] word must must come to pass it it must
[39:09] be carried out and and so we know that
[39:12] this is the script and and and there's
[39:14] people that are going to be the actors
[39:17] uh in this day for the the word to be
[39:20] fulfilled and so so we are not in
[39:24] interested in writing a Bible this it's
[39:26] already been written but we want that
[39:29] written word now to to live in us to be
[39:33] thoroughly Vindicated that it is right
[39:36] we got so many Skeptics today and
[39:38] unbelievers and scoffers and that don't
[39:40] believe in the promises of God don't
[39:42] believe that God is ex exists don't
[39:44] don't believe in a powerful Church don't
[39:46] they don't believe don't understand
[39:48] don't don't accept it and and while
[39:50] they're denying all this God has a group
[39:53] of people that is vindicating this
[39:55] written word
[39:57] by it fulfilling through their lives and
[40:02] so what God said it now it comes to pass
[40:06] in and by and through the church it it
[40:09] it must and so brother Bram said see God
[40:13] intended this church to be a powerful
[40:16] church not a defeated church not a
[40:19] hopeless church not a beggarly church
[40:22] but a powerful
[40:23] church that means you
[40:27] that means all of us here if we're part
[40:29] of that church we are meant to be
[40:31] powerful
[40:32] Hallelujah and he says a powerful Church
[40:36] a glorious Church a church that the
[40:39] whole world could look upon as a bride
[40:42] of Christ well expected and espouse and
[40:46] to live in such an atmosphere and
[40:49] conduct itself in such a way that God
[40:52] would be proud of this church to present
[40:54] it to Christ at the coming of the lord
[40:57] well I I I believe he's going to have
[40:59] that church I I truly believe that and
[41:02] it's going to be it's going to be a
[41:04] minority it it that church is going to
[41:06] be minority but but and it may not be
[41:09] accepted by presidents and kings and and
[41:12] governments and Bishops and Cardinals
[41:14] and whatever else it may not be that way
[41:16] but God's going to present it yes he
[41:18] will and he's going to be so well
[41:19] pleased with it that he will present it
[41:21] to Christ and I'm so glad to be part of
[41:24] that church and and to be to to be this
[41:27] church would would mean that we are a
[41:29] word church a word bride that every
[41:32] promise that he fulfilled or or declared
[41:34] in this book has been fulfilled by US in
[41:37] US and through us and I I think that's
[41:40] powerful so since since the time of
[41:43] Luther uh the the the the church has
[41:45] been maturing it's it's it's steadily M
[41:48] maturing coming up the life has been
[41:50] coming up coming up and and um uh so in
[41:54] in the last three stages
[41:57] of uh the church ages uh the last three
[41:59] Church ages we've come through three
[42:01] stages of restoration and and uh uh this
[42:05] is God restoring to the church what
[42:09] Satan has has taken away and and and so
[42:13] we we know them things uh by the um
[42:18] um the restoration of the brigh tree and
[42:21] other places but but the the third stage
[42:25] of course was the pentec age but now
[42:27] we're living in that fourth stage
[42:29] brother Brandon plainly taught the
[42:31] fourth stage there is no three stages of
[42:34] restoration there's three stages to a
[42:36] new birth but there's no uh there's four
[42:39] stages to a restoration and we are
[42:42] living in that fourth stage of Life
[42:44] restoration of Life which as we said
[42:48] this morning and and uh is the token
[42:51] it's the personal life of Jesus Christ
[42:54] and and brother brandham said say that
[42:56] you know this is the age of life and
[42:59] he's the Dynamics he's the quickening
[43:02] power and and he's come in this day to
[43:05] Quicken that that word seed do you
[43:07] believe that amen and so uh uh the age
[43:10] of life which is the personal life of
[43:12] Jesus Christ vindicating the promised
[43:15] word in us and so it's Jesus Christ the
[43:19] same yesterday today and forever in the
[43:22] body of Christ in US aren't you glad to
[43:25] be part of that amen and so as as
[43:29] individuals as the church has has has
[43:31] gone so as as we as individuals are are
[43:36] ripening we're we're growing uh in the
[43:38] word and and and and this is why we come
[43:41] to church is to grow in the word and to
[43:44] grow in our experience and uh Christian
[43:47] experience with God and grow in our
[43:50] fellowship and and with God and uh
[43:53] relationship and see we don't come to uh
[43:56] uh come to waste time we're not wasting
[43:59] time by our gathering and and we're
[44:01] we're we're we're you know just uh uh
[44:05] what whatever there you know the Bible
[44:07] says that judgment begins at the house
[44:09] of God so so this is why we coming is is
[44:12] for a judgment and and and you know uh
[44:16] the prophet talked like if you know if
[44:18] we were going to go to court and and you
[44:20] know for trial well there's a book of
[44:23] the law that we would be judged by amen
[44:26] that's what makes the whole trial worth
[44:28] anything is there is a book that that
[44:31] judgment comes from amen and and so uh
[44:35] uh so is it uh uh that the house of God
[44:39] Amen we take our judgment by the word of
[44:42] God by this word ain't that right amen
[44:45] and how precious it is to us we want to
[44:47] be judged by that word amen because it's
[44:50] by that word that we find out what is
[44:52] lacking in our lives we we we see what
[44:55] we need to be in Christ we see you know
[44:59] uh what we maybe need to give up or need
[45:01] to hold on to or uh uh you know and and
[45:05] and and all of these things uh and it's
[45:08] not a condemnation to us but it's
[45:12] actually a Grace that we could come amen
[45:15] and be actually or let's say accurately
[45:19] judged amen by the uh the the book of of
[45:24] of God's word ain't that right amen see
[45:27] so uh uh and so what what we're doing is
[45:30] it's it's actually the word seed that is
[45:34] ripening in the presence of the sun this
[45:38] this ripening that we're going through
[45:41] it's it's nothing to do with the
[45:42] perfecting of the flesh uh we we all
[45:45] have our ups and downs and our issues
[45:48] and things that we we we we we deal with
[45:51] on an everyday basis and and that's just
[45:53] the carnal man and things and and
[45:56] brother Brown said you know as as long
[45:57] as you live in this body you're going to
[45:59] have a sticky nature and that's just the
[46:00] way it is but so we're not we're not
[46:03] perfecting that but we there there is
[46:05] that word seed that is ripening and we
[46:09] are becoming more powerful not as mortal
[46:13] beings not in the sense of Flesh getting
[46:16] our Bazookas and and and things like
[46:18] that if they take away the guns we're
[46:21] still a powerful church if if they take
[46:24] away all of our rights we're still a
[46:26] powerful Church no matter what they do
[46:29] it it has nothing to do with this
[46:31] literal natural substance we are still a
[46:34] powerful church because and and that's
[46:37] what's ripening that's that's what we're
[46:39] coming into amen is is this ripening so
[46:43] now uh uh it's the word seed and and
[46:47] that word seed can only grow in the
[46:49] right atmosphere ain't that right so so
[46:53] like brother Brown said you can lay a
[46:55] seed out out there in the ground and no
[46:57] matter how much uh that seed is gerti
[47:00] and and layeth there it's got to have an
[47:03] atmosphere to make it live it's got to
[47:06] you believe that no matter what that
[47:09] word is inside of you it's got to have
[47:11] an atmosphere for that word to live Amen
[47:15] to to mature so he said see that sun has
[47:19] to come to a certain power before uh uh
[47:23] to bring it it can bring that seed to a
[47:25] certain atmosphere see uh to bring it to
[47:28] a certain atmosphere for that seed so I
[47:31] I can we can I think all can truly say
[47:33] and believe that the Sun s so n has come
[47:37] to that certain atmosphere to where the
[47:40] sun is is shining in its full string to
[47:44] bring that word seed within you and I
[47:47] Amen to its Harvest Time to full
[47:51] maturity we're living in Harvest do you
[47:54] believe that so so every word that has
[47:56] been laying dormant in this Bible that
[47:59] speaks of the bride of Christ is now now
[48:03] being made flesh in you and I we're
[48:05] we're not going to be lacking amen uh uh
[48:09] in these promises we're not coming up
[48:11] short see so so what is it that this s
[48:14] so n that that that the the the presence
[48:18] of the Sun the the the revealing of the
[48:20] sun is bringing the right kind of
[48:23] atmosphere to bring forth a har crop do
[48:26] you believe that and so it it's amazing
[48:29] what an atmosphere does and and brother
[48:31] Brandon does talk a lot about atmosphere
[48:34] and and and and we we we know the
[48:37] importance of it but you know he he he
[48:40] talks and and maybe some of you have
[48:42] tried it about an egg you you can get an
[48:44] uh an egg of a whatever and you can put
[48:48] it in any kind of atmosphere put it
[48:51] under a pup and keep that you know that
[48:53] pup down tie him down enough or what
[48:55] ever and and to where there's an
[48:57] atmosphere there and that egg will hatch
[48:59] under a pup or whatever SE and and so uh
[49:04] brother Brown said see any seed
[49:05] everybody say any seed any seed will
[49:09] bring forth of its kind if it's in the
[49:12] right condition and the right atmosphere
[49:15] so we want to know that we have the word
[49:17] seed how many believes you have the word
[49:19] seed it's a predestinated seed if you
[49:22] have the word of seed uh the word seed
[49:24] in your heart then then you you know
[49:26] that every promise in this book is mine
[49:29] every promise I don't have to beg God
[49:31] for it don't have to plead for it don't
[49:33] have to say man I I'll wait for another
[49:35] day for it no no no it's in you it it's
[49:38] in you and this is the time for ripening
[49:41] this is the time that the word takes
[49:43] flesh in you that it now begins to take
[49:47] hold in in you can you say Amen we we've
[49:50] looked at them days we uh uh and and
[49:54] Jesus said if you say to this Mountain
[49:55] be thou removed be doubt not in your
[49:57] heart you all know the scripture it's in
[50:00] this day it's time it's time for this
[50:02] scripture to be made manifest it doesn't
[50:05] only just belong for a prophet
[50:06] absolutely not amen I believe it belongs
[50:09] to the body of Believers amen I just
[50:12] believe that so this is just where we're
[50:14] at see and so uh uh any seed will bring
[50:18] forth of its kind if it's in the right
[50:21] atmosphere and the right condition we
[50:23] know that there is a wrong wrong
[50:25] atmosphere and there's a right
[50:27] atmosphere brother Bram talks about it
[50:29] if you're going to go do a dance and and
[50:31] you're want to have a good time you know
[50:33] I've never been to one you know but uh
[50:36] I've passed by you know where people are
[50:38] dancing and they're playing that music
[50:39] and the strobe lights and all of that
[50:41] and and you know you look in there and
[50:44] and they're they're they're having a
[50:45] wonderful dark you know and and then
[50:47] they got these neon lights and stuff and
[50:49] and things like that but brother Brown
[50:51] said see if you're wanting to go in them
[50:53] places and you're wanting to dance and
[50:55] have a ball you got to have the right
[50:57] atmosphere right and he says see if if
[51:00] if in if if you're going and then then
[51:03] someone in there says well I don't know
[51:04] if I'm going to dance or not I I don't
[51:06] know you know and and you get people
[51:09] like that well that that's not going to
[51:11] create a right atmosphere said then you
[51:13] get the the the musicians and they're
[51:15] playing near my God to thee he says he
[51:18] chose that song near my God to thee you
[51:20] know and you're wanting to have a dance
[51:22] club and you're wanting to go out and
[51:23] party well wrong music for that type of
[51:27] atmosphere right so so uh uh you know so
[51:31] so brother Brown said see it's not
[51:32] creating an atmosphere for a dance he
[51:35] said the only way to bring an atmosphere
[51:37] for a dance is some put some music that
[51:40] makes dance see then you put the people
[51:44] in the mood for dance you're creating an
[51:47] atmosphere then something's going to
[51:49] happen then those that are expecting to
[51:51] have a dance party they're going to come
[51:54] into this atmosphere and fulfill amen
[51:58] everything that they've been expecting
[52:00] amen see so he says then it gets
[52:03] everybody to thinking about what a good
[52:05] time they're going to have at the dance
[52:06] party just dancing and carrying on why
[52:10] it's the right kind of Atmosphere for it
[52:14] ain't that right so he says now put the
[52:17] right kind of a uh a music on the on the
[52:20] piano the organ and everybody in the
[52:23] atmosphere that Jesus is there and is
[52:26] going to meet everything that they have
[52:29] need of something will go and take place
[52:33] he said because it's the atmosphere
[52:36] ain't that right amen see so then then
[52:39] it's not all about just us coming to
[52:40] church believeing God sent a prophet and
[52:42] hearing the word of God and all these
[52:44] things we've got to have the atmosphere
[52:46] for it this is why we got the music this
[52:48] is why we got the singing this is why we
[52:50] got everything it's to create an
[52:53] atmosphere this is why we worship
[52:55] worship this is why we encourage people
[52:57] amen you to come to the house of God a
[52:59] little early amen and and get get your
[53:02] mind off of everything and focus in on
[53:04] the word of God and and and train on the
[53:07] thoughts of God and and come expecting
[53:09] God to do something because you're
[53:12] creating an atmosphere for all things to
[53:16] become possible now I know these things
[53:18] we all know these things but it's just
[53:20] to remind us that that if if we are
[53:23] expecting this word seed to grow there's
[53:26] got to be an atmosphere for growth do
[53:29] you believe that amen that's right see
[53:32] so now the prophet said the hardest
[53:34] thing to do is getting people in the
[53:36] atmosphere of worship that he said
[53:39] that's the hardest thing is getting the
[53:40] people in the atmosphere of worship in
[53:43] the atmosphere of believing amen but see
[53:46] we we've got a message amen we we've got
[53:49] the word of God we've got the the seals
[53:51] have been open we've got the greatest
[53:53] message on the face of the Earth that it
[53:55] should not be hard for us to enter into
[53:59] an atmosphere amen but I think a lot of
[54:02] times it is is because things get common
[54:04] to us we get into an everyday life and a
[54:07] pattern and a ritual and things like
[54:09] that and then on top of that we've got
[54:12] so much entertainment amen and and and
[54:15] and you all know what the prophet said
[54:17] about it so many voices out there that
[54:19] is is drowning the voice of God Amen to
[54:23] where the voice of God is becoming
[54:26] foreign to us but see the voice of God
[54:29] is real the word of God is true it's
[54:33] powerful how many believes it's powerful
[54:36] it's powerful for any situation amen see
[54:40] now brother BR said see so so the
[54:43] hardest thing to do is getting the
[54:44] people in the right kind of uh uh in the
[54:47] atmosphere of worship in the atmosphere
[54:49] of believing and he said this is why a
[54:51] Divine Life uh is called and set aside
[54:55] as being a fanatic and crazy to the
[54:57] general public amen see um uh not not
[55:01] everybody understands the the real true
[55:05] way of a Christian Life and and so it's
[55:08] it's becomes fanatical it becomes holier
[55:10] than thou you know the thought of these
[55:12] things and it set aside as something
[55:15] weird you know and and brother Brown
[55:18] said the reason why is because you've
[55:20] changed Dwelling Places you went from
[55:22] one atmosphere to another atmosphere and
[55:25] I like that how he puts that Dwelling
[55:27] Places it's it's not just a a second
[55:31] thing an hour thing a monthly thing it's
[55:34] it's a constant thing you're you
[55:37] dwelling from you went from dwelling in
[55:40] this atmosphere to now dwelling in
[55:42] another atmosphere right amen and and
[55:46] and is the word the seat one of these
[55:47] seat one of these atmospheres is going
[55:49] to produce something you know it it it's
[55:51] going to produce something and and so
[55:53] you're dwelling in this atmosphere there
[55:56] there are so many people billions of
[55:59] people today and you all know it as well
[56:01] as I do that that are so negative
[56:04] negative negative negative you hear the
[56:06] negative on television uh whether it's
[56:09] in it don't matter where it's at
[56:12] newspaper uh news um uh but it's just
[56:15] constant negative and and and it's it's
[56:19] a negative atmosphere they're Negative
[56:22] they produce a negative atmosphere an
[56:24] atmosphere complaining an atmosphere of
[56:27] griping grumbling and and uh an
[56:30] atmosphere to where people dwell in a
[56:33] dis despondent it's it's they dwell in a
[56:37] despondent atmosphere and in other words
[56:39] that word despondent is hopeless it's a
[56:41] it's a they dwell in an atmosphere to
[56:44] where they're they're hopeless it's
[56:45] despairing it's just you know and and
[56:49] and they they they they live in a in a
[56:52] world an atmosphere where the the the
[56:56] the glasses half empty you know and and
[56:59] and and and so uh you know and and this
[57:03] is what the world is producing today
[57:05] it's it's just it's it's just a an
[57:09] atmosphere of Gloom an atmosphere of
[57:12] Doom and an atmosphere of of all of
[57:16] these things well you know and and and
[57:18] to be honest just just put it simple
[57:21] it's an atmosphere of
[57:23] unbelief it's an atmosphere of unbelief
[57:25] where faith is slow they they they've
[57:28] turned down the word of God they turned
[57:30] down the promises they've turned down
[57:32] anything positive that God had for them
[57:35] they've turned it all down and and and
[57:37] when you turn that down when you shun
[57:39] that when you look away from the
[57:40] promises and Redemption and and all that
[57:42] to something else you're going to look
[57:43] to Doom and Gloom and and hopelessness
[57:46] and despair and that's where people are
[57:48] living and and so no one really seems to
[57:51] have happiness and joy and and and and a
[57:55] lot of people claiming to be Christians
[57:57] going to church but but it's not it's
[58:00] it's an atmosphere they're living in and
[58:03] the word seems so distant from them it's
[58:06] it's almost like the the the the the the
[58:08] donkey chasing the the carrot all day
[58:11] you know and the carrots out there and
[58:13] he's chasing and he's exhausted but it's
[58:15] never coming to you know completion it's
[58:18] they're never connecting you understand
[58:20] what I'm saying well it's the atmosphere
[58:22] the word is powerful the word is is
[58:26] supreme the word can override anything
[58:29] do you believe that it can override the
[58:32] lawyer it can override the judge it can
[58:35] override the the banker it can override
[58:38] the the any situation that you're going
[58:41] through the word can but it takes an
[58:44] atmosphere for that word to to to be
[58:47] exercised in to the power that it is see
[58:51] God can't dwell in in an atmosphere of
[58:54] unbelief
[58:55] he can't he can't dwell in an atmosphere
[58:57] of grumbling and complaining and and and
[59:01] and when when there's just constantly
[59:02] being voiced of well I don't know if
[59:05] it's ever going to work and I just don't
[59:06] know and and you know uh uh uh you know
[59:10] the doctor says this so we might as well
[59:12] just put up with it I I don't know you
[59:14] know I think my little kid is a little
[59:16] devil you know and and and and and I
[59:19] don't don't know what's going to happen
[59:20] to them I don't know I'm doing
[59:22] everything I can and they ain't getting
[59:24] we you know and and what you're doing
[59:26] you're living in an atmosphere you're
[59:29] creating atmosphere for where the devil
[59:32] can just have Heyday with anything he
[59:34] wants to with you see because the word
[59:37] can't have preeminence in the atmosphere
[59:39] you're
[59:40] creating can you say Amen so God can't
[59:43] dwell in it the word seed cannot grow in
[59:46] an atmosphere as that see so to to go
[59:50] from dwelling in in that kind of
[59:53] atmosphere to dwell in in an atmosphere
[59:56] of Faith then you you you actually live
[1:00:00] in a totally different world uh uh or
[1:00:04] and in a totally different environment
[1:00:06] amen and then that's what makes you
[1:00:08] strange why while someone can look at
[1:00:11] the glass and they can explain to you
[1:00:14] why it's half empty you can explain to
[1:00:16] them why it's half full see and and and
[1:00:19] and it is it's just the atmosphere two
[1:00:21] atmospheres in the same room even but
[1:00:24] but it's it's in the world that you're
[1:00:26] living in see so a person who has faith
[1:00:29] is so different from a person who has
[1:00:32] unbelief they look at things differently
[1:00:34] they talk about things differently even
[1:00:36] talking about the same subjects even
[1:00:38] amen you can talk about your your your
[1:00:40] child's sickness and and and one person
[1:00:42] can have faith in and say well God's
[1:00:43] going to heal that individual I just
[1:00:45] know it God's God Is A Healer and then
[1:00:47] the other person that that lives in an
[1:00:49] atmosphere of unbelief well the doctor
[1:00:51] says I I just don't know I I you know
[1:00:53] he's had this for a long long time
[1:00:55] you're talking to the same guy the same
[1:00:57] subject the same everything two
[1:00:59] different outlooks because one is living
[1:01:00] in an atmosphere of faith and the other
[1:01:02] one is living in an atmosphere of
[1:01:05] unbelief it's true now amen see so so
[1:01:09] their their outlook on life or or the
[1:01:11] situation that they're in is totally
[1:01:13] different one from another it's because
[1:01:16] one lives in an atmosphere of faith and
[1:01:18] the other one lives in an atmosphere of
[1:01:21] unbelief you see the negative becomes
[1:01:24] realityy Amen to those who live in in uh
[1:01:28] uh the atmosphere of unbelief that's
[1:01:31] right that's why brother Brown said if
[1:01:32] you come to find negative in the church
[1:01:34] and something to criticize you'll find
[1:01:36] it ain't that interesting that that two
[1:01:38] people can come and see two different
[1:01:40] things and find two different things in
[1:01:42] the church one is is coming to criticize
[1:01:45] and they find every reason and it's
[1:01:46] justifiable reasons to them in their
[1:01:49] mind why to criticize why the other one
[1:01:52] come just to see God and he sees God and
[1:01:54] he has justif justifiable reasons as to
[1:01:58] why God is in there in his presence and
[1:02:00] he receives it amen and both actually
[1:02:02] get what they've come looking for amen
[1:02:05] but it's the
[1:02:07] atmosphere can you say Amen see so so
[1:02:11] the negative becomes reality to those
[1:02:13] who live in the atmosphere of unbelief
[1:02:15] whereas the positive becomes reality to
[1:02:19] those and I say positive I'm not talking
[1:02:21] positive thinking I'm talking about
[1:02:23] every word of God amen it becomes
[1:02:26] reality to those who live in an
[1:02:29] atmosphere of Faith you don't look how
[1:02:31] long it's been you don't look how
[1:02:33] desperate the situation is you don't
[1:02:35] look at the impossibility you're just
[1:02:37] looking to God's word and watching that
[1:02:40] word become
[1:02:42] reality amen see God can work in an
[1:02:44] atmosphere of faith God works in an
[1:02:47] atmosphere amen of of belief ain't that
[1:02:50] right well the Bible says all things are
[1:02:52] possible to them that believe so see the
[1:02:56] right kind of atmosphere brings the
[1:02:58] supernatural Among Us that's right it's
[1:03:01] because the ones who believe create an
[1:03:04] atmosphere of Faith amen that's why all
[1:03:07] things all things are possible to them
[1:03:09] that believe if you're having heart
[1:03:11] issues all things are possible if you
[1:03:13] can just believe it you're having you
[1:03:15] know uh mental problems all things are
[1:03:17] possible to them that believe you're
[1:03:20] you're you're up against the wall where
[1:03:22] all things are possible to them that
[1:03:24] belief you see the word of God will
[1:03:27] never change God has done everything
[1:03:29] possible to let you know and to let me
[1:03:31] know that he'll never fail upon his word
[1:03:34] but now now it's up to you to create the
[1:03:37] atmosphere What atmosphere are we going
[1:03:39] to live in I I understand I understand
[1:03:42] the doctors don't always agree with the
[1:03:44] way the word of God says but we will
[1:03:45] agree with the word of God I understand
[1:03:48] our own symptoms our own our own bodies
[1:03:50] doesn't always agree with the word of
[1:03:52] God our own bodies will tell us well
[1:03:54] you'll always have this you'll always be
[1:03:56] in that situation you'll always be blind
[1:03:58] you'll always fight arthritis you'll
[1:04:00] always fight hard condition well the
[1:04:02] word of God says I don't have to so but
[1:04:04] it all depends on what atmosphere you
[1:04:06] live in can you say Amen see so we we
[1:04:10] find that when Jesus went and and uh uh
[1:04:14] Jas came up to him and said my my
[1:04:17] daughter's dying and and I need you
[1:04:21] would you come and lay hands on Jesus
[1:04:23] said sure I'll come well as they went uh
[1:04:26] servant comes says trouble not the
[1:04:27] master your daughter's dead and Jesus
[1:04:30] said but if you if thou just can believe
[1:04:33] it'll be all right so he said come on
[1:04:36] you know let's go they got in that house
[1:04:38] and what did Jesus mean but scoffers and
[1:04:42] uh scorners and people that just did not
[1:04:45] receive him here was the resurrection in
[1:04:48] life here was the God of all Heaven he
[1:04:52] had come purposefully to raise that girl
[1:04:55] up amen but here was the scoffers here
[1:04:58] was the unbelievers they didn't believe
[1:05:00] in it they just like today ain't that
[1:05:02] right he has come purposefully to raise
[1:05:06] a church up to resurrect can you say
[1:05:09] Amen to show forth his resurrection
[1:05:11] power amen but Jesus could not raise
[1:05:13] that girl up with all of this atmosphere
[1:05:16] of laughing and scorning and unbelief so
[1:05:19] he kicked them out he got unbelief on
[1:05:22] the outside amen to where it was just
[1:05:25] him jaras amen and his his lovely wife
[1:05:29] amen and brother Brown said there was an
[1:05:31] atmosphere of Faith right there he got
[1:05:33] the atmosphere of unbelief away from him
[1:05:36] amen and he was able to raise that child
[1:05:38] up from the dead the power of
[1:05:41] Resurrection was made a reality in the
[1:05:45] right atmosphere do you believe that you
[1:05:48] know brother BR said when you you get
[1:05:49] around where there's arguments you get
[1:05:51] in that type of atmosphere see if there
[1:05:54] something in the church someone who's
[1:05:55] disobedient acting very ugly in the
[1:05:58] church and causing trouble you'll never
[1:06:00] be able to have a Revival as long as
[1:06:02] that kind of atmosphere is
[1:06:04] around ain't that amazing it's the
[1:06:06] atmosphere the word of God can be
[1:06:08] preached the same word the promises all
[1:06:10] these things but it's the atmosphere
[1:06:12] amen so sometimes God gets that unbelief
[1:06:15] out to where he can start actually
[1:06:17] moving hello amen that's right see so we
[1:06:21] are every one of us now we as we read
[1:06:25] we've been raised up as Sons and
[1:06:27] Daughters of God this is not an incident
[1:06:30] this is just not a or coincident amen uh
[1:06:34] uh something that just happened that
[1:06:36] Christ deliberately took you who were a
[1:06:39] nobody who who who was walking after the
[1:06:42] course of this world who who was walking
[1:06:45] under the same influence in the same
[1:06:48] atmosphere of this world and he brought
[1:06:51] you out he saved you he he delivered you
[1:06:55] and he raised us up to sit with him in
[1:06:58] Heavenly atmosphere Heavenly places can
[1:07:01] you say amen amen now you think of that
[1:07:04] because he's going to use you Amen to
[1:07:06] display his word he's going to use you
[1:07:08] Amen to display his power amen the same
[1:07:11] power that raised up Lazarus from the
[1:07:13] dead think of that that power is in you
[1:07:17] the power that's going to raise us up
[1:07:19] out of here and to transform our bodies
[1:07:22] that power is living inside of you you
[1:07:25] don't need new power amen all you need
[1:07:27] is to create an atmosphere of Faith amen
[1:07:30] faith is what's going to make this thing
[1:07:32] work Faith amen is going to get us out
[1:07:34] of here faith that atmosphere is going
[1:07:37] to change this vile
[1:07:40] body it's going to Hallelujah see so
[1:07:44] we've been raised we've been raised in
[1:07:47] an atmosphere so so what that means is
[1:07:50] is you and I have a responsibility say
[1:07:53] we have a
[1:07:55] responsibility yep we are responsible
[1:07:57] for creating an atmosphere we are
[1:08:00] responsible for creating the right
[1:08:02] atmosphere you see we're living in Le
[1:08:05] osia and I know I understand you think
[1:08:08] well Heavenly places I sure don't feel
[1:08:10] Heavenly create the
[1:08:13] atmosphere is that
[1:08:15] right well I live in Le odyssea I'm
[1:08:17] tired and and I I just I got so many F
[1:08:21] just AES and pains and and oh just
[1:08:24] everybody around just ugly looking and
[1:08:26] and you know and then you look at the
[1:08:29] filth and you look at all the
[1:08:31] unbelief you're talking about atmosphere
[1:08:34] they create this atmosphere all around
[1:08:37] but you know what that atmosphere is
[1:08:39] look at what that atmosphere is breeding
[1:08:41] homosexuals
[1:08:43] transgenders
[1:08:45] rebelliousness it's it's it's it's it's
[1:08:48] it's breeding things that atmosphere why
[1:08:51] the devil's able to have Liberty it's
[1:08:54] he's the god of the world now he's able
[1:08:57] to create his at his Eden through their
[1:08:59] unbelief he's able to do things through
[1:09:01] their unbelief the atmosphere that they
[1:09:03] created gives him the Liberty you create
[1:09:07] the atmosphere of a Heavenly atmosphere
[1:09:09] and Satan's power will be
[1:09:11] limited that's right it'll be limited so
[1:09:14] see you you you you look at all these
[1:09:16] things well the people of Leota they're
[1:09:19] they're creating their own atmosphere
[1:09:22] see and and and it's an atmosphere of
[1:09:24] unbelief and and we all know that
[1:09:26] because God would send a prophet they
[1:09:29] kicked him out they kicked the word out
[1:09:31] they kicked the revealing of the son
[1:09:32] they didn't want nothing to do with all
[1:09:33] of that they called it whatever they
[1:09:35] wanted to call it you know they they
[1:09:37] they called it mind reading mental
[1:09:38] telepathy psychology and yada Yad yada
[1:09:41] and and and and and Satan Was preparing
[1:09:44] the people for this time you know
[1:09:45] through all these denominational
[1:09:47] teachings and all that and then when God
[1:09:49] come to reveal himself they didn't want
[1:09:51] it because it was against their
[1:09:52] ideologies of what they've accepted as
[1:09:54] the truth ain't that right so now
[1:09:57] they're living in an atmosphere of
[1:09:59] unbelief and they don't know how to stop
[1:10:01] it kids are going to school shooting
[1:10:03] their teachers and and and they don't
[1:10:05] know how to stop it oh get rid of the
[1:10:07] guns no it ain't going to work it's an
[1:10:10] atmosphere it's an atmosphere can you
[1:10:12] say Amen you see if you don't believe
[1:10:15] the word of God there will be an
[1:10:16] atmosphere on the other side that Satan
[1:10:19] will be able to torment you he'll be
[1:10:20] able to afflict you he'll be able to
[1:10:22] bring you to an early grave if he can
[1:10:24] help it you you understand what I'm
[1:10:26] saying he he'll he'll he'll do
[1:10:28] everything he can to destroy you but
[1:10:30] here we are in this leot ofy and age
[1:10:34] have been lifted up and given that
[1:10:36] ability given the power to create our
[1:10:39] own atmosphere and it's a Heavenly
[1:10:42] atmosphere yes sir that's
[1:10:45] right we as sons of God are not to live
[1:10:48] in that atmosphere that they live in we
[1:10:50] are not to
[1:10:51] create I hope you understand stand we're
[1:10:54] not we're we're not to create the
[1:10:55] atmosphere that LE Odyssey has been
[1:10:57] creating see they're creating it by
[1:10:59] denying the words where do they go so
[1:11:02] they go to the doctors doctor says
[1:11:04] you're going to die oh really I'm going
[1:11:06] to
[1:11:08] die that's all they have that's right
[1:11:11] because they've rejected the promise of
[1:11:13] God Amen right so they have no ability
[1:11:17] to create anything else they've allowed
[1:11:19] their televisions to come in that's and
[1:11:22] it's created an atmosphere
[1:11:24] right it has so bombarded their minds
[1:11:27] that they don't know what to do what
[1:11:29] else do we do that's right amen they
[1:11:33] they they've projected broken homes so
[1:11:34] much through the television that now
[1:11:36] everybody's true having broken
[1:11:40] homes it it it it's created an
[1:11:44] atmosphere right but we're not to create
[1:11:48] that atmosphere we're Believers yes sir
[1:11:51] God sent the pro Propet with the word
[1:11:55] that you could create a different
[1:11:58] atmosphere when your your child is sick
[1:12:01] and this is not psychology this is just
[1:12:04] believing the word of God when your
[1:12:06] child is sick and you don't know what to
[1:12:09] do about it don't just sit there and
[1:12:11] just dwell on that thing and speak
[1:12:14] negative take God at his
[1:12:18] word you don't have to be that
[1:12:21] way hello yeah but you you don't
[1:12:25] understand and that's that's the thing
[1:12:26] when you speak the positive things
[1:12:28] people get offended by that like you're
[1:12:30] being
[1:12:32] insensitive well I'm not going to sit
[1:12:34] there and create an atmosphere with you
[1:12:36] I'm not going to sit in that atmosphere
[1:12:38] of unbelief you want to live like that
[1:12:40] you want to be like that that's up to
[1:12:42] you that's right be that way be sick all
[1:12:44] your life be a sickly person that's
[1:12:46] right but you don't have to
[1:12:51] be just don't have to you don't have to
[1:12:54] be
[1:12:55] depressed you don't have to be beat down
[1:12:58] you you don't have to carry these things
[1:13:01] create the
[1:13:02] atmosphere God has given us his word to
[1:13:05] create the atmosphere amen can you
[1:13:09] sayen if if we're not careful we'll let
[1:13:12] the devil just again beat us down to to
[1:13:15] the point that we conduct ourselves like
[1:13:18] the world we conduct ourselves like like
[1:13:20] everything else people are ending their
[1:13:24] lives by
[1:13:26] suicide because they're in an atmosphere
[1:13:28] of
[1:13:30] despondency and don't think the devil
[1:13:32] will try to get you into won't try to
[1:13:34] get you into that place he will he does
[1:13:36] it he does it all the time but we refuse
[1:13:39] to live in that atmosphere we refuse to
[1:13:42] take God at his word over anything or we
[1:13:45] we accept God's word and refuse to
[1:13:47] accept anything else so brother Bram
[1:13:51] said the the word seed of God cannot
[1:13:52] grow in the atmosphere of knowledge and
[1:13:55] wisdom it just can't see so so the
[1:13:58] realities of God cannot be made made
[1:14:01] made known in in that kind of atmosphere
[1:14:04] it's the atmosphere of Faith everybody
[1:14:06] say it's the atmosphere of Faith
[1:14:08] atmosphere faith that the word can only
[1:14:10] grow in it's it's the realities of the
[1:14:14] word is not so far from you that you
[1:14:16] can't reach it's just the atmosphere of
[1:14:21] Faith amen amen you love the
[1:14:24] Lord so as I said we're we're living in
[1:14:27] in the age where the whole word of God
[1:14:29] has been restored to us and he the
[1:14:31] quickening power is here it's it's here
[1:14:35] to make that word live within you and I
[1:14:38] so we're we are past the age of
[1:14:40] dissecting the word we're past the age
[1:14:43] of arguing the word we we are past the
[1:14:47] stage of trying to believe the
[1:14:50] word ain't that right that's right we
[1:14:53] are the true word
[1:14:55] bride that's right perfect Faith coming
[1:14:58] to a perfect Faith where it's the word
[1:15:00] over everything yeah and so the prophet
[1:15:03] would call us The Virtuous bride of
[1:15:06] Christ we are virgin to the word yeah
[1:15:09] other words our
[1:15:11] womb is not open to
[1:15:14] anything else outside the word of God
[1:15:17] remember Eve's womb
[1:15:19] was she was to accept the word that's
[1:15:21] what her womb was for was to accept the
[1:15:23] word to receive word seed but she didn't
[1:15:27] she received other seed but God's got a
[1:15:29] bride in this
[1:15:31] age can you say
[1:15:33] amen and and so if you notice it's the
[1:15:37] atmosphere of faith that that kind of
[1:15:40] atmosphere is the only atmosphere that
[1:15:42] Christ can hang around you know we read
[1:15:45] the scripture of where he speaks to the
[1:15:47] the Fig Tree and I'm closing but he fix
[1:15:50] he he he he he goes to the F tree gets
[1:15:53] something wants to get something to eat
[1:15:55] there ain't no fruit so he curses it he
[1:15:57] goes into town to Jerusalem and then we
[1:15:59] read the next day he comes out of
[1:16:02] Jerusalem and and brother Bram said you
[1:16:04] know why he he left early is because he
[1:16:07] goes there and he says and they were
[1:16:09] fussing at him arguing with him and he
[1:16:13] just couldn't stand
[1:16:16] it he just didn't like that
[1:16:20] atmosphere so he goes out
[1:16:23] see it's the wrong kind of atmosphere so
[1:16:26] he loves to be around Believers because
[1:16:28] they're able to create the right
[1:16:30] atmosphere that he can stay in can you
[1:16:34] say Amen you love the Lord amen now as
[1:16:38] if the musicians will come he says and I
[1:16:41] want you to be sure now he says watch
[1:16:43] real close God promised Eve the time
[1:16:46] would come when the word would be
[1:16:48] restored by her seed this word itself
[1:16:51] would become seed and when they give her
[1:16:54] a substitute she held that substitute
[1:16:57] and when the word come to her what did
[1:16:59] she do she didn't want it it was too
[1:17:01] humble didn't look right to her wasn't
[1:17:04] polished enough a stable oh my see a guy
[1:17:08] like that not a day and skew well I I
[1:17:11] can't accept that see that's no Messiah
[1:17:14] see a guy let guys kick him around like
[1:17:17] that and then call that Messiah let let
[1:17:19] them put a rag around his face then hit
[1:17:21] him on the head see and he called
[1:17:23] himself a prophet a real Prophet would
[1:17:25] raised up see he said see so he goes on
[1:17:29] down he saids now God promised spiritual
