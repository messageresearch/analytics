[44:52] the Lord Elohim he made an unconditional
[44:54] Covenant with Abraham to have and to
[44:57] possess and to own this land of Canaan
[45:00] Israel now I'm going to read another
[45:02] scripture and let's turn to Psalms 137
[45:05] read the first six verses there if You'
[45:08] like to follow with this this is really
[45:09] sets another Foundation here for for
[45:12] Israel Palestine Jerusalem especially
[45:15] Jerusalem Psalms 137 verse1 now the
[45:19] scene here is is the the the desolate
[45:21] and Afflicted uh Jewish people they're
[45:24] in Babylon captive away from Israel away
[45:28] from Palestine away from Jerusalem
[45:30] they're down in Babylon so they writes
[45:32] this song of course David was not in
[45:34] Babylon and and in Exile like Daniel and
[45:38] Hebrew children but he by inspiration
[45:40] writes this verse one one 1371 by the
[45:43] Rivers of Babylon there we sat down yay
[45:46] we wept when we remembered Zion or
[45:51] Jerusalem so it's you know it was
[45:53] customary for the Jews to have their
[45:55] little meetings by by the river so they
[45:56] sit down by the river and they're
[45:58] reminiscing back of their days before
[46:00] their capture verse two we hanged our
[46:02] Harps out upon the Willows in the midst
[46:05] thereof and so they're they're so
[46:07] distressed in Exile from their homelands
[46:10] so they just unstrain the harps and they
[46:12] hung them on the willow trees they just
[46:14] they just didn't feel like singing so
[46:16] there verse three for There They carried
[46:18] us away captive required of us a song
[46:22] and they and they that Wast us were of
[46:26] us mirth or rejoicing saying sing us one
[46:30] of the songs of Zion I mean now being
[46:32] wasted from the Homeland how could the
[46:35] how could the enemy require them to sing
[46:37] a joyful song and they're the one and
[46:39] took them captive they're slaved they've
[46:41] been enslaved they beat them and so
[46:45] forth and they want to sing a a song of
[46:47] rejoicing I mean that's insulting you
[46:49] might
[46:50] say verse four how shall we sing the
[46:53] Lord's song In a Strange Land deprived
[46:56] and oppressed
[46:58] how if I listen what what he says now
[47:01] verse 5 if I forget thee Old Jerusalem
[47:05] let my right hand forget her cunning in
[47:08] other words let the dearest and most
[47:11] precious thing I have that's your right
[47:12] hand that's what you do with that's what
[47:14] you work with that that's your labor
[47:16] that's your your your business
[47:17] everything said let my right hand let me
[47:20] let my let me lose all of my abilities
[47:22] if I forget Jerusalem that's what he's
[47:24] saying verse six if I do not remember
[47:27] thee let my tongue cleave to the roof of
[47:29] my mouth if I prefer not Jerusalem above
[47:33] my chief Joy now they they were
[47:35] musicians that we talked about and now
[47:37] if we forget Jerusalem let me let me
[47:40] lose my voice Let Me Lose My Melody let
[47:42] me lose my speech let me just lose
[47:44] everything because I I am enslaved away
[47:47] from my homeland now you have to
[47:49] remember brother man says God always
[47:51] deals with Israel in the Homeland when
[47:54] they get out of the Homeland God don't
[47:55] deal with Israel that's why they had
[47:57] trouble down in Egypt everywhere they've
[47:59] gone and been dispersed all over the
[48:01] world for for 2,000 years but they had
[48:04] to come back to the Homeland God blesses
[48:06] Israel in the Homeland and there's so
[48:09] many I I preached four messages down in
[48:11] Happy Valley I'd love to preach them
[48:12] here about blessings in the Homeland you
[48:15] you would be amazed of Miracles how God
[48:18] has blessed the land of Israel since
[48:20] 1948 you'd be amazed
[48:23] miraculous I may bring him in sometime
[48:26] agriculture science development medicine
[48:29] military the guy the the eighth best
[48:32] military in the world right there in
[48:33] Israel Israel's only the the size of the
[48:36] state of New Jersey how have they been
[48:39] able to do it it's been a
[48:42] miracle oh I I just love it okay
[48:44] Jerusalem oh Jerusalem the capital city
[48:48] of our faith this city of Peace why
[48:50] Jerusalem why is so Jerusalem so
[48:52] important mentioned 63 62 23 times in
[48:56] the Old Testament 623 times in the Old
[48:59] Testament even jerus mentioned 141 in
[49:01] the New Testament
[49:03] Jerusalem brother R said in the Sixth
[49:06] Seal said look there they crucified him
[49:10] the Bible said there that's the four of
[49:13] the greatest words look there Jerusalem
[49:17] the most holy city in the world they the
[49:20] most holy people in the world crucified
[49:24] the most brutal death in the world him
[49:28] the greatest and most important person
[49:30] in the world
[49:33] Jerusalem of course we know Jerusalem
[49:36] the Jewish and the Christian and the
[49:37] Muslim Roots all came from Jerusalem but
[49:40] now the main reason is so great is
[49:42] because God is Sovereign and God chose
[49:46] Jerusalem that settles it we don't have
[49:49] to know all the reasons why God chose
[49:52] Jerusalem why didn't why didn't the
[49:54] Bible say God chose Jacob so I love
[49:57] Jacob I hate Esau Cain and Abel Jacob
[50:00] Esau Isaac Ishmael all the way down
[50:02] that's God's sovereignty you don't
[50:04] question God's sovereignty I don't I
[50:07] don't even want to because he knows he
[50:09] knows best brother man said in this
[50:11] message great coming revival now listen
[50:14] close there there they are bringing them
[50:16] up out of Iran you read your papers and
[50:18] so forth this is 1954 and papers so
[50:21] forth how thousands times thousands and
[50:23] thousands have been brought from all all
[50:25] over the world by ships and PLS coming
[50:27] into Jerusalem picking up the stones off
[50:30] the deserts piling them up and all of a
[50:32] sudden all of a sudden all of that dry
[50:36] ground there there sprung up rivers that
[50:39] they know nothing about great irrigation
[50:42] has set in they developed the drip
[50:43] irrigation it's that's patented over
[50:46] there and only well it's been around the
[50:48] world but they started and it works
[50:51] simple great irrigation has set in and
[50:54] then what would happen happen all these
[50:56] other things the Jews coming in he said
[50:59] let my scripture says let my sons come
[51:01] from the East and from the west and from
[51:04] the north and from the south the prophet
[51:06] said so and in the last days it would
[51:08] take place and there they are coming in
[51:11] by coming in by shipload and plane load
[51:14] coming from all over the world different
[51:16] dialects from everywhere coming all
[51:18] together coming together there and you
[51:20] know it's really it's really interesting
[51:22] you know these different people come
[51:24] from Russia from Poland Ukraine from all
[51:27] over from Africa all places I mean the
[51:29] Jews were dispersed after 8070 when
[51:32] Titus burnt the city and for all these
[51:34] you know seven 1700 years and now they
[51:38] what what made them what made them want
[51:40] to come back to Jerusalem what made them
[51:42] go back to Jerusalem well it's two
[51:44] things first of all God did put uh
[51:47] something within their heart just like a
[51:49] it's like a some inate yearning to go
[51:53] back to Palestine but not all of them
[51:55] didn't have that God had to drive many
[51:57] of them in fact maybe most of them back
[51:59] there that's why during The Sixth Seal
[52:02] uh the fifth seal rather when brother
[52:03] when the Six Million Jews were killed
[52:05] and brother B said that was the tender
[52:07] hand of Jehovah why because the the the
[52:10] ones that survived after that and the
[52:12] ones that escaped being caught from
[52:14] Germany and Poland and different Nation
[52:17] Russia and so forth they actually God
[52:19] had to drive them back to Israel but it
[52:21] was his will it was his prophecy for
[52:23] them they have to be back in pal
[52:26] sign amen it's got to be that way
[52:28] because it's got to be that way to
[52:29] fulfill scripture because hey there's
[52:32] 144,000 is going to hear this gospel
[52:35] going to be saved during the tribulation
[52:36] period Israel has got to be still still
[52:39] got to be a nation that's got to and so
[52:42] I can't tell you what's going to happen
[52:43] as far as a result of this war between
[52:46] Hamas and Israel but I can tell you one
[52:48] thing Israel will remain how many lives
[52:51] there loose I don't know how and and and
[52:53] I'll just say it right now this is the
[52:55] beginning my opinion this is me now this
[52:57] is the beginning of if you want to call
[52:59] it a squeeze for Israel because this is
[53:01] they've had they fought five major Wars
[53:04] since 1948 we could go through all I
[53:06] won't get on to that today all
[53:08] Supernatural but this has been the
[53:10] hardest conflict they've had yet whether
[53:12] it be the Six Day War the yapor war the
[53:14] war of independence the war of attrition
[53:17] the SI campaign all of those they all
[53:20] been tough but this is the toughest
[53:21] thing yet that's right think about it
[53:26] aund over 100 I don't know what the
[53:28] figure 130 over 100, Palestinians have
[53:31] been killed no wonder and the Bible says
[53:34] all the world will turn against Israel
[53:37] all the world will turn against Israel
[53:40] this is the beginning of it hey we we're
[53:43] getting real real close Brother Sam
[53:45] we're getting real close all
[53:48] right let my Sons Sons come from the
[53:51] east west from the north and from the
[53:52] south and even even when the Great
[53:55] migration from Russia was going back to
[53:58] and Amos probably knows a lot about that
[54:01] uh it's really amazing and this is this
[54:04] is amazing 80% 80% of all those Jews
[54:08] that left Russia suppos were freed from
[54:11] Russia that should have gone to
[54:13] Palestine they came to America and they
[54:15] came to New York City and that's why
[54:17] brother M says that the the Jews hold
[54:20] the bonds in the wall and the Wall
[54:22] Street is actually controlled by the
[54:23] Jews the Catholic Church has the goal
[54:26] the Jews holds the bonds and the Jews
[54:28] always been money loving I mean they've
[54:30] been prospered they was prospered in
[54:31] Germany they prospered everywhere they
[54:33] go they've been profit God chosen people
[54:35] and they love money so they went to New
[54:37] York City and they made lots of money
[54:39] millions of dollars and they hold the
[54:41] bonds that's why they'll make a covenant
[54:43] with the Jews and the pope will at some
[54:46] point in time that's oh it's it's a
[54:48] beautiful picture when you see it yes
[54:50] sir but they should have gone to Israel
[54:52] but 80% I went to went to New York and I
[54:54] and and most of them will not will not
[54:57] go to Israel and I've got some quotes
[54:59] but we didn't bring them in today
[55:00] brother man said Them Crooked Wall
[55:01] Street juice they'll never go back there
[55:03] they're not real Jews anyway I mean
[55:04] they're Jews by
[55:06] descendants but we'll get to that in a
[55:09] minute but there's listen there only 20
[55:12] only 20% of Israel's what four or five
[55:15] millions in Israel today only 20%
[55:17] Orthodox 80% they're just they're just
[55:19] they're just Jews that's all they
[55:21] they're just Jews all right let's go on
[55:24] now this this lesson is going to help us
[55:25] understand why all the nations will turn
[55:28] against Israel and it's already
[55:32] started I want to explore this in light
[55:34] of what's happening today now remember
[55:36] Israel Israel's Journey to the promised
[55:38] land is typed our journey to our
[55:40] Promised Land I could read the quote
[55:42] don't have it today but we know that our
[55:44] Israel's journey to their Promised Land
[55:46] types ours to our promised land and as I
[55:49] said I think Israel is really enter into
[55:52] a real real time of squeeze now
[55:56] now Israel Jerusalem in 2 Kings 21
[56:00] and4 I just love these couple scriptures
[56:04] 2 Kings 21:4 is and he built altars in
[56:07] the house of the Lord of which the Lord
[56:11] said in Jerusalem will I put my name now
[56:16] that settles it for me anywhere God puts
[56:19] his name that's where I want to be now
[56:21] I'm not saying I want to be in Jerusalem
[56:22] because I'm not a Jew but anywhere God
[56:24] puts his name as you go back to De
[56:26] Deuteronomy brother man us for the
[56:28] scriptures you know uh God's chosen
[56:30] place of worship I've God said I've
[56:33] chosen a place where I'll put my name
[56:34] and only there will can you worship me
[56:36] that's you know for the Gentiles for the
[56:38] for the True Believers Daniel 6 And1 now
[56:43] when Daniel knew that he was down in
[56:44] captivity now when Daniel knew that the
[56:46] writing was signed he went into his
[56:48] house talk about he supposed to worship
[56:50] the the emperor there open his windows
[56:53] and being open his chamber toward
[56:56] Jerusalem he kneeled upon his knees
[56:58] three times a day and prayed and gave
[57:00] thanks before God as as he did before
[57:03] why did he kneel toward
[57:06] Jerusalem because since the the the
[57:09] Jewish law was since they couldn't come
[57:12] to Jerusalem and be in Jerusalem person
[57:14] that God told them to look towards
[57:16] Jerusalem and the they would have the
[57:18] same results if they look toward
[57:19] Jerusalem as if they were in Jerusalem
[57:22] right I mean look at Jonah and Jonah
[57:25] said I am cast out of thy sight yet I
[57:27] will look toward I will look again
[57:30] toward thy whole holy city in the bottom
[57:32] of the sea Jonah looks towards Jerusalem
[57:34] he knew they had a
[57:36] promise aren't you glad God has a God
[57:39] gave them an unconditional Covenant and
[57:41] we'll read that in a minute you know I
[57:43] listen I don't care what Israel does God
[57:45] still has the Covenant with them people
[57:48] you ain't gonna get away from it it's
[57:51] there all right even in 2 Chronicles 33
[57:55] and 7 again and he carved and he set a
[57:58] carved image the idol which he had made
[58:01] in the house of God now that's a paradox
[58:02] with itself because it wouldn't have
[58:04] supposed to have no graven image but
[58:05] they put the cherubims on the on top on
[58:07] top of the Ark of the Covenant The Mercy
[58:09] Seat but God there again God's Sovereign
[58:12] he does what he wants to you don't have
[58:14] to try to explain
[58:16] God and he set a carved image the idle
[58:18] which he made in the house of God of
[58:20] which God had said to David and to
[58:22] Solomon his son in this house
[58:25] and in Jerusalem which I have chosen
[58:28] before all the tribes of Israel I will
[58:31] put my name forever bless the Lord that
[58:35] settles
[58:36] that now surprisingly God's sovereignty
[58:39] many times you know it's it's missed
[58:41] it's overlooked now God chose His Bride
[58:44] that settles it we don't we don't
[58:45] question that he just chose it God chose
[58:47] Israel that settle it we don't question
[58:49] that he has a right to do it God don't
[58:50] need to take counsel with nobody God Jo
[58:53] chose Jerusalem that settles that praise
[58:56] the Lord God chose Israel that settles
[58:58] that so so all of these things okay thus
[59:00] far Jerusalem the most holy city in the
[59:02] world now remember that was in Jesus's
[59:05] day and I want you to catch the
[59:06] importance of this principle of God in
[59:09] Jerusalem I will put my name Second
[59:12] Kings second chronicles different places
[59:14] that's why I said Daniel and Jonah and
[59:16] all the Jews they look towards Jerusalem
[59:17] to pray now here's brother M says in the
[59:21] Third Exodus I want to emphasize this
[59:24] principle before we go any further
[59:26] brother man says in the the first Exodus
[59:28] what did he do he brought them from a
[59:30] natural land to a natural land going
[59:33] from Egypt into the land of Canaan
[59:35] natural to a natural now don't don't
[59:37] miss it you know this principle but I
[59:39] want you to catch it and hold on to it
[59:41] the second ex is he brought them from a
[59:43] spiritual condition to the spiritual
[59:46] spiritual baptism of Holy Ghost In other
[59:47] words from the law of Moses to Christ
[59:49] the mediator uh the the New Covenant you
[59:52] put it that way from the old law to the
[59:55] new for the new Grace and now he's
[59:58] bringing them from the spiritual baptism
[1:00:00] of the Holy Ghost right back right back
[1:00:02] I love that right back into the Eternal
[1:00:05] land of the Millennium and the great
[1:00:07] Hereafter that's why the you know when
[1:00:10] we talk about about melus talks about
[1:00:12] it's that that priesthood is the power
[1:00:14] of an endless life we're going back to
[1:00:16] Eternity The Eighth Day oh it's just
[1:00:20] beautiful that and that's why brother
[1:00:21] man said justification made because he
[1:00:23] said we're going from the baptism of the
[1:00:25] Holy Ghost to right back to the Eternal
[1:00:28] land of the Millennium that's why he
[1:00:29] said justification wait wait for
[1:00:31] sanctification sanctification made way
[1:00:33] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost he
[1:00:35] didn't stop right there the baptism of
[1:00:37] the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy
[1:00:39] Ghost himself that's why Revelations
[1:00:41] 10:1 is so important Christ himself the
[1:00:43] coveted angel came down put one foot on
[1:00:46] the land one on the sea and swore by
[1:00:48] himself that time should be no more in
[1:00:49] other words be no longer delay I'm going
[1:00:51] to reveal the book open the seals show
[1:00:54] so the bride her name's in the book and
[1:00:56] so forth and so on time shall be no more
[1:00:58] be no longer delay in other words back
[1:01:01] into the Eternal land of the Millennium
[1:01:03] we're we're at the down at the end now
[1:01:06] you don't have to you don't have I want
[1:01:08] you to keep that locked in your mind
[1:01:10] Israel's Journey was a natural
[1:01:12] journey and even all of their Wars all
[1:01:14] of their Wars the five Wars that they
[1:01:16] fought since
[1:01:17] 1948 Israel is trying to not only secure
[1:01:21] but they're trying to maintain and
[1:01:23] preserve a natural land
[1:01:24] they're not trying to necessarily I mean
[1:01:26] the like I said only 20 20% I'm Orthodox
[1:01:29] you know that and we'll get to the
[1:01:31] Temple Mount but they they God promised
[1:01:34] them that land and they want that
[1:01:36] land and they're going to keep that
[1:01:39] land that's what all the fuss is about
[1:01:42] now let me just give you just a little
[1:01:45] bit of review here now uh leaving Egypt
[1:01:48] they left Egypt 40 years in the
[1:01:50] wilderness then crossing over Jordan
[1:01:52] going into C Canan it's all natural it's
[1:01:55] a natural land natural battles yet they
[1:01:57] were won supernaturally by God but they
[1:01:59] are natural cities natural Giants
[1:02:01] everything's natural now even the most
[1:02:04] important uh thing today even Israel
[1:02:06] today you could go from it we still
[1:02:09] talking about acquiring and maintaining
[1:02:11] and preserving a natural land you can
[1:02:13] start from the Zionist movement the turn
[1:02:15] of the century you could talk about
[1:02:17] Theodore Herzel who formed the Zionist
[1:02:19] organization to promote Jewish
[1:02:20] immigration to Palestine what put it in
[1:02:22] his heart it's time that Israel has a uh
[1:02:27] a a land that they can call their own
[1:02:28] they actually well that's that's a whole
[1:02:30] another subject I'd love to get in that
[1:02:32] but we wanton today but but he started
[1:02:34] that and then from there you have a
[1:02:36] David benan who was the first Prime
[1:02:38] Minister actually he was David benur was
[1:02:41] actually B born in uh Poland or um I'm I
[1:02:46] know Goldie Myer she was born in Ukraine
[1:02:48] but I forget now where I think he was
[1:02:50] born in Russia or anyway but he he was
[1:02:53] the first uh and he he was the one who
[1:02:55] actually officially declared Israel as a
[1:02:57] nation May the 14th 1940 he made this
[1:03:01] this is his real famous statement we
[1:03:03] hereby declare the establishment of a
[1:03:05] Jewish state in the land of Israel that
[1:03:07] settles it amen gold and you could talk
[1:03:11] about Goldie Myer and and she was kind
[1:03:14] of a David Ban's a right-hand woman if
[1:03:17] you want and of course we understand you
[1:03:19] know women and so like that but you know
[1:03:21] just like Deborah she was a judge that's
[1:03:23] politics you know they don't have
[1:03:24] anything to do with the church that's
[1:03:25] politics but Goldie my ear she was a she
[1:03:28] was a great great great help for the
[1:03:30] establishment of Israel and you could
[1:03:33] talk about yach rabine and and Manakin
[1:03:36] bean and Chiron Perez and er of cherom
[1:03:38] and all the way down to Benjamin
[1:03:39] Netanyahu you realize that most most of
[1:03:42] those Prime Ministers actually they were
[1:03:45] Generals in the military and all most
[1:03:49] all of the prime ministers had in fact
[1:03:51] all of them had military service except
[1:03:52] for Goldie my ear they had had military
[1:03:54] even the women have to spend two years
[1:03:56] in the military the the men have to
[1:03:58] spend three years the women two years
[1:04:00] and everybody
[1:04:02] mandatory and then they're on call for
[1:04:04] until they're 39 or 40 years old they
[1:04:07] have to be that way because if anybody
[1:04:09] evades Israel they're such a small land
[1:04:11] they have a relatively small army
[1:04:12] they've got to call up all the observers
[1:04:14] and that's the one way only way they can
[1:04:16] fight yes sir okay so so they all
[1:04:20] focused on acquiring development and
[1:04:21] preserving that land all of these
[1:04:23] leaders and so forth now what's worse I
[1:04:26] mean like I said this is hard to accept
[1:04:29] but God has a covenant with Israel even
[1:04:31] though Israel has disobeyed God they
[1:04:33] have they they not Believers in Christ
[1:04:36] we know that but they were blinded for
[1:04:37] that but you look at even the city of
[1:04:39] Tel Aviv Tel Aviv Tel Aviv actually is
[1:04:41] considered by the world is actually the
[1:04:44] homosexual capital of the Middle East
[1:04:47] that's horrible homosexual capital of
[1:04:49] the Middle East but you know what God
[1:04:51] still has a covenant with the nation
[1:04:54] nation of Israel yet that he still has
[1:04:58] that Covenant and God Honors that
[1:05:00] Covenant and God will not resin and he
[1:05:02] cannot resend that Covenant because it's
[1:05:04] an everlasting Covenant now but the
[1:05:07] bride she's altogether a spirit church
[1:05:09] you know she has a spiritual rebirth
[1:05:10] she's going to spiritual land all the
[1:05:12] spiritual Focus now having said those
[1:05:15] things Israel she going from a natural
[1:05:17] land to a natural land Brides going from
[1:05:19] spiritual baptism Holy Ghost into the
[1:05:21] Eternal land of Millennium we we we came
[1:05:23] from for getet that that important
[1:05:25] principle now brother R says in the
[1:05:27] token he said now it's a type today
[1:05:30] shown us we are also facing another exus
[1:05:32] God bringing Israel out of Egypt to the
[1:05:35] promised land was a type of Christ
[1:05:37] bringing the bride out of the church to
[1:05:39] the promised land we're in another exus
[1:05:42] just to showing you know that the
[1:05:43] natural types of spiritual their natural
[1:05:46] uh exus was uh same thing us go in our
[1:05:48] Promised Land he also says now the type
[1:05:50] here in another message there's a
[1:05:53] wonderful type that we sure don't want
[1:05:54] to miss see type God was bringing Israel
[1:05:57] his people out of a Nation a nation out
[1:06:00] of a Nation a nation out of a Nation a
[1:06:02] beautiful type today that God is calling
[1:06:04] a bride out of a church a Christian
[1:06:06] bride out of a Christian Church a bride
[1:06:08] out of a church which is called in the
[1:06:11] Bible and referred to aren't you
[1:06:13] thankful for Revelations 18:4 come out
[1:06:15] of her my people amen 2 Corinthians 617
[1:06:18] and be and I forget how it goes but it
[1:06:20] said be not Protectors of sins that you
[1:06:22] receive not of her plagues come out come
[1:06:24] out thank God he called us
[1:06:27] out now here's here's getting into a
[1:06:30] little stickler now God there's two
[1:06:33] groups of people that God chose Israel
[1:06:36] the bride you just argue that with God
[1:06:38] that's just the way that's just his
[1:06:39] sovereignty of all the nations of all
[1:06:42] the peoples on the earth he chose Israel
[1:06:44] and he chose his bride it's just the way
[1:06:47] it is I didn't write the Bible I just
[1:06:48] say what it saids now of all the nations
[1:06:50] of peoples two groups now the next
[1:06:52] question is if he chose Israel who is
[1:06:55] Israel good question brother man says in
[1:06:58] Israel and the church and this is really
[1:07:00] interesting he said you say oh you've
[1:07:03] heard him say oh all the Jews are God's
[1:07:06] people all the all the Jews are God's
[1:07:09] chosen people all brother Ben said
[1:07:12] that's not right that's not right no
[1:07:15] then he goes on to say the Jews are not
[1:07:17] go I'm sorry the Jews are not God's
[1:07:19] chosen people he's he's referring back
[1:07:21] to his first statement all the Jews are
[1:07:23] not God's chosen people people see they
[1:07:25] aren't no you listen see if Paul didn't
[1:07:28] say the same thing and he was a Jew see
[1:07:30] Abraham had 11 Sons you know that didn't
[1:07:34] you and they were all the Seed of
[1:07:35] Abraham they were all the Seed of
[1:07:38] Abraham but in Isaac thy seed Shall be
[1:07:41] Called not in the rest of
[1:07:44] them not in the rest of them not in ish
[1:07:49] hold that not in ishel not in the other
[1:07:52] nine Sons or the the other the third
[1:07:54] wife he had no it was in Isaac was the
[1:07:58] seed called in Isaac and Isaac
[1:08:03] alone not his other Sons not in Ishmael
[1:08:07] and Isaac
[1:08:09] alone now this Covenant we know Israel
[1:08:12] is a covenant people this Covenant he
[1:08:13] says brother says KES Baria this message
[1:08:16] this Covenant Israel down in Egypt on
[1:08:20] account of Disobedience of selling their
[1:08:22] brother Joseph remember there the 11
[1:08:25] brothers or 10 Brothers actually sold uh
[1:08:27] Joseph down to Egypt Benjamin hadn't
[1:08:29] been born yet uh well somewhere along at
[1:08:32] that time anyway Joseph never did get to
[1:08:34] see Benjamin so they sold their brother
[1:08:37] Joseph down to Egypt but we know why to
[1:08:38] preserve life but he said now and and
[1:08:41] was taken down into Egypt and was there
[1:08:44] 400 years under bondage actually they
[1:08:46] were there 430 years but 400 years under
[1:08:48] bondage he said I want you to notice
[1:08:51] they never lost their Covenant they only
[1:08:53] only lost their freedom not their
[1:08:57] Covenant they were down there 400 years
[1:09:01] they didn't lose their Covenant they
[1:09:03] just lost their
[1:09:04] freedom amen when God made the Covenant
[1:09:07] with Abraham Isaac and Ja Jacob that he
[1:09:10] swore by himself that he would save
[1:09:12] Abraham and his seed after him God's
[1:09:15] Duty bound to keep that promise to keep
[1:09:18] that Covenant amen God Amen oh man when
[1:09:24] you think about the the sovereignty of
[1:09:26] God how great God is God's promises are
[1:09:29] yay and amen whatever he said that's the
[1:09:31] way it's going to be I don't care how
[1:09:33] long it takes it's going to be that
[1:09:36] wayen now we know that the Covenant came
[1:09:38] through
[1:09:39] Isaac but Isaac had a half
[1:09:43] brother an older brother a firstborn
[1:09:46] brother Ishmael that's right look I want
[1:09:49] you to notice in a minute what brother
[1:09:50] says about
[1:09:52] Ishmael ishma was born through Hagar
[1:09:55] remember Ishmael was Abraham's son right
[1:09:59] Abra he was Abraham's son not through
[1:10:02] Sarah but through Hagar but he was
[1:10:03] Abraham's
[1:10:04] son you think you can even go back now
[1:10:07] what what was the what was the benefit
[1:10:09] of the firstborn son back in the Jewish
[1:10:11] time he he was he he had the birthright
[1:10:14] he usually got a double portion of the
[1:10:16] inheritance and on and on and on but see
[1:10:19] you still have even though ishma was
[1:10:21] born first that was not the promise
[1:10:25] amen Israel ishel we say now why did God
[1:10:29] permit a son to be born through this
[1:10:31] Bond's woman well the same reason like
[1:10:34] for Jacob and Esau Isaac and ishmail the
[1:10:36] church and the bride has to be this law
[1:10:38] of contrast and the brother said the
[1:10:41] seed shall not be air with the shook it
[1:10:42] had to be this law of contrast God had
[1:10:44] to permit that Cain and abble all the
[1:10:46] way down Judas and Jesus all the way
[1:10:48] down there had to be that law of
[1:10:49] contrast so God permitted it now we know
[1:10:52] all we know that the Arabs and The
[1:10:55] Descendant the Arabs are the descendants
[1:10:57] of Ishmael and even historians generally
[1:10:59] believe that that some of them descended
[1:11:01] from lot and some from Esau but we know
[1:11:03] they came from is Ishmael now in the
[1:11:06] Hebrew series brother Bown says this oh
[1:11:10] and this is this is beginning to we
[1:11:13] understand why now but God keeps his
[1:11:15] promise no matter how unreasonable it
[1:11:18] may seem God is obligated to his promise
[1:11:22] and Sarah thought that maybe she could
[1:11:24] have uh Hannah said but Hagar rather her
[1:11:27] maid to give birth to a baby through
[1:11:30] Abraham and she and he and she would
[1:11:32] take it and that would be and that
[1:11:34] became ishmail wh listen what he says
[1:11:37] that would be ishma which was a thorn in
[1:11:40] the flesh from then until now
[1:11:44] W that's a that's an understatement
[1:11:47] that's an understatement he said that
[1:11:49] was she would have ishma which was a
[1:11:52] thorn in the flesh from there to now
[1:11:54] steal a thorn in the flesh for out of
[1:11:56] there come the Arabs and they've always
[1:11:59] been that
[1:12:00] way there it is bottom line okay now
[1:12:03] we're beginning to get a little bit
[1:12:05] better picture here we got Isaac we got
[1:12:08] ishma we got Jewish people we got the uh
[1:12:11] uh the the sons of which are lot you
[1:12:14] know they're the the Palestinians and
[1:12:17] the Arabs and different lots of
[1:12:18] different sects of the Palestinians and
[1:12:20] Arab so for but they they're come from
[1:12:22] the sons of Israel Esau lot they're not
[1:12:25] from Sarah so we know that so watch this
[1:12:29] now God gave Canan to Abraham in Genesis
[1:12:31] 12 Abraham Isaac Jacob had 12 sons
[1:12:34] famine Joseph sold in Egypt 430 years
[1:12:37] later the first Exodus 40 years in
[1:12:39] wildness and then there during that 430
[1:12:41] years those Seven Nations would which
[1:12:43] inhabited Canaan they developed that
[1:12:45] land I I just love that during that 400
[1:12:48] years while uh the the was 80 Souls that
[1:12:51] went down Jacob and his family went down
[1:12:53] to Egypt and stay there and come out
[1:12:55] with 2 and a half million but during
[1:12:57] that 400 years you know you had the
[1:12:59] Seven Nations the Canaanites and
[1:13:00] jebusites and pites and all the
[1:13:02] different nations there they came they
[1:13:04] actually inhabited Canaan and God just
[1:13:06] permitted them you know to build cities
[1:13:08] and to build houses and to build walls
[1:13:11] and yeah they had Giants and had this
[1:13:13] that and the other but they cultivated
[1:13:14] the land they farmed the land started
[1:13:16] growing Vineyards this that other so now
[1:13:18] after 400 years God said okay the land's
[1:13:20] flowing milk and honey I got it prepared
[1:13:22] for you go take it
[1:13:24] brother man said God had them God had
[1:13:26] them oh Wicked Nations prepare Canaan
[1:13:28] for the Israelites to come in and take
[1:13:30] the lamb yeah that's right and then then
[1:13:32] you have a CES Bara two years after
[1:13:35] leaving Egypt KES Bara then they come
[1:13:37] they send out the the uh the 12 Spies
[1:13:40] and if and I preached the message on
[1:13:41] that if you want to if you want to
[1:13:42] really know the the real significance
[1:13:44] behind that who was the ones that
[1:13:46] actually ordered the spy mission God
[1:13:49] really didn't order although God the
[1:13:51] children of Israel said we we will send
[1:13:52] out men and we will go spy out the land
[1:13:55] to see whether or not we can take the
[1:13:56] land now God said okay if that's what
[1:13:58] you want go ahead and do it I'll I'll
[1:14:00] I'll sanction okay but the people is the
[1:14:02] ones that requested the spy mission God
[1:14:05] God God didn't need a spy mission he
[1:14:07] knew what the land was but the people
[1:14:09] wasn't sure and they wanted to know so
[1:14:11] the 10 spies come back with a bad report
[1:14:13] we can't take the land we got Giants we
[1:14:14] got wall cities we got this that and the
[1:14:16] other we can't take the land and because
[1:14:17] of that two million people died because
[1:14:19] of the testimony of 10 spies that's
[1:14:22] right false preachers if you will they
[1:14:25] died perished in the wilderness
[1:14:27] eternally separated only Joshua and
[1:14:29] Caleb saved out of that all those that
[1:14:31] was over 20 years old think about
[1:14:35] that it's good you got to make sure you
[1:14:38] you listen to the right
[1:14:40] report amen so they actually they they
[1:14:44] prepared that land and Israel crosses
[1:14:46] Jordan they take the lamb now the
[1:14:48] several hundred years and then you got
[1:14:49] the judges the Kings and Prophets and
[1:14:51] the Messiah comes un Israel then he he's
[1:14:53] rejected then you have the early
[1:14:54] Christian Church is birth now notice
[1:14:57] notice
[1:14:58] all I want you to notice a little bit
[1:15:00] now as we see all the people actually
[1:15:02] had control of Jerusalem so we're going
[1:15:04] to pick it up in the New Testament I
[1:15:05] mean there's been a lots of people there
[1:15:07] lots of people had laid claim on
[1:15:09] Jerusalem we want it we're going to take
[1:15:12] it we're going to inhabit it we're going
[1:15:13] to develop it we're going to keep it we
[1:15:15] know that uh Rome had it and a lot of a
[1:15:18] lot of countries had it before them and
[1:15:20] Titus destroyed it in ad70 and and
[1:15:22] killed
[1:15:23] M many of the Jews and dispersed all the
[1:15:25] Jews Josephus said there was 1.1 million
[1:15:28] Jews killed in ad70 and 97,000 would be
[1:15:31] enslaved and caused a mass dispersion to
[1:15:34] all parts of the world there they go all
[1:15:36] over the world Russia everywhere because
[1:15:39] of what they did in uh ad70 by
[1:15:42] Titus now notice
[1:15:45] quickly all the a lot of people who
[1:15:48] actually we want to call it owned
[1:15:50] Jerusalem for 2,000 years you had the
[1:15:52] Romans you had to you don't have to
[1:15:54] remember any of this you had pames the
[1:15:57] cusd which were the successors of
[1:15:59] Alexander the Great the branes the Arabs
[1:16:02] the Crusaders then the Ottoman Empire
[1:16:04] then the British hold held it from 1917
[1:16:07] to
[1:16:07] 1948 and during this time there's
[1:16:10] there's been a a great dormant Islamic
[1:16:13] culture for almost 12 centuries that's
[1:16:15] that's why that's why Islam and the and
[1:16:20] which the jordanians of partam and
[1:16:22] Islamic and all and and Egyptians and
[1:16:24] all these surrounding countries are all
[1:16:27] Arab Islamic most Islamic faith and they
[1:16:31] they they dominated Jerusalem for almost
[1:16:33] 12 centuries that's why they think
[1:16:35] that's their
[1:16:37] land because said we we held it for the
[1:16:39] longest period of
[1:16:41] time but it wasn't their land actually
[1:16:44] they were squatters on the land but they
[1:16:46] say it's their
[1:16:48] land so you can see why there's a fuss
[1:16:51] in
[1:16:52] Israel
[1:16:54] oh all the cities of the world Jerusalem
[1:16:55] is the one that's the most sought after
[1:16:57] the most fought after the most battled
[1:16:59] over most disputed over and there's a
[1:17:02] real reason listen to now listen to
[1:17:06] this Gable's instruction to Daniels for
[1:17:09] nearly 2,000 years the Jews have been
[1:17:11] out of their Homeland scattered to the
[1:17:13] Four Winds of the Earth how that we
[1:17:15] could make this message last for weeks
[1:17:17] now we could go into detail we can chase
[1:17:20] Israel right back and show when it was
[1:17:22] scattered by the Roman Empire on their
[1:17:24] rejecting of the Messiah see what they
[1:17:26] did they rejected Messiah but God pro
[1:17:28] God blinded them yet but then they still
[1:17:32] rejected Messiah but God blind them so
[1:17:34] the Gentiles could have a way
[1:17:36] in oh dear God how she was drove to
[1:17:40] every nation under Heaven go back to
[1:17:42] Jacob Israel back to Genesis 44 and 45
[1:17:44] and show back there how he blessed those
[1:17:47] Patriarchs and told them exactly where
[1:17:49] their standing would be in the last days
[1:17:50] he said I can point you exactly every
[1:17:53] nation of Israel every tribe of Israel
[1:17:54] stand exactly in the nation where it
[1:17:56] said that they would be and there they
[1:17:57] are today he goes on to say in also in
[1:18:00] that same message the Jews that we know
[1:18:02] now that's not the real Jew the real Jew
[1:18:05] that Jew Orthodox that has not defiled
[1:18:07] himself with the things of the world
[1:18:09] who's not went out and joined other
[1:18:11] churches and he's just kind of
[1:18:12] symbolized here joined other churches
[1:18:14] that's the ones that's returning Yonder
[1:18:16] living on cheese and bread upon the
[1:18:19] hillsides and he says they're not
[1:18:20] allowed in the Old City now hold that
[1:18:23] they're not allowed hold that they're
[1:18:25] they're not allowed in the old city now
[1:18:26] this was preached in
[1:18:28] 1961 not allowed in the old city had to
[1:18:31] build them a city on this side in no
[1:18:33] man's land with machine guns pointing
[1:18:35] both ways but he's beginning to put
[1:18:37] forth her buds amen see the 's at hand
[1:18:40] another quote he says in same message
[1:18:43] there's Ishmael and Isaac there's a
[1:18:45] Palestinian and the Jews Ishmael and
[1:18:48] Isaac standing there fussing about this
[1:18:50] land that's what the prophet of God said
[1:18:53] ishel and Isaac they're they're there
[1:18:54] today they're fussing about that land
[1:18:57] but yet she belongs
[1:18:59] to
[1:19:01] Israel if you happen to brother man says
[1:19:04] 61 if you happen to go over to Jerusalem
[1:19:06] they won't let you go into Old Jerusalem
[1:19:09] no you have to go first and let them
[1:19:10] explain it all to you the Arabs and then
[1:19:12] they take you over to the other side
[1:19:14] that's ishmael's children that's
[1:19:17] ishmael's children but wait there's
[1:19:19] coming a time when God's going to take
[1:19:20] it
[1:19:21] over
[1:19:23] amen they they won't let him into Old
[1:19:25] Jerusalem why would why wouldn't they
[1:19:27] let them to the old Jerusalem now here
[1:19:29] we want to get to not allowed in Old
[1:19:32] Jerusalem now and then I'm going to show
[1:19:35] you why a lot of you know this but maybe
[1:19:37] you don't know really really really
[1:19:39] really
[1:19:40] why the British controlled Jerusalem
[1:19:42] from 1917 to 1948 Israel declared
[1:19:45] dependence in 1940 then the Jews for the
[1:19:48] first time in 2,000 years uh are now
[1:19:51] have control of Jerusalem M somewhat
[1:19:53] that's 1948 somewhat at the turn of the
[1:19:57] century there was about 19,000 Jews
[1:19:59] living in the old city of Jerusalem and
[1:20:01] by the evening of May evening of May the
[1:20:04] 14 1948 there was
[1:20:06] none because see the the Muslims they
[1:20:10] drove them out killed them drove them
[1:20:11] out so forth uh even the jordanians they
[1:20:14] took over and the Brit had the British
[1:20:16] control and so forth and then they said
[1:20:18] you ain't ain't none of you Jews is
[1:20:19] coming into the old city we forbid it
[1:20:22] why
[1:20:23] so 1949 Jerusalem was divided under
[1:20:26] Jordanian rule which is Muslim is
[1:20:28] control Israel control the western part
[1:20:31] of Jerusalem the Jordanian Arabs control
[1:20:34] the eastern part of Jerusalem and here's
[1:20:36] the thing here's why they're all
[1:20:37] fighting and fussing about it the Temple
[1:20:40] Mount let's get to that the Temple Mount
[1:20:42] is 35 Acres on a hill a Rocky Hill
[1:20:46] that's where the Dome of the Rock is the
[1:20:48] Western Wall and the mosque of Omar in
[1:20:50] that 35 acre in encampment you want to
[1:20:53] say no Jews were allowed in the Temple
[1:20:56] mount in at that
[1:20:59] time that's why brother B said no Jews
[1:21:02] could go uh to the Western to the
[1:21:04] western part because the Muslims
[1:21:06] controlled it under Jordanian Rule and
[1:21:08] they wouldn't let him in the old city
[1:21:09] where the Moss was and so forth not
[1:21:12] allowed in the old city but he preached
[1:21:14] that 1961 but however remember June of
[1:21:18] 1967 five five years later was a Six Day
[1:21:21] War and that's when the Great for
[1:21:23] Jerusalem and Israel took the city of
[1:21:25] Jerusalem back over and now they control
[1:21:27] Jerusalem right that's right except
[1:21:30] for that 35 Acres which the Muslims
[1:21:34] still control what what it was the great
[1:21:37] battle for Jerusalem they fought it and
[1:21:39] they won it Israel gained control of the
[1:21:40] Temple Mount but only controls the
[1:21:43] security around the Temple Mount but
[1:21:46] Islamic what they call it wa core War
[1:21:49] governs the inside you can't go in there
[1:21:52] they won't let Israel Christians nobody
[1:21:54] go inside there only Muslims but they
[1:21:57] did compromise a little bit the Muslims
[1:21:58] and allow the Jews to to and the
[1:22:00] Christian to visit the Western Wall but
[1:22:02] that and that's just on one corner of it
[1:22:03] that's as far as they can
[1:22:05] go they can't go into the I say the
[1:22:08] mosque or any of that area there so but
[1:22:10] the Islamic conquest in the Middle East
[1:22:12] you know for the seventh century
[1:22:14] Palestine remained under Muslim control
[1:22:16] for just under 12 centuries and listen
[1:22:18] here here's a kind of a a thorn in the
[1:22:21] flesh look what they did out of
[1:22:23] so they they the the Muslims really the
[1:22:26] Islamic faith really under Muhammad so
[1:22:29] forth they they controlled Jerusalem for
[1:22:31] almost 12 centuries and in 691 that's
[1:22:34] when they built the mosque of Omar and
[1:22:36] why why did they build the mosque of
[1:22:38] Omar in Jerusalem and why did they build
[1:22:40] it on the exact spot where this second
[1:22:45] temple was built and Herod burned the
[1:22:47] city in Jerusalem on the exact spot the
[1:22:50] D of why did they build that MO mosque
[1:22:53] right on the spot where the Jewish
[1:22:55] temple was they build obvious wonder
[1:22:58] they build after spot because they want
[1:22:59] to lay claims on that city of Jerusalem
[1:23:01] so we're going to lay claims on we we we
[1:23:03] we control it now we're going to lay
[1:23:05] claims over we build our great big
[1:23:07] Shrine there and thus it's been for
[1:23:10] 15600 years and there she stands today
[1:23:13] but I'm going to tell you one thing
[1:23:14] brother said one day that mosque will be
[1:23:17] dust one day that mosque will be
[1:23:21] dust but it's not yet so right on the
[1:23:24] actual Temple site they built that uh
[1:23:28] they built their their Moss right there
[1:23:30] where the temple was where Titus burned
[1:23:32] it down okay go a little farther here
[1:23:34] and we now the Arabs purposely put that
[1:23:37] Moss right on the literal spot to stake
[1:23:40] out their claim and the right to the
[1:23:42] rock of the MOs that's where they built
[1:23:43] it that's why the Muslims are so
[1:23:45] determined to keep it they want it
[1:23:47] they're determined to keep
[1:23:49] it and that's why they want a two-state
[1:23:51] government and Israel said they ain't
[1:23:53] going to have nothing to do with it we
[1:23:55] ain't going to do a two-state but the
[1:23:56] Muslim they want a two-state government
[1:23:58] now you got to you got you got to
[1:24:00] understand look from the from the Muslim
[1:24:02] perspective okay they held it for all
[1:24:04] these years about 12 centuries Here
[1:24:05] Comes Israel come in they feel like okay
[1:24:07] it's our Israel is our homeland they
[1:24:09] come in and and uh well I don't want to
[1:24:13] get ahead of myself but they said we we
[1:24:15] own the land we're not going to let you
[1:24:16] have it well okay David B yurian says
[1:24:18] and we'll get that in a minute he says
[1:24:20] okay we're going to declare independence
[1:24:21] so he declares indep depence and guess
[1:24:23] what the very next day after he declares
[1:24:25] independence then you have Egypt and
[1:24:27] Jordan and Syria they declare war on
[1:24:29] Israel then you have the start of the
[1:24:30] war of independence that went on for
[1:24:32] nine
[1:24:33] months then finally they did an armers
[1:24:35] treatment like that said well we're just
[1:24:36] tired of fighting so just you know let
[1:24:38] them have it so so that that's where it
[1:24:40] stands but they are determined to keep
[1:24:43] that land why because their mosque is
[1:24:46] there and that's the third most holy
[1:24:47] place to the Muslim faith anyway besides
[1:24:50] Mecca and that other place now
[1:24:54] listen what let's let's see what does
[1:24:55] the Bible say about the Dome of the Rock
[1:24:58] what does the Bible say about the mosque
[1:24:59] what does the Bible say about that's
[1:25:01] remember that is a very very sacred spot
[1:25:04] where the temple was the Holy Place God
[1:25:07] God put his name right there for the
[1:25:09] Jews Daniel says
[1:25:11] 11:31 and arms and arms shall stand on
[1:25:15] his part they shall pollute the
[1:25:17] sanctuary of strength and shall take
[1:25:20] away the daily sacrifice and they shall
[1:25:22] place the Abomination that maketh
[1:25:25] desolate okay Daniel's given a prophecy
[1:25:28] of the mosque of Omar that he build okay
[1:25:31] I wonder what Jesus said about it in
[1:25:34] Mark
[1:25:35] 13:14 Jesus said and when you shall see
[1:25:38] the abomination of desolation spoken of
[1:25:41] by Daniel the Prophet standing where it
[1:25:44] ought not even Jesus said it said is
[1:25:47] standing where it ought not amen that's
[1:25:50] what Jesus said so there in that that
[1:25:52] gives us which we don't need it but that
[1:25:54] gives us more uh credibility but we
[1:25:57] don't need that but Jesus said that
[1:25:59] thing should not be there that's why
[1:26:01] they call it Abomination that make it
[1:26:04] desolation standing where it ought not
[1:26:06] let him that readeth understand then let
[1:26:08] them be a Judean Fleet of the mountains
[1:26:10] and so forth we know the prophecy but
[1:26:11] Jesus said shouldn't be there but he put
[1:26:14] it on the literal spot okay what did
[1:26:16] Brother Ram say about it let's see what
[1:26:18] he said brother Ram says in the 10
[1:26:20] virgins he said and the mosum of Omar
[1:26:23] talking about the mosque of Omar was
[1:26:25] erected where the temple stood and Jesus
[1:26:28] spoke of that in Matthew 24 he said when
[1:26:30] you see the Abomination that make it
[1:26:32] desolation standing in the Holy place
[1:26:35] where the Prophet Daniel spoke said
[1:26:37] about it then in prining said he that
[1:26:40] readeth let him understand see when you
[1:26:42] see this Abomination the filthiness the
[1:26:46] filthiness the filthiness of the mo
[1:26:48] Mosque of Omar standing there where the
[1:26:50] holy Place once stood and today the
[1:26:54] Muslim stand the Muslim stands there
[1:26:56] exactly where the holy place right on
[1:26:59] the temple s the Mohammad Muslim stand
[1:27:03] as Jesus said it would be there Daniel
[1:27:05] said it would be there and Jesus
[1:27:06] verified that it would be so and Jesus
[1:27:08] said it shouldn't be
[1:27:11] there what a rebuke what a rebuke to
[1:27:15] Israel you look up and you see that
[1:27:17] golden dome every time you see a p
[1:27:19] picture of jerus all you see is the
[1:27:20] golden dome the golden dome the golden
[1:27:22] it stands out above everything that's a
[1:27:25] that's that's their rebuke to Israel
[1:27:27] saying We believe We own this land
[1:27:31] they're the sons of
[1:27:32] ishel where did who did he give the land
[1:27:34] to Sons of Isaac so why do they
[1:27:38] fussing Israel Jerusalem Jerusalem
[1:27:42] Jerusalem
[1:27:44] Jerusalem right on a place on the temple
[1:27:46] site the Muslim the Muhammad Muslim
[1:27:48] stands right there Jesus said it would
[1:27:50] Daniel said it would and Jesus ver fight
[1:27:52] it to be so what as I said what a rebuke
[1:27:55] to Israel and to God God gave the land
[1:27:57] to Israel Rome killed them and dispersed
[1:27:59] them and the Muslim built their Moss
[1:28:01] there in in the sixth Century on the
[1:28:03] temple side they want to lay claims on
[1:28:05] the land now let's kind of try to wind
[1:28:09] this down and bring
[1:28:11] together Jerusalem was made the capital
[1:28:13] Jew Jerusalem let's look at it I'm
[1:28:14] goingon to read this right quickly why
[1:28:16] is J there so many reasons so many
[1:28:18] reasons why Jerusalem is so important
[1:28:21] Jerusalem was made the capital by King
[1:28:24] David Jerusalem was the place where
[1:28:26] Solomon built the first temple Jerusalem
[1:28:28] was the place where the Jews returning
[1:28:30] from Babylon to built the second temple
[1:28:32] Jerusalem was a place of the life and
[1:28:34] the ministry of Christ Jerusalem is the
[1:28:36] second place where the Third Temple we
[1:28:38] built in the Millennium we understand
[1:28:39] that the Temple Mount is where the
[1:28:41] Muslim believe that the prophet Muhammad
[1:28:43] ascended un Heaven that's that's one
[1:28:45] reason the Muslim think that the temple
[1:28:47] side is so sacred to them they believe
[1:28:49] that Muhammad descended from the temple
[1:28:51] s side or where mosque is buillt that's
[1:28:53] where they say he had sended
[1:28:55] no they believe that yeah it's a lie and
[1:28:58] you know something else I read the other
[1:29:00] day I never did know that you know why
[1:29:02] they put a white horse out waiting for
[1:29:03] Muhammad to come
[1:29:04] back I didn't know this either they
[1:29:07] believed Muhammad had Muhammad Muhammad
[1:29:10] had a dream and I don't remember all the
[1:29:12] details of the dream but in the dream
[1:29:13] somehow he he flew on a white Force to
[1:29:16] the temp to the MOs to the side of the
[1:29:18] Temple Mount and there he ascended up to
[1:29:20] heaven he had a dream and he flew on a
[1:29:21] white he flew on a white
[1:29:24] horse now why they going to bring a
[1:29:26] white horse I he ain't got no wings but
[1:29:28] you know they going to set a white horse
[1:29:30] there but that's what they said Muhammad
[1:29:31] had a dream he F he got there on a white
[1:29:33] horse he flew there I guess he was
[1:29:35] trying to impersonate Christ who comes
[1:29:37] on a white horse you know whatever
[1:29:39] anyway Jerusalem has been the capital of
[1:29:42] Israel since the state was reestablished
[1:29:44] in 1948 Jerusalem will be the capital
[1:29:46] city of the world during the Millennium
[1:29:49] Jerusalem was the only city on Earth
[1:29:51] would God plac his name Second Kings and
[1:29:53] 2 Chronicles look the Ark of the
[1:29:55] Covenant was transferred and the temple
[1:29:56] was built there thus Jerusalem became
[1:29:59] Jehovah's figurative residence if you
[1:30:01] want to call it that Jerusalem was also
[1:30:03] called The Throne of Jehovah the Bible
[1:30:05] says all men ought to Worship in
[1:30:07] Jerusalem that's for the Jews the
[1:30:08] greatest place of worship that was in
[1:30:10] the time uh and was the city of the
[1:30:13] central place in the city of worship
[1:30:15] okay since God gave Canaan Israel to
[1:30:18] Jerusalem to Abraham and so for Isaac
[1:30:21] and and Jacob and so forth and David
[1:30:23] made a cupet at the capital system and
[1:30:25] Jerusalem was the life and Ministry of
[1:30:27] Christ and on down and on down and on
[1:30:29] down and David benan and listen I I read
[1:30:32] this the other day I just got to tell
[1:30:33] you David benan I'm close a few minutes
[1:30:35] David benan he was really the
[1:30:37] instrumental one to really to try to get
[1:30:41] Israel to P partition that so that they
[1:30:43] could be a state and as I said British
[1:30:45] owned it and and finally they the
[1:30:49] British said well we we can sell you
[1:30:51] some land and we're going to give you
[1:30:52] some land and you gone and so well and
[1:30:55] and there's a lot in that but they okay
[1:30:56] if that's the best we can do we'll take
[1:30:58] that but uh the the others the other
[1:31:01] Jewish people and leaders said no we're
[1:31:04] g we're we're not going to say that we
[1:31:05] got to go back to Palestine but they
[1:31:07] they couldn't but the British wouldn't
[1:31:09] let him go back to Palestine because
[1:31:10] they had rule there and David be just
[1:31:14] trying to plead with him finally the the
[1:31:16] British Parliament David beg he finally
[1:31:19] had a a meeting and he was talking with
[1:31:20] all the leaders of the British
[1:31:21] Parliament and he and and finally the
[1:31:24] speaker at the end of the meeting he
[1:31:25] says to David he said sir he said you
[1:31:29] think that Israel is your land you think
[1:31:31] you have a right to this land you want
[1:31:33] to take this land you want to declare
[1:31:35] independence he said do you have any
[1:31:38] document that were that that you can
[1:31:41] hold that gives you any uh right to to
[1:31:46] take Israel as your land David bid gear
[1:31:49] he just sat there for a minute he picked
[1:31:51] up his old Old Testament Bible he says
[1:31:53] this is my
[1:31:55] document this is my document God gave

[1:34:31] just one of the that's just one that's
[1:34:33] just the start of this whole scenario
[1:34:35] how they want it supernaturally God
[1:34:38] opened up a door God opened up a door oh
[1:34:43] I'm just thankful for that okay now
[1:34:46] through all that let's hear the
[1:34:47] conclusion of the matter here's the
[1:34:50] conclusion of the matter
[1:34:52] Genesis 17-8 God speak un Abraham and I
[1:34:56] will give unto thee and to thy seed
[1:34:58] after thee the land wherein thou art a
[1:35:01] stranger all the land of Canaan for
[1:35:04] Everlasting possession and I will be
[1:35:07] their God there's a summation I don't
[1:35:10] care if you're talking about the Gaza
[1:35:11] Strip Golan Heights the West Bank now
[1:35:15] they're still fighting on portions of
[1:35:16] Israel still fighting about it you know
[1:35:18] but he said I'm going to give you all
[1:35:19] the land from Riv your euph frees to the
[1:35:22] Mediterranean all the way down God's
[1:35:24] it's all in there he specified what they
[1:35:27] have it's going to be their land it's
[1:35:28] their land God gave a right to that land
[1:35:30] and they're still fussing and fighting
[1:35:32] over part of
[1:35:33] it but you can see but you can see why
[1:35:36] and we could take another whole message
[1:35:38] to show why how many time how many times
[1:35:41] the the Arab people and we love all
[1:35:43] people but how many times they they they
[1:35:47] uh killed and they sh how many how many
[1:35:49] thousands and thousands of Rock Pockets
[1:35:51] even it was shot from Gaza if they if if
[1:35:54] if Israel did not have the Iron Dome
[1:35:56] system there would been thousands and
[1:35:58] thousands of isra Israelis killed but
[1:36:01] they have about a 90% kill rate of when
[1:36:04] they when they would send a missile up
[1:36:05] the Iron Dome would send another missile
[1:36:06] up explodeed mid air no damage but each
[1:36:09] one of them missiles cost $45,000 that
[1:36:12] Israel has to send up in the Iron Dome
[1:36:13] and they send up hundreds of them
[1:36:15] thousands of them you know who developed
[1:36:18] the iron D system collaboration with the
[1:36:21] United States and Israel thank God for
[1:36:24] the United States helping them again
[1:36:27] amen does the Bible say whoever blesses
[1:36:30] Israel will be blessed whoever curses
[1:36:33] Israel will be cursed I don't have the
[1:36:34] quotes when I show you he said look at
[1:36:37] them over there that this government is
[1:36:38] trying to hook up with the Arabs he said
[1:36:40] don't they know what the Bible said says
[1:36:42] about whoever blesses Israel blessed who
[1:36:44] curses be cursed he said when the when
[1:36:46] we turn our nation against Israel we're
[1:36:47] gone where we the nation our nation's
[1:36:50] gone anyway we know that but when they
[1:36:51] turn against Israel she's
[1:36:55] finished another quote I'm another
[1:36:58] scripture rather God said Sarah thy wife
[1:37:00] shall bear thee a son indeed and thou
[1:37:02] shalt call his name Isaac I will
[1:37:04] establish my Covenant with him for as
[1:37:07] Everlasting Covenant and with his seed
[1:37:08] after him how long is the Covenant it's
[1:37:12] Everlasting when did it start then when
[1:37:14] will it stop
[1:37:15] never Genesis 17:20 as for ishal listen
[1:37:19] as for ishal
[1:37:22] I have heard thee this God speaking as
[1:37:24] for Israel I have heard Thee I have
[1:37:27] blessed him listen he's got he's
[1:37:29] Abraham's son I have blessed him and
[1:37:32] will make him fruitful and will multiply
[1:37:34] him exceedingly 12 princes shall he beg
[1:37:37] and I will make him a great nation
[1:37:39] that's what he did for ishmael's
[1:37:41] children but there was a thn thorn in
[1:37:43] the
[1:37:44] flesh that's brother the Bible also says
[1:37:47] that talking about sons of Israel said
[1:37:49] Israel he'll be a wild man and he has
[1:37:53] but he says I'll make him a great nation
[1:37:55] but the next verse Genesis 17:21 but
[1:37:59] that's the best exclusion in the Old
[1:38:00] Testament but my Covenant will I
[1:38:04] establish with Isaac amen
[1:38:08] Isaac sons descendants of Isaac amen not
[1:38:12] ishel amen so now now we can see who
[1:38:16] owns Palestine who owns the land of
[1:38:19] Israel who owns Jerusalem Israel the
[1:38:22] Jews it's their land their promise their
[1:38:25] Covenant they own it Israel owns
[1:38:28] Jerusalem Israel owns the Temple Mount
[1:38:30] one and one day that mosque will be dust
[1:38:33] brother R talks about it that end in the
[1:38:34] Millennium they'll restore the temple
[1:38:36] worship and so forth and so on like I
[1:38:38] mean hey why do they have to restore I
[1:38:41] they're going to receive Christ but he
[1:38:42] said they will do it so they'll do it
[1:38:43] but it's got to be that last 1,000 years
[1:38:45] to finish out complete that time however
[1:38:48] anyway this where you come I want to
[1:38:50] read this last little we'll give you a
[1:38:51] little uh uh summation here of of uh
[1:38:55] kind of a timeline brother M talks about
[1:38:58] till the end as the musicians
[1:39:00] come kind of an interesting timeline
[1:39:02] brother B says in this quote sixfold
[1:39:05] purpose he says a confederation of
[1:39:08] church now listen this is really good a
[1:39:10] confederation of church WIll consolidate
[1:39:12] them together and bring bring the Jews
[1:39:15] into this confederation and bring them
[1:39:18] back to their own Temple worship again
[1:39:21] in the thus sayith the Lord out of the
[1:39:23] Bible and they will have their own
[1:39:25] church okay now the Confederation church
[1:39:27] is going to consolidate them with the
[1:39:29] Jews in a confederation okay they're
[1:39:31] going to make a of course who's going to
[1:39:33] who's going to actually head up the the
[1:39:34] confederation of churches is going to be
[1:39:36] the Catholic church we know that so
[1:39:38] Catholicism is going to make a covenant
[1:39:39] with the Jews
[1:39:42] okay they they are what now I just
[1:39:45] called this now fresh brother said now
[1:39:48] they are now a nation recognized is that
[1:39:51] right they have not they but they have
[1:39:54] not their Temple worship yet and when
[1:39:57] they establish the temple worship the
[1:39:59] church will be
[1:40:00] gone so we got a timeline there God will
[1:40:04] be deal God will be dealing with the
[1:40:06] Jews as a nation then when they brought
[1:40:10] then when they are brought into the
[1:40:12] Confederation Rome will break it in the
[1:40:14] middle of the 70th week three and A2
[1:40:16] years he'll break that Covenant with
[1:40:17] them and cause the Abomination that
[1:40:19] maketh desolation
[1:40:21] to spread the consummation so that's
[1:40:23] when they'll destroy it then he'll take
[1:40:26] both Protestant and Jews and persecute
[1:40:28] [Music]
[1:40:30] them we'll be in glory we'll be at the
[1:40:32] wedding supper it's going to be the
[1:40:35] tribulation going to be a rough time for
[1:40:36] Israel they will prevail but it's going
[1:40:38] to be a rough time for Israel cuz
[1:40:40] they're going to those two prophets
[1:40:42] Revelation 11 going to call out 144,000
[1:40:44] going to preach this same message seven
[1:40:46] seal to the bride same thing as the
[1:40:47] seven trumpets to Israel call out
[1:40:49] 144,000 they'll believe it they'll
[1:40:51] accept it it a nation will be born one
[1:40:53] day then guess what they'll break that
[1:40:55] Covenant then they'll then then they
[1:40:57] will kill the 144,000 and they'll kill
[1:41:00] them to prophets but God will resurrect
[1:41:02] them them up in the streets and said all
[1:41:04] the world will see them resurrect up and
[1:41:06] uh of course they send gifts and so
[1:41:08] forth they have a joyous time they
[1:41:10] because those two prophets will listen
[1:41:11] listen what he do he said these two
[1:41:13] prophets will stand up listen then
[1:41:15] they'll take both the prostit and Jew
[1:41:17] and persecute them and that time these
[1:41:19] two Prophet will stand up and curse the
[1:41:21] Earth that will not rain in the days of
[1:41:23] their prophecy and they'll call fire to
[1:41:25] heavens and everything else you just
[1:41:27] wait so after those two prophets do all
[1:41:30] bring a curse upon the land like that
[1:41:32] they'll kill them two
[1:41:34] prophets and they'll send gifts you know
[1:41:37] and they'll have their Great Big
[1:41:38] Christmas F you know festival and
[1:41:40] they'll send gifts to one another like
[1:41:42] that and three days later them two
[1:41:44] prophets are going to raise up uh we
[1:41:47] didn't plan on
