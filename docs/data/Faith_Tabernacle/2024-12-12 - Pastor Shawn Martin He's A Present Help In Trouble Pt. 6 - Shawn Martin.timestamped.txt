[43:14] today a man to know that God does work
[43:17] and he he is
[43:19] present and um but as as we are taught
[43:25] that God works by
[43:27] faith for that's his law there has to be
[43:31] somebody to believe him there has to be
[43:34] someone to take him at his word uh
[43:38] brother branam he he said to a woman
[43:41] sitting in a wheelchair he said now if
[43:43] your faith can't go to action cannot
[43:47] can't go to action he said you'll you
[43:50] will always be in the
[43:52] wheelchair but when your faith can take
[43:55] action to a place that down in your soul

[44:05] something's going to take place and You
[44:08] Begin moving ain't that right see so the
[44:12] the Bible tells us of of course that
[44:15] faith without works is dead amen so
[44:18] there's got to be works that come with
[44:20] faith and and brother Brandon would tell
[44:23] us God sees your faith the world sees
[44:26] your action God sees your faith the
[44:30] world sees your action so faith and and
[44:33] action or Works go hand in hand and and
[44:37] so but this is what makes us unusual to
[44:40] the world Amen uh and and this this word
[44:44] unusual it it means definitely out of
[44:47] the ordinary unexpected odd uh weird and
[44:53] and brother Brandon preached the message
[44:55] Oddball and how that we are odd we're
[44:58] we're oddballs to the world and at the
[45:01] same time the world is odd to us there
[45:04] there's there's really a um uh
[45:09] uh we're just different like oil and and
[45:12] water it it just can't mix amen we're
[45:15] either OD to the world or uh um and the
[45:20] world odd to us or uh uh so so anyways
[45:25] but God uh God is is also unusual amen
[45:29] and uh he's always been that way and in
[45:33] every age he's he's just been unusual
[45:36] his way of doing things is unusual his
[45:40] characteristics is unusual the way he
[45:43] helps amen is is unusual and and so that
[45:49] when God says I'm a present help in time
[45:51] of trouble how unusual amen it is to to
[45:56] to the world
[45:57] but it shouldn't be unusual because God
[46:00] has fortold Us in his word of what he
[46:04] would do amen and what he is the uh his
[46:08] word speaks of him and tells of who he
[46:10] is uh if you want to know about God and
[46:14] and of God and and get acquainted with
[46:17] God in in the sense of his description
[46:21] and things uh it's in the word of God
[46:23] Amen the the Bible does not present a a
[46:27] different God uh uh than than the god
[46:30] that is present to help us a amen and
[46:34] and so uh uh uh the Bible tells us that
[46:38] nothing is impossible with him how many
[46:40] believes that nothing is impossible with
[46:44] him the Bible tells us that he is the
[46:46] Mighty God and and that he is Sovereign
[46:50] it it tells us that he is the same
[46:52] yesterday today and forever amen the
[46:56] Bible also tells us of God's desire to
[46:59] heal our bodies and his desire to save
[47:03] our soul and and and the desire that he
[47:07] has to to set the the captive free but
[47:10] when he comes on the scene amen he's
[47:14] unusual amen when he does Amen come to
[47:18] help then then it's it's unusual to the
[47:21] world Amen you see God is is
[47:25] Supernatural amen as we have said and
[47:28] his actions are Supernatural and and so
[47:31] the prophet said wherever God is
[47:34] wherever he is present the supernatural
[47:37] takes place amen and and so we we we
[47:40] must uh uh uh uh uh uh be able to to
[47:45] draw that distinction between God and
[47:48] man man's help is a natural help and and
[47:51] that help is a limited help and and that
[47:54] help can't can't do the things that God
[47:56] desires to do that that help ain't going
[47:59] to get you anywhere in in in in in God
[48:02] if I could say it that way amen but but
[48:05] God's help is a supernatural help at
[48:09] which is unlimited it it's all powerful
[48:13] it it it that help works miracles that
[48:16] help does the impossible a amen and and
[48:20] so so wherever God is amen the
[48:23] supernatural takes place amen uh um uh
[48:28] he always manifests himself in a
[48:31] supernatural way wherever he is amen and
[48:35] and and this is why amen that that there
[48:38] there there's a supernatural it it
[48:40] should be a supernatural element to
[48:43] every one of our lives that has God Amen
[48:46] living within us amen e even to invite
[48:50] God into our services well we're
[48:52] inviting a supernatural element that
[48:55] that go is far superior than just our
[48:59] natural Gathering can you say Amen if it
[49:02] if if if he just provided another
[49:04] natural thing then then we don't need
[49:07] him we've got enough natural ability
[49:09] here amen that could do something but
[49:11] but we desire something greater than our
[49:14] natural strength and our natural ability
[49:17] our natural talents amen see there
[49:19] there's needs that that that that
[49:21] require the supernatural amen and and so
[49:25] uh according to the Bible amen he is
[49:28] here how many believes he's here he is
[49:30] here the mighty Angel which is the Lord
[49:33] himself the son of man revealed is here
[49:37] amen see and and we know beyond the
[49:40] shadow of a doubt at least I hope it's a
[49:42] it's no uh Shadow of Doubt in you amen
[49:45] is is that that he came uh uh with power
[49:50] amen and great glory in a cloud amen and
[49:54] and and and and so uh uh he's here amen
[49:58] he did not leave with the prophet amen
[50:00] the you know it's just like when John
[50:02] left the scene Jesus didn't leave the
[50:04] scene amen John said I must decrease
[50:07] that he may increase and and so uh uh uh
[50:10] brother brandom amen his ministry was
[50:13] that of John the Baptist amen as John
[50:15] the Baptist uh introduced the coming
[50:18] first coming of Christ so has has this
[50:21] message forun the second coming of
[50:24] Christ amen and it's brought him amen
[50:27] it's brought him to Earth amen amen not
[50:31] in a physical body of course as we know
[50:34] but at the same time Jesus Christ is
[50:37] here in every way that he was in the
[50:40] days of when he walked the Earth outside
[50:43] of his Corporal body can you say amen
[50:46] amen see and so now notice what the
[50:49] Bible says they that know their God
[50:52] shall do exploits amen I believe the
[50:55] prophet would call it Grace
[50:57] exploits Supernatural exploits it isn't
[51:01] uh uh like like going to a circus and
[51:04] and watching man do all kinds of stuff
[51:06] or or or going to the U uh Ripley
[51:09] Believe It or Not and seeing the
[51:11] accomplishments of man and and we stand
[51:13] in awe this is a greater accomplishment
[51:16] than any man could ever have is a people
[51:20] that know their God shall do great
[51:23] exploits amen Supernatural explo poets
[51:27] notice what the prophet said and they
[51:29] will show supern Supernatural signs a
[51:32] people Abraham seed uh a sign of the
[51:36] supernatural Christ risen from the dead
[51:40] supernaturally that's what a people will
[51:42] show amen when they know their God the
[51:46] people that know their God in a
[51:49] supernatural way not trying to make him
[51:52] a a natural man not trying to make him
[51:55] uh uh just like a four-footed Beast or
[51:58] or or whatever like like uh uh Paul
[52:01] talked about in Romans and how they made
[52:03] The Incorruptible God into a corruptible
[52:05] image and all of these things see but
[52:08] they that truly know their God the way
[52:11] he is they will do great exploits amen
[52:16] and they'll show the sign of a
[52:18] supernatural Christ risen from the dead
[52:21] supernaturally see so they know their
[52:23] God Amen how many knows your God Amen
[52:26] well it's talking about you Church he's
[52:29] here he's here a prophet introduced him
[52:33] and the people that know him shall do
[52:36] great exploits see you don't know God
[52:39] through a textbook amen you know him by
[52:42] seeing him who is
[52:44] invisible amen see amen so h a teacher
[52:49] you know didn't come and paint a to us a
[52:52] picture of him to where we can see him
[52:55] in the way of imagination amen there
[52:58] there's Great Men amen theologians and
[53:01] Scholars that can stand behind the
[53:03] pulpit and they can take a subject and
[53:05] they can paint it so well Amen to where
[53:08] we you can just imagine it in your mind
[53:11] and and these things but but that's not
[53:13] the way Christ did he didn't bring up a
[53:16] theologian Amen to paint a picture so
[53:19] we'd have an imagination of him amen but
[53:22] God has come and revealed himself in a
[53:26] Supernatural way amen this is why the
[53:29] prophet said in this great hour that
[53:31] we're now living we and we see yearly it
[53:35] gets darker and darker to the world and
[53:38] the coming notice the coming of the Lord
[53:41] gets brighter and brighter as he reveals
[53:45] himself in his word and in his
[53:49] manifestation amen see so but but what
[53:53] makes him unusual amen see because the
[53:57] prophet talked the the Bible talks about
[53:59] this coming amen the the Bible talks
[54:02] about the the days that we're living in
[54:04] but what makes it so
[54:07] unusual is because the people don't
[54:10] believe in the Supernatural amen the
[54:13] churches have gotten away from the
[54:16] Supernatural and the ministry has taught
[54:19] the people Amen to be against the
[54:22] supernatural amen see they don't believe
[54:25] that that Jesus Christ is the same as he
[54:28] was back then uh today can you say amen
[54:31] amen that's right and and it it's kind
[54:34] of like in blind bame's day amen the
[54:37] prophet said the priest taught that
[54:39] there is no such thing in no more no
[54:42] such thing as Miracles no such thing as
[54:45] Divine Healing no such thing as that
[54:48] Supernatural he said we don't have that
[54:50] see that's what the priest said taught
[54:52] in that day Jehovah doesn't heal by his
[54:54] power no more we have doctors and things
[54:57] that does that isn't that way we stand
[55:00] today amen people rely more on doctors
[55:02] than they do the word of God Amen the
[55:05] doctor's word becomes their absolute
[55:07] than the word of God does he says see
[55:09] that's what a priest taught we have
[55:11] doctors and things uh uh that does that
[55:14] and we don't need that no more so
[55:16] Jehovah doesn't heal that was of the day
[55:18] gone by we just keep the law and we get
[55:21] sick and die and go to heaven and that's
[55:23] all that's all we need ain't that right
[55:26] see and and and so but but really that
[55:29] isn't as bad as it is today amen today
[55:33] is the worst day that we could ever uh
[55:35] imagine and and and and the Bible again
[55:38] talks about it Paul would tell us that
[55:41] that that perilous times will come in
[55:44] the last days perilous times that word
[55:47] perilous is dangerous dangerous times
[55:50] are going to come amen and and you think
[55:53] well oh yeah right murder and and uh you
[55:56] know uh rape and and and uh human
[55:59] trafficking but notice what brother
[56:01] Brandon would tie this to perilous times
[56:04] shall come and he said the faith will be
[56:07] pretty slow then amen that's the danger
[56:10] amen is faith will be pretty slow then
[56:13] amen see if God moves on the scene by
[56:17] faith then the people are left without
[56:20] hope because their faith is slow see
[56:23] we're living in the day of modern
[56:26] science amen and and Divine Healing has
[56:30] practically been placed on the Shelf
[56:32] amen we've got psychologist we've got
[56:35] you know we we've got uh all kinds of
[56:38] hospitals and and and and you know
[56:40] that's all okay that that's all fine and
[56:42] dandy whatever the world wants amen but
[56:44] a prophet told us God never told us to
[56:46] go build hospitals God never told us
[56:49] Amen to do all of these things he told
[56:51] us to lay hands on the sick cast out
[56:54] devils and in my name
[56:56] amen you you shall lay hands on the sick
[56:59] and they shall be healed you'll cast out
[57:01] Devils you'll you'll drink any deadly
[57:03] thing and it shall not hurt you why
[57:05] because it's in a supernatural Rim can
[57:09] you say amen that's right see amen I I
[57:13] don't you know the doctors are limited
[57:15] and we expect that to happen but the
[57:18] church should not be limited
[57:21] amen it's true but the prophet said the
[57:25] church has turned the people over to the
[57:27] doctors especially the
[57:30] psychiatrist see but so what did Jesus
[57:34] say about this day Matthew 24 and 27 for
[57:39] as the lightning cometh out of the East
[57:41] and shineth even unto the West so shall
[57:44] also the coming of the son of man be for
[57:48] wheresoever the carcass is there will
[57:52] the Eagles be gathered together so if
[57:55] you see what he's saying the son of man
[57:58] is the carcass can you say Amen the son
[58:01] of man is the carcass wherever the son
[58:05] of man is revealed there's where the
[58:07] Eagles are going to be gathered now so
[58:11] what is the carcass what is the son of
[58:13] man well John 1:1 in the beginning was
[58:16] the word the word was with God and the
[58:19] Word was God 14th verse and the Word was
[58:24] made flesh and dwelt Among Us ain't that
[58:28] right see but the carcass the carcass
[58:31] that word revealed is where the
[58:34] Supernatural is demonstrated can you say
[58:37] amen and that's where amen the Eagles
[58:40] are gathered notice what a prophet said
[58:43] he says now through the age it has been
[58:45] that way men walk in Slumber of life and
[58:48] they hear their teaching and their
[58:50] philosophy and so forth that teach us
[58:53] theologies but that still doesn't satisy
[58:56] y the human heart I guarantee it doesn't
[58:58] satisfy the elect of this day see and
[59:02] when the supernatural comes into view
[59:05] like it did in the days of our Lord
[59:07] Jesus when the word became flesh God
[59:11] took on flesh God the word became flesh
[59:14] ain't that right see he says see like it
[59:17] was in that day after their fine priest
[59:20] and so forth that they had their
[59:22] Scholars and their philosophies when
[59:25] Jesus came on the scene when that word
[59:29] god became flesh see when he came on the
[59:33] scene with the power and the
[59:35] manifestation of God the people flock to
[59:39] hear him because it's something in the
[59:43] rims Beyond can you say Amen so wherever
[59:47] the Supernatural is displayed and the
[59:50] supernatural manifestations of God Amen
[59:53] is is is on displ that's where the
[59:56] carcass is and that's where the elect of
[59:59] God will be gathered can you say Amen
[1:00:03] now some amen call call the supernatural
[1:00:07] work of God they called it a devil amen
[1:00:10] when Jesus done the supernatural they
[1:00:12] said Ah that's the devil right but then
[1:00:15] there was others that recognized
[1:00:18] something different amen and the prophet
[1:00:21] said and those who believed in it in
[1:00:23] that Supernatural work amen they were
[1:00:26] saved and they were healed think of that
[1:00:30] they were saved because they believed in
[1:00:32] it they were healed because they didn't
[1:00:35] look at it as a devil amen they saw it
[1:00:38] as God doing something Supernatural God
[1:00:42] was there Amen to help them oh do you
[1:00:46] love him another thing that makes God
[1:00:49] unusual his people have gotten away from
[1:00:52] the word of God Amen and they don't know
[1:00:56] what God has promised to do in his word
[1:00:59] so when he does something when he does
[1:01:03] do something amen they don't believe it
[1:01:06] amen Prophet said they're so steeped in
[1:01:08] Dogma so steeped in their Creeds and
[1:01:11] Theology and they're so comfortable amen
[1:01:15] just going to church for you know and
[1:01:17] timing it and everything is just perfect
[1:01:19] it's all a program see amen and and
[1:01:22] they're just satisfied with that amen
[1:01:25] see and and and so uh uh but but we find
[1:01:29] that God does nothing everybody say God
[1:01:32] does nothing God does nothing outside of
[1:01:36] his own word God does nothing outside of
[1:01:41] his own word you take away the word you
[1:01:44] take away God a ain't that right so the
[1:01:47] people have gotten away from the word
[1:01:49] they've gotten away from God Amen when
[1:01:53] they rejected the message of this hour
[1:01:55] they rejected Jesus Christ amen see so
[1:01:59] the prophet says see God always manifest
[1:02:02] himself in Supernatural but always
[1:02:06] everybody say always according to his
[1:02:10] word see another place anybody that
[1:02:13] really takes God's word at face value is
[1:02:17] considered a little off at the head
[1:02:21] little unusual a little mental little
[1:02:24] something a little wrong with him little
[1:02:26] CRA just an oddball when someone truly
[1:02:29] takes God at his word takes his word at
[1:02:34] face value see it's so Supernatural the
[1:02:37] natural world doesn't know nothing about
[1:02:39] it it's foolish to the carnal mind so
[1:02:42] you'll never understand it but Abraham
[1:02:46] believed it if we could go down through
[1:02:48] the Bible of of this of the pages of
[1:02:51] this Bible the word was so odd to the
[1:02:54] world but no Noah believed it can you
[1:02:57] say Amen we could say but but David
[1:03:00] believed it but Rahab believed it but
[1:03:04] Moses believed it there's got to be
[1:03:06] somebody that believes it and because
[1:03:09] there was somebody that believed it God
[1:03:12] was able to be a help Amen in a present
[1:03:16] time can you say amen amen you see we
[1:03:19] could say Mary believed it see she
[1:03:22] didn't fuss amen the prophet said she
[1:03:24] didn't fuss at that angel like Zechariah
[1:03:27] uh uh did she didn't try to figure it
[1:03:29] all out she simply believed the word of
[1:03:32] the Lord do you believe that amen so
[1:03:35] when the word came to her now think of
[1:03:37] it she had already been meditating upon
[1:03:40] Isaiah 9 or uh uh 96 maybe or when when
[1:03:45] Behold a virgin shall conceive amen she
[1:03:47] had all the prophet said she had been
[1:03:49] meditating it they just got back from
[1:03:51] church the day before amen and and uh
[1:03:55] the the the the priest was up there
[1:03:56] telling them all that God isn't the same
[1:03:59] amen he he doesn't do Miracles there's
[1:04:01] no such thing as them things that he did
[1:04:03] back there amen and and the prophet
[1:04:06] gives that story of how her and Joseph
[1:04:08] after service began to talk about it and
[1:04:11] and and something be to prick upon in
[1:04:13] her heart amen and she was directed to
[1:04:16] the promise amen Behold a virgin shall
[1:04:19] conceive amen and it wouldn't leave her
[1:04:21] mind amen and the next morning as she
[1:04:24] went out uh had there appeared an angel
[1:04:28] and begin to tell her you're that Virgin
[1:04:30] Mary amen and she didn't question it it
[1:04:33] wasn't it wasn't so un unusual and out
[1:04:37] of the out of the way to where she just
[1:04:39] couldn't grasp it but she would say be
[1:04:42] it unto me according to Thy word now
[1:04:47] brother Bram said now how many of you
[1:04:49] sick people is expected to be healed
[1:04:51] tonight all right you're going to get it
[1:04:53] you have to see you believe it and are
[1:04:56] expecting it it's got to happen I just
[1:04:59] believe God don't you certainly see what
[1:05:02] he says is the truth don't try to figure
[1:05:05] it out just
[1:05:08] believe another place he says oh the
[1:05:10] blessedness of believing the blessing
[1:05:14] blessing of not trying to figure it out
[1:05:16] the blessing of just resting on God's
[1:05:19] word and say it's true and go on it's
[1:05:23] life can you say Amen how many can say
[1:05:25] that today it's true the word of God is
[1:05:29] true and you just move on you're not
[1:05:33] trying to figure it out it's just
[1:05:35] true
[1:05:37] GL he says if God makes a promise in the
[1:05:40] Bible then if you receive that the
[1:05:43] supernatural promise will make a
[1:05:46] supernatural manifestation because God
[1:05:49] will vindicate his word I think that's
[1:05:51] worth reading again if God makes a
[1:05:54] promise in the Bible any promise if he
[1:05:57] makes that promise and then if you
[1:06:00] receive that the pro Supernatural
[1:06:03] promise will make a supernatural
[1:06:05] manifestation because God will vindicate
[1:06:08] his
[1:06:08] word brother brandham talked about the
[1:06:11] time his
[1:06:12] mother-in-law uh her clock quit working
[1:06:16] she told Brother brand she said I needed
[1:06:18] that clock and and and she said I didn't
[1:06:21] have the money to go to go get a clock
[1:06:24] and and so she says I I just got down
[1:06:27] and I said God make that clock run for
[1:06:29] me will you and she looked up and it
[1:06:32] started running just perfectly why amen
[1:06:36] it wasn't too unusual to her to ask God
[1:06:39] to do something amen it wasn't too
[1:06:42] unusual amen well what if I pray and it
[1:06:44] doesn't happen it wasn't too unusual she
[1:06:47] just took God at face valow you
[1:06:50] regardless it it wasn't trying to figure
[1:06:52] it out it wasn't trying to amen whatever
[1:06:55] she just believed
[1:06:58] god brother Bram said later a few days
[1:07:01] later her refrigerator went out she
[1:07:03] didn't have the money to get a
[1:07:06] refrigerator so she said God will you be
[1:07:08] merciful to me again you know me he says
[1:07:12] she said just start my refrigerator to
[1:07:15] freezing again will you she got up went
[1:07:18] and looked in her refrigerator and it
[1:07:20] was running perfectly amen I'm just
[1:07:22] thinking of uh of these things and and
[1:07:25] and and brother Dell Smith you know uh
[1:07:27] he had put on a a testimony of his uh uh
[1:07:31] that he had uh uh on a Minister's chat
[1:07:33] today and I thought it would be fitting
[1:07:36] but he's talking about how he was frying
[1:07:38] chicken uh Wings in a deep fryer and and
[1:07:43] you know when he had finished the uh the
[1:07:46] The Last One Wing he he he went and got
[1:07:50] it and he was going to move it out of
[1:07:53] the way and when he got there and let
[1:07:55] put his hands on it or get ready to put
[1:07:57] his hands to it the leg went out and it
[1:07:59] dumped uh grease on his hand and he said
[1:08:03] immediately he thought oh my I got to
[1:08:05] preach tonight you know and and but he
[1:08:08] says as he as he sat there he realized
[1:08:12] there was no pain there was no bubbling
[1:08:16] there there there there was nothing
[1:08:17] there he said he just went and uh uh
[1:08:20] shook the grease off wiped it off and
[1:08:22] went inside and ate ate his wings and
[1:08:24] just thinking God God Amen for healing
[1:08:27] or for protecting see he's a present
[1:08:30] help in the time of your trouble can you
[1:08:34] say Amen now see that that that
[1:08:36] shouldn't be too unusual for us amen if
[1:08:40] we believe in a supernatural God so
[1:08:43] brother Bram said see be simple just ask
[1:08:45] be simple just ask don't try to figure
[1:08:48] it out don't try to study it just
[1:08:51] believe it don't mentally try to figure
[1:08:54] it out just believe believe it with your
[1:08:57] soul can you say Amen now he's telling
[1:09:00] us what we have got to do Amen in in in
[1:09:04] in this be simple just ask don't try to
[1:09:09] figure it out and just believe it in
[1:09:11] your soul can you say Amen see so then
[1:09:15] we find that the supernatural worked
[1:09:18] Amen in accordance to what God had
[1:09:21] promised amen with for brother Dale and
[1:09:24] and for uh brother bram's uh
[1:09:27] mother-in-law and and for so many the
[1:09:29] supernatural worked in accordance to
[1:09:33] God's promised word see because
[1:09:35] Philippians 4:19 it says but my God is
[1:09:40] he your God I like how Paul would put
[1:09:42] that my God Amen not just God but my God
[1:09:47] Amen he he he's showing that he knew God
[1:09:50] in a personal way God Amen he had that
[1:09:53] relationship with God he had such a
[1:09:56] confidence in God that God became his
[1:09:59] God Amen God become his provider God
[1:10:02] became his way maker God became his
[1:10:05] Redeemer that's the way it should be
[1:10:07] with all of us but he says but my God
[1:10:10] shall supply all your needs not not your
[1:10:14] wants your needs according to his riches
[1:10:18] in Glory by Christ Jesus can you say
[1:10:21] amen amen so the prophet said in all
[1:10:23] ages it's been the supernatural
[1:10:27] manifestation of his word now think of
[1:10:30] that it's it's been in all ages the
[1:10:33] supernatural manifestation of his word
[1:10:37] oh my amen see now the Pentecostals and
[1:10:40] the charismatics they they accept any
[1:10:44] kind of Supernatural manifestation
[1:10:47] outside of the word of God Amen and and
[1:10:50] the prophet talked about it amen blood
[1:10:52] in the hands you know oil in the
[1:10:54] forehead or vice vers amen speaking in
[1:10:56] tongues and prophesying amen you can go
[1:10:59] up on in YouTube and they've got they've
[1:11:01] got what they call the revivals and of
[1:11:04] of laughing hysterically and people
[1:11:06] howling like dogs and people shaking
[1:11:10] uncontrollably amen these things are
[1:11:13] believed uh uh to be a supernatural
[1:11:16] manifestation of God but I say this if
[1:11:20] it's it's not of God if it does not line
[1:11:23] up with the word of God
[1:11:25] amen if the supernatural manifestation
[1:11:28] does not line up with this word it's not
[1:11:31] of
[1:11:32] God are you with me now amen see amen
[1:11:37] see so so now in in Isaiah
[1:11:41] 5511 God said the word that goeth forth
[1:11:44] out of my mouth it shall not return unto
[1:11:46] me void but it shall accomplish
[1:11:48] everybody say it shall accomplish well
[1:11:51] well well what's going to make that
[1:11:52] accomp who's going to make sure it's
[1:11:54] accomplished God is a present help in
[1:11:57] the time of trouble amen it shall
[1:11:59] accomplish you say well that's his word
[1:12:02] but his word concerns you have you ever
[1:12:05] just thought of that it was by his word
[1:12:07] that he decreed you to Salvation it's by
[1:12:10] his word that he said by my stripes you
[1:12:12] are healed or we were healed amen every
[1:12:16] promise of God pertains to his
[1:12:21] children amen so it shall go forth out
[1:12:24] of my mouth or that go forth out of my
[1:12:26] mouth it shall not return unto me void
[1:12:28] but it shall accomplish that which I
[1:12:30] please and it shall prosper in the thing
[1:12:33] where to I sent it so the prophet said
[1:12:36] see God works right through that word
[1:12:39] right through to make it come to pass in
[1:12:43] this generation that we live in he's
[1:12:47] here everybody say he's here he's here
[1:12:51] amen not to tickle your fancy he's here
[1:12:54] not to make you roll on the floor he's
[1:12:57] here not for you to shake up and down
[1:13:00] and and run all over the place he's here
[1:13:03] to make that word come to pass in this
[1:13:06] generation in your
[1:13:09] life yes
[1:13:11] sir you see when the word of God is
[1:13:13] foreign to the people then God is
[1:13:16] unusual to them when he fulfills it when
[1:13:21] the supernatural is foreign to the
[1:13:23] people then it is unusual Amen to them
[1:13:28] when it takes place see so being that
[1:13:32] God does nothing outside of his word
[1:13:35] then we have to know what he promised to
[1:13:38] do in order to recognize him amen we
[1:13:42] have to know amen we have to know by his
[1:13:45] word what he promised to do if we're
[1:13:48] going to truly our expectation is going
[1:13:51] to be genuine then we have to know what
[1:13:54] he promised to do in his word in order
[1:13:57] for our expectation to be right can you
[1:14:00] amen amen God never did say that there
[1:14:03] would be blood coming out of our hands
[1:14:05] and oil coming out of the forehead I
[1:14:07] don't expect
[1:14:09] that
[1:14:11] hello amen see but so we have to know
[1:14:14] what he promised to do in order to
[1:14:17] recognize him see his word is his
[1:14:20] promise as the prophet has taught us and
[1:14:23] he allotted his word to every age to
[1:14:25] each age that's important amen he lotted
[1:14:29] his word to each age amen see a portion
[1:14:33] of his word to the age therefore he
[1:14:36] cannot do any more or any less than what
[1:14:39] he promised to do in the age that he put
[1:14:43] his word
[1:14:45] in can you say Amen so to se God in Noah
[1:14:49] day a person would have to know what God
[1:14:52] promised to do in that day amen to see
[1:14:55] God in Moses day aen would have to know
[1:14:59] what God promised to do in that day amen
[1:15:02] for a man to see God in Jesus day then
[1:15:06] he would have to know what God promised
[1:15:09] for that day he'd have to know what God
[1:15:12] promised for the Messiah to be that's
[1:15:15] why when Jesus went to that woman at the
[1:15:17] well and he began to do the sign of
[1:15:19] Messiah she said sir we know when the
[1:15:21] Messiah cometh he'll do these things she
[1:15:24] had already been taught no matter how
[1:15:26] low she was and degraded and and a low
[1:15:29] life something had been taught to her
[1:15:32] that when the Messiah come this is
[1:15:34] something that you going to have to look
[1:15:36] for and when he appeared to her she
[1:15:39] recognized him by the supernatural
[1:15:46] sign in the day of Isaiah the
[1:15:52] prophet for told of Messiah
[1:15:56] being born of a virgin
[1:15:58] girl when it came time for the Messiah
[1:16:01] to be
[1:16:02] born the priest had been teaching the
[1:16:05] people that God doesn't work miracles
[1:16:08] anymore as we said therefore the people
[1:16:11] didn't believe in the Supernatural the
[1:16:13] the the church and the organizations and
[1:16:16] all of that they they they' gotten away
[1:16:18] from the word that gotten away from the
[1:16:20] supernatural so then when the the spirit
[1:16:24] of God
[1:16:25] overshadowed Mary it was too unusual
[1:16:29] they couldn't accept it they couldn't
[1:16:31] accept her testimony amen that that uh
[1:16:35] what was born of her was of the Holy
[1:16:37] Ghost they they couldn't accept it so so
[1:16:40] Jesus had to Bear the the reproach of
[1:16:43] being born of illegitimacy ain't that
[1:16:45] right he was of a illegitimate birth a
[1:16:49] conception and and these things see and
[1:16:52] and when Jesus declared that he came
[1:16:54] from God and when and going back to God
[1:16:58] Amen it was too unusual amen for them to
[1:17:01] accept that and they walked away from
[1:17:03] him amen when when when he says I and my
[1:17:06] father are one it was too unusual and
[1:17:10] they crucified him you you understand
[1:17:13] too too unusual here he had become now
[1:17:16] notice what a prophet said God had sent
[1:17:19] them Deliverance God had come to be a
[1:17:22] help to them to send them a Deliverance
[1:17:26] but it didn't come just the way that
[1:17:28] they were used to receiving religion see
[1:17:31] it was too unusual for them that's why
[1:17:35] they couldn't get their Deliverance amen
[1:17:39] see so this is why only uh two of the
[1:17:42] original people that left Egypt were the
[1:17:45] only ones to go into the promised land
[1:17:47] because the rest of them didn't
[1:17:50] understand that God was there to fulfill
[1:17:52] what he had already promised God God had
[1:17:55] had said what he was going to do and
[1:17:57] there he was see they should have known
[1:18:00] that God was fulfilling his word amen
[1:18:03] why because God always uh Works amen
[1:18:08] according to his word that he allotted
[1:18:10] for that day and fulfills it amen see
[1:18:14] and this was exactly what he was doing
[1:18:17] in Moses's day in Noah's day in Jesus
[1:18:21] day amen and this is exactly what he's
[1:18:24] doing in our day can you say Amen see so
[1:18:29] then we we find amen as the prophet said
[1:18:32] see God had alloted his portion of word
[1:18:36] amen for That season of time talking of
[1:18:38] Moses see and God was ready to F makeing
[1:18:42] ready to fulfill his Divine promised
[1:18:44] word that he gave to Abraham and to
[1:18:47] Isaac and to Jacob now brother brandom
[1:18:50] says in the in the token in or the Third
[1:18:53] Exodus he said see ye years hundreds of
[1:18:56] years had passed but yet God never
[1:18:59] forgets his promise how many believes
[1:19:01] that God never forgets his promise in
[1:19:05] the season the due time God always makes
[1:19:09] his promise right therefore you can rest
[1:19:12] assure that what God has promised in
[1:19:15] this Bible he's going to do just no need
[1:19:19] of trying to think anything else and say
[1:19:22] well the prophet was maybe was wrong or
[1:19:25] or that couldn't happen in this day see
[1:19:27] it looked almost impossible then more
[1:19:30] impossible than it does now but God did
[1:19:34] it anyhow because he promised he would
[1:19:38] do it now look at the scriptures acts 7
[1:19:42] and6 and God spake on this wise that his
[1:19:46] seed Abraham's seed s should sojourn in
[1:19:50] a Strange Land and that they should
[1:19:52] bring them into bondage and entreat them
[1:19:55] evil 400 years and the nation to whom
[1:19:59] they shall be in bondage will I judge
[1:20:01] God's saying this I will judge them and
[1:20:04] and uh said God and after that they
[1:20:07] shall come forth and serve me in this
[1:20:09] place see so so that was the promise
[1:20:12] Exodus 2:24 and God heard their groaning
[1:20:17] and remembered his Covenant with Abraham
[1:20:20] Isaac and with Jacob see in in Exodus 3
[1:20:24] and8 God said to Moses I am come down to
[1:20:29] deliver them he's come to be a present
[1:20:31] help in their time of trouble see I've
[1:20:34] come down to deliver them out of the
[1:20:37] hand of the Egyptians and to bring them
[1:20:39] up out of that land unto a good land a
[1:20:43] large unto a land uh flowing with milk
[1:20:46] and honey so God notice God came not
[1:20:49] only just to judge that Nation he come
[1:20:52] to judge that Nation but he also came to
[1:20:56] deliver his elect ain't that right so
[1:21:00] God is telling Moses I remember the
[1:21:02] Covenant I've heard their groaning amen
[1:21:05] now in that 10th verse now come now
[1:21:08] therefore I will send thee unto Pharaoh
[1:21:13] that thou mayest bring forth my people
[1:21:16] the children of Israel out of Egypt now
[1:21:19] brother brandom as he's reading that he
[1:21:21] says what was God doing he said God God
[1:21:25] was going in the form of a
[1:21:28] man amen his way is so unusual but God
[1:21:33] was going in a form of a man amen see so
[1:21:38] Moses went down not just to do something
[1:21:41] Supernatural in the way of Performing
[1:21:43] Miracles but he came with the word of
[1:21:46] the Lord and notice what a prophet says
[1:21:49] a true voice of God only brings back
[1:21:53] that real living Supernatural god with
[1:21:57] his Supernatural word with the
[1:21:59] supernatural manifestation of the true
[1:22:02] word then we know that it's the voice of
[1:22:06] God can you say Amen the true voice of
[1:22:09] God brings back only brings back the
[1:22:14] supernatural uh uh Living God with his
[1:22:17] Supernatural word with the supernatural
[1:22:20] manifestation see so I hope you
[1:22:23] understand why this message message is
[1:22:25] so important to us you know I I we
[1:22:29] appreciate what the brothers uh done and
[1:22:33] preached it in the ages you know the the
[1:22:36] other Church ages and uh we we certainly
[1:22:39] appreciate that but those men weren't
[1:22:42] prophets come on Church they they the
[1:22:46] prophets said they were part of the
[1:22:47] reformer age see and and they only they
[1:22:51] they could only preach under that light
[1:22:54] what little old life they've got and
[1:22:56] brother Brown said we we've had just
[1:22:58] enough life amen to accept Christ as our
[1:23:01] savior and and these say just enough lot
[1:23:04] just a little bit see amen but see a
[1:23:07] Vindicated Prophet is the voice of God
[1:23:12] can you say Amen a Vindicated Prophet is
[1:23:15] the voice of God for the word of God
[1:23:19] comes to
[1:23:20] him amen see so this white brother brand
[1:23:23] would tell us now I'm just your brother
[1:23:26] by the grace of God when the angel of
[1:23:28] the Lord moves down it becomes then a
[1:23:30] voice of God to you if I offended you by
[1:23:33] saying that forgive me but I felt that
[1:23:35] might have been resented but I am God's
[1:23:38] voice to you I say that again that time
[1:23:40] was under inspiration I felt bad about
[1:23:42] it the first time but it repeated it
[1:23:45] amen so God wanted us to understand that
[1:23:48] this message was not just an a reformer
[1:23:51] message amen this this message was not a
[1:23:54] a message that coming from a theology or
[1:23:56] just some man trying to put something
[1:23:58] together this message is God's voice to
[1:24:01] us which brought back the supernatural
[1:24:04] manifestation it brought back to us the
[1:24:08] reality of a living
[1:24:11] God Supernatural can you say amen amen
[1:24:16] and under this message we understand
[1:24:18] that he is a present help in the time of
[1:24:21] our trouble no question can you amen so
[1:24:25] God in this age has come in the form of
[1:24:29] a man and manifested himself in a
[1:24:33] supernatural way amen how many believes
[1:24:37] that amen see and the prophet said
[1:24:40] that's why today the message blinds the
[1:24:42] people so much is because they're not
[1:24:45] used to seeing the
[1:24:47] supernatural they're used for a
[1:24:50] theologian they're used for educated man
[1:24:53] to be able to put everything together
[1:24:55] amen and they're not used Amen to the
[1:24:58] supernatural but when God come they
[1:25:01] should have known because God promised
[1:25:04] to send us a prophet of Malachi 4 he
[1:25:07] promised Amen to come down himself with
[1:25:10] an open book He's promised all these
[1:25:14] things amen now I want to say this we
[1:25:18] have a responsibility to keep this voice
[1:25:20] of God
[1:25:21] alive we have a responsibility to keep
[1:25:24] keep this message of God alive can you
[1:25:26] say Amen as long as the voice of God is
[1:25:30] sounding there is the
[1:25:34] supernatural you believe
[1:25:36] it so now God is in Bride
[1:25:44] form made up of
[1:25:47] men women boys
[1:25:50] girls God is now present in the form of
[1:25:54] his
[1:25:55] bride the prophet said the voice of God
[1:25:58] is in
[1:25:59] her oh man the voice of
[1:26:04] God what is that amen the is it a
[1:26:07] different voice than what a prophet
[1:26:09] preached nope for she he the prophet
[1:26:11] said the the spirit of God the the bride
[1:26:14] and the prophet will be saying the same
[1:26:16] thing amen can you say Amen which tells
[1:26:20] us that God is still manifesting himself
[1:26:23] in a Supernatural way don't become the
[1:26:26] voice for a theologian don't become a
[1:26:29] voice for Dr so and so don't become the
[1:26:31] voice amen even your own voice amen
[1:26:34] don't become the voice of of Science and
[1:26:37] and and education all that become the
[1:26:40] voice of
[1:26:43] God
[1:26:44] Supernatural Lord now notice the voice
[1:26:47] of God Amen this is why Jesus said in
[1:26:50] Matthew 18 verily I say unto you
[1:26:53] whatsoever you shall bind on Earth shall
[1:26:55] be bound in heaven and whatsoever you
[1:26:57] shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in
[1:26:59] Heaven Can you say amen amen listen
[1:27:01] Church you see the connection you and
[1:27:03] God God in a bride God in you Amen to
[1:27:07] where you don't have to beg you don't
[1:27:09] have to plead you don't have to amen
[1:27:11] fall apart that God that Supernatural
[1:27:14] God is in
[1:27:16] you whatsoever you shall bind on Earth
[1:27:19] shall be bound in heaven whatsoever you
[1:27:21] shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in
[1:27:23] heaven again I say unto you that if two
[1:27:26] of you shall agree on Earth as touching
[1:27:28] anything that they shall ask it shall be
[1:27:31] done for them of My Father which is in
[1:27:33] heaven how many believes that amen John
[1:27:36] 14:13 whatsoever you shall ask in my
[1:27:39] name that will I do that the father may
[1:27:42] be glorified in the son if you shall ask
[1:27:45] anything in my name I will do it amen
[1:27:50] that's right see I I can I say it this
[1:27:53] way don't let that be too unusual for
[1:27:56] you this is a promise this speaks for us
[1:28:01] in the age of adoption when the sons of
[1:28:04] God are being placed back in their
[1:28:06] position amen this scripture applies to
[1:28:09] you and
[1:28:13] I God doesn't ex expect us just to
[1:28:18] accept every manifestation that comes
[1:28:22] along but he does want us to believe and
[1:28:25] he expects us to believe in what he
[1:28:28] promised to do am right you believe that
[1:28:32] so as Believers we should pray according
[1:28:35] to what David prayed give me
[1:28:38] understanding give me understanding in
[1:28:40] in in Psalms 1191 169 he prayed to the
[1:28:43] Lord saying give me understanding
[1:28:46] according to Thy
[1:28:47] word ain't that right so now we we can I
[1:28:52] think we can all say that the spirit of
[1:28:55] of of wisdom and Revelation and
[1:28:58] understanding has come to us through the
[1:29:00] sounding of the seventh Angel's messag I
[1:29:04] I can truly I truly believe that the
[1:29:06] eyes of our understanding is being
[1:29:09] enlightened that this day Paul's prayer
[1:29:13] is being
[1:29:15] fulfilled ain't that right now listen it
[1:29:18] it had to be but why because now we're
[1:29:21] seeing what God promised to do we seeing
[1:29:24] that God is not dead we're seeing that
[1:29:27] God is Not amen a god of History he's
[1:29:30] alive and well he is present amen here
[1:29:34] to help
[1:29:35] us time of
[1:29:38] trouble second Corinthians
[1:29:41] 169 the eyes of the Lord run to and fro
[1:29:44] throughout the whole earth to show
[1:29:47] himself
[1:29:49] strong did he not do that in this
[1:29:53] message yes
[1:29:55] sir I don't I don't I don't see how
[1:29:57] anyone could hear the message study the
[1:30:01] message and leave
[1:30:04] away with the thought that God is weak
[1:30:07] that God is
[1:30:12] limited he's looking to show himself
[1:30:16] strong in the behalf of them whose heart
[1:30:20] is perfect toward him that's it now the
[1:30:23] prophet said God is waiting to find
[1:30:25] somebody it's not too unusual to that
[1:30:29] they can be Anointed with the Holy Ghost
[1:30:31] to prove that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:30:33] yesterday today and forever to be a
[1:30:36] Shining Light to Blind the eyes of the
[1:30:39] unbeliever God's looking for somebody in
[1:30:42] this age to where that that that his
[1:30:46] actions the he
[1:30:49] himself the Supernatural is not so
[1:30:52] unusual
[1:30:54] right that's right that's right can you
[1:30:56] say Amen yes you're going to go through
[1:30:59] hard times yes you're living in a in
[1:31:02] worst a je yes the devils are fighting
[1:31:05] on every hand but somebody's got to take
[1:31:08] God at his
[1:31:11] word to where when they look at it it's
[1:31:14] not too
[1:31:15] unusual amen they can say I know God's
[1:31:18] going to help I know God's going to
[1:31:19] deliver I know I know that God's going
[1:31:23] to move on the
[1:31:30] scene Prophet said God has never sent a
[1:31:32] message in any day but what he
[1:31:34] Vindicated it with the
[1:31:36] supernatural so what we need today is
[1:31:41] preachers that believe in the
[1:31:45] Supernatural to build the people's faith
[1:31:48] in the
[1:31:50] Supernatural what we need is is daddies
[1:31:53] and
[1:31:57] to believe in the
[1:31:59] Supernatural to build their families
[1:32:02] Faith up into the
[1:32:06] supernatural can you say
[1:32:09] Amen we don't have to give you every
[1:32:12] reason why it don't work won't work why
[1:32:15] you're this and why you're that you got
[1:32:16] every negative in the
[1:32:18] world can tell you all the bad we need
[1:32:22] somebody that just believes in the
[1:32:23] Supernatural
[1:32:25] that can say hey God promised it don't
[1:32:28] put a limit to the supernatural God let
[1:32:31] let your faith go and as much as you can
[1:32:34] believe him is how much power God will
[1:32:37] be in your life or however brother
[1:32:39] brandom said that how much powerful God
[1:32:42] will be see as as much as you let your
[1:32:44] faith go can you say Amen so brother
[1:32:47] Bram said when people's Faith get up
[1:32:49] into a place they'll get the blessings
[1:32:51] to realize it's theirs then then the
[1:32:55] same operation of the holy spirit will
[1:32:57] be operating in the church just like it
[1:32:59] did back there just the same can you say
[1:33:03] Amen see just the same see when people's
[1:33:07] Faith get up into a place they'll get
[1:33:10] the blessings to realize it's theirs
[1:33:13] then the oper same operation of the holy
[1:33:16] spirit will be operating in the church
[1:33:18] just like it did back there the same can
[1:33:20] you say Amen so then why why would we
[1:33:24] think it's so unusual for God the
[1:33:27] supernatural God to work within us
[1:33:32] hello God always everybody say God
[1:33:35] always God always sends down the
[1:33:38] Supernatural on the
[1:33:41] natural amen it's not too unusual did
[1:33:45] not the supernatural fall on a brass
[1:33:48] serpent that was made out of natural
[1:33:52] material and the people were told to
[1:33:55] look on it and if they looked on it amen
[1:33:58] they would live just something natural
[1:34:01] but the supernatural had come upon the
[1:34:04] natural did not the supernatural fall
[1:34:07] upon a pool of water called the pool of
[1:34:10] Bethesda there was no healing virtue in
[1:34:12] that water but when the supernatural
[1:34:15] came up on the natural amen it then
[1:34:18] became a healing water to the
[1:34:22] people now that's why the people
[1:34:24] gathered around it they were not looking
[1:34:27] to the Natural they they were not saying
[1:34:29] oh look at the natural what what a
[1:34:31] beautiful thing and and all that we just
[1:34:33] hang out here no they were looking for
[1:34:36] the supernatural to come upon the
[1:34:41] natural can you say amen amen see did
[1:34:45] not the spirit of God Rest Upon Jesus
[1:34:50] there he said the spirit of the Lord is
[1:34:51] upon me he hath anointed me
[1:34:54] to to preach the gospel to the poor he
[1:34:56] has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[1:34:58] preach Deliverance to the captives and
[1:35:00] recovering of sight to the blind to set
[1:35:03] at Liberty them that are bruised to
[1:35:04] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[1:35:07] amen you know the prophet said that
[1:35:08] Jesus never claimed credit for healing
[1:35:12] anybody the Bible even says that amen
[1:35:15] Jesus never amen uh claimed the credit
[1:35:18] see amen he he never wanted it for in
[1:35:21] John 14:10 he said the father that
[1:35:23] dwelleth in me he doeth The Works he sat
[1:35:26] in another place I can do nothing of
[1:35:29] myself but what he was is he believed in
[1:35:33] the Supernatural he believed in the
[1:35:35] scriptures he believed what the
[1:35:37] scriptures said about him amen that's
[1:35:40] right can you say Amen so we are to
[1:35:44] watch for the Supernatural and not the
[1:35:48] natural amen can you say Amen we are to
[1:35:52] rest in the Supernatural not in the
[1:35:56] natural I get ready to
[1:35:59] close but Abraham looked for the
[1:36:01] supernatural to take
[1:36:03] place because he believed in it he
[1:36:07] believed in the Supernatural 25 long
[1:36:10] years he
[1:36:12] testified he clung to it can you say
[1:36:15] amen he had been given a promise of a
[1:36:18] son the Bible says he who against hope
[1:36:21] believed in hope he considered not the
[1:36:24] deadness of Sarah's womb nor his own
[1:36:26] body now dead he counted God Faithful
[1:36:30] that
[1:36:31] promised see he wasn't just wishing for
[1:36:34] it to happen God had given him a
[1:36:38] promise and he believed in
[1:36:41] it can you say amen he knew what the
[1:36:44] word of the Lord was ain't that right
[1:36:48] and he also knew that it would take the
[1:36:50] supernatural to perform it amen they
[1:36:53] they him and Sarah couldn't have that
[1:36:54] child the doctors couldn't produce it
[1:36:56] help him amen there was nobody I mean it
[1:36:59] they was standing there no hope
[1:37:01] whatsoever in the natural but he knew
[1:37:05] that God promised it and he believed in
[1:37:08] the Supernatural
[1:37:10] God so then it wasn't unusual to
[1:37:16] Abraham Lord when God appeared in human
[1:37:20] flesh before
[1:37:22] him
[1:37:24] hello but in Genesis
[1:37:28] 18:14 God told him at the time appointed
[1:37:31] I will return unto thee according to the
[1:37:34] time of life and Sarah shall have a son
[1:37:38] amen he didn't think that was unusual he
[1:37:42] had been expecting it he had been
[1:37:45] believing in it he knew that God would
[1:37:49] be on the
[1:37:50] scene God would honor that word can you
[1:37:53] say man the Bible says he endured seeing
[1:37:56] him who is
[1:37:58] invisible amen or Moses endured but
[1:38:02] Abraham did too Amen brother BR said he
[1:38:05] didn't have to look at the natural he's
[1:38:07] seen the supernatural all the time what
[1:38:09] are you looking at today yeah that's
[1:38:12] right he didn't have to look to the
[1:38:14] Natural he seen the supernatural all the
[1:38:20] time that's the way we want to do said
[1:38:23] is look at the Unseen and the Bible says
[1:38:26] that Sarah receiv received strength to
[1:38:30] conceive seed aren't you glad for that
[1:38:33] what was it the supernatural had come
[1:38:36] upon the
[1:38:38] natural and fulfilled his word to them
[1:38:42] he was a help in the time of trouble
[1:38:47] amen last week uh brother Terry reminded
[1:38:50] me of this quote and I wanted to read it
[1:38:52] to you but notice what brother Bram said
[1:38:55] about the church he said we've lived the
[1:38:57] time out at the time of rapture is at
[1:39:00] hand and we're looking for a rapturing
[1:39:03] faith that can pull the church together
[1:39:05] and give it some Supernatural
[1:39:08] strength that can change these bodies
[1:39:11] that we live in can you say amen amen
[1:39:16] don't look to the
[1:39:18] Natural Keep Your Eyes Upon the
[1:39:20] supernatural
[1:39:23] that's right if you look to the Natural
[1:39:25] you'll
[1:39:26] faint you'll get
[1:39:28] faint-hearted fear will grip you but if
[1:39:32] you can know that God is Supernatural
[1:39:34] and he's
[1:39:35] here he's here to give you that
[1:39:37] Supernatural strength the very God that
[1:39:40] performed a supernatural sign to Sarah
[1:39:42] and Abraham to show that it was him in
[1:39:46] flesh is the same God that done it again
[1:39:48] today to let you know he's
[1:39:51] here can you say amen amen
[1:39:54] if you look at it there in the Feast of
[1:39:57] the trumpets brother Bram said you know
[1:39:58] the National
[1:40:00] Force but Israel in her Homeland
[1:40:02] political power see was what it was
[1:40:05] National Force but Israel in her
[1:40:09] Homeland he said a national force is
[1:40:11] going to put the carinal church put the
[1:40:13] church that carinal church in the world
[1:40:16] Council of churches that's right
[1:40:20] but the supernatural power of God I I
[1:40:23] put that in the power of God will put
[1:40:27] the people in The
[1:40:29] Bride the world forces this way and that
[1:40:31] way but God forces upward and he said
[1:40:34] the spirit of God which is the word of
[1:40:36] God my word is spirit and Life we'll put
[1:40:40] the bride in her place cuz she'll
[1:40:43] recognize her position in the word then
[1:40:46] she's in Christ we'll put her in her
[1:40:48] place no National Force will do it but
[1:40:53] the National Force did Drive Israel to
[1:40:56] the Homeland the national forces of the
[1:40:58] Council of churches will drive every
[1:41:00] organization into it but the power of
[1:41:03] God will raise the bride into Glory out
[1:41:06] of it aren't you glad for that and he's
[1:41:09] here to do it and I say he is doing it
[1:41:14] the voice of God has come to bring a
[1:41:17] living God back and the supernatural
[1:41:21] manifestation it's the voice of God that
[1:41:23] does it so I say to you is there
[1:41:25] anything too hard for
[1:41:28] God come on church is there anything too
[1:41:31] hard for God Amen I is is is it too hard
[1:41:35] for God to heal a headache is it too God
[1:41:38] to heal a a a virus is it too hard for
[1:41:43] God to to heal uh uh the ears and make
[1:41:46] the deaf amen here again no no it's not
[1:41:50] too hard for God there's nothing too
[1:41:52] hard he's here as a present help can you
[1:41:56] say Amen oh I love the Lord do you love
[1:41:59] him God is present here to fulfill his
[1:42:02] word for as it was in the days of lot so
[1:42:06] shall it be when the son of man is
[1:42:09] revealed we know that the son of man has
[1:42:11] been revealed we have seen the
[1:42:13] supernatural sign done in this age
[1:42:16] brother Bram said and when we see a God
[1:42:18] that can raise the dead off the floor or
[1:42:21] out of the yard and bring him back back
[1:42:23] to life again and present him before us
[1:42:26] when we see a God who can take a cancer
[1:42:28] that's eat a man to a shadow and raise
[1:42:31] him up to a strong healthy man that
[1:42:34] ought to give rapturing Faith to the
[1:42:36] people that see that when that light
[1:42:38] flashes from the sky and the trumpet
[1:42:41] sounds the body of Christ will be
[1:42:43] quickly gathered together and changed in
[1:42:46] a moment and taken into the heavens can
[1:42:49] you say Amen that God that you have
[1:42:51] trusted to to to Supply your needs that
[1:42:54] God that you trust Amen to heal your
[1:42:56] babies that God that you trust Amen to
[1:42:59] deliver you out of the situations that
[1:43:02] God is going to change your body one of
[1:43:04] these days it's the same God and and
[1:43:07] it's happening to the same believer that
[1:43:09] has trusted him and believed him all the
[1:43:12] way through the Journey of time can you
[1:43:15] say Amen nothing's too hard for God
[1:43:20] nothing it's why we don't worry
[1:43:23] Why Should I Worry why should I fret if
[1:43:26] the musicians will come my God is
[1:43:31] greater my God is greater can you say
[1:43:35] man oh I love
[1:43:39] him brother BR said there today there
[1:43:41] are people good men fine men good
[1:43:44] character men fine ministers many of
[1:43:47] them priests and so forth are good man
[1:43:49] but the supernatural Vindication of the
[1:43:51] promise of this day is so unusual it
[1:43:54] throws them off their balance it does
[1:43:57] that because it's displaying the
[1:43:59] characteristic of God man the
[1:44:02] Supernatural is displaying the
[1:44:04] characteristics of God and it's so
[1:44:07] unusual to most people but don't let it
[1:44:09] be unusual to
[1:44:11] you don't let the supernatural be so
[1:44:14] unusual that you can't look for his help
[1:44:17] Amen in the time of trouble can you say
[1:44:20] amen amen yeah
[1:44:23] we're exercising our
[1:44:25] faith we're
[1:44:28] exercising what we believe in God to
[1:44:33] be it's not that we just sit here laying
[1:44:36] dormant and questioning and wondering if
[1:44:38] God could do this and this and this and
[1:44:40] then all of a sudden he changes us no
[1:44:43] we're believing him we're exercising our
[1:44:46] faith and putting it into action God is
[1:44:49] able God is able God's going to come
[1:44:52] through brother B God's going to come
[1:44:54] through

[1:45:07] mountain top to water

[1:45:11] chill bumps to water the power with your
[1:45:15] Praises but you realize what it is you
