[40:46] seats um I wanted to speak a little bit
[40:49] tonight on um on the unchanging God um
[40:52] it's it's it's kind of been on my heart
[40:54] for a while and um so if it seems like
[40:57] maybe from the last time I preached it's
[40:58] similar you guys have to forgive me I
[41:00] it's just been all my heart and I
[41:01] couldn't really really get get get get
[41:05] get get away from it but uh but but
[41:10] but if you look in the scripture here it
[41:12] says God in Sury times and diverse
[41:15] manners and in that sundry and divers
[41:18] man manners means in in in in in in in
[41:22] in in in in many ways and diverse ways
[41:24] have he he he he he has spoken to us
[41:29] spoken to us through through through the
[41:32] prophets um but and and what he's done
[41:35] is he's identified himself to us through
[41:38] the prophets um um throughout the Old
[41:41] Testament and so so so so so so so so we
[41:43] notice now now that um that that that
[41:46] that that he has he's showcasing his
[41:49] characteristics of himself by
[41:51] identifying himself to us to us through
[41:55] through the prophets through the
[41:58] prophets throughout the Old Testament
[42:00] he's he's he's um and but but and and
[42:04] and brother brand and brother brand
[42:07] brother brandham said it was the
[42:08] prophets and their Visions Vindicated
[42:11] who God's characteristics was it was
[42:14] made known by the prophets by the
[42:15] prophets visions and and he says and he
[42:19] says and he says and in in in another
[42:22] place he says it's God's placing he
[42:25] sends a man takes the word of that age
[42:27] but now before you can believe that word
[42:30] of that age he identifies himself in his
[42:33] characteristics see by knowledge by by
[42:35] Vision he told things that would
[42:37] happened and it happens and God said
[42:39] when that happens when when when when
[42:41] you believe he has the interpretation of
[42:43] the word because the word of the Lord
[42:45] comes to this man and his and his and
[42:49] his and
[42:50] his credentials he is identified by
[42:54] being a seer in the Old Testament just
[42:56] as plain as can be his characteristics
[42:58] is identified made known his characters
[43:02] so so so so so so so so we know we know
[43:06] we know we know we know with the
[43:08] scriptures and and and with what the
[43:09] prophet has taught us that that that
[43:11] that that that that the prophets were
[43:15] was God was God to to those people in
[43:18] the Old Testament um Jesus said Jesus
[43:22] said if if you call them if you call
[43:24] them who the word of who who the word of
[43:26] God came to God God he said how can you
[43:28] how can you condemn me when I say I'm
[43:30] the Son of God see see so so so so so
[43:34] where the word that's been spoken by God
[43:36] is Vindicated then that's then that's
[43:39] been spoken by God is a Vindicated and
[43:41] this brother brandom said then that is
[43:43] god making himself known by his
[43:45] characteristics fulfilling his word it
[43:48] needs no interpretation it's already
[43:50] interpreted itself it proves what it is
[43:53] just the same as he said let there be
[43:55] light and there was light you don't have
[43:56] to say well what did that means it just
[43:58] means there it is that proves it it's
[44:01] already come to pass now Jesus said if I
[44:04] do not the works of my father or other
[44:05] words if you if you don't have the
[44:08] characteristics of my father don't
[44:10] believe it they they identify my
[44:12] character who I am if you can't believe
[44:15] me then I believe the identification
[44:17] that God has has then believe the
[44:20] identification that God has that God has
[44:23] given he he said he said he said if my
[44:26] if my character identify my my my
[44:29] position then don't believe my claims a
[44:33] a amen so so so so we notice now if when
[44:36] Jesus come come come he couldn't have
[44:38] come with with with with Noah with with
[44:41] with with Noah's message he had to come
[44:45] with with with the message for his day
[44:47] and and if Jesus had had showed up and
[44:49] was preaching that that God was going
[44:51] what that God was going to to to to send
[44:56] a flood we we we would see that it was
[44:58] out of the the the season because God
[45:00] had placed Noah in his time in his
[45:02] season to preach to preach that that
[45:04] that a FL was coming and and a a and and
[45:09] to board the ark we notice that Noah was
[45:11] the only man the only man that that that
[45:14] could have have have preached that Moses
[45:16] couldn't have preached it and Noah
[45:17] couldn't have preach preached preached
[45:18] preached preached preached Moses's
[45:23] Moses's this message each man had to
[45:25] preach what God sent to them in their
[45:27] time and then their place and their
[45:29] calling if if they came in in in in in
[45:32] any in any other time it wouldn't have
[45:34] worked because
[45:37] um but now we notice though that that
[45:39] Noah was God and a portion Moses was God
[45:43] was God was God in a in a portion they
[45:47] were made they were made
[45:49] manifested fested in in in in in their
[45:53] word for for their hour they were the
[45:55] word made made expressed for their hour
[45:58] but Jesus could not come in their age
[46:01] and and and and and die and Jesus Jesus
[46:05] Jesus could not come come in that in
[46:07] that way because it was out of the time
[46:09] and out of the season and besides that
[46:11] the Bible had never said that that that
[46:14] that he was he was going to he was going
[46:16] to he was going to come come that come
[46:19] come that that that that that way but
[46:22] but but brother brand brother brandom
[46:24] said when he come expressed exactly like
[46:26] the New Testament exactly like the Old
[46:28] Testament had said he he said that he
[46:31] that that he would be expressed and all
[46:33] those who who was who was re redeemable
[46:37] believed it because they were the
[46:38] thoughts of God the attributes of him at
[46:41] the beginning was made flesh and
[46:43] redeemable and was brought back to God
[46:45] as many as received him to them gave he
[46:48] the power to become the sons of God
[46:50] because they were they was re re
[46:53] redeemable they were from the beginning
[46:56] in the expression
[46:58] and and and in Joel 2 2 22 in Joel
[47:03] 228 he he he he um
[47:07] brother brother brand said he promised
[47:09] that in these last days there would be a
[47:11] latter rain poured out upon the people
[47:13] in the last days and I think the Greek
[47:15] word there is kenos which means that he
[47:18] emptied himself out not in the way that
[47:21] we would say like something was inside
[47:22] of of of of somebody that that he
[47:25] emptied out but he poured him himself
[47:27] out he changed he he he said it his inor
[47:31] he changed from what he was to to what
[47:33] he is he never changes his nature but on
[47:36] the day of but on the day of Pentecost
[47:39] he changed himself from being the son of
[47:41] man to the Son of God he came not he he
[47:44] he he came not he came not with the
[47:46] people he he he came in the people see
[47:49] the same God to carry his ministry on
[47:52] through in this great age and in Joel 2
[47:55] 2:28 it says and it shall come to pass
[47:58] that that I will pour out my spirit upon
[48:00] All Flesh and your sons and your
[48:02] daughters shall prophesy and your old
[48:03] men shall dream dreams and your young
[48:05] man shall see Visions so so a
[48:08] supernatural God had rose up had rose up
[48:10] Jesus Jesus Jesus supernaturally he and
[48:15] and and and he presented him alive alive
[48:18] alive to to to to to to to the Earth
[48:22] that in Abraham's seed in these last
[48:24] days in in in the last days he would
[48:26] show that same Supernatural seed that
[48:29] super seed in these last days that that
[48:31] that the same seed that he showed in
[48:33] Jesus's day and the same seed that he
[48:35] showed in in Abraham's day he was going
[48:37] to show again in these last days it says
[48:39] as it was in the days of lot so shall it
[48:42] be in the days of the coming of the son
[48:44] of man why and and and where where where
[48:50] where where when th when those three men
[48:53] showed up showed up out there on the
[48:55] Plains and two of them went went down
[48:58] there to to to Sodom and
[49:00] Gomorrah and the one man and the one man
[49:03] stayed
[49:06] back and and he asked Abraham he said
[49:08] where is thy wife Sarah and he said
[49:10] she's in the tent behind you and Sarah
[49:12] laughed up up up her her her sleeve and
[49:16] and and and and and and Abraham called
[49:18] him Elohim Elohim the the the the god
[49:22] manifested in flesh turned turn turn to
[49:24] Abraham and said why did Sarah laugh and
[49:26] and and brother bandam said said that
[49:29] that that same Supernatural seed that
[49:32] that that was that was his super sign
[49:34] showing his characteristics showing just
[49:36] exactly who he was turned he turned he
[49:39] he when when he turned to Abraham and
[49:41] and he said why did why did why did did
[49:44] did did did did laugh and from that
[49:48] Vindicated sign there was not another
[49:50] one all the way up until Christ walked
[49:51] the Earth
[49:53] Earth Earth Earth when God when God
[49:55] Vindicated or when Christ Vindicated the
[49:58] hearts and lives of man man there was
[50:00] there has never been another one has has
[50:01] never been another one has never been
[50:03] another one since then until the days of
[50:05] of willing of brandom and and these last
[50:09] days when when when those two men and
[50:12] brother brandom called them called them
[50:13] Billy Graham and and and and Oral
[50:18] Roberts and they came to preach he
[50:20] brother rown called it to the
[50:23] denominational people he said he he he
[50:25] said he he said he he
[50:28] and and and and he said he said when
[50:32] Elohim stayed behind and talk and talked
[50:34] and talk to Abraham that was that was to
[50:37] the bride and and and and and those
[50:40] other two was was to the denominational
[50:42] churches trying to pull the people out
[50:44] out out out out of of
[50:49] judgment but but yet but yet we look we
[50:51] can see it's not a theological sign it's
[50:55] it wasn't it was wasn't a um a um um a a
[50:59] psychological sign it was a super it was
[51:01] a supernatural sign it was our super
[51:04] sign that that go pointing out what God
[51:06] was to show us again in these last days
[51:09] what was it it was a messiah in in in in
[51:11] human flesh it was a super sign the Holy
[51:14] Ghost the Holy Ghost the resurrected the
[51:17] resurrected Messiah living in a people
[51:20] it's it's he's in the seat of
[51:22] Abraham it it becomes this and brother
[51:25] Ram said it's the same Supernatural seed
[51:27] will believe like their father a a
[51:31] Abra did if they are the same seed they
[51:34] will believe the same sign he said Glory
[51:37] he said he said two of them went down
[51:39] and preached and and preached in and
[51:41] preached in Sodom which is a modern
[51:43] testimony testimony testimony today
[51:46] those are three classes of of people
[51:48] Sodom and the church in Sodom and
[51:50] Abraham the the elected is not in the
[51:54] and or say Abraham the elected is not in
[51:56] Sodom two Messengers a modern Billy
[51:59] Graham and and remember of all the
[52:01] messengers of all the messengers of all
[52:03] the messengers to the church there's
[52:05] never been a man that went out in that
[52:06] in that church in that church in that
[52:09] church nominal nominal out there ending
[52:12] ending his name with hm
[52:14] before he said it's been a finny sanki
[52:17] Knox Calvin and so forth Billy Sunday
[52:19] and everything else but never g r a h a
[52:21] or anything ending with h which means
[52:24] the father of Nations and there he went
[52:27] he went that he went down there down
[52:29] there preaching he said look at the hour
[52:31] he's the make Believers unbelievers and
[52:33] and the Believers he he said there's
[52:36] there's three men come two of them went
[52:38] down to a city a modern Billy Graham and
[52:40] an Oral Roberts and Oral Roberts down
[52:42] amongst the people preaching the setting
[52:44] Jesus referred referred referred to it
[52:47] so so so so we can sit there and sit
[52:49] back and and and and and and we can now
[52:52] see that these denominational churches
[52:54] are just in Sodom and Gomorrah they will
[52:57] and that's and that's all they
[52:59] are but yeah that's why we as as as as
[53:03] message Believers we have to take them
[53:06] we have to take them to a living God to
[53:08] a living to a living to a living reality
[53:10] showing exactly who this promises seed
[53:13] is those those those those angels those
[53:16] angels that that that that that that
[53:19] that that went down there they they
[53:21] never discuss the promises with them
[53:23] they they they they
[53:25] never discuss
[53:27] did did discuss um um a Abraham's
[53:33] ham Abraham's SE see coming forth the
[53:37] only thing thing that they preached was
[53:39] get out right so so so we as the bride
[53:41] of Christ and we as message Believers
[53:43] can can sit here and see and and see the
[53:46] trouble that's all around us we it is
[53:48] our I feel like it's our solemn Duty and
[53:50] and and and and and and and and and and
[53:53] should be our our great honor to sit
[53:55] there and as brother brother Shan has
[53:56] been preaching to present the message of
[53:58] Jesus Christ C Christ to a dying people
[54:02] why because the Baptist they have
[54:03] nothing to offer methodists have nothing
[54:05] to offer Pentecostals have nothing to
[54:07] offer anymore why because because they
[54:09] are dead and dried up at the roots the
[54:11] bride of Christ is coming forth in such
[54:13] a great power and and an authority where
[54:16] where she can stand forth with all
[54:18] authority and all Assurance assurance
[54:20] and declaring that Jesus Christ is alive
[54:23] in our midst M mid midst still um
[54:26] so so so so um um um and so we get to
[54:32] look at now the the um um Abraham called
[54:36] him called him called called that man
[54:39] Elohim and which which means he all
[54:42] sufficient one he he's he he was
[54:44] identified in a human body body and he
[54:47] sat there and he ate the and he ate the
[54:49] meat of a calf and and and drank the
[54:51] milk and and and and and and but but yet
[54:54] Elohim identified the characteristics of
[54:57] of God God and sunre times and diverse
[54:59] manner spake to us but go Elohim
[55:02] identified the characteristics of God
[55:04] and Abraham called him God he was
[55:07] identified as
[55:08] Elohim and and and and the Bible said
[55:11] that it said that that Abraham's body
[55:12] was as good as dead and Sarah womb and
[55:15] Sarah's womb was all dried up but yet
[55:19] Abraham but but Abraham staggered not at
[55:21] the promise of God when when it seemed
[55:23] like all when see when it seemed like
[55:25] that all that that all of hell that all
[55:27] of hell that all of hell was against him
[55:30] he was able to stand on that on that
[55:32] promise knowing knowing that he that he
[55:34] that he that he who had made the promise
[55:37] was just and willing and willing to to
[55:39] to to to to to to fulfill it right um um
[55:44] um um in Elohim that self-existing one
[55:47] Elohim in in in human flesh again in
[55:50] these last days what was it a sign
[55:53] of brother random that
[55:57] said said said brother brother random
[56:00] said what what is it is it a sign of
[56:02] Elohim back in the bride again human
[56:05] flesh in the last days doing the same
[56:08] thing where is it at there's your sign
[56:10] for these last days why when when and in
[56:14] Zechariah and Zechariah 14:7 says there
[56:17] can there will be a day that that that
[56:19] that that cannot be called day day day
[56:23] nor night it's a dismal a rainy day like
[56:25] like like um but it says in the evening
[56:28] time it shall be light and
[56:31] and and as the sun as the sun will rise
[56:34] in the in the East and sets in the west
[56:37] so so so so so has has has has has has
[56:43] Christianity as as we all know but but
[56:47] but but they've had
[56:48] organizations they've had just enough
[56:50] light to build to build churches and
[56:51] organizations and and seminaries
[56:54] and but but but but but but yet just
[56:57] dust enough light to sit there and say
[56:59] to sign their name on a book and accept
[57:00] Christ
[57:02] and and to say oh I'm I'm a Pentecostal
[57:05] or I'm a Methodist or I'm a Baptist but
[57:07] brother Bram said in the evening light
[57:09] in the evening time it shall be light
[57:11] what is that he said that Gospel Light
[57:13] what does that do the holy spirit is
[57:15] what does it it ripens the crop in the
[57:18] last days the holy spirit will pour out
[57:21] in time in the last days to bring in the
[57:23] latter rain the real rain but first how
[57:26] how how how how he said that but first
[57:29] how are you going to H how you going to
[57:31] have a rain when we're still planting
[57:33] denominational seeds bringing forth more
[57:36] more more unbelief all the time he said
[57:39] why don't you plant the gospel seed and
[57:41] bring forth the power of God in the
[57:43] resurrection there's the Last Day signs
[57:46] this is his promise
[57:48] friends
[57:50] and in another
[57:53] place in another place he said this
[57:55] stumps grow has grow from Wesley through
[57:57] Luther to to to Wesley to Pentecost and
[58:00] now it's honing out these Pentecostals
[58:02] and all them and all those that's got
[58:04] the bapt that the baptism of the Holy
[58:06] Ghost and shall come someday The
[58:08] Headstone Jesus Christ in these last
[58:10] days and we will have a we will have to
[58:13] have a Ministry just exactly like his
[58:16] like like his whole Spirit as it gets
[58:18] closer and closer and closer the
[58:21] negative becomes so positive that after
[58:23] while that after while the negative and
[58:25] and positive and positive have blend
[58:27] blend negative and positive Blends
[58:29] together Christ and and church to make
[58:31] one for we're flesh of his flesh and
[58:34] bone of his bone amen we believe it it
[58:36] shall be light in the evening time amen
[58:39] we're here we're uh we are here we are
[58:41] here today you you believe it so so so
[58:46] so so we look at um at grafting these
[58:49] trees and
[58:50] stuff brother random has has talked
[58:52] about this many times and and and I
[58:54] would really encourage anybody to to go
[58:56] and listen to it because it it's quite
[58:58] powerful what he says but but how how
[59:01] how you this farmer could could take a
[59:04] tree and it might be an orange tree
[59:06] let's say it's in the Citrus say it's
[59:08] it's it's in the citrus family and it
[59:10] because it comes up the the original
[59:12] tree is an orange but they've started to
[59:14] cut they would Graft in these lemons um
[59:17] um grapefruit anything
[59:20] Citrus anything anything that with
[59:22] Citrus it would be grafted in and it
[59:25] would take root and take life and and
[59:28] and every year after year that same
[59:29] branch that was grafted would produce a
[59:32] lemon or it would produce or the other
[59:33] Branch might produce a grapefruit and
[59:35] the other Branch the original Branch
[59:36] will keep on on on on on producing an
[59:41] orange year after year after year but
[59:44] but but yet when we as when we as the
[59:46] bride of Christ when that when that
[59:48] Sprout that came up that that that came
[59:50] up and and It produced an an orange an
[59:52] orange
[59:53] branch and yet all these denominational
[59:56] kept graft again and graft again and
[59:57] graft again but yet in these last days
[59:59] it has put forth another branch and that
[1:00:01] and that
[1:00:03] branch and and and and and that original
[1:00:07] tree is the Bride of Jesus Christ and
[1:00:10] she has put forth her herself another
[1:00:12] branch and the bride the bride has come
[1:00:14] forth has come forth standing and she
[1:00:17] and and she is just like and she is just
[1:00:20] like the original which is Christ why
[1:00:24] why because each each
[1:00:28] each but yet each each each each one of
[1:00:32] these branches it's it's it's coming
[1:00:34] forth that they that they that they've
[1:00:35] drafted in it's just suck it's just
[1:00:38] sucking on the life of on the life of of
[1:00:41] of of that original tree and and they
[1:00:43] and they might they might can say oh I'm
[1:00:45] a Christian I'm a Christian see see me
[1:00:47] I'm attached I'm attached here but but
[1:00:50] yet it's not of the original why why
[1:00:53] it's nothing it has become nothing but a
[1:00:55] hybrid dried up dried up denominational
[1:00:58] branch and and and and and and someday
[1:01:01] soon and someday soon she's going to be
[1:01:03] hued off and thrown in the
[1:01:06] fire and and and and and now the
[1:01:10] original the original tree has put forth
[1:01:12] another Branch when when when Christ
[1:01:15] when Christ was in the ground and and up
[1:01:17] came and it started coming up on up
[1:01:19] through through through through through
[1:01:21] Luther and Wesley and the Pentecostals
[1:01:23] and now it's come forth and and it's
[1:01:24] manifested itself
[1:01:26] another original branch and it has come
[1:01:28] forth as the bride of Christ it is the
[1:01:30] same exact same exact thing that had
[1:01:33] went go down and died has come forth up
[1:01:36] again the original the exact same thing
[1:01:38] we are Christ in these last days why
[1:01:42] because so now that that says we have
[1:01:44] the same exact Authority the same
[1:01:48] exact exact attributes that Christ had
[1:01:52] with what Christ had died for every
[1:01:54] attribute that that that that Christ
[1:01:56] died for we can now stand in all
[1:01:58] assurance and all confidence knowing
[1:02:01] knowing that we are of that of of of
[1:02:03] that original tree why we can stand
[1:02:07] here with all authority and all
[1:02:10] confidence in and the winds can blow the
[1:02:13] the the the the storms may come at us
[1:02:15] but what we have an anchor we can stand
[1:02:17] here with all confidence and all
[1:02:19] authority Jesus said that I am the vine
[1:02:21] and ye are the branches if and and and
[1:02:26] and and and and if that if that the
[1:02:29] first branch has put forth um love joy
[1:02:32] and loyalty and the fruits of the spirit
[1:02:35] that the the next original branch has to
[1:02:37] put forth the same exact thing if if if
[1:02:41] if if that original if if if that
[1:02:43] original branch that um um um um um um
[1:02:47] um spoken tongues cast out Spirits
[1:02:50] believed in in water baptism in the name
[1:02:52] of Jesus Christ and and and and and and
[1:02:56] that that that that next branch has to
[1:02:58] come forth and and produce the same
[1:03:00] exact
[1:03:01] thing we're not going to sit there and
[1:03:04] and keep going well if we just sprinkle
[1:03:06] Lord if you baptize in the name of the
[1:03:07] father Son and Holy Ghost or or or or
[1:03:10] the days of Miracles has passed or or or
[1:03:13] or or or God don't move exactly like you
[1:03:16] like like like you used to anymore
[1:03:17] that's nothing but a grafted
[1:03:19] denominational denominational rotten
[1:03:22] Branch but but but and and brother Rand
[1:03:26] said any church that's professing to be
[1:03:28] Christian Christians Thrive off of the
[1:03:30] glory and Praises of Christ but it can't
[1:03:33] bear the fruit it won't bear it won't
[1:03:35] bear The Life of Christ until Christ
[1:03:37] puts forth that Branch himself then
[1:03:40] it'll write another book of Acts behind
[1:03:43] it because it's the acts of the holy
[1:03:45] spirit in the church see that's the way
[1:03:47] it is tonight Jesus Christ is the same
[1:03:50] yesterday today and forever so that's
[1:03:53] why I say it's it's so important say
[1:03:56] exactly what's on those
[1:03:57] tapes why because it is the original it
[1:04:00] is the original
[1:04:02] Pentecostal the original Pentecost back
[1:04:05] in our midst again um so so so so we can
[1:04:08] sit there and look at it and see and see
[1:04:11] that God had taken one man and and and
[1:04:13] in in the
[1:04:14] wilderness he uh he he he he he he he he
[1:04:20] he he he he trained him up and brought
[1:04:23] him back and and and and and and and and
[1:04:26] and and and he came back and took the
[1:04:28] thing over and brought the children of
[1:04:30] Israel and brought the children of
[1:04:32] Israel out out out of the land of Egypt
[1:04:35] but but God cannot ever change his his
[1:04:38] program he is God he he he will and
[1:04:42] brother Bram said that he never deals he
[1:04:44] never deals wi with a group he never did
[1:04:47] he says he deals with an individual and
[1:04:49] he said he did and he will and he's
[1:04:51] promised even in Malachi 4 he would do
[1:04:53] it again that's right so then there is
[1:04:56] his promise what he was promis what he
[1:04:58] said that that that what he said
[1:05:03] that he said what he would do and here
[1:05:07] we are what a people happy we should be
[1:05:09] given them the sign by his promised word
[1:05:12] sign promised word his promise that he
[1:05:15] would do it and they shall restore the
[1:05:17] hearts of the faith of the people and
[1:05:19] the hearts of the people back to the
[1:05:20] faith of the original Pentecostal
[1:05:22] fathers he promised to do it showing he
[1:05:25] he
[1:05:26] his his signs prise the Lord
[1:05:29] yes and and and as it was in the days of
[1:05:32] Sodom so shall it be again in the day in
[1:05:35] the days in the days of the coming of
[1:05:37] the coming of the son of man they shall
[1:05:39] eat they shall drink they they shall be
[1:05:41] they shall give in marriage they shall
[1:05:43] they shall be taken in
[1:05:45] marriage but but yet while all the all
[1:05:48] the Sodom when all the Sodom conditions
[1:05:51] is is is is is is going around round up
[1:05:54] up in on the back back side of the
[1:05:56] desert is Elohim and Abraham communing
[1:05:59] one onone they they they are
[1:06:00] fellowshipping with each other they're
[1:06:02] walking and they're talking with each
[1:06:04] other and and honestly whatever's
[1:06:05] happening in Sodom is happening in Sodom
[1:06:08] we as a bride of Christ can sit there
[1:06:10] and sit back and commune with with
[1:06:12] Elohim God manifested in flush again and
[1:06:17] and it doesn't matter matter matter what
[1:06:19] comes our way it doesn't matter the
[1:06:21] storm's going to blow all hell can come
[1:06:23] against us we are in community we are in
[1:06:26] fellowship with with Elohim God in flesh
[1:06:30] again why as it was in the days of lot
[1:06:33] so shall it be in the days of the coming
[1:06:34] of the son of
[1:06:36] man we see the Holy Spirit Among Us he's
[1:06:39] working Among Us he's doing the same
[1:06:42] things he's working in human flesh again
[1:06:44] it's the hour see we're
[1:06:47] just we're we're we are here we are at
[1:06:49] the threshold of the coming of the Son
[1:06:51] of God where we get to go home and
[1:06:53] exodus is on why
[1:06:58] [Music]
[1:07:00] why it it's just the same Holy Spirit
[1:07:03] again
[1:07:04] tonight and and and that he promised
[1:07:07] that he would send in these last days
[1:07:09] that same holy spirit that fell that
[1:07:11] fell that fell on on the days of
[1:07:13] Pentecost cost is here again is here
[1:07:15] again tonight why because because he's
[1:07:18] walking with us he's talking with us
[1:07:20] he's communing with us he's living and
[1:07:22] breathing through us why when when he
[1:07:25] promised us in Mark 16 go ye into all
[1:07:28] the world and preach the gospel to Every
[1:07:30] Creature oh um and these signs shall
[1:07:33] follow them that that that that that
[1:07:37] that these signs shall follow them that
[1:07:39] Bel why and it's not it's not for the
[1:07:42] unbeliever it's not for the makeb
[1:07:43] believer it's not it's not it's not for
[1:07:45] them that's down in Sodom it's for us
[1:07:47] here on the back side of the desert with
[1:07:49] with with our God why why because
[1:07:52] because he's promised us the former
[1:07:54] Reign and the latter reign and and and
[1:07:56] and and and and brother R said now said
[1:07:58] we're living now and have been for years
[1:08:01] under the latter rain see and and he
[1:08:04] says here in another spot he says so the
[1:08:06] hour has come for the repeat of the
[1:08:08] Bible and the fulfilling of the word now
[1:08:11] God promised that he was going to send a
[1:08:13] former rain and a latter rain and he
[1:08:15] promised the former and the latter rain
[1:08:17] in the latter rain or no he promised the
[1:08:19] former rain and the latter rain yeah in
[1:08:22] the latter rain so in other words it's a
[1:08:24] double portion like the Garment of
[1:08:27] Elisha when Elijah when Elijah dropped
[1:08:30] it Elisha picked it up and had a double
[1:08:32] portion he was a type he was he was a
[1:08:36] type as a type of the of the church and
[1:08:38] Christ Christ was taken up and The Same
[1:08:41] Spirit and the same spirit that was upon
[1:08:43] Christ is on the church on is is on the
[1:08:46] church is on the church on the church
[1:08:48] tonight the Holy Ghost see NE never
[1:08:51] never nevertheless if you see me go away
[1:08:54] is he and took the Garment and now he
[1:08:56] struck the Jordan said let the he where
[1:08:59] be the god of Elijah let the god of
[1:09:01] Elijah speak speak to us and and and and
[1:09:07] and yet we have so many people even in
[1:09:08] in these message ranks that say oh it's
[1:09:10] it's it's it's psychology or it's a
[1:09:12] mental it's a mental telepathy or oh
[1:09:14] that was just his opinion or or or or or
[1:09:18] or or or whatever whatever it is
[1:09:21] whatever it is they may say God has
[1:09:23] shown his super sign again in these last
[1:09:26] days who where where where where he sat
[1:09:28] there when he was s there he was he was
[1:09:30] Discerning the thoughts and intents of
[1:09:32] the hearts and the audiences and he said
[1:09:33] so you may know and he turns around with
[1:09:36] his back to the audience and starts
[1:09:38] calling him out showing that's the same
[1:09:40] super sign the same Supernatural God
[1:09:43] that that that was that was in the flesh
[1:09:45] of Elohim in those last days and the
[1:09:47] same flesh that was in Christ it came
[1:09:50] came to flesh in these last days again
[1:09:52] showing that he is the same yesterday
[1:09:54] today and for forever and we as the
[1:09:56] bride say amen he says I'll pour out my
[1:09:59] spirit upon All
[1:10:01] Flesh well there will be a former rain
[1:10:03] and and and a latter
[1:10:05] rain where the former and and latter
[1:10:08] rain would come together as a double
[1:10:09] portion and we as a bride of Christ can
[1:10:12] sit here and just and be and and be the
[1:10:14] Bene the beneficiaries of all of it
[1:10:18] where and brother R says says that that
[1:10:22] then if we see what the former Reign has
[1:10:24] with the former rain produced how much
[1:10:27] more will the latter rain will the
[1:10:29] latter rain will the latter rain produce
[1:10:32] when God pours out his Spirit there will
[1:10:34] be signs and wonders wonder and wonders
[1:10:36] and wonders and wonders take place as I
[1:10:38] was speaking not not long ago he said
[1:10:41] when omnipotent speaks miracles happen
[1:10:44] it has to and that word word word and
[1:10:47] that and that word and that
[1:10:49] word omnipotence means means means
[1:10:53] basically it's I can't the exact
[1:10:55] definition of but but it basically means
[1:10:57] the Mighty God the the he who cannot be
[1:11:00] defeated he who who is everything he he
[1:11:03] he he he's he's he he's everything to
[1:11:05] everyone and why because so so when we
[1:11:10] when so when God has spoken forth
[1:11:13] Miracles Miracles just start happening
[1:11:16] why why because because because the
[1:11:17] Mighty God has spoken and we who are of
[1:11:20] that original vine have have spoken back
[1:11:23] amen and we receive it amen and in
[1:11:26] Exodus 14:1 he says and they said on on
[1:11:31] onto Moses because there were no graves
[1:11:34] in in in in in in in because there were
[1:11:37] no graves in Egypt hast thou taken us
[1:11:40] away to die to die in in the wilderness
[1:11:43] wherefore hast thou dealt has thou as
[1:11:46] thou dealt with us to carry us forth out
[1:11:48] of Egypt and said is is not this the
[1:11:51] word that we did tell thee in Egypt
[1:11:53] saying let us alone that we may serve
[1:11:54] the egyp Egyptians for it had been
[1:11:57] better for us to serve the Egyptians
[1:11:58] that than than than that we should die
[1:12:01] in in in in the wilderness and Moses
[1:12:03] said on un un un Moses said unto the
[1:12:08] people fear ye not and stand still and
[1:12:10] see the salvation of the Lord which he
[1:12:13] will show you today for the Egyptians
[1:12:16] whom ye have seen today ye shall see
[1:12:18] them again no more forever and the Lord
[1:12:21] shall fight for you and ye shall hold
[1:12:23] your peace and and the Lord said unto
[1:12:26] Moses wherefore criest thou c c criest
[1:12:28] thou unto me speak unto the children of
[1:12:31] Israel that they go
[1:12:34] forward so so so so so those those those
[1:12:40] that children the
[1:12:42] the children of of of Israel will sat
[1:12:45] there and there were all congreg Cong
[1:12:47] congregated around Moses and all of a
[1:12:49] sudden that Red Sea begin to open up and
[1:12:51] they begin to March through it and when
[1:12:52] they and they and as they begin to March
[1:12:55] through it all night
[1:12:57] long it was all night long and as they
[1:13:00] marched as they marched on that their
[1:13:02] hopes begin to get better and they began
[1:13:04] to get stronger and and and they C and
[1:13:06] they and when they cross when they
[1:13:08] crossed the that sea and they stood and
[1:13:11] they stood on the opposite bank and when
[1:13:13] that Red Sea rolled in rolled rolled in
[1:13:16] in in in around
[1:13:18] the the the armies of the
[1:13:21] Egyptian those people who had who had
[1:13:24] enslaved them for 400 years and and and
[1:13:27] you guys realize that America's only
[1:13:28] been here for 250 Years or or so
[1:13:31] something like that so when you realize
[1:13:33] that it's over almost double of how the
[1:13:35] the age of America that these Israelis
[1:13:38] had had had had had had had had been had
[1:13:42] been had been enslaved but yet when you
[1:13:46] think about that and and yet and and yet
[1:13:49] they stood on the banks and watched that
[1:13:51] Red Sea rolling around their enemies and
[1:13:53] and they realized that those Egyptians
[1:13:55] that had beat them day in and day
[1:13:58] out when they were when they when they
[1:14:00] were hungry when they were
[1:14:03] hungry they just stayed hungry they they
[1:14:05] got
[1:14:07] beaten their victory was stolen from
[1:14:09] them year after year after year but yet
[1:14:12] but yet when they stood when they stood
[1:14:14] on that opposite bank and seen those
[1:14:17] Egyptians they would never see no more
[1:14:20] when they seen that God had totally
[1:14:21] wiped them out brother random said said
[1:14:24] said that it had started an old faster
[1:14:26] fashioned Pentecostal Campground meeting
[1:14:29] he he said he said he he said he said he
[1:14:34] said brother if this is the latter ring
[1:14:36] that must have been the former rain
[1:14:37] hallelujah what was it the same Holy
[1:14:40] Ghost the same Pillar of Fire that same
[1:14:43] Redeemer walking in light moving on on
[1:14:46] on on on on he's moving on what a time
[1:14:49] he said and then those Jews that had
[1:14:51] seen their slaves Masters who had beaten
[1:14:53] them who had enslaved them were were
[1:14:55] dead when they were dead and and and and
[1:14:58] and and and and the bottom of the sea
[1:15:01] brother they got to rejoicing they got
[1:15:02] to
[1:15:03] dancing and and and had grabbed a
[1:15:06] tambourine and she began to dance up and
[1:15:08] down that beach why brother B said it's
[1:15:10] a dance of
[1:15:12] Victory why and when we as the bride of
[1:15:15] Christ Christ can stand here and see for
[1:15:18] see all the victories that God that God
[1:15:20] has has has done for us when when we can
[1:15:22] when we can look around us and see that
[1:15:24] what that devil has tried to Rob us year
[1:15:26] after year after year after of our
[1:15:28] blessings when we can stand forth and
[1:15:31] realize just who we are and all
[1:15:33] authority and all power that God that
[1:15:36] God has wiped out the Egyptians from our
[1:15:39] Lives why it be it it it it it it it can
[1:15:44] cause a shout with us it can cause a
[1:15:46] dance with us why it's a dance of
[1:15:48] Victory it brother Ram says it always
[1:15:52] takes the miraculous to to speak of of
[1:15:55] of of of of of of omnipotence
[1:15:59] omnipotence is the all powerful and it
[1:16:02] takes the miraculous to vindicate to
[1:16:04] vindicate the the omnipotence and the
[1:16:07] all and only the miraculous can can can
[1:16:10] can do that so so so so so so you know
[1:16:14] it always takes the miraculous to
[1:16:16] vindicate to to to vindicate that the
[1:16:18] that the omnipotent still lives and
[1:16:20] still Reigns and brother R said we must
[1:16:23] have the miraculous when omnipotent
[1:16:25] speaks miracles happen when the when
[1:16:28] when the all powerful almighty God
[1:16:30] speaks and Goes Forth forth Miracles
[1:16:33] have to happen Satan cannot cannot stand
[1:16:36] before the bride of Christ when when his
[1:16:38] word has gone forth and when we as a
[1:16:40] bride of Christ when we as that same
[1:16:43] original fruit that Christ was was when
[1:16:45] when when when when we can speak speak
[1:16:48] speak Miracles have to happen because we
[1:16:50] have omnipotence in in us why because
[1:16:53] because because we are
[1:16:55] the the the the the we are the the the
[1:16:58] the the the fully Vindicated bride of
[1:17:00] Christ we are heirs and Joint HS with
[1:17:03] with Christ nothing can ever stand
[1:17:05] before us again it says I and brother
[1:17:09] ROM said I believe that the church is
[1:17:10] now standing on the threshold of the
[1:17:13] greatest Vindication of omnipotence that
[1:17:15] the world has ever known oh my we are we
[1:17:19] we we have been Vindicated we have seen
