and again and again he's the same God today oh oh yes he is yesterday and forever he's always the same there's no reason to doubt God can do it again amen amen well do you love the Lord the musicians can be dismissed and it's good to just have everyone uh back that was gone over the weekend and um and just glad that we still have this opportunity to come together and uh uh just to uh gather around the word of the Lord amen and if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to uh Psalms the 46th chapter amen and I here it's uh brother Branson's birthday today and so we want to wish him a happy birthday amen and uh I sure appreciate brother Branson and um we just have enjoyed him being our son-in-law amen and uh uh just pray that the Lord just blesses him in a mighty way amen and um um so we want to uh look at uh Psalms the 46th chapter first verse it says God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble amen let's just bow our heads in a just ask our Lord to help us tonight father Lord we're nothing without you and the more we live we have this understanding that we need you father that you are God and you're Supreme and there's nothing that can Dethrone you no problem that we Face there's nothing impossible with you and Lord we're just asking that you would feel welcome here this evening and that you would just be free to move and have your way father Lord and the things that may be that is not right with you or uh pleasing to you in our lives we'd ask that you would take it out father and God remode us and shape us and to your image for we want to be more like you father I pray father that you would just give us the grace now and help me to get myself out of the way and may the people be ready and willing to receive father is our prayer in Jesus Christ's name in the church says amen amen you can have your seats this evening and uh beautiful day today and um I'll take these kind of days amen and um uh nice and warm amen and uh well it was at our house anyways but uh we uh just appreciate the Lord amen and uh um I uh you know we we understand by the Bible and by the signs of the time that we are living in the age of rapture it is the time of rapture and and um uh that word rapture uh is means to be carried away caught up and so you know uh some people would would argue with you on that word rapture it's not in the Bible but really it it the Bible does say we will be caught up to meet the Lord in the air we're going to be carried away to uh to meet him and so so Rapture that's that's what Rapture is and I just looked up this word the phrase caught up I guess that's what you would call it but caught up means to seize to snatch to pluck to pull take by force to take for oneself and so th this is what the Rapture is and I believe that the Rapture has to do with more than just being CAU up in in Revelation uh I I think that's part of it but um uh Enoch being our type the seventh from Adam and he was the type of us um uh didn't just receive Revelation even though he did rece receive Revelation but uh uh Genesis 5:24 tells us that Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him ain't that right uh uh so he was not for God took him so he was seized or caught up catched away uh without experiencing death and and so I I truly believe that there are people living today that is going to EXP exp erience that same thing that will not experience death but they're going to be raptured and and uh but at this time of rapture uh the the Bible tells us there in 1 Corinthians 15 and 26 The Last Enemy that shall be destroyed is death aren't you glad for that amen uh that that's going to be the Last Enemy um uh that that will be destroyed and and so the dead of course in Christ are going to be raptured uh at the same time and all uh who are part of this Rapture will be missing it's uh uh they're going to be gone and so uh uh uh brother Braham said standing there one moment and gone the next uh that that's the Rapture you you ain't going there ain't going to be no hair bones uh no nothing uh left uh uh because they're going to be transformed we will be transformed in a moment of time do you believe that so so our heart should be just anticipating under great expectation for this Rapture for the Rapture is at hand and and so uh uh then we we look at this and and read this the other night um but brother Bram said we've lived the time out amen and at the time of the Rapture is at hand and we're looking everybody say we're looking see we're looking for rapturing faith that can pull the church together and give it some Supernatural strength that can change these bodies that we live in ain't that right but then he says but don't worry amen it'll be there ain't that right it'll be there he says and when the power power of this church Rises it'll bring its Brethren see the power of that church Rises will bring its Brethren the power of that church will bring the other Brethren then there will be a general resurrection and we're looking forward to it how many's looking forward to it now we're looking forward to it because we know that he is a present help in the time of trouble amen he he's a present help now so so rapturing Faith he says will pull the church together and give it some Supernatural strength amen that can change uh uh these bodies amen it's got to take strength and if you notice he called it Supernatural strength amen it's it's a strength well uh God is Supernatural as we know we've been talking about it his actions are Supernatural and his life is Supernatural and and that's that's the token amen his life coming in you it's a supernatural life it's far superior than this old natural uh uh uh uh mortal life amen and and the the supernatural transcends the natural it goes beyond the limits of the natural it exceeds any restrictions amen that the natural has and and and so we know uh uh miracles happen because of the supernatural ain't that right every one of us uh have got testimonies of what God has done miraculously you know uh uh uh uh brother amamos talking about his arm uh uh hurting severely and and and we prayed and and God just instantly took that pain away uh we we we uh uh sister uh uh Janice uh there having isssues in her body and and uh it looked like she was going to have to have surgery and the doctor had had told her that and and but she went back for a checkup and and said you know no need for surgery and and these things but but there's something about that it we don't take these things for granted uh we know that there's something Supernatural Among Us how many believes that amen you have to believe in the basics and that is that God is Supernatural and that God there's nothing impossible with God Amen and then we have to know what he's trying to do in this last day so miracles happen the dead are raised and the blind see and and the crippled walk there there's nothing impossible amen the dead here and or the deaf amen uh uh they here and and so uh uh but but then we we find the prophet saying that Supernatural strength is needed in order to meet the challenge of the hour that's what a prophet said amen that it it's needed to meet the challenge of the hour and so we we look and this is how in the Old Testament this is how Samson could meet the challenge of of his day um uh uh when the enemy uh came and and uh a thousand Philistines he killed a thousand Philistines amen and and these were soldiers well-trained men uh with with armor and equipped weapon and yet he the spirit of the Lord came upon him and he took a just a Jawbone of a donkey and killed a thousand Philistines amen the Bible says that the enemy tried to surround him in a city and and he just walked to them Gates of that City amen and just picked them gates up and walked it up the hill and laid it down and Escape amen the Bible says that he killed a lion amen with his bare hands as it came at him now you know uh uh uh uh the intellectuals would maybe try to try to explain of how that was done but see we as Believers just look at it as that it was a supernatural strength amen Samson wouldn't have been able to do that it without a supernatural uh uh strength there Amen brother brandham said his strength was beyond anything the world ever had amen there was nothing that could match it for he had the strength of the Lord amen I'm so glad for that he had the strength of the Lord and when that strength Came Upon him there was no enemy there was no there was nothing that could take over him and destroy him but we find that when he revealed his secret amen uh to Delilah amen uh uh the secret of his strength amen then he lost that strength amen judges 16 and 18 it says when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart she sent and called for the Lords of the Philistines saying come up this once for he hath showed me all his heart then the Lords of the Philistines came unto her and brought her money or brought money in their hand and she made him Samson sleep upon her knees and she called for a man and she callused him to shave off the Seven Locks of his head and she began to afflict him and his strength went from him now you think of that it was a sign that he was in a backsliding condition he had no strength uh uh there it had left him and in that condition he could not produce the strength Amen to meet the challenge of the hour in that backsliding condition there was not enough strength Amen to produce the challenge or to meet the challenge of the hour for we see in the 20th verse she said the Philistines be upon thee Samson and he awoke out of his sleep and said I will go out as the other times or as at other times before and shake myself and he wish not that the Lord was departing Ed from him and the Philistines took him and put his eyes out and brought him down to Gaza amen and bounded him with feathers of brass and he did grind in the prison house ain't that right see so he couldn't overcome the enemy amen as he had in times past amen now the prophet said the church in its present denominational condition cannot produce the strength Amen to challenge the time uh to call it a Time see the denominations will not take the Vindicated uh Vindication of the word ain't that right he said you got bigger more members bigger muscles but where is the strength of the Lord amen see we uh uh we we can't do it on our own our our nice choirs and and and professionalism uh uh it isn't enough Amen to defeat the enemy and to meet the challenge in this day he said your big muscles won't meet the challenge of this hour the rapturing faith to take the church out of this thing before judgment strikes the earthy and so the the the carnal church is trying to produce the strength amen they're trying to meet the challenge of this age of uh with intellectual strength the prophet said see amen it's just kind of like when when God brought Israel up to the promised land amen they saw the enemy see they they had thought that they they could take that Land by intellectual strength and of their own ability but when they saw the Giants and they saw that it was too uh uh to beyond their strength it was beyond their ability amen they they cowed down and they uh uh they they didn't have the strength to meet the challenge but see the believer had it Joshua and Caleb they had what it took to meet the challenge can you say amen amen see now what is our strength brother bradam said the strength of the church is in the word of God and the word is God can you say Amen so the strength of the church is in the word and the word is God so brother Brandon would say in another place this word is God that was given to his church to defeat the world and the Devils amen now you don't need anything else you don't need intellect you don't need uh Talent you don't need whatever amen the word of God was given to us Amen to defeat the world and the devils and the sickness and to cast out Devils how many believes that amen that's right see and the word of God is Not only given to to Grandpa's and grandmas it's given to the middle aged it's given to the young people this word of God is our strength Amen to defeat the enemy it was the thing that God gave his church to defeat the world I don't care what Temptation you have there's a a the word of God Amen was given to you to defeat uh uh the world and the devils and the sickness and to cast out devils and no denomination was given to the church see the word was given to the church that's her strength can you say that with me that's my strength that's my strength amen see don't don't depart from the word that's my strength you got to have strength in order for these bodies to be changed can you say Amen the word of God is our strength so you you remember what the prophet said the weakest Christian can take that word and defeat the Devil any place any time under any uh condition there is no problem that you cannot and I want to say that now there is no problem too hard to where you can't overcome you got to overcome it God's given you the best thing that you've got he can give you and that's the word of God take that word and I don't care how weak you feel how low you feel how unworthy you feel if you could take that word you can defeat the enemy with it amen yes sir but notice he uh as as the Ilah shaved off the power amen uh um from Samson's head amen then the prophet said spiritual Jezebel uh they're mentioned in Revelations amen that Harlot system has done the same thing to the church amen she said she found uh he said she found where that strength laid and took him down to NAA Rome and shaved off his locks see and now they took what's left out of it and now taking them back to the World Council of churches and they got their locks shaved again see it's a constant shaving taking this out and well this doesn't mean that and the days of Miracles has passed and there's no such thing as this and that and the other and see they found where the strength laid substituting baptisms and handshakes and all these other things for the UN true unadulterated word of God so that's how the church has lost its strength amen they it was shaved off amen by taking this little part of the word out and this little part of the word out and this little part amen see it was they they shaved it off ain't that right he said see they've cut uh they've cut this away they've cut that away and they've shaved off this lock and they shaved off that lock until she stands shn today like a Catholic sister Shor off until she has accepted a bunch of man-made Creeds for her Doctrine and just exactly what the prophet said she would do now notice and here she stands today the church humiliated the church stands humiliated where she ought to have been standing in her strength God gave her the word but amen but uh uh was shaved off amen and now she stands humiliated the church around the world Amen claiming to be Christian claiming Christ claiming all of the things and standing humiliated when she should be standing in her strength amen see but you know uh uh the Bible says that Samson's strength returned to him amen as his hair grew back you see God promised and and this is just one of the things that through that story God promises amen that the strength amen will return back to the church amen the strength will return turn back into the church aren't you glad for that amen and and so he promised amen as to to but in order to restore the strength to the church he would have to restore the original word amen pure word of God without Creeds and dogmas and all of these things he would have to restore the original word and he promised to do it in these last days how many believes that right at the time of rapture amen that's God's grace to you Amen in the time of rapture he knew that we would have to have a supernatural strength in order to change these bodies but I'm so glad he's a present help in the time of our trouble amen yes sir amen see God he says is going to restore by shining forth the evening light what restored the whole word of God again notice the full manifestation of Christ in his church and of course with the restoration of the word comes the restoration of power amen the restoration of the word brings the restoration of the power amen see so I I say to you that the supernatural strength has returned to the church in this last day amen we are not weak we're not beggarly amen we're not victims of of circumstances amen there's a spiritual strength amen that is flowing in the church today now if you notice it's amazing that when God would return Supernatural strength to this church also we would look that the tears would also have strength amen they'll have strength in this last day brother Bram said that that that the tears would have a a tremendous three-fold strength of political physical and satanic power see it's a manifestation of of of Satan now notice now he he talked about that uh uh we read the quote earlier that God going to restore the whole word of God again the full manifestation of Christ in his church but here amen is the manifestation of Satan amen working through the tears and and the system now anybody that's uh uh been around demon uh possessed people amen know that that their their strength is many times stronger than just as it would in the natural you can look at the man of gadera uh uh for example amen uh Mark 5 and3 it says that no man could bind him no not with chains because he had often uh he had been often bound with FEDS and chains and the chains had been plucked toer by him and the feathers broken in pieces and neither could any man tame him ain't that right amen see it it it it it gave him a strength Beyond just human uh uh uh ability well in the first church age we we see that Satan amen started his ride Amen on the the the White Horse amen he was that the White Horse and and then uh after a while he switched to a red horse and then after a while he switched to a a black horse and and now he's riding a Pale Horse amen which is what death a ain't that right amen see and and all this time he been he's brought destruction he's brought perversion he's brought all kinds of things and and and and so he he's been riding a beast throughout the church age and we know what Beast is it's a power ain't that right it it's a power and so Satan's power Through the Ages has been exhibited and notice the prophet said his powers are political or national Powers that's why you don't need to get involved in politics amen don't need to get involved in politics his power Satan's Powers is National Powers political Powers amen uh uh that's one of them religious powers and demon powers so that's the powers that Satan has amen political National Powers religious Powers demon powers ain't that right and brother Bram taught us that all three powers are united in this age in The Pale Horse amen he said see three colors three powers represented in one a white horse a black horse a red horse see aen all gathered in that Pale Horse three crowns in one brother Braham said see three stages of his ministry makes him one person Satan incarnate and that's exactly where we're coming to Satan is coming more and more real or um making himself known more than in any other age is it is today and he will become incarnate can you say amen amen it it's amazing that the powers of the enemy amen that that is taken over the people to where even the policemen don't know what to do they it's hard to handle them amen because they're they're not dealing with just an individual they're dealing with individuals that are demon-possessed and and and and we're finding this uh uh uh uh uh this a a threefold Str stren in the tears now political physical and satanic spiritual Powers now the prophet says now he's he's he's these Powers they're going to attack the bride amen and that's what there there there's everything is setting up amen uh uh to get uh the the take the righteousness off away from off this Earth can you say Amen but notice now amen he is a present help in the time of trouble amen now listen this is a uh the these things are bringing on the tribulation amen these Powers uh that we just mentioned this three-fold strength amen is bringing on the tribulation it's setting in amen and to think you don't want to be here in this time of tribulation amen when the mercy of God has been lifted the hedge of God has been lifted and Satan has been able to Incarnate himself and have full dominion and full manifestation in human beings can you say Amen amen see and so uh uh it's this but we uh uh looking at this we've been promised that we're not going to tribulation the bride of Christ will not go through the tribulation amen so in the time of trouble amen he said he would be our help a present help now notice amen our strength what uh look what Psalms 18:32 says it is God that GED me with strength and maketh my way perfect Psalms 29:11 the Lord will give strength unto his people what is it Supernatural strength ain't that right amen 2 Samuel 22 and33 God is my strength and power amen uh uh uh so it it went just giving something to becoming something amen God just ain't going to give me strength he is my strength can you say Amen 2 Samuel 22:33 God is my strength and power Psalms 28:7 the Lord is my strength and my shield Isaiah 12 and2 behold God is my salvation I will trust and not be afraid for the Jehovah or for the Lord Jehovah is my strength oh bless the name of the Lord amen see so in I Isaiah 59:19 we know the scripture very well well amen but it says when the enemy come shall come in like a flood amen the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard raise up a standard against him amen not your intellect you are no match I am no match for him amen for this Old Devil this enemy amen it's proven that no man is a match for this enemy can you say amen amen but when he would come in like a flood God would be a present help in the time of trouble and he would raise up a standard against the enemy Hallelujah now how does he do it the prophet said by making the word amen that he's already said more positive all the time taking his same word and just making it more positive manifesting it making it more real and more real and more real it becomes more manifested so when Satan rode out on the White Horse with that power amen then God sent a certain power to meet it to combat it and that was the lion and then when Satan switched powers or switched uh horses uh uh and he rode on that red horse uh God sent another power to go forth and meet it to combat it and that was the ox ain't that right amen and when he came forth riding on the black horse God sent another power to meet him amen the prophet said it was a face of a man smart educated shrewd fine Anointed with the spirit of that day he went to combat him with the cunningness of God's wisdom with him that was the age of reformation Martin Luther John Wesley and so forth ain't that right see so God had showed that throughout all this time he was a present help amen and he would anoint the people that he has elect amen uh with a with that spirit and and they would rise up and and the Satan wouldn't be able to conquer them amen see amen now you look at Psalms 37 and and 39 it says the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord how many believes that the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord he is their strength in the time of trouble and the Lord shall help them and deliver them and he shall deliver them from the wicked and safe them him because they trust in him oh God's going to reward the people that trust in him God's going to reward his elect that just stands there when they ain't got no feelings and the and the emotions have left and the uh uh and and it just seem like their back is against the wall but they never cater from trusting God Amen they stay with trusting trusting him ain't that right now now notice he's going to send a standard he'll raise up a standard and and and you know God has showed that he's been with them in every Age and and every time Satan would come now we're living in the greatest age the most deceptive age the most uh uh uh evil age the most uh age of unbelief than ever before amen talking about breaking record history amen uh uh that there Satan is doing things that he uh uh like like never before in the in in man kind amen see and so notice what brother BR said our Great Hopes is this that one of these days this is in 59 the spirit of God will send back Jesus Christ to the Earth and then it'll be perfect then that will be the real standard oh my in the last days see the spirit of God will send back Jesus Christ to the Earth and then it'll be perfect thing that'll be the real standard so notice the last and final power that God sins to combat the enemy which is that pale horse rider which is is all powers of the previous ages mixed together amen they've come and United together God sends the uh uh uh the the right power to combat that thing amen see and that is the fly Eagle amen the last and final power that is to come to the church is a flying eagle ain't that right now to me that's what makes this message uh so so precious to us and wonderful a man is is because this message was sent from God it's a sign that he's a present help in the time of trouble and and see so he sends the Flying Eagle now notice first Thessalonians 4:16 for the Lord himself shall descend amen with a shout a voice and a trump amen now now notice again what brother Bram says our Great Hopes is this that one of these days the spirit of God will send back Jesus Christ to the Earth and then it'll be perfect then that'll be the real standard and so here the Lord himself shall descend with the shout a voice and a trump and then notice what follows this dissension notice not that we just start another age and people just get you know excited but the dead in Christ shall rise first and then we which are alive and remain are going to be changed how many believes that we're all going to be changed and we shall be caught up and together with him to meet the Lord in the air right amen now that's the effect of the Lord coming yes sir prise the Lord can you say amen and he comes just before the tribulation sets in full now this disension of the Lord himself is the Fulfillment of Jesus's prophecy as we've read so many times there in Luke and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory and when you see these things begin to come to pass then look up what are you supposed to do look up can you say Amen you're not supposed to despair you're you're not supposed to be filled with fear after looking over those things that are coming upon the Earth that's not your your portion of scripture that's not your allotted promise when you see these things and you see the son of man coming with the cloud with great power and Glory look up amen amen your strength is is herey prise the Lord look up and lift up your head for your Redemption draweth nigh the changing of your bodies and you say Amen see if you notice he doesn't come to the Earth to die again he's come to claim come to claim what he has redeemed and the prophet said the seventh seal brings him back to Earth the lamb come and took the book out of the right hand of him and sat down and claimed what he had owned what he had redeemed what he owned what he had redeemed ain't that right see he says the son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us and will make his word so real everybody say so real you see the standard god making his word more real more positive all the time now here it is the son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us and will make his word so real that it'll unite the church in him as one the bride and then she'll go home to the wedding supper there's never been a standard such like this we thank God for the eag or the ox we thank God for the lion we thank God for amen the face of the man but it never was a power that could change and give the church a strength amen for a Rapture can you sayen but here we find God is our strength he himself comes he himself comes in human flesh now the son of man you see the son of man is Christ you believe that is what a prophet said the son of man is Christ yes sir what is Christ Christ is the word and the word comes to a prophet can you say Amen the son of man is Christ amen so if he comes amen it it's Christ amen and and Christ is the word and the word doesn't come to a theologian it comes to a prophet amen see so before the son of man Christ could come there had to be a prophet on Earth for him the word to come to this is why Malachi 4 is a promise to us it's our hope it's our life it's it's something we cling to for Malachi 4:5 behold I will send you Elijah of the Prophet before the coming and of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord God knew what what he was going to do before the tribulation sets in and the wrath of God it goes full-blown he would send the prophet and he would come to that Prophet to give us strength Hallelujah can you say amen God Likens His prophets as Eagles right he Likens His prophets as Eagles so he promised to send us an eagle amen that's right but he also calls himself an eagle ain't that right brother Brian said he is the great Jehovah Eagle amen now so now notice what a prophet says now how fitting and matching it is to Luke 17:30 where the son of man Eagle will be revealing himself so when we're looking at Eagle age it's not just a prophet coming amen but it's it's it's Jehovah Eagle the great Jehovah Eagle coming to a prophet Eagle amen and revealing himself can you say Amen the son of man Eagle will be revealing himself to bring to not all other worship places such as denominations and so forth see church we can verify and and and positively rest and know that this is the eagle age how many believe that amen if you believe this message you got to know that this is the eagle age and it wasn't just a prophet Eagle it was great Jehovah Eagle coming to a prophet revealing himself now notice brother brah said as it was in the days of lot so will it be in the hours of the that the son of man will be revealed on Earth see not Son of God no more son of man come back as the prophetic message for the last day when that eagle will be flying not the lion not the ox in the sacrifice age see every time a religious power went forth to meet the challenge of the political power of the world see every time see a religious power went forth so when the line raised up the religious power see it went to meet the Roman power and when then when come the sacrifice hour the ox went because he's the sacrifice beast of the Lord then come the reformers down through the church Ages come the face of a man and the reformers had been since Luther Wesley oh Calvin and on down down Pentecostal age and all that but in the last message everybody say the last message see in the last message that went forth there came a flying eagle it's Eagle time it's revealed time the word of God made manifest the word of God proven can you say man it's Eagle time revealed time the word of God made manifest the word of God proven amen that's the standard God raising up a standard you can't get a greater standard than what we've got when the full word of God is being made manifest and real which is Jesus Christ amen manifested in Us in human flesh you see in the Old Testament it was Christ in Noah it was Christ in David it was Christ in Moses it was Christ in all the prophets amen Christ Christ Christ and all the types and shadows and Christ in the songs and but each one of them had a portion of the word but the prophet said the full manifestation of God's word the full everybody say the full manifestation not portion not part full manifestation of God's word was made known through Jesus Christ the spirit of God he was the full manifestation of Jehovah God made flesh to dwell Among Us aren't you glad for that the fullness of the godhead dwelt bodily in him he he was he was it he was the Psalms he was the Poetry he was he was what David lived and said and and and acted out he he was all the types and shadows amen that spoke of Messiah he was that one ain't that right amen so he was not just saying you know uh uh all the prophets he's coming there is to come thus sayith the Lord amen pointing the people Amen to a future coming of Messiah but when he got there he said I am he that that David spoke of I am he that Moses said wrote about I am he search all the scriptures and they testify of who I am can you say amen he was the full manifestation of Jehovah God made flesh to dwell Among Us now that same logos has a part amen see he has got a bride and the same logos this word that cannot be tampered with is brooding over the churches today trying to bring back the word to full manifestation why to give full strength to the church amen can you say amen amen yes sir amen see amen see another place he was only manifested in temporarily in the other churches in the form of justification so but in here the age that's coming now and we can say the age that now is the full manifestation of the Vindication of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever this is that age it's a full manifestation full manif amen see what is it it's Eagle age amen when Satan has gathered all of his powersall God himself he reveals himself full manifestation where in a Corporal body no his bride that's the real [Music] standard I hope that's all right so brother Bram says see today before Jesus comes again the full manifestation of the person of Jesus Christ is to be manifested in flesh think of it Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed amen now notice what a prophet preached Christ is revealed in his own Worden to see Christ you got to see him in here ain't that right your strength is here amen your salvation is here Christ is revealed in his own word see that's why when they'd look at the cloud Amen in Tucson no one figured out what it was it went into Life Magazine across the the United States maybe around the world I don't know amen but but when they looked at it they had no idea but when we could see it in the word and we can compare it we see Christ has come in a cloud amen with power and great glory amen we see it see Christ is revealed in his own word now notice when the word is third L identified Amen to be Vindicated for that day that is the message of the day of the hour you believe that Hallelujah say that again when the word is Thoroughly identified it doesn't matter amen all kinds of interpretations of the word today but when the word is Thoroughly identified to be Vindicated for that day that is the message of the hour another quote he's revealed in this Bible what he would do in this age and we see him and when we see him do it when we see him do what he promised to do see not a virgin birth that was 2,000 years ago but what he promised to do today what he said he would do today that's what he is today amen can you say amenl that's what he is so then we can say Amen with brother brandham when he said the message is Christ he's the word the message is Christ because this message fits right with the Bible everything that that that took place comes from the scriptures now he said the only way that he can reveal is to come into you see he is he can he is the word and the word in you then the Holy Spirit reveals Christ through the word after he gets in you he's in you and then you must take his word can you say amen amen now Psalms 28 and7 it says the Lord is my strength and my shield my heart trusted in him and I am helped therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth I think if there's ever a people that should be rejoicing in this age it's us we should be the happiest people even when troubles come and Trials come we we should be thankful to the Lord amen my heart greatly rejoices and with my song will I praise him the Lord is their strength he is the saving strength of his anointed am think of that he is the saving strength of his anointed his elect amen see so he he the manifested word is the saving strength to his people can you say Amen now I won't take much longer but notice how strength comes to us he has come in his word he's revealed through his word that word's been Vindicated over and over to where we know that we don't say so so it it we see it clearly to where we say you know we don't need to get the message you know people to Christ before we get them to the message we see it so clearly that we know that Christ is the message when you get him to the message you're getting him to Christ if if and and that's just the truth now if if if you don't believe that then you don't see the message you you just you're missing the whole point amen because again brother bradam says amen that the word vindicat hated amen well look he's revealed in this Bible what he would do in this age when we see it do it and when we seek him do what he promised to do ain't that right not a virgin birth don't take him back to a virgin birth amen that was 2,000 years ago but what he promised to do today what he said he would do today that's what he is today so then the message is Christ that's right can you say Amen no wonder the prophet said we're getting them to church but not to Christ now he wasn't talking to about message people amen there wasn't message churches on the on the face of the Earth at that time he was talking to the Pentecostals and denominations and all of that they were getting them to a program they were getting them to a Doctrine they were getting them to their idea and not getting them to Christ amen but we see Christ in his word amen because it's been Vindicated amen can you say man and he's the saving strength now notice how this strink comes to us John 6:47 I am the living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world 54th verse who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and die in him as the father living father has sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me can you say Amen so so look now his body is the word that's what the brother Bram said that's what Jesus was trying to get to now the carnal mind in that day says oh now he's telling us to eat him you know he he's we're not cannibals right and so they want us to he wants us to devour his flesh and they walked away cuz they didn't understand and he didn't beg them to come back he just he looked at the others that still there and said would you go also but but but notice what he was trying to tell them is is I'm the word yeah I'm the word you you got to eat me the word hello amen if you're going to live you got to eat the word see so so his body is the word because he is the word manifested in flesh so he tells the church this this which I am giv you the word is a revelation of myself I'm the word I'm giving you a revelation of myself that's what you've got to eat that's why we're not eating doctrinal uh uh bapt Baptist doctrines and Presbyterian doctrines and and and what they they had Truth for back then that's fine I don't argue with any of you if you say well they have truth they had truth but what they have today is rotten amen can you say amen amen see and and so so we're we're but but in this age he has come to reveal himself son of man so now notice brother Bram said we receive him in the form of the word we receive him he is our strength amen we receive him in the form of the word Matthew 4:4 Jesus said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God brother bramwood said it this way the man shall not live by bread alone but out of the bosom of God shall he nurse his strength hello every word that comes out of the mouth of God shall he receive his strength as he comes from the mouth of God the word so as the word comes from the mouth of God and and we know it's the Vindicated word and the word can only be come through a prophet and as that word comes amen we draw strength by receiving it by eating it by believing it can you say Amen so brother brandom said this he said we sit in like in the message this morning we listen our souls grabbing reaching grab that word we live by the word that's why every service is is important amen this is why playing the tapes is important amen because you you and and and not just playing it and so amen but listening to it let your soul reach out and grasp the meaning of it Matthew 24:28 wheresoever the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered together Luke 17:37 says it this way where wheresoever the body is the word thither will the Eagles be gathered together yes sir what is the carcass brother bramon calls it this the fresh kill of the word the word that's raised up and fattened and being made manifest and give out to the food for the children it's given out for food to the children give out for food to the elect can you say Amen God wouldn't have wasted his time amen by sending this message if there was not anyone going in a Rapture but somebody's going in a Rapture and somebody's got to take this message as food and get strengthen for a body change you understand it church amen it's not just say well I played a tape today ooo I done a good thing that ain't it it's your food amen this is Rapture time amen that's why I say it all the time I believe it you ain't going in the Rapture without this message it may be strong but that's just what I believe and I believe it's it's scriptural I believe it's it's message I believe it's everything this why we must not treat this message lightly let it be your daily diet can you say Amen now notice brother Bram says Christians will not eat on that dead carryon from old denominational doctrines and things they want the word of God fresh that's what Believers want they they they don't want what was given yesterday and and in the ages is pasted they want their food fresh see the word of God fresh the promise of the hour are you with me church God promised rabbits in the days of Luther he promised other things in the days of others but now he promised us a full Square meal the full seven course menu for all the Seven Seals are opened and everything is ready for the word of God to those who can receive [Music] it rabbit DT ain't going to get you in a Rapture all this other ain't going to get you in a Rapture but God a present help in the time of trouble he came down with an open book amen and began to give strength and to his church he did Brother Bram said it's going to take more faith than ever was in any age for this has to be rapturing Faith to be taken up oh church I I I don't know I you know sometimes Satan is good at trying to get us to doubt our own our own uh uh relationship with God Satan is good to get us to question well whether he really loves me am I really in this and and and all these things but may God give us strength amen receive strength for yourself to where you can believe for yourself believe for yourself can you say Amen it's going to take more faith more faith right then than ever was in any age for this has to be rapturing Faith to be taken up see so rabbit food ain't going to get us chicken food ain't going to get us little whatever was back in the ages isn't going to get us amen it's going to take a rapturing faith in this age more faith than it ever was amen and brother brand called that rapturing Faith the faith of this hour you say well I got faith it's got to be rapturing Faith that's why brother Brandon would say Lord You're preparing your people to believe for all things that's right can you say Amen so that's what the prophet's desire was and this is God's desire is he wanted us to get built up in faith rapturing faith can you say Amen see because rapturing Faith again again rapturing faith is what's going to pull the church together and give it some Supernatural strength that can change our bodies amen now notice brother Braham said I believe that through those seven Thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing Faith oh my Lord hello church I believe that it's the seven Thunders I know everybody making big deal about seven Thunders and they're making Mysteries where there is no mystery yeah on the seven Thunders it's getting to the point you can't even preach talk about seven Thunders or they tie you to a certain movement but the Bible talks about them brother brandham talked about them and he said them seven Thunders is what's going to give of us the rapturing faith brother Brown said the Thunders is the voice of God uttering can you say amen amen it's opened the book it's revealed the Mysteries to us it's the voice of God hallelujah so we could say it the voice of God will be uh uh sounding opening the Mysteries to bring the church together and give it rapturing Faith he says because what we got right now we wouldn't be able to do it and he's talking about back then he what we got ain't going to do it he's trying to get them Pentecostals to understand all you're speaking in tongues and you're prophesying and rolling on the floor and shaking that ain't going to do it having emotional fits hey I'm emotional and I love the good old time but that ain't going to do it amen right on now it'll take them seven Thunders the revealing of them Thunders to get the bride together for rapturing Faith he said see there's something we've got to step further we can't have now notice we can't have enough faith for Divine Healing hardly we've got to have enough Faith to be changed in a moment and be swept up out of this Earth and we'll find that after a while the Lord will find where it's written see so so you know uh uh so here another place he says We Gather here which he's talking about you know coming like this but he says We Gather here for Spiritual strength we we're not gathered here to see what kind of a Preacher we get and about about the musicians how well they do and and and pick the service apart and all the we're just gathered here for Spiritual strength we realize that we're in a rapturing age Church don't disqualify Church don't don't don't just discount uh coming together seems like everybody's got so many things to do that that that you just hardly find a diseal for come to the house of God anymore and that's just getting everywhere but church if we can realize and I understand you got oxes in the ditch and things that you've got to take care of so I'm not knocking all that but I'm I'm just talking about we get more excuses every day but if we can understand we come here it may be an hour and a half two hours or whatever but these are precious times because we're gathered here for Spiritual strength any day the Lord is coming any day this body is going to change praise our God can you say amen hallelujah last Sunday you know I read where brother brand talked about this message being hidden food and he said help this morning Lord as we read the word May the Holy Spirit reveal it to us that the church might be fully established in the faith in the faith that was once delivered to the Saints to hold them and may as you gave the vision some two years ago to store up the food fine healthy looking vegetables that I saw in the vision being stored here in this Tabernacle may we today receive a whole barrel full of that Granite Lord or a tape full tape load that it might reveal Jesus Christ to us in the hour that we live to give us sustaining strength the spiritual strength for the task that lays ahead can you say amen so so we're again you know I can't say it enough and I hope I'm not just you know uh uh dragging this thought out you know in this subject amen but but I I just this you know this message is dear to me and the more I I you know and I don't understand at all I promise you that and and but I sure seek to but but I do I I I'm I'm understanding more of the value of it that that without this message we it's the grace of God that I can understand the message message believe the message able to hear the message go to a message church because I would be left without it Hallelujah I would have no hope that's right but I've got a food a food for this day the carcass has revealed it's revealed the son of man you love him bless Lord see so the Vindicated truth is God's provided way to bring Believers to a rapturing faith if the musicians will come brother Braham said Do you believe someday he'll come in and make us free he said I do too come to the grave and open the doors I'll come out from among the dead I'm trusting him he is here tonight isn't isn't it wonderful to know that we don't have to take some human philosophy we got a Bible here that speaks of this and here he is to identify his church to give it rapturing Faith to be taken away hallelujah hallelujah so what was the message what is the purpose of the revealing of the son of man to give it rapturing Faith he is our strength can you say amen amen that he's not dead He's Alive Amen brother BR said when we see the dead raised and when we see all all these Miracles and Supernatural things he said it ought to give us Rapture in faith amen it ought to bring us to a place in God Amen to where we don't question this and we don't question that and we don't and I'm not talking about uh you know wanting to know more about God and understand amen but but you know if God says it in his word then we just accept it whether whether it's a uh uh you know we just take Divine Healing it doesn't matter what your symptoms are it doesn't matter what the doctor says it doesn't matter amen how much pain you're going through it doesn't matter amen we just know we believe it that God Is A Healer amen we just believe it well if we can believe that then what about what about these other things God's able to give the Holy Ghost God is able to save our lost children God is able God is able to bring a restoration why that's the faith we've come to God is able to change this vile body God is able amen change my soul He's Able he's done it amen do you love him hallelujah [Music] hallelujah underneath your wings I rejoice and sing you are my [Music] refuge and when the storm is Raging [Music] benath your wings I rejoice and sing you are my refuge verse one oh I have found a place that I can call my own here in your Embrace where your mercy overflow it's here that my

going up [Music] yonder I'm going up yonder to be with my [Music] Lord as they just play softly aren't you glad you're going not going through tribulation going in a Rapture Church feed off the word of God build your strength build your strength and it's again it's not just playing the tape it's it's it's conditioning yourself you know brother Brian said you can't see things until you get in the spirit get in the spirit live in that Spirit walk in the spirit you know and and I know we got our daily things that we do but I believe that we can still live in the spirit as we go through life don't don't let the world take that from you you know I I know we sometime we we it's easy to get our minds wrapped up on social media and and I I think it's becoming more of a detriment than anything and and we should get away from that stuff to where we can Center our mind and our heart upon the word of God because you ain't going in Rapture by feeding off social media you just ain't you know but you will the rapt this message will give you that rapturing Faith so so stay with God stay with his word amen may God bless you and uh just want to say uh Heather and I and the boys will be headed to Ohio tomorrow and uh my sister uh is doing a recording and so um she's asked if have a part in that as far as playing the drums and brother Kevin's going to be playing the guitar and but he's going at a different time and uh to do his recording and his part and I'm going tomorrow so Friday and Saturday will be uh full of uh recording and I was going to try to be back in time for Sunday but uh Jonathan uh brother Jonathan had asked if he had got wind that I was going to be in town and so he had asked if I would Minister and and U so uh just kind of waited for a little bit just wondering what to do but just felt uh comfortable with doing that and so we're going to be I'll be ministering the Lord willing for brother Jonathan on on Sunday morning and then we'll be heading back home and so brother Tim Farmer uh will be ministering here the Lord willing uh Sunday morning and uh uh so uh you know we we'll certainly be in prayer uh for you uh and I just cover your prayers um that the Lord will just be with us help us in the recording thing and and also in the ministering of the Gospel um and so then uh Christmas is just right around the corner it's actually next week next Wednesday so there will be no service Wednesday uh you know next Wednesday and so uh if I don't uh get to see you all before Christmas time Merry Christmas to you all and I just pray that you have a wonderful time with family and things but don't forget the reason why you know what this is all about you know uh don't don't get so wrapped up in the gifts and the the carnal side of things that uh we lose focus upon the real thing and that's what Christ has done for us can you say Amen so God bless you and um uh again remember service at 11:00 and brother Tim Farmer will'll be ministering and we want to just pray for different ones that are not feeling good and uh also uh just asking a special prayer for sister Martha and uh she's right now just needing our prayer and so uh just things are happening in her body and uh she's losing strength and I won't go into a lot of detail with it but um she's just she's exhausted just tired and uh something is is going on they're going to be doing blood work on the second and um you know and I understand the devil can put a lot of fear in in an individual and uh get them thinking the worst and things but she's been going through things for a while now and and um um just not able they they' discovered she's anemic but but something's causing this and anyways just some other things and so uh uh I'd asked if it was okay to and just ask you all to pray so uh uh if you don't mind hold sister Martha in your prayer uh she really needs our prayer right now you know and so take this to heart now and uh that God will be with her and uh I'm just believing God for a miracle he God done it for my mom uh you know and uh mom she was you know uh uh going through some issues kind of the same things uh and uh but that God just intervened and worked a miracle and so uh uh I know God can do the same for sister Martha in this just way we're believing so just continue to pray uh for that I just I know Daniel had ask but I ask you to pray for my dad and um you know he's he's been doing a lot better being in rehab but uh he's choking choking a lot and uh uh the doctor you know back in the day when this Parkinson first was diagnosed he you know he basically told us that's that's the final thing is the choking and uh so that's you know that's kind of hard but um so you know he's just just pray uh for that and um they can't get the fluid off his heart for some reason and so uh he'll be going home uh with oxygen and um and so but he's in good spirits and um uh you know doing doing good in that way regard and I know whether the Lord decides to take him or not I I believe he's ready to meet the Lord and uh but you know how it is you always like your dad to be around and been a certainly a help to me so God bless you is our prayer and uh just keep one another in our prayer may God just bind us together into real love deep love amen the love of God Amen and so let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer brother Amos would you want
