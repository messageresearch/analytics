[37:21] Psalms 34

[37:33] heads
[37:34] to the Lord father

[37:41] to have your presence Among Us Lord and

[39:07] we commit this service into your hands
[39:09] in Jesus Christ's name and the church
[39:13] says
[39:14] amen Psalms 34 and we want to just start
[39:19] again at the fourth verse
[39:21] but it says I sought the Lord and he
[39:24] heard me and delivered me from all my
[39:26] fears
[39:27] they looked unto him and were lightened
[39:30] and their faces were not ashamed this
[39:33] poor man cried and the Lord heard him
[39:36] and saved him out of all of his troubles
[39:39] the angel of the Lord in campus around
[39:42] about them that fear Him and delivereth
[39:45] them
[39:46] old taste and see that the Lord is good
[39:48] blessed is the man that trusteth in him

[39:56] no want to them

[40:03] hunger but they that seek the Lord shall
[40:06] not want any good thing
[40:08] gummy children hearken unto me and I
[40:11] will teach you
[40:13] the fear of the Lord amen you can have
[40:17] your seats this evening
[40:22] and I want to
[40:25] continue on on this speaking of fear and
[40:30] as I stated this morning there's two
[40:33] kinds of fear that is mentioned in this
[40:37] passage of scripture
[40:39] and we talked about one of them today
[40:42] and and
[40:43] the Bible identifies it as being the
[40:46] spirit of fear
[40:48] and uh brother Branham calls it the
[40:51] devil's fear and and of course this kind
[40:54] of fear has torment
[40:56] showing that it's a demonic power at
[40:58] work and and
[41:00] um we we see that fear is controlling
[41:03] the world today
[41:05] the majority of people
[41:08] um are under this fear and and it's
[41:11] because of the wrath of God that is
[41:13] coming
[41:14] uh upon the Earth and Jesus already
[41:17] prophesied that men's Hearts would fail
[41:19] them for fear looking after those things
[41:22] which are coming on the Earth
[41:24] so it's the wrath of God that is being
[41:27] poured out on them and uh they're fixing
[41:31] to be if you want to set that way
[41:34] which this brings on the the Great
[41:37] Tribulation but the wrath of God abides
[41:40] on them
[41:41] and and but we we find that there is a
[41:45] people that God delivers from this fear
[41:48] and that's his elect they he delivers
[41:51] them and
[41:53] um
[41:53] Proverbs 3 25 it says Be not Afraid of
[41:59] sudden fear
[42:00] uh neither of the desolation of the
[42:03] wicked when it cometh
[42:05] and we know that we're in this day
[42:07] but he's telling the people don't be
[42:09] afraid
[42:11] um and of of sudden fear neither of the
[42:14] desolation of the wicked when it cometh
[42:17] for the Lord shall be thy confidence
[42:20] that's that's why the fear that is
[42:24] gripping the world does not come up on
[42:26] the elect is because the Lord is their
[42:28] confidence and shall keep thy foot from
[42:33] being taken
[42:34] so we find out how do we not have fear
[42:38] and and that is through love because
[42:40] Jesus said or John says that perfect
[42:43] love casteth out all fear and it's not a
[42:47] human love it's it's nothing no other
[42:50] love but the greatest of love and that
[42:53] is divine love
[42:55] and and so there's no fear in love but
[42:58] then we find that there's another fear
[43:00] that David speaks of in our opening
[43:03] scripture and and that is the fear of
[43:06] the Lord
[43:07] and this is something that only the
[43:10] elect will have is is the fear of the
[43:13] Lord so the world has one fear and the
[43:17] elect has another fear
[43:19] and according to uh Ecclesiastes 12 and
[43:23] 13. it says the whole duty of man is the
[43:27] fear God and to keep his Commandments
[43:30] and and so then we we read other
[43:34] passages uh Psalms 2 8 serve the Lord
[43:36] with fear
[43:38] and rejoice with trembling
[43:41] so you can rejoice and have fear in in
[43:45] the fear of the Lord uh Psalms 147 11 it
[43:50] says the lord taketh pleasure in them
[43:53] that fear Him in those that hope in his
[43:56] mercy and in our opening scripture there
[44:00] it says that the the angel of the Lord
[44:02] accompanies them that fear him so so
[44:06] there is always an abiding presence of
[44:11] God and the angels of God that are
[44:14] around those that fear Him He abides
[44:19] with them and and the prophet said see
[44:21] the Angels the angels are with you
[44:23] always and and they they know every
[44:26] thought you think they know every motive
[44:28] of your heart they know they know
[44:30] everything because they're they're with
[44:32] you and he says this is why we're
[44:34] careful careful to do anything uh that
[44:38] would displease him entertain things
[44:40] that would be wrong is is simply because
[44:43] we are conscience of his presence and so
[44:47] then he abides with him that fear them
[44:50] and and of course this is talking of the
[44:52] fear of the Lord
[44:53] uh Proverbs 14 26 it says end the fear
[44:57] of the Lord is strong confidence and we
[44:59] were talking about confidence this
[45:01] morning of how that when there isn't
[45:04] confidence then there's fear uh afraid
[45:07] scared uh um and and but but here in the
[45:11] fear of the Lord is strong confidence
[45:14] and his children shall have a place of
[45:17] Refuge
[45:18] the fear of the Lord is a Fountain of
[45:21] Life to depart from the snares of death
[45:25] so the having the fear of the Lord is a
[45:28] great thing that that that we all need
[45:31] it's it's it's life it's a Fountain of
[45:33] Life and so we we we see how that that
[45:37] this scripture there and other
[45:39] scriptures are uh show us the contrast
[45:42] between the fear that the devil brings
[45:45] that we talked about this morning versus
[45:47] the fear of the Lord the devil's fear
[45:50] comes by not having confidence and the
[45:54] fear of the Lord is our confidence it
[45:57] brings our confidence and and so we we
[46:01] find that the the fear of the Lord is a
[46:04] precious thing that that we need
[46:06] Proverbs 15 16 says better is little
[46:10] with the fear of the Lord than great
[46:13] treasure and trouble therewith so it the
[46:16] the emphasis in of life is not to have
[46:19] great things it's not to have a great
[46:22] name it's not to be you know uh to have
[46:25] wealth and and these things the the
[46:28] greatest thing that that
[46:34] but what is the fear of the Lord and and
[46:37] we know uh what it is it's it's respect
[46:40] it's towards God and and of course he is
[46:44] the word it's it's reverence in in
[46:47] Divine worship and and toward God and so
[46:51] uh and and again brother Branham has uh
[46:54] laid the foundation so plain that God is
[46:58] the word you cannot love God without the
[47:01] word you cannot love the word without
[47:02] God you you cannot you cannot reverence
[47:06] god without reverencing his word you you
[47:09] cannot respect the word without
[47:11] reverencing God because they're the same
[47:13] uh the same this is God in letter form
[47:16] and then when he comes Among Us it's God
[47:19] in In Living form and er the word in
[47:23] living form and and so uh when when a
[47:27] man respects the word of God then he has
[47:31] the fear of God and brother Brown said
[47:33] you cannot have respects until you have
[47:37] fear amen you so so fear uh and and and
[47:41] so having the fear of the Lord does not
[47:44] mean that you're you're afraid of God
[47:47] God never wants us to serve him when it
[47:51] says serve the Lord with fear that don't
[47:53] mean that you're afraid that don't mean
[47:55] that that you're you're you know you're
[47:57] ready uh thinking that he's going to
[47:59] strike out at you at any time or
[48:01] anything that that's the wrong kind of
[48:03] fear but it means that you have respects
[48:06] and you have reverence for him brother
[48:09] REM said when you fear God you respect
[48:12] God ain't that rhyme and so to fear God
[48:15] is the fear that you might displease him
[48:18] in some way you you fear that you would
[48:22] do something wrong
[48:24] um that that would grieve him and not
[48:28] not again not that he would cast you off
[48:31] people tried to they serve God for
[48:34] different reasons but some serve God
[48:36] because they're afraid to go to hell and
[48:38] that's not the fear that God wants us to
[48:41] serve him with but but but yet that fear
[48:44] of the Lord it causes us to to watch
[48:48] everything that we do because it brings
[48:51] respect now brother Branham said I fear
[48:54] my mother I I fear my wife I I fear my
[48:58] church I fear all God's servants lest I
[49:01] should put a stumbling block somewhere
[49:04] in their way I fear the people I fear
[49:08] the people of the city lest I should do
[49:10] something wrong that would cause them to
[49:13] think that I wasn't a Christian so this
[49:17] is the fear of the Lord it's it's it's a
[49:20] Godly fear and and the Bible tells us to
[49:23] serve God
[49:25] acceptably I believe that's how you'd
[49:27] say it acceptably in other words you to
[49:31] serve God in a way that's agreeable to
[49:34] him a man not not agreeable to us but we
[49:38] would serve God uh in a way that's
[49:40] agreeable to him we want him to be happy
[49:44] we want him to be uh uh uh pleased with
[49:48] our life and so we serve God acceptably
[49:51] and then it says uh serve him with
[49:54] reverence and godly fear ain't that
[49:57] rhyme and so brother Brown says if a
[50:00] man's ever born of of the spirit of God
[50:03] he becomes a new creature and can't
[50:05] produce nothing else but Godly fear
[50:08] Godly love and the fruits of the spirit
[50:11] for it is life ain't that right it is
[50:15] life and so uh uh when the Life of
[50:18] Christ comes in us then this is what it
[50:21] produces it doesn't produce uh the fear
[50:24] that of the devil uh uh for God has not
[50:27] given us the spirit of fear but yet the
[50:30] life of God living in US produces the
[50:34] fear of the Lord I respect and and so uh
[50:39] you look in Hebrews 5 and 7 in Paul in
[50:43] speaking of Christ said who in the days
[50:45] of his flesh when he had offered up
[50:48] prayers and supplications with strong
[50:51] crying and tears unto him that was able
[50:54] to save him from death and was heard in
[50:58] that he feared ain't that right in that
[51:01] he feared so again it was because that
[51:05] he had respect unto on unto the father
[51:08] it was because he he had reverence that
[51:12] his prayers were answered ain't that
[51:15] right and and so of of course uh you
[51:19] know someone said well why did Jesus
[51:21] have to pray well the Bible says All
[51:22] Flesh cries out and so so that human
[51:27] part had to pray and yet he he prayed to
[51:31] the God that was within him
[51:33] but but the whole life of Jesus was was
[51:37] that of fearing the Lord it it was a
[51:40] reverence it was a respect unto unto God
[51:43] and His word ain't that right so so
[51:46] again here in in Psalms 145 19 it says
[51:51] he will fulfill the desire can you say
[51:55] that with me he will fulfill the desire
[51:58] of them that fear Him He also will hear
[52:04] their cry and will save them
[52:07] ain't that right so so now you know uh
[52:11] uh today we speak of how that God has
[52:14] given us the spirit of of wisdom and
[52:17] understanding in this day and and how
[52:20] true it it is that that God has done
[52:23] this and it was important that God would
[52:27] would give it uh to us because by this
[52:30] uh according to the scripture by this
[52:33] comes the the fear of the Lord and and
[52:37] we we find in Psalms 1 um 1 11 and 10.
[52:42] uh it says fear the fear of the Lord is
[52:46] the beginning of wisdom ain't that right
[52:50] so so to just to have the fear of the
[52:53] Lord you're beginning to have wisdom and
[52:56] and and that's the positive sign that a
[52:58] man has uh wisdom uh is is he has the
[53:02] fear of the Lord and and then you look
[53:05] at Job 28 and 28 and he says unto man he
[53:09] said behold the fear of the Lord that is
[53:12] wisdom amen so so the beginning of
[53:15] wisdom when when God gave us the spirit
[53:19] of wisdom that is the first thing that
[53:22] he began to impart to the church was the
[53:24] fear of the Lord a a reverence a a Godly
[53:28] and and how we needed that it because
[53:31] look at the world today look look at
[53:34] what has been through all the ages it's
[53:36] it's just been a rise of one
[53:38] denomination to the next and and in in a
[53:42] tradition and and as I said this morning
[53:44] they've made uh the tables of the Lord
[53:47] just they're full of vomit and and and
[53:49] chaos and Corruption and and all of that
[53:53] but it would be in this day that God
[53:55] would would uh pour out and give unto us
[53:58] the spirit of wisdom which would began
[54:01] with giving us the fear of the Lord amen
[54:04] when when they're they're living all
[54:06] kinds of of of ways and act in any way
[54:09] but but here it says uh 28 and 28 and
[54:14] job behold the fear of the Lord that is
[54:16] wisdom and to depart from Evil is
[54:20] understanding and there's a lot there
[54:22] that we could go into just in that verse
[54:25] alone but but we find uh here that that
[54:29] Psalms 1 and 7 it says the fear of the
[54:32] Lord is the beginning of knowledge ain't
[54:36] that right and and this knowledge is is
[54:39] the knowledge of God it's a Godly
[54:41] knowledge which Peter talks about but in
[54:44] other places uh is the knowledge of God
[54:47] but fools despise notice what they
[54:49] despise wisdom and understanding they
[54:53] the fools that despise wisdom and
[54:56] instruction and and and so then you look
[54:58] at at Proverbs 9 and 10 it says the
[55:02] knowledge of the Holy is understanding
[55:05] so we see that it's a higher knowledge
[55:07] than than just the the knowledge of of
[55:11] of humanity but it's the knowledge of
[55:14] God ain't that right and so we can
[55:17] understand why why the world is in the
[55:20] condition that it's in we can understand
[55:22] why people are so Brazen in their their
[55:25] actions and and and these things is
[55:28] because they have not the fear of the
[55:31] Lord which shows that they have not the
[55:35] wisdom and and the knowledge of the Lord
[55:39] ain't that right so so that leads to no
[55:42] respect that leads to no reverence it it
[55:44] leads to all these things now what is
[55:48] the knowledge of God for for again the
[55:51] fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[55:53] knowledge amen and so what is the
[55:56] knowledge of God we look at it as the
[55:58] Mysteries revealed amen it's the it's
[56:01] not an it's not the knowledge of a of a
[56:05] closed book it's it's the knowledge of
[56:07] of an open book ain't that right the
[56:10] things that God has has uh uh been it's
[56:16] been hidden before the foundation of the
[56:18] world has now been revealed to us in
[56:22] this day amen and we look at that
[56:25] Revelations 10 and 7 but in the days of
[56:28] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[56:30] shall begin to sound the mystery of God
[56:33] should be finished or as the prophet
[56:35] would tell us should be revealed ain't
[56:37] that right so God would not just give us
[56:40] the spirit of wisdom but he would open
[56:42] up the knowledge of God and and and
[56:45] therefore the fear of the Lord would
[56:48] come to us and ain't that right amen so
[56:52] so the mystery of God should be finished
[56:54] or revealed unveiled as he has declared
[56:57] to his servants the prophets so before
[57:00] he could reveal the Mysteries then we
[57:03] find the lamb had to come and to loose
[57:06] the seals uh thereof and in this day the
[57:10] prophet said he took the book The Lamb
[57:13] took the book opened them seals and he
[57:16] opened the book and tore off the seals
[57:18] and sent it down to the Earth to a
[57:21] seventh angel to reveal it to his people
[57:23] can you say man so so this all of these
[57:26] things has a meaning to us this message
[57:28] of the hour has great meaning to us as
[57:32] the elect of God because it's God
[57:34] imparting something to us then just uh
[57:37] uh uh knowledge of of humanity just
[57:41] intellectual but God is imparting to us
[57:45] the fear of the Lord
[57:48] amen you ought to just go take your uh
[57:50] concordance and look up the fear of the
[57:53] Lord and and and the fear of God the uh
[57:57] these things and just look up all them
[57:59] scriptures of the benefits of those who
[58:02] have the fear of the Lord
[58:03] Angels again accompanying those that
[58:07] fear Him Now now uh uh Psalms 25 and 14
[58:11] it says the secret of the Lord and and
[58:14] of course we know what the secret is
[58:16] it's a mystery the secret of the Lord is
[58:19] what with them that fear Him and He will
[58:24] show them his Covenant so so this is is
[58:28] applicable to our day today is that the
[58:32] secret of the Lord that which has been
[58:34] hidden before the foundation of the
[58:36] world is with them where is it at not
[58:40] with God not kept in the mind of God but
[58:43] now it's with the people those that fear
[58:47] Him
[58:48] and notice and he will show them reveal
[58:52] to them his Covenant
[58:56] to who those that fear Him ain't that
[58:59] right so how do you know who really has
[59:02] the mystery of God revealed to them is
[59:04] is it because they know the Bible is it
[59:06] because they they can quote quotes and
[59:09] and and things like that no they have
[59:11] the fear of the Lord
[59:14] they have the fear of the Lord which is
[59:16] a sign that the mystery that they have
[59:19] the knowledge of God
[59:21] that that the secrets of God has been
[59:25] now given to them that fear Him
[59:29] ain't that rhyme amen and what has
[59:32] really been made known in this day have
[59:35] you ever just thought of that what is
[59:37] really made known to us brother Samaya
[59:39] it's the Covenant
[59:41] God made known his Covenant to those
[59:45] that fear Him
[59:47] a covenant that was made before we were
[59:50] ever here a covenant that was
[59:52] established and that's what has been
[59:55] made known to us that we weren't a saved
[59:58] just on any given day we was always
[1:00:00] saved it was a covenant that God would
[1:00:04] make for us can you say amen and it's in
[1:00:07] this day that the Mysteries being made
[1:00:09] known the secrets of God now it being
[1:00:12] imparted to us and what is imparted is
[1:00:16] the Covenant that God made with us
[1:00:20] and it's to those
[1:00:22] that fear Him
[1:00:24] so we we find how does he make the
[1:00:28] Covenant known to them
[1:00:29] by coming in person and confirming it to
[1:00:32] them amen not just intellectually but
[1:00:35] but confirming it by his presence
[1:00:39] now the fear of the Lord as we we read
[1:00:42] is the beginning of knowledge and I'd
[1:00:45] like for you to to look at Proverbs 1
[1:00:48] 28. it says then they shall call upon me
[1:00:52] but I will not answer
[1:00:55] they shall seek me early but they shall
[1:00:57] not find me for that they hated
[1:00:59] knowledge
[1:01:01] and did not choose the fear of the Lord
[1:01:04] they would none of my counsel they
[1:01:06] despised all my reproof therefore shall
[1:01:09] they eat of the fruit of their own way
[1:01:12] and be filled with their own devices
[1:01:15] for the Turning Away of the simple shall
[1:01:17] slave them and the prosperity of fools
[1:01:20] shall destroy them
[1:01:22] but whosoever hearkeneth unto me shall
[1:01:25] dwell safely and shall be quiet from
[1:01:28] fear of evil and you say Amen so so
[1:01:32] those that hearken and and again the
[1:01:35] fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[1:01:36] knowledge and so he that has his this
[1:01:40] knowledge in other words he that
[1:01:42] hearkens unto him shall dwell safely and
[1:01:46] no fear of evil shall come upon him
[1:01:49] but why because he has chose the fear of
[1:01:52] the Lord now there are people that are
[1:01:55] so into fear and gripped with the fear a
[1:01:59] man that is coming upon the Earth but
[1:02:01] why did it happen is they refused the
[1:02:04] knowledge and they chose not the fear of
[1:02:07] the Lord now there's going to be a fear
[1:02:10] that grips people out of the way either
[1:02:12] you'll have the fear that the devil is
[1:02:14] going to bring that's going to torment
[1:02:16] you and and is going to plague you and
[1:02:19] gonna afflict you or you're going to
[1:02:21] have the fear of the Lord
[1:02:23] that is going to bring a reverence but
[1:02:26] with that fear of the Lord you are
[1:02:28] promised to abide safely
[1:02:31] and you say man
[1:02:33] and so uh uh this fear shall not come
[1:02:37] upon him uh uh in other words it shall
[1:02:40] not attach itself oh it tries to come
[1:02:43] upon us all fear tries to come upon us
[1:02:46] all but one thing it cannot do it cannot
[1:02:49] attach itself because we have the fear
[1:02:53] of the Lord we that there is a reverence
[1:02:56] there is a respect unto God's word can
[1:02:59] you say Amen so therefore we're not
[1:03:01] going to cast aside our confidence and
[1:03:04] throw that away when we see the trouble
[1:03:06] amen and we're facing things that we
[1:03:09] can't we we we cannot take care of we're
[1:03:12] not going to throw the confidence away
[1:03:13] we have the fear of the Lord the Lord is
[1:03:16] our confidence
[1:03:18] you say man
[1:03:20] now if you notice uh um Proverbs 19 23
[1:03:25] the fear of the Lord tendeth to life
[1:03:29] and he that hath it shall abide
[1:03:32] satisfied
[1:03:34] and he shall not be visited with evil
[1:03:38] now now church if you can only
[1:03:40] understand that that God by his Mercy
[1:03:43] would impart knowledge to us in this day
[1:03:46] God by his Mercy would impart wisdom
[1:03:49] unto us in this day
[1:03:52] which is the beginning of the fear of
[1:03:55] the Lord
[1:03:56] ain't that right but he that haths the
[1:03:59] fear of the Lord shall abide satisfied
[1:04:01] he that half the fear of the Lord shall
[1:04:04] not be visited with evil
[1:04:07] destruction is coming
[1:04:09] it's in the land the plagues are here
[1:04:12] people are losing their faith people are
[1:04:14] losing their confidence people are just
[1:04:16] being so tormented and vets by the devil
[1:04:19] whether it be spiritually physically
[1:04:21] mentally it's it's happening everywhere
[1:04:24] but he that hath the fear of the Lord
[1:04:27] shall not be visited by evil
[1:04:30] ain't that right see why you're going to
[1:04:33] abide safely because the fear of the
[1:04:35] Lord tendeth to life why because God has
[1:04:38] already promised nobody can take your
[1:04:40] place
[1:04:41] nobody can can you say Amen so by the
[1:04:44] message of the hour by God revealing the
[1:04:46] mystery unto us and imparting the spirit
[1:04:49] of wisdom he's preserving life unto you
[1:04:52] he's preserving you for a rapture
[1:04:58] Noah
[1:05:00] is a great example of this scripture
[1:05:06] you shall not be visited with evil
[1:05:08] the fear of the Lord tendeth to life
[1:05:11] now listen there in Hebrews 11 and 8.
[1:05:15] by faith Noah being warned of God of
[1:05:18] things not seen as of yet
[1:05:21] now God warned him
[1:05:24] but notice he moved with fear
[1:05:28] everybody say move of fear
[1:05:32] and being moved with fear prepared an
[1:05:35] ark to the saving of his household
[1:05:38] ain't that right
[1:05:40] now now notice I want to go back and and
[1:05:42] I got a lot but but I'm not going to
[1:05:44] take long but I'm gonna just take my
[1:05:45] time for a minute the fear of the Lord
[1:05:47] tendeth to life
[1:05:49] ain't that right that fear of the Lord
[1:05:52] tendeth for to life now and then here
[1:05:55] the Bible is telling us now death was
[1:05:57] coming destruction was coming God
[1:05:59] already to warn Noah I'm going to
[1:06:01] destroy this world I'm getting rid of
[1:06:03] the sin I'm getting rid of the filth I'm
[1:06:04] getting rid of everything but it was the
[1:06:06] grace of God that came to Noah to give
[1:06:09] him that knowledge
[1:06:12] no one could have done whatever he
[1:06:14] wanted to he could have been just like
[1:06:16] the people of that day and said I don't
[1:06:17] believe it but he moved with fear
[1:06:21] the fear of the Lord took him a man and
[1:06:24] by that fear he prepared an ark
[1:06:29] and when the destruction was coming he
[1:06:32] was writing
[1:06:34] when people were drowning and the world
[1:06:36] was being destroyed him and his family
[1:06:39] were safe
[1:06:42] didn't you say man see he built the ark
[1:06:45] because he had the fear of the Lord he
[1:06:48] respected God's warning he respected he
[1:06:50] didn't say well I don't see the rain no
[1:06:52] he knew that God could make the rain
[1:06:56] he knew he had a reverence to God he
[1:06:59] didn't treat him just like some
[1:07:00] president out here that is just a flat
[1:07:02] liar making all these promises and a lot
[1:07:05] of these promises he tries to make but
[1:07:06] he's unable to fulfill them but God is
[1:07:08] not that type of God when God said
[1:07:10] something he means that he's going to do
[1:07:13] it I don't care if he has to create the
[1:07:15] rain he's going to do it I don't care if
[1:07:17] he has to create whatever you need he's
[1:07:19] going to do it and those that fear the
[1:07:22] lord
[1:07:25] and that's the way it is today we've
[1:07:27] been warned we know
[1:07:28] we know and we have the material to make
[1:07:31] ourselves ready
[1:07:32] can you say man I thought of the
[1:07:35] generation that sat there and listen to
[1:07:36] that prophet and they laughed at him
[1:07:38] they made fun of him they judged him by
[1:07:41] his education they judged him whether he
[1:07:43] could say pulpit
[1:07:45] or what is that other word pulpit
[1:07:48] amen and and they couldn't get past the
[1:07:51] the language they couldn't get past the
[1:07:53] the the the the the the the barrier of
[1:07:56] Education they they couldn't get past
[1:07:58] that little simple man they couldn't get
[1:08:00] past the fact a man that he didn't
[1:08:02] really you know I mean they've got a lot
[1:08:04] of things about brother random one of
[1:08:06] them he didn't know how to run money he
[1:08:07] didn't know how to deal with money well
[1:08:08] you know why he didn't know how to deal
[1:08:09] with money he gave his money away
[1:08:12] and they they write in their books and
[1:08:14] laugh at him and all of these things but
[1:08:16] what was going on it was a warning to
[1:08:19] the people of God
[1:08:21] and and they rejected it they called it
[1:08:23] the devil but look at their Generations
[1:08:25] today
[1:08:27] look at the world look at what they've
[1:08:28] done because they turned it down look at
[1:08:31] the world but there's a people today
[1:08:32] that are moved with fear
[1:08:34] that is preparing an ark
[1:08:37] that's preparing
[1:08:39] for the coming of the Lord
[1:08:40] why because they have respect under the
[1:08:43] word of God
[1:08:45] so he built the The Ark in reverence
[1:08:49] not carelessly carelessly he didn't say
[1:08:52] Okay God the warning's coming you okay
[1:08:55] that's fine I know how to do this thing
[1:08:58] no but God God God
[1:09:01] showed him the pattern
[1:09:03] and by reverence and and by fear unto
[1:09:06] the Lord he built it exactly the way God
[1:09:09] wanted it he builted exactly the way God
[1:09:11] showed him why he honored God's way of
[1:09:14] doing things he honored God's
[1:09:17] instructions for he had the fear of the
[1:09:20] Lord can you say amen and I say to you
[1:09:22] today there is a people on earth that is
[1:09:25] preparing in reverence they are
[1:09:27] preparing in respect to God Amen because
[1:09:31] they know the way God wants it done can
[1:09:33] you say Amen they know what kind of a
[1:09:35] people that we ought to be we they know
[1:09:38] what kind of a church God is after they
[1:09:41] know a man beyond a shadow of a doubt
[1:09:43] amen that God doesn't want his people in
[1:09:45] The Honky Tonks God doesn't want his
[1:09:48] people listen to the rock and roll in
[1:09:50] the country and and all this Christian
[1:09:52] rock as well amen God doesn't want all
[1:09:56] of this nonsense in the church in the
[1:09:58] home and so they're preparing
[1:10:01] getting rid of their televisions getting
[1:10:03] rid of their movies getting rid of the
[1:10:05] the hogwash that is round
[1:10:08] wow they're preparing
[1:10:13] you see
[1:10:14] God demands respect he demands reverence
[1:10:18] and it takes before you can do that in
[1:10:21] order to do that it takes having the
[1:10:23] fear of the Lord
[1:10:24] now we read where the Bible says they
[1:10:27] hated knowledge and chose not the fear
[1:10:30] of the Lord
[1:10:32] and and so the knowledge came the
[1:10:34] knowledge of God but it's not that they
[1:10:37] don't want knowledge
[1:10:39] uh uh because the Bible tells us that
[1:10:41] the people in this day would would be
[1:10:44] ever learning and never come to the
[1:10:46] knowledge of Truth
[1:10:47] so they're constantly learning and and
[1:10:51] Luke 7 16 8 Jesus said the children of
[1:10:54] this world are in their generation wiser
[1:10:58] than the children of light
[1:11:00] so they they've got a knowledge it's
[1:11:03] it's definitely a knowledge and and and
[1:11:05] they are fulfilling what Paul says in
[1:11:07] Romans 1 20 professing themselves to be
[1:11:10] wise they became fools
[1:11:13] ain't that right so they are wiser than
[1:11:15] the children of light but they've never
[1:11:18] come to the knowledge of Truth
[1:11:23] learning
[1:11:25] they're wiser in science they're wiser
[1:11:28] in technology they're they're wiser in
[1:11:31] education they're wiser in in their
[1:11:34] schools their their wiser in in all of
[1:11:37] these things and and and even brother
[1:11:39] Brown talks about even theologians that
[1:11:42] that could tie a man up with with the
[1:11:45] Bible he says you don't want to mess
[1:11:46] with a lot of them fundamentalists just
[1:11:48] simply because they know the Bible
[1:11:50] they're wiser amen but they don't come
[1:11:53] to the knowledge of the truth
[1:11:56] and because they've rejected the
[1:11:58] knowledge of truth that knowledge of God
[1:12:01] they have rejected
[1:12:04] uh of the fear of the Lord
[1:12:07] so we know that they haven't come to the
[1:12:11] knowledge of truth because there's no
[1:12:13] fear of the Lord
[1:12:14] Solomon of old
[1:12:17] tells us that there's only one way to
[1:12:19] understand the fear of the Lord
[1:12:22] and that's in Proverbs two and one it
[1:12:24] says my son if thou receive my words
[1:12:27] and notice again what he writes if thou
[1:12:32] receive my words and hide my
[1:12:33] Commandments with thee
[1:12:37] so that thou incline thine ear unto
[1:12:40] wisdom
[1:12:41] and apply thine heart to understanding
[1:12:44] yea if thou Christ after knowledge
[1:12:49] and if thou Lift us up thy voice for
[1:12:51] understanding
[1:12:53] if thou seekest her as silver and
[1:12:55] searches her for uh for her as for his
[1:12:58] treasures then Thou shalt understand the
[1:13:02] fear of the Lord and find the knowledge
[1:13:04] of God
[1:13:06] ain't that right so a person must
[1:13:08] receive the word of the Lord and hide it
[1:13:10] within them
[1:13:12] now Church you know uh the psalmist says
[1:13:15] Thy word have I hid in my heart that I'd
[1:13:16] sin not against thee so there there is a
[1:13:20] a something that we all have to do here
[1:13:23] is not just hear the word but hide the
[1:13:25] word not not just taking the word and
[1:13:28] say yes I believe it but watch what the
[1:13:30] devil will do out them doors is try his
[1:13:34] best if he can't do it from here in the
[1:13:37] church then he'll do it out there in
[1:13:39] your trials and in in everything else
[1:13:41] around he's after the word in your heart
[1:13:45] and you have to hide it you have to
[1:13:47] guard that word with everything that's
[1:13:49] within you you've got to guard it in
[1:13:51] other words quit listening to Tommy Rock
[1:13:53] quit listening to the things of the
[1:13:55] world quit listening to the grumbling
[1:13:56] quick listening to the the backbiting
[1:13:58] quit listening to the division quit
[1:14:00] listening to all unbelief and guard that
[1:14:03] word in your heart and then you'll know
[1:14:05] you'll know you'll begin to understand
[1:14:06] the fear of the Lord
[1:14:09] so he says you see if if if if they'll
[1:14:12] incline their ear to wisdom and apply
[1:14:14] their their their heart to understanding
[1:14:16] see it takes a person hungering for the
[1:14:18] knowledge of God and and crying out for
[1:14:21] for understanding can you say man but
[1:14:24] it's in that crying it's in that hunger
[1:14:26] it's in that desire and it's in that
[1:14:28] receiving of the word and guarding that
[1:14:31] word you begin to understand the fear of
[1:14:33] the Lord
[1:14:38] God
[1:14:39] the fear of the Lord puts a person in
[1:14:42] all and in this word all
[1:14:44] according to Webster is is at admiration
[1:14:47] reverence
[1:14:49] reverential fear
[1:14:51] and emotion variously combining dread
[1:14:55] veneration and wonder that is inspired
[1:14:58] by Authority
[1:15:01] or by the sacred or Sublime
[1:15:05] and I thought that that's that's
[1:15:07] incredible the it puts a person in all
[1:15:11] and and and that that all
[1:15:15] is inspired by one of authority
[1:15:18] by an authority
[1:15:20] and
[1:15:23] I I thought if our if our lawmakers had
[1:15:26] the fear of the Lord that they would be
[1:15:28] careful as to what laws they passed
[1:15:31] if the world had the fear of the Lord
[1:15:33] they'd be careful as to what they
[1:15:35] supported if if churches had the fear of
[1:15:37] the Lord they'd be careful not to
[1:15:38] condone the sin that they're condoning
[1:15:41] around the world
[1:15:43] see the fear of the Lord
[1:15:46] is an awareness
[1:15:48] of how great God is
[1:15:51] he's faithful he's true
[1:15:55] He reigns forever
[1:15:57] there there is no words to describe God
[1:16:02] and his kingdom his Reign his
[1:16:06] just his character his person
[1:16:09] but once it becomes a reality of who he
[1:16:12] is it brings an all for he is one of
[1:16:15] authority
[1:16:16] he is one of that's in control it it
[1:16:20] brings an awareness as to how holy and
[1:16:22] righteous God is and as we read in the
[1:16:25] scriptures and and any experience with
[1:16:27] God that one would have
[1:16:29] it shows that we know that God is high
[1:16:32] and exalted
[1:16:34] ain't that right
[1:16:35] so when people don't have the fear of
[1:16:37] the Lord then they they it shows that
[1:16:39] they don't see him as the high and
[1:16:41] exalted God
[1:16:43] and this generation this generation
[1:16:46] turning down the message that God has
[1:16:48] sent to us is a sign that they chose not
[1:16:50] the fear of the Lord
[1:16:52] they they couldn't get past they
[1:16:54] couldn't see past that that you know the
[1:16:57] Flesh of that hillbilly Kentuckian that
[1:16:59] only had the seventh grade education and
[1:17:02] of course brother Branham preached them
[1:17:04] the sermon the presence of God
[1:17:06] unrecognized
[1:17:07] they didn't recognize that it was God so
[1:17:10] they didn't fear Him they didn't they
[1:17:12] didn't fear God they they they they saw
[1:17:15] it that it was just you know I wished I
[1:17:17] had the quotes before me but brother
[1:17:19] Branham said what what makes God great
[1:17:21] is he's so humble
[1:17:23] he can get his low he can go low he said
[1:17:26] greatness is humility
[1:17:28] and so if you're going to see the
[1:17:29] greatness of God you look got to look
[1:17:31] through the at the humility of things
[1:17:33] and not at the greatness of things
[1:17:35] because what man considers great is is
[1:17:38] is it
[1:17:39] stinks before God right
[1:17:42] and and so they they tried to look at
[1:17:44] for God through what they consider great
[1:17:47] right
[1:17:48] but you can't see the greatness of God
[1:17:51] until you see the humility of God
[1:17:55] that's why God would choose us
[1:17:58] humble
[1:18:00] flesh mortal right
[1:18:03] so God was supernaturally in that
[1:18:07] Prophet proving his word and yet they
[1:18:10] couldn't see it
[1:18:11] and the prophet tried his best to teach
[1:18:14] teach them
[1:18:16] the fear of the Lord
[1:18:17] teach them uh uh there and he tried his
[1:18:21] best to show them who really was in
[1:18:25] their midst who who the presence of God
[1:18:28] it was different and yet they they
[1:18:31] couldn't see it and they chose not the
[1:18:33] fear of the Lord ain't that right
[1:18:35] and and and so it reminds me of what the
[1:18:38] Prophet Jeremiah said in Jeremiah 5 21.
[1:18:42] where it says here now this o foolish
[1:18:44] people and without understanding which
[1:18:46] have eyes and see not and have ears and
[1:18:48] hear not
[1:18:49] fear ye not me
[1:18:52] saith the Lord will you not tremble at
[1:18:54] my presence which have placed the sand
[1:18:57] for the bound of the Sea by Perpetual
[1:19:00] decree that it cannot pass and though
[1:19:02] the ways thereof toss themselves yet
[1:19:04] they cannot can they not Prevail though
[1:19:07] they Roar yet can they not pass over it
[1:19:10] but this people has a revolting and a
[1:19:13] rebellious heart they are revolted and
[1:19:15] gone neither say in their heart now let
[1:19:18] us fear our the Lord Our God see that
[1:19:21] that giveth rain both the former and the
[1:19:23] latter in his season
[1:19:25] he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks
[1:19:28] of the Harvest see your iniquities have
[1:19:30] have turned your iniquities have turned
[1:19:33] away these things and your sins have
[1:19:35] withholden good things from you and and
[1:19:38] so we we find that that it's because
[1:19:42] they did not have the fear of the Lord
[1:19:45] you see when a man recognizes the
[1:19:47] presence of God then then it brings a
[1:19:51] the fear of the Lord to him and you say
[1:19:54] man see you you cannot know who he is
[1:19:57] and know that you're standing in his
[1:19:59] presence and not have a reverence and a
[1:20:01] respect for him
[1:20:03] and and and and that was the that was
[1:20:05] the problem with the church the very God
[1:20:07] I mean the scripture was fulfilled where
[1:20:10] Jesus said behold I stand at the door
[1:20:12] and knock
[1:20:14] where was he he's outside the church and
[1:20:16] what the world didn't know by rejecting
[1:20:19] that hillbilly Kentucky and they were
[1:20:21] rejecting and rejecting his message they
[1:20:24] were fulfilling the very scripture and
[1:20:26] Jesus was standing on the outside of the
[1:20:29] door trying to get back into the church
[1:20:32] because they didn't recognize the
[1:20:34] presence of God they didn't recognize a
[1:20:37] man who really it was yes brother
[1:20:40] Branham is a man we all know that that
[1:20:42] don't take a uh only a perverted mind
[1:20:45] would would think that brother Brandon
[1:20:47] was God
[1:20:49] but TLX knows that brother Branham
[1:20:51] wasn't God but it was God in that
[1:20:53] prophet
[1:20:54] God revealing it showing it
[1:20:57] supernaturally amen to where they had to
[1:21:00] choose not to have the fear of the Lord
[1:21:03] they had to choose just like everyone
[1:21:07] today has to choose you choose how
[1:21:10] you'll be you'll choose what you're you
[1:21:12] just choose it's your choice you'll
[1:21:14] choose how your day is going to be
[1:21:16] you're you can't help but uh with the
[1:21:18] the circumstances that come here to you
[1:21:21] in the day but you choose on how you're
[1:21:23] going to act react to them you choose
[1:21:25] and and how you know when the Trials
[1:21:28] Come how you're going to react you
[1:21:30] choose them things
[1:21:31] and you'll either choose the fear of the
[1:21:33] Lord or you'll choose not to you'll
[1:21:36] choose the knowledge of the Lord you'll
[1:21:37] choose to meditate on them we've got so
[1:21:40] much knowledge today of God that has
[1:21:43] been given to us to to where we know
[1:21:45] amen every aspect of our life every part
[1:21:48] I don't care where the Devil comes in at
[1:21:50] we know how to how to react to these
[1:21:53] things
[1:21:55] we know
[1:21:57] that he that hates the knowledge of God
[1:21:59] chooses not to fear of the Lord
[1:22:06] Isaiah 6 and 1 in the year that King
[1:22:09] Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting
[1:22:12] upon a throne high and lifted up in his
[1:22:14] train filled the temple
[1:22:16] above it stood the seraphims each one
[1:22:19] had six wings with Twain he covered his
[1:22:21] face and between he covered his feet and
[1:22:23] with Twain he did fly and one Cried unto
[1:22:25] another and said holy holy holy is the
[1:22:28] Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of
[1:22:30] his glory
[1:22:31] and the post of the door moved at the
[1:22:34] voice of him that cried and the house
[1:22:35] was filled with smoke notice Isaiah now
[1:22:39] was in the presence of God
[1:22:42] and he recognized it remember as the
[1:22:45] prophet talked an influence several
[1:22:47] sermons of influence he he idolized King
[1:22:50] Uzziah and when uziah died he was like
[1:22:53] okay you know what what's to become of
[1:22:56] me now I mean his everything was
[1:22:59] attached to Uzziah
[1:23:01] but then the Lord came
[1:23:03] and revealed himself that was so greater
[1:23:06] than Uzziah
[1:23:08] Uzziah back slid
[1:23:11] and he was showing the greatness of
[1:23:14] himself to Isaiah and notice the the
[1:23:18] impact that Isaiah had then said I woe
[1:23:21] is me for I am undone because I am a man
[1:23:23] of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst
[1:23:26] of a people of unclean lips for my eyes
[1:23:28] have seen the king the Lord of hosts he
[1:23:32] realized that he was in the presence of
[1:23:34] the Lord and and the prophet said in the
[1:23:36] presence of God a man recognizes himself
[1:23:39] to be a sinner because his presence is
[1:23:42] Holy his he is Holy he's pure he's
[1:23:46] righteous he's he's the great God
[1:23:48] Almighty ain't that right and and so you
[1:23:51] could imagine being in the greatness of
[1:23:53] a person in the presence of some great
[1:23:55] person whether it be the the king of
[1:23:58] England or queen or or you know some
[1:24:02] president or or or or something there's
[1:24:05] something about them that that puts you
[1:24:07] at just a weird feeling it it just it
[1:24:10] brings a respect you're in in the
[1:24:12] presence of greatness but here here when
[1:24:15] you come into the presence of God you
[1:24:18] you can't come into the presence of God
[1:24:20] without realizing you're in the presence
[1:24:23] of of an authority a man that could just
[1:24:26] speak the word and and everything but
[1:24:28] just stop
[1:24:31] time would stop
[1:24:33] and you say Amen
[1:24:36] talked of how he was hunting with that
[1:24:39] his friend Bert call
[1:24:41] got saved and they're out in the
[1:24:43] mountains in the adirondikes and
[1:24:46] he said they they climbed a mountain and
[1:24:47] they were overlooking everything he's so
[1:24:49] so breathtaking and he says you know
[1:24:52] that Bert said Gee Bill Aces
[1:24:55] this is this is just a wonder he says it
[1:24:58] makes a man feel small he said just
[1:25:00] makes a man feel small and brother Brown
[1:25:02] said just just being there he said that
[1:25:06] was the only connection that he would
[1:25:10] have with the presence of God just
[1:25:13] seeing creation
[1:25:15] and he realized that God made all of
[1:25:17] this and it was just so beautiful it it
[1:25:20] brought an awareness of the greatness of
[1:25:22] God just being out in the out in the
[1:25:24] mountains and in nature that it just
[1:25:26] caused him to feel so little in his
[1:25:29] presence
[1:25:31] it changes a man
[1:25:34] and and so we we find you know
[1:25:38] Brother Brad I'm talking he said you
[1:25:40] know that's a man that wrote How Great
[1:25:42] Thou Art he said I could just imagine he
[1:25:44] penned them words one night as he's
[1:25:46] looking at the stars and he's he's just
[1:25:49] thinking of how all these stars are
[1:25:52] billions of miles apart and and and yet
[1:25:56] you know and there's millions of them
[1:25:58] and and yet the Bible says they call it
[1:26:00] God calls them all by name
[1:26:03] and and yet they as as it may be looking
[1:26:06] at them and how close they seem to be
[1:26:07] but yet they're miles apart and billions
[1:26:10] of miles and things but something
[1:26:12] inspired just by seeing that he saw how
[1:26:16] great God is he sold the greatness and
[1:26:19] it brought a fear of God that he began
[1:26:22] to just pin the words How Great Thou Art
[1:26:26] then sings my soul
[1:26:29] ain't that right
[1:26:31] see somehow or another it's always
[1:26:34] throws a great effect upon people to
[1:26:37] come into the presence of God
[1:26:39] brother Brown said I've seen the time in
[1:26:41] my Ministry when you would see the
[1:26:43] presence of God come into such a place
[1:26:45] that would bring a person up and just
[1:26:48] reveal the life to them and call out
[1:26:49] their sins and all of all kinds of
[1:26:52] immoral acts and bring it such a holy
[1:26:54] hush among the people till they drop out
[1:26:56] of the prayer line before they could
[1:26:58] ever come up to be prayed for and run to
[1:27:00] the Altar and get right with God before
[1:27:02] they come into His presence
[1:27:05] see it the power and the presence of God
[1:27:08] brings such a holy fear until you're
[1:27:10] just paralyzed in in his presence I I
[1:27:13] thought of Adam you know when he first
[1:27:15] sinned he tried to cover himself up and
[1:27:18] and thought he was going to meet God
[1:27:19] that way but then the time to meet God
[1:27:21] and here comes God coming down in that
[1:27:24] Garden in the presence of God starts
[1:27:26] coming closer and closer and Adam began
[1:27:29] to feel just like an awful sinner he
[1:27:31] just felt so awful that he ran and hid
[1:27:33] from the presence of God it it see it
[1:27:37] and the prophet said see sin was upon
[1:27:40] his soul sin and and he could not he
[1:27:43] could not come into the presence of God
[1:27:45] he couldn't approach god with sin upon
[1:27:48] his soul right and and he says he
[1:27:51] realized that when the presence of God
[1:27:53] came he could not hide he knew he
[1:27:56] couldn't hide because his soul was still
[1:27:59] tender
[1:28:02] he hadn't sinned a whole lot he hadn't
[1:28:04] drug himself through all the corruption
[1:28:06] that people have today to where people
[1:28:09] are so hard that they literally think
[1:28:11] they could approach God and stand there
[1:28:13] amen and and defy him
[1:28:16] that Adam couldn't Adam couldn't come
[1:28:19] into the presence of God and and and in
[1:28:22] that way was so sin upon his soul
[1:28:24] because his soul was still tender
[1:28:28] and he ran
[1:28:30] right
[1:28:31] he hid in the bushes the prophet said
[1:28:33] and wouldn't come out until God provided
[1:28:35] an atonement
[1:28:36] but we find many many people throughout
[1:28:40] the Bible that was changed coming into
[1:28:44] the presence of God Moses born to be a
[1:28:46] prophet and he's learned in all the ways
[1:28:49] of the Egyptians he was smart educated
[1:28:51] trained in Psychology and he understood
[1:28:53] that he was to deliver his people uh the
[1:28:56] Israelites and he knowed all the ins and
[1:28:58] outs about all these things he the
[1:29:00] prophet said he knowed the scripture
[1:29:02] from A to Z he knowed all the promises
[1:29:04] that God made he knew that he was the
[1:29:06] one he was taught by his mom but he knew
[1:29:09] it only by theological standpoint
[1:29:13] and yet he was going to try and all of
[1:29:15] his power to deliver the the children of
[1:29:18] Israel
[1:29:19] he thought I can do this people fear me
[1:29:22] because he was educated he taught he
[1:29:24] taught the Egyptians
[1:29:27] so he tried in his way of psychology to
[1:29:31] deliver the people
[1:29:32] LeBron said psychology won't deliver the
[1:29:35] people
[1:29:36] can you say man
[1:29:38] but when he stood in the presence of God
[1:29:41] at that burning bush he forgot
[1:29:44] everything
[1:29:45] he forgot his abilities he forgot his
[1:29:48] talents he forgot it all because he come
[1:29:51] into the presence of God and it brought
[1:29:54] a respect to him
[1:29:57] brought a fear
[1:29:59] of God and he fell upon his face like
[1:30:02] Abraham did because he could not stand
[1:30:03] in the presence of God can you say Amen
[1:30:08] prophets say when a man stands in the
[1:30:09] presence of God he realizes there's
[1:30:11] something lacking within himself
[1:30:13] no matter how talented a person may be
[1:30:15] no matter how educated a person is no
[1:30:17] matter how smart
[1:30:18] Rich whatever whatever we would think
[1:30:22] that would get us by
[1:30:25] when you come into the presence of God
[1:30:26] you really find out that there's lacking
[1:30:30] and it brings or it should be it should
[1:30:34] bring the fear of the Lord
[1:30:37] because you realize
[1:30:40] that his presence is far greater than
[1:30:42] yours his talents his word everything
[1:30:44] that he is is far greater
[1:30:46] look at Paul in all the education
[1:30:50] his education seemed as nothing when he
[1:30:52] come into the presence of God
[1:30:53] Philippians 3 8 and he says I count all
[1:30:55] things but loss for the Excellency of
[1:30:58] the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord
[1:31:00] whom I have suffered the loss of all
[1:31:02] things and do count them but dung that I
[1:31:05] may win Christ
[1:31:06] and be found in him not having mine on
[1:31:09] righteous see he he he learned the fear
[1:31:11] of the Lord
[1:31:13] the 13th verse Paul said Brethren I
[1:31:16] count not myself to have apprehended but
[1:31:18] this one thing I do forgetting those
[1:31:19] things which are behind and reaching
[1:31:21] forth unto those things which are before
[1:31:23] I press toward the mark for the prize of
[1:31:25] the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus
[1:31:28] ain't that right so on and on and on
[1:31:31] holy men uh um recognize themselves as
[1:31:35] Sinners and if holy men of God that was
[1:31:39] anointed of God that was used of God
[1:31:41] recognize themselves as sinners in the
[1:31:43] presence of God then where will the
[1:31:47] ungodly
[1:31:48] where would the sinner appear
[1:31:51] in the presence of God
[1:31:54] right
[1:31:56] brother Brown says what will people do
[1:31:58] who has sent in the meetings what will
[1:31:59] people do that seen the power of God
[1:32:01] that's heard the countdown on the word
[1:32:03] that seen God manifest himself and
[1:32:05] beyond a shadow of a doubt every
[1:32:06] scripture fulfilled and will strive to
[1:32:09] try still try to make heaven without
[1:32:11] being born again and receive the Holy
[1:32:13] Ghost
[1:32:14] what's going to happen to them what kind
[1:32:15] of a place are we going to stand in if
[1:32:18] we see God unfold himself right before
[1:32:20] us and see the glory of God just the
[1:32:23] same as them men did and that kind of
[1:32:25] men Cried Out prophets and sages upon
[1:32:28] whom the word is based upon if they
[1:32:31] cried and fell to their feet and
[1:32:33] screamed I'm a man of Unholy lips
[1:32:35] uncleanness what will it be then for
[1:32:38] that man who won't even confess his sins
[1:32:41] what will it be for that teenager that
[1:32:43] won't confess his or her sins what will
[1:32:45] it be for that hard-hearted man that
[1:32:47] thinks he knows more about God's
[1:32:48] creation than God himself what will it
[1:32:51] be to that man that spent all of his
[1:32:53] life trying to disprove the Bible and
[1:32:55] where will that guy appear
[1:32:58] see there are those who could walk in
[1:33:00] the presence of God and pay no attention
[1:33:03] to it it shows he wasn't ordained alive
[1:33:06] but if he's a predestinated of God as
[1:33:09] soon as that first move hits he knows it
[1:33:12] and that fire catches
[1:33:15] can you say man
[1:33:16] now church as I close we have seen the
[1:33:20] glory of God like Abraham saw it
[1:33:22] we have seen the pillar of Fire
[1:33:25] like Moses saw it
[1:33:27] we have seen the mighty works
[1:33:30] as the prophets of old have seen it
[1:33:32] we've seen the same power of God we have
[1:33:35] seen the same manifestation of Christ
[1:33:36] revealing himself showing himself
[1:33:40] keeping his word in these last days we
[1:33:42] have seen the work of Melchizedek the
[1:33:45] way Abraham saw it
[1:33:47] we have seen the sign of the Messiah the
[1:33:50] way the Samaritan woman saw it
[1:33:53] and you say Amen
[1:33:55] it should bring the fear of the Lord
[1:33:58] not trying to uh serve him by our own
[1:34:01] talents not trying to that that would be
[1:34:03] like a Moses before he come into the
[1:34:05] presence of the Lord
[1:34:06] that would be like a Paul or a soul that
[1:34:09] that tried his own wisdom before he come
[1:34:11] into the presence of the Lord but we
[1:34:13] have seen the presence of the Lord we
[1:34:15] have been in the presence of the Lord
[1:34:20] you should bring a fear of the Lord upon
[1:34:22] us
[1:34:23] can you say Amen
[1:34:26] programs says how can people walk by and
[1:34:29] treat it so lightly after seeing what we
[1:34:31] have seen
[1:34:32] how can we walk around and hold to our
[1:34:34] Creeds and denominations and have
[1:34:36] respect to the word of God you can't do
[1:34:37] it
[1:34:39] what will happen to this generation
[1:34:42] who has seen the glory of God
[1:34:44] and yet have turned it down
[1:34:47] you know the old proverb says what fools
[1:34:51] will walk with hob-nailed shoes Where
[1:34:54] Angels feared to trot
[1:34:57] this world has
[1:35:00] has taken their soul people have drugged
[1:35:03] their souls and sinned so much to where
[1:35:05] they're so numb to the presence of God
[1:35:08] they have gotten used to so much sin
[1:35:10] they've got so much used to so much
[1:35:12] things that you become numb
[1:35:16] you're in what the prophet said about
[1:35:17] that little boy
[1:35:18] you know when he first time he he takes
[1:35:21] a cookie out of the cookie jar
[1:35:23] and Mama tells them says
[1:35:25] son did you you you take that cookie
[1:35:28] no ma'am I didn't take that cookie he
[1:35:31] said in his conscience is telling him
[1:35:33] yes you did tell the truth you did he
[1:35:36] says no no I didn't take that cookie and
[1:35:38] he gets away with it
[1:35:40] he's then he'll tell another lie and
[1:35:42] another lie and another lie he said in
[1:35:45] every light takes that conscience is
[1:35:47] becoming more numb and more numb it
[1:35:50] becomes easier to lie then it becomes
[1:35:52] easier to do things it becomes easier
[1:35:55] right
[1:35:57] before you know it he grows up lies to
[1:36:00] the law he becomes a law breaker thinks
[1:36:02] nothing of it
[1:36:04] because his conscience is becoming more
[1:36:06] seared and more seared the more you keep
[1:36:10] looking at that pornography the more of
[1:36:12] your conscience is being seared
[1:36:14] the more you keep looking at things that
[1:36:17] should not be the more your conscience
[1:36:18] is being seared
[1:36:20] to where it becomes easier to do it it
[1:36:22] becomes easier to to gossip it becomes
[1:36:25] easier to listen to the garbage it just
[1:36:28] becomes easier to to revote against the
[1:36:31] word of God it just becomes easier Amen
[1:36:34] to despise good and to to to accept uh
[1:36:38] sin and it just becomes easier can you
[1:36:41] say man but there is a people that that
[1:36:43] is is looking and as not dragging their
[1:36:47] soul through all this filth and all the
[1:36:49] smut and all these things we want the
[1:36:52] fear of the Lord we we have accepted the
[1:36:55] knowledge of God can you say Amen yes
[1:36:58] sir it's it's amazing these days that
[1:37:00] now you've got people that claiming to
[1:37:03] be in the messes that that that will not
[1:37:05] hear a preacher anymore and and they've
[1:37:08] given every excuse and and not to come
[1:37:10] to the house of God sitting at home
[1:37:12] listening on the internet and all of
[1:37:14] these things and you'll ask them I've
[1:37:15] asked them well what does it say about
[1:37:17] the Bible where it says for sake not the
[1:37:19] assembling of themselves and together
[1:37:20] and they'll totally ignore that
[1:37:22] scripture amen it's something that's
[1:37:24] happening and there's nothing there to
[1:37:27] grasp it
[1:37:28] now it does take the mercy of God and I
[1:37:30] still believe in the mercy of God but
[1:37:31] I'm just telling you where we're at
[1:37:33] today
[1:37:35] we need to fear we need to choose the
[1:37:38] knowledge of God
[1:37:39] and the wisdom of God
[1:37:41] which is the beginning
[1:37:44] the fear of the Lord can you say Amen
[1:37:53] Isaiah 14 or Psalms 14 1 says the fool
[1:37:56] hath said in his heart there is no God
[1:37:58] how did it get to that point
[1:38:00] because he has no fear of the Lord
[1:38:04] God can manifest himself as he has seven
[1:38:07] times around the world that God manifest
[1:38:09] himself
[1:38:12] and to think of it a generation today
[1:38:14] hardly even knows what God done
[1:38:17] right it should have been broadcast it
[1:38:20] should have been spread out throughout
[1:38:22] the world if the world would have caught
[1:38:23] it
[1:38:24] like they have spread and propaganda of
[1:38:28] Billy Graham and oral Robertson and all
[1:38:30] of these others
[1:38:32] if they would have caught the message of
[1:38:33] the hour you would have less people
[1:38:35] saying there is no God because it was
[1:38:38] that message that proved there was a gut
[1:38:41] can you say man
[1:38:42] if the musicians will come Psalms 119 63
[1:38:46] he says I am a companion
[1:38:49] of all them that fear they
[1:38:52] and of them that keep thy precepts
[1:38:56] that's where our fellowship is
[1:38:58] that's the ones I want to be identified
[1:39:00] with
[1:39:01] can you say man a companion of all them
[1:39:05] that feareth thee and of them that keep
[1:39:08] thy precepts
[1:39:10] the Lord is good isn't he
[1:39:13] got so much more to go
[1:39:16] but I look at psalm 16 8 it says I have
[1:39:19] set the lord always before me
[1:39:21] [Music]
[1:39:23] he did this
[1:39:25] so he wouldn't be confused about it he
[1:39:28] wanted to be conscious of the presence
[1:39:30] of the Lord
[1:39:33] because once you
[1:39:35] lose sight of the presence of the Lord
[1:39:37] you lose sight of the knowledge of God
[1:39:40] it becomes an intellectual thing to us
[1:39:44] and then ultimately
[1:39:46] we lose the fear of the Lord
[1:39:49] [Music]
[1:39:53] that the prophet said see by David
[1:39:55] saying I have set the lord always before
[1:39:57] me he's saying that David put God first
[1:40:00] and then brother Branham says put him
[1:40:04] first
[1:40:05] then you won't sin
[1:40:08] when you are realizing that constantly
[1:40:10] you're in the presence of God
[1:40:13] when you realize that God is around
[1:40:15] you'll watch
[1:40:18] what you say
[1:40:21] when a man thinks that God is gone he
[1:40:23] has no knowledge of God
[1:40:25] the presence of God
[1:40:29] he'll cuss
[1:40:32] how many how many people claim to be
[1:40:34] Christians because think nothing of it
[1:40:41] swear
[1:40:43] ain't nothing of it
[1:40:45] brother Brown said he'll lust after
[1:40:46] women
[1:40:48] you'll cheat lie steal
[1:40:51] because he has no consciousness of the
