going around everywhere it seems like and uh so uh those that have um of you that have recovered and we just really thank the Lord for watching over you and um and some are still under the weather and different ones are out of town and so we want to just keep them in our prayer and um appreciate uh brother Josiah for filling in for me last uh Wednesday amen and um praise the Lord just uh good to know that there's men preaching the the message and amen and the people that are believing it amen amen uh before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and just talk to our Lord For a Moment father as we come to you we realize our need for you father and Lord may we never become self-sufficient to where we feel like we don't need you but Lord we realize we need you more every day and I pray father that you would just come Among Us this morning and meet every need father for you alone can meet the needs I pray father that you would just not let it just be words that are spoken today but Lord may you just come and use this vessel Lord and anoint and speak through me father to your people father we want to be drawn closer to you we want to be better Christians and Lord I know that you can help us to be that father Lord any spirit that would try to hinder today I pray Lord that you would just drive it from us now we ask it in Jesus Christ's name name and the church says amen amen amen uh The Book of Matthew the 20th chapter and um going to I guess start at the 20th verse then came to him the mother of zebede children with her sons worshiping him and Desiring a certain thing of him and he said unto her what Willl thou and she said unto him grant that these my two sons May sit the one on the thy right hand the other on the left in thy kingdom but Jesus answered and said you know not what you ask are you able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of and to be baptized with the baptism that I am I am baptized with and they said unto him we are able and he saith unto them you shall drink and eat of my cup and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my father and when the 10 heard it they were moved with indignation against the two Brethren but Jesus called them unto him and said you know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them and they that are great exercise Authority upon them but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister and whosoever shall be Chief among you let him be your servant even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many amen you can have your seats this morning and going to Endeavor just to continue on from last Sunday and I guess if I use a title it' just be the son of man came to minister and um hopefully just to make sense to you and and um just like to just share from my heart but um we we know that there there are so many people that need the Lord amen I think we could all agree to that and not only um on the outside of the church but I think there are many needs here that are present and I I think um um you know as long as we live in this life we're always going to have needs always going to have things and and um but I would like to maybe deal with the needs outside the church here and um talk or talk about that type of a need but for years uh now people have known of the Lord uh we we've it's been talked about preached about sung about and these things but it's they've known him from a theological standpoint and uh but it's it's not seemingly helping the people and um we've got churches on every corner it seems uh more churches and more books that are written more things uh to help people but seems like the people aren't being helped it it just seems like the um uh more evil more needs more more things like that and I I really believe that the people need to see God in action and they need to experience him in a special way today we are dealing with all manners of sickness and and it's it's not just physical sickness even though that seems to be more prevalent than ever before is is physical sickness but we're dealing with people that have mental sickness as well and it's it's a lot of mental sickness um and brother brandom even talked about it that people are just going insane and so then it it it's the mind is being attacked and and but then there's a greater sickness than even that and that's the sickness of the Soul it's a spiritual sickness and for centuries man has tried to help those that are in need it just seems to be man putting that responsibility upon themselves to to help those and so we've uh we have built hospitals uh to help those that that are in need uh there's been San asylums that have been built uh to help those in need there's been charity organizations there's been food banks there's there's been uh all kinds of programs um that have been established to to help uh um uh to help those that are in need and and to Target different areas in an individual's life or whatever then we find that man has built Bible schools seminaries and things like that to uh uh help ministers be able to to preach better and to enable them to help uh and be more effective to the people uh we we've we've gotten now marriage seminars that have been pretty prominent Financial seminars and and and they seem to be in a real high demand uh today because of of the need that is great and but but there's never been a lack of human effort uh put forth to help those in need in some way or another and and all of these are Ministries in their own way we've got drug programs to help uh the drug addict you know we've got uh alcoholic programs uh to help the alcoholics and and things like that but when it's all said and done it's it's it's Humanity trying to cure Humanity from their problems and and help humanity and it's in a in a carnal way does God use doctors yes he he does and we certainly don't condemn doctors but we know the doctor cannot heal and and we know that that no matter what the doctor does and how much training he has he's Limited in in uh in what he can do uh he can cut out the the appendix or cut out the the um you know the gallbladder he can he he can do whatever he he wants to I actually just read where uh uh they formed performed the first surgery on an eye of replacing the eyeball and they're they're becoming pretty smart in in their technology of what they can do but in all reality it takes God to do the healing a dentist can take out a tooth but it takes God to to heal that that area and and so the Bible says you know in Psalms 103 and2 bless the Lord oh my soul forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thy diseases who health or forgiveth all thine iniquities who Health all thy diseases reading the prophet he says that God heals by medicine God heals by music God heals by love God heals by care God heals by Miracles God heals by understanding God heals by prayer and and and so he says God has many ways of healing it just depends on what type uh uh you need see sometimes a little love stretched out will cure an old SAR an old place that's been a grudge or something it'll heal he'll right he heal it right over Just a Little Love a Little care sometimes when you feel all down and as we call it a street expression down in the dumps we we just put on one of those tapes that of music and or record or and just go to playing it and the first thing you know you're patting your foot or your hand and then it's all over then see you're right up and ready to go again so see God heals in so many different ways amen uh but and and and and not every doctor is a holy ghost filled Christian not every musician that plays gospel songs uh is is a holy ghost filled uh believer not every singer that sings gospel songs is Holy Ghost filled not every person that displays love and compassion is Holy Ghost fi amen uh uh and and of course what what they're doing is in the human realm you know just as a person um uh that's not Holy Ghost filled they can display love and care and compassion and yet it's it's only a human care it's a human compassion a human love and and yet people are helped by that um uh people are helped um there's there's uh many organizations and charity functions and things like that that that help people and yet it's only in a natural way um uh that is has been help and so uh people can have understanding toward another person's need and not even have the Holy Ghost and that's because they've been down that path um there's women that have been molested or raped or whatever that they they have devoted their time to help other women that have been in that same situation well they understand understand what them people have gone through and and so they're doing everything they can uh in a human way to to help and and and and there's been many that have been helped uh uh in in these in these ways and and so uh but when it's all said and done people need the Lord do you believe that people need the Lord um it's you know we can help people in in in many ways uh uh we can give food to the poor we can uh give clothes to those that need clothes we can give money to those that need money and and all these things but where what a what does it Avail them if their destination isn't isn't to meet the Lord or to be with the Lord if if we're not helping them in that way so there are all kinds of Ministries established through human compassion in human love and yet never never leading people to Christ there are Christian Ministries uh that that are effective today in so many ways and yet they deny uh the manifestation of Jesus Christ today they may be able to help some people physically or emotionally and mentally but they've not been able to help the soul of man the of man and and so as I was saying last Sunday that Jesus's Ministry uh wasn't about building hospitals or establishing charity organizations it wasn't about giving money to the poor even though he could have done it it wasn't about um building homes for people that that um uh were homeless even though he could have done it he he that he was just God ain't that right but it it wasn't his ministry wasn't about uh uh bringing reform to people and and helping them in in in them them types of ways and and yet he he could have done it uh uh and so but he his ministry was a Ministry that operated outside the medical field or outside the scientific field and and these things it was a Ministry of Deliverance do you believe that it was a Ministry of Healing The Sick without medical uh without without medical uh whatever and and casting out Devils it was a Ministry of power it was a Ministry of binding up the wounds and of people and healing the Brokenhearted it was a Ministry that took authority over the devil and and and and there wasn't a devil around that could stay in the presence of God when Jesus commanded him to leave ain't that right and and and we're we're we're in a in a in a place that that I I believe we're we're at a place that all these man-made programs are are totally come uh as limited they're finding their limitations because we're we're really facing spiritual warfare uh more than ever in in humanity and and I I thought of just even the the man of gy of of being possessed of them all th you know 2,000 I think or whatever devils and and no doctor could have helped him no psychologist could have helped him there there was nothing that could reform him but there was one that had a Ministry that could deliver that man and and and only one that could have done that and and so that was the type of Ministry that Jesus had see and so uh uh but but there was no devil that could stay around that's that's how the the blind Could See Without operations being being performed that's that's how the deaf could hear the lame could walk without having uh therapy and and these things the dead were raised to life the people's sins were forgiven them they uh the people received eternal life and and so Jesus had a Ministry like no other it it was a Ministry that was so profound and yet it was a Supernatural Ministry very and and a humble Ministry ain't that right and and so even the natural Church uh did not have such a ministry as as his uh for it wasn't a man-made Ministry and and operating within the realm of human element amen and and even Nicodemus who was a Pharisee uh said to Jesus in John 3:2 says no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him another place they they marveled at at his words that he spoke because he spake as a man having Authority amen there was just something about him that that was different and and and so uh uh you know before Jesus started his public Ministry we know that he went and and to to the prophet John and and he was baptized and and when he come up out of the water John saw the spirit of God uh descending uh from heaven like unto a dove and it it It Came Upon Jesus and and of course that the prophet said that's when God and man became one heaven and Earth United together amen was was at that time and and uh they they embraced together and and the prophet said God came down from the spirit form and was made a man and dwelt among us see God became man ain't that right amen Jesus would have never had the ministry that he had except God United with him can you say Amen for Jesus was the human Tabernacle of God do you believe that amen see and so um uh uh the the the whole church and this is the the thing that I see is that as all the programs that we have uh out in the world and and even the church the the one thing they've rejected is the spirit of God they've rejected the very thing that would give them power Amen to really be effective to that that that humanity and and so so but but when when uh Jesus had the nature of a lamb and so the dove could could could land uh and Unite with such a spirit as that and so uh if there's ever a time we need his Spirit we need it now uh uh because just to be honest we're required to have that type of a Ministry that Jesus had in this day do you believe that amen see and so um but then if you notice what happened after that was in Matthew 17 And1 it says and after Jesus uh after six days uh Jesus taketh Peter uh James and John uh his brother and bringeth them uh up into an high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his reignment was white as the light and behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him and then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if thou Wilt let us make here three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses one for Elias and while he SP yet spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadow them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased uh uh or pleased to dwell in hear ye him ain't that right so now God is is is is approving and showing there's only one voice amen that they are to listen to and that is Christ ain't that right amen and when they the disciples heard it they fell on their face and were so afraid and Jesus came and touched them and said rise Be not Afraid and when they lifted up their eyes they saw no man they saw no organization they saw nothing else just Jesus only ain't that right and and what is significant about this is that this was the time that Jesus was adopted this was the father adopting his son amen that's what a prophet says ain't that right I know some people don't believe that but it's true if a prophet said it I believe it amen you see and so now notice what the prophet said Jesus walked as an ordinary man uh but one day upon Mount Transfiguration he had taken three as a witness Peter James John hope faith and charity called them out and he separated Jesus from them and overshadowed the him he overshadowed him and the Bible says his reignment Shine Like the Sun in its strength what was it that special robe God adopting his own son ain't that right and and we know if if you've not really uh or been a while since you've listened to it you ought to go back and listen to the adoption series or even even the messages several messages maybe 12 of them on hear ye him and uh uh the these things and and and the prophet talks about the adoption of how that in the Bible the you know the the the uh the when a son was adopted of the father he then came into full possession of everything and so this is exactly what happened Jesus was adopted and the prophet said no wonder Jesus could say all power in heaven and in Earth is now given unto me ain't that right now you could just imagine the devil's trembling at that moment and and the things uh because because there was a son that had come to an adoption amen and what is it when the son is adopted his name everybody say his name is as good on the check as the father's name ain't that right see and so uh because the prophet said he's no longer under a tutor but he's now like his father he's got the authority of his father his word goes just as the father's word goes amen what he says everybody has to come under subjection to that because he's been lifted up into a position of authority he's no longer under tutors and governors he's no longer like a servant now he tells the servant what to do he's the one that commands his word now has power ain't that right amen see well that that's the thing see and and and so um uh brother BR said said no wonder Jesus could say all powers in Heaven and Earth is given into my hand for he was adopted by his father into the Glorious Kingdom and is now sitting in the Majesty at the right hand above every Archangel and Angel every Star moon or every name that's named in heaven it's subject to the name of Jesus Christ for he was adopted by God the Father ain't that right well what was it Jesus was one with the father do you believe that Jesus was one with the Father the Bible even says it that that he done only what the father showed him that's what Jesus said I can do nothing but what the father first showed me he was one with the father he said my meat is to do the father's will he was so in line with the the father he was so in harmony with the father everything was about the father's business what the father did what the father wanted amen what the father asked so he was one with the word for the word is God and the word became flesh ain't that right God was able to find a a a a a a body that would accept him amen and and and the fullness of him ain't that right amen see so he had the same motive as the father the same heartbeat the same love amen the same expression that the father's desire was his desire desire the the father's care was his care amen see and so uh even Jesus would tell the uh people it's not me that doeth the works but it's the father within me that's doing the works he was so yielded to the father that the father could express himself through the son can you say Amen see and so uh uh now we know amen that the the ministry that Jesus had is the same Ministry that his bride has today amen see uh uh we appreciate all kinds of the Ministries we appreciate what people are trying to do to help humanity and and the kindheartedness and and all of these things that there but but even then as I said last Sunday people are losing their their their their their love for people they're losing their passion they're losing and it's a self-centered thing building their own reputations of what they've done and what they do worried about a career it's more about money than it is about helping the people amen you can get doctors and nurses and they can be just as rude and and and and uh inconsiderate and and all of these things uh lawyers are supposed to be working for the people and they become more uh selfish and in indulgent about money it's about career it's about Fame it's about Fortune it's about luxury and and all of these things ain't that right see but but but there is a Ministry and the prophet said that there there come a time in that that there will be only love that'll be found in the elect and that's it love in the elect see and and so uh uh so so this ministry amen now a man can only be a part of the body of Christ amen uh by having the Holy Ghost ain't that right amen and and and uh uh uh if you haven't had the Holy Ghost you need the Holy Ghost amen that that's just the given you you you you can never operate in the ministry as as you yeah you you can feed the poor you can do the human element like everybody else does and and you can do that and you can attend church you can be a good citizen you can you can be all these things and but but yet brother brandom says but that's a moral thing that's that's moral principle that's just moral things amen but but to to really come into the ministry of the son of man uh uh well you you've got to be born again but also we're looking and we're seeing by the message of the hour that we are in the season of adoption amen and he says God has just began to my humble opinion to adopting his son positionally calling him out to one side giving him a certain min anointing them for that purpose and sending them out and watch what happens when he does that ain't that right so so this is where we're at that God is adopting his sons you say well how how do I do that how how does this happen by being compliant to the father's will by doing what he wants done and not what we want done by by just simply believing the word word my meat is to do the will of him that sent me can you say amen and there's people that are being so compliant to the father's will amen that they they want it if if if they they want to know his will what about my job what about this what if you said it in your word that's what I want to be if you said it in the message that's the way I want to be I want to be so compliant I don't want my ideas about it I don't want what I think about it I don't want to conform the way the world's amen the world's got so many ideas is a man uh that is so different from the the message of the hour and from this Bible simply because the world changes man changes man's ideas changes I I you know talking to my wife you know how interesting of how that our language has even changed from even when my grandfather uh uh was was was a kid you know and bil language and or uh by words and and the different things uh it it's just funny of of of how that we change just even in our language but we change in our thoughts and we change in our ways we change in our habit the homes have changed the churches have changed and man's beliefs have changed the dress has changed and and and and all of these things have changed and and and yet there is a word that Still Remains the Same can you say amen and so when you when you're coming and and and it to those that are adop Ed amen it's those that are not trying to change the word to fit their way of life it's actually them not changing with the world and their ideas and their opinions and their attitudes and their way of of of thinking but they're staying right with the word my me is to do the will of the Father the father never changes his will can you say Amen people are turning more to doctors and psychiatrists and psychologist and and the problem said the church is turning the people over over why they changed in their ideas they changed in their way they're changed and they think God is changed but God doesn't change his ministry will never change and so there are people that is being diligent to the father's will they're being diligent amen and and so brother brandom uh called this adoption he says it's being adopted into the powers of God being adopted into the powers of God Amen now think of that amen that that you know we give other people Credit in what they do and and maybe they're doctors of you know uh got their certain degrees and all of that but think of it that you have such a Ministry given to you that you can just simply lay hands on the sick and they will recover that you can by Your Word just cast out Devils amen and and that's what we're supposed to do is it not amen not put up with things but literally cast Devils out amen that's the ministry now that we are to have you believe that amen see so so then this means if we're adopted into the powers of God then then this is the same thing that happened to Jesus on Mount Transfiguration and we're at that mount Transfiguration again I believe that anyways and which means that all power in heaven and earth Earth has been given to the church amen to carry on to carry on the ministry of Jesus Christ not to start a program not to start some Society not to start an organization not not something for our benefit but to carry on the ministry of Jesus Christ so we have been given this commission to minister yeah you believe that praise the Lord I I think it's amazing that God would this this this ministry comes to uh to its fullness in this age in a time of selfishness in in a time that that people are lovers of pleasure and lovers of themselves more than lovers of God people think more highly of themselves than they do the things of God they they think more highly of themselves than they do the church and or the word of God I should say and and and these things and and so uh uh but we have been given a commission to minister so you could just imagine the things that we fight in this day uh uh to bring ourselves under control uh our feelings our emotions and everything under control just to be a minister the way God wants us to minister in other words we have a direct order we we have a command from Jesus Christ himself I had uh uh mentioned this last Sunday but to minister means to wait upon others to serve the need of other others not to serve our own needs but to serve the need of others to wait upon others to supply what is needed to care for now so God put you in the ministry because he's given you something he's given you something that the world lacks amen and it's more than food that they're lacking it's more than just uh uh pat on the back that they're lacking but but God has given this to the church can you say Amen so as God worked in the flesh of his own son Jesus Christ he is now working in the flesh of adopted children through Jesus Christ as he promised that's what the prophet said see so our Ministries are different our ministry is different than that of doctors and Jesus didn't call upon us to pass out medication and and all of these things and uh he didn't call us to learn different methods and ways of the world so to help people he didn't as the prophet said he didn't commission his church to build hospitals and and and such uh uh he he didn't commission us to learn psychology and and and to use it on those who are in need uh ma Mark 16 and 15 Jesus said unto us and this is the commission go ye into all the world and preach everybody say preach the gospel to every creature and he that believe believeth is and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned see and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongu they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover now think of the power upon that amen the commission that we have amen from from God himself amen and and so you you you and and please don't get me wrong now uh we believe in doctors and we we send our children to what you know to to doctors and things and so and the dentist and whatever but but in this type of ministry you're not required to use medicine you don't have to use medicine you don't have to use a surgeons tools you don't you don't have to have doctor's degree or a bachelor uh degree uh you don't have to know the psychology you don't have have to know how to place your nouns and pronouns you you don't have to you don't have to look so great you don't you don't have to amen build this this this natural body into such a way you know that that uh um you you become more effective you don't have to drive a nice car you don't have to have fancy houses you don't you don't even have to have money in the bank for this commission to work amen just preach the gospel can you say Amen just preach the gospel that that's that's all that is required is preach the gospel and those that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover ain't that right see just preach the gospel well what is the gospel well here's what uh Paul says in 1 Thessalonians 1:3 Our Gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much Assurance as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake ain't that right so that's the ministry that God has given the church and here another place first Corinthians 2 and4 my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power notice why that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God do you believe that amen amen see I don't I don't believe that you have to know the whole message and before you become effective I don't believe that you have to understand the whole Bible before you become effective but preach the gospel preach the gospel that's what so many people fail to realize is that the power lays in the gospel it lays in the gospel now you know the the Bible says that the letter kth but the spirit giveth life amen now John 10:10 the thief Jesus said the thief cometh not but for to steal to kill and destroy now how many times has he taken the letter of the word and he's destroyed people's lives with the letter of the word amen and and people uh look at the people that are W today and the in shambles whether it be their marriage whether it be family whether it be be just all kinds of things is because the thief amen and and he don't have to tell you know well that's what he done in in in Genesis he quoted what God said he preached the gospel amen but he he done it in the wrong way and look what how it's affected the world and Mankind and and all these things ain't that right amen so he comes uh uh uh as a thief and to kill steal and destroy but Jesus says I am come you may have life if there's ever a time that God gives a Ministry to a people is to give life to people give life to that seed now we know it's a predestinated seed that gives life that makes life a man see that can be Quicken but it's the spirit that gives life so we are to go into all the world demonstrate the power of the word by the Holy Ghost now we all know that there is no life outside this message amen there is no life that's you you cannot preach a Lutheran message and and get life you can't preach Wesley's message or Pentecostals message of the Pentecostal age there's there's just no life there and and I I believe in the gifts and and they should be operating brother Brown said they should be operating in every local church uh uh there and and and the gifts work through the body but I don't believe in operating them the way the Pentecostals did in the Pentecostal age I just don't believe that and we're seeing so much of that right now in the message and it's not helping the people at all it's more than anything it's raising questions it's causing confusion it's it's just a mass of of all these things and so so if if you're going to have a Ministry do something do it do it according to the word of the hour do it do it according to the message of the hour I I'm I'm I'm certain that in the Pentecostal age age there was more people speaking than God was speaking and and yet they were saying it was God speaking and it's you know and and I just I just believe that you know seen it and and and and and this guy ain't going back to that Pentecost away we just ain't going back there I don't care if they are trying to bring it back in the message and introduce it that way and people may be gullible to go for that and that's fine but I know what a prophet says that how gifts ought to work and how Visions Vision dreams are not to be interpreted unless a prophet is there to interpret it that's what the Bible that's what a prophet says can you say amen that's why he didn't give a a vision or uh you know uh uh that's why he he gave a dream to Joseph uh uh about Mary concerning Mary is is because uh uh there was no prophet in the land to interpret that dream so so God gave Joseph A Dream without symbols that dream did not need to be interpreted it was not symbols it was not some horse out here and some this and need now we're needing this to be interpreted and Joseph waking up wondering what this dream meant well God wouldn't have done that a can you say amen amen see because there was no profit in the in the land Amen to interpret that dream see and so so God gave him a dream and it was based upon the word that when Joseph woke up he knew exactly what that dream was saying because he could find it right in the word of God can you say Amen that dream led him to the word so any dream that needs to be uh interpreted there's no prophet in the land to interpret that dream I just just now that's my that's the way I see the prophet taught it can you say Amen but see there is a Ministry without all of this man-made stuff amen trying to work something up there is a Ministry and that Ministry is effective today in a people that would just stay with the word and stay with what a prophet taught amen amen that's right but I think the reason why it is because we want to draw things to ourselves now notice what brother brandom says I've always tried to when I come down here to talk about something not just be talking or not something that would please the people I tried to speak some about something that would please God and help the people you see for help now that that we could all no matter what church you belong to that you could draw closer or for a closer walk with God so this was the whole point of brother bram's Ministry was that we would be drawn closer to God am that we would be delivered from the the the the ways of Satan that we'd be delivered from unbelief and delivered from the traditions of men and delivered from church there's people that are so bound and and I have to say that there's people so Bound in churches today and even in the message church that need to be free need to be free from uh man-made ideas and traditions and uh false doctrines and and and all of these things see so so but I I really like what brother Brandon said my my goal is to please God everybody say to please God God not to please the people but to please God and help the people ain't that right amen see so the the help that we have to help people it it's got to be pleasing to God let it be pleasing to God that's the only way that we want to help people is that what ever we do to help people let it be pleasing to God on Amen and the only way for this to happen to get people closer to God is is to preach the gospel which is the word for our day demonstrated demonstrated and and the the prophet says that you know you're the only Bible that many people will ever read you're you're you're the Jesus Christ if anybody's going to see Christ it's got to be in you it's a life it's the word displayed it's it's the word put on display and if you notice that's the token the token must be on display the life of Jesus Christ displayed through our lives watch forward to minister to others to help others to can you say amen amen that that that's right can't can't help people I we just say it this way you can't help people uh uh teaching trinitarian Doctrine you you can't help people in and you've got to stay in the rim of the message in in the in in the lines of the message of the hour to help people can you say Amen true on Amen so here we are we're to demonstrate the power of God over physical sickness mental sickness and sickness in the soul now if you notice the son of man came not to be ministered to but to minister well who is the son of man it's the word made flesh prise the Lord the word made flesh and we all know that this is where we're at today is the word has becoming flesh again again the personal life of Jesus Christ in the church do you believe that and the word being God and so Jesus was anointed for the ministry uh uh Luke 4:18 the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor Heath sent me uh to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord he was full of compassion Matthew 9:36 when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no sheer on and on and on he he the the Bible talks of Jesus having compassion when he prayed for the Blind Men he had compassion when he when he when he uh uh uh you know um when when he uh uh performed the miracle the two fishes Five Loaves or uh there he had compassion upon the multitude there there was a compassion that was in him and and and in other words Ministry is not effective without compassion Ministry is not effective without compassion brother Brown said you have to enter in to feel for the people if you're going to pray for them see uh uh so so brother Brandon talked about like like that blind man that came up for prayer and I think it was a Mexican man just a poor poor fella and and brother brandham he looked at him and he had no shoes on his feet and he thought you know if and he looked at his shoes and he thought you know and he put his feet by his this this Blind Man's feet and he thought if I if they would just fit I'd give them to him and he thought oh the suit that that someone had just bought me and and things that so nice and things he said if I he said if I could if it would fit him I I would give that to him see there was a compassion there and he got to thinking about his own daddy and how he would be about that age and and things like that and there was a compassion that began to to to to uh come up uh in him see and and and all he could do was just hug him and and he just be to hug the man and and cry over this man and before you know what the man begin to say I can see I I can see and and see brother Brown said see you've got to feel for the people or you won't do no good uh to pray for them see and here I'm thinking well what if my daddy would have Liv he had been about this age see and and here's another one brother Brown tells a woman in the prayer line says we're strangers to one another you believe the holy spirit is here he said what I have to do sister I have to feel for you see you know it has to be something that I sympathize with you he said there's too much of this cold eyed Christ uh Christianity Today just dried and cut you've got to feel for the people see and you've got to feel for the people that you witnessed to you you got to you got to go into their shoes ain't that right to to understand that if they're going to be lost if God doesn't do something and and and so you you you you're not there just to give them a hamburger you're not there just to to to to give them some money you you don't know what they're going to do with that money you understand what I'm saying you're there in compassion there's a compassion there that God I want to see this man I want to see this woman I want to see this boy or girl make it in in the in the Rapture I I want to do all I can Amen to do everything to make sure that they make it see you you you feel for the people you witness to you you feel for the people that you preach to you know we we don't want to just preach sermons we we we don't want to do that we we want to feel for them we want to feel for people can you say amen amen feel for people feel for people you sing to not just up here singing a song but feel for them god let's do something do something through my song that will edify that will deliver that will help somebody that'll encourage them to keep walking encourage them amen lighten their load got to feel for them can you say amen amen well this is the type of Ministry Jesus had for for First Peter 5: 7 says casting all your care upon him for he carth for you amen he carth for you I think if we have compassion if there's if there's a real feeling for people it'll cause us to be burden for people it'll be called you you you feel for people that you work for you feel for the people that you work with you feel for the people that works for you you you're you're feeling for the people you're burdened down with their because that you know that you've got something to help them with can you say amen I guarantee it it will cutle out all the selfishness that we have it it'll make us walk right it'll make us talk right it'll make us make sure that we don't say anything that would turn somebody off of our life can you say amen I know you ain't going to reach everybody that's not the point amen but but you know what there's there times that we'll witness to people and they turn away but does it make a stop no because there's a feeling there for people there's a compassion there I don't care what it is like brother BR says he said I don't care if I prayed for a thousand and you know sick people and they all died tonight he said I'd be back preaching praying for them again other people why because you know you've got the method you know you've got something that the people need you know that and so we're doing all of our best to get people to Believe in Us get people to believe our word get people to trust our word get people to to know that when they see us they see now that man is a Christian that woman's got the goods you you understand what I'm saying not trying to hide your your talent not trying to hide your life you're not supposed to hide your light you're not supposed to be so so ashamed of what you believe right that's right A lot of people don't don't tell about the Lord and the message because they don't live the life of it it's just facts that's right but here casting all your care on him for he carth for you think of that he carth for you yes he does God took on the form of a servant because he cared Jesus humbled himself even to the death of the Cross because he had the same care that the father had amen the same care brother Bram said he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he live for others and and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and and and that dead Calvary see and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others can you say Amen now notice another place a great man will not will always not be a stuffed shirt but he will try to make you think that you're the great man because and he's nothing that's that's brother BR said that now that's the great man not not the one that's got the Palaces and you know the the the everybody looking at me and singing songs about me and and and when I'm walking in the room everybody applauding woohoo and trying to touch me that's not the great man that's right brother there's many men that that can walk in a room in their presence just demand attention you know they they just got that ER about them they got that way about them but great men Great Men is ones that that that would try to make that makes you think you're great and he's nothing see and the man that is isn't nothing and trying to be great see it's just the other way and that's the reason I know I know that Jesus Jesus was the son of God he came to the Earth without even having a place to be born he had to borrow a womb he had to borrow a Manger he come through a borrowed womb and went to through a borrowed grave the foxes and dens and birds of the air has Nest but the son of man has no uh uh uh has no place to lay his head see nowhere to lay his head yet the king of glory the god of Heaven made flesh and dwelt Among Us that's what made him big that's what made him big was because his humility by his humility makes him big and humility the way down is all all all the ways is the way up see he that will humble himself God will exalt he that exalteth himself shall be aeed the way down is uh is the way up for the believer see humble himself before God ain't that right he said Jesus meant with with men of all walks of life he met in great circles one time he was with thousands 500 at once you know 12 at once three at once and even will come to one that's what makes him great not because not even one person can ever call on him but what he will be right there at their side that's what makes him God is because of his humility ain't that right now you think of that we are his body we we are just like Jesus Christ was the Tabernacle of God in that day now we're just common born sex sex born Sinners that have been redeemed though the blood has been so powerful that it has wiped your slate clean that you can stand just as Jesus Christ stood and God could have preeminence over your body as he did that body can you say amen and express his ministry like he did in that body and his humility his character to we his power and it's nothing about you it's not your glory it's nothing it's God that carth for the people living in you caring for the people in you God caring for the people in you God believing his own word in you amen why because he's made a way for this to happen at Calvary he made a way right prise the Lord see he served others and not himself he didn't care for others as as a doctor would therefore he didn't live as a doctor would he didn't care for others as the dentist does therefore he didn't live as a dentist would he didn't care for others as a lawyer would he didn't care care for others as maybe a psychologist would he didn't care for others as a priest or bishop or Theologian would therefore he didn't live as they live that's true can you say amen amen he cared in a way that no one else could care did Brother BR said he cared for the leopard when nothing else could care he cared for the blind beggar that had just ragged clothes on n was on his way up to Calvary and all everybody tell him trying to tell that that beggar hush hush up don't don't interrupt him he's too busy he's too important but he so cared for that blind beggar that he stopped Amen to care for the need he so cared for that prostitute woman that was so Bound in sin and condemnation right and the filth of her past and the way of living but he wasn't too important to go by her way brother brah said he cared for her so much that he told her the secrets of her heart and forgave every sin and put something in her that she run into the city saying come see a man that's told me the things that I've done yes sir he says no matter how little or insignificant he cared he cared for the immoral he cared for the drunks the alcoholics whatever it was he cared that's right and you amen amen amen his care went deeper than just just the organizations his care went deeper than any charity function his care went so far deeper amen that he knew that he could deliver them and set them free yes sir he cared for that woman that had them Seven Devils in her Mary Magdalene it was and he cast them out amen and she never was the same again that's true amen that's the kind of care that Jesus had he had it to give you have it to give you have it to give we got to get out of our selfishness it's not all about us at all and we making it about us this preacher makes it about us himself a lot of times one day Jesus passed by a funeral possession procession I should say brother Brown described how just he just got through walking 30 miles that day he was so tired exhausted weary hungry but he cared he looked at that little woman that was grieving heartbroken mother and he thought I could help her and he cared didn't charge her a dime he just stopped the procession went to that coffin and raised her little boy up because the cared praise God hallelujah you say Amen Lord he cared so much that he prayed he spent much time in prayer to stay in fellowship with the God that was in him he cared think about that ain't that right right see he knew his ministry he so cared for the people that he said unto them there in John 14 And1 let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you he he so cared that he wanted the people to know what was taking place he wanted them to know that they've got a bre future ahead and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself he took the time to let us know this he cares can you say amen and I think it's time that we let people know that he's coming for us he's coming for them he loves them can you sayen let him know God sent a prophet let him know why he sent a prophet the word had to be restored back again to get you out of your mess to get you out of your confusion quit looking at all the Hypocrites quit looking at all the filth of the world and the churches they powerless they sit dormant can you say Amen but God still is moving God is here can you sayen if I go and prepare a place I will come for you I will come and receive you unto myself that where I am you may be there also oh do you love him he says see he says no matter how little you are how insignificant you are how poor how indifferent how many times you've tried and failed he still cares he cares for you yes sir you love him amen the Lord now as I get ready to close there is so a a false conception about Ministry today people have made it about glamour excitement kind of like a choice of what I want to do when I want to do it where I want to do it there's a song back in Oklahoma they sung on the radio Lord I'd be happy to to be used by you be happy go you know go just send me as long as in the Bahamas and I'll be happy to love my neighbor as long as he's a Dallas Cowboy fan and I'll be glad to do this and I'll be glad to do that but he putting stipulations on it you know what I'm saying and that's not what Ministry is about we made Ministry about Glamour and excitement popularity and gain but if you really think of it Ministry for Jesus was difficult the prophet said he was misunderstood he was misunderstood from the GetGo his birth was misunderstood his ministry was misunderstood his message was misunderstood his actions were misunderstood amen I thought you know uh brother Bram talking about uh Mr Mercer you know told Brother Bram said God is going to change your ministry and when he does that said you'll probably be just you'll probably line up the hospitals and speak them all speak them out of the beds and things you know that's that's what he was thinking of this ministry that brother brandham had oh just emptying out the hospitals and and all these things and but brother Brown said it just didn't sound right see he said our lord Jesus never done it now if he was talking to a selfish individual that had that type of man Ministry he'd be like yeah let's go try it but something about it just didn't ring right and and he said our lord Jesus never did that he went into the hospitals he said there was one there was one in that hospital he went in the hospital but there was only one he went for is you remember where it was at in in the Bible the pool of Bethesda see great multitudes of impotent people laid there crippled lame blind withered waiting for the angel he said that was in a spiritual hospital where people waited on Divine Healing and here the Divine healer himself came in and healed one and walked out so you couldn't expect a mortal or a Ministry to come forth that would be any greater than what he was see so he says I just couldn't agree with it see so Jesus's Ministry was based on the leadership of the father amen you know brother bradam said the anointing is is supreme control uh uh how was that the uh Power supreme power under control the anointing is supreme power under control in control can you say Amen see not not just someone not just anointing and then just running around doing everything that you think ought to be done no it was under under a supreme uh under control see he says and everyone that tries to live before God is misunderstood that's right people misunderstand you see they think there's something wrong with with you see sometimes they're considered neurotics when they really try to live true live loyal and true to God ain't that right so he was misunderstood but the Bible talks about his life he was rejected he was despised he cared for people and yet he was despised and rejected he was also a man of sorrow and was acquainted with grief I think it was his compassion that subjected him to such things yes said he cried often he loved people amen can you say Amen yes he did am that as we close one thing that he never did and you remember he was tempted in all points like us yes he was he never let the root of bitterness that's true take root in his soul he never let his Spirit become damaged you think of the sufferings you think of the critics you think of people the abuse that people gave him right and yet he he kept himself in such a way that he could maintain a Ministry keep his influence amen true amen he never let his heart become callous and hard he never let complexes build up to where he couldn't help the people can you say amen amen it's amazing how that God would take us and he would ordain us to carry on his ministry amen common people people that is subject to hurts that's right subject to disappointments oh yeah subject to I don't want to say spirits but Warfare sure subject to that if we're not careful that we can build complexes so high that when people come and needing help and yet the only way they can respond or way they can do it is tear you down and yet they need help and if we're not careful if we've got complexes built up we'll actually walk away we'll actually strike out you understand whatever you go through don't let that don't let hardness come into your heart amen I I don't care what it is amen I I find that people you know that have a bad upbringing or something in their lives and you know and and they carry that over yes they they carry it over and and they wear this this thing on their their their shoulder this Grudge and not maybe not even realize what they're doing sometimes we don't realize it till someone has to point it out or whatever but we'll carry this Grudge and I if if if if a man has abused us we'll carry that Grudge and we'll treat every other man just the same way if if we were abused at home by our mom or or or or by something and and we just didn't and we carry that thing then we'll treat everyone just equal you understand what I'm saying and and and and and you can't help people I know there's times that we need the healing and this is why the Fountain of Calvary praise the Lord this is this is why we come to church is not to keep our defenses up amen but to let it drop and say God do whatever you want with me true let me heal cuz why we we because I'm telling you complexes makes us selfish scars makes us selfish because we're always on a defense we ain't going to let no one hurt us this time but you know what how many times Jesus was hurt you know it wasn't all his hurt didn't start at Calvary his whole life was scarred trying to help people and they call him illegitimate how can you help people when they're calling you illegitimate F you just want to get in the in a corner somewhere and just shun it all brother Bram even talk talked about how I've preached and preached and preached and just worse I just you know and he just determined he was going to go take his wife get up in the mountains and just forget it right why because it the rejection hurt the things that he went through hurt but God wouldn't let him do that true don't live your life selfishly don't you live your life just all hurt hurt hurt hurt he hurt me she hurt me I'm hurt and then when someone really needs help it doesn't matter how they strike at you it doesn't matter what they say about you get to the place that you can help that individual amen is that what what we want to be I think that's what we all should be is be able to help people right don't leave the message to try to help people get into prayer get into a place that you can be a dedicated channel for God quit letting the devil use us quit letting the devil build complexes in us cuz Satan will take them hurts and he'll use it against you he uses our memory he uses everything against us we start having flashbacks and this and that and it and and you know what what Satan does he misinterprets it so many times true don't let the devil do it amen we're called to minister can you say amen amen we've got the most powerful message on the face of the Earth to heal us to help us if we can believe it that's right but also that it'll Empower us to help others amen can you say amen amen you love the Lord if the musicians Will Come Bless the Lord help
