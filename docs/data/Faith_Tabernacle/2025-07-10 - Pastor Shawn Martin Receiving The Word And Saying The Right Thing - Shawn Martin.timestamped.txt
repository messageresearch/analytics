[40:54] Well, do you love the Lord? Trust you
[40:57] had a good day today. And um it's good
[41:01] to have brother Kevin and his family
[41:05] back with us. And uh brother Amos,
[41:08] sister Lisa. Amen. And uh just everyone
[41:13] in the house of the Lord and um Amen. Uh
[41:17] appreciate the musicians and uh they can
[41:22] uh be dismissed there. Uh but I do want
[41:26] to just remind you that brother Andy
[41:28] Schuler
[41:30] uh and his family, the Lord willing,
[41:32] will be with us this Sunday. And so, uh,
[41:35] looking forward to what God has, uh, in
[41:40] store for us. Amen. And so, we want to,
[41:44] uh, remember that. Amen. And as, um,
[41:48] Daniel had mentioned, want to remember
[41:50] brother Zachary as he's over out in the
[41:53] jungles. And brother Zachary is a true
[41:57] missionary.
[41:58] and uh um he's going out into spots that
[42:02] people hadn't heard the message before
[42:05] and and um way out there, you know, and
[42:09] so they uh uh he goes out there, they
[42:12] kill that goat, and I know brother Sandy
[42:13] would know what we're talking about. Uh
[42:16] but uh uh they kill that goat, you know,
[42:18] and he said tastes pretty good the first
[42:20] day and second day it tastes, you know,
[42:23] pretty good. third day. He said it's
[42:25] pretty rough, you know, and but they
[42:27] don't have freezers or refrigerators and
[42:30] all of that. So, he sent a picture last
[42:32] night. He's on top of a truck and uh
[42:35] only gotten just a few hours sleep, but
[42:38] he was on sitting on a tire on the on
[42:41] the top
[42:43] the cab and that was going to be his
[42:46] seat for three hours driving riding in
[42:48] the jungles and um so I certainly uh
[42:52] appreciate his heart uh to bring the
[42:56] word to uh the people and uh we
[42:59] certainly want to keep him in our
[43:01] prayer.
[43:02] Amen. Uh if you have your Bibles, we're
[43:05] going to turn to the book of Mark, uh
[43:08] the 7th chapter.
[43:17] Praise the Lord.
[43:20] And I know um you we may not all be
[43:23] called to to to do, you know, go
[43:26] overseas and endure those type of
[43:29] things. And tell you what, my hats off
[43:32] to brother Sandy all these years as he
[43:34] has uh done such a thing as that and had
[43:38] a lot of stories to tell. And you know,
[43:41] it's um I know when you hearing them
[43:44] stories, you think, "Oh, wow. That's you
[43:46] know, kind of neat." But uh but to
[43:50] experience that yourself, I wouldn't
[43:52] want to experience that. And uh but it
[43:55] just takes a a real person uh God-called
[44:00] individual to be able to endure those
[44:04] things. I think it was brother Sandy,
[44:06] you know, saying one time, you know,
[44:08] they were in a hut and uh they, you
[44:12] know, I think he had a flashlight or
[44:14] something. Turn on the flashlight and
[44:15] there spiders just all over the ceiling,
[44:19] you know, and it just Huh. Oh, scorpions
[44:22] even worse. and uh but God spared them.
[44:26] So uh you know when they come back to us
[44:29] uh we just thank the Lord that God
[44:32] protected them through all of that and
[44:35] uh uh the Lord is certainly good. Amen.
[44:39] Uh so um we want to look at Mark 7 and
[44:46] um
[44:47] 25
[44:49] says for a certain woman whose young
[44:52] daughter had an unclean spirit heard of
[44:55] him and came and fell at his feet. The
[44:59] woman was a Greek uh siren Phoenician
[45:04] uh by uh nation and she besought him
[45:09] that he would cast forth the devil out
[45:11] of her daughter.
[45:13] But Jesus said unto her, "The children
[45:16] first be filled, for or let the children
[45:20] first be filled, for it is not meat to
[45:22] take the uh children's bread and cast it
[45:26] unto dogs."
[45:28] And she answered and said, "Yes, Lord."
[45:32] Now, that's her reply. "Yes, Lord. Yet
[45:36] the dogs under the table eat of the
[45:40] children's crumbs."
[45:42] And he said unto her, "For this thing,
[45:45] go thy way. The devil is gone out of
[45:49] your daughter." Amen. Let's just bow our
[45:52] heads in a word of prayer. Father,
[45:56] we come to you, Lord, as your children
[46:00] with the promise that you would be here
[46:02] with us, Lord. And
[46:05] it is a special time to us as it is a
[46:10] special time to you when we come to meet
[46:13] and Lord meet with you. We're just
[46:17] praying, Father, that the songs that was
[46:21] sung, the worship
[46:24] that was displayed, that it would be
[46:27] pleasing to your sight, Father, to where
[46:31] you would feel at home and that you
[46:33] would speak to us, Lord. And we're just
[46:37] asking you to minister to every heart,
[46:42] Lord. I I know we've been in the message
[46:44] for, you know, a while, Lord, and but
[46:47] maybe it never become common to us. May
[46:51] coming together not be common, Lord. But
[46:55] may we always treat it as a special time
[46:59] with you, Father. And Lord, we just give
[47:02] you all praise and glory in Jesus
[47:05] Christ's name. Amen. You can be seated
[47:10] this evening.
[47:12] So my title uh would be receiving the
[47:16] word and saying the right thing.
[47:21] And uh
[47:23] you know I uh just trying to maybe study
[47:28] today and just really couldn't uh get u
[47:33] settled in on a thought. And so, uh, I
[47:38] was listening or reading, um, uh, uh,
[47:42] message and and, uh, this thought had
[47:45] just come to me and I pray that it'll be
[47:48] a help to you. But you know, the Bible
[47:51] says that the the death and life are
[47:55] held in the power of the tongue. It's
[47:58] it's that so the tongue has power.
[48:02] It can it can bring life or it can bring
[48:05] death.
[48:06] I think that's interesting of how that
[48:10] we as humans have that power within us.
[48:16] Not looking for something outside but
[48:19] it's it's within us. And so uh we we
[48:24] find that of course in the beginning you
[48:28] know we could always start at the
[48:29] foundation and and that was that God
[48:33] created the heavens and earth by his
[48:36] word. He spoke it. It it it was it was
[48:40] something that because his word had
[48:43] power and he would speak it and then it
[48:46] created. And so when God created man in
[48:51] his image, it was his desire to have
[48:53] fellowship. Now, you can't have
[48:56] fellowship. It's hard to have fellowship
[48:58] with someone that's out of your league,
[49:01] if you know what I mean. You know, if if
[49:04] if a man is just constantly talking
[49:07] about computers and the technology and
[49:11] the the ins and outs about computers and
[49:14] you have no clue what computers are like
[49:17] and all that, it's kind of hard to keep
[49:18] up and to have fellowship in that area.
[49:23] And so, um, we we find that God wanted
[49:27] fellowship with man. So he would he he
[49:30] made man in his own image
[49:33] and then gives him dominion over the
[49:38] earth. And so as God just simply spoke
[49:41] things into existence,
[49:44] man now becomes an amateur God and he
[49:48] would do it. He would rule over the
[49:51] earth, over the universe and he would do
[49:54] it by his words. And so, uh, um, Brother
[49:59] Bram said, you know, he was God over the
[50:00] earth. He could speak and it would be
[50:02] so. He could speak this and it would be
[50:05] so. Everything he would speak, he could
[50:07] speak to the winds and it would be so.
[50:10] He could speak to the trees, be changed,
[50:12] be plucked up and set over here to the
[50:15] winds and waves, be still, and it would
[50:17] stop. Because God uh uh, man had
[50:21] dominion by his word. it it wouldn't
[50:25] happen just by thinking on it. It
[50:27] wouldn't happen just by wishing it and
[50:30] looking at it and but but when he spoke
[50:33] the word then the the power or the
[50:36] dominion the authority that he had was
[50:39] was exercised and and displayed. And so
[50:44] when Jesus even came to the fig tree as
[50:48] we know uh he cursed it. There was
[50:50] nothing on that no fruit. And so he
[50:52] cursed it and said, "No, no man eat from
[50:55] thee from this day forward." You know,
[50:57] and so then the Bible tells us that his
[51:00] disciples heard this and they went, you
[51:02] know, Jesus and his disciples went on
[51:05] and went on into the city and the next
[51:07] day they come back and and and Peter
[51:10] noticed that the the tree had had
[51:13] withered. And so Mark 11:21
[51:17] said Peter calling to remembrance sth
[51:19] unto him, "Master, behold, the fig tree
[51:22] which thou cursed is withered." And
[51:25] Jesus answering sith unto them, "Have
[51:27] faith in God. For verily I say unto you,
[51:30] that whosoever shall say unto this
[51:33] mountain, Be thou removed, and be cast
[51:35] thou uh be thou cast into the sea, and
[51:38] shall not doubt in his heart, but shall
[51:39] believe that those things which he say
[51:42] shall come to pass, he shall have
[51:44] whatsoever he saith.
[51:46] Where therefore I say unto you, what
[51:49] things soever you desire when you pray,
[51:52] believe that you receive them, and you
[51:54] shall have them. Ain't that right? So,
[51:58] so now this was strange. No doubt even
[52:00] when Jesus is speaking this and it must
[52:03] have been a shocker for the disciples
[52:06] when they saw that the tree had obeyed
[52:09] Jesus's words. But that's how far man
[52:11] had come had fallen. It'd been so long
[52:15] since man just spoke something as Adam
[52:18] did, but we had fallen from that. Man
[52:22] had fallen from that authority. Ain't
[52:25] that right? And so, uh, we know that
[52:28] Jesus come to pay the price of
[52:30] redemption, to bring man back to to his
[52:34] position, to bring us back, uh, to from
[52:37] to what we fell from. Ain't that right?
[52:40] And so, he knew he knew that there would
[52:43] come a time that man would come back to
[52:45] this position of authority. And so he's
[52:49] he's saying, "Whosoever shall say to
[52:52] this mountain, be thou removed, and be
[52:54] thou cast in sea, don't doubt, it shall
[52:58] be done.
[52:59] You shall have what you say." Ain't that
[53:01] right?
[53:02] See, and so it and and so what was
[53:05] coming, Jesus is saying there's a
[53:07] fellowship. There's a a oneness that is
[53:10] going to happen. And when this happens,
[53:13] then man will be able to speak the word
[53:16] again. And you know, so I I look at that
[53:21] um uh uh uh it's it's coming to a
[53:25] oneness with God. I I believe that we've
[53:28] come to that place. I I believe this is
[53:31] what the adoption of sons are. Um the
[53:34] Paul talked about the manifestation of
[53:36] sons of God. Uh brother Brandham said
[53:39] that there was no time outside of this
[53:41] time that the sons of God are to be
[53:44] manifested. It's it's in this age and so
[53:48] but it's it's not it's it's not um uh
[53:52] speaking our own words. I I you know I I
[53:57] remember uh riding with the pastor and I
[53:59] was preaching a meeting uh uh at his
[54:02] church and uh we we had went and and uh
[54:06] so so he had told the uh church, you
[54:09] know, it had been raining apparently for
[54:11] for several weeks. And so he told the
[54:15] church uh he says, "We're tired of the
[54:16] rain. We're just tired of it, you know."
[54:18] And he says, "Tonight we're going to
[54:20] work the third pull." And uh so I
[54:22] thought, well, this will be interesting,
[54:24] you know, and uh he says, "We're going
[54:26] to work the third pool." And he said,
[54:28] "Rain, you know, don't come back for
[54:30] three days, you know, and uh and u so
[54:34] the church is all excited, you know, and
[54:35] I thought, well, you know, well, we went
[54:38] outside and it wasn't raining, you know,
[54:40] and uh next day it didn't rain, so I
[54:43] thought, well, this is good, you know."
[54:45] And um well the second day we were in
[54:47] the car and we were at a stoplight and
[54:50] it just just just dumped. I mean just
[54:52] pouring. And I just remember the pastor,
[54:55] you know, he looked up in the rear in
[54:57] his, you know, the windshield. He looked
[54:59] up toward heaven and says, "God, why are
[55:02] you doing this to me?" You know, and I I
[55:05] thought, well, that's a real shocker
[55:07] there. You know, uh you can't blame God
[55:10] for something that he didn't speak.
[55:12] Amen. And so, uh, and and I always kept
[55:16] that in my mind that you just can't work
[55:20] the third pull on your own.
[55:23] It it it it it's not our words.
[55:27] It's it's not something that we speak
[55:30] ourselves
[55:31] that we think. It's it's not that at
[55:34] all. Because you remember uh uh uh my
[55:38] words will fail, your words will fail.
[55:42] Uh Romans 3:4 says, "Let God be true and
[55:47] every man a liar." Ain't that right?
[55:49] And and so then it's not us speaking our
[55:52] words, but it's it's us speaking God's
[55:56] word under inspiration.
[56:00] And and so um uh Psalms 81:10,
[56:06] God says, "Open thy mouth wide and I
[56:10] will fill it." So then that the key is
[56:15] is that we just receive the word.
[56:19] He puts the words in us
[56:22] and we speak his word.
[56:25] Amen.
[56:26] Ain't that right? He he so he and and
[56:29] and I looked it all up. You know what
[56:31] brother Brandham said about that
[56:33] scripture that verse open thy mouth wide
[56:35] and I'll fill it. Brother Brandon says
[56:37] what he does he going to fill your mouth
[56:39] with word his word. He'll fill your
[56:42] mouth with his word and then you speak.
[56:47] Now the gospel has gone forth. Ain't
[56:50] that right? God has sent us a prophet.
[56:52] The word has been restored, been
[56:54] revealed to us. We do not need another
[56:57] messenger.
[56:59] We do not need an eighth angel. We uh
[57:02] Bible never promised it. And I know men
[57:04] only do that because they want
[57:06] attention. They want a gathering and
[57:08] people are dumb enough to follow it.
[57:11] But but we don't need that.
[57:13] God sent a seventh angel to open the
[57:16] mysteries, to reveal the mystery, to
[57:18] finish it up. And there is no mystery.
[57:21] We just need to believe it.
[57:24] believe what God has spoken. Ain't that
[57:26] right? So, so the gospel has gone forth.
[57:28] The word has has gone. So, it's not like
[57:31] we need something
[57:34] uh uh the Lord to come and give us
[57:36] something special to say
[57:40] and I and I hope you'll take that in the
[57:42] right way. Uh but brother Brandham, you
[57:46] know, as he's praying in one place said,
[57:49] Lord, the word's gone forth. May the
[57:51] people collect what words? Let let them
[57:55] collect some words. If they're sick, let
[57:59] them collect some words that they can
[58:01] believe it.
[58:03] Ain't that right?
[58:05] If if you're sick, just just click what
[58:07] words that have gone forth for your
[58:09] healing. If you need deliverance, just
[58:12] collect the words into your heart
[58:15] for for your deliverance. Ain't that
[58:18] right? God only backs up his words.
[58:21] Amen. That's that's the only thing he's
[58:23] going to back up. Now, Brother Brandon
[58:25] would tell us if you want deity in your
[58:27] midst. Now, we all know what deity is.
[58:30] That's God. That's the supernatural.
[58:33] Amen. That that's the time that nothing
[58:35] is impossible.
[58:37] Ain't that right? When he's in your
[58:40] midst, what devil can stand there and
[58:43] resist?
[58:45] So if you want deity in your midst, he
[58:48] says, then welcome and receive the word.
[58:52] Now people just ain't satisfied with
[58:54] what word God has given us in this age.
[58:57] So they need something better. They need
[58:59] something else. But if you want deity in
[59:02] your midst, just receive it. Just
[59:05] welcome the word and receive the word.
[59:09] Ain't that right? Now another place
[59:12] brother Brown said when we receive the
[59:14] word of God then we become God's word in
[59:18] flesh
[59:20] and he said the church should be in that
[59:23] condition.
[59:25] So so a prophet knowing where the church
[59:28] should be. It's not back in in the
[59:31] Methodist Pentecostal. It's not even
[59:34] back in in in Isusa or or or the day of
[59:38] Pentecost.
[59:39] We're up to a place that the church
[59:43] should be God's word made flesh.
[59:46] Can you say amen? Amen. So, and and we
[59:49] become God's word in our flesh when we
[59:53] receive the word of God.
[59:55] Now, again, the revealed word has been
[59:57] sold. In 1962, brother Brandham prayed
[1:00:01] uh saying this, "May the spirit water
[1:00:05] the seed, the word, and produce a crop,
[1:00:09] a bride for the Lord Jesus, a sanctified
[1:00:13] womb of the heart to receive the word."
[1:00:16] So, so God didn't bring send this
[1:00:19] prophet with a message, amen, in uh for
[1:00:22] not in in vain. But the spirit of God
[1:00:26] would produce a crop, a bride, a man
[1:00:29] that would have a a a sanctified womb of
[1:00:34] the heart to receive the word. Ain't
[1:00:37] that right?
[1:00:38] So So that word now becomes power. It's
[1:00:42] not just our word. It's not just us
[1:00:44] speaking. It's it's it's not us uh
[1:00:47] receiving a creed or tradition or we've
[1:00:50] been separated from that for the word's
[1:00:52] sake. And and so now the apostle Paul
[1:00:56] would tell us that the word came in
[1:00:58] power as well as in voice. The word when
[1:01:02] the word is spoken then the word also
[1:01:06] has power. Amen. There's power behind
[1:01:09] that voice. Do you believe that? So the
[1:01:13] preaching of the word actually
[1:01:14] demonstrated itself. and uh uh back in
[1:01:18] Paul's day. And when the word is spoken
[1:01:20] today, it still demonstrates itself. Do
[1:01:24] you believe that?
[1:01:26] Brother Brandham said, you know, he
[1:01:27] says, like a flaming cutting sword, it
[1:01:31] went to the consciences of men. Like a
[1:01:34] surgeon's knife, it cut out the diseases
[1:01:36] and set captives free. What was it? It
[1:01:39] was the word that went forth.
[1:01:41] Everywhere those early believers went,
[1:01:43] they went preaching the gospel, the
[1:01:45] word. And God confirmed that word with
[1:01:47] signs following. The sick were healed.
[1:01:50] Devils were cast out. They spoke in new
[1:01:53] tongues. That's that was the word in
[1:01:55] action. Right? That word has never
[1:01:58] failed in the mouths of believing
[1:02:00] Christians. When the word gets in the
[1:02:03] mouth of a believing Christian, that
[1:02:06] word will never fail, but it will
[1:02:09] demonstrate power.
[1:02:12] So he says, "And in this last stage, it
[1:02:14] is here stronger and greater than ever
[1:02:18] in the true word bride. It's it's here
[1:02:22] stronger than what was in the book of
[1:02:24] Acts. It was here. It's here stronger
[1:02:27] than what it was in any any age of of
[1:02:30] this of of the seven ages there or uh uh
[1:02:34] because uh um it's in the true word
[1:02:38] bride." So he says, "Oh little flock,
[1:02:40] you little minority, hold on to the
[1:02:42] word." Can you say amen? Hold on to the
[1:02:45] word. Fill your mouth and heart with it
[1:02:48] and someday God will give you the
[1:02:51] kingdom.
[1:02:52] Amen. I'm so glad for that. Ain't that
[1:02:54] right?
[1:02:55] So, so I I I tell you, we have the power
[1:02:59] right now.
[1:03:00] Amen. Deity is not in heaven. It's in
[1:03:03] you.
[1:03:04] Why? Because the word, you've received
[1:03:06] the word and the word is God, right? And
[1:03:09] so we we find that that as Paul, he said
[1:03:14] in Romans 10:8, he said, "The word is
[1:03:17] nighe even in thy mouth."
[1:03:21] Don't need magical tricks. Don't need a
[1:03:24] a wand wave over you. The word is nigh
[1:03:27] thee even in thy mouth and in thine
[1:03:30] heart. That is the word of faith which
[1:03:33] we preach.
[1:03:35] So it's the word of faith that is
[1:03:37] preached and when you receive it, it
[1:03:39] gets into your heart and from the
[1:03:42] abundance of the the heart, the mouth
[1:03:45] speaketh. So the word comes into your
[1:03:47] heart by you believing that word. It
[1:03:50] comes down inside of you and then you
[1:03:53] begin to have your mouth filled with
[1:03:56] that word.
[1:03:58] Lord,
[1:03:58] can you say amen?
[1:04:00] Amen. Now I I realize that there are
[1:04:04] times that we wait for, you know, we
[1:04:09] need to wait uh on God for to inspire us
[1:04:16] um you know uh to in what to speak. It's
[1:04:20] like brother Brandham would have never
[1:04:21] spoke the squirrels into existence if
[1:04:25] God hadn't inspired him to do so.
[1:04:29] And so as you know, brother Brandham
[1:04:31] told what happened that day and he says
[1:04:34] something said to me, "How many
[1:04:37] squirrels do you want?" So this was not
[1:04:39] brother Brandham coming up with this
[1:04:41] idea. Oh, I need squirrels today. God,
[1:04:44] give it to me. It it it was something
[1:04:48] that came to him, inspired him, put that
[1:04:52] thought in his mind, how many squirrels
[1:04:54] do you want? And he answered back and
[1:04:56] said, "Well, I've got, you know, 114
[1:04:59] this year, 117." I said, "If I if I had
[1:05:03] three more, it'd make 120. That would be
[1:05:06] just an even number to stop on." And I
[1:05:09] said, "Another thing, it'd give me six
[1:05:10] to take home."
[1:05:12] And he says that as he walked in the
[1:05:15] woods, something said to him,
[1:05:17] "Amen.
[1:05:18] Speak it."
[1:05:19] Amen.
[1:05:21] Say to it, "Speak three squirrels and
[1:05:25] you will have it."
[1:05:27] Can you say amen?
[1:05:28] Well, he wouldn't have done that had not
[1:05:30] God came to him and inspired him to
[1:05:34] speak them words.
[1:05:37] He would not have
[1:05:39] uh uh called the tumor out of spoke the
[1:05:43] tumor out of existence that was on his
[1:05:46] wife's side. had not God inspired him to
[1:05:53] speak it.
[1:05:53] Amen.
[1:05:54] Remember, she had had it all them that
[1:05:56] for years and and it was getting worse
[1:05:59] and worse. The doctor says, "You better
[1:06:01] let me take that out. Cut that out." And
[1:06:04] brother Bram said, "No, just wait.
[1:06:06] Wait." And it kept, you know, putting it
[1:06:08] off, putting it off. And she was in a
[1:06:10] lot of pain. And finally, you know, it
[1:06:13] just it just come to it that she had to
[1:06:15] go. and and so she had gotten the
[1:06:18] appointment made and everything and uh
[1:06:21] um but he was in prayer. Uh she was in
[1:06:25] Arizona, I believe he was I believe
[1:06:27] maybe back in Jeffersonville or
[1:06:29] whatever, but he was alone and he just
[1:06:31] knelt down and began to pray for her and
[1:06:33] just say, "God, you know, she's been a
[1:06:35] good wife to me and uh to my children
[1:06:38] and and all these things." And as he's
[1:06:41] praying, then then uh uh uh brother
[1:06:46] Brandham says, "There came that light
[1:06:48] hanging down there and it said, "Stand
[1:06:51] up on your feet."
[1:06:53] Amen.
[1:06:54] And I stood up and he said, "Whatever
[1:06:57] you say, that's the way it will be."
[1:07:02] Well, see, Brother Bram never spoke it.
[1:07:04] I mean, he he he was waiting for
[1:07:07] something. He he was asking God. He was
[1:07:10] pleading for her life.
[1:07:12] He He was, "Oh, God, be merciful to
[1:07:15] her." And And the spirit of God came in
[1:07:18] there. Stand up.
[1:07:21] Speak it. And whatever you say, it's
[1:07:23] going to happen.
[1:07:25] See, so there there has to be an
[1:07:28] inspiration
[1:07:29] before we speak. Ain't that right? But
[1:07:32] maybe sometimes we're waiting for
[1:07:36] something to happen
[1:07:39] that will never be. Maybe we're waiting
[1:07:42] for something big. Maybe we're waiting
[1:07:45] for lightning to flash out of heaven and
[1:07:47] strike us, you know, and give us a uh uh
[1:07:51] some fantastic idea about something. And
[1:07:56] you know, but until then, we just, you
[1:07:58] know, we we just living h just barely
[1:08:01] making it and oh, woe is me and I don't
[1:08:05] know, you know, and and and just kind of
[1:08:08] all of these things. Where's God? And
[1:08:10] and uh we ain't seeing nothing happening
[1:08:14] and and whatever, you know, and uh uh
[1:08:18] and and maybe we just imagine a certain
[1:08:20] thing has to happen before we can say
[1:08:24] anything.
[1:08:25] But see if we have received the word
[1:08:28] which is the word of faith then that
[1:08:32] word of faith is in our heart and in our
[1:08:35] mouth.
[1:08:37] Can you say amen? That word of faith is
[1:08:40] still there in our heart and in our
[1:08:42] mouth. Now in in our opening scripture,
[1:08:45] this woman uh uh uh heard about the
[1:08:48] miracles that Jesus had done. Uh she was
[1:08:51] not a Jew. She was a Greek woman and she
[1:08:55] was not familiar with Jesus's ministry.
[1:08:58] Did not personally see, was not an
[1:09:01] eyewitness of any of the miracles that
[1:09:04] Jesus done. But she had heard his fame
[1:09:08] had spread abroad and and she heard of
[1:09:12] the miracles that was happening and what
[1:09:15] he had done and no doubt heard about the
[1:09:18] water being turned into to wine and no
[1:09:21] doubt maybe heard about Lazarus or of
[1:09:24] the dead being raised or or whatever.
[1:09:27] And but but as she heard these things,
[1:09:31] faith come alive in her heart and and
[1:09:35] she determined, I'm going to go see him.
[1:09:40] I'm going to get an audience with him
[1:09:42] and I'm going to get what I need from
[1:09:45] him. Her daughter was vexed of a devil.
[1:09:49] She was being tormented. Ain't that
[1:09:52] right? And so we we know now that faith
[1:09:55] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[1:09:59] word of God. So so what I'm saying is is
[1:10:02] every day every time you're coming to
[1:10:05] church, you have the opportunity to take
[1:10:08] faith into your heart. You have the
[1:10:11] opportunity to hear the word and let
[1:10:14] that word come alive in your heart.
[1:10:17] Every time you play the message in at
[1:10:19] your home or in your car or wherever
[1:10:21] you're at, you have the opportunity
[1:10:23] right there to let faith come alive into
[1:10:26] your heart. That's why you cannot let
[1:10:28] these uh services and you cannot let the
[1:10:30] message become common. That's your faith
[1:10:33] line. That's that's your source of
[1:10:35] faith.
[1:10:37] And and and so faith cometh by hearing
[1:10:39] the word of God. Now, brother Bram says
[1:10:42] when faith takes a hold, God is there.
[1:10:47] Can you say amen?
[1:10:49] So, so this little lady had determined
[1:10:51] within herself to see Jesus. And the
[1:10:53] problem said she had many hindrances.
[1:10:56] Maybe her church, they didn't believe in
[1:11:00] miracles. They weren't part of Jesus.
[1:11:01] Maybe they weren't looking for Messiah.
[1:11:04] They weren't looking for nothing.
[1:11:07] They they didn't have the promises like
[1:11:09] the Jews had. She was a Greek.
[1:11:12] But but she so she had different. So
[1:11:15] when the the moment she decided, I'm
[1:11:16] going to go see maybe her, you know, her
[1:11:18] bishop heard about it, her priest, and
[1:11:20] says, "Oh, you can't go. That's
[1:11:22] fanaticism."
[1:11:24] Maybe her friends would tell her, "Oh,
[1:11:27] you're crazy. You're not of that race.
[1:11:30] You you you
[1:11:32] you're not in that class of people. They
[1:11:34] they ain't going to hear you.
[1:11:37] Yeah. You You understand what I'm
[1:11:38] saying? And and so maybe the friends,
[1:11:41] the family, everybody just tried to
[1:11:43] discourage her. Maybe she didn't have
[1:11:45] really have the money uh uh to travel
[1:11:48] that far, Amen. to see Jesus. Brother
[1:11:51] Brandham said somebody might have
[1:11:52] reminded her that she was a Greek woman
[1:11:54] and that she wasn't in his class of
[1:11:56] people. They may have told her that she
[1:11:58] had to have different skin color than
[1:12:00] his or uh might have told her that
[1:12:02] there's no such thing as that healing
[1:12:04] that you hear about. It's just another
[1:12:06] fanatic that is raised up. A lot of
[1:12:09] hindrances, but the prophet said her
[1:12:12] faith had no hindrance at all. She might
[1:12:16] have had the hindrance, but her faith
[1:12:18] didn't have the hindrance. Can you say
[1:12:20] amen? He said, see, faith doesn't have
[1:12:23] any hindrance at all. there's nothing
[1:12:26] that can hinder faith.
[1:12:29] So, you know, she's endured all of these
[1:12:32] this the setbacks and all these things
[1:12:34] and she finally gets an audience with
[1:12:36] with Jesus and Jesus ignores her and and
[1:12:41] that that well that that probably enough
[1:12:44] to to uh to discourage a lot of people
[1:12:47] today that cause well forget it, you
[1:12:50] know. And yet she she she stood there
[1:12:54] and she's making her plea to him.
[1:12:56] Amen.
[1:12:57] And finally when he responds it's well
[1:13:01] it's not meat
[1:13:03] for me to give the children's bread to
[1:13:05] dogs.
[1:13:06] Called her a dog.
[1:13:09] Insulted her.
[1:13:10] Ain't that right?
[1:13:12] But you know that what brother Brandham
[1:13:16] uh uh points out to us is that she
[1:13:20] actually agreed with him instead of
[1:13:23] getting assault insulted by it. She
[1:13:27] agreed
[1:13:29] instead of walking away from the insult
[1:13:31] and and feeling rejected. She agreed
[1:13:35] with him. Now the prophet says anytime
[1:13:38] faith is there faith will agree with the
[1:13:41] word.
[1:13:44] Can you say amen?
[1:13:46] So yes she agreed with him and said yes
[1:13:48] that's truth. See and so he says see how
[1:13:52] real faith will witness the word to be
[1:13:55] truth.
[1:13:56] She was speaking the word of faith.
[1:14:00] Can you say amen?
[1:14:02] Now listen. See, she she already had
[1:14:04] faith in him knowing that she's going to
[1:14:07] give the answer.
[1:14:09] She had faith knowing that he is the one
[1:14:13] that could change the situation.
[1:14:16] Ain't that right? So, she now it was the
[1:14:20] word of faith speaking. Faith wouldn't
[1:14:22] let her get discouraged. Faith wouldn't
[1:14:24] let her get insulted. Faith wouldn't let
[1:14:27] her give up. Satan wouldn't let her
[1:14:30] faith wouldn't let her just turn her
[1:14:32] back and walk away and go back home. So
[1:14:34] the word of faith began to speak and
[1:14:36] said, "Yay, Lord, I understand that.
[1:14:39] I'll take that insult."
[1:14:42] But
[1:14:45] even the dogs eat from the crumbs that
[1:14:47] fall off the master's table.
[1:14:50] Can you say amen?
[1:14:52] See, so the prophet says when faith
[1:14:54] speaks, everything else shuts up.
[1:14:56] Symptoms cannot speak when faith speaks.
[1:15:00] Can you say amen?
[1:15:01] And the woman's faith was speaking.
[1:15:06] Amen.
[1:15:07] Well, her faith was inspired by the word
[1:15:11] of what she had heard about the miracles
[1:15:13] and all of these things. Can you say
[1:15:16] amen? And so here her she believed what
[1:15:20] Jesus was saying was the truth and her
[1:15:23] words were agreeing with what she had
[1:15:25] believed. See she agreed with what Jesus
[1:15:29] was saying but her faith caused her to
[1:15:31] say but even the dogs eat from the
[1:15:34] crumbs that fall off the master's table.
[1:15:37] Can you say amen? You know the prophet
[1:15:39] said she wasn't after all the bread that
[1:15:41] the children could eat. She was just
[1:15:44] after crumbs.
[1:15:46] Hello. She was just after crumbs. Now
[1:15:50] church, we're we don't have to just
[1:15:52] accept crumbs. We're not invited to eat
[1:15:54] crumbs. We're invited to sit at the
[1:15:57] master's table.
[1:16:01] So she expressed her faith by her words.
[1:16:04] And and so Jesus says, "For this saying,
[1:16:09] for this saying, well, what if she
[1:16:11] didn't say nothing?
[1:16:13] What if she would have just looked at
[1:16:15] him,
[1:16:17] stuck her tongue out,
[1:16:19] wrinkled her nose at him, and gave him
[1:16:21] an evil look, but there was faith in her
[1:16:24] heart.
[1:16:27] And faith knows no hindrance.
[1:16:29] Amen.
[1:16:30] In her own self, she might have felt
[1:16:32] insulted, but faith was there.
[1:16:36] Ain't that right?
[1:16:38] And she expressed her faith by her
[1:16:39] words. And Jesus says, "For this saying,
[1:16:41] go thy way. The devil is gone."
[1:16:45] The devil is gone from thy daughter.
[1:16:47] Hello.
[1:16:49] She didn't receive a lightning bolt.
[1:16:52] She didn't receive something, you know,
[1:16:54] a a thunder roll.
[1:16:57] She just had faith in her heart.
[1:17:00] And let that faith speak.
[1:17:06] And the devil had to go. The devil that
[1:17:09] had been vexing her daughter had to go
[1:17:12] because there was something that she
[1:17:15] said that pleased him.
[1:17:18] Can you say amen
[1:17:19] for this thing? It wasn't that Jesus
[1:17:22] felt sorry for her.
[1:17:24] It was what she said
[1:17:27] by faith. Amen.
[1:17:32] Now, that was the first miracle ever
[1:17:34] performed on a gentile.
[1:17:38] And notice, she wasn't going around
[1:17:40] saying, "Well, you know, this might all
[1:17:42] be in vain.
[1:17:44] I don't even know if I'm going to get
[1:17:46] the miracle or not." No, that wouldn't
[1:17:49] been faith.
[1:17:50] There would have been no need for her to
[1:17:52] try. There would have been no need for
[1:17:54] her to start even on the trip. But her
[1:17:57] faith brought her to Christ.
[1:17:59] Can you say amen?
[1:18:01] Now, so now the prophet said she come
[1:18:04] reverently,
[1:18:06] peacefully,
[1:18:08] humbly.
[1:18:08] Amen.
[1:18:09] And he says faith, everybody say faith
[1:18:12] always
[1:18:14] humbles
[1:18:16] itself to the word.
[1:18:18] To the word.
[1:18:18] When there's real faith, it always
[1:18:21] humbles itself to the word.
[1:18:24] Amen.
[1:18:26] Ain't that right?
[1:18:27] Amen.
[1:18:27] Now, the prophet said Jesus never went
[1:18:30] to go pray for her daughter. Never did.
[1:18:33] He just said it. And that's all she
[1:18:36] wanted to know.
[1:18:39] That's all she needed to know from him
[1:18:42] is the devil's gone.
[1:18:44] She didn't need him to come there just
[1:18:46] in case. Her faith was intact.
[1:18:52] Can you say amen?
[1:18:54] He says, "I can imagine her saying,
[1:18:56] "Thank you, my Lord. Blessed be your
[1:18:59] holy name." And all the critics standing
[1:19:02] on the street say, "Hey, what did you
[1:19:04] get?" "Oh, my daughter's healed."
[1:19:07] Well, how do you know? She was having a
[1:19:09] fit just when I left there. Oh, that
[1:19:11] don't make a bit of difference. I got
[1:19:13] it. Why? He said so.
[1:19:18] Can you say amen? If faith would cause
[1:19:21] her to agree with his insult, then it
[1:19:24] would actually cause her to agree with
[1:19:27] what he said about her daughter.
[1:19:31] Praise the Lord. That's good.
[1:19:32] Can you say amen?
[1:19:35] Well, how do you know you got it? He
[1:19:36] said so.
[1:19:38] Amen. Amen.
[1:19:39] Amen.
[1:19:40] She met the pastor of her goddess down
[1:19:42] there and he said, "Why? You know what?
[1:19:44] I've got your letter wrote out." In
[1:19:47] other words, I'm going to dismiss you.
[1:19:49] you're excommunicated. He said, "I she
[1:19:52] she said, "I'll save you the trouble.
[1:19:54] Don't even bring it to me. Just throw it
[1:19:56] in the fire anyhow." Why? I'm on my
[1:19:58] road. I've got my request. My daughter's
[1:20:02] healed. She was claiming her healing
[1:20:05] before she even saw the miracle.
[1:20:08] But her faith was resting in what the
[1:20:10] word said. It was a true faith to humble
[1:20:14] itself to the word.
[1:20:16] Amen.
[1:20:17] Can you say amen?
[1:20:19] Brother Brandham talked to Sister Hadtie
[1:20:22] Wright.
[1:20:23] She had a sister that was an invalid.
[1:20:27] She was very poor. Her parents were
[1:20:30] poor.
[1:20:31] There were needs in her family. She had
[1:20:34] the two boys that needed salvation.
[1:20:39] But when brother Brandham was there
[1:20:41] telling the story of the squirrels being
[1:20:44] created, I honestly don't think that her
[1:20:48] mind was on the boys. I don't think her
[1:20:50] mind was upon her sister. I, you know, I
[1:20:52] I'm just, now that's me. I believe she
[1:20:56] got so wrapped up in what Brother Bram
[1:20:59] was saying.
[1:21:01] That it just inspired faith in her.
[1:21:04] Amen.
[1:21:06] She didn't just stop say, "Hey, hey,
[1:21:08] well then try that with my boys then.
[1:21:10] Try that with my sister.
[1:21:12] Try if if that if you're saying is true,
[1:21:15] then why aren't my sister being healed?"
[1:21:19] You understand what I'm saying? But it
[1:21:22] inspired faith in him in her
[1:21:25] to where she just got so wrapped up in
[1:21:28] it.
[1:21:29] She spoke it
[1:21:31] and said that ain't nothing but the
[1:21:34] truth.
[1:21:35] She wasn't worrying. She I don't think
[1:21:37] she was thinking about the results that
[1:21:39] that would bring.
[1:21:41] It was just something in her heart.
[1:21:44] The word became filled. Her mouth was
[1:21:47] filled.
[1:21:49] That's true.
[1:21:50] With a word.
[1:21:52] Amen. That's true. That's good.
[1:21:56] That ain't nothing but the truth. Can
[1:21:58] you say amen?
[1:21:59] That's right.
[1:22:01] I don't think she was in the depths
[1:22:02] feeling sorry for herself.
[1:22:05] I don't think she was just troubled with
[1:22:09] all the cares of life. Something about
[1:22:11] that word that the prophet was saying
[1:22:13] arrested her heart.
[1:22:16] She got in the inspiration of it. Her
[1:22:19] faith got inspired by it. Can you say
[1:22:22] amen? And her faith
[1:22:26] caused her to speak the words that
[1:22:29] agreed with what the prophet was saying.
[1:22:34] Can you say amen?
[1:22:35] I'll say that again. Her faith caused
[1:22:38] her to speak words that agreed with what
[1:22:42] the prophet was saying.
[1:22:46] Amen.
[1:22:47] It pleased God.
[1:22:49] Yes, sir.
[1:22:51] What she spoke pleased God.
[1:22:53] Amen.
[1:22:54] She didn't have words to say until a
[1:22:57] prophet began to tell the story.
[1:23:00] And as she's hearing the word,
[1:23:03] as she's hearing the truth,
[1:23:06] her faith was being inspired and it
[1:23:08] filled her mouth.
[1:23:11] Can you say amen?
[1:23:13] Yes, sir.
[1:23:14] Amen.
[1:23:18] Brother Brham said she said the right
[1:23:20] thing.
[1:23:22] Ain't that right?
[1:23:23] She didn't sit around saying, "Well, I
[1:23:25] wonder what I can say that'll please
[1:23:27] God."
[1:23:28] It was just something in her heart.
[1:23:30] It was burning in her heart.
[1:23:33] She just had to amen the word.
[1:23:36] Can you say amen? You see, when it comes
[1:23:38] from the heart and it's being an
[1:23:40] inspiration and we start agreeing with
[1:23:42] that word, it pleases God.
[1:23:46] You don't have to go around and say,
[1:23:47] "Well, I wonder what I could say to
[1:23:48] please God." I just wonder, you know,
[1:23:51] no, she said the right thing. And what
[1:23:53] was it? She admitted the word was right.
[1:23:59] Ain't that right?
[1:24:01] Yep. Bream said, "Faith will always
[1:24:04] agree with the word." Faith admits
[1:24:07] the word is the truth.
[1:24:09] Amen.
[1:24:09] He said if you've got real faith and the
[1:24:12] Bible tells you that you you are doing
[1:24:14] wrong, you'll admit that you're doing
[1:24:16] wrong.
[1:24:18] Amen.
[1:24:19] Why? Because faith admits the word is
[1:24:21] right.
[1:24:22] It just admits the truth.
[1:24:25] And here Jesus called that woman a dog
[1:24:28] and yet she says, "True, Lord,
[1:24:31] true."
[1:24:34] The faith also said, "But
[1:24:37] even though dogs eat from the crumbs
[1:24:39] that fall off the master's table,"
[1:24:41] you understand what I'm saying?
[1:24:43] You ain't, you know, people get so
[1:24:45] offended at the word these days. Oh,
[1:24:46] he's stepping on me. He He just trying
[1:24:48] to preach at me all. But faith would
[1:24:51] really just say, "I'm wrong."
[1:24:54] Faith just admits it.
[1:24:56] Can you say amen? Why? whether it's a
[1:24:58] corrective, whether it's a a positive or
[1:25:01] or well, the word's always positive, but
[1:25:04] it can correct. It can uplift, it can it
[1:25:06] can whatever, but the the faith just
[1:25:09] says that's the truth.
[1:25:13] And because we believe it, we repent.
[1:25:15] Amen.
[1:25:16] Can you say amen? So he says, if you got
[1:25:18] real faith and the Bible tells you that
[1:25:20] you're doing wrong, you'll admit that
[1:25:21] you're wrong. You won't say, "Well, now
[1:25:23] wait a minute here. I belong to. He
[1:25:27] said, "No, no, that's not faith." When
[1:25:29] the word says it, that's where you're
[1:25:31] right or wrong is by the word.
[1:25:34] Can you say amen? That's where you're
[1:25:36] right or wrong is by the word. Amen.
[1:25:39] Now, see, that's where oneness with God
[1:25:43] uh comes. Brother Bram said,
[1:25:44] "Onnesseness with God is to have God's
[1:25:47] spirit in you, agreeing with the word,
[1:25:50] all the word, the whole word, and to
[1:25:53] make it manifested in power."
[1:25:57] Now, Haddie wasn't waiting for a
[1:25:59] lightning bolt.
[1:26:03] She wasn't waiting for, "Oh, God, if
[1:26:05] you'd just say something to me and cause
[1:26:07] me to speak to my mountain, I know it'll
[1:26:09] be healed. I know it'll be right."
[1:26:12] But just at the words of a prophet,
[1:26:15] what was being said, she realized it was
[1:26:17] the truth.
[1:26:18] Amen.
[1:26:20] She's going to admit it. Whether you
[1:26:22] know what, you understand what I'm
[1:26:23] saying?
[1:26:24] We get so busy looking at our problems
[1:26:26] that we start complaining.
[1:26:29] We start looking around. Well, God, I
[1:26:32] don't know.
[1:26:34] But she wasn't in that. She wasn't doing
[1:26:36] that. She was being inspired by word.
[1:26:40] Praise the Lord.
[1:26:43] I hope that makes sense to you.
[1:26:47] Just hearing the word
[1:26:50] and the faith went within her agreed
[1:26:53] with it and she spoke words that pleased
[1:26:56] God.
[1:26:59] And the inspiration came down
[1:27:03] and a word was spoke. A word of
[1:27:06] salvation was spoke
[1:27:08] to her boys. Amen.
[1:27:11] Can you say amen?
[1:27:13] You see, saying the right thing will get
[1:27:15] God's attention.
[1:27:16] I believe Brother Brham said that.
[1:27:18] Saying the right thing will get God's
[1:27:20] attention.
[1:27:22] Brother Brandham,
[1:27:24] he was fixing to have discernment. You
[1:27:26] know how he talks and to the people and
[1:27:29] things. And he said to the audience, he
[1:27:31] said, "You just say,"Father God, Brother
[1:27:34] Ram knows nothing about me. Maybe you
[1:27:37] don't even know me.
[1:27:42] Uh maybe you don't know even know me.
[1:27:46] Any um it don't matter where you are.
[1:27:49] Just somewhere in the building. Just
[1:27:51] say, "Father God, he knows nothing about
[1:27:53] me, but let him speak to me and tell me
[1:27:56] what my trouble is." Or something like
[1:27:57] that, and I'll believe you. I believe
[1:28:00] you because the word is then I know is
[1:28:04] flesh with he and I together with a
[1:28:08] contact with God. The Holy Spirit is
[1:28:09] here. Let him do it. As soon as he said
[1:28:12] that, he looked at a woman and said that
[1:28:15] lady with her hands laying on her lap
[1:28:17] like that looked up and said, "Yes."
[1:28:21] Just then as she nodded her head, she
[1:28:24] believed it.
[1:28:25] You just said the right thing.
[1:28:29] Just agreeing with the word.
[1:28:31] Amen.
[1:28:32] Just simply saying yes.
[1:28:36] Can you say amen?
[1:28:37] You just said the right thing. The high
[1:28:39] blood pressure you've got and the trail
[1:28:41] heart trouble, if you'll believe with
[1:28:43] all your heart, it'll leave you.
[1:28:45] Can you say amen?
[1:28:47] We know of the story of the little fish
[1:28:50] that was
[1:28:52] brought to life by the power of the
[1:28:55] third pool, the spoken word. Praise the
[1:28:58] Lord.
[1:28:58] You know, Brother Bram said how that
[1:29:00] come about is brother Banks Woods.
[1:29:04] He said the right thing.
[1:29:08] And he was telling his brother, he said,
[1:29:10] "We ought to go over here to some old
[1:29:12] lady. She's about 90 years old." And
[1:29:14] said, "When we were little Jehovah's
[1:29:16] Witness boys, she used to go around
[1:29:18] there and give us bread and butter." He
[1:29:21] said, "You remember that homemade
[1:29:22] bread?" Talking to his brother. He said,
[1:29:23] "We ought to go tell her that we are
[1:29:25] saved." He said that was the right thing
[1:29:29] to say.
[1:29:32] And as soon as he said that,
[1:29:35] there come that whirlwind rolling down
[1:29:39] and he said, "Thus sayeth the Lord,
[1:29:41] you'll see a resurrection of a small
[1:29:43] animal." Remember that?
[1:29:46] Now, I'm not going to keep you.
[1:29:50] But brother Brandham as he's talking
[1:29:52] about that he says please try to catch
[1:29:55] this. So this is important right? Please
[1:29:59] try to catch this. It's just the way you
[1:30:02] say things sometimes
[1:30:04] that changes the whole setup.
[1:30:07] Amen.
[1:30:08] True.
[1:30:10] Can you say amen? Yeah.
[1:30:14] This tells us that we've got to be
[1:30:17] careful on what we say and how we say
[1:30:19] it. And
[1:30:21] we've got to keep our heart in reverence
[1:30:23] to the word.
[1:30:26] No matter what els us, no matter what
[1:30:29] troubles us, no matter what comes,
[1:30:32] we've had enough word to inspire faith
[1:30:34] in us,
[1:30:37] right? Amen.
[1:30:38] To where we could say the right thing
[1:30:42] to say words that would be agreement
[1:30:45] to say, "Well, I I don't know if I'm
[1:30:47] going to make it." Well, that's not in
[1:30:48] agreement with the word.
[1:30:51] Well, I I just don't I'm It's just
[1:30:53] getting worse. I just don't know. It's
[1:30:55] not in agreement with the word.
[1:30:58] When we're allowing depression, when
[1:31:00] we're allowing spirits and we're
[1:31:02] allowing things to get on us, and I
[1:31:04] understand we fight these things
[1:31:08] and I tell you, if you give into thing
[1:31:10] things,
[1:31:12] these type of things, it'll succumb you
[1:31:16] and it and it just becomes more it grabs
[1:31:20] a more of a hold on you and you you just
[1:31:22] start being negative about your life,
[1:31:25] about your situation, about whatever.
[1:31:27] You just start speaking negative and
[1:31:28] before you know it, it starts taking
[1:31:30] over
[1:31:31] because you're you're a channel and
[1:31:33] you're opening a channel. I'll just say
[1:31:35] it. You're opening a channel to a spirit
[1:31:37] of unbelief.
[1:31:39] It's it's the devil.
[1:31:42] Well, I don't know if my children are
[1:31:43] going to get saved because look at them.
[1:31:45] Well, see, you're opening up. You've got
[1:31:47] enough promises here. Now that that
[1:31:50] little Greek woman didn't have a promise
[1:31:52] at all,
[1:31:54] but she heard what he was doing. She
[1:31:57] heard the miracles that were taking
[1:31:59] place in in among the Israel, and she
[1:32:03] just said, "I'm going to go be part of
[1:32:05] this. I've got a need. I'm going to get
[1:32:08] my answer."
[1:32:09] With no promise whatsoever of receiving
[1:32:12] her miracle. But we've got promise after
[1:32:15] promise after promise because we are the
[1:32:18] seed of Abraham.
[1:32:20] We have got a covenant that God made
[1:32:22] with us unconditional.
[1:32:25] Amen.
[1:32:26] Can you say amen?
[1:32:29] So see, it's just the way you say things
[1:32:33] sometimes that changes the whole
[1:32:34] setupsy. So don't let the world put
[1:32:38] things in your mouth.
[1:32:41] Don't don't let your situation
[1:32:44] uh don't let the devil use your
[1:32:46] situation,
[1:32:49] feelings, emotions,
[1:32:52] your five senses of the body, five
[1:32:54] senses of the spirit,
[1:32:57] to where you open up. Well, I got prayed
[1:33:00] for, but I'm really hurt and I ain't
[1:33:01] seeing no positive. You're opening up
[1:33:06] to to Satan coming in.
[1:33:11] Hello.
[1:33:12] See, so so you you you
[1:33:16] when he tries to come in, that's where
[1:33:18] we got to resist that spirit.
[1:33:21] Say, I'm not going there. I ain't
[1:33:23] dwelling on that. Thank you, Lord.
[1:33:26] Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:33:35] So, don't let the unbeliever put
[1:33:36] thoughts in your mind that are contrary
[1:33:38] to God's word.
[1:33:39] Amen.
[1:33:40] Don't let Hollywood
[1:33:43] shape your mind about what religion
[1:33:45] ought to be.
[1:33:47] They they they can do good movies. They
[1:33:49] can come up with Christian thoughts and
[1:33:51] Christian idea, but they know nothing
[1:33:53] about the power of God.
[1:33:55] They all lean to psychology. They all
[1:33:57] lean to some natural thing.
[1:34:01] Hello.
[1:34:04] Don't let some theologian put creeds and
[1:34:07] denominational teachings in you.
[1:34:09] Yeah.
[1:34:11] You say, "Well, you know, but they they
[1:34:13] were good. Charles Spurgeon was a good
[1:34:15] good preacher." That's fine. No doubt he
[1:34:18] was. But that's not the word for our
[1:34:19] day.
[1:34:22] You understand what I'm saying? We got
[1:34:24] to take all that word, the whole word.
[1:34:26] receive the word. If if Moody was great,
[1:34:29] if if all this and they were for their
[1:34:31] day, then God wouldn't need to send a
[1:34:33] prophet.
[1:34:35] But what they had did not bring on the
[1:34:37] manifestation of sons.
[1:34:40] What they had did not bring us to a
[1:34:42] perfect faith.
[1:34:44] Amen.
[1:34:46] Can you say amen?
[1:34:48] So, see, we are to receive the word.
[1:34:50] Everybody say, "Receive the word."
[1:34:52] Receive the word. Now Joshua 1:8 says,
[1:34:55] "This book of the law shall not depart
[1:34:56] out of thy mouth, but thou shalt
[1:34:58] meditate therein day and night, that
[1:35:00] thou mayest observe to do according to
[1:35:02] all that is written therein. For then
[1:35:05] thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and
[1:35:07] then thou shalt have good success."
[1:35:10] But what the word's got to not depart
[1:35:12] out of thy mouth,
[1:35:14] and you got to meditate it. Meditate
[1:35:16] therein day and night. Day and night,
[1:35:18] day and night.
[1:35:20] Can you say amen?
[1:35:22] Philippians 4:8, brother uh Paul, I
[1:35:25] believe, says, "Fining, brethren,
[1:35:27] whatsoever things are true, whatsoever
[1:35:29] things are honest, whatsoever things are
[1:35:32] just, whatsoever things are pure,
[1:35:34] whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever
[1:35:36] things are of good report, if there be
[1:35:38] any virtue, if there be any praise,
[1:35:40] think on these things."
[1:35:42] So, what do we need to do? Keep Christ
[1:35:44] on your mind.
[1:35:46] Keep healing on your mind. Keep the
[1:35:49] promise on your mind.
[1:35:51] Can you say amen? Yes, it would be easy
[1:35:54] to let the devil take over our minds,
[1:35:57] but you cannot let him take over.
[1:36:00] It's the most easiest thing to just
[1:36:03] surrender
[1:36:05] to to negativity.
[1:36:07] Yeah.
[1:36:08] It's it's the most easiest thing, I
[1:36:10] guess, to surrender to to to what the
[1:36:13] world is telling us
[1:36:16] cuz we still got a sticky nature. Yeah,
[1:36:18] sure.
[1:36:20] Ain't that right?
[1:36:21] That's right.
[1:36:22] But as Christians, we've got to put all
[1:36:25] of that under our feet. Casting all
[1:36:28] imaginations,
[1:36:29] taking all of the doubt, taking all
[1:36:32] those things, and and that anything that
[1:36:34] exalts itself above the word of God,
[1:36:36] cast it down.
[1:36:38] Ain't that right?
[1:36:41] Keep the salvation of your children on
[1:36:43] your mind.
[1:36:44] Amen.
[1:36:47] Now notice, brother Bram said, if any
[1:36:49] thought comes by, well, maybe it
[1:36:51] couldn't be. So get it off your mind
[1:36:54] right quick.
[1:36:54] Amen.
[1:36:55] Think on things that's positive. Never
[1:36:58] let a negative thought pass through.
[1:37:00] Don't let it stop anyhow
[1:37:02] if it starts to. Keep your thoughts
[1:37:05] positive
[1:37:06] on Christ.
[1:37:08] Don't think sitting there in a
[1:37:10] wheelchair that you're hopeless and
[1:37:12] helpless. You're not. Think of that.
[1:37:15] He didn't ask her, "How long you been in
[1:37:18] that wheelchair?"
[1:37:20] He didn't know need to know if she was
[1:37:21] born that way. He didn't need to know
[1:37:24] nothing. He just told her, "You're not.
[1:37:26] You're not helpless. You're not
[1:37:28] hopeless."
[1:37:29] Why? Because all things are possible to
[1:37:31] them that believe.
[1:37:33] Ain't that right?
[1:37:35] So, he says, "See, uh uh um uh he says,
[1:37:39] see, you're not. Don't let that negative
[1:37:41] thought ever pass through. Don't let it
[1:37:44] anchor. You can't help it from going
[1:37:46] through your mind. That's right. But
[1:37:48] don't let it stop. Like the old farmer
[1:37:50] said, "I can't keep the birds from
[1:37:51] flying over my place." But he had a
[1:37:54] doublebarreled shotgun. He said, "I can
[1:37:56] sure keep them from roosting." So you do
[1:37:58] the same thing. Don't let them roost.
[1:38:03] Let them pass right on through.
[1:38:06] Amen. That's good.
[1:38:08] Ain't that right? Amen.
[1:38:10] If the musicians will come, brother
[1:38:12] Brandham,
[1:38:15] he was fixing to have a prayer line. And
[1:38:17] notice what he says to the congregation.
[1:38:23] He said, "Now, every one of you, not
[1:38:25] only ministers, but all all of you ought
[1:38:28] to pray for these people.
[1:38:32] You don't know
[1:38:34] what God might do for you while you're
[1:38:36] praying for someone else,
[1:38:38] right?
[1:38:39] What if you would say the right thing?
[1:38:43] Amen.
[1:38:46] Right.
[1:38:46] Amen.
[1:38:47] God, let our prayer be the right words.
[1:38:50] Amen.
[1:38:51] Let what we say be the right thing.
[1:38:55] And I know speaking negative about
[1:38:56] ourselves or about people or whatever it
[1:38:59] that doesn't help. That ain't of God. It
[1:39:00] ain't going to please God. It has to be
[1:39:03] the word of faith
[1:39:04] coming from a heart of faith
[1:39:07] that has received the word by faith.
[1:39:11] Ain't that right?
[1:39:13] So what if you'd say the right thing?
[1:39:15] Here's a woman standing here that's so
[1:39:17] sick they have to hold her up. But what
[1:39:20] if your prayer would be the right thing?
[1:39:23] Just like Banks said the right thing.
[1:39:26] Like Hattie said the right thing. What
[1:39:29] if you would say the right thing and
[1:39:31] your prayer would cause God to come down
[1:39:34] and do something?

[1:40:53] has given us in this age to change
