exceedingly and abundantly above all that we could ask or thinking man amen we say God bless you all this evening we'll be off for the music tonight the musicians can be dismissed and we certainly want to say yeah it's an honor and a privilege to be in God's house anytime amen and to be with his people and this evening we're sure thankful for the opportunity to stand before you tonight and speak to you from the message of the hour and we're just praying that something was said this morning to bless you and to help you and to encourage you and amen sure good to see everyone here tonight that wasn't able to be here this morning and we also want to say we sure enjoyed our time together there in Pennsylvania this week and I know if you weren't able to make it you sure missed out and so maybe Lord willing I don't know open if we do it next year Lord we wouldn't plan to be there amen just a wonderful time of fellowship and amen I tell you I know we have friends and maybe friends that are not Believers or not we work with or go to school with or something but there's nothing like fellowship with Believers amen you don't have to worry about what they're talking about or what they're going to say you can just enjoy one another's company amen and so we sure want to say we love and appreciate each and every one of you here and and that we thoroughly thoroughly enjoyed our time together with you all and if you have your Bibles tonight we want to go to the word The Book of Matthew the 12th chapter we want to turn to Matthew 12 and I didn't quite get finished this morning so if the Lord will help us maybe we just pick it up and move a little further in our study here on this uh forgotten be attitude and when I started on it I didn't expect to be preaching three parts but here here where he is hey man and so we want tonight maybe just take another portion here with you and just before we read the word let's just buy our hearts together and let's just ask the Lord to come and speak to us tonight Heavenly Father Lord as your spirit has moved throughout this meeting tonight oh God Lord as your Grace has come and power and demonstration father we believe that you're here we believe that you're real and Lord we believe that you're the on-time God we believe you're in time every time and Lord as we've come here this evening we're asking your mercy and Grace Lord to bestow upon your children once again father you see those that are here tonight you know the needs the situations Lord you know the circumstances the problems Lord the things that we're facing you know all things Lord and father we trust you we trust you with our lives we trust you with our our families with our homes with our future oh God or we've come here tonight to do one thing and that is to fellowship with you and Lord because your word has come open in this hour we can fellowship with you in the promises of your word now Lord may you come among us tonight may you give us Liberty to deliver the things that's upon our heart and Lord may you not just anoint me to speak but may you anoint the people to pull in order to open up the gift that Lord they could be benefited father Lord for the gift is not placed there for the man it's placed there for the people and Lord we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it's in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we do pray and all the Believers says a man amen Matthew the 12th chapter and the 42nd verse I don't know brother Judith it'd be possible to give me a little bit of highs in this microphone I got a lot of loaves in it Matthew 12 and verse 42. Matthew 12 and 42. Jesus you're speaking he says the queen of the South shall rise up in the Judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon now those of you that studied this know that she had heard that there was a god a living God and she was tired of the Dead tradition so she left the tradition to go find the Living God and she got there and it says and she heard the wisdom of Solomon but I want to speak here from this last portion of this scripture says and behold a greater than Solomon is here amen Behold a greater than Solomon is here and if we'll ask the Lord to add His blessings you can be seated tonight that's good there where you've got it that'll be good thank you buddy amen we want to tonight maybe by the help of the Lord just to continue here on this thought and maybe speaking to you he is right on schedule how many beliefs he's right on schedule amen and tonight I want to maybe take another portion of this and maybe say it like this your faith and his presence amen your faith and his presence we were speaking this morning on the time of trouble is the time of his presence and how that whenever trouble sets in that's not the time to forget who you are to forget the god you're serving but that's the time to remember without the trouble you would not know his presence so in the time of trouble he is a very present help in the time of trouble now we found that the word schedule there actually means to arrange or to plan an event to take place at a particular time and we found that our God as we've already said he is in on time end time every time God now in the message the Forgotten beatitude brother Brahm says it like this he said when troubles it in Jesus come and showed the Messiah that he was the Messiah he said but then something went wrong and John had introduced the Messiah with a fan in his hand he was going to burn up the chaff but he found out that the works of Jesus he was meek and lowly so it worried him he didn't know what to say and he thought now there's something wrong here somewhere he said it seemed that he had believed the wrong thing it seemed like it wasn't working right and there's many times that we think that too see it isn't working right but it is working right how many can agree it is working right as long he said it's working right as long as we know amen that he is here then what difference does it make as long as we know that he is here then what difference does it make it's working right maybe it isn't working according uh to the way we think it ought to work but it's according to the way God wants it to work you know excuse me amen and I'm thankful to know tonight that he is here how many can say I'm thankful to know that he is here amen Jesus Christ the son of God he is here tonight now Daniel 12 and verse 1 we were reading it this morning he said and at that time that time stand up it's withstanding for the for the children of our people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a time even to that same time and at that time now watch this there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at the time thy people shall be delivered every one that should be found written in the book now I want you to notice here in Daniel 12 1 he's using the word time right a specific time he's saying at that time at the same time at that time in the second verse and many of them shall sleep in the dust of the earth and shall awake amen some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt now they still be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they turn many to righteousness as the Stars forever and ever but thou oat Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the End Amen for many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased so we know amen there's coming a time of trouble right there's coming a specific time and at that same time he says y'all forgive me uh he says it like this he said but even to the time of the end so now we realize amen that we have now come to the time of the end in Revelation 1 1 he said the Revelation Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto the servants the things which must certainly come to pass he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all the things that he saw in verse 3 and said blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written they're in for the time is at hand amen so there's come in a time of trouble we're in the time of trouble right amen there'll be a time of trouble such as never since a nation and we're in that time amen but now the time is at hand now Abraham picks us up in the church age book thank you brother sometimes I don't drink it so these guys don't bring it and then I need it and they bring it so amen it's it's me it's not them I think they don't want me to knock it over again I've knocked it over too many times amen but but when you look here in the church age book he said the time is at hand he said the time was not at hand previously in the wisdom and the economy of God he said this Mighty Revelation though fully known to God it could not come forth hitherto he said thus we learn immediately learn a principle that the revelation of God for each age can come in that age only and at a specific time so now we're learning a principle from God that the revelation of God for each age can come in that age and come only at a specific time he says look at the history of Israel the revelation of God to Moses came only at a specific time of history and even more specifically it came as the people Cried unto God he said Jesus himself came at the fullness of time he being the complete Revelation the godhead he said and in this age laodicea he said the revelation of God will come in its due time so amen the Revelation can only come at a specific time then it will come in its due time he said now watch it will not falter and neither will it be premature so in the Revelation comes it will not be coming too early but it will not be coming too late it'll be coming right on time see amen think on this and heed it for we are in the end time today and pick up your pen and write brother remember to receive an inspiration and he said those in the bride will do only his will no one can make them do otherwise he said they have the saith the Lord or they keep still how many can say Amen that we have thus saith the Lord or we keep still amen they will have the Sith Lord or they will keep still he said they know that it has to be God in them doing the works amen fulfilling his own word see he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry amen so now he works in and through the bride so amen there was a time coming that he 33 and a half years amen that he would he would not complete everything in those 33 and a half years but he would actually come to a Time amen that he would finish his work through his bride see she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things amen that he must do now but I love this he will now fulfill through the bride amen the work which he has left for this specific time amen so we have not arrived too early and we've not showed up too late amen we are right on time with the schedule of God Amen the prophet said I believe that we're living in the last days and I believe amen that it is a timely message that should be approached amen reverently in this day again he said the Holy Spirit led us to say last night that we are not way back behind and neither are we Advanced we're just exactly on schedule Amen in this timely message amen that we have today in the sixth full purpose of Gabriel he said the end times shall reveal it the last Church age right amen he said the mystery the things that the church world has batted their eyes had and says it's nonsense the mystery of who Jesus Christ was he was not a third person he was not the second person not the third person but he was the person of God see all these other mysteries of God will be revealed amen because it's wrote here in this book and will be revealed to the end time generation so the revelation of the word is coming at a specific time in due time to a bride who will be will be the finishing part of the ministry of Jesus Christ amen and it will be revealed in the end time generation they can no more see it in seminaries and schools in the nomination amen then the Jews could see Jesus being the Messiah he said no wonder they try to think you're crazy no wonder they think you're foolish no wonder they can't understand why you don't cluck up with them amen see because there's a power and a vision behind it it's a word of God that's been revealed to get the church in order for the Rapture amen and the going home so the next thing on the schedule for the church is the rapture and the going home the next thing amen is the changing of your body right after Abraham amen and Sarah received the message the next thing was a change Amen to receive the promised son and I believe here tonight that there's a bride amen who is the part of this end time word she's a part of this end time generation and she has not come on the scene too late and she has not come on the scene too early amen she is right on time now in the in 1961 brother Ben preaches to Chicago Illinois and he preaches a series of sermons and maybe if you get time to listen to him it's the end of April 1961 and he starts those meetings off with Abraham and his seed after him then he goes into the greatest news flash in history and he goes into the godhead explained the forgotten the attitude Makai the prophet only believe getting in the spirit one of the meanest men in town amen and then he finishes it with the uncertain sound now if you go back and study those two previous sermons to the Forgotten be attitude he will preach Abraham and his seat after him and then he'll preach the greatest news flash in history and what he's doing there is he's turning corners or showing you the Junctions he's showing you amen he says in forgotten beatitude is this okay amen he says in the forgotten the attitude he said we found out that every Junction he'd taken Abraham he took his seat so whatever he done to Abraham he did do his seed through justification through sanctification through the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen through the placing of a son he said and then God came in human flesh and turned his back to Sarah's tent and told what she was thinking in her heart he said now don't get scared he's right on schedule he's here amen don't be offended in him amen blessed are they who's not offended in me if he was here to speak tonight he would say the same thing he's right on schedule see the prophet said there'll be a time it'll not be day or night but in the evening time it shall be light we can say this day this scripture is fulfilled right in the evening time it shall be light amen he's right on schedule he said he's done come through justification Luther age amen sanctification Wesley H Pentecostal age then placed his gifts in the church and now has appeared somebody say appeared amen he's now appeared to us in our flesh amen as Jesus said he would so in other words amen there were two events on his schedule and that was his appearing and his coming see this evening church we're not looking for his appearing we are living in the hour of his appearing so what we are looking for is just coming he said so don't be offended in him he's right on time he said John get out of that jail get out of that organization amen don't believe in these things pull the Fetters back off your eyes you are a free man if you believe it see he's right on time it shall be light in the evening time now when brother bam tells this he goes in in the Forgotten be attitude and he actually stops and tells the testimony very powerful he says there was a lady come down the other day from his hind City speaking of Zion Illinois and he said when she come down she had a little baby he said and it was born with a foot and he said that foot was hanging up like this he said he couldn't get his foot down so she said if I can only see brother Brandon put his hands on the baby amen that foot will drop down he said why she brought it shoes to wear home and everything yes sir so when she's coming brother Shema she's coming with faith amen that when brother Branham touches that baby the baby's instantly going to be healed and he's actually going to wear the shoes home that she's carrying with him he said so I was praying that but the Tabernacle preaching there and he said we were going to have foot washing and communion my son come in and said dad there's people here from Zion said they was expecting to have prayer for the sick tonight he said well they got a little baby that woman believes if you ever pray for that baby he amen that that little leg would drop down see it's got a bad leg I said bring it here and the little beautiful mother she'd come up and said my baby brother Branham we have believed husband and I when you lay your hands on this baby that the leg is going to come straight see it's going to be all right I said do you require me to find a vision from the Lord see she believes the leg is going to come straight but do you require me to find a vision from the Lord she said no sir just lay your hands on on her I said all right I'll do that so I laid my hands upon it prayed for it and went on in the room he said next day I was in the office and somebody come running here and she said brother Branham said something has went wrong so here they come back the next day amen and said something has went wrong now that's the same words amen that John was using when he was in the jail he was saying something has gone wrong something has changed amen he said something has went wrong I said what do you mean she said well the baby's leg is not down yet I said well what's that got to do with it amen she said well I believe brother Brandon if you lay your hands on my baby God would heal it said I believed it and said something went wrong somewhere she said maybe you better have a vision for it amen so yesterday she didn't need a vision amen but today she needs a vision what changed amen what changed between yesterday and today he said no no there's nothing wrong no not a thing wrong the only thing wrong is you oh my amen there was nothing wrong with the prayer there was nothing wrong with the Lord there was nothing wrong with his word there was nothing wrong with his Prophet amen the thing that was wrong was her he said see I said you just believe it she said well one thing I asked brother Branham amen do you think it's God's will for my baby to be crippled I said I do not believe it's God's will she said that's all I wanted you to save out of there she went in a few days they called up and now the baby's leg is back to normal see amen we just get frustrated amen everything's running all right it's running according to the time well somebody shout amen or hallelujah or something amen everything is running right according amen yesterday she didn't need a vision amen but today she needs a vision amen it wasn't that she needed a vision what she needed was to see a manifestation amen of the faith that was in her heart and when she did not see it as fast as she thought she should have seen it amen then all of a sudden she needed a vision amen but the prophet said no he was just as good then as he is right now he had a specific time that the baby's leg was going to come normal then comes from the following service he's hoping the sermon and he said now the sister from Zion there with a little baby see what God did for one of those drawed up plagues you see what he does for years he's still God Amen he's right on schedule he said now here's where I want to preach to you for a few moments this afternoon the only thing for us to do amen is just schedule our faith with his being here and it'll happen amen the only thing for us to do is to schedule our faith with his being here and it will happen you say his being here yes because God has always been here in some form in the message Hebrews chapter 7 part 1 he said God has always been on the earth God has never left the Earth see if he'd ever leave the earth I don't want to be no more of it amen because God has always been here in some form if the children of Israel in the wilderness coming out of Egypt he was in the form of a light he spoke to Abraham in the form of a man he spoke to Moses in the form of a man amen he spoke to the church in the form of a man and that was his son Christ Jesus and he is speaking to his church today Amen to the anointed Church of the Living God Amen to the vessels of clay see God is still speaking amen and the world sees Jesus as you present him see your life tells what you are so this evening friends we believe amen the report of the Lord that he promised Amen to be with us but we've got to figure out what form that he promised to be with us in amen and the form that he promised to be with the sin is the form of the Holy Spirit he said see we know that he promised to be with us in the form of the holy spirit amen come to the end of the world Amen to the End of the Age so from the beginning to the end he has promised to be with his church he has promised to bless his church he has promised to provide for his church amen that you can only receive the blessings and the provisions when you can identify the form that he's in when he is giving out the blessings and the provision look if you're looking for a blessing and a provision amen from a natural Ark today you're not going to find it because that's not the form he promised to be here in today if you're looking for the provisions and the blessings amen by taking the literal blood of the Lamb putting it on your door you're not going to receive the benefit and the blessing of the token because that's not the form that he promised to be here today but he did promise to be here in some form because he always appears in some form now in The Book of Mark 16 the ninth chapter 16 chapter and the ninth verse the Bible said when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to marry Magdalena out of whom he cast Seven Devils and she went and told them that he had been with him as they mourned and wept and they when they heard that he was alive and seen her seen of her believe not after then he appeared in another form somebody say he appeared in another form he appeared in another form amen unto the two that of them as they walked and went into the country and they went and told it unto the residue and neither believe they them so here he appears in one form in verse 9 then in verse 12 it says he appears in another form in Philippians 2 and verse 5 Paul said let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus amen who being in the form of God Amen thought it not robbery to be equal with God Amen but made himself of no reputation took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of them and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death amen even the death of the Cross amen wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven of things in Earth and things under the Earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the father now see he appeared Amen in the form of God he then appeared in the form of a servant and the Bible says that word form is the form by which a person or faint strikes the vision it is the external appearance so when one time you've seen him you've seen him in the form of God when you look in John 1 14 you see him in the form of a servant right because he come emptied himself out amen and took on the form of a servant in Colossians 1 15. he said who is the image of the invisible God Amen is the firstborn of every creature now we believe here tonight that the Jehovah of the old is the Jesus of the new how many agrees amen that the Jehovah of the old is the Jesus of the new so when you sing Jehovah you were seeing a pre-figure of the form of Jesus and when you saw Jesus you were seen amen the form of Jehovah amen because all that was in God he poured into Christ and all that was in Christ is poured into the church amen so when you see this word a amen form it means in more faith which means the Unseen was made visible amen when you seen the form you were seeing the Unseen made visible amen we know it's there but it cannot be seen but yet we know that it's there amen and when he changed his form of the amorphy which mean that he changed from Supernatural to Natural now watch a prophet break it down he just changed his mask in other words it's like a drama he was acting and in the Greek when they would change their Mass maybe one play one player might have acted in several different parts amen so we find them that God never changes his nature he only changes his form he said it was God formed in a man called a prophet and the word of the Lord came to this man so it wasn't the prophet no the prophet was the veil but the Word was God Amen the man's word won't act like that do you see what I mean it cannot act in that manner but potentially it was God see he was the word of God in the form of a man called man notice he never changed his nature only his form he's the same yesterday today and forever so he did not change his nature when he come he's always that Prophet down to the age same thing the word the word the word the words he he cannot change his nature but he changed his form he just changed his mask only thing he done now watch this he said only thing he done was change his mask he said he went from Noah to Moses he went from Moses to David he went from David to Joseph on down until he come into the fullness of the godhead Molly so the presence of God was in Moses the presence of God was in Noah the presence of God was in David the presence of God was in Joseph the presence of God was in Paul amen the presence of God was in those men amen but it did not take on a form that we actually called God until it came into a man called Jesus and then we seen the fullness of the godhead bodily Amen dwelt in the man Christ Jesus it's the same God he said until finally

this is not John's time amen don't get mad at me it's not even brother Brandon's time it's your time amen it's your season amen it's your anointing amen it's your hour to rise God damn in the den of high class he said find you a Bible character and identify yourself with him and he said whatever they done you believe you're going to do well if you're at the Red Sea identify yourself of Israel amen speak the word and go forward if you're in the line stand identify yourself with Daniel and believe that God has heard your prayer and he's going to change the outcome if you're in the fiery furnace amen then identify yourself with the three Hebrew children and believe that he still walks in the middle of the fire and that he's still the fourth man that will show up and stand the Flames among if you're bound amen remember he's still our Paul and Peter when they was in prison amen the angel of the Lord come to the prison and release them from the bonds of the prison you know why because he's here and he's here in word form he's here in Brad form he's hearing the form of Deliverance to deliver his church in the age we're living listen Our God's power is not weakened it's the same power it's the same thing it's the same word he said that same word sucked up through these and come out here come to a head here and all the life that come through here picked up its people it's now forming up into a head for the Rapture well Glory you're in the age of the full life everything that was in the stalk is in the seed everything that was in this hassle is in the seed everything that was in the shut stage is in the scene then where are we at tonight Church the seed has come back to seed see and brother remember said the prayer line I love it when he's when he stops in these prayer lines he said now I believe this lady sitting here amen I do not know you lady do I I've never seen you as far as I know amen we're a perfect stranger now let me just stop here and say this let me back up a second amen this Revelation could not come forth in due time until the people who was ordained to receive the Revelation was on the scene to receive it do you know why it wasn't released and Noah's day it's because you were not in Noah's day to receive it Noah was not ordained to hear what you're hearing come on church amen you know I was not given in the days of Paul amen is because Paul's day was not your day it was not you were not there the seed can only receive the word in the age at the promise of the word is coming for that seed then there's a seed for every age do you know why they could receive justification because there was a seed there the schedule had the seat there to receive the justification you know why they can read say sanctification because the seed was there to receive the revelation of sanctification do you know why not 1006 they could receive on Azusa the restoration the gifts amen because the seed was there to receive the outpouring of the spirit but do you know why that you can say things amen that the lutherans couldn't say and the Westlands couldn't say and the Pentecostals cannot say it's because you are a word seed you are a spoken word literal seat bride to receive the word of power to change your body listen friends it's time to quit letting every little trouble and every little situation get us so low that we're ready to throw up our hands and quit it's time to remember friends were not that far away from the Finish Line we're not that far away the life is in the body the seed has come to the hand well Glory he's got his word here you're here amen any day now the body change could take place you know why we can preach raps for any moment it's because the power to change our body is here and the bodies that need to be changed are here do you know why we can say Amen that any minute gray hair turn back back again because gray hair is here and the power to turn it back to being black is here do you know why we can say that Miss and limbs limbs was told hey Adams are here I heard and to restore the missing limb has returned to the church what is it princessly hour when God has brought your faith Amen in the presence of his being and there's a change taking place among you're not too late and you're not too far behind you're at the right spot at the right time with the right message under the right anointing listen amen it's time to change yeah the promising in that prayer line he said well I don't know you were strangers he said probably hundreds of miles down here probably he said then we come down here to talk to you why he said raised up in Indiana down here in Florida he said well then when we come together to talk one another he said we've been miles apart but God knowed you since before you was born God knows you since before you was born and he knowed me since before I was born come on Church he's going back into Bloodlines and saying God knows you and God knowed me before he was ever even born now don't think I'm crazy but can I preach for a second and it's time he had a schedule that the prophet with me fat woman well glory to God he had a time he had a schedule that a prophet would be there and she would be there he said you're from in Florida I'm up in Indiana he said we've been knowing god since before he was born he snowed us he said now I believe you're a Christian because your spirit seems to be welcome when a Christian comes there's just something that just says welcome you see and I get that right away it's the Holy Spirit he said but now if me knowing nothing of you and miles apart of your life he said the Holy Spirit would have to do something that would make you know that the presence of his being is here amen if I have not known you for all these years and you have not known me for all of these years then in order for there to be a for there to be a manifestation to take place amen the holy spirit is going to have to do something Amen to let you know amen that the presence of his being is here in other words he's going to have to do something brother Terry to get your eyes off of me and realize it's not me but it's the son of man it's the revealing of Jesus Christ it's the presence of the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart of a man is on this platform he said then it would make you have more confidence than I told you the truth amen so when you recognize you as in the presence of his being it was a confidence that the prophet was telling you the truth why are you preaching about this presence amen because the presence of the Lord amen gives Faith amen the presence in the presence of the Lord there is fullness of joy in the presence of the Lord Brother Bob there is faith in the presence of the Lord there is healing in the presence of the Lord there is Joy what do you saying preacher I'm saying if there's ever been a time for somebody to declare amen the presence of Jesus Christ they've been hours a time to do it now is the time to say he is here the Holy Spirit he says moves out on the building speaks to whomever he will speak he said see they meant amen that Sovereign right then God brings the knowledge because it's a promise of God he said watch and the knowledge of God knowledge of God he said Sovereign also brings his presence down Among Us amen so when you have a knowledge you're in his presence it's a sovereign God he brings his presence down Among Us he said we should see it and rejoice you say well I was crippled in my hand I was there last night I didn't get any better that don't have nothing to do with it see amen tonight amen to you it's already finished amen you're not looking at your hand man you're looking at a promise and therefore you can't say well brother so and so didn't pray the prayer of faith or so and so see it's the presence of the Lord gave you Faith you see it then then he sent his word and he healed them the presence of the Lord is the giving of faith I love what he says in a true sound overlooked he said together thy servant and the servant bring him the word he said together we might be brought Amen to a closer realization of his appearing than ever before in our life in second Timothy 1 9 he said but it's 110 rather but it's now made manifest by what the appearing of Our Savior Jesus Christ who hath abolished death and brought life and immortality to lie to the gospel the Bible speaks of his appearing you know what his appearing is his appearing is different than his coming the proud of God said now there's a great big difference in the sign of Jesus appearing and then Jesus coming there's two different words see the appearing of the Lord and the coming of the Lord he said now the appearing of the Lord is now the appearing of the Lord is now when he is appearing in his people his Spirit working among them proven that it's him with him amen getting them ready for the Rapture his appearing is the preparing of the church for the Rapture amen it's for the catching away the coming of the Lord he said it's the appearing and then the coming from that time 62 Spokane Washington he said now's the appearing the coming will be soon amen the appearing is now he's appearing in the midst of us doing the works that he once did in his church he said now you're a part of the church by Grace you believe now watch a prophetic announcement amen my Ministry is different remember he said this is my Ministry see to declare him that he is here this is my Ministry to declare him that he is here in other words amen he's here and if he's here he's not leaving come on when brother Brown went off the scene he didn't go with him he's still here amen you say he's here amen he's here his own personal presence amen his being is here what did Brother remember saying that quote he said you just got to schedule your faith with his being here amen and then something's going to happen amen your how many's got faith tonight amen how many has got faith amen how many can says my faith is here my faith is here my faith is in this building tonight well let me say this you're in a good place for a miracle you're in a good place for an answer you're in a good place for a living because wherever your faith is if his being is there amen then there's a miracle fixing to take place amen if you can only see amen that he is here his being is here remember I'm sitting right here in the presence of Jesus Christ right here where he's moving he's working infallible proofs of his being here here it is every way can be proven he's here the next thing you'll see of him will be his Corporal body coming in glory then he that's filthiest filthy still and he that is righteous is righteous still and he that's holy is Holy still amen the time will be over come on Church we're on a schedule amen the time will be over listen right now Mercy is still available right now Grace is still extendable amen but there's a Time coming when he that's filthy is going to stay filthy and even his holy is going to stay holy old church amen won't you release your faith in the presence of God and let him change you if you're filthy let him change you to be in holy amen if you're confused let him change you to being peaceful amen because this is the hour amen that time is running out but while time is still available we should take advantage of it but time will be over on God's schedule this gospel is going to go back to the Jews oh God's schedule the end this coming listen friends I don't want to scare you and I want to make you upset but I'm going to preach to you for a second there's going to be a time we're going to have the last meeting there's going to be a time you're going to have the final service I'm going to there's going to I'm not a crazy man I'm telling you the truth but time is coming where you're going to plan for something and it ain't going to happen hey come on right now we're planning the meetings planning things amen but do you realize they're all subject to one thing and that is God's schedule amen it is God's time it is when God is ready to say it's over it's finished amen I'm bringing my bride home and I'm taking the gospel to Israel now you say brother Andrew we I don't know I maybe just slow down here and say this sometimes I think we get in our mind that things will always be the way they are I like sometimes we get in our minds well it's Sunday night amen so if I don't really put much in this service well I guess I'll get wished that and I'll try again but who promised you wins tonight well it's Sunday night sweet might as well preach handling are you hearing me amen what if a preacher what if a preacher approached the service like some people approach the way they pull well I'm also preach amen what if a preacher gonna say well you know tonight it's just Sunday night so I ain't gonna put too much in this maybe maybe I'll say something to him Wednesday do you realize this might be the last sermon I ever preach it might be the last sermon you ever hear since when did we start giving half-hearted sermons and half-hearted Services I tell you what that ought to be a thing of the past we don't know what the next five minutes holds but while God has given us time we ought to make due use of the time that God come on you may not have another time to say Amen but God right now has given you a chance to say Amen you might not have another time Amen to stand up on your feet and let the devil know whose side you're on but right now right here God is giving you another opportunity Amen to identify whose side you may never have another time Amen to clap your hands but right here right now God is giving you another opportunity to bless his name and to worship His presence you know what I think we're going to do I think we ought to kick this old formal devil back to the hell that it come out of and remember this is our service these are our meetings these are our times this is our time to enjoy the presence of God oh I know what I'm bumping against I'm bumping against devil right now that don't want to let God's people free Amen to

go Amen Let bitterness cold amen well I don't like this and I think amen let all that nonsense go and remember that God is in the midst of his church and he's here I just go ahead and say I think we've argued Fest about how cold it is how hot it is how soft the pews are how ugly the carpet is how quiet it is how I think we've argued about that long enough I think it's time to have church don't you how many degrees it's time to have church I think it's time to forget what setting the thermostat's on it's time to forget who's here not here who thinks it I think it's time to just get together and enjoy ourselves from the house I go well I know some of y'all think I'm crazy amen but I remember when we used to go to church sister Jane and we had church amen we enjoyed church we didn't sit there all wadded up because somebody didn't do what we thought we ought to do or somebody didn't sing our favorite song Amen brother Bob I remember it didn't take all night preaching to get me on my

church I thank God for this message come on I'm enjoying the time to enjoy what God has given me because the time will soon be over yeah it's going to end one of these days it's going to end so don't get in your mind that things are always going to be like this well covet showed it sad I mean one day brother Kevin you go down to McDonald's next day you had to go into the mask and rubber gloves and hazmat suit and oxygen tank just to get a cheap cheeseburger that they made wrong yeah I know what I'm talking about somebody told me today when you go through Chick-fil-A you don't check the bag that's the Lord's chicken so if it's not right it's what God wanted you to have I thought that's not funny Mariah going somewhere we went through Chick-fil-A and she got her order and it was wrong I said that's God's will for you honey it's what God wanted you to have are you hearing me why not enjoy the blessing we don't know when they're gonna we don't know the election's on the horizon coven might show back up in a few more days I mean you don't know it's the time to enjoy remember I said Don't You Ever Lose Your Enthusiasm don't you ever lose the joy of yourself and the very minute you feeling slipping away that's the minute to start fighting to get it back the very minute you feel that coldness coming on you brother Sean that's the time to start fighting and saying oh no devil I will not become lukewarm brother shalom I will not lose the things that God has done for me I I'll prepare I'll fight him in the prayers I'll fight him in the third culture I'll find him in my office but I will not let the devil rob me of the blessing to the bride time of the age I'm living in it's the time that God has been waiting for Brother Matthew God has been waiting for this time he's been waiting for the time to get perfect faith in his word back in his perfect presence and watch something take place yeah the part of God said each night the holy spirit is trying to get you to the presence of his being here not the presence of a man he said see a man can only humble himself by gifts he can submit himself into a certain Realm of the spirit that can open God to you but it will never work until you yourself believe it and accept it and then it works see he said now watch see it's your faith so it takes you and I together with the Holy Spirit to bring these things to pass to let me Rejoice to let you rejoice that God is here and that he keeps his word this is the time for you to rejoice and for me to Rejoice that God is here and he keeps his word see then what is this time Amen brother brother Terry this is the time of the meeting of two omnipotent it's when two omnipotents are meeting the part of God so when when God and a Believer meet there's two omnipotents the patmosphere and I was going to choke it but I'm going to say it amen man is omnipotent you don't believe that but he is a man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent so he did not he say in Mark 11 22 whatsoever things you say and you don't doubt in your heart it'll come to pass you can have what you have said what happens then when two omnipotents meet when God and man comes together he said two omnipotents something's got to shake whatsoever you say with that creative power of omnipotence of God Amen knowing that he's promised it and he said it in his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings the thing to pass things that it's not it makes them as though they are because two omnipotents have met things that is not makes it as though they are because two omnipotents have man there he stands oh my isn't he wonderful in John chapter 11 the Bible said that Jesus's friend Lazarus died right amen and they wished he would have come at a certain time amen but now watch Lazarus was led in the grave for four days and the prophet says first thing you know Little Martha come running out there she said Lord amen see she told him he was Lord Lord if I would have been here my brother would not have died she said now even now whatsoever you have asked God God will give it to you he said nothing uncertain about that amen that's when two positives meet when two positives meet amen see that's when two omnipotents meet amen when one omnipotence she had amen perfect omnipotent faith in Christ and Christ was omnipotent see she had perfect infinite faith in Christ that he was is the Lord and knowed whatsoever he asked God Amen God would give it to him amen she knew whatever the Lord asked whatever he asked God for God would give it to him in other words she said you just speak the word that's all you have to do and whatever you ask God God will give it to you he said that's omnipotent all-powerful amen because he just said so see all right and he was all-powerful that's when two Powers two omnipotent Powers meets together he said then it's a contact amen so when you get one omnipotent contact Brother Samaya meeting with another omnipotent contact amen then something has got to change amen something has got to shake he said when a line has got 150 votes this way and got 150 votes that way and they come together he said you got a hundred and fifty votes going both ways he said see and when you got supreme power anybody want to preach with me tonight say these words supreme power when you got supreme power when Jesus said lay hands on the sick they shall recover and you got supreme Faith somebody say Supreme Faith supreme power and supreme faith in that being the truth then you need a supreme god somebody say supreme god that made a supreme promise Supreme promise and a supreme result will come amen that's it see when you have a supreme power connects with the Supreme faith that meets a supreme god under a supreme promise you will see a supreme result that's a preaching quote right there brother Terry when you see a supreme god where the supreme power and you've got supreme faith and you meet a supreme promise there's going to be a supreme result come on church do you know why that baby's leg dropped is because the faith amen met the presence of God and when the faith met the presence of God it brought a change in the life of that baby are y'all hearing me in other words it doesn't do no good if the faith is there and the presence is not it does no good if the presence is there and the faith is not come on call it to you the other day Faith will be slow in the last days amen but you gotta fight for your faith you're going to fight to keep your faith elevated amen above the reasonings above the unbelief you've got to fight to keep your face the preeminence of your life are you hearing me amen a supreme Faith amen I just think back to this the other day amen if you're trying to get something done amen it's like it's like you got okay it's like you got a job to do amen but you ain't got for tools to do it with Amen to your gospel worker there amen but you don't have the tools oh you get the tools there and you don't have the worker I remember last year or year before last sometime when I was down there helping uh brother Wayne and brother Josh on the dirt work down there his new church but Josh's new church everyone said they there Amen brother Wayne was out there pushing the Dozer and there was a bunch of nerve to move I mean tons of her well they had a little Dozier down there wasn't getting hardly no dirt moved he said I need a bigger Dozier well they're standing there and the guy said well we'll bring it tomorrow he said well I'm leaving tomorrow he said that's okay we'll bring it in here he said no I'm leaving tomorrow I will not be here I will I will not be here it does no good to bring it well well we've got a schedule for delivery tomorrow he said what we need it today I said well really he said yeah he said if I leave tomorrow that those are going to sit here till I get back I got to thinking about that you can have an operator and if you ever seen brother Wayne run a Dozier he's a phenomenal dose rapper you can have a great Dozer offering but if you ain't got the machine there that dirt ain't gonna move you can have an awesome brand new D9 Dozier sitting there but if you ain't got the operator amen the dirt ain't gonna move but if you can ever schedule a the operator to be there with the machine amen something's fishing the move and I want to tell that Devon closing tonight amen that this church is a church that believes in the presence of Jesus Christ and our faith is the Supreme Faith therefore devils are fishing to move out of here sicknesses are Fists in the back often you say how can you say that because the operator is in the building amen you're Faith listen his presence is here your faith is here let's move that devil back to hell where he comes from there's a power to do it there's a dynamic to do it listen amen you get this ride somewhere where his presence is not you ain't going to see much of a meeting you get depression somewhere where his bride is not you ain't going to see much of a meeting but if you can ever bring his presence and the bride together under the same Dynamic atmosphere you're going to see Miracles you're going to see things take place that will amen they will they will pursue the minds of doctors because you're going for Faith and the present scheduled and they're there at the same time are you hearing me amen amen when they're scheduled together there at the same time Amen Let me let me bring it a little bit y'all forgive me y'all know I just got simple simple illustrations I knew when we were when I still live in West Virginia I was doing a I'm trying to get this across in the simple way I know how I mean when I was in West Virginia I got an office there and I bought a storage shed I was going to turn into an office you know and so I went down there bought the office and I said now listen I need it delivered on this certain day in May she said we can't deliver it now I said well you got to she said well we don't have time delivered that day said our schedule's full I said but ma'am I needed her that day she said why do you need it there so bad I said because I've got brother

do well thank God we got it there but I tell you this it was another impossible situation Jonathan could have come but if the building was not there he wasted his time amen if a bill was there and Jonathan wasn't there we weren't getting nothing come on Church yeah we got we got to get the face of God in the presence of God Amen are you hearing me now we got it we got to get it together y'all know what I'm talking about amen those are simple illustrations but what about in this service tonight amen there's a miracle in this room but do you know what's going to bring that Miracle into your body is when you release your faith and recognize the presence of this being here come on Church you know what I'm talking about amen you feel the presence of God and the promise said the only thing that will release the presence of God is your faith now listen God works on a time schedule my God is not a god of confusion come on he's a god he's a God that works thank is exactly right now I said to you like this to show you inclusion the the illustration I'm trying to make to you somebody say your faith say my faith his presence my faith yes presence schedule together my faith his presence scheduled together at the right time something's going to shake well somebody put a praise on that one I ain't used that term in a long time amen amen come on Church your faith his presence something's going to shake if you can just get your presence in the his presence in your faith it's going to happen remember tells you it's in 1950 he said how many beliefs in being led by the spirit he said a few days ago in the Fort Wayne meetings he said down to the left I stopped in front of the place called Miller's cafeteria he said I wondered why but something said go in there so he's walking down the road in Indiana and he looks up in there brother to him he sees Miller's cafeteria something says go in there he said I went in there got some breakfast and prunes and so forth my wife come in said she sat down said Billy you're going to be trapped in here and I started eating as I asked the blessing now watch a prophet he said as I ask the blessing I heard somebody say praise the Lord just I this is so real to me just a few minutes ago brother Terry he wasn't even in the building but when he saw Miller's cafeteria the voice said go in there he went in there brother Sean got his breakfast bowed his head and prayed and heard somebody say praise the Lord he said I looked over and a poor old mother was raising up and she was wiping her eyes Margie said you better go said if you don't the whole group I said just a moment it's the Holy Spirit leading she come over there and said brother Bynum I followed your meeting after meeting trying to get my brother in the line I couldn't do it said his heart's got so bad now it's pushed through the diaphragm so we was examined a few days ago before coming and the doctor said he just has a little while to live and brother man we sold our cow to get the money to come up here from Texas said I've been to several meetings we all we got said I seen I couldn't get it there's too many there I've added several prayer cards but the numbers never been called she said but I was praying last night and all of a sudden I was praying and fasting and about daylight this morning I woke up and I had a dream and I dreamed that I should come down here to the cafeteria and wait at nine o'clock I hear at the cusp the cafeteria at nine o'clock he said I looked at my watch and it was exactly nine o'clock it was not 8 59 and it was not 903 he said it was exactly nine o'clock he said bring him here you know what happened don't you the Lord marvisly healed him amen it was the lead of this come on church amen amen they sold their cow they did all kinds of things they weren't even in a certain in a church service brother Judah they was not in a prayer line they was in Miller's cafeteria but wherever this bride is because he's here in Bride form wherever this bride is his presence is there and in the middle of Miller's cafeteria the same presence Brother Sam that would have been on the platform was in The Miller's cafeteria and at nine o'clock that boy's heart went back to where it went wrong come on church amen she was not too early and she was not too late she was right on time she had her face where her face needed to be and God had his Prophet or his Prophet needed to be and her faith met the presence of God and gonna heal him for her brother oh he said I see the Lord he works on both ends can I read you the next part he said then going out the door we was just leaving so we went out the door about two minutes after amen about two minutes after two minutes after okay nine o'clock we'll say 902 right fair enough two minutes after didn't eat and a young lady standing there fell down on the street and began screaming just as I went out the door dressed in black she lived in Chicago Heights she had malignant cancer she said brother random I've been praying for weeks and I could get here said I just got a little while she'd been to Clinic here nothing could be done her husband was a great businessman there's some sort you know what she said she said this morning early said something told me brother Samaya something told me to go to Miller's cafeteria and stand here at 10 minutes after nine come on turn you can't make this stuff up you go to Miller's cafeteria go in and get you some breakfast at nine o'clock a woman gets her brother's healing at two minutes after he walks outside meets a woman from Chicago amen at nine at ten minutes after nine he said there it was he said I met her in Little Rock here a few weeks ago and she's still just a shout in the Praises of God she is perfectly normal and well he said see what is it is where God and the believer meets together on the Common Grounds of faith what do you saying preacher I'm saying you don't have to go to Fort Wayne to touch him you don't have to go to Tucson to touch him the product of God said like this he said it's not me it's him and he's here he's in this building how many preachers we got here tonight can I see your hands men of God do you know what the prophet said he said your commission is to declare to the people his presence is here your commission from the throne is to declare to the people that the presence of God is here now I want to say this brother Sean we thank you for hanging this picture up in the church I think we ought to give the man of God a hand clap and pray I know you probably got criticism but we thank you for hanging that picture in the church I preached in churches and spent 10 minutes looking for the picture and finally had to dig out of my Bible because they didn't have one now that's every church is Sovereign but I'm thankful to be identified with the church that still hangs the picture up you know what when I look at that picture brother Shema you know what I see I don't see just brother Branham I see his presence how many can see that picture right now if you can see that picture if your faith will allow your vision to see you will see more than William Mary and Bradham you will see more than a blue tie you will see more than a white shirt you will see more than a picture you will see the presence of the almighty God Amen the high priest himself amen veiled in the form of a light above a prophet's head he said how many of you got the picture here he said now that same being somebody said that same being that scientific world is recognized to be supernatural being at the day of the Judgment when I will stand before every one of you it isn't standing three feet from where I am right now whatever is in the picture has come into the church whatever is in that picture Sister Kim has come into this church he said now it hasn't come into me yet but it's standing here come on Church it hasn't come into me yet but it's standing here he said and it will perhaps in a few moments it's the one who does the Discerning so if that Pillar of Fire just stayed in the picture and did not come into the prophet there would have been no discernment but the very minute that Pillar of Fire amen changed forms it changed from a period in the form of a picture to appeared in the flesh of the seventh angel he said now he's here and we say thanks be to the Lord let's entertain his presence he said now that he's here you can touch him now that he's here you can touch him now that his presence is here and your faith is here sister Rebecca you can touch him right now you can touch him for your children you can touch him for your family come on church you can touch him for your needs he's here now his presence his being is in this building he said now if he Remains the Same high priest like the Bible said we can touch him he said like the woman did touch His Garment your faith can touch him that are you ready for this he'll act the same way yeah can I say it did like this he'll act the same way here tonight like he did in Fort Wayne Indiana he'll act the same way he did here tonight he did in Jeffersonville can we go a little bit further he'll act the same way here tonight like he did at the woman at the well he'll act the same way here tonight he says in flesh human flesh like he did when he was in human flesh there at Abraham's Oak your faith scheduled to be here at the same time his presence is can I say it to you tonight in closing Church you have a Divine appointment with his presence what I I wish I was a preacher right now to get this to you the way I'm seeing it what if you could see that these Services were more than just services what if you could see they are Divine appointments and the Bible said Jesus keeps all of his appointments come on Friends you know we've scheduled a lot of appointments we didn't keep something come up we couldn't make it it's like a guy told me one time he said he told the story he said he said I was sick one time he said I called the doctor told the doctor it's time for my yearly checkup he said it was like January he said they said well that's okay he said come in and in the end of October so we'll get you in for your checkup he said the end of October he said that's nine months they said yeah he said well what if I die between now and then he said well have your wife call and cancel the appointment laughs so you make appointments and things happen you can't make them situations happen you can't be there but what if I told you he's never canceled an appointment he's never made an appointment with your faith and canceled it now I know what happens I know what happens you get the same well God ain't moved for me yet and God moved for so and so and so and so got their blessing I ain't got mine so I don't guess I'm gonna get a bus well that's a devil trying to anoint you with a spirit of unbelief you do not have to bow your knee to that devil any longer you got to write right here tonight to say I'm going to show up and I'm going to bring my faith and I'm going to release my faith and when my faith and his presence has a Divine appointment I'm going to receive my Miracle until then I'm not going to be offended I'm not going to be upset I'm just going to keep on praising God rejoice how many prayer lines do they go through brother shalom for they finally made it to Miller's cafeteria spend all their money all their time all the travel time and never got to the prayer line that the prophet of God got up one morning to go downtown and get some breakfast brother Sean and God is mindful of the needs of his children so he worked it out to get that woman right there in the building at the right time maybe he maybe maybe he got her a little bit early a little early you know and then had the Prophet come in a specific time and had him bow his head and pray maybe maybe I get to thinking sometimes you imagine maybe he'd been there you know and just walked in sit down and kind of maybe just by himself if he had been by himself sister Jane just kind of sit there and bowed his head you know silently pray to himself and raised his head up and started eating that woman would never heard him say Amen but God had it so arranged that his family was sitting there and they all got together and they prayed and when he raised his voice he said amen I hope you don't think I'm crazy I'm preaching to you God's schedule can I leave your fist tonight don't give up and don't give in don't cancel your appointment don't cancel your appointment you say preacher what do you mean don't miss church don't get so discouraged you start staying home because things ain't working keep your appointments you're on the schedule let our musicians come tonight I pray something's been said to bless you I wanna I wanna leave you at this last quote remember says wonders to perform he said if every precept of God's Eternal Word has to happen according to his time schedule don't worry Jesus will be here just on time and the church will be ready just on time and it has to happen that way schedule your faith with his being here and watch something change I got any Witnesses here tonight that says I'm a witness a scheduled Faith with a schedule the presence of God and things have changed things have changed I've seen changes take place brother

comes on the scene as it's been said when he's four days late he's never too late never too late can you say man God has proven it time and time again he doesn't move by majority he doesn't move by Talent he doesn't move by nothing [Music] and we you could look it through all throughout the Bible he would pick a uh just a farmer a man that that farmer would recognize his Covenant recognize who he was and that's little oh sham guard and he would take the mightiest 600. in the army of the philistine trained it was an impossible situation but he kept his appointment with God can you say man
