[17:52] whole. I would not be denied.
[17:57] Now, oh, Satan said, "My Lord was gone
[18:03] and would not hear." He's still saying
[18:05] that today. Oh, but praise the Lord. The
[18:10] work is done and Christ the Lord is
[18:15] here.
[18:17] Oh, I would not be denied.

[18:57] would not be denied.

[19:06] Oh, till Jesus came, he made me whole, I
[19:12] would not be. I like this verse now. Oh,
[19:17] Satan said, "My Lord was gone and would
[19:22] not hear my prayer." Oh, but praise the
[19:28] Lord, the work is done. And Christ the
[19:32] Lord, he is here.
[19:35] Oh, I would not be denied.
[19:41] I would not be denied.
[19:45] Oh, till Jesus came,
[19:48] made me whole. Oh, we're going to sing
[19:50] that first verse.
[19:53] Now,
[19:55] when pains of death seized on my soul,
[20:00] unto the Lord I cry.
[20:04] Oh, then Jesus came and he made me
[20:08] whole. I would not be denied. No,
[20:14] I would not be denied.
[20:19] No, I would not be denied.

[20:28] whole. I would not be singing again.
[20:33] No, I would not be denied.
[20:38] No, I would not be denied.
[20:43] Oh, till Jesus came and he made me

[21:45] I was lost in shame. Could not get past
[21:48] my blame. And then he called my name.
[21:53] Oh, I'm so glad he changed me. Darkness
[21:56] held me down. But Jesus pulled me out.
[22:00] I'm no longer bound. Oh, I'm so glad he
[22:04] changed me. See, I'm
[22:07] now a new creation in Christ.

[44:23] the Lord just really bless him and his
[44:26] labor of love that he has shown toward
[44:29] us here in Blackburg.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And um you can stand if you don't
[44:36] mind and we'll uh just go into the
[44:40] reading of the word. And uh first of
[44:43] all, we're going to start in Deuteronomy
[44:48] the 7th chapter
[44:52] and uh then Isaiah 43
[44:58] and um
[45:14] Deuteronomy
[45:15] chapter 7 and going to start at the I I
[45:21] let's let's start at the first verse.
[45:24] When the Lord thy God shall bring thee
[45:26] into the land whether thou goest to
[45:28] possess it, and hath cast out many
[45:31] nations before thee, the Hittites, the
[45:33] Je uh gerites,
[45:38] the Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites,
[45:41] Hivites, Jebusites,
[45:43] seven nations greater and mightier than
[45:46] thou. And when the Lord thy God shall
[45:49] deliver them before thee, thou shalt
[45:52] smite them, and utterly destroy them,
[45:56] thou shalt make no covenant with them,
[45:59] nor show mercy unto them, neither shalt
[46:02] thou make marriages with them. Thy
[46:05] daughter thou shalt not give unto his
[46:09] son, nor his daughter shalt thou take
[46:12] unto thy son. For they will turn away
[46:16] thy son from following me, that they may
[46:19] serve other gods. So will the anger of
[46:22] the Lord be kindled against you and
[46:23] destroy thee suddenly. But thus shall ye
[46:27] deal with them. You shall destroy their
[46:29] altars, break down their images, and cut
[46:32] down their groves, and burn their graven
[46:35] images with fire. For thou art an holy
[46:38] people. Everybody say, "Thou art and
[46:41] holy people unto the Lord thy God." The
[46:45] Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a
[46:48] special people unto himself above all
[46:50] people that are upon the face of the
[46:53] earth. The Lord did not set his love
[46:56] upon you, nor choose you, because you
[46:58] were more in number than any people, for
[47:00] you were the fewest of all people. But
[47:03] because the Lord loved you, and because
[47:06] he would keep the oath which he had
[47:08] sworn unto your fathers, hath the Lord
[47:10] brought you out with a mighty hand, and
[47:12] redeemed you out of the house of
[47:14] bondman, from the hand of Pharaoh, king
[47:18] of Egypt. Know therefore that the Lord
[47:20] thy God, he is God, the faithful God,
[47:23] which keepeth covenant and mercy with
[47:25] him that love him and keep his
[47:27] commandments to a thousand generations.
[47:31] Now, if you'll go Isaiah 43
[47:37] and we'll start at the first verse,
[47:41] Isaiah 43 and1.
[47:44] But now thus saith the Lord that created
[47:46] thee, oh Jacob,
[47:48] and he that formed thee, O Israel, fear
[47:50] not, for I have redeemed thee. I have
[47:53] called thee by thy name. Thou art mine.
[47:57] When thou passest through the waters, I
[47:59] will be with thee, and through the
[48:01] rivers. They shall not overflow thee.
[48:04] When thou walkest through the fire, thou
[48:06] shalt not be burned, neither shall the
[48:09] flame kindle upon thee. For I am the hol
[48:13] the Lord thy God, the holy one of Israel
[48:16] thy savior. I gave Egypt for thy ransom
[48:19] Ethiopia and Siba for thee. Since thou
[48:23] was precious in my sight. Thou hast been
[48:25] honorable and I love thee. Therefore
[48:28] will I give men for thee and people for
[48:31] thy life. Fear not, for I am with thee.
[48:34] I will bring thy seed from the east and
[48:36] gather thee from the west. I will say to
[48:39] the north, give up, and to the south,
[48:41] keep not back. Bring my sons from far,
[48:45] and my daughters from the ends of the
[48:48] earth, even everyone that is called by
[48:50] my name, for I have created him for my
[48:54] glory. I have formed him. Yay, I have
[48:58] made him. And then the 21st verse, this
[49:02] people have I formed for myself.
[49:06] They shall show forth my praise.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; Now, one more scripture. Romans 6.
[49:16] Romans 6
[49:18] and the 11th verse.
[49:23] It says, "Likewise reckon ye also
[49:26] yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin,
[49:28] but alive unto God. Therefore, or
[49:30] through Jesus Christ our Lord. Let not
[49:34] sin reign, therefore reign in your
[49:37] mortal body, that you should obey it in
[49:39] the lust thereof, neither yield ye your
[49:43] members as instruments of
[49:46] unrighteousness unto sin, but yield
[49:49] yourselves unto God, as though as those
[49:53] that are alive from the dead, and your
[49:56] members as instruments of righteousness
[49:58] unto God. For sin shall not have
[50:01] dominion over you. For you are not under
[50:04] the law, but under grace. What then
[50:06] shall we sin? Because we are not under
[50:08] the law, but under grace God forbid.
[50:12] Know ye not that to whom you yield
[50:15] yourselves servants to obey, his
[50:18] servants you are to whom you obey,
[50:21] whether of sin unto death, or of
[50:23] obedience unto righteousness. But God be
[50:26] thank that you were the servants of sin.
[50:29] But you have obeyed from the heart that
[50:31] form of doctrine which was delivered
[50:33] you. Being then made free from sin. You
[50:37] became the servants of righteousness.
[50:40] I speak after the manner of men because
[50:42] of the infirmity of your flesh. For as
[50:45] you have yielded your members servants
[50:47] to uncleanness and to iniquity unto
[50:50] iniquity, even so now yield your members
[50:54] servants to righteousness unto holiness.
[50:58] For when you were servants of sin, you
[51:01] were free from righteousness.
[51:04] What fruit had you then? In those things
[51:06] whereof you are now ashamed. See, for in
[51:10] the end of these things is death. But
[51:13] now being made free from sin. How many
[51:15] is free from sin?
[51:17] &gt;&gt; And become servants to God, you have
[51:20] your fruit unto holiness and the end
[51:23] everlasting life. For the wages of sin
[51:26] is death, but the gift of God is eternal
[51:28] life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[51:31] Let's just bow our heads as we talk to
[51:35] the author of the word. Father,
[51:40] as we have read your scriptures,
[51:43] Father, we realize the meaning,
[51:48] Lord, that it holds.
[51:51] And yet, Father, we know that the carnal
[51:55] mind can read it and yet not understand
[51:58] it. And so, we're asking, Lord, that you
[52:01] would come and that you would open the
[52:04] scriptures up to us, Father. And Lord,
[52:07] that you'd reveal what you would have
[52:10] for us, Lord, today. You see the the
[52:15] heart, my heart, Lord, and uh the things
[52:19] that I would like to convey to your
[52:21] people. And I pray Lord that you would
[52:23] just give us a freedom to do so. And
[52:27] Lord uh not only me freedom to speak,
[52:30] but the people freedom to hear and to
[52:33] receive.
[52:35] Father, may your presence just be among
[52:37] us today. Work a supernatural work
[52:40] within us. Father, we ask it. We're your
[52:44] children in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[52:49] You can have your seats this morning.
[52:55] And so
[52:58] I want to I have um
[53:02] talked on this um subject uh holiness a
[53:07] people separated unto the Lord and um
[53:11] been I guess more talking about it um
[53:15] and we've been off uh offline
[53:18] um but I I u want to speak some more
[53:22] about it today and Uh we know the word
[53:27] holy
[53:29] means separated,
[53:31] dedicated, consecrated,
[53:34] appointed.
[53:36] And so uh God called Israel to be a
[53:42] people unto him. And that was a natural
[53:45] people. And that was a people that was
[53:47] typing out us as the spiritual people.
[53:51] They were the natural seed of Abraham.
[53:53] We are the spiritual royal seed of
[53:56] Abraham through Christ. Ain't that
[53:58] right?
[54:00] &gt;&gt; As as a separated people, God separated
[54:03] them for himself. And they were the only
[54:08] people that had the braen serpent. They
[54:10] were the only people that had the
[54:12] smitten rock, the only ones that would
[54:14] have the pillar of fire, the angel of
[54:16] the covenant, uh uh the atonement. uh
[54:20] they they were the only people that had
[54:22] the supernatural among them. The
[54:25] children of Israel had their faults and
[54:28] mistakes and you know uh but but they
[54:32] were God's people and they were special
[54:35] in the eyes of God
[54:37] &gt;&gt; and that's what matters. They're special
[54:40] in the eyes of God. And so, but if God
[54:43] had not given them the angel of the
[54:46] covenant, if he had not given them the
[54:48] pillar of fire, the atonement, the
[54:50] brazen serpent, the the uh uh smitten
[54:54] rock, and if he hadn't given them all
[54:57] these things, there would have been no
[54:59] way that they could have come and
[55:02] entered into the promised land. True.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; They would have been just like any other
[55:07] nation. uh any other people that was
[55:10] weak and
[55:12] uh failures and faults and all these
[55:15] things and uh but yet God loved them and
[55:19] God provided these things to preserve
[55:21] them as they were on their journey.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Now God commanded them not to intermar
[55:28] with any other nation. uh they were not
[55:31] to mix and uh not toake of any of the
[55:36] rituals of the heathen nations were to
[55:39] keep themselves separated and undefiled.
[55:43] Amen. Because they were a holy people.
[55:46] Well, God as as God has turned from the
[55:51] Israel as a natural people to a
[55:54] spiritual people, the Gentiles, and he's
[55:57] taking out, he promised that he would
[55:59] take out of the Gentiles a people for
[56:02] his name. In other words, it would be a
[56:04] people that would make up the bride of
[56:06] Christ and that would actually become
[56:10] Miss Jesus Christ. they would bear that
[56:12] name. As we know that we have come to
[56:14] that place in this age where we're no
[56:17] longer called just church. We are called
[56:20] Miss Jesus Christ. Uh and and the reason
[56:24] why we're called that is because there
[56:27] has been an invisible union take place.
[56:31] The wedding is or the marriage wedding
[56:34] is not going to take uh place up in the
[56:37] skies or somewhere else. the marriage
[56:40] actually taking place now.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there are a people today that
[56:45] are married to the word of God.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. They're married. They're dedicated
[56:50] to that. And and so um uh uh God wants
[56:55] his church, his elect, his bride,
[56:58] separated from all other churches as as
[57:02] the prophet said. In other words, we are
[57:05] to separate from from denominations.
[57:08] all denominations, their false
[57:10] teachings, their the traditions of man,
[57:14] the the their creeds and dogmas and
[57:17] their worldly ways. And and the Bible
[57:21] tells us that we are not to uh fashion
[57:25] ourselves after the age that we live in,
[57:30] this leysosian age. Ain't that right?
[57:33] Now, as we have said, the the carnal
[57:35] church, they want mixers. As the prophet
[57:38] told us, they they want mixers. And this
[57:42] this is how Balum in the Old Testament
[57:45] caused Israel to fall. Uh uh Balam was a
[57:49] prophet of Moab. And Moab was a
[57:52] religious nation. Uh they had their own
[57:55] king, and that was Bailac. Uh uh he was
[57:59] the king of Moab. And uh the prophet
[58:02] said that Moab represented the
[58:04] nickelatans
[58:06] of today. And um and so uh Israel
[58:11] represented the true church. Amen. So
[58:14] you had the nickel uh a type of the
[58:17] nickelans and the type of the true
[58:19] church. And so, uh, the Moabites were
[58:23] descendants of Lot. Um, and and, uh,
[58:27] they were a product of incest. And, and
[58:31] there Genesis 19:36,
[58:34] it says, "Thus were both the daughters
[58:37] of Lot with child by their father, and
[58:40] the firstborn bear a son, and called his
[58:43] name Moab, the same is the father of the
[58:47] Moabites unto this day."
[58:50] So years later,
[58:53] uh the the seed of Abraham,
[58:56] uh true seed, uh they they come and and
[59:01] they were on their way, uh to the
[59:03] promised land. And uh they were going to
[59:06] pass through Moab, uh the country of
[59:10] Moab. And so they sent word to the king,
[59:13] um let us drink of your water. Let us uh
[59:16] you know let our cattle uh eat your
[59:19] grass and and things like that and then
[59:21] we will pay you uh for everything that
[59:24] we have taken and uh we have eaten. Well
[59:28] uh we we find amen that uh brother
[59:31] brother Ram says now you know the the
[59:34] king bail he got all excited because he
[59:38] didn't want such a meeting as that in
[59:40] his church or his land. he, you know,
[59:43] uh, he didn't want the true seed in in
[59:46] his coming through and and all these
[59:49] things. And so, uh, and and and
[59:53] doesn't want a genuine full gospel
[59:57] Pentecostal church. Amen. With signs and
[1:00:00] wonders working in it. He doesn't want
[1:00:03] that type in in in the land today.
[1:00:06] That's that's just what he doesn't he he
[1:00:08] doesn't want a church that has the true
[1:00:11] experience of Pentecost. Amen. And so uh
[1:00:16] we find that Balac he went and got uh uh
[1:00:20] the prophet of Moab uh the Moabites
[1:00:23] which was Balum. He was the prophet of
[1:00:25] the Moabites. And and he wanted him to
[1:00:28] go down and curse Israel and of course
[1:00:31] offered him some uh money. And so, uh,
[1:00:35] Ba, Balam was a hirling prophet, and he
[1:00:39] decides to go. And the Lord told him,
[1:00:41] "Don't you go. Don't you do it." But he
[1:00:43] went anyway. And so, when he opened his
[1:00:45] mouth to curse him, all he done was
[1:00:47] bless them.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. He couldn't curse them. He just he
[1:00:51] just every just might as well just shut
[1:00:54] up, you know, cuz every word he said was
[1:00:56] a blessing. It was prophecy. And that's
[1:00:59] still coming to pass today.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. the prophecies of Balum. And so uh
[1:01:05] so he couldn't curse them. So he come up
[1:01:07] with this idea. Brother Bram said he
[1:01:10] told Bailac to invite Israel to the the
[1:01:13] festival of the God. And they had a
[1:01:17] festival up there where they were going
[1:01:19] to have see uh and the festival was
[1:01:23] called the feast of Balpure.
[1:01:25] Uh, Bel Pure. Um, it was a feast to
[1:01:29] worship. And Balam said, "Now, I'll tell
[1:01:32] you, Bailo, I'll give you a good idea.
[1:01:35] Uh, uh, see, God won't cursed them.
[1:01:37] That's all there is to it. So, I'll tell
[1:01:39] you what we'll do. We can't get rid of
[1:01:41] them. But if you'll just invite them
[1:01:43] over, you'll swing the whole thing your
[1:01:46] way." So they invited all the Israelites
[1:01:50] up to this big feast and the big blowout
[1:01:53] and uh that they had and some big party
[1:01:58] shindig of a thing up there they had.
[1:02:01] And when they got up there, these
[1:02:03] Israelite people began to see these
[1:02:06] pretty sexy dressed Moabitete women.
[1:02:10] Yes. Wasn't like their common girls down
[1:02:13] there. Oh, they look so pretty. My he
[1:02:16] said and and how they were made and how
[1:02:19] they could show themselves and they fell
[1:02:23] for it and began to commit adultery.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; See, and Balam knowed if God wouldn't
[1:02:31] curse them, he'd take them over on this
[1:02:34] denominational side and cause the anger
[1:02:37] of God to kill them anyhow. Let God kill
[1:02:41] them himself. if he could ever get them
[1:02:44] out of the way of the truth. Ain't that
[1:02:46] right?
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; See, and so the prophet says, as soon as
[1:02:50] you walk out and join a church instead
[1:02:53] of receiving the baptism of the Holy
[1:02:55] Ghost, you're dead.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Just plain and simple,
[1:03:00] you're dead.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Spiritually speaking, the life is
[1:03:04] is killed off. It's it's it's there
[1:03:07] because there's no life in a
[1:03:08] denomination. No spiritual life in
[1:03:10] denominations. Ain't that right?
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; So, Israel began to intermar something
[1:03:16] that God told them not to do.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; They were supposed to keep themselves
[1:03:21] separate and to to be a holy people and
[1:03:25] they began to intermar and God never did
[1:03:29] forgive them for that. Right.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, as we know, the prophet
[1:03:35] through the in the church ages told us
[1:03:37] that that Constantine done the same
[1:03:39] thing that Balum did. And and it's
[1:03:43] mentioned in in the revelations that the
[1:03:46] the doctrine of Balum. Well, Constantine
[1:03:50] did that. The true church started on the
[1:03:52] day of Pentecost. That church had the
[1:03:55] fire of God in it. It had the signs and
[1:03:58] wonders uh following it and and
[1:04:01] following the believer and you can read
[1:04:04] uh of the things that God did through
[1:04:06] them uh uh in the book of Acts and and
[1:04:11] things. But it it started at Naia
[1:04:14] Council uh is where the first
[1:04:16] organization started which was the the
[1:04:20] Catholic Church. And and most most
[1:04:23] people think that Constantine is a
[1:04:26] Christian was a Christian. Brother Bram
[1:04:28] said he was not a Christian. He was a
[1:04:30] politician.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and so he joined up not with
[1:04:36] the true church. He joined up with the
[1:04:39] nickelans.
[1:04:41] And nickelans were lukewarm. They were
[1:04:44] formal. They they bypassed the baptism
[1:04:47] of the Holy Ghost. and they're the ones
[1:04:50] that started the troubles in the church
[1:04:52] and persecuting the true church and and
[1:04:55] on and on and on and so brother Bram
[1:04:58] said see nickelans were so-called
[1:05:01] professing Christians without the Holy
[1:05:04] Spirit he said they were Christian by
[1:05:06] name they were Christian by their
[1:05:08] gathering together they taken communion
[1:05:12] they kept the orders but rejected the
[1:05:15] leadership of the Holy Spirit they had
[1:05:19] uh no signs and wonders among them. They
[1:05:22] claimed those things were in the past
[1:05:25] and that they had to set up a church for
[1:05:28] a reign. Amen. A kingdom, a dominion.
[1:05:32] See, and so uh Constantine joined up
[1:05:36] with the Nickelans for the sole purpose
[1:05:39] uh to strengthen uh his empire, his his
[1:05:43] his kingdom. Amen. And so, Brother
[1:05:46] Brandon said he was not interested in
[1:05:48] Christianity. Amen. He had selfish
[1:05:52] motives. He had other uh motives behind
[1:05:55] his actions. And so, uh uh he just
[1:05:59] wanted to bring his pagan ancestors and
[1:06:02] his pagan church, the prophet said, to
[1:06:05] strengthen his empire as Rome always did
[1:06:09] to hold the keys to the world. Ain't
[1:06:10] that right? Amen. to conquer, divide and
[1:06:13] conquer and and and to strengthen
[1:06:17] themselves. Amen. To where they hold the
[1:06:20] keys to the world. Constantine had to
[1:06:23] bring his pagan ideas and take the
[1:06:26] Christian ideas. He took the pagan
[1:06:29] ideas, took the Christian ideas, and
[1:06:33] then put them together, consolidated
[1:06:36] them to weld this together and make
[1:06:38] himself an empire that would be second
[1:06:41] to none. In another place, he brought in
[1:06:44] pagan ceremonies over into the Nickelan
[1:06:48] Christian church. I'll call it, he says,
[1:06:50] the formal denominational church that
[1:06:54] was forming. He brought pagan ceremonies
[1:06:57] over into this nickelan church. And that
[1:07:00] was the birth of Catholicism.
[1:07:03] And we know uh uh all of that. So now
[1:07:06] now Satan is going to do it again. He's
[1:07:09] doing it again uh through the World
[1:07:12] Council of Churches.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we know that brother Brown
[1:07:16] said it's going to happen. the same
[1:07:18] thing going to happen where the churches
[1:07:21] all get together and it's going to be uh
[1:07:24] they make an image unto the beast and
[1:07:27] it'll it'll be the world council of
[1:07:29] churches. And so the prophet said now in
[1:07:32] order to get this thing to working
[1:07:34] Constantine set up a lot of worldly
[1:07:37] entertainments
[1:07:39] uh to attract the attention of both
[1:07:42] pagan and Christians into the church. He
[1:07:46] said, "Are you spiritually minded? Are
[1:07:48] you thinking, isn't that the message of
[1:07:50] the hour? The church has bunko games,
[1:07:53] parties, giveaway cars. See, just to get
[1:07:58] them mixed together, welding that power
[1:08:01] back un together till they can get a
[1:08:05] striking place." Just right here, he
[1:08:08] said, "Now that's history. Someone has
[1:08:11] no axe to grind. They're just quoting
[1:08:14] what happened." And he's talking reading
[1:08:16] history. See, but he did it welded the
[1:08:18] church together by having worldly
[1:08:20] entertainments to bring together the
[1:08:23] nickelan church. He said, now remember,
[1:08:26] he could not touch. Everybody say he
[1:08:28] could not touch that born again church.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; No, he was welding not the bornagain
[1:08:35] church. He was welding the nickelan
[1:08:38] church together to strengthen his
[1:08:40] empire. See, but uh and he says he says
[1:08:45] he couldn't touch any of the the the
[1:08:47] born again, but the formal nickelan
[1:08:50] church fell for it. He says, "And what
[1:08:52] do we have in our Pentecostal churches?
[1:08:55] Soup suppers, entertainment, skating,
[1:08:58] and rag sales, and everything else."
[1:09:00] See? Amen. See, so as as we have been
[1:09:04] taught and by the message of the hour,
[1:09:08] Amen. is that there is a a worldly
[1:09:11] church, a carnal church, all the same
[1:09:14] worldly and carnal church and there is a
[1:09:16] true holy ghostfilled church.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and if you notice both are
[1:09:25] made up of different material.
[1:09:28] Now the prophet says that the bride has
[1:09:30] got to be clothed and and you know we
[1:09:35] may not be getting a lot of sews in. I I
[1:09:38] don't know. I think we should do our
[1:09:40] best in every way to bring souls in. Uh
[1:09:44] uh so we we do not bring that to a
[1:09:46] minute thing or deminimize this. Amen.
[1:09:51] But we know that very few people are
[1:09:54] going to make it. And it's getting
[1:09:55] narrower and narrower and narrower to
[1:09:58] where the prophet said the righteous
[1:10:00] seed's going to run out and and and and
[1:10:03] God's going to have to take this bride
[1:10:05] home. But but what we are doing is the
[1:10:09] message of the hour is clothing us.
[1:10:12] Amen. Because Amen. You say, "Well, I've
[1:10:15] been in the message for for whatever.
[1:10:17] Why are we still here?" Well, it may not
[1:10:19] be so much as getting thousands of
[1:10:21] people in, but it it may be that God is
[1:10:25] clothing us. And I say he is clothing us
[1:10:28] with the message of the hour. This bride
[1:10:32] will not be found naked. This bride will
[1:10:35] not be found unclothed, but she will be
[1:10:38] clothed with the righteousness. Can you
[1:10:40] say amen? Of the word. The word is what
[1:10:44] is doing the the clothing. And and the
[1:10:48] that's the purpose I believe with all my
[1:10:50] heart of the five-fold ministry. You
[1:10:53] ministers, we are responsible to get
[1:10:56] into this message, preach this message,
[1:10:59] study this message, listen to this
[1:11:02] message, feed off this message. Our
[1:11:04] ministry should be feeding off the
[1:11:07] message of the hour.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are responsible to preach this
[1:11:12] message. Amen. But if you notice both
[1:11:15] churches, the Holy Ghost fil church and
[1:11:17] that carnal uh church u uh they're
[1:11:21] they're they're they're both made up of
[1:11:24] different material. Amen. The prophet
[1:11:27] says, see, it takes a cypress a cypress
[1:11:31] material to make a cypress boat, cypress
[1:11:34] tree, right? Cypress material to make a
[1:11:36] cypress boat. It takes a popular
[1:11:39] material to make a popular boat. And
[1:11:42] worldly material makes a worldly church,
[1:11:45] right? And Holy Ghost material makes a
[1:11:48] Holy Ghost church. Ain't that right?
[1:11:51] Amen. We're not making the Holy Ghost
[1:11:53] church. It's just we're preaching the
[1:11:55] Holy Ghost word. Amen. And and the Holy
[1:11:58] Ghost is making a Holy Ghost church.
[1:12:01] Word on top of word, word on top of
[1:12:04] word, line by line, precept upon
[1:12:07] precept. Can you say amen? And the
[1:12:09] material cannot get mixed. Amen. You
[1:12:14] brother Brandon so hit against
[1:12:17] hybridization,
[1:12:18] hybrid. It cannot be mixed. That true
[1:12:22] Holy Ghost church cannot have just a
[1:12:25] little bit of the worldly material.
[1:12:28] Amen. Just as much as that worldly
[1:12:31] church will not have an ounce of Holy
[1:12:34] Ghost material in it. Amen. Worldly
[1:12:37] material is making a worldly church.
[1:12:39] Holy Ghost material is making a Holy
[1:12:42] Ghost church. Can you say amen? So they
[1:12:44] it's got to stay separated. Amen. In
[1:12:48] 1958
[1:12:50] and and I've got a lot here so you bear
[1:12:52] with me. But in 1958
[1:12:56] in his prayer speaks of the church in
[1:12:58] general saying it's lost its sweetness.
[1:13:01] It's lost its love. It's lost its
[1:13:04] influence to bring sinners to you. Just
[1:13:07] taking in a bunch of members and
[1:13:09] baptizing them and let them live in the
[1:13:12] world and their influence has corrupted
[1:13:15] the church. Can you say amen? See? Amen.
[1:13:18] And and we find the church is they're
[1:13:22] more out um uh uh they they don't see
[1:13:25] the separation anymore. And and what's
[1:13:28] sad, you know, the Bible talks about woe
[1:13:30] unto them that call evil good and good
[1:13:32] evil. It's sad that that type of spirit
[1:13:35] has come into the churches, amen, to the
[1:13:38] worldly church, amen, to where they they
[1:13:41] they have no standards. They they don't
[1:13:44] preach against anything. and and and to
[1:13:47] where they're allowing homosexuals and
[1:13:50] and uh transgenders and all of these
[1:13:53] things. Uh in now in in so he's speaking
[1:13:58] of the worldly church if if you say it
[1:14:01] that way in 1963 he speaks of the recent
[1:14:05] event where the moon was blacked out.
[1:14:07] Remember in shalom if you haven't
[1:14:09] listened to it you ought to go listen to
[1:14:11] it the message shalom. and and he uh uh
[1:14:15] he speaks of the recent event there in
[1:14:18] uh where the moon was blacked out by the
[1:14:20] earth and the earth had gotten between
[1:14:24] the sun and the moon and and you
[1:14:27] remember the moon is a reflection of the
[1:14:29] sun. It has no light of its own. It's
[1:14:31] just a reflection. And the earth in
[1:14:34] between the sun of of the light of the
[1:14:38] sun and and to where it caused the moon
[1:14:42] to become darkened.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And brother Brand
[1:14:46] tells us there was a spiritual
[1:14:48] significance about this. A amen. And and
[1:14:52] uh the blackout of the moon, he says,
[1:14:55] represented this le oys church. if you
[1:14:58] wouldn't mind putting up that picture
[1:14:59] that I asked you about. Amen. Uh the
[1:15:02] blackout of the moon represented this
[1:15:05] lays in church. Brother Brandham also
[1:15:08] said the moon represents the church. The
[1:15:11] shadow of the world crosses the moon and
[1:15:15] the shadow of worldlyism. I say this
[1:15:18] again now. The moon represents the
[1:15:20] church. The shadow of the world crosses
[1:15:23] the moon. And the shadow of worldlyism,
[1:15:26] the shadow of worldliness, a worldly
[1:15:29] church has swept across to black out the
[1:15:32] entire light of the Bible. A ain't that
[1:15:35] amazing? The entire light. It wasn't
[1:15:38] partial light. It was in the entire
[1:15:40] light because the word had become
[1:15:42] opened. Ain't that right? And as the
[1:15:45] word became open to reveal Jesus Christ,
[1:15:49] amen. Then then we find, Amen. that God
[1:15:53] showed, amen, in the skies that that
[1:15:57] wordlyism, amen, had blacked out the
[1:16:00] entire light of the Bible, amen, to the
[1:16:03] church. He said the world got in the
[1:16:07] light of the reflection. Do you
[1:16:10] understand? The world crossed in the
[1:16:13] light of the moon and blinded out the
[1:16:15] sun. speaking of naturally. But
[1:16:17] remember, it was a type of it blocking
[1:16:20] out the light of the sun man. S O N
[1:16:24] light. Ain't that right? Remember it is
[1:16:26] the rising of the sun. Brother Brandham
[1:16:28] preached the sun has come up. It is
[1:16:30] light. It's a dual rising. And what a
[1:16:33] what a resurrection that was. What a
[1:16:35] resurrection this is. The light was
[1:16:38] shining in its full strength. And
[1:16:40] worldlyism
[1:16:42] blocked out the light. Ain't that right?
[1:16:45] Now the world crossed the in the light
[1:16:48] of the moon and blinded out the sun and
[1:16:51] the reflection of the moon that's
[1:16:54] supposed to be light to the earth. It
[1:16:57] was blacked out. Now there were six
[1:17:00] pictures, brother Brandham talks about
[1:17:02] six pictures in the newspaper of of the
[1:17:06] natural event. Amen. uh uh uh in at that
[1:17:10] time and and it went into national news
[1:17:14] and it showed six different stages of of
[1:17:18] the earth crossing the moon and each
[1:17:21] stage the moon was getting darker darker
[1:17:24] darker till it become a complete
[1:17:27] blackout. Now, before this time, before
[1:17:31] that happened in nature, brother
[1:17:33] Brandham had been teaching the the
[1:17:36] church ages. And he drawled that right
[1:17:39] there. That's what he draw. Uh uh and he
[1:17:43] was showing the phases of the moon, the
[1:17:47] church in every stage. Uh uh that middle
[1:17:50] was the dark ages. Amen. And and then
[1:17:54] you you find there uh so he was he
[1:17:57] drawled the seven phases of the church
[1:18:00] seven amen uh uh uh phases. Now he says
[1:18:04] I didn't know that one year and 6 months
[1:18:07] later God was going to vindicate it in
[1:18:10] the skies and slip it across the
[1:18:12] national papers. I didn't know. Now this
[1:18:16] is a prophet now. He was under
[1:18:18] inspiration as he's drawing that right.
[1:18:21] and and he he talks about it that when
[1:18:23] he drawled that uh uh he's got he's got
[1:18:25] it drawn out on the on the here. He said
[1:18:28] the the spirit of God went to the back
[1:18:31] wall and it began to show everyone that
[1:18:33] he just drawed on the wall right there.
[1:18:36] While he's talking here, he said the
[1:18:38] Holy Spirit went back and draw it right
[1:18:40] there on the wall and everybody's was
[1:18:43] watching it and looking at it. a year
[1:18:45] and 6 months or so later, God does it in
[1:18:48] the skies, in the heavens. And and so
[1:18:52] now a prophet is on earth. The world
[1:18:54] just looks at it as an eclipse or
[1:18:56] whatever, but a prophet now is showing
[1:18:59] the spiritual significance as to what
[1:19:02] was just happened. Ain't that right? And
[1:19:05] he's tying what happened out there in in
[1:19:08] the skies. Amen. was tied to to what he
[1:19:12] draw right there showing the people.
[1:19:14] Right? So he says now he says now on the
[1:19:18] papers you only get six ages.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Six ages is because the leotan
[1:19:28] age was completely blacked out.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; God showed that the Leoysian age was
[1:19:38] completely blacked out. Amen. He said,
[1:19:41] "Now, if you'll notice the spiritual
[1:19:43] application as God said it in the
[1:19:45] heaven, when I sat here on earth, I left
[1:19:49] see a little teeny a little teeny bitty
[1:19:53] space uh as uh just a little teeny bit
[1:19:57] of light." See, that was just before the
[1:20:00] very elect was to be called from the
[1:20:03] earth. The reason I place it on there
[1:20:06] for the seventh age when God, he said,
[1:20:08] that's the reason I put it there. When
[1:20:11] God put it in the heavens, it was
[1:20:13] totally blacked out. Means maybe the
[1:20:16] last one is called from that Leodysian
[1:20:20] age. We don't know. So, he wasn't saying
[1:20:23] it was the last one called from that
[1:20:25] Leodysian age. He said, "We don't know."
[1:20:27] It could be. Ain't that right? But the
[1:20:30] significance of this is that the
[1:20:33] worldliness has got in the way of the s
[1:20:38] light in this leotan age till Leoan age
[1:20:43] sits in darkness.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Now, if you notice in
[1:20:50] the masterpiece, the prophet says, uh,
[1:20:52] he, meaning God, is going to bring this
[1:20:56] little bride, that smitten, right back
[1:20:59] to the side of the original word.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; And there he is. There is the
[1:21:05] masterpiece, the family, back again in
[1:21:08] the Garden of Eden. How is this bride
[1:21:11] going to do this? How is this wheat
[1:21:14] going to do this? Malachi 4 said in the
[1:21:17] last days it would be restored back.
[1:21:21] What? Restored back like the beginning.
[1:21:25] Take it back.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Not sitting in darkness
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; but taking it back.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Leodysa is left
[1:21:34] without the Holy Ghost.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Leoa is left in darkness. Total
[1:21:39] blackout. But God is making a bride.
[1:21:42] Amen.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, restored back
[1:21:47] like it at the beginning. Take it back.
[1:21:49] I will restore, sayeth the Lord, all the
[1:21:52] years the palmer worm and the canker
[1:21:55] worm and all these other things has
[1:21:56] eaten. I will restore again. Notice he
[1:22:00] says, "And Malachi 4 is to bring back to
[1:22:04] the original."
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Without Malachi 4, you'd be sitting in
[1:22:08] darkness. Without my California, you'd
[1:22:10] be part of the Leoysian age. Amen. Don't
[1:22:13] take this message for for granted now.
[1:22:16] Amen. Don't take the messenger for
[1:22:18] granted. God gave us a messenger with a
[1:22:20] message. He and the his message are one.
[1:22:24] How many believes that? Amen. And so now
[1:22:28] notice Mal 4 is to bring back to the
[1:22:31] original. She, the bride, is smitten
[1:22:34] from the church, from the church body,
[1:22:37] smitten with her master for the same
[1:22:40] purpose. She is the word.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Just the same as Joseph was smitten from
[1:22:47] his brethren because he was the word.
[1:22:49] Jesus was smitten from his brethren
[1:22:52] because he was the word. The church or
[1:22:55] the bride is smitten from the church
[1:22:58] because she is the word.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen. Another place,
[1:23:03] the word living and in action. The Bible
[1:23:06] bride.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Not just any old bride. Not churches,
[1:23:10] churches, brides, brides. The Bible
[1:23:13] bride. The word bride. A ain't that
[1:23:16] right. They say, "Well, brother Brandon
[1:23:18] was out of scriptures and all that. You
[1:23:20] can't even, you know, and and all these
[1:23:22] things." That's a lie.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; He preached from these scriptures. It's
[1:23:25] just the problem is people are blinded.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen. They don't know
[1:23:30] their Bible like they think they do. But
[1:23:33] a prophet would give us the true
[1:23:35] interpretation of this word to where we
[1:23:38] could become a Bible bride. Not some
[1:23:41] man-made bride, but the Bible bride,
[1:23:44] smitten and afflicted of God. No beauty
[1:23:47] we should desire her. But yet we did
[1:23:51] esteem her smitten and afflicted of God.
[1:23:54] That's right. She stands alone. She is
[1:23:57] smitten from all the denominations
[1:23:59] according to Revelations 3. She is
[1:24:02] smitten out of the Leoysa church age
[1:24:04] that she was raised up in.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; So we're not part of this leotan age.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; We have no dealings with this Leoysan
[1:24:13] age. In other words, the spirit of this
[1:24:15] leodysian age has no effect upon us
[1:24:18] because we've been smitten from that.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. No. No. uh the
[1:24:26] teachings of Leoa does not affect us.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; The the the spirits of Leoa has no hold
[1:24:33] on us.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; It's the word and the word only.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad for that?
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; See, she stands alone like the
[1:24:42] bridegroom, rejected of man, despised
[1:24:45] and rejected of the churches. Amen. The
[1:24:48] bride stands that way. What is it? It's
[1:24:50] his masterpiece.
[1:24:53] It's the word that he can work through
[1:24:55] and make manifest. Another place, the
[1:24:58] stalk, the tossel and husk never become
[1:25:02] seed. No, but all the time. Amen. Uh
[1:25:07] become more like seed. See the stock,
[1:25:10] the tossel and hos never become seed.
[1:25:13] No, but all the time becoming more like
[1:25:16] the seed. Amen. Each phase, each stage
[1:25:19] is coming more and more until it got
[1:25:21] around the shuck and it looked like the
[1:25:24] seed. The prophet said the Pentecostals
[1:25:26] actually looked like the real thing, but
[1:25:28] it wasn't the real thing. Pentecostal
[1:25:30] age thought looked like the real moving
[1:25:33] of the spirit and all that, but it
[1:25:35] wasn't the real thing. Amen. Sure, they
[1:25:37] had a little spirit there and and all
[1:25:39] these things, but it wasn't what God was
[1:25:41] after. It wasn't bringing this church up
[1:25:44] to a ripening place. See, so now at the
[1:25:48] harvest time, the har, how many believes
[1:25:50] we're in the harvest time? We are in the
[1:25:53] harvest time. And he says the seed is
[1:25:56] back to its original life, back to the
[1:25:59] Bible, Bible life, Bible inspiration.
[1:26:03] Amen. See, Malachi 4 said it would be
[1:26:05] brought that way. Oh, must have all to
[1:26:10] be this way, it must have all of the
[1:26:14] word. Amen.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Now notice this is not a Pentecostal
[1:26:18] age. He said this is the latter day age.
[1:26:22] This is the bright age.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? This is the evening
[1:26:27] light. We're another place. We're not
[1:26:30] living in a Pentecostal age. We're
[1:26:32] living in another age. We're not living
[1:26:34] in the messedith age. And and we're
[1:26:36] living in another age. We're living on
[1:26:38] up here to the bride age. He's showing
[1:26:41] that this bride has been smitten.
[1:26:43] Smitten from the churches. Smitten from
[1:26:45] that church age. Denominationational
[1:26:48] age. That's what the church ages were.
[1:26:50] Denominational ages. Ain't that right?
[1:26:54] Living up there were living on up here
[1:26:56] to the bride age. The calling out of the
[1:26:58] church and getting it together for the
[1:27:00] rapture.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Another place you look at the calendar
[1:27:03] and find out what day of the year you're
[1:27:05] living in. And you look at God's Bible
[1:27:08] and see what age we're living in. We're
[1:27:11] not living in the Methodist age. the
[1:27:13] Baptist age. We're living in the bride
[1:27:15] age. The calling, bringing back to God
[1:27:18] through a channel that he promised to
[1:27:20] bring it back in. Well, what's the
[1:27:22] channel? Malachi 4, Revelations 10, Luke
[1:27:26] 17:30, Zechariah 4. Amen. The channels,
[1:27:31] there's promises that God left in this
[1:27:34] word to tell us how he would bring this
[1:27:37] bride back.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Now the bride church, she's
[1:27:43] a holy se she's a separated unto the
[1:27:46] Lord. A holy people separated.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; This bride church is living in a total
[1:27:55] different atmosphere
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; than what the leota church is living in.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I'm thankful for the message of
[1:28:07] the hour.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. because I see that it's had an
[1:28:12] influence on me. I see that it's had an
[1:28:14] influence on you and and many around the
[1:28:18] world.
[1:28:20] But this is not to say that we don't
[1:28:23] have our struggles.
[1:28:25] Um
[1:28:28] and that we are without warfare.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; We have warfare. We have even more of a
[1:28:35] warfare being that we've got the message
[1:28:37] given to us.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; The warfare, this message is what's
[1:28:46] bringing a bride. And as we keep coming
[1:28:51] fighting,
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; and Satan is trying his best to exert
[1:28:57] his influence over us.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; I I'll ask you, how many believe you're
[1:29:06] free?
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Believe you're free.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Well,
[1:29:12] Satan again, he's even though we're
[1:29:16] free, even though he's still trying to
[1:29:19] bring exert an influence over us.
[1:29:23] So, the prophet taught us that we have
[1:29:25] to be careful. We have to be careful as
[1:29:29] to
[1:29:30] uh what influence we come under or hang
[1:29:33] around.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; One place he says don't follow the wrong
[1:29:37] influence.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? He ain't talking to
[1:29:41] the world. He's talking to the bride,
[1:29:43] talking to the church. And as we know
[1:29:46] the prophet taught us that every mortal
[1:29:49] human being is influenced
[1:29:53] uh
[1:29:54] you you're going to be influenced either
[1:29:56] by the wrong influence or the right.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; He says see the wrong gives an influence
[1:30:03] and the right gives an influence.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; And the devil by demonic spirits
[1:30:09] influences men on the earth. So, Satan
[1:30:13] is not without influence.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Satan by demonic spirits influences men
[1:30:19] on the earth and the Holy Ghost
[1:30:22] influences his church.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Notice how he says it. The devil by
[1:30:31] demonic spirits influences men on the
[1:30:34] earth, but the Holy Ghost influences his
[1:30:37] church.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Be part of the church. That's right.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now, the the the sinner is
[1:30:46] influenced by a spirit because he has a
[1:30:48] spirit."
[1:30:49] And that's how we're all influences
[1:30:51] because we're spirit
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; beings.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; The the the sinner is influenced by a
[1:30:57] spirit because he has a spirit. And
[1:30:59] those who are dominated uh uh with
[1:31:03] blackness and separation are dominated
[1:31:05] from the underworld of devils. All
[1:31:08] right.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Now, we we know that,
[1:31:13] you know, like they say Billy Sunday
[1:31:15] when he would come to town, he'd shut
[1:31:16] up. He'd close the bars. I mean, he had
[1:31:19] such a ministry and and things and he
[1:31:22] would preach such conviction that it
[1:31:25] would actually close the bars and things
[1:31:27] in town.
[1:31:29] When brother Brandham come, he didn't
[1:31:32] really
[1:31:34] point out the spirits that are out
[1:31:36] there, but he pointed out that spirit
[1:31:39] that was in the church.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; That was a religious spirit.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; That's right. So when we think that he
[1:31:47] says, you know, those that are dominated
[1:31:49] with blackness and separation are
[1:31:51] dominated from the underworld of devils,
[1:31:53] we're thinking of people that got
[1:31:55] baseball bats that are hitting other
[1:31:57] people in the head and murdering and
[1:31:58] running from the law and drinking and
[1:32:00] drugs and sex and all these things. But
[1:32:04] there is a religious spirit too
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; that comes from the underworld.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:32:13] Now, brother Brandham talking about the
[1:32:16] Pentecost, the saints at Pentecost, he
[1:32:19] said they were influenced by the word
[1:32:23] to the word.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; That 120 at Pentecost, they were
[1:32:28] influenced to the word.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; They weren't influenced to emotions. But
[1:32:33] when Peter stood up and they were
[1:32:34] asking, "What is this?" Peter took it
[1:32:37] right to the word and said this is that
[1:32:41] which was promised by the prophet Joel.
[1:32:44] Can you say amen? See their influence.
[1:32:47] Amen. Took him to the word.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. To fulfill the word
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; for today. Amen. And he says and we
[1:32:55] should be under the same influence.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; We've got to be under the same
[1:33:01] influence.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. This message has got an influence.
[1:33:06] That's right.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; You can't be bride without influence.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Can't come from sinner to saint without
[1:33:13] influence.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Can't leave the things of the world and
[1:33:16] and and cleave to the things of God
[1:33:19] without the right influence.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, and so we find that it's an
[1:33:27] influence. Now, brother Brown talked
[1:33:30] about the pillar of fire that come down
[1:33:32] in Germany. He said the German church
[1:33:34] come to him and says you know we agree
[1:33:36] with your theology. We agree with
[1:33:37] everything that you're saying and all
[1:33:39] these things and and he said but they
[1:33:42] they said but that supernatural part
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; we don't we don't understand.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. That that pillar of fire we just
[1:33:50] don't understand that. He says all of a
[1:33:52] sudden the pillar of fire dropped
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; in that congregation and it dropped. And
[1:33:58] he says as soon as it come into that
[1:34:00] place the atmosphere changed.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? The atmosphere. And he
[1:34:07] says it's atmosphere. Men and women
[1:34:10] should live under that atmosphere.
[1:34:14] Don't get under some normal world
[1:34:17] existing influence but stay under the
[1:34:20] atmosphere of the Lord Jesus.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? It's got to be an
[1:34:27] atmosphere that we live in in order for
[1:34:29] a rapture.
[1:34:31] [Music]
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; You can't live in the atmosphere of
[1:34:36] honky tones.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; You live in the in the in under the
[1:34:41] influence of whiskey and tobacco. Amen.
[1:34:44] And lying and cursing and adultery and
[1:34:47] going in a rapture.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; There is an influence we've got to stay
[1:34:51] under.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:34:55] That's right.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Bram says, "Now listen,
[1:34:59] anything." Any, everybody say anything.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; That means anything, right?
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Anything means all, right?
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; All means all. Anything. All. All.
[1:35:08] Anything. Anything. Right? He says,
[1:35:11] "Anything that would keep the word from
[1:35:14] going forth with great power and
[1:35:16] influence today on our lives, take it
[1:35:18] away, Lord."
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; How many wants that? Anything that would
[1:35:22] take the influence of the word from our
[1:35:25] lives taken away.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Any hindrance that we might have full
[1:35:36] access. Everybody say full access.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Full access to the blessings promised to
[1:35:44] us through thy word.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:50] So we see that there are things that
[1:35:54] can keep the word from having an
[1:35:56] influence on us.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; We are to be word bride. We are to be
[1:36:01] clothed with that word. We are to come
[1:36:03] up rising higher and higher as the the
[1:36:06] prophet talked to that eagllet. Amen.
[1:36:09] There in the chicken pin. But he did the
[1:36:11] story didn't leave him in that chicken
[1:36:13] pin. Amen. The the the the story was he
[1:36:16] was trapped there. Amen. Not by his own
[1:36:19] will. It was somebody put him there.
[1:36:22] Ain't that right? He was trapped. He he
[1:36:25] he had no identity of who he was. He
[1:36:28] just knew he couldn't clock like the
[1:36:29] chicken. He couldn't eat the diet like
[1:36:31] the chicken. He couldn't pick at at at
[1:36:34] the others like a chicken and and do
[1:36:36] everything the chicken was doing. But
[1:36:38] when mama screamed up the voice from the
[1:36:41] heavens, amen, there was nothing there
[1:36:44] to block the the voice, the impact of
[1:36:47] the voice, amen, and the and the eagle,
[1:36:50] amen, be to hop and it hopped up on the
[1:36:52] fence and it hopped up on the barnyard
[1:36:54] and fin before you know it, it was up
[1:36:56] there soaring with mama. Can you say
[1:36:59] amen? Well, that's what this message is.
[1:37:02] It's the call of the eagle. We were
[1:37:05] trapped in the barnyard, but we couldn't
[1:37:08] fit. We took the drink, but we couldn't
[1:37:10] fit in with the world. We fought, but we
[1:37:13] just couldn't. We were so miserable. We
[1:37:15] might have taken the drugs and the
[1:37:17] prostitution and the adultery and all of
[1:37:19] that, but something just wasn't right.
[1:37:22] Amen. We might have sit in a church all
[1:37:24] of our life as I was in a Pentecostal
[1:37:27] church. Amen. I still wasn't happy.
[1:37:30] Amen. But I Oh, when I heard the eagle
[1:37:33] scream, Amen. There was something that
[1:37:36] been having an influence over me that
[1:37:38] nothing else could influence me like
[1:37:41] this message.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; It influenced.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; There are things that can keep the word
[1:37:51] from having an influence over us. Now,
[1:37:54] I'm going to get into
[1:37:56] what I got into last Sunday or the last
[1:37:59] time I spoke on this subject.
[1:38:03] One of the greatest influences in the
[1:38:06] world today is television.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Television.
[1:38:18] Now, here's what Brother Brandon said.
[1:38:21] He said, "We rent from a woman that has
[1:38:23] the television in her house."
[1:38:26] I
[1:38:27] never intend to have one in my house.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; No, sir. I don't want that thing in my
[1:38:32] house. I would blow it out with my
[1:38:36] shotgun. I don't want nothing to do with
[1:38:39] that evil thing.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you about you Arizonans
[1:38:45] here. You seen that analysis the other
[1:38:47] day of schools, didn't you? 80% of the
[1:38:51] children in Arizona schools are
[1:38:52] suffering with mental deficiency
[1:39:03] by looking was by looking at television.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Now we it's it's becoming prominent uh
[1:39:10] in this age this time everybody's
[1:39:13] talking about mental mental mental
[1:39:15] breakdown mental deficiencies.
[1:39:17] Everybody's mental. Not everybody, but
[1:39:19] most you think everybody was right.
[1:39:22] Amen. Mental. Mental. But brother Brown,
[1:39:25] here's a prophet now describing or
[1:39:27] telling
[1:39:29] it was by television.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; He said, "See, how about that? You
[1:39:34] better use your shotgun."
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Now, some message people don't have
[1:39:40] shotguns. They need to go buy them one.
[1:39:45] Now, don't let the devil don't let the
[1:39:48] devil spray you with that.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Another place, we don't have television.
[1:39:52] There won't be one in my home. Never.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "You want them? That's up to
[1:39:57] you." But God told me not to do it.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Now, Psalms 101 and two,
[1:40:07] David says, "I will behave myself wisely
[1:40:09] in a perfect way. Oh, when will thou
[1:40:13] come unto me? I will walk within my
[1:40:16] house with a perfect heart.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; I will set no wicked thing before my
[1:40:20] eyes. I hate the work of them that turn
[1:40:22] aside. It shall not cleave to me.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to list maybe some of the
[1:40:29] things that we, you know, if you're
[1:40:31] watching movies, if you're television,
[1:40:33] all that, there's there's so many
[1:40:35] things. Do you realize first of all,
[1:40:39] our children would not be introduced to
[1:40:42] murder.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; That's right. sex, adultery,
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; cussing,
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; blasphemies,
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; drinking, smoking,
[1:40:54] um what they they wouldn't be introduced
[1:40:58] to that if we put didn't have a
[1:41:00] television,
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Most most young people are introduced to
[1:41:05] it at a young age and they would have
[1:41:08] never seen any most of that in their
[1:41:10] life. Rapes
[1:41:13] Amen.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; So, so most of these things you'll see
[1:41:17] in a movie programs or whatever in most
[1:41:20] movies,
[1:41:22] the breaking of God's commandments,
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Flaunted immorality.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Casual drinking.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Did you know even the prophet says you
[1:41:32] don't have he didn't even he didn't
[1:41:33] preach all all about alcoholism or being
[1:41:36] an alcoholic. He preached about taking
[1:41:39] social drinks.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Sure. casual drinking, the drug usage,
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; drunkenness portrayed as humorous.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Sexual alluring fashions,
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; sexually enticing dancing,
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; violence and and may mockery things of
[1:42:01] God,
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; mockery of God's people.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Pagan religions depicted as the truth.
[1:42:11] Yeah. Amen.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; You're not see hearing this taught in
[1:42:14] church. You're hearing it taught in
[1:42:16] movies.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Sensual situational ethics, occultism,
[1:42:24] paganism, humanism, evolution and new
[1:42:27] age era and and error or uh era or
[1:42:31] whatever. But uh uh and that's even in
[1:42:34] the cartoons and Disney movies and and
[1:42:36] all of that. And and somehow
[1:42:39] these young adults, young couples thinks
[1:42:43] that cartoons
[1:42:44] are okay.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; I don't get it.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Now, I read some of the following the
[1:42:54] last Sunday and I'm going to speak uh
[1:42:56] when I spoke on this subject and I'm
[1:42:57] going to go ahead and read it because
[1:42:58] some of you wasn't present and some
[1:43:01] probably listening online. Well, you
[1:43:03] didn't get to hear it because we were
[1:43:05] read doing it at the library.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; And so I want to read it again, but this
[1:43:11] is what the secular world is saying.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; It says, one writer said, "Time and time
[1:43:17] again, cinema is mindlessly dismissed as
[1:43:20] escapism.
[1:43:22] While films are predominantly created
[1:43:25] for entertainment purposes, it would be
[1:43:28] a mistake to reject their world changing
[1:43:31] potential." Yeah,
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; movies can have an impact far greater
[1:43:35] than first imagined. They can influence
[1:43:38] culture, politics, laws, and more
[1:43:40] importantly, they can change the course
[1:43:42] of history. As Saudi Arabia's first
[1:43:45] female producer perfectly stated, art,
[1:43:48] meaning movies, can touch people and
[1:43:51] make them open up. So, it's making
[1:43:55] people open up to what? Devils.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what it is. making their
[1:44:02] minds just go uh lame or or or uh limber
[1:44:08] or relaxed.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; One writer said movies can shape social
[1:44:15] trends and influence public behavior.
[1:44:17] For example, fashion in movies often
[1:44:20] sparks real world trends. 1961, one
[1:44:24] movie made Audrey Hepern's little black
[1:44:27] dress a fashion staple. Movies can
[1:44:30] influence language, popularizing slang
[1:44:33] or catchphrases that enter everyday
[1:44:37] conversations.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; Uh beyond cultural and social impact,
[1:44:43] movies have a direct influence on
[1:44:46] individual behaviors, attitudes, and
[1:44:49] decision making.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; movies can inspire. I say they do
[1:44:54] inspire.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. can inspire people affect can
[1:45:00] inspire people affect their emotional
[1:45:02] state or alter their views on certain
[1:45:06] issues. Political movies can sway public
[1:45:09] opinion on controversial topics.
[1:45:13] Research has shown that movies can
[1:45:15] influence behavior by normalizing
[1:45:19] certain actions.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; Is that not where we're at?
[1:45:24] It started with television, with movies,
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; and and they they normalized the
[1:45:31] actions. They normalized revenge. They
[1:45:34] normalized hate. They normalized broken
[1:45:38] homes.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; They normalize women taking the role of
[1:45:44] men.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; They normalized it.
[1:45:49] They normalized it to where if the wife
[1:45:52] is the is the homemaker and she stays
[1:45:54] home taking care of her husband and
[1:45:55] children, she's outdated and she's in
[1:45:57] bondage and she's just being abused and
[1:46:00] misused. They normalize this stuff.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; So he says, you know, for example,
[1:46:08] movies that glamorize smoking, drinking,
[1:46:11] drugs, or violence can unintentionally
[1:46:14] promote these behaviors. I say
[1:46:17] intentionally,
[1:46:19] at least if they don't realize it, the
[1:46:20] devil knows exactly what he's doing.
[1:46:23] Because you remember what the prophet
[1:46:24] said, "It used to be wrong to go to the
[1:46:26] movie shows, but Satan snuck a good one
[1:46:28] on us and put it in our house."
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Can an unintentionally promote these
[1:46:34] behaviors among impressionable viewers.
[1:46:38] One writer says movies
[1:46:41] can have a negative influence on society
[1:46:44] by exposing young people to harmful
[1:46:46] behaviors and attitudes. For example,
[1:46:49] movies may encourage the adoption of
[1:46:52] clothing styles, dietary habits.
[1:46:57] You know, used to it used to be just
[1:46:59] common meals,
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; common things. Now, we've got to have
[1:47:05] what what I I wished I had words that I
[1:47:07] could use the koviar or whatever that
[1:47:11] would be.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; And you know the special things.
[1:47:20] I was telling someone the other day, pig
[1:47:22] slop now we call that casserose
[1:47:27] out.
[1:47:30] I like casserose. I just thought it was
[1:47:32] funny.
[1:47:34] You can laugh. It was an intentional
[1:47:36] hurt. I love your casseros.
[1:47:40] There you go.
[1:47:43] I'm running for office.
[1:47:46] So, we we see that that it's influenced
[1:47:49] and and they say the influence comes
[1:47:52] from television.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; People aren't happy with just regular
[1:47:57] meals. That's right.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; We got to hire the now, you know.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; So, so
[1:48:09] it goes on. Movies may encourage the
[1:48:12] adoption of closed dietary habits,
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; cultural elements that deviate from
[1:48:18] societal norms,
[1:48:21] potentially leading to a loss of
[1:48:24] cultural integrity.
[1:48:28] Movies featuring dangerous stunts or
[1:48:31] violent content can inspire reckless
[1:48:33] behavior among youth,
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; endangering their lives.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; The portrayal of substance abuse in
[1:48:40] movies can also lead teenagers to
[1:48:43] experiment with drugs, alcohol, tobacco,
[1:48:47] believing it enhances their social
[1:48:50] image.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; Movies can challenge faith and guide
[1:48:54] impressional mind. impressionable minds
[1:48:57] down morally ambiguous paths, disrupting
[1:49:02] their ethical comp compass. Exposure to
[1:49:06] violence and bloodshed in movies can
[1:49:08] desensitize young minds. I say young
[1:49:12] minds of all ages. Fostering an
[1:49:15] inclination towards extremism and
[1:49:18] antisocial behavior. Are we not seeing
[1:49:21] that? Yeah.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; Oh wow. So this influence goes on
[1:49:29] extends to lifestyle choices where the
[1:49:32] emulation of actors who indulge in
[1:49:34] substance abuse on screen can lead to
[1:49:37] teenagers to experiment with drugs,
[1:49:40] alcohol, tobacco. It also leads them to
[1:49:42] experiment in premarital sex when they
[1:49:45] see the actors doing insex acts.
[1:49:50] The psych psychological impact of movies
[1:49:53] is significant in that people are
[1:49:56] exposed to a wide range of emotions in a
[1:49:59] short span.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Which can have serious repercussions on
[1:50:04] their attitude in life.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Movies can make you laugh, cry,
[1:50:11] hurt,
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; anguish,
[1:50:14] sorrowful.
[1:50:16] It has control over your emotions.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; And you could have do all that within
[1:50:20] two hours of a movie.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; Children and youth become desensitized
[1:50:28] to crimes leading to ins insensitivity
[1:50:32] towards criminal activity. Yeah.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Movies also create unrealistic
[1:50:38] expectations about life and
[1:50:40] relationships.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; Affecting viewers perceptions of how
[1:50:47] life should unfold.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Another writer says, "Whether it is that
[1:50:52] slick action thriller or the cheesy
[1:50:54] romantic comedy, chances are the movies
[1:50:57] you watch influence you."
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:00] Movies play a salient part in our lives.
[1:51:04] When we want to escape the stress and
[1:51:06] and constraints of daily life, we turn
[1:51:09] to this art form.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Now, people turn to their phones. Right.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; And the combine the combined use of
[1:51:18] stunning visuals and captivating sound
[1:51:21] helps transport us to another realm and
[1:51:25] creates an immersive experience.
[1:51:29] Despite the role it plays, we often
[1:51:31] reduce it to be a mere source of
[1:51:34] entertainment.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; They call this, as we said last time,
[1:51:41] the mirroring rule, which refers to our
[1:51:45] tendency to imitate the emotions of
[1:51:48] another individual.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; Mirroring others emotions explains how
[1:51:53] we experience desired emotions
[1:51:56] throughout the movie. The mirroring rule
[1:51:59] is illustrated by the fact that when we
[1:52:02] see a smiling face on the screen, our
[1:52:04] natural tendency is to also smile, which
[1:52:07] results in feelings of happiness.
[1:52:10] Similarly, when a sad situation arises
[1:52:13] in a movie, we not only mirror the
[1:52:15] character's emotions, but this mirroring
[1:52:18] also causes us to to feel the uh emotion
[1:52:23] that is associated with it. See, another
[1:52:26] says, "Studies have shown that when it
[1:52:28] comes to feelings, movies have the
[1:52:30] exceptional
[1:52:32] ability to elicit any desired emotion
[1:52:36] from the audience,
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; especially when they use a captivating
[1:52:40] and compelling story line.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; Movies we watch, the movies we watch
[1:52:46] influence our behavior in various
[1:52:48] aspects. When we observe a character who
[1:52:50] resonates with us acting in a particular
[1:52:53] way, we as viewers might model that
[1:52:56] behavior in an effort to replicate the
[1:52:59] actor's characteristics.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Yeah.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Says, for example, 2000 and a 2018 study
[1:53:07] showed that children who watched a
[1:53:09] Disney clip featuring Lightning McQueen
[1:53:12] from the movie Cars, adding another
[1:53:15] character on the screen exhibited
[1:53:17] similar helping behaviors toward their
[1:53:19] peers afterwards. Another movie
[1:53:22] encouraged audiences to change their
[1:53:24] eating and shopping habits such as
[1:53:27] increasing their consumption of healthy
[1:53:30] foods and and purchase of organic
[1:53:33] produce.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; So they know what they're doing, right?
[1:53:37] So studies over time over time have
[1:53:41] highlighted that watching violent movies
[1:53:43] can result in aggressive behaviors.
[1:53:46] Regardless of whether the viewer is a
[1:53:48] 5-year-old child or a full-g grown
[1:53:51] adult, we imitate the content we see.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Movies show that reckless driving causes
[1:53:57] the viewer to imitate this.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Another
[1:54:04] this effect can occurs because we either
[1:54:08] identify with the characters or hold
[1:54:10] them in high regard as our role models.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; By identification, we mean the ability
[1:54:18] to put oneself in the character shoes or
[1:54:22] to empathize with them. In both of these
[1:54:25] situations, we begin to closely observe
[1:54:27] their behaviors and attempt to reproduce
[1:54:30] them in our own lives.
[1:54:33] We do this because we want to emulate
[1:54:36] the characteristics or traits of the
[1:54:38] character that we find alluring. Now,
[1:54:42] this is the problem is because we we
[1:54:44] find that they put a romance to things
[1:54:47] even about a marriage that that is not
[1:54:50] it's it's all it's fake.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; It's it's fantasy,
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; right? Right.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; And then we want our wives to to emulate
[1:55:03] these things or we want our husbands to
[1:55:05] be like this.
[1:55:08] Well, you know, Gilbert was that way,
[1:55:11] you know, on Anna Green Gables. Well,
[1:55:15] ain't you like that? Well, you're not an
[1:55:25] movies that promote homosexuality tend
[1:55:28] to make people more acceptable towards
[1:55:31] this lifestyle. So, you understand even
[1:55:34] preachers that are preaching against
[1:55:36] homosexuals
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; and that spirit of what they have to
[1:55:39] deal with in the congregation
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; to where even the the preachers cave in.
[1:55:47] because they're being there's an
[1:55:48] influence coming in the church and it
[1:55:51] certainly ain't the gospel.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; And I'm not saying here I'm just saying
[1:55:59] churches darkly ought to see it.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; One writer says a sad movie will leave
[1:56:06] its viewers with feelings of sadness and
[1:56:09] heaviness.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; A horror movie leaves its viewers
[1:56:13] fearful and afraid. Now, they wouldn't
[1:56:16] have been that way
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; if they would have just sat in their
[1:56:19] living room and talked with their wife
[1:56:21] or their children and drank coffee or
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; diet coke.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; But because they opened their mind up,
[1:56:30] let an influence through in their home
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; might have had a good day at work, good
[1:56:37] day shopping, good day whatever, and now
[1:56:40] they're filled with fear.
[1:56:45] because an influence came in that had no
[1:56:49] business being there.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Product placements in movies affect
[1:56:57] audienc's behavior. Whether it be the
[1:57:00] presence of a swanky car, delicious
[1:57:02] chocolate,
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; or alcohol,
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; a character may name drop name drop some
[1:57:15] big big name brand throughout the course
[1:57:18] of the movie. This not only helps draw
[1:57:20] attention and increase brand awareness
[1:57:23] but ultimately impacts consumer behavior
[1:57:26] towards purging products.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So Satan has been able
[1:57:33] through movies Hollywood been able to
[1:57:37] bring all kinds of influences into the
[1:57:40] home to where he can both he can control
[1:57:43] both parent and child.
[1:57:50] He also does it to control the family
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; structure and the marriage. Can you say
[1:57:57] amen?
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; One writer said, "Seldom do we reflect
[1:58:00] on the power that movies have in shaping
[1:58:02] how we feel, think and act."
[1:58:06] [Music]
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; One writer says, "Mov exert a trend a
[1:58:11] tremendous effect on people's
[1:58:13] psychology. People are exposed to all
[1:58:16] kinds of emotions within a short span of
[1:58:19] two or three hours. Love, hatred,
[1:58:22] vengeance, rape, savage violence,
[1:58:24] adultery, and many other undesirable
[1:58:27] activi activities are shown within such
[1:58:30] a short period of time.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So, as I said, if it
[1:58:36] wasn't for Hollywood,
[1:58:39] people would not have had occasions to
[1:58:43] experience real this these things in
[1:58:46] real life, but movies have brought it in
[1:58:49] to where they can experience and feel
[1:58:51] and feel, not just sitting there
[1:58:53] watching something. But remember,
[1:58:55] brother Brown said, "The eye is the gate
[1:58:56] to the soul."
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; It it it works up the emotion. It works
[1:59:02] up the it it steers maybe shouldn't have
[1:59:06] been there or wouldn't have been there
[1:59:08] if you hadn't have seen
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; such atrocities.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; So, so here we we find that
[1:59:24] one
[1:59:26] one writer said such scenes as rape,
[1:59:29] murder, vengeance, yada yada, are shown
[1:59:32] to everyone without any hesitation or
[1:59:34] restriction in the name of what people
[1:59:36] call the people of Hollywood calls
[1:59:39] entertainment. Entertainment, right?
[1:59:41] Keep that in mind. Entertainment. It's
[1:59:44] becomes entertainment to us.
[1:59:47] Never mind the fact of all the things
[1:59:49] that we just saw, everything, all the
[1:59:51] emotions we just felt.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; And the things that leave us or or stay
[1:59:56] with us after the movie is over.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; Now, we find that the people of this age
[2:00:05] are exhibiting the same behavior
[2:00:07] patterns and characteristics as the
[2:00:10] maniac at Geria.
[2:00:13] This man was so perfectly under the
[2:00:15] influence of the devil, he cut himself.
[2:00:20] Are we not in an age where young people
[2:00:22] are cutting themselves?
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; They are.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; I never saw that in my age.
[2:00:29] Did Did you elders? Did y'all see that
[2:00:30] in your age?
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Did y'all see that in your age? Y'all
[2:00:33] didn't see cutting yourselves and all of
[2:00:36] that. I never saw that in my age. It
[2:00:39] hurt.
[2:00:42] But in this age, we've got children
[2:00:45] cutting themselves.
[2:00:48] Now, a prophet was in the 50s screaming
[2:00:51] out these things against television.
[2:00:55] Now, we're in an age and and they're
[2:00:57] they're they're they're actually
[2:00:59] exhibiting the same characteristics as
[2:01:01] the man at Gadie. He cut himself. When
[2:01:04] they bound him with chains, he would
[2:01:06] break the power of those chains. He
[2:01:09] attacked everybody that come along.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; He lived out in the graveyard and the
[2:01:16] devil stripped him naked.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham
[2:01:23] in a prayer he said this. He said, "I
[2:01:26] can remember back in the early days of
[2:01:27] my boyhood how that night I was
[2:01:30] hungering and I felt you knock at my
[2:01:33] door. I'm so glad I let you in. Now I'm
[2:01:35] a middle-aged man. I just love you more
[2:01:37] than I ever loved you in my life. Oh
[2:01:40] God, never let nothing happen. If I
[2:01:42] can't serve you, take me now. Let me go
[2:01:45] now. What a joy it is and a privilege uh
[2:01:48] to serve God. Give it to these young
[2:01:50] people, Lord. They got an awful battle.
[2:01:54] Look at them. Look at what they got.
[2:01:56] Look at their television. Rotten and
[2:01:58] polluted. So here's a prophet. He he he
[2:02:02] knows what's h he could see down the
[2:02:04] road what's going to take place
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; and he knows that these children are
[2:02:08] going to grow up to be next generation
[2:02:12] and he's praying for them. God give it
[2:02:15] to these young people. Let them have a
[2:02:18] joy and a privilege of serving God.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; They got an awful battle. Look at them.
[2:02:24] Look what they got. Look at their
[2:02:25] television. Rotten and polluted. Look at
[2:02:27] the nation. They're coming up in here.
[2:02:30] See, politics rotten to the core. The
[2:02:32] antichrist arising and seating power.
[2:02:34] The world, American people don't know
[2:02:36] what a struggle is. They don't know uh
[2:02:39] how to do without. They never had to
[2:02:41] miss a meal. Oh god, just look. Glamour
[2:02:43] and Hollywood. And it's eventually got
[2:02:45] into assemblyline religion in the
[2:02:48] churches and streamlined Hollywood. No
[2:02:50] more old-fashioned all night prayer
[2:02:52] meetings and agonizing and praying and
[2:02:54] having fellowship around the things of
[2:02:56] God. No more praying through God. These
[2:02:59] children need that.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; I'm going to continue on for just a few
[2:03:06] more moments.
[2:03:08] Brother Brandman place says there's one
[2:03:10] there's only 1% of Russia that's
[2:03:12] communism. 1% but they're the
[2:03:16] controlling percent. And he says in 1%
[2:03:19] of Russia rather they control. And the
[2:03:22] same thing Hollywood's only one place
[2:03:24] but they're in control. Another place he
[2:03:27] says the world through television,
[2:03:28] through radio, through picture shows and
[2:03:31] those outlets there has corrupted this
[2:03:34] nation with the Tommy rod of Hollywood.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what what a prophet
[2:03:41] told the young people. He said, "Listen,
[2:03:43] young man, young lady, just as soon as
[2:03:45] you get out from under the Christian
[2:03:47] influence, you're in bad hands. You're
[2:03:49] on your road right then. Your road back
[2:03:52] right then." Remember that. Just as soon
[2:03:55] as you get uh from under the influence
[2:03:58] of the Holy Spirit, I don't care who the
[2:04:00] boy is or the or who the girl is, if
[2:04:03] they're not saved, keep away from them.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; Why? It's influence.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; I ain't going to keep you much longer.
[2:04:12] But notice now what a writer said. and
[2:04:14] and he says, "Now, television has
[2:04:17] profoundly impacted American society and
[2:04:20] culture since its widespread adoption in
[2:04:23] the 1950s, influencing politics,
[2:04:26] consumer behavior, social norms, and
[2:04:30] family life.
[2:04:32] By the 1950s, most American households
[2:04:36] owned a television, fundamentally
[2:04:39] altering how people spent their free
[2:04:41] time and how businesses marketed
[2:04:43] products. The rise of TV advertising
[2:04:47] played a crucial role in promoting
[2:04:50] consumerism with studies showing that
[2:04:52] television access during the post-war
[2:04:55] era led to increased retail sales
[2:04:58] particularly in durable goods like
[2:05:00] automobiles aligning with the theories
[2:05:02] of cons uh conspicuous consumption. This
[2:05:06] shift helped embed a na national ethus
[2:05:10] uh of consumption into the American
[2:05:12] dream which was further popularized by
[2:05:15] sitcoms depicting idealized idolized
[2:05:19] suburban family life.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; Television also transformed the
[2:05:26] political landscape. The 1960
[2:05:29] presidential debates between John F.
[2:05:31] Kennedy and Richardson were the first to
[2:05:33] be televised, highlighting the medium's
[2:05:35] power in shaping public perception.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; We go on down. Major historical events
[2:05:44] were brought into the living rooms
[2:05:46] through live broadcast, uniting the
[2:05:48] nation during moments of triumph and
[2:05:50] tragedy. Americans watched Dr. Martin
[2:05:53] Luther King Jr.'s years. I have a dream
[2:05:55] speech in 1963, the assassination of
[2:05:58] President Kennedy, Neil Armstrong's moon
[2:06:01] landing in 1969, creating shared
[2:06:04] national experiences.
[2:06:07] So, socially, television both reflected
[2:06:10] and shaped attitudes on race, gender,
[2:06:13] and class. Initially, programming under
[2:06:16] uh represented uh uh minorities and
[2:06:20] reinforced stereotypes, but civil rights
[2:06:23] movement coverage helped shift public
[2:06:25] opinion toward equality.
[2:06:29] So
[2:06:31] one writer says TV is a constant
[2:06:33] presence in most Americans life
[2:06:38] with its fastm moving visually
[2:06:41] interesting highly entertaining style.
[2:06:44] It compa it commands many people's
[2:06:47] attention for several hours each day.
[2:06:52] Studies have shown that television
[2:06:54] competes with other sources of human
[2:06:56] interaction such as family, friends,
[2:06:58] church, and school in helping young
[2:07:01] people develop values and form ideas
[2:07:04] about the world around them. It also
[2:07:06] influences uh a viewers attitudes and
[2:07:09] beliefs about themselves as well as
[2:07:11] about people from other social, ethnic
[2:07:14] and and cultural uh backgrounds.
[2:07:18] So it says between the 1940s and 2000
[2:07:21] commercial television had a profound and
[2:07:24] wide-ranging impact on American society
[2:07:26] and culture. It influenced the way the
[2:07:28] people thought about such important
[2:07:31] social issues as race, gender, and
[2:07:33] class. Right?
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; It played an important role in the
[2:07:37] political process particularly in
[2:07:39] shaping national election campaigns. On
[2:07:43] and on and on. So we we see. But the
[2:07:47] other day I did a a a comparison of what
[2:07:51] home life was like back in the 50s to
[2:07:54] what it is today.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; And I'd like to read some of these
[2:07:58] things to you and
[2:08:01] I promise you I'll let you go.
[2:08:05] But it says women in the 1950s and and
[2:08:10] this will probably be a little bit um uh
[2:08:14] controversial
[2:08:15] uh to maybe to someone watching or some
[2:08:21] of you youngans or whatever. Hopefully
[2:08:23] not you elders, but uh you youngans, but
[2:08:27] we we'll we'll read it. uh and and this
[2:08:30] is just from what people have said about
[2:08:34] the change and the studies and all that.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; Women in the 1950s were often defined by
[2:08:42] so societal expectations that centered
[2:08:45] on the role of the homemaker and mother
[2:08:49] with most married women staying at home
[2:08:50] and to raise children and manage the
[2:08:52] household while men were considered the
[2:08:54] primary bread winners and heads of the
[2:08:57] family. Right.
[2:08:58] Another writer says, "In the in the
[2:09:01] 1950s, the do the the dominant societal
[2:09:04] expectation for women in the United
[2:09:07] States was to be a homemaker mother with
[2:09:09] her primary primary role centered on the
[2:09:13] domestic sphere. This ideal was heavily
[2:09:17] promoted through media, advertising,
[2:09:20] government propaganda, which portrayed
[2:09:22] the nuclear family as the cornerstone of
[2:09:24] American society and a symbol of
[2:09:27] superiority over communism. Women were
[2:09:30] often expected to marry young, have
[2:09:32] large families, and prioritize their
[2:09:34] husbands and children's needs above
[2:09:37] their own. Right.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; Gender, another gender roles in the
[2:09:43] United States have undergone significant
[2:09:46] transformation from the 1950s to today,
[2:09:49] shifting from rigid traditional
[2:09:51] expectations to a more fluid and diverse
[2:09:54] range of roles. In the 1950s, the ideal
[2:09:57] family structure was the nuclear family,
[2:10:00] consisting of a white middleclass
[2:10:02] working father, a stay-at-home mother
[2:10:04] with their children, with women expected
[2:10:07] to prioritize uh domestic duties and
[2:10:09] motherhood. Women were often pressured
[2:10:12] to leave the workforce after World War
[2:10:14] II despite having filled critical roles
[2:10:17] during and were largely uh confined to
[2:10:21] jobs like secretaries, nurses, uh
[2:10:24] teachers, often learning less than men
[2:10:27] or earning less than men. The societal
[2:10:30] expectation was for women to marry
[2:10:32] young, remain virgins until married. the
[2:10:36] focus on being and focus on being a
[2:10:38] homemaker while men were seen as the
[2:10:41] primary breadwinners and protectors.
[2:10:44] Today these roles have evolved
[2:10:46] considerably considerably. Women now
[2:10:49] make up nearly half of the US workforce
[2:10:53] a significant increase from less than
[2:10:55] onethird in 1950 and are more likely to
[2:10:59] hold advanced degrees than men. Women
[2:11:02] have gained greater control over their
[2:11:04] lives, including reproductive choices
[2:11:07] through the use of contraception, which
[2:11:10] began to grow in the 1950s and was later
[2:11:13] FDA approved. This autonomy uh was has
[2:11:17] allowed women to pursue careers,
[2:11:19] personal goals beyond traditional
[2:11:22] domestic roles. Men, meanwhile, are
[2:11:25] increasingly involved in child care,
[2:11:28] household responsibilities, with some
[2:11:30] choosing to be stay-at-home parents,
[2:11:32] reflecting a more shared approach to
[2:11:35] family life. What a change, eh?
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; Women have come a long ways. One writer
[2:11:40] says, "Women have come a long ways in
[2:11:42] the last 50 years. Today women are
[2:11:44] getting married later, giving birth
[2:11:46] later in life and they make up 50% of
[2:11:49] the workforce and also have tremendously
[2:11:51] shifted the roles in family. There have
[2:11:54] been dramatic changes in how men and
[2:11:56] women look at their lives and what
[2:11:58] they're doing. Uh Barnett's lecture
[2:12:01] women's journal journey uh toward
[2:12:03] equality where we are and the path ahead
[2:12:07] discussed how traditional gender roles
[2:12:09] have changed. sub uh sub uh subsequently
[2:12:14] uh freeing women to engage in life
[2:12:17] outside the home. Women's lives are
[2:12:19] today are dramatically different from
[2:12:21] those of their mothers and grandmothers.
[2:12:23] Women are making choices that will
[2:12:25] prepare them for longer lives. A a
[2:12:27] significant labor force participation
[2:12:30] with marriage and children knowing that
[2:12:32] they are contributing to their own
[2:12:34] economic well-being. getting more
[2:12:36] education and proving themselves in
[2:12:39] well-paying employment. On the same
[2:12:41] note, men's roles have also changed.
[2:12:45] She said men having more
[2:12:47] responsibilities in the home and in
[2:12:48] caring for the children and the majority
[2:12:51] of men now rank having free time with
[2:12:53] family as one of the most important
[2:12:55] factors choosing their employment.
[2:12:58] Now,
[2:13:00] there was a TV show in the 1950s
[2:13:04] that had a great impact upon the home
[2:13:08] life in America. How many knows what
[2:13:11] that was?
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; I love Susy. Yeah.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:13:18] someone just told me uh I was in a or
[2:13:20] not Africa uh uh Alaska and someone said
[2:13:24] that they were talking I think to to one
[2:13:27] of the children Brandham children and
[2:13:30] they asked him why did brother Brandham
[2:13:33] always call it I love Susy or I love
[2:13:36] whatever. He never would call it I love
[2:13:38] Lucy and said did he really not remember
[2:13:41] that? He goes all he knew it. He said he
[2:13:43] refused to say it.
[2:13:45] So he would say, "I love Susy. I love
[2:13:48] this." But here's what they say. The
[2:13:51] show I Love Lucy significantly impacted
[2:13:54] perceptions of home life
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; by challenging the idealized image of
[2:14:00] the 1950s housewife. Unlike the happy
[2:14:04] homemakers portrayed on other shows,
[2:14:06] Lucy Ricardo was depicted as a restless,
[2:14:09] ambitious woman who frequently rebelled
[2:14:13] against the confines of domestic life,
[2:14:16] seeking fulfillment beyond cooking and
[2:14:18] house work. Her attempts to enter the
[2:14:21] public sphere through jobs,
[2:14:23] performances, or schemes highlighted the
[2:14:26] absurd restrictions placed on women.
[2:14:29] Notice absurd restrictions placed on
[2:14:32] women in a male dominated society,
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; making her character a symbol of the
[2:14:38] era's shifting social dynamics. The
[2:14:43] show's portrayal of Lucy's pregnancy and
[2:14:46] the birth of her son, Little Ricky, was
[2:14:48] a groundbreaking moment that blurred the
[2:14:50] lines between her onscreen persona and
[2:14:54] Lucille Ball's real life experience.
[2:14:57] this event uh broadcast the her ha
[2:15:01] actually her having a child was
[2:15:03] broadcast
[2:15:05] live
[2:15:06] uh
[2:15:08] and so I'm sure they didn't show
[2:15:10] everything but they did but this event
[2:15:13] broadcast live to an estimated 44
[2:15:17] million viewers
[2:15:21] 44 million
[2:15:24] uh was a occasion that resonated deeply
[2:15:28] with audiences, transforming their
[2:15:30] private act of childbirth into a public
[2:15:34] celebration.
[2:15:36] The episode Lucy Goes to the Hospital
[2:15:38] became a cultural milestone reflecting
[2:15:42] changing attitudes toward motherhood and
[2:15:45] family life. Furthermore, the show's
[2:15:48] depiction of the Ricardo's evolving
[2:15:50] family life from living in New York City
[2:15:52] to eventually moving to a country home
[2:15:54] in Connecticut mirrored the suburban
[2:15:56] migration of many f American families
[2:15:59] during the post-war era. By showcasing a
[2:16:03] dynamic where the wife's ambition often
[2:16:05] clashed with her domestic role, I Love
[2:16:09] Lucy offered a nuisent
[2:16:12] nuisanced
[2:16:14] if ultimately conservative narrative
[2:16:17] about home life where Lucy's rebellions
[2:16:20] were usually thwarted and she returned
[2:16:23] to her domestic duties by the next
[2:16:25] episode.
[2:16:28] One writer said, "On the surface, Lucy
[2:16:30] Ricardo didn't fit the societal norms of
[2:16:33] the day." As Betty Freriedman wrote in
[2:16:36] her 1963 classic, The Feminine Mystic,
[2:16:39] "The American Housewife was healthy,
[2:16:41] beautiful, educated, concerned only
[2:16:44] about her husband, her children, her
[2:16:46] home. Happy homemakers could be found on
[2:16:48] every network from the patient mom uh
[2:16:52] Margaret Anderson of Father Knows Best
[2:16:55] to the profoundly agreeable June Clever
[2:16:57] of Leave it to Beaver. Instead, on I
[2:17:00] Love Lucy, Lucy was a hot mess. There
[2:17:04] was something comforting and even
[2:17:06] liberating about her inability to
[2:17:09] control her urges. She and Ricky became
[2:17:12] America's favorite TV husband and wife.
[2:17:15] Starting from the first season, Lucy
[2:17:17] performed a wide range of routines that
[2:17:20] effortlessly balanced comedy with
[2:17:22] sentiment and questioned the roles of
[2:17:25] men and women.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; "There is no doubt that Lucille Ball
[2:17:28] created a whole new audience for
[2:17:30] watching television," said actress Carol
[2:17:33] Bernett. "She took you on some kind of
[2:17:36] wild journey over those 22 minutes, and
[2:17:38] you could not wait to see what else she
[2:17:40] was cooking up." Americans turned in
[2:17:42] droves. Within 6 months, the audience
[2:17:44] reached 11 million with I Love Lucy
[2:17:47] attracting 67 of every hundred 9:00
[2:17:53] movie night viewers.
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; That year, I Love Lucy was nominated for
[2:17:57] an Emmy award for the best comedy show.
[2:18:00] And on May 26, 1952,
[2:18:03] Lucy graced the cover of Time with the
[2:18:05] headline, Lucille Ball, RX for TV, a
[2:18:09] clown with glamour.
[2:18:13] So we see brother Brandham in 1959,
[2:18:16] brother Brandham said there just seems
[2:18:18] to be something wrong somewhere and
[2:18:20] people are reaching for something and
[2:18:22] can't find it. That's a pitiful
[2:18:24] condition to be in.
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; They've looked everywhere to find
[2:18:29] something to make themselves an example.
[2:18:32] They're wanting an example to make.
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; They've looked everywhere. We take the
[2:18:38] women of our days. They'll watch
[2:18:40] television until they see a certain
[2:18:42] movie star or she'll come out dressed in
[2:18:45] a certain way and all the women will
[2:18:47] want to dress like her or act like her,
[2:18:50] make her the example.
[2:18:53] &gt;&gt; Some pretty girls just in the bloom of
[2:18:55] life will try to pattern themselves and
[2:18:57] try to make some movie star an example
[2:19:00] that they should go by and finally they
[2:19:03] find themselves wound up in a cage of
[2:19:06] sin that they can't get out of. What a
[2:19:09] pity seeing them coming into the
[2:19:11] meeting, tears running down their
[2:19:13] cheeks, but they're hunting for
[2:19:15] something as the musicians come. Give
[2:19:18] you a little hope.
[2:19:23] Another article
[2:19:26] it says on Monday, October 15, 1951,
[2:19:30] Love Lucy made its debut
[2:19:33] on the CBS television network, which
[2:19:37] then consisted of a few big stations and
[2:19:40] 74 local affiliates. There was a
[2:19:43] consolid There was a solid competition
[2:19:45] on NBC in the same 900 PM time slot from
[2:19:50] Lights On a top 10 television version of
[2:19:53] the original radio classic Lucy. So the
[2:19:56] critics predicted it didn't stand a
[2:19:58] chance.
[2:20:00] The first episode to air preceded by the
[2:20:03] many uh Philip's cigarette commercials
[2:20:07] was tilted. The girls want to go to a
[2:20:09] nightclub.
[2:20:12] He said it's the it's the Mert's
[2:20:16] 18th wedding wedding wedding anniversary
[2:20:18] and Ethel wants to celebrate by to the
[2:20:22] cup
[2:20:24] going somewhere
[2:20:26] while Fred itches to attend the fights.
[2:20:29] An argument ensues,
[2:20:32] culminating
[2:20:33] with Ethal, Ethel, and Lucy informing
[2:20:37] Fred and Ricky they'll go clubbing.
[2:20:41] They'll go nightclubing without them
[2:20:43] with dates.
[2:20:47] Admitting to themselves that perhaps
[2:20:49] they were too hasty, the men decide to
[2:20:51] sneak into the Copa
[2:20:54] with dates of their own
[2:20:56] just to keep an eye on their wives.
[2:20:59] Ricky calls his friend Jenny Jones, a
[2:21:02] singer at the Starlight Roof, and ask
[2:21:04] her to arrange dates for Fred and
[2:21:06] himself. and Lucy ah very soon
[2:21:10] thereafter calls her uh
[2:21:14] to arrange dates for her and Ethel. When
[2:21:17] Jenny spills the boy's plans to Lucy,
[2:21:20] Lucy decides that she and Ethel will
[2:21:22] impersonate their husband's blind dates.
[2:21:24] Dressed as country bumpkins, Lucille and
[2:21:27] Ethel arrive at the Ricardo apartment
[2:21:30] after Ricky sings a course of uh Guada
[2:21:33] Jara, whatever, some funny hillbilly uh
[2:21:37] uh uh stick unfolds until Lucy gives
[2:21:41] herself away by reaching for some
[2:21:42] cigarettes hidden in a desk drawer. All
[2:21:45] is forgiven and the two couples kiss and
[2:21:48] makeup in the tag. men prevail and it's
[2:21:52] night at the fights for the anniversary
[2:21:54] celebration.
[2:21:57] So we find and I've got lot more here
[2:21:59] but I I don't want to waste spend most
[2:22:02] your time but
[2:22:05] we find that there had to be a a root
[2:22:10] something so
[2:22:13] funny. It's funny if you watch it, it
[2:22:17] seems so simple,
[2:22:20] but look where it's brought us to.
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; Look where it's brought the nation.
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; So,
[2:22:28] what I'm saying there's influences and
[2:22:30] church.
[2:22:34] We're going home.
[2:22:36] [Music]
[2:22:39] We got to stay separated from the
[2:22:41] influences of the world. Cuz remember
[2:22:44] the prophet tells us again Leosa is
[2:22:48] blacked out.
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:51] &gt;&gt; Her influence does not come from the
[2:22:54] sen.
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; It ain't coming from the sen light.
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; It's coming from the pits of hell.
[2:23:05] The powers of darkness
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; that our influence must come from the
[2:23:13] sen
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; light. Can you say amen?
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; No wonder brother Brandham cried out,
[2:23:20] get back to Pentecost. And he said that
[2:23:23] several times.
[2:23:25] He says the Virgin Mary was under the
[2:23:27] influence of the Holy Ghost staggering
[2:23:29] like somebody drunk.
[2:23:32] She she wasn't under all this other
[2:23:34] influence. Are you with me? She she kept
[2:23:38] herself and and and she come under the
[2:23:41] influence of the Holy Ghost. And what
[2:23:43] did the Holy Ghost do? It made her so
[2:23:46] drunk and and to where she just lost her
[2:23:49] her mind with the world and every
[2:23:53] brother Brown said, "You get drunk on
[2:23:54] the Holy Ghost, you you won't be bitter
[2:23:56] and and you won't be mad and and and and
[2:23:59] and you won't carry the grudges and you
[2:24:01] won't desire the world. You're just so
[2:24:04] lost in the presence of God." Brother
[2:24:07] Brandham says, "Once in the presence of
[2:24:08] God, you'll feel so little and no
[2:24:11] account." Paul realized that he was
[2:24:14] wrong and he fell to the ground under
[2:24:16] the influence and power. When he looked
[2:24:18] up and seen the God that he had been
[2:24:21] preaching against and thought he knowed
[2:24:24] and and seen that he was wrong, he fell
[2:24:27] from his feet to the ground because he
[2:24:29] was in the presence of God. Can you say
[2:24:33] amen? In the presence of God. Amen. See,
[2:24:37] he said that's the same way in another
[2:24:39] place. That's the same way that an
[2:24:40] unbeliever sinner is everlaid in the
[2:24:43] presence of almighty God under the
[2:24:45] influence of the Holy Ghost. He becomes
[2:24:47] a new creature. Right? Then his life
[2:24:50] becomes fruitful, fresh. Life comes in
[2:24:52] and he yields what he was supposed to be
[2:24:55] a son of God.
[2:24:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:00] [Music]
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; One last quote. He says, "Let us let's
[2:25:06] let's let's let let's let let's let
[2:25:08] let's let let's let let's let let's let
[2:25:08] let's let let's let let's let let's let
[2:25:09] the Holy Spirit influence us to the word
[2:25:11] of God.
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; Let's let God do the influence in our
[2:25:15] heart and not be influenced by others."
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; Is that the way you want to be?
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; That's certainly what I want to be.
[2:25:24] Amen. Church message has the fluence.
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; It It'll influence your faith. It'll
[2:25:30] influence your love. It'll influence
[2:25:33] your joy. It it it it brings marriages
[2:25:36] together. It it brings families
[2:25:39] together. It it it it it'll bring the
[2:25:42] lost loved ones back. I believe that.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; I believe that.
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; Hey, bless the Lord. Surround
[2:25:58] me,
[2:26:00] oh Lord.
[2:26:01] [Applause]
[2:26:03] Oh, surround
[2:26:06] me,
[2:26:08] oh Lord.
[2:26:11] Oh, surround
[2:26:15] me,
[2:26:17] oh Lord.
[2:26:20] And let your spirit
[2:26:23] fill
[2:26:25] this place. Sing it again. Oh surround.
[2:26:31] I want him to surround
[2:26:34] our whole.
[2:26:37] I want his presence to dwell in his
[2:26:39] home. I I want angels to come and feel
[2:26:43] welcome in my home. Influence my heart.
[2:26:46] Influence my thoughts.
[2:26:51] Oh, that's what we want. You husbands,
[2:26:53] when you're out at work and you're
[2:26:55] dealing with things and these spirits,
[2:26:57] come into that home.
[2:27:00] [Music]
[2:27:01] It's a sanctuary. The God dwells there
[2:27:05] cuz you made your home a sanct.
[2:27:09] You're not letting all these other
[2:27:11] influences come in. And while you're at
[2:27:14] work and the wife's on the television,
[2:27:16] children watching all this stuff,
[2:27:19] Satan raping their minds and taking the
[2:27:23] the power of the word away from them and
[2:27:26] destroying it.
[2:27:29] Oh, it's a sanctuary.
[2:27:32] Is that what you want, church? Oh,
[2:27:36] surround
[2:27:37] [Music]
[2:27:38] me.
[2:27:42] Bless the name of the Lord surround.
[2:27:46] [Music]
[2:27:49] I say God bless you mothers that are
[2:27:51] still holding the tradition traditional
[2:27:55] values.
[2:27:58] Bless you fathers for holding to
[2:28:00] traditional values.
[2:28:02] You're not letting motherhood be in your
[2:28:05] home.
[2:28:07] You're not letting the fatherhood be
[2:28:09] broken.
[2:28:13] The message of the hour is bringing us
[2:28:15] back the way God wanted it. God desired
[2:28:18] it. We ain't letting the television and
[2:28:21] and and Hollywood shape our families and
[2:28:25] shape our children and our marriages.
[2:28:29] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:28:32] God bless you. Surround
[2:28:37] me,
[2:28:38] oh Lord,
[2:28:41] and let your presence. Can we just stand
[2:28:45] to our feet? Sing it. Sing it as a
[2:28:48] prayer. Oh, surround
[2:28:53] me,
[2:28:55] oh Lord.
[2:28:58] Jesus, surround me.
[2:29:03] Hallelujah.
[2:29:06] Oh, surround
[2:29:09] me,
[2:29:11] oh Lord,
[2:29:13] [Music]
[2:29:14] and let your presence
[2:29:17] fill
[2:29:19] this place. Sing the last lines.
[2:29:22] And let your presence
[2:29:25] fill
[2:29:27] this place.
[2:29:31] You love the Lord.
[2:29:34] God is so wonderful to us.
[2:29:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. I appreciate your patience and
[2:29:41] um I pray it was a help to you in some
[2:29:43] way and especially for you young people.
[2:29:48] Amen. Stay holy to God.
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; Stay separated.
[2:29:53] The more you stay under that influence
[2:29:55] and come under the influence of the Holy
[2:29:57] Ghost, the world will lose its hoe.
[2:30:01] you you just won't want to go that way.
[2:30:05] And I I'll be honest, I'm I'm so glad
[2:30:07] that I had a mom and dad that prayed.
[2:30:11] So glad I had a mom and dad
[2:30:14] that loved the Lord and kept standards
[2:30:17] in the home.
[2:30:19] They they entertained the angel of God.
[2:30:23] And and I tell you, when I got out, you
[2:30:25] know, with uh things out in the world or
[2:30:29] especially as a teenager, I'd come home
[2:30:33] and I knew the difference.
[2:30:36] I knew there was something real in that
[2:30:38] home.
[2:30:41] I'm so glad. Parents, let's make our
[2:30:45] home a house for the Lord.
[2:30:48] Let him be our influence.
