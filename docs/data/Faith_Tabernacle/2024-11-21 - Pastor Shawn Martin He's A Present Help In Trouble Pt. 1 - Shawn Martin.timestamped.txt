[38:07] were ex given the reasons why you know
[38:12] America uh is
[38:14] not uh it's going to prosper and things
[38:17] and uh the individuals said it's because
[38:21] God is good he's merciful you know and
[38:24] he's uh not a god of judgment but we
[38:28] know that he's
[38:29] good uh but he's a god of judgment amen
[38:33] and I I see God is being good because he
[38:37] saved my soul I see as being good
[38:41] because he's answered our prayer and and
[38:44] he's made the preparation for us to
[38:46] leave this whole world amen amen and um

[40:21] Psalms uh the
[40:23] 46th

[40:38] strength a very present help in
[40:43] trouble
[40:45] therefore will not we
[40:48] fear though the Earth is removed and
[40:51] though the mountains be carried into the
[40:55] midst of the sea

[43:04] this
[43:05] evening um but I like what David said
[43:10] and uh just been thinking on that uh is
[43:15] that God God is a present help in
[43:18] trouble in the time of trouble God is a
[43:22] present help and so if he is a present
[43:26] help then and he's not a god of
[43:30] History so we we we must not treat him
[43:35] as such or make him as as just a
[43:40] historical God uh the the the scripture
[43:45] uh Hebrews 13 and8 has been uh made very
[43:50] very clear to us that he Jesus Christ is
[43:53] the same yesterday today and forever
[43:57] throughout the Bible we have seen God as
[44:01] being uh a present help for his
[44:05] people um when when they needed
[44:09] protection God was a present help when
[44:12] uh Israel needed a deliverer God was a
[44:17] present help when uh they needed mercy
[44:22] God was a present help when they needed
[44:24] an atonement or uh when they needed a
[44:29] token uh God was a present help God's
[44:32] always been a a a present help even even
[44:37] when when we look at uh Rahab the Harlot
[44:42] uh needing Redemption needing that mercy
[44:46] God was a present help amen and and it's
[44:50] it's been this way when Israel needed a
[44:53] way of Escape God was a present help and
[44:57] he's always been there he's not not as a
[45:01] bystander not just as one that looks on
[45:04] and sees the need and and yet does
[45:07] nothing about it like a lot of folks do
[45:10] today uh get out their camera as there
[45:12] someone's getting beat up or something
[45:15] and uh they they're just the bystander
[45:17] you know but God God's never been that
[45:19] way to his people but he's he's always
[45:23] been there as a a present help you know
[45:26] it's one thing to be there and then not
[45:29] being able to help or uh or not taking
[45:34] the action to to do anything but that's
[45:38] not God and and this this whole this
[45:41] Bible is is God in action and and
[45:46] anytime that we have seen God's people
[45:48] in trouble amen God has always been
[45:52] there to to to help them to to bring
[45:55] them through to deliver them uh uh and
[45:59] and and these things you know and and
[46:02] and so God is a present help in every
[46:06] situation you know we we you may have
[46:09] problems maybe you have a plumbing
[46:11] problem and you're you know you got to
[46:13] you got to call the the plumber and and
[46:16] maybe he can get to you maybe he can't
[46:18] or if you're having the electrical
[46:20] problem you're going to call the
[46:21] electrician if you're if you're needing
[46:24] mechanic work done you're you're going
[46:25] to you're going to call the mechanic and
[46:28] and these things or if you're needing
[46:31] the doctor then then you'd go to the
[46:33] doctor uh uh for him to to help you and
[46:38] and we we've got all kinds of of of of
[46:42] professions if we could call it that
[46:44] that that can help us in in in times uh
[46:49] when we're needing a uh uh uh the things
[46:53] done I I if if we could say it that way
[46:56] but yet and and we're thankful for these
[46:59] things I'm thankful for the doctor I'm
[47:00] thankful for the mechanic I'm thankful
[47:03] you know but I'm thankful for the
[47:05] plumber I'm I'm thankful for you know
[47:08] all of the the the the the things that
[47:11] you know people do but yet they they
[47:13] only work within the natural rim and
[47:17] they're they're Limited in in what they
[47:20] can do and and we all I I'm sure um have
[47:26] been
[47:27] disappointed by Humanity in some way or
[47:31] another uh uh and maybe they've not been
[47:35] able to fix things they've might not
[47:37] been able to help and even though they
[47:40] might have tried to help and even though
[47:41] they might have done done their their
[47:44] best and and yet uh uh we end up
[47:47] disappointed but you know when you need
[47:49] a
[47:50] miracle uh then who are you going to
[47:53] call who who are you going to go to you
[47:56] know there there's no man that can
[47:58] perform a miracle no doctor can perform
[48:01] a miracle no no uh no Banker no no
[48:05] lawyer no no nothing they they can't
[48:08] perform the miracle no no politician is
[48:12] a miracle worker it's just you know when
[48:14] when you're when you need spiritual help
[48:17] uh well then who are you going to call
[48:20] um you know I know that God works
[48:22] through man and he works through you
[48:24] know the the ministry and and he works
[48:27] through individuals um maybe to help but
[48:31] but you know you you when you look to a
[48:34] man when you when you look uh to any man
[48:38] as the main source of help then then
[48:41] that would be wrong because even a
[48:43] preacher can disappoint you even even
[48:46] mom and dad can dis disappoint you the
[48:49] musicians can disappoint the sound guys
[48:52] can disappoint and and and and you know
[48:55] all all of these things and so uh uh we
[48:58] we know that we can't look just to man
[49:01] in itself and even us we we disappoint
[49:05] ourselves and and uh uh if if you
[49:08] haven't disappointed yourself you might
[49:11] have an ego problem uh you know uh there
[49:15] but I I think if if we could all just
[49:18] admit it that we we have disappointed
[49:21] ourselves we've come short many times
[49:24] but but we we find that that uh people
[49:28] can look to a minister as though that he
[49:32] is the one to fix their problems and
[49:34] work a miracle and people look to
[49:37] doctors as though they're the absolute
[49:39] and and what their word says is the the
[49:42] the it's it's the thing if they say I'm
[49:45] dying I'm dying you know if they say I'm
[49:47] going to get better well I'm going to
[49:48] get better if they say not do this or to
[49:51] do this and and all of that and you know
[49:54] uh there there's so many things out
[49:57] there uh that uh that that are you know
[50:01] treated as though they're it's the
[50:03] absolute it's the thing but really
[50:07] nothing here is the absolute nothing
[50:10] here can can is is the the thing that
[50:13] can fix the problems but you know uh uh
[50:17] Psalms 20 and7 it says some trust in uh
[50:21] chariots and some trust in horses and in
[50:25] in other words what it's saying is some
[50:28] trust in in man some trust in hospitals
[50:32] some trust in doctors some trust in
[50:34] lawyers some trust in in themselves some
[50:38] trust in the church some trust you you
[50:41] understand what I'm saying amen some
[50:43] trust uh in in in different things but
[50:46] we and and and and we'll put we as the
[50:49] elect of God we the elect will remember
[50:54] or trust in the name of the Lord Our God
[50:59] Amen see because he is the present help
[51:03] in time of trouble amen see uh there
[51:06] there's no David wasn't exalting himself
[51:09] he wasn't exalting the military he
[51:12] wasn't exalting uh government and he
[51:15] wasn't exalting doctors and and all
[51:18] these things uh but what he was saying
[51:21] is God is the present help in time of
[51:25] trouble uh uh Proverbs 18 And1 says the
[51:29] name of the Lord is a strong tower the
[51:32] righteous again the elect the righteous
[51:35] run into it and and is safe ain't that
[51:39] right and so God uh um in this age of
[51:43] humanity in this age of scientific
[51:46] achievement in this in this age where
[51:49] man is being exalted and and the works
[51:53] of man and all of these things Jeremiah
[51:56] 3 33 would tell us uh God would be
[51:59] speaking to us through that Prophet call
[52:01] unto me and I will answer thee call unto
[52:06] me and I will answer now I I believe
[52:10] that God answers prayers do you believe
[52:12] that I'm not just saying it because I'm
[52:14] a Christian I'm not just saying it
[52:16] because someone else told me i' I've
[52:18] seen it happen I I've I've seen uh you
[52:21] know uh uh God answered my mother's
[52:24] prayer uh when I was a child many times
[52:27] but I do remember a time now we were
[52:29] very poor dad worked at the school and
[52:33] and and we you know a lot of times
[52:35] didn't have uh uh you know uh money to
[52:39] make ends meet and and but uh one time
[52:42] the dryer quit working and we we we
[52:45] couldn't call that technician to come
[52:48] and fix the dryer or or to even buy a
[52:51] dryer and all that but my mom was a
[52:54] woman of faith and I I just remember
[52:56] laying her hand upon that dryer and she
[52:59] began to ask God to to make that thing
[53:02] work and you know uh when she got done
[53:04] praying she switched on that switch and
[53:07] it and the thing started working again
[53:10] uh uh but God answered her prayer
[53:12] because he's a present help in the time
[53:16] of of trouble uh you know Dad tells the
[53:19] story of when he run out of gas and he
[53:22] didn't have money to to get more and and
[53:25] and so he he prayed and and the truck
[53:28] wouldn't start before the prayer he
[53:30] tried to start it but but he just prayed
[53:32] and asked God to be merciful and to uh
[53:35] to help him get home and and he said
[53:39] right before his eyes that tank uh the
[53:41] gauge went from E to full God was a
[53:45] present help in time of trouble amen you
[53:49] you brother Andrew uh was telling me you
[53:52] know a couple months ago of how that
[53:54] when he was a boy and and you know uh he
[53:58] he lived with his mom uh most of the
[54:01] time and and and and they didn't have
[54:03] just a lot of money but they would went
[54:05] somewhere run out of gas didn't have the
[54:07] money to get gas and he said they both
[54:09] just bowed their head and prayed and God
[54:13] gave them a tank of gas because God is a
[54:17] present help in time of trouble I
[54:20] remember when Seth just a young uh boy
[54:23] and me and him was out selling shoes and
[54:26] it take me 2 hours to set up the the
[54:28] display of shoes and just got it all set

[54:37] trailer and Seth had his fingers on the
[54:39] side door and the wind blew and and I
[54:42] heard a just a uh the the door slam and
[54:46] uh then Seth started screaming and
[54:48] looked and his fingers was right caught
[54:50] in that door and opened the door and his
[54:53] his uh uh the the finger was broke and

[55:02] time to to get my shoe I couldn't leave
[55:04] my shoes there I was in a rough part of
[55:07] town and and that was my livelihood and
[55:10] so I I just said Seth you want you want
[55:13] Daddy to pray yeah I want you know and
[55:15] and so we took off our hats and we just
[55:17] began to pray and he when when just
[55:21] immediately he he stopped his crying and
[55:24] at the end of the prayer we looked and
[55:25] the fing finger was back straight and
[55:27] the the swelling went down the the the

[58:39] socket and doctor said she's going to
[58:41] need surgery and if she had surgery she

[1:00:04] and immediately the pain left she got

[1:00:08] with that again God was a present help
[1:00:11] in the time of need amen sister Brenda
[1:00:14] talking about how that she was diagnosed
[1:00:17] with something you went to the doctor
[1:00:18] she having some pain or something and

[1:00:31] course we don't take these things for
[1:00:33] granted amen and and and we we know what
[1:00:36] these things can be but uh so the the
[1:00:39] doctor was a little concerned and she
[1:00:41] come to get prayed for and and went back
[1:00:44] and the doctor couldn't even find
[1:00:45] anything that was wrong and it it was

[1:01:06] out and and you know the doctor gave her
[1:01:08] a clean bill of health and and and and
[1:01:11] whatever was going wrong amen God just
[1:01:14] totally took care of the problem because
[1:01:17] God is a present help in in the time of

[1:01:33] where you know where it's going to come
[1:01:35] from or what what what what do you do
[1:01:37] and all that and and you know I was
[1:01:39] telling the children the other night
[1:01:41] that any time that I ask God to supply
[1:01:44] my need God that I'll always get a call
[1:01:48] for the most part might take a day or
[1:01:49] two but but God will uh uh call somebody
[1:01:53] to call me amen for a stunt job they
[1:01:56] want to stunt ground and and God has
[1:01:59] always provided our needs be because he
[1:02:03] is a present help in in the time of need
[1:02:07] amen now we could all say it this way
[1:02:09] when we needed a savior God was a
[1:02:11] present help in in time uh of trouble
[1:02:15] when we needed mercy God was a present
[1:02:17] help when I've needed encouragement amen

[1:03:29] for people to forget God Amen they they
[1:03:32] get into trouble and and forget that God
[1:03:35] is a present help or or they just ignore
[1:03:38] God they just ignore the fact that that
[1:03:41] he is there amen and and it it reminds
[1:03:45] me of in second king uh the first
[1:03:48] chapter we read about King uh Isaiah I

[1:03:53] latus uh in his uh upper chamber Second

[1:04:47] down from that bed on which Thou Art
[1:04:50] gone up but shall surely die amen now
[1:04:53] you think of it that that king of isra
[1:04:56] Heen uh uh uh uh uh he he uh uh that
[1:05:02] that King there he saw more value in in
[1:05:07] that Idol amen which that's that's
[1:05:09] exactly what it was just an idol amen he
[1:05:12] saw more value in that Idol than he did
[1:05:14] the prophet of God Amen now you think of
[1:05:18] that amen see uh but there there uh was
[1:05:21] also another king ASA Amen in in first
[1:05:25] chronicles 16 and2 who trusted in
[1:05:29] another King instead of trusting in the
[1:05:32] Lord and in the second verse and he sent
[1:05:35] to uh this ASA uh he sent
[1:05:39] to Ben Hadad king of syah that dwelt at
[1:05:44] Damascus saying there is a league
[1:05:46] between me and thee as there was between
[1:05:48] my father and thy father behold I have
[1:05:52] sent thee silver and gold go break thy
[1:05:54] league with Basha uh uh king of Israel
[1:05:58] that he may depart from me now go into
[1:06:01] the seventh verse amen and at that time
[1:06:05] hanai Hann hanani or whatever the Seer
[1:06:08] or the prophet see came to ASAC king of
[1:06:12] Judah and said unto him because thou
[1:06:14] Hast relied on the king of Syria and not
[1:06:18] relied on the Lord thy God therefore is
[1:06:21] the host of the king of Syria escaped
[1:06:24] out of thine hand
[1:06:26] see we're not the Ethiopians and the
[1:06:28] lubans uh uh a huge host with very many
[1:06:32] chariots and Horsemen see where you know
[1:06:35] he said and yet because thou didst rely
[1:06:38] on the Lord he delivered them into thine
[1:06:41] hand he says for the eyes of the Lord
[1:06:44] run to and fro throughout the whole
[1:06:46] earth to show himself strong he's still
[1:06:50] doing it today he's running through and
[1:06:52] fr throughout the Earth to show himself
[1:06:56] strong can you say Amen in the behalf of
[1:06:59] them whose heart is perfect for toward
[1:07:02] him here in thou Hast done foolishly
[1:07:06] he's talking to a King now that did not
[1:07:08] trust in the Lord but trusted in another
[1:07:11] government Amen to take care of his
[1:07:13] problem amen so therefore from hence
[1:07:16] forth Thou shalt have wars then ASA was
[1:07:20] rought with the Seer with the prophet
[1:07:22] and put him in a prison house for he was
[1:07:24] in a r AG with him because of this thing
[1:07:27] and ASA oppressed some of the people the
[1:07:30] same time and behold the acts of Asa
[1:07:34] first and last Lo they are written in
[1:07:36] the books of the kings of Judah and
[1:07:39] Israel and ASA in the 3 and9th year of
[1:07:43] his Reign was diseased in his feet until
[1:07:47] his disease was exceedingly great now
[1:07:50] notice yet in his disease he sought not
[1:07:54] to the Lord but to the Physicians he
[1:07:57] never considered the Lord amen to to be
[1:08:01] his help to be his healer he sought the
[1:08:04] Physicians amen now think of it his
[1:08:06] disease got worse and and and worse and
[1:08:10] and yet he never took the time to
[1:08:12] acknowledge the Lord amen the prophet
[1:08:15] said this about this King ASA got a
[1:08:18] disease in his feet and he died with it
[1:08:20] because he did not ask the Lord for
[1:08:23] Divine Healing but he just went to the
[1:08:26] doctors alone can you say amen amen the
[1:08:29] moment you start looking to doctors and
[1:08:31] said of the Lord as your healer amen
[1:08:34] something's wrong amen it shows that you
[1:08:37] have departed from the Lord I'm I'm
[1:08:38] thankful for doctors amen but I'll never
[1:08:41] put a doctor over God can you say amen
[1:08:44] amen that's right see he just went to
[1:08:46] the doctors alone he couldn't ask the
[1:08:50] Lord for he was too stubborn see he just
[1:08:53] got to a place where he just begin to
[1:08:56] listen to some modernistic views and
[1:08:59] didn't believe maybe or didn't believe
[1:09:02] the Lord healed so he didn't consult the
[1:09:05] Lord nothing about it he thought well my
[1:09:08] doctors can help me and there's no need
[1:09:10] of asking anybody else oh my that's a
[1:09:13] pitiful condition can you say man amen
[1:09:16] when when we we looking at the doctors
[1:09:19] as our absolute amen and we'll let the
[1:09:21] doctor put fear in us we'll let the
[1:09:24] doctor rule our life
[1:09:26] amen when there's a God in heaven amen
[1:09:28] that is more than able to deliver
[1:09:30] there's there's a God in heaven that's
[1:09:32] more than able to preserve amen and
[1:09:35] bring us out can you say Amen see so if
[1:09:38] you notice this king's actions showed he
[1:09:42] didn't believe in Divine Healing and the
[1:09:43] prophet said it he didn't believe in
[1:09:45] Divine Healing he didn't believe that
[1:09:47] the Lord would answer his prayer he
[1:09:49] didn't believe that God would preserve
[1:09:52] him amen so he just trusted in the
[1:09:54] physici he trusted in the doctor but the
[1:09:57] doctor couldn't help him but he was too
[1:09:59] stubborn to simply just ask God God I
[1:10:02] need you can you say amen amen that's
[1:10:06] right now notice if if the king would
[1:10:09] have believed in Divine Healing if he
[1:10:11] would have believed in God and the ways
[1:10:14] of God you know what he would have done
[1:10:16] he would have went to the prophet that
[1:10:17] was in the land amen the prophet of God
[1:10:20] Amen let me ask you who did the
[1:10:22] shunamite woman go to when when her baby
[1:10:25] was laying there dead did she go to a
[1:10:27] physician did she go to a politician did
[1:10:29] she go to to whatever no she went to the
[1:10:32] prophet of God yes sir amen the prophet

[1:10:39] his leprosy it was a prophet of God he
[1:10:42] went he went to the prophet ain't that
[1:10:44] right amen how did God become a present
[1:10:47] help Amen to Israel when they were in
[1:10:50] Egypt amen God sent to them a prophet
[1:10:54] and God through that prophet's Ministry
[1:10:57] showed himself to be a present help in
[1:11:00] the time of
[1:11:01] need that's right you see the prophet
[1:11:04] says amen amen that that uh uh uh the
[1:11:08] prophet was God's representative amen
[1:11:11] now you know how how did God become a a
[1:11:14] present help in the time of need amen
[1:11:17] for the Widow of zerath you remember it
[1:11:20] was a time of famine amen and this lady
[1:11:23] was going to die she she had had her
[1:11:25] last meal prepared and then her and her
[1:11:28] son had already committed themselves uh
[1:11:32] that they they it was hopeless there was
[1:11:34] no help and there was nothing and and
[1:11:37] they were going to die amen but God was
[1:11:41] a present help to her in time of trouble
[1:11:45] by sending her a prophet amen with thus
[1:11:48] sayith the Lord and Elisha said the
[1:11:50] barrel of meal shall not waste neither
[1:11:53] shall the cruise of old fell until the
[1:11:56] day that the Lord sends rain upon the
[1:11:59] Earth can you say amen amen see she
[1:12:02] found that God was in his representative
[1:12:07] God was a help in time of
[1:12:10] trouble yes sir you see before Christ
[1:12:13] came God represented himself in the
[1:12:16] prophets Amen brother Bram said and
[1:12:19] God's obligated out of that channel amen
[1:12:23] out of the Prophet that Prophet is a
[1:12:24] channel channel to whom the word of the
[1:12:26] Lord comes to and out of that channel
[1:12:30] God is obligated to make that word come
[1:12:32] to pass just exactly the way it's
[1:12:35] promised the seed will grow so God
[1:12:38] represented himself in the prophets of
[1:12:40] the Old Testament then he represented
[1:12:43] himself in one man Jesus Christ amen for
[1:12:46] when Jesus was upon the Earth that was
[1:12:49] God in Christ and God showed himself to
[1:12:53] be a present help in the time of trouble
[1:12:56] when the blind would come to him when
[1:12:58] the lame would come to him when the when
[1:13:00] the when the uh the dead amen or
[1:13:04] whatever it would be look at Martha
[1:13:06] Martha when her brother Lazarus had been
[1:13:08] dead for 4 days in the grave already
[1:13:12] decaying amen but when Jesus walked into
[1:13:16] it it up up there amen uh uh uh Martha
[1:13:21] didn't despair amen for she knew that
[1:13:24] God God had come in that representative
[1:13:28] amen she recognized that Jesus was the
[1:13:32] representation of God upon the Earth
[1:13:35] amen the prophet said she seen too much
[1:13:37] Supernatural in him she saw the works
[1:13:40] that were Supernatural she couldn't
[1:13:42] doubt now even though the problem was
[1:13:45] too impossible when it seemed like all
[1:13:48] hope was gone God was there in his
[1:13:53] representative in the time of trouble I
[1:13:56] am you believe it amen yes sir and she
[1:14:01] acknowledged the Lord amen you see the
[1:14:05] prophets had a portion of God Jesus had
[1:14:08] the fullness of God for he was the word
[1:14:12] but we find today the prophet says today
[1:14:15] God is representing himself in his
[1:14:18] church in the church how many's part of
[1:14:21] the church amen then you know what that
[1:14:24] means is God God's representing himself
[1:14:26] in you amen you you're not just here to
[1:14:29] be a church member you're not just here
[1:14:31] just to learn about God Amen you're not
[1:14:34] just here to have a knowledge of God and
[1:14:37] then God become a historical God you're
[1:14:39] not in a in a Sunday school lesson amen
[1:14:42] writing all the stuff and yet you don't
[1:14:44] know what God is you're here as a
[1:14:47] representative of God the supernatural
[1:14:50] God is living inside of you you're the
[1:14:54] repres representative of God now notice
[1:14:58] Colossians 1:27 now notice this has been
[1:15:01] a mystery that's been hid to whom God
[1:15:03] would make known what is the riches of
[1:15:05] the glory of this ministry among the
[1:15:08] Gentiles he didn't make it known to the
[1:15:10] Jews it didn't make it known to the
[1:15:12] Samaritans this mystery has been made
[1:15:15] known among the Gentiles in this last
[1:15:18] day amen which is Christ in you
[1:15:22] everybody say it's Christ in me it's
[1:15:25] Christ in me I am that representative
[1:15:28] Christ in me the hope of glory now
[1:15:31] notice what Matthew
[1:15:32] 18:18 uh Jesus says verely say unto you
[1:15:36] whatsoever you shall bind on Earth shall
[1:15:38] be bound in heaven and whatsoever you
[1:15:41] shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in
[1:15:43] heaven again I say unto you that if two
[1:15:46] of you shall agree on Earth as touching
[1:15:49] anything that they shall ask it shall be
[1:15:52] done for them of my father which is in
[1:15:55] heaven now church that's not a wish that
[1:15:58] is a promise that is God speaking to his
[1:16:02] representative here upon the Earth God
[1:16:05] was speaking to his church knowing there
[1:16:07] would come a time that he would come
[1:16:10] into them and live through them and
[1:16:13] express himself prise the Lord you see
[1:16:16] he's a very present help in time of
[1:16:19] trouble in
[1:16:22] you you believe it amen
[1:16:25] he's not a myth out there not some
[1:16:27] Spirit floating around he's in your body
[1:16:31] you realize you take him home tonight
[1:16:34] because he's in you you take him to work
[1:16:37] because he's in you you take him to the
[1:16:40] grocery store because he's in you he's a
[1:16:43] very present help in the time of trouble
[1:16:46] when you need him he's a present help
[1:16:48] can you say Amen wherever you go you
[1:16:51] take him with you because you are God's
[1:16:53] representation
[1:16:57] amise Lord why would he give us power to
[1:17:00] loose and to
[1:17:04] bind well you know we walk hand inand
[1:17:07] with him we're supposed to walk hand in
[1:17:10] hand with him but we're not walking
[1:17:12] without direction we're not walking just
[1:17:15] aimlessly that's right but there's a
[1:17:18] direction amen we've quoted this
[1:17:21] scripture many times Jeremiah 29:11 for
[1:17:24] I know the thought that I think towards
[1:17:25] you sayith the Lord thoughts of peace
[1:17:27] and not of evil to give you everybody
[1:17:30] say to give you an expected end so we're
[1:17:34] not we're just not wandering around God
[1:17:37] has an expected end God has a destiny
[1:17:40] God has a goal for every one of our
[1:17:42] lives that are part of the church God
[1:17:45] didn't you didn't become part of the
[1:17:47] church amen because you joined it it was
[1:17:50] because God by Grace birthed you into
[1:17:52] this church because he had a purpose for
[1:17:55] your
[1:17:55] [Music]
[1:17:57] life now we know that this plan that God
[1:18:00] had he had a plan he had a purpose
[1:18:02] before the foundation of the world
[1:18:04] according to Ephesians the book of
[1:18:06] Ephesians Paul would tell us that it is
[1:18:08] the Eternal Purpose with uh which he
[1:18:12] purposed in Christ Jesus our lord it's
[1:18:14] an eternal purpose but we know that we
[1:18:17] started out in life amen the wrong way
[1:18:21] amen we were born Sinners we weren't
[1:18:23] supposed to be sinners God didn't
[1:18:25] predestinate us to be Sinners he
[1:18:27] predestinated us to be conformed to the
[1:18:29] image of his son God didn't predestinate
[1:18:32] us to to lay as low life into this in
[1:18:35] this earth and to lay in the slums and
[1:18:37] the garbage of life amen he didn't
[1:18:40] predestinate us for that amen he
[1:18:42] predestinated us to be sons of God Amen
[1:18:45] but he allowed it to happen Amen to show
[1:18:48] that we could show he could show us his
[1:18:50] Mercy can you say Amen that he could
[1:18:53] show us who he is amen but we started
[1:18:57] out as Sinners we started out as Liars
[1:18:59] we started out as Bound for hell amen
[1:19:02] and this is the reason why the Bible
[1:19:05] would tell us that you've got to be
[1:19:07] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:19:09] transformed trans everybody say
[1:19:12] transformed you got to be changed you
[1:19:15] you you got to be made different you you
[1:19:17] got to come from one thing to another
[1:19:19] thing transformed ain't that right amen
[1:19:23] it also tells us to be conformed to the
[1:19:26] image of his dear son in other words we
[1:19:29] are to be changed we're to be changed
[1:19:31] from sinner to Saint change from servant
[1:19:34] to son change from bondage to Freedom
[1:19:37] change from Mortal to to immortality
[1:19:40] change from corruption to incorruption
[1:19:43] change from Wars Amen to peace change
[1:19:46] from sin Amen to righteousness we we've
[1:19:50] got to be changed and it's a journey
[1:19:53] that God has has called every one of us
[1:19:56] who is a part of the body of Christ to
[1:19:59] walk it's a it's a journey that we are
[1:20:01] walking
[1:20:03] amen that's right see now if you look at
[1:20:06] the world the world is degressive I know
[1:20:08] they're making Promises of a better
[1:20:09] future it will not happen this world is
[1:20:13] degressive and it's becoming more and
[1:20:15] more and more amen it's it's making in
[1:20:19] other words it's making its descent it's
[1:20:22] it's in a downward spy it's just going
[1:20:25] down it's and and further down and
[1:20:27] further down why because they are under
[1:20:30] the power of Darkness amen they're under
[1:20:33] this power amen of deformity they're
[1:20:37] under this power amen and and and the
[1:20:40] power of darkness is of the devil how
[1:20:42] many believes that for he is the ruler
[1:20:45] of darkness and he is doing his best
[1:20:49] amen now notice what he's got he's got
[1:20:51] control of the government he's got
[1:20:53] control of the natural Church he's got
[1:20:56] control of Education he's got control of
[1:20:58] science he's got control of everything
[1:21:02] but one thing he does not have control
[1:21:04] of and that's you and I as the body of
[1:21:06] Christ amen see amen look look at this
[1:21:10] you know and and he's trying to get us
[1:21:12] amen he's trying to Captivate Us he's
[1:21:14] trying to to bring us in under his rule
[1:21:18] he's trying every which way to keep us
[1:21:21] from becoming what God ordained us to
[1:21:26] be that's right but Paul said in
[1:21:28] Colossians
[1:21:30] 1:13 Christ has delivered us from the
[1:21:33] power of Darkness amen how many's been
[1:21:36] delivered come on Church you been
[1:21:39] delivered he's delivered us from the
[1:21:41] power of darkness and he's translated us
[1:21:45] into the kingdom of his dear son and in
[1:21:47] other words we're under another
[1:21:49] government we're under another kingship
[1:21:51] under another headship Christ is our
[1:21:53] King can You amen he doesn't begin to be
[1:21:56] our King in the Millennium or or in the
[1:21:59] in the new heavens and the new Earth he
[1:22:02] is our King now we are under his
[1:22:06] domain yes sir now we have been given
[1:22:10] the power to bind and to loose we have
[1:22:16] been given the power not everybody but
[1:22:19] we as his Representatives on the earth
[1:22:22] we've been given that power you don't
[1:22:24] have to know Knuck down to the devil you
[1:22:26] have been given the power to bind that
[1:22:29] devil can you say amen amen and when
[1:22:32] bondage tries to come upon you you have
[1:22:35] the power to
[1:22:38] loose yes
[1:22:40] sir you have the power now notice Luke
[1:22:44] 10:19 behold Jesus said behold I give
[1:22:47] unto you power to tread on serpents and
[1:22:50] scorpions and over all the power of the
[1:22:52] enemy and nothing everybody say nothing
[1:22:55] now come on church we all know what
[1:22:57] nothing is it doesn't take a a a high
[1:22:59] school education to even know that
[1:23:03] nothing shall by any means hurt you
[1:23:06] Hallelujah prise the
[1:23:08] Lord right can you say Amen who's that
[1:23:11] you the ones that's been given the power
[1:23:14] that's right to tread upon serpents and
[1:23:17] scorpions on on over all power of the
[1:23:21] enemy see acts 1: 18 but you shall
[1:23:24] receive
[1:23:25] power not when you start just getting a
[1:23:27] religious spirit on you a religious
[1:23:30] feeling but you'll receive power after
[1:23:33] that the Holy Ghost comes upon you and
[1:23:36] you shall be Witnesses of me ain't that
[1:23:39] right now just to say it it's not our
[1:23:42] power it's not my power it's not your
[1:23:44] power a ain't that right but notice 1
[1:23:47] John 44 you are of God little children
[1:23:50] and have overcome them you've overcome
[1:23:53] every SP Spirit you overcome every devil
[1:23:56] you've overcome every trial every
[1:23:59] situation every Antichrist spirit that
[1:24:02] rises up you have overcome
[1:24:05] them why because greater is he that is
[1:24:08] in you yes sir than he that is in this
[1:24:10] world can you say Amen so now this power
[1:24:14] has come by a person coming into you
[1:24:17] Amen on ain't that right amen The Living
[1:24:21] Word see so don't don't don't think that
[1:24:24] you have something to do with it amen I
[1:24:27] I you know it's it's amazing when people
[1:24:30] bless God and they they they you know oh
[1:24:33] God God God but then they put themselves
[1:24:35] into it I've done this and I've done
[1:24:38] that and I'll make this and I'm going to
[1:24:39] do this and I'm going to do that you
[1:24:41] ain't doing nothing without the help of
[1:24:43] the
[1:24:45] lord lord so don't think that you have
[1:24:48] something to do with it can you say Amen
[1:24:50] even the Bible tells us don't you lean
[1:24:52] to your own understanding
[1:24:55] amen now Paul showed us the the
[1:24:59] power that a Believer has even over the
[1:25:02] natural

[1:25:20] poisonous that he should have dropped
[1:25:22] dead within seconds

[1:25:29] Paul just shook it
[1:25:32] off shook it back off in the
[1:25:35] fire he didn't worry about it he just
[1:25:38] continued on because he knew that he was
[1:25:41] a representative of God he knew he had
[1:25:44] the power over that thing right praise
[1:25:47] the Lord hallelujah can you say amen
[1:25:51] amen he shook off the Beast and Into the
[1:25:53] Fire the Bible says and he felt no harm
[1:25:56] the prophet said see Paul looked at it
[1:25:58] not a bit more scared than nothing
[1:26:00] walked over and shook it over the fire
[1:26:02] and acted as if no harm would ever come
[1:26:05] and went right ahead he wasn't scared he
[1:26:07] said the reason it hurt you is because

[1:36:18] place I was having a meeting over here
[1:36:20] in toeka Kansas there was a boy a young
[1:36:22] preacher one of my sponsors brother Roy
[1:36:25] sitting here remembers the place in this
[1:36:27] great place this Minister young Minister
[1:36:30] had got under a roof or a place the
[1:36:32] sidewall mashed him down beneath that
[1:36:35] the little fellow was going to die his
[1:36:37] liver was bursted his spleen was knocked
[1:36:39] out of place tons fell on him I sat at
[1:36:43] the breakfast talking to the wife I said
[1:36:45] wife you know if Jesus was here you know
[1:36:48] what he'd do I said when he sponsored me
[1:36:51] I believe that word he was sponsoring
[1:36:52] Christ when he sponsored me that word
[1:36:56] the word that he was preaching he was
[1:36:58] sponsoring Christ and I said see that's
[1:37:00] a trick of the devil I said if Jesus was
[1:37:03] here he'd go lay his holy hands upon him
[1:37:05] that boy would get well I don't care if
[1:37:07] his liver is bursted he would get well
[1:37:10] because Jesus would walk in there
[1:37:11] knowing exactly who he was who he was
[1:37:14] not the preacher and the young preacher
[1:37:16] he knew who that man was but he also
[1:37:19] knew who he was knowing who he was say
[1:37:23] see and and uh um so so I'm now I lost
[1:37:28] my place so I don't care if the liver
[1:37:30] was bursted he would get well because
[1:37:31] Jesus would walk in there knowing
[1:37:33] exactly who he was he knowed his calling
[1:37:36] the scriptures was right vindicating in
[1:37:39] him that he knowed who he was see not a
[1:37:42] Shadow of Doubt I I I I hope you get
[1:37:45] that real clear not a Shadow of Doubt he
[1:37:49] didn't have a Shadow of Doubt who he was
[1:37:51] and there not must not be a shadow of a
[1:37:53] doubt of as to who you
[1:37:55] are can you say Amen are you with me
[1:37:59] that's why this this message come for
[1:38:02] you and and God so Vindicated this
[1:38:06] message so that when the prophet would
[1:38:08] talk about you being the bride that you
[1:38:10] would have no doubt about what he's
[1:38:12] saying about you
[1:38:13] amen if he called us The Virtuous
[1:38:16] sinless spotless bride of Jesus Christ
[1:38:18] there should be no doubt about that
[1:38:22] believe Hallelujah yes sir he'd go lay
[1:38:25] his hands upon him that boy would get
[1:38:27] well see and he says he knowed his
[1:38:29] calling Jesus knowed his calling the
[1:38:31] scripture was right vindicating in him
[1:38:33] that he knowed who he was not a shout of
[1:38:35] doubt he had laid his hands upon him and
[1:38:37] say son be well walk out of there and I
[1:38:39] said there isn't enough devils in hell
[1:38:41] to kill that boy then I said he would
[1:38:43] get well but I said you see honey he was
[1:38:46] Jesus the holy hands of God he says I I
[1:38:49] I said I I'm a sinner I was born sexual
[1:38:52] birth my father father and mother were
[1:38:54] both Sinners and I'm just a no good
[1:38:56] nothing and I said but you know what if
[1:38:59] the Lord would give me a vision and send
[1:39:02] me down there then that would be
[1:39:03] different I'd say i' i' I said I'd go
[1:39:07] down there lay my hands on him he'd come
[1:39:08] out of that bed if he' give me a vision
[1:39:11] then I got to thinking after all if it
[1:39:14] was the vision what was it it was the
[1:39:17] same dirty hands on him uh-huh same man
[1:39:20] praying for him same dirty hands in
[1:39:23] other words the the the vision didn't
[1:39:25] change who he
[1:39:27] was right he'd have a vision but it
[1:39:30] would still be brandom brother brandom's
[1:39:32] hands laying on him right see so it
[1:39:36] didn't change it to be holy hands he
[1:39:38] said but then see I got to thinking
[1:39:40] after all if it was a vision what was it
[1:39:43] it was the same dirty hands on him
[1:39:45] uh-huh same man praying for him same
[1:39:47] dirty hand then I began to think I am
[1:39:51] his representative amen
[1:39:54] then God doesn't see me that blood of
[1:39:57] that righteous one lays up there upon
[1:40:00] the altar it makes intercessions for me
[1:40:04] God have
[1:40:06] mercy he is my sufficiency he is my
[1:40:10] prayer he is my life I said the only
[1:40:14] thing that make me put my hands on him
[1:40:17] with faith because I had faith in the
[1:40:19] vision and without the vision the same
[1:40:23] Faith would do the same
[1:40:26] thing praise the Lord come on now so
[1:40:29] brother brandom is saying I don't have
[1:40:30] to have a vision I just got to have that
[1:40:33] same faith that I would have in that
[1:40:36] Vision come on now same Faith would do
[1:40:39] the same thing so I reckon myself
[1:40:41] nothing but reckon him my all in all he
[1:40:44] is my life he is my commissioner no
[1:40:47] denomination sent me he sent me
[1:40:49] Hallelujah I go in his name I'll lay
[1:40:53] hands upon him I walked down there laid
[1:40:56] hands on that boy and that night he was
[1:40:57] in the meeting solid
[1:41:00] well why God had a representative on the
[1:41:04] earth that God could prove himself to be
[1:41:06] a present help in the time of need
[1:41:09] that's right you see it you say well I'm
[1:41:13] Just a
[1:41:14] Nobody but there's one making
[1:41:16] intercession for you
[1:41:18] amen hallelujah
[1:41:21] amen the ible says the blood of Jesus
[1:41:24] Christ has cleansed us from all
[1:41:26] unrighteousness so what does that mean
[1:41:28] it makes us a channel for the word of
[1:41:30] God to flow through are you with me amen
[1:41:34] God didn't send you the Holy Ghost to
[1:41:36] Quicken the word into you just to sit
[1:41:38] there and doubt everything when Trouble
[1:41:41] Comes don't doubt it amen he's a present

[1:41:59] his prayer said our heavenly father I
[1:42:01] bring these people sweetly and humbly to
[1:42:03] you in the name of your son the Lord
[1:42:05] Jesus to be sure that my prayer is
[1:42:07] offered for them to be sure that I did
[1:42:09] all that I know how to do that they will
[1:42:11] receive you being that you have been so
[1:42:13] good to take these old frail bodies of
[1:42:15] ours and to let the Holy Spirit speak
[1:42:18] through them it's certainly taking a
[1:42:21] sanctifying grace of God to do it
[1:42:23] because we are sinners of no good at all
[1:42:25] but the Holy Spirit has taken the blood
[1:42:27] of Jesus and cleansed our hearts and
[1:42:29] Sanctified our lips like you did the
[1:42:31] prophet at the altar and now the word of
[1:42:33] God spoken word of God flows forth to
[1:42:36] vindicate his presence to this
[1:42:38] generation before it shall pass into
[1:42:41] eternity to give an account can you say
[1:42:43] amen amen see the word of God flowing
[1:42:46] the word of God well the word of God
[1:42:48] flowed through Jesus did he not amen he

[1:42:54] fullness of God made flesh and notice
[1:42:56] brother Bram and speaking of Jesus said
[1:42:58] no wonder winds and waves obeyed him uh
[1:43:01] see obeyed his words obeyed his words
[1:43:05] because it was God's word through him he
[1:43:07] was a man but he was the word made flesh
[1:43:11] and when God when he spoke it was God
[1:43:13] speaking through human lips no wonder
[1:43:16] the winds and waves the very creator
[1:43:18] that created the winds and the waves was
[1:43:20] in him he was a present help in the time
[1:43:25] of
[1:43:25] need now think of it think deep now no
[1:43:29] wonder demons paralyzed that his word it
[1:43:32] was God in him it was God in Christ the
[1:43:35] demons was paralyzed no wonder the dead
[1:43:38] that was turning back to the dust could
[1:43:40] not lay there at his word he was the
[1:43:43] word he said to Lazarus after being dead
[1:43:46] and stinking four days his face nose had
[1:43:49] fell fallen in in that much time and yet
[1:43:52] he said l come forth and a man dead
[1:43:55] raised upon his feet why it was God Amen
[1:43:59] he that was in Christ was God see the
[1:44:03] dead could not stand in his presence for
[1:44:06] it was God in Christ what was it a
[1:44:09] present help in the time of trouble a
[1:44:12] present help can you say amen God had a
[1:44:15] body that he could work through God had
[1:44:16] a body that could manifest himself to
[1:44:19] the
[1:44:20] people amen death thought he could have
[1:44:23] Lazarus but God was a present help he
[1:44:27] says remember God created the winds it's
[1:44:29] air now he's talking about when when
[1:44:31] they were in his disciples were on the
[1:44:34] boat and the winds coming and and and
[1:44:37] and the waves rocking the boat Jesus was
[1:44:40] asleep in the boat remember amen he said
[1:44:42] now God created the winds it's air he
[1:44:45] created the waves it's water but when
[1:44:47] the devil got into it he got it to
[1:44:49] tumbling to bring destruction see also
[1:44:53] God created men to be sons of God but
[1:44:55] when the devil gets into them see it's
[1:44:58] trouble see now that was the devil that
[1:45:01] got into the winds that sent that storm
[1:45:03] couldn't the creator that created that
[1:45:05] wind say go back where I created you is
[1:45:08] that not what God did in the time of
[1:45:11] trouble amen when they woke Jesus up he
[1:45:14] stood there on the bow of that ship and
[1:45:16] he said peace be still and the winds and
[1:45:19] the waves obeyed their creator amen why
[1:45:23] God's representative was there upon that
[1:45:26] boat amen and God was there in the time
[1:45:29] of trouble amen but notice what brother
[1:45:32] Bram says he says then he says isn't
[1:45:35] that the same creator that was standing
[1:45:37] on Colorado Hill the other day amen
[1:45:40] remember God had a representation upon
[1:45:43] the Earth amen and the storm was coming
[1:45:46] people were getting ready for this big
[1:45:48] blizzard that was coming but there stood
[1:45:50] a representative of God upon that
[1:45:53] mountain and God showed himself to be a
[1:45:56] present help in time of
[1:45:58] trouble prise the Lord then he says
[1:46:02] isn't that the same creator that created
[1:46:04] the
[1:46:05] squirrels then he that was in Christ is
[1:46:08] in us see for it does the same works
[1:46:11] that he did the very same thing and I
[1:46:14] say to you when the devil gets into
[1:46:16] situations of your life amen it's the
[1:46:19] same God that created the storm or that
[1:46:22] that spoke to the storms that created
[1:46:25] the squirrels that that that that that
[1:46:27] brought that storm into nothing amen see
[1:46:31] uh caused it to to to dissipate is the
[1:46:35] same God in you that will speak to the
[1:46:39] situations don't you try to handle them
[1:46:42] situations on your
[1:46:48] own can I say it this way don't be too
[1:46:51] stubborn
[1:46:53] like ASA to ask for his
[1:46:57] help don't get to the place that you
[1:46:59] cannot acknowledge
[1:47:01] God don't make him as helpless as you
[1:47:05] are don't put him equal with your doctor
[1:47:09] or with some
[1:47:11] psychologist yes don't put him on the
[1:47:14] same
[1:47:16] level with the church
[1:47:20] world it would be like
[1:47:24] comparing a canary bird with a canary
[1:47:27] brain to that of an educated man that
[1:47:30] graduated from
[1:47:33] Purdue there's no comparison that's
[1:47:37] right God said in Isaiah 559 for as the
[1:47:40] heavens are higher than the earth so are
[1:47:41] my ways higher than your ways and my
[1:47:43] thoughts than your thoughts can you say
[1:47:45] Amen there's no comparison but can we
[1:47:48] know the mind of God yes we can for 1
[1:47:52] Corinthians 21:16 for who hath known the
[1:47:54] mind of the Lord that he may instruct
[1:47:56] him but we have the mind of Christ can
[1:47:59] you say Amen yes sir that same God that
[1:48:02] is higher than our ways and and and
[1:48:04] higher than our thoughts and he's that
[1:48:06] same God now that lives in you amen that
[1:48:09] wants to take over your vessel he
[1:48:11] doesn't want to use your mind he'll take
[1:48:13] his own mind he'll take your lips and he
[1:48:16] will speak his word through your lips
[1:48:18] he'll take your hands he'll take your
[1:48:20] feet if you just surrender to K and
[1:48:23] acknowledge Him in all thy ways he he
[1:48:28] will direct your
[1:48:30] paths he will be a present help in the
[1:48:34] time of need Lord can you say Amen all
[1:48:38] do you love him we are called to walk
[1:48:41] with God as Enoch I'm going to try to
[1:48:44] hurry now we're called to walk with God
[1:48:47] just as Enoch
[1:48:49] did which means that we should be in
[1:48:51] constant Fellowship with him you
[1:48:54] remember
[1:48:55] Israel remember every time they went
[1:48:58] through trouble any time they complained
[1:49:01] they griped they
[1:49:04] murmured they left Moses and they went
[1:49:07] after other
[1:49:08] things and God said they do always error
[1:49:11] in their heart because they have not
[1:49:13] known my
[1:49:15] ways you understand amen now now we're a
[1:49:19] people that should know his ways because
[1:49:22] God has called called us to walk handin
[1:49:24] hand with him just as Enoch did Enoch
[1:49:27] walked with God and was not for God took
[1:49:29] him Enoch was our type so if we're
[1:49:33] walking with God then that means we
[1:49:35] should be in constant fellowship with
[1:49:38] him true constant Fellowship which makes
[1:49:43] us conscience of his presence at all
[1:49:46] times it makes us aware that he is a
[1:49:48] present help at all times can you say
[1:49:52] Amen brother Braham said when a man will
[1:49:54] walk for God and walk with God God will
[1:49:57] walk with that man but when that same
[1:50:00] individual turns his back from God then
[1:50:02] God just lets him shift for
[1:50:05] himself now church we got people all
[1:50:08] around claiming Christianity but fear is
[1:50:11] gripping their hearts fear is running
[1:50:14] rampant in the land it's it's prevailing
[1:50:16] over the people amen see because why
[1:50:20] they're not seeing God as a present help
[1:50:23] in time of trouble they they they join
[1:50:25] the church amen they're they're living
[1:50:28] by their Creeds they're they're living
[1:50:29] by their dogmas they're they're living
[1:50:31] by rituals they're living by amen the
[1:50:33] laws of of of dos and don'ts they're
[1:50:36] living by all that but they're failing
[1:50:38] to walk with God they're they're failing
[1:50:41] to to be conscience amen that God is a
[1:50:44] present help that's why they all go
[1:50:46] after uh after some politician with all
[1:50:49] these promises and all and not realize
[1:50:51] that this world world is falling apart
[1:50:54] and every promise that he can give you
[1:50:56] is not going to be fulfilled he cannot
[1:50:58] do it because a prophet said America
[1:51:01] will never come back to its place again
[1:51:04] but God is a present
[1:51:06] help amen amen can you say amen and what
[1:51:11] is it they've left him behind as Mary
[1:51:14] and Joseph left Jesus behind at the
[1:51:16] Pentecostal Feast ain't that right
[1:51:19] remember they left him behind at at the
[1:51:21] Pentecost brother said people are doing
[1:51:23] that they're leaving they're leaving him
[1:51:25] behind in other words they're not
[1:51:27] getting that Pentecostal experience that
[1:51:29] they need amen they're not realizing
[1:51:32] they're not getting him inside of them
[1:51:34] amen to where he can have his way in
[1:51:39] them there's others that you know are
[1:51:42] not realizing that he is with them maybe
[1:51:45] like the two on the that walk the road
[1:51:48] to emus there Jesus was with them and
[1:51:51] yet they didn't know it
[1:51:53] maybe there's there's people like that
[1:51:56] and and and and and you know they they
[1:51:59] might have received him and yet don't
[1:52:01] realize that he's still with him like
[1:52:03] when when the disciples were there upon
[1:52:05] that ship and they were going to the
[1:52:07] other side Jesus in the uh the asleep in
[1:52:10] in in the bottom of the boat and and and
[1:52:13] and brother Brown said 10,000 demons
[1:52:15] swore that day that they would drown him
[1:52:19] amen and that they would kill him and
[1:52:21] Satan as we talked about got into the
[1:52:23] storm got into the winds and the waves
[1:52:25] and and all of that and and the
[1:52:27] disciples were afraid because they were
[1:52:30] at their in they didn't know what to do
[1:52:32] they they had tried their expertise a
[1:52:34] lot of them were fishermen and yet they
[1:52:36] had tried and and they realized they
[1:52:38] were beyond their their hope and they
[1:52:40] began to be afraid but then the prophet
[1:52:43] said it must have dawned on them hold it
[1:52:45] he's in the bottom of the ship he's with
[1:52:48] us he's with us and they went and woke
[1:52:51] him up brother brandham says this he
[1:52:54] said you know he says he said they
[1:52:56] didn't have to go say oh Master wake up
[1:52:58] wake up wake up Master wake up no no no
[1:53:02] they just said
[1:53:03] master and he said Here Am iise the Lord
[1:53:07] car thou not that we perish he said oh
[1:53:10] where is your faith you have little
[1:53:11] faith he said that's it forgetting he is
[1:53:14] with us calling Jesus on the scene to
[1:53:16] act people today say if I know if I
[1:53:19] could know for sure that that was him if
[1:53:21] I could just be sure see how could they
[1:53:23] be sure how was the disciple sure of it
[1:53:26] now listen he says not because he was an
[1:53:28] educated man as far as I know he wasn't
[1:53:30] he only had the wisdom of God but the
[1:53:32] worldly education we don't have no
[1:53:34] record of him ever going to school but
[1:53:36] some great PR priest and some great
[1:53:39] renowned person no see see we have no
[1:53:41] record of anything like that he was just
[1:53:43] a common man but how could they know it
[1:53:45] was him he said now listen close don't
[1:53:48] miss this how could they rest assure
[1:53:50] amen are see we are sure that thou art
[1:53:53] the Christ how could they because they
[1:53:56] had seen the promised word Vindicated in
[1:53:58] other words made manifest made known The
[1:54:01] Living Word of Promise Was Made Alive
[1:54:04] projected right through that body and
[1:54:06] they know that God was with him they
[1:54:10] knew that God was a present help in the
[1:54:12] time of trouble God wasn't a god way
[1:54:15] back in Moses day in the Years Gone by
[1:54:18] amen and they're just believing on some
[1:54:20] God that was but now they how God it
[1:54:24] presentend and I say to you God is
[1:54:26] presentent in the church today Jesus
[1:54:31] amen acknowledge the Lord in all thy
[1:54:34] ways that's right and he shall direct
[1:54:37] their
[1:54:38] paths if the musicians will
[1:54:42] come I want to say that prayer is such a
[1:54:44] vital thing to
[1:54:47] Christians why do we struggle with
[1:54:49] things amen
[1:54:52] why do we struggle with believing
[1:54:56] God why why do we struggle with
[1:55:00] bitterness why do we struggle with
[1:55:03] anxiety and
[1:55:06] fear why do we struggle to overcome
[1:55:09] things in our
[1:55:13] life CU often
[1:55:16] times we don't acknowledge him in prayer
[1:55:20] true
[1:55:22] we're trying to do it on our
[1:55:25] own and we become content with
[1:55:30] life we we become
[1:55:34] content battling these situations in our
[1:55:39] life bitterness becomes the norm gossip
[1:55:42] becomes the
[1:55:44] norm dry experience with God just
[1:55:47] becomes a
[1:55:49] Norm just going to church
[1:55:52] not feeling God becomes the
[1:55:58] norm struggling becomes the
[1:56:02] norm having difficulty just taking God
[1:56:05] at his word becomes the
[1:56:08] norm anxiety and fear and it just
[1:56:12] becomes the norm it's like we accept it
[1:56:15] but that's not a Christian
[1:56:19] Life that may be the life of a Christian
[1:56:22] but not a True
[1:56:23] [Music]
[1:56:25] Believer because God is a present help
[1:56:27] in the time of
[1:56:29] need if you've got fear and anxiety God
[1:56:32] is a present help in the time of need if
[1:56:34] you're struggling with things in your
[1:56:35] life God is a present help in the time
[1:56:37] of
[1:56:39] need if bitterness and anger is trying
[1:56:42] to take over
[1:56:44] you God is a present help in the time of
[1:56:46] need if you're sitting there and your
[1:56:48] life is filled with worry about tomorrow
[1:56:51] worry about the future just worry worry
[1:56:53] worry God is a present
[1:56:56] help yes he is what I'm saying is God
[1:57:00] will help you through that and overcome
[1:57:02] that thing you don't have to live like
[1:57:09] that I think what the prophet said he
[1:57:12] said you Christians don't stay in that
[1:57:13] lukewarm condition anymore lay aside
[1:57:18] everything everybody say it with me lay
[1:57:20] aside everything lay aside
[1:57:23] everything don't get involved in things
[1:57:25] that you shouldn't get involved in lay
[1:57:27] aside everything don't get involved in
[1:57:29] the gossip don't get involved in the
[1:57:31] negative don't get involved with
[1:57:33] [Music]
[1:57:37] stuff he said just get as close to God
[1:57:40] as you can walk with him talk with him
[1:57:42] let everything else be secondary but
[1:57:44] your prayer life stay right with him all
[1:57:47] the time can you say
[1:57:50] Amen but what it is is we try many times
[1:57:54] to handle our problems and handle our
[1:57:56] situations just exactly like the world
[1:57:59] does we depend on things the way the
[1:58:01] world does and yet we know that they'll
[1:58:03] never it never
[1:58:07] works the world's looking for a
[1:58:11] messiah and yet Messiah has been here
[1:58:13] all
[1:58:15] along showing himself powerful showing
[1:58:18] himself true so showing himself real but
[1:58:22] that they fail to acknowledge
[1:58:25] Him and yet they keep looking and
[1:58:27] looking and one thing lets him down
[1:58:29] another thing lets them down and another
[1:58:31] thing lets them
[1:58:34] down where people are just bitter at God
[1:58:37] bitter at Christianity walking away from
[1:58:43] everything that's not the way we should
[1:58:46] handle our
[1:58:49] problems the way we should handle our
[1:58:51] problems is is on our
[1:58:53] knees prayer Works do you believe
[1:58:57] that brother brandom in his prayer is's
[1:59:00] talking to the Lord he says Lord I want
[1:59:02] to express to you my
[1:59:04] feeling if I can just in Thanksgiving
[1:59:08] expressing the very Adoration of my
[1:59:10] heart that I adore thee thou matchless
[1:59:14] one I love
[1:59:16] thee many times in great trials see an
[1:59:19] airplane pitching in the air falling
[1:59:22] twisting around and I look on the ground
[1:59:25] below me it whirling around and just a
[1:59:28] little
[1:59:30] prayer and it straightens it
[1:59:33] out knowing to be plunged to death in a
[1:59:37] minute standing out before which doctors
[1:59:40] and Devils then challenging and walking
[1:59:43] forward and just a little prayer sets
[1:59:46] them standing
[1:59:49] paralyzed how demons scream from your
[1:59:52] children by
[1:59:55] prayer or scream and come from your
[1:59:57] children in other words they're
[2:00:00] delivered by prayer oh your love Lord if
