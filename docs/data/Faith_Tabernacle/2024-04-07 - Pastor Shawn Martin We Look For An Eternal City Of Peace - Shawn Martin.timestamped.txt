[50:00] that tent was sagging and and the the
[50:04] the man that we bought it from he told
[50:06] told us said now if that tent is sagging
[50:09] it's your fault not ours and so uh we we
[50:13] knew it was our fault somehow and um so
[50:17] brother Tim had um uh he had recorded
[50:21] the the video of the man trying to show
[50:25] or showing us how to set it up and so he
[50:28] got us all straightened out the next
[50:30] night and um so he's been studying it
[50:34] and uh got it all figured out for us and
[50:37] so uh if you have any questions or we're
[50:40] just all going to listen to brother Tim
[50:43] and um uh he'll he'll get us figured out
[50:46] and straightened out and it's going to
[50:48] be a good good day praise the Lord no

[51:03] much and uh being willing to uh uh take
[51:07] on the responsibility and to help us and
[51:11] we appreciate it and want to say I
[51:13] appreciate uh the brothers that helped
[51:16] us last night and um uh just really
[51:19] appreciate that very much and uh brother
[51:22] Mark bringing his tractor and helping us
[51:25] get that tent and all that out of the
[51:27] conx and we appreciate that very much
[51:30] and so anyways uh we we love the Lord
[51:34] and and uh before we go into the word
[51:36] may we just bow our heads and talk to
[51:39] him Lord
[51:42] Jesus truly you are our heart's
[51:46] desire and that longing just just seems
[51:51] to increase within us father we want to
[51:54] be more like you we want to reflect you
[51:58] Lord we we we just want to stay in
[52:02] fellowship with you
[52:04] father Lord May nothing hinder that
[52:09] fellowship and I pray father that you
[52:11] would come in a special way this morning
[52:15] how we need you Lord we're your
[52:18] children father we've gathered here
[52:21] under a promise that where two or three
[52:24] are gathered in your name you would
[52:26] would be here now father May the
[52:29] supernatural take place now father I
[52:32] pray that you'd help me to get myself
[52:34] out of the way and anoint the gift that
[52:37] you placed in my life and may you anoint
[52:40] the people as well feel free father just
[52:44] to move among us we ask it in Jesus
[52:48] Christ's name
[52:50] amen praise the Lord uh the scripture I
[52:54] want to read is uh Hebrews 13 and
[53:04] 14 and it says for here we have no
[53:09] continuing City but we seek one to come
[53:14] amen how many
[53:15] seeking amen you can have your seats
[53:19] this
[53:20] morning I pray that something will be
[53:22] said to help you um I I don't plan to
[53:27] get through this my thought and so maybe
[53:30] just more of a foundation and it's
[53:34] something that we all know but I I think
[53:38] it's uh maybe to help uh the young
[53:42] people I I guess and and um maybe just
[53:47] to let us know that we're not
[53:51] here this is this world ain't our
[53:54] home and um
[53:57] we all know as Believers that
[54:00] that in this Mortal life we have no
[54:04] continuing City and therefore as
[54:07] Believers we all seek for a city to
[54:11] continue and uh but not only will this s
[54:15] City uh uh
[54:17] continue but this city will be totally
[54:21] different this Kingdom uh the place that
[54:25] we're going that we're looking looking
[54:27] forward it's it's going to be totally
[54:30] different than anything that we have
[54:32] ever experienced in this
[54:34] life and uh you know the the Bible calls
[54:38] this city uh New
[54:40] Jerusalem and Revelations 21 and 22
[54:44] talks about it and and uh Jerusalem the
[54:48] prophet said was first called
[54:50] Salem uh and Salem uh is the city of
[54:54] Peace amen and so uh uh uh New Jerusalem
[55:00] this this city that we're looking for
[55:03] and crying after it's it's a city of
[55:06] peace and of course uh we know that
[55:10] Abraham met the king of this city and he
[55:14] was the king of Salem the king of Peace
[55:17] the king of of righteousness and and so
[55:21] and and and this King was
[55:24] MDC uh who had no beginning no ending
[55:27] who had not a father had no mother and
[55:30] no it beginning of days no ending of of
[55:34] life and and these things and and so
[55:37] Paul would call him the God of Peace
[55:42] he's he's the God of Peace and in Romans
[55:45] 16 and2 uh he he would say the God of
[55:49] Peace shall bruise Satan's uh Satan
[55:53] under your feet shortly
[55:56] amen I I thought that's pretty good you
[55:59] know the God of Peace shall bruise Satan
[56:02] under your feet amen now this word peace
[56:06] it it it is rest uh quietness uh no fear
[56:13] Tranquility safety free from Rage and
[56:17] Havoc of War now you you'll never see
[56:21] that in this this world uh that we're
[56:24] living in and and so
[56:27] peace means that the enemy has been
[56:29] conquered it means that you are in
[56:32] agreement and in
[56:35] Fellowship dwelling in safety so peace
[56:39] is a sign that you have been delivered
[56:43] amen and so when when we come to this
[56:46] city of Peace it it it's to the
[56:49] Overcomer it it's it's a it's a place
[56:52] that we have
[56:53] finally uh no fear no no sin no torment
[56:59] no it's it's it's a a place of safety
[57:03] and
[57:04] tranquility and and to think of it that
[57:07] Psalms 5518 says he hath delivered my
[57:11] soul in peace from the battle that was
[57:15] against me for there were many with me
[57:18] or many against me but yet he has
[57:22] delivered my soul in peace I I think
[57:25] that's our testimony this morning is
[57:27] that there has been a peace in our soul
[57:30] that it it has it has it has finally
[57:34] been delivered from the grip of the
[57:36] devil he can afflict our mind he can
[57:39] afflict our body he can afflict Us in
[57:41] any way but our soul has found peace
[57:44] it's it's at rest because it has been
[57:47] delivered Satan doesn't own us no more
[57:51] he doesn't have dominion over us anymore
[57:54] ain't that right and and to think that
[57:56] we have been appointed to peace we we
[57:59] have been appointed uh Isaiah 26 and12
[58:04] it says Lord thou will ordain us for
[58:08] peace aren't you glad for that amen
[58:11] being appointed for that um uh in John
[58:15] 14 and 27 Jesus says peace I leave with
[58:19] you my peace I give unto you not as the
[58:22] world giveth so our peace is not found
[58:25] in in entainment and and in in the
[58:28] things of of Life uh here for that's all
[58:32] tangible but a pieace that that comes
[58:35] from an eternal it's an eternal peace
[58:38] and he says not as the world give give I
[58:41] unto you let not your hearts be troubled
[58:44] neither let it be afraid there's a peace
[58:47] can you sayen well that peace could be
[58:50] given to us when he defeated Satan and
[58:53] he conquered every demon of hell he
[58:56] conquered sickness he conquered the
[58:58] grave conquered death conquered
[59:00] mortality he conquered it all what a
[59:04] peace can you say Amen that he could
[59:06] give us because he's the Conqueror amen
[59:10] and he's showing us that he done it all
[59:13] for us ain't that right not only did it
[59:15] do it for his sake he done it for our
[59:18] sake amen see and so now he's offering
[59:22] peace uh unto us well peace belongs to
[59:26] the children of God Amen uh 2
[59:29] Thessalonians
[59:31] 3:16 it says the Lord of Peace himself
[59:36] give you peace Always by all means amen
[59:41] think of that the Lord of Peace the God
[59:44] of Peace himself giveth you peace always
[59:49] ain't that right amen uh uh Psalms 37
[59:53] And1 but the meek shall inher inherit
[59:56] the earth aren't you glad for that amen
[59:59] stay Meek church be meek amen amen uh
[1:00:02] the meek shall inherit the earth and
[1:00:05] shall Delight themselves in the
[1:00:08] abundance of Peace amen so so uh peace
[1:00:12] is our inheritance and amen that's
[1:00:16] that's what God has that's his whole
[1:00:18] goal is to give his children peace can
[1:00:22] you say Amen the Ser uh 37th verse aen
[1:00:26] of uh 37 says Mark that Mark the perfect
[1:00:30] man and behold the upright for the end
[1:00:34] everybody say the end of that man is
[1:00:37] peace amen so you're you're not leaving
[1:00:41] a a world of trouble only to go into
[1:00:44] torment no that's not that's not your
[1:00:47] end the end of that man is peace if he's
[1:00:51] given you peace in your soul then you
[1:00:54] don't have to fear death You Don't Have
[1:00:56] To Fear the Future you don't you don't
[1:00:58] have to fear where you're going for God
[1:01:01] has determined your end is an end to
[1:01:04] peace can you say amen amen so it's no
[1:01:07] wonder that that Believers look for this
[1:01:10] Eternal City a peace as as even Abraham
[1:01:14] did the Bible says he looked for a city
[1:01:17] whose Builder and found uh uh Builder
[1:01:20] and maker was God and and and and so
[1:01:23] it's a city of Peace amen uh and and so
[1:01:26] as Believers we confess with the Old
[1:01:29] Testament Saints and and those before us
[1:01:32] that we are pilgrims and and strangers
[1:01:35] in this land because we're looking for
[1:01:38] peace can you say amen amen we're
[1:01:41] looking for peace amen it's there it's
[1:01:44] there that the bear is going to be
[1:01:45] gentle it's there that the wolf will be
[1:01:48] tame it's it's there that the Lion's
[1:01:50] going to lay down by the lamb it's it's
[1:01:53] there that the wild beast man will be
[1:01:56] led by a child and brother Bram said
[1:01:59] he'll not jump up and rear up and try to
[1:02:02] kill you he'll walk down the paths with
[1:02:05] you amen why it's a it's a place of
[1:02:08] peace peace can you say amen amen I'm so
[1:02:11] glad for that amen there ain't going to
[1:02:13] be trying to conquer Devils amen he's
[1:02:15] already been conquered in this life amen
[1:02:18] ain't going to be over there being
[1:02:20] tested and tried amen you've done it in
[1:02:22] this life and and you've overcome all of
[1:02:25] that now now the enemy's gone it's it
[1:02:28] it's a place of peace and you're
[1:02:30] dwelling in peace and it's an eternal
[1:02:33] City something that comes and goes
[1:02:36] tomorrow that ain't it amen it's an
[1:02:38] eternal something now the world is
[1:02:41] huling for peace amen the political
[1:02:44] system is not capable of bringing it um
[1:02:48] the denominational system the church
[1:02:50] system religious system they're they're
[1:02:52] not able to to bring uh uh uh this peace
[1:02:56] and and and brother Bram says if that
[1:02:58] will bring about a world peace then what
[1:03:01] happened to the Prince of Peace that was
[1:03:03] the word amen see and and so peace can
[1:03:06] never be done by political uh politics
[1:03:10] or religious uh things and and things
[1:03:13] like that actually uh Paul would say in
[1:03:15] 1 Thessalonians 5 and3 that when they
[1:03:19] shall say peace and safety then sudden
[1:03:22] destruction cometh upon them when they
[1:03:25] think they've come up with peace then
[1:03:27] sudden destruction is going to come amen
[1:03:30] their peace will be disappointed their
[1:03:32] plans will be totally uh uh uh uh uh
[1:03:36] upset amen so uh destruction cometh upon
[1:03:40] them as travail upon a woman with child
[1:03:44] and they shall not they shall not Escape
[1:03:47] amen so then that tells us that there is
[1:03:50] no peace on the earth now we're looking
[1:03:52] in a time that they're all hollering
[1:03:54] peace amen and they they're they think
[1:03:57] they've come up with solutions for peace
[1:04:00] and they they keep telling us it's peace
[1:04:02] you know if you vote this one in yeah
[1:04:04] then then we'll have peace no no more
[1:04:06] Wars and no no World War II and and and
[1:04:10] well if you'll do it this way then then
[1:04:12] we'll come to peace and and all of that
[1:04:14] but but there will be no peace on this
[1:04:16] Earth amen and it amazes me to see
[1:04:19] so-called Christians get so wrapped up
[1:04:21] in politics as if if that's the answer
[1:04:25] and and and even in message ranks uh it
[1:04:28] shows how ignorant they are of the
[1:04:29] message and what God has brought to us
[1:04:32] and and what is happening in this day
[1:04:34] see that they seek peace and and when
[1:04:37] there is no peace to be found and it's
[1:04:39] like trying to get blood out of a turnup
[1:04:42] uh you're looking for the wrong place
[1:04:44] amen and if you're looking for Trump
[1:04:46] you're looking for the wrong place if
[1:04:48] you're looking for Democrats you're
[1:04:49] looking for the wrong place if you're
[1:04:51] looking to the pope you're looking for
[1:04:52] the wrong place amen there's no one that
[1:04:55] can bring about peace on this Earth can
[1:04:58] you say amen that's right see and and so
[1:05:01] the Bible says that in the last days now
[1:05:04] listen the wise shall understand the
[1:05:07] wise shall understand it doesn't matter
[1:05:10] it doesn't mean that everybody in the
[1:05:11] message is going to be wise amen that's
[1:05:13] right but their wisdom will come from
[1:05:15] this message amen those in the message
[1:05:18] will be wise those outside this message
[1:05:20] amen ain't going to be wise and and
[1:05:22] there's a lot that's in the message
[1:05:24] ain't going to be wise uh uh within the
[1:05:26] message ring see but notice how this
[1:05:28] wisdom comes to us the prophet said the
[1:05:31] spirit of wisdom comes into the church
[1:05:33] to make known to the church by the
[1:05:36] revelation of the Holy Ghost bringing
[1:05:38] the church in and revealing what day we
[1:05:41] are living in can you say Amen so so uh
[1:05:46] uh uh the wisdom Spirit of wisdom coming
[1:05:49] in the church amen so this this the the
[1:05:52] continuing city of of uh and the City of
[1:05:56] Peace uh that we're seeking for is not
[1:05:59] controlled by the same spirit that that
[1:06:02] is is controlling the nations of of
[1:06:06] today um you know brother brandom tells
[1:06:09] us that every every nation has a
[1:06:11] national
[1:06:12] spirit and and uh uh like he would tell
[1:06:16] us that German uh Germany has a spirit
[1:06:19] and it's a military spirit and he says
[1:06:22] see you you you have to stand straight
[1:06:24] and walk straight cut your corner see
[1:06:27] and everything it's military he said
[1:06:29] well then then you got the French
[1:06:31] they've got a national spirit and that's
[1:06:33] uh immorality it's an immoral Spirit
[1:06:36] women Wine Liquor and everything else
[1:06:39] Finland has a l or has a a national
[1:06:42] spirit and it's a loyal Spirit he said
[1:06:44] everything is honest we must pay
[1:06:46] everything off you know it must be done
[1:06:48] it's just got to be just that way no
[1:06:51] matter how hard they have to work what
[1:06:52] it cost it must be that way it's it's
[1:06:55] it's a loyal Spirit Well then America's
[1:06:58] got a national spirit and it's a spirit
[1:07:00] of Frolic amen and and I looked up that
[1:07:03] word Frolic and and it means to amuse
[1:07:06] oneself to make Merry uh uh to play and
[1:07:09] run and happily joking entertainment now
[1:07:13] is that not the spirit that we can see
[1:07:16] today everybody's got to be entertained
[1:07:18] everybody's got to be laughing nobody
[1:07:21] you can't be serious anymore you don't
[1:07:23] understand what I'm saying everybody
[1:07:24] cracking up a joke even even if it's the
[1:07:26] stupidest joke and I'm I'm leaving dad
[1:07:28] jokes out now you know uh uh uh uh uh
[1:07:31] dad jokes uh they think my children
[1:07:33] think my jokes are weird you know but uh
[1:07:36] I must be getting old you
[1:07:38] know and and so but but you know it it's
[1:07:42] just it's just comedy everything is
[1:07:44] entertainment children's got to be
[1:07:46] entertained parents got to be
[1:07:47] entertained churches got to be
[1:07:49] entertained everybody's got to be
[1:07:50] entertained today and and it's a it's
[1:07:53] it's you know I mean comedians or even
[1:07:55] having getting a place in behind the
[1:07:58] pulpits anymore uh to where whole
[1:08:00] services are left over to comedians is
[1:08:04] because there's so much entertainment
[1:08:06] it's a spirit of Frolic it's a national
[1:08:09] Spirit ain't that right amen but every
[1:08:12] nation is controlled by the devil amen
[1:08:16] uh for we find Luke 4 and 5 it it says
[1:08:20] the devil taking him speaking of Jesus
[1:08:23] into a high mountain show him all the
[1:08:26] kingdoms of the world in a moment's time
[1:08:29] and and and the devil said unto him all
[1:08:32] this power will I give unto thee and the
[1:08:35] glory of them for that is delivered unto
[1:08:38] me and to whomsoever will I give it
[1:08:41] ain't that right so so we know that that
[1:08:44] that he showed Jesus all the kingdoms
[1:08:47] not just them current Kingdom that
[1:08:50] showed him the United States showed him
[1:08:52] all the all uh uh the superpowers all
[1:08:55] the way to the end of the world and he
[1:08:57] says these are mine and I will give them
[1:09:00] to you ain't that right so so then we
[1:09:03] know that these nations and and are in
[1:09:07] his power and and Paul would call him
[1:09:10] the God of this world he's the god of
[1:09:13] the Nations he's the he he he's he's it
[1:09:16] it's the he's It's all under his control
[1:09:19] so no matter what national spirit amen a
[1:09:22] nation would have they all are in ired
[1:09:26] of the devil now just just to say it
[1:09:28] that way uh brother Brown actually said
[1:09:31] these National Spirits they're demons
[1:09:33] amen National Spirits they're demons and
[1:09:36] and and they get jealous of one another
[1:09:38] and they cause War see the there's
[1:09:41] there's one National Spirit over here
[1:09:43] another National Spirit over there and
[1:09:45] another one over there and and then they
[1:09:48] get jealous of one another and Prophet
[1:09:50] said they just can't get along with one
[1:09:52] another ain't that right and and what is
[1:09:54] it each Nation wants to have their own
[1:09:56] way amen America wants its way and and
[1:10:00] and it sees it's it's it it just you
[1:10:03] know wants everything to see it its way
[1:10:05] you know and and and and Russia doing
[1:10:08] China everybody wanting to see it their
[1:10:11] own way and and and and so brother BR
[1:10:14] said see that's just the spirit of the
[1:10:16] Nations and now what are we looking at
[1:10:19] every nation is trying to get an atomic
[1:10:22] bomb amen and and uh uh even even the
[1:10:25] small Nations they're they're they're
[1:10:27] flexing their muscles and it it's just
[1:10:30] incredible uh uh so but but but Jesus
[1:10:33] would tell us that there would be wars
[1:10:36] and rumors of wars and and uh and and
[1:10:39] this will happen until Jesus comes ain't
[1:10:42] that right and the prophet said as long
[1:10:44] as Satan controls it there is going to
[1:10:47] be Wars and troubles and Wars nations
[1:10:51] are against Nations and they have fooled
[1:10:53] through God's Laboratory St until they
[1:10:56] have got the power to blow one another
[1:10:59] into Atomic ashes and they're Wicked and
[1:11:03] they're very unreligious and they're un
[1:11:05] Christlike and the only motive they have
[1:11:09] and the objective is to destroy amen how
[1:11:13] can you find peace amen When people's
[1:11:16] hearts are anointed to destroy amen you
[1:11:19] ain't going to find it ain't that right
[1:11:21] another place brother Brown says they
[1:11:23] they their power crazy nature
[1:11:26] is what they are and they're always
[1:11:28] trying to find something to kill
[1:11:30] somebody something that will outdo the
[1:11:33] next thing and beat the next nation and
[1:11:35] beat the next place and that's what
[1:11:37] they're trying to do ain't that right
[1:11:40] brother brandham he had talked about uh
[1:11:42] hunting I believe or being out in the
[1:11:44] north west uh uh the territories and uh
[1:11:49] uh there around Alaska or so and and um
[1:11:54] uh uh they had to use used dog sleds and
[1:11:56] and so they had um uh uh chained uh or
[1:12:00] they had stopped and and and so the guy
[1:12:03] had gotten his dogs and he was placing
[1:12:05] them separate keeping them everywhere
[1:12:07] and brother Bram said well why are you
[1:12:08] doing that and he he said well he says
[1:12:11] he they're they're full of the devil he
[1:12:13] said that's what they are he says they
[1:12:15] look to kill one another and he says
[1:12:17] they're all demon possessed and and
[1:12:20] things like that and and brother Brown
[1:12:22] said that's exactly right he says that's
[1:12:24] that's the devil he said he's a killer
[1:12:28] and and and he says see it's even Devils
[1:12:30] fighting one another they they just
[1:12:32] fight and and you look at what call what
[1:12:35] brings division in the home it's the
[1:12:38] devil that does that what brings
[1:12:39] division in the church what brings
[1:12:41] division in the family what brings
[1:12:43] division against God's word is the devil
[1:12:46] amen and then you find Republicans
[1:12:48] fighting one another it's the devil that
[1:12:50] does that amen Democrats fighting one
[1:12:53] another it's the devil that does that
[1:12:55] you understand what I'm saying amen
[1:12:57] everything it's it's just a doggy dog
[1:13:00] it's it's just a uh uh but but they're
[1:13:03] anointed of the devil and and so the
[1:13:06] nations are hungry today for power
[1:13:09] they're looking for a Superman and and
[1:13:11] and you know brother Bram told us that
[1:13:13] and and how true we're seeing this like
[1:13:16] like more reality of this than ever
[1:13:19] before uh the churches are looking for a
[1:13:22] Superman that's why they're all getting
[1:13:24] in politics and involving themselves cuz
[1:13:26] they're they're hungering for answers
[1:13:29] they're looking for someone to bring the
[1:13:31] peace that that that that they're
[1:13:33] they're needing and and and everything
[1:13:36] is is looking you know for for a
[1:13:38] superman but notice what a prophet said
[1:13:40] I loved it and and he says we've already
[1:13:42] got it we've already got the Superman
[1:13:45] amen the what the world is looking for
[1:13:48] we've already got it he said God gave us
[1:13:51] to it y'all know what it is it's God's
[1:13:54] promised word for the hour that's
[1:13:56] exactly what he said amen but isn't that
[1:13:59] how different it is that people looking
[1:14:01] for something that one God has to offer
[1:14:04] because it's not attractive it's not
[1:14:06] something that that that you know it
[1:14:07] takes people that are really hungering
[1:14:09] for real peace Amen to see the answer
[1:14:13] right before them it takes God ain't
[1:14:15] that right it's just like the world was
[1:14:17] looking for a conqueror they were
[1:14:18] looking for this they were looking for
[1:14:20] that and God gave them the answer he
[1:14:22] gave them a little baby in a Manger
[1:14:24] ain't that right amen it's so simple but
[1:14:26] it's right it's the answer to the
[1:14:28] world's problems and this message is the
[1:14:31] answer to the world problems you ain't
[1:14:35] going to get peace without this
[1:14:37] message just ain't going to happen ain't
[1:14:40] that right so in studying instead of
[1:14:43] studying peace they have studied War
[1:14:46] instead of studying righteousness they
[1:14:48] have studied uh uh Mischief ain't that
[1:14:51] right now we we've known for for for
[1:14:54] ages now that the people want World
[1:14:56] Peace amen and and but they don't know
[1:14:59] how to have peace and and so we we've uh
[1:15:02] uh brother BR said we tried Kings but
[1:15:04] that didn't work we tried dictators but
[1:15:07] that didn't work we tried democracy but
[1:15:09] but we see see it it doesn't work
[1:15:12] democracy brother Brown said is the best
[1:15:14] thing that that's ever happened is
[1:15:16] democracy but it won't work because the
[1:15:19] it's under Satan's control ain't that
[1:15:22] right see so he he says
[1:15:25] one each one seems to get a little bit
[1:15:28] shallower each time so so we had our
[1:15:32] first world war and and they thought
[1:15:34] this is it you know we finally got peace
[1:15:37] you know the first world war this is it
[1:15:40] and they organized the League of Nations
[1:15:42] and and and and they all began to settle
[1:15:45] down thinking all right now we've we've
[1:15:47] achieved peace and it wasn't but what 20
[1:15:49] years or so after the the first world
[1:15:51] war we entered the second world war you
[1:15:54] know and and it just uh uh uh and and
[1:15:57] brother Bram said it's because of greed
[1:15:59] and jealousy amen jealousy and and so we
[1:16:03] we find a man that uh uh uh after uh R
[1:16:07] said after caser uh left Germany then
[1:16:10] here come the Australian Austrian named
[1:16:13] Adolf Adolf Hitler and he said he got
[1:16:16] the people's mind all scattered which is
[1:16:18] demon inspired and that they could whip
[1:16:21] the world you know and there you was
[1:16:23] it's devil against devil again see and
[1:16:26] the innocent subjects of those Nations
[1:16:29] see they just lead one another to war
[1:16:32] and it's to war and to war and to war
[1:16:35] now we're approaching World War II and
[1:16:37] it's going to
[1:16:39] happen do you believe it yes sir you bet
[1:16:42] it's going to happen and there ain't no
[1:16:44] politician going to stop
[1:16:46] it that's right amen see and and so uh
[1:16:50] uh you know uh and and and so when we
[1:16:53] look at this because brother said it's
[1:16:55] it's it's the cause of greed and
[1:16:56] jealousy and and jealousy uh uh we we
[1:17:01] all know it it comes from the devil and
[1:17:04] and and uh uh Lucifer is the is the one
[1:17:08] he's he started it there in heaven when
[1:17:10] he got jealous of God and and and it
[1:17:12] caused him to come against God and and
[1:17:15] we we know the division that he caused
[1:17:17] in heaven and and then it we see it upon
[1:17:20] earth when Cain uh which is Satan's son
[1:17:23] he he got uh jealous again of of the
[1:17:26] righteous Abel and caused him uh to kill
[1:17:29] Abel ain't that right then we find that
[1:17:32] Joseph's Brethren got jealous of him and
[1:17:35] they tried to get rid of him they sought
[1:17:37] to kill him and ended up uh uh selling
[1:17:40] him to uh uh to another nation and and
[1:17:44] then you down the road you you find that
[1:17:46] balum got jealous of Moses and and and
[1:17:50] you we all know about about them uh MOS
[1:17:53] or uh uh uh balum he was just as
[1:17:56] fundamental religious and right as as
[1:17:59] Moses was and had the seven altars had
[1:18:02] the seven Rams had the seven sacrifices
[1:18:05] and and everything just just as Israel
[1:18:08] did fundamentally ain't that right and
[1:18:11] and and Moab uh uh that that was with
[1:18:14] balum and and they were a great
[1:18:16] organization very organized and together
[1:18:20] as as a great nation and and but yet
[1:18:23] there was Israel SC Ed throughout amen
[1:18:26] the the the prairies and a bunch of
[1:18:28] tents and pilgrims and strangers seeking
[1:18:31] a city the prophet said strictly inter
[1:18:34] denominational ain't that right and and
[1:18:37] but they had signs and wonders following
[1:18:40] them and and and so uh uh uh we we we
[1:18:44] find that that uh balum and and the
[1:18:47] moabites they didn't have any of them
[1:18:49] signs they didn't have the pillar of
[1:18:50] fire they didn't have amen the
[1:18:52] Supernatural and it caused them to get
[1:18:55] jealous against Moses and against Israel
[1:18:59] and before you know it they sought to
[1:19:01] get rid of them and to destroy them and
[1:19:03] and and brother Ram said it was just
[1:19:05] Deon demonic spirits amen you travel on
[1:19:08] down and and how that Saul when the
[1:19:10] spirit of the Lord left Saul there was a
[1:19:13] spirit that was sent from God to anoint
[1:19:16] Saul amen and he become insane he he he
[1:19:20] he become a a a a a wild uh man and and
[1:19:25] here David was in the presence of Saul
[1:19:28] and the anointing would drop down amen
[1:19:31] because of David and Saul got jealous
[1:19:35] amen Saul got jealous of him and sought
[1:19:38] to kill him amen then you find that when
[1:19:40] Jesus come upon the Earth Judas amen
[1:19:43] sought to uh uh uh got jealous and uh
[1:19:46] betrayed Jesus ain't that right amen he
[1:19:49] was the son of predition and and then
[1:19:51] you see the denominations and how they
[1:19:54] were jealous of him they saw him doing
[1:19:56] the works they saw Jesus doing the sign
[1:19:58] of the Messiah they saw the people being
[1:20:01] healed and delivered and set free and
[1:20:03] all of a sudden a jealousy rose up among
[1:20:06] the church amen and they crucified him
[1:20:10] ain't that right so you know brother
[1:20:12] brandham says this the same thing today
[1:20:14] the Baptist wants to outdo the Methodist
[1:20:17] the Methodist wants to outdo the
[1:20:19] Lutheran the Lutheran wants to outdo the
[1:20:21] Catholic everybody wanting to outdo
[1:20:23] somebody you understand what I'm saying
[1:20:25] see and and it shows that they are
[1:20:28] anointed by an evil spirit now there are
[1:20:31] only two Powers at work today and we we
[1:20:35] know that and and I think it really
[1:20:37] takes the grace of God for us to really
[1:20:41] understand that that it's it's not the
[1:20:43] people it's it's it's it's powers and
[1:20:46] there's only two powers that work and
[1:20:48] one's a demonic power and one's a
[1:20:50] supernatural power one's a spiritual
[1:20:53] power of the Holy Ghost and and the
[1:20:55] other one is the devil that is working
[1:20:58] through intellectual power a ain't that
[1:21:01] right and so brother Brandon said now
[1:21:03] Satan's power is really not a real power
[1:21:07] but it's actually a perverted power that
[1:21:11] he takes God's power and perverts it he
[1:21:14] takes what God does and he perverts it
[1:21:16] ain't that right see like God's power
[1:21:18] takes a man and and makes a saint out of
[1:21:21] him ain't that right Satan takes that he
[1:21:24] can take that man and and by his power
[1:21:27] make him a sinner make him a renegade
[1:21:29] make him so evil and vile that the world
[1:21:33] don't want nothing to do with him you
[1:21:35] know see so God's power brings life
[1:21:37] Satan's power brings death amen but it's
[1:21:40] all a perversion God's power sets a man
[1:21:43] free Satan's power binds a man in in the
[1:21:47] chains of Darkness I I thought of how
[1:21:49] that churches ought to be uh uh be a
[1:21:51] place where Freedom Reigns and and the
[1:21:54] sound of freedom rings and and yet how
[1:21:57] many people set Bound in in even in
[1:22:00] churches today and and yet they're
[1:22:03] they're claiming to be Christians
[1:22:04] they're they're claiming to believe the
[1:22:06] Bible they're claiming but yet there's a
[1:22:09] power that is binding them maybe that
[1:22:12] bound them with complexes bound them
[1:22:14] with insecurities bound them with the
[1:22:16] past bound them with with lust bound
[1:22:19] them with all kinds of things amen and
[1:22:21] that man as long as he's bound he can't
[1:22:23] have peace
[1:22:25] amen he's he just can't have peace he's
[1:22:27] tormented for That's what Satan is is a
[1:22:30] Tormentor amen you can't get peace from
[1:22:33] torment ain't that right see so then we
[1:22:36] find that that these two Powers now you
[1:22:40] know the again the kingdoms of the world
[1:22:42] are dominated by the power of Satan and
[1:22:45] they're going to fight and and the
[1:22:48] prophet said he is the head of all
[1:22:50] political power everybody say that he's
[1:22:53] the head of of all political power I
[1:22:56] don't care who what side it is
[1:22:58] Republican Democrat independent or or
[1:23:01] non-existent I don't care he is the the
[1:23:05] the ruler of all political power can you
[1:23:09] say amen amen that's right see and so
[1:23:13] then we find that that that God now is
[1:23:17] bringing the prophet said he's bringing
[1:23:19] in the great Kingdom great civilization
[1:23:23] that'll be brought down under his own
[1:23:26] great
[1:23:28] Dominion oh my so this this city of
[1:23:31] peace that we're looking for is not
[1:23:33] under the domain of Satan but it's under
[1:23:37] the domain of God Amen there will be
[1:23:40] Never Be Another War Nations won't lift
[1:23:42] up Spears against Nations they'll all be
[1:23:46] peace and it will be an eternal peace
[1:23:49] now we can see by the scriptures just
[1:23:52] how close we are to this
[1:23:55] amen um you know I I I thought of uh
[1:23:59] Daniel in in the the chapter n and verse
[1:24:03] one it says in the first year of Darius
[1:24:06] the son of acerus uh of the seed of the
[1:24:10] M which was made King over the rim of
[1:24:13] the Chans in the first year of his Reign
[1:24:16] I Daniel understood by books the number
[1:24:19] of the years whereof the word of the
[1:24:22] Lord came to Jeremiah the Prophet that
[1:24:25] he would accomplish 70 years in the
[1:24:28] desolations of Jerusalem now notice as
[1:24:31] his understanding he understood by the
[1:24:34] books and then he says and I set my face
[1:24:37] unto the Lord God to seek by prayer and
[1:24:41] supplication with fasting and sackcloth
[1:24:44] and Ashes ain't that right why he was
[1:24:48] earnestly wanting to know where the time
[1:24:52] was he was diligent ly he wasn't out
[1:24:55] there just just uh in entertainment and
[1:24:58] wrapped up with the cares of life but he
[1:25:01] understood that time was close he
[1:25:04] understood what that that the there
[1:25:06] there would be an end to this captivity
[1:25:09] and and he was Yearning For Freedom he
[1:25:12] was yearning for these things see and
[1:25:15] and so therefore he got an understanding
[1:25:17] of the time he was living in amen he was
[1:25:21] living in a a country that he was an
[1:25:23] alien in it wasn't his country he didn't
[1:25:27] belong in it the prophet said he was OED
[1:25:29] from his people ousted from his church
[1:25:32] without uh uh one church service without
[1:25:35] any church to go to without any hymns to
[1:25:37] be sang uh but what he Sayang himself in
[1:25:41] the midst of all of this still held on
[1:25:43] to what that Prophet said I want to ask
[1:25:47] you are you holding on to what that
[1:25:49] Prophet said I know that you people are
[1:25:52] diluting the prophet's words today and
[1:25:55] and and and they're they're they're
[1:25:56] misconstruing everything he said and and
[1:25:59] and putting it down like it was really
[1:26:01] nothing and and and taken part of it and
[1:26:04] well it's inspired and other parts ain't
[1:26:07] inspired and and and and and it's sad
[1:26:09] but but I guarantee you they wouldn't
[1:26:11] have done that when he was on the earth
[1:26:13] amen with his ministry I mean it was
[1:26:15] challenged all around the world come and
[1:26:17] Stand By Me and see you know you you
[1:26:19] let's just stand this and let's try this
[1:26:20] and not one would stand by him and and
[1:26:22] dispute it why because they knew that
[1:26:25] God was with that man they knew that
[1:26:27] there was an anointing amen that no
[1:26:29] other man had had Amen in in their
[1:26:32] denominations and in in in the church
[1:26:34] ages uh in in in as far as that goes you
[1:26:38] understand amen but they're doing it
[1:26:39] today but there was a man and and and
[1:26:42] just a very few that hung on to that
[1:26:45] prophet's words and and and by that
[1:26:48] prophet's words he he would know that
[1:26:51] time was short he he knew that that
[1:26:54] something had to give way amen see and
[1:26:58] so we find that that God showed amen
[1:27:01] Daniel that there wasn't a lot of time
[1:27:03] for his people the Jews and and and not
[1:27:06] only for the 70 weeks uh or or or uh in
[1:27:10] that time of captivity I think he had
[1:27:12] two years left or whatever amen but God
[1:27:15] would tell him he had 70 weeks left for
[1:27:17] the the the uh determined for thy people
[1:27:21] uh the Jews ain't that right I ain't
[1:27:23] going to get into all that but we know
[1:27:25] that the weeks uh are not considered
[1:27:28] like we would consider a week amen uh uh
[1:27:32] seven days in a week it it wasn't that
[1:27:35] at all but but the point is that I want
[1:27:37] to make is that God uh the prophet said
[1:27:40] God alloted them exactly a day an hour
[1:27:45] and time ain't that right amen he
[1:27:49] allotted that to them but God never did
[1:27:52] that to us gentiles
[1:27:54] he never allotted this and and the only
[1:27:57] thing he would say Luke 21 and 24 and
[1:28:00] they shall fall by the edge of the sword
[1:28:03] and shall be led away captive uh into
[1:28:06] all nations and Jerusalem shall be
[1:28:08] trotten down of the Gentiles until
[1:28:11] everybody say until the times of the
[1:28:14] Gentiles be fulfilled amen so so that
[1:28:18] leaves a wide margin as to when will
[1:28:22] that be fulfilled when will F the times
[1:28:25] of the Gentiles see so the times of the
[1:28:27] Gentiles is a mystery as to when it will
[1:28:30] be filled fulfilled but when it is
[1:28:34] fulfilled then God is finished with the
[1:28:37] gentile people do you believe that amen
[1:28:40] when it is fulfilled then God is
[1:28:43] finished with the gentile people then
[1:28:46] comes the Fulfillment of Revelations
[1:28:48] 2211 he that is unjust let him be unjust
[1:28:52] still let he that is filthy then let him
[1:28:56] be filthy still he that is righteous let
[1:28:59] him be righteous still he that is Holy
[1:29:01] let him be holy still amen see so there
[1:29:05] is a time that is coming that that line
[1:29:09] is drawn amen and only God knows when
[1:29:12] that time is now but God the prophet
[1:29:14] said left us a signpost he left us a
[1:29:18] signpost and I I truly believe today
[1:29:21] that that God does not leave us ignorant
[1:29:24] the the scriptures revealed by the
[1:29:27] prophet of the hour does not leave us
[1:29:30] ignorant amen as to the day that we're
[1:29:33] living in ain't that right now uh uh
[1:29:36] just for a a few more moments and then
[1:29:39] we will close but the Book of Daniel
[1:29:41] talks about the Gentile kingdoms um as a
[1:29:45] as a whole uh uh King Nebuchadnezzar had
[1:29:48] a dream and needed someone to interpret
[1:29:51] it and so so God showed the Prophet
[1:29:55] Daniel not only the dream but also the
[1:29:59] vision or the interpretation of the
[1:30:02] dream and and so Daniel
[1:30:05] 231 it says Thou oh King sawest and
[1:30:08] behold a great image and and this great
[1:30:12] image whose brightness was excellent
[1:30:15] stood before thee and the form thereof
[1:30:18] was terrible and this image's head was a
[1:30:21] fine gold and his breast and his arms of
[1:30:24] silver his belly and his thighs of brass
[1:30:28] and his legs of iron his feet part of
[1:30:31] iron and part of clay amen so then the
[1:30:35] SE 37th verse thou oh king art a king of
[1:30:39] King of Kings and for the god of Heaven
[1:30:42] hath given thee a kingdom power strength
[1:30:46] and glory and wheresoever the children
[1:30:49] of men dwell the Beast of the field the
[1:30:52] fowls of the heaven hath he given into
[1:30:55] thine hand and hath made thee ruler over
[1:30:59] them all thou art this head of gold and
[1:31:04] after thee shall arise another kingdom
[1:31:07] inferior to thee and another third
[1:31:10] Kingdom of brass which shall bear rule
[1:31:13] over all the Earth notice and the fourth
[1:31:16] Kingdom shall be strong as iron for as
[1:31:21] much as iron breth in in pieces and
[1:31:25] subdueth all things and as iron that
[1:31:29] breakthe shall it break in pieces and
[1:31:33] bruis so that's a a mighty uh uh that
[1:31:37] fourth kingdom is a mighty thing right
[1:31:40] aen a conqueror and whereas thou sawest
[1:31:44] the feet and Toes part of Potter's clay
[1:31:47] and part of iron the kingdom shall be
[1:31:49] divided and there shall be in it of the
[1:31:52] strength of the iron for as much as thou
[1:31:55] sawest the iron mixed with my Reay and
[1:31:58] the toes of the feet were part of iron
[1:32:01] and part of clay so the kingdom shall be
[1:32:03] partly strong and partly broken and
[1:32:07] whereas thou sawest iron mixed with my
[1:32:10] clay they shall mingle themselves with
[1:32:12] the seed of men but they shall not
[1:32:15] cleave one to another even as iron is
[1:32:18] not mixed with Clay amen now brother
[1:32:21] brandham talks about this a lot but but
[1:32:24] these are four Gentile kingdoms amen and
[1:32:28] and um uh of course Babylon King
[1:32:31] Nebuchadnezzar was the head of the gold
[1:32:34] and then you find that the MS of the
[1:32:36] Persians amen they came after amen and
[1:32:40] conquered and and they were the silver
[1:32:43] uh which is uh brother Bram said now is
[1:32:45] the Hindu of India uh there and then
[1:32:48] then after that there come uh the
[1:32:51] kingdom of the Greece uh which was the
[1:32:53] the brass uh Alexander the Great and
[1:32:56] then Rome everybody say Rome which was
[1:33:00] the fourth Kingdom the iron ain't that
[1:33:03] right and and it was in the feet and it
[1:33:06] ran in the toes and which would mean
[1:33:09] that this fourth Kingdom uh uh would uh
[1:33:13] uh exist all the way to the end amen of
[1:33:17] the Gentile dispensation ain't that
[1:33:20] right now the different Golds or or
[1:33:24] Metals here uh Gold Silver and and uh uh
[1:33:28] brass and iron each one it starts with
[1:33:31] the softest but it ALS it gets harder so
[1:33:33] gold is is softer and then silver is a
[1:33:36] little harder than gold and Brass is
[1:33:38] harder than silver and and iron is the
[1:33:41] hardest of them all and and notice what
[1:33:45] iron symbolizes in the Bible it is
[1:33:48] symbolizes chastisement Affliction uh
[1:33:51] Deuteronomy 4:20 it also symbolizes
[1:33:54] slavery uh Deuteronomy 28 and uh 48 it
[1:33:58] also symbolizes strength um uh job 40
[1:34:02] and 18 it it symbolizes political
[1:34:06] strength uh Daniel 2:33 and and uh
[1:34:10] symbolizes fortitude uh Jeremiah 1:18 it
[1:34:14] also symbolizes moral de
[1:34:18] deterioration Jeremiah
[1:34:20] 6:28 and and then it did uh uh uh it it
[1:34:24] it symbolizes destructive power uh found
[1:34:28] there in Daniel
[1:34:30] 7:7 and so uh Nebuchadnezzar he thought
[1:34:34] that the kingdom I mean we all know I
[1:34:37] guess most of us know his story got
[1:34:38] lifted up in Pride and as he was looking
[1:34:41] at his kingdom and he thought man I
[1:34:43] built all this and he thought it was a
[1:34:44] great Kingdom and he he actually thought
[1:34:47] that that nothing could defeat him and
[1:34:50] and of course in all reality they they
[1:34:52] probably shouldn't have but we found
[1:34:55] that someone left the gate open uh and
[1:34:57] and the enemy come through that gate and
[1:35:00] I bet it was all planned of God because
[1:35:02] it was all in Prophecy because no
[1:35:05] Kingdom can last here we have no
[1:35:08] continuing City ain't that right and and
[1:35:12] so we we find that he thought it would
[1:35:14] be that way but here comes the mes and
[1:35:16] the Persians and and the prophet said
[1:35:18] they were just as ruthless and ungodly
[1:35:20] as Russia and they came in through that
[1:35:22] gate and conquer ain't that right and so
[1:35:25] all three of these kingdoms the the the
[1:35:28] gold silver and and Brass they've been
[1:35:30] conquered they they are a thing of
[1:35:32] History amen uh you you read about these
[1:35:35] nations in history and and the glory of
[1:35:38] them and all of that because here we
[1:35:41] have no continuing City so these were
[1:35:44] not would be not the cities that we are
[1:35:46] looking for and and and so you you you
[1:35:49] can study them and and and but yet it
[1:35:52] doesn't benefit F us to try to resurrect
[1:35:55] them because God has showed us that
[1:35:58] these kingdoms no matter how great they
[1:36:00] would seem to be and no matter how much
[1:36:02] of a superpower and no matter how much
[1:36:04] they rule the world and how long they
[1:36:06] rule the world they have to come to its
[1:36:09] end can you sayen so then we find that
[1:36:12] Rome being the fourth Kingdom runs all
[1:36:15] the way out to the End Amen and and and
[1:36:19] and I have to say church and and I know
[1:36:21] you know these things amen but we are
[1:36:24] living in the in if I could say it this
[1:36:26] way the day of the tolls we are living
[1:36:29] at the end how many believes that amen
[1:36:32] we're living at the end and and it's
[1:36:34] amazing that even the the prophet would
[1:36:36] give us he said I'm going to give you
[1:36:38] let you in on a little secret here and
[1:36:39] he and he he talked about the the the
[1:36:42] meeting that uh uh the the Russian
[1:36:44] president I can't remember his name uh
[1:36:47] back then and Eisenhower where they met
[1:36:50] uh what was ITF Cru amen uh the
[1:36:53] president kusf and and how that they
[1:36:55] they had this meeting and was it kusf
[1:36:57] that took off his shoe and beat the
[1:36:59] table with amen and and brother Brown
[1:37:01] says see right there is a sign to us in
[1:37:04] the age that we're living in he said I
[1:37:07] eisenh means what clay iron Eisenhower
[1:37:10] meant iron and and uh uh the other one
[1:37:14] meant clay and and they couldn't mingle
[1:37:16] they couldn't mix there there there and
[1:37:18] brother Bram said that's a sign to us in
[1:37:21] the day that's just one of the signs
[1:37:22] ain't that right amen see and so iron
[1:37:25] and Clay what is that it's romanism the
[1:37:28] prophet said and Protestant mixed
[1:37:31] together ain't that right he said
[1:37:33] Protestant and Catholicism under the
[1:37:36] same Gentile domination and he said that
[1:37:40] even they would even try to break one
[1:37:42] another's power and they would intermar
[1:37:45] with one another just exactly what they
[1:37:48] are doing today aren't you glad for a
[1:37:51] prophet amen to let us know where we're
[1:37:55] at living at in the image of of of of
[1:37:58] that that had been prophesied years and
[1:38:01] years and years ago thousands of years
[1:38:03] ago ain't that right and and the prophet
[1:38:07] said that hard iron dominated over the
[1:38:10] other and we're seeing that exactly take
[1:38:14] place Amen to where the Protestants are
[1:38:17] now looking and going back to
[1:38:21] mother a ain't that right these things
[1:38:25] are Bible is being fulfilled right and
[1:38:28] left before our
[1:38:30] eyes you believe that now so so we look
[1:38:34] now amen that these nations these the
[1:38:38] had a power behind it and and Daniel 7
[1:38:42] And1 it says in the first year of
[1:38:45] belshazzar King of Babylon Daniel had a
[1:38:48] dream and visions of his head upon his
[1:38:51] bed uh then he wrote the dream
[1:38:54] and told the sum of the matters Daniel
[1:38:57] spake and said I saw in my vision By
[1:39:00] Night amen Behold The Four Winds of the
[1:39:03] heaven strove upon the great sea and
[1:39:07] four great Beast came from the up from
[1:39:09] the sea diverse from one another the
[1:39:12] first was like a lion and had Eagle
[1:39:15] wings and I beheld till the wings
[1:39:18] thereof were plucked and it was lifted
[1:39:20] up from the earth and made uh and and
[1:39:23] made uh stand upon the feet as a man and
[1:39:27] a man's heart was given to it and behold
[1:39:30] another Beast a second like to a bear
[1:39:34] and it raised up itself on one side and
[1:39:37] it had uh three ribs in the mouth of it
[1:39:41] between the teeth of it and they said
[1:39:44] thus unto it arise devour much flesh and
[1:39:48] after this I beheld and lo another like
[1:39:51] a leopard which had upon the back of it
[1:39:55] four wings of a foul the Beast had also
[1:39:59] fourheads and Dominion was given to it
[1:40:02] ain't that right so here's three Beast
[1:40:05] uh that Daniel that we've read about
[1:40:07] that Daniel mentions and of course the
[1:40:09] prophet tells us that Beast represents
[1:40:12] what power Beast represents power so
[1:40:16] each one of these kingdoms dominated the
[1:40:19] World by their power and and and and and
[1:40:23] I if I had time I'd go and and and and
[1:40:26] and compare what Nebuchadnezzar was and
[1:40:29] and these uh and and how he fit that
[1:40:32] perfectly uh of the the first like a
[1:40:34] lion had Eagle's Wings and and things
[1:40:37] like that and and and things like that
[1:40:39] but but all these nations they devoured
[1:40:41] and they conquered ain't that right so
[1:40:44] Nebuchadnezzar amen his power was again
[1:40:47] the first was like a lion that had Eagle
[1:40:50] wings the second like to a bear and it
[1:40:52] was told to arise and devour much flesh
[1:40:55] which was the mes and the Persians and
[1:40:57] the third like a leopard and and
[1:40:59] Dominion was given to it which was
[1:41:01] Alexander the Great and and and if you
[1:41:04] notice each of these animals are animals
[1:41:07] of of prey they they are Hunters ain't
[1:41:09] that right and and they it's it's a
[1:41:12] power of the devil that that was running
[1:41:16] these
[1:41:18] kingdoms can you say amen amen and
[1:41:21] brother Brandon said they are national
[1:41:23] Powers now in the opening of the seals
[1:41:26] you'll see that that them the the the
[1:41:28] the church Powers hello the white horse
[1:41:32] rider the red hor the red horse rider
[1:41:34] the black horse rider and the pale horse
[1:41:37] rider can you say Amen but these are
[1:41:39] National powers that have been driving
[1:41:42] the Nations and they are demonic Powers
[1:41:46] amen ain't that right but see here we
[1:41:50] have no continuing City so no matter
[1:41:53] what Satan does and how he can raise up
[1:41:55] a kingdom and establish it and make it
[1:41:58] look so secure there will be no
[1:42:01] peace
[1:42:03] amen praise the lord we have even been
[1:42:06] raised as a superpower in this nation
[1:42:08] it's a superpower and look we're all
[1:42:10] constantly having to watch our
[1:42:13] back can you say
[1:42:15] amen amen see and so therefore Daniel
[1:42:18] was beholding the nature and
[1:42:20] characteristics of these kingdoms and
[1:42:23] the powers that dominated the kingdom
[1:42:26] now what power is dominating the world
[1:42:29] today let's look at the fourth power and
[1:42:32] and in the seventh verse it says after
[1:42:35] this I saw in the night visions and
[1:42:37] behold a fourth Beast
[1:42:39] Dreadful and terrible and strong
[1:42:44] exceedingly ain't that right and it had
[1:42:47] great iron teeth it divided and break in
[1:42:52] pieces and amp the residue with the feet
[1:42:54] of it and it was diverse from all the
[1:42:57] beasts that were before it and it had 10
[1:43:00] horns amen so we know that this is
[1:43:06] Rome ain't that right and the power of
[1:43:10] that
[1:43:11] iron that fourth Beast that fourth
[1:43:14] Kingdom this is the power of it the
[1:43:16] Beast that he saw Dreadful terrible
[1:43:19] strong exceedingly had great iron teeth
[1:43:22] it divid fired it break and stamped the
[1:43:24] residue with the feet of it ain't that
[1:43:27] right it was this power was diverse from
[1:43:29] any other power before
[1:43:32] it ain't that right you can even look at
[1:43:35] at Titus when he and and just for
[1:43:38] example but you could take a history of
[1:43:40] Rome but when Titus took over Jerusalem
[1:43:42] history says that the blood ran like
[1:43:45] Rivers ain't that right and notice how
[1:43:49] how that when when it come over uh
[1:43:51] Matthew 24:2 Jesus said unto them see
[1:43:54] see ye not all these things verily I say
[1:43:57] unto you there shall not be left here
[1:43:59] one stone upon another that shall not be
[1:44:02] thrown down when Titus in Jo Josephus
[1:44:06] history Titus made them dig all the way
[1:44:09] down break them Stones I mean they were
[1:44:10] all stone walls of Jerusalem he made
[1:44:13] them tear every stone one by one apart
[1:44:16] and then dig down all the way to the
[1:44:18] foundation to make sure that nothing was
[1:44:22] left all right
[1:44:24] true that's that
[1:44:27] beast and he starved history says he
[1:44:30] starved the chill or the people out to
[1:44:32] where that they ate their own
[1:44:35] children brother Brown says see they
[1:44:37] bowled one another's children and eat it
[1:44:39] and they they ate the bark of uh of off
[1:44:42] the trees and the grass off the ground
[1:44:44] and then they finally had to give up see
[1:44:47] Titus went in there and he utterly
[1:44:48] destroyed everything in there killed
[1:44:50] women children babies priests everything
[1:44:53] else and then burnt the city ain't that
[1:44:55] right see what was it it was Pagan Rome
[1:44:58] it was also Pagan Rome that killed all
[1:45:00] the children to and under in in trying
[1:45:02] to find uh when Jesus was born ain't
[1:45:05] that right amen see then it was also uh
[1:45:08] Rome under Nero that that uh Nero that
[1:45:12] that persecuted the Christians and
[1:45:14] history says that he hooked his mother
[1:45:16] to a single tree of a horse and Drug her
[1:45:18] through the streets and set the city of
[1:45:20] fire and while doing that he played his
[1:45:23] fiddle up on the hill you know and and
[1:45:25] he say see it's that same kind of a
[1:45:27] spirit that's dominating the church that
[1:45:31] sits in the place of
[1:45:33] pagan ain't that right see so so we we
[1:45:37] find that in another place Christians
[1:45:39] were covered with hides of wild beast
[1:45:42] and bitten to death by dogs nailed to
[1:45:44] crosses at night time they were burned
[1:45:47] to serve as a light in in Nero's courty
[1:45:49] yard and while he played the fiddle see
[1:45:52] and all of this was a National Power a
[1:45:55] National Power and and a demonic ain't
[1:45:58] that right now if you turn uh we look in
[1:46:02] in Revelations
[1:46:03] 13:1 John saw that same fourth beast and
[1:46:07] we'll we'll hurry here uh uh he saw the
[1:46:10] same Beast that Daniel saw and he says
[1:46:13] and I stood and and upon the sand of the
[1:46:16] sea and saw a beast rise up out of the
[1:46:19] sea having seven heads a beast of pray
[1:46:23] it was a beast of prey and ungodly power
[1:46:25] the prophet said having 10 horns and
[1:46:28] upon his horns 10 crowns and upon his
[1:46:31] head uh heads the name of blasphemy and
[1:46:34] we won't go into all that today but but
[1:46:37] it's it's the fourth beast and brother
[1:46:39] Braham said it's a power everybody say
[1:46:41] it's a power rising up amongst the
[1:46:45] people ain't that right for Waters
[1:46:48] represent people ain't that right so so
[1:46:51] then then we we find that John's Visions
[1:46:54] here showed that the prophet said showed
[1:46:56] that it was Powers Nations rising up but
[1:47:01] notice that fourth Beast that Daniel or
[1:47:03] that John is seeing and the Beast which
[1:47:05] I saw was like unto a leper and his feet
[1:47:10] were as the feet of a bear and the his
[1:47:14] mouth as the mouth of a lion hello so
[1:47:18] all the powers before it was wrapped up
[1:47:21] in this one
[1:47:23] right true and the dragons which was
[1:47:26] Satan gave him his power and his seat
[1:47:30] and great
[1:47:32] Authority so it had four different
[1:47:35] characters in this Force beast and this
[1:47:38] is where we're living
[1:47:41] today at the beginning of the Gentile
[1:47:43] dispensation Daniel saw four be
[1:47:46] separated at the end of the Gentile
[1:47:49] dispensation John sees it all gather
[1:47:52] together in that fourth
[1:47:54] Beast ain't that right so brother Bram
[1:47:57] said see John seeing it and the end of
[1:48:00] the Gentile ruling all four of those
[1:48:02] beasts represented one see the same old
[1:48:06] Devils demons that possessed each
[1:48:08] kingdom of the Romans down through the
[1:48:10] Greeks and so forth down through the
[1:48:12] Gentile dispensation has come right down
[1:48:16] and all of them have met up in one
[1:48:20] Beast talking about the lid of hell
[1:48:22] being poured
[1:48:24] out on This
[1:48:26] Nation can you imagine what we're
[1:48:28] dealing with what is consuming this
[1:48:31] world what's causing this thing to fall
[1:48:34] apart and everything going crazy can you
[1:48:37] sayen now that was Pagan
[1:48:40] Rome but then we
[1:48:42] find that John would go on to say in the
[1:48:46] third verse 13 chapter and I saw one of
[1:48:49] his heads as it were wounded to death
[1:48:53] which was what we know as paganism Pagan
[1:48:56] Rome it looks like it died but according
[1:48:59] to Daniel's prophecy it couldn't die
[1:49:03] because it had to go all the way to the
[1:49:05] end of the Gentile
[1:49:08] dispensation can you say Amen the T toes
[1:49:12] that's right see so you know brother
[1:49:14] Brown said see when it died when Pagan
[1:49:17] Rome died the world thought that it was
[1:49:19] over that that Rome could not rule
[1:49:22] anymore anymore and and and and history
[1:49:25] says that Rome fell you know uh uh The
[1:49:27] Barbarians and things uh uh uh uh
[1:49:30] conquered conquered Rome and she Brother
[1:49:33] Brad said she lost her temporary power
[1:49:36] notice how he says it this didn't say
[1:49:38] she lost her power she lost her
[1:49:40] temporary power he says the nation that
[1:49:43] ruled by crushing all which became the
[1:49:47] strongest ow ever known was finally
[1:49:50] wounded to death her power was
[1:49:53] physically gone as to control by armies
[1:49:56] Etc can you say Amen but then Daniel
[1:50:00] would say or John would say and his
[1:50:02] deadly wound was
[1:50:05] healed and brother BR said what was that
[1:50:08] it was now the Church paple Rome see
[1:50:12] take them the place joined with
[1:50:15] Christianity with the Nicol itans and
[1:50:18] the world and all the world John said
[1:50:21] wandered after the Beast they marveled
[1:50:25] after the beast but she lived
[1:50:28] again she was wounded to death Pagan
[1:50:31] Rome died but the wound was healed when
[1:50:35] she become a
[1:50:36] church can you say Amen so brother Bram
[1:50:40] would tell us that Nan Council swung the
[1:50:43] power of political Rome to the church
[1:50:46] and once it did that same demons same
[1:50:51] everything but notice once it did that
[1:50:54] there were no
[1:50:56] limits to which this First Christian
[1:50:59] Church would go to No Limits the name
[1:51:03] Christianity or name Christian which
[1:51:05] originally brought persecution upon the
[1:51:08] Christians just to say that you're a
[1:51:10] Christian it brought persecution now
[1:51:13] became the name of the persecutors yes
[1:51:18] amen what a prophet said but under
[1:51:21] Constantine she came back to life for
[1:51:24] Papa Rome has infiltrated now it shows
[1:51:28] that we're at the toes now it's
[1:51:30] infiltrated through the whole world and
[1:51:34] her power is
[1:51:36] absolute she uses Kings and Merchants
[1:51:39] and in her deadly religious financial
[1:51:42] and financial strength she is governing
[1:51:45] as the goddess of this present
[1:51:49] age
[1:51:51] amen he says here people look at Rome
[1:51:54] they look at the nation of Italy and as
[1:51:57] they as they look they do not realize
[1:51:59] that Rome with her strict confines where
[1:52:01] the pope has an actual area as his
[1:52:04] domain is literally a nation within a
[1:52:06] nation and she has ambassadors and
[1:52:09] receives ambassadors and every every
[1:52:12] president that I've in my lifetime
[1:52:14] anyway is all as soon as they somewhere
[1:52:17] soon as they get in in the office they
[1:52:19] automatically go to
[1:52:21] Rome Papo false Christian Rome he says
[1:52:25] she even is even called at the Eternal
[1:52:28] City think of that her power is so great
[1:52:32] her influence is so great that she calls
[1:52:34] herself an eternal City but that's not
[1:52:37] the city that we're looking
[1:52:39] for ain't that right right and so she
[1:52:44] even she is even called The Eternal City
[1:52:46] city how Blasphemous Now controls by
[1:52:49] religion even more aily
[1:52:53] her control is even more able than when
[1:52:57] Pagan Imperial Rome controlled by the
[1:52:59] pure iron of
[1:53:01] force ain't that amazing see so Rome to
[1:53:04] Rome took on a new lease of life when
[1:53:07] Constantine joined church and state and
[1:53:09] back the Union by force the spirit that
[1:53:12] motivated Pagan Rome is the same spirit
[1:53:15] that now motivates false Christian Rome
[1:53:18] can you say Amen now you you you'll
[1:53:20] begin to understand why we are against
[1:53:23] denominations amen can you say amen amen
[1:53:26] see you you can see that it is so
[1:53:28] because you now know that the fourth
[1:53:32] Empire never went out of existence but
[1:53:35] it just changed it in its outer texture
[1:53:39] ain't that right so now notice what did
[1:53:42] political Pagan Rome do that was the
[1:53:44] basis of her success she divided and
[1:53:48] conquered can you say that with me
[1:53:50] divided and conquered that's what Pagan
[1:53:53] Rome did that was her success she
[1:53:54] divided and conquered see that was the
[1:53:57] seed of Rome divide and conquer her iron
[1:54:00] teeth uh tore and deved whom she tore
[1:54:03] and deved could not rise again as when
[1:54:06] she destroyed Carthage and swed her to
[1:54:09] Salt see and the same notice the same
[1:54:13] iron seed remained in her when she arose
[1:54:16] as the false church and her policy has
[1:54:19] remained the same divide and
[1:54:23] coner
[1:54:24] hello and when she devided the Lutheran
[1:54:28] they've never Rosen again and when she
[1:54:31] devoured the wlans they never rose again
[1:54:35] and when she devoured the Pentecostals
[1:54:37] they've never risen again they're crying
[1:54:39] for Revival Revival Revival but they'll
[1:54:42] never rise again can you say Amen why
[1:54:46] her influence has got in
[1:54:48] there amen this nation will never rise
[1:54:51] again
[1:54:53] her influence has got into the
[1:54:55] nation that is true amen ain't that
[1:54:58] right divide and conquer divide and
[1:55:01] conquer we've never had so much division
[1:55:03] in in this land than ever before divide
[1:55:06] and conquer amen ain't that right and
[1:55:10] power was given to him remember that set
[1:55:13] there on to take peace from the earth is
[1:55:16] that not found in the
[1:55:17] seals that same spirit that red riter
[1:55:22] that's right come on now power was given
[1:55:24] unto him to take peace from the Earth
[1:55:26] all right is he still not
[1:55:29] here all them four all them four powers
[1:55:32] of line are are mixed up in this
[1:55:36] age can you say Amen that they should
[1:55:40] kill one another and they would and
[1:55:42] there was given unto him a great sword
[1:55:45] ain't that right we could go on and on
[1:55:48] but notice in that fourth verse uh
[1:55:50] Revelations 13:4 and they wor worship
[1:55:52] the dragon which gave power unto the
[1:55:54] Beast and they worshiped the Beast and
[1:55:57] notice it's it's in this time that they
[1:55:59] worship and Satan has become the god of
[1:56:02] this Earth and we all know that Satan
[1:56:04] will be incarnate in a man one of these
[1:56:06] days and it ain't going to be much
[1:56:07] longer can you say Amen which gave power
[1:56:11] un the Beast they worshiped the Beast
[1:56:12] saying who is liken to the Beast amen
[1:56:15] who is able to make war with him they
[1:56:18] look at this thing as some Eternal
[1:56:20] substance who is able to defeat him who
[1:56:23] is able to survive or or or uh yes to
[1:56:26] survive when they come against
[1:56:28] him he seems
[1:56:34] Immortal brother Ram said there's not
[1:56:36] one man in the world that's got to say
[1:56:38] so that the pope of Rome
[1:56:40] has he says the president iron Heiser
[1:56:43] can speak in the United States and its
[1:56:45] law but other nations he can speak into
[1:56:47] and it's nothing but the but but the
[1:56:50] Catholic hierarchy can speak in Rome and
[1:56:52] every Every Nation will holler to it he
[1:56:54] said there's one one man that's big
[1:56:56] everywhere and that's the pope yes sir
[1:56:59] can you say amen he has the power to
[1:57:01] stop Wars he has the power to stop
[1:57:04] things amen don't think that he's not
[1:57:06] behind things that are going on in this
[1:57:08] world that's right he knows it's he's
[1:57:11] he's there's something going on can you
[1:57:13] say
[1:57:14] Amen yes sir amen but here we are we we
[1:57:18] we show it shows that we're living in
[1:57:20] the time of the T toe
[1:57:22] brother Bri said cath Catholicism has
[1:57:24] swept into every nation under the
[1:57:26] heavens ain't that right but as we close
[1:57:30] we look for a city
[1:57:32] amen an eternal city of Peace how is
[1:57:36] this to happen what what what is this
[1:57:38] and we didn't read the rest of it so
[1:57:40] we'll read
[1:57:43] it but Daniel saw a
[1:57:46] stone when he saw that whole all the
[1:57:50] Gentile kingdoms and he saw that Rome
[1:57:53] coming through the end of the toes there
[1:57:55] he saw a
[1:57:56] stone that stone was cut out of the
[1:57:59] mountain without hands amen now we you
[1:58:02] and I all know who that is that's Christ
[1:58:04] the Virgin
[1:58:06] birth the Lord right Born of a virgin
[1:58:10] had nothing to do man-made had nothing
[1:58:12] to do about man that's right and this
[1:58:15] Stone was cut out of the mountain
[1:58:16] without hands and smok that image upon
[1:58:19] his feet that's right that were of iron
[1:58:22] iron and clay and break them to Pieces
[1:58:24] Lord then was the iron the clay the
[1:58:27] brass the silver and the gold broken to
[1:58:29] pieces together and became like the
[1:58:32] shaft of the summer threshing floors and
[1:58:36] the wind carried them away that no place
[1:58:40] everybody say no place was found for
[1:58:43] them
[1:58:44] amen not going to be inable be able to
[1:58:48] infiltrate themselves them Spirits
[1:58:50] through the kingdoms like they did in
[1:58:52] this fourth Kingdom there is no place
[1:58:56] found for them and the stone with that
[1:59:00] smok that image became a great mountain
[1:59:03] and filled the whole
[1:59:05] earth Daniel 244 it says in the days of
[1:59:09] the Kings shall the god of Heaven set up
[1:59:12] a kingdom that which will never be
[1:59:15] destroyed and the kingdom shall not be
[1:59:17] left to other people but it shall break
[1:59:20] in pieces and consume all all these
[1:59:23] kingdoms and it shall stand forever for
[1:59:26] as much as thou sawest that the stone
[1:59:29] was cut out of the mountain without
[1:59:31] hands that it break in pieces the iron
[1:59:34] the brass the clay or the silver and the
[1:59:36] gold and the great God hath made known
[1:59:39] to the king what shall come to pass
[1:59:42] Hereafter and the dream is certain and
[1:59:45] the
[1:59:46] interpretation thereof Shore no wonder
[1:59:49] Daniel after seeing everything he saw
[1:59:52] all the end of the he saw the church
[1:59:54] ages all through it and saw at the end
[1:59:57] of it and there he was at the in our day
[1:59:58] he was caught up in the day of the Lord
[2:00:01] that when he saw it all he could say
