your licks of fire amen and um expect the Lord to be with us tonight enjoyed the uh the songs the special amen and um if you have your Bibles we're just going to go right on into the word and um we're going to turn to Philippians the 2 chap chapter the book of Philippians the second chapter amen and before we go into the word may we just bow our head and talk to our Lord Heavenly Father we're so thankful that we can testify of your keeping power we Are Witnesses Lord of your Resurrection Lord within us father that Eternal something Lord that even when this body gives away and the corruption Decay tries to set in sickness or whatever it would be there's that Eternal quality within us father and that keeps us pressing on and we're so thankful for that and now we're asking that you would just Elevate us into Heavenly places Lord a rim that no mortal man can come into but Lord your spirit father father we're Eternal we're we're Spirit beings we're your children and youve called us Lord to come into this place Lord not in a carnal real but supernaturally Lord and it's in that place that you can work miracles that you perform the The Impossible and father we're just asking that you would just move among us this evening Lord take what little words that we would have and Lord I pray that you'd plant it deep in our hearts Lord and that when we leave this place we can put it into practice and watch you come on the scene father you alone know every need that is present here Lord and father we're just asking now that you would take over anoint my lips Lord and speak words Through Me Lord to your people and anoint their ears and their hearts to hear and receive we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen and amen we've read this uh actually today uh this morning but Philippians 2 and we're going to read the U um fifth verse says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus say that again let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus then if you'll go with me first Corinthians I believe it is um first corini 2 and4 I think that's the scripture we're looking for praise the Lord uh we'll start at the 14th verse but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ can you say Amen you can have your seats this afternoon and maybe just to continue along the thought of last Sunday that is expressing the mind of Christ and not going to take long but we we we know we we know this uh so it ain't going to be anything I guess new uh but yet it it is um it's um needful because this is what we are as Believers but uh I had read this uh last Wednesday uh last Sunday evening brother brandom said that we were created for the purpose of controlling and and ruling and to praise God and to live for him that is the that's the greatest thing that you could be created for no matter what you do in life whether you're the electrician plumber tow guy um housewife preacher Deacon whatever we may all have our different occupations our different ways of living and all these things but one thing that we all have something in common as sons of God and Daughters of God is that we were created for the purpose of ruling and controlling and to praise God and to live for God right and so that's what I want to talk on is just the common ground of what we have and what we are as as Believers there are several places where brother brandham talks about claiming and um such as he he would say we can claim our possession he's talking about how that the blood has come and Redemption but then he says we can claim our possession we can then he says in another place we can claim what's our own so I I think then we need to find out what's our own and the only way we can find out what's our own is by scriptures right so he says we can claim what's our own and everything he died for we can claim it Lord ain't that right so then he then that must be meaning that we are back in the position of of ruling and controlling right and so this word claim I looked it up it means to call for Amen to ask or seek to obtain by virtue of authority that's pretty good huh not just asking not just wishing but by virtue of authority we can call for it we can ask seek to obtain by virtue of authority by right to challenge as a right to demand as due uh to claim a debt to claim obedience or respect to assert or maintain as a right Lord so to think of that so so if if we if if we have the right to claim everything that is our own on now and everything that Christ died for then you don't just sit there and ask in in the sense of please can I have it that's not that's not being authoritative but you claim by virtue of authority I want it back it's mine I own that give it back give it to me right and we're not looking in the Bible seeking for promises in in hopes that we can have them and which ones are easy for us and which one you you can't judge Promises by by you you you judge Promises by what God said about it and then if you are a Believer then then you can you only judge it by what God has done for you as a Believer by the blood of Jesus Christ that you're washed you've been loosed you're from sin you're no longer a sinner right God can never see you as a sinner again not if you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost ain't that right so so then you're not looking at this as a sinner wishing hoping Desiring one now it's it's now you have the right to claim it the book has been open the lamb has come to redeem and and it's in this age that he's CL he's coming he has come to claim everything that he has redeemed can you say Amen and so then then we have an authority we have a a a a power it's not really power it's Authority and then our Authority comes from the word of God ain't that right amen uh there has to be a basis of our Authority amen uh um I I I can't I can't conduct myself as a president would or pass laws as a president I Ain't Got No Authority but but he can because the government has given him that Authority amen a senator and and and then they they they do things because they have the authority to do it their Authority is they they have a basis of their Authority they have a basis in what they do ain't that right well then then then so is it for a Believer we our our our Authority has basis for this it's a founded upon the word of God there's a reason that we do what we do there's a we have a right to do it and not only do we have a right we have an obligation to do it can you imagine the president not doing squat maybe we already got there I don't know huh you don't have to imagine too far but can you imagine the Believers not doing that amen okay well so anyway uh uh so our power and authority comes from the word of God so then how insulting it is to God when we say we're Believers we're Christians yes we're redeemed we got the Holy Ghost and then we do nothing about it ain't that right so we we find that that in the beginning God put Adam behind the word and as long as he stayed behind it he was a a ruler and could exercise Dominion he was a ruler because he had the bases he his his authority come by the word of God and so God put man behind the word ain't that right and why did he put man behind the word to defeat Satan with he knew Satan was lurking in that Garden he knew he knew amen he created the guy right he he knew what was what was uh the potentials there but he gave man that word amen to hide behind as a a a a fortress and so all man had to do all man had to do is say God said and then leave it at that and walk away God said it God said it God said it ain't that right you see if he's hiding behind something whatever you're hiding behind then that means uh it's in front of you if you're hiding if I'm going to hide behind the pulpit see well then the pulpit is in front of me it's standing in between you and me ain't that right amen see well see then then then the word the word uh uh God put man behind that word well then that means that the word was in front of them and should have been in front of them at all times ain't that right see so the prophet says it like this the word would have been in front of them always and notice how he puts it thus said the the Lord thus sayth the Lord thus sayth the Lord right or left thus sayith the Lord no matter where they turn the word would be right there thus sayith the Lord thus sayth the Lord thus sayith the Lord ain't that right they didn't have to reason with it they didn't have to question it they didn't have to argue with it they didn't have to do nothing they were hid behind the word God said thus sayth the Lord thus say the Lord ain't that right see so after you become a Christian well then you the prophet said you are fortified by the word of God and any promise in the word of God that's what you are fortified by uh when you become a Christian ain't that right you are placed behind the word that is your Fortress a fortress is a stronghold see and so that means you're safe it's a fortress and if God provides the Fortress for you then you automatically know you're safe ain't that right you're safe from the enemy I don't and and the greatest enemy is the devil well practically it's the only enemy ain't that right see you're safe so the prophet says every promise in that that's is yours can you say that every promise in the Bible is mine every promise in the Bible is mine now he put them promises before you and shielded you from the devil you are hid behind every promise in this Bible can you say amen that's your Fortress see and he says the only thing you have to do is just reach and get it and go right on with it man wants to argue with it man wants to reason with it but God never intended for you to reason with it God never intended for you to argue with it God never intended for you to question it God intended for you to stay behind that word get it and just go on for it can you say amen and he says well you you know uh uh you ask well how how you know it's going to work I don't know how it's going to work see explain to me I don't know the only thing I know is that God gave his children the best attack that they could have and the best thing to attack with cuz he knows the working of the enemy can you say amen amen I'm telling you you're safe behind the word of God we're safe we're safe you don't have to do nothing just believe it can you say Amen see so that is your attack against the enemy every time he comes and we all know his attacks you know and and the prophet said the best way well the only way to overcome is to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks and but he's got the tricks but we're not stupid people amen we've been given a word we've been given a message ain't that right and the word tells us every one of his tricks amen the greatest battle ever fought you ought to go listen to it amen and how the devil fights in our minds he puts the thoughts in our mind amen he tries to uh uh put questions in our mind he gets us to reason amen but you don't have to listen to it recognize the devil in every one of his tricks amen and he's more than he's he's just a bluff he he's only a bluff he's already been whipped he's a liar can you say Amen so every negative thought that he puts in your mind it's a lie from the pits of hell you've got the truth the word of God is the truth the word of God is sure the word of God Amen will come to pass you've got a greater weapon than he does truth overcomes lies now God God knew he gave you the greatest thing to attack the devil with and to be fortified with and he knew that education would not be sufficient right he knew that religion would not be enough he knew that even gifts Amen in the church wouldn't be enough why because Satan is educated Satan can be just as religious Satan can impersonate any gift that God's got can you say amen that's right the only thing he cannot do is stay with that word word by word amen that's how you can go to toll with him is based upon the word of God don't you try amen to get on his ground and defeat him by your gifts don't try to do it by dreams don't try to defeat him by Vision don't try to uh uh defeat him by your prophecies prophecies come prophecies go can you say amen amen things can come things can go amen the only thing that we can defeat him with is by the word of God that's right now why why did God give his word to be our Fortress well the prophet said the reason why is God's word is eternal can you say that with me God's word is eternal God's word is eternal amen Satan can defeat you on any other ground but the word of God do you believe that amen that's why God did not send us amen an educated man a the Theologian he he did not send us psychologist he did not send us amen someone that just could prophesy and speak in tongues and and all that stuff he sent us a prophet so he can restore the word back to us so we could defeat the devil on any ground any situation under any circumstance can you say amen he sent us a prophet Amen in this age amen and not just a prophet the seventh angel ain't that right yes yes sir amen why to to reveal all the Mysteries Amen to take every mystery in this book and reveal it take the the things that were hid in the mind of God and reveal it to us there is no way that this Bride Can fail there is no way that this bride is going to be defeated there is absolutely no way that this bride is going to come up short she's got the word it's already been restored to her she will overcome am that's the truth Satan can defeat you on any other grounds but how can he defeat you when the word itself stands between you and him he can't he cannot change one syllable of the word of God can you say amen he can't he where God puts the period Satan can't change that where God puts the comma Satan can't change that where God puts a conjunction Satan can't change that whatever God says Satan cannot change oh he's tried to change it he's tried to misunderstand or misinterpret it to us Amen to where we can't recognize the word of God but then he sent a prophet that would catch the original mind of God the thoughts of God and bring it right back into Focus can you sayen he put everything exactly the way it should be to where all you had to do is just simply believe amen that's right if God said it it will happen ain't that right it'll happen just the way he intended it to happen now brother Braham said if God made a promise that is eternal and there's nothing nowhere can stop it can you say that with me there's nothing that can stop it no devil can stop it no sickness can stop it no mind battles can stop it no matter where Satan comes to you at he cannot stop it God said it it's going to happen can you say Amen see so he says you can turn turn every atom upside down turn it backwards and can never pierce the word of God one little word can't see cuz Jesus said both heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail that's the best weapon there is it's the word of the Eternal God do you believe that see now what is the word of God the word of God is God himself so God gave the believer himself amen he said it's God himself he gave the believer himself to attack the Enemy by and other words he's the father and the word is God then the word is our father we were born by the word and he's standing in the Forefront for his children Lord can you say Amen see there you are he's standing out there in front for his children just think of it you're just old Flesh and Bones and Satan thinks you're just a a uh well if I can say it panty waste just some little old Wimp And in in reality you are but then God stands in front of you and now when Satan attacks you he's attacking God himself the Eternal God that can never be dethroned whatever God says is going to happen he says my word will not return unto me void can you say Amen but it shall accomplish that which I sent it to do ain't that right see so then he asked the question see what are we scared scared about you realize how many times he's asked that question what are you scared about why do you have fear this message should take away every fear that we've got the Lord fear is not of God fears of the devil you understand that when you're scared that you're going to miss miss it it missed the Rapture you realize that's the devil putting that stuff in your mind amen when you're scared of of that you're not going to get healed and the doctor's right and and and he gives you the death sentence and and fear just grips you that is of the devil for the Bible says the Spirit uh God has not given us the spirit of fear but of Love of and of a sound mind and of of of Peace can you say Amen see so we're born by the word he's standing in the Forefront for his children there you are he's standing out there for his for his children what are we scared about the Rapture is sure everybody say the Rapture is sure say this the coming is sure every blessing that's been promised is ours that's what he said every blessing that has been promised is ours all everybody say all no don't start dissecting it he said all belongs to us that's what God put before you he put that before you Hallelujah that's what he hid be he hid you behind amen right what is Satan's weapon against you how manyan how many knows what Satan's weapon against you is Prophet says it to get you dis to disbelieve your weapon so God gives you the God God fortifies you with his word right every promise all promises belong to you and that's what he fortifies you with he also gives you a weapon and that's every promise in the book the word of God is your weapon ain't that right so now what Satan's job is is to stand back and start whispering to you oh you're just making this up you're crazy right and then he starts remind oh you prayed how long have you been praying now oh well I've been praying for 20 years and is your children getting any better well no oh see it's just it's it's just you you're just working things all in your head can you say man what's he doing he's gradually taking your weapon away he's gradually taking your fortification what's he doing he's actually drawing you out amen away from your Fortress amen and getting you to lay your weapon down and then when you lay your weapon down he's got you notice what a prophet says see he's there to get you to disbelieve your weapon listen if he can get you to disbelieve your weapon is uh uh equivalent if he can get you to believe that your weapon is not strong enough he has disarmed you come on Church don't come to church disarmed don't go to work disarmed don't wake up in the morning disarmed don't try to raise a family [Music] disarmed can you say man don't try be a Christian disarmed yes sir don't put out testimonies disarmed cuz Satan's going to challenge you on every ground that you come to you can't be disarmed he'll meet you on everywhere every turn can you say Amen see look he's disarmed you when he get you to disbelieve that weapon and when you lay that down that finishes your fight you're done that's right that's what he says see when you lay your weapon what is your weapon word the word every promise of God how do I lay it down because I just let the dust fly amen over it no you've laid it down long before that amen what then how do I lay it down when you start disbelieving the word of God when you start reasoning the word of God yeah you're right I mean I know it's happening to everybody else but maybe God just ain't ain't want me maybe this is my lot of life is just to go through all of this that I I go through maybe Victory ain't really mine and maybe I'll just always have these habits well that is my makeup amen all you're doing is listen to a bunch of garbage that the devil is feeding you amen but God can only give you what one other one thing that he can give you is his word and it's not that he's going to give you his word he has given you his word he's already given you his word amen yes sir why would we argue with the word so you understand why Satan attacks the message attacks the prophet trying to get you to doubt the messenger can you say amen that's right so he said see when you lay that down that finishes your fight you're done hold that weapon amen and don't you lay it down he says can you say man why you have no other defense you have no other defense you can leave the mees walk away from it you ain't got no defense you can join Pentecostals and dance to you just want to dance I mean dance your shoes off all you I care but you ain't got no defense speak in tongues all you want to you ain't got no defense can you say man look at all the prophecies and tongues and and shouting and all that you ain't got no defense or you can sit there as former as some old Baptist but you ain't got no defense amen we argue on all kinds of things and all kinds of points amen the problem is to stay with the word just keep the word it'll bring you Revival it'll bring you through can you say amen that's the only defense that you have against the enemy right come on now you believe it amen now he said to the serpent God said see this thing didn't just happen all at once I think it happened gradually I do too I think Satan just so Sly Bible says the serpent was crafty he's a little slick guy so just come hey Eve H hi beautiful day today what you been up to oh nothing just thinking about the word really yeah that's nice really nice yeah what does the word say oh God says we can't eat of any other tree but just this one tree oh really well that was nice that's really nice boy you could have all that dinner you can have all this other stuff too you know I mean but oh I mean I was just joking I was just joking yeah no no we can't God said so yeah I know see you later Eve that's right then walks away you know maybe comes up and grabs another you know something that's appetizing you know hey look and he starts winning her influence yes sir so starts winning her her friendship starts just talking slowly yeah the Lord is good isn't he yeah he is he's really good yeah I bet he is yeah you have good service last night oh yeah we met under the stars and oh it's just so nice just beautiful oh good where's that ad a man um ah he's he you know you know what husbands you know I don't and he just begin to talk and just talk a little bit at a time and but he's sewing things in her mind all along just a little negative you really think God really meant that yeah I I really do oh I mean you know come on Eve God is good BR says I hear that all the time getting tired of hearing it that's [Music] right God's a good God he is a good God but he's a god of judgment right but what was he doing he was breaking down her defense slowly breaking it down so subtle right and then he threw the punch now the the thing was brother Brown said he wanted fairly because she was lusting after knowledge she was in her heart looking for something else now Church brother Brown said he how how did he put that sufficiently satisfied we've need to be sufficiently I think that's how you put it sufficiently satisfied I wonder if we are sufficiently satisfied with the word can you say man how many sufficiently satisfied we don't need another Messenger to come I I'm just it it blows my mind how when when a man rises up as a prophet or some little gift people just they're not sufficiently satisfied with what God has Vindicated to be right can you say Amen it's like they need something else or you got these you know the the these guys that are anointed of the same devil that talk to Eve where where they well brother BR was a prophet oh yes he was a prophet he was so anointed but not everything he said was of God and and now you have to check with what he said in the words you know and and and then there it go they go on the Spiel and and this and that and they got your mind so good just so uh uh uh uh uh messed up and all that I say stay away from all that nonsense can you say amen that's why I hit it so hard when they when they say brother Brandon miss it I don't want to hear another word they said they ain't going to get behind this Pulpit I ain't going to turn the I ain't going to let my ears be garbage can because that's all they're doing is spewing out garbage this word I was to hide behind and you say Amen see you have no other defense see so Eve gradually she said it God said God said God said but somehow Satan was finally able to get her to stop and to listen and not question it can you say Amen see but she shouldn't have stopped She that that's the problem she shouldn't have stopped but it was appealing to her brother Brandon preached on the on the message enticing Spirits enticing Spirits Church you know why because Satan always appeals to our flesh and our emotions he appeals the things that appeals to us right yes sir if any of you are a good fisherman you ain't going to go out there and hook a rock to your fishing pole at the end of your line somehow tie it in there and woohoo right you ain't going to get a big old T-Bone St I don't know if fish eat that or not I don't think so you ain't going to get a big old T-Bone stank and hook it up you know just to catch a little perk you'll catch brother will but you're going to use things that is attractive right right that's the only way to communicate you can't go here a little fishy he don't understand that language so you got to do something to catch him and sat knows how to catch hello he's doing it all around that's right he's catching preachers he's catching the deacons he's catching the the the the the the musicians he's catching the leoty he's catching them all the time hello amen see because he knows what is appealing on now can you say amen and he always appeals to our flesh and our emotions see so she began to reason with what Satan was saying to her and she become disarmed right that's right and Satan was able to punch a hole the prophet said through Eve's mind see and and what did that do it brought death to the whole human race it'll bring death to the family it'll bring death to the church it'll bring Death to Your Soul it'll bring death to everything it'll stop the of God it'll stop the the Revival flowing it'll stop the joy the peace everything about Christianity should be something that is living constantly flowing can you say amen and Satan is wanting to cut the lifeline off from us you say Amen well then what happens fear grip man sin and perversion grip man man becomes subject to all kinds of disease dises sickness sin habits corruption complexes ain't that right why because he finally disarmed her and be a was able to punch a hole amen through her mind amen by her reasoning and all that but then he tried to do that with Jesus and he couldn't do it every time he turned around and he quoted scriptures he used the scripture just like he did with Eve but Jesus wouldn't allow him to talk Jesus wouldn't listen to what he was saying Jesus wouldn't give him an a timer day but he would he would repeat scripture back but it is written one thing about Jesus he knew how to place the promises can you say amen he knew how to place them promises he knew amen what to do oh yes sir Jesus kept saying it is written it is written it is written and we're so glad that he was a able to do that I'm I'm glad that he was able to do that aren't you glad that he was able to do that amen you know why he done that Amen to show the prophet that he had power upon power upon power but he not used the one power to defeat the Devil with he used the word to show that the weakest Christian can defeat Satan anytime anywhere under any situation the word is that powerful and it's put into your hands it's put into your hands it's put into your hands you well I don't know how to pray eloquent words you don't have to pray eloquent words the word is good enough just speak the word yes Hallelujah so Jesus wasn't the only one he didn't want to be the only one defeating the devil so he does this he uses the word to show that anyone can do it any any believer the weakest of Believers can you say Amen but then he died to bring us back to our rightful place prise the Lord can you say amen I I hope you understand that everything that God has been trying to do is for you bring it send in the prophet I mean well first of all send in his son dying on the cross it was not just normal blood it was not human blood it was the blood of God that saved you it was not a national nationality blood a Jew or Gentile it was God God can you say Amen that was the only blood that could loose you that was the only blood amen by that blood he could declare you Innocent by that blood he could declare you justified by that blood he can secure you amen till the day amen of your Redemption ain't that right by that blood that's right then he can bring that his Spirit down inside of you amen yes sir now I I know I know know you know these things and I pray it's a help to you but I I tell you what let's not act like Sinners that's right let let's not have the mentality of Sinners let's not have this mentality that God's forsaken us you say but I feel forsaken then don't carry that mentality come on Church feelings are going to come and go sensation going to come and go trials going to come and go go seasons in your life is going to come and go Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will never pass that's right amen he died to bring us back to our rightful place place of Fellowship a place of authority yes sir a place of control to where we control and you say Amen a place of of to where that we can stand without condemnation amen there's no sense in us being condemned there's no sense in us coming to church under condemnation well you say well how do I do that get under the blood confess your sins when your sins are confessed there's no condemnation amen can you say Amen well it's truth that's right and you confess your sins that that is the biggest thing that that's the greatest power that breaks the devil's back and authority over your life is when you confess your sins it's true come on a lot of Christians are bound because they refuse to confess their sins and it can be the simplest things brother BR said we should repent every day every day uh to God if you've done your brother wrong and your heart's con condemning you get it right make it right why why it frees you it sets you free from it can you say Amen why because you want to come back to your rightful place the Lord of control of authority amen yes you can't rightfully claim the word your promises if your heart's condemning you brother BR said if your heart's condemning you you know what it does it puts you right back in the place of a sinner well what do you mean by that am I a sinner or am I a saint no you can be a saint but but you're weak you're powerless if you're holding on to sin unconfessed sins and your heart is condemning you you ain't got any power no matter what promises are there you're just like the sinner that just ain't you're out of relationship because your heart condemns you but the moment you put that under the blood Hallelujah can you say Amen put it under the blood yes sir is that what I think brother brandom even encouraged the people if you're in line and you got sin something just step out of the line for a minute confess it there you are you don't have to be a Catholic beat yourself up you don't have to do all these you know these whatever penances and all these things just confess it and what is it it's over right then it's over then you're right back in line again you're back into Fellowship again it's so easy right right wonderful so now we we find that Jesus wasn't just placed behind the word but he was the the word Lord amen see and so he he tried uh uh uh to get Jesus but then Jesus defeated the devil on every turn defeated the Devil by the word of God then he come and he redeemed us redeemed us can you say Amen our soul that he could live in us and have the preeminence in US amen come on now I thank God for that right amen that God would literally take preeminence now that's a blessing when God has preeminence over you cuz either God will have preeminence or the devil will amen yes sir and I don't know about you but I've just been tired of being a slave to the devil he you right they say you know how they said that he he'll get you to you know rob the bank then he'll call the law on you he's all the time getting you do something then he get you caught he's sitting there that was funny you're the one that's all scarred and life's all broken up all these ain't that right but when God come to have preeminence in you that means Satan cannot touch you Satan has no dominion over you anymore can you say Amen so then then He restored the word to us Amen in this last day now Satan Satan could get to Eve but he wasn't able to get to Adam ain't that right he couldn't touch Adam so he went around to Eve why because Eve was a byproduct of Adam that's what she was she's just a byproduct right she was taken from that which had been created and she was the one who doubted the word of God she was the one that started question she she was the one who was deceived ain't that right yes sir see but we as the bride of Christ are not a byproduct of Adam Lord we are a byproduct of christes ain't that right yes sir and what is Christ he's the word so the prophet said then if he was the word what must the bride be it's got to be the original word Living God God in the word so what are you you are a product of the original everybody say the original the original word that means it goes all the way back way before creation into the mind of God when God thought of you Jesus being the word he was the thought of God he was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world in God's mind he was predestinated to be the lamb in God's mind he was predestinated to be what he was in God's mind and now he becomes the word every Prophet amen spoke of him can you say Amen now here we are a word bride not a denominational bride a word bride amen a word bride now that's not a phrase that is a reality it's not just a phrase to to get us pumped up it's a reality we can literally be identified as the word bride you believe that and the church does not make you bride of Christ denominations can't make you bride of Christ amen the word makes you can you say that with me the word makes me bride of Christ the word word makes me bride of Christ I am part of the word I came from the word I am the word yes sir then my origin comes from the word and what is the word a thought expressed ain't that right so now the Bible tells us that the word came to the prophets second Peter 1:21 for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost so they didn't come up with words and it wasn't of their imagination and then they just speak it or write it down and and and then we got just a whole bunch of man is the one that makes this a mess man makes it a mess their own ideas their own interpretation but God never made a mess out of it it comes from him God would never trust man to write something uh and then put make us put our uh uh whole life upon it come on God would make it happen God would come to them God would move upon men and when they spoke it would be thus sayth the Lord because it wasn't man speaking it was God speaking ain't that right see the word came to them now notice what the prophet says the prophet writer must be in constant fellowship with the author he must live constantly in the presence of of the author to know what the book is going to be the prophet writer he had the pen ready anytime constant fellowship with the author which God which was God to strike down whatever he said put down showed what kind of a life he a separated life from all of his Brethren a prophet was and now that's why the prophet had his mind set his mind set constantly on what God Said not what man thought not what the age thought not what the church thought thought or what the kingdom thought but what God thought he only expressed God's thoughts to word because a word is a thought when it's expressed he said you got it now the word is a thought expressed so the prophet was waiting for God's thoughts and when God revealed his thoughts to him he expressed it in word see thus sayi the Lord see not thus sayith I the prophet but thus sayith the Lord that's why they defi Kings kingdoms and church ages see which to do so in their days was a death penalty you walk up in the face of King and tell him thus said the Lord such and such is going to happen You' have your head chopped off see the church would put you to death right now for doing it see but these prophets were bold why they were moved by the Holy Ghost see and they see that's why they become bold they wrote the infallible word of God didn't put their own interpretation to it their own thoughts to it or my own thoughts your own thoughts they just Express God's thoughts ain't that right caught God's thoughts and expressed it into word wrote it down in in word form amen you know why this this Bible speaks of you because it's nothing but God's thoughts this Bible speaks of you that's why you can identify with it not you're treated as a western book not treated a a as a mystery book not not treat as any other book you can literally identify with this book am the think of it now even young boys I I did it and I watched my all my boys do it read them a book read them a western book or they'll see something me whether it's Western whether it's Roman soldiers whether it's whatever it is they'll get right back they'll get right up and and you know they'll go get their guns and go out you know in the in the closet and in the toy box finding that cowboy hat they want to find them boots right sometimes we'll have great services and you know he doesn't do it now a lot but but Levi as soon as church was over he'd go you know and grab his Bible get a glass of water get him a little pulpit and start preaching want Ruth to sing only believe or something to call him out why something inspired him I'm sure all of us has done it in some way in some time you seen you know Superman read copics of Superman or something you know before you know what I got Mom's towel of the bathroom mom can can you put this over my neck you know and she get the safety pit ow don't don't that hurt mom you know found out really wasn't much Superman but anyway you know and then I get on the chair get on the bed you know Superman what was it I was trying to be something I got inspired hear about Taren read about tarzen looking for me a rope couldn't find a rope so just well anyways oh running through the Jungle which was the living room why you get inspired want to be identified with something the church you can be identified something that seems so impossible but God has allowed you to be identified because it isn't a storytale this isn't a fairy tale this this is actually reality God wrote about you he said this is what you're going to be he already prophesied he already saw you being that way and there's something within us that wants to be that [Applause] way amen that's the truth amen and you never have to come back you know in the time of playing Cowboys and Indians was over we just put our guns up for next time time of playing Superman was over we just put everything up for the next time we moved on you ain't moving on from this this was God's thoughts concerning you as The Virtuous sinless bride of Christ can you say Amen there is going to be a millennium there is going to be a body change and you're coming to that it's going to happen and you'll never take on a VI body again you'll never amen have another mind battle you'll never amen have another Temptation another failure and making all the mistakes you'll never have that because this is what God thought of you and this is what you're becoming this ain't pretending amen this is real can you say Amen notice before there was ever a speck of Stardust before God was God God is an object of adoration and no one was there to worship him so he was at that time only potentially God and he was known only as eternal spirit notice the bride everybody say the bride bride can you say it that's me that's me the bride was already in his mind yes she was she was existing in his thoughts and what about not those thoughts of God they are Eternal are they not the Eternal thoughts of God let me ask you are the thoughts of God Eternal if you can see this you will see many things you will see that you can never be defeated you'll see that you can never be a sinner again you'll see that Satan can never take you out you'll see many things if you can see that God's thoughts are eternal God that's right yes sir God is unchangeable in both Essence and behavior we have studied that and proven that already God is infinite in his ability so therefore he as God must be omniscient if he is omniscient then he is not now learning nor is he taking counsel even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge if he can add to his knowledge then he is not omniscient the best we could say is that sometime he will be but that is not scriptural he is omniscient can you say Amen so that mean he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he is God thus the thoughts of God are Eternal and they are real they are not simply like a man with a blueprint that is drawn up which one day will be translated into substance and form you've got the blueprint you've got a house drawed up right there and then one day it will be manifested no that's not the way God's thoughts are see he says but they are already everybody say they are already they are already real and eternal and part of God to God you already are there that's the thoughts of God you will not one day be saved you already were saved you will know what you will not one day one day overcome you have already overcome you will not just one day amen arrive you've already arrived can you say Amen see you've already got a body that's waiting for you brother Bron said I saw you there if you really catch the mind of God and you have that mind of Christ you're only seeing yourself in Victory you see yourself there no wonder we can praise God no wonder we can Triumph amen and get shouts and joy in the middle of all the the things we go through because we see it's already done Eternal thoughts expressed into eternal words therefore there comes an eternal manifestation of the original thoughts now brother brandom he says this now the Hebrew prophets the two major thingses and practically from somewhere along in every chapter of the Bible from Genesis to Malachi you can find one of those subjects being dealt with all the way through the Bible the coming of the Messiah Christ Jesus and the anointing and sending forth of the church into all the world it's spoke of in symbols by animals and so forth and like great armies and so forth that Marches On runs over the walls and so forth of different uh like locusts and everything was in symbols and Parables and straight teachings and everything it comes down to those two subjects the Messiah and you Jesus Christ and his bride amen God's thoughts God's thoughts ain't complicated right God already had Jesus in his mind now how many believe Jesus come you believe he come you believe he was the lamb you believe he was a redeemer amen so God's thoughts he he manifested God's thoughts can you say man it was so sure no devil of Hell could stop it ain't that right Lions couldn't eat it fire couldn't stop it nothing nothing devil seed serpent seed come through all the lineage amen and all the generation could not stop him from coming he came exactly the way God said it because he was predestinated now it's your turn you're here by the grace of God there's been no demon been able to stop it there's been no trouble been able to stop it look at all your forefathers and your family tree and all the troubles and all the the things that could have happened and God wouldn't let it happen because you had to come and here you are today we ought to take hold amen so they wrote of you they wrote of you now notice and get ready close now brother Braham said this Bible is God's thoughts and Seed form that if received everybody say received if received into the human being and spoke spoke by the same thought that materialize the Bible it'll bring it to [Music] pass ain't that right now think of that every thought is God's word and Seed form that if this word could be received into your heart and spoke by the same thought not your thought right not my thought not Church thought not World thought I don't care what thoughts no thought same thought yeah that wrote this Bible amen and we know it was the thought of God and it would be spoken it'll bring the thing to pass the Lord so then you must receive it we can preach about promises we can preach about it all year long and a thousand lifetimes you have to receive it amen and you have to speak it that's right Lord right receive it by inspiration which is the spirit of God and speak it by the same inspiration that the prophets had ain't that right see the spirit of God Came Upon them and caused them to speak and to write that same Spirit now comes upon you that's right right Lord the spirit of the Prophet is subject to the prophet right now we use that when a preacher is up here preaching and and and someone wanting to stand up and prophesy that Spirit you you understand what I'm saying but I we're going to take it I believe that if you have the Holy Ghost if I have the Holy Ghost if we have the Holy Ghost the spirit within us becomes subject to what this word says come on can you say Amen it'll testify what this word says the Bible says it'll lead and guide you into all truth so it ain't sitting there just up a prophet and he's speaking the thoughts of God thus say the Lord thus say the Lord thus say the Lord and then we have the Holy Ghost oh I don't know if we can make it I don't know I I just don't see Victory I I I don't know I just sometimes wonder if I'm ever going to ever going to come to and you got the Holy Ghost you understand what I'm saying this word says you've already overcome amen ain't that right and are we not required to bring every thought under subjection to the word of God well how are you going to do that not with your carnal mind not with how you feel and your your own self you'll do it by the very spirit that caus them to write they wrote it not even knowing what they wrote not understanding the things they wrote that it was the spirit of God in them now it's the spirit of God taking over your body call cusing you to speak things that you normally wouldn't do it causing you to believe in things that you normally wouldn't do it it's impossible for a man to to believe in things that is beyond him that we do anyways because we're looking to a word amen that's right that's good hallelujah amen true so the spirit that was upon the prophets now is in US causing us to receive the word and speaking it Romans 8:9 If any man have not the spirit of Christ he has none of his so you see we have to come under subjection to the spirit of Christ we began to take on his mind we began to think his thoughts I hope you understanding yeah God help us all got this old preacher right yeah got to get away from that negative thinking now I'm not talking about man you doing it in yourself no no no you can't go to enough positive classes to begin thinking positive got to come under control of the Holy Spirit where he takes over your mind and you begin to think God's thoughts you begin to speak God's words it's something that's totally Beyond you all you're doing is just believing it you're accepting it you're you're you're just taking it in for yourself right the Lord can you say Amen see so brother brandom he he he says now see there it is he is spirit and he is life that is exactly what the word is that's exactly what Jesus is he is the word notice now this is a prophet speaking to us so when a spirit born spirit filled man in faith word does you no good without faith right but when a Spirit-filled man a spirit born man in faith takes that word into his heart and places it up on his lips why that is the same as deity speaking Every Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man cannot stand before that woman cannot be stand before that child because now he's placed the word on his lips and it's as deity speaking as the prophet said deity is not in heaven it's in you it's in you anointing your mind anointing your heart taking the very words that he spoke through the prophets now he's in you receiving them and you by faith receiving it now you're placing it upon on your lips right God said so God said so Hallelujah God said so amen amen that's right it's easy talk about Abraham and Sarah 25 long years he confessed it and it's easy to to to look at their stories say yeah they're are heroes but you realize they were only testifying of you to come they were the type here you are are am now it's your turn to speak it it's your turn to endure it's your turn to embrace the promises and claim them that's right amen can you say amen amen and as Abraham did not waver so must we not waver because he was only the shadow you are the substance the Lord is good to us is he not so we read this last Sunday I'll read it again your thoughts if they become expression if your thoughts if they become expression like God said let there be a world and and if you want to go listen to that tape it's it's actually a uh pretty short and and he's just talking he just come back from India but it's called India the the India report something to that effect the India report word made manifest or word made flesh but but you ought to go listen to it and he's just talking he's just taking his little time and he just a little short he's talking just gave about the India trip and all that now he's going to go into this and you're just like wow powerful amen he said see before God said let there be a world before it could be a word it had to be a thought so God in the creation created the world Red by his thought first then spoke it and the thought expressed became material see what I mean now if that same spirit that said let there be light and there was light said let there be trees and there was trees if that same mind that was in Christ be in you how much could it say let there be no cancer and it would be gone let the blind eyes be open and it would be so see it's your thought you said well that was Jesus but wait a minute he said have faith in God which we know have the faith of God Amen for verily verily I say to you if you shall say to this mountain be moved plucked up and cast into the sea and don't doubt in your heart but believe what what you say will come to pass you'll have whatsoever things I'll says is that right you shall have it not me you shall have it what power has been given to the church now you can express it by mental conception but if it becomes a real revelation of God that you see it before it happened and express it in word form that word takes a hold and becomes material a thought expressed see Oh my he said if your heart and your mind is so and in filled with the God's spirit until your thoughts become his thoughts when your mind and your leading and your guiding becomes a direct place or a direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's moving your mortal being what kind of people should we be if the very Holy Spirit has you so embodied or empowered that you don't use your own thoughts you don't use your own mind you don't use your own opinion but the Holy Spirit has you so built until your thoughts and your being is God's spirit expressing itself through you what kind of a church we would be so then what do we want we want God's spirit to express himself in US yes don't be afraid of the spirit of God Amen don't be afraid of the moving of God make yourself available for God so he says what kind of a Church would it be what kind of a people would it be this morning if this briam Tabernacle this morning was so filled with the presence of God why when you didn't even use your own mind didn't use your own thoughts didn't even have no alternative of your own but just to be led by the spirit and they that are the sons of God are led by the spirit of God then when the human element goes out and the spirit of God FS that vacancy where you ENT yourself then will be when the church in its power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus will walk in his steps in his power in his thoughts in his being in his moving you see what I mean then your thoughts will become words and words will become material that's the church when the church in its power he said I believe it's on its road that when the church will be so wrapped up in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind so away from theirselves that they don't see themselves they don't have no thoughts but to serve God their thoughts move on they refuse the things of the world they just move in the spirit live in the spirit move in the spirit walk in the spirit so fulfill the law of Christ in the love of Christ in the human heart moving in the Holy Ghost that great wonderful church will go forth with power and deity because deity everybody say deity will be revealed in human beings God doesn't want to just lay there hidden in you he wants to be revealed through you by the Holy Spirit bringing to pass the thought of their mind the Lord oh do you love him amen he said see our thoughts run different a lot of times we walk up and say how do you do brother and and you don't mean it in your heart a lot of times we say well I'm this and that I will do that you don't mean it in your heart see I I I don't mean it in my heart he says but when you can become so dead to the things of the world that Christ is first Christ is all then your entire makeup is of the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ he has full control that's when your thoughts will be clean your thoughts will be pure don't read things that are ungodly amen don't watch things that are ungodly don't listen to things that are ungodly keep our minds out of the gutter can you say amen amen and can I say it this way keep our minds away from carnal keep your mind focused upon the Lord amen I know we got to live I know we got to function we got all that but keep your mind before the Lord with in the Lord even even the s promise said I keep I what I set the Lord before me always always amen no matter what you do where you go what you look at set the Lord before you always can you say amen amen sometimes we get so involved in carnal things yes sir and and and I'm going to look at myself I'll just say it myself I I love to read I'm a big reader I can read book after book after book right and sometimes if I'm not careful I have dwelt on all of that that I have read amen and I've laid aside the important things of life amen we can get so busy to that we don't pray we can get so busy that we just forget about God we can get so wrapped up in our problem so wrapped up in situations so wrapped up in life that we literally forget God's promises can you say amen amen many people say well religion comes from your heart there's no mental uh uh faculties in that little being called heart you can't think with your heart the Bible says as a man thinketh in his heart so is he you can't think with your heart you can't he said because there's nothing mentally in there to think with he said but Jesus wasn't speaking of the physical being he was speaking of the supernatural being thank you Lord well do you love the Lord if the musicians will come we talked about last Sunday about us being channels and and for the word to flow through and and channel means a passage a place of passing or flowing that through which anything passes means a passing conveying transmitting God has called us to be channels for his word to flow through Mary for example was a channel for the word to be born when the angel told her well first of all before the angel of the Lord ever came to her brother brandom gives us a little insight that something quickened to her about Behold a virgin shall conceive it might have been the their their priest talking about it could have been something that just caught it but something caught and she was meditating on it meditating she had things to do but she kept meditating upon that and while she was meditating brother Brown said if you want Christ to show up meditate on [Music] him so when the angel came to her and began to tell her that she was the virgin and that the Holy Ghost would overshadow her and all that notice how she was as the channel behold the handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word brother Ram said she never questioned it she never said well wait a minute that's a little bit too hard for me to understand she she knew she knew that this was a supernatural thing that was going on she knew it was the Lord telling her can you say amen and the prophet said see she believed something that had never happened before so she can never go back to scriptures and say oh that's right because this happened to so and so and this happened to so and so and this happened to so and so no she was believing something that had never happened before can you say amen amen and notice what the prophet said she didn't wait she didn't wait until she started seeing positive signs before she went out and start testifying of it she was a channel the word had come to her now what the angel was saying was a scriptural thing right because the angel of the Lord there's all kinds of angels Kenneth Kenneth Hagen saw an angel and I don't doubt it he says an angel came to him I give him the benefit of the doubt but when the angel of the Lord comes it'll always take you right back to the word can you say Amen everything don't just go around believe in everything that people say it'll always come right back to the to the word of God that's why anything this Prophet said it came right back to the word of God so here's an Angel and the word that has already been in her heart in her mind she's meditating on this word the angel now has come to confirm you're that one amen that virgin now see it opened it up to her she was the [Music] Virgin cannot the Lord do that to us tonight she actually accepted the thoughts of God that was written down in word form seed form accepted it for her and said be it unto me according to Thy word then what does she do she starts testifying of it before it ever happened before any positive sign she starts going around bearing that reproach can you say Amen she testified of it because she knew it was going to happen she wasn't believing in something radical now the prophet said the mind of Christ leads us in the word but I like what this says brother brandham in talking of Mary says soon after she goes to another city where her cousin was [Music] Elizabeth and to enjoy the fellowship and he said because God had overshadowed both of [Music] them so she's going to someone that had the same Supernatural thing not not that she conceived the way Mary did but Elizabeth couldn't have a child right thought of brother Shan and sister Bethany for 20 years or so something God's done something well Elizabeth and Zacharias was the same way they were actually old people that the angel told Mary says Something's Happened to Elizabeth she's going to have a child and Mary went to Elizabeth to have Fellowship brother BR say she couldn't go to the synagogues cuz they wouldn't have believed it that's right she couldn't go just to anybody cuz they wouldn't believe it so she went to someone that had an experience thank you Lord that could relate and they could have Fellowship can you say Amen [Music] Fellowship I thought that was powerful because he said see she went to somebody that had an experience like she had and she went there to Fellowship so on her way she went to somebody that believed God was still just as great as he ever was and I say this in closing if you want to maintain Victory hang around people that have Victory if you're believing for your healing hang around people that believe in [Music] healing hello if you're facing something that is impossible and you just know that God's going to do it don't hang around people that don't believe in the impossibilities that don't believe that God can do things hang around people that love God hang around people that know that God's still alive and well hang around people that'll Rejoice with you can you say Amen cuz they have experienced the same God you have you love the Lord amen amen what's [Music] song forgetfulness oh what sin what sin that's as far away as East is from the [Music] West what sin what God sin there is gone the very minute you [Music] confess buried in the sea of forgetfulness well it happened so long ago I cried out for Mercy back then I plead the blood of Jesus begging to forgive my sins oh I still can't forget it it just won't go away so I wept again I said Lord wash my sins this is all he' say oh what sin what sin they're gone as the East is from the West [Music] oh what sin what sin they were gone the very minute you confess where are they at they're buried in the sea of God's forgetfulness oh the heaviest thing you'll carry is a load of guilt and shame you were never meant to Bear them so just let them go God help us to let it [Music] go he's slow to anger he's quick to forgive your sins so let him put it under the blood and don't bring them up again cuz he'll say what sin oh what sin they were gone East is from the West oh what sin what sin they were gone the very minute you confess buried in the sea of his forget sing it again oh what sin what sin oh aren't you glad

we get get wrapped up in it too much before you know it we start [Music] thinking like unconverted people not in the sense of wanting to do [Music] wrong but in the sense of like we're trapped or like there ain't no hope or like nothing's going to change like it's always going to be this way we must never think that we must look at God's promises because that's the only way it's going to change is God's promises amen ain't that right and I cannot defeat your Giants I can't speak to your mountains the word must be in you the word must be in you that's for you young people too amen thank upon the
