[0:00] shall follow them they believe
[0:02] he's got to keep that word and because
[0:05] he said it it went through his mouth it
[0:09] got to be fulfilled all scriptures got
[0:12] to be fulfilled
[0:14] so it's a paradox alone to hear Jesus
[0:18] the son of God make such a statement as
[0:21] that
[0:22] the things that I do what you do also
[0:26] now the Bible said Hebrews 13 8 he's the
[0:28] same yesterday today and forever that's
[0:30] a paradox because it has to be done
[0:35] it was an earth will pass away but not
[0:37] one word that I've ever said will ever
[0:38] fail he said it has to be done now
[0:41] friends I believe that he is the same
[0:44] yesterday today and forever I believe
[0:46] he's just as able this afternoon the
[0:48] cause in this building are paradox
[0:51] because that he promised it would happen
[0:55] and how much more has he promised how
[0:57] much more is it leaning in the Bible to
[1:00] this very age that we're living the
[1:03] Ephesians again of the church ages we
[1:07] got seven Church ages and we're promised
[1:09] that the lady will see a church ate
[1:11] there would be another Ephesian
[1:14] it's right and we're here I believe with
[1:17] all my heart that Jesus Christ who made
[1:19] the promise as I said my last message
[1:22] standard where he gets that wall I want
[1:23] to share a few weeks ago every time you
[1:25] move your finger that goes around around
[1:27] the world
[1:28] never will stop every move you make
[1:31] you'll sit at the judgment television
[1:34] proves that it's here the fourth
[1:35] dimension because the television doesn't
[1:37] manufacture that picture it only
[1:39] channels that wave into a tube and you
[1:43] see the picture Connor everything every
[1:45] moving object is happening in the world
[1:47] going round around through here now
[1:48] making a record someday your record is
[1:51] going to be closed and you're going to
[1:52] answer to that record
[1:54] he's trying God
[1:56] let me so be planted let me be so damn
[1:59] to myself and anything around me
[2:02] be conscious of the word of God living
[2:05] among us today
[2:07] let's pray Lord Jesus
[2:12] Thy Art of paradox when God was made
[2:15] flesh
[2:17] I pray heavenly father that you will
[2:19] manifest yourself this afternoon
[2:21] proving to us here today
[2:24] not only proving to who's there's I
[2:26] suppose 90 or more of the people said
[2:29] here believe that every word
[2:31] but that we might
[2:33] see you again
[2:35] and let know that this word that you
[2:37] spoke that's still traveling around and
[2:39] around the world
[2:40] just like a record let us move into that
[2:43] record today Lord let us move in and not
[2:46] hear it just like it was coming secondly
[2:48] from a man's mouth
[2:49] but let that mouth and person and people
[2:52] all sitting here become your word we're
[2:56] ready to die Lord of our own ideas
[2:59] just to see you keep your promise the
[3:02] things that I do shall you do also I
[3:05] pray that you'll Grant this in Jesus
[3:07] name amen
[3:10] just before we call a prayer line
[3:13] let's have a little
[3:15] a lot of ice cream one day
[3:17] with an old doctor friend of mine
[3:20] he said I want to ask you something
[3:22] Billy I said all right
[3:24] said Do You Believe In that's where it
[3:27] got this thought paired off said you
[3:29] believe in a paradox I said sure
[3:31] he said I know you do
[3:33] he said
[3:35] told me about a certain person had been
[3:36] healed and been prayed for that his soul
[3:38] epilepsy drugs to it for years sometimes
[3:41] it had seven or eight seizures a day
[3:44] strong medicines
[3:46] he said they never did come back for no
[3:48] more I see him all the time never had it
[3:50] no more don't taste something just let
[3:52] you know I believe what you're talking
[3:54] about
[3:55] he said during time the depression my
[3:57] son here now it's over the over the
[3:59] store said he was
[4:00] he's waiting on counter young fellow
[4:02] just could study oh they're standing
[4:05] down in line for medicine
[4:06] and said a man come up here and he had
[4:08] his wife's a little woman she was you
[4:10] could look at her and see she was just
[4:12] about to be delivered of any time of a
[4:14] child
[4:15] and said she just couldn't stand that
[4:17] line no more so that he brought his wife
[4:19] into the door just leaned on his
[4:21] shoulder and said
[4:23] my boy went up say can I help you said
[4:25] yes I said here's a prescription from
[4:27] the doctor but said I want to make it
[4:28] clear to you he said uh we haven't got
[4:31] the money yet said we're get it from the
[4:33] county but my wife just can't stand it
[4:35] no longer doctor said she had the
[4:37] medicine right away it's a if you just
[4:39] give her the medicine I'll go right
[4:40] there and stand in the line until I I
[4:42] get the money from the county
[4:44] and the boy said sir I'm sorry said it's
[4:47] against our our rules here to give out
[4:49] the medicine without having the money
[4:51] you know how the times it wasn't them
[4:52] days he said I I feel sorry for
[4:55] everybody can't do it he said I was
[4:56] sitting back here reading a paper and I
[4:58] looked up and said something strangely
[5:00] warmed my heart
[5:01] then I walked up I said wait a minute
[5:03] son wait a minute the man started out
[5:04] the door said well all right son started
[5:07] out the door and said I said just a
[5:08] minute so what was that he said what's
[5:10] this man explained it to him he said let
[5:12] me see the prescription said just wait a
[5:13] minute son I'll get you the medicine
[5:16] mixed up the prescription the doctor had
[5:19] prescribed on his paper
[5:22] and said I went up there and had that
[5:24] mountain he said hand it to him not know
[5:25] where I get it out but I just thought it
[5:27] would said it just felt as she did and
[5:29] said Billy when I put that
[5:32] that medicine in that woman's hand
[5:35] said it was the Lord Jesus
[5:38] so I seen a man standing there
[5:41] and he said I read later on that the
[5:43] scripture said in so much as you have
[5:46] done at the least of the end my little
[5:47] ones you have done it unto me he said
[5:49] Billy what happened to my eyes
[5:52] did I actually see it I said yes sir I
[5:56] believe it I believe that you so
[5:58] fulfilled your duty as a druggist and
[6:01] the emergency needing for that Jesus
[6:03] said what you have done unto these
[6:05] others you have done unto me I believe
[6:08] it and I believe that same thing today
[6:10] right here present with this people that
[6:13] Jesus Christ can manifest himself make
[6:16] himself the word made flesh Among Us
[6:18] this afternoon will you believe it
[6:20] Lord bless you
[6:22] now we're going to call for prayer cards
[6:24] for the people to come and uh we can't
[6:27] get too many because I think now if I
[6:28] look at the watch right I got 25 minutes

[7:41] foreign
[7:45] [Music]
[7:54] attention
[8:01] now Jesus made this promise
[8:04] that a little while and the world won't
[8:06] see me anymore
[8:08] yet ye shall see me
[8:10] you believe that yes
[8:12] the world the world is the order of the
[8:15] world see that he don't think want often
[8:17] passions and things but they won't see
[8:19] me anymore yet you'll see me
[8:21] or he promised I'll be with you even to
[8:25] the end of the world is that right
[8:27] and the Bible said Hebrews 13 8 he's the
[8:30] same yesterday to him forever you
[8:31] believe that that's a promise
[8:34] now you don't have to be up here to be
[8:37] healed only thing you have to do is
[8:38] believe that word to be the truth
[8:40] now I'm going to ask you if you will
[8:42] just to be Reverend and quiet for a few
[8:45] moments did all of them come in Billy
[8:46] got two out three out
[8:49] I'd say
[8:50] three more
[8:52] number three prayer card number three
[8:55] what how what's the Mexican word for
[8:57] that three
[8:59] anybody can say it
[9:01] art surely they heard it what that
[9:04] everybody's got that prayer card uh to
[9:06] come into the line with you
[9:12] or if I think it was somebody had it and
[9:14] didn't know it and moved back all right
[9:16] now
[9:17] now how about as everybody believe now
[9:19] with all your with all your heart well
[9:21] let's pray again and Lord Jesus now
[9:24] we realized that we can read the word
[9:26] with our best of our knowledge explain
[9:29] it but Lord You're the only one can
[9:31] confirm it you're the only one can say
[9:34] that it's right or wrong
[9:36] father I pray today that you'll let the
[9:39] eyes of the people be open may we see a
[9:42] paradox this afternoon just Lord enough
[9:45] to let the people see that you're
[9:47] present that you are not
[9:49] out of existence at your word
[9:52] same yesterday day and forever for you
[9:55] are that word
[9:56] for the sake of the sick Lord for the
[9:59] sake of those who are suffering
[10:01] many probably are here from different
[10:03] parts of the country but parts of the
[10:04] nation
[10:06] Amos
[10:07] they're suffering so they couldn't enjoy
[10:09] them the meetings otherwise if there
[10:12] wasn't healed I pray that you'll heal
[10:14] granted Lord
[10:16] and now we're only physical human beings
[10:19] and can only preach the word and say
[10:21] what you said to be the truth
[10:23] now Thou Art the one
[10:26] to make it real
[10:27] I pray that you'll granted in Jesus name
[10:30] amen
[10:32] now
[10:34] I'd just like for your undivided
[10:35] attention just for a moment and if
[10:37] everyone will just be seated now for a
[10:39] few minutes
[10:43] now as far as I know of course I don't
[10:47] know anyone and I can see in the in the
[10:49] building that I would know out there now
[10:51] you don't have to be here to be healed
[10:53] anyone knows that see there's a little
[10:56] woman one time she couldn't get a prayer
[10:57] card with say and she touched His
[10:59] Garment and he turned around and looked
[11:01] and said who touched me
[11:03] and they all denied it he looked around
[11:05] and seen this little woman she couldn't
[11:07] hide herself because see the spirit of
[11:09] God that was in him let him he was the
[11:11] word
[11:11] and it led right to her and he told her
[11:14] what her trouble was she had a blood
[11:15] issue and she was healed she believed it
[11:18] and immediately in her body she felt
[11:21] that the blood issue had stunts is that
[11:23] right it stopped right there
[11:25] now he's just the same today you don't
[11:27] have to be here now the Bible said that
[11:30] in the New Testament now that Jesus
[11:32] Christ is our high priest do we believe
[11:35] that the only high priest we have the
[11:39] only intercessor we have between God and
[11:41] man is the man Christ Jesus you believe
[11:42] that and the Bible said he is a high
[11:45] priest that can be touched by the
[11:47] feeling of our infirmities
[11:48] is that right I mean all that true raise
[11:51] your hands
[11:52] all right I'm not among strangers
[11:55] on this word now how would he act
[12:00] act the same that he did when he was
[12:03] here because he's the same yesterday and
[12:05] forever is that right now you just
[12:07] believe you just say oh Lord I've been
[12:10] in meetings of it but I'm just going to
[12:11] believe today I'm not even going to take
[12:13] no thought of myself I'm just going to
[12:15] believe with all my heart that you're
[12:16] here I have a need and you just you help
[12:18] me Lord
[12:19] you do that don't get nervous just just
[12:22] calmly faithful
[12:25] a gift of faith is not something you
[12:27] take and do something with a gift of
[12:29] faith is just get yourself out of the
[12:31] way the gift is get your own self out of
[12:33] the way now here stands a woman
[12:36] father God knows as far as I ever know
[12:38] what I've ever seen a woman in my life
[12:39] she's a total stranger to me
[12:42] but there isn't about two or three
[12:45] people I can see out there to do um I
[12:46] think this is Mrs Vale sitting here
[12:48] brother Lee's wife I'm not sure
[12:49] no no these three four boys sitting
[12:51] right along here
[12:53] alone here or as I know that's all and I
[12:54] see in the meeting at this time that I
[12:56] know
[12:57] I'll be that's brother Anthony Milano is
[12:59] sitting here from New York
[13:01] brother Pat Tyler from Kentucky
[13:05] outside of that
[13:06] I'm afraid stopman's in there somewhere
[13:08] I heard him holler a man a while ago
[13:11] that's that's about the limit the
[13:13] heavenly father knows that
[13:15] and this woman standing here
[13:18] and I never seen her
[13:20] I have no idea what she's here for she's
[13:23] just a woman come up here on the
[13:24] platform and see me you're sitting out
[13:26] there
[13:27] now
[13:28] If This Woman's in need
[13:30] well then I if I could help her I'd sure
[13:33] do it
[13:34] but I I depends on what she needs if it
[13:38] was money uh might rake up five or ten
[13:41] dollars
[13:43] outside of that I don't know
[13:45] let's say give her a post-dated check
[13:48] until I get my pay next month but
[13:51] now
[13:52] what if she's got domestic trouble then
[13:55] I'd say go get your husband let's talk
[13:57] together maybe I can help you I have no
[14:00] way of getting home well I ask somebody
[14:01] if they take you take you home going
[14:03] your way you live
[14:04] you live what street down
[14:10] dancing
[14:11] but I don't know the woman
[14:14] but there's someone here
[14:18] this word
[14:19] that promised the things that I do shall
[14:22] you also now perhaps what if this woman
[14:25] is sick maybe she's got cancer maybe she
[14:29] has TB
[14:31] and or something that medicine can't
[14:33] help at this at the stage
[14:36] well now I couldn't I by no means could
[14:38] heal the woman but now
[14:40] if he can reveal to me what she wants
[14:45] just like he did the woman at the well
[14:47] or like he told Nathaniel or or told
[14:49] Simon what his name was said your name
[14:52] is Simon you're the son of Jonas it's
[14:54] forth you be called
[14:56] Peter which means a little Stone
[14:58] well now if he would do something like
[15:00] that here in the presence of all of you
[15:02] that goes to shoulder that word is truth
[15:05] how many will believe that
[15:08] is there anybody here knows the woman
[15:10] raise your hand any people's in the
[15:11] building yeah all right
[15:15] father knows that I don't
[15:17] but now let's just see what he would say
[15:19] and that would that be a paradox
[15:22] I don't know what's wrong with her don't
[15:24] know what she's here for nothing about
[15:25] her but God knows that I'm going to
[15:28] speak to the woman this is the first
[15:30] person I've had before me for about
[15:31] three months
[15:33] now I just want to talk to the lady just
[15:35] a moment and that is what contact your
[15:38] spirit just like Jesus did the woman at
[15:40] the well contact your spirit
[15:42] now if the Lord Jesus lady can reveal to
[15:46] me uh what's wrong with you
[15:50] what you're here for or something about
[15:52] it you know what I don't know nothing
[15:53] about
[15:54] uh something on that order would you
[15:57] believe it was him it had to be him
[15:58] wasn't it it had to be him
[16:02] if he'll do it then we'll all be
[16:04] thankful that we're nowhere that his
[16:06] word is right then we can put confidence
[16:08] in that now if he can reveal what your
[16:11] trouble is to me and me not knowing and
[16:13] you know that but now if he can reveal
[16:15] to me what your trouble is or something
[16:17] about you then that shows that there's a
[16:19] spirit here somewhere that knows you and
[16:23] you know that I don't so it wouldn't be
[16:24] the man it would be the spirit and
[16:26] that's what God promised at this time of
[16:28] Ephesus
[16:30] you believe that to be the truth
[16:32] may he Grant him I see one thing She's
[16:36] suffering with something like a sinus
[16:38] troubles up here in her head that is
[16:41] true is it raise up your hand if it
[16:44] amen
[16:47] but scientists wouldn't cause you to
[16:50] sneeze and carry on like that so you
[16:52] have hay fever also
[16:56] you're not from Phoenix
[16:59] you're from Worthy's there's lots of
[17:01] hills trees you're from Flagstaff
[17:05] you believe God can tell me who you are
[17:08] Mrs Earl ier
[17:12] is it right is it I go believing it'll
[17:14] all be over
[17:16] I didn't see the same yesterday and
[17:18] forever now the Heavenly Father Knows
[17:22] see the word
[17:24] Vindicated now it isn't me
[17:27] I'm just a man just like this microphone
[17:29] it's a mute without me speaking to it or
[17:31] somebody and so is a man
[17:34] it's the new but it's the spirit and
[17:37] that spirit's right out there among you
[17:39] see he's the Healer not me
[17:44] how do you do sir
[17:46] another man that's a person is a
[17:48] stranger to me I don't know the man
[17:51] as far as I know I've never seen him in
[17:53] my life but now this spirit
[17:56] the Holy Spirit the holy spirit in Jesus
[18:00] Christ is the same self-spirit
[18:04] the anointed one Jesus the man was the
[18:07] son of God but the Holy Spirit was only
[18:09] with God my father dwells in me see it's
[18:12] the holy spirit so it's still God
[18:15] now if I missed it myself
[18:18] that man can get himself out of the way
[18:20] then that part's dead then let the
[18:23] spirit of Life go to work
[18:26] that's why weakness didn't see what
[18:28] happens till the morning gets started
[18:32] if the Lord God whose presence we're in
[18:35] will reveal to me sir what the your
[18:40] trouble is or something you've done or
[18:42] or something about you just something of
[18:45] course more we would talk more it would
[18:47] go but see his other standing alone
[18:49] but if he'll just tell me what your
[18:52] trouble is
[18:53] well uh
[18:54] you believe me to be his servant leave
[18:57] his presence
[18:59] a rupture
[19:01] is that right
[19:04] [Music]
[19:06] I say how was that done I wished I know
[19:11] there's nobody can explain that that's a
[19:12] paradox
[19:15] yeah that you might know I've seen
[19:17] something else an examination
[19:20] a heart trouble too raise your hand
[19:23] Mr Anderson you can go home now Jesus
[19:25] Christ
[19:27] that's right
[19:29] just believe
[19:33] I have faith how do you do sir
[19:36] we're strangers to each other
[19:38] I don't know you
[19:40] as far as I know it's the first time
[19:41] I've ever seen you or me said oh that's
[19:43] right but he knows
[19:45] both of us
[19:47] now
[19:48] you know why this has taken place it's
[19:51] his grace permitting him they would
[19:53] bring these people conscious of God
[19:56] now not knowing nothing about you
[20:00] not even knowing you're no way just a
[20:03] strange man to come here now it would be
[20:05] a absolutely a paradox
[20:07] or something to happen to to know what
[20:10] was wrong with you or something you've
[20:11] done or something you ought not have
[20:13] done or something you should have done
[20:15] or so who you are or something about you
[20:17] it has to be a paradoxical there's no
[20:19] way for anybody to know that
[20:21] outside of some revelation of the Unseen
[20:27] that's right
[20:28] now if he'll do that for you between you
[20:31] and I it's only the audience not a show
[20:34] but that they might see the the Ephesus
[20:37] is here
[20:39] that this is the thing that Bridges
[20:41] between the nomination and the glory
[20:43] land
[20:45] he promised it
[20:47] that they might be assured that what
[20:49] we're telling is the truth
[20:52] now to know you you know I don't
[20:57] that's raise up your hand so people sees
[20:58] it uh I've never seen a man in my life
[21:01] it's just a man standing here asking the
[21:03] others

[22:20] know it's impossible for me to know
[22:22] what's wrong with you or anything about
[22:23] you but it isn't possible for God to
[22:26] know because he know being before there
[22:28] was a world
[22:29] isn't that right how many believe that
[22:31] to be true
[22:32] whatever time you bat your eye

[1:19:39] a mother one time he said that she was
[1:19:41] willing to escape the fires he said but
[1:19:43] when she got out she realized that her
[1:19:45] baby was still trapped inside and he
[1:19:48] said she turned and ran back in the fire
[1:19:49] he said covered her face up ran in the
[1:19:52] fire to get her baby since she realized
[1:19:54] in there that she didn't have nothing to
[1:19:56] wrap that baby in so she took the
[1:19:58] Garment off of her face and wrapped the
[1:20:00] baby in that garment and carried the
[1:20:01] baby out of the fire and brother bear
[1:20:03] said that baby is not bearing scars
[1:20:06] today but the mother is he said because
[1:20:08] she was willing to run into the fire and
[1:20:10] I I tell you I think that love was
[1:20:12] coming from almighty God Amen that we
[1:20:14] were burning up in the fires of the
[1:20:16] world and the tribulations of this life
[1:20:18] but God would send a prophet to run

[1:20:45] Reviving the ones that you got amen and
[1:20:47] he said you can have a Revival and add
[1:20:49] 100 new members and not be no Revival at

[1:23:19] the Book of John the 14th chapter and I
[1:23:21] want to look here in the 12th verse I
[1:23:24] know it's very very familiar reading in
[1:23:27] John the 14th chapter and the 12th verse
[1:23:29] Jesus says verily verily I say unto you
[1:23:34] he that believeth on me how many
[1:23:36] believes on him
[1:23:38] he that believeth on me the works that I
[1:23:41] do shall he do also and Greater Works
[1:23:45] than these shall he do because I go unto
[1:23:48] my father amen let's just read that 12th
[1:23:51] verse together verily verily I say unto
[1:23:54] you he that believeth on me the works
[1:23:57] that I do shall he do also and Greater
[1:24:01] Works than these shall he do because I
[1:24:03] go unto my father now I believe that
[1:24:06] John 14 12 is speaking of both the head
[1:24:08] of Christ amen and the body amen if we
[1:24:12] can also look in first John the fourth
[1:24:13] chapter I just want to pull one verse
[1:24:16] there that's very familiar to the
[1:24:18] Believers tonight first John the fourth
[1:24:20] chapter
[1:24:21] I want to look in the fourth verse first
[1:24:24] John 4
[1:24:25] and 4 you love the Lord this evening
[1:24:28] amen first John 4 and 4 the Bible says
[1:24:32] ye are of God little children
[1:24:35] and have overcome them because greater
[1:24:38] now brother Brian says that greater is
[1:24:40] Christ the anointed word
[1:24:42] because greater is he that is in you
[1:24:46] than he that is in the world
[1:24:48] amen greater is he that is in you than
[1:24:51] he that is in the world we ask Lord this
[1:24:52] evening to add the blessing to the
[1:24:54] reading of his word is you can have your
[1:24:55] seats here this afternoon I want to by
[1:24:58] the help of the Lord for just a few
[1:25:00] moments I want to speak to you tonight
[1:25:01] if I title this sermon I want to speak
[1:25:03] to you on the bride's Paradox uh the
[1:25:06] bride's Paradox I I really don't believe
[1:25:09] that after uh four services on the
[1:25:11] Rapture that we could quickly move away
[1:25:13] from the thought of rapture simply
[1:25:15] because amen the word of God is eternal
[1:25:17] it's inspired it's infallible it's a
[1:25:20] perfect word amen now as I mentioned the
[1:25:23] title tonight the bride's Paradox I also
[1:25:25] want to say it's a real privilege to
[1:25:26] have the best family with us here
[1:25:27] they're really special to our hearts
[1:25:29] Amen in the Book of John you read that
[1:25:32] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:25:34] that is in the world and you hear about
[1:25:36] Greater Works now when you think of this
[1:25:38] word paradox you know that brother Brown
[1:25:40] preaches the message Paradox about six
[1:25:42] different times and tonight I'm going to
[1:25:44] be pulling a lot from all uh six of
[1:25:46] those tapes I'm not going to preach all
[1:25:48] of them but I'm pull up from them and
[1:25:50] then the message Paradox 1961 first time
[1:25:52] he preaches it he said oh the only thing
[1:25:55] that God is waiting on now is he wants
[1:25:57] to get one man he don't have to have big
[1:25:59] organizations he don't have to have big
[1:26:00] denominations he wants to get one man
[1:26:03] that he can wrap his Spirit into him
[1:26:05] that'll tell the rest of it now watch
[1:26:07] this there will be another Paradox if he
[1:26:10] can just get one man in his control
[1:26:12] there will be another paratox he said
[1:26:15] until he can get someone completely
[1:26:18] surrendered that will do that he said
[1:26:20] that's the way God does his work he uses
[1:26:23] paradoxes amen our God is Jehovah amen
[1:26:27] he's the Jehovah of Miracles and the way
[1:26:30] that he works is through paradoxes now
[1:26:32] brother says in Paradox 1963 according
[1:26:35] to Webster he said a paradox is
[1:26:37] something that seems incredible but it's
[1:26:40] true can we say that together incredible
[1:26:42] but yet it's true it's something that
[1:26:44] you cannot scientifically wrap your mind
[1:26:46] around but it's still true something the
[1:26:49] prophet said it's unreasonable but it's
[1:26:51] still true it's unexplainable but it's
[1:26:54] still true he said therefore a paradox
[1:26:56] then would be the same as a miracle so
[1:26:58] now amen of paradox a prophet has
[1:27:01] identified as a miracle he said a
[1:27:03] paradox is when something that seems
[1:27:05] like it just couldn't be amen the
[1:27:07] knowledge of the human mind it's all
[1:27:10] together incredible but yet it's proven
[1:27:12] to be true now a miracle would be the
[1:27:15] same thing for a miracle cannot be
[1:27:17] explained a miracle is something that
[1:27:19] happens and you cannot explain it he
[1:27:21] said then that makes it a paradox it's
[1:27:24] incredible but yet it's true can we say
[1:27:26] that again it's incredible but yet it's
[1:27:28] true now watch this you people today he
[1:27:31] says watch a lot of modernists believe
[1:27:33] that the days of Miracles are passed
[1:27:34] they don't believe there's such a thing
[1:27:36] as a miracle but yet I believe that the
[1:27:39] world is full of Miracles how many can
[1:27:42] raise your hand and testify amen that
[1:27:44] you still believe the god of the Bible
[1:27:46] amen Jehovah of the old Jesus of the I
[1:27:48] knew amen is a miracle working God Amen
[1:27:52] he's a paradox performing god brother
[1:27:54] Ben said Paradox is constantly so
[1:27:56] Paradox is not something that visits the
[1:27:58] church it's not something that amen that
[1:28:00] happens just in a special meeting amen
[1:28:03] but every service amen that Believers
[1:28:05] get together amen the god of paradox is
[1:28:08] in the building said what makes a
[1:28:10] paradox is when somebody believes God
[1:28:13] and takes him at his word what makes a
[1:28:16] paradox is when somebody believes God
[1:28:18] Amen and they take him at his word he
[1:28:20] said that word paradox is something that
[1:28:22] is incredible but it's true he said now
[1:28:25] you know we've heard the old saying that
[1:28:27] truth amen is more strings and fiction
[1:28:29] how many has heard that saying truth is
[1:28:31] more strange Than Fiction he said see
[1:28:33] because when a person tells the truth
[1:28:35] amen it's something that's very strange
[1:28:37] when a person tells the truth it is
[1:28:40] something that is very strange listen
[1:28:41] amen I know it does not it it does not
[1:28:44] sound strange to you Amen to hear
[1:28:46] somebody say that one day there was a
[1:28:48] tumor in their body and the next day
[1:28:50] that tumor was gone that doesn't sound
[1:28:52] strange to you amen because you're
[1:28:54] Children of the god of paradox it does
[1:28:57] not sound strange to you to hear
[1:28:59] somebody say they were blind for 20
[1:29:01] years and in a meeting amen God come
[1:29:03] down and open their blinded eyes that
[1:29:05] doesn't sound strange to you amen
[1:29:07] because you're in the you're the child
[1:29:08] of the god of paradox amen but what does
[1:29:11] sound strange to the world Amen should
[1:29:14] not sound strange to a Believer and what
[1:29:16] sounds familiar Amen to the believer
[1:29:18] amen is going to sound strange to the
[1:29:21] world Listen friends amen we are not
[1:29:23] here and layout of sea Amen to take a
[1:29:25] backseat Amen to the devil affection to
[1:29:27] the devil of science to the devil amen
[1:29:29] of knowledge we are here as the Church
[1:29:31] of the Living God Amen to take a stand
[1:29:34] and let a lost and Dying World know that
[1:29:36] for God that we are serving is not in a
[1:29:39] tomb in Jerusalem he is not in a grave
[1:29:41] in Jeffersonville Indiana amen he's not
[1:29:44] a million miles away but he is right
[1:29:46] here ain't been robed in the
[1:29:48] righteousness us of his resurrection he
[1:29:50] is moving he is healing he is saving he
[1:29:53] is delivered he is still performing
[1:29:55] paradoxes amen there's no mountain too
[1:29:57] high and there's no Valley too low
[1:29:59] there's no desert too dry there's no
[1:30:02] trial too long amen by what the god of
[1:30:04] paradox will come on the scene amen and
[1:30:07] in the moment in the twinkling of the
[1:30:09] night amen he will change the situation
[1:30:11] amen I know it sounds strange to the
[1:30:13] world but it is shouting sounds to the
[1:30:15] Church of the Living God Amen the world
[1:30:18] accepts fiction but they reject
[1:30:20] Vindicated truth think about that the
[1:30:23] world accepts a fictional story but they
[1:30:25] reject they prove and Vindicated truth
[1:30:28] of almighty God now the prophet said
[1:30:30] truth is more Stranger Than Fiction
[1:30:32] isn't him he said one time over in
[1:30:34] Switzerland they tell their children
[1:30:36] amen that William Tell shot the Apple
[1:30:38] off of a boy's head you read the story
[1:30:41] he said but when I come over there
[1:30:42] that's a lie it's never been done
[1:30:44] they've been thinking about this how
[1:30:46] many parents Amen brother us have had to
[1:30:49] go against our own conscience they meant
[1:30:51] to tell that lie amen that hundreds of
[1:30:53] years later that lie amen may still be
[1:30:56] living in a child's heart to believe
[1:30:58] that William Tell shot an apple off of
[1:31:01] this boy's head listen friends we ain't
[1:31:03] got to lie to tell our children amen
[1:31:05] that Georgia Carter got up out of a band
[1:31:07] we ain't gonna lie to tell our children
[1:31:09] that Florence Nightingale was down to
[1:31:11] nothing and the saving grace of God
[1:31:14] raised tobacco we're not lying when we
[1:31:16] tell our children that William Upshaw
[1:31:18] was in a wheelchair for 66 years but in
[1:31:21] a moment in the tweaking amen of an eye
[1:31:23] in a meeting a man got out of a
[1:31:25] wheelchair I'm on Church we're not a
[1:31:27] bunch of liars we're not a bunch of
[1:31:28] crazy people we are Sons and Daughters
[1:31:31] of Truth and I think it's time to raise
[1:31:33] our voice and let our young people know
[1:31:36] what God did for us he can do it for
[1:31:38] them what God did for our pastors he can
[1:31:41] do it for them what God did for the
[1:31:43] prophet he is here to do it for you amen
[1:31:45] you didn't come in late amen you didn't
[1:31:47] come in too late you're still in the
[1:31:49] presence of the god of paradox amen I
[1:31:52] think I feel like preaching here tonight
[1:31:53] is there anybody can testify amen that
[1:31:56] our God is still a miracle working God
[1:31:59] is there anybody that can testify amen I
[1:32:02] shouldn't be sitting here tonight amen
[1:32:04] it's incredible to think that I'm Not
[1:32:06] Dead in a grave but it's true it's
[1:32:08] incredible to think that the devil's
[1:32:10] through everything he had at me he's
[1:32:12] done everything he could to steal my joy
[1:32:15] and to silence my praise and discuss my
[1:32:18] testimony amen but greater is he that is
[1:32:21] in you than he that is in the world and
[1:32:23] every time the devil tried to Bear you
[1:32:25] he forgot that there was a germanized
[1:32:28] representation of the god of paradox on
[1:32:31] the inside of your soul I want you back
[1:32:33] up to no devil affection won't you back
[1:32:36] up to no negative devil don't you back
[1:32:38] up to no cancer devil I want you back up
[1:32:40] to no depression devil won't you back up
[1:32:42] to no suicidal level you have been
[1:32:45] anointed amen by the god of paradox to
[1:32:48] pursue that death and to recover
[1:32:50] everything that devil has stole from you
[1:32:52] as a child of the god of paradox hey
[1:32:55] it's a paradox we are living in an evil
[1:32:58] world how many agrees we are living in
[1:33:00] an evil world Amen but I want to say
[1:33:02] this we are Sanctified by the god of
[1:33:05] righteousness we are living in an evil
[1:33:08] world but we are Sanctified by the god
[1:33:11] of righteousness what does that mean
[1:33:13] that is a paradox it's incredible but
[1:33:16] it's true
[1:33:18] I love what Jesus said I pray not that
[1:33:20] thou should take them out of the world
[1:33:21] but thou shall keep them from the evil
[1:33:24] so he's not going to take you out of the
[1:33:26] world to overcome the world he's going
[1:33:28] to leave you in the world to overcome
[1:33:30] the world Amen because greater is he
[1:33:33] that is in you that is in the world that
[1:33:36] he that is in the world oh my what is
[1:33:38] that church that's a paradox he said
[1:33:40] they are not of the world even as I am
[1:33:43] not of the world sanctify them through
[1:33:45] the truth amen for Thy word is truth
[1:33:48] watch this we've just identified what
[1:33:50] truth is truth is the word remember said
[1:33:54] the perfect manifestation of God in the
[1:33:56] son was by the indwelling spirit
[1:33:59] manifesting in word and works when the
[1:34:02] bride will get back to being a word
[1:34:03] bride she will produce the very works
[1:34:06] that Jesus produced what was John 14 12
[1:34:09] saying amen Greater Works than this how
[1:34:12] you do he said the word is God and the
[1:34:16] spirit is God and they are all one see
[1:34:18] one cannot work apart from the other he
[1:34:21] said notice if only one true had the
[1:34:23] spirit of God he will have the word of
[1:34:25] God that's how it was with the prophets
[1:34:27] they had the indwelling spirit of God
[1:34:30] and the word came to them brother they
[1:34:33] did not find the word the word found
[1:34:36] them he said see that is how it was with
[1:34:38] Jesus in him was the spirit without
[1:34:40] measure and the word came to him and
[1:34:43] Jesus both began to do and teach my
[1:34:46] Doctrine it's not my own but the father
[1:34:48] that sent me he said remember now John
[1:34:51] the Baptist was both prophet and the
[1:34:53] messenger of his name he was filled with
[1:34:55] the holy ghost from his mother's womb
[1:34:58] when he was baptizing in the Jordan of
[1:35:00] the word of God Jesus came to him the
[1:35:02] word always comes to the truly Spirit
[1:35:05] field that's the evidence of being
[1:35:07] filled with the Holy Ghost is that Jesus
[1:35:09] said would be the evidence he said I
[1:35:12] will pray the father he will send you
[1:35:13] another comforter that he may abide with
[1:35:15] you forever even the spirit of truth
[1:35:18] whom the world cannot receive you know
[1:35:21] why they cannot receive the spirit of
[1:35:23] truth because they have received the
[1:35:25] spirit of error which has caused them to
[1:35:27] believe a lie and to be damned by lie
[1:35:30] amen but there is a pride upon the Earth
[1:35:32] who is not believing a lie and she's not
[1:35:35] being done by lie and she's not
[1:35:37] wondering to laodicea under a strong
[1:35:39] Spirit of delusion but she has risen
[1:35:42] above amen the deceptions of laodicea
[1:35:45] she has risen above the confusions of
[1:35:47] this age and she is standing underneath
[1:35:50] the direction of the spirit of truth and
[1:35:52] the word is the truth my Jesus said the
[1:35:55] word amen would come only to the Holy
[1:35:58] Ghost see the word and the spirit are
[1:36:00] not separate they are the same thing he
[1:36:03] said did you notice that Jesus said the
[1:36:06] word the world could not receive the
[1:36:08] Holy Ghost there's why they're not
[1:36:10] seeing paradoxes as they cannot receive
[1:36:13] the one that performs the paradox
[1:36:16] right well in this verse I just read
[1:36:18] neither could they receive the word
[1:36:20] because the spirit and the word are one
[1:36:23] and if you have the Holy Spirit as the
[1:36:26] prophets then the word will come to you
[1:36:28] here it is the evidence would be that
[1:36:30] you would be in the truth you would be
[1:36:32] in the word of God for your age evidence
[1:36:35] has to do with receiving the word so the
[1:36:39] evidence of the Holy Ghost is not your
[1:36:41] shouting it's not our dancing it is not
[1:36:44] Pentecostals identifying it as speaking
[1:36:46] in tongues but the evidence of the Holy
[1:36:48] Ghost is the receiving of the anointed
[1:36:51] word in the allotted AIDs that you're
[1:36:53] living in hormone Church the prophets
[1:36:55] that the evidence of a Spirit-filled
[1:36:57] Christian believer is not to produce the
[1:36:59] truthful word amen but to receive the
[1:37:02] truth which is the word and to believe
[1:37:04] it and Obey it listen You'll never see a
[1:37:07] paradox just believe in the word you'll
[1:37:09] ever see a paradox just shouting about
[1:37:12] the word but when you can believe that
[1:37:14] word and you can obey that word and you
[1:37:16] can fight back against every devil in
[1:37:18] hell with the authority of that word
[1:37:21] then you will see our tremendous God he
[1:37:24] will come into action and he will
[1:37:25] perform a paradox before your very eyes
[1:37:28] listen we are not in a picnic we're in a
[1:37:31] battle and it's a battle for truth the
[1:37:34] prophet set them in just been lost God
[1:37:36] said it would be restored again in the
[1:37:38] last day and we're looking for him we're
[1:37:40] looking for his manifestation and we
[1:37:43] will see the Vindicated word of God
[1:37:45] there'll be just a few understand it but
[1:37:48] as it was in the days of Noah can I
[1:37:51] preach
[1:37:52] as it was in the days of Noah so will it
[1:37:55] be in the coming of the son of man he
[1:37:58] said what was saved in the days of law
[1:38:00] there was actually three saved he said
[1:38:02] the wife started out amen and she was
[1:38:05] lost amen so shall it be in the coming
[1:38:08] of the son of man there will be very few
[1:38:11] saved amen translated in that time and
[1:38:14] one of the mysteries of that church
[1:38:16] being taken up can I tell you what the
[1:38:18] victory amen for the Battle of truth
[1:38:20] will be the victory in the Battle of
[1:38:23] truth will be the rapture
[1:38:25] the victory in the Battle of truth will
[1:38:28] be the Rapture you say why do you say
[1:38:30] that because the prophet said amen the
[1:38:33] Church of the Living God the bride she
[1:38:35] will move right on just the same listen
[1:38:37] she will go in the Rapture by the word
[1:38:41] she will not go in the Rapture by the
[1:38:43] way she feels she will not go in the
[1:38:45] Rapture by the way things are she will
[1:38:47] not go in the Rapture based upon end
[1:38:49] time conditions she will go in the
[1:38:52] Rapture upon the basis of the Vindicated
[1:38:55] manifested anointed word in the age
[1:38:57] listen that's right amen the word will
[1:39:00] take her in the Rapture listen I know
[1:39:02] we're living in an intellectual age I'm
[1:39:04] trying to keep from preaching Leia
[1:39:06] Foundation but y'all are pulling he said
[1:39:08] the intellectual age we're living in he
[1:39:10] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:39:13] he can steal can I can I get a little
[1:39:15] class participation here he said he can
[1:39:18] still discern the thoughts of the human
[1:39:19] heart
[1:39:21] he can still change man he can still
[1:39:24] keep every word he promised in this day
[1:39:26] he can still manifest and let them take
[1:39:29] the picture that same color of fire that
[1:39:31] followed Israel the same one that was
[1:39:33] with the Lord Jesus the same one that
[1:39:35] was down where was Saul on the road the
[1:39:37] same one that come in and delivered
[1:39:39] Peter out of the prison he said that
[1:39:41] same angel of God is here tonight and
[1:39:44] he's doing the very same thing it did
[1:39:46] when it was here on Earth manifested
[1:39:49] Amen in human flesh people ask me they
[1:39:52] said with Andrew what is this message
[1:39:54] really is is it a book is it a tape is
[1:39:56] it a cliche is it a quote is it a
[1:39:59] Doctrine I'll tell you what I hear when
[1:40:01] I hear this message I hear about Jesus
[1:40:03] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:40:06] forever coming back into the Earth not
[1:40:09] in a Corporal body but in a redeemed
[1:40:11] body amen called The Flesh of the Bride
[1:40:14] of Jesus Christ the same angel of God is
[1:40:17] here tonight and he's doing the very
[1:40:19] same thing it did when he was here on
[1:40:20] the Earth manifested in human flesh I'm
[1:40:23] on Church you ain't got to go back there
[1:40:25] to meet him he's come into this age to
[1:40:27] meet you you ain't got to go back to the
[1:40:30] prison house that Peter was in you ain't
[1:40:32] got to go back to the road of Damascus
[1:40:34] amen that Paul was home amen by brother
[1:40:36] Mark for one that was back there is in
[1:40:39] this building tonight and he's pulsating
[1:40:41] in my heart I am the same yesterday I am
[1:40:44] the same today I'll be the same tomorrow
[1:40:47] and behold I stand at the door and knock
[1:40:50] and if any man will hear my voice what
[1:40:52] is his voice brother Branham his voice
[1:40:54] is his word and it's a scriptural voice
[1:40:57] and he will open the door then I will
[1:40:59] come into him and I will sup with him
[1:41:02] and I will reveal myself among church
[1:41:05] it's supper time amen it's supper time
[1:41:08] it's time to open the door unless the
[1:41:11] service of the Lord come in and serve
[1:41:14] his Victorious children the bread which
[1:41:17] is a revelation of his word this is the
[1:41:20] angel of God back in human flesh can I
[1:41:24] preach I believe says that God is
[1:41:27] wanting people to believe in a paradox
[1:41:32] well Andrew I don't know if I can
[1:41:33] believe it the prophet just gave you a
[1:41:36] license
[1:41:37] he just gave you a right to believe in
[1:41:40] the god of paradox he said I went way
[1:41:42] over my time I believe it could be a
[1:41:44] paradox right here
[1:41:46] brother I read that today and something
[1:41:48] ran through my body I've been believe it
[1:41:50] could be a paradox right here I believe
[1:41:53] that God is willing and waiting to take
[1:41:55] his people and show himself if he can
[1:41:58] only get a man or a woman or a boy or a
[1:42:00] girl they meant to lay down their own
[1:42:02] thoughts and become a prisoner to him
[1:42:04] and believe him he is the word somebody
[1:42:07] help me he is the word in the beginning
[1:42:10] was the word and the Word was with God
[1:42:12] and the Word was God and the Word was
[1:42:14] made flesh and brought Among Us he said
[1:42:17] and now he is in you come on Church
[1:42:20] what's making you a prisoner amen it's
[1:42:22] not your Mom and Daddy it's not the
[1:42:24] clothes you're wearing it's not the
[1:42:26] preacher you're here it's not the tapes
[1:42:28] you're listening to what is making you a
[1:42:30] prisoner it's the word has claimed your
[1:42:33] flesh in this wicked and adulterous
[1:42:35] generation your body has become the
[1:42:38] claiming grounds amen for the god of
[1:42:40] paradox to manifest himself through once
[1:42:43] again he is in you what is he he is the
[1:42:47] hope of glory he is the same yesterday
[1:42:49] today day and forever what are you
[1:42:52] saying brother Andrew I'm saying we are
[1:42:54] in the god of paradox and the god of
[1:42:56] paradoxes in Us in other words it is a
[1:43:00] uniting time and the uniting side the
[1:43:03] god of paradox has come into the Flesh
[1:43:06] of people that believe in Paradox and
[1:43:08] brother Terry because they're believing
[1:43:10] in Paradox the god of paradox it's not
[1:43:13] just going to make them come to church
[1:43:14] and read about what he did for Noah and
[1:43:16] read about what he did for Abraham and
[1:43:18] read about what he did for Sarah oh God
[1:43:20] I feel like preaching but he's going to
[1:43:22] claim their bodies and he's going to
[1:43:24] make them paradoxes listen amen he's not
[1:43:27] going to rewrite Paul's story he's going
[1:43:29] to write Hope's story he's not going to
[1:43:31] rewrite Peter's story he's going to
[1:43:33] write Branson's story he's not going to
[1:43:35] rewrite William random story he's going
[1:43:38] to write Thomas this story by what
[1:43:40] Authority do you say he's going to write
[1:43:42] a story about this bride Greater Works
[1:43:44] than this how you do it's an incredible
[1:43:46] Paradox but it's true can anybody tell
[1:43:50] me what I just said is not true can
[1:43:53] anybody tell me that's what God that he
[1:44:02] that Hill cannot raise
[1:44:04] glory to God he said God of paradox what
[1:44:08] are you saying I'm saying we are in the
[1:44:10] god of paradox the god of paradoxes in
[1:44:12] US therefore If any man be in Christ he
[1:44:15] is a new creature
[1:44:17] old things are passed away sister Dan
[1:44:20] and all things are passed away I'm on
[1:44:23] church I don't know if you believe this
[1:44:24] or not but I'm gonna preach my heart
[1:44:26] it's a new day it's a new season it's a
[1:44:30] new age amen it's a fresh Revival I'm on
[1:44:33] church we ain't got to live under the
[1:44:34] stigmatism of under the stagnant amen
[1:44:37] ideas and denomination we do not have to
[1:44:40] approach one service under a history
[1:44:42] mentality we do not have to have one
[1:44:44] prayer line and talk about what God used
[1:44:47] to do but before we have a prayer line
[1:44:49] we can talk about what he did for Amos
[1:44:51] we can talk about what he did for Sean
[1:44:53] we can talk about what he did for
[1:44:54] Rayanne you know why because he's a god
[1:44:56] of paradox I'm on church we ain't got to
[1:44:59] talk about him delivering somebody 50
[1:45:00] years ago we can talk about what he done
[1:45:03] for you Mariah we can talk about what he
[1:45:05] did for you brother Kevin because the
[1:45:07] god of paradox has come into the church
[1:45:09] and the church has come in to the god of
[1:45:12] paradise then I say with everything
[1:45:13] within me House of Hell give way to the
[1:45:17] name of Jesus Christ there's a mighty
[1:45:19] God on the scene
[1:45:21] he's not a weak dirty old grandpa he's a
[1:45:24] mighty God he still performs paradoxes
[1:45:27] when it looks impossible he'll come true
[1:45:32] when it looks like it's too late he's
[1:45:34] right on time when it looks like for
[1:45:37] conditions they enter too bad he shows
[1:45:40] up in the Midnight Hour I'm on Church
[1:45:42] you say Melanie this is the darkest hour
[1:45:44] my family's ever seen this is the
[1:45:46] darkest hour my church has ever seen
[1:45:48] this is the darkest hour my body's ever
[1:45:50] seen thank you for telling me you are in
[1:45:52] a position to see the god of paradox
[1:45:55] because it's always the darkest of hours
[1:45:57] and then Jesus comes on the scene it's
[1:46:00] when there is nowhere else to turn to he
[1:46:03] shows up
[1:46:04] you know why because you've not been
[1:46:07] prettier to believe Baptist Doctrine
[1:46:08] you've not been prettier to believe
[1:46:10] Pentecostal shuck you you have been put
[1:46:12] here as a voice of the god of paradox If
[1:46:16] any man be in Christ he's a new creature
[1:46:18] old things are passed away behold all
[1:46:21] things somebody say all things are
[1:46:23] become new I love what Paul says to whom
[1:46:26] God would make known what is the riches
[1:46:28] of the glory of the mystery among the
[1:46:30] Gentiles which is Christ in you
[1:46:34] the hope of glory I believe that every
[1:46:37] man every born-again member of the body
[1:46:39] of Christ is a paradox in themselves ah
[1:46:43] now we just figured out why you can't
[1:46:44] figure yourself out you're a paradox or
[1:46:47] you hearing me every born-again member
[1:46:49] of the body of Jesus Christ is a paradox
[1:46:53] Birmingham said I believe each one of
[1:46:55] you Methodist Presbyterian Lutheran they
[1:46:57] never had an experience in the baptism
[1:46:59] of the Holy Spirit was in some formal
[1:47:01] church amen that did not believe in the
[1:47:03] genuine New Birth but have now received
[1:47:06] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a
[1:47:08] perfect example of a paradox because
[1:47:11] Something's Happened to you that changed
[1:47:14] oh God it changed your whole being
[1:47:18] anyone could look at that and know what
[1:47:21] a paradox is it's a miracle can I take
[1:47:24] my sword out and preach for a second
[1:47:25] what are you going to preach against I'm
[1:47:27] going to preach against that negative
[1:47:28] devil that tells us every day we're not
[1:47:30] seeing Miracles I'm going to preach
[1:47:32] against that long tongue line slow foot
[1:47:34] Slicker devil Lucifer that tells us that
[1:47:37] we're just wasting our time we're just
[1:47:39] going to church and going to meetings
[1:47:40] and paying tithes and paying offerings
[1:47:42] and singing a few songs that is a Lie
[1:47:44] from the pits of hell you got up this
[1:47:47] morning you are a miracle you lived
[1:47:49] another week and Satan's heated listen
[1:47:51] if anybody got a right to shout tonight
[1:47:53] in the city of Blacksburg Virginia it's
[1:47:55] the Bride of Jesus Christ she lived
[1:47:58] another day in Satan's Eden and she's
[1:48:01] found her way in the house of God and
[1:48:03] she's not lost her mind she's not on
[1:48:05] dope trying to get through but she is a
[1:48:07] powerful bride she is a Victorious bride
[1:48:10] she is an anointed bride by the anointed
[1:48:12] word I'm known church and might as well
[1:48:14] say it you're a miracle
[1:48:16] you're a miracle rather Landing you're a
[1:48:19] miracle you're a miracle tonight every
[1:48:21] devil in hell has done everything he can
[1:48:24] to destroy this bride and here she
[1:48:26] stands tonight because she is a paradox
[1:48:30] oh a son and daughter of God not by the
[1:48:33] nomination not my Creed not by handshake
[1:48:36] by birth word Birth by a birth military
[1:48:39] that you have died to your own
[1:48:41] intellects and been born of the spirit
[1:48:43] of God and you are a paradox yourself
[1:48:46] how that you've been changed amen from
[1:48:49] Death unto life
[1:48:51] you have been changed from Death under
[1:48:54] life from your innermost being is a new
[1:48:57] creation in Christ Jesus it's a paradox
[1:49:00] can we say it again incredible but yet
[1:49:03] it's true
[1:49:05] incredible but yet it's true amen Shake
[1:49:08] somebody's hand slap somebody on the
[1:49:10] knee do somebody something to you next
[1:49:11] to you and say it's incredible but it's
[1:49:14] true it's incredible but it's true but
[1:49:17] Amos it's incredible but it's true what
[1:49:20] are you saying I'm saying this message
[1:49:22] is incredible but it's true I'm saying
[1:49:25] the seven things always incredible but
[1:49:27] he was true I'm saying the Bride of
[1:49:29] Jesus Christ Sister Janet she is
[1:49:31] incredible but she is true I'm going to
[1:49:34] church some of you all right here
[1:49:35] tonight amen need to let go and praise
[1:49:37] God because you lived another year from
[1:49:40] last year's January meetings and you
[1:49:42] didn't regress and you didn't go back
[1:49:44] amen but you're closer to the city that
[1:49:47] Abraham sent out to find you know why
[1:49:49] because the god of paradox is on your
[1:49:52] side that God apparentox is holding your
[1:49:55] hand he's bringing you through the
[1:49:57] palace he's bringing you through the
[1:49:59] mountains he's bringing you through the
[1:50:00] trials he's going to bring you out on
[1:50:02] the other side and he's going to present
[1:50:04] you as a spot the sinless Bride of Jesus
[1:50:07] Christ
[1:50:09] it's incredible it's incredible but it's
[1:50:11] true you know why it's the word doing
[1:50:14] this
[1:50:16] it's the word doing this his word that
[1:50:19] spoke I'm gonna try to behave brother
[1:50:21] Bill his word that spoke the world into
[1:50:24] existence can make every word that he
[1:50:28] ever promised come to pass
[1:50:31] the word that spoke the world into
[1:50:35] existence has come back into flesh and
[1:50:39] that voice is speaking the spoken word
[1:50:41] and bringing every promise of this Bible
[1:50:44] in to existence in other words Abraham
[1:50:49] you're up on the mountain and there is
[1:50:51] no Ram but you spoke the word and said
[1:50:54] listen the lad and I will return little
[1:50:57] let Abraham realize he was not speaking
[1:50:59] about brother Walker Going up here and
[1:51:01] killing a killing Isaac and then
[1:51:02] resurrecting him that's what he thought
[1:51:04] but what God Said Abraham you've been
[1:51:07] faithful and you just kept on going
[1:51:09] forward brother Kevin you just kept on
[1:51:11] pressing forward listen and there's a
[1:51:13] miracle in the making oh God and I just
[1:51:15] preached my heart to you right now hold
[1:51:17] on Church don't swap your hands don't
[1:51:19] turn around don't give up there's a
[1:51:21] miracle in the making there's a miracle
[1:51:23] in the oven there's a miracle in the
[1:51:25] bacon and one of these days You're Gonna
[1:51:27] think it's just about over and then all
[1:51:29] of a sudden sister broke that miracle
[1:51:31] it's going to come in the manifestation
[1:51:33] you say what is that Miracle it's not
[1:51:35] just the healing of the body it's not
[1:51:37] just the Rays of the dead it's the
[1:51:39] changing of the Mortal body I could have
[1:51:42] very well titled this surrounded by the
[1:51:45] Paradox of rapture among Church you're
[1:51:47] surrounded by this message you're
[1:51:49] surrounded by this anointing you're
[1:51:51] surrounded by this power
[1:51:54] what is it it's God in you somebody say
[1:51:56] god in me it's God in Me y'all forgive
[1:51:59] me I accidentally stopped the timer so I
[1:52:01] don't know where we're at he is the word
[1:52:03] with its true interpretation the true
[1:52:05] interpretation of the Bible for God
[1:52:08] himself is in you speaking back his own
[1:52:11] interpretation what is the Bible the
[1:52:13] Bible is the word it's the Blessed old
[1:52:16] story of Jesus Christ and it's not been
[1:52:19] changed it's not been altered it's not
[1:52:22] been diluted come on now it's not been
[1:52:25] weakened it's just as powerful tonight
[1:52:29] as it was the day it was put in ink laid
[1:52:33] upon paper you say brother Andrew how
[1:52:35] are you getting this Peter said we've
[1:52:36] already heard it this week but I'm going
[1:52:37] to quote it again we have not followed
[1:52:39] cunningly devised fables when we made
[1:52:41] known unto you the power of the coming
[1:52:43] of our Lord Jesus Christ but we were
[1:52:45] eyewitnesses of his majesty look at this
[1:52:47] word cunningly it means to become wise
[1:52:50] to have understanding to invent it means
[1:52:53] to play the sofas it means to devise
[1:52:55] cleverly or cunnally now that that
[1:52:58] definition there play the sofas is
[1:53:00] actually related to the word skepticism
[1:53:03] how many agree we're living in an age
[1:53:04] that is full of skepticism come on now
[1:53:07] but it's full of skepticism but I love
[1:53:09] what a prophet said he's praying he said
[1:53:11] may he perform in their hearts the work
[1:53:14] of the new birth and bring to that
[1:53:16] Redemption power of his resurrection
[1:53:18] taking away all Shadows of doubt and
[1:53:20] unbelief and destroying all skepticism
[1:53:24] that the church might move on in the
[1:53:26] perfect harmony with the will of God as
[1:53:29] present it by the Bible I am the Holy
[1:53:31] Spirit I love what he says here he said
[1:53:33] now I know this sounds rational but if
[1:53:35] you'll just bear with us a few minutes I
[1:53:37] believe this is a mouthful brother
[1:53:39] Matthew I believe that I by God's help
[1:53:42] with his word and according to his word
[1:53:45] I can bring him right here before you
[1:53:49] come on church that's not a sophist
[1:53:52] that's not a skeptic that's not a
[1:53:54] polished up so Sayer that's a man that
[1:53:57] stood on the back side of the desert he
[1:53:59] stood on the sacred Sands and he's met
[1:54:01] God face to face and there's been
[1:54:03] something imparted into him of assurance
[1:54:05] that I can bring the god of Heaven in
[1:54:08] this building he'll stand face to face
[1:54:10] with you and you will see that it's a
[1:54:12] consolation it is just a myth is it just
[1:54:14] some words put together is it some
[1:54:16] Jewish fables or is it the truth where
[1:54:19] there is so much error there has got to
[1:54:21] be a truth somewhere listen friends
[1:54:23] where there is a bogus dollar there's a
[1:54:25] real one made out of it where there is a
[1:54:27] much impersonation many things we see
[1:54:29] today then it's got to be a genuine God
[1:54:32] somewhere has it ever dawned on you it
[1:54:35] it actually strikes me kind of odd that
[1:54:37] you get up and tell somebody about a
[1:54:40] demonic manifestation and they'll ooh
[1:54:42] and ah they'll never ask you for one
[1:54:44] evidence about it they'll never say well
[1:54:46] can you prove it they'll say oh my
[1:54:48] goodness that's in man I'm getting
[1:54:50] Goosebumps that's where you mean that
[1:54:52] devil spoke how that person oh see amen
[1:54:54] but you stand up and say Here's the
[1:54:56] supernatural manifestation that a man
[1:54:58] was out in there oh God he was out in
[1:55:00] Sabina Canyon and there was a rock
[1:55:02] laying there from creation and there was
[1:55:04] no way for him to find a Supernatural
[1:55:06] part of it but they sent a rock bastard
[1:55:08] through there and they'll say that's a
[1:55:09] little far-fetched that's a little too
[1:55:11] far out there is it really is it really
[1:55:13] too far out there is it really too far
[1:55:15] after to believe that a man stood in the
[1:55:18] woods and spoke the word and squirrels
[1:55:20] come into existence is it really too far
[1:55:22] to Believe come on church amen we are
[1:55:24] not the Sons and Daughters of error we
[1:55:26] are the sons and daughters of Truth we
[1:55:29] must have the truth or we'll die and you
[1:55:31] know what we'll do we'll fight for this
[1:55:33] truth we'll preach this truth we'll
[1:55:35] shout on this truth we'll cast out
[1:55:37] Devils with this truth you know why
[1:55:39] because it's not a Jewish Fable it's not
[1:55:41] some mythical fleshly Mind of a man
[1:55:43] trying to make it up it's the word of
[1:55:46] God thoroughly Vindicated and thunder
[1:55:48] out in this age it is the Fulfillment of
[1:55:50] Prophecy come on church I'll tell you
[1:55:52] why you're here tonight it's cause
[1:55:54] you're living in a world where the Bible
[1:55:55] said the time will come when they will
[1:55:58] not endure sound Doctrine can I preach
[1:56:00] my heart to you can I preach Mark to you
[1:56:02] Sabina Canyon is sound Doctrine
[1:56:06] sunset Mountain is sound Doctrine among
[1:56:09] church amen a pillar of fire in Houston
[1:56:11] Coliseum is sound Doctrine amen Seven
[1:56:14] Peaks and Corral in Colorado is sound
[1:56:17] Doctrine you say well it ain't sound to
[1:56:19] me well what are you a fictional
[1:56:20] believer or a truth believer amen it
[1:56:22] makes perfect sense to me that a prophet
[1:56:25] stood there I'm known church when you
[1:56:26] got the god of paradox in your heart you
[1:56:28] can identify the god of paradox anywhere
[1:56:30] Anytime Anyplace under any condition
[1:56:33] come on friends we God just preacher for
[1:56:36] a second we've come too far to let the
[1:56:38] devil tell us that God don't love us
[1:56:40] we've seen too many sovereign acts of
[1:56:43] his Sovereign Grace to show us that he
[1:56:45] loves us and he cares for us and he's
[1:56:47] with us and he's upon us and he's
[1:56:50] anointed us and we're not the feet we
[1:56:52] are the head of this thing what are you
[1:56:54] stand by there and do I'm saying how
[1:56:56] many can testify in the darkest moments
[1:56:58] when you felt like you weren't loved
[1:57:00] when you felt like everything was
[1:57:01] against you out of nowhere you saw a
[1:57:04] supernatural manifestation
[1:57:06] a known church I could take testimonies
[1:57:09] right now and pile up on that Devil's
[1:57:11] Head their award a few years ago out in
[1:57:13] Arizona they've been tired and weary
[1:57:15] from preaching the gospel ready to go
[1:57:17] home ready to see his family looked up
[1:57:19] in the heavens and said God do you even
[1:57:21] know I'm out here am I even doing any
[1:57:23] good do you love me do you care for me
[1:57:25] and he pulled his car over walked out
[1:57:27] into a canyon looked down in there later
[1:57:29] coin out in the middle of nowhere and he
[1:57:32] turned it over and it said I know the
[1:57:35] thoughts I think towards you they are
[1:57:37] not thoughts of people but their
[1:57:39] thoughts of Peace what was that when he
[1:57:41] needed it look God of paradox come on
[1:57:43] the scene to remind him I know you're in
[1:57:46] the line of duty and I know you feel
[1:57:48] like turning around and I know you
[1:57:50] cannot go at home and I know this mind
[1:57:52] battle is whipping you to death but stay
[1:57:54] in position stay in the line of duty
[1:57:57] I've not forgot you I'm the one that
[1:58:00] said I'll never leave you I'll never
[1:58:02] forsake you I'll be with you always even
[1:58:05] to the end of the age
[1:58:07] somebody shot we're not alone
[1:58:10] Oh shot it like some people are Paradox
[1:58:12] we're not alone we may look surrounded
[1:58:15] but we're not surrounded just by the
[1:58:17] devil there's an unseen host
[1:58:21] they're turned to fables from truth will
[1:58:24] not endure sound Doctrine father God
[1:58:26] said what is it you've let me live long
[1:58:27] enough God to see what's happened it's
[1:58:30] laying right here in the Cornerstone of
[1:58:32] this Tabernacle today 33 years ago he
[1:58:34] said it this way there will not endure
[1:58:36] sound Doctrine they will turn their ears
[1:58:38] from the truth and will be turned into
[1:58:40] Fables
[1:58:42] oh I think this is powerful God is
[1:58:44] calling a bride and the devil is calling
[1:58:48] the church
[1:58:50] yet somewhere
[1:58:52] somewhere out in this mess out of direct
[1:58:54] quote out in this mess is Still Honest
[1:58:57] people that's been ordained alive oh God
[1:59:01] that's Hallelujah out in this mess out
[1:59:05] in this deity in this this Corruption of
[1:59:08] laodicea there's still some people
[1:59:11] that is ordained alive what are you
[1:59:13] saying I'm saying you're the true bride
[1:59:14] therefore the true bride amen is a
[1:59:17] paradox you know what makes her a
[1:59:18] paradox is she stays with the word
[1:59:21] remember sit on the wings of a snow
[1:59:23] white dove the dove is always loyal to
[1:59:25] his mate never leaves her I could preach
[1:59:29] right there all night the dove is always
[1:59:31] loyal to his mate he never leaves her
[1:59:34] and may I stop here for just a moment
[1:59:37] and say this the true bride the female
[1:59:39] dove is loyal to her mate too
[1:59:43] she won't inject any Dogma any
[1:59:46] denominational Doctrine anything in the
[1:59:48] world it'll stay loyal to its mate the
[1:59:51] word always loyal I'm known Church you
[1:59:55] oh can I preach that's what's getting
[1:59:58] you through is you've been connected to
[2:00:00] your mate and you're staying loyal when
[2:00:02] you got every reason to turn around now
[2:00:04] you say what are you getting at I'm
[2:00:06] saying this the Bible is full of
[2:00:08] paradoxes I'm not going to read them all
[2:00:10] to you but I could tell you about one
[2:00:12] with a man named Noah it was
[2:00:14] unscientific to believe that rain would
[2:00:16] come out of the sky enough to flood an
[2:00:19] entire world Amen but a man would rise
[2:00:21] upon an r on an ark with gopher wood
[2:00:23] that was incredible Sister Janet but it
[2:00:26] was true I could tell you about the
[2:00:28] Hebrew children amen science wouldn't
[2:00:30] believe that a man could go into a
[2:00:32] furnace amen but those men went in there
[2:00:34] amen some think about this those man
[2:00:37] that went in there Amen to put them in
[2:00:39] there they perished amen by the intents
[2:00:41] he the furnace against them but prophet
[2:00:43] God said but oh God performing a miracle
[2:00:46] that was a genuine Paradox of the
[2:00:49] keeping power of God against any enemy
[2:00:52] when a man is ready to admit that God is
[2:00:55] true
[2:00:56] a paradox when a man is ready to admit
[2:01:00] that God is true but God of paradox will
[2:01:03] come on the scene and perform a paradox
[2:01:05] look at a man named Daniel in a den full
[2:01:07] of hungry lines a minimum for God of
[2:01:09] paradox brought him out look at a man
[2:01:11] named Samson I I could get a little
[2:01:13] Pentecostal here look at a man named
[2:01:15] Samson who was on Amen a journey and a
[2:01:18] journey for the Lord right and the Bible
[2:01:20] says he comes to a place and he was
[2:01:22] surrounded by a thousand Philistines
[2:01:24] amen he didn't have a machine gun he
[2:01:27] didn't have a machete he didn't have a
[2:01:29] sword but he looked down oh God he
[2:01:31] looked down for the Jordan and there
[2:01:34] laid in the middle of the road amen an
[2:01:36] old dry Jawbone don't tell me that when
[2:01:38] the moments you need him the most he
[2:01:40] will not show up there with Samson it
[2:01:43] looked like Sister Kim I feel good right
[2:01:45] now it looks like he was surrounded it
[2:01:48] looks like he was by himself it looks
[2:01:50] like it was all hope was gone but right
[2:01:52] there in a Dusty Road in an old drawed
[2:01:54] dry bone of a mule amen there was a
[2:01:57] paradox here there was a god of paradox
[2:01:59] that was him that dried tall bone and he
[2:02:02] said Sampson pick it up and he picked up
[2:02:04] that Jawbone remember said one hit on
[2:02:07] the thick helmets of those Philistines
[2:02:08] should have shattered that dodgeball try
[2:02:11] it's a tongue twister that dried Jawbone
[2:02:14] into a thousand pieces he said but
[2:02:16] instead he whipped a thousand for
[2:02:18] listings with an old brittle Jawbone a
[2:02:21] note watch rubber brim says then he
[2:02:23] turns it from the dry Jawbone of a mule
[2:02:26] Amen to the Jawbone of a Believer and he
[2:02:28] said if God Amen can get on a dead one
[2:02:31] then surely he can get an Irish that's
[2:02:33] alive I'm on Church you're looking for a
[2:02:36] drive you're looking for a paradox it's
[2:02:38] in your jaw Bones tonight it's called
[2:02:40] speak the word welcome
[2:02:43] can we preacher what it's Saturday night
[2:02:45] it's called speak the word and move
[2:02:48] forward come on oh my what are you
[2:02:51] saying I'm saying what a prophet said if
[2:02:53] he can get in the dead one if he can get
[2:02:55] in a dead dry
[2:02:59] Jawbone and whip a thousand Philistines
[2:03:02] then don't tell me that's a god of
[2:03:04] paradox cannot get in this bride and
[2:03:07] take possession of her voice and whip
[2:03:10] every negative devil from here to the
[2:03:12] Mississippi don't tell me that God
[2:03:14] cannot get in this bride and whip the
[2:03:16] demon a pornography don't tell me that
[2:03:18] God cannot get in this bride and whip a
[2:03:21] demon a suicide oh you are an
[2:03:23] irresistible you are a force to be
[2:03:25] reckoned with because the god of paradox
[2:03:28] the god of paradox is only inside of you
[2:03:32] has that ever dawned on you the god of
[2:03:35] paradox is only inside of you
[2:03:39] well y'all just got to forgive me
[2:03:41] tonight because I'm feeling pretty good
[2:03:42] the God of paradox is only inside of you
[2:03:47] what are you saying I'm saying you're
[2:03:49] not alone church
[2:03:50] can I preach here for a second it's time
[2:03:53] to get back in the battle it's time to
[2:03:56] time to put your armor back on time to
[2:03:59] put the Target on the face of that devil
[2:04:01] Time to whip that cancer come to whip
[2:04:03] that depression Time to whip that old
[2:04:05] suicidal spirit
[2:04:09] other than this too hard it's not too
[2:04:11] hard when the god of paradox is in you
[2:04:13] okay tell me it's too hard but tell me
[2:04:16] the truth that God of paradox can't do
[2:04:18] it
[2:04:19] if you're going to say it's too hard
[2:04:21] you're saying the god of paradox which
[2:04:23] is Jehovah cannot perform you're saying
[2:04:26] that he could do it for Noah he can do
[2:04:28] it for Moses he could do it for Samson
[2:04:30] but he can't do it for Poor Pitiful
[2:04:32] Andrew well I happen to be of a
[2:04:34] different lineage and it's not the
[2:04:36] lineage of Ahab it's not the lineage of
[2:04:38] weak Believers but flowing through the
[2:04:40] genes of my body of my spiritual DNA is
[2:04:44] the lineage of Abraham it's the lineage
[2:04:46] of Noah and I'll tell you why their
[2:04:48] names were Immortal tonight is because
[2:04:50] they didn't come up against the trouble
[2:04:52] and say well there's no way it can
[2:04:53] happen but if they stood there and they
[2:04:56] praise God and they praise God oh what
[2:04:58] about it tonight church is there any
[2:05:00] Miracles here tonight is there any
[2:05:02] people here tonight that says oh god
[2:05:04] I've let the devil clot my praise I'll
[2:05:07] let the devil quiet My Worship but it's
[2:05:09] time it's high time to rise up out of
[2:05:12] this condition and start blessing the
[2:05:14] god of paradox if he did it for Noah if
[2:05:17] he did it for Samson well we did it for
[2:05:20] samgar he can do it for you you know why
[2:05:23] because he's not a finite God he's an
[2:05:25] infinite Mighty holy
[2:05:28] he's a living God and he's the god of
[2:05:31] paradox and he's in Faith Tabernacle
[2:05:33] tonight to perform a paradox through
[2:05:36] your redeemed flesh oh somebody Praise
[2:05:39] Him
[2:05:39] [Music]
[2:05:41] somebody praise him I mean I'm not
[2:05:43] talking about a man I'm talking about
[2:05:46] for God of paradox
[2:05:51] well Andrew
[2:05:52] everything's against me everything's
[2:05:55] against me what does it matter what's
[2:05:57] against you when the god of paradox is
[2:06:00] in you
[2:06:03] what does it matter what's against you
[2:06:05] when the god of paradox is in you come
[2:06:09] on Church look at Joshua nature was
[2:06:12] against him
[2:06:16] help me Lord I'm trying to be a good
[2:06:18] church boy
[2:06:20] nature was against him
[2:06:22] nature but son was against him he didn't
[2:06:26] have a light switch Adam done forfeited
[2:06:28] that right he could no longer just stand
[2:06:30] there on his own accord and speak that
[2:06:33] Rod had been forfeited in the garden
[2:06:35] but he stood there knowing who he was
[2:06:39] watching the world turn and the prophet
[2:06:42] said he stopped the world he stopped
[2:06:44] gravitation held it right there and it
[2:06:47] dropped itself he said see what was it
[2:06:49] it was a paradox you say well that was a
[2:06:52] long time ago that is today the same God
[2:06:56] among Church the same God that was with
[2:06:58] Joshua it's with Josiah the same God
[2:07:01] that was with Joshua
[2:07:03] is with Thomas the same God that was
[2:07:07] with Joshua in the valley of angelon is
[2:07:09] with mad that same God is not in a tomb
[2:07:13] in Jerusalem oh God hear my heart
[2:07:15] tonight Church he's in the flesh of his
[2:07:18] bride a moments ain't Noah's Paradox
[2:07:20] this ain't Paul's Paradox this ain't
[2:07:23] Joshua's Paradox this is the bride's
[2:07:25] paradox
[2:07:28] if you say to this mountain be moved and
[2:07:30] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[2:07:32] that what you said will come to pass you
[2:07:34] can have what you said
[2:07:39] that's a promise you can have what you
[2:07:44] said I love what program says that's
[2:07:47] defined nature but you have to have a
[2:07:49] motive and an objective to that that's
[2:07:51] connect with it find out in the word of
[2:07:53] God if it's supposed to be done and then
[2:07:55] God is calling you to do it and it'll do
[2:07:57] it when you know that it's spoken in the
[2:08:00] word to do it then God has called you
[2:08:02] I'm giving you I'm giving you principles
[2:08:04] right here when you know it's that it's
[2:08:07] spoken in the word to do it how many
[2:08:09] knows that it's spoken in the word to do
[2:08:11] it
[2:08:13] three of you do
[2:08:14] how many knows that it's spoken in the
[2:08:18] word to do it he said now watch then God
[2:08:21] has called you to do it
[2:08:24] now let's see those hands now
[2:08:27] it ain't a trick question it's an
[2:08:29] affirmation of faith if it's in the word
[2:08:32] it's his will come over to her some of
[2:08:34] y'all praying about things that you
[2:08:36] ain't got to pray about you know why
[2:08:37] because it's written in his word and his
[2:08:40] word is his will
[2:08:43] when you know it spoke in the word then
[2:08:45] God has called you to do it then it'll
[2:08:47] happen if you're motive and objective is
[2:08:49] right to God that's why Visions take
[2:08:51] place why things are going the way amen
[2:08:54] you have to know that God promised it
[2:08:55] this hour you cannot explain it you
[2:08:58] cannot explain how it happened no man
[2:09:00] can explain how certain things will be
[2:09:03] predicted and never one time fail to
[2:09:06] happen
[2:09:08] it's a paradox but God said to do it
[2:09:11] it's today that's the day we're living
[2:09:14] in what happened the sun Stood Still now
[2:09:18] I've showed you a time but Noah I've
[2:09:20] showed you a top Amen in the Hebrew
[2:09:22] children in a prophet called Daniel in a
[2:09:25] man named Samson now I showed you on in
[2:09:28] a man named Joshua now let's go to our
[2:09:30] Lord let's go to our Joshua the Lord
[2:09:33] Jesus Christ the promise in Jesus when
[2:09:36] he was here on Earth he walked on the
[2:09:39] water
[2:09:41] explain that to me
[2:09:44] I heard me say one the Paradox tapes
[2:09:46] today he said Jesus walked on the water
[2:09:48] he said a man's foot ain't that size I
[2:09:51] thought
[2:09:54] where does the 15 fit
[2:09:59] he said a man walked on the water
[2:10:02] but he said a man's foot wasn't the size
[2:10:04] to walk on the water science could not
[2:10:06] explain it he said watch but it was a
[2:10:09] paradox it's incredible but it's true I
[2:10:13] love this one one day he took five
[2:10:15] biscuits and two fish and fed five
[2:10:18] thousand
[2:10:19] now I'm getting the preaching here can I
[2:10:22] preach a little bit one day he took a
[2:10:25] fish two fish and five biscuits and fed
[2:10:29] five thousand what kind of Adam did he
[2:10:32] turn loose wasn't even wasn't even fish
[2:10:35] alive
[2:10:37] can I break this down the fist they put
[2:10:39] in Jesus's hand was not even alive they
[2:10:42] had already been caught already been
[2:10:45] skinned already been putting cornmeal
[2:10:47] and already been deep fried
[2:10:49] fried catfish
[2:10:51] foreign
[2:10:53] no I'm not starting a Doctrine
[2:10:56] but it's a lot better than that black
[2:10:57] and stuff
[2:10:59] getting old deep fried fish right
[2:11:01] what's not alive when it got in the
[2:11:03] hands of Jesus but he got a hold of it
[2:11:06] and he broke the bread broke off a piece
[2:11:08] of biscuit and when he handed it out
[2:11:10] Tommy got his hand back again there was
[2:11:13] another biscuit there
[2:11:16] come on Church there was a hand holding
[2:11:19] a biscuit and he handed a piece of
[2:11:21] biscuit out to one of the people and by
[2:11:24] the time his hand got back he didn't
[2:11:26] he didn't grab another biscuit whatever
[2:11:29] was in his hand was biscuit making
[2:11:31] material whatever was in his hand was
[2:11:34] fist creating material among church and
[2:11:37] that's the god that's in you
[2:11:39] there was another biscuit there already
[2:11:42] raised the wheat in the field already
[2:11:44] cooked all the grease in it seasoned
[2:11:46] here was a piece of the fish he broke it
[2:11:48] off another piece of the fish cooked
[2:11:50] amen notice this that element is given
[2:11:53] to us
[2:11:56] that element is given to us brother
[2:11:59] Steve I feel like shouting right now
[2:12:02] that element is given to us come on
[2:12:06] Church whatever was in the hand of Jesus
[2:12:09] when he fed five thousand is not in a
[2:12:12] tomb in Jerusalem it's not at the right
[2:12:15] hand of the father on high that element
[2:12:17] is in the flesh of the Bride of Jesus
[2:12:20] Christ what are you saying with Andrew
[2:12:22] I'm saying creation Power by the spoken
[2:12:25] word has returned to the church to
[2:12:28] perform another Paradox listen I'm
[2:12:32] feeling some cold air up here if you can
[2:12:33] turn it off it's going to rip my voice
[2:12:35] that element is given to us if we'll
[2:12:38] just abide in the word stay there I
[2:12:41] believe her on the verge of sin it
[2:12:43] happen live true to the word there you
[2:12:45] are he had cooked fish
[2:12:52] I don't think I'm making this clear
[2:12:54] enough he didn't go race the wheat I'm
[2:12:57] on church he didn't go raise the barley
[2:13:00] he didn't go catch the fish whatever was
[2:13:04] in the fish was in him
[2:13:06] can I say it to you like this before the
[2:13:09] fish was in the water it was in him
[2:13:11] before the bread was in the field it was
[2:13:14] in him before he fed five thousand
[2:13:16] people
[2:13:18] the means to do it by was in him then do
[2:13:21] you see why you're sitting here tonight
[2:13:22] it's because before you was in laodicea
[2:13:26] you was in him before you was in time
[2:13:29] you was in eternity come on Church you
[2:13:32] are the expression of the supernatural
[2:13:34] elements of the living Jehovah what do
[2:13:36] you think it's time to do brother Andrew
[2:13:38] I think it's time to let go and start
[2:13:40] praising and blessing and worshiping and
[2:13:43] glorifying and exalting the god of
[2:13:45] paradox until he comes on the scene and
[2:13:48] performs another one can I say what I
[2:13:51] believe Sister Janet it's not too late
[2:13:54] it's not too late the god of paradox
[2:14:01] that element is not dead that element is
[2:14:04] given to us how do we operate it if
[2:14:07] we'll just abide in the word
[2:14:09] oh abide in the word and you'll see the
[2:14:13] element manifested abide in the word and
[2:14:16] you'll see the bread before it's ever
[2:14:17] cooked
[2:14:19] abide in the word and you'll see the
[2:14:22] fish before it's ever prepared can I
[2:14:24] preach to you abide in the word and the
[2:14:26] Chronicles will be home before you got
[2:14:28] time to welcome them abide in the word
[2:14:31] and your body will be changed abide in
[2:14:33] the word and cancer will leave your body
[2:14:35] abide in the word and some morning
[2:14:38] between six and nine you'll see loved
[2:14:41] ones appear what are you saying about
[2:14:42] Andrew I'm saying the element is not in
[2:14:45] heaven the element is in the bride and
[2:14:47] the Bride is a bride of paradox
[2:14:51] foreign
[2:14:54] look at this word element it's a part or
[2:14:57] aspect of something abstract oh God it's
[2:15:01] a part of something that's abstract
[2:15:03] especially one thing that is essential
[2:15:07] essential
[2:15:10] we can do without music but we got to
[2:15:12] have this element
[2:15:15] we can do without a bunch of fancy
[2:15:17] buildings but we got to have this
[2:15:19] element come on church can I preach you
[2:15:22] tonight we can do without a lot of
[2:15:24] things but the brother Mark but we've
[2:15:26] got to have this element without this
[2:15:28] element it's another building without
[2:15:30] this element this is another Pulpit
[2:15:32] without this element I'm just another
[2:15:34] preacher oh but if that element breaks
[2:15:36] forth if that element comes in the
[2:15:38] church it'll call things that are not as
[2:15:41] though they are it'll call things that
[2:15:43] are as though they're not come on church
[2:15:45] we got situations in our body that
[2:15:48] doctors can't fix but before there was a
[2:15:50] doctor there was an element before there
[2:15:53] was a cancer specialist there was an
[2:15:55] element what was that element it was a
[2:15:57] gene seed word in your soul from the
[2:16:00] foundation of the world
[2:16:03] what are you saying somebody somebody
[2:16:05] help me preach here for a second take
[2:16:07] your foot underneath the Pew and just
[2:16:09] kick it like that
[2:16:11] kick your foot you say preacher what are
[2:16:13] we kicking we're kicking the human
[2:16:15] element out
[2:16:19] Verlander be careful no I can't be
[2:16:22] careful when I hear a prophet say this
[2:16:23] when the human element goes out then the
[2:16:27] spirit of God
[2:16:30] when the human element goes out then the
[2:16:33] spirit of God fills that vacancy oh my
[2:16:36] where they empty yourself then will be
[2:16:39] the church in power of the resurrection
[2:16:41] of the Lord Jesus we will walk in his
[2:16:44] steps we will walk in his power we will
[2:16:47] walk in his thoughts we will walk in his
[2:16:49] being
[2:16:50] we will walk in this movement another
[2:16:52] place we get ourselves worked in with
[2:16:55] the human aim of the time element only
[2:16:56] thing we know is inches feet yards miles
[2:16:58] measurements days weeks hours months and
[2:17:01] years
[2:17:02] but God's Eternal somebody look at your
[2:17:05] neighbor and say the element is eternal
[2:17:08] brother Sean is an eternal ailment it's
[2:17:11] not a time element it's not a it's not a
[2:17:14] metric or imperial element it's an
[2:17:16] eternal element we have limited powers
[2:17:18] we have limited intelligence but our God
[2:17:21] is infinite in all things he knows all
[2:17:24] things he knew all things before the
[2:17:26] world began he oh god this is my this is
[2:17:29] my punch the devil's face he knew this
[2:17:33] meeting would be here tonight come on
[2:17:36] church when he stood there that day with
[2:17:38] the Sean and he fed five thousand he was
[2:17:41] looking ahead in time and he saw this
[2:17:43] meeting on a Saturday night in the house
[2:17:46] of God and there would be some weary
[2:17:47] soldiers there would be some hungry
[2:17:49] hearted Eagles and he said I will anoint
[2:17:51] my servant and he'll go down there and
[2:17:54] he'll preach the Paradox he'll preach
[2:17:56] the element and he'll feed him the fish
[2:17:58] and he'll feed him the bread and they'll
[2:18:00] begin to receive strength and that devil
[2:18:02] that chased them in here brother shamai
[2:18:04] they'll Square their shoulders back and
[2:18:06] say where is that devil anyhow
[2:18:08] where is that a line devil anyhow before
[2:18:11] there was a devil against me there was
[2:18:13] an element in me before there was a
[2:18:15] devil against me there was eternal
[2:18:17] element of God
[2:18:18] [Applause]
[2:18:21] I'll tell you one thing I'm gonna do I'm
[2:18:23] Gonna Knock that discouragement never
[2:18:24] Plumb out this building and you can sit
[2:18:26] there and watch me
[2:18:28] before there was one day with
[2:18:29] discouragement before there was one
[2:18:31] cancer before there was one suicide
[2:18:33] before there was one depression Gracie
[2:18:36] before there was one mind battle there
[2:18:38] was a God who sets High and a God that
[2:18:40] looks low and he's not a weak old dirty
[2:18:42] Grandpa he's a mighty God of paradox
[2:18:45] he's not looking for wood he's not
[2:18:47] looking for stone he's looking for some
[2:18:49] flesh of some human beings he can come
[2:18:52] into and manifest a paradox through
[2:18:55] well somebody Praise Him
[2:18:58] no I'm talking about for God of paradox
[2:19:02] he'll come in and he'll change the
[2:19:05] situation
[2:19:06] [Applause]
[2:19:11] get that human element out of the way
[2:19:14] so we got it mixed up for Christian
[2:19:15] golly element they just get a mess out
[2:19:17] of it remember his word will not
[2:19:21] contradict itself
[2:19:23] his word was not contradict itself what
[2:19:26] are you getting at I'm saying this
[2:19:29] the mystery of a paradox can I am I
[2:19:33] going too long
[2:19:35] a mystery is a scripture previously
[2:19:38] hidden truth
[2:19:40] now divinely revealed
[2:19:44] okay well Amos it's a mystery but now
[2:19:48] it's a revealed truth
[2:19:49] it was divinely revealed
[2:19:52] but which is a supernatural element
[2:19:57] oh God
[2:19:59] Still Remains despite the Revelation so
[2:20:02] brother Tim the Revelation does not
[2:20:05] replace the supernatural
[2:20:08] foreign
[2:20:11] shampoo burning my eyes
[2:20:14] the Supernatural is not replaced by the
[2:20:17] Revelation what is replaced is the human
[2:20:21] element
[2:20:23] what are you saying the part of God said
[2:20:25] God is waiting this afternoon on a
[2:20:27] people that'll take a hold of that word
[2:20:29] and will hold on until it's accomplished
[2:20:33] come on Church they'll hold on to it
[2:20:36] until it's accomplished that which was
[2:20:39] purposed for you you say belinder how
[2:20:42] can I believe this God of paradox let
[2:20:44] this mind be in you that was also in
[2:20:47] Christ Jesus brother Kevin if you're
[2:20:49] going to see the god of paradox we've
[2:20:51] got to lay aside the human mind because
[2:20:53] the human mind sees time numbers inches
[2:20:56] measurements yards weeks day but the
[2:20:59] element of God does not see nothing
[2:21:01] except a promise
[2:21:03] can I can I have some Liberty here as
[2:21:07] long as there are any human injections
[2:21:08] human ideas then God's germ of Life the
[2:21:12] Holy Spirit cannot work how many knows
[2:21:15] in about 1960s the prophet of God goes
[2:21:18] down to a man's house to squirrel hunt
[2:21:19] right he goes down there to a man's
[2:21:22] house of squirrel hunt walks up there

[2:24:32] woman was on the bedpan there was an
[2:24:34] element somewhere before her body become
[2:24:37] cancer-rated there was an element
[2:24:39] somewhere

[2:25:56] and there was the intelligence in his
[2:26:00] front yard what are you saying brother
[2:26:02] Andrew I'm saying the god of paradox is
[2:26:05] not a million miles away he's standing
[2:26:08] here tonight he's right in front of you
[2:26:11] you say Belinda I can't see it I can see

[2:29:35] help me Lord someone has asked many
[2:29:37] times brother Adam are you impressed to
[2:29:39] say certain things do you just think it
[2:29:41] in your mind no sir I see it

[2:30:12] dressed
[2:30:16] the way they're dressed
[2:30:18] one group was dressed like the world
[2:30:20] marching to the step of rock and roll
[2:30:23] but there was another group
[2:30:26] there was a paradox there was a paradox
[2:30:29] she was not marching to rock and roll
[2:30:31] she was not marching to Elvis Presley
[2:30:34] she was marching to Onward Christian
[2:30:36] Soldiers come on Church

[2:30:42] in a vision
[2:30:43] glory to God I feel like dancing before
[2:30:46] you got in time you was a part of an
[2:30:49] eternal vision
[2:30:51] he sent a vision of God is a word of
[2:30:53] knowledge drop it in the person to
[2:30:55] foresee something tell something that's
[2:30:56] been or something that will be what is a
[2:30:59] vision it's something that connects two
[2:31:02] worlds can I say this to you inclusion a
[2:31:05] vision is the direct word of the Lord
[2:31:09] yeah
[2:31:10] Hallelujah
[2:31:12] the vision of the Bride the direct word
[2:31:16] of the Lord numbers 12 6. if there be a
[2:31:20] prophet among you
[2:31:21] I the Lord
[2:31:25] will make myself known unto him in a
[2:31:29] vision and we'll speak into him in a
[2:31:31] dream now I want to I want to labor here
[2:31:33] and I'm done remember I'm sitting out
[2:31:35] for instance sometimes what is a vision
[2:31:36] I'll be at home
[2:31:38] I'll be walking to the house not
[2:31:41] thinking of anything
[2:31:42] maybe sat down in the room and they'll
[2:31:44] come a vision maybe it'll set perfectly
[2:31:47] still for quite a little while he'll say
[2:31:49] now you're going to have a call in a few
[2:31:50] minutes from the phone you're running
[2:31:52] the city and when you go to this city
[2:31:54] you'll go to a certain place it'll be
[2:31:57] this away you'll go in the room and
[2:31:59] you'll lay your hat down or the lady
[2:32:01] will lay your head on the bed but it's
[2:32:03] supposed to lay there
[2:32:07] so once he get up do move it
[2:32:10] it's supposed to be laying over on the
[2:32:12] table and another lady will come in this
[2:32:15] way and you'll see it all acted out just
[2:32:17] exactly the way it's supposed to be done
[2:32:20] if I fell in one of those things it will
[2:32:22] not happen it has to be just exactly to
[2:32:24] the moment
[2:32:27] time this thing down to some morning
[2:32:30] between six and nine has to be to the
[2:32:33] moment to the time everything
[2:32:36] positionally the same for it's a vision
[2:32:39] and it has to be perfectly materialized
[2:32:46] it's a vision has to be perfect with
[2:32:49] your eyes let's go to let's go to a
[2:32:51] place called cupio Finland can we
[2:32:54] one day Birmingham is down in Florida
[2:32:56] has a vision when he has this Vision he
[2:32:59] sees a little boy being killed in the
[2:33:02] vision she's a little boy being hit in
[2:33:05] my car laying down the road and he's
[2:33:07] killed but remember said as I saw this
[2:33:08] he said the Perfect Details come
[2:33:11] I saw his eye color
[2:33:14] I saw his hair color
[2:33:18] I seen the color clothes he had on I saw
[2:33:21] all the details he said and then I heard
[2:33:24] thus saith the Lord
[2:33:28] oh God this Bride is a paradox she will
[2:33:33] not move without this saith the Lord he
[2:33:37] said then I heard thus saith the Lord he
[2:33:41] said now notice from that time he said
[2:33:43] different boys were actually killed and
[2:33:46] kids in car wrecks he said they would
[2:33:48] phone me Sister Janet and they would say
[2:33:50] come down here this has got to be the
[2:33:52] vision he said I would walk down there
[2:33:54] he got to stay with the word remember a
[2:33:56] dove is loyal to their mate
[2:33:59] he said I go down there and look and I'd
[2:34:01] say no no that that's not him that's not
[2:34:04] her he said I will quietly lay my hand
[2:34:06] on him and pray and I would back out of
[2:34:08] the way he said see when I saw in the
[2:34:11] vision had to be in the materialization
[2:34:15] what I saw in the vision had to be in
[2:34:19] the reality he said now watch he said
[2:34:21] when I got over there in Finland two
[2:34:23] years later he said driving down the
[2:34:25] road he said all of a sudden we come up
[2:34:27] on the scene and something speaks in my
[2:34:29] heart and says something is fixing to
[2:34:32] happen
[2:34:34] he said I'll walk down there I looked in
[2:34:37] the road there was a boy he said it was
[2:34:40] a tragic scene and I began to cry watch
[2:34:43] the human element I began to cry I began
[2:34:46] to feel sad he said but then all of a
[2:34:48] sudden
[2:34:49] don't you love those all of a sudden
[2:34:52] moments he said then all of a sudden in
[2:34:54] the back part of my mind oh God where
[2:34:57] else do we hear that in the back part of
[2:34:59] God's mind was his secret mystery he
[2:35:02] said all of a sudden I Heard a Voice say
[2:35:05] you've seen these mountains before
[2:35:08] come on church you've seen them
[2:35:10] mountains before you've seen the trees
[2:35:13] before he said I looked down and I
[2:35:14] realized I've seen this boy before
[2:35:16] Brother Moore go get your Bible
[2:35:20] more go get your Bible read me the
[2:35:23] details Brother Moore begins to read the
[2:35:25] details there was the mountains there
[2:35:27] was the trees there was the boy he said
[2:35:30] I began to look around and say
[2:35:31] everything was positionally placed it
[2:35:34] was now ready for materialization
[2:35:38] can I close tonight by saying this
[2:35:40] church everything is now in position
[2:35:44] according to the vision the god of
[2:35:47] paradox
[2:35:50] the god of paradox is in the church
[2:35:53] tonight the only thing that's going to
[2:35:55] happen brother Sean is the vision
[2:35:59] has got to materialize
[2:36:01] that brother Jordan here's my part
[2:36:04] that I love
[2:36:06] he said I went over there and the boy
[2:36:09] was laying there dead bleeding no life
[2:36:12] in him no breath and he said I knelt
[2:36:14] down
[2:36:15] see nobody could take his place
[2:36:17] he said I knelt down and he said I just
[2:36:20] laid my hand over on him
[2:36:24] and I said
[2:36:27] lying every devil and hell up
[2:36:32] and you won't stop Thomas
[2:36:37] hello
[2:36:38] this is not Noah's Paradox this is
[2:36:42] Terry's paradox
[2:36:43] this is Kevin's line every devil and
[2:36:46] hell up and nothing will stop this boy
[2:36:50] from getting off the ground
[2:36:52] and if he's not up in five minutes you
[2:36:55] put a sign on my back and run me out of
[2:36:57] town as a false prophet he said I laid
[2:37:00] my hand on him and I said in just a few
[2:37:02] moments in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:37:04] Christ I call lies back in this body he
[2:37:06] said and there was a dead lifeless boy
[2:37:09] rose up off the ground
[2:37:12] what are you saying it was a paradox but
[2:37:16] here's the bride's Paradox we were dead
[2:37:19] in sin
[2:37:20] beared in Traditions buried under
[2:37:22] condemnation but for God of paradox come
[2:37:25] on the scene
[2:37:28] thank you
[2:37:29] call our name
[2:37:32] and said get up
[2:37:35] brother Andrew
[2:37:36] I don't think I can believe this you
[2:37:39] were born to believe it
[2:37:43] you were born to believe it
[2:37:44] but Andrew
[2:37:46] I'm not a part of nothing
[2:37:48] I'm just a young person
[2:37:50] going nowhere
[2:37:52] going in circles doing nothing dead
[2:37:55] lifeless no vision no purpose
[2:37:57] how long are you gonna listen that line
[2:37:59] devil
[2:38:02] brother says someday
[2:38:04] I'll be included in that Paradox that's
[2:38:06] coming
[2:38:09] the dust to those prophets lay Yonder in
[2:38:11] the Earth
[2:38:13] and when the dust the martyrs who are
[2:38:15] eaten by lions with the dung of the
[2:38:18] lines were spread across the dust all
[2:38:21] over the Earth I'm reading about your
[2:38:22] paradox
[2:38:23] but yet Christ will raise that body
[2:38:25] again
[2:38:27] it goes to show
[2:38:29] that he is the resurrection
[2:38:33] the god of paradox is in US
[2:38:38] and we
[2:38:39] are in the god of paradox
[2:38:42] let our musicians come tonight
[2:38:44] we
[2:38:46] are in the god of paradox
[2:38:49] brother sister I don't know if you
[2:38:50] believe it or not but I do
[2:38:52] the human element's gone
[2:38:56] this message brother Mark
[2:38:58] finished the element of humanity
[2:39:03] finished it it no longer controls your
[2:39:06] direction
[2:39:06] it no longer controls your praise
[2:39:09] it no longer controls your worship
[2:39:14] how many can say tonight I was thinking
[2:39:16] today people say you know people say
[2:39:18] something about somebody else they'll
[2:39:19] say oh he's just eating out their hand
[2:39:21] they got they got him eating out of
[2:39:22] their hand you ever heard that that
[2:39:24] saying
[2:39:25] I got to thinking but Tim we're
[2:39:28] literally eating
[2:39:30] out of the hand of the son of man
[2:39:33] the human element is out of this hand
[2:39:35] Church
[2:39:36] the human element is out of the hand of
[2:39:38] God
[2:39:39] it's a supernatural element
[2:39:42] I'm gonna I'm gonna read this and I
[2:39:44] promise I'm done
[2:39:45] brother I was talking about the boy in
[2:39:47] John 9 how many members that boy he had
[2:39:49] a paradox right
[2:39:51] the prophet of God said when he took a
[2:39:53] little mud from his hand
[2:39:56] Jesus reached down got a little bit of
[2:39:58] mud right put it in his hands
[2:40:00] he said that he went over and put them
[2:40:03] on the eyes of a man who had never had
[2:40:06] eyes
[2:40:09] showed that man was made from the dust
[2:40:12] of the Earth
[2:40:13] [Music]
[2:40:16] and returned with eyeballs
[2:40:19] and could see the Creator
[2:40:22] that made him
[2:40:31] do you see who you are
[2:40:36] [Music]
[2:40:39] do you see who you are tonight Church
[2:40:42] you're not just human beings
[2:40:44] you're a paradox
[2:40:47] brother Brown says watch he said if God
[2:40:50] don't intend to raise the Dead
[2:40:52] then why did he become flesh like us
[2:40:56] and go back towards the dust and raise
[2:41:00] himself up again why did he raise
[2:41:02] himself up if there's no resurrection of
[2:41:04] the Dead
[2:41:05] oh let us not be children
[2:41:08] but let us be men and women in the
[2:41:11] spirit
[2:41:12] who believed God
[2:41:15] with all their heart
[2:41:20] imagine that brother Amos never had
[2:41:22] eyeballs
[2:41:23] Jesus knew exactly where his eyeballs
[2:41:27] were laying in the dust
[2:41:32] and with the same hand
[2:41:34] that fed five thousand
[2:41:37] Landon went over and picked up a handful
[2:41:39] of dust
[2:41:42] rubbed it in the Man's eyes
[2:41:44] and that hand created eyeballs
[2:41:51] the same hand that never greased one
[2:41:55] biscuit
[2:41:56] never caught one fish but fed five
[2:41:59] thousand the same paradoxical hand
[2:42:04] rubbed in his eyes
[2:42:06] where I roughed in his eyes and he saw
[2:42:09] him for the first time and noticed what
[2:42:11] he saw for the first time he didn't see
[2:42:14] his failures
[2:42:18] he didn't see the rabbi down in the
[2:42:20] temple that was teaching Messiah was
[2:42:22] illegitimate child and there was nothing
[2:42:24] this man named Jesus but when the first
[2:42:27] time his eyes come open he saw his
[2:42:30] creator
[2:42:32] glory to God friends you wonder why
[2:42:35] we're shouting on a weak meeting is
[2:42:37] because God has sent a prophet in this
[2:42:39] age that has taken the word and is
[2:42:42] rubbed it in the eyes in the church you
[2:42:44] did not have eyes to see predestination
[2:42:46] but he gave you some you didn't have
[2:42:49] eyes to see the resurrection but he gave
[2:42:51] you some you didn't have eyes to see
[2:42:53] beyond your past and teenage years but
[2:42:56] he gave you some eyes
[2:43:01] you didn't have eyes to see beyond your
[2:43:03] troubles
[2:43:10] you didn't have eyes to see Beyond The
[2:43:13] Cloud of condemnation but he gave you
[2:43:16] some
[2:43:16] [Music]
[2:43:20] when we stand our feet in
[2:43:24] feet
[2:43:25] oh God
[2:43:27] you didn't have eyes to see
[2:43:31] that you've never done it in the first
[2:43:33] place
[2:43:35] but he gave you some
[2:43:37] [Music]
[2:43:44] you didn't have eyes to see but to be on
[2:43:46] just a certain amount of time you know
[2:43:48] why because the human element only sees
[2:43:51] time in months and years and days and
[2:43:53] weeks and hours
[2:43:54] calendars
[2:43:58] oh I tell you why the devil hates you
[2:44:01] is you got asked to see everything about
[2:44:03] that liar
[2:44:05] God has given you eyes
[2:44:07] to live in an evil age
[2:44:10] surrounded by fiction
[2:44:12] but in the middle of it he's giving you
[2:44:14] eyes to see truth
[2:44:17] and the pride of God said truth shall
[2:44:18] set you free
[2:44:20] how many beliefs tonight
[2:44:22] that element
[2:44:24] of paradox
[2:44:26] is in this building tonight
[2:44:30] listen I realize tonight
[2:44:32] there's there's diseases in bodies
[2:44:40] he's here tonight
[2:44:43] there's diseases and bodies that doctors
[2:44:45] are puzzled to fix
[2:44:48] but there's an element in this building
[2:44:49] tonight
[2:44:50] [Music]
[2:44:54] how many believe she still performs
[2:44:55] paradoxes
[2:44:59] how many kids say Lord
[2:45:01] I'm ready to fulfill the bride's paradox
[2:45:06] listen I realize there's things that
[2:45:08] happen in our past lives in teenage
[2:45:10] years
[2:45:11] that nothing can fix
[2:45:14] the blood can
[2:45:16] there's an element tonight
[2:45:18] that can give you eyes to see beyond it
[2:45:23] say brother Mark all we could see was
[2:45:25] back to the day we come in the earth 424
[2:45:27] 1996.
[2:45:29] brother Junior all we could see was
[2:45:31] physical parents oh we could see Branson
[2:45:34] was physical lineage it's all we could
[2:45:36] see Sister Lisa
[2:45:40] but the god of paradox come in this
[2:45:42] generation
[2:45:43] claims your body
[2:45:46] brother Amos stepped into your flesh
[2:45:49] and give you eyes to stand here and look
[2:45:51] all the way back to the back part of
[2:45:53] God's mind
[2:45:55] and see before you as a sinner you was a
[2:45:58] dollar of God
[2:46:00] before I made one mistake I was perfect
[2:46:03] in the mind of God I'm on church I'm
[2:46:05] talking about a god of paradox
[2:46:07] talking about a god it can give you back
[2:46:10] your sight I know right now maybe all
[2:46:12] you can see is the clouds maybe all you
[2:46:15] can see is this but if you let the god
[2:46:17] of paradox come in the building
[2:46:21] sister came he'll give you eyes to see
[2:46:23] beyond all the sickness
[2:46:24] [Music]
[2:46:29] there's an element 's building tonight
[2:46:33] it's incredible
[2:46:35] but it's true
[2:46:36] [Music]
[2:46:38] there's some flesh here Sister Crystal
[2:46:40] that God has claimed in this generation
[2:46:43] to perform a paradox through it was just
[2:46:45] a few days ago that my wife's sitting
[2:46:47] right back there out in the meeting at
[2:46:49] Ron Spencer's carrying out a little boy
[2:46:51] up in a prayer line
[2:46:52] had a what was that a hernia in his
[2:46:55] stomach
[2:46:56] he's taking the doctor I think stick out
[2:46:58] about that long I mean it was horrible
[2:46:59] to look at Doctor looked at it and said
[2:47:02] well that's actually normal
[2:47:04] and it happens there's millions of cases
[2:47:06] every year but just because it's normal
[2:47:08] don't mean we got to live with it
[2:47:11] how the Paradox is here
[2:47:14] he said now he'll have it for four years
[2:47:16] and after four years if it don't
[2:47:18] hurt me but for God of paradox claimed
[2:47:21] that lady right there to come up in a
[2:47:23] prayer line and say I won't pray over my
[2:47:25] son and we join our faith together right
[2:47:27] there and you look at that boy's belly
[2:47:28] button tonight and there ain't no there
[2:47:30] ain't no hernia there it's incredible
[2:47:32] but it's true
[2:47:34] what are you saying I'm saying the god
[2:47:36] of paradox is in Faith Tabernacle
[2:47:39] tonight he's not coming here just to
[2:47:41] hear us talk about Georgia Carter just
[2:47:43] to talk about what he did for Florence
[2:47:45] Nightingale or William Upshaw not just
[2:47:47] to talk about what he did for Lazarus
[2:47:49] sir what he did for Samson but he wants
[2:47:51] to write a paradox about Martha he wants
[2:47:54] to ride a paradox about Connor he wants
[2:47:56] to write a paradox about Sam you are in
[2:47:59] position tonight for the god of paradox
[2:48:01] to write a paradox out of your flesh
[2:48:05] thank you
[2:48:06] now listen
[2:48:08] I'm gonna open the altar tonight for
[2:48:09] prayer if any hap if anyone has a need
[2:48:13] I believe it's time
[2:48:14] how many agree with me
[2:48:16] it's time
[2:48:19] time for some paradoxes
[2:48:22] listen you said but Andrew
[2:48:24] I don't believe in these prayer lines
[2:48:26] well tell somebody like me that
[2:48:28] who went in a prayer line one night an
[2:48:31] empty vacant void boy and come out on
[2:48:33] the other side full of the Holy Ghost
[2:48:35] [Music]
[2:48:36] listen I ain't got to be hundreds here
[2:48:38] tonight to have a prayer line
[2:48:40] the god of paradox performed a paradox
[2:48:42] in one boy's eyes
[2:48:43] and we're still preaching about it today
[2:48:46] he's in this building
[2:48:50] it's incredible brother Steve
[2:48:53] oh I'm making nervous Devils nervous
[2:48:55] right now
[2:48:57] it's incredible brother Steve but it's
[2:48:59] true
[2:49:01] really Amos it's incredible but it's
[2:49:05] true
[2:49:07] relievers it's incredible that a few
[2:49:09] years ago you and I and sister Lisa
[2:49:11] would meet up in the cold
[2:49:14] frozen tundra Manitoba and preach a
[2:49:17] meeting not in a building in a rented
[2:49:20] hospital room and rent a nursing home in
[2:49:22] a rented room here and stand there and
[2:49:24] fight devils like nobody's business
[2:49:26] young boys sitting there rebelling
[2:49:28] against God
[2:49:30] might as well just preach I'm here
[2:49:31] Hannah it was incredible that we would
[2:49:34] sacrifice ours and study and pray and
[2:49:37] leave there but Amos you made more trips
[2:49:39] there than I did it's incredible it's
[2:49:41] incredible to think about it it's
[2:49:43] incredible me to stand there and sin and
[2:49:45] leave there and think oh God what did I
[2:49:47] accomplish what what was that here that
[2:49:49] I could help
[2:49:50] but the other day I walked out and Kelly
[2:49:52] Hill the branch church and one of the
[2:49:54] boys that sit there and rebelled in
[2:49:55] those meetings met me I was preaching my
[2:49:57] eyes preaching he was on the second row
[2:49:59] pulling with everything within him I
[2:50:00] said there's something different about
[2:50:01] that boy I didn't know who he was you
[2:50:03] know why I didn't know who he was
[2:50:04] because he looked different he didn't
[2:50:06] look like the boy I saw Manitoba in 2016
[2:50:10] and when I walked out the back door he
[2:50:12] said with Andrew I owe you an apology I
[2:50:14] said for what I don't even know you he
[2:50:15] said oh yeah you do he said a few years
[2:50:17] you and brother Amos come over and
[2:50:19] preached a meeting and he said I sit
[2:50:21] there and rebelled and rebelled and
[2:50:22] rebelled he said my brother rebelled he
[2:50:24] said but one day Jesus Christ got a hold
[2:50:27] of my life and he said I'm not the same
[2:50:29] boy he said I've Been Changed he said my
[2:50:32] attitudes changed he said I don't want
[2:50:34] to ask you to forgive me what are you
[2:50:36] saying brother I'm saying the god of
[2:50:38] paradox is back in the church today
[2:50:40] release your flesh release your elements
[2:50:43] release your human body and let that God
[2:50:46] come in your flesh and manifest the
[2:50:48] bride's paradox
[2:50:51] foreign
[2:50:54] you got a chapter in this book
[2:50:57] brother Steve you got a chapter in this
[2:50:59] book
[2:51:01] the bride's Paradox I spare harsh
[2:51:03] together tonight
[2:51:12] will there be one here tonight
[2:51:14] it was saved by the Andrew
[2:51:18] I want to step
[2:51:21] I want to step into this paradox
[2:51:24] will there be one here tonight I can say
[2:51:27] I'm ready
[2:51:29] I'm ready
[2:51:30] I'm not looking for fame I'm not looking
[2:51:32] for a name I'm not looking for publicity
[2:51:35] to be said about me and what God done
[2:51:38] for me to attach my name to something
[2:51:40] I'm ready for a genuine
[2:51:43] paradox
[2:51:47] I'm ready for a genuine
[2:51:50] now listen I know this sounds rational
[2:51:54] but I
[2:51:55] by the word of God
[2:51:58] have done everything I can tonight to
[2:51:59] preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[2:52:02] and to bring the god of paradox
[2:52:04] present in this building
[2:52:07] for this moment right here tonight
[2:52:09] for this moment right here tonight
[2:52:13] [Music]

[2:52:30] that's plagued in your whole life
[2:52:33] it's time for a paradox
[2:52:36] it's time for a paradox
[2:52:39] the brides
[2:52:40] paradox
[2:52:44] it's moving right now
[2:52:49] heard Brothers saying like listen
[2:52:51] heard it quoted
[2:52:53] but Jesus
[2:52:55] Jesus when he was here on Earth
[2:52:57] he would have prayer lines he would hold
[2:52:58] prayer services for people
[2:53:01] [Music]
[2:53:02] now listen it's not Andrew Glover
[2:53:08] it's on my heart tonight
[2:53:11] to tell you this
[2:53:13] he's here to perform a paradox for you

[2:53:23] I I invite you right now just to step
[2:53:26] out of your pewing just to step here in
[2:53:28] this center aisle
[2:53:30] and say Lord
[2:53:31] I'm ready for a paradox
[2:53:34] I'm ready for a paradox we're going to
[2:53:37] pray for you tonight God bless you
[2:53:38] brother
[2:53:39] will there be another one here tonight
[2:53:40] say I need a paradox

[2:53:45] I need a miracle Lord
[2:53:49] he shared a performance
[2:53:51] listen he's here to perform it tonight
[2:53:54] he's here to perform it

[2:54:07] atmosphere
[2:54:08] I believe we've had a week-long meeting
[2:54:10] here that's created an atmosphere for a
[2:54:13] paradox
[2:54:15] let's just consecrate ourselves to him
[2:54:17] right now
[2:54:18] almighty God
[2:54:20] as we come before you right now
