be here in the house of the Lord and and uh looking forward to what God has to say to us today in his word and just good to see everyone amen and uh I know um they're expecting some snow uh but um uh we pray that it holds off till the end of service till we all get home anyways praise the Lord amen and um um if you have your Bibles we would just turn to the Book of Romans and and say uh Happy Birthday to Judah and um it's hard to believe he's 15 years old and uh hether reminded me that I guess it'll be this year he'll be getting his permit so a lot of prayer a lot of prayer and uh but uh anyways we sure love Judah been a great blessing here at the church and and um but uh also we're going to dismiss the communion service uh this evening uh due to the weather and uh don't know what it's going to end up being so we'll try to have it Lord willing next uh next Sunday uh evening and uh that and so as I um said Wednesday we had a a good trip uh in uh in Africa and uh uh the Lord seemed to to move just in a special way and I know it was a um kind of a sudden thing for me of going and uh uh but uh the Lord uh helped us and and uh just uh seemed to uh speak to the people in all the services and they had uh two Services the Friday we got there late late Thursday and they're 8 hours ahead of us and so uh but we got there late and at Thursday night and at the airport and then had to drive a good hour or so to the hotel so we didn't get you know to bed probably till 2: um and then um the next day in the afternoon is when the service started so uh they had two services Friday and then four Services uh Saturday and Sunday and the first service started at 6 and um and these were full-blown Services these ain't just little you know 40 minute sessions you know these were full-blown services and and the people I mean they they pulled every service it was um incredible they they they love the Lord and and I know they were re tired but um they they were ready to have church so uh anyways we uh seen some results out of it a young man um he um uh he wanted my number as we were leaving the last service and so I'd given it to him and he had asked um later on he said who's William brandham and um so I said you've never heard of brother brandham he said no he said it's my first time at the at the the the meeting and uh said oh okay so uh uh I didn't say anything else and he said I really want to know I want to know who brother brandham is or who William brandom is and so um we've been discussing back and forth and and send him a bunch of scriptures to read and um so just praying that something will Enlighten him I've helped him download The Table app and he's been listening to some of the sermons that I've asked told him to listen to and and so just believing God to to do something in that young man's life and um uh different different uh testimonies um the young man that um uh he was um well in in the last uh couple services we we had a young man driving us back and forth to the hotel to the meeting and and um that last service you know after after the last service he just cried and um as we were going to the hotel and um we went and ate with the pastor the next day Monday and that young man was there and another young man and anyway the the the the young man the driver he he had went out to answer a phone call and the pastor say you know that that young man right there he says God's done something to him he said uh he said I'm about giving up on him and uh he said he's just hard and he said I've worked done all I know to do and he said I've just about just you know told him I I can't do anything for him and uh he said but when he come home or dropped you all off and he come picked us up he said that that young man cried and cried just all the way you know home and he said he's changed there's something about him that's really changed and uh so we're thankful for the Lord uh for these things and believing that God's still working among his people amen uh but uh Romans the 8th chapter and the um 16th verse uh let's see here it's actually um I have got the wrong uh scripture down amen I'm going to have to look up in my concordance um and maybe some of you would know the scripture where it says the just shall live by faith maybe uh um praise the Lord well isn't the Lord good praise the Lord ABC DF G look at my concordance here and uh for some reason I thought I had it down and um what is it R Romans 117 all right let's look at that then praise the Lord yep so let's start at uh Romans 1:16 it says for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith as it is written the just shall live by faith amen could we just bow our heads in a word of prayer father we're so thankful that we have your promise that we can rest upon it Lord thank you for bringing us here safely father and we're under expectation for you to be with us to speak to us us and not only just to speak but Lord your creative power to affect us Lord you see every need that is present and I pray that you would meet every need Lord build our faith up higher Lord father may we come under a greater expectation for you to fulfill your word we ask it father in Jesus Christ's name amen you can have your SE seats I um I've been trying to uh uh recuperate and uh I don't think we got too much sleep when we were up there and and so anyway um fighting a whatever and uh so it's whatever I've been fighting it's put me in bed for a couple days but um we uh believe in the Lord just to help us but um so the just shall live by faith and I guess if if I got a title it would be thee and thy house shall be saved and um um you know faith is is the the foundation of our life of the Christian walk as you know as the prophet would tell us we are to choose by faith we when we come to the house of God we come by faith we when we worship we worship by faith that's that's the way we are to worship we are to uh sing by faith we are to testify by faith we are even to amen the word by faith everything is by faith and living by faith isn't something new uh yet it does seem strange especially in the age that we're living in because it's um it's harder than any age for people to live by faith uh because it's already been predicted that that Faith would be slow in this age and the reason why it's slow is brother rown said we've had so much scientific teaching and um so much scientific teaching and uh he says we have drawn the people away from faith and and so and and because of this uh the Supernatural is hidden from the people because science science and education does not produce the supernatural uh it it looks to reasoning it looks for proof it looks for natural things and and so uh it has kept the supernat away from the people and it's drawn the people away from faith and so uh uh brother Brown says Divine Healing today is not for the unbelievers it's for those who believe see the baptism of the Holy Spirit today is not for unbelievers it's for those who believe Jesus died for believers not for unbelievers it's for those who believe the supernatural follows who Supernatural minded that's right when the hungering and thirsting see when you you got an expectancy when you read God's word and expect to see God perform what he said he would do God will do it can you say that with me God will do it and and so then if you have faith then then you'll be Supernatural minded and will expect the supernatural to happen so that's why we get away we must get away uh uh the the message is to get us away from scientific things and from our reasoning and get us back to a true faith in God so that the supernatural can work in our lives you see all hell is against this message uh how many believe that amen it's it's against the message and that's what brother Bri said it's it's against the truth and and because uh um um it's uh it's it's it's the thing that God has established that if we could ever ever believe in that's that's the channel that God can work through and and so he's against it and and and so if he's against the message then all hell is against us who believe the message is the truth and and it's because that you are believing the right thing and so we we feel the pressures we we see the things that are are are going on around us and God is or Satan is trying to do everything he can possible to keep the promises of God from being effective in your life and that's just the truth uh um and we must realize that it to to to to look at the mountains to look at the trials to look at the obstacles in our life and to think that God is sending them our way to destroy us that's the wrong way to look at things uh uh uh but if we could look at it that it is Satan doing his best to keep the word of God from being effective in our lives it's Satan that is trying to keep us from being true Sons and Daughters of God but yet it's it's it's giving us an opportunity to exercise our our Authority as Sons and Daughters of God so all hell is against this message because it's the truth and and and this message is what has awakened uh us up the bride up and and we know that uh we're not waiting to be awakened the the the the the message has awakened this bride this message according to uh Ezekiel uh his vision uh is the fourth stage of the restoration of of the Valley of the dry bones and uh uh it's a message of life and this message is what put life in US amen so we aren't some insignificant downtrodden people amen uh and we if if you're thinking that way then you're not catching the revelation of this message because the message has not uh has has has made us realize the truth of what we are we're not going to be sons of God we are sons of God now amen we're we're not going to make it we've already made it amen and and so if we could look at it uh uh we're we're we're not just some uh insignificant people and the message has made us realize this truth and not only has it made us realize the truth but it has changed our thought pattern to where we don't think like insignificant downtrodden people we we don't let Just smudy Thoughts come into our mind and dwell on them and you know I I understand we can get complexes and we can get all kinds of things in our life life and but but the message cleans a lot of this stuff out and and to where we can look at who we are based upon the word of God Amen now and and I hope just to make some sense to you today but the prophet said Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts now if you look at the book of Acts they were a powerful people uh they done signs and wonders and in so much that that uh uh they said that these men turned the world upside down and and and just at the the the shadow of Peter Crossing uh over uh the sick uh they they were healed and and Devils cast out the lame walked and and and and you know the the the the the the story of the of the acts well Christ in the true church today is a continuation of the book of Acts can you say Amen now the prophet says now Satan knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army can you say Amen see the true Revelation comes from the message of the hour amen and it's not just listening to the the tapes with the hearing of our uh natural ears but it's it's God revealing to us the Revelation lays in in the word the Revelation lays in the message and and if we could really get it down in our heart then what what what is the revelation of this message we can quote quotes we can we can show our spirituality and and and and you know uh uh uh can get where we just debate one another with quotes and scripture and all this thing but that don't mean anything we need the true revelation of the true church amen and and and how many believes you're part of that true church well I believe that by one Spirit you're you're baptized into one body the true church and and so if if we could get a revelation of the true church what she is what you are see and what you stand for and that you can do the Great G works can you say amen yeah amen you can do the Greater Works then you'll be an invincible Army amen that's right amen so you got to put yourself in there and if he says if they can if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand that Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her so this is what God done by sending us the message message is to get us a true revelation of what you truly are you are part of this church you are the true church then you must have that revelation of what you are what you can do that you can do the Greater Works that you're not the victim you're the Victor that you don't have to nut down to the devil Satan will be rendered powerless before you if you can really have that true revelation of Who You Are now you know the other day just thinking of situations that I need the Lord to change and uh you know that's just weight on my heart for for a while you know and and um and while riding on the plane back home I I just got to thinking about these things and uh uh the situations and just began to weep uh before the Lord just um asking him to change what what would seem to be impossible situations and and things and you know you you just reach a a feeling of helplessness to do anything about it you know and and um but but as I was just thinking there and praying and and um it it just I was just reminded of where Jesus said all things are possible to them that believe how many believes that all things are possible so he doesn't he doesn't categorize situations one to another he just says all things are possible to them that believe so you can't measure the impossibilities uh and you can't rate situations and circumstances all things are possible to them that believe and so what what would seem so impossible uh uh then we find that if if I can believe amen then then it's no longer impossible it becomes possible because I can believe for it you you understand what I'm saying and so then then the situation is not hopeless because of Faith so then the prophet would say in one place if the doctor says you're going to die with a Cancer and that's all he knows about he said or he said that's all he knows about have faith everybody say have faith now we preach Faith all the time but you you can't you can't underestimate Faith you you can't there there's just no way you can over overdo Faith amen because if the doctor says you're going to die with the cancer that's all he knows about have faith and it'll change the situation for you see in another place Jesus in his church today would be just as powerless as your faith is now think of that uh the creator of Heaven and Earth and and the Bible says he's the same yesterday today and forever so the god that wrote back the Red Sea the god that changed water into wine the god that that multiplied The Fish and Loaves the god that walked on the sea and and the god that that looked at the the the waves and the winds and and said peace be still and it all obeyed him at his voice at his words that God would be just as powerless as your faith is amen and yet just as powerful as your faith is he'd be limited to whatever God would tell him to do that he could do see so so your faith can make God powerless in your life it doesn't mean it doesn't change his Essence it doesn't change his nature it doesn't change his ability but it stops him from having a a Divine work in in our lives when we can't believe God for everything see see so so God put us here and and he allows things to come our way not to defeat us not so we could just be broken and and destroyed and Shipwrecked he he puts it there so he can show himself that he's still the same God that can speak to the storm he's still the same God that could speak to the mountain he's still the same God but he wants to take your voice to do it on now so God is God is able to show him strong himself strong in our behalf by our faith and and so now brother brm said God hates a powerless religion he hates it and and if you want to see a powerless religion look at all the the the Christendom today with denominations or any other religion it's a powerless religion and and any religion today that hasn't got Christ in it is poweress he says and and and so then if he hates a poweress religion then why would God choose us select us predestinate us for this age amen and yet we can't have that ability Amen to produce a living God Among Us see so so then then then he he wouldn't waste his time in that but knowing that you would believe knowing that that you would take him at his word he's not worried about losing you he's not worried about you know the Satan been able to snatch you away from him he he predestinated you for this age see and and so now you cannot have fa a man cannot have faith if he doesn't believe in the Supernatural because God is Supernatural do you believe that so so to have faith in God you have to believe in the Supernatural amen see and the only way for any man to approach God Is by faith for the Bible says he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him ain't that right now notice what brother brand says if we lose faith if we lose faith and we will never get a prayer answered by God our prayers are ened and we will get nowhere ain't that right now listen church you can lose money and that ain't going to affect your prayer it ain't going to affect the power of your prayer you you can lose your your materialistic things and that will not affect the power of prayer but if you lose Faith then your prayer becomes powerless before God can you say Amen so we we find that we must have faith don't ever let the devil take away your faith don't ever look look look at the mountain as as being too big like like those uh uh that come back from from the promised land the 10 spies and they saw the Giants and they saw the wall cities and they saw the obstacles and and because they saw that and become more of a reality than the promise then they couldn't see the Promise anymore amen and they explained every reason why they couldn't take that Promised Land amen see and and God was done with them God God was finished with them they they wouldn't believe a prophet They didn't accept the message amen and and so when the obstacles were standing there before them they didn't have the faith to say you know what that giant is is good as de amen because of the promise of God do you understand but there was a Caleb and Joshua that stood there and said we're more than able to take the land we're more than able they didn't look at the they didn't look at the the the obstacles they didn't look at all these things they kept their eyes upon the promise they believed they wouldn't let that negative report take away their faith ain't that right now the prophet said faith is not proved by science faith is is what science doesn't see Faith sees what science doesn't see so if you're trying to prove things by science you know and and and again this is where the doctors they rely upon their scientific discoveries and their machinery and all of these things and and and by science they're giving you a report and it may be true and you may even have the Sy that that verify that what he's saying is the truth but there is a faith in God's word that can change that situation in the days of Noah science couldn't see the rain that was coming amen but Noah by faith could see the rain before it ever got there you believe that science couldn't see a virgin girl bearing a child but by faith the prophet Isaiah saw it happening amen see by faith faith saw it different than what what science would would be able to say so brother Bram said if we ever lose this great faith then we are totally in darkness see if we ever lose Faith there's no hope for us so you must we are believers don't don't look don't look for other outside s resources look to Faith Can you say Amen keep faith faith is better than anything that you could ever have see if we ever lose this great faith then we are in total darkness because now you're totally helpless amen and what seems to be uh uh overwhelming will be overwhelming what seems to be there to overtake you will overtake you if you ain't got faith see he says see so if we ever lose this great faith and we are totally in darkness no matter how well we are educated and how we could explain the word of God to suit our own way of believing see you you you you got to have that Faith so living by faith has always made the believer uh an odd person to those that that are around him uh because he or she doesn't see what the others are seeing uh they their perception is totally different yeah the UN you know uh the carnal man just sees the mountain the believer doesn't see the mountain that's right the the the the carnal man sees the impossibilities the believer sees the possibilities uh uh their their Vision their view of things are are totally different and it's not mind over matter it's not positive thinking we're talking about faith can you say Amen now all the heroes in the Bible live by faith and and in other words they just simply believed uh whatever God said they just believed it and and they you know and so by faith they accomplish things and endure things that a normal man could not do they accomplish they they they done you know brother Bram said you know anything that Moses done was worth that was worth repeating was done by faith and not by sight amen think of that so if we lose faith then all of our hope is gone ain't that right brother brandham said if we lose Faith all our spiritual reality is gone now you know I I may be just just scattered a little bit but that's okay if we lose Faith all our spiritual reality is gone then then that means you cannot see something different you you'll not see Victory you'll see defeat that's right you you you'll not see yourself in in in in uh uh the promises of God you'll just see yourself in the present condition of what you are in you you you you'll not see it so if we lose Faith then all our spiritual reality is gone you you'll not see God you you you'll not see him as present you'll you you'll not see the promises as a reality because the spiritual reality uh uh is is gone you you'll lose that spiritual reality because faith is that super sense right amen see so you cannot have faith in things that you see the prophet says for the things that you see are all perishable so then by faith we look at things that cannot be seen by the natural eye ain't that right that's why yeah down Through the Ages they they the the Bible says by faith you know they they saw the promises of God were persuaded of them and embraced them why because they done it by faith they could see it before it ever happened see so so we look at things that we cannot see and we do not see them by our imagination it's not just something you know you're coming into the imagination station you know uh uh or whatever see but but we look at the word of God we look at the word of God and see what God is promised and by faith we believe it am we see it happening can you say Amen we see the word happening therefore no matter what situation you're in you're not in despair because you're seeing something that is different than what you feel you're seeing something different than what your symptoms are saying you're seeing something different than what the situation is around you you're looking at the Unseen Promises of God that's right the Bible the prophet said is God's word in seed form and then he says in another place every seed will bring forth of its kind do you believe it this this Bible is God's word in seed form amen and and every seed will bring forth of its of its kind so he says if you need salvation the seed's here if you need healing here's the seed in the word the word of God is a seed put it in your heart don't dig it up every morning to see if it's sprouted put it in there and leave it there can you say Amen it's God's business to bring forth the Harvest that's right you believe that can you say that with me it's God's business to bring forth the Harvest it's God's business to fulfill his word it's God's business to take care of you you believe it it's God's business to bring forth the Harvest you just leave it there now notice what he says water it by faith and praise every day thanking God for it so that's where our faith is faith without works is dead so our our works is is not trying to make it happen our works is praising God and thanking God Amen for the answer you're watering it with your praise ain't that right not falling in despair oh I've waited for so long I've waited for an hour and it ain't happening yet you water it with praise true well I've been believing for 10 years keep watering it with with praise faith never wavers that's right Noah 120 years and his faith never wavered Abraham waited 25 years and grew grew weaker in his body and more frail but the promise become more alive each day he grew stronger in faith see and so he never wavered in his faith see so now you know by faith we believe that some glorious day amen that God is going to call us from the earth though we be just a spoonful of dust right and and we don't fear the days because we know by faith that that that God is going to honor that word watch the believer when he goes down there there just something that you know on the deathbed or whatever there's just a peace in his heart you know uh been been around a few that that that have passed on just Christians and there's just a peace in their heart knowing that that that God is true that God is faithful what is it it's by faith see everything that we're doing is by faith can you say Amen now God doesn't ask us to prove prove his word he just ask us to believe it so it's not up to you to have the answers it's up to you just to believe it that's right you may not understand it may not know how you just believe it God is going to fulfill that word come on Amen can you say Amen see so now the critics want us to prove the Bible but we don't have to prove it we just believe it find out that uh uh critics even if you try to prove the Bible they ain't going to believe it anyways if it ain't in them to believe it just ain't in them to believe so we're not here spending our time trying to prove this Bible God's already proved it the message of the hour we're just simply believing we're simply resting can you say Amen now if if if we're not Believers then then what what is it the world's going to the spirit of the world is going to catch us and we're going to be negative we're going to be negative people talk negative think negative act negative everything is a negative atmosphere ain't that right amen where we just can't see our way out we can't see anything it's just when we're in Gloom we talk Gloom when we're you know we just become a roller coaster but there's got to be something that anchors and the only thing that can anchor is the word of God Amen and that's our faith ain't that right see and so we believe it and we believe because God's word is eternal and will never change we believe that he is the same yesterday today and forever so then whatever he done back in the day he can still do it today which makes our situation not an impossible situation it makes everything possible if we can just believe and we believe him because he's here to fulfill his word how many believes he's here to fulfill his word now what good is a historical God that's right of yesterday if he's not here today that's right brother brah said what good it does it do as to read what God did through Moses if he doesn't do that today what good does it do is to read how God delivered the children of uh the Hebrew children from the fire if he's not the same God today what good is a God that would judge between right and wrong in a day gone by and punish the wrong and bless the right if he isn't the same God today why do we come to church and abstain from the world if he isn't the same God of judgment today what good would it be to serve a God who could call his friend from the grave in a day gone by and yet he can't do it today you understand what I'm saying you see how ridiculous it would be for us to come to church and worship God and read from this Holy Bible and and then he not be the same God you with me if he's not the same God then our faith is in vain our rejoicing is in vain Our Testimony is in vain everything that we're doing is in vain but we believe that he is the same and it may be ridiculous to the world but it's not ridiculous to the believer amen so we do not question whether he is or not and we're not stepping out on a limb by Believing on him you are in the safest position when you are believing him can you say Amen so the believer is at rest and we are under full expectation for God to fulfill his word ain't that right now in the story of Moses we can see that a unbeliever can look at the same thing that a Believer does and get a totally different view of of than than what a Believer sees it's just like when the prophet talks about when Pharaoh looked at the children of Israel all he saw was mud dobers all he saw was slaves he just saw Misfits he saw worthless people that's what Pharaoh saw when he looked at Israel but when Moses saw the children of Israel he he didn't see any of that he saw a people of Promise he saw a people that had a bright future yet they were slaves yet they they were in bondage but he didn't see that he saw the the word he saw what God said about them he saw that they were a covenant people can you say Amen see so so then by faith he stood with them by faith and it brought them out of the condition by faith see so we find you know brother bradam said you know when Moses saw the great ditches in their face and the tears that run down their cheeks and their bent bodies he looked upon them as the people of God he didn't look at them upon them as slaves now I'm getting to a point here but he looked upon them as the chosen people of God that's how we want to look at one another is through faith we all have failur and we all deal with things in our life that seem to be impossible but when by faith we look at each other we see a promise right we want to see a promise and and and this is how we we want to look at our even at our children we we don't look at the situation they're in we look at the promise hello yes sir that's right see CU we're not a people that are to despair we are not a people that to fall apart situation going to come and go but the word remains and so when when the situations change and they go from the worst or whatever there must be something to Anchor our our faith in and that's the word of God so we're looking at a promise brother brand says I know we all you know think our you know uh we all want to think our children as Renegades and things like that but we must stop that can you say Amen we must stop that he said I believe that we must remember that these kids are the best kids in the world because there our children and we claim them for God how me claiming your children for God see see the the the it's by faith we're we're living by faith right so don't see them as lost don't see them as so far gone see them as saved hello amen you say can that be well yeah it can be let me ask you how do you see yourself come on right well I'm a Christian good well what what makes you say that and as a Christian how do you see yourself well I just don't know if I'm going to make it well then you ain't got the faith yet because by Faith you've got to see yourself as there you your your whole your whole your whole situation your whole Christianity is based upon faith not feelings but by faith by faith I'm going to make it then then what what do you base your worship on when we come to the church church and we're here in worship our is our worship just I shall not be I shall not be moved I shall not be I hope I'm not moved you know it it it's by faith so so you're not judging your worship and and and raing your worship based upon your feelings you're you're basing everything by faith you see yourself in the promise you see yourself the way God sees you remember this Bible is a mirror right it's what Paul says it's a mirror and were beholding his glory his glory well when you look in a mirror who are you looking at amen you're not looking at somebody else you're seeing you but when you're looking here you're seeing yourself the way the word sees you way God sees you as that's the only way Moses could look at the children of Israel differently than what Pharaoh Pharaoh didn't know the promise Moses knew knew the promise he was taught the Promise by his mother can you say Amen so he couldn't look at the children of Israel any other way than what God said they are that's right can you say amen that's right and so if if that faith if so by faith you live by faith not by the way you feel not by the way the doctor says you are not the B by the way anybody else said you live by faith the way God says you are well if you get you then you see yourself the way the word says you are quit looking at your failures quit looking at your inabilities quit looking at everything else and look at the word of God base your worship on the word of God base your experience on the word of God base your testimony on the word of God and you do it by faith whether you feel it or feel like it or whether you see it or you don't see it you already see it in God's promise well then that's the way you got to look at your children don't see them as lost see them as saved don't see them as being Beyond hope see them as delivered that's right see them as set free come on church I just asked you this if you don't have faith for your children children where does it leave them doctor says okay you're going to die okay if you don't have faith in God's word where does that leave you then you're in a you're just hopeless then the spiritual realities of God are gone yes sir there's nothing God can do to help you right if you don't have faith for your children then what does it leave them now the Bible says the children are inheritage of the Lord do you believe it in other words there are inheritance now if if we don't have faith then they have no future they have no hope hello so we see the power of darkness in what it does we know what it does we're looking at the world maybe some of you even have children that are just lost and and they're being affected by the powers of of of Satan to where it just looks you know just impossible Satan has a way to make even make our children look like freaks just make them look like they're just like what planet did you just fall off from and that's the power of darkness and we see that's right what Darkness does but we also see the power of faith and what faith does there is no situation I'm and I you know I may be rambling but that's okay there is no situation that's impossible when you got faith can you say Amen now we know that the power of faith is superior to the power of Darkness that's right look at the things that the Believers did by faith uh by faith uh Joshua called the sun to stand still by faith Moses spoke the creative word and brought things into existence by faith Noah preached and built an ark and floated above the Waters of Destruction by Faith Sarah re received strength to have a son by faith she and Abraham was turned back to their youth Again by faith it's all by faith right by faith David defeated Goliath and and and all of these things are totally impossible to be done just by carnal man his strength his knowledge you understand that but yet it happened by faith it happened through men to Men by faith right yes sir it did so if you're seeing things as hopeless then you're not living by faith God help us to live by faith not faith in our abilities that's not the right Faith you're not putting your faith in the right place Faith must be on the word the word of God sir ain't that right see so then faith is powerful it's the only only way that we can see the impossible become possible now I just notice the the the power that faith has and I'm not going to keep you much longer but you all remember the I think it's the Philippian Jailer Paul and Silas was thrown in prison for preaching the gospel and Paul had cast out a demon of a fortune telling Spirit out of a girl and uh the man who owned her was upset cuz she could know no longer uh tell people's fortunes and so they threw them in prison and brother brandham describes their situation pretty pretty bleak situation that Paul and them were in and they they didn't know you know as far as they knew they were going to be executed the next day and they were in stocks and brother Brown talks about you know how that their head was in you know you've seen it I'm sure their their head was in in in uh uh a block you know and their hands and their feet were were there and they can't move and their their backs are bloody and you know bugs probably crawling on them and mice and rats and all that so it was a a an impossible situation and yet they began to sing songs and they begin to testify of the Lord and they did this by faith and and as they began to testify and sing then then Earth God sent an earthquake y'all yall remember it and and and uh the chains were broken and things and brother BR said the Geller must have heard them singing and testifying and it struck a cord in his heart that these men are holy men they're right men they're they they're not talking of gloom and doom they they got a peace in the situation they there just something about them that they know that that that they're not falling apart and and so he was going to kill himself because he knew that he was going to get executed if any of the prisoners had had gotten free and Paul saw him and quickly said don't don't don't we're all here every everybody's accounted for and the man fell at his at their feet and said what must I do to be saved and Paul didn't give him a whole list of what not to do uh but gave him what he must do and the prophet said we spend too much time focus upon what people shouldn't do and not what they must do and Paul simply said believe everybody's believe believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and notice and thee and thy house think of that by his faith thee and thy house shall be saved that's powerful right and so you know what an easy thing don't have to beg don't have to plead don't have to worry fret whatever just believe simply believe take God at his word ain't that right now brother bradam said see what we need today is not pray for more power now notice this you got enough power to make a new Earth think of this yes amen he's he's taken our negative thinking about ourselves away taking all that negative feelings and whatever that Satan puts upon us and he's telling us you've got within you power to make a new Earth what you need is Faith to use that power what you need is control that life and live such a Godly life that when you ask God anything you know right see th this is why it's so important that that we live right lives keep keep everything under the blood amen get get get you know keep sin out of our Lives because you're going to need that power with God Amen so he said you've got enough power to make a new Earth what you need is Faith to use that power what you need is control that life and live such a Godly life that when you ask God anything you know we have confidence in God of that see we know if we keep his Commandments he'll hold withhold no good thing from us if we walk with him and God walking with us can you say Amen so in another place brother Brown said did you know that that that the power of Resurrection your the power for your own Resurrection is inside of you think of that you have your own Resurrection inside of you see if a person if a person is predestinated then then that that individual already has what he needs just trying to get it to you you already have inside of you what what you have need of it's already within you just like Jesus was a predestinated seat of God you believe that his whole life was predestinated he was predestinated to rise from the grave do you believe that he said that he had the power he wasn't waiting for power he had the power to lay down his life and to pick it up again so the power of Resurrection was already in him he wasn't just predestinated to go down in the grave he was predestinated to rise again and you are predestinated to rise again see God ain't going to finish you halfway through the story and he ain't going to allow the devil Amen to take you out halfway if you're predestinated you're going to go all the way if he's Justified you that's great but look at the other part he's already glorified ified you he called you predestinated for ordained you and now he's already glorified you how can he stop you how can Satan stop you it's already done and the power is within you Hallelujah can you say Amen so now notice he had the power to lay down his life and power to take it up again it was already in him and brother Brown said each one of you have the power the same way because you are Sons and Daughters of God and the Very Spirit that's in you this morning the Holy Spirit that's in you this morning that same holy spirit will raise you up so you have the power to raise yourself back up hello so what's operating that power faith faith in God's wordl ain't that right see he says you have the power in you in you now to do that but that power that you have in you now could make a new world see God doesn't have little weak spots and big heavy spots that's powerful the least little touch of God is omnipotent the least little touch of God can you say Amen so so now if you look at it for a moment look what faith has already done for you how many believes you've changed since you given your heart to the Lord you change you're not the same person how did that happen now just just go figure how did that happen when your friends are still out in the world or you know whatever I I know of people that have tried and tried to quit drinking tried and tried to quit smoking they tried to quit different things of the world habits and yet here we are we were in all of that and and in some way or form or fashion maybe it just religion or whatever but we've risen but how did we do that by faith it it wasn't something there but but something special out out whatever but you were a predestinated seed and it was already in you amen for these things to happen see and and so brother Brown said you used to live in the muck of sin and drinking gambling all things of the world but as soon as you believe that Christ forgave you of your sins you Rose above those things now you're now riding above it ain't that right well how how can you do that can you rise above it you know why cuz you believe you're a Christian how many believes you're a Christian now the moment you stop believing that you're a Christian is the moment you're not a Christian the moment brother Brown said the moment you you say you're not saved is the moment you're not saved so everything is by Believing by Believing by Believing by believing you're possessing Heaven by believing you're possessing the Rapture by believing everything is by believing you believe that and see this is what's uh magnificent I think about the message it's bringing us under the headship of the word to where we're not confused and we're not listening to this one and we're not listening to this voice we're under one headship and that's the word of God and whatever he says I believe it I live by it I confess it yes sir brother Braham said when you accepted Christ and the Holy Spirit came to you then you have faith in the Holy Spirit to give you power to ride above that kind of life of sin see so then God wouldn't have placed a a predestinated seed in you and then not give you Faith to access every promise of God right why why would God give you that Faith why or why would God give you predestinate you to the promises of God and you can't live it you can't obtain to it and we just sitting here just so weak and beggarly and just wishing and just and it's just like God waving the promises like the carrot before the you know before the donkey and just like well that's not the point you you we're missing Christianity see every promise is to be had and is accessible by faith can you say Amen so every promise that God made is in you already to possess brother Braham says in the Church of the Living God this morning lays the power to heal all sickness in the Church of the Living God lays power to overcome all Temptation in the possession of the Church of the Living God this morning lays the power to change sin and throw it away and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the Church of Jesus Christ whatsoever you desire everybody say whatsoever I desire see whatsoever you desire ask in my name and it shall be given to you a little while in the world see see not the seed but the unregenerated seed that world will not will see me no more yet you'll see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world what the Royal seed and the works that I do shall you do also I'll verify myself that I'm with you for these signs shall follow them that believe he shall possess the seat of his enemy he shall possess the Gate of his Enemy No matter what the gate is if it's sickness Temptation sin whatever gate it is it's conquered do you believe it another place everything that you have need of in this journey is in you right now yes sir the only thing you have to do is have faith in God that pushes that good things out of you which is in You by the Holy Spirit see so if you want to write higher into healing just have more faith right brother brah said just keep pushing it out and there you are see now he says if a person is not sick or is not a Christian and he's sick then he needs to become a Christian right now so that healing power will come into you by becoming a Christian and and that will give you Faith to right above sin it'll give you the faith can you say Amen so if you notice amen Paul would tell this Roman Centurion have faith just believe and it'll not only affect you but it'll affect your children as well so that that tells us that Faith your unsaved child can be saved by your faith I hope that helps you today and you say Amen see when they can't believe for themselves God has given you that privilege to stand there with faith claiming them a child or a father had brought his child for pretty bad it was sick pretty bad and he had brought it the child to Jeffersonville for prayer and Billy Paul had told brother brandham says the the child needs so brother brandham didn't get to see the the child before service but as he's preaching he tells the father he said now your faith will have to go for that child if it's a little infant child say if they can't believe for themselves then you've got to have that faith for that child right and your faith will affect that child your faith will will will cause healing to come to that child and you sayen so this is the same thing that Paul was saying to that Phil Philippian Jailer have faith believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thee and thy house shall be saved now Paul wasn't saying that the man's salvation would save his his household but brother Bram says but if he's got enough faith in God for his own salvation then he can have the same faith for his house and his house have to come in it's the same thing hello amen see so you're not believing a myth you're believing a promise can you say Amen you're believing that the blood of Jesus Christ is not only for you but it's also for your household and this is exactly what job did remember per Adventure he had he didn't know if his children had sinned or not but per Adventure they had sinned he offered a burnt offering on their behalf and he began to pray for his children brother Brown said he did it just in the right time just Before Destruction came and you all know what happened he lost everything and he lost all of his seven children and and and they were you know his critics were saying job you're a secret sinner or this stuff would have happened and and the job would would tell them though but I'm not a sinner I've answered God's requirement I'm standing as a righteous man because of the sacrifice can you say amen amen and when it was all said and done God restored everything back to him double fold and God gave him his family his children brother brand said he didn't get him back in the in natural life life but he got him in heaven he said they were there waiting on their daddy because he had offered a sacrifice in faith for them can you say Amen you see that's what that's that's what it means for us Amen to be saved and to have faith brother Braham talks about his own children he said' I've got my children there's my little son Joseph and Billy and Sarah and Rebecca well now I want to see each one of them a worker in the gospel doing something I want to see them saved and filled with the Holy Ghost now I've committed them to God and say God I'm holding on to God for them how is holding on to God and I believe they're going to be saved every one of them I believe they're going to be saved and I'll have them on the other side I don't believe my salvation will save them no but my faith in God will do it you see my faith believing God will do it and will cause them to come to Christ can you say Amen now you know here we look and and I don't know you know the everything about the the children his children and all that but I know they've gone through a lot of things but I just believe that they'll be there because the prophet of God was showing and demonstrating a faith that we all as parents must have can you sayen that's right and he says if I'm believing for my house and you're believing for your house by beleving that that we trust God God imputes our own faith like he did Abraham or job or any of them for righteousness so it's allotted to us for righteousness and that's how that thou and thy household shall be saved can you say Amen oh I think it's a wonderful thing so then not only that but I'm holding for every brother now notice how he's even applying faith for for the the church I'm and all my brothers my sisters see I'm not only holding faith for that but I'm holding for every person that's in my church I'm holding for you all I want you to hold for me because of the righteousness of faith we don't have to make a burnt offering Christ is our offering but we have to have faith in that offering that Christ made that that he made us this kind of a promise that whatsoever you ask the father in my name that I'll do and when thou prayest believe that you receive what you've asked for and you shall have it can you say Amen do you love him amen he says in another place if I'm praying that God will save these teenage children and I believe that with all my heart he will do it that's the same way job stood say oh look at this kid and how he's doing I don't care what he's doing or what she's doing I still have put that child in the hand of almighty God me and my house shall be saved even though I may pass on before they do but somehow before they leave here God will twist them right down the on the trail I believe that somehow or another he will make it so miserable for them till they'll have to do it see that's the way I believe it it's thou and thy house shall be saved can you say man you love him if the musicians will come bless the name of the Lord I Hope somehow it's helped you today encouraged your faith Amen brother brandom he said here he says I I guess you've wondered you've often wondered how I see those visions and things and what makes it it's because when he met me that night and told me that that this would happen I
