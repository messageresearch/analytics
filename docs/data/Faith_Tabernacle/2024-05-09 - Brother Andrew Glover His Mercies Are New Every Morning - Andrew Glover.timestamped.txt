[49:00] depths amen of the mercy and the grace
[49:02] of God Amen that God has so generously
[49:05] given Amen to satisfy our hearts now

[49:13] offer God I'm just asking amen for
[49:16] divine mercy and Grace amen I have
[49:19] nothing that I could offer God but I'm
[49:21] asking for divine mercy and Grace
[49:23] another place he said we come amen
[49:26] confessing our wrongs all of our evil
[49:28] doings and thinkings amen and asking for
[49:30] divine mercy and Grace see we unmar
[49:33] anything father we have no merit that we
[49:36] could offer amen but we come in his
[49:38] Merit so here amen we have no merit of
[49:41] our own amen but he has given us his
[49:44] marriage amen that we might come that he
[49:46] freely gave us and told us in the gospel
[49:49] amen that if we would ask we would
[49:51] receive amen if we would seek we would
[49:54] find if it if we would knock amen it's
[49:56] shall be open I tell you tonight amen
[49:59] that is a beautiful promise that if we
[50:00] will ask we shall receive amen amen if
[50:03] we'll knock it shall be opened amen amen
[50:06] if we will seek for it we shall find it
[50:08] so here amen we're not doing these
[50:10] things in in vain amen but we're doing
[50:13] them under a provision of God Amen that
[50:16] when we ask we're going to receive and

[50:19] when we seek we're going to find amen
[50:22] because God Amen is rich in Mercy amen
[50:26] God is rich in Mercy I don't know
[50:28] brother Judah if you could EQ this or
[50:30] something it's a little muffled in my
[50:31] ear amen amen but tonight I believe that
[50:34] God Amen is rich in Mercy now in
[50:36] Ephesians chapter 2 and verse one amen
[50:39] Paul says you hath he quickened amen who
[50:41] were dead in trespasses in sin we in
[50:44] time past ye walked according that's
[50:46] good to the course of this world Amen
[50:49] according to the prince of the power of
[50:51] the air amen the spirit that now worketh
[50:54] in the children of disobedience he said
[50:57] among whom also we all had our
[50:58] conversations in time past Amen in the
[51:01] lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires
[51:03] of the Flesh and of the mind I want you
[51:06] to watch this and we're by Nature amen
[51:09] the children of Wrath even as others so
[51:12] amen we were by Nature the children of
[51:14] Wrath amen but we were not by seed the
[51:16] children of Wrath amen now watch what he
[51:19] goes on to say but God Amen who is rich
[51:22] in Mercy amen for his great love
[51:25] wherewith he loved us even when we were
[51:28] dead in sin amen has quickened us
[51:31] together with Christ amen and by Grace
[51:34] ye are saved amen can I say this tonight
[51:37] that Mercy amen and grace are in direct
[51:40] connection amen amen you cannot have the
[51:42] grace of God Amen without having the
[51:44] mercy of God and you cannot have the
[51:47] mercy of God without having the grace of
[51:48] God Amen because God is rich in Mercy
[51:52] that word mercy is kindness or Good Will
[51:54] towards the miserable amen and the
[51:56] Afflicted amen it is joined amen with a
[51:59] desire to help them amen I love how the
[52:02] Greek breaks this word mercy down it
[52:04] speaks of mercy of men towards men so
[52:07] that means to exercise the virtue of
[52:09] Mercy Amen to show oneself merciful amen
[52:13] the mercy of God towards men Amen in the
[52:16] general Providence the mercy in of God
[52:19] in providing amen and offering to men
[52:22] salvation by Christ amen then he speaks
[52:25] of the mercy of Christ whereby at his
[52:27] return Amen to judgment he will bless
[52:30] the true Christians amen with eternal
[52:33] life amen now let me just go ahead and

[1:01:35] thee amen that parth iniquity and
[1:01:37] passees by the transgression of the
[1:01:40] remnant of his Heritage he retaineth not
[1:01:43] his anger forever amen because he
[1:01:46] delighteth in Mercy in other words he's
[1:01:49] a God that does bring correction but he
[1:01:52] does not hang the correction over you
[1:01:54] for the rest of your life

[1:02:13] he will have compassion upon us he will
[1:02:15] subdue our iniquities and that will cast
[1:02:18] all their sins into the depths of the
[1:02:21] sea then now will perform the truth to
[1:02:24] Jacob and the mercy to Abraham which
[1:02:27] thou has sworn amen unto our fathers
[1:02:29] from the days of old in Titus Chapter 3
[1:02:31] and verse three we find that Mercy amen
[1:02:34] is what makes salvation possible the
[1:02:37] Bible says for we ourselves also amen
[1:02:40] were sometimes foolish how many how many
[1:02:42] can agree there we were sometimes
[1:02:44] disobedient we've all been there he said
[1:02:47] deceived amen serving divers lust and
[1:02:49] Pleasures amen living in Malice and envy
[1:02:52] and hateful and hating one another but
[1:02:54] after the kindness and the love of God
[1:02:57] our savior toward man appeared amen not
[1:02:59] by the works of righteousness which we
[1:03:01] have done but according to his Mercy he
[1:03:04] has saved us by the washing of the
[1:03:06] Regeneration amen and the renewing of
[1:03:09] the Holy Ghost you know what that word
[1:03:11] renewing means amen it is a renovation
[1:03:14] it is a complete change for the better
[1:03:16] what are you saying preacher I'm saying
[1:03:19] when the mercy of God walks in amen
[1:03:21] it'll renovate a home it'll renovate a
[1:03:23] church it'll renovate a family it'll
[1:03:26] renovate a Ministry I say oh God come
[1:03:28] down tonight in your unlimited mercies
[1:03:31] and perform a renovation on every heart
[1:03:34] on every young person on every family
[1:03:36] every home we need a change church we
[1:03:39] don't need a new home we don't need a
[1:03:41] new car we need a body change and the
[1:03:44] only thing that can provide that is the
[1:03:46] god who is rich in Mercy who is slow to
[1:03:49] anger and retaineth not wrath now watch
[1:03:52] what he said he shed on us abundantly
[1:03:55] amen through Jesus Christ Our Savior
[1:03:57] that being justified by his grace we
[1:04:00] should be made Hees hallelujah
[1:04:03] hallelujah we brother Terry we've been
[1:04:05] made hes amen according to the hope of
[1:04:09] eternal life listen tonight if you're
[1:04:12] waiting on eternal life we can't have
[1:04:13] church
[1:04:15] tonight if you're waiting on eternal
[1:04:17] life I can't preach the promises to you
[1:04:20] but if you have already received the
[1:04:23] eternal life of Jesus Christ then right
[1:04:25] here on a Wednesday night amen you can
[1:04:27] shout on the devil's head you can
[1:04:29] Rejoice over the problem because the
[1:04:32] grace of God and the mercy of God has
[1:04:35] made you subject Amen to the hope of
[1:04:37] eternal life amen through Jesus Christ
[1:04:41] Hallelujah God made promises to each age
[1:04:44] and he promised that in each age
[1:04:45] something would happen then he then the
[1:04:47] very way that he said it would happen is
[1:04:50] the exact way it will come to pass I
[1:04:53] love what brother B says and when their
[1:04:54] eyes were open they knew him 64 he said
[1:04:57] and as we see the prophecies fulfilled
[1:04:59] today that the Church of how we become
[1:05:02] rich in the things of the world and
[1:05:03] think we have need of nothing and he
[1:05:05] said we were we were naked blind
[1:05:08] miserable and didn't know it but father
[1:05:11] we ask for Grace then that you open our
[1:05:14] eyes to the understanding of Thy
[1:05:16] word that we might understand the hour
[1:05:19] We're living that we might prepare
[1:05:21] ourselves for his appearing as we truly
[1:05:24] believe it's at hand can I say this
[1:05:26] every age God promised a message every
[1:05:29] message God sends to an age comes with
[1:05:31] two elements you know what those
[1:05:33] elements are amen the first one is Mercy
[1:05:36] and the second one is Judgment now let
[1:05:38] me say this to reject the message is to
[1:05:41] accept the Judgment amen but to accept
[1:05:44] the message amen is to reject the
[1:05:46] Judgment in other words if you can
[1:05:48] accept the mercy of God you are you are
[1:05:51] bypassing the Judgment of God if you if
[1:05:54] you bypass the mercy Mery of God you are
[1:05:57] accepting the Judgment of God y'all
[1:05:58] remember blam tells that story about the
[1:06:01] man that went out and found gold and he
[1:06:02] said he he had a whole slew of gold and
[1:06:05] the next morning he was going to go cash
[1:06:06] it in he said he was making all kinds of
[1:06:09] plans for what he was going to do amen
[1:06:11] amen with all that money brother Kevin
[1:06:13] he was getting from that gold you know
[1:06:14] he said but then about about 2:00 in the
[1:06:16] morning he said his old dog out there
[1:06:19] amen got to bark and and he said he went
[1:06:21] out there and he said what's the matter
[1:06:22] with you shut up he said I'm trying to
[1:06:24] sleep he said tomorrow I'm going to cash
[1:06:26] in the gold he said I'm going to retire
[1:06:28] pretty you know brother B said about
[1:06:30] about 30 minutes later he started
[1:06:31] barking again he said he went out there
[1:06:33] and took his shotgun and he shot the dog
[1:06:36] he said when he shot the dog he said
[1:06:38] what he done was he silenced the voice
[1:06:40] of of warning of Mercy that was
[1:06:42] announcing amen that judgment is at hand
[1:06:45] now can I preach here for a second
[1:06:47] brother B said in the in the very hour
[1:06:49] he said they came in robbed the man took
[1:06:52] the gold and killed him and it was all
[1:06:54] because he shot
[1:06:56] amen the voice of warning because he got
[1:06:58] a little high Mighty and didn't think he
[1:07:00] needed what a prophet said anymore he
[1:07:02] got a little H Mighty and didn't think
[1:07:04] you needed to say I'm wrong and a
[1:07:06] prophet is right but you know what I say
[1:07:08] tonight I say God forbid the day ever
[1:07:11] come amen that we shoot these tapes down
[1:07:14] and we shoot this message down listen

[1:07:19] is falling apart Russia is hollering
[1:07:21] Iran is moving hey there's a bride on
[1:07:24] the earth tonight who is heard the voice
[1:07:26] of mercy and the voice of Mercy has made
[1:07:28] an announcement that God has provided a
[1:07:31] way to escape the judgment and is coming
[1:07:34] upon this Earth I tell you what you
[1:07:35] ought to do tonight you ought to shout
[1:07:37] hallelujah your babies are safe your

[1:07:49] of
[1:07:49] judgment Hallelujah I refuse I refuse to
[1:07:53] turn these tapes off and replace them
[1:07:55] with some charismatic preacher I refuse
[1:07:57] to shut my message books and open some
[1:08:00] Theology of some denomination I refuse
[1:08:03] Amen to lay aside the Seven Seals and
[1:08:06] follow some education I am a Son of God
[1:08:09] who is quickened by the mercy of God I
[1:08:11] got to stay under the provision of God
[1:08:14] in the age I'm living in judgment's
[1:08:17] coming church but we've heard the voice
[1:08:21] of
[1:08:22] Mercy
[1:08:23] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:08:26] judgment's on its way but we've heard
[1:08:29] the sound of Mercy now you all know
[1:08:31] according to Hebrews 6 that we're living
[1:08:34] in the hour of the second crucifixion of
[1:08:37] Jesus said like this he said see the
[1:08:40] first one was flesh physically he said
[1:08:42] the second one is word spiritually now
[1:08:45] in Luke 23:33 brother uses this for his
[1:08:48] sermon the indictment he says and then
[1:08:50] they were come to place which is called
[1:08:52] Calvary and there they Cru crucified him
[1:08:56] now watch the malf facturers one on the
[1:08:58] right and one on the left can I break it
[1:09:01] down the way a prophet did there
[1:09:04] Jerusalem the most holy
[1:09:06] place they the most holy people
[1:09:10] crucified the most violent death and
[1:09:13] killed the Prince of Peace amen him the
[1:09:16] most precious person there Jerusalem
[1:09:20] Holy place they holy people killed
[1:09:23] crucified him the most holy person
[1:09:26] brother takes that scripture and
[1:09:28] preaches a sermon called the indictment
[1:09:30] and he says I must show and will show
[1:09:33] that The Same Spirit is on the people
[1:09:35] today that brought the first crucifixion
[1:09:38] and is doing the same thing he said I
[1:09:40] must do that if it's going to be a
[1:09:42] crucifixion that they've crucified I
[1:09:45] must show to the people that the same
[1:09:47] attitude in the people today is doing
[1:09:50] the same thing spiritually that they did
[1:09:53] physically then come on Church amen
[1:09:55] 2,000 years ago they used to cat A N
[1:09:58] Tails 2,000 years ago they used a hammer
[1:10:01] 2,000 years ago they used to whip amen
[1:10:03] but today the same devil that anointed
[1:10:06] them to pick up the hammer is the same
[1:10:08] devil that anoints people to receive a
[1:10:10] bad attitude come on now amen towards
[1:10:14] the word of God and they don't even
[1:10:16] realize that their attitude amen is
[1:10:18] crucifying the word of God AR fresh well
[1:10:21] I might as well preach I'm here had I
[1:10:23] amen they get up and say well you know I
[1:10:25] believe brother br's a prophet but we
[1:10:27] got to look at this amen your attitude
[1:10:29] amen is crucifying the effect of the
[1:10:31] message well I believe brother Ram was a
[1:10:33] prophet but you know amen we got to stay
[1:10:35] with the Bible amen I'm just going to go
[1:10:37] ahead and preach since I'm here amen
[1:10:38] that's the most sickening worst insult
[1:10:41] that you could give to a Vindicated
[1:10:43] Prophet is that he's taught something
[1:10:45] that you can't find in the Bible I say
[1:10:47] everything he found amen any priest can
[1:10:49] be found the Bible and somebody asked me
[1:10:52] one time hey said brother Andrew you
[1:10:53] ain't got no scripture for that I said
[1:10:54] oh but I
[1:10:55] it's called Malachi 4:5 and
[1:10:58] 6 come on now a amen it's not that we
[1:11:01] don't have scripture it's that they
[1:11:03] won't accept the scripture we have but I
[1:11:05] believe church amen his mercy and his
[1:11:09] grace has brought us a message in the
[1:11:11] hour of judgment Amen to escape the
[1:11:13] perversion and the religious confusion
[1:11:16] that's upon this Earth so they crucified
[1:11:18] physically Jesus Christ the son of God
[1:11:21] and now today by the same word by the
[1:11:23] same Holy Spirit and the same word he
[1:11:25] said I wish to show the churches where
[1:11:27] they stand that they're doing the same
[1:11:29] thing today and the Bible said they
[1:11:31] would do it and prove that it's the day
[1:11:34] we're living in it could not been done a
[1:11:36] few years ago I say 50 years ago it
[1:11:39] could not have been done but today this
[1:11:41] is very timely and it could not have
[1:11:43] been done maybe 10 years ago come on now
[1:11:47] if your study is the message you know
[1:11:48] where I'm at I'm in I'm in 1963 and a
[1:11:51] prophet of God was preaching in 1953 and
[1:11:55] he St 10 years later and said 10 years
[1:11:58] ago what I'm saying couldn't have been
[1:11:59] said and what they're doing couldn't
[1:12:01] have been done he said because we are at
[1:12:04] the end time and I believe as his
[1:12:06] servant that we're just about to cross
[1:12:08] from this land to another the time for
[1:12:10] repentance for a nation is gone I
[1:12:12] believe that this nation amen cannot
[1:12:15] repent the nation you're living in he
[1:12:18] said it cannot repent because it is
[1:12:20] crossed amen between the line of mercy
[1:12:23] and judgment he said I believe believe
[1:12:25] amen that she's toddling in the balance
[1:12:28] now you all know I'm in Daniel 5 where
[1:12:30] there was a vision and a handwriting on
[1:12:32] the wall and it said that they found
[1:12:34] warning amen they're weighed in the
[1:12:36] balances and found warning can I say
[1:12:39] this friends we're not in the balances
[1:12:41] tonight we're walking in the promises of
[1:12:43] the word of God in the hour that we're
[1:12:46] living in I love what Matthew 5:7 says
[1:12:49] amen everybody feel good tonight amen
[1:12:51] blessed are the merciful for they shall
[1:12:54] obtain Mercy listen blessed are the
[1:12:56] merciful for they shall obtain Mercy Ram
[1:13:00] comes along and says now that's the only
[1:13:01] way to obtain Mercy is to follow the
[1:13:04] instructions that God has given us to
[1:13:06] follow in that's the only way somebody
[1:13:09] say the only way only way he can show
[1:13:11] Mercy is when we follow what he said do
[1:13:14] he said I'm so glad to know that the
[1:13:16] first revelation of Christ is Mercy and
[1:13:19] the second Revelation is Judgment oh God
[1:13:22] thank you for these who has taken Mercy
[1:13:24] to tonight amen they're on Mercy's Road

[1:13:34] tribulation we're not on the road to
[1:13:36] some type of some type of religious come
[1:13:39] on now amen we're not on that road but

[1:14:11] that just grabbed me brother Shi it's of
[1:14:13] the Lord's mercies that we are not
[1:14:16] consumed because his compassions fail
[1:14:19] not I want you to look at this word
[1:14:21] consumed it means to be complete it
[1:14:24] means to be finished it means to be at
[1:14:26] the end it means to cease it means to be
[1:14:29] exhausted it means to be spent it means
[1:14:32] to be completely crossed over listen the
[1:14:35] Bible said it is of the Lord's mercies
[1:14:38] that we are not exhausted it's of the
[1:14:41] Lord's mercies that we have not ceased

[1:16:08] cases and change the doctor's report
[1:16:10] come on can I get a witness here tonight
[1:16:12] that Mercy has got two feet and mercy
[1:16:15] can walk in a situation hey I remember
[1:16:17] when I first started preaching I heard
[1:16:19] somebody say it and I think I ran all
[1:16:20] over the place with it brother Tim
[1:16:21] somebody said when Mercy Mercy Walked In
[1:16:24] they said when Justice was about to hang
[1:16:26] me amen Mercy Cut the
[1:16:28] Rope now come on if you got the justice
[1:16:31] of God Amen we would have done been hung
[1:16:33] by our mistakes we would have done been
[1:16:35] hung by our failures we would have done
[1:16:37] been hung by our first birth amen but
[1:16:39] God who is rich in Mercy has the ability
[1:16:43] to walk into situations and literally
[1:16:45] change the
[1:16:47] outcome you me prove it to you by the
[1:16:49] Bible it's in Daniel 3 there were three
[1:16:52] Hebrew boys who were going in the
[1:16:55] furnace prophet of God said they were
[1:16:57] there were three more down there he said
[1:16:59] they pledged their loyal to the cause
[1:17:01] who were truly Abraham's seed and that
[1:17:03] was Shadrach meach and abedo and they
[1:17:06] were put to the test now here's what
[1:17:09] they said if you do not bow when you
[1:17:11] hear the harps are playing and the
[1:17:12] trumpets are sounding if you do not bow
[1:17:14] to our religion and get away from them
[1:17:17] things you're standing for and you're
[1:17:19] all wet anyhow your religion is no more
[1:17:21] than anybody else's he said don't we
[1:17:23] hear that all the time but the religion
[1:17:26] of Jesus Christ is different he said the
[1:17:28] power of his resurrection is different
[1:17:31] we are a different people we are A
[1:17:33] peculiar people we are a royal
[1:17:35] priesthood I love this brother Brian

[1:17:51] things we're facing come on amen amen
[1:17:54] sister Martin I don't mean to pick on
[1:17:55] you amen but when the doctors diagnosed
[1:17:57] you with cancer amen you were walking
[1:17:59] through doctor's offices with people
[1:18:01] that had the same thing that they said
[1:18:03] you had amen but God who is rich in
[1:18:06] Mercy made a difference in that woman's
[1:18:08] life amen that she didn't walk in there
[1:18:11] amen under the condemnation of the
[1:18:13] condition she didn't let the doctor's
[1:18:15] report consume her but she let her
[1:18:17] praise and her worship and her faith and
[1:18:20] her loyalty to who she was as a daughter
[1:18:23] of God Amen cons the circumstances well
[1:18:26] you know what I say it's time to do it's

[1:36:30] what got the church in trouble today is
[1:36:32] too many educated preachers oh God too
[1:36:36] many educated preachers without being
[1:36:39] born of the spirit now I might as well
[1:36:41] just say it if you ain't God it you
[1:36:43] can't preach
[1:36:44] [Music]
[1:36:46] it hello somebody if you ain't got it
[1:36:49] you can't preach
[1:36:51] it well that devil don't like it but I
[1:36:53] ain't back backing up if you ain't got
[1:36:55] it you can't preach it so that's why
[1:36:57] they resort to psychology and they
[1:36:59] resort to education and they resort to
[1:37:01] this idea and this program because they
[1:37:04] haven't been on the backside of the
[1:37:06] desert Amen in a war against the devil
[1:37:09] and the pillar of fire come down and
[1:37:11] equip them to face the devil you know
[1:37:13] what I say I say God bless them they can
[1:37:14] do what they want but ask for me in my
[1:37:16] house we're not listening to
[1:37:18] intellectual speeches in the stad of
[1:37:20] preaching the power and the resurrection
[1:37:22] of Jesus Christ that's what God is in
[1:37:24] trouble today we don't need any more
[1:37:26] high schools and education for preachers
[1:37:28] we need God called men that's filled
[1:37:31] where the Holy Spirit and not some
[1:37:32] man-made Theology of some denomination
[1:37:35] can I say it and say it plain we've had
[1:37:37] enough intellectual
[1:37:39] speeches come on Church we've had enough
[1:37:42] intellectual speeches brother said them
[1:37:44] intellectual speeches are deceptive he
[1:37:47] said they're polished up he said I don't
[1:37:49] believe in intellectual speeches I
[1:37:51] believe in the word itself and then stay
[1:37:54] with that promise Until It's Made
[1:37:55] manifest and fulfilled then you've got
[1:37:57] it see that's what the church needs
[1:37:59] today is the power and the truth again
[1:38:02] intellectual Giants have come in and
[1:38:04] they've got all pushed in and they
[1:38:06] pushed Christ Plum out of his church
[1:38:08] he's standing knocking to the door of
[1:38:10] his own house trying to get back in oh
[1:38:12] God no other age was it ever that way
[1:38:14] but it is in this age this intellectual
[1:38:16] age but you've got your soldiers
[1:38:20] harnessed that's why the devil hates
[1:38:22] these kind of meetings amen is because
[1:38:24] God has got some soldiers that are
[1:38:27] harnessed to the power and the truth of
[1:38:30] the resurrection of Jesus Christ and
[1:38:32] they believe that if you start looking
[1:38:34] long enough you'll boil it down to a
[1:38:37] spirit now we might as well say it
[1:38:41] listen people say well I don't think
[1:38:42] every problem is a spirit problem well
[1:38:44] that's because some intellectual
[1:38:46] polished up souser has convinced you
[1:38:48] it's not and N can I preach brother Sean
[1:38:51] and nine times out of 10 why they don't
[1:38:53] want to believe it's your spirit problem
[1:38:55] is because the only way you can get rid
[1:38:56] of it's cast it
[1:38:58] out and the only way you can cast it out
[1:39:01] is the Holy Ghost come on the scene come
[1:39:04] come I've been there I've been in some
[1:39:05] prayer lines and seen some demons
[1:39:07] manifest themselves it ain't a pretty

[1:39:21] trespassing on God's precious property
[1:39:24] and by the authority and the power of
[1:39:26] the word of God I serve you eviction
[1:39:29] notice and I say take your hands off of

[1:56:10] eagle he seen them cluck like chickens
[1:56:13] he seen them scratch for worms like
[1:56:15] chickens he seen them walk like chickens
[1:56:18] act like chickens but they never become
[1:56:20] consumed
[1:56:22] that when mother eagle flew over the
[1:56:25] Barnard he looked at Mama and something
[1:56:28] in him reminded him you're not a chicken
[1:56:32] you're an
[1:56:33] eagle I wonder tonight how many raise

[2:14:58] on as they just play softly God bless
[2:15:02] you we want to remember
[2:15:05] Service uh uh Sunday I believe it
[2:15:08] Mother's Day and um looking forward to
[2:15:13] what God has in store for us amen and
[2:15:18] um enjoyed the sermon tonight one just
[2:15:23] keep brother Andrew in our prayer that
[2:15:26] the Lord would just keep using him
[2:15:27] anointing him in a great way a lot of
[2:15:33] opposition you know surrounding the
[2:15:36] message and uh he he faces that quite a
[2:15:40] bit wherever he goes but not only that
[2:15:43] but just
[2:15:44] traveling when just that the God would
[2:15:47] just keep him as he traveling down the
[2:15:49] road and and um you know just so many
[2:15:53] accidents so many crazy things that are
[2:15:56] going and Satan would just love to take
[2:15:59] men of God like that out but um I
[2:16:02] believe it's our
[2:16:04] prayers and God just um that keeps keeps
[2:16:09] uh them and so I think we all work
[2:16:12] together as a body and we may not be
[2:16:15] able to travel like he does but we can
[2:16:18] sure
[2:16:19] pray and um so we want to pray and keep
[2:16:23] one another in our prayers and again
