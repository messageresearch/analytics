first pull second pull uh Eagles and um prayer lines and discernment and everything and she wrote this song about eagles so um just kind of felt led to singing I'm we'll try it tonight I think it's in B flat we have kind of an own vocabulary we're Eagles and you'll you'll hopefully you'll enjoy I'm an eagle in this end time age I'm on a strict diet I can't eat what the crows feed on cuz it makes me sick to try it I can't run around like the chickens do while feting on the ground I got to move B up where the Eagles are for they are glorybound oh I'm an eagle yes I'm an eagle there ain't no chicken living in me oh I'm an eagle yes I'm an eagle one day God passed by the Barnard and set me free if you can eat with the crows and the chickens too there's something just not right if you have a taste for this old world you have a hard time living right but if you fill your soul with God's fresh Mana that's all that you will need you'll know what it is to live right and you'll know how to believe oh I'm an eagle yes I'm an eagle there ain't no chicken living in me oh I'm an eagle oh I'm an eagle one day God passed by the Barnard and set me [Music] free amen how many Eagles do we have here tonight amen I'm one of them I'm one of them well I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them oh one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them now there are people almost everywhere whose hearts are all of flame with a fire that fell at Pentecost which cleansed and made them clean it is burning now within my heart all glory to his name I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them oh I'm one of them I'm one of them oh I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them oh one of them I'm one of of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them sister Jane comes I'm one of

to turn it over to our pastor [Music] little Le go and [Music] flly you Wen born for the valley you were born for the sky don't let your trials bring you down now or drive your spirit to the ground just Mount up with wings little e and fly can we stand and sing it now so spread your wings little Le go and fly [Music] you weren't born for the valley you were born for the sky don't let your trial

let the trial get you down and drive your spirit to the ground Mount up with wings little he go and fly amen I'm so glad that we have the wings to fly the prophet told us that our wings is the Old and New Testament amen and to think that we we couldn't fly because of Creeds and dogmas and man-made ideas and but all I'm so glad that amen the word has been restored amen and it's it's going home time thought of the other day just thinking of that scripture you know of where the Lord promised that he would bear his people up on Eagle wings and and we saw you know how that the Jews use that scripture you know to uh if I've got history right that they were a lot of them were maybe scared to get on the planes as an old Rabbi he began to read that scripture he bear bear my people up on Eagle wings and they took courage and they got in all them PLS and they went to the Homeland and there they are positionally there and we see what's going on and that ain't all by accident it's uh um um it's just exactly the way God's planned it and we know that that U God the spirit of God is lifting off of America off the Gentiles and is returning back to the Jews before all that can happen amen there's there's an eaglets if we could say it that way that God promised I ain't going to leave them here I'm going to Bear them up on Eagle wings and I'm so glad for that because we've got a word that is restored to us not to just get us educated not to make us church members but to literally take us home amen and I am so glad for that we are getting ready to leave this world and you know people are falling apart and they're looking for answers the most intelligent men are looking for answers what's going on what's Happening you know and just talking to a gentleman today just a really fine gentleman and uh but he was telling me he says I he said that things have just gone crazy so we don't know what to do and and uh his certain denomination they've left that it's all Fallen apart and he said four six years ago we would have never thought of all this and he said we've just all been just seemed like just contented with doing what we're doing and then all of a sudden Things Fall Apart and he and he says you know basically what what's the answers for this and of course just begin to tell him how the Bible tells us these things have got to happen but it ain't for us to fall apart amen and to fear and that God has sent us Eagle wings Amen to where we could fly and rise above it all aren't you glad for that amen and uh so good to be in the house of the Lord and uh good to have uh uh uh the Quinton family brother Matthew and his family with us tonight and all the way from North Carolina and uh uh they had uh come to our meeting and uh we just really enjoyed having them

honored to have them and uh good to have brother Amos and sister Lisa back with us and amen and uh uh just everyone sister Mindy I believe I don't know if she's back with us yet or not but anyways

then uh honored to have him come be a part of the meetings anden sure good to see you all again God bless you and amen tonight if you have your Bibles we want to go to the book of Lamentations again the third chapter the book of Lamentations the third chapter and uh I also want to bring a greetings from Brother Steven propolus there in the Saints in Maryland we were there for some meetings this weekend it's actually our first time being there and Amen brother Steven said to be sure and greet brother Shawn brother Terry and brother Amos for him so we we want to do that tonight and amen isn't it a isn't it an honor to serve the Lord amen I know there may be a lot L going on but we are we are dedicated to a message amen and we're going to come out of everything the that the Lord leads us to Amen in Lamentations the thir chapter we want to look there amen and then in Ephesians 2 but here in in Lamentations 3 Amen in verse number 18 the Bible said and I said my strength and my hope is perished from the Lord remembering my Affliction and my misery the wormwood and the GF all my soul hath him still in remembrance and is humbled in me this I recall to my mind and therefore have I hope it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed amen now here's why because his compassions they fail not they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness the Lord is my portion saith my soul therefore will I hope in him and the Lord is good unto them that wait for him Amen to the soul that seeketh him now in Ephesians chapter 2 in Ephesians chapter 2 and verse one uh you all know that this is Brother bram's text in the sermon God who is rich in Mercy amen and I want to tonight maybe just to speak a little bit here to you some more on the thought of Mercy we were speaking last time we spoke to you on his mercies R new every morning and maybe just to take another portion of that in Ephesians chapter 2 and verse one Paul here speaking brother Bram says it very beautiful a personal way he says you hath he quickened who were dead and trespasses and sins now we're in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh for fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others now amen that's a pretty dark picture a't it but God Amen somebody say that with me but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us amen let's just bow our hearts together tonight Heavenly Father Lord your word is true and your spirit is so real among us tonight father as I heard your Prophet say today that Lord we're not just coming to church to learn something new or to father to get a better idea or to just see one another he said but we're coming to church because God is God and Lord I know to the world or to some that might sound foolish but Lord to a Believer Lord Wherever We Gather and know that you are God that means all things are possible and Lord as we come here tonight thou knowest the needs of every heart Lord the situations that maybe seem impossible Lord Maybe sicknesses and diseases and bodies Lord I don't know all the needs but thou knowest all things and Lord we're asking you to come among us tonight now father we we have sensed your presence here in the singing Lord as the Believers have laid aside the cares of life and the things of the day to Lord create an atmosphere that you would be pleased to come and dwell in now Lord I'm asking as we Endeavor to look into your word Lord May the power of Revelation take over the meeting Lord May Hearts be stimulated by the revelation of the word that youve sent in this generation and whatever you have on your heart we'll be sure to give thee praise and honor and glory for all things you do Lord you do them well we commit this meet in thy faithful hands in Jesus Christ's name we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen God bless you amen as you have your seats here tonight amen we we thank the Lord for the reading of the word of God amen amen I want to by the help of the Lord for just a few moments amen I want to take a a thought here tonight and the titled this I kind of may be left off with that last time but I want to pick up here on it's of his mercies amen that we are not consumed intellectually it's of his mercies that we're not consumed intellectually now Ephesians 2 Paul says but God who is rich in Mercy brother BR said see he's rich in many things he said but to me the greatest of all amen is that he is rich in Mercy now when you look at the definition of mercy from Ephesians 2 it is the kindness or the good willll towards the miserable and The Afflicted amen and it is joined with a desire to help them amen now then that Mercy begins to be broke down speaking of men showing Mercy towards men that is to exercise the virtue of Mercy amen and to show on self merciful then there is the mercy of God towards men and that is the mercy of God in providing and offering to men salvation amen by Christ then he speaks of the mercy of Christ amen whereby at his return to judgment he will bless true Christians amen with eternal life now I'll say this tonight I believe that we are here amen as Eagles I believe we're here as end time Believers that believe in the end time word and I believe that we're not here gathered under just commentaries and ideas and theologies amen but we're here underneath a prophet's teaching amen which is a perfect interpretation of the word of God Amen with Divine Vindication so we no longer amen just reading Act 2 or John 3 or John 5 amen under the mindset of what somebody else has thought about those scriptures amen but now we're reading it under perfect interpretation amen by Divine Vindication therefore tonight I can announce to you amen that we are already the possessors of eternal life amen and there is absolutely nothing that the devil can do about it amen think about that tonight there's no devil there's no trouble there's no pressure amen there's nothing that can change change the Revelation amen that you was in God from before the foundation of the world Amen and you are here as a representation amen of a manifestation of the thought of God now brother sister very beautiful that no man can come to me except my father draws him first see all that comes amen they will have everlasting life amen and I'll raise them up at the last day now he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me now watch what brother B says amen have not will have so this is not something in the future amen but rather it's something in the past amen that they will have amen present tense right now amen Everlasting eternal life and shall not come into condemnation amen but they have passed from Death unto life now amen because you have believed not intellectually amen but from your heart so you're in possession amen of the Divine promise of God of eternal life amen not because of something you did amen but because of something he did amen and you have accepted the Revelation that these are not things in the past amen and they're not just in the future amen but they're right here in the present again he says every who believes on Jesus Christ I don't mean intellectually believes amen but with your heart believes on Jesus Christ amen then God's life comes into you and you got eternal life amen and you pass from death into life because Christ has said Soul amen now I'm I'm drawing this inspiration tonight amen it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed amen because of his compassions they fail not now amen y'all remember last time we spoke to you on those three Hebrew boys amen how that they did not allow the fiery furnace to consume their identity amen but rather they left the door of Mercy open so that the fourth man could walk in amen and they were possessing the gates of the enemy amen because the Lord's mercies were new unto them I want to say this morning or he says now they are new every morning because Great Is Thy Faithfulness now I want to read this to you again they are new Every Morning day and night amen proclaim the mercy and compassion of God who could exist throughout the day if there were not a continual amen superintending Providence who could be preserved in the night if the Watchmen of Israel ever slumbered or slept but we are sustained by the mercies of God Amen we are sustained by the mercies of God man whole life his bodily his mental and spiritual is sustained by the mercy of the Lord it is of the Lord's Mercy amen that we are not consumed intellectually it is of the Lord's Mercy that we are not consumed intellectually he said consider the wear and tear the brain this Rider amen the continual evolution of thought the daily anxiety of mind and against this set all renewing energy of the Holy Ghost who gives strength day by day repairing the waste of faculty and renewing the resources of power now I want to just give you this definition here of the word intellectually amen it means in a way that relates to your ability it is a way that relates to your ability to think and understand things amen especially complicated ideas amen now if you if You' lived more than two seconds on the earth amen you've run into some complicated times you run into some complicated situations amen but here he's saying amen do not become consumed intellectually amen with the situation because when you become consumed intellectually what you do is you replace the Divine ability amen with your own human ability see what begins to happen is you begin to think how can I work this out how can I fix this amen how can I change this amen and you become consumed that you forget everything amen that you ought to remember and you remember everything that you ought to forget amen that's why we're not here amen serving God B off of an intellectual conception Amen brother said I'm astonished in this day and have always been when people profess to be Christian and the first little little trial comes they fall by the wayside it goes to show that it was an intellectual conception of Christ that's the reason so many don't hold out today is because it's an intellectual conception intellectually you could believe it but it goes further than Nazi Amen to accept Christ is to accept the person of Christ amen so to accept Christ amen is to accept the person he said many of us accept religion of Christianity upon the learning of Creeds others accept Christianity upon the doctrines of baptism amen some on the emotion they have exercised such as shouting or dancing the spirit speaking in tongues having marvelous gifts to present amen all those things are good in their place amen but to accept Christ is to accept the person it's then these other things just automatically fall in line amen so if you get him amen then the shouting will come amen if you get him then the dancing will come if you get him then the gifts will come if you get him amen then the revelation will come listen without Christ amen we're just a group of people gathered in a building amen but if Christ comes on the scene amen he has the potential Amen to change every heart to heal every body to save every life listen friends I'm talking about a God who still has the ability to defy amen the odds against you and say but if I for them then who can be against them amen listen because God Amen has always sought man it's never been man seeking God it's always been God seeking man and I want to say this you can run but you can't hide amen you can say you're going to quit but you can't amen cuz you didn't start yourself and you can't finish yourself amen but God on the day of Pentecost started this church amen and there ain't enough criticisms there ain't enough intellectuals there ain't enough Devils of forms and rituals Amen to defeat seek God in his work of redemption in the age we're living in amen God is seeking somebody amen who will believe him not intellectually but from the heart he said now see he may be intellectually believe in God but when he believes from his heart he is converted and becomes a member of the body of Christ when he is converted from his heart and not from his intellects said look before they could see the Miracles amen they had to come the provided approach before they could see leave the Red Sea open amen they had to be a partaker amen of the provided approach amen of the Divine approach or the Divine articles amen now remember brother said the only way to obtain Mercy amen is to follow the instructions that will literally release Mercy into your life and I want to say this message amen is not legalism amen this message is not a bunch of Dos and don't and go here and don't go there amen but this message is the instructions amen from the Lamb of God who is come in this generation listen hey if God is rich in Mercy then he's able to change every home he's able to change every life listen I believe it friends I believe that God has unlimited money amen can I say it like that I'm not talking about George Washington's and grants and and all that I'm talking about his blessings amen he's unlimited you know you know somebody said one time I heard a girl say she said I like to marry a man had an unlimited bank account well you know in all reality if you married somebody and they had1 billion doar amen you think that's unlimited amen but at the end of the day when they get to 11 billion 9999 they're reaching the cap see amen it seems unlimited but there's still a cap on it but do you realize that you're God hallelujah amen he's unlimited amen which means if he healed one cancer he can heal another cancer if he saved one young person he can save another young person if he gave one person the Holy Ghost he can give anybody the Holy Ghost I'm talking about a God who is come back in this generation and has been introduced by the seventh angel and the limits and the restrictions have been taken off of him and he is here in the power of his resurrection he is here calling you beyond where you're at calling you beyond the situation you're in and saying listen don't become consumed with your ability don't become consumed with how you can fix it but rely on me in the face of every situation you want to see the Red Sea open I got Mercy to open it you want to see the fiery furnace is defeated I've got Mercy to defeat it you want to see the lines close their hungry mouths I've got Mercy to close their hungry mouths you want to see the Widow of Nam son raised from the dead I've got Mercy to raise him from the dead you want to see the bride in Revival I will reveal the seven Thunders I will initiate the third pull and I will open an unceasing Revival that troubles and things can never put out my before you can ever become a partaker of this blessed Heavenly calling you have have to come through the provided approach it is not self- sustaining it is not intellectually but it is death to yourself and to reborn again in Christ Jesus Through the offering of the blood you cannot work hard enough to bring yourself into this approach you cannot read your way into this approach you cannot memorize your way into this approach if you come into this approach unto God you will come simply amen by the offering of the shed blood of the innocent one listen then I say that's more than a natural idea amen that's Supernatural and if you're going to believe in the Supernatural and you're not going to be consumed intellectually then the Holy Ghost must amen take over your heart and you know I think that's a I think that's something that will fix a lot of problems amen is if the Holy Ghost took over some hearts again we might as well preach we're here amen I think it fix a lot of situations if we would let the Holy Ghost amen take over again and let him be the counselor let him be the leader let him be the guide listen friends as we gotten so far amen that we think our situations are impossible amen for the Holy Ghost to come on the scene hey I believe we're here as Eagles tonight that believe in the ability of the Holy Ghost Amen to move and change things I say this the mind you have will never it'll never bring us to God Amen because your mind is reasonings amen but God has has no reasonings can I give you some powerful quotes he said see don't doubt believe if it's anchored up here you'll reason it out and say well I guess I lost it amen y y'all know that something God will do something for somebody amen and the devil will come along and say it was an emotion it was a feeling it was a coincidence amen nothing really happened amen but do you realize the devil does not rob somebody that's that's worse off than he is come on that's why the devil ain't fighting denominations he's already got them he's got a marry and men to men and women to women and all kinds of other filth amen but there's a bride on the face of the Earth who is in the conditions of Ephesians 2 1:3 amen but God who was rich in Mercy amen changed her by seed in her soul hey she is a threat to the devil's Kingdom she is a nightmare to Hell amen if the devil could get you church he would have done got you amen but God who is rich in Mercy amen claims you from before the foundation of the world listen don't you give up anything that God has done for you to that devil don't you let the devil sit there and reason it away and say well it was just a feeling it was just a special I did no no it was God rich in Mercy amen delivering you from the ideas and the destiny of hell that Satan desires for you to be in if it's down here all the devils in hell they can't make you doubt it see you believe it anyhow because something took place now watch this not intellectually but Revelation something happened and it was not by intellect it was by Revelation he said now intellectual is all right you can receive the word intellectually but let it soak down through the heart amen that's where it begins to read the results so when the word gets in the heart is when the word begins to see amen and you begin to see the results now amen I believe that the Holy Spirit speaks amen of this end time that we're living in brother I believe it speaks of it being amen an intellectual time you know the prod of God said you want to put some scriptures down here it's Matthew 24 and it's 2 Timothy 3:1 the Holy Spirit speaks amen of a great intellectual age at the end time did you know that amen why is it see he said Joseph I think he's speaking of Bose you've traveled with me much here in the nation you've heard the meetings overseas I go overseas and have 150 200,000 500,000 and the people just one thing you see every day that the meetings goes on nearby here in the Tabernacle up to 10 20 and 30,000 amen will fall from their feet amen and they will praise God they see it what's the matter don't take place in America it's the intellectual time they want someone who can speak amen not of judgment amen not of these things because it breaks them up from their fellowship with their clubs and their lodges amen and the ungodly things that they belong to therefore if their Pastor would name something like like this amen the Deacon board would have him out real quick see amen and put some Ricky in amen because that's what they're wanting amen now watch friends we're living in a Time amen where the prophet of God now this was all the way back in the 50s and 60s amen that America could see one manifestation amen and they would see thousands and thousands and it would not move them amen but now watch amen a prophet says I go overseas amen and they see one manifestation and 30,000 amen fall to their knees and give praise unto God Amen come on it's not because one's in America and one's in Africa or India or Europe it's because the age in the world we're living in the lid has come off of hell and demon powers have moved into religious Realms and they've invaded pulpits they've invaded seminaries they've invaded headquarters amen and people are being consumed intellectually come on Church they're doing things that don't even make sense now come on y'all know I'm telling the truth it don't make sense for man amen to marry a man I don't know why I'm here but I'm here amen it don't make sense for a woman to marry a woman amen it don't make sense out there amen but do you realize we're living a day and time where they're now trying to make it make sense from a pullit oh come on Friends amen well we might as well preach for here amen now you say well that's him old Baptist in Pentecostal amen well let's just go ahead and bring it on to our ranks amen amen it used to be that church was where they preach the gospel amen but now intellectually amen we need to shut the preachers up and just press player put a t I'm going to get in trouble a and just shut all the ministry down amen it's intellectuals have invaded the puppet and we might as well say it amen when you bull it down to the bottom amen it's a devil trying to gain access to a church because if you silence the Watchman in the tower he will take over every inch of that church but I want to let that devil know I don't care how intellectual people become around this message I will stay amen with the spirit filled leadership of the Holy Ghost that is returned in this age to Lead Me amen there's a high calling upon my life I can't stay in leosa I can't stay in the world I got to go to where I come from I came from God and I got to go back to God and the only thing will take me there is the Holy Spirit and the power of his resurrection it's an intellectual age it's an intellectual time now you all know I'm preaching tonight amen we don't have sermons no more we have intellectual speeches come on church amen the preach of the Gospel has been reduced down to a few good points you know well here's a few good that's what brother said that's what got the church in trouble today is too many educated preachers without being born of the spirit men and women like to listen to intellectual speeches in the stead of preaching amen the power and the resurrection of Jesus Christ amen I want to say this and I say it without one hesitation I am a firm believer in the power of his resurrection I believe it has the power to save I believe it has the power to heal I believe it has the power to change come on Friends somebody told me one time they said will you all say the power of his resurrection I said no Paul said that and a Prophet come and showed us that's where the power was laying was in the ability Amen to raise again on the third day listen that's what got us in trouble he said we don't need any more high schools or educated preachers what we need is God call called men that's filled with the Holy Spirit and not some man-made Theology of some denomination intellectual speeches are deceptive amen can I preach tonight amen they are deceptive and what they do amen is they bring the church into a state of deception then the enemy comes in and don't knowbody how to deal with the devil amen because there's nothing in the intellectual speeches that will anoint them to break the power of that devil but in a good oldfashioned Holy Ghost inspired ser Mark 16 said they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover I don't believe it's time to put up with Devils I believe it's time to put out the devil I don't believe it's time to put up with Spirits I believe it's time to defeat the Spirits by the preaching of the message of the hour listen I will not lay down my Bible and let some polished up intellectual speech amen become my voice I'm going to say what a prophet said Till every devil backs up because I'm living in the hour of fulfillment when God promised a restoration Joel 2:23 he said be glad then amen ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath given you the former Reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month said the former rain means a rain of teaching and the second rain is the rain of the spirit that comes upon what's been taught amen and produces the crop now the first rain is a teaching rain but the second rain amen is a harvest rain so if the seed that's been taught is good seed then when the rain begins to fall amen the rain will bring a harvest to The Good Seed watch why it we've had such a Revival amen Pentecostal Baptist all of the trees put out their buds as Jesus said they would and what if we hatched out the Baptist they got a million more than 44 look at the Catholic how they increase look at the nomination look at Pentecost what do we do we seow denominational seeds amen and we reap denominational Harvest amen why the church ought to be on fire for God right now if there's ever been a word seed sold back there there would be signs and wonders and miracles and the church would be together amen with one heart and one Accord amen marching toward Zion for the Rapture but what did we do we had intellectual speeches Amen in the stead of the word listen friends intellectual speeches amen is not the teacher rain or the teaching rain of Joel too because my Prophet said is this okay brother Sean my Prophet said when the Harvest rain falls it will cause a growth now come on I believe in good Bible teaching amen and I believe that God can anoint men to teach amen but if you're going to teach teach what a prophet taught am I know not everybody preaches like me or preaches like brother Sean or screams like brother Amos and shouts are you hearing me we're all different amen but let me say this if a man's going to be a teacher amen teach a seed amen that when the Holy Ghost moves on and advances or the Dynamics Begin to Fall amen the gas won't sputter but there'll be a fire that can burn come on y'all know what I'm talking about amen are you hearing me Amen brother amamos you may go into church sometime and preach amen and you start preaching and everybody starts shouting and rejoicing and the pastor sitting there saying man amen I ain't never seen this amen it ain't that the pastor's useless amen it's that the pastor has been laying in good seed amen then when the Rain Begin to Fall for the preaching of the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost amen there was a combustion took place and there was a Revival broke out in the heart listen I think it's time to let Revival burn more than just once a year or twice a year I think we ought let the Revival of the Bride amen burn every day burn every hour burn every day of Our Lives hey this ain't just a one-year camp meeting this ain't just a oneye special week amen it's a Revival fires of God bringing forth a harvest amen of the word I'll say what a prophet said I don't believe in intellectual speeches I think we got that point home let's move on I believe in the word itself then stay with that promise Until It's Made manifest and fulfilled then you've got it the brother said the church today somebody say today needs the power and Truth again now I'll say this the opening of the word amen is the restoring of the original Power and Truth in other words to the church when the seal come open when the word was revealed it was more than an intellectual conception it was the promise of the restoration amen of what the cankerworm and the pmer worm and the caterpillar and the Locust eat away in Daniel 12:4 thou oh Daniel shut up the words amen and seal the book even to the time of the end for many shall run to and fro now watch this and knowledge shall be increased there no reason why that the age we're living in would not be consumed intellectually because it's the age when knowledge is increasing Daniel said in that day they would run to and fro knowledge shall increase the wise shall know their God in that day and they shall do great exploits amen but the wicked will not know amen the god of Heaven listen the wicked knows the god of denomination they know the god of Education they know the god of society they know the god of politics amen but they don't know brother shemiah amen the god of Heaven amen because they did not come from Heaven and the there's not a pull to go back to Heaven listen that's why oh I feel like preaching right now that's why with all the advancements of Technology it does not satisfy the thirst of the Bride to leave leosia come on church amen is it's okay to preach amen some of you all come in the message when they were still washing Amen on washboards Amen no offense that's what was happening amen there was no technology and here you are years later and there's all kinds of gadgets technology and you're still talking about a future home you're still talking about a place amen where there is no technology where there is no science where there is no devil you know why because you're not a seed amen of civilization of this Earth you have come from God and you got to go back to God and so God will not allow science he will not allow politics come on church he will not let nothing amen suppress or subdue amen the thought of your heart of going to heaven come on now I'm going to say it amen there was EV angelist started traveling around this message amen when you didn't have all the didn't have all the technology you didn't have all the fancy things you didn't have all the PowerPoint come on you know what I'm talking about amen but now we're this far down the road and we got computers I'm going somewhere friends amen we've not become consumed intellectually we have not brought an idea to the pullit that we can produce a Rapture apart from the message we're still saying no matter what tomorrow brings no matter what politics bring no matter what invention comes there is no way to take a Rapture amen aart from the restoration of the word in the season we're living so the pro of God said they know the god of heaven and they know him in a form they know him in a ritual the the wicked amen like our first lesson said but they don't know him amen by the way of perfection y'all know what I'm talking about amen there's a pull on this age Amen to advance there's a pull on this age amen more technology and we we're not preaching against it we're thankful for it right I mean come on you were thankful that the air conditioner turned on when he got in your car right amen but listen friends amen that Daniel's waving his hand am that that's not satisfying the real crave of your life come on now amen they're talking about amen that Trump will win in the landslide but I'm still looking for the Rapture come on Church well you say preacher we need to get a good Republican amen get as many as you want but that will never satisfy amen the hunger in this bride we will never be consumed by politics listen if Trump gets it or Biden gets it it will not change the fact that the Thunders have thundered and the seals are open and Rapture and faith is on them tapes and there's a bride who already has Rapture and grace are you hearing me there's a call upon your life and it's not coming from your situation it's coming from a place of perfection he said they don't know him amen by the way of perfection can I say this to you bride you are called to come to Perfection you're not called to come to a new iPhone you're not called to come to a new driverless car you're not called to come to a new president you're not called to come to a new denomination you are called to come to Perfection and the only way you can come to Perfection is by the way of perfection because God's will for us is perfection now Matthew 5:48 says beautiful be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect you all know St John 14:1 let not your hearts be troubled if you believe in God believe also in me for in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and will receive you unto myself that where I am amen there ye may be also come on church that where I am there ye may be also listen that's the desire of every member whose name is in the Lamb's Book of Life it's not to be where there's a good president it's not to be where there's a good economy it's not to be where there's a new invention amen it's to be wherever the lover of their soul is and the Lover of My Soul is none other than the revealed word of the hour which is Jesus Christ he said whether you go whether I go you know and the way you know R said oh the other one is called my father's house I'll go and prepare a place amen I'll take you out of this pest house and I will deliver you into my father's house are y'all hearing me amen so you get the latest of the latest you get the newest of the new amen and you still get a cold and you still get depressed and you still come on church amen listen amen let's just goe and say it God however God sees fit for the political election so be it amen but when it's all said and done amen we still happen problems we'll still have situation amen because we're not where we're supposed to be we're in a pest house but my father's house amen Has Come to Me by the preaching of the message of the hour and there's a seed in my soul that's waiting to break out of These Bars of bone and go me the Lover of My Soul I want to say this I don't care what 2024 holds or 2025 holds my eyes are on the priz my soul is set for heaven I am going to my father's house and there ain't enough devils in Hell there ain't enough depressions anxiety situation misunderstandings amen hurt feelings disappointments that will defeat me in my quest to see him who saved my soul Hallelujah I'm talking about a place a Perfection is calling the church there you are see take you out this whole Earthly pest house he's gone to prepare a place it's a perfect place where no evil exists somebody shout amen no sickness exist somebody shout amen no old age exist somebody shout amen no death exist it's a perfect place calling you to that Perfection and you have to be perfect to get there come on Church you're not going to get there and get perfect when you get there you're going to be perfect the Bible said so be therefore perfect even as your father which where is in heaven is perfect it's a perfect Kingdom so it must be a perfect people come because you have to stand and be married to a perfect Son of God and you must be a perfect bride so how can you do this to anything else but the perfect word of God which is the Waters of Separation that washes us from our sin the blood of Jesus Christ the dripping bloody word it's the blood the word of God bleeding to wash the bride brother said what you are here is ass sign your something else somewhere you've always wanted to be in Perfection you Christian there is a Perfection and that Perfection is not in this life but every man and woman here amen that is a Christian every person that is a Christian here now is already glorified in the presence of Jesus Christ you got another body you won't have some other time you have it right now right now there's another body amen waiting for you if this one should perish I say hallelujah I am a Divine possessor I have come back underneath a perfect interpretation of the word of God by Divine Vindication and there is a predominating revelation in my soul I already have eternal life I already have a theophany I already have a future home I already have a Rapture everything I have need of to deliver me from this pest house from this tab a of humiliation I didn't receive it intellectually I received it by the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah somebody shout amen you say well that sounds mythical he said it may be but listen it's real he said I believe it right here in the presence of his beings tonight in his sight we are all ready glorified those who he justified he ha past tense glorified and what makes you a Christian is because and long for that Perfection is because the Perfection are y'all hear me tonight how let me just get a show of hands how many's longing for that Perfection you're longing for that place where there is no old age where there is no sickness brother Terry where there is no evils that exist you're longing for that place then hear a prophet amen the reason you're longing for that place is because it's laying right out there that glorified body when this one is has moved out you move into that one come on it's just a move friends when this one moves you move in to that one but now as God is eternal he was that perfect perfect love perfect peace perfect Joy perfect satisfaction he said see now the only way we can come back to Perfection is to come back with that Perfection which is god listen then we come to Perfection then we have eternal life Without End or without anything it's just forever it's eternal life see the Perfection of perfection is God now can I say this and I'm turning the corner the reason why these things are so important amen sometimes people say well I don't know why they preach against psychology I don't know why they preach against intellectualism I don't really see the point why they go those places because you're in a battle that's right you're in a battle and it's called the greatest battle that's ever been fought now listen the pr of God said that was ever fought is now ready to go in action amen I believe that God has been selecting his soldiers and I believe he's been dressing them he's been training them when this great battle started on Earth then there had to be a mutual meeting place brotherus I just love that quote there had to be a place selected amen for the battle to begin and for the battle to rage and the battle begins right here in the human mind that's where the battle starts the human mind was chosen amen for the place of the the battle where it was to begin and that is because that decisions amen are made from the mind the head can I say this tonight friends you are the army of the living Gods you are the soldiers who know him you know the god of Heaven not by a ritual not by a form but you know him by the way of perfection because you're living in the hour when perfect interpretation of the word has come into your life you know him in the way of perfection and you know him in the power of his resurrection listen what the prophet said you promised Lord in the last day that that would take place we read in the Book of Revelation at the leoan church age that the intellectual Giants amen they got in and they pushed Christ Plum out of his church now come on I'm preaching to you now amen at the End of the leoan Age the intellectual Giants come in the church and they pushed Christ right out of his church he said and he was standing knocking at the door of his own house amen trying to get back in amen oh God no other age was it ever than that way but it's in this age this intellectual age amen but listen you've got your soldiers harness Lord oh God you've got your soldiers harness Lord listen how many soldiers have I got in the house of God tonight amen you're a soldier in the army of the Living God well can I say this you're not a harness to lay ought of see you you're not harnessed to technology you're not harnessed to artificial intelligence are you hear hear me you're not a harness to the political system you're not harness to the horse system you're not harness to her prostitute daughters amen you are harnessed to the word of God which is the perfect interpretation with Divine Vindication that's why you can't say anything but what a prophet said that's why you can't believe anything but what a prophet taught because it's the only thing we can stand back and say it's perfect it's perfect amen you say preacher you better be careful careful about what it's perfect I met them guys brother Sean they say well you know you got to be real careful brother B said this and then brother B said that and then brother B said this and then and the funniest thing sister Jane is they forget I got my own books and tapes and I know what he said but I'm not harnessed to them and oh God and nine times out of 10 they're leading in a Direction that's different than a prophet was leading so I'm going to stay with what's been Vindicated as the way of perfection the buckler The Shield the helmet the word we stand this afternoon as a group in the minority but oh God hone us and make us and shave us down and take the disbelief and things the world away from us until when Christ comes he will fit right into his church perfectly into their program for it'll be the program of the Holy Spirit they will be led and moved and acts of the Holy Spirit when Christ comes when Christ comes in his church by the preaching of the perfect interpretation you will see the leadership of God you will see the miracles of god you will see the understanding of God return to his church can I just go ahead and say it can I just cut to the Chase and say it amen who are you going to follow who you going to follow are you going to follow some man that thinks he knows something about the message are you going to follow a prophet who has been there and knows what is to come amen I just amen it just kind of struck me it may sound silly brother Sean amen it just kind of struck me amen down there in the in the in the basement a minute ago in the office I got to thinking in just a little bit amen there's some kids going to be running down there and they going to be wantan some candy all right they going to be knocking on the door and they going to be want some candy now listen if they go to that candy bucket and they look at it and it's empty and they run to brother Amos and they say brother Amos amen is there any more candy you know what he's got to say I don't know you know why because he didn't see what I saw I saw where the stash was come see me after church I saw where the stash was I seen where it was hidden so I can say Amen if you're down to nothing I know where there's some more at come on church I know where there's a resource at I know where there's some candy amen so come follow me or follow somebody who's guessing and think come on church are you hearing me amen I'm not guessing where the candy is I'm not thinking and I know where the candy is I saw with his eyes where the candy was and William Brandon was not guessing where your theophany was he was not probing where your theophany was he went beyond the curtain of time and he said I saw you there and he come back and laid the way of perfection and said if you want to see your mama come follow me if you want to see your loved ones come follow me if you want to see the future home come follow me I didn't hear about it I didn't read about it I saw it face to face Hallelujah I saw it for myself friends are you hearing me if you want to become consumed intellectually then follow somebody that thinks they know where it's at but if you want to walk in the way of perfection then follow the voice of perfection through the seventh angel I know where it's at I seen it I seen it I didn't hear about it I saw it I didn't just read about it I saw it now the word of the Lord comes to the prophet right brother said Noah was sent to a scientific age with an unscientific message Noah was sent to an intellectual age with an unintellectual message he was sent to an age of science oh when he had a message of faith and promise to a scientific age Noah was preaching a message of Promise a message of Faith to people who were consumed intellectually they were consumed with The Radars Sister Kim they were consumed with the fact that they could shoot a radar up there and there was no rain in the skies they were consumed with the intellectual facts about how you build an ark brother Tim and they knew that there's no way what Noah's building can survive what he says is coming but here's the difference amen there was a revelation that had come into Noah's heart and the prophet of God said before he started working on the ark he already oh God he already started amen seeing the rainfall did y'all hear that before he started working he saw the rain falling before he started building the ark he saw the rain was going to come so what Noah did was Noah relied upon the mercies of God that were new every morning come on Church you imagine brother Shan Noah out there working on that Ark and what is it tracks on the mountain brother said the daddy would bring their family over there and if they wanted a good laugh in the evening he said they would stand there and they would laugh at brother Noah that was working on the ark you know why they were laughing is because they were consumed intellectually they were consumed with their own ability to survive and end deluvian destruction but you know what got Noah back out there every day brother shemi hammering away was because the mercy of the Lord was new every morning God knew them people were going to drown God knew that nation was going under and God imparted that Revelation into a man named Mo Noah and he went out there and he kept on working and he kept on building and he kept on preaching and he kept on labor because he had been joined to the mercy of God I'm closing on this point amen he had been joined to the mercy of God and when the mercy of God comes it comes with a desire Amen to help The Afflicted and the miserable and Church of the Living God we have had a Prophet come in this generation and before he started preaching the seven seal and before he started preaching things that ought to be he saw America as craters in seven major Visions amen but why did he stand there in the face of UN in the face of scientists in the face of theologians and preach this word because there was Mercy coming to this generation Hallelujah there was Mercy coming to this generation amen let me say this we are witnessing the literal manifestations of the mercy of God can I say this things that we cannot make happen are happening are you hearing me there's things we cannot work hard enough to make them happen we cannot pray hard enough to make them happen but they're happening brother said what is it he said see it's spiritual man manifestations of spiritual word becoming literally fulfilled before us the word of God manifested once was hard to understand but is now made through made plain through the astronaut come on Church notice he didn't say brother Matthew it's being made plain to the astronaut it's being made plain through the astronaut you are the astronauts Hallelujah you are the literal walking manifestations of the mercies of God in the Agee you're living in come on church amen when God oh God when God when God say brother Joe Carter when I look at brother Joe I don't just see brother Joe I see a literal manifestation of the mercy of God come on Church Amen brother Shi when you all bring that child in this church they will not see amen just an idea they will see a literal manifestation of the mercies of God by the promise of God are you hearing me come on come on church I'm out will say it amen in one of these days we're going to take a step brother Mark into another dimension it's going to be more than another meeting it's going to be more than another service it's going to be a step into a literal manifestation we're going to see Sister Kim we're going to see him we're going to see him and there'll be no evil there'll be no sickness there'll be no old age there'll be no death because we followed a message of perfection what are you saying preacher I'm saying the astronaut message is urgent the time is at hand what are you saying can I can I close on this point I keep preaching a minute then the mercy of God called us out of the Leota Spirit called us out of Babylon out of the spirit of confusion Proverbs 16:6 by Mercy are y'all ready for this by Mercy and Truth iniquity is purged I read that brother Terry I about shouted by Mercy and Truth iniquity is purged and by the fear of the Lord men depart from evil evil in Revelation 18:1 after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lighted with his glory and he cried mildly with a strong voice saying Babylon the greatest Fallen is fallen and has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird now watch this for all nations somebody say all have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth are waxed Rich through her abundance of Delicacies are you hearing me there intellectually consumed through the abundance of leota's Delicacies they're consumed through the abundance of what Babylon has to offer but I heard another voice from Heaven Hallelujah I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sin and that you receive not of her plagues are you all ready for this for her sins have reached under heaven and God hath remembered her iniquities but do you realize according to Hebrews amen that our iniquities are remembered no more glory to God our iniquities brother brother Tim our iniquities are remembered no more God remembers babylon's iniquities he remembers her sins but there's a virtuous sinless Bride on the face of the Earth who has received the perfect interpretation of the future home and it is ignited a Revival in her soul and God has forgot her iniquities he's thrown her sins in the see a forgetfulness brother Terry if anybody got a righteous shout and dance is the Bride of Jesus Christ who has subdued her iniquities by his Mercy come on church are y'all hearing me by Mercy and Truth iniquity is purged when God showed up in Mercy and a prophet preached the truth that's right it purged purged it purged the church now you say preacher you're getting way out there well am I can I say this it's of the Lord's mercies that we're not manifesting the attributes of leoan spirit and some of y'all ought to Rejoice tonight cuz you're working next to people who are full manifestations of Leota they breathe Leota they talk Leota they think Leota but God who is rich in Mercy Hallelujah God who is rich in Mercy said through a prophet that the city was rich it was endured by the wealthy it was full of culture science abounded the churches are rich the worship is beautiful and formal but cold and dead culture and education have taken the place of the spirit given word and faith has been superseded by science so that man is a victim of materialism come on I know what I'm talking about he well I might as well preach I still got little bit time Junior are you hearing me amen it's even coming in the ranks of the message I'm going to preach for a second he we got people around the message mission church amen for sporting events and and this shopping spree and this ball tournament I say God have mercy come back to the message of the hour and let the word and the mercy of God Purge the iniquity out of us now you call it what you want to I call iniquity I said I called iniquity you said well preacher how you how can you say that because iniquity is doing something you know you're sitting and you go ahead and do it and any person that's sit around the message longer than 5 minutes amen knows that the prophet said when them doors are open you make sure you and your whole fames underneath the opes of that real revealed word not on the huntting pre oh come on church not on a ball spree come on I'm telling you friends it's time to let the message of the Hour come back in the church and replace

standing between you and culture there's only one thing standing between you and science there's only one thing standing between you in formal beautiful cold dead worship there's only one thing standing between you and being superseded by science there's only one thing standing between you and becoming a victim of materialism and I'll tell you what it is it's called the message of the hour praise the Lord and every attribute ancient leoty is found reborn in the 20th century Le Osa I love what he says brother amamos in the mercy of God May those who have an ear to hear come out of her

Into the way you worship coming into the way you act and coming in the way you you hear coming in the way you believe I say if it is Mercy and Truth is here it's here to purge iniquity listen friends God is in the message to the bride he said it's the calling the bride out of Pentecost he said see now what is it he said called out called in called up can I say this to you you say brother Andrew I want to see the mercy of God God's mercy was manifested when he called you out of leosia if he never did another thing for you when he let you see what you see and he let you hear what you hear and he let you feel what you're feeling and he let you believe what you're believing and he's letting you confess what you're confessing and he's let you sing what you're singing come on preachers he's let you preach what you're preaching he's letting you feed on what you are you hearing me you ought to raise your hands and say thank God for mercy thank God for Mercy thank God I'm not a cold formal cultural victim of materialism a science bound person but the mercy of God has rescued my soul from the things of Leota I'm not consumed intellectually I'm not relying upon my ability to take a Rapture I'm not relying upon my ability to save my baby I'm not relying upon my ability to fix the situation I have come back to the app to the word of God I'm back under Perfection I'm back under Authority I'm back under headship I'm back under the pillar of fire I'm back under Revelation 101 I have been purged by the mercy of God and the truth of God won't you to stand to your feet tonight and give God praise Hallelujah I'm not consumed intellectually I'm not living from one politician to the next brother bill there's a call on my life I got to go to Perfection I can't stay here are you hearing me after this I looked and behold the door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talk with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne B said see watch right here it's a literal manifestation what are you saying preacher I'm saying this as plain as I know how Mercy is here amen the mercy of God is upon your family it's upon your home it's upon your church it's upon your pastor it's up on the ministry it's up on these musicians sometime really Terry I know I get a little crazy but sometimes I just stop and start thanking God for all the mercy Mercy he's bestowed upon a church you know brother Bill if it wasn't for God's mercy these musicians could be playing anything tonight they could be using god-given gifts to rebirth ancient L out of see attributes but the mercy of God is upon their lives young people brother Kevin you could have been playing in a hockey talk tonight come on church one of these days brother Kevin I'm going to get good enough singing I'm going to look at you and say take it [Music] away are you hearing me any of you preachers could be sitting in some denomination tonight bound under some headquarters but the mercy of God brought you back under perfect interpretation and said I'll not let you be consumed intellectually while they're trying to figure a way to get out out of here a Prophet come and said here's how it's going to happen there's been some watches but there's going to come one morning one morning between 6 and N glory to God they've been trying to figure out how you going to get out of here how they going to get out of the graves she said they're not going to come down and dig it he said he'll speak and they'll come brother I want to say this to you brother B said this quote and it's always just down to me brother de just was out in my car when I drove up brother merer and I were talking about the lovely SP at the church and we love that such a fine Fellowship that's very good brother keep that up he said that's very good our pastor our brother here that's good we're talking I said you know he said brother brandom I guess you've had lots of hard I said no the thing that surprises me is the grace of God I said I have exhausted his Mercy many times but I can never exhaust his grace I got to think about that one day brother Sean you know what Mercy is Mercy is not getting what you you deserve Grace is getting something you don't deserve you know what I say tonight you know I I I didn't deserve to see what I'm seeing Sister Kim I didn't deserve to feel the anointing that I feel I didn't deserve it brother Bill I didn't deserve to be able to sit down and hear a prophet say when you see these UFOs and things coming by don't get all tore up that's just investigating angels brother Sean I didn't deserve to be able to stand and tell people across the world that some morning between 6:00 and 9 your loved ones going to come stand in your mirror cuz I was born in sin I was shaping iniquity I come in the world speaking lies surely God could have found somebody better than Andrew Glover to preach this message but God rich in Mercy brother sh we don't deserve it but God rich in Mercy has allowed us to see what we see has allowed us to stand and to preach preach truth truth somebody told me one time they said you know a man brother Sean you man was leaving a message you know somebody called me up and they said hey we heard a sermon he preached and we heard there was a lot of talk about that I said yeah I was there and they said well it's actually a preacher so well you know brother said give that guy some Grace you know said we've all preached a bad sermon here and there I said said brother you're exactly right I preach many flops and I'll preach many more but I've never preached one sermon that anybody walked out wondering if Andrew Glover believed William brandom was a prophet or [Music] not I've been purged by what a prophet said I may not have the best ability to put it together and make it come across the way I think I can see it but I tell you what I'm going to do I'm going to say it nonetheless and every time I get done I'm going to say but a prophet taught it and we're going to stand on it if it backs every devil up listen I've been purged by this message I've been purged by the truth of God I should be God should be remembering my iniquities tonight sister Beth he should be remember him but he forgot him he subdued my iniquities he purged My Heart by truth you love him tonight hallelujah oh what are you playing Mercy oh mercy it reot my life let's sing it now with all of our hearts oh God's mercy not science not culture not education Mercy God's mercy not denomination not understanding to men the mercy and Truth preached by a Vindicated Prophet oh I should have fallen my soul cast down but Mercy it reot my life one more time oh God's mercy how many thanks him for his Mercy tonight how many can raise your hand and say thank you Lord for making me a literal manifestation of your mercy thank you Lord for making me a literal manifestation hallelujah oh I should have fallen my soul cast down but Mercy re my life oh God's mercy won't you just take a minute tonight and close your eyes just think about his Mercy just think about his Mercy that reached down and let you see what you're seeing let you hear what you're hearing you know you was on your way out you know you was exhausted you was spent you were ceasing you were hurt you were disappointed you were sick you were let down all kinds of things happen but it of his mercies were not consumed intellectually he was on your way out the door cuz you was on Divine it was on your own ability I can do it I can fix it I can make it happen but you heard a prophet's words and he begin to tell you that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and you begin to relinquish all control of the situation though it was hard though it was difficult you begin to say Lord I'm going to trust you even though I can't trace you Lord I'm going to follow you even though even though it don't even seem real I'm going to follow you Lord maybe some of you started out on the path to Perfection and people told you listen that man don't know what he's talking about you need to go hear this guy you need to go hear that guy but something in your heart knew that the man talking to you he had seen where the source of candy was he had seen where your body change was he had seen where your future home was he had been there and experienced the atmosphere of that Dimension and he kept on telling you the truth he kept on preaching truth and merging you Hallelujah Heavenly Father Lord all across this building tonight are hungry hearted Eagles Lord they've not gathered here to see a man or hear from a man but Lord they've gathered here to receive from your word and father I believe that your word is in our midst tonight and Lord you see the things that's been spoken here that was up on my heart oh God lord I pray that it would never be said about one believer standing before me tonight or those that would hear this sermon by the way of tape or archive Lord Lord may they never may they never become a billboard for the attributes of ancient Leota that are to be reborn in 20th century leosia Lord may they never may they never become superseded by science may they never become consumed by culture Lord may they never become consumed by science and beautiful cold formal worship Lord Lord may we never become consumed by scientific ideas and educated guesses in the place of spirit filled and revealed word oh God may we never Lord may we never become so consumed that Lord we become the victim of materialism Lord may we never become the victim of politics Lord father when we live in the world we live in and the pressures of the economy the situations at the grocery stores at the gas stations Lord at the Lord everywhere we look so much pressure Lord the pressure on jobs Lord the pressure in the schools Lord our young people in leot of SE in schools being Lord the teachers trying to subject them to such filth and such ideas as Lord 20 years ago it was just that man come from an an ape or a monkey but Lord now they're trying to subject them to women can marry women and have children men can marry men and have babies oh God how did we get here Lord we God here when pulpits laid aside spirit filled sermons preachers become politicians we laid aside The Sword and put on a pair of gloves and tried to handle the gospel Lord intellectual speeches invaded pull pits men tried to break down reliable points to lead people to Better Living oh I say tonight God restore that John the Baptist fire and every five-fold Minister Lord Lord bring back that consuming Revelation Lord that no matter how opposing the culture it is no matter how bad it sounds to Le osia we can stand up on the infallible word of what a prophet taught and say I'll give my life for what a prophet said I got to go to Perfection I got to go to heaven I got to go to the place that's calling my name Hallelujah I got to leave this opest house we got to get out of Leota we got to get away from the corruption we're going to stand underneath the voice of perfect interpretation with Divine Vindication in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen maybe you're tonight looking in the bucket is a the illustration I used you're looking in the bucket and you're saying man it's gone there's no hope is there any more is there anything else listen get back in the message he's seen the source you love him tonight how me S thank you Lord for your mercy I me say Lord thank you Lord I know it was simple tonight I know it was things you've heard over and over but I pray if there was one Spirit of Le or one Spirit of the age trying to come upon us I pray that devil took a took a beat and went back to the hell he crawled up out of you love him tonight you say preacher is it really possible that somebody can lose the spirit of the age and get the spirit of Christ I saw it I was preaching up at Tim M brother Tim mckim's church one Sunday years ago back there preaching just just just a little sermon I think I I think I was preaching that day on the scepter in your hand and there was a sister come up for prayer and while I was preaching I was preaching about the Lord wants you on fire and he wants you fully surrendered the scepter is in your hand and I Sister Kim this sister she walked up and she said belander I want prayer I said well I'll be glad to pray for you she said I've accepted the spirit of the age she said I got cold in My Worship she said I got complacent she said I got to a place that I literally just accepted that this is the way people are and ought to see it and she said you know how I got here she said the devil told me it's okay because it's the spirit of the age now you think that Devil's dumb that Devil's slick he is dumb but he's also slick sister Jane she come up here she said brother Andrew she said but while you were preaching this morning she said there was a voice spoke out in my heart and said but I was not promised the spirit of the age because the spirit of the age is not the promise of Luke 24 she said I was promised the spirit of my father oh God and I watch the mercy of God and the truth of God come right into her heart Purge out all the iniquity she knew she should be on fire but she was cold and proud of it God burnt that burnt that right away what do you saying I'm saying there's a God in this word and he's in his church stay under what a prophet taught Purge the church in Jesus name brother Sean would you come you love the Lord tonight how many says thank you Lord for your word thank you Lord for the mercy thank you Lord for the truth God bless you tonight friends God richly bless [Music] you oh I should have fall in my soul cast down [Music] Mercy re let's sing it one more time shall we oh yes Mercy rroll my life oh yes it did yes it did I so thankful Lord my life oh oh I should have fallen my soul cast down Mercy roll my life aren't you glad for the mercies of God Amen certainly enjoyed the service tonight sometimes we we just forget what God has really done for us and what he continues to do for us that we're standing here not by our own will power but it's by the mercy of the Lord I truly believe it's the mercy of the Lord that led us to this message and whether you're were born into it as far as raised in the message or you come from a different background it's still the mercy of God that you can believe this message and I was talking to my wife the other night and it I don't know I it really hit me of just the grace of God upon my life and but I I remember you know we were raised more in the Pentecostal and uh rim and I my dad had I remember him listening to some tapes of brother brandom occasionally not much uh but uh occasionally he would listen to him but we were never taught about brother brandom never really understood anything about brother brandom I didn't know really who he was and uh but I remember as was uh dating a girl and thought I thought I'd marry her uh you know and I I don't know 17 18 and and uh I remember somehow the the brother bram's name came up that she brought up brother bram's name and it was really in a derogatory way and I said have you ever heard heard him oh no no said uh I just my mom and saying some things and and basically was just saying he was a fraud and da d da and you know I I I like I said I I didn't know much about him or anything and and I told her I said our relationship is over and she's like huh I said it's it's over she why what what did I say I said you spoke against William brandham and and and I said I don't know much about him either but you ain't going to talk to him about him like that to me and she pleaded and pleaded and it was over it was done I mean just right then you know and I I couldn't understand that but I remember later on few years later uh dad's kin some of his kin was Assemblies of God and and they were uh really pulling on me uh because of the young people and things like that so I started going over there you know to their youth nights and things like that and I was leaving one night and to go and I just and I really thank God for my dad but he just looked at me he said Sean I said yeah he said brother Brown said them are clubs they're not churches and he just went on his way but that struck me so hard I just walked away from him and I thought I thank God for a dad that would just let me know but more than that I'm so glad that God struck my heart I still didn't even know about brother Brandon it was few years later that I got married and I think Seth was born when the Lord started dealing with me and we started trying to find a way both me and my wife she was raised in a Pentecostal trinitarian you know anyway her her experience but we just started trying to find a way to uh know more about brother brandom and God just opened the Avenue and we started getting the tapes and things but I can truly say it was the mercy of the Lord that's all I know it was just the mercy of God and my heart burns more and more not that we worship that man but we worship the god thought of that man and I'm I'm so thankful because now I look more and more I see people questioning what's going on in politics what's going on with the world and all that and my heart's rest assured I've got an absolute I've got the answers and I so thank God for that I'm so glad that I can raise my children in in the message and know that God Vindicated it amen and it's absolutely the truth whether I understand it or not it is the truth can you say Amen you love the Lord amen I appreciate the message tonight God bless you brother Andrew amen and may God help us all Amen to to be more dedicated to this message and believe it with all that's within us amen we're going home
