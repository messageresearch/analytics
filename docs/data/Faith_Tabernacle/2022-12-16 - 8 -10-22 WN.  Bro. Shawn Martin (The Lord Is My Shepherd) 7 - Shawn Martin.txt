[Music] this is [Music] [Applause] [Music] store I'm fail in love [Music] amen you love the Lord certainly worthy of our praise our love adoration amen the musicians can be dismissed and I just enjoyed the specials and the songs amen the worship amen and I believe the Lord was pleased if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to Psalms the 23rd chapter and while you're turning there just to make a couple announcements um brother Jim Shoemake from a pastor there in Pennsylvania is going to be having his Labor Day meetings and it's going to be at a campground so there'll be cabins and different things and so if you are interested it's it's going to be um September 1st through the 4th and if you're interested in going uh just I could give you some more of the information about it uh brother Wayne and brother Andrew will be ministering and so I know it'll be a good time there and there'll be meals provided after each service and then brother Jonathan is having his meeting starting September the 29th through October 2nd and that'll be in Lima Ohio at his church and brother Josh Bennett brother Andrew brother Wayne and brother Samuel Browning will be ministering there and I don't

update on on brother Burley Williams uh they're they're saying that he will be able to keep his vision so we thank the Lord for that um their concern is just the infection getting in the eye and so they've been asking for prayer concerning that and also said it it could affect his color the color his color vision and so we want to just keep him in our prayer that the Lord would just just restore everything to him and and I know the Lord can do it amen we prayed for that uh sister Solis Sunday and um Monday morning got a text that the doctors had um said that she was dying and swelling and was wasn't doing good at all and that uh the machine the breathing machine was doing most of the work and so they just gave real Doom and Gloom bad bad news and um so they requested prayer for that and they said if if that was on Monday and said that if she you know her numbers didn't come up they were going to take her off that and they said it would be over and so yesterday morning got a text that she's actually breathing on her own and so she's you know she's still unconscious or whatever but uh that's a good sign of of just just what we need amen I just know that God's able to restore the the sister and so uh today they said everything is the same and just you know asking for continued prayers for her for her husband the whole family and they've also I heard they've got a GoFundMe page I guess for for him and so I don't even know how we would find that but we can find it for you I could ask around but if any of you want to give on on their behalf I know it would be certainly appreciated in this time amen and you can you can always be you know try to prepare for so much but and then the unexpected happens and we just have to leave it all up to God Amen but the Lord is certainly able to and I believe I believe he's moved and I just believe that and and so we thank the Lord for that amen if we could just bow our heads before we read the word and just just invite the Lord to take this part of the service Lord Jesus no doubt many prayers have been offered for this service tonight Lord your Prophet said we can do a lot of things too much that we can never pray too much and we can't to over ask Lord for you to come Lord as we humble ourselves before you asking that you would forgive us of all of our sins our shortcomings if there's anything that would not be pleasing to you this evening we'd pray that you would just forgive us of it Lord and I pray Lord that you would come in a special way this evening and touch your people father we're a needy people as we see the world and the shape that it's in we recognizing more and more just how much we need you and for other helpers just to Humble ourselves before you now and may you just work among his father for we do believe in the Supernatural and Lord wherever you are the Supernatural is for you are Supernatural oh God you work when no one else can father we just commit that into your hands and on myself and on the people is our prayer in Jesus Christ's name we ask it and the church says amen and amen Psalms 23 the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want. he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures amen I won't just stop right there you can have your seats and again the title the Lord is my shepherd and I want to to deal with the second verse he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures and this is just a simple thought but hopefully it'll be something to help you but we we find that first of all Green Pastures and water because he said he leadeth me beside the Steel Waters the Green Pastures is something that the Sheep can't find on their own it takes the shepherd to lead them to it and uh and so what I would call it today tonight is a secret place it's a secret place that only the shepherd knows it's the secret place that the shepherd knows how to get to and we must follow him to get to it right and so we we find that uh uh we we see in the Bible that the Green Pastures is is the Lord's it's it's his in Jeremiah 23 1 God uses the phrase the Sheep of my pasture this ain't borrowed this is his pasture uh Ezekiel 34 31 and ye my flock the flock of my pasture are men and I am your God saith the Lord God Psalms 95 7 breaking in he is our God and we are the people of his pasture and the Sheep of his hand it goes in again in in Psalms 103 we are his people and the Sheep of his pasture so it's his pasture uh and I like that uh it's it's because that it's his pasture he knows all about it and and uh it's it's a place that he has prepared for us to come to he's leads us there it's it's something that that he's brought us to it's like when when Elijah uh the prophet on Earth and God and um uh in the time of drought God had a place prepared for Elijah to go to and so we are his sheep and the green pasture is for his sheep it isn't for nothing else but his sheep ain't that right so once again David shows a a parallel between the natural and the spiritual as we know he was a Woodsman he was a shepherd and he could see God in nature and and God is clearly seen in nature if we would just take the time get out of the cities and just get out in the woods and and uh you you'll find God in nature just take your time and and look around we can see God ain't that right uh brother Branham said his first Bible was nature so we can see God in the Sun the moon the stars we can see God in the trees we can see God in the blade of grass we can we can see God in the in the flowers we we can see him in the rainbow we we can see God in the eagle even in in the way she steers her nest we we can see God everywhere ain't that right God does it make it difficult for us to see him and to know that he exists and to know that he's all-powerful I I I thought of this scripture Romans 1 and 18 it says for the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all and godliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness you know what thinking of that those who hold the truth you know there's people that study nature they they study the the grass they study the birds they study they study all of these things they they study the atmospheres and know all about it they're very smart in these things and and and they hold the truth can you say man in unrighteousness but they do hold the truth and because in in the 19th verse because that which may be known of God is Manifest in them for God hath showed it unto them see you you can't study nature you you you can't look at these things and not see God ain't that right and and then the 20th verse Paul would say for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse ain't that right because that when they knew God and you can't you you can't study the the the the botany life or or the sun and the universe without without knowing that there had to be an intelligence behind it ain't that right but when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened ain't that right amen professing themselves to be wise they became fools so they tried to uh uh uh tell us that these things these things just evolved or or or or whatever and and it's just running Evolution and and and all of these things but but if if that you can see God and so David amen he could see God in nature he could see God in the Sheep he he could see God the way things ran ain't that right so David he's comparing uh uh sees this comparison between God and and uh his people and the sheep and the the shepherd so so he's looking at it and he's comparing and he sees this comparison that just as the shepherd is so is God in a greater higher form and just as the chief ours so is God's people and he began to to get a lesson from these things and brother Brandon many times would be out in the mountains and he would tell us and began to give us lessons of of nature ain't that right a lot of his Inspirations come from nature a lot of the great Revelations that we have on tape uh the seat shall not be aired with the shock what does he do he goes to Nature here and tells us all about it tells us about the eagle and and and the eaglets he tells us even about the chipmunk and and that you know and and all of these things uh he can see God in it all in the plan of God so as a Shepherd takes care of his sheep so does God as a Shepherd leads his sheep so does God as as sheep follow the shepherd a man so does God's people and so if you notice David says he he maketh me to lie down in the Green Pastures and elitists mean beside the Still Waters now a couple things that I'd like to uh uh uh talk about in this verse a man first of all David calls it green pasture a man which gives us a picture of freshness not stale and dried up ain't that right time and it's in the Green Pastures that that it's where your experience with God stays fresh ain't that right he could have just said he making me lie down in pastures but but there's a reason that he would say Green Pastures Shepherd just doesn't lead his sheep anywhere a man but he leads them in Green Pastures and where it's fresh everything about God is fresh do you believe that if if your experience is stale that that's not what God called you to be your experience should be fresh fresh on a daily basis can you say amen that's right in the holies of holies the hidden Manna was put in there a man in that holist of holies and and it would stay fresh for every generation it never got old it never got stale it never got maggoty it stayed fresh all the time ain't that right God also Likens us unto Eagles amen and there's a lot about that eagle that we could we could look to and and see but one thing amen that a Prof the prophet brings out about the eagle is that his food is always fresh ain't that right now the buzzer I mean he'll lead off roadkill he just flies and circles around he doesn't care about the maggots it doesn't care about the Decay and the stink and the rot and the buzzards amen that's just what they feed off but you'll never find an eagle a man uh uh eating something that is old dead rotten maggots and and all that he's got to have fresh Keel hey can you say amen and the prophet would tell us that where the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered together and the prophet said the carcass is the fresh everybody say fresh it's the fresh Keel of the word the word that's raised up and fattened and been made manifest and give out to the children for food he said now the old carcass that's laid there for hundreds of years there it'll be see that same now Lou Luther had a message of repentance but you bunch of Lutheran buzzards see Baptist had a message but you Baptist buzzards the Pentecost had a message coming home now Pentecostal buzzards but where the carcass is that fresh meat there will the Eagles be gathered ain't that right he said remember you couldn't feed a Lutheran back in them days uh you can now but you couldn't feed them Catholic carry-on no sir he had fresh meat and that was that church age ain't that right you couldn't feed Methodist Lutheran message oh no he didn't want that carry-on see it's rotten see the life had done left it and went on into something else that's the old stock that's dead back there the life everybody say the life is moving on the life is moving on neither can you feed the Bride of Jesus Christ Pentecostalism them no indeedy maggot blowed uh uh organizations we don't want nothing to do with it can you say Amen nothing to do with it so here we find that that God leads his sheep in Green Pastures amen what does your green mean it shows that there's life there life is abundance can you say Amen it's a place where life is is is is is is is there and everything is fresh everything is green another thing about the Green Pastures is the rightful position of the believer ain't that right this isn't just a one-time luxury that we have in our experience with God that it's the right position of every child of God amen it's the place where we belong in Green Pastures and besides Still Waters ain't that right David tells of the time that that the bear uh uh come in and and took one of his sheep ain't that right and then he tells of another time when a lion which was a greater power than that of the bear came in and and took the Sheep amen from the fall amen and the prophet said he lets us know where the Sheep was taken from he said the Sheep were taken from Green Pastures ain't that right the Sheep was taken from Green Pastures why that's where they belonged amen but the prophet said David was a Deliverance minister David was a Deliverance minister he wasn't going to just let that power take that sheep away that he would go in the name of the of God he would go in the power of the Lord ain't that right amen see amen and and bring him back Amen to the place where that sheep belongs he didn't belong in the mouth of the lion he didn't belong in the mouth of the bear he belonged in Green Pastures can you say Amen and he didn't lead his sheep and Green Pastures without a purpose ain't that right as I've said before the shepherd doesn't care for a sheep based upon his own needs amen that's right see but he cares for them by supplying their needs so the Green Pastures isn't for Our Shepherd the green pastors was provided to supply your need do you believe that oh it's I just been looking at it it's it's just been interesting for me of what these green pastors and what David is really saying amen about it see so that the green pasture has what the Sheep needs and David went in the power of the Lord and rescued that sheep and put it back in its right place amen as the prophet would say he overcame both powers and you say man both Powers were as it was an enemy to the Sheep ain't that right amen just like we have today we've got Supernatural powers that are out to destroy us to take the sheep from the fold that I think God that there's Deliverance ministers that ain't just interested in preaching a psychology message that ain't just interested in learning about God that they understand the purpose of God and they've been anointed there are parents that are parents that are a Deliverance parents can you say Amen they ain't gonna just let their children go out in the world and meet the uh uh destroyed by the evils of Darkness hello they're going to still hang on to them children they're still going to believe for them children they're going to still apply the token to them children yes sir too many parents are just giving their children up without a fight hello well it's true giving up their children without a fight I'd rather fight for my children I'd rather fight for my family amen you say well how in the world is that amen well I know the devil is trying to get them I know the devil is trying to destroy can you say man and you ought to be aware of that too many of us know that amen and it's easy just to give up and take the take the the easy road instead of praying instead of standing there A lot of times you know why the devil fights you so hard is you're standing between life and death for your very children is true but David was willing to overcome them powers for the Sheep's sake and bring him back ain't that right now notice the Holy Ghost wants to come and bless the people and lead them into deep Rivers and the Green Pastures and things but notice the organization won't let them do it holds them back so you see one of them powers is an organizational power amen the Holy Ghost wants to come and bless you Bless the people and lead them in to the Green Pastures and deep Rivers but the organization won't let them do it it holds them back amen a lot of people don't understand the enemy they don't understand what's going on hello it's true amen they they look at churches all around all God bless their heart they're doing a good job amen and not realizing it's an enemy that's holding many people from the Green Pastures brother Randall said he was delivered from the Baptist mouth I was delivered from a Pentecostal mouth a lot of us was delivered from the mouth of an organization can you say Amen that ain't no pretty thing that ain't a righteous thing amen them churches with their Steeples there ain't nothing righteous about it they're full of poison that keeps God's sheep from coming out into Green Pastures [Music] brother Branham and speaking of the True Vine and false Vine in the sixth uh in this uh in in the sixth Church age said the the True Vine flourished he's talking about the sixth stage the True Vine flourished in this age as in no other when one thinks of numbers at home and abroad this age brought holy men to the Forefront the True Vine spread and the false Vine receded everywhere the True Vine went God gave light and life and happiness the false Vine was shown up for what it was Darkness misery poverty illiteracy and death and as the full spine in its day of power could not kill the the True Vine now you know that this false Vine is religious just as religious it's the spirit of antichrist ain't that right neither could so so the the false find in its day of power could not kill the True Vine and neither could the True Vine now bring back the false Vine to Jesus Christ but the false Vine entrenched itself notice the false Vine entrenched itself waiting for the last part of the last age when it would win all back to itself can you say Amen it'll win all back to itself except that small flock that were the elect True Vine of God can you say man now notice but how sad does this age make us feel as we realize that every great move of God and there were many neglected to throw off the nicolaitan doctrine for the all organized and died then they moved into denominations to hold the spiritually dead in foodless pastures what does this organization's doing holding spiritually dead in foodless pastures they've got their theological sermons but there's no food they're doctors of divinity but it's foodless pastors [Music] hello they're not holding the people in Green Pastures it's foodless pastures and and they're dead spiritually dead the prophet said think of it holding the spiritually dead in Green Pastures or in foodless pastures so that false Vine would love nothing more than to take you away from the Green Pastures they put their own interpretation to it which is fine if that's what they want to do but the problem is they try to make us to believe it as the prophet says it's the enemy that keeps you from Green Pastures you with me now remember there wasn't just one power that David had to deal with there was another Power that he had to overcome ain't that right now if you study it brother Branham talks about the demon power of cancer we're arthritis or whatever the sickness is that is there to take away God's sheep from the Green Pastures amen can you say man often you'll hear Brother Branham say I'm coming with this slingshot of faith to bring God's sheep back to the Green Pastures can you say man amen say so the power wants to destroy you physically and he wants to destroy you spiritually that's right because the Green Pastures is where you belong in Christ Christ is Where We Belong enjoying the blessings and benefits ain't that right now it's in the Green Pastures that the sheep can eat brother Brandon would say sheep food is the word of God Islam's feed in this Shady Green pasture and he also said it's a place where we can eat all our hearts desire aren't you glad for that people say oh don't don't don't get too much in this message don't get to studying too much you'll go wacky wacko you just go loony now you know I I've seen people that way they they get they they just get off the wall in their doctrines and you know when I first come into the messes that's what I was introduced to was them type of people so I was always afraid to to really get into the into the message because you know if it made them wacky then then what about me but then I heard brother Brown say but if you really desire more of God God is obligated to give it to you then I realized that there's two types of people that are hungry there's one that are hungering and they're feeding intellectually and then there's another that's hungering from the soul and they're being fed by revelation ain't that right now you've got to eat you must eat it's important God wouldn't have led you to the Green Pastures if he didn't want you to eat but that's where your diet is can you say man people will do most anything to get something to eat hunger turns people into beggars hunger will turn people into thieves ain't that right it'll cause people to do whatever crazy things because they're hungry you know brother Graham said people when they're hungry they'll eat from anywhere if children and people are starving they'll eat from a garbage can that once ate from a nice table but if they're really hungry they'll eat anywhere but God doesn't want you eating just anywhere God doesn't want his sheep just eating anywhere hello why is it that food is so essential because food gives sustaining strength ain't that right and the word sustain means to give support to to supply to nourish it it it helps you grow it sustains life ain't that right now we know the the prophet says it and I'm sure we we with no in the natural that any good shepherd ain't going to feed his sheep something that's going to kill it that goes back up on the shepherd ain't that right that's right just to think God would save you deliver you from the world only to see you go right back only to see you riding the offense and your teeth are tottering that ain't a shepherd the shepherd's going to give you the right nourishment he's going to give you the right food to sustain you that's why I said he that endured to the end shall the same shall be saved it's not he that starts it it's he that finishes can you say Amen anybody can start anybody could say I love the Lord anybody can come to the altar anybody can start with church that it's he that endureth to the end well if you're going to endure to the end you say well I got the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost has to eat come on fruit that's what the prophet said the Holy Ghost feeds off the word ain't that right the life in you craves to eat and so does the spiritual life within you so God leads us to Green Pastures so that our strength is sustained our faith is made strong not weak it gets stronger our love is made stronger our patience is made stronger our endurance is made stronger than you say Amen all of these things is made stronger you become a stronger Christian because you have food to sustain you Matthew 4 4 says it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth thou the mouth of God so we live by the word of God ain't that right well we can look at the word Well everybody's got a Bible That's the word and every preacher's preaching behind the pulpits that's the word surely that's got to be the word but notice the word that we are to feed off is the word that's been Vindicated everybody say Vindicated and that word that we are to eat has to have the correct interpretation to it now the prophet would tell us thank God for a prophet he says we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine vindication so there is a green pasture when there's foodless pastures everywhere and spiritually dead people everywhere there is Supply to us a green pasture fresh see this green pasture is full of sheep food the brother Brown says there's no ecclesiastical weeds in it now what a contrast when compared to denominations the prophet said they have vast numbers that keep coming to revivals and answer their altar calls but most of them are emotional in their approach or desirous of something physical rather than Desiring that which is truly spiritual and he likened this day to the day that Noah entered into the ark and the door was shut and he says throughout those seven days God tarried in sending his judgment upon the Earth yet no one was literally turned to God in those silent days think of it these denominations foolish pastures they ain't got nothing there to bring the people to an experience with God they got their science they got their intellect intellectual speeches now they're pushing for psychology which that's already been now they're just trying to push it in the message as if though we need something else besides a good old prophet can you say man as if the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication isn't enough hello and no one was literally turned to God in those silent days see they're in fruitless pastures nothing to convict them nothing to turn them nothing to make them aware of God nothing in them to to make them aware of the supernatural most people today don't even know if there's a heaven don't even know if there's a hell it's becoming more common that if you die you just die foodless pastors brother Brown said it's not the missiles with the shiny tips on them or whatever he called them that we need to worry about it's the churches that's what he said I heard him today spiritual food and due season I believe it was it's the churches you need to worry about you need to be warned of it can you say man now notice this means brother Branham uh uh uh uh comparing this day to Noah's day it means that judgment is fixing to strike foodless pastors judgment is fixing to strike I hope that's all right remember Elijah he was sent to a nation that had turned away from God from the word of God Ahab was king at the time he was a lukewarm very religious and did you know even though he was very religious he was the worst king of them all Prophet said he was the most evil King now if you go look up up these there there was a lot of wicked evil Kings before Ahab and the prophet says he was the worst of them yet religious again you say Amen why he was a real modernist the prophet said he believed in religion certainly and he had everything in a Modern Trend he had his 400 Hebrew prophets all of them well schooled and trained God sent him one and he wouldn't believe it ain't that right and that was Elijah he said you can imagine on a modern people like that what a real true servant of God would sound like to them you you now listen to this now how strange you would think if someone was giving you food you would be so anxious to get that food that in the spiritual sense people have been sitting in fruitless pastures so long spiritually dead so long they're not used in their sense of faith hello as I said a while back the prophet said if if I shut my eyes and and and and put a blindfold over them refuse to see light then my boy grow up and I put as a boy put a a a blind his eyes with a with the bandage to where he couldn't see and then he would do his boy and his boy he said we'd raise up a whole generation of blind people foodless pastures spiritually dead people and they think that's why religion is they think that's the way to experience God no wonder they get more it's and uh uh uh Thrills at a ball game no wonder they get more peace and more uh fulfillment in sports no wonder they get more uh uh fulfillment on the job than in the money and in materialistic things religious but foodless pastors in a place that the spiritual cannot be contained or sustained hello oh there's plenty to keep your carnal mind sustained keep that carnal nature alive but we're talking about a Green Pastures to keep your spiritual Soul alive you understand so he said you can imagine a modern people like that what a Trill uh real true servant of God would sound like to them a man that could bring food to the people and the people look at it and say no no no no no no that's not the devil why he was crazy out of his mind there couldn't be such a thing oh goodness they were very very religious they had sincere men they had since their people they was very religious now the prophet would tell us that when he sent Elijah he's looking at this nation very modern in the world laodicea more so yes just lukewarm and God looking down at that Nation the prophet said God knew it would take more than just an ordinary man to come in that age he knew it would take more than just ordinary theology or an ordinary message he knew that it would take more than just an ordinary preacher it would take more than just preaching the word to crack their Stony hearts now I know people say well you know you you guys are getting too deep in the message and you're this and you're that just stay simple you know what deal Moody was simple and yet he couldn't crack that he could not crack their Stony hearts now we had good men in the day we had our Billy Sundays right any any he he he had a great ministry we had our D.L Moody's that was a great ministry we we had our Jack coats we we had a lot of ministry down Through the Ages and we even had real intellectual commentaries uh uh aw pink is one of them that that that could just expound upon the word but God knew it would take more than that can you say Amen it'll it it's got to take more and I don't want to just just mention names but we we've got our big evangelist television evangelist today it ain't enough Church good gifts great men that can really really preach that what they're bringing to the people are foodless pastors it's not enough amen so God knew for that Nation it would take more than just preaching the word but it would take the prophet said thus saith the Lord now notice now God's God was tired of that that that Nation he was tired of where Ahab was he was tired of the way he Afflicted the people he was tired of the way he led that Nation God was angry right now he's going to send judgment but he couldn't sin judgment by just some little preacher with some little theology he had to send somebody with the saith the Lord hello in order to be able to send judgment down upon the people are you with me so Elijah went out with the Sith Lord why he was a prophet he was more than just a preacher he was more than just a theologian I know these theologians could do circles around brother random in many ways in the way they talked and the way they stood in the way they handled themselves but God knew it would take more than that and you say man notice he had to send a prophet with thus saith the Lord and then the prophet says and despairing that was judgment to spurned that was judgment now in this day God has sent to us amen who was more than just an ordinary preacher so you cannot judge him by the way he preached and by the way he said pulpit and pulpit you you cannot judge him based upon all these doctors of divinity that were real preachers God didn't send us a real preacher in that way he sent us a prophet that hath thus saith the Lord and the spurned that is judgment so we find that God would send to us more than just an ordinary preacher with an ordinary message he sent to us Malachi 4. only one time for this age that God promised to send a prophet I guess only one time did he promise to send the Gentile dispensation a prophet and it so happened that he comes in our day aren't you glad for that man I'm so glad for that what if he would have come in Martin Luther's day we can't even hear Martin Luther we have to read sermons or books about him but in this day he come when when when there was tapes made he come when even though I didn't get to shake his hand I didn't get to be in the meeting I didn't get to see him he come when I could still hear the voice let's saith the Lord we're blessed and he had more than just an ordinary message I'm talking about Green Pastures now he had more than just an ordinary message yeah it does saith the Lord can you say man and in order for God to judge the sins of this nation he had to send a man with thus said the Lord he he was misunderstood and he still is misunderstood he was despised that he still is despised ain't that right but to reject that message is to spurn judgment or it's to bring on judgment brother Branham says he come with us saith the Lord there's nothing left but judgment when you step over the line of Mercy now I'm just going to say this do you realize these Green Pastures that God leads us in is the line of Mercy it's Mercy to you God coming to us is his grace to us track God said in the prophet is Grace ain't that right now God's in judgment to that Nation what was it it was a drought for three and a half years the dude didn't even fall on the ground as Elijah would say not even do we'll fall on the ground except at my word so God sent that Nation through a natural drought we are fully well aware that we're in a drought today I think we can all agree right we're all agree in in agreement that we are in a drought and it's a spiritual drought now listen to me close I hope that I can really get you to understand what these green pasture is to us we are in a spiritual drought the world yes churches are the nation is everything people are trying to find the answers and they can't can you say man now notice Amos 8 and 11 behold the days come saith the Lord God now you you got to know that this scripture has been laying here for years and years and years and had to wait until a prophet would come with thus saith the Lord right now we've had that prophet now this scripture is fulfilled being fulfilled behold the days come saith the Lord God not come they're here right we're not looking for it to come we're saying it's right now that I will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water but of hearing the words of the Lord they shall Wander from sea to Sea from the north even to the east they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it why it's a judgment of God upon the people but it took thus saith the Lord to come to sound out before God could send a judgment now notice I won't keep you much longer but the prophet said sin and unbelief by false teachers and modest modernist in the church had brought the place to this coming oncoming judgment what did it again sin and unbelief by what false teachers and modernists in the church had brought the place to this oncoming judgment then they had turned from God's word and his Prophet to a modern theological term of the word ain't that right and when they done that they bring a famine in the church they bring a famine to this world I think Joel 116 through 20 is applicable for this day and age I'm just going to read it and and you take from whatever you want out of it but it says it's not the meat cut off before our eyes yea joy and gladness from the house of our God the seed is rotten under their clods the Garners are laid desolate the barns are broken down for the corn is withered how do the beasts groan the herds of cattle are perplexed because they have no pasture yea the slots of sheep are made desolate O Lord to thee will I cry for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the of the wilderness the flame hath burned all the trees of the field sounds like a drought um and the Beast of the field cry also unto thee for the rivers of waters are dried up and the fire hath devired the pastures of the wilderness now I believe spiritually speaking this would be a pliable to us yet in this day hello the people are crying out for it and they don't know where to find it I want you to know just how blessed you are to have a shepherd the great Shepherd the Lord your Shepherd how blessed you are to be able to have that nature that sheep like nature that would be willing to be led and to follow his voice can you say man now I believe that that scripture portrays the condition that the nominal church is in the church is dried up spiritually speaking he's got the Baptist dried up the Pentecostals are dried up right Presbyterians are dried up you go as we come to town from our house there's a sign that says at a church says don't condemn or don't condone what God has condemned now that that's a nice saying but I told my wife I don't mean to sound mean but there ain't nothing about them people there ain't nothing about that church that God condones everything that they do God condemns they hold the doctrines that God condemns they hold to a lifestyle that God condemns they hold the things that God condemns amen whether they're bobbing their hair they're wearing their pants women are leading the homes instead of the men holding on to trinitarian baptisms reject the spirit of God in the church substituted for programs can you imagine being in a place where God just literally condemns everything you do that'd be scary wouldn't it that'd just be scary but there's people all over in that shape foreign not trying to be mean but face it folks he's got him out there and you know what he's trying to get us that's why Wars against this church so bad that's why it goes Wars against the message so bad can you say Amen the church is dried up spiritually speaking no power why they once had it all right but they were in foodless pastors nothing to sustain it no faith anymore to just to believe God you know what the prophet said prophets are pointing to people to doctors more than they are goddess especially to psychologists churches why they've been in foodless pastors so long that no matter what Revival God gave them it wouldn't sustain it wouldn't hold hello no love brother Brown said there would be a time that only love will be found in the elect why great pastures no Supernatural no presence of God without understanding the revivals that they once had is gone because they haven't had anything to sustain them foreign people can start off on fire for God and give them 10 20 years and they're starting letting things back into their home start okaying things that they used to not okay start allowing things to where they're so decrepit anymore it's just church is just it's just a form they go through their song service they go through the preaching and the preachings too long songs are too long they gripe about this they gripe about that they gripe about that why there was nothing to sustain the experience hello but notice God had already had a place provided for Elijah before judgment set in and this place was provided to take care of Elijah's needs to sustain him and brother Bradham said that Elijah in in the spiritual food in due season he said that Elijah represents the Church of today the real Church of today Elijah he says was cared for in the natural his natural food because it wasn't going to rain now see God knew that the Judgment was going to come is this okay God knew that the Judgment was going to come but he had already had a place prepared for Elijah aren't you glad for that that Elijah wasn't going to be part of the drought so it wasn't going to rain see but according to the word of the Gods see now during the time that he was going to punish the unbeliever he made way for the believer the same thing he does each time in the days when he was going to destroy the world by water he made a way of Escape for Noah in the days that he was going to drown Egypt he made a way of Escape across the sea for his people how God makes his way and where there is no way he is that way then he repeats it he is that way ain't that right so now we're realizing that we're facing one of the greatest hours that history has ever known and it isn't exactly the Warhead with the bright shiny missile with the head on it that we should be afraid of it's the churches we should be afraid of it's the hour that we're living that we should watch now notice but God everybody say but God made a way for Elijah to escape it and he has made a way for his believing children to escape it now to escape the wrath and things that are to come aren't you glad for it I thank God for the Green Pastures Hallelujah and if you notice that place that God had led Elijah to was a secret place and if you notice that place that we've been led to the Green Pastures it's a secret place our food the prophet called it is hidden food ain't that right see they shall run to and fro running everywhere to try to find the word of the Lord and they shall not find it it's hidden to them it's a hidden place that holds hidden food for the Sheep of God ain't that right oh do you love him see we're in that secret place you don't see the supernatural experience do you realize that you have with God as a hidden experience that a lot of people that go to church know nothing about it that it's a hidden experience with you and God [Music] can you say Amen yes it's a it's a public display for the token has to be publicly displayed but they don't know how to get it ain't that right now notice though listen Deuteronomy 29 29 and I'll try not to hold you much longer the secret things belong to the Lord who is Our Shepherd ain't that right you don't have to ask for anything he don't ask for directions for the secret things belong to him but those things which are revealed what belong to us and who else our children oh they belong to us and our children forever isn't that awesome and those things which are revealed now notice the prophet said it's just at that time the time of judgment that God always raises up something because he always does nothing until first he reveals it to the people and he always reveals it by his servants the prophets ain't that right so here though God is working in one end you see the world going the way it is God's working there do you believe it God's given them up to a reprobate mind that they should believe a lie and be damned [Music] ain't that right then go look at Romans where God gave them up to uncleanliness to do those things which is our unseemingly through the lusts of their flesh God is at work he's given them over to what they want ain't that right amen but at the same time God had a secret place that could only be revealed through a prophet the hidden place the hidden food the hidden experience the hidden life can you say man as we close is it possible for something to be made plain and yet the people can't see it we find in the days of Elisha remember he kept me he was over in Dothan and the king of Syria I believe it was trying to go to war with with the king of Dothan dolphin whatever and and every time he'd go to get a surprise he got the the the king of Dothan knew his battle plans and everything no matter where he tried no matter of sneak attacks or whatever the king knew about it and he's like okay this is crazy who is it this is a spy in our kingdom oh none of us sir no then what's going on see they got a prophet in the land over there over there and he knows the very things you're thinking in your bed chamber what so what does he do he has his guys to go get him go get him and the Bible says that he sent horses he he sent masses of men he he sent his whole Army and he they incompassed that whole that whole city ain't that right and the Bible says that Elijah walked out in front of them they were after him Elisha and he smote him blind but not blind in the sense that they couldn't see nothing he walked right out in the middle of them and said who are you looking for oh but they didn't know it was him now you could say well well it's because they never seen him before but the Bible says it's because he smoothed him blind and he says oh I'll lead you to him just follow me and he leads them to another city to their another total mother and he led him in a trap ain't that right so it's possible that people can see and yet not see people can see Miracle after Miracle after miracle and still not believe it ain't that right yes sir it's it's just there see and so we find the prophet said people are so spiritually blind today that the Lord God though the Lord God come down in the midst of the people and do anything and the things that he promised they still can't see it they are spiritually blind they don't know God they don't know his great power now we know to see that in the days they of Elijah see they still do it today God smites them blind and they say today there's no Miracles and no such thing it's all all this is emotion can you say man and they are blinded see they they look at our excitement and our joy and our enthusiasm about the word of God and they call it going off the deep end they call it just a bunch of emotion and not realizing it's fulfilling Revelations 5. hello when the book was open right now as we close Revelations 10 1 7 has been fulfilled do you believe that it's been fulfilled the mighty Angel has descended with the open book the seventh angel messenger has sounded all the mysteries of God have been revealed they're revealed brother Brian said the first thing that represented that Redemption come the lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world and he took the book Glory opened the book and tore off the seals and sent it down to the Earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people there you are oh my what happened the screams the shouts the hallelujahs the anointed the power the glory the manifestation he said if this book Mysteries is the word of God the seventh angel has to be a prophet for the word of God to come to no Priest No Pope or anything else can get it the word don't come to such the word of God comes only to a prophet always malach Kyle 4 promise such that's been fulfilled not in secret but it's been fulfilled out in the open seven times around the world can you say man and what has happened the world has looked upon it and yet blind it they can't see it but notice Revelations 10 8 and the voice which I heard from Heaven speaking to me again and said go and take the little book which is open revealed right in the hands of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up where's your Green Pastures eat it up ain't that right and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter ain't that right then he was told thou must prophesy again before many peoples Nations and tongues and Kings ain't that right this is being fulfilled today in the middle of a drought Hallelujah we're not running to and fro trying to find the word of the Lord we've been set right into Green Pastures with an open book eating and eating and eating to our hearts desire and it's sustaining our joy it's sustaining our faith it's sustaining everything we have need for the journey oh aren't you glad for that oh I love him do you love him as if the musicians will come and while we're eating the world knows nothing about it and even people in the message ranks know nothing about it they don't understand the power that's in the food that we're eating they they don't understand the things that that that that that that is going on notice one last scripture Matthew 13 and 10 and the disciples came and said unto him why speak a style unto them in parables and he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given do you realize the message of the hour is food to one and Parables to another the message of the hour people get tripped up on that they'll get he's tripped up on his human side and there's some that that get tripped up on the deity side and and and and and and and and then they get tripped up where you know how maybe it seemed like brother Brandon's contradicting himself all the time it's parables and they tried to get us to believe there and see where they're at see their point of view that what they don't know it wasn't given to them there's an elect that this message came for when we come into the message I I had no I had no problems understanding that the prophet was a man I didn't stumble over the fact that he said 700 instead of seven thousand that's right I didn't understand you know I I I didn't argue with all of them things I could see clearly that he was a man thank God that he was a man thank God that he was so transparent that he would let us know when he lied he let us know when he'd done these things and had to repent hello a lot more than a lot of preachers would do and a lot more than what laity would do but it showed me there was something about him that was genuine but then I saw a greater than a man I saw God in that man you love the Lord so he says see it is not given it is given unto you know to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he hath see that's why you know I'm on clothes but that's why I I don't look at these you know these denominations as having truth that I need hello for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he have therefore speak I to the to The Parables because they sing see not in hearing they hear not neither do they understand but David said he calls of me he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures I hope it's been a help to you this evening you love the Lord amen what song you did you deserve the glory Lord we lift up holy hands you deserve the glory and Beyond Lord we
