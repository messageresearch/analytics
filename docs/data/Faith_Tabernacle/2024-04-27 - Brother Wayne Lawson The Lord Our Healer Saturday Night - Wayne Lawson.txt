now Lord we pray that you would help us Lord as we Endeavor to speak your word and give your grace upon your children we pray in the mighty name of Jesus Christ amen and amen and God bless you look in Exodus 15 and I want to read uh the 21st starting at the 21st verse here Exodus 15 and we're going to be reading uh verses 21 down to 26 Exodus 15:21 and Miram answered them sing ye to the Lord for he have triumphed gloriously Israel from the Red Sea and they went out into the Wilderness of shur and they went three days in the wilderness nness and found the water and when they had come to Mara they could not drink of the Waters of Mara for they were bitter therefore they called the name of it Mara and the people mumbled against Moses saying what shall we drink and he cried unto the Lord and the Lord showed him a tree and when he had cast into the waters the waters were made sweet and there he made for them a statue you in an ordinance and there he proved them and said if thou will diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God and thou will do that which is right in his sight and will give ear to his Commandments and keep all of his statues I will put none of these diseases upon thee which I have brought upon the Egyptians for I am the Lord that Health thee may God bless his word tonight as you could be seated of course this is where that the Lord gained the name of Jehovah RFI and I want to speak to you tonight if I could just a little while on the Lord our healer on the Lord on the Lord our healer this is where he gained the name Jehovah Rafa now you know that the name of Jehovah was given to God Amen he took the name as his name was changed from Elohim uh to Jehovah of course this was happened in the Book of Genesis if you're a Bible reader you know that the Bible begins in Genesis chapter 1 saying in the beginning God created and it says and God and God and God but then when God formed man the Bible says and the Lord God formed man from the dust of the earth and brother Bram said notice here is a change in the name of the Lord that he took a different name and he was now called Jehovah Elohim and he said now this word Elohim meant self-existent now of course you know that many people know the name Elohim is plural amen and they try to make it plural personalities as a trinitarian but we all know that the plurality was in attribute not in person amen but that person then began to create off of himself by his word and created a son in his own likeness and image and then he took the name Jehovah which meant God existed with his family and brother BR said he must have give something to man amen to change his name like that he give him a Dominion upon the Earth is that right he gave unto him a godship in his own image and he put Adam over the over the over the uh over the Earth and and we find that his name was Jehovah of course now the name Jehovah amen didn't reflect seven Redemptive names until after the fall and then throughout the ages then he began to gain names you knowen the name of Jesus is actually made of seven Redemptive names and I'm not preach on the Redemptive names tonight but but seven of those Redemptive names and of course there's spoken in the scripture in different places but in in and many times what was happening was a revelation of the name of God would come forward like it was with Abraham when he went up the mountain in in Genesis 22 and he needed a sacrifice and there was no sacrifice but his son Isaac and in that moment amen when he was ready to sacrifice his own son he looked in the bush and there was a realm amen and he built the Altar and he called the name of the Lord Jehovah Gyra for he provideth for himself seeing that God now gave a revelation to the Seed of Abraham that the god they served had the kind of name that he provides for himself so then there was a great another revelation of God come upon that name and then of course that name then broke out here amen into the name of Jehovah RFA which meant the Lord who Health our diseases that's the kind of God he is the one that is a Healer now here they are amen the prophet of God said following that Pillar of Fire amen they've come out of Egypt and they've crossed the Great Red Sea and they've been in great victories and you would think anybody following the pillar of fire would never run into a Red Sea you know you would think of anybody that would come into something so uh such a roadblock as it was amen when they were coming out of Egypt you know you're all following that prophet and you're all following that Pillar of Fire of course it's going to be uh a straight ways and there's going to be no obstacles and there's going to be no Winds of opposition and nobody going to get sick and there's not going to be any problems happening that's the way people view it amen but that's not the way the Bible is written amen the Bible said they didn't the more get out of the out of Egypt until they ran in front of them and and and an army behind them amen but you know the thing God did he led him to that place to show us as Believers today and brother B said he allowed that to happen to let us know amen that when there is no way that's when God makes a way amen when there's no way oh over it and there's no way around it and there's no way under it that's when God opens a way right through the middle of it amen because that's the kind of God we're serving today we're serving the kind of God that can open up Red Seas if he he told the children of Israel you're going to go with me to this mountain and you're going to serve me on this mountain so there was no sea could get in their way because God was leading them through it and and when you watch the when you watch it as they was following that great Pillar of Fire brother Ram said it was the angel of the it it was the Lord Jesus Christ it was God the Holy Spirit that's what they were following of course Christ the logos the angel of the Covenant led the children of Israel from Egypt to the promised land it was just a foreshadow as he did in the natural he does in the spiritual today what was it they were following that Pillar of Fire when they come up to the Waters of Mara it's when they come up to a place 3 days without water and when they finally get to water they can't drink it because it's bitter now I don't know if you've ever come into bitter Waters following this message or not but sometimes things can get bitter amen they can get bitter experiences in your church life you can have bitter experiences in your family life you can have bitter experiences in your own in your own Journey amen and find that your body amen is subject to sicknesses and diseases and troubles amen and you'll say well I was following the Lord why have I come up to this kind of problem but I find amen that God was leading leading them to Bitter Waters but he was leading them to Bitter Waters so they might understand that the god that is leading is able to provide whatever is needed in the journey that if there is a healing needed he is a God that can heal if there is a need to walk through a a red sea he's a God that can open Red Sea somebody with appendicitis he said or some anything maybe here's the prescription that Moses read to them he said I am the Lord that Health the they only had one prescription on the entire journey I am the Lord that Health the can you imagine now wait a minut we raised three children my wife's prescription bag was pretty big bag we we traveled she had ipren she had all kinds of bandages and Band-Aids and medications and the prophet said Moses he only had one script bag he only had one thing in the medicine cabinet amen he had I am the Lord that Health all thine diseases because God had so revealed it to them in that age when they come to the bitter Waters they were serving a God that could make bitter waterers sweet and I tell you something today amen Our God that we're serving can take the bitterness of your journey and make it the sweetest thing that you've ever had I tell you you never you never drank sweeter water amen than when God took something that was bitter and made it something that you could drink amen I believe it today don't you the place of your overcoming is some of the best things you've ever had I know we run up into problems and we run into trials and we think well if we're following the Lord we're never going that one day he was on a journey and a line come out to eat him amen but you know what he done he whipped that line killed him and hid him back in the bushes and later they were on another Journey with his parents and and they come through there and they got hungry and they needed something to eat amen and they got to look around said we ain't got nothing with us amen but there was a former experience that he had had and it was it was a place of hiding and was a place of his overcoming and he reached back in a place that nobody else could see and he brought honey out of the overcoming of his life and let me say something today amen the sweetest honey you ever ate is when you've overcome something and later you're walking with somebody else and they say well I'm in a place in my life and I just can't get over I'm going through this brother Wayne and I don't know how to get over it but you can reach back there in a secret place and say I got some honey I come to this same trial one time myself I had some problems myself but there's a God that can overcome let me say something I used to chew tobacco young man but one day God come into my life and he took the desire of tobacco out of my heart and let me say if you're facing that devil tonight amen you can you know what you can do you can stop smoking in a moment you quit chewing in a moment you can quit drinking in a moment amen let's get some of that honey out of that overcoming of my own life and let me tell you that God is able to deliver his children sweetest water you is always the answer to the bitterness of your life and you throw that and you throw that old Calvary into that water and it starts to sweeten your trials amen it don't change the trial trial's still there but it sweetens it to the place where you can drink it a little while let me say something today I believe there's some people been drinking some Sweet Water amen he can sweeten that place of your life but God had to teach them you're going to come to Bitter spots but you're journeying with somebody who can make bitter water sweet you're journeying with somebody that can take the heat out of the Fire come on he let them throw them Hebrew children in the furnace and that fire was just as hot as it ever was but when the son of man come down in the love it he took the heat out of that fire and I'm serving a god tonight that can take the heat out of your trial you might be going through some of the hottest Trials of your life but the God that I serve he's able to take the heat out of it and brother you can fellowship with Christ in the middle of your troubles you can tell him I love you Jesus I can praise God even though the trial is here the furnaces can take the bitterness out of the water he can take the heat out of the fire he can give you overcoming in your line amen there's a God here tonight that is the Lord that Health all he's all of thine diseases that's right you know in The Exodus here we find they come out they went through the Red Sea they come to Bitter Waters now this people this people was a people of nearly 2 million in number it is wrote of them that when they come out of Egypt there was not a feeble one among them now I want you to think about the reality of that I don't know how many's here tonight maybe 900 close to maybe a thousand I'm not sure how many's in this building but you look at how many needs is here tonight and in a group of two million people look at what could have been among them from the old to the young but the Bible says when they come out under this God there was not a feeble one among them can you imagine whatever it was that they done under that token they had eat the roasted lamb and the unleavened bread and when they eat it they eat it with the shoes on their feet and their staff in their hand somebody said brother Wayne where do you think we are in this age with Israel doing and the message here and all of it I said I'll tell you what I think we should be doing we should be eating with our shoes on and our staffs in our hand cuz there's a b getting ready to leave here there a bride getting let he leave here that was a first Exodus this is a Third Exodus but the Jehovah that was in the first Exodus is in the Third Exodus and this time it won't be just a healing of our body it'll be a complete healing of our body amen a new dimension a new body not a feeble one among them now you know critics how they are so you know what they're going to say m Sean they're going to say oh they left the old people back at the camp they left them back in Goa you know they left the sick ones and the old ones so it could look like that everybody was healed you know everybody always thinks there's some kind of skepticism behind the miracle of God God can do a great miracle and and and people are creative at what they can come up with to tell you what happened instead of God healing them I've had phone calls people say my mama's having a stroke right now brother Wayne go to prayer and you go to Prayer by the time they get to the hospital amen and they oh it's a stroke it's a stroke and next thing you know they're call and say well they really don't know what happened just all the results and effects just left them we really don't maybe she was just overheated maybe her pulse got up a little bit no that's not what happened and I tell you what happened the devil did exactly what you thought but there was a Jehovah rile right there that said not this one not today ain't going to happen because God let me tell you God can stop a stroke right in the middle of it that's the kind of God that I serve I know I watched my mother three times go through it but God rich in Mercy stop the thing in the middle of it and turn the thing around because he's that kind of God that's the god that we're serving tonight you know amen they come up with all kinds of ideas well maybe they left the old people back maybe they left the sick ones back maybe that's what happened now I don't know if you've ever noticed there's an entire section of scripture about about them leaving in Exodus the 10th chapter it's when Moses and Aaron go in to talk to go talk to Pharaoh now that's a miracle in itself that this uh that this reject and runaway and pushed out guy returns 40 years later and he walks right into Pharaoh's office that's like you going to the president's office that's a miracle in itself but when he goes in to talk to Pharaoh you know what he does he tells him Amen Let My People Go and Moses is down there saying let my people go because we got to go serve God on this mountain see they had to go make sacrifices and they had to go serve God and they were going to go do it on that mountain and you know what Pharaoh does he tells him he says well I'll tell you what you can do he said I I I I'll let you do it he said see you go serve the Lord now we'll let y'all go serve the Lord but don't you take these young people with you now don't that sound a little bit like the devil today we'll let you have your religion brother Mark we'll let the preachers have church and we'll let everybody have their religion but but but we he ain't going to let the people of these young GRS and he'll let your daddy have some church but the same devil that was back there in Pharaoh was still alive today and he said but there ain't going to be no Revival in this Young Generation amen y'all can go on and do it amen and I can't stop you but I ain't going to let you have it in the youth and I love the way Moses answers him and he tells him he says now he says listen now amen I'm going to call to Moses again and said now won't you go serve the Lord but leave your flocks and your herds here now what good would it do to leave and go out to have offerings and they a't got no stock to have offerings you see how the devil do y'all go and go to church but y'all don't need no sacrifice down there amen go ahead and enter tradition and don't get no sweet incense don't don't get no Holy Ghost movement going in down you see how the devil does don't you y'all go on out but you don't take your young people and go on out and don't take the cattle amen but you go out and serve the Lord amen but you you know what God kept God kept pushing and pressing the issue until one time Moses amen and Aaron are called amen into Pharaoh's office amen and he called for them he said I tell you what you do you go forth from among this people both ye and your children and the Lord has said and take your flocks and your herds as you have said and be gone amen you see what happened amen the devil finally got fed up with them amen because they brought such a flag on the gods of Egypt amen until finally they didn't even want them among them and finally the Egyptians said listen you take everything you got and get out of here because Moses wasn't ready to leave unless he could take everything with him and I don't know about you but the devil has this Bride on their hands until every young person is free to worship God until every Service as the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost on the inside of it listen but it's time to tell the devil you got me on your hands until you let my baby go you got me on your hands I'm going to praise God and worship God until you let my babies go I say Satan turn loose of the youth I say young people God's gave you a freedom it's time to use your freedom use your freedom you got youth on your side I know the devil tells you you ain't old enough to worship yet but he's a liar the Bible tells me that praise were perfected in the mouth of the babes that's where perfect praise [Applause] comes hallelujah hallelujah isn't it amazing God puts an entire section of scripture to the fact nothing was left behind so that when I say that there was no feeble among them it meant they had every sick person they had had every old person they had every calf they had every cow they had every bit of the Lambs they had everything that belonged to them and nothing was sick because there was no feeble ones among them do you see what it was they were serving Jehovah Rafi they were serving a God that was a Healer it was so powerful church that David sang psalms about it in Psalms 103 David sings of the Lord he said oh bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name well bless the Lord my soul and forget not his benefits and watch those benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquity well I tell you if you ain't praise God in a little while you just read that one and you got all the rights to do it you got every right to bless the Lord tonight you said brother Wayne ain't nothing going in my life let me tell you what's going right for you God has forgiven your iniquity God is Not marking down your iniquity there's nothing greater in the earth sins unto him that's why when Paul wrote that in Romans 4 can you imagine Paul killing Christians but it was also the Seed of Abraham how he brought in the promise and said it's not counted against me I am a Seed of Abraham no wonder Paul could preach the sacrifice of the blood of Jesus Christ in the Hebrews and say it's it's every sacrifice it's every tradition it's every Oracle fulfilled in the blood of Jesus Christ therefore being perfected by one sacrifice we are all perfect do you see what he was doing amen he's showing you that forgiveness is connected to Healing cuz Peter I mean David says it he said don't forget his benefits who forgiveth thine iniquity who Health all thy diseases now watch now healing and forgiveness of sins are connected together in Psalms 103 do you see he tells you he Health all that's right thine diseases it's amazing to me amen that God in this great journey with Moses was establishing the marks of atonement now watch because when they were traveling along they they were pretty tired by this time they had travel by the way of the Red Sea numbers 21 and they begin to Compass the land of Edom and the soul of the people were discouraged because of the way and I tell you what if you going to walk this way now you know by prophecy it's a harder way now now look if somebody promised you this was easy they lied to you and you're going to be upset at the Lord but never one time did he promise a fly re beta ease but he did promise his grace was sufficient he did say many are the afflictions of the righteous but God ha delivered us from them all these people became discouraged because of the way do you know if you don't know this you probably sure to find it out as a Christian that discouragement is one of the greatest weapons Satan has discouragement can cause you to not do the things that you know to do sometimes people get discouraged in the in the way you know if you're reader of the Bible when they was building the walls of of of U when they building the walls back in the days of zerubba I BL it's the book of Nehemiah that they were working the Bible said they become discouraged they were working on the house of the Lord now what's crazy is the rubble and things that were there was always there it's just all of a sudden the way they felt about it and do you know things that you're dealing with have always been there there has always been now it might have been somebody else's name it might have been somebody else's situation but the things that you're dealing there's no new thing under the sun now so the things you're dealing with is human and you're having a human experience amen and and and because of the way we're walking people begin to get discouraged but watch what discouragement done to these people they begin to speak against God and they spake against Moses wherefor have you brought us up up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness now for there are no bread neither any water our soul Loth as light bread and the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people that they bite the people and much of the people of Israel died now what was they dying for they got discouraged and begin to complain against God's servant they begin to speak horrible about Moses now what's crazy watch this therefore the people came to Moses and said we have sinned and we have he said I pray unto the Lord now this is a beautiful thing because Moses is acting in a type of Christ these people have been rebellious and they much deserved the dying they had brought upon themselves their own problems they had murmured against God they had murmured against his servant and now they're openly confessing this and Moses said I'll pray for you and I'll pray the Lord takes away the serpents from us and Moses began to pray for the people but now watch this God did not answer Moses's Prayer by taking away the serpents God did not take away the serpents amen matter of fact them serpents stayed there the whole time that were bit by the serpent so what he did is he took the power out of the thing that was causing the problem do you see what God does he might not change the trial he might not change the situation but he takes the power out of it you see that amen you might be living in the same old thing but all of a sudden it loses its power over you come on now you know what I'm talking about you may be the same old person with the same old problem but all of the sudden there's no power in it and all of a sudden you lost all your desires Hallelujah because God took it out of there see God didn't take away the serpent but he provided something with to take the power out of the B of the serpent the Lord said unto Moses make a fiery serpent set it upon a pole call it to pass that everyone that is bitten when they look upon it they shall live and Moses made a serpent of brass put it upon a pole came to pass that if the serpent had bitten any man when he beheld The Serpent of brass he lived now look at this is amazing because y'all know that one of the great Commandments is to have no graven images but now God is using a prophet's prayer to so they could see something with their own eyes that their sin had been judged look at this amen now why was it a brass serpent a fiery serpent why brass brother said brass is divine judgment right Remember The Days of Elijah the skies turned brass remember that the alter in the Tabernacle was braz a serpent now why would it be a brass serpent a serpent was now showing Israel who knew the story amen of the Garden of Eden do you know in the Garden of Eden there was a serpent in the garden but he actually was a man how many knows that how many knows that he was the closest thing to a human you could get and the only difference between him and Adam was he didn't have a soul he's the missing link between the Neanderthal and the human being they they they got real close but they can't figure out what that last one is so close it would amen but you see it was a brother man called the beast said it was a man amen but but it looked like a man talk like a man walk like a man but it wasn't a part of creation it was a part of the animal creation is that right and when it cost don't even have a seed well you never read Genesis 3 then but the Bible said in Genesis the thirr chapter that God was speaking and said because amen because of what you have done he said I'll curse you to the ground and the woman SE should bruise the head of the serpent seed see we didn't make that word up did we that's biblical term serpent seed come right out of the Bible somebody said Genesis 4 verse one brother BL amen the Bible said that Eve knew Adam and bear a son called his name Cain amen but it's amazing to me amen that they can read it like that amen and not recognize that there's some conjunctions going on in there and there's one there's two acts amen three acts and two and excuse me two acts and three children because do you know Cain and Abel were actually twins that Cain and Abel were actually twins but they had different daddies and the serpent was the father of Cain amen and Adam was the father of Abel and that's why they sacrificed differently amen now watch this and when God came to the serpent he said to him now I'll just put it out there for you somebody said well Heen I don't I back up in Genesis 3 amen and the Lord speaking to Adam he said it was the woman and the Lord said to the woman what happened she said the serpent begal me so ask Eve what happened if you want to know God asked her and she told the whole world the serpent begal me and then God said the woman's seed shall bruise the head of the Serpent's Seed is that right and the serpent received a curse how many knows what the curse was he was put up on his belly now is't that something that if he was already on his belly how was that a curse but he was an upright creature he had two legs under him but God put him on his belly that was the curse somebody said well where's the serpent seed today he's in the earth amen you I got a I got a brother-in-law he got a masters in biology he's a a college professor and by the by the understanding of serpent seed you'll know this snakes don't have much bones in them do they but there's one specific snake that has a man's fever bone amen and it lays in it and they have no reason they cannot figure out why would a snake have a human leg bone laying sideways in it amen but I believe God left markers for the scientist amen and and if they would only listen to the message they could they could go so far because God's already gave the answer the missing link is the serpent so God had him put a snake on a pole why a snake on a pole because because God had already judged sin amen God judged the the reason it wasn't a man on the pole because God had already judged it you see that if judgment was coming for sin then it would have been a human on the pole but God had already judged it and it was a serpent on the pole and when they looked at sin being judged brother mam said it like this he said it in this way he said look now he said if somebody just looked on that it wasn't nothing more than just an old stick he said with a brass helmet bead into a snake that's all it was naturally that's all it was and natural people look and they would have a healing in their body I'll tell you something God will give you something natural to see so that you can understand that sin has already been judged let me say something how many you ever seen a healing take place do you know what God was doing he was letting you know there's an atonement for your sin and sin has been judged and now it up as a sacrificed now what did they do they sinned they sinned and they needed an atonement for sin and it brought them healing sin and sickness are one another's attribute all sickness is a result of sin we all know Salvation by atonement but scripture teaches healing by atonement there is not a medicine in the world that can heal you now remember I just I was just in in Michigan there in an arbor in the University of Michigan probably one of the best hospitals up there and uh one of the sisters in our church just had a double lung transplant and I went in there and was sitting in there talking and and the and the and the young doctor come in there kind of intimidating you know the guy spent 12 hours putting new lungs in somebody I don't know if y'all know it but that's a pretty complicated system and and and they live uh it's kind of like a guy working on a Harley one time and a heart doctor walked by and and and he was watching the guy rebuild the head on the Harley-Davidson and the Harley Davidson mechanic looks up at him and had the piston in his hand he said I'm kind of like you ain't I doc he said we take the top off and take the heart out of it and fix it and get it running again he said no son you're not much like me he said the real difference is he said start that Harley and then do that and and and these doctors are doing this with people alive amen and this this young man walks in there he's about a about a about a 35 telling me he's a doctor and we got up there and I was about ready to leave so brother Daryl said why don't we have a prayer together here and this this well-renowned surgeon you know he says I'd like to join you he reaches over and gets a hold of my hand calls me Pastor you know he said here Pastor Let Me Hold Your Hand she and we all stood there and held hands around and we prayed over the over the saint and asked the Lord to come in we got done and he looks over at me he said pastor listen he said now a good doctor knows this we can do the cutting he has to do the and any good doctor he'll have to tell you I can give you medicine but I can't heal you I can cut you but I can't heal the cut life is the healer is that right I don't want to take just a moment I want to thank this tape I say God bless you thank you for giving to the people of this Earth brother ma said doctors and hospitals was a love gift from God to you that's what he said he said it was God's helps it was a love gift to you and I thank God for our doctors now I know there's some crazy do around and preach we don't believe in doctors that's a lie amen I know there's fractions of Divine Healing that don't believe in doctors but that's not the one the Bible teaches if you want to study it now that comes from Christian Science and Christian Science was the one that promoted the idea that you don't need a doctor or a hos hospital they they promote that idea amen and that was what had went out in front of brother brandom in South Africa and had all the doctors mad at the Divine healers because they were they were trying to help the people and they were be called Devils because they were trying to help God's people and all they were trying to do was help somebody and when they heard William Brandon preach Divine Healing you know what happened the doctors said we believe in that kind of Divine Healing we believe in that kind of prayer for the sick I talked to people and took them to the campaigns the doctors believed in this kind of Divine Healing because it wasn't a bunch of fanatical crazy people it is a Divine truth tonight Divine Healing is a Biblical truth amen and it's God's grace to this generation that we would have a Prophet come and set it back the way it was supposed to be you see all healing comes from God if you're healed in a hospital it come from God if you're healed in a clinic come from God heal in the prayer line come from God all healing comes from God he is the Lord our healer the devil never healed nobody the devil never healed nobody I'll tell you this Moses put up this ins sign and he did it for sickness and for sin now brother bam said if there was an animal tearing at you tonight and had its claws down in your chest and was digging out your organs he said you don't have to run and get a knife to cut his claws off he say take something and hit it in the head and if you can hit it in the head you could kill the whole body he said and that's why that God offered an atonement for sickness is he's not just trying to cut off the sickness he would cut off the head of the one that was doing it and the thing behind sickness is sin that's why the serpent represented amen a Divine judgment but it brought healing isn't that beautiful if you deal with the sick the sin you've dealt with the sickness Jehovah Gyra could provide a healing for his people now when they looked upon this atonement the curse was lifted off of them atonement that can lift a now think about this God had him lift up a pole that if you looked at it the curse left you brother some somebody said well how do we break the spell in the days of Moses live look upon the on that serpent if you look the wrong wouldn't receive nothing if you look with faith you would receive your healing now now this became to them as our brother said this morning a tradition and they begin to idolize it but God always wanted his children to have healing that's right so then God moved that healing Angel off of that pole and he moved it to a pool of Bethesda which I've actually been there I was with a I was with them in Israel we went right up to that pool stood there by the door of the of the of the the porches and and seen the the pool of pesda Amen it's it's a powerful little thing standing there and we were with a guide and and and she was saying there's Greek mythology amen that an angel used to come to this pool I said wait a minute lady that's not Greek mythology that's the Bible she said well I'm a Jew I said it don't change truth it don't change truth and listen amen I probably a bad guy to take on a tour in Israel if you're going to talk about the Bible and not talk about the Bible amen I'll say this somebody said well amen how do you know what happened how how listen let me let me just say this to you are you ready to take science and education over written word and this Bible was proven to be have written all the way back in the days of Moses and Isaiah and Jeremiah and it outdates all of our scientists and it outdates all of our Educators and it out and all of a sudden they know more about creation than God they know more about the body than God they know more about everything than God I tell you this they don't know what they ought to know what they ought to know is that our God is the god of Abraham and he's still alive and he's still able to heal the sick yes sir at pesda there was an angel come down there in trouble trouble the waters you might not believe it but it's the truth anyhow and God would trouble the waters and they couldn't see that angel but they could God let him see something naturally isn't that amazing the god that we serve let him see the troubling the back this way and that way and when they looked upon it their Consciousness reged the angel is here amen and the Bible tells us that the first one that could get up Amen brother B called it the first moving of the water it's the first one that could run over and jump into that pool they would be healed is that amazing that they could be healed today we don't have that pool but human beings represent the water that was in that pool and when you start watching a meeting and the spirit begins to move through that meeting and you see the people begin to move under the supernatural listen to me let me let me tell you what's happening it's not mythology it's not emotion it's not just a bunch of rig say what you ought to do it's go and get in just step into the water and let the power of God come on Amen that was just one could do it in that day but now it's whosoever will whoever can come in and can I tell you something you ought to come on in somebody said brother way we don't know how it is brother R said back in his day he had a swimming a swimming hole you remember that he said me and a couple of my buddies he said we take off running on a hot summer day he said we first one in he said we jump up and he said if the water was pretty good we'd hold up one finger meaning it's good come on in boys he said we had a little saying the last one in I think we said rotten egg I don't remember what brother Bram said but the last a pair of them overhaul bib overhauls and he said I just had a nail up there for a button he said all I had to do is pull that nail he said and them old things that fall right around my right around my ankles he said I could jump right out of them I didn't have to stop and take my clothes off like them other boys I could just shim me out of them and jump in amen he come ready to get in and amen I think tonight amen we ought to come ready it ought to take us an hour to get into the spirit it ought to take two or three hours to get into the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost I say pull a pin and come and jump in to the pool of the power of the Holy Ghost can I say it the first one in tell somebody come on it's good in here come on in it's good in the pool there's Grace in the pool there's the power of God in the pool I say come on come on in water's good Hallelujah it feels good Hallelujah it feels good in the water Holy Ghost water come on young people we ain't going to leave you behind come on get in the water come on come on elders get the water healing in this water joy in this [Applause] water oh that angel was there and they could see it naturally moving you know what I'm talking about you see people getting in the spirit you ain't seen in years you see God moving on people that seem traditional and formal but all of a sudden they ain't no more more brother Ram said it's the natural showing the supernatural showing an angel has begun to move through now it's amazing because Jesus Will without be made whole brother B said 38 years he had laid there he said whatever he had wasn't going to kill him he said there was multitudes laying there so you would have thought Jesus would have picked somebody in a little worse situation but he said when they asked him about it he said I do nothing and until I see it with my father that was a predestinated moment for that man who had laid there 38 years with nobody to help him listen sometimes amen it's good there wasn't nobody to help you I know it made you mad there wasn't nobody sometimes it's good that there wasn't nobody to help you cuz if there ain't nobody helping you that's when Jesus comes by sometimes when you're laying alone amen and you ain't got nobody to help you in the pool you ain't got nobody to encourage you Al right in the middle of your worst Darkness that's when Jesus comes I'll tell you what he said he said I ain't got nobody to help me in he said every time the pool is troubled somebody beats me to it I tell you what if somebody beats me to it but listen he didn't have to wait for another season cuz there had been a changing of the Season amen the one the angel amen had come from was standing there talking to him it wasn't just another time amen the very God the very healer himself had come on the scene Jesus is that healer can you imagine when he looked at him and said Son thy sins be forgiven take up thy bed and walk and they said can a man forgive sins now think about this you know in the days of Jesus when he was on the earth that was okay with him healing people they just didn't believe he could save people they was okay with him doing Miracles and healing but they wasn't okay with him forgiving sins now in the age we're living in people's okay with believing he can heal he can save or he can deliver you from your sins but they just don't it's hard for people to believe it together it's hard for them to believe it when it comes together but God promises healing by atonement now if you turn up Isa Isaiah 53 let's read this Amen in Isaiah 53 and 1 for who hath believed I report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed who going to believe the report and to who is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up as tender plant root out of dry ground having no form com we shall see him there's no beauty that we should desire him he's despised a rejected a man a man of Sorrows are craned with grief and we hid as it wore our faces from him he was despised and we and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken and smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were healed now if you look into this in Isaiah 53 if you go to that fource verse surely he hath borne our Greece if you watch that Greek word it actually is rendered many places in the Old Testament to mean sickness for he hath borne our griefs is the English word but the Hebrew word behind it means sickness when he went because then it says and he carried our sorrows now the Hebrew behind that actually means not only Sorrows but the word is interpreted to mean pain sorrow grief or sadness it means the sorrow or the grief and pain that is because what is it it shows a pain that Isaiah was prophesying this atonement that he was talking about was more than just for the Salvation of the Soul it was for the agony and the pain of the children of almighty God it was for the grief and the sorrow it was for the sickness of our bodies amen he didn't just die for our sins he died for the I love how brother bam said it that young remember that young stow away on the ship and and an old fell was dying the captain was dying he said boy can you read me your Bible he said I'll read it to you like Mama read it to me amen he was wounded for Willie Pit's transgressions and he was bruised for Willie Pit's iniquities and the chastisement of Willie pu's peace was upon him and I'd like you to do me a favor would you have enough Faith to read my name in that amen so he asked him to read it different you see it's one thing for me to read this with Paul's name in it or with James or John or Peter or brother brandham or somebody that lived a hundred years ago amen but we're looking for men of God in this age that's got enough Faith to read it in a current present tense he was wounded for Wayne Lawson's transgressions he was wounded for Wayne Lawson's problems amen he was bruised for Wayne Lawson's iniquities come on brother Andrew he was wounded for Ron Spencer he was bruised for Ron Spencer by his Splats run Spencer was healed do you see it takes Faith to read it with your name in it this atonement got somebody's name on it it wasn't just a sacrifice amen a sacrifice just to be sacrificing it was a sacrifice to pay a payment for something like a lady got on the train one time she had just enough money to get on the train saved her pennies to get on the train three days come out of a room one day he knocked on the door and he said lady he said look he said I've noticed you're not coming out and eating he said are you okay something wrong with you she said sir you don't understand I spent my last dime to get this ticket to go see my daughter and I don't have any money for food I don't have any money amen for drinks I don't have any money for anything so I'm just going to stay in my room he said lady didn't they tell you the meals are included in the ticket and you see today people SW Jesus saved me but listen let me tell you healing is included in the ticket healing is included Tonight Deliverance is included tonight there was just one Calvary but it paid the debts of sin and sickness for every human being you know what I'm talking about I'm talking about a lady starving to death amen and they had to call Social Service and come in and they said amen amen man ain't you got any help and she said no I got one boy and he lives on the other side of the world he's something important somewhere and they said well surely if he's got money he'd help you honey she said I couldn't ask my boy to help me said he's my baby and and and and he'd probably do it if I'd ask him but I don't want to ask him for no favors amen and they said well does he ever send you anything said yeah he sends me some things and a prettiest little papers and they said well where are they ma'am she said well I got them over here in my Bible and she went over there and started open up that bible and poured out one of them pretty little pictures and the guy looked at it she said well honey that's a money order that boy's been s you're you're a millionaire it's been here there the whole time listen Church of the Living God these promises had been in this Bible the whole time but a prophet of God came into this age and he said bride you're a millionaire here's the checkbook whatsoever thing you ask in my name you shall receive it come on the checks are already signed Jesus Christ the lord of Glory if you need healing put your name on it if you need salvation put your name on it let one of those checks go [Applause] bad well Hallelujah that's what I'm talking about if you ever learn your position in Christ you will know that you are not a poor beggar you know that your father has a cattle on a thousand hills his name is Jehovah RFA now the Bible tells us the book of Dey they wouldn't allow him to hit him 40 times they hit them every time 30 40 less one with 39 Stripes of the cat of nine tails the Bible tells us amen many of the dictionaries would tell you that it was a it was actually a whip that was a tree and but pull chunks out of it and they they wouldn't even allow a Roman citizen to be whipped with a whip amen they wouldn't allow a Roman citizen but they was going to whip the god of Glory can you imagine amen the God of all glory brother let me tell you you want to talk about a mighty conqueror it wasn't just that he died he innocent amen we how many of you ever liked it when mama pulled the belt out and just tore you up and you didn't do nothing why you would have fussed and hollered and mama I didn't do it and I ain't deserving of this and I and you'd have told her for a week amen but Jesus the Bible said he never opened his mouth and they beat him with a cat of nine tails you want to know why he never said he bore our sins and he bore our STS in other words he took upon him the sin of the world and he was so much God that he could stand there in a human body and allow them to slash him 39 stripes with that cat9 tells amen amen it's recorded in the Book of Psalms that his bones starred at him and his tongue leave to his mouth he lost so much blood that thirst would run upon him and they were beating him and they were beating him until amen I tell you this amen until every strip became until it become blood soaked you know why he took that beating for your healing that's right he took that beating for your healing so you'd have a right to say to the devil amen I'm Healed because Jesus took my stripes from do you do you recogn tonight that you don't have to ask the devil for permission my Bible tells me in Isaiah 53:4 amen that this was done to him and the book of Acts tells us Philip begin to tell the unic this was speaking of Jesus Jesus was the very one I'd say this to you tonight I'd like to make a proposition to you I'd like to propose to this congregation that everything you need for healing and salvation was paid for in the one act of Jesus Christ at Calvary I say that healing was bought and paid for by 39 stripes in his back and I say your sin was paid for when he went to calvary's cross and he hollered it is finished amen then today that Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law you know it's amazing how this Bible is written in galatian Chapter 3 The Bible said Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us and curse it is te that hangeth on a tree I know sometimes you don't want to I know you know how you want to stop before you get there you're almost to Deliverance but you want to stop just a little short you you want to believe but you don't want to get the Holy Ghost you know you want to you want to profess Christianity but you don't want to get your deliver you know what I'm talking about amen but let me say this tonight don't stop short of this don't stop short of every Redemptive blessing Jesus Paid for you stand there till you get everything he gave listen he didn't stop short of Calvary don't you sto short of what it's bought for you can you imagine he's dragging that cross up the hill why he's dragging that cross up the hill you know my Bible says that there was a man named Simmon that stopped and helped him with that cross brother B said that's where the blessing come on the black race he said right there is where it happened amen and you know what's amazing God don't forget nothing y'all know that God don't forget nothing and when that man helped him there on Calvary on calvary's Hill the Bible tells us he helped the Lord with that cross and when our Prophet was on the earth in Jonesburg Arkansas he was standing there one day and it was a little black girl coming from Memphis and she was a blind girl and she got over there hearing on the radio that people were receiving their sight so she got her daddy her Grandpa to take her over to those meetings and in the middle of all those meetings she got lost got away from her family and she was wandering around out in the parking lot by herself blind blind blind and needing help by herself self with no help but God had an Elijah on the scene you know what's amazing that Elijah left that Auditorium and had went in there and prayed for somebody in an ambulance and he was trying to get back in there and he was sneaking around out there and nobody knew he was out there do you know it's amazing that Elijah was right in the parking lot with many of them people and they didn't even know he was there people say all the time well if brother random Was Elijah wouldn't we have knew it well there was a parking lot full of people and they didn't know he was there amen but you know what was Grace he was wearing an Overcoat hiding from everybody else and he walked and watched this little girl he said I heard her hollering help help me somebody help me and brother B said I saw the direction she was going he said and I walked over there and bumped into her Hallelujah she didn't find this message she didn't find her healing it found her and the prophet of God said he bumped into her and said little lady what are you trying to do she said sir I'm over here and I'm blind and I'm lost and I come to see this healer and she said I I I I'm with him from Memphis and she said I got out of here and I'm turned around I don't know what to do know no where to go said I I I just need to find my granddaddy can you help me find my granddaddy and he said I I maybe I'll try to Sister he said but what are you doing here she said well I come over here to receive my side he said receive your side she said yeah she said said I'm a blind girl and he said oh he said well ain't there doctors can do that she said I've been to all of them they said they couldn't she said you mean then that doctors can't help you and you believe that if you come to these meetings and that man prayed for you that you'd get your eyesight she said sir I believe it cuz I was listening to the radio this morning and I heard how a man from kennth Missouri got his eyesight and I heard how another got their eyesight and I thought Lord if he done it for them he can do it for me too and she said sir I'll tell you this if you'll get me over to that healer I'll find my own grandpa he said lady I'm not the Healer but I'm brother bandam he said she reached out and got him by the coat amen she wasn't about to let go cuz this was the contact that she had to get the healing that she needed brother man said when them hands got in there he said I begin to pray and if you ever heard the prayer he said father you remember this is a granddaughter of the man that helped you carry that cross up your Hill one day and her eyes come open brother said the last time I saw her she was I can see well I'll tell you this amen I wasn't naturally blind but I was a blind L of sin and this message got in the path amen and God opened my eyes the blessing come on that race right there races the prophet of God tells us and he walked up that hill as a man do you know how far he went Jesus went up that cross and he died do you know how died he died until everything said he was dead let me say this to you he died till Every curse was broken he died till every sin was healed he died till every sickness Was Defeated Jesus didn't die halfway the of God said he become a full man in the form of man to give a full atonement for full man in other words he wasn't coming for a half atonement he didn't come just to save you he come to sanctify you to save you and to heal your bodies the curse of it is broke let me say this to you tonight the curse of your life is broken under the power of this word amen some people say to me tonight they said brother Wayne maybe I could get in a certain man's presence and they can heal me let me give you let me give you a gospel message tonight you're already healed let me give you a gospel message tonight let me give you the good news you're already healed by 39 Stripes 2,000 Jesus Christ the only thing I can do tonight is to preach the finished work of Jesus Christ till right now Jesus has has already healed you if you could just confess it amen what is it his healing is a Redemptive blessing and it's already prayed for Christ has done everything he can do for you already Glory he can't take another stripe he can't die again because it was good the first time he BL for you one time he was striped for you one time and brother random said if I could get the scare out of the church and let them realize who they are positionally he said healing will be the simplest message that's preached if you really knew who you were tonight and you really know what God did for you healing is the simplest promise that's in this Bible healing is brought to you tonight by the preaching of the Covenant of Jesus Christ the only thing we can do for you tonight is to preach to you he already healed you y'all know in Mark 16 he said go in the world and preach the gospel laying hands upon them that are sick the prophet of God said that is the true church that is the true church the Mark 16 church is the true church come on church amen the March 16 Church you know what I'm talking about them people that lay hands on the sick of the of the of the healing message is the duty of every Christian minister too brother M said if God called you to preach the gospel he called you to pray for the [Applause] sick do you know sisters you can lay hands on the sick and they be healed do you know that do you know there was mothers in brother Bam's meetings that prayed for little babies in the front of the pre- service a woman get it on her heart went over and prayed for a little baby and gave the seed up and said here you sit in my seat but I got to pray for you baby it's on my heart and she went up and sat in the balcony and when the prayer line came the woman brought the baby and front brother brandham he said lady the baby's already healed said there was a woman prayed for her and gave you the seat and she's sitting right up there in the balcony now God heard her prayer and Faith was answered but there might be a mother I believe it let me tell you what the Bible said the prayer of faith shall save the sick now this is biblical promises that Elijah was a man of light passion you said brother Wayne my I I I've seen problems in men do you know that Elijah had passions too he was a man of light passions but the Bible said he would open up the heavens and close the heavens with his prayer and so is it with the Church of the Living God we are able to close and open heaven with prayer do you see this is the word of faith that is preached can I can I say something to you tonight he is the high priest say something to you tonight he is the high priest of this profession you might be sitting here tonight and saying brother Wayne there's a lot being taught here you're saying a lot about healing but I'm sick now look God put this on my heart tonight and I I'm going to I'm going to reach way out here and I'm going to tell you something I believe that there will be miracles in this building tonight I'm not just preaching this because I thought it would be a good sermon but the Holy Spirit put it in my heart and told them that healing is a promise that belongs to them amen and God that I serve is still doing Miracles among the church do you see the Bible said he is a profession of Faith now God never did say did you feel it he said did you believe it now you say brother Wayne but I'm sitting here tonight and I'm as sick as I ever was I got as many problems as I've ever had well the prophet of God said but here it is what you need to do he said you just need to actually begin to say it I'm Healed he said and you need to start saying it over and over until you believe it all together now you say how do I do it he said just keep started in your heart now he said and in a little while something will begin to anchor down in you now Watch What Happens amen now now there's people that confess their healing but here's a prophet telling you while the inspiration is here to cause you to begin to confess for healing what is it the inspiration of the holy spirit is here to inspire you now watch when that inspiration begins to strike you if you're Afflicted and something is revealed to you that you're healed and you see it speak up and say I'm Healed if you're sitting in a meeting like this and you're sick in your body and inspiration begins to come over you and something says to you you're healed speak up I remember it brother Mark many years ago over in Brother Sam kender's meetings and that August meeting you're sitting back there with that cancer and you come running up to the platform you said brother amen that headache I've had all nights gone you said I believe something is happening amen what is he begin to speak up you know what what the devil don't want out of you he don't want you he wants you to suffer silently but God is saying when inspiration starts coming into your heart speak up come on bride why cry why cry speak speak this is an age of maturity speak about your healing speak about the confession of faith of your life when the inspiration begins to come you said brother Wayne I don't know I don't know if it's able to I've got too much I'm going to hurry here amen I don't know I don't know if I'm able to do it but the prophet of God said see it becomes a time that you've got to speak up do you see what Satan would like to do would get us so Afflicted that we will not confess our faith he would like to get us so Afflicted that we feel ashamed to talk about Divine Healing he wants to get you so Afflicted that you sit there and lay and think well I just can't confess this listen to me this Bible said with the stripes you are healed and you as a son or daughter of God have got a right to take every word of God put it on your lips and begin to confess it because it belongs to you I believe therefore I speak it come on you know he wasn't Paul wasn't talk about just the word Paul was talking about the distress of his own life he said I'm distressed and complexed on every side he said but I'm not forsaken of the Lord he said I believe it therefore I speak it what was he talking about lord gave me a sermon last year and amen I I'll give you the title of it I ain't got time to preach the sermon amen but it's Afflicted but not defeated now you might be afflicted but as long as there's faith in your heart you are not defeated as long as you believe this the scriptural promise you are not defeated faith is your Victory faith is your Victory When Faith starts coming down into your heart and you begin to test if our children behind let's not lay our young ones behind let me tell you young people what you got a right to do if you're looking at a scriptural promise that belongs to God I tell you what you do you begin to speak it and when inspiration comes to your heart I've got it if it's the Holy Ghost start speaking it if it's Deliverance start speaking speaking it if it's healing start speaking it and the devil don't want you to see that's why he brings temptation to sin is that right amen how many you boys got saved how many of you saved got the Holy Ghost have you still had Temptations look out across this crowd Elders have you ever had Temptation since you got saved now some people will say you the idea once you get saved there's no more Temptation they lying to you but there is Temptation behind salvation but because you believe in salv and you call it a ly vanity and you say what I want is to serve God what I want is to serve the Bible come on then it's the same thing with healing amen you could be healed and still have symptoms you could be healed completely healed and still pain comes into your body but God is looking for somebody that will ignore the symptoms that will call it lying vanities and begin to testify of the word of God I'm Healed I'm Healed I'm Healed I'm saved I'm saved by an atonement of the blood of Jesus Christ I'm not saved because I feel like it I'm not healed because I feel like it I'm Healed because of Calvary I'm saved because of Calvary oh it's the blood the blood nothing like the blood let's not leave our young people behind come on let's not leave them behind forol folks when you begin to testify I tell you what brother random said it was he said it was like taking a steak he said and you drive down that steak and maybe you do it right here tonight and you've been needing something from God take a steak out of your purse put it on the ground and drive it in and every time after you leave this building Satan says you didn't get healed you didn't get saved you take that devil and if you need to you drive right back down to Virginia you walk him right over to this area and you say devil right there right there is where it happened right there is where it took place right there is where it happened Hallelujah you can drive a state tonight in the Blessed promise of the power of the Holy [Applause] Ghost you say well I don't believe in that stuff God does one day he said I'm going to heal my children I'm going to save my children and he drove a steak in the ground and put his son on the steak and by the blood of that sacrifice now every one of you can tell the devil right there at Calvary Satan that's where God saved me that's where God healed me that's where God said listen I don't know if you're hearing me it's not just you saying you're healed God says you're healed a problems everywhere come on there's problems everywhere ask balam about it he spends his life studying with B to find some problem in the church but you know what's matter with Bao and Bam they're looking at the wrong thing they're looking at the problem but God raised up a Brazen Serpent and said look at this Hallelujah let's lift up Calvary and say to the people look at this I know calvary's a long ways from you tonight and you're saying brother Wayne how and then can I see something natural amen that's why there's five manifestations of the third pole that's why God let a sex born man amen create squirrels by the spoken word that's why he let him speak to a tumor and let him speak to a mountain and raise a dead fish the curse has ended woo glory be to God by the power of the blood as Moses lifted it up it's time for you and I to lift up the son of man testimonies of the blinded eyes don't you let the devil Rob that out of your memory oh I know people people forget they forget what it's like just study a little while read newspapers and magazines a little while amen people trying to say what ain't in the newspapers you know and they don't think Jeffersonville uh uh bridge fallings in the not it's not the newspaper s but what was in the newspaper we're going to or ignore all that come see me I got hundreds of newspaper articles where a prophet went up through Canada amen and and I was actually trying to do this and amen it was it was fruitless actually because I was trying to figure out with Elisha and Elijah you know there was double Miracles it was like 8 and 16 I think amen and I was thinking about brother brandom and I was going to compare the book of Acts to brother Ram's Ministry and I was going to see if it was double but I found out just in one year of 1947 after the angel appeared to him there was over 150,000 outstanding miracles in one year and the bi and and and and the newspaper said and they're too numberous to put in the books in one year in 1947 you know what brother Ram said he said God did more in my Ministry than he did in his own Amen in Jerusalem but you know this Bible said yet a little while and the world see me no more but ye shall see me I will be with you even in you until the end of the the age and because I go away unto my father these Works shall you do and greater [Applause] works you said preacher I don't know about this I know you got some symptoms tonight I know I know but let me ask you something Have you ever ever read the Book of Jonah but he said there ain't none of you in the shape Jonah was in he said Jonah's symptoms were so powerful that he was literally in the belly of a well and everywhere he looked he saw seaweed he said and there ain't none of us in that bad a shape tonight but do you know what Jah they would be delivered that was the promise right amen do you know what the Bible says in the Book of Jonah the Bible in the Book of Jonah said that those Billows and babes can pass me about and he said I am cast out of thy sight but yet will I look again but yet will I look again listen maybe you've made up your mind amen that you got to live with this this sickness in your body I'm I'm asking you tonight to look again maybe you've decided you're going to have to live your whole life with that problem maybe that lust Spirit you're going to you said I've got to have to live my whole life it's a lie I'm asking you to look again at this atonement look again at the Blessed power of Salvation look again there's there been a lot of men look at him and they've seen a lot of things when bmus looked barus saw his Deliverance when Jonah looked he saw a Deliverance out of the belly of the well and tonight I believe that maybe you've got symptoms I know symptoms are there but let me say something to you tonight your symptoms is like a box of rattlesnakes now what did Brother maybe that TB has come to your house maybe that cancer has come to your house maybe that maybe that problem has come right to your front door brother man said but when it arrives he said you take a look at it and you say it don't belong to me don't you lay claim to that box of rattlesnakes listen to me young people amen don't you lay claim to it you tell the devil take it back take it back I don't want nothing to do with it it try to Satan try to hand you something like that listen if I tried to hand you a box of Ratt snakes would you take them no then why would you just lay down I'm he just going to come and I'm just going to hand you some anxiety would you like it here and man it come to your house surely it belongs to you no wrong address a Son of God lives here listen amen you've got a right to say to the devil wrong address and I say to the devil tonight I'm prayer line there's a Powerhouse of Sons and Daughters of God and here Satan take your leave listen if you're looking at your symptoms tonight you got to write for your for your heavy heartedness and your grief and if you're looking for your symptoms tonight you got a reason to walk around and maybe think that nothing could happen but let me say something to you tonight if you was able tonight to look above your circumstances and you were able to look around and begin to see what God has done for you and you begin to be able to confess the confession of God and you don't look at your symptoms do you know that you could right now begin to begin to praise God for a he oh I know I know what the devil's up to he puts some Fanatics around praise so that people begin to get fearful of Praise but that ain't nothing but an Old Devil because the devil knows that when the children of God begin to praise God the Bible said he would inhabit the praise of his people listen if there's no Spirit quing down your praise listen it's the devil I don't have to ask you a name I don't have to ask you what church I can tell you it come from the pits of hell because the devil don't want you praising God because when a saint begins to praise God God comes right down do you know the Bible actually says that God inhabits the praise of his people and the word habit actually means he sets up a throne so you you look around at this and you look at a situation tonight your sick body and you say brother Wayne Amen I I I can't see any way out of this and I'm just sick and my mind's sick and my body's sick and everything sick let me tell you how do I do it you begin to lift your hands and you begin to praise God and all of a sudden you just set a seat down for the almighty God and God himself will come all the way out of Glory to come down in the church when you begin to praise God you begin to put God in your situation you know what that is when that begin to praise God like that it begins to invite you begin to invite God into your situation how many wants God in it how many wants God into it let me let me give you some Bible I'm closing let me give you some Bible right here do you know praise is an actual weapon against the devil do y'all know it do you know praise is involved in Temple Worship in the Bible that he literally had 4,000 Levites handpicked just to play instruments and sing 4,000 of them the only job they had was to play instruments and sing because praising God Amen brought the presence of God upon the scene one day they and when that Army began to come amen the man of God the king went down to the house of God and begin to pray and said Lord we the Seed of Abraham we're your children you said Lord and if we would pray that you would hear us from heaven and God began to speak back to him he said this is not your battle this battle belongs to the lord and there was a great company coming against him and God said to him you send out the Levites amen now there was certain Levites that David had picked that the only thing they done was praise and worship and he said I tell you what you do you appoint them and put them out front and when they begin to move out front of the church the Bible tells us that by the time the army of the Lord got there amen all of their enemies was all already dead they killed their Enemy by praising God do you know when you begin to praise God sicknesses begin to die when you begin to praise God anxiety begins to die when you begin to praise God and you say God is my peace amen nervous Spirits begin to leave the building I say in the name of the Lord Jesus Satan you have been defeated thou nervous spirit I rebuke you by the power of the Living God set her free oh look at the anointing of God as people begin to praise Him amen all of a sudden things begin to shift in the Supernatural Realms things begin to what is it it's because that praise becomes a weapon to the believer when you begin to praise him you begin to invite him into your situation I say tonight that his name is Jehovah Gyra but his name is also Jehovah RI I'm sitting here today as a witness to you I come to you tonight not just as someone who has read about these things but after years of traveling and preaching and proclaiming the power of the atoning power Jesus Christ we have seen Miracles we have seen the anointing of God look look I I was just texting brother Donnie Reagan this morning he said right in the middle of the service he said one of the Saints passed and died right back in the back of the church said the saints went back there and put their hands on them and God raised them up from the dead people say where is the god that raises the dead well the other day he was out there at Happy Valley where's the god that heals TB where's the god of Elijah wasn't that what Elijah said I don't just want the reignment was the god of Elijah brother said that God of Elijah was the god that gave the shite woman her baby and raised him from the dead amen I'm sitting here tonight a personal witness I got a three-year-old grandbaby in this place right now that Zach and Anna couldn't have that baby three or four mes carriages God gave a vision brother Ron Spencer and he spoke over her amen somebody said well was it of the lord well we got the baby back there if somebody wants to see it I got a baby back there she's a beautiful little curly-headed blackhaired girl and she can talk to you she walks she loves her papa but we told that God of Elijah and and and brother Nathan Ericson heard that and was down there in a prayer line and Nathan Bryce and the power of God come in there and healed his body and he had a little Rosie but when he was sitting in the meeting the holy spirit said you're going to have a boy so when he had the little girl he was like well I was going to have a baby at least and now you know what right here coming to the end of May they're going to have a little boy amen somebody said well brother Wayne what's the miracle if you would know what the doctor's report was you would know that God did a miracle he wasn't supposed to be able to have another baby but God's giving two more babies because our God is the god of Elijah you know what I done I told that testimony in Cloverdale Bible Way and a man said was selling those testimonies of god-given people babies he said the inspiration fell into my heart and God spoke to him he said thou shal have a son and thou sh call his name Samuel and when God began to give him a baby amen that was a devil attacked her mind and she started going blind every few seconds I remember I was somewhere I I think I was in Canada actually when I got the call and we stopped right there and we called them and begin to have prayer over the phone and you know what come to find out those those to it at all amen what is it was it just a freak accident no I say not I say that God of Miracles got on the scene and changed it sure you know about Mariah you know about Mariah puit with that alopecia how she didn't have hair come through a prayer line God gave had talking to brother Daryl Ward today he said brother way you sent me a picture of a little boy had the same disease of alopecia come up on the prayer line brother Daryl had prayer with him and the thing completely left the boy and today he's got a full head of hair I said mother dale you seen God heal cancer lately he said the other day I prayed for a lady had F four stage cancer and today she tells me she's completely healed God is still healing cancer God is still giving fertility God is still causing the paralyzed to get up out of the wheelchairs I'm talking that little family Amen brother Daryl Ward actually Prayed For taz's Mama I don't know where Taz is I can't see you right there he is taz's Mama had a big old tumor behind her ear I got the pictures if you want to see them big old knot like this and she tried to cover it with her hair brother Dale come up one time brother Rays Ericson's there where we're at in true wor and he laid his hand on the sister and began to pray about 3 days later she said it be to scab up and all of a sudden it be to fall off a piece at a time and she'll pull her hair back and say look here brother Wayne it's completely healed and you see a big old tumor with a knot but after prayer amen the god of Heaven dried the life up in that tumor and it fell off of the woman because God is still a miracle working him when you got symptoms worship Him anyhow when it looks impossible he's a god of the impossible oh sure sure amen somebody said well it wasn't proven to be cancer what about it what about our sister uh what's her name from mother Tims there had the lung canc pictures of the lung full of cancer and after the prayer of the sick you can see a cancer a cancers completely left the lungs somebody said what happened to it I'll tell you it wasn't the doctor's medicine and I love doctors and I thank God for doctors amen but when God gets involved it leaves it just leaves preacher does it brother taz's Sons Tyler Tyler and and uh Tyler

special Grace they got home that day and they was all sitting talking around turn around how the angel came in the room that day and they were discussing the power of God how it just fell in the church and they were all talking like that and all of a sudden if I get my story right all of a sudden Troy set up on the edge of the couch he said just as then he heard himself turn around and look at Sarah and he said I don't know what it was that you were wanting but in the name of the Lord receive it whatever you've been asking for receive it amen and she was sitting there saying in her heart I wished I could have been a part of that this morning but the Holy Spirit was so mindful of her they took a deacon out of our church and by the spoken word amen her body was uses preachers and God
