[12:35] you here today. ask him that you'll
[12:37] bless this offering that's about to be
[12:38] taken up. Lord, bless all those that can

[15:55] [Music]

[20:36] Heat. Heat.
[20:54] [Music]
[20:57] I met a man the other day and he looked
[21:00] at me and said, "So many times I've seen
[21:05] your kind
[21:07] before." Uhhuh. He said, "You can't do
[21:10] this and you can't do that. You're bound
[21:13] by rules and restrictions. What a jury
[21:16] life a Christian must
[21:21] observe. But I looked him in the eye. I
[21:23] said, "You're wrong. I can do anything.
[21:26] I can turn you on. I can smoke till my
[21:29] eyes turn red and my face turns
[21:32] blue. Oh, I can chew any dip. I can
[21:36] snore down and cuss. I can't party and
[21:38] drink till the sun comes up. that
[21:40] there's better things in life I'd rather
[21:44] do. And oh, I choose to be a Christian
[21:49] and I choose to be like
[21:51] him. And nobody's making me do it. This
[21:55] is how I want to
[21:57] live. You decide for you and I decide
[22:03] for me. I said the choice is mine and
[22:06] this is what I choose to be.
[22:10] Well, I must admit that from time to
[22:13] time, the God of heaven keep me towing
[22:16] that line that the Lord is coming. It
[22:18] sounds too good to be
[22:20] true. Mhm. But if we're all just a fairy
[22:25] tale and there was no heaven and there
[22:27] was no hell, I could still be happy
[22:30] living like I do. And so I choose to be
[22:36] a Christian and I choose to be like him.
[22:40] And nobody's making me do it. This is
[22:43] how I want to
[22:45] live. You decide for you and I decide
[22:50] for me. I say the choice is mine and
[22:54] this is what I choose to be.
[22:58] So don't look at me in
[23:01] sympathy and think that I've been
[23:04] cheated for not doing all those things
[23:07] that you call
[23:09] fun. Oh, sometimes when you're headed
[23:13] down on the darkest side of
[23:16] town, look for
[23:19] me. out of here
[23:22] and I choose to be a Christian and I
[23:26] choose to be like him and nobody's
[23:30] making me do it. This is how I want to
[23:34] live. You decide for you and I'll decide
[23:40] for me. I said the choice is mine and
[23:43] this is what I choose to be. Oh yes. And
[23:47] I choose to be a Christian. And I choose
[23:51] to be like him. And nobody's making me
[23:54] do it. This is how I want to
[23:58] live. You decide for you and decide for
[24:03] me. I said the choice is mine and this
[24:06] is what I choose to
[24:09] be. I said the choice is mine and this
[24:12] is what I choose to be.
[24:18] [Music]
[24:28] Amen. No one's making you choose Christ.
[24:30] Amen. There's something that's within
[24:32] you that's chosen him.
[24:35] Amen. Can we sing that song?
[24:40] Um, it was a great thing.
[24:48] It was a great
[24:50] thing that he did for
[24:54] me. Oh, it was a great
[24:58] thing how he set me
[25:02] free. Jesus died and rose again. So the
[25:08] whole world to see that it was a great
[25:13] thing that he did for
[25:16] me. Oh, it was a great day that he did
[25:22] for
[25:23] me. Yes, it was a great day that he set
[25:29] me free.
[25:32] Oh Jesus died and rose
[25:36] again so the whole wide world can see
[25:42] it that he did for
[25:46] me. It was a great
[25:50] thing that he did for me.
[25:54] Brother Larry Jerus was
[25:57] amazing. How he set me
[26:01] free. Oh
[26:03] Jesus rose
[26:05] again. So the whole I see that it was a
[26:10] great
[26:12] thing that he did for me. Sing

[34:34] burdens down, Lord, since I
[34:37] laid my burdens down. Oh, I'm feeling
[34:42] better.
[34:44] Oh, so much
[34:45] better since I laid my heart down. Oh,
[34:51] I'm feeling
[34:53] better. Oh, so much
[34:56] better since I
[34:58] laid my burdens
[35:01] down. Can you give the Lord a hand clap
[35:04] of
[35:05] praise? Oh my, I'm feeling so much
[35:08] better since I laid those burdens down.
[35:12] Amen. Hallelujah.
[35:18] [Music]
[35:24] Amen. As we get ready to turn it over to
[35:26] our
[35:28] pastor whose
[35:31] report will you believe.
[35:41] I said,
[35:42] "Who report will you
[35:47] [Music]
[35:52] believe?" I'm going to ask you again.
[35:55] Oh, who report will you
[36:03] [Music]

[36:09] his report says I am healed. His report
[36:16] says I am healed. His report says I am
[36:23] free. His report says
[36:27] victory. Oh, whose report will you
[36:32] believe?
[36:36] [Music]
[36:38] I said, "Who report will you
[36:46] believe?" I said, "Who report will you
[36:51] [Applause]
[36:52] [Music]
[36:55] believe?" Oh, for his report says, "I am
[37:01] healed." His report says I am shield.
[37:07] His reborn says I am free. His report
[37:14] says

[37:25] free. His
[37:28] report I
[37:30] am his report says
[37:34] victory. Well, whose report are you
[37:39] going to
[37:44] believe? Oh, who report will you
[37:53] believe? Say it again. Whose report will
[37:58] you

[38:33] It's his report. Hallelujah. And I
[38:37] believe his report. Hallelujah. Well, do
[38:41] you love him?
[38:43] Amen. I've certainly enjoyed the songs.
[38:46] Amen. And the worship. Amen. I tell you
[38:49] what, there's one thing about God's
[38:51] people. They love to worship. But you're
[38:54] already represented in the Bible for
[38:57] this day. For John represented you when
[39:00] the book was open and he saw his name in
[39:03] that book. There was nothing that would
[39:06] keep him from
[39:08] worshiping. He knew then that the lamb
[39:11] was truly
[39:12] worthy. I say the lamb is worthy. Worthy
[39:16] enough to erase my past. worthy enough
[39:20] to make a a a a declaration that I am
[39:24] justified. Never done it in the first
[39:27] place. Church, we've got something to
[39:29] worship about. Can you say amen? Did you
[39:32] enjoy the service last
[39:34] night? Bless the name of the Lord. The
[39:38] power of
[39:40] God. Amen. The power in its fullness.
[39:44] You know, the the Bible does say that
[39:46] the that they see the Son of Man coming
[39:49] with power and great glory. And it's
[39:52] it's not just a power to get you excited
[39:56] and emotional. Amen. But it's a power I
[40:00] I was thanking Brother Bran.
[40:01] He said, uh, Jesus is so close to coming
[40:05] to the earth now until his power has
[40:08] began to catch the people and winding
[40:11] them up and getting them ready for the
[40:14] bride, getting ready to be caught up in
[40:18] the rapture. A church that'll fit just
[40:21] exactly to be taken up. and through its
[40:25] power will draw all the rest of them
[40:28] that's born again out of the earth.
[40:31] Jesus is
[40:33] coming. How many feels that power? You
[40:37] got that power inside of you. It's
[40:39] bearing witness that Jesus is coming.
[40:42] It's drawled us out of the
[40:43] denominations. It's draw us out of
[40:45] creeds and dogmas. Got us away from all
[40:48] the man-made ideas and religion and
[40:51] formality and all of these things. That
[40:53] power is within us getting us ready for
[40:56] the coming catching away. And I'm so
[40:59] glad for that. It won't be too much
[41:03] longer. We got to keep pressing on,
[41:05] don't we? Amen. I am uh just privileged
[41:09] to uh have Jonathan uh my younger
[41:13] brother to come and minister to us
[41:15] today. And uh I certainly love and
[41:19] appreciate him not just because he's my
[41:22] younger brother uh but uh uh because of
[41:26] the love that he has for the message of
[41:29] the hour. And I'm privileged to have uh
[41:35] parents and uh that love the message
[41:40] uh my brothers and sister and the
[41:43] families. We just love the message.
[41:46] can't can't can't uh preach it hard
[41:49] enough, can't can't declare the message
[41:52] strong enough. And God has raised up
[41:55] Jonathan and and has given him just a
[41:58] wonderful ministry
[42:00] uh anointed uh man of God. And I know if
[42:04] you haven't heard him before, you're
[42:06] going to really be blessed today. And uh
[42:09] if you've heard him, you're still going
[42:11] to be blessed today. And uh and so as as
[42:15] Jonathan would come, let's just sing
[42:18] this song uh only believe all things are
[42:21] possible. You know, brother
[42:24] Brandham, he had waiting on the angel of
[42:27] the Lord and he was just talking and he
[42:30] said, "Now I'm waiting on him." And and
[42:32] then he asked, I believe it was the
[42:34] sister playing the piano said, "Could
[42:36] you just sing that? Just start playing
[42:38] that song, Only Believe." He said, 'The
[42:41] angel of the Lord loves that song. Amen.
[42:45] And uh I think that's fitting for today.
[42:49] Amen. Oh,
[42:53] only
[42:56] believe.
[42:58] Only
[43:00] [Music]
[43:02] believe. All
[43:04] things are possible.
[43:07] [Music]
[43:10] Only

[43:34] Hallelujah. Say it now.
[43:38] Lord, I believe. I'm a
[43:44] believer.
[43:47] Hallelujah. All things are
[43:51] [Music]
[43:52] possible. No matter what you have need
[43:55] of, all you have to do is just believe.
[43:57] You don't have to try to figure it out.
[43:59] Just
[44:01] believe. Don't have to wonder when it's
[44:04] going to be. Just believe. God will take
[44:06] care of the
[44:09] rest. And all things are
[44:15] possible.
[44:18] Holy. Oh yes.
[44:23] Jesus is
[44:26] here.
[44:27] [Applause]
[44:28] Jesus is here.
[44:33] All things are
[44:36] [Music]
[44:37] possible.
[44:39] Jesus is
[44:41] here. Oh,
[44:45] Jesus is
[44:47] here. I know
[44:50] Jesus is
[44:53] here and all things are possible.
[44:58] [Music]
[45:01] Jesus only believe. Yes.
[45:08] Only it's all you have to
[45:14] do. For all things are
[45:20] possible.
[45:22] Only

[46:16] Only
[46:19] believe. All things are
[46:24] possible.
[46:26] Only
[46:28] [Music]
[46:32] believe. Amen. Aren't you glad that's
[46:35] all you have to do?
[46:38] God made it very simple for us and that
[46:41] is just only believe that all things are
[46:43] possible. We know that all things are
[46:46] possible with God and uh but he made it
[46:49] very clear that all things are possible
[46:52] with the believer. All things are
[46:54] possible with you. And we are just
[46:57] living in an hour of uh possibility and
[47:01] uh the the uh the limits have been taken
[47:05] off of the bride of Jesus Christ to
[47:07] believe in what God has given us in this
[47:10] hour. And uh it sure is good to be uh
[47:14] here under the tent again. And we so
[47:17] have enjoyed the services. We enjoy all
[47:19] the the ministry and the uh the
[47:22] preaching of the word has just been
[47:25] tremendous and uh you know uh it's the
[47:29] bride of Jesus Christ is greatly blessed
[47:32] uh with uh just tremendous ministry and
[47:36] gifts that God has placed in the body.
[47:38] And uh we're not lacking for anything.
[47:41] We have the greatest message that has
[47:43] ever hit the earth. And and we've got uh
[47:47] men who believe it. And we've got uh
[47:50] people who receives it and believes it
[47:52] and acts upon it. And uh I tell you,
[47:55] it's it's uh it's a tremendous time to
[47:58] be able to preach to the bride of Jesus
[48:00] Christ. I think it's the greatest honor.
[48:03] It's the greatest privilege to be able
[48:05] to preach this message to to you uh
[48:09] because you believe it. Uh we're we're
[48:12] not uh arguing with it, debating it, but
[48:15] we just simply receive what God has
[48:17] given us in this hour. And u we just
[48:20] appreciate brother Shawn for the
[48:22] invitation and appreciate his labor of
[48:26] love and the church and uh Faith
[48:28] Tabernacle. I I know it's an exhausting
[48:31] effort uh but it's an eternal effort and
[48:34] uh we just are greatly uh beneficiaries
[48:38] of your love and we just uh uh
[48:40] appreciate uh you and and uh just all
[48:44] the the labor. And uh if we if you have
[48:48] your Bibles, we're uh just going to go
[48:50] into some portions of scripture. I've
[48:52] got three places and and if you don't
[48:55] mind just turning to those. Ephesians
[48:58] the first
[49:00] chapter beginning at verse 3 and uh
[49:04] Hebrews the first chapter beginning at
[49:07] verse one and then Psalms
[49:23] 110 Ephesians 1 and beginning at verse
[49:27] 10 Blessed be the God and Father of our
[49:30] Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us
[49:33] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[49:35] places in Christ, according as he hath
[49:38] chosen us in him before the foundation
[49:41] of the world, that we should be holy and
[49:44] without blame before him in love, having
[49:48] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[49:51] children, but Jesus Christ to himself
[49:54] according to the good pleasure pleasure
[49:56] of his will, to the praise of the glory
[50:00] of his grace, wherein he hath made us
[50:04] accepted in the beloved, in whom we have
[50:07] redemption through his blood, the
[50:09] forgiveness of sins, according to the
[50:12] riches of his grace, wherein he hath
[50:16] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[50:20] prudence, having made known unto us the
[50:23] mystery of his will according to his
[50:27] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[50:30] himself, that in the dispensation of the
[50:34] fullness of times, he might gather
[50:37] together in one all things in Christ,
[50:41] both which are in heaven and which are
[50:44] on earth, even in him. Now Hebrews the
[50:48] first chapter beginning at verse one and
[50:51] just reading to the third the third
[50:53] verse. God who at sunundry times and in
[50:57] diverse manners spake in time past unto
[51:01] the fathers by the prophets hath in
[51:04] these last days spoken unto us by his
[51:08] son whom he hath appointed heir of all
[51:12] things by whom also he made the worlds.
[51:16] who being the brightness of his glory
[51:18] and the express image of his person and
[51:22] upholding all things by the word of his
[51:27] power. When he had when he had by
[51:30] himself purged our sins, sat down on the
[51:34] right hand of the majesty on high. And
[51:38] now Psalms 110 and verse
[51:40] [Music]
[51:42] one. Just reading down to the fourth
[51:46] verse. The Lord said unto my Lord, sit
[51:50] thou at my right hand until I make thine
[51:53] enemies thy
[51:55] foottool. The Lord shall send the rod of
[51:58] thy strength out of Zion, rule thou in
[52:02] the midst of thine enemies. Thy people
[52:05] shall be willing in the day of thy
[52:07] power. In the beauties of holiness from
[52:11] the womb of the morning, thou hast the
[52:14] dw of thy youth. The Lord hath sworn and
[52:17] will not repent. Thou art a priest
[52:20] forever after the order of
[52:23] Melzdc. Let's just bow our hearts just
[52:26] for a moment in a word of prayer.
[52:28] Father, as we are gathered
[52:31] together, Lord, this is the day that the
[52:34] Lord has made. And Lord, we rejoice in
[52:38] it. We rejoice in the message that you
[52:40] have sent us. We rejoice in this great
[52:43] revelation that is burning within our
[52:46] hearts. And now, Father, as we are
[52:49] gathered together on this Saturday
[52:52] morning, we ask, Father, that you would
[52:54] speak, oh God, that once more, Lord, you
[52:58] would just speak to every heart, every
[53:01] need, and just bring a great
[53:04] understanding, Lord, to every heart,
[53:06] every boy, every girl, every man and
[53:08] woman. Father, we surrender ourselves to
[53:11] you, Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ.
[53:16] Amen. And amen. God richly bless you.
[53:19] You can be
[53:21] seated. I would like to uh speak uh just
[53:25] for a text. Gathered by the word of his
[53:29] power. Gathered by the word of his
[53:32] power. I thought it was a very striking
[53:35] thing and uh a very powerful thing.
[53:38] Brother Wayne speaking on uh God's
[53:42] power. And we would just like to
[53:45] continue in that same thought and that
[53:48] direction. But we are living in a
[53:50] predestinated time. And uh the prophet
[53:54] would show us that all the prophets uh
[53:57] throughout the history of the world
[54:00] longed for this day that we are living
[54:03] in right now. to see that we are a
[54:06] blessed people, a special people, a uh
[54:09] uh uh predestinated for such a time as
[54:13] this that Moses and Elijah and all of
[54:17] the prophets if if they had a choice of
[54:20] what day to live in, they would be they
[54:23] they would have chose this day that you
[54:26] are living in. And it's it's this is the
[54:30] age is uh it's an age where God is
[54:34] proving uh the culmination of the
[54:37] history the culmination from the very uh
[54:42] the very the very beginning from Genesis
[54:45] to revelation. This is the hour that God
[54:49] is proving that he is Elohim. He is the
[54:54] selfexisting one. He is not needing any
[54:58] man's uh help. He's not needing any
[55:00] man's teaching. And he doesn't need any
[55:03] man's theology. He doesn't need any
[55:06] man's help. This is the age that Elohim
[55:10] has stepped on the scene as omnipotent,
[55:14] the all powerful God. And he's proving
[55:17] in this age that he is not a dead God,
[55:20] but he is a live God. Amen. The prophet
[55:24] of God would show us that the scripture
[55:27] that we have read that in this last day
[55:30] he has spoken through the prophets. But
[55:32] in this last day, he is speaking through
[55:35] his son. And he would show us that it's
[55:38] what Luke 17 is about. The revealing of
[55:42] the son of man is Elohim coming on the
[55:47] scene. the word made manifest coming in
[55:50] human flesh to show and prove that Jesus
[55:55] Christ is not dead but he is alive in
[55:59] this age. Amen. The prophet, the prophet
[56:02] David would write about this I I believe
[56:06] right about this day and he would say
[56:09] that he would say in Psalms 118 verse 22
[56:14] he would say the stone which the
[56:17] builders refused has become the
[56:19] headstone of the corner. This is the
[56:22] Lord's doing. It is marvelous in our
[56:26] eyes. This is the day which the Lord
[56:29] hath made. We will rejoice and be glad
[56:34] in it. And so what they rejected in his
[56:39] first coming, he has returned as the
[56:42] headstone. He's returned as the
[56:45] intelligence coming into the bride body.
[56:49] And the church of the living God
[56:52] recognizes recognizes it. sees it in and
[56:56] receives it, embraces it and rejoices in
[57:01] it. Amen. Not only have we seen it, but
[57:04] we rejoice in what the Lord is doing.
[57:09] Amen. You see, this is the ending of the
[57:12] gentile
[57:13] dispensation. Everything has been
[57:15] building and building until this point
[57:18] in the history of the world. And the
[57:21] prophet of God said, "This less church
[57:24] age is the grandest of all the church
[57:27] ages because it's the ending of time and
[57:31] the blending of eternity." What an age
[57:35] to be living in. That is the ending of
[57:39] time and it's the blending of eternity.
[57:43] Everything that we have been looking
[57:45] for, Amen. Ever since the fall in the
[57:48] garden of Eden has been culminating to
[57:51] this history, this place, this time in
[57:54] the history of the world, it is the
[57:56] blending of time into the ending of time
[58:00] and the blending of eternity. You see,
[58:04] the prophet of God would say, "Always
[58:07] the end time message meets end time
[58:10] conditions." It's not sometimes uh but
[58:13] it's always end time message meets end
[58:18] time conditions. And the prophet of God
[58:21] would show us, amen, it's at the end of
[58:25] the world system when the world is
[58:28] coming into judgment and the patience of
[58:32] God is running out and the wrath of God
[58:35] is going to be poured out upon the
[58:37] world. It's at the end of the world
[58:40] system. It's when the world has come to
[58:44] a junction. Amen. The prophet of God
[58:47] would preach the message. Amen. The
[58:49] junction of time and show that there has
[58:52] been seven junctions in the history of
[58:55] the world. Amen. There was a junction in
[58:58] the time of Noah. There was a junction
[59:01] in the time of the Exodus when Moses
[59:04] came. There was a time of a junction
[59:07] when Abraham was on the back side of the
[59:09] desert and had met Elohim. There was a
[59:12] junction in the time of Jesus coming.
[59:16] You see, there is a junction. It's the
[59:20] changing of
[59:22] dispensations. You see, the only thing
[59:25] that can bring a change is omnipotence.
[59:29] Man can do it. The theologians can do
[59:32] it. Men with the best of intentions can
[59:35] do it. Uh the only thing uh that can
[59:38] bring a change from time into eternity
[59:41] is omnipotence. Amen. The prophet of God
[59:45] would say, "Amen. It's the ending." Uh
[59:48] amen. It's when uh it's when the
[59:51] dispensations has come to their end and
[59:55] we hit a junction. There's junctions on
[59:57] the highway. There's junctions on the
[1:00:00] roads that we travel in this world.
[1:00:03] There is junctions on this grand old
[1:00:06] highway that we travel to glory. He says
[1:00:09] it takes the miraculous to speak of
[1:00:12] omnipotence. Amen. Omnipotence is the
[1:00:16] all powerful and it takes the miraculous
[1:00:19] to vindicate the
[1:00:22] omnipotence. Oh, it takes the miraculous
[1:00:25] to vindicate the omnipotent. still lives
[1:00:29] uh and reigns. Uh oh. And we must have
[1:00:33] the miraculous. And I believe uh that
[1:00:36] the church is now standing on a
[1:00:38] threshold of the greatest vindication of
[1:00:42] omnipotence that the world has ever
[1:00:44] known. Uh it's at the junction. Uh amen.
[1:00:48] It's at the ending of the old road and
[1:00:51] coming into another road. Uh it's at the
[1:00:55] junction. Uh amen. is when the
[1:00:58] miraculous bears witness uh that
[1:01:01] omnipotence uh is not in heaven uh but
[1:01:04] omnipotence is on the earth. Uh where is
[1:01:06] the omnipotence uh where is the
[1:01:09] omnipotence uh being revealed? Uh it's
[1:01:12] that elect that is coming to the end of
[1:01:15] the age uh and they need mercy. They
[1:01:19] need grace. Uh they need help. Uh in the
[1:01:22] time of need uh is when uh the
[1:01:25] miraculous testifies uh that omnipotence
[1:01:28] uh is not dead, he's alive. Uh
[1:01:31] hallelujah. It was when the waters of
[1:01:34] judgment was falling in the days of
[1:01:36] Noah. But omnipotence came and gave a
[1:01:40] word of revelation uh in the midst of
[1:01:43] the junction. Uh God uh rich in mercy
[1:01:47] provided a way of escape. Uh oh yes. Uh
[1:01:51] omnipotent spoke uh and there is a word
[1:01:55] that gathered them into the ark.
[1:01:59] The prophet of God says it was the ark
[1:02:02] that was the miracle. In the time of
[1:02:05] destruction, in the time of the end of
[1:02:07] the world system, the ark was the
[1:02:11] miracle. And the ark is a type of
[1:02:14] Christ. Uh the miracle in this age uh is
[1:02:17] Christ is here. The Christ, the
[1:02:21] anointed, vindicated word uh is not uh
[1:02:25] in some denominational system. is not uh
[1:02:28] in some denominational headquarters. Uh
[1:02:30] it is not a dead letter but the spirit
[1:02:35] of the word uh has brought mercy in the
[1:02:38] time of need at the time of the ending
[1:02:43] of one dispensation and the ushering in
[1:02:47] of another. There is
[1:02:49] mercy when the word gathers us under the
[1:02:54] message of the hour.
[1:02:57] You see the junction where he starts
[1:03:00] something new. Junctions with the old to
[1:03:04] the new. With one dispensation to
[1:03:07] another, he always shows forth his
[1:03:10] power.
[1:03:12] Oh yes sir. Watch how the miraculous is
[1:03:15] done each time. Watch how God vindicates
[1:03:18] himself in healing and powers each time.
[1:03:23] just at the crossroads never before. You
[1:03:28] see, it's the healing, it's the power,
[1:03:31] it's the miraculous that is coming at
[1:03:35] the junction never before. Therefore,
[1:03:38] the prophet of God would say the first
[1:03:40] pull was healing, the second pole was
[1:03:44] prophesying, but the third pole was the
[1:03:47] opening of the word. The first two PS
[1:03:51] was in the junction. The first two polls
[1:03:54] was in the preparation. The first two
[1:03:56] polls uh was letting you know who was on
[1:03:59] the earth. Uh the first p the first two
[1:04:02] polls uh was to catch your attention.
[1:04:04] Hey, judgment is coming. Tribulation is
[1:04:08] coming. Uh we're at the end of the
[1:04:09] world. Uh there's got to be something uh
[1:04:12] that brings a change. Uh and the only
[1:04:14] thing that can bring a change uh is
[1:04:16] omnipotence. Uh so it's a declaration.
[1:04:19] Uh we have not come to just the words of
[1:04:22] a prophet. Uh but we have come to the
[1:04:24] end uh where the son himself is has
[1:04:28] spoke omnipotence has spoke that the
[1:04:32] bride can be gathered under the headship
[1:04:36] of the revealed word of the hour. Mercy
[1:04:40] under
[1:04:42] [Applause]
[1:04:46] headship. It's at the crossroads.
[1:04:49] Never before. You see, omnipotence
[1:04:52] speaks.
[1:04:55] The miraculous is only testifying that
[1:04:59] omnipotence is about to speak.
[1:05:03] Oh, praise the name of the Lord. You
[1:05:05] see, this is the age, Amen, that
[1:05:07] omnipotence is speaking when the king is
[1:05:11] speaking to his subjects. This is the
[1:05:14] this is the ushering in of the kingdom
[1:05:16] of God. And the kingdom of God is his
[1:05:20] word made power in you.
[1:05:23] [Music]
[1:05:24] You see the king speaking, ushering in
[1:05:29] his kingdom dominion in your flesh. It's
[1:05:33] his word made power. Amen. Not a dead
[1:05:37] letter, not a the something that is just
[1:05:39] a theology. It's not mind over matter.
[1:05:42] It is the kingdom the word may power in
[1:05:47] you. You see when we come to the
[1:05:50] junction of the history of the world.
[1:05:53] This age is where the king comes for the
[1:05:57] claiming work of redemption. You see
[1:06:01] when he came as the redeemer. Oh, there
[1:06:04] was Jesus standing in the junction and
[1:06:08] he told he stood there and looked upon
[1:06:10] Israel and said, "Oh, how
[1:06:13] oft you as a hen would gather her brood
[1:06:18] and put you under my wings and protect
[1:06:21] you and keep you and show you my mercy,
[1:06:24] but you wouldn't do it." Uh, if you only
[1:06:27] would have recognized the day and the
[1:06:30] hour of your visitation.
[1:06:32] If you would have only known the hour
[1:06:35] that belongs uh to your peaceuh I would
[1:06:38] have placed my wings over you. You as
[1:06:41] the shadow of the wings uh of the
[1:06:44] almighty bringing mercy to your life uh
[1:06:47] but you wouldn't do it. Uh but in the
[1:06:50] evening time uh when the capstone the
[1:06:53] redeemer comes uh it is claiming work uh
[1:06:56] there will be a people that is willing
[1:06:59] to come under the shadow of the wings of
[1:07:03] the almighty under the power of
[1:07:06] omnipotence and say hide me. Hide me
[1:07:09] from the wrath. Hide me from the evil
[1:07:12] one. Hide me from the destruction. It's
[1:07:15] at the ending of time and blending into
[1:07:18] eternity. The people will be willing in
[1:07:21] the day of his power,
[1:07:25] willing to come under headship,
[1:07:29] willing to accept
[1:07:32] omnipotence at the junction.
[1:07:38] You see Isaiah
[1:07:40] 45:22 says, "Look unto me and be ye
[1:07:45] saved all the ends of the earth, for I
[1:07:49] am God and there is none
[1:07:53] else." The prophet of God reading this
[1:07:57] scripture, preaching the message, look
[1:07:59] away to Jesus. He says when the earth
[1:08:01] has come to its end or the system of the
[1:08:05] earth has come to its end let the people
[1:08:09] look unto
[1:08:10] him. You see the prophet says now you
[1:08:14] might say we have heard this generation
[1:08:18] after
[1:08:19] generation. We've heard this for a long
[1:08:22] time. That is true and it's been
[1:08:25] preached for a long time. Many ministers
[1:08:28] has took this same text, thousands of
[1:08:32] them. But the prophet of God says, but
[1:08:34] this is what I want to ask you. When you
[1:08:37] look, the question is, what do you see
[1:08:40] when you
[1:08:42] look? And of all the thousands of
[1:08:46] preaching, look unto him. Look unto him.
[1:08:49] Look unto him. Look unto him. 6,000
[1:08:52] years. Amen. Look to the promise. Look
[1:08:54] to the word. Look to Elohim. Look to
[1:08:57] Christ. Look, look. But in this age,
[1:09:00] what do you see when you look?
[1:09:05] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. In
[1:09:08] every age, they looked and they saw a
[1:09:11] portion of Christ for their age. But you
[1:09:14] see, Amen. It all depends what you're
[1:09:18] looking for. When you look, it all
[1:09:21] depends what you're going to see, but
[1:09:23] what you're looking for. Amen. And if
[1:09:26] you're looking just for another church
[1:09:27] age change, that's all you're going to
[1:09:29] see. If you're looking for just another
[1:09:31] good hoop at a church camp, uh, that's
[1:09:34] all you're going to see. If all you're
[1:09:36] looking for is just a it's just a shield
[1:09:39] running up and down your spine, that's
[1:09:41] all you're going to see. But if you're
[1:09:43] looking for the rapture, if you're
[1:09:44] looking for the change of your body, if
[1:09:46] you're looking for the culmination of
[1:09:49] 6,000 years of revelation coming in the
[1:09:52] form of the revealing of Elohim, the
[1:09:55] self-existing one, the one that doesn't
[1:09:57] need your help. He doesn't need your
[1:09:59] sinless perfection. He doesn't need your
[1:10:01] good ideas. He doesn't need your help
[1:10:04] interpreting his message. All he needs
[1:10:07] is you to
[1:10:08] look and see him lifted out of history.
[1:10:11] Look at the one that can change your
[1:10:13] body. Look at the one who can brain
[1:10:16] blend you into eternity. The one that
[1:10:19] can change you from a liar to a truth
[1:10:23] teller. The person that can take you,
[1:10:25] Amen, from a homosexual and bring you
[1:10:28] back to your right mind, a map of God
[1:10:31] that can take you from a drunkard, an
[1:10:33] alcoholic and bring you back to a
[1:10:36] perfect sinless son of God again. What
[1:10:39] do you see when you
[1:10:42] [Applause]
[1:10:46] look?
[1:10:49] Hallelujah. There's been thousands of
[1:10:51] sermons
[1:10:52] preached, but they've been looking at a
[1:10:54] closed book.
[1:10:58] They've been trying to preach Christ
[1:11:00] from a closed
[1:11:02] book. They've been trying to preach
[1:11:04] rapturing condition, rapturing faith
[1:11:07] from a closed book. They've been trying
[1:11:09] to preach Jesus as a deliverer from a
[1:11:12] closed book. They've been trying to
[1:11:14] preach Christ the mighty conqueror from
[1:11:16] a closed book. But you got to look. You
[1:11:19] got to look. What are you looking for
[1:11:22] when you see the message of the hour?
[1:11:24] What are you looking for? Are you
[1:11:26] looking to just get a following? Are you
[1:11:28] looking for just a good hoop time? Or
[1:11:31] you looking for something to transform
[1:11:33] your body? Because we have come from
[1:11:36] glory to glory. We have come through the
[1:11:39] ages uh from the feet all the way up now
[1:11:43] to the headship of Christ the word. Uh
[1:11:46] what are you looking for? Are you
[1:11:48] looking to tell Christ how to do it? Or
[1:11:50] are you allowing Christ to tell you how
[1:11:52] to do it? Are you looking for something?
[1:11:54] Amen. to build you up uh your
[1:11:57] reputation, your ministry, or are you
[1:11:59] here to build up his reputation? Build
[1:12:02] up his ministry to promote Christ in a
[1:12:06] dark and evil age.
[1:12:09] [Applause]
[1:12:11] Close book.
[1:12:13] [Music]
[1:12:15] John wept
[1:12:18] because he's seen the kinsman redeemer.
[1:12:22] He had seen he was under that anointing.
[1:12:25] He knew Christ, Jesus Christ, came in
[1:12:28] the changing of a
[1:12:30] dispensation. He knew what it meant that
[1:12:33] that was Elohim in flesh. But he still
[1:12:36] wept because he was looking at a closed
[1:12:39] book and no one was worthy to open that
[1:12:42] book.
[1:12:44] No one was worthy to take that
[1:12:47] revelation and begin to bring an
[1:12:49] understanding into the church of who
[1:12:52] they are and bring such an understanding
[1:12:56] that you are not coming to be bride.
[1:12:58] You're not going to be bride. You're not
[1:13:01] going to be the word. You are the bride.
[1:13:04] You are the word. You are his sinless
[1:13:08] perfection made flesh. Not your own
[1:13:11] words doing it. his works.
[1:13:18] Revelations five sealed with seven seals
[1:13:21] and John wept because it was a closed
[1:13:25] book. But then we look
[1:13:27] again. Hallelujah. We look again. And in
[1:13:32] Revelation the 10th chapter, there is
[1:13:35] another mighty angel. And now this
[1:13:38] mighty angel, he's got he's got the
[1:13:41] rainbow over his head, which means that
[1:13:44] he's the angel of the covenant. And the
[1:13:46] prophet of God says, "Christ, only
[1:13:49] Christ it can be." Amen. And he's coming
[1:13:53] down with an open book. Revelations 5,
[1:13:56] closed book. Revelations 10, an open
[1:13:59] book. But it's at the breach that the
[1:14:03] prophet of God begins to show that that
[1:14:06] mystery, the mystery of our inheritance,
[1:14:09] the title deed has been sealed up in an
[1:14:13] earthn vessel waiting for the end time
[1:14:16] that there would be an earthn vessel, a
[1:14:19] messenger stand in the breach. stand
[1:14:22] between Revelations 5 and stand between
[1:14:25] Revelations 10 uh in the junction uh in
[1:14:29] the changing of the dispensation uh the
[1:14:32] prophet would say uh these messages are
[1:14:34] all kept up until this earthly vessel
[1:14:38] until the time of God's appointed time
[1:14:41] at the last messenger at the earth and
[1:14:43] all the people had judged it and said I
[1:14:46] know it's there I believe it's there and
[1:14:48] they fought at it and brought it forth
[1:14:50] and produced the things By faith they
[1:14:52] believed it. But now it's going to be
[1:14:55] brought to us in revelation and from the
[1:14:57] hand of God by
[1:15:00] vindication. Oh, because there was a
[1:15:02] prophet standing in the breach. His
[1:15:06] ministry was standing in the breach. the
[1:15:09] miracles, the first two PS preparation
[1:15:13] uh to bring them to the brereech and
[1:15:15] declare that everything that Adam lost,
[1:15:18] everything, all the fellowship, the
[1:15:21] right to the tree of life, uh the right
[1:15:23] to partake of the inheritance, uh is now
[1:15:26] being restored. Uh it's the changing of
[1:15:29] the junction. It's the changing of the
[1:15:32] dispensation. It's not dispensation of
[1:15:35] workshensation of law. It's not the
[1:15:38] dispensation of denominational ages. But
[1:15:41] time is no more. Time is no more. The
[1:15:47] time for those denominational ages, the
[1:15:49] time for denominational tradition, the
[1:15:52] time for denominational interpretation.
[1:15:55] The time is no
[1:15:58] [Applause]
[1:16:02] more. Now this is what John saw.
[1:16:06] It's what Daniel saw and they were told
[1:16:09] to seal it up.
[1:16:12] Seal it up until the time of the
[1:16:15] junction. For at the ending of the time,
[1:16:20] the line is going to speak.
[1:16:23] Now is not the time for the line to
[1:16:26] speak, but in the day of my power, the
[1:16:30] people are going to be willing to hear
[1:16:32] the lion roar. And when they hear the
[1:16:35] lion roar, it's not going to be seven
[1:16:38] thunders, seven mysteries, but it's
[1:16:41] going to be the voice of omnipotence,
[1:16:43] the voice of understanding, the voice of
[1:16:47] revelation coming into the bride. What
[1:16:50] is it doing? It's declaring that the
[1:16:53] time of confusion is no
[1:16:56] [Applause]
[1:16:58] more. Let me put it like this. The time
[1:17:01] of your struggles is no more. Under this
[1:17:04] message, mercy has come. The time of
[1:17:08] your cycles, the time of your weakness,
[1:17:11] the time of looking to your faults and
[1:17:14] failings, the time is no more. Now's the
[1:17:18] time to recognize it's bride time. It's
[1:17:22] a bright anointing. Your light has come.
[1:17:26] Rise and shine. Quit looking to your
[1:17:29] flesh. Elohim is here.
[1:17:37] The lion, the king, the voice of
[1:17:41] omnipotence, the very revelation given
[1:17:44] together the bride together has been
[1:17:48] released. You see, revel Daniel 12
[1:17:51] said, "Daniel, shut up the words in this
[1:17:55] book. seal the book until the end. And
[1:17:59] knowledge is going to increase and none
[1:18:02] of the wicked shall understand, but the
[1:18:05] wise shall
[1:18:09] understand. We're understanding that
[1:18:12] we're not feeding on a
[1:18:15] man. For a man's words will fail, but we
[1:18:19] are feeding on the unfailing body word
[1:18:21] of the son of man. We are
[1:18:25] understanding as Peter said, "Hope to
[1:18:28] the end for the grace that is to be
[1:18:31] brought unto you at the revelation of
[1:18:33] Jesus Christ." We are understanding that
[1:18:36] it is in this day at the revelation of
[1:18:40] Jesus Christ when Luke 17 is fulfilled
[1:18:43] and Elohim is revealed then grace has
[1:18:47] appeared. Grace, divine favor has
[1:18:51] appeared. The thing that we've been
[1:18:53] waiting for for the body change. The
[1:18:56] thing we've been waiting for to be
[1:18:58] delivered from this wretched man that I
[1:19:00] am. The thing that we've been waiting
[1:19:02] for to change this carnal thinking that
[1:19:05] I can be led by the spirit of God. The
[1:19:08] very thing this bride has been waiting
[1:19:11] for to turn the corner and begin to look
[1:19:14] heavenward. Stop looking at the things
[1:19:16] that are around you on the earth. Look
[1:19:19] up for your redemption draweth
[1:19:23] nigh. Time shall be no more.
[1:19:30] [Applause]
[1:19:32] The quickening power the prophet says
[1:19:35] has come to us to open the seals.
[1:19:39] What was that? The intelligence of a
[1:19:41] man. No, the quickening power of God.
[1:19:44] The prophet of God was jealous, he is
[1:19:47] the one who opened those seals. He is
[1:19:49] those seals. For the whole word of God
[1:19:53] is Christ. And Christ is the seals that
[1:19:56] was open. What is the opening of the
[1:19:58] seals then? Revealing Christ.
[1:20:03] You see, it's quickening power. the
[1:20:06] quickening power coming to the church
[1:20:08] making her ready this hour that we're
[1:20:12] approaching. Now, that was in ' 65. Let
[1:20:15] me let me just go ahead give me some I I
[1:20:18] just believe that the prophet was
[1:20:21] preparing us for this
[1:20:23] hour. I believe that he was preparing
[1:20:26] us. Quickening power was coming to the
[1:20:30] church making us ready to believe for
[1:20:34] all things.
[1:20:38] Quickening power was letting you know
[1:20:41] what God's will is. Quickening power is
[1:20:44] what told us the mystery of God's will
[1:20:47] is adoption.
[1:20:50] Quintoning power. Let us know that God
[1:20:53] by his forn knowledge predestinated you
[1:20:56] unto the adoption of
[1:20:59] children. It's the quickening power that
[1:21:02] let us know that what we have been
[1:21:04] waiting for, the position that we've
[1:21:07] been longing for is in the land of the
[1:21:10] Holy Ghost.
[1:21:13] And as we step be as we step beyond
[1:21:16] Jordan, we are coming into the land of
[1:21:19] the Holy Ghost. And we are leaving those
[1:21:22] other things in the wilderness. And we
[1:21:25] are stepping into our inheritance. And
[1:21:28] there is a Joshua ministry that is
[1:21:31] taking us into our position in the
[1:21:35] land. In the land. In the place. The
[1:21:38] prophet of God would say when the place
[1:21:41] is mechanics and dynamics coming
[1:21:44] together, when the bride comes to that
[1:21:47] place, then there will be a spark that
[1:21:51] gets this bride to moving in the power
[1:21:54] of his resurrection, the same works that
[1:21:57] Christ did, the bride does. The same
[1:22:00] life that Christ lived, the bride lives.
[1:22:03] I will meet you there.
[1:22:07] [Applause]
[1:22:10] Not in a dead works, not in some
[1:22:12] theologian,
[1:22:14] but I'll meet you in the place I put my
[1:22:16] name. Not in the Baptist, not in the
[1:22:20] Presbyterian, not in the Pentecostal,
[1:22:22] and not in some denominational message
[1:22:26] church. I will meet you where mechanics
[1:22:30] and dynamics come together. That's where
[1:22:32] I put my name.
[1:22:35] The word that is living, the word that
[1:22:38] is proving that this is Elohim. I will
[1:22:41] meet you there.
[1:22:44] That's where I'm going to take you from
[1:22:45] time into eternity. I'm going to gather
[1:22:48] you into that place.
[1:22:52] [Applause]
[1:22:55] You see, it's a gathering time.
[1:22:59] He's gathering us in one. All things in
[1:23:02] one in Christ.
[1:23:04] Lord for the rapture.
[1:23:07] You see the prophet says, "How could men
[1:23:10] do anything else besides the power of
[1:23:12] God that had been released of
[1:23:14] them?" Said, "If God sends a certain
[1:23:16] spirit among them, that's the only thing
[1:23:19] that they can work by is the spirit that
[1:23:22] works among them." You see, it's the
[1:23:26] church that responds to the anointing
[1:23:29] released to the age.
[1:23:31] Now the prophet of God is referring to
[1:23:34] Revelation the 4th chapter where there's
[1:23:36] four beasts. There's four anointings
[1:23:39] that is released to the church. We find
[1:23:42] that it's a lion anointing. Then it's an
[1:23:44] ox anointing. Then it's a man anointing.
[1:23:47] And he says these three, the first three
[1:23:51] are earthbound
[1:23:52] creatures. They're anointings dealing
[1:23:55] with the things that are happening on
[1:23:57] the earth. But you see it is the fourth
[1:24:01] which is the eagle anointing. And the
[1:24:04] eagle anointing is catching you what is
[1:24:07] happening on the earth earth and
[1:24:10] catching you up into an astronaut age
[1:24:14] which is the heavenly places in Christ.
[1:24:18] So the eagle anointing does not
[1:24:20] necessarily matter, you know, so much
[1:24:23] about what's happening here on the
[1:24:25] earth, even though he's a prophet to the
[1:24:28] nations, but he's getting that bride to
[1:24:30] look up.
[1:24:32] He's gathering the bride under the
[1:24:35] revelation of the opening of the word.
[1:24:38] You see, the prophet would say, "It's
[1:24:40] the eagle time. It's the anointing of
[1:24:43] the hour. It's the time that we're
[1:24:44] living in. It's the working of the Holy
[1:24:47] Spirit for this particular time to prove
[1:24:50] that Jesus is not dead. The prophet
[1:24:54] again says, "Now remember there is no
[1:24:56] more powers goes out after that eagle.
[1:24:59] God sent something to combat it." The
[1:25:02] antichrist spirit. Then he sent another
[1:25:04] power. God sent something else to combat
[1:25:05] it. Then when he go down to the eagle,
[1:25:09] that was his word back like it was in
[1:25:13] the first place. So we have come to the
[1:25:16] anointing of the hour which is the word
[1:25:19] and the word
[1:25:21] only. And the only way you find mercy in
[1:25:24] this age is following after the
[1:25:27] word. And the word is gathering all
[1:25:31] things in heaven and in earth in one.
[1:25:34] And that is in Christ.
[1:25:39] You see, Jesus said, "Where the carcass
[1:25:41] is, the eagles will be gathered."
[1:25:45] Where the killing is, the eagles will be
[1:25:47] gathered. Where the fresh meat is, the
[1:25:50] word of the season, the eagles will be
[1:25:53] gathered where the fresh keel is of the
[1:25:56] word. The word that's raised up and
[1:25:59] fattened and been made manifest and give
[1:26:01] out to the food for the children. That's
[1:26:03] where the eagles are gathered.
[1:26:08] Now, the prophet of God says, "You can't
[1:26:09] be nature." Am I Am I being too slow?
[1:26:13] You can't be nature. He said, "The
[1:26:16] prophet of God says that he was there
[1:26:18] with with a with a with another man,
[1:26:20] Bert, and they're going down the river
[1:26:22] there down down the lake." And he said
[1:26:24] all the sudden, he says, "We're going
[1:26:26] down and there's a swarm of ducks." He
[1:26:29] said, "And they're all just everywhere.
[1:26:30] There's there's just a swarm of them
[1:26:32] everywhere on that lake." He said, "And
[1:26:35] they're all quacking and they're all
[1:26:37] making a commotion." And then and and
[1:26:39] and and Bert asked the prophet says, "I
[1:26:42] wonder what this is all about, Billy."
[1:26:46] Hallelujah. Oh, a lot of people have
[1:26:49] been asking, "What is this all about?
[1:26:52] What is this shouting and and hollering
[1:26:54] and saying amen and having a dance in
[1:26:57] your step? What's it all about?" Oh,
[1:27:00] well, the prophet of God said, "Well, I
[1:27:02] tell you what it is, birds." He said,
[1:27:04] "They're getting ready to fly south. You
[1:27:06] see the red skies over there? It's a
[1:27:08] sign that the storms are coming. The
[1:27:11] snow is coming." He said, "Bert, they're
[1:27:14] all in the lake gathering together.
[1:27:17] They're swarming. They're having a
[1:27:20] revival." Hallelujah. And brother Bert,
[1:27:23] amen, he says, you know, he said, "I I
[1:27:25] wonder why they're being so noisy. I
[1:27:28] want I wonder what they're saying to one
[1:27:30] another." He said, "I'll tell you what
[1:27:31] they're doing, Bert." He said, "I
[1:27:33] thinking they're having fellowship." He
[1:27:35] said, "I think they're just gathering
[1:27:36] together and they're having some good
[1:27:38] old fellowship." What are they doing?
[1:27:41] They're getting ready to leave for the
[1:27:42] sky. They know it's coming. They know
[1:27:45] it's the season. They know they have
[1:27:47] transforming power within their wings.
[1:27:50] Uh they've got the ability. They're not
[1:27:52] checking. They're not saying, "I wonder
[1:27:54] if I can do it." They're saying, "It's
[1:27:56] upon me." If the instinct is telling me
[1:27:58] it's time to go back, it's time to go
[1:28:01] back south. I tell you friends, uh
[1:28:03] that's what this 10th meeting is about.
[1:28:05] Uh it's a gathering around the revealed
[1:28:08] word of the hour. And we're having
[1:28:10] fellowship. We're having fellowship.
[1:28:13] We're hearing from our theophony that
[1:28:16] this message is eagle food to give us
[1:28:19] rapturing grace to head for the sky.
[1:28:25] We're not wondering about it. We're not
[1:28:27] trying to see if we're doing all the
[1:28:29] works just right and we got all the dues
[1:28:31] just right. It's a different holy It's a
[1:28:34] different gathering now. This is a holy
[1:28:36] convocation. This is where we step from
[1:28:38] time into eternity. This is a prepared
[1:28:43] people for a prepared city. That city is
[1:28:46] already prepared. The city is already in
[1:28:49] the eternities waiting uh for a people
[1:28:52] that is prepared uh that's been gathered
[1:28:55] under the revealed rapturing faith of
[1:28:58] the hour. Then what does that mean for
[1:29:01] you and I? It means I don't have time to
[1:29:03] read it but the prophet of God says it's
[1:29:06] the last feast which is the feast of
[1:29:09] tabernacles which is amen you've got
[1:29:12] feast for seven days but on the eighth
[1:29:14] day uh the eighth day speaks of eternity
[1:29:18] it speaks of new beginnings it speaks of
[1:29:21] new creation when you gather in the
[1:29:23] feast of tabernacles it's when you step
[1:29:26] from time and you step into eternity
[1:29:29] when you gather under the revealed
[1:29:32] revelation of Elohim. You step from your
[1:29:36] ability. You step from your weakness. Uh
[1:29:39] you step from your tradition. You step
[1:29:43] from the dos and the don'ts. Uh and you
[1:29:45] step from just new moons uh and new
[1:29:48] church order. And you step into
[1:29:51] eternity. You step into rapturing faith.
[1:29:53] Uh you step into rapturing condition.
[1:29:56] You have ceased from time and you've
[1:30:00] gathered into Christ.
[1:30:04] It's a
[1:30:05] gathering. It's a gathering.
[1:30:08] The same spirit that raised Christ from
[1:30:11] the dead,
[1:30:16] if it quickens
[1:30:19] you, your mortal body which is
[1:30:22] dead. Your mortal body which is just but
[1:30:26] a hybrid.
[1:30:28] Your mortal body which is trying to
[1:30:31] catch up.
[1:30:33] What's it catching up to? Your
[1:30:35] confession.
[1:30:37] It's catching up to the immortal side of
[1:30:40] you.
[1:30:43] Your body, which is that unbeliever
[1:30:46] that's been telling you, you can't do
[1:30:48] it.
[1:30:52] You can't make it.
[1:30:55] You're too tired. You're too weak. You
[1:30:58] make too many
[1:30:59] mistakes. But when you come into Romans
[1:31:02] 8, you cease from your labors.
[1:31:05] You cease from
[1:31:07] condemnation. You cease. You cease from
[1:31:09] the law of sin and death. And you come
[1:31:12] into Christ, which is free of all
[1:31:16] condemnation, free of your carnal
[1:31:18] appetite, free of your carnal flesh,
[1:31:22] free of that old struggling nature
[1:31:24] that's trying to keep you earthbound.
[1:31:26] You have been gathered into Christ full
[1:31:30] of transforming power to make the
[1:31:32] journey back to the Garden of Eden a
[1:31:35] prepared people for a prepared city.
[1:31:39] It's already prepared. It's already
[1:31:42] waiting. It's already there. But you are
[1:31:46] already
[1:31:47] here. Prepared by the message of the
[1:31:51] hour to go to that place.
[1:31:59] You see, when the Lord himself shall
[1:32:01] descend, he's going to descend with a
[1:32:03] message that's going to gather the bride
[1:32:09] together. The prophet of God would say,
[1:32:12] "The elected seen it in Noah's time, the
[1:32:15] junction. They seen it in Moses' time,
[1:32:18] the junction. They seen it in Jesus's
[1:32:20] time, that junction, the apostles time,
[1:32:23] Luther's time, Wes's time, Pentecostal
[1:32:25] time. That was the seed that was on the
[1:32:28] earth to be watered by that
[1:32:31] water. That was the inspiration that was
[1:32:33] being poured out. But the inspiration's
[1:32:36] poured out together, the bride together.
[1:32:41] It's only those who are elected will see
[1:32:44] it.
[1:32:47] You say,
[1:32:49] "Why? Why? What makes us act so
[1:32:52] different?" There's an
[1:32:54] inspiration. God has breathed an
[1:32:58] inspiration upon this bride. We can't be
[1:33:01] the same. We can't be the same that we
[1:33:04] used to be. We can't think the same we
[1:33:06] used to think. We can't look at our
[1:33:08] trials the same way we used to think. We
[1:33:11] can't look at church the same way we
[1:33:13] used to think. We can't look at our
[1:33:15] families the same way we used to think.
[1:33:18] There has been a change. There has been
[1:33:20] an inspiration.
[1:33:22] There has been the breath of God that
[1:33:25] has been breathed upon the church of the
[1:33:26] living God that has gathered us under
[1:33:29] the word of omnipotence.
[1:33:34] Omnipotence said that all that the
[1:33:36] father hath given me, I will not lose
[1:33:39] one.
[1:33:42] Your preacher didn't say that.
[1:33:44] Lipotan said that
[1:33:48] in my name you shall cast out devils.
[1:33:52] Lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:33:54] recover. Omnipotent said that
[1:33:58] we're gathered under the revelation of
[1:34:01] who is speaking in this hour.
[1:34:04] Hallelujah. You see we're
[1:34:07] loving Do I have a little bit more time?
[1:34:11] We're living in a we're living on up
[1:34:15] here to the bride age, the calling out
[1:34:18] of the church and getting it together
[1:34:21] for the rapture.
[1:34:23] The prophet again would say this is not
[1:34:25] Luther's age. This is not Pentecost age.
[1:34:28] This is the bride age. As Moses called a
[1:34:31] nation out of a nation, Christ today is
[1:34:34] calling a church out of a church. You
[1:34:37] see the same thing in type taking them
[1:34:40] to the glorious eternal promised land.
[1:34:44] Now to refuse that person that's doing
[1:34:47] the calling Christ no matter if you're
[1:34:50] Pentecostal, Methodist, Luther, Luther,
[1:34:52] whatever you are this age, nothing
[1:34:55] against them, nothing at all. But in the
[1:34:57] age now, you've got to accept the person
[1:35:00] of Christ which is the word. Now they
[1:35:04] asked this. Now, this was this was a
[1:35:07] thought on the people's mind. Amen. You
[1:35:09] find it there in the questions and
[1:35:11] answers in ' 64 and and and they were
[1:35:14] asking brother Brandham just a lot of
[1:35:16] questions. Where where do we go? Do we
[1:35:19] go to do do we stay in Jeffersonville?
[1:35:21] Do we do we go to Tucson? Do do where
[1:35:24] where you've called us
[1:35:26] out. We feel the poor. You've called us
[1:35:30] out of those denominations. You've
[1:35:32] called us out of those traditions. Where
[1:35:34] do we go,
[1:35:36] brother? They asked, now this is just
[1:35:38] one of the questions. Will will there be
[1:35:40] or or is there now a place for the bride
[1:35:43] to gather together together to live like
[1:35:46] when Moses led the children of Israel?
[1:35:49] The prophet says, I'm going to answer
[1:35:50] that question for you. It was just
[1:35:53] revealed to me. I'm going to tell you
[1:35:55] the truth. Yes, sir. There's a place for
[1:35:57] the bride together. You want to know
[1:35:59] where it's at? It's in Christ.
[1:36:04] Just gather in there. We're all
[1:36:09] together. We're all
[1:36:11] together. We're swarming together. It
[1:36:15] doesn't matter if you're in Ohio,
[1:36:18] Virginia, North Carolina, South
[1:36:21] Carolina, Africa. It doesn't matter
[1:36:24] where you're at because you're all in
[1:36:26] the same place. You're positionally
[1:36:29] placed in the gathering and that is in
[1:36:33] [Applause]
[1:36:35] Christ. Oh, praise the Lord. The prophet
[1:36:38] says, "Now the believers of this age has
[1:36:41] to believe this what he promised today.
[1:36:44] Just the same as they had to come into
[1:36:45] the ark to be saved, go out of Egypt to
[1:36:48] be saved, they have to come into Christ
[1:36:50] to be saved now into the word message
[1:36:53] that he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:36:56] forever." How do you get into it? By
[1:36:59] baptism. Baptism of what? Water? By the
[1:37:02] Holy Ghost, one spirit. We're all
[1:37:05] baptized into this one body. And the
[1:37:09] prophet of God is telling you now, this
[1:37:11] is how you get into your gathering. This
[1:37:14] is how you get into Christ, the word
[1:37:16] message. Uh there's a power that puts
[1:37:19] you into your place. There's a power
[1:37:21] that takes you out of just being an
[1:37:24] American citizen or just being a part of
[1:37:27] some group of men or a society or
[1:37:30] denomination or a certain teaching of
[1:37:33] the message. It is the Holy Ghost. It is
[1:37:37] the power of omnipotence that places you
[1:37:41] in the word message.
[1:37:45] And when you come into the word of
[1:37:47] message, you are born of the Holy Ghost
[1:37:50] and the spirit of truth is leading and
[1:37:53] guiding you into all truth. He is
[1:37:57] revealing the very secrets of the
[1:38:00] heartbeat of God to you who are in the
[1:38:05] word
[1:38:06] [Applause]
[1:38:10] message. Hallelujah.
[1:38:13] Man didn't put you there. Persecution
[1:38:16] didn't put you there.
[1:38:19] It is the Holy
[1:38:21] Ghost. It is
[1:38:23] omnipotence. It's the power of
[1:38:27] revelation that has birthed
[1:38:30] you into reality.
[1:38:34] The prophet of God says, "When you get
[1:38:37] those believers that has been born by
[1:38:40] that revelation and you get them all
[1:38:42] together,
[1:38:46] no leaven, no unbelief anywhere. It
[1:38:50] brings the fullness of Elohim into the
[1:38:55] tent. It brings the fullness of the
[1:38:58] quickening power into the tent. It
[1:39:02] brings Elohim the fullness of deity, the
[1:39:07] fullness of the Godhead dwelling in the
[1:39:11] bride
[1:39:14] body where in the place he put his name
[1:39:19] which is Christ, the word of the hour.
[1:39:28] [Applause]
[1:39:30] Now
[1:39:33] Remember
[1:39:35] always end time message
[1:39:38] meets end time condition.
[1:39:45] As it was in the days of Sodom,
[1:39:48] as it was in the days of Noah,
[1:39:51] as it was in those junctions, so shall
[1:39:54] it be in the revealing of the son of
[1:39:55] man.
[1:39:57] Now that the prophet of God says, "Son
[1:40:00] of
[1:40:01] man, Luke
[1:40:03] 17 is going to be revealed just like he
[1:40:07] was
[1:40:09] Elohim coming to
[1:40:12] Abraham." And the prophet of God says
[1:40:14] it's Elohim. And he takes us back to
[1:40:17] Genesis 1. In the beginning, God created
[1:40:22] all things. He says now the English but
[1:40:25] God but the real meaning is Elohim. So
[1:40:29] in the beginning Elohim said let there
[1:40:32] be. Now come to John 1 where it says in
[1:40:37] the beginning was the word the word was
[1:40:39] with God. The word was God or in the
[1:40:42] beginning was Elohim
[1:40:47] and Elohim was made flesh and dwelt
[1:40:51] among us.
[1:40:52] [Applause]
[1:40:54] Now it was Elohim that came in the
[1:40:57] change of dispensation when he said, "I
[1:40:59] have needs to go by
[1:41:02] Samaria." Now there was a prostitute who
[1:41:05] had been an outcast from the rest of the
[1:41:08] religious because she was too immoral.
[1:41:11] She had five husbands and the one she
[1:41:13] was living with now was not her own
[1:41:15] husband. But Jesus was coming under at a
[1:41:19] junction. She didn't know it. She didn't
[1:41:22] realize it, but she was coming to a
[1:41:25] junction in her
[1:41:27] life. She was going to the well just
[1:41:29] like she always did. She was being
[1:41:32] laughed at just like she was always
[1:41:34] laughed at. She was had condemnation
[1:41:38] over her life just like she always had.
[1:41:40] But there was something within her that
[1:41:42] was looking for the Messiah. Amen. She
[1:41:45] was an outcast of the religious. Amen.
[1:41:48] Their societies and and their churches.
[1:41:50] But there was something that they said
[1:41:52] that stuck with her. Messiah is
[1:41:56] coming. She didn't realize the hour. She
[1:41:59] didn't realize the day. But there was
[1:42:02] something within her heart that was
[1:42:04] longing for her visitation. And when
[1:42:06] Jesus stepped on the scene and begin to
[1:42:09] talk with her and begin to discern her
[1:42:11] heart, amen, she was at a
[1:42:15] junction. The miraculous was taking
[1:42:17] place in her life. The word Elohim, the
[1:42:22] Messiah, was discerning her heart and
[1:42:26] something be to quicken within her
[1:42:29] heart. The Pharisees didn't want
[1:42:31] anything to do with him. The Sadducees
[1:42:34] didn't want anything to do with him. But
[1:42:36] here's a prostitute that was a gene seed
[1:42:41] in the back part of Elohim's
[1:42:45] mind. And Elohim
[1:42:48] [Applause]
[1:42:51] Elohim said, "I have
[1:42:54] need to go to my
[1:42:58] thought at the
[1:43:00] junction." At the changing of
[1:43:04] dispensation, he called her by
[1:43:06] name. He discerned her heart. He told
[1:43:10] her who she
[1:43:12] was. And she dropped the water pot.
[1:43:16] [Applause]
[1:43:18] She was ready to be rebuked. She was
[1:43:20] ready to be chastised.
[1:43:22] She was ready for the laws to come down
[1:43:24] on her. But at the dispensation change,
[1:43:31] grace. Grace.
[1:43:34] She didn't realize it, but she was in
[1:43:36] the presence of
[1:43:38] omnipotence. at the revelation of
[1:43:42] omnipotence. Grace
[1:43:46] was poured out over her life.
[1:43:49] [Applause]
[1:43:51] Thank you, Lord. Now, the prophet of God
[1:43:53] says the same thing that happened to the
[1:43:55] woman at the well happened in Sarah.
[1:43:59] And let's take you for that journey for
[1:44:01] just a moment, and I'm closing.
[1:44:04] You
[1:44:05] see, Abram was an idoltor, but he had
[1:44:10] been called out by election, and he had
[1:44:12] been brought into a land of promise. And
[1:44:15] he had been brought into a walk with
[1:44:19] God. And the prophet of God would say,
[1:44:22] just for we're short on time, but he
[1:44:25] would say that it was
[1:44:27] Abram that he was justified in Genesis
[1:44:31] the 12th chapter. I'm quoting a prophet.
[1:44:34] Genesis the 12th chapter, Abraham was
[1:44:37] justified.
[1:44:39] Then he comes into Genesis the 15th
[1:44:41] chapter and that's where we find that
[1:44:43] Abram was
[1:44:44] sanctified. But it was in Genesis the
[1:44:47] 17th chapter that now Abram is 99 years
[1:44:52] old. He's weak. The condition he's not
[1:44:57] in Sodom.
[1:45:01] I I I want that to sink in. He's not
[1:45:04] down there in Sodom. He's not down there
[1:45:07] smoking cigarettes. He's not at a
[1:45:10] barroom. He's not being overcome by
[1:45:13] religious spirits.
[1:45:15] [Applause]
[1:45:18] Abram has been called out.
[1:45:23] So what those two messengers did for Lot
[1:45:26] down in Sodom, it would never work for
[1:45:29] Abram.
[1:45:31] [Music]
[1:45:33] Abram was another
[1:45:35] group. Abram was completely
[1:45:39] separated. Abram was waiting for a
[1:45:42] different visitation.
[1:45:45] The prophet says that it was Genesis the
[1:45:47] 17th chapter when God revealed himself
[1:45:51] as the Lord God Almighty or El
[1:45:56] Shadi. I am the Almighty God. I am El
[1:46:01] Shadi. I am your breast and mother. I am
[1:46:05] your
[1:46:07] mother. Take my breast. Take the word.
[1:46:11] Take the promise. The prophet of God
[1:46:14] says that's when Abram received the
[1:46:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost is when the
[1:46:19] strength of Elohim, the strength of
[1:46:23] Almighty God came into Abram.
[1:46:28] [Applause]
[1:46:29] The prophet of God says that's where the
[1:46:31] church received the baptism of the Holy
[1:46:33] Ghost, El Shadi, bringing life, bringing
[1:46:38] strength into the church. Amen. the
[1:46:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost, the almighty
[1:46:44] God, omnipotence coming into the church.
[1:46:48] But the prophet of God says, now notice,
[1:46:50] it was many chapters, many years that
[1:46:52] went from Genesis 12 to Genesis 15, from
[1:46:56] justification, sanctification. Many
[1:46:59] years passed from sanctification,
[1:47:01] Genesis 15 to Genesis 17. But he said,
[1:47:04] "Notice it was only just a few verses
[1:47:08] that when it went from just the baptism
[1:47:11] of the Holy Ghost, El Shadi, to a few
[1:47:14] verses later that Elohim comes, Almighty
[1:47:18] comes and says, "Your name is Abram. But
[1:47:22] I am going to give you a part of my own
[1:47:25] name." Abraham, Abram, you are going to
[1:47:29] no longer be Abram. You are going to be
[1:47:31] Abraham. The prophet of God said that's
[1:47:34] where Abraham was adopted. He was
[1:47:38] positionally placed when his name was
[1:47:41] changed. And the prophet says that's
[1:47:44] where the adoption took place in the
[1:47:46] church. It's when he no longer calls you
[1:47:50] church. He calls you bride. It's at the
[1:47:53] dispensation change that Elohim comes
[1:47:57] down and appears in human flesh in the
[1:48:01] junction in the dispensation change. He
[1:48:05] says, "I'm not going to just call you
[1:48:07] the call out. I'm going to call you my
[1:48:10] bride. You are coming into an invisible
[1:48:13] union, a marriage of the lamb. Rejoice
[1:48:18] for the marriage of the lamb is come.
[1:48:24] The junction,
[1:48:26] the change,
[1:48:29] no longer Abram, but Abraham.
[1:48:34] No longer Sarah, but Sarah.
[1:48:39] Now,
[1:48:40] Abraham is still a 99y old man, but
[1:48:45] there's a difference. There's been a
[1:48:48] change. His testimonyy's changed. Are
[1:48:50] you with me? His testimony changed.
[1:48:53] Don't call me Abram any longer. Call me
[1:48:56] Abraham.
[1:48:58] Don't you call me Naughty any longer.
[1:49:01] Don't you call me some lukewarm church
[1:49:03] member any longer. Don't you call me
[1:49:05] just church. There's a separation.
[1:49:07] There's an identity that has taken
[1:49:09] place. I have taken
[1:49:13] omnipotence. I have taken part of his
[1:49:17] name.
[1:49:19] [Applause]
[1:49:20] You know when Eve was separated from
[1:49:23] Adam, she her name was Adam.
[1:49:27] Her position wasn't Adam.
[1:49:30] Who am I? Where did I come from? You
[1:49:33] come from me. You come from a side. You
[1:49:35] are bone on my bone. Your flesh of my
[1:49:37] flesh. You are Adam.
[1:49:41] In the dispensation change, there's been
[1:49:44] churches, churches, brides. But there's
[1:49:48] coming
[1:49:49] one coming one that has entered into an
[1:49:52] invisible union. She's come into
[1:49:55] identification where Elohim has given
[1:49:59] her a part of his own name, Mrs. Jesus
[1:50:05] Christ. William Brandham didn't do that.
[1:50:08] The preacher didn't do that. Elohim did
[1:50:10] that.
[1:50:15] You're predestinated unto this adoption.
[1:50:20] Now, I'm closing. I'm really really
[1:50:23] trying to
[1:50:25] Well, you would think that it's all done
[1:50:27] and gone, right?
[1:50:29] No. No. Because we go on to Revelations
[1:50:33] the or Genesis the 18th chapter and we
[1:50:36] find that g that Abraham is thinking on
[1:50:39] his new name.
[1:50:41] He's thinking on his new
[1:50:43] identity. He's thinking on his position.
[1:50:47] He's thinking, but he's looking at his
[1:50:50] condition. I'm old. You know where I'm
[1:50:52] at. End time message meets end time
[1:50:55] conditions. He's over there under an
[1:50:59] authority to say that I am Mrs. Jesus
[1:51:03] Christ. But he's still wondering about
[1:51:06] his condition. He's still wondering
[1:51:08] about the human element. But he looks
[1:51:11] coming down the road and there is three
[1:51:15] but he doesn't see
[1:51:17] three. What do you
[1:51:21] see? I'm beside myself. What do you see
[1:51:25] when you come to the end of the road?
[1:51:28] When you come and see Elohim walking
[1:51:31] down the road. Do you see three? Do you
[1:51:33] see Father, Son, and Holy Ghost?
[1:51:37] I I'm going to hit it now. I'm just
[1:51:39] going to say it and move on. We're in a
[1:51:41] different dispensation than the Holy
[1:51:43] Ghost dispensation. The dispensation of
[1:51:45] the Holy Ghost was for seven church
[1:51:47] ages. But between the son, the son of
[1:51:50] God dispensation and the son of David
[1:51:52] dispensation in the millennium, it turns
[1:51:55] back to
[1:51:56] Elohim. Son of man, what do you see when
[1:52:00] you look at the dispensation change?
[1:52:04] I see Elohim,
[1:52:07] my Lord.
[1:52:09] [Applause]
[1:52:11] The one who gave me the promise, the one
[1:52:13] who called me out of the world, the one
[1:52:15] who placed me, the one who's filled me
[1:52:19] is now here.
[1:52:22] What's he going to
[1:52:23] do? He didn't come and say Abram. He
[1:52:27] said, "Abraham,
[1:52:29] Elohim,
[1:52:30] coming with the word of omnipotence and
[1:52:34] said,"Abraham,
[1:52:37] Abraham." And he's saying there, "Elohim
[1:52:40] in flesh." But now he's saying, "Where
[1:52:44] is Sarah?"
[1:52:46] Now Sarai,
[1:52:49] Sarah. Just a few days before it was
[1:52:52] Abram and Sarai. But now under the
[1:52:55] change.
[1:52:56] [Applause]
[1:52:58] No longer are you even at the junction.
[1:53:00] You've already made the change.
[1:53:04] You've already stepped into the
[1:53:06] revelation of omnipotence speaking over
[1:53:09] your life. And under that revelation, he
[1:53:13] says,
[1:53:15] Abraham, Sarah,
[1:53:18] you'll ne you say, "What are you what
[1:53:20] are you getting?" Let me tell you this.
[1:53:22] You'll never listen to this
[1:53:24] message and hear that you're just a
[1:53:26] church member.
[1:53:28] You'll never hear this message and it'll
[1:53:31] place you under Leosa.
[1:53:34] You'll never hear this message and
[1:53:36] you're just some lukewarm hotbed
[1:53:38] plant. When you are listening to the
[1:53:41] message of the hour, you are hearing the
[1:53:44] voice of omnipotence speaking your true
[1:53:47] identity. You are hearing Mrs. Jesus
[1:53:50] Christ. misses Jesus Christ. You're
[1:53:53] pregnantated with his life. You're
[1:53:54] sealed into the day of redemption. You
[1:53:56] have adoption authority by the name of
[1:53:59] Jesus
[1:54:01] [Music]
[1:54:01] [Applause]
[1:54:05] Christ.
[1:54:07] Sarah, why did Sarah laugh? Cuz see,
[1:54:10] Sarah was having a little bit of a
[1:54:12] problem still. Her name was
[1:54:15] changed, but she was still having a
[1:54:17] problem seeing that she's a part of
[1:54:18] that.
[1:54:20] But
[1:54:22] Elohim said, "Why did Sarah laugh?" He
[1:54:25] didn't say, "Sarai."
[1:54:27] He didn't say, "I I I detect a little
[1:54:28] bit of unbelief in her, and why is she
[1:54:31] laughing?" And no, he didn't say, "I
[1:54:33] made a mistake." Said, "No, he still
[1:54:36] called her by a true identity.
[1:54:39] Sarah, the prophet of God, says God
[1:54:43] Elohim would have killed her right there
[1:54:44] for disbelieving it, but she was a part
[1:54:48] of Abraham.
[1:54:52] We have been ripening under this
[1:54:55] message. Are you still with me? I'm
[1:54:57] closing. I really am. Thank you for your
[1:54:59] patience. We have been ripening under
[1:55:02] this message, the sen light for 50 plus
[1:55:06] years. And still there's sometimes in
[1:55:08] your flesh you're
[1:55:10] wandering, but God comes right down for
[1:55:13] the voice of his word, for the voice of
[1:55:16] Elohim. So many times we think, "Oh, if
[1:55:19] I was only in the prophets, if I was
[1:55:21] only there in the message, if I if I
[1:55:23] could only hear him say you live, your
[1:55:25] name is so and so and and you you you
[1:55:28] live on certain certain street." I I I
[1:55:30] that's wonderful. I I think it's it's
[1:55:32] the Messiah sign. But let me tell you
[1:55:35] something greater than that. is when the
[1:55:38] voice of Elohim is speaking through a
[1:55:40] vindicated message in this hour and
[1:55:43] you're hearing your name that has been
[1:55:46] sealed up under those seals that men
[1:55:50] could not preach your name because it
[1:55:52] was sealed up. Could not preach a
[1:55:55] rapture revelation. Could not tie you in
[1:55:58] with the revealed message of the hour.
[1:56:00] Could not place you in Christ because it
[1:56:03] was a sealed book.
[1:56:05] But under the change, Elohim is speaking
[1:56:10] through a vindicated message right here
[1:56:12] in
[1:56:13] 2025. And he's speaking your
[1:56:17] name. He's speaking your name. And your
[1:56:20] address is not is not, you know, there
[1:56:23] in Ohio or Oklahoma or South Carolina.
[1:56:27] Your address is
[1:56:29] heaven. It's another gathering. It's a
[1:56:33] different gathering.
[1:56:35] You've left the old ages. You've left
[1:56:38] the old traditions. You left the the
[1:56:41] Sabbaths and the new moons. You've come
[1:56:44] into an eternal
[1:56:46] age. And only
[1:56:48] Elohim could speak a message that would
[1:56:52] meet endtime conditions in 2025 and tell
[1:56:56] you everything you need for the body
[1:56:59] change is already in you.
[1:57:02] [Applause]
[1:57:10] The Bible says that Enoch was 65 years
[1:57:12] old and then all of a sudden there was a
[1:57:15] change.
[1:57:17] And the Bible says that he walked with
[1:57:20] God for 300 years. Something changed.
[1:57:25] You see, Enoch didn't wake up. Enoch is
[1:57:28] the seventh from Adam. It's a type of
[1:57:29] you and I. It's the rapture saints. is
[1:57:32] the translated
[1:57:33] saints. Enoch didn't wake up every
[1:57:37] morning and say, "I hope I'm going to
[1:57:39] make it. I I I hope if the Lord comes
[1:57:42] today that I've got what it takes to be
[1:57:45] translated." No. He had already made the
[1:57:49] change. All Enoch was doing is just
[1:57:51] walking with God.
[1:57:54] He already pleased God. He already had a
[1:57:56] testimony that he had pleased God,
[1:57:58] covered by the blood, testifying of his
[1:58:01] adoption, testifying of who he is in
[1:58:05] Christ. And all the sudden, the Bible
[1:58:08] just simply says that Enoch was not for
[1:58:11] God took him. It was just another day.
[1:58:14] It was just another condition. It was
[1:58:17] just another situation that arose. It
[1:58:19] was just another something at work or
[1:58:21] another something at at home. just
[1:58:24] another condition, another situation.
[1:58:26] But Elohim had already met the
[1:58:29] condition. Elohim had already changed
[1:58:31] something within his soul. Are you
[1:58:33] listening to me, bride? Elohim's already
[1:58:36] dealt with you. He's already changed
[1:58:38] you. He's already quickened you. He's
[1:58:41] already given you the power of
[1:58:43] resurrection. The same spirit that
[1:58:45] raised Christ from the dead has already
[1:58:47] quickened you to immortal life. It's
[1:58:50] another order. It's another It's another
[1:58:53] dispensation.
[1:58:54] [Applause]
[1:58:58] I'm just walking with God and all the
[1:59:01] sudden
[1:59:02] all of the sudden another
[1:59:06] condition just another situation.
[1:59:11] Burnt the eggs at
[1:59:13] breakfast. Made the boss mad for some
[1:59:16] odd reason.
[1:59:18] Another kind of a sickness. another
[1:59:20] something to try to discourage you. But
[1:59:23] the change, you've you've made the
[1:59:25] change. You've turned the corner. The
[1:59:28] denominations have already went on. And
[1:59:31] a modern-day Billy Graham and or Roberts
[1:59:33] has already met that condition. That
[1:59:35] condition is homosexuality, immoral
[1:59:37] living, and all the filth and of the
[1:59:39] world. But you see, Elohim was not sent
[1:59:41] for them. Elohim was sent to that called
[1:59:44] out group that his name was changed from
[1:59:47] Abram to Abraham. And Elohim was there
[1:59:50] to meet the condition. Oh Abraham, I've
[1:59:53] come to visit you according to the time
[1:59:56] of life. And Abraham says, "Be it unto
[1:59:59] me according to thy promise." I tell you
[2:00:02] friends, we are preaching a blood
[2:00:04] covenant under a new order. It's not an
[2:00:07] order of laws. It's not an order of the
[2:00:10] old Aaron and priesthood, but this is
[2:00:12] the order of Melzdc. It's an order of an
[2:00:15] endless life, a five-fold ministry under
[2:00:19] the order of the power of Melzdc
[2:00:22] speaking of blood over the church
[2:00:25] saying, "You're ready. You're ready.
[2:00:28] You're ready. You're
[2:00:32] ready. You're not going to be. You're
[2:00:35] ready,
[2:00:36] son. We're not trying to make the
[2:00:39] rapture. I am the rapture.
[2:00:44] I'm not trying to be a word bride. I am
[2:00:47] the word bride.
[2:00:50] [Applause]
[2:00:52] Under this order, under this
[2:00:54] headship, she is him.
[2:01:00] It's the word bride of the word groom.
[2:01:03] It is the brideg of Christ.
[2:01:08] But we've got to change it now because
[2:01:10] we've got a new confession under this
[2:01:13] order. It's not she is him, but it's I
[2:01:17] am him.
[2:01:19] [Applause]
[2:01:21] No longer is it just my brother. No
[2:01:24] longer is it just my sister. It's me. I
[2:01:28] am him. I am the word bride of the word
[2:01:32] groom. But if you have a different
[2:01:34] confession, you've got the wrong
[2:01:36] revelation. I will be him someday. I
[2:01:40] will be the word bride of the word groom
[2:01:44] someday. The wrong ministry. The wrong
[2:01:48] revelation. It must be present tense. I
[2:01:52] am the word bride. I am Mrs. Jesus
[2:01:56] Christ. I am in the rapture. I am
[2:02:00] gathered under translation faith. Let
[2:02:03] the musicians
[2:02:05] [Applause]
[2:02:06] [Music]
[2:02:07] [Applause]
[2:02:12] come. I am I am predestinated to this
[2:02:16] adoption. I am predestinated to this
[2:02:19] adoption
[2:02:20] authority. The devil is under my feet.
[2:02:22] Not someday, now. There was a power that
[2:02:26] has placed me within this bride. And I
[2:02:29] am bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh,
[2:02:31] revelation of his revelation. Every
[2:02:33] revelation that spoke of the bridegroom
[2:02:35] speaks of the bride. I am invincible.
[2:02:38] I cannot fail.
[2:02:41] I am everything that he is made flesh in
[2:02:44] this age.
[2:02:46] I've been gathered by the word of his
[2:02:48] power.
[2:02:52] relationship.
[2:02:54] Father, we love
[2:02:58] you. We thank you,
[2:03:00] Father. We thank you for this great
[2:03:04] revelation. We thank you for gathering
[2:03:07] us
[2:03:07] together. We thank you, Lord, that you
[2:03:09] have ushered us into eternity right now.
[2:03:13] We don't have to look at our faults, our
[2:03:16] weaknesses, but Lord, there's a power
[2:03:18] that has been placed within our lives
[2:03:22] that we have dominion over this flesh.
[2:03:25] We have dominion over our feelings, our
[2:03:29] emotions, our conscience, our reasoning,
[2:03:31] sensations, what we hear, how we feel,
[2:03:34] what we
[2:03:35] see. We have dominion over those things.
[2:03:39] The devil tries to come and anoint those
[2:03:41] things to tell us that we're not really
[2:03:44] there. It's not meant for us. But Lord
[2:03:48] Jesus, when we listen to this message,
[2:03:50] we are listening to the words of
[2:03:52] omnipotence. We are not feeding upon a
[2:03:55] man, a man. His words will fail. But
[2:03:57] only omnipotence can place this bride.
[2:04:00] And Lord Jesus, this message has been
[2:04:03] vindicated. It has been vindicated
[2:04:05] greater than any message in the history
[2:04:07] of the world. It's a Joshua ministry.
[2:04:10] It's the Holy Ghost placing us in this
[2:04:13] message, showing us our true identity
[2:04:16] and what belongs to us. The inheritance
[2:04:19] that Adam lost has been placed in the
[2:04:22] hands of the bride by the claiming work
[2:04:25] of our kinsman
[2:04:27] redeemer. Lord Jesus, we give you
[2:04:29] praise. Lord, I I pray, Father, that
[2:04:32] through these words and this preaching
[2:04:35] that in the hearts of the people, if
[2:04:36] there was ever a question, I pray that
[2:04:38] there would be a
[2:04:39] change. I pray, God, that every
[2:04:43] person in this in this under this tent
[2:04:46] that there would be such a
[2:04:48] change. Father, that they wouldn't speak
[2:04:51] negative over their lives any
[2:04:53] longer. They wouldn't speak of their
[2:04:55] condition and think negatively any
[2:04:58] longer.
[2:04:59] But father, let them realize, Lord, that
[2:05:02] whenever they play the message or they
[2:05:04] hear their pastor or an evangelist and
[2:05:07] the teacher and so on, they're preaching
[2:05:10] the uncarchable riches of Christ through
[2:05:13] the message of the hour. Lord, it has
[2:05:16] placed them right back under that
[2:05:18] tent. And they have they have a choice
[2:05:23] to wonder how they're going to fulfill
[2:05:25] it, wonder how it could ever be
[2:05:28] them. Or they could go ahead and step up
[2:05:31] to the challenge and say, "That's
[2:05:34] me. I I I heard the voice of
[2:05:38] Elohim. I heard the message of the hour,
[2:05:41] meet my
[2:05:43] condition." That I'm an invincible an
[2:05:46] invincible bride, an invincible army.
[2:05:49] the kingdom of God, his word made power
[2:05:51] in my life. It's it's it's an unmovable
[2:05:55] force. It's everything that we've been
[2:05:57] waiting for at the end of the
[2:05:59] ages. Father, I pray that everyone at
[2:06:02] the sound of my voice would just go
[2:06:04] ahead and step up and say, "That's who I
[2:06:06] am. I heard my name. I heard omnipotence
[2:06:11] speak my name. I've been gathered out of
[2:06:14] those traditions. have been gathered out
[2:06:17] of all of those, the new moons and the
[2:06:20] feast days and the traditions and the
[2:06:22] old Sabbaths. But just as Jesus Christ
[2:06:25] was raised again on the eighth day or
[2:06:28] the first day of the week, so this bride
[2:06:30] has been gathered under the quickening
[2:06:33] power of the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:06:37] in the eighth day.
[2:06:39] transforming power, something to take us
[2:06:42] out of just a tradition to a life to a
[2:06:46] walk with
[2:06:47] you. Oh God, we praise you for it. I
[2:06:51] pray, Father, that there would be
[2:06:53] something within every heart to just
[2:06:54] receive
[2:06:55] it. Just receive it. As Elohim said,
[2:06:59] I've come to visit you according to the
[2:07:01] time of
[2:07:02] life. You've been waiting for the
[2:07:04] promised son. And Lord Jesus, this bride
[2:07:08] has been waiting for the this promised
[2:07:09] son for many ages now. But we are living
[2:07:12] in the change. And the last thing to
[2:07:15] change is the change of our
[2:07:17] bodies. And all the sudden just because
[2:07:21] they heard the voice of omnipotence
[2:07:24] saying that I know your name. I know who
[2:07:27] you are and I've come to meet you. I've
[2:07:30] come to manifest that promised son. Then
[2:07:33] all the sudden change their
[2:07:37] bodies
[2:07:39] changed. Oh Lord Jesus, is there
[2:07:42] anything too hard for
[2:07:45] Elohim? Is there anything too
[2:07:47] hard for the
[2:07:49] omnipotent voice of revelation that is
[2:07:52] speaking to the bride of Jesus Christ in
[2:07:54] this age?
[2:07:55] Oh, Father, I just want to join my my
[2:07:59] voice and my heart with these believers
[2:08:01] and say, "Lord, I
[2:08:04] believe. Lord, I believe it. I believe
[2:08:07] it's for me. I believe I'm missing Jesus
[2:08:10] Christ. I believe we're walking in in in
[2:08:13] with translation faith. We've got
[2:08:16] everything we have need of for it, Lord.
[2:08:19] We've all we've already been made
[2:08:21] perfect by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[2:08:24] We're already been made perfect by a
[2:08:27] mature word that that has brought us up
[2:08:30] to this point in history where we've
[2:08:33] come to a mature position in
[2:08:35] Christ. Lord
[2:08:37] Jesus, come for your bride. We're ready
[2:08:41] for you, Lord, in the name of Jesus
[2:08:44] Christ. Amen. And amen with a shout.
[2:08:52] power in the name of
[2:08:57] Jesus. We've got the
[2:09:02] power in the name of the
[2:09:05] [Music]
[2:09:07] Lord. Though saints are
[2:09:11] raing, we will not be defeated.
[2:09:17] We've got the
[2:09:20] power in the name of the Lord. Give me
[2:09:24] your
[2:09:25] hand. Oh, give me your
[2:09:30] hand. Let's agree
[2:09:34] together that all of our
[2:09:38] iny will crumble at our feet.
[2:09:45] Whatever we find on
[2:09:47] earth shall be bound in heaven
[2:09:52] bound out the name of
[2:09:57] Jesus. Satan has to
[2:10:01] flee. We've got the
[2:10:06] power in the name of Jesus.
[2:10:11] We've got the
[2:10:15] power in the name of the
[2:10:19] Lord. Oh, Satan
[2:10:23] raes. We will not be
[2:10:28] defeated. We've got the
[2:10:32] power in the name of the
[2:10:36] [Music]
[2:10:39] Lord. One day I'm going to take a step
[2:10:45] toward my
[2:10:47] theophony. One day I'm going to take a
[2:10:52] step into my
[2:10:55] theophony. One day I'm going that final
[2:11:00] step is going set me free. My
[2:11:06] theophony I hear it call
[2:11:11] me is call to come
