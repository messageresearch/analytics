[19:49] morning ask brother Terry if you would
[19:51] get ready we want to continue keep
[19:54] brother and sister Walker in prayer
[19:56] we'll just give them encouragement
[20:00] them strength in their bodies
[20:02] amen also
[20:04] we want to pray for the church in Albion
[20:07] they're growing going through some
[20:09] really heavy trials
[20:11] pray that the Lord would
[20:13] help them through these things that
[20:15] they're going through
[20:17] straighten out the situations
[20:20] I want to remember brother Amos this
[20:23] morning Preacher from Brother Steve
[20:24] propolis
[20:26] with Josiah is up in Pennsylvania
[20:28] preaching this morning
[20:30] Andrews down at brother Joe greens
[20:34] pray for our Minister and brothers that
[20:36] the Lord would just use them in a mighty
[20:37] way today unless their services amen how
[20:40] many have a request
[20:43] [Music]
[20:47] remember our pastors he comes to
[20:49] minister
[20:50] this morning that the Lord would just
[20:51] use him in a mighty way
[20:52] [Music]
[21:01] as well as
[21:02] being a lovely day of Mother's Day today
[21:05] is also another special day May the 14th
[21:08] this is Israel's 75th anniversary and of
[21:13] course you know Israel is our timepiece
[21:14] of course
[21:15] they actually celebrated it on the 28th
[21:18] which is a Hebrew calendar they didn't
[21:19] go by the Roman Calendar but Israel's
[21:22] always been a
[21:25] something that we've always like to look
[21:27] to because in the natural the natural
[21:29] types of spirit but spiritual but one
[21:31] thing I always thought was interesting I
[21:33] remember from several years ago
[21:35] Israel become a nation May the 14th 1948
[21:39] recognized by the U.N but brother Ram
[21:42] says when he got his Commission in 1946
[21:44] and said the very same hour that Israel
[21:46] became a nation is when he got his
[21:49] commission from the Lord but that was
[21:51] 1946 so you got a two-year discrepancy
[21:54] my brother Perry green did some research
[21:56] and I remember this from years of
[21:58] probably 40 years ago
[22:00] what happened was according to what his
[22:03] research said David bedgerion which was
[22:05] the first Prime Minister Israel actually
[22:07] made a declaration on that time of 1946
[22:11] that Israel is a nation and he carried
[22:14] that little piece of paper around his
[22:15] pocket for two years and then in 1948
[22:18] they was actually recognized by the
[22:19] United Nations so you know God's Prophet
[22:22] don't make those mistakes if God shows
[22:24] them something there's a reason for it
[22:26] like the bridge or anything else there's
[22:28] a reason for it we may not understand it
[22:30] but it's true it's right so the Bible
[22:33] does say pray for the Peace of Jerusalem
[22:35] that's that will be our future home one
[22:37] day so pay for it pray for Israel and
[22:41] this by our hands Lord Jesus how
[22:43] thankful we are to be back in the house
[22:45] of God lord we're thankful Lord because
[22:47] we have seen in the natural what you
[22:50] have how you have blessed Israel the
[22:53] desert has blossomed like a rose the
[22:55] blessings in the Homeland and Israel is
[22:58] back in her home run the bride is in her
[23:00] Homeland the message of the hour how
[23:02] thankful you are to be associated with
[23:04] this great end time message we're
[23:06] thankful to be a part of it under it
[23:09] Lord and in it we thank you Lord for the
[23:12] wonderful gifts that you've given the
[23:13] fivefold ministry I pray Lord for our
[23:15] brothers three of them out ministering

[47:50] Joe Carter amen back amen we missed you
[47:52] brother Joel Wednesday
[47:54] amen and
[47:56] um
[47:57] uh now this this is a Mother's Day and
[48:02] uh and but but my title is actually just
[48:07] one word and that's Ministry
[48:09] and this may be a little unusual uh for
[48:14] a A Mother's Day um occasion but um
[48:19] yet when I think of ministry
[48:25] um I I or think of mother I think of
[48:27] ministry
[48:29] and uh but my my subject today is not
[48:33] only directed to you mothers but it's
[48:36] it'll be directed to all of us and and I
[48:39] pray that it will help us
[48:42] but I do want to say that uh all of you
[48:46] mothers are invaluable I wished I could
[48:50] express my heart and and in words to
[48:56] um just to express just how I feel and I
[49:02] believe God feels the same but you are
[49:05] invaluable you are you are priceless
[49:10] um proverbs 31 and 10 it talks about the
[49:14] virtuous woman and says who can find a
[49:18] virtuous woman and I I think that if
[49:21] there's any a time that that question is
[49:26] applied it would be applied to the age
[49:28] that we're living in
[49:30] who can find a virtuous woman
[49:33] for her price is far above rubies in
[49:37] other words she's Priceless there's
[49:39] there's there's no price that you could
[49:43] put on a virtuous woman
[49:46] um uh it's there and each of you mothers
[49:50] you
[49:51] you play a tremendous role within the
[49:54] home the family
[49:57] and you know I I know the the world is
[50:02] full of women now we're getting more uh
[50:05] we're the women don't aren't really
[50:07] mothers they don't want to take care of
[50:09] their children they they throwing them
[50:13] in the trash cans killing them getting
[50:16] rid of them whatever it's it's and that
[50:18] is becoming more common but but there
[50:22] are women who have children and I
[50:25] believe that they love their children uh
[50:29] but but they raised their children to be
[50:32] sports players they they raised their
[50:34] children to uh you know to be
[50:37] businessmen they they push them in in
[50:41] um in worldly things and and uh uh in in
[50:46] whatever they they can and if their
[50:49] children can become famous that success
[50:52] to them if they can if they can be on a
[50:55] a ball team that's success if they could
[50:58] be on
[51:00] um you know what whatever uh and if the
[51:03] child wants to be that then they push
[51:05] them but all their energy put all their
[51:07] money their time into supporting that
[51:10] child in into whatever and they take
[51:14] care of their children make sure that
[51:16] they're closed and have food and have
[51:18] things in life and and I I think that's
[51:21] a mother should
[51:24] um uh be that in in that way but that is
[51:28] yet that's still not really what God is
[51:33] is made a woman to be
[51:36] um even though she is to take care of
[51:39] her children she is the lover child she
[51:41] is to uh protect them and and things
[51:44] like that but I believe that today You
[51:48] christian mothers are fulfilling exactly
[51:51] God's purpose in in why he made mother
[51:55] in the first place and that is to raise
[51:58] your children in the in the way of the
[52:01] Lord uh to raise them
[52:04] um you know uh the for the Bible there
[52:08] in Proverbs 22 and 6 it says train up a
[52:12] child in the way he should go and and we
[52:17] now as Christians we know the way he
[52:20] should go and that is in the way of the
[52:22] Lord uh uh you know now now everybody's
[52:26] got their own opinions when it comes out
[52:28] in the world totally things
[52:30] you know if you'd asked just a woman off
[52:35] the street and in in which way her child
[52:38] should go well it's even becoming you
[52:41] know more that they should have the
[52:42] right to choose if if they want to be if
[52:45] if their boy wants to be a girl or if
[52:47] their girl wants to be a guy a boy you
[52:50] know and and and they support these
[52:52] things they they support all kinds of
[52:55] things but according to the Bible there
[52:58] there is one way that a a child should
[53:01] go and that's and and that's the way of
[53:04] the Lord and so therefore as as as as as
[53:07] parents uh we are obligated to to to
[53:12] raise our children in the the way of God
[53:16] uh Abraham Lincoln said that he was what
[53:20] he was he attributes his success or
[53:23] whatever uh to to uh him having a Godly
[53:28] mother who who taught him to pray and to
[53:31] know Jesus as his Savior and so the
[53:35] prophet said your family is what you are
[53:38] so that that's very important because
[53:41] your family reflects you and and so uh
[53:45] brother Branham says in another place
[53:47] you raise your family in a certain
[53:49] environment it's got a 98 percent better
[53:53] chance to go right than it has if you
[53:56] bring it up in the wrong way so then it
[54:00] it's it's that responsibility
[54:03] um whereas as a worldly woman even
[54:06] though she loves her children but she
[54:09] don't she don't look at at maybe
[54:11] consider the friends that they hang
[54:13] around don't consider the environment
[54:15] that they're around every day don't
[54:17] consider they don't consider what kind
[54:20] of literature they read they don't
[54:21] consider the movies they watch they
[54:23] don't consider uh uh maybe what is
[54:26] influencing outside the whole home and
[54:30] and even though they love their children
[54:32] but but yet they they they a lot of
[54:36] women don't have that knowledge and
[54:39] understanding that they there is a a
[54:43] protection there there has to be an
[54:45] environment for children to be in ain't
[54:48] that right now brother Brown said to
[54:50] teach your children to do right to be
[54:52] honest to be square and fair even when
[54:55] they're in school and and so uh that
[54:59] that's that's what mother it's it's a
[55:01] Ministry uh brother Brown said mother is
[55:04] the Fifth Gospel we've got the four
[55:06] gospels here in in the Bible Matthew
[55:09] Mark Luke John but mother is the Fifth
[55:12] Gospel that's what mother is so that's
[55:14] the kind of ministry that Mama has and
[55:17] and he says that you break motherhood
[55:19] then you've broken the back of the
[55:22] nation ain't that right so then mother
[55:25] is a Ministry that God has given to
[55:28] women
[55:29] for their children and and ever it may
[55:33] be so insignificant but uh uh yet or it
[55:37] it it seems It's not insignificant but
[55:40] yet it may seem the least uh uh my uh
[55:44] wife showed me a a saying says when you
[55:48] see a woman that says that that that
[55:50] that that says something and no one
[55:53] responds then then her name is mon uh
[55:58] because that's just about the way it is
[56:00] you know uh she can holler and and
[56:03] hardly no one answers her but uh uh mom
[56:07] goes through so much uh every day she's
[56:10] got a 24-hour uh job and
[56:14] um I I certainly salute uh uh you
[56:17] mothers uh but we not only look at
[56:20] motherhood as being a Ministry
[56:23] uh you know and and a role to play but
[56:28] uh uh you know so the it it it it it it
[56:31] it I want to look at it as that we all
[56:35] we we all have a Ministry to play in no
[56:39] matter what role it is and I I think
[56:42] it's very important that we understand
[56:45] that uh uh because the role that has
[56:50] been given to us it's been given to us
[56:53] by God and so therefore we will be held
[56:58] accountable to God alone for the role
[57:01] that we play whether we do good whether
[57:04] we don't whether we abandon it or
[57:06] whether we whatever
[57:08] we will answer to God for God is the one
[57:12] that gave us the role now what what the
[57:15] problem is today is there is so much
[57:19] discontentment uh in in the world today
[57:23] and people the majority of people are
[57:26] becoming discontent with the role that
[57:30] God has given them to play everyone
[57:33] seems to want to take and I say everyone
[57:36] the majority of of people today seem to
[57:40] want to take the other person's role and
[57:44] someone else's place well brother
[57:47] Branham tells us that in God's economy
[57:49] you can't take another man's place and
[57:53] and another person can't take your place
[57:55] that's how special you are ain't that
[57:58] rhyme when we want to take another
[58:01] person's place then what happens is we
[58:04] lose the value of God's choosing we we
[58:08] lose the value of his choosing and
[58:11] purpose for our lives when we do that
[58:14] God didn't call us to be discontent God
[58:18] called us to be content in the role that
[58:21] we are to play and and to accept it it's
[58:24] it's the devil that tries to that gets
[58:27] us discontent you know that it it's not
[58:30] God it's not the holy spirit it's it's
[58:33] it's it's the devil that that gets us
[58:35] this way and so we we when when we tried
[58:40] to take someone else's place then we
[58:43] lose our value everybody say our value
[58:47] in God's Kingdom
[58:49] because you'll never be successful
[58:51] taking somebody else's place as long as
[58:54] you try to take take the other man's
[58:57] place you you'll never be successful uh
[59:00] you'll only be blessed or have success
[59:04] in God when you fulfill the role that
[59:09] God has called you to fulfill ain't that
[59:13] right and so therefore uh uh uh people
[59:18] to be discontent and unsatisfied they're
[59:22] always wanting to be something different
[59:25] than what God called them to be now the
[59:28] reason for this now brother Brandon
[59:30] would tell us this and and he says the
[59:33] reason there's so much trouble in the
[59:35] church the reason there's so much
[59:38] confusion in the church so much
[59:40] discontentment in the church is not
[59:44] because that Jesus isn't there but it's
[59:47] because that Jesus can't gain access to
[59:50] the places he wants to go ain't that
[59:53] right so that's what causes discontent
[59:56] when God can't have preeminence in him
[59:59] in a person's life then it becomes it
[1:00:03] causes discontentment within that
[1:00:05] individual because they're getting burnt
[1:00:08] out when they're trying to do something
[1:00:10] outside of what God has called them to
[1:00:12] be it doesn't matter what it is no
[1:00:15] matter how much talented they are how
[1:00:17] energetic they are and how much ability
[1:00:20] they have and and whatever it's just
[1:00:22] like again you know brother Brown talks
[1:00:25] about the businessman and yes in their
[1:00:28] place they can make a business go they
[1:00:30] can make it successful that God never
[1:00:32] called them to be behind a Pulpit God
[1:00:35] never called them to try to run a church
[1:00:37] they will fail every time it's because
[1:00:41] it's not the role that they are to play
[1:00:44] ain't that right so we see a lot of
[1:00:47] families failing we see churches failing
[1:00:49] we see people failing we see marriage is
[1:00:52] failing and and the number one I believe
[1:00:55] is discontentment is and and again is
[1:00:59] because we're switching rows everybody
[1:01:00] doesn't wants to take the other person's
[1:01:03] Place everybody wants to tell the other
[1:01:05] person how to do their job and how this
[1:01:08] and how that but see God wants us to be
[1:01:11] settled do you believe that God wants
[1:01:13] his church to be settled and this word
[1:01:16] settled is to become fixed resolved or
[1:01:21] established I I think uh you know uh in
[1:01:25] the Bible you know after Solomon had
[1:01:28] built the temple for the Lord I believe
[1:01:31] he expressed God's desire uh uh you know
[1:01:35] you you go there and and the Bible talks
[1:01:39] about after the he had he had he had
[1:01:41] sacrificed and made all these sacrifices
[1:01:43] and had everything in order then the
[1:01:46] glory of God came down and and filled
[1:01:49] the temple even so much that the priest
[1:01:50] could not Minister and and and these
[1:01:53] things and and he had built the
[1:01:55] Tabernacle for the presence of God right
[1:01:58] and so the First Kings 8 and 12 it says
[1:02:03] then then after the the the the the the
[1:02:05] presence of God come in the Tabernacle
[1:02:08] there then spake Solomon and said uh the
[1:02:13] Lord said that he would dwell in the
[1:02:16] thick Darkness I have surely built thee
[1:02:20] and house to dwell in a saddled place
[1:02:22] place for thee to abide in Forever ain't
[1:02:28] that right well we understand that that
[1:02:30] Temple really wasn't a settled place for
[1:02:33] that place is now gone it it it was
[1:02:36] destroyed it it it is no longer in
[1:02:39] existence and and and and and then we
[1:02:42] find that God didn't his yes it it was a
[1:02:46] type of a temple that was to come ain't
[1:02:49] that right but but if we follow that
[1:02:51] amen that that the Bible says that we
[1:02:55] are the Temple of the Holy Spirit do you
[1:02:57] believe that we are that Dwelling Place
[1:03:00] of Jesus Christ and and so therefore uh
[1:03:05] uh uh what what Solomon was saying I
[1:03:07] have built thee a place for for a a a a
[1:03:11] a a saddled place for thee to abide in
[1:03:14] forever I honestly believe that was he
[1:03:16] was speaking God's desire to look for a
[1:03:20] settled Place ain't that right not a
[1:03:22] place going to and fro not a place just
[1:03:25] just running it but a saddled place and
[1:03:28] I think that is the body of Christ today
[1:03:31] is is that we to become settled saddle
[1:03:34] rooted a man you know uh uh uh Paul the
[1:03:40] Apostle Paul teaches us to continue in
[1:03:43] the faith and to be grounded and and
[1:03:46] settled ain't that right so so then each
[1:03:50] of us are important in God's plan for we
[1:03:54] make up the body of Christ and the body
[1:03:56] is is the Temple of the Holy Ghost right
[1:03:59] so each of us have a lick of fire each
[1:04:02] of us are and we are fitly framed joined
[1:04:06] together in this body separate members
[1:04:09] but as as a whole we make up the temple
[1:04:12] of Jesus Christ amen and and so uh uh uh
[1:04:17] then then each of us as as being a part
[1:04:21] of the body of Christ Christ the bride
[1:04:24] of Christ then we are part of God's plan
[1:04:27] we are we are part of his economy or he
[1:04:32] would not have chose us ain't that right
[1:04:34] now how many is glad he chose you aren't
[1:04:37] you glad he chose you well then then you
[1:04:40] know if if he chose us then he had a
[1:04:43] greater he had a deeper meaning a deeper
[1:04:46] cause to choose you than just coming to
[1:04:49] an altar and making you a a message
[1:04:51] believer a church goer a you understand
[1:04:54] what I'm saying he's got a place for you
[1:04:57] he he's got a specific thing for you to
[1:05:00] do a specific role for you to do ain't
[1:05:03] that right so when we say I'm glad that
[1:05:06] God chose me then then what we're saying
[1:05:09] that has a deeper meaning because then
[1:05:11] we're accepting his choosing we're
[1:05:14] accepting that role that he has chosen
[1:05:16] for us ain't that right we are accepting
[1:05:20] the ministry that he has called us to
[1:05:22] too and nobody can take your place ain't
[1:05:25] that right I don't care how
[1:05:27] insignificant you feel you are no one
[1:05:29] can take your place that's how important
[1:05:32] it is a man to understand this and to be
[1:05:36] faithful in the call that God has chosen
[1:05:39] you to to to to to fulfill so now it's
[1:05:43] the wisdom of God that ordained you to
[1:05:47] where you belong it's it's the wisdom of
[1:05:49] God uh God doesn't do things I have
[1:05:52] hardly he doesn't do things without
[1:05:54] thought but it was all by pre-thought it
[1:05:57] was all by wisdom ain't that right it's
[1:05:59] just like God didn't just create the
[1:06:01] heavens and earth we we read that in the
[1:06:04] beginning God created the heavens and
[1:06:06] earth but if you'll keep on reading you
[1:06:09] find out how he created them heavens and
[1:06:11] earth he created it by his word but
[1:06:13] before it was a word it was a thought
[1:06:15] ain't that right and we find out as you
[1:06:18] read along in the Bible a man that this
[1:06:20] God that did create in heavens and earth
[1:06:22] easy all wise God ain't that right so
[1:06:26] then we understand see the Bible tells
[1:06:28] us that by wisdom everybody say by
[1:06:30] wisdom he made the heavens by wisdom he
[1:06:35] made the heavens Proverbs 3 19 the Lord
[1:06:38] by wisdom hath founded the Earth by
[1:06:42] understanding hath he established the
[1:06:45] heavens so there was no confusion there
[1:06:48] wasn't just God saying let there be and
[1:06:50] then all of a sudden the mass confusion
[1:06:52] and all these things it was by
[1:06:53] understanding that he did it it was by
[1:06:56] wisdom that he did it everything belongs
[1:06:58] where they go
[1:07:00] everything he put every placed
[1:07:02] everything where they go and where they
[1:07:04] belong ain't that right so then we find
[1:07:07] Psalms 104 24 O Lord how manifold are
[1:07:12] thy Works in wisdom everybody's saying
[1:07:16] wisdom thou Hast made them all
[1:07:20] ain't that right so then it gives us a
[1:07:23] deeper understanding that when we read
[1:07:25] in the beginning God created heavens and
[1:07:27] earth we say well why is that star there
[1:07:30] by wisdom God put it there why is the
[1:07:33] sun right there by wisdom God put it
[1:07:35] there why is it so million million miles
[1:07:38] away from the earth by wisdom God put it
[1:07:41] there ain't that right amen so it's in
[1:07:44] its place you we look at the Moon God
[1:07:47] set the moon in its place ain't that
[1:07:49] right by his wisdom it's not just
[1:07:52] hanging there floating free it's there
[1:07:54] in place by the wisdom of God Amen and
[1:07:59] yet in its place or by say in its place
[1:08:02] it controls the tide
[1:08:05] it affects the Earth ain't that right in
[1:08:07] a good way right see in its place amen
[1:08:11] the prophet said if it ever get out of
[1:08:13] order the whole Earth would be flooded
[1:08:15] with water so the moon in its place has
[1:08:19] a Ministry in its place ain't that right
[1:08:22] amen and and so there we look at the
[1:08:25] star God said every Star in his place
[1:08:27] the Bible says he counts them all a man
[1:08:30] and he has named them all a man see so
[1:08:33] he has done this and yet if one of them
[1:08:36] were to get out of line out of its place
[1:08:40] do you realize it would affect us it
[1:08:42] would affect the Earth it would see
[1:08:44] brother Brown said if there's a moving
[1:08:46] anywhere of them for it's for a cause
[1:08:49] and will affect this Earth and then he
[1:08:53] calls it God's Great Army ain't that
[1:08:55] right see God created the heavens and
[1:08:58] earth by his wisdom and by that he made
[1:09:01] an army
[1:09:02] and every one of them in its place
[1:09:05] whether it's the brighter star the
[1:09:07] smaller star amen stars that we can't
[1:09:09] even see with our naked eye they're in
[1:09:12] its place
[1:09:16] ain't that right
[1:09:18] and it's God's Great Army and what God
[1:09:21] done by his wisdom is what did he do he
[1:09:24] made his first Bible
[1:09:27] by the solar system ain't that right he
[1:09:29] made his first Bible men lived off that
[1:09:31] and got Revelation amen from from the
[1:09:34] Stars Enoch was was one that got the
[1:09:37] Revelation by the Stars
[1:09:39] then we find that it was it in there it
[1:09:42] in the stars that tells of the Virgin
[1:09:44] birth and it tells of the second coming
[1:09:46] of of Messiah and and all of these
[1:09:49] things then we find out god's second
[1:09:51] Bible is the Great Pyramid and then his
[1:09:53] third Bible is this written word and
[1:09:55] it's all in its place do you believe
[1:09:58] that that's why we're not to take
[1:09:59] anything add to it or take away from it
[1:10:01] it's by the wisdom of God
[1:10:04] we don't need another book of Maccabees
[1:10:06] we don't need a another book of this we
[1:10:08] don't need just Joseph Smith's book we
[1:10:10] don't need this we don't need that amen
[1:10:12] everything is placed by the wisdom of
[1:10:14] God if we needed to know more it God
[1:10:18] would have put it in the book
[1:10:20] ain't that right but then we find that
[1:10:23] what God is doing today God has a people
[1:10:27] on earth a man who has become the book
[1:10:32] do you believe that they become the word
[1:10:36] that's right and you know how they're
[1:10:38] doing it by the wisdom of God God is
[1:10:42] strategically placing a group of people
[1:10:45] in their place
[1:10:49] now second Corinthians 3 and 2 you are
[1:10:51] are written our epistle written in our
[1:10:54] hearts read and own of all men for as
[1:10:57] much as you are manifestly declared to
[1:10:59] be the Epistle of Christ ministered by
[1:11:01] us not and man having to look at the
[1:11:03] stars not man happen to go to the to to
[1:11:07] Egypt to see the Great Pyramid not man
[1:11:09] even having to look at this
[1:11:12] come on Church Amen brother Brown said
[1:11:15] there's people that won't even read
[1:11:16] their Bibles
[1:11:18] but they'll see the Bible through you
[1:11:20] you are the Bible
[1:11:23] can you say man in your place
[1:11:26] that's right see so but with the spirit
[1:11:29] of the Living God not in tables of stone
[1:11:31] but in fleshly tables of the heart and
[1:11:34] brother random says what did he say the
[1:11:36] word is in the bride
[1:11:39] ain't that right and the mind of Christ
[1:11:41] the wisdom of Christ the revelation of
[1:11:44] Christ is in the bride to know what he
[1:11:48] once done with the word
[1:11:52] ain't that right now now what well the
[1:11:55] beauty of it the beauty of it in my
[1:11:56] opinion is is that that the Stars don't
[1:12:00] have a mind of Their Own
[1:12:02] they just hung there by the word of God
[1:12:05] the the pyramid it has not a mind of its
[1:12:08] own it's there it's been there for years
[1:12:10] and years thousands of years it's there
[1:12:12] right and and then you find the word of
[1:12:15] God here and and and uh uh it it don't
[1:12:19] have a mind of its own in in that way it
[1:12:22] man has tried to burn it and all that
[1:12:24] but it still Remains the Same it's tried
[1:12:27] to destroy it but it can't destroy it
[1:12:29] but then God is able to take people that
[1:12:32] have a mind of their own that have a
[1:12:34] self-will that that that that that that
[1:12:36] is in a a flesh of humanity that that is
[1:12:41] walking in this this this this this
[1:12:43] Valley of the shadow of death that
[1:12:46] having all these mind battles and having
[1:12:48] all these Temptations and and and and
[1:12:51] and have you you a man and and woman boy
[1:12:55] and girl that that is is automatically
[1:12:58] by birth by Nature pulled to the world
[1:13:00] ain't that right and yet he's able to
[1:13:04] take a group of the them people
[1:13:07] not having to change their bodies not
[1:13:10] having to take them out of the world but
[1:13:12] he places in them in the world a man
[1:13:15] with a full of Temptations and and and
[1:13:18] and and and trials and and all of these
[1:13:21] things and he's able to place them in
[1:13:24] his word to where they're settled and
[1:13:28] unmovable in a world of shifting sand
[1:13:34] amen
[1:13:35] that shows that God has been able to
[1:13:37] have preeminence
[1:13:40] he's able to show his mighty power
[1:13:42] through Humanity by giving them a
[1:13:44] self-will and yet placing them in the
[1:13:46] word to where their unmovable settled
[1:13:53] but when one brother random he says if
[1:13:57] that great Heavenly Host
[1:14:00] the the universe Stars Sun Moon
[1:14:04] he says they have to keep their place in
[1:14:08] order to make everything run in order
[1:14:11] what about the disorder of the Earthly
[1:14:15] host
[1:14:17] if if if they the Stars Sun Moon if they
[1:14:22] get out of their place how it affects
[1:14:24] the Earth
[1:14:25] what about the Earthly host
[1:14:28] when one he says gets out of order it
[1:14:31] throws the whole thing out of cater
[1:14:34] it's kind of like the gifts that God
[1:14:35] placed in the church
[1:14:37] when a gift gets out of its place what
[1:14:39] happens it causes confusion
[1:14:42] we believe in speaking in tongues but
[1:14:44] it's got to be kept in its place
[1:14:46] we believe in Divine Healing but you got
[1:14:49] to put it in its place
[1:14:51] ain't that right all the nine spiritual
[1:14:53] gifts that God put in the church they
[1:14:55] must be kept in their place we believe
[1:14:58] in shouting but it has its place
[1:15:01] can you say Amen we we believe in these
[1:15:04] things but but there is an order to it
[1:15:07] there we we there is a place
[1:15:10] I'm quoting Prophet now he said they
[1:15:13] have to be put in its place
[1:15:16] ain't that right yes sir see so now we
[1:15:19] we find that that and and God puts it in
[1:15:23] its place God gave it to the church but
[1:15:25] now it's in this age that the church has
[1:15:28] the wisdom and has the knowledge of his
[1:15:32] mind and Revelation to know what is to
[1:15:35] be done with it
[1:15:37] all right right yes
[1:15:42] that's right
[1:15:46] Psalms 127 and 1
[1:15:50] it says accept the Lord build the house
[1:15:52] everybody say accept the Lord build the
[1:15:54] house
[1:15:56] why do we need the Lord to build the
[1:15:57] house
[1:15:59] because he's the one he's the all-wise
[1:16:01] god
[1:16:02] he does it with wisdom
[1:16:04] he establishes it by understanding
[1:16:07] except the Lord build the house they
[1:16:09] that labor labor in vain that build it
[1:16:12] ain't that right so we've had
[1:16:14] denominations tried to build it can't
[1:16:17] it's falling apart
[1:16:18] we we've the foolish man right the Bible
[1:16:21] talks about the wise man and the foolish
[1:16:23] man right and and so the Seminary can't
[1:16:26] build it it's falling apart amen people
[1:16:28] have school since and and and and and
[1:16:31] politics everybody has tried to build a
[1:16:34] an invincible army they have tried to
[1:16:37] build a a place that that can be a power
[1:16:41] and and a super you know we we become a
[1:16:44] super Nation by our by our uh technology
[1:16:46] and by this and by that and our weaponry
[1:16:49] and our our wisdom and our might and our
[1:16:52] knowledge and all of these things but
[1:16:54] it's never been able to produce an
[1:16:56] invincible Army
[1:16:58] but when God builds the church he knows
[1:17:01] how to do it
[1:17:03] ain't that right so now we're we're not
[1:17:06] building a man where we're not building
[1:17:09] a man by by the instructions of a
[1:17:12] seminary we're not building by the
[1:17:14] instructions of some psychology we're
[1:17:17] not building our family we're not
[1:17:18] Building a Church we're not building our
[1:17:20] lives amen uh by the instructions of
[1:17:24] theology we're building it by the Lord
[1:17:29] wisdom
[1:17:33] notice it takes the Lord to build it
[1:17:35] because Proverbs 24 3 says through
[1:17:38] wisdom everybody say through wisdom
[1:17:40] through wisdom is a house build it
[1:17:43] and by understanding it is established
[1:17:48] so therefore only God has the wisdom and
[1:17:51] understanding as to how the house should
[1:17:54] be built
[1:17:55] and be established in in
[1:17:58] you can use that word house for a lot of
[1:18:01] things but but I looked it up and and
[1:18:03] the word house means family
[1:18:06] and we are God's family do you believe
[1:18:08] that
[1:18:09] we are God's family
[1:18:11] uh Ephesians 2 19 You Are No More
[1:18:14] Strangers and foreigners but fellow
[1:18:16] citizens with the Saints and everybody
[1:18:19] say and of the household of God of the
[1:18:23] family of God do you believe you're part
[1:18:25] of the family of God Amen a family of
[1:18:29] God and are built everybody say I am
[1:18:31] built see your bill you're not just
[1:18:34] thrown in there now he's going to build
[1:18:36] you brother shalom
[1:18:38] to be part of this family you're part of
[1:18:41] the family by birth but now you're going
[1:18:43] to be built
[1:18:45] God's going to place you where you need
[1:18:47] to be
[1:18:48] right
[1:18:54] you don't put the shingles on the root
[1:18:56] of the roof on the floor
[1:18:59] everybody's got its place
[1:19:02] when this is it when it's in its place
[1:19:05] it becomes a sanctuary
[1:19:09] right
[1:19:11] and are built upon the foundation of the
[1:19:13] Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ
[1:19:15] himself being the Chief Cornerstone in
[1:19:18] whom all everybody say all in whom all
[1:19:22] the building
[1:19:24] you you you you you
[1:19:26] all the building
[1:19:28] fitly framed together
[1:19:31] grow with unto and holy Temple in the
[1:19:36] Lord
[1:19:37] in whom you are building together why
[1:19:40] for an habitation of God through the
[1:19:44] spirit
[1:19:47] so we see what God's desire has been
[1:19:50] now Satan has always been one to disrupt
[1:19:54] God's program
[1:19:56] started started it in the in in in
[1:19:59] Genesis and he has continued on
[1:20:02] throughout time
[1:20:04] and he has done this by sowing seeds of
[1:20:07] Discord
[1:20:08] and the word Discord is lack of
[1:20:11] agreement or Harmony
[1:20:13] ain't that right discontent
[1:20:16] and another place brother Brown said he
[1:20:18] wanted fair in in Genesis because Eve
[1:20:22] was looking for new light
[1:20:27] she was already discontent
[1:20:30] she wasn't just satisfied with her role
[1:20:33] she wasn't just satisfied to what God
[1:20:35] Said for her
[1:20:37] ain't that Ryan
[1:20:39] and so Abe now three it was through
[1:20:42] deception of course
[1:20:44] that that Satan was able
[1:20:47] to to Cole's Discord in the home
[1:20:54] he broke up the harmony that existed
[1:20:57] between Adam and Eve
[1:20:59] did it through deception
[1:21:02] and he was able you know uh uh to
[1:21:06] to break up that Harmony not only
[1:21:09] between the relationship of Adam and Eve
[1:21:12] but between them and God
[1:21:15] Harmony was broken because seeds of
[1:21:18] Discord
[1:21:20] ain't that right
[1:21:23] now God was able to bring this harmony
[1:21:26] between him and man again
[1:21:29] by Christ
[1:21:31] you believe it
[1:21:33] that's right
[1:21:35] and and and and when Christ was on Earth
[1:21:37] you saw Harmony again
[1:21:40] the harmony that Adam had
[1:21:43] I think it was even a greater Harmony
[1:21:47] because God was in Christ
[1:21:50] and Jesus said he that has seen me has
[1:21:52] seen the father
[1:21:55] ain't that right
[1:21:56] and Jesus didn't pray that God would
[1:21:59] make us one as he and Adam was one
[1:22:02] but he said make them one as you and I
[1:22:05] are one
[1:22:07] a Oneness that is even stronger
[1:22:12] now brother Brown said speaking of this
[1:22:14] harmony
[1:22:15] notice what Harmony
[1:22:18] Jesus never did anything until Cena the
[1:22:21] father or the father showed him first
[1:22:23] see it was a Harmony between God and
[1:22:26] Christ
[1:22:27] and Satan could not disrupt that Harmony
[1:22:32] did he try it yes
[1:22:34] try deception try Temptation try to
[1:22:38] misconstrue the scriptures try to get
[1:22:41] him out of his place
[1:22:44] ain't that right try to get him to
[1:22:46] fulfill scripture that did not pertain
[1:22:48] for that hour
[1:22:51] sure did
[1:22:53] see but Jesus being the word
[1:22:59] oh my
[1:23:00] him being the word would not move off
[1:23:04] that word
[1:23:06] he knew what the word was for him
[1:23:09] therefore he would not be tempted by it
[1:23:12] he could not be deceived from it
[1:23:15] he stayed right in his place
[1:23:19] now that because of that God was able to
[1:23:23] reconcile you and I man back to himself
[1:23:27] and when God first established his
[1:23:30] church on the day of Pentecost it was
[1:23:33] the beginning of another Masterpiece and
[1:23:36] your brother Brown talks about it in the
[1:23:38] bright tree right
[1:23:39] and and so we we find that first church
[1:23:43] was in perfect harmony with God
[1:23:47] that's what the prophet said perfect
[1:23:50] harmony with God they were full of the
[1:23:53] Holy Ghost he said they walked on water
[1:23:54] they'd done great Miracles and so forth
[1:23:57] A man was so charged talking to Paul was
[1:24:00] so charged with the Holy Ghost a man
[1:24:03] that when that deadly serpent a man bit
[1:24:06] him that deadly uh uh poison could not
[1:24:09] hurt Paul
[1:24:13] could not harming why they were in
[1:24:16] harmony
[1:24:17] he was in his place
[1:24:21] right
[1:24:23] in his place
[1:24:25] you know where Paul was headed
[1:24:27] Jerusalem
[1:24:28] I think it was Jerusalem
[1:24:31] to answer the questions to be to be
[1:24:33] beheaded
[1:24:35] but yet he knew it was the will of God
[1:24:37] where he says I go Bound in the spirit
[1:24:45] it just shows that if a man is in his
[1:24:47] place a person is in their place
[1:24:50] God is obligated to them
[1:24:52] now Satan had he he disrupted that
[1:24:56] Harmony
[1:24:58] As We Know
[1:25:00] he showed up as the Antichrist began to
[1:25:02] work
[1:25:03] Paul warned them
[1:25:06] that the spirit now worketh
[1:25:09] ain't that right I think it was Peter
[1:25:12] that talked Brethren coming in unawares
[1:25:17] they were there the people called them
[1:25:19] brethren
[1:25:22] but Paul being a a messenger
[1:25:27] and these men being full of the Holy
[1:25:29] Ghost they they knew that these these
[1:25:33] men that were called brethren
[1:25:36] were there for the sole purpose
[1:25:39] to disrupt that Harmony
[1:25:42] and they brought in nicolaitanism and
[1:25:44] such you understand what I'm saying
[1:25:46] brother Brown says the whole program of
[1:25:48] God is upset when one member gets out of
[1:25:51] order we should continually to strive to
[1:25:54] keep the order of the spirit
[1:25:57] ain't that right
[1:25:58] so as they as as this happened we
[1:26:01] understand that when the harmony was
[1:26:03] broke against God's word then then Satan
[1:26:07] was able to come and strip the Church of
[1:26:09] the bark of this doctrine of its
[1:26:11] Fellowship of its life its stripped the
[1:26:13] Church of its Joy stripped the Church of
[1:26:16] everything
[1:26:18] but God promised he would restore
[1:26:21] he promised
[1:26:23] to restore you believe that
[1:26:26] and he'd have to restore that Harmony
[1:26:28] between him and and man again
[1:26:34] now notice
[1:26:36] brother Brown said Christ has now taken
[1:26:38] himself a bride to be pregnated with his
[1:26:40] own seed word in her womb Spirit womb in
[1:26:45] her mind and won't mix with any of the
[1:26:47] denominational trash with it she is a
[1:26:51] virgin to him
[1:26:52] now I believe that's who I'm speaking to
[1:26:54] this morning is a people that is a
[1:26:58] virgin to Christ
[1:27:02] this end time message
[1:27:06] one of the the main purposes of it
[1:27:10] that God has sent to us
[1:27:12] it's a Joshua Ministry
[1:27:16] ain't that right
[1:27:17] and and Joshua positionally placed
[1:27:21] the people where God had ordained them
[1:27:23] to be
[1:27:24] and by this message of the hour
[1:27:27] God is placing his people
[1:27:32] exactly where he ordained them to be
[1:27:38] the role that they ordered he ordained
[1:27:40] them to play the place that he ordained
[1:27:43] them to be in
[1:27:46] you say Amen he's placing each member
[1:27:49] and so the the harmony that was between
[1:27:52] God and Christ is now and I say now
[1:27:55] existing between God and his people
[1:28:03] you say well I'm looking for it I'm
[1:28:05] looking for harmony
[1:28:07] that Harmony is here
[1:28:09] I I just believe it
[1:28:12] you may not see it a lot of it but it's
[1:28:14] here
[1:28:15] if the world is coming in harmony with
[1:28:18] the prophecy spoken of their of their if
[1:28:21] America is coming in line with the every
[1:28:23] prophecy that the Bible spoke of if
[1:28:26] Russia is coming in line a man with the
[1:28:29] prophecies that God spoke of her then
[1:28:31] this bride is coming in line with the
[1:28:34] prophecy spoke of her
[1:28:37] you can't tell me that a heathen ungodly
[1:28:40] communistic Nation can come in line more
[1:28:44] quicker than a Spirit-filled bride
[1:28:47] under the message of the hour
[1:28:52] now this harmony brother Robin said
[1:28:55] Jesus never did anything until the
[1:28:57] father showed him first Harmony between
[1:28:59] God and Christ so will the bride
[1:29:01] everybody say so will the bride and he
[1:29:04] shows her his word of life he shows her
[1:29:07] she receives it she never doubts it
[1:29:10] nothing can harm her not even death
[1:29:13] for if the seed be planted the water
[1:29:14] will raise it up again he said amen then
[1:29:17] I got a great big Hallelujah here is the
[1:29:19] secret what is the secret the word is in
[1:29:21] the bride what's the secret to this
[1:29:23] harmony the word is in the bride what's
[1:29:26] the secret to all of this the word is in
[1:29:28] the bride what's making her settled the
[1:29:31] secret is the where is in the bride
[1:29:35] right right she has received it she's
[1:29:37] believed it she's received it
[1:29:40] the word is in the bride and the mind of
[1:29:42] Christ to know what he once done with
[1:29:43] the word and everybody say and she does
[1:29:46] it in his name for she has the saith the
[1:29:50] Lord
[1:29:57] they only they do only his will
[1:30:00] he said he may not believe that no one
[1:30:01] can persuade them different they have
[1:30:03] thus saith the Lord or they keep still
[1:30:04] then they will do the works of God for
[1:30:06] it is himself
[1:30:09] in them continuing his word to fulfill
[1:30:14] so then for this kind of Harmony to
[1:30:17] exist between God and man there has to
[1:30:19] be a new birth
[1:30:21] that the people receive ain't that right
[1:30:23] it's the work of the new birth to bring
[1:30:25] us brother Brown said to bring to us the
[1:30:28] Redemption power of his resurrection
[1:30:30] taken away all Shadows of doubt and
[1:30:33] unbelief and destroying all skepticism
[1:30:36] that the church might move on in perfect
[1:30:40] perfect harmony with the will of God as
[1:30:42] presented by the Bible in the Holy
[1:30:44] Spirit
[1:30:46] now how many believes he has abounded
[1:30:48] toward us in all wisdom and prudence
[1:30:51] I believe he has
[1:30:53] and and Ephesians 1 8 which is I believe
[1:30:56] applied applicable to us he hath abound
[1:30:59] it toward us in all wisdom and Prudence
[1:31:01] when
[1:31:04] Revelations 10 1
[1:31:06] the mighty angel coming having made
[1:31:09] known unto us the mystery of his will
[1:31:12] ain't that right according to his good
[1:31:16] pleasure which he hath purposed in
[1:31:19] himself
[1:31:21] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[1:31:23] of times he might gather together in one
[1:31:28] all things in Christ both which are in
[1:31:31] heaven which are on earth even in him
[1:31:35] again believe it or not there are people
[1:31:37] on this Earth that have come into
[1:31:38] harmony with God
[1:31:40] Walking In Harmony
[1:31:43] in their plates
[1:31:44] the mystery of his will has been made
[1:31:46] known to them they are walking in
[1:31:48] compliance to his will they are here to
[1:31:51] carry out his will and his will alone
[1:31:55] ain't that right when their will
[1:31:57] struggles against his will they do
[1:31:59] exactly the way Jesus did it not my
[1:32:01] father not my will but thine will be
[1:32:04] done and every one of us has our Garden
[1:32:06] of Gethsemane every one of us has to
[1:32:09] come to that time where we say father
[1:32:10] knock my will but thine be done
[1:32:15] that's right why it's headship it's the
[1:32:19] word that has come to have preeminence
[1:32:22] and to place us exactly where he wants
[1:32:26] us to be then
[1:32:28] only then
[1:32:31] do we become successful in our
[1:32:33] Ministries
[1:32:38] and I want to say this
[1:32:42] the people that God has given you to
[1:32:45] influence they need you to stay in your
[1:32:48] place
[1:32:51] they need you
[1:32:55] could you imagine if the moon had a mind
[1:32:57] of its own
[1:32:59] and we heard it complaining
[1:33:01] he said I'm tired of hanging right here
[1:33:04] I I think I'm going to go on the north
[1:33:06] side
[1:33:08] maybe on the North side maybe this is
[1:33:10] the South Side I don't know
[1:33:13] and how many of us if if I know this is
[1:33:16] maybe two maybe too dramatic but
[1:33:20] and if we heard that Moon saying this
[1:33:22] how many of us be petitioning
[1:33:26] writing letters sending email whatever
[1:33:29] convincing that Moon stay in your place
[1:33:32] because it'll affect us if you don't
[1:33:37] but I'm so glad it ain't got a mind of
[1:33:38] its own
[1:33:42] right
[1:33:44] but here I'm talking to a people that's
[1:33:45] got a mind of Their Own
[1:33:48] submit your will to Christ's will
[1:33:51] stay in your place
[1:33:58] so there's people that is fulfilling the
[1:34:00] will they're not resisting nor are they
[1:34:01] in Rebellion to what God requires of
[1:34:03] them
[1:34:05] first Peter 4 1 for as much then as
[1:34:08] Christ has suffered for us in the flesh
[1:34:10] arm yourselves likewise with these same
[1:34:12] mind
[1:34:14] for he that has suffered In the Flesh
[1:34:16] has ceased from sin
[1:34:18] that he should he no longer should live
[1:34:21] the rest of his time in the flesh to the
[1:34:24] lust of men but to the will of God
[1:34:27] now I have said all this as as a
[1:34:30] foundation
[1:34:32] to get to to another thing and and I'll
[1:34:35] try to hurry
[1:34:37] that God is again called every one of us
[1:34:40] to Ministry
[1:34:41] you have a Ministry
[1:34:44] Ministry is the meaning of it is an
[1:34:49] agent or instrument a person or thing
[1:34:51] through which something is accomplished
[1:34:56] God could all done himself he could have
[1:34:58] chose the wind to preach the gospel but
[1:34:59] he chose man
[1:35:02] he chose he could have chose some other
[1:35:03] way than motherhood but he chose
[1:35:05] motherhood
[1:35:07] he chose he could have chose some other
[1:35:09] way than fatherhood but he chose
[1:35:10] fatherhood
[1:35:11] he chose he could have chose some other
[1:35:13] way than the fivefold ministry but he
[1:35:14] chose the five-fold ministry
[1:35:17] he ordained because he uses man
[1:35:20] you with me
[1:35:22] and Ministry involves service to another
[1:35:26] in other words it's serving when you
[1:35:28] serve another you are ministering
[1:35:34] this nation has ministers
[1:35:37] brother Matthew you're a minister
[1:35:40] as a firefighter
[1:35:42] you Minister Aid policemen ministers
[1:35:46] emergency workers their ministers
[1:35:49] why they are public servants to those
[1:35:52] who are in need
[1:35:54] that right
[1:35:56] we have the office
[1:35:59] of Senator Congressman president
[1:36:06] they are ministers
[1:36:07] to the American people
[1:36:10] because they are servants they are
[1:36:12] public servants
[1:36:14] to the American people ain't that right
[1:36:16] they're here to serve
[1:36:19] God has his own ministers
[1:36:22] we look at if if a nation has to have
[1:36:24] ministers and God will have his
[1:36:26] ministers in his kingdom
[1:36:29] is that right
[1:36:31] the man who preaches the gospel is
[1:36:34] commonly known as a minister
[1:36:38] brother Brown said the reason why I
[1:36:39] Minister studies and meditates in the
[1:36:41] scripture and seeks for inspiration is
[1:36:43] because he is a public servant to God's
[1:36:46] people
[1:36:47] so where is this call
[1:36:49] study meditate in the word
[1:36:55] right
[1:36:56] because he's a minister he's a public
[1:36:58] servant to God's people and he's trying
[1:37:01] to find something uh that will that God
[1:37:04] would have to say to his people
[1:37:06] something that will help them
[1:37:09] maybe it might can be condemn them in
[1:37:12] their sins but would be a help to raise
[1:37:16] them up that they might forsake their
[1:37:19] sins and then raise up to serve the Lord
[1:37:22] and ministers should seek these things
[1:37:27] then what what is it then the people
[1:37:29] that hear that minister
[1:37:33] undertake what that Minister says and
[1:37:35] practices it
[1:37:36] put it to practice in their life put it
[1:37:39] to practice in their home
[1:37:41] put it to practice Deuteronomy 4 and 1.
[1:37:44] says now therefore hearken o Israel unto
[1:37:47] the statues and judge the judgments
[1:37:49] which I teach you for to do them that
[1:37:53] they that you may live and go in and
[1:37:56] possess the land which the Lord God of
[1:37:58] your fathers giveth you
[1:38:00] you shall not add unto the word which I
[1:38:02] command you neither shall you diminish
[1:38:04] ought from it that you may keep the
[1:38:06] Commandments of the Lord your God which
[1:38:08] I command you ain't that right now you
[1:38:11] might say well that was the prophet
[1:38:12] Moses he's the one that God gave him the
[1:38:15] word to so we follow that and that's
[1:38:18] true that that's very true
[1:38:20] well let's look we read in Exodus 18 12
[1:38:23] is a little lengthy but we're going to
[1:38:26] read it anyways and Jethro Moses
[1:38:28] father-in-law took a burnt offering and
[1:38:31] sacrifice for God and Aaron came and all
[1:38:35] the elders deep bred with Moses
[1:38:37] father-in-law before God and it came to
[1:38:40] pass on the mara that Moses sat to judge
[1:38:43] the people and the people stood by Moses
[1:38:45] from morning unto evening and when Moses
[1:38:48] father-in-law saw all that he did to the
[1:38:50] people he said what is this thing that
[1:38:52] thou doest to the people why satis thou
[1:38:55] thyself alone and all the people stand
[1:38:57] by thee for mourning unto even
[1:39:00] and Moses said unto his father-in-law
[1:39:02] because the people come unto me to
[1:39:04] inquire of God when they have a matter
[1:39:07] they come unto me and I judge between
[1:39:09] one and another and I do make them know
[1:39:11] the statutes of God and his laws and
[1:39:13] Moses father-in-law said unto him the
[1:39:16] thing that thou doest is not good thou
[1:39:19] Wilt surely wear away both thou and this
[1:39:22] people that is with thee for this thing
[1:39:24] is too heavy for thee Thou Art not able
[1:39:26] to perform in thyself alone heart and
[1:39:29] now unto my voice I will give thee
[1:39:31] counsel and God shall be with thee be
[1:39:34] thou for the people the God's word that
[1:39:36] thou mayest bring the causes unto God
[1:39:38] and thou shalt teach them ordinances and
[1:39:41] laws and shall show them the way wherein
[1:39:45] they must walk and the work that they
[1:39:47] must do moreover Thou shalt provide out
[1:39:50] of all the people Abel men such as fear
[1:39:53] God men of Truth hating covetness and
[1:39:56] place such over them to be rulers of
[1:39:58] thousands rulers of hundreds rulers of
[1:40:00] these rulers of tens and let them judge
[1:40:04] the people at all seasons and it shall
[1:40:06] be that every great matter they shall
[1:40:08] bring unto thee but every small matter
[1:40:10] they shall judge so it shall be easier
[1:40:13] for thyself and they shall bear the
[1:40:16] burden with thee if Thou shalt do this
[1:40:18] thing and God command thee so then Thou
[1:40:21] shalt be able to endure and all these
[1:40:24] people shall also go to their place in
[1:40:26] peace
[1:40:27] so Morrow's Moses hearken to the voice
[1:40:29] of his father-in-law and did all that he
[1:40:31] had said and Moses chose Abel man out of
[1:40:34] all Israel and made them heads over uh
[1:40:37] the people rulers of thousands rulers of
[1:40:40] hundreds of fifties of of tens and they
[1:40:43] judged the people at all seasons the
[1:40:45] hard causes they brought unto Moses but
[1:40:47] every small matter they judged
[1:40:49] themselves ain't that right so here the
[1:40:52] prophet said see Moses when he was tired
[1:40:54] his father-in-law said unto him you're
[1:40:56] wearing yourself out pray God to take
[1:40:59] your spirit and put it on others
[1:41:03] and he prayed he took the spirit God
[1:41:06] took the spirit and put it on Seventy
[1:41:09] others and 70 began to prophesy they
[1:41:11] didn't have any more power they had more
[1:41:14] machinery
[1:41:16] that's all they just had more Machinery
[1:41:19] that's the way it is today one man can't
[1:41:21] do it God's got his Machinery working
[1:41:24] everywhere but it's the same power same
[1:41:27] holy spirit it's the same Jesus
[1:41:31] ain't that right
[1:41:33] now we know that in the Bible the the
[1:41:36] Apostle Paul being the first church age
[1:41:38] Messenger to the Gentile
[1:41:41] he said this uh Ephesians 4 11 he gave
[1:41:45] he God gave some Apostles prophets
[1:41:48] Apostles some evangelists some pastors
[1:41:51] and teachers why for the perfecting of
[1:41:54] the Saints
[1:41:56] for the work of the ministry
[1:41:58] for the edifying of the body of Christ
[1:42:00] till we all come to the unity of the
[1:42:01] faith and of the knowledge of the son of
[1:42:03] man unto a perfect unto the perfect
[1:42:05] measure of the stature of the fullness
[1:42:07] of Christ that we henceforth be no more
[1:42:11] children
[1:42:13] and carried about with every wind of
[1:42:16] Doctrine by the slight of men and
[1:42:18] cunning craftness whereby they lie in
[1:42:20] Wake to deceive
[1:42:22] so that's why God gives the ministry to
[1:42:27] the church
[1:42:29] ain't that right and we could go more
[1:42:31] and more but but I I do say this because
[1:42:34] Satan is doing his best to discredit
[1:42:37] God's Ministry
[1:42:40] take him out of the pulpit them all you
[1:42:43] need to do is play tapes
[1:42:46] there's not one time that the prophet
[1:42:48] said just play tapes
[1:42:51] and you say Amen amen God gave the
[1:42:54] church the fight for Ministry the
[1:42:57] prophet of this hour condoned it and he
[1:42:58] said I preached what Paul preached
[1:43:01] and Paul preached a five-fold Ministry
[1:43:03] and you say Amen
[1:43:05] but notice where the faithful Ministry
[1:43:07] and I I pray you're listening now but
[1:43:10] but notice where the fivefold ministry
[1:43:13] fits in coordination with the prophet
[1:43:16] we find that the second and third
[1:43:18] chapters of Revelations takes the entire
[1:43:21] time with God dealing with the the
[1:43:25] Gentile uh Church unto salvation
[1:43:30] and when God addresses each age
[1:43:34] he says the same exact thing in the
[1:43:38] opening and in the closing
[1:43:40] ain't that right he begins with unto the
[1:43:43] messenger of Ephesus then he begins unto
[1:43:46] the messenger of Sardis under the
[1:43:49] messenger of laodicea Unto the messenger
[1:43:52] of Philadelphia ain't that right and
[1:43:56] then he ends the message to each age by
[1:44:00] saying he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:44:03] what the spirit saith to the church
[1:44:07] ain't that right now notice what the
[1:44:10] prophet says he says here see Jesus by
[1:44:13] by the spirit in every age addresses
[1:44:17] himself to only one person relative to
[1:44:20] the word for that age
[1:44:22] only one messenger for each age receives
[1:44:27] what the spirit has to say to that age
[1:44:29] and that one messenger is the messenger
[1:44:33] to the true church
[1:44:36] do the true church
[1:44:41] he speaks for God by Revelation to the
[1:44:45] churches both true and false
[1:44:48] the messages then brought Christ to all
[1:44:51] but though it is broadcast for all who
[1:44:54] come within range of the message that
[1:44:56] message is received individually by only
[1:44:59] a certain qualified group in a certain
[1:45:02] way
[1:45:03] each individual of that group is one who
[1:45:06] has the ability to hear what the spirit
[1:45:08] is saying by way of the messenger those
[1:45:10] who hear uh those who hear are not
[1:45:14] getting their own private Revelation nor
[1:45:16] is the group getting their Collective
[1:45:18] Revelation but each person is hearing
[1:45:21] and receiving what the messenger has
[1:45:25] already received from God
[1:45:28] and Iran now Paul said this this this
[1:45:31] pattern uh under the hand of God for he
[1:45:35] alone had the full revelation of his day
[1:45:38] for his day and the you go read the
[1:45:42] Bible the other Apostles admitted that
[1:45:44] Paul had that revelation
[1:45:46] and they all supported Paul and and they
[1:45:50] would establish Paul's uh uh credentials
[1:45:53] and and and lift him up
[1:45:57] and I'm not saying magnifying the man
[1:45:59] you know what I'm saying but anybody
[1:46:01] that would come against the message that
[1:46:02] Paul preached they defended it
[1:46:06] and you say Amen
[1:46:08] now the prophet said in every age we
[1:46:10] have this same exact pattern
[1:46:13] he said that is why the light comes
[1:46:15] through some god-given messenger in a
[1:46:18] certain area and then from that
[1:46:21] messenger their spreads Delight through
[1:46:23] the ministry of others who have been
[1:46:26] Faithfully taught
[1:46:30] then he says but of course all those who
[1:46:33] go out don't always learn how necessary
[1:46:36] it is to speak only what the messenger
[1:46:39] has spoken
[1:46:41] and we find that even in the message of
[1:46:43] the hour
[1:46:44] not every Minister you can trust that
[1:46:47] preaches the message
[1:46:49] there's others adding their own ideas
[1:46:51] their own theology they they ain't come
[1:46:53] out of Babylon all the way they ain't
[1:46:55] listening to the tapes
[1:46:59] they'll tell you that it's brother
[1:47:00] branham's opinion it'll tell you this
[1:47:02] they'll tell you that they tell you well
[1:47:04] he got this Revelation or he leaned this
[1:47:06] way because it was Baptist teaching or
[1:47:08] it was because of this no it was because
[1:47:11] he received a revelation from God
[1:47:16] ain't that right
[1:47:17] so then Satan uses these men to try to
[1:47:21] disrupt God's program
[1:47:24] like in the beginning but I tell you
[1:47:27] this their efforts are futile
[1:47:30] they'll never succeed
[1:47:33] and you say man why the word everybody
[1:47:35] say the word is already in the bride
[1:47:39] the word is already in you
[1:47:42] can you say man now notice what Paul
[1:47:45] would or brother Brown would tell us
[1:47:47] remember Paul warned the people to say
[1:47:49] only what he said First Corinthians 14
[1:47:51] 37 If any man thank himself to be a
[1:47:53] prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge
[1:47:55] that the things that I write unto you
[1:47:57] are the Commandments of the Lord what
[1:47:59] came the word out of God out from you or
[1:48:02] came it unto you only see they add here
[1:48:05] take away there and soon the message is
[1:48:07] no longer pure and the Revival dies down
[1:48:11] how careful we must be to hear one voice
[1:48:15] for the spirit has but one voice which
[1:48:18] is the voice of God
[1:48:21] but if you'll notice Satan cannot get to
[1:48:24] this Bride for this age
[1:48:27] remember he said remember we are now as
[1:48:30] his bride with the spirit how many is
[1:48:32] pregnated with the spirit oh my the
[1:48:35] church bearing children pregnated by his
[1:48:38] spirit with his name bear in his name
[1:48:40] bear in his life bringing forth the
[1:48:43] signs of his life evident with the
[1:48:45] preeminances evidence of his
[1:48:47] resurrection showing that he is not dead
[1:48:49] but He's Alive forevermore this is
[1:48:52] eternal life and Vindicated vindicates
[1:48:55] to the world that we are alive in him
[1:48:58] he said how do you know because you're
[1:49:00] because you're a church member no
[1:49:02] because Christ is living through you so
[1:49:04] pregnated with the spirit that you're a
[1:49:06] prisoner day anything else you're
[1:49:08] confined oh my to the gospel confined to
[1:49:11] the word and all the children that you
[1:49:13] bring can bring forth is that
[1:49:19] right
[1:49:20] you can't bring forth foolish virgin and
[1:49:23] say they're children
[1:49:26] hello there's only one Ministry that a
[1:49:29] message preacher should have and that's
[1:49:31] for this elect
[1:49:34] that's right so brother Bram goes on and
[1:49:37] says you can't commit adultery you're
[1:49:39] already pregnated
[1:49:42] you believe it you're pregnant with the
[1:49:44] word of God you're already pregnated
[1:49:47] well some of you are are you pregnant
[1:49:49] with word of God
[1:49:52] see you're already pregnant Satan cannot
[1:49:55] take a hold the womb of life is close to
[1:50:00] everything else you're already his by
[1:50:04] predestination
[1:50:08] that seed has to come to life no world
[1:50:10] can get in it oh I would like to stay on
[1:50:13] that for an hour he says I'm sure you
[1:50:15] understand Christ and he is alone
[1:50:16] already finished the seed was there the
[1:50:19] seed was already when was it put there
[1:50:21] before the foundation of the world has
[1:50:23] predestinated us unto eternal life
[1:50:26] and as soon as the life-giving flow that
[1:50:29] seed laying there other seeds that would
[1:50:31] just come in wouldn't take hold it just
[1:50:34] can't do it
[1:50:35] but when that seed
[1:50:39] word seed predestinated seed came in
[1:50:42] quickly it stopped up the womb and all
[1:50:45] the rest of the seed was drove out like
[1:50:47] that
[1:50:49] now
[1:50:50] we're living in a in an age that Jesus
[1:50:53] called wicked and adulterous
[1:50:56] right
[1:50:57] not only in the natural but also in the
[1:51:00] spiritual
[1:51:01] but brother Brown said you can't do it
[1:51:03] you can't you can't commit adult the
[1:51:05] seed is already there your wounds
[1:51:06] already closed up you already pregnated
[1:51:09] with the word of God
[1:51:12] is that right
[1:51:13] so the bride cannot be deceived
[1:51:16] so therefore we see the position
[1:51:19] of the fivefold ministry the genuine
[1:51:23] Ministry brother brand or Hebrews 13 13
[1:51:26] says obey them that have the rule over
[1:51:29] you and submit yourselves for they watch
[1:51:31] for your souls as they must give in an
[1:51:34] account that they may do it with joy and
[1:51:37] not with grief for that is unprofitable
[1:51:39] for you
[1:51:40] is that right
[1:51:42] brother Ram said it's the word that
[1:51:44] rules us
[1:51:46] not men the word
[1:51:52] another place he says amen as a a man as
[1:51:56] a husband is the head of the woman he
[1:51:59] rules her
[1:52:00] but the church is a woman too and her
[1:52:02] ruler is the word
[1:52:04] Jesus is the word if she rejects the
[1:52:07] word and takes any other headship she is
[1:52:10] an adulteress
[1:52:12] now you name me one church that hasn't
[1:52:15] given up the word for traditions and
[1:52:16] creeds
[1:52:19] so here we are a virtuous woman
[1:52:23] priceless
[1:52:25] rare
[1:52:28] and you say man
[1:52:31] now notice not only does the the
[1:52:34] preacher have a Ministry but now it's to
[1:52:36] be carried down to the parents
[1:52:41] Deuteronomy 6 6 and these words which I
[1:52:44] command thee this day shall be in thine
[1:52:46] heart
[1:52:48] I want to I want to say this
[1:52:51] do you
[1:52:53] you need to take every service
[1:52:57] seriously
[1:53:01] take every message that you listen to on
[1:53:04] tape seriously
[1:53:08] because it's got to be put in your heart
[1:53:12] that was the order
[1:53:14] that the word be put in your heart
[1:53:16] things that have been commanded and
[1:53:17] things that have been taught put it in
[1:53:19] your heart
[1:53:21] see it ain't gonna be the preacher
[1:53:23] responsible it'll be you responsible for
[1:53:25] rejecting these things
[1:53:27] well I don't need to go to church I'll
[1:53:29] go do something else and it could be
[1:53:30] that God wanted you to be there to hear
[1:53:32] something
[1:53:34] but you put it off for whatever
[1:53:38] and you you'll you'll be responsible for
[1:53:41] that you know that
[1:53:43] because see that's the only way your
[1:53:45] ministry works
[1:53:46] now if you want to just be a worldly
[1:53:48] parent
[1:53:49] and just go be a worldly parent it'd be
[1:53:51] better for you to just be a worldly
[1:53:53] parent than to come in here playing with
[1:53:55] God
[1:53:56] and teaching your children that just to
[1:53:59] be half half lukewarm because we know
[1:54:02] what well be lukewarm because the
[1:54:04] prophet you know what Jesus gives for
[1:54:06] this age is because Thou Art neither hot
[1:54:09] nor cold I'll spew you out of my mouth
[1:54:12] so to to play with God and to come to be
[1:54:16] the judge of the preacher instead of the
[1:54:17] word judging you too many people come to
[1:54:20] church to judge the preacher
[1:54:22] and they take what they want they take
[1:54:24] what they and and leave what they don't
[1:54:26] want
[1:54:27] and it don't matter to me it don't
[1:54:29] matter to even to the prophet it didn't
[1:54:31] matter we'd preach it anyways
[1:54:34] and then you're responsible for it
[1:54:38] right
[1:54:39] so so then the address to the parents is
[1:54:44] these words which I command thee this
[1:54:46] day shall be in thine heart and thou
[1:54:50] shalt you're obligated now
[1:54:52] shall teach them diligently everybody
[1:54:54] say diligently
[1:54:57] diligently unto thy children
[1:55:00] and thou shall talk of them when thou
[1:55:02] sit us in thine house and when thou walk
[1:55:04] is by the way and when thou lie is down
[1:55:07] and when thou Rises up
[1:55:11] I hope we understand
[1:55:14] the ministry
[1:55:16] so parents are ministers in that they
[1:55:18] Echo this message to their children
[1:55:21] outside of that everybody say outside of
[1:55:23] that outside of that is chaos and
[1:55:27] disorder
[1:55:28] Satan disrupts the program of God
[1:55:34] will bring in movies where man and wife
[1:55:36] or man or woman is kissing and the
[1:55:39] prophet tells us
[1:55:41] that it's it's it's the sex
[1:55:45] it's it's actually committing adultery
[1:55:47] when a man and a woman outside of
[1:55:49] marriage kisses
[1:55:53] so see there's things that's got to be
[1:55:56] in our heart we have to put it in our
[1:55:57] heart
[1:55:59] before before our ministry is effective
[1:56:06] right we get it to the place that will
[1:56:08] you you ain't gonna tell me what to do
[1:56:09] well I'm not
[1:56:12] I'll tell you what God tells you to do
[1:56:15] then that's up to you what you want to
[1:56:16] do with it
[1:56:19] but but here's the thing we're not
[1:56:21] playing Church no more
[1:56:23] God sent a message I mean what what what
[1:56:26] we see
[1:56:27] that that that pillar fire but that
[1:56:30] Cloud's coming that's the judge he's
[1:56:32] having preeminence
[1:56:35] he's setting it all straight in his law
[1:56:40] amen and you say man
[1:56:43] so now every one of us who is part of
[1:56:46] the body of Christ Our ministers
[1:56:51] if you take and look at your mother's
[1:56:53] you'll find out what a real minister is
[1:56:57] as she's in her role
[1:56:59] now notice
[1:57:01] I hope this is okay
[1:57:03] I'll try to hurry God sent Luther with
[1:57:06] the word
[1:57:07] the Lutheran spoke for God at that time
[1:57:09] but they organized and again the pure
[1:57:11] word was lost for organization tends
[1:57:14] toward dogma and Creeds and not simple
[1:57:16] word they could no longer speak for God
[1:57:18] see Satan was able to disrupt the
[1:57:20] program then God sent Wesley and he was
[1:57:24] the voice with the word in his day the
[1:57:25] people who took his Revelation from God
[1:57:27] became living Epistles and read and
[1:57:29] known of all men for their generation
[1:57:31] when the methodists failed God raised up
[1:57:33] others and so has it gone on through the
[1:57:36] years until in this last day there is
[1:57:38] again again that's us another people in
[1:57:41] the land who under their Messenger will
[1:57:43] be the final voice to the final age
[1:57:46] yes sir the church is no longer the
[1:57:48] mouthpiece of God it's its own
[1:57:49] mouthpiece so God is turning on her he
[1:57:52] will confound her through the Prophet
[1:57:53] The Bride for the voice of God will be
[1:57:57] in her
[1:57:59] well he's not he's not saying that every
[1:58:03] one of us are going to be preachers in
[1:58:05] behind the pulpit be saying that we all
[1:58:08] will be the voice of God to end the role
[1:58:10] that we are playing
[1:58:12] that he's ordained us because notice how
[1:58:14] we need in Jeffersonville Blacksburg
[1:58:18] Christiansburg the world
[1:58:20] thousands of lived voices
[1:58:24] the Thunder of God thundering out in
[1:58:26] sweetness and Holiness Purity undefiled
[1:58:29] lives walking around in the Earth today
[1:58:31] without a blemish yes sir real
[1:58:33] Christians that's the Thunder against
[1:58:34] the enemy the devil don't care how loud
[1:58:37] you can holler the devil don't care how
[1:58:38] loud you can jump and how much you can
[1:58:40] do this or shout what hurts but What
[1:58:42] Hurts The Devil is to see that
[1:58:44] Sanctified holy life consecrated to God
[1:58:46] say anything to him call him anything
[1:58:48] just as sweet as it can be and move
[1:58:51] right on throws him away that's the
[1:58:53] Thunder that shakes the devil
[1:58:56] so we understand that that it's more
[1:58:59] than just just just a a a preaching
[1:59:02] behind a Pulpit
[1:59:04] the ministers called for that the
[1:59:06] preachers called for that but every one
[1:59:08] of us is just as important
[1:59:12] hope I get that clear to you Romans 14 7
[1:59:16] for none of us live to himself or no man
[1:59:19] dieth to himself so then every member of
[1:59:22] us every one of us members of the Bride
[1:59:24] has an influence
[1:59:26] you believe it
[1:59:27] outside of your role your influence will
[1:59:30] destroy
[1:59:31] your influence will break a church apart
[1:59:33] will break a marriage apart we'll break
[1:59:35] a home apart
[1:59:38] people's use their influence instead of
[1:59:39] bringing together they brought in to
[1:59:41] destroy
[1:59:42] people's lives
[1:59:46] but in your role you have an influence
[1:59:53] by God by his wisdom has given each of
[1:59:56] us a road to play you mothers have a
[1:59:58] role
[1:59:59] you fathers have a role every one of you
[2:00:01] husbands
[2:00:04] you have a role in your home you are to
[2:00:06] be the head of your home
[2:00:08] you believe that
[2:00:10] you are to give honor to your wife as
[2:00:12] Paul would say for she's the weaker
[2:00:14] vessel
[2:00:15] or as she is the weaker vessel ain't
[2:00:18] that right in other words respect her in
[2:00:21] the role that she is in her role in the
[2:00:23] family
[2:00:25] respect her as the weaker vessel and
[2:00:28] lead your family
[2:00:30] don't give that responsible to her
[2:00:32] that's not her role
[2:00:38] you know the prophet said about Abraham
[2:00:40] and said Abraham couldn't tell Sarah
[2:00:42] everything that God told him
[2:00:48] quiet but it's true I know that's
[2:00:51] totally contradictory to the age we live
[2:00:53] in
[2:00:57] but brother Ram said God couldn't do
[2:00:59] that Abraham couldn't tell Sarah
[2:01:01] everything because she was the weaker
[2:01:04] vessel she was weak in faith
[2:01:07] so he had to act he had to be the leader
[2:01:10] he had to show
[2:01:11] he had to be strong the Bible says he
[2:01:13] was strong in faith and say she was
[2:01:15] strong in faith now she had faith
[2:01:18] and she's named in the book
[2:01:20] of Faith the Hall of Fame
[2:01:23] but the prophet said she was weak in
[2:01:25] faith
[2:01:29] and so he says see Sarah never was too
[2:01:32] strong anyhow in faith because she
[2:01:33] lacked
[2:01:34] she disbelieved the promise but Abraham
[2:01:37] held her because the man and woman are
[2:01:40] one
[2:01:42] it was the woman that was deceived not
[2:01:43] man ain't that right
[2:01:45] down Through the Ages Satan has always
[2:01:47] worked through woman he's been able to
[2:01:49] find a woman and work through her
[2:01:52] and that's not to just degrade anything
[2:01:56] but I will say he's sure using women
[2:01:58] today
[2:02:01] woman has become the god of the age
[2:02:04] worshiped
[2:02:07] they can her role in leading the home
[2:02:11] trying to lead our nation
[2:02:14] leading churches
[2:02:17] got deaconesses
[2:02:23] right
[2:02:26] and so then if we can understand that
[2:02:29] then it shows that every one of us
[2:02:33] brethren we have a Ministry
[2:02:36] to our home
[2:02:38] don't let her Lead You by the nose
[2:02:41] don't let her you know like brother
[2:02:42] Brandon said yeah you're the head but
[2:02:44] she turns your head she's The Knack
[2:02:48] don't let her do that see
[2:02:51] you got to stay in the role now if you
[2:02:54] sisters understand the role you'll
[2:02:57] appreciate it
[2:03:02] brother Brown says that we're not to use
[2:03:04] our wives as a doormat
[2:03:09] right
[2:03:10] she's not your slave
[2:03:14] but yet at the same time
[2:03:16] you wives have a role
[2:03:20] really random says as you serve your
[2:03:22] husband you serve the Lord
[2:03:26] is that right you have something that
[2:03:29] God gave you
[2:03:31] to help your husband to help your man
[2:03:34] said you you know where he said it he
[2:03:37] said man could come home after a long
[2:03:39] day fighting
[2:03:41] you know Spirits or whatever he's tired
[2:03:43] and he comes home and
[2:03:45] says sets there or even one place says
[2:03:49] his wife greets him hugs and gives him a
[2:03:51] kiss
[2:03:52] sets him down sits on his lap begins to
[2:03:54] rub her fingers through his head hair
[2:03:58] is that it charges him something about
[2:04:01] the connection something that a woman a
[2:04:03] rule the woman has
[2:04:06] but the roles are being switched today
[2:04:09] women are ruling the house men are
[2:04:11] scared to death to stand up to them
[2:04:13] and to take a stand
[2:04:16] mainly because they just don't want
[2:04:17] trouble
[2:04:19] maybe he's afraid she'll leave
[2:04:25] if we find brother Brian set a
[2:04:27] dominating female is the greatest curse
[2:04:29] in the world
[2:04:31] and speaking of the church and speaking
[2:04:33] of the natural
[2:04:36] but we can find our place if we can find
[2:04:39] our role
[2:04:40] whether it be you deacons whether it be
[2:04:42] trustees whether it be whatever you're
[2:04:45] called to minister
[2:04:47] whether it be to the employee employer
[2:04:50] whatever see you you affect your family
[2:04:54] you affect your children you have that
[2:04:57] influence you affect your husband your
[2:04:59] wife
[2:05:02] Matthew 5 13 says you are the soul of
[2:05:05] the earth if the salt has lost its Savor
[2:05:07] wherewith shall it be salted it is
[2:05:10] then's forth good for nothing but to be
[2:05:13] cast out and to be trodden underfoot of
[2:05:14] men you are the light of the world a
[2:05:18] city that is set on a hill that cannot
[2:05:21] be hid
[2:05:22] so then we know what Jesus is doing
[2:05:24] don't you he's setting us forth as an
[2:05:27] influence
[2:05:29] you don't just stay in the world without
[2:05:32] influence
[2:05:34] your influence will be effective for
[2:05:36] good or for bad
[2:05:40] can you say Amen
[2:05:43] you love the Lord
[2:05:45] you may not be called to influence the
[2:05:48] whole world
[2:05:50] but strive to be that influence
[2:05:53] to the people that God gives you to
[2:05:55] influence
[2:05:57] and that number one is your family
[2:06:01] if the musicians will come
[2:06:07] you say well my my children growed up
[2:06:10] they're out of the house they're serving
[2:06:12] the devil they're
[2:06:16] but I'm going to tell you this stay in
[2:06:17] your place
[2:06:19] stay in your place that's the only way
[2:06:22] it's the only way you have power
[2:06:25] remember brother Brown said if you have
[2:06:27] faith you mothers if you have faith
[2:06:29] enough for yourself
[2:06:31] and have faith for that wayward
[2:06:34] child no matter how Wayward they are no
[2:06:38] matter how waver they are
[2:06:40] stay in your place
[2:06:42] stay in your place
[2:06:44] your children need you to stay in your
[2:06:47] place
[2:06:49] stay faithful to God
[2:06:51] stay faithful to the house of God
[2:06:53] stay faithful to his word stay faithful
[2:06:56] to the message
[2:06:57] clean out your homes
[2:07:01] then you say Amen
[2:07:03] I hope this has been okay
[2:07:06] all I know
[2:07:08] is Satan's doing everything he can to
[2:07:10] disrupt the program of God
[2:07:13] and his Target is on you you if I could
[2:07:15] say it this way we're the last man
[2:07:17] standing
[2:07:18] we're the last stage
[2:07:21] we're we're the last
[2:07:23] don't falter in it
[2:07:26] don't don't give up
[2:07:29] stay on the firing line
[2:07:33] stay with God
[2:07:36] and I and I and I I want to even say to
[2:07:40] you husbands
[2:07:42] fathers
[2:07:44] [Music]
[2:07:48] don't don't just leave your wife and and
[2:07:50] I'm just going to say it for myself okay
[2:07:52] [Music]
[2:07:54] don't just leave your wife at home all
[2:07:56] the time
[2:07:57] and you're out just running around doing
[2:07:59] all your thing and she's right there
[2:08:00] with the children
[2:08:02] all the time
[2:08:04] [Music]
[2:08:07] you got to understand something Satan
[2:08:09] fights that little lady
[2:08:13] fights her
[2:08:15] just as much
[2:08:17] in her mind
[2:08:21] you need to be there for that woman you
[2:08:23] need to be there for that child
[2:08:25] [Music]
[2:08:26] you need to have an influence in that
[2:08:27] home
[2:08:29] you can be a man of prayer a man that
[2:08:32] reads the Bible a man that listens these
[2:08:34] messages you need to be a man of
[2:08:36] conviction
[2:08:36] [Music]
[2:08:39] be a man that can bring your family
[2:08:41] together and protect them
[2:08:42] be involved in their lives
[2:08:45] [Music]
[2:08:50] she's not just one that cleans your
[2:08:52] house and watches your children while
[2:08:54] you get to go have fun
[2:08:58] and I'm saying that because that poor
[2:09:00] old woman
[2:09:01] [Music]
[2:09:04] I read you that quote Wednesday night
[2:09:07] that you sisters with long hair
[2:09:11] and wanted everybody else brother Brown
[2:09:13] said he said Satan's you're a target for
[2:09:16] the devil
[2:09:17] I I and can I say it
[2:09:20] really Brown tells us me and how to
[2:09:22] choose our wives
[2:09:25] he said if you want you know if you want
[2:09:27] just uh just the old whatever woman
[2:09:31] I can't even remember the name he called
[2:09:32] her but just I'll say it a No Good Woman
[2:09:36] it just runs around and in the bars and
[2:09:40] dressing sexy and all of that nonsense
[2:09:45] sad to say that tries to creep in this
[2:09:47] message any guy that wants that
[2:09:49] needs to get saved
[2:09:52] you get attracted by it these tight
[2:09:55] skirts tight blouses and all that
[2:09:57] something wrong
[2:09:58] [Music]
[2:10:02] brother Brown said you shouldn't want
[2:10:04] that
[2:10:05] you want a woman
[2:10:07] that'll build your house
[2:10:10] take care of your children
[2:10:13] be faithful to you
[2:10:15] what you establishing at home she's
[2:10:17] gonna carry out
[2:10:20] you ain't gonna want a woman
[2:10:24] now when you go off to work that woman
[2:10:26] says I don't matter what Dad says you
[2:10:28] can wear that makeup
[2:10:29] it doesn't matter what daddy says you
[2:10:31] can watch that movie you ain't gonna
[2:10:32] hurt he just don't know no better
[2:10:35] you ain't gonna want a woman like that
[2:10:39] so you choose a woman with character and
[2:10:43] a woman chooses a man with character
[2:10:45] [Music]
[2:10:48] it's all right for a man to work it's
[2:10:50] all right for a man to provide for his
[2:10:52] family but that's all he lives for
[2:10:54] something wrong
[2:10:56] he ain't got spiritual
[2:10:59] things in his life to drive his family
[2:11:01] to God I'd rather bless the Paul as
[2:11:04] brother Brown said rather live under a
[2:11:06] bridge and eat soda drink Branch water
[2:11:08] and soda crackers
[2:11:10] what is money if you ain't got God
[2:11:13] [Music]
[2:11:14] so you want a man that'll that'll
[2:11:16] that'll that'll lead you into God's ways
[2:11:21] but you Brethren if you've got a woman
[2:11:22] that'll be faithful to you and teach
[2:11:24] your children
[2:11:25] [Music]
[2:11:27] ought to respect her
[2:11:29] [Music]
[2:11:30] you ought to cherish her knowing that
[2:11:32] Satan's going to do everything he can to
[2:11:34] break her up
[2:11:37] she's the weaker vessel
[2:11:40] then you say man
[2:11:44] you ain't that's brethren we ain't got
[2:11:46] time to listen to the garbage don't put
[2:11:50] your family into it either
[2:11:54] don't bring things in your home that's
[2:11:56] going to discourage
[2:11:59] don't bring things
[2:12:01] for your children
[2:12:03] watch what voices they're listening to
[2:12:05] you've got a Ministry
[2:12:10] we've all got a Ministry you got to be
[2:12:12] faithful to it
[2:12:13] [Music]
[2:12:16] and you say Amen
[2:12:17] [Music]
[2:12:19] you know I guess it's the first time my
[2:12:21] mom's been here for mother's day but
[2:12:25] I say it often but I really appreciate
[2:12:27] my mom
[2:12:28] I'm not a Godly woman
[2:12:31] [Music]
[2:12:33] told her the other days the more I live
[2:12:35] the more I love her
[2:12:38] the more she shines to me
[2:12:47] she was a woman that she's a woman that
[2:12:49] wasn't raised in the era of phones
[2:12:51] foreign
[2:12:53] first thing they get up there on their
[2:12:55] phones constantly on their phones
