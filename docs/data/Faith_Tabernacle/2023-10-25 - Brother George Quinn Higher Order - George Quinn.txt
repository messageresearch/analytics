what he is tonight and I I thank God for that Hallelujah now someone has said significantly now listen to this if a message is very important you are likely to try and express your message through words and person so if you got a if you had a real message to give somebody and it was really important well you wouldn't TR trust any Tom Dicker Harley with it you know because you know they made BS the whole thing up on you but praise God when it's a real important message somebody important is going to come and bring it Hallelujah and and you know and and and in the in the the grand scheme of things Christ came and he brought the message Hallelujah and why he was there and and and and what we we see that God wanted to do Express himself in the person of Jesus Christ wonderful hallelujah amen the logos the logos I love to brother Sean I love to toy with like that there and one thing I know about the godhead you will never nobody in this whole earth could split Jesus from being Christ you can't say well he's Jesus but he's not Christ no you can't say he's Christ but he's not Jesus impossible just impossible amen and and I was looking at it and and you know it says in John 1 it says in the beginning was the word the logos of God hallelujah the very thought the very concept of God here and and then I said then the that that thought that concept became flesh and dwelt Among Us and you come cannot separate that from what Paul said in Philippians 2 where he said amen he was in the form of God Amen am moried Hallelujah H in the form of God and he thought it not robbery to be equal with God and he said he said if you don't believe that I am he you will die in your sins absolutely true Hallelujah and so thank God he he brought the message himself when when nothing else could do amen Jesus brought salvation to us he came as a human being hallelujah what a wonderful thing praise God it's bur to get you excited amen I love it I just love it amen and Hallelujah wonderful and and you know I remember brother Ed bisy was down at the camp meetings one time and I remember preaching for him and uh praise God it was wonderful time to be up there uh they were in the Old Log church first and then they went into their new place amen up there in Cloverdale but uh amen he said at at the camp me he said we have tapped into the mind of God well cuz that's where we were amen you know you talk about John Calvin and what he would have know and I'm sure he knew it a lot but I'll tell you what he could he knew predestination in the Bible but he couldn't have explained it the way we could tonight because the only way you can explain it is that we were in the mind of God Amen and that his mind is eternal so we had to be manifested at some point in our life and and you know not not as tell say tomor we just fellowship and and you know you think about about all the denominations tonight who would teach that when you were born you were a Son of God yeah you didn't become a Son of God sooner or later oh I accepted Jesus I'm a Son of God I you were a Son of God the only thing is you didn't know it you're a little sinner you would steal under the cookie jar and all that you tell the odd lie make the odd curse where word my mama said I was terrible you know yeah really you know oh boy Mark you know so I was I was no Insel you know but but oh my I tell you what but I didn't know even I can remember as a child that I'd be there you know we'd be maybe playing we we would call it soccer football soccer on the ground and we'd be playing as children playing and I'd feel something and I'd think what was that you know and then I I go back to playing again and brother Bram tells me he said that was the angels with you I was watching over you Hallelujah do you believe that H I believe there's an angel watching over this little guy here you know and the devil ain't getting our children is he we're not handing them over to him praise God you know praise God and all this this sick society that we live in amen where oh I I think in Donnie goers somebody thinks they're a cat some kid thinks they're a cat but you're not a cat hallelujah amen you're a human being I think you're a human being anyway okay so you know it's wonderful and we've tapped into the mind of God we know where we came from and and that and I I preached the message back home where where we talked about uh uh uh that proving that our names are in the Lamb's Book of Life and and when we go read fact that way it proves it Hallelujah we've done everything it says in Romans chapter 8 Hallelujah and now the sons of God led by the spirit of God we know who we are praise God so yes it's wonderful and we're not guessing well I hope my name's in the lamb B I know my name's in the lamb and my my wife left I know boy she's in that Dimension and that night she tried to haul me in she came that night and she wanted it's beautiful it's wonderful and you couldn't believe it and she's trying to but she couldn't do that she hadn't got the authority to to just whip me over over there you know and I suppose it wouldn't have been a bad thing if I had have whipped over there but there was still more I wouldn't be here tonight I'll tell you if you had have you know amen and praise God and that word you know Revelation 10 har Harry the send who would teach that amen it's Christ himself and he comes down and the Books open Hallelujah and the seals are are revealed and one thing I love folks I love that that scripture where where brother Bram he talked about what what what what Elijah would do you know we believe he's Elijah Hallelujah Elijah the prophet amen the seven danger to the seven Church AGS amen and and you know it's wonderful where he where he talked about turning your hearts back heart happen hallelujah amen and he said when you can receive them mystery Divine truths amen the seven Thunders that are revealed in the seven are the Seven Seals they're there they will be going to be revealed in the Seven Seals he said your heart has been literally turned back amen wow that's who I am Hallelujah read back amen and it's wonderful and folks do you know something tonight because he's here hallelujah you know when I in India I've seen miracles in India I've seen people I I prayed for a woman one time she was she was up on a little uh a veranda kind of thing and I and I said to the the lad I said who's who's that he said that's my mother and I said up there he said yeah he said she's been sent home to die I said really so I said you mind if we pray said I'd love you to and we went over to that little woman and you know it was 40° heat really hot and she was freezing cold her hands were ice cold and I thought oh there's death all over her she says when did she last eat three days ago she has at nothing she hasn't drank anything for three days and they sent her home out of the hospital just to die she said fix me and get me ready for the cemetery but I don't know but one of the brothers told me later he said when you lifted her hand her her body shook her body just give a shake like that and and I don't know what I prayed don't ask me did you take a brilliant prayer of get her raise her up Lord I probably said take her home Lord but you know something we goes to church there in about 2 and a half hours time later and here the the the the the the little evangelist fell he's up on the front giving testimony about that her her her daughter-in-law was walking by and she seen her move and she went over and the woman speaking and she says sumice some water and and he's given this testimony near he tears in his eyes and and I said well that's a good sign Hallelujah that's the God Jesus said give her something to eat you know so boy I'll tell you what and and she came around she really came around she lived for a couple of years after that and and so uh you know it was wonderful and when I met her when she was really up and walking but a year later hallelujah thank you but he's got God to God be the glory cuz I know I can't claim it I didn't do nothing just oh boy but she said to me one time when I met her and she said brother she said you called me back from the dead I said sister no I did not no I did not I said he called you back from the dead and he gave you more Life to Live amen for his own reasons Hallelujah he does that kind of thing amen so we're so thankful for for what has happened amen so the higher power who created all things and by him uh who preceded the beginning uh was not created that was created notice created uh Revelation brother Brown speaking he says Revelation 3:14 the correct translation is the beginner of the creation of God that's very important Hallelujah you just read that in with Colossians you know that he our Our Savior our our Our Redeemer amen he was the one that spoke the word and brought everything into existence Hallelujah that came into existence and so here he was a amen here amen and even then there was no no no God uh it wasn't God even then nobody to worship him at that point and the word god means object of worship we know that and so amen but when he created the angels and the spirits amen he created them they worshiped God and then he created man the greatest achievement amen praise the Lord so hallelujah amen I could say something there but I'll

everything that comes from his hand just take it Hallelujah you know I will say this we're not going too bad here but uh you know when I was down in North Carolina and of course I had come over with my jacket on from from Ireland and uh when I was leaving to go down to Georgia I just happened to leave my jacket and now you know we're getting all out and going down to get the hard car and all that and I left my jacket so well generally you just phone up and say left my jacket oh yeah we got it it's in the place and we give it to you they had no record of the jacket so that went on and brother Joe inquired again nothing about it at all so anyway um uh what happened was uh she told me she said I'm sorry so I said well there only two things could have happened either the the person that took the room leader it was still there and they took it or one of your staff might be uh honest I don't know but it's gone that's all I know and she said I'm very sorry about that so brother Joe of course brother Joe's the to me and with me always he's been to Ireland but he's my go-to man you know and so Joe comes down one night I jumped into the van or the the truck and uh he said I here's a try that it was too big for me but it was lovely and warm and I and he says you can have that I bought two amen I love when these guys buy more than one too cuz they're going to give one to somebody or whatever they do and so I got it but you know just would it have been what day is it Wednesday it would have been a Monday and I was coming back from somewhere and and uh the manager came ready out to where the car was and I looked at her and she says Mr Quinn Mr Quinn she says we found your jacket I said really and I said after tell me all that it was it was gone and she said yeah what happened was they put it under they've got a place where they keep all the people leave things behind they've got a place to keep all that and the jacket was down and other things were put in top of it so there was no word about it but somehow or other somebody must have moved something and they said there's a jacket and it was my jacket and I got it back and you know I'll tell you this here I and and think about it and I mean this with all my heart God likes to do nice things for his people a prophet said that and I'll tell you something he does like to do nice things for his people and if you just get up one morning and you're not feeling just the best just say Lord you like to do nice things for your people would you do something nice for me today and just watch what happens I mean it with all my heart God is a good god he's a faithful God hallelujah we love him amen so Hallelujah here we are amen and uh to bring that a little higher he said uh amen that God's got all the church now the called out the remnant under expectation of his coming there ain't going to be no Revival in America amen no Donald Trump ain't going to be saved the way we know Salvation amen I don't know about Biden but you know somebody said what was it they said today in the tree some little woman put up her notice about Biden well I'm not going to into that but she put it was she wasn't a fan she

devil knows that the devil knows that he cannot touch you folks hallelujah amen and he cannot touch America because you're here hallelujah he's the one that's holding all things together and will hold it until the bride is lifted up in the Rapture amen praise God and so we're moving that little higher we're looking for the coming of the Lord that's what we're looking for that's the Corporal coming you understand what I mean Hallelujah because the son of man's descended to this bride and revealed himself to it he did it up in the he reveals himself in the the heavens I was talking to Sean that lovely photograph that cloud photograph my I'll tell you what I'd never give that over to anybody that's a a Critic of this message that is the bride property Hallelujah that is the son of man there over Flagstaff or wherever it was amen how many miles high 26 or something Miles High whatever it was but I'll tell you what it was a it was a supernatural photograph amen and that's our property and there's this blessed face in it amen the son of man looking down praise God uh toward us hallelujah wonderful and wanting to bring us to that time when uh he'll come again and if he came one time in the fullness of time he'll come the second time he said I will come again and receive you now I preach the message and I'm sure maybe the folks could remember it or not it don't matter but it was scripture cannot be broken Jesus said that himself you cannot break the scripture so that means what he says he means and you can't ask to it take away from It or Break It am man it's unbreakable hallelujah praise God hallelujah and so scripture cannot be broken that's why they could not you know here's this Roman soldier really going to break his legs could you imagine that just a couple of seconds off breaking his legs but that Soldier didn't know that there's angels all around Hallelujah and he could not lay a finger on our savior Hallelujah because scripture said not a bone in his body would be broken scripture cannot be broken folks no matter how people try to uh uh you know they tried to draw Moses or what about whatever not but you cannot destroy what God's got done and planned hallelujah amen it's impossible so it brings us higher amen the church uh progressing higher amen since the days of Wesley I I I I got the pleasure of of going over to London one time and and I went into the church where Wesley was and we got shown all around it as a matter of fact even took his little hat that he wore and I had it was looking at it like that and she said oh don't touch that don't touch that that was his real heart that was that John wesle I had hand you know praise God and I remember one time meeting Sarah branam and and she had that that Bible of 1947 that that the angel of God quoted from when he was talking to brother Bram it's wonderful but you know it's wonderful things but it's not going to do make you any more higher or any more holy or any it's just you can see it it's just you say Amen amen and so we were at his place and it was it was wonderful uh to see it all and where he's buried I even asked him was he ounded and she said nope you know and I said was where was Charles buried and said oh Charles was very churchy he was buried up in the Anglican Church up the road you know consecrated ground well Paul wasn't buried and consecrated time but he said there's a Crown of Life witing me Hallelujah and and and he said to all who love the Lord's appearing oh isn't it wonderful Hallelujah the word of God cannot be broken folks it'll all be fulfilled every last lick of it amen hallelujah amen and so amen we're progressing higher much higher than Wesley because they were trinitarians and it had to be that way that was the darkness but that the Supreme deity what John saw amen that Supreme deity was going to be revealed in our day hallelujah amen and to take us where we're going and there he sat on the throne and worshiped Hallelujah on the throne and I've talked to many people and said if you can show me any more than one on the throne at any time in the Bible I'd love to hear the first in the chapter amen because it ain't there amen there's always one on the throne amen always one Hallelujah and so praise God and here he comes he says amen we moved up and through uh through restoration and the gifts and right up now we're coming to the Capstone the church has got to to be the come to the stature of a perfect man amen actually where where the head joins the body and you'll that in Ephesians uh amen 1 verse 22

there and amen uh he says uh the world cries out and he says for what purpose amen it's the spirit of God come from God for what purpose to prepare a people to give them a Heavenly atmosphere a desire to come higher that's our desire to tonight don't I hope there's nobody sitting here and saying well I'm satisfied you know I come to church I pay my TI and I'm satisfied where I am I don't don't want to be and rock the boat and all that you know my you want to get higher you want to and and you know folks the thing about it is amen since I first come to America amen and believe it or believe it

dead in Christ well the three Bibles and you know uh in the pyramid Mari did a great story in the pyramid and from the Queen's chamber right up and M seven ways right up to the and you come to a bigger Stone and when you get up on that stone where are you at a place called The Prophet's chamber oh yeah you know about that and and there's a a boss that's carved out of the Rock and it's there and you can touch it with your hand as you go in but and there's a whole series on that which I'm not going to go into tonight but do you know what you have to do next and think about this you got to go there's a 4ft chamber like that 4T High amen when I was in Vietnam I went into one of them tunnels that they talked about and I regretted that I come out shaking like a leaf because if you lifted

where Jesus was in the seventh and then he come back to his disciples on the shores of Galilee now when he met them there cooking on the fire for them he wasn't in the seventh Dimension he come back right back to the fourth cuz he ate the the the the honeycomb and as you know and all these things well I've always said to my people and we sing it you know when he takes me by the hand and leads me through that glory land hallelujah what a day glorious day I believe that with all my heart sister I believe one day you will have a a a personal interview with Jesus Christ and he'll take you by the

the on the his breast when he was in the the fourth four dimensions I tell you it's going to be wonderful everything that you could desire and you say well brother George you said attaining that seventh Dimension sure because it says amen amen amen what could be higher than this that in Revelation I think it's 21 verse one it says or one of them verses it says amen and he said I shall be their God and he says and the Overcomer will inherit all things amen now if I inherit all things what does that mean some things maybe a couple of things maybe more than a couple of things all things

I'd love to tell you uh well I will tell you do you mind just for a second that uh when I was over in Jerusalem and it was the Fe of Tabernacles and so they were it was almost like you'd see somebody

booths I don't think so just watch and so I said uh what is it and and he said well in this this here we've got four things one of them was a a sheath of wheat and there was another one uh uh from a tree I forget what what what it was but there was four things in it anyway and you could find out easy just type in suck into your Google and ask them about them four things they'll tell you well I

a when the curse is lifted and the millennium's on my goodness it's going to be the greatest thing you've ever tested in your life everything is before us and he said you were celebrating that God is going to touched the whole earth with his blessing and I said Woo I said that's the Millennium that's the Millennium those thought I going crazy Hallelujah that's it so they're they're they don't even know that they're just saying God's going to you read it in in the book of Isaiah what God's going to do Har he's going to share uh the swords and the plow shirs and all that and how he's going to bless the Earth that's what they're celebrating and I said well that's what we're celebrating too Hallelujah one day when we're keeping the Feast of Tabernacles we'll look around and say yeah the

Throne oh God is a Sor of right amen and and it's beautiful Hallelujah and and this uh with Kings and Priests he talks about the birthright the birth right is so important I preached in not very subject to the people the birth rate I I said if I give you a little sheet of paper just a we square and said I just a couple of words write down what's the most important thing and I'll tell you what brother Bram said it's that you have the birthright that we are the sons of God we are are led by the spirit of God and we have got the birthright amen that Jacob wanted Amen to be the the blessing of the Lord amen and we've got it and he says that the distinction which Israel failed to achieve by works of being a a priesthood of Believers is therefore a Birthright just as every descendant of Aaron was born to the priesthood the chief privilege of a priest now you're Kings and Priests what is the chief privilege that you've got tonight that you can come into the very presence of the shik the glory of God say but brother that's you can do it it's open the ways open right in there Hallelujah and you can stand in that presence and you can amen you can speak to God person to person and make your requests made known unto God why because you know and he will not refuse you he will not refuse your coming my because you're coming God's chosen way Hallelujah and so that's a privilege of prayer let us pray let us keep praying whatever it is you know brother Sean I could I say this just as I closing down for you it's been a joy to be here tonight but you know um I guarantee you there's people here tonight been praying for years and years and years about something and yet it just seems and sometimes when even sometimes you'd forget what you prayed for a way back but what if someday something happens and you hear a voice saying thy prayer is heard it's all changed and it only takes a moment just like that and there was zakaras in the temple and there Gabriel comes down and he heals him and all that and the man's troubled and wondering what's going on and he said thy prayer is heard and he an old man you know said what prayer would that be I love that that was a long time ago I forgot all about that you know and he said your prayer is here you're going to have a son oh well he said because you don't believe me you'll be DF and dumb until until it happens Hallelujah but it did happen and his name was John and even Zachariah wrote his name is John So You Know Thy prayer is heard the very first day you know in the Book of Daniel the very first day Daniel you prayed your prayer was heard but it was he he resisted me and he I had to call Michael until we broke through and here we are coming to you today so folks keep praying don't give up if you've got a a wayward loved one or anything to God something just keep praying and saying Lord it could be the day Hallelujah but I've carried this for years it could be the day Hallelujah when God say your prayer was heard what but Lord have prayed that 20 years ago your prayer is heard then and today is the day when it's going to be revealed hallelujah what a privilege of a amen Lord to be a priest of God hallelujah and you know amen uh you know uh what is it one of the things of a priest does he presents his body as a Living Sacrifice you are dedicated and consecrated to God hallelujah and that's all about it nothing else it's all periphery after that praise God it is trust in Jesus is all that really matters folks it really is and he's your focus he's your goal he's the one that you want to
