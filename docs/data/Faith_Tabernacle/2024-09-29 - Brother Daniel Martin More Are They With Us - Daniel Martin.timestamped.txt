[41:21] Christ has made that
[41:22] possible amen not that we're holy at all
[41:26] but the holy God is among us living in
[41:29] US dwelling in us making himself known
[41:33] we're so thankful for that amen and uh
[41:37] so uh just glad that we were able to
[41:40] come to the house of the Lord today and
[41:43] um you know I think we take things for
[41:45] granted take our opportunity our Liberty
[41:49] to be able to come for granted and our
[41:51] health and the fact that we're alive and
[41:55] um uh you know um glad um everyone here
[42:00] has um made it through the storm okay
[42:03] and I know different ones have lost
[42:06] their power and uh brother Tim sister
[42:10] Martha I thinks still without power
[42:13] brother will and his family uh he was
[42:16] telling me this morning that they ain't
[42:18] supposed to get theirs on till
[42:20] Friday and um so we just want to keep
[42:24] them in our prayer and uh the Lord will

[43:08] night just really tired and uh so we
[43:11] want to keep them in our prayer the Lord
[43:13] will just give them a rest and uh but um
[43:18] uh shubael is not wanting to eat and um
[43:23] so that means that uh if he loses weight
[43:27] they'll have to take him back and in the
[43:30] hospital um they uh sister Bethany was
[43:33] telling uh Heather this morning that
[43:35] they were at the hospital for 111 days

[43:52] way and uh good to have sister Jane back
[43:55] with us amen Mr Wednesday night and
[43:58] sister Lisa missed her and and um you
[44:03] know I uh we also want to keep brother
[44:05] Matthew in our prayer and uh he's having
[44:08] to go to boot camp and been there for
[44:10] many weeks and I don't know how many
[44:12] more weeks you got
[44:14] but 10 10 more weeks this is his third
[44:18] time going to boot camp apparently he
[44:20] didn't
[44:21] learn much from the other two so he had
[44:24] to go again no uh the
[44:27] every occupation that he takes requires
[44:30] him to go to boot camp and U I think he
[44:34] needs to get him a good occupation that
[44:36] doesn't require boot camp but uh uh
[44:39] anyway he's he's wanting to be a law
[44:42] officer and and so we want to just keep
[44:44] him in our prayer and uh we certainly
[44:47] love brother Matthew very much really
[44:50] enjoyed the the songs brother Matthew
[44:53] and sister Lisa both and um uh I tell
[44:57] you we need one another don't
[44:59] we need one another and sister uh Kim
[45:03] weeks had um sent this prayer request
[45:08] um um a little later so I wasn't able to
[45:12] get it to uh Branson but just said uh my
[45:16] heart is heavy for my hometown in North
[45:19] Carolina so much Devastation uh brother
[45:21] Joe brother Joe
[45:23] Green uh has heard from some of his
[45:26] church but not all there are whole towns
[45:29] destroyed around the area no power very
[45:31] little selfservice gas is ration to $20
[45:36] at a time so um asking for prayer and um
[45:42] I I tell you uh prayer God knows how to
[45:46] answer prayer don't he you know I told
[45:49] the story before but Dad you know we dad
[45:53] was a principal at our Christian School
[45:55] didn't get paid but very very little and
[45:59] so we were poor growing up and um but I
[46:03] remember he had that 3/4 ton truck and
[46:06] but he needed to go to Tulsa which was
[46:08] about 40 minutes away from where we
[46:10] lived and uh he had to go for a meeting
[46:14] school meeting and it was a requirement
[46:16] and and uh he didn't have the gas really
[46:21] to get there just a little bit and uh
[46:25] but he didn't want to borrow money so he
[46:27] he went ahead and went and he said he
[46:30] had um ran out of gases as he pulled in
[46:34] the truck died and he coasted in and he
[46:37] tried to start it and it wouldn't start
[46:39] and smelling the fumes you know and so
[46:42] he went on into the meeting and uh all
[46:45] through that you know meeting saying man
[46:47] I'm going to have to hit Chik home and
[46:49] don't want to do that but uh afterward
[46:52] he um he thought well I'm just going to
[46:55] go in that and see if I can get it start
[46:57] and so he prayed and he said Lord you
[47:00] know you know my needs you know why I'm
[47:03] here and he said I I know you're a
[47:05] provider said just asking that you'd
[47:07] help me get home let this truck start
[47:10] and he said you know he Crank that thing
[47:14] and he said it started he turned on the
[47:17] lights and he said right before him he
[47:20] said that that went Gage went from me
[47:22] all the way to fool God had given him a
[47:25] a tank of gas
[47:27] and you know that's just the god that we
[47:31] serve and um you know it's in these
[47:34] times you know when maybe we're
[47:36] struggling financially or or the limits
[47:40] like this of gas it's only 20 bucks uh
[47:44] uh at a time amen but God can go past
[47:47] that and he can just fill their tanks up
[47:51] he can just do whatever he wants to do
[47:52] he's God and we're in his hands we're
[47:56] believers do you believe that so may

[54:33] name we pray amen 2 Kings chapter
[54:38] 6 verse 8 uh we're going to read a few
[54:41] scriptures here says then the king of
[54:43] Syria warned against Israel and took
[54:46] counsel with his servants saying in such
[54:49] and such a place shall be my camp and
[54:52] the man of God sent unto the king of
[54:54] Israel saying beware that thou pass not
[54:58] such a place for thither the syrians are
[55:01] come down and the king of Israel sent to
[55:05] the place which the man of God told him
[55:07] and warned him of and saved himself
[55:10] there not once nor twice therefore the
[55:13] heart of the king of Syria was sore
[55:15] troubled for this thing and he called
[55:18] his servants and said unto them will ye
[55:21] not show me which of us is for the king
[55:24] of Israel and and one of his servants
[55:27] said none my Lord O King but Elisha the
[55:30] prophet that that uh the prophet that is
[55:32] in Israel tth the king of Israel the
[55:35] words that thou speakest in thy bed
[55:37] chamber and he said go and spy where he
[55:41] is that I may send and fetch him and it
[55:44] was told him saying behold he is in
[55:46] Dothan therefore s he thither the horses
[55:49] and chariots and a great host and they
[55:52] came by night and compassed the city
[55:55] about and when the servant of the man of
[55:58] God was risen early and gone forth
[56:01] behold
[56:02] Ando a host compassed the city both with
[56:06] horses and with chariots and his servant
[56:09] said unto him alas my master how shall
[56:13] we do and he answered fear not for they
[56:17] be with us more than they that be with
[56:19] them and Elisha prayed and said Lord I
[56:22] pray thee open his eyes that he may see
[56:26] and the Lord opened the eyes of the
[56:28] young man and when he saw and behold the
[56:31] mountains were full of horses and
[56:33] Chariots of Fire round about
[56:36] Elisha amen you can have your seats this
[56:40] morning am man that's uh probably one of
[56:43] my favorite scriptures in the Bible um
[56:47] but here we look at he says fear not for
[56:50] they that be with us are more than they
[56:53] that be with him and if I could give a
[56:56] Time this morning it's going to be very
[56:58] simple this morning but I'm hoping that
[57:00] it would just encourage you this morning
[57:03] and that would be more are they with us
[57:06] and um you we liveing in a a world of of
[57:09] great fear um this world is just um in
[57:13] so much fear not knowing what to do and
[57:16] and so many things are happening in the
[57:18] world today that's caused a great fear
[57:21] among the people in the world and uh you
[57:23] know we have all all the floods that are
[57:25] happening in and um uh that that just
[57:29] happened this week all the Hurricanes or
[57:31] tornadoes and and it's caused a great
[57:33] fear upon the people but to the bride of
[57:36] Christ it should cause us to lift our
[57:38] heads for uh our Redemption is drawing
[57:41] nigh and the word uh and the and the
[57:44] world is living in darkness this world
[57:46] is just covered with fear a and they're
[57:49] scared about tomorrow they're scared
[57:51] about about the the upcoming election
[57:53] worried about who's going to get in and
[57:55] and and and they're worried about their
[57:58] job don't know if they're going to uh uh
[58:00] how their jobs are going to work out and
[58:02] anymore people are scared to walk down
[58:04] the the the streets anymore people are
[58:07] scared to go to the grocery stores and
[58:10] and and that's what Satan is trying is
[58:13] put on the world today and if we could
[58:15] bring it into the church into our home
[58:18] Satan is trying to bring a fear into our
[58:20] church he's trying to bring fear into
[58:22] our homes and he's trying to get our
[58:25] minds off the the promises of God and to
[58:28] get us focused on our problems amen he's
[58:31] trying to get us focused on the
[58:33] circumstances amen where we get worried
[58:36] about the sickness in our bodies we're
[58:38] we're scared that our kids will never
[58:40] come back to God we're we're scared our
[58:42] church is going to fall apart or we're
[58:44] scared to believe for a Rapture because
[58:46] we don't know if it's for us a and
[58:48] scared to believe God cuz we uh cuz
[58:51] we're just what if it won't happen you
[58:53] know and that's what Satan is doing
[58:56] today he's causing a fear to get you to
[58:59] doubt God's word Amen brother brandom
[59:01] says the worst thing the devil can put
[59:04] on you is fear amen fear doesn't come
[59:07] from God H second Timothy 1 says for God
[59:11] hath not given us the spirit of fear but
[59:14] of power and of love and a sound mind so
[59:17] the spirit of fear does not come from
[59:19] God Amen and how do we get rid of fear 1
[59:23] John 4 says there is no fear in love
[59:26] for perfect fear casteth out love amen
[59:30] perfect our perfect love cast cast us
[59:33] out fear brother brandham says love and
[59:36] faith are the same thing love produces
[59:40] faith and there are only two uh uh uh uh
[59:44] uh things that govern a human and one of
[59:47] them is Faith which brings results and
[59:50] the other is fear which has no value in
[59:53] it at all amen Faith cometh by hearing
[59:56] and hearing the word of God Amen we we
[59:59] know that saying you are what you
[1:00:01] eat and you know you can eat all the
[1:00:04] fatty stuff and and next thing you know
[1:00:06] you you you get Chunky and you can eat
[1:00:08] all the salads and the next thing you
[1:00:10] know you become skinny you are what you
[1:00:12] eat and we can feed off the things of
[1:00:14] the world we can uh our Pastor said it
[1:00:17] uh Wednesday night he made a comment we
[1:00:19] are like a sponge you know we can we we
[1:00:22] can either soak up the things of the
[1:00:23] world or we can soak up the things of
[1:00:25] God
[1:00:26] and we can get fat off the world or we
[1:00:28] can get fat off the promises of God
[1:00:31] Amen and we can soak ourselves in the
[1:00:34] politics we can soak up the
[1:00:36] entertainment we can uh soak up uh all
[1:00:40] these other things and if we're not
[1:00:41] careful we'll open the the doors to fear
[1:00:45] and if we can just forget about the
[1:00:47] politics if we can just forget about uh
[1:00:50] numbing our minds to the entertainment
[1:00:53] and soak up the things of God then we
[1:00:55] can have a faith in the word that will
[1:00:58] bring the power of God in our midst this
[1:01:00] morning amen Faith cometh by hearing and
[1:01:03] hearing the word of God
[1:01:06] Amen you don't get Faith by soaking up
[1:01:09] your your favorite audio book amen you
[1:01:12] don't get Faith by watching your
[1:01:13] favorite TV show you don't uh soak up
[1:01:17] Faith by uh listening to a man's ideas
[1:01:21] and and listening to his own Revelations
[1:01:24] but uh but you get Faith by the word of
[1:01:27] God for this hour amen but in the word
[1:01:31] of God for this day and age amen each
[1:01:34] messenger had a word for their day and
[1:01:38] an hour amen Noah had a message for his
[1:01:41] day and that was it's going to rain amen
[1:01:45] for I believe 120 years Moses got up
[1:01:48] every single more or Noah got up every
[1:01:50] single morning and said it's going to
[1:01:51] rain and and the people had to obey the
[1:01:54] voice for that day or they perished amen
[1:01:58] for by faith Noah built an ark amen his
[1:02:01] faith rested upon God's Eternal Word
[1:02:04] Amen brother Bram says no matter how
[1:02:06] much the people said it can't be done no
[1:02:08] matter how much science combed the globe
[1:02:10] and said there will never be clouds up
[1:02:12] there there's no rain to come down if
[1:02:15] God's word said it's going to rain it's
[1:02:17] up to God to make a way for the rain if
[1:02:20] if God said so then that settles it amen
[1:02:23] and that's the way our faith should be
[1:02:25] if God said so then that settles it it
[1:02:28] doesn't matter what the world says if
[1:02:30] God said it then God has to make a way
[1:02:33] for it amen Wesley had a message for his
[1:02:37] day amen Luther had a message for his
[1:02:39] day and if we feed off a me Luther's
[1:02:42] message that ain't going to work if we
[1:02:43] feed off of Wesley's message it's not
[1:02:45] going to work and on down to the final
[1:02:47] age each message had had its own uh for
[1:02:51] its own age and a and there's a message
[1:02:53] for a bride in this hour amen if we can
[1:02:57] feed off the message of this day this
[1:02:59] message has come to get us ready for a
[1:03:01] Rapture this message has come to to let
[1:03:04] us claim our promises amen it may look
[1:03:07] strange to the world it may it may seem
[1:03:10] odd and and they can come up with every
[1:03:12] reason why we shouldn't believe this
[1:03:13] message a why we shouldn't make this
[1:03:16] message our absolute but this message is
[1:03:18] not to the unbeliever this message is to
[1:03:21] the elected of God oh my God is elected
[1:03:24] of people and has put Faith uh put their
[1:03:27] faith in the word of God and and she has
[1:03:30] made herself ready amen come what may
[1:03:33] let the Trials come let the
[1:03:35] disappointments come let the sickness
[1:03:38] come all hell has been loose to get you
[1:03:40] to doubt but put your faith in the word
[1:03:43] of God Amen it's come to put your faith
[1:03:46] to the test this world is growing darker
[1:03:50] fear is everywhere but as long as you're
[1:03:52] feeding off the word of God for this
[1:03:54] hour not not past age not not not a not
[1:03:57] a past uh Revival but if you're feeding
[1:04:00] off for the Revival for this bride amen
[1:04:03] then you have nothing to fear amen some
[1:04:07] people has put their faith in in the
[1:04:09] pope oh my some people has put their

[1:08:03] morning amen I don't want to get ahead
[1:08:06] of myself but if we go back to our
[1:08:08] opening scripture we find out that there
[1:08:10] is a war between Syria and Israel and
[1:08:14] every time the enemy would try to lay a
[1:08:16] trap every time the enemy would try and
[1:08:19] sneak up on the armies of God on the
[1:08:22] armies of Israel God would reveal it to
[1:08:25] his prophet Propet Elijah oh my the word
[1:08:27] of the Lord comes to a prophet always
[1:08:30] amen I want you to catch this now the
[1:08:32] enemy was always exposed uh he was
[1:08:35] always exposed anytime he tried to get
[1:08:37] to God's people and the Bible says that
[1:08:40] the king of Syria was very troubled
[1:08:42] about this and sought after Elijah and
[1:08:45] Dothan so so in the cover of Darkness we
[1:08:48] see that he sent a great host a great
[1:08:51] host not just a few little men and and
[1:08:54] just a just a couple people but he sent
[1:08:57] a great host and he surrounded the city
[1:09:00] there was no way out he surrounded the
[1:09:03] city and it's the same thing today Satan
[1:09:05] has released all the host of Hell to get
[1:09:09] you to doubt to cause you to fear amen
[1:09:12] and this great Army it sent its horses
[1:09:15] and its chariots and it surrounded the
[1:09:17] city and the Bible says that Elijah's
[1:09:20] servant went out the next day and he
[1:09:22] seen all the armies of Syria and he C
[1:09:25] cried out to Elijah he said Master fear
[1:09:28] took over over his servant and he said
[1:09:30] Elijah uh Master what shall we do what
[1:09:33] shall we do now Elijah didn't fear he
[1:09:37] didn't say oh well I should have just
[1:09:38] kept my mouth shut oh God why why me
[1:09:42] Lord I shouldn't have told H them about
[1:09:45] that I shouldn't told the the Israel
[1:09:48] what what the Syrian Army was doing but
[1:09:50] he looked at his servant and he said
[1:09:53] fear not oh my that's a powerful
[1:09:56] statement this morning fear not oh Amen
[1:10:00] to the carnal eye it looked impossible
[1:10:03] to that servant it looked impossible and
[1:10:05] when he said fear not maybe his servant
[1:10:08] probably looked at Elijah and he said
[1:10:09] well Elijah I I I just don't know maybe
[1:10:12] you slept a little too long this morning
[1:10:14] I I don't know I mean do I only see the
[1:10:17] two of us and and I just don't know you
[1:10:20] know do you not see that Grace that that
[1:10:23] Army surrounded the city there's there's
[1:10:25] no way out for us Elijah but all Elijah
[1:10:28] said was fear not for more are they with
[1:10:30] us or are more are they with us than
[1:10:33] they that be with him oh what a
[1:10:35] revelation oh my and his servant says
[1:10:39] well you know I only see the two of us
[1:10:41] and Elijah said Lord I pray thee Open
[1:10:45] the Eyes of the young man that he may
[1:10:47] see and then God opened his spiritual
[1:10:50] eyes and behold the mountain was full of
[1:10:53] horses and Chariots of Fire
[1:10:55] round about them and a great host of
[1:10:59] angels surrounded Elijah and his servant
[1:11:02] amen they looked impossible amen but he
[1:11:05] said fear not
[1:11:08] amen there was Angels Angels compassed
[1:11:12] about them and if we can apply that to
[1:11:15] our day if we can apply that Satan has
[1:11:18] Unleashed every de every demon of
[1:11:21] Torment every demon of fear has come
[1:11:24] after you to cause you to fear

[1:25:38] could just Place their faith in God God
[1:25:41] would make a way and the mother uh she
[1:25:45] put her trust in God and he she made a

[1:25:57] wouldn't touch her baby that that's the
[1:25:59] faith she had she trusted God to watch
[1:26:02] over him and brother Bram says that God
[1:26:05] called 10,000 angels to come along the
[1:26:09] Nile and watch over that baby Moses to
[1:26:12] make sure no harm would come to him and
[1:26:14] he said that as the little Ark was going
[1:26:16] down the river river Gabriel Ro great
[1:26:20] Gabriel the Angel rode on top of the
[1:26:23] basket and anytime a crocodile would
[1:26:26] come up to the ark he would drive them

[1:44:30] softly amen did you enjoy the service
[1:44:33] this morning
[1:44:34] amen amen
[1:44:40] hallelujah brother brandham not only
[1:44:42] taught us the
[1:44:43] message but he taught us how to worship
[1:44:46] after the service after when the
[1:44:49] preaching is going on and there's a
[1:44:52] liberty there
[1:44:54] you never want to get in a
[1:44:56] hurry but you want to enter in and
[1:45:00] worship because brother brand said you
[1:45:03] know that the spirit the angel of the
[1:45:04] Lord you know follows after the
[1:45:07] message and he begins to speak to the
[1:45:10] hearts
[1:45:11] and and that showed even in the
[1:45:14] beginning when the word of the Lord was
[1:45:15] spoken then the spirit of the Lord moved
[1:45:18] after that and he began to bring that
[1:45:21] word to materialization
[1:45:24] and it's always been that way and I
[1:45:27] believe the Lord has spoke to us this
[1:45:30] morning and to let us know you don't
[1:45:33] have to fear you might say well I I I've
[1:45:35] already heard these things and and that
[1:45:37] may be
[1:45:39] true but Satan is constantly working on
[1:45:42] us constantly
[1:45:45] fighting and and I think that God gives
[1:45:49] us raises up ministry we you know we
[1:45:53] heard it Wednesday night we hear it
[1:45:57] today of just the promises of where
[1:46:00] we're
[1:46:01] at now you
[1:46:04] know we're in the greatest age
[1:46:07] ever and if there's ever a time that God
[1:46:10] has truly made himself known in his
[1:46:12] church it's now in our flesh in his old
[1:46:16] bodies and yet Satan is Waring us he's
[1:46:19] fighting us he's trying to convince us
[1:46:22] that that we ain't part of it and he's
[1:46:25] trying to convince us that there's no
[1:46:27] way and trying to get us to look at the
[1:46:30] natural trying to get us to look at our
