in his presence you're glad for his presence amen and to know that he is here Among Us with us alive and well and amen and we certainly love the Lord and trust you had a good day today and um just a wonderful uh day and must have rained at her house I don't know but something happened anyways the wind must have picked up tree was blowed over in our drive and so we spent a little time getting that today and uh but uh we're here praise the Lord and the musicians can be dismissed and uh if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the Book of Matthew um the 11th chapter to have brother Enoch with us this evening amen and just everyone and good to have sister Brenda back playing the organ praise the lord we must have got the problem fixed I I reckon did we so uh appreciate brother Kevin working on that and um praise the Lord technology is fine but it sure keeps you guessing half the time and so anyways before we go into the word let's just bow our heads and talk to the Lord precious father we come to you this evening thankful for your presence Lord that we can come and Lord just have Fellowship around your word and sing songs of Zion Lord and be able to lift up holy hands without wrath and doubt father thank you for what you've done for us we're just asking that you would be with us this evening continue the work that you started within us Lord I pray that you would anoint both speaker and hearer is our prayer in Jesus Christ's name amen uh 11 and we're going to start the 28th verse this is Jesus words here but he said come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light amen you can have your seeds last evening I was just thinking on the was hearing brother Branham and he had mentioned something in his prayer I believe it was but and uh and the word that caught me was resting resting in thus saith the Lord and so I'm going to use that as a title and there's a lot that we could say about it and but I I won't keep long I I was studying uh you know trying to really hurry up to get uh didn't didn't anyways uh so then the tree so we kind of worked on the tree and then I forgot about time and my wife says we're in the van so uh then my computer wouldn't work so anyways but so we're gonna we're just gonna talk about it for a few moments but now Jesus says come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden now I know that he he speaking for everyone out of all ages in in this uh I'm I'm sure but I think if there's ever a time that we could take this um take what he is saying in the invitation I believe it is now more than any other age there's another scripture that comes to mind and that is um where I believe it's found in Isaiah where God said look unto me all ye ends of the Earth and be saved and um and of course brother Branham applies that to this age that here we are we're at the ends of the Earth we're at the ends of everything End of Time democracy Nation Nations uh civilization as we know it to be everything is at its ends and not just the end but ends of the earth and uh and it would be at this time brother Brahm applied that to this time how we're at the ends but then the command is look unto me and so I look at that and I look at this scripture Jesus saying come unto me so it would be applicable for our age look in other words I'm here know where I'm at but your focus on me right and coming to me because we're going to need him you got to look unto him and be saved come unto me and find rest for your your your soul and Jesus said in another place I am the way the truth and the life and so look unto me when you're looking unto him you're looking at the way the truth and the life when you come and unto him you're coming unto the way you found the way when you come to him you found the way the truth and the life ain't that right and so well then we know that he is the word brother Brahm tells us that so many times and you ain't gonna find that in in in denominations or anything else but brother the prophet would tell us and identify him as being the word and he would take us through the scripture in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God then the 14th verse John 1 14 and the word made was made flesh the word became flesh ain't that right so look look unto me come unto me all ye that are heavy laden don't come to a thought don't come to an idea don't come to a teaching but come unto me ain't that right now it's applicable for this age because uh this is the finale of everything it's and so so uh we're living in an age of unrest there's probably been unrest in every age no doubt but this is the greatest stage of unrest this is the age that no one has answers to they're they're trying to and and it's more than just a physical uh unrest it's a spiritual unrest the soul is weary and and uh you probably that work on jobs and you talk to people that are Christians even and and uh and yet they're they're the world is trying to find answers they're they're they're they're they're looking for answers to their questions and yet the Bible says ever learning this would be the age that people would be ever learning and never come to the knowledge of Truth now Jesus says I'm the way the truth and the life you got to come to me to find rest ain't that right but they're not able to come to the knowledge of Truth you've got people searching in all kinds of religions trying to find rest trying to find the answers trying to find the truth they they read we've got more literature out there than than ever before of of ideas and these things but you see if a man can find truth he can find Christ if he can see the truth then he can fulfill what the scripture says look unto me all ye uh ends of the Earth ain't that right for Christ is the truth now we don't accept anything to be truth that people can say it's truth but we don't accept anything as truth truth has to be Vindicated before it's accepted it has to be proven to be truth ain't that right now brother Graham talking of this uh Abel not able to come to the knowledge of Truth he says they aren't able to come to the knowledge of knowing Jesus Christ exists today in the power of his resurrection in in the Holy Ghost ain't that rhyme see so so they're not able to come to that knowledge that Jesus Christ exists in the power of his resurrection But but so much confusion today um and you know uh this this Babylon we we talk of Babylon the Bible talks of Babylon but it means confusion it's it's it's a it's just confusion and that's what we're looking at is is so much confusion which causes unrest confusion yeah because you don't have an absolute you don't find you don't have the answers to to the questions that you have and and and people's peoples wanting to know about their future people are wanting to know uh about the things that are going on and and nobody has the answers and we've got so much false teaching in the churches so much lies in the in politics and uh false doctrines Creeds and dogmas and and the media they're they're putting their spin on things and nobody knows what to believe if you you can't believe Fox News you can't believe CNN you you can't you can't believe you know and you have to say you can't believe Newsmax and and uh uh you can't believe Donald Trump and and you can't believe in Biden and you can't believe you just can't believe them you know you can't believe the government you know and then then it's gotten into the church that you can't you can't believe what's going on in the church it's what the denominations are preaching and and and their programs and there's things and and people are in a tell spin today of trying to find the truth but yeah can you imagine just being in a state like that where you don't know what truth is you go to church and you don't know if it's really the truth or not so people are left to their own opinions their own ideologies and how many people are going into that and yet you can't believe that either you know it's just it's a constant thing no one knows what to believe today and and and it's because of the babylon's Babylonian system you know John uh talked about it there in Revelations about mystery Babylon mystery and and again Babylon is confusion and and and he talks about that that the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her the Great Men the powerful men have have committed uh a fornication and all the people of the Earth have drunk of the wine of her fornication and and so uh uh well again Babylon is confusion but it's a mystery uh because Babylon you know you read it of it in the Old Testament and and and and uh uh there there was a place called Babylon uh Nimrod and and such and and so we all know about that and the history of of them things but this is a mystery babbling it's it's not per se a a s uh country or whatever but John saw her as a church it's it's it's a it's it's a it's in and it's and it's it's a place that is spewing out confusion and the people of the Earth are drinking of it and and they've drunk of the wine of her fornication they've committed fornication with her and and fornication is is an act of adultery it's it's a person that claims to uh uh well you know I I don't have a Verbatim but uh a person to be in love claiming to uh uh to to to be married to this to to an individual and then they're going out and committing uh adultery and and all of these things well this woman claiming to be a church claiming to be of Christ and yet she's she's totally against Christ and her teachings are against the word or her her ideologies her traditions and all of that is is against it's against the word of God and it started out in in the first church age ain't that right and she's been spewing out her doctrines in the confusion through all the ages to where in this age we're left with a generation that does not know what to believe and it's a mess ain't that right and and and so uh and and so they're led to their own advice as they they're left without the answers and and it reminds me of Daniel and and if you would like to just turn with me Daniel 5 and 1. uh and like I say we won't keep you long but um if I can find it myself will be in good shape praise the Lord Daniel found it Daniel 5 and 1. um it's going to be a little lengthy but um we'll read it anyways belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his Lords and drink wine before the Thousand belshazzar while he tasted the wine commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which is Father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem so now he's using the things consecrated to God unto for his Gods ain't that the way it is today that's why brother Brandon was against these singers that would sing gospel music and then go out and sing country music and all that it's it's perverse it's of the devil and this is what this vile Heathen King done he took the things that were made to be for God and then he would use it for his gods and and all of that see well and it made God upset right and and so see and that the king and his princes his wives his concubines might drink there in them they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the Temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem and the King and his princes his wives and his concubines Drank in them see things that were consecrated unto God supposed to be consecrated to God now he's using them for the world ain't that right now just to say this you either got to be consecrated to God and nothing else but to try to be used for God and use of the world is is wrong it ain't going to work ain't that right and and and that that's why you know women ain't to wear their pants women ain't to wear and cut their hair and wear their makeup that's Heathen that's of the devil well now we've got it to where women claiming to be God and singing of God and they're wearing pants it's it's almost the same thing the vessels that are supposed to be consecrated to God Satan's controlling them as well Satan's using them for his glory it's sad when when when women are supposed to be a Holy Ghost Field claiming and they're sex Queens for the devil leading many to hell and that's even in the apostolic Rim where they're wearing their tight clothes and and all of that and they're Leading Men to hell they're used of the devil ain't that right so so there's so many things that we could take today uh uh that was likened unto this day uh that that's going on but he's using the things that uh that God had required for himself and and now that Heathen King is using it for his so then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the Temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem and the king and the princes his wives and his concubines Drank in them they drank wine and praised the gods of gold and of silver of brass of iron of wood and of stone ain't that right it's kind of like I've said you know now I I you know uh I I know that that you know when we come into the message we found out that there's some instruments that the message folks didn't believe in and and and and I thought well why is that you know I mean it's just it's just a piano it's just a drum set it's just the organ it's just what did it do wrong you know oh uh uh but but it it's the it's it's not the music that's the problem it's the people that's the problem right I have nothing against the piano I mean he's got anything against the piano you got anything from his piano well what if we had Jerry Lee Lewis come in and play that piano now who what's what's wrong with it is it the piano that backslid or is it the guy all right see so so there's instruments that are to be used of God that the devil has perverted ain't that right it's the devil that does them things it's true you can you can you can a guitar playing a guitar playing music can drive Spirits away and them same guitars and the same music can entertain spirits and bring spirits and excite spirits and call spirits to do things ain't that right it all depends who's playing it so so they drank wine and praised the gods you using the vessels of the temple and drinking wine out of it and yet praising gods of gold and the silver and Brass of iron of wood and a stone in the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand wrote over against the Candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king's Palace and the King saw the part of the hand that wrote then the king's countenance was changed and his thoughts troubled him so that the jaunts of his Lawns were loose and his knees smote one against another the king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers in the Chaldeans and uh the soothsayers and the King spake and said to the wise men of Babylon who shall so ever shall read this writing show me uh the interpretation thereof shall be clothed with scarlet and have a chain about of gold about his neck and shall be the third ruler in the Kingdom so much for that then came in all the king's wise men but they could not read the writing nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof then was King belshazzar greatly troubled and his countenance was changed in him his Lords were and his Lords were astonied now the Queen by reason of the words of the king and his Lords came into the banquet house and the queen spake and said O King live forever let not thy Hearts thoughts uh trouble thee nor let thy countenance be changed there is a man in thy kingdom in whom is the spirit of the Holy gods and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom like the wisdom of the Gods was found in him whom the King Nebuchadnezzar thy father the king I say thy father made Master of the musicians astrologers Chaldeans and soothsayers for so much as an excellent spirit and knowledge understanding interpreting of dreams and showing of hard sentences and dissolving of doubts were found in the same Daniel whom the king name built shazar now let Daniel be called and he will show Thee the interpretation ain't that right then was Daniel brought in before the king and the King spake and said unto Daniel art thou that Daniel which art of the children of the Captivity of Judah whom the king my father brought out of jury I have heard of thee and the spirit of the Gods is in thee and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee now the wise men and in the astrologers have been brought in before me that they should read this writing and make known unto me the interpretation thereof but they could not show the interpretation of the thing and I have heard of thee that thou canst make interpretations and dissolved doubts now if thou can is read the writing and make known to me the interpretation thereof Thou shalt be clothed with scarlet and have a chain of gold about thy neck and thou shalt be the third ruler in the Kingdom now that that's a that that was a problem but they could not understand the writing they couldn't understand the interpretation now we're living in that same day we got trouble in the land and God's Wrath is being poured out God's upset I mean Church uh I don't know but uh I don't want to be here when God's Wrath is poured out but the sins of man have reached God we've talked about how that brother Bram talks about these UFOs and all that being investing aiding angels to look on the sin that has been committed in this in this time ain't that right and so we we look but Daniel was a prophet that could give a true interpretation of of what was happening ain't that right now I've thought of that a man that could dissolve all doubts right in the middle of of babylon's system and he could read and dissolve the doubts and read the true interpretation of what was happening now I've I've looked and in this day we've we've had a voice crying out we've heard it uh uh come out of her my people ain't that right come out of her if if there's ever a Time church for the people of God to come out of the confusion it's this age God has provided a way to where our hearts not be troubled our thoughts not be troubled everything that is going on in the Nations and the world it not trouble us ain't that right come out of her my people and it's at this time that this voice Cries Out is the time that God sins unto us the prophet of Malachi 4. why because the word comes to the prophet ain't that right and the prophet as the prophet said the prophet has the true correct interpretation [Music] of the word of God ain't that right now we've read about it we've seen it uh talked about it uh of the Bible speaks there in Revelations 10 and and seven of of about the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mysteries of God should be finished now you think of that the Mysteries all this confusion should be over for who those that have come out of Babylon ain't that right there is peace for the soul of man there is rest for the soul of man ain't that rhyme so the prophet is the one that has the truth people say well you've got to get get them to Christ before the message you you're missing the point Christ is the message Christ is the way the truth and the life Christ is the word ain't that right and the word comes to the prophets ain't that right the message is Christ it's a living being if you can believe it but you got to believe it ain't that right you got to believe it now we're blessed in in the fact that that God has sent us a message and if I can just encourage you once again is don't let nothing stand between you and the message of the hour don't don't let what is going on stand between you and the message don't let people's ideology stand between you and the message ain't that right people you know the the the the they knock this message and he's still claiming to be in the message but they got their ideas of what's truth and what's not and they want to pick this message apart well this is Brother branham's opinion and this is what he's saying here and and it don't mean much and it doesn't mean this it means everything to us you can never come out of Babylon if you don't come out of confusion you've got to come out of confusion and and if you don't come out of confusion you'll never find rest until your soul ain't that right Christ has revealed himself by way of the prophet ain't that right Christ is the one that has the answers and I'll be honest with you it's the holy ghost that has is the prophet of the age do you believe that the Holy Ghost is the prophet of the age so when you're knocking down uh the message of the hour you're criticizing the Holy Ghost and it's true now listen the handwritings on the wall that God had given us a prophet to let us know what's going on he let us know why these events are taking place and it's not to bring confusion it's for you to find rest it's for me to find rest as a preacher to my soul that when I come and I stand before you I can preach the truth to you and when you preach the message to your children you're teaching them the truth of it ain't that right you find rest amen and all those that have come out of Babylon by way of this message that's found rest to their soul and if you ain't found rest it ain't the message fault it ain't God's fault it's because we're not taking the message for what it says can you say Amen yes sir we got them all look at the confusion that's going on I mean Jesus thought the Jesus said when you see these things begin to happen lift your head up lift your head up your Redemption draweth nigh and we got these false soothsayers and astrologers and well what whatever you want to call it false prophets today and and all of that and and and they're they're saying Revival to America restoration of America is coming it's not coming will happen you can't identify yourself as an American I just be honest I love this nation I'm glad I'm an American but I can't afford to identify myself as an American there ain't no hope for us as an American but there is hope in Christ there is hope in Christ find rest for your weary Souls then you say Amen think of that people looking and searching all over and we've been delivered from the ideology of men things that have held men back and still hold men back doctrines and teachings traditions and dogmas and all that you realize how powerful them things are because it's a power of Darkness ain't that right it holds you back to where you can't just find true Liberty as a son and daughter of God you don't look to the world for answers don't look for the world for answers can you say amen and I'm not trying to be critical or mean but I am telling you there is the answers come unto me that's what Jesus said come unto me and he's not a theory he's not a Doctrine he's not an idea he's not a just a myth it's a living being Jesus Christ the person of Jesus Christ is here today do you believe that and God is in his word vindicating his word with Supernatural signs and this message has been certainly Vindicated that it should take all questions and I say to you it is our absolute it is our absolute why it's the true true uh interpretation and now we have the answers to the devil's questions we have the answers and our soul is at rest our soul is at rest the answers to marriage it's the answers to home life is the answers to the church it's the answers to our ministers the answers for children for parents it's the answers for musicians it's the answers for employers and employees it's it's the answers every answer that you need or question that you have the answers in the message and you know what the message is it points us right back to the word it makes this word live it this Bible become a new book to all of us or it should can you say Amen because we've read this Bible we've understood that the Bible through theories of men the ideas and doctrines and and ideologies of men and and we thought we had the answers but it verified we didn't have the answer because we couldn't find rest in our souls but when we found the answer a prophet would take us to True interpretations of the word can you say man and the prophet is not a he wasn't a commentary to to take scripture by scripture scripture by scripture that wasn't it but he had the spirit of Truth and you say man and he would take it and he would he would expound on it and then we would have the spirit of Truth to allow us to read between the lines of what is really being said can you say Amen so so we we can't make this this this this this message a a uh like a a seminary to where we just tried to break it down in in so many ways it takes the spirit of God in the individual to open it up to us and you say Amen because not everybody in the message not everybody that says God sent a prophet is going to have rest for the soul ain't that right but the voice the spirit of the Prophet is in the bride the spirit of the Prophet is in the bride and it's revealing to her and you say Amen you think of it this this these messages are an eternal message how many times have we listened to you know Christ is the mystery of God revealed you can't just listen to it one time and get it all out I mean it's an eternal word the the the the godhead misunderstood or God being misunderstood and and and all of these these messages you can go back and listen and listen over and over and over and the spirit of God within you is breaking it down to you why you're finding rest for your soul because God's word can never fail you believe that Jesus said heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away but the word's been hid because of the the the interpretations of man the ideas of man and and and no wonder people don't get results the way they need it and the way they should but a prophet got results then you say man why because he had the true interpretation of the word and so is this message or this bride getting true results because they've got the true interpretation our soul has found rest amen you love the Lord any wonderful I I just can't thank God enough for sending the message our way and I I I say to you you know with the the best I I know to say it to you is stay with the word stay with the message get into it I you know I've I've said it so many times and I say it again you know if there's anyone you need to be listening to it's the message people's getting so wrapped up in this internet and and social media listen to this preacher listen to that preacher listen to this preacher listen to this preacher no wonder they're empty in their soul trying to find something to satisfy it's in the message find it in the message can you say Amen get into the message play them tapes at home the handwritings on the wall but there's someone that can tell you what it is about politics are going crazy but there's someone that can tell you what it's about all these inventions and everything that's going on and the chaos and the craziness there's somebody that has the answer can you say man there's no point in running to and fro anymore people the Bible says people will run to and fro amen trying to find the knowledge trying to find true truth is falling in the streets but there's a bride that's holding on that truth she's possessed the truth she's holding on to it she ain't gonna let it go then you say Amen stay with the message amen I love the Lord do you love him if the musicians will come I find you you just believe the message you stay with that message you listen to the message the more in love you become with Christ the more established you become in Christ the more solid the it that Christ becomes to you and you become with Christ it's it's it's something that because it's it's so true you will find rest for your soul you say well the Holy Ghost is red and I agree with that I I certainly agree to that and we're not doing away with that at all but here's the thing you believe this message with all of your heart and you stay with that message if you need the Holy Ghost you'll get the Holy Ghost hello you why because the Holy Ghost backs this message up it backs it up whatever you have need of you stay with the message stay straight stay true listen to it fill your heart and your mind fill your mouth with it confess it why because it's nothing but promises to you it's the promises of God ain't that right it's something that will not fail brother Brown even said he'll go to his judgment I mean you'll go to judgment with it with what he's preached he's going to be judged with what he's preached and what did everybody else say up there beyond the curtain of time we're resting on that he said I preached what Paul preached and they're saying we're resting on that they're they're there in heaven they're there where they're at resting on a water Prophet preached then you say man and apparently God's honored what that Prophet preached because they're they're there they've made it on the other side and they're resting on the words of that Prophet now can we not rest upon them same words of what a prophet preached they're arresting it up on there we're resting it up on it down here and we're resting not Upon A man we're resting upon the thus saith the Lord that has been totally Vindicated and that's how we know it's thus saith the Lord It's been proven to be thus saith the Lord not listening to uncertain sounds [Music] I was listening to that message the uncertain sound and as brother Brown's
