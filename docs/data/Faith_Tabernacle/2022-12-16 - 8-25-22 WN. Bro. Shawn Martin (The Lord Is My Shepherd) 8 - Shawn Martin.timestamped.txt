[0:05] Mr Lisa Mr Faith a man and that was able
[0:11] to come out on a Thursday I know we
[0:13] changed the service on you but I know
[0:19] several several had to work and just
[0:22] wasn't able to get off but we're here
[0:26] and I know it's a service has probably
[0:29] been a little bit different but that's
[0:30] okay
[0:31] you know uh uh we don't have to have
[0:34] just everything just right
[0:36] uh uh get out of the rut sometimes and
[0:39] and uh the Lord will be with us amen the
[0:43] point is is we're here and he promised
[0:47] that he would meet us if we would come
[0:49] in his name and and I believe we've come
[0:52] in his name and and so uh we're we're
[0:56] just under expectation and
[0:59] um I'm gonna turn on this light here but
[1:02] uh
[1:04] the I want to if you want to turn to the
[1:07] Book of Psalms the 23rd chapter
[1:10] I want to thank sister Cindy for
[1:14] directing and getting the food together
[1:17] for the funeral yesterday for after the
[1:21] funeral and and thank all you sisters
[1:24] who had cooked and served yesterday and
[1:29] helped and it it was a tremendous
[1:32] blessing and and I'd heard that some of
[1:34] the sisters from the surrounding
[1:36] churches cooked and brought food and we
[1:39] I think that was just really wonderful
[1:41] to to see everyone all the churches
[1:45] working together
[1:46] Amen in time like that and I know it
[1:49] meant a lot to the Week's family and
[1:52] good to have brother John with us on a
[1:55] week night and
[1:57] so we were just keeping him and brother
[2:01] Kevin and the family their mother in
[2:03] prayer that the Lord would just continue
[2:06] to
[2:07] um
[2:08] Comfort them and bless them amen
[2:11] and before we go into the word let's
[2:14] just bow our heads and just talk to our
[2:18] Lord father
[2:20] indeed you have been faithful
[2:24] and Lord we are so humbled
[2:29] that you would call us and that you
[2:31] would choose us to walk with you in this
[2:34] age and to have that intimate
[2:37] relationship with you
[2:40] Lord that's our heart's desire is to
[2:43] have a deeper walk with you a greater
[2:47] relationship
[2:49] and Lord as
[2:52] that is your desire for us too
[2:55] you put that desire within us and you're
[2:58] pulling and Lord we feel that pool
[3:02] and to walk in this world how blessed we
[3:05] are
[3:06] to walk through this world and to
[3:09] realize of who you are so many people
[3:12] are blinded to that fact
[3:14] they're relying upon other things in
[3:18] this world Lord that only lets them down
[3:21] that father you are a true source of
[3:24] Happiness our true source of joy you're
[3:28] our life Lord
[3:30] and we're just asking that you would
[3:32] just come Among Us and minister to every
[3:35] heart anoint Lord myself father I pray
[3:40] that you would help me to get myself out
[3:41] of the way and may the people be
[3:44] anointed their hearts their ears and
[3:46] wanted to receive we ask it Lord those
[3:50] that are sick father I pray that you
[3:52] would touch them in Jesus Christ's name
[3:55] we pray
[3:57] a man and a man we didn't take up an
[4:01] offering tonight but if you have an
[4:03] offering you're wanting to give you can
[4:05] just give to Bro Sam brother Josiah we
[4:09] only got one Deacon for Sam tonight so
[4:11] appreciate him being here amen and uh
[4:14] brother Jill saiz in Oklahoma and of
[4:17] course brother Chris is at where they're
[4:21] at so anyways but um uh we we want to
[4:26] look at this and it's good to have
[4:28] Sister Mariah here too I I guess she was
[4:31] here when we were gone but first time
[4:34] for us to be here when you're here so
[4:36] amen that baby's just a Dandy's growing
[4:39] I think brother uh uh Andrew said he's
[4:43] over nine pounds now why yeah he like
[4:45] his daddy
[4:47] eight nah he don't brother Hendrick
[4:49] don't eat much but he's growing anyways
[4:54] amen so all right
[4:57] Psalms 23 1 and 2 the Lord is my
[5:01] shepherd
[5:02] I shall not want
[5:05] he maketh me to lie down in Green
[5:07] Pastures
[5:09] eliteth me beside
[5:12] The Still Waters
[5:14] amen you can have your seat this evening
[5:18] and again
[5:19] my title would be the Lord is my
[5:22] shepherd and and I I know this is a a
[5:25] simple thought and
[5:27] uh the these Brethren here the ministers
[5:30] could do a far better job than I could
[5:33] at bringing this but I I pray it'll be a
[5:37] help to you and uh I pray that you're
[5:40] enjoying the the thought on this um
[5:43] 23rd chapter and I've enjoyed it just
[5:48] studying it and it's actually kind of
[5:51] just
[5:52] um
[5:53] uh illuminated uh to me as well and so
[5:59] but I I want to deal with that second
[6:01] verse and that is he makes me to lie
[6:04] down
[6:05] in Green Pastures he leads me beside the
[6:07] Still Waters and and and I I believe
[6:11] that this is dealing with the position
[6:14] of the believer of every believer this
[6:18] is the position and and and surely we we
[6:22] can see that the believer is one who
[6:26] believes this message
[6:29] that that does not add to or take away
[6:32] but but just just believes and David
[6:37] Likens the believer uh uh as being God's
[6:41] sheep uh for he says the Lord is my
[6:45] shepherd and we've talked about you know
[6:48] there that that David is seeing that uh
[6:52] uh there's a relationship you know that
[6:56] that exists between the shepherd and and
[6:59] his sheep uh uh and of course David was
[7:02] a shepherd and and so he understood that
[7:05] relationship it's it's a it's a
[7:08] relationship that that you you wouldn't
[7:11] have with any I guess other animal
[7:14] uh per se
[7:16] um and so he's saying the Lord is my
[7:19] shepherd and and showing that that same
[7:21] relationship
[7:22] exists in even a greater relationship
[7:25] exists between the Lord and his children
[7:29] the believer and the Lord is the great
[7:34] Shepherd of our soul and and we as his
[7:38] sheep follow and and hear his voice we
[7:42] follow it and Obey it uh the believer
[7:45] doesn't tell God what to do right
[7:47] because you never find the Sheep telling
[7:49] the shepherd what to do uh the the
[7:51] believer doesn't rebel against the word
[7:54] of God or the voice of God as as the
[7:57] Sheep you wouldn't find the the the the
[7:59] Sheep rebelling against the voice of the
[8:02] shepherd now he has to be corrected as
[8:04] we know that brother Branham taught us
[8:07] that even a lamb as as a baby lamb He
[8:10] he'll wander away and that that Shepherd
[8:13] has to find him and and that Shepherd
[8:15] will you know if if he keeps wandering
[8:18] off that Shepherd will break its leg you
[8:21] know and then it'll hold it you know and
[8:22] nurture it and cater it and talk to it
[8:25] and and all along what seems to be a
[8:27] tragedy is actually a lesson it goes
[8:30] that that a bonding is taking place that
[8:33] the sheep that little lamb is is
[8:35] learning the voice of the shepherd and
[8:38] uh when that leg heals that's that
[8:41] little lamb follows that Shepherd
[8:42] everywhere and you ain't gonna find that
[8:44] lamb going off uh somewhere else you
[8:47] understand and so the believer doesn't
[8:49] just eat anything uh because sheep
[8:53] doesn't just eat anything they've got to
[8:55] have a special diet a man a special
[8:57] place and so uh the Lord our great
[9:01] Shepherd is in control and he's the one
[9:04] that's leading his Believers amen the
[9:07] believer knows nothing outside the
[9:10] leadership of the Holy Ghost ain't that
[9:12] right and the believer knows the
[9:15] believer knows just as the Sheep knows
[9:18] whether it's the shepherd or not because
[9:20] it knows its voice so does the believer
[9:23] know whether it's it's the Lord leading
[9:26] or not not ain't that right I know
[9:28] there's a lot of confusion out here
[9:30] everybody's saying the Lord told me this
[9:32] the Lord said this the Lord said this is
[9:34] going to happen and it don't happen and
[9:36] the Lord said that and the Lord said
[9:37] that so many people are disappointed
[9:40] because they thought the Lord said
[9:43] something when he really didn't say
[9:45] anything but see the sheep have a
[9:48] relationship they they're they're have
[9:50] that bond with the voice of the shepherd
[9:53] uh to where they know if it's the Lord
[9:56] speaking they they know if it's just
[9:59] somebody just blowing and going or or
[10:01] somebody that's really got the goods and
[10:04] and I I think that's a deal because uh
[10:08] uh uh the shepherd the Lord leads uh his
[10:13] Sheep by his voice ain't that Brian and
[10:16] Jesus said my sheep hear or know my
[10:19] voice Amen brother Branham talking he
[10:22] said the natural sheep was born under
[10:25] the tudorship of the Shepherd he learns
[10:28] that voice he will never pay attention
[10:30] to anybody else's voice he learns that
[10:34] Shepherd's voice and another Shepherd
[10:37] might call they might do whatever they
[10:39] want to but there's some little
[10:41] something about that Shepherd that the
[10:44] Sheep recognizes now we're living in a
[10:47] day of of great deception it's the
[10:49] greatest deception age ever to be amen
[10:53] the Bible talks about false Christ
[10:55] rising up a man talking about false
[10:58] anointed ones false teachers false
[11:00] prophets Amen brother Branham said a
[11:03] false Spirit has risen up in this last
[11:06] day showing signs and wonders deceiving
[11:09] millions millions billions of people are
[11:13] being deceived by this false Spirit
[11:15] ain't that right it's a false voice
[11:17] false signs false wonders false
[11:20] everything false Christ false anointed
[11:23] ones but when it comes to the Lord
[11:25] leading his sheep every one of his sheep
[11:28] is going to recognize that voice ain't
[11:32] that right amen that's why we we're not
[11:34] looking for signs and wonders as the
[11:36] world is we're we're not we're not
[11:38] gullible people we may be what the world
[11:41] would call boring people amen they say
[11:44] well maybe they're just not much moving
[11:46] in in the church today well what it
[11:48] really is is you're not just seeing a
[11:51] lot of commotion in the church today
[11:52] because the message has weeded a lot of
[11:56] that out amen because you go in the
[11:58] Pentecost everybody had a tongue
[12:00] everybody had a dream everybody had a
[12:03] prophecy everybody had a word from the
[12:05] Lord and it was such confusion it was
[12:07] such a mess and and and and and people
[12:10] just running here from one Revival to
[12:12] another Revival to another Revival and
[12:15] and we all looked for feelings and if
[12:18] the if if it was something like tonight
[12:19] where the Lord just wasn't you know uh
[12:22] uh where everybody just wasn't jumping
[12:24] the top of the pews and we would leave
[12:26] home to this uh the church disappointed
[12:28] and well I just don't know if we're ever
[12:30] going to make it but see all of that was
[12:32] just nonsense it was a lot of commotion
[12:35] we believe in dream but when the Lord
[12:38] gives the dream we'll believe that we
[12:40] believe in Prophecy when the Lord gives
[12:42] the prophecy we we believe in thus saith
[12:44] the Lord when the when the Lord gives
[12:46] thus saith the Lord we we believe in
[12:49] them things we believe in the move of
[12:51] God when the Lord is in the move of God
[12:53] ain't that right and so so then when
[12:57] when it comes to the Lord leading a
[12:59] sheep can I tell you there's no
[13:00] competition
[13:02] the shepherd don't have no competition
[13:04] with his sheep could you imagine the
[13:07] shepherd trying to lead his sheep
[13:08] somewhere and all these other Shepherds
[13:10] over here and and and and drawing them
[13:12] sheep out and the shepherd's like no no
[13:14] no shut up you know I'm I'm trying to
[13:16] get these sheep together I'm no no no it
[13:18] could be a line of other Shepherds it
[13:20] could be a line of other voices and the
[13:22] shepherd and they'll have to worry one
[13:24] bit about it he just calls his sheep and
[13:26] the Sheep follow can you say amen and
[13:29] that's the same way there's so many
[13:31] voices in the land today but there is a
[13:34] voice that the Sheep of God recognized
[13:37] ain't that right for Jesus said a
[13:40] stranger they will not follow ain't that
[13:44] right now so do you realize that the
[13:47] tudorship of the Holy Spirit comes
[13:50] through the message of the hour now you
[13:53] think of that uh because the brother
[13:55] Brown said see as we had read that the
[13:57] natural sheep was born under the
[13:58] tudorship of the shepherd and he learns
[14:01] that voice and he'll pay attention to no
[14:03] other voice well then if that's the case
[14:06] with the with with the natural sheep and
[14:09] Shepherd then God has the tutor which is
[14:12] the Holy Ghost a man to tutor us for us
[14:16] to learn his voice and that tutorship
[14:19] comes through the message of the hour
[14:22] do you believe that amen when a man is
[14:25] truly tutored by the Holy Spirit then he
[14:29] learns the voice of the great Shepherd
[14:32] amen that's right see then that man
[14:35] becomes the most stable the most
[14:38] established the most solid individual on
[14:41] Earth ain't that right amen so when the
[14:44] winds come when prophecies come when
[14:47] different ideas and doctrines come and
[14:50] when they try to convince us that the
[14:52] Holy Ghost is the greatest psychologist
[14:53] ever amen divorce we the Sheep says I
[14:57] know Siri why we've been tutored by the
[15:00] Holy Spirit through the message of the
[15:03] hour amen God would never tutor us under
[15:06] a voice of confusion ain't that right
[15:09] when they tell us that God ain't working
[15:11] when they tell us to quit the prayer
[15:13] line when they tell us all of these
[15:15] things amen we we ain't going to pay
[15:17] we're established because we've been
[15:20] tutored by the Holy Spirit spirit in the
[15:23] message of the hour ain't that right
[15:25] amen so he's the most solid individual
[15:28] he's no longer a child that's tossed to
[15:31] and fro he's he's not stable in all of
[15:34] his ways like a double-minded man now
[15:37] he's not carried about with with every
[15:40] wind of Doctrine ain't that right see
[15:43] and and so we find Amen brother Brown
[15:45] talking of Jesus when he was here on the
[15:47] earth he says that every every all of
[15:51] the or the people left their
[15:53] affiliations left their churches left
[15:56] left their dogmas and the traditions and
[15:59] amen to follow him amen that's right
[16:03] they followed him even Peter Peter told
[16:06] Jesus he said Lo we have left all to
[16:10] follow thee we've we've left all you
[16:13] understand what I'm saying and that's
[16:15] the Sheep that's the believer amen
[16:17] following the the great Shepherd amen
[16:20] see and the prophet said the reason why
[16:22] amen that they were able to recognize
[16:25] him and and come out of that church
[16:28] affiliation is they were spiritual
[16:30] inside and when they seen him they
[16:34] recognized that he was different from
[16:36] them priests and teachers and so forth
[16:39] so they followed him wherever he went
[16:42] and they loved him
[16:44] and you say Amen we're convinced I don't
[16:47] know what your fight why you're
[16:48] following the message of the hour but
[16:50] I'll tell you why I'm following is
[16:52] because I'm convinced I see something
[16:54] different than the than psychology I see
[16:57] something different than the seminaries
[17:00] have produced I've seen something
[17:01] different than a churches have produced
[17:04] I've seen something different and I see
[17:06] God made manifest in this age
[17:10] ain't that right amen and so as as
[17:14] there's that strong bond that develops
[17:17] between the shepherd and the Sheep so as
[17:19] it is with the Lord and his Sheep amen a
[17:22] strong bond a strong Fellowship now
[17:26] there are a few things about this second
[17:28] verse that I want to look at amen and
[17:31] we've talked about it the last time I
[17:34] spoke on it uh here but uh uh of course
[17:37] the pasture is green he says he he he he
[17:40] uh makes me lie down in Green Pastures
[17:44] so it's showing that there's a freshness
[17:46] there a freshness it's not old and stale
[17:51] David's not in a place where it's old
[17:53] and stale and dead and dried up uh but
[17:57] but it's Green Pastures and and and the
[18:01] prophet said it's the Green Pastures
[18:02] where we eat so that's where your food
[18:05] is is in Green Pastures showing that our
[18:08] food has life in it it ain't that right
[18:12] even Jesus says that John in John 6 63
[18:16] the words that I speak unto you they are
[18:19] spirit and they are life ain't that
[18:22] right amen but another thing David also
[18:26] says is that he is Led he leadeth me
[18:29] beside the Still Waters and and this
[18:33] this I don't know you can take it for
[18:35] whatever but as I've just been studying
[18:38] this well water represents the prophet
[18:41] said the water represents life
[18:43] a man represents the Holy Spirit he said
[18:46] that one water is Christ his holy spirit
[18:49] so when you're looking at that verse uh
[18:52] you you know that the shepherd is
[18:55] leading his sheep the Lord leading us to
[18:59] where life is ain't that right life that
[19:02] that's where life is it's it's it's uh
[19:05] it's telling us that spiritual death
[19:08] cannot come to this place spiritual
[19:11] death can't touch me because I'm in a
[19:14] place of Life the food that I'm eating
[19:16] has life the water that I'm drinking is
[19:19] not dirty stagnated is it's life to me
[19:23] can you say Amen he's he's leading us
[19:26] now I I to me this is very special Amen
[19:31] to know that God is leading Us in life
[19:34] amen it's the place where the token is
[19:37] amen and that's life ain't that right
[19:40] amen yes sir remember the prophet said
[19:43] in foodless pastures are where the
[19:46] spiritually dead are held amen they're
[19:49] held in foodless pastures and that's
[19:53] where the spiritually dead are ain't
[19:56] that right but notice as I'm going to go
[19:58] here amen they were bitten to come but
[20:02] they refused to do so they were bitten
[20:04] to come to the feast but they were
[20:06] bitten to or or they refused to and
[20:09] Matthew 22 and 2 Jesus said the Kingdom
[20:13] of Heaven is like unto a certain King
[20:15] which made a marriage for his son now I
[20:18] want you to listen to this and send
[20:20] forth his servants to call them that
[20:23] were bitten to the wedding and they
[20:25] would not come ain't that right they
[20:27] were bitten but they weren't coming amen
[20:30] and and again he sent forth other
[20:33] servants saying tell them which are
[20:35] bitten behold I have prepared my dinner
[20:37] my oxen and my fatlings are killed all
[20:41] things are ready come unto the marriage
[20:43] but they made light of it and went their
[20:46] ways and one to his farm another to his
[20:49] merchandise and the remnant took his
[20:51] servants and and treated him spitefully
[20:53] and slew them and but when the king
[20:56] therefore heard he was Wrath and sent
[20:59] forth his armies and destroyed those
[21:02] murderers and burned up their City then
[21:05] he saith unto his servants the wedding
[21:07] is ready but they which were bitten were
[21:12] not worthy ain't that right now the
[21:15] prophet speaks of this a man in the uh
[21:19] uh uh is your life worthy of the Gospel
[21:22] amen but but he goes here the prophet
[21:25] says this he says notice they don't do
[21:28] it they they won't do it they in other
[21:30] words they won't come now think of this
[21:33] now what what kind of a people you you
[21:35] are and what kind of people have refused
[21:37] this amen see they have their excuse
[21:40] maybe their Church don't believe it in
[21:43] it see well but Jesus said you know what
[21:46] say to a man tonight he said you know
[21:48] speak to his heart and say I want you to
[21:50] go and preach the Full Gospel and he
[21:53] said but that man will say well my
[21:55] church don't stand for it Lord excuse me
[21:57] if you will see I've got a fine charge
[22:00] you know I'm a pastor one of the
[22:02] greatest churches in the city oh Lord we
[22:05] praise your name down there yes sir we
[22:08] sure do but I just can't do that see see
[22:11] it's the same excuse the same thing so
[22:15] they don't come to the spiritual Feast
[22:19] of his promise Vindicated word
[22:22] can you say Amen so I want you to
[22:24] understand that green pasture is a
[22:27] spiritual feast

[23:49] putting food in you're putting life in
[23:52] can you say Amen you're putting life in
[23:55] and and and and we're realizing how
[23:57] important it is for life to be in our
[24:00] body amen not just natural we're talking
[24:02] spiritual now amen you see the prophet
[24:05] would tell us that the church is an
[24:08] anemia amen that's what he says anemia
[24:11] amen the church is anemia because
[24:14] they're not getting enough spiritual
[24:16] food ain't that right they're sick
[24:19] they're weakly amen they they they can't
[24:22] fight off them germs they they can't
[24:24] fight off them diseases uh spiritual
[24:27] diseases and all that amen they ain't
[24:29] got enough Faith to stand alone on God's
[24:32] word amen because they're not getting
[24:34] spiritual food
[24:36] can you say man now look we've had
[24:39] earthquakes we've had we we've had wars
[24:42] and rumors of wars we've had distress of
[24:45] Nations we've had things happen all
[24:47] around the world men's hearts are
[24:49] failing for fear amen and we've had all
[24:52] that because the Bible says it would
[24:54] happen but notice the last plague and
[24:57] this is the prophet saying this a man
[24:59] quoting the prophet the last plague that
[25:02] is to fall is death amen we've had all
[25:05] these things around in the world but the
[25:08] last plague is death and it's falling
[25:10] it's it's a spiritual death that is
[25:13] falling in this nation ain't that right
[25:15] it's spiritual death that has fallen in
[25:17] the nation fallen in the world uh today
[25:20] amen you see death was the last plague a
[25:24] man that fell in Egypt right at the time
[25:27] of Exodus ain't that right right at the
[25:31] time of Exodus and the prophet would
[25:33] tell us and notice it was amongst the
[25:36] sons that it fell on death came to the
[25:40] sons amen and he says the church has got
[25:44] more members than it ever had thriving
[25:47] better than it ever did and yet the
[25:49] weakest in spirit that it ever was ain't
[25:53] that right he said that's just like it
[25:55] was in Egypt amen death in the land as
[25:59] it was fallen on the Suns back then it's
[26:01] falling upon the churches in this hour
[26:04] today amen oh yeah more members great
[26:07] big empires of churches and and
[26:09] professional musicians professional
[26:12] choirs professional preachers
[26:14] well-trained uh audience and everything
[26:16] just right amen but they're the weakest
[26:19] ever
[26:21] can you say Amen they're the weakest
[26:24] ever
[26:25] amen why amen they're they're they're
[26:27] they're they're they're caught up in
[26:28] their Traditions caught up in ruts
[26:33] amen when when the ruts get when we get
[26:36] out of ruts people don't know what to do
[26:39] [Music]
[26:40] it's true
[26:41] you know they used to have church
[26:43] without music
[26:46] you understand what I'm saying they used
[26:48] to add just a good old time
[26:49] old-fashioned Holy Ghost just beating
[26:51] the tambourine
[26:52] all right but we get so used to things
[26:55] amen and and then when it doesn't go
[26:58] that way we all just we go freeze hello
[27:01] well when the spirit of God began to
[27:04] move in this nation the churches begin
[27:05] to freeze up they they weren't used to
[27:08] this spirit of God they they weren't
[27:10] used to the move of God so they called
[27:12] it up the devil
[27:13] ain't that right see but it was actually
[27:16] what they didn't know it was an
[27:18] invitation to come to the feast amen
[27:20] amen that's that's right see and so the
[27:23] prophet said the churches are
[27:24] spiritually dying they're drying up and
[27:26] they're blowing away why are they dying
[27:29] he would say why are they dying because
[27:31] they threw their own wisdom has
[27:35] strangled everybody say strangled they
[27:38] have strangled the holy spirit away from
[27:41] them now think of that they have
[27:44] strangled and I thought well why in the
[27:46] world you know uh they they he would use
[27:49] that word strangle well see they now I
[27:52] know they're saying they got the Holy
[27:53] Ghost but you and I let's just face
[27:55] facts they ain't got the Holy Ghost
[27:58] if they had the Holy Ghost it would
[28:00] straighten their lives up like it did on
[28:02] the day of Pentecost it would change
[28:04] their thought pattern it would change
[28:06] their ways it it would change the habits
[28:09] it it would change the desire it they
[28:11] would just but they would beat the door
[28:13] down to come to church they would beat
[28:15] the doors down just to get together and
[28:18] have Christian Fellowship amen but
[28:20] they'd there's more people more
[28:22] comfortable with the sinner than they
[28:24] are with the church
[28:26] I've always wondered about that when
[28:28] people claim to have the Holy Ghost and
[28:30] they're more at home with the sinner
[28:32] than they are with the saints of God
[28:34] they they'll point the they'll Point all
[28:37] the faults out in the church the
[28:39] preacher all the way down and they won't
[28:41] want to they want that yet they don't
[28:43] see any Fault With The Sinner
[28:46] that what you don't know a man is the
[28:49] blood is covering the people of God the
[28:52] blood is covering the saints of God Amen
[28:55] where is The Sinner they're under a
[28:57] wrath of God can you say amen that's
[29:00] right see now they're saying that
[29:02] they've got the Holy Ghost but they
[29:03] don't amen that's right Satan now notice
[29:06] the Bible says uh there in Revelations 3
[29:09] 19 behold I stand at the door and knock
[29:12] If any man hear my voice and open the
[29:15] door I will come into him and will sup
[29:18] with him and he with me ain't that right
[29:21] so this prophecy now we all know that
[29:24] this prophecy has been fulfilled it is
[29:28] not we're not waiting for it to be
[29:30] fulfilled it's not being fulfilled it
[29:33] has been fulfilled Christ has been
[29:36] kicked out of the church notice brother
[29:39] Branham uses that same word strangled
[29:41] again he said Jesus had been strangled
[29:44] from his church
[29:46] well I thought of that so I looked up
[29:49] word strangle it means to seriously or
[29:52] fatally obstruct the normal breathing
[29:56] now now that's important and now I
[29:59] understand why he was using that word
[30:01] strangled that they strangled him they
[30:05] got him by the throat and strangled him
[30:07] where he couldn't breathe anymore well
[30:10] you see now now remember how did Adam
[30:13] become a living Soul the Bible says that
[30:16] God breathed the breath of life into him
[30:19] that's exactly right Genesis 2 7 and the
[30:22] Lord for him Man Out of the Dust of the
[30:24] ground and breathe into his nostrils the
[30:27] Breath of Life
[30:30] ain't that right and Man became a living
[30:33] Soul man's life came to him by the
[30:37] Breath of God Amen notice John 20 and 21
[30:41] then Jesus said to them again peace be
[30:44] unto you as my as my father has sent me
[30:47] even so send I you and when he had said
[30:51] this he breathed on them he breathed
[30:56] upon them now someone asked brother
[30:58] Branham what in the world did that mean
[30:59] he breathed upon them and then said
[31:03] receive ye the Holy Ghost the prophet
[31:05] said he was breathing the promise on
[31:07] them breathing the promise God have
[31:11] mercy that Breath of God is something we
[31:14] need today ain't that right the Breath
[31:17] of God Amen is the one that's giving
[31:19] life to the church breathing the
[31:22] promises of God to us ain't that right
[31:24] the prophet said the Church of God is
[31:27] born of the Breath of God he says in
[31:30] another place the true Pentecostal
[31:32] church is born of the Breath of God he
[31:36] says in another place when you become a
[31:38] child of God Amen you are born by the
[31:42] Breath of God ain't that right so no
[31:45] wonder he would use this word strangled
[31:48] Jesus was strangled to where he could no
[31:52] longer breathe upon them he could not
[31:55] give them life so now they're sitting
[31:57] dead in their Pew they're sitting dead
[32:00] Amen to a religious form because they
[32:04] have strangled him from his church can
[32:07] you say Amen we don't want to strangle
[32:09] the Lord
[32:10] can you say Amen if anything we want him
[32:13] to breathe the breath of life upon us
[32:16] amen so we see why the death is the last
[32:20] plague of death the church has brought
[32:22] it upon themselves they kicked him out
[32:25] they didn't want him breathing the
[32:27] breaths of promises on them they didn't
[32:29] want the breath of life amen well you
[32:31] know the prophet said the word can only
[32:33] produce a tongue talk in Acts 2 38
[32:35] blabbering amen uh uh man I wished I had
[32:39] the quote before me but they in other
[32:41] words he at what what the word produces
[32:44] the world thinks is crazy what the word
[32:47] produces the church don't like so God
[32:50] come in this age to breathe the Breath
[32:53] of Life
[32:54] amen
[32:57] ain't that right
[32:59] now notice though
[33:02] God made a way of Escape
[33:05] just before the last plague hit
[33:07] right what does he do he requires a
[33:10] token
[33:11] when I see the blood
[33:14] I'll pass over you that token had to be
[33:18] put on display
[33:19] ain't that right and he's requiring the
[33:22] token today brother Brown said no other
[33:24] time in in the church ages did god
[33:27] require a token amen it's been the lamb
[33:30] the lamb the lamb the lamb all the way
[33:31] through but in this age God is requiring
[33:34] a token ain't that right yes sir and the
[33:38] prophet says that life that was in the
[33:41] lamb see uh uh has returned back and is
[33:45] publicly sealed in there that everybody
[33:48] passing by talking to you has any
[33:51] Associates with you seeing that the
[33:53] blood has been applied and the token of
[33:56] the life that was in the blood is upon
[33:59] you you are safe from the Wrath
[34:03] ain't that right
[34:04] amen that's right see so this is why we
[34:07] needed the spirit of God in the church
[34:09] today we needed that Prophet amen God
[34:12] through that Prophet now this is just
[34:13] what I'm thinking and I believe is God
[34:15] through that Prophet was breathing the
[34:18] Breath of Life to the church
[34:21] putting life into the church and the
[34:25] life is the token do you believe that
[34:28] not the natural blood the natural blood
[34:30] the chemistry of that blood of the Lamb
[34:33] had to be applied upon the door amen but
[34:36] now we ain't got no blood of Jesus
[34:38] Christ that all went into the ground
[34:40] that even if you had the the physical
[34:43] literal blood of Jesus Christ it could
[34:45] do you no good
[34:47] hello
[34:51] it's what the prophet teaches us now it
[34:53] could do you no good
[34:55] what the token is today is the life
[34:59] of the blood
[35:01] the light see the animal life could not
[35:03] come back the the the the life of that
[35:06] natural lamb could not come back up on
[35:08] the believer so they had to use the the
[35:10] natural blood to put it up on the door
[35:12] and then had to be on display now the
[35:16] life of Jesus Christ has to be put on
[35:19] display in your life
[35:21] can you say amen and notice in the Green
[35:24] Pastures in where that water it's all
[35:27] speaking of life
[35:28] that's where we're at it's sustaining
[35:31] life to us
[35:35] not displaying life today and tomorrow
[35:37] you don't know what you're displaying
[35:40] and then the next day you know you play
[35:42] it just play a little bit of life and
[35:44] you know it's it's not that way at all
[35:47] it's everyday life everyday life you're
[35:51] on display life on display life on
[35:53] display can you say man so what a joy it
[35:57] is to know that we're not in a
[35:59] spiritually dead condition
[36:02] I am safe how many believes you're safe
[36:05] I am safe no weapon formed against me is
[36:09] going to prosper I look look at the
[36:12] wrath of God all around but he's placed
[36:15] Us in Green Pastures he placed Us by the
[36:18] rivers of water
[36:21] that's right now notice this Green
[36:23] Pastures must be in a valley
[36:26] because in the valley is where you find
[36:28] the water
[36:29] it is also where you find the best soil
[36:33] is in the valley
[36:35] in the valley is also where the Lily
[36:37] grows ain't that right
[36:40] so it's in the valley you find water and
[36:42] so David says he leadeth me beside the
[36:46] Still Waters now you all know this
[36:48] scripture but I'm going to read it
[36:50] Psalms 1 and 1. blessed is the man that
[36:54] walketh not in the council or the wisdom
[36:57] of the ungodly
[36:59] nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor
[37:02] Sith in the seat of the scornful but his
[37:05] Delight is in the law or the word of the
[37:09] Lord
[37:09] and in his law does he meditate day and
[37:12] night ain't that right and he shall be
[37:16] like a tree planted by what
[37:21] rivers
[37:23] of water
[37:25] that man will be planted by the rivers
[37:29] of water that bringeth forth his fruit
[37:31] in his season notice his Leaf also shall
[37:36] not wither
[37:37] he may go through different seasons in
[37:40] his life but his Leaf will not wither
[37:43] that life will be on display all the
[37:46] time
[37:47] no matter what season he's in no matter
[37:50] what trial he's going through that life
[37:53] is in on display his Leaf shall not
[37:56] wither and whatsoever he doeth shall
[37:59] prosper
[38:01] that's the man
[38:03] that's planted like a tree
[38:06] he's planted brother Graham said he's
[38:08] not planted on a Dusty desert rock
[38:11] but he's planted in the valley beside
[38:14] Rivers plural
[38:17] rivers of water singular
[38:21] and he says the river speak of the nine
[38:23] spiritual gifts that Paul speaks of
[38:26] and the water speaks of one Spirit the
[38:29] Holy Spirit ain't that right so nine
[38:33] rivers of the same water
[38:36] ain't that right and the thing that man
[38:40] is planted right there
[38:42] all right oh Hallelujah
[38:46] I know people don't believe in the gifts
[38:48] today
[38:50] but if a man is planted by the rivers of
[38:52] water he's planted by them gifts
[38:56] and you know what he's doing he's
[38:58] drawing strength
[39:01] from them Waters
[39:04] ain't that right
[39:06] yes sir now in our opening scripture
[39:08] David said they're still waters and I'm
[39:11] going to get to that later on Still
[39:13] Waters
[39:14] but this man is planted by the rivers of
[39:17] water and the prophet said
[39:19] he's not there by chance
[39:24] I want you to think of that
[39:27] it's not by chance that you're there
[39:31] it's not by chance you come into this
[39:33] message
[39:34] it's not my chance that you something
[39:37] pricked your heart
[39:39] see God planted you there when would you
[39:43] planted the prophet said before the
[39:44] foundation of the world
[39:46] God wrote your name in his book
[39:50] he planted you then then
[39:53] by the rivers of water
[39:56] he said that thought before the that
[39:58] that thought of God before the
[39:59] foundation of the world placed him there
[40:01] he's not stuck out
[40:05] just stuck there he's planted there
[40:09] then you say Amen you realize that
[40:11] you're predestinated to be there
[40:14] every aspect of your life you do you
[40:17] realize that you're just we're just
[40:19] coming to what we were predestinated to
[40:21] be we we were never predestinated to be
[40:24] Sinners God allowed us to be Sinners but
[40:27] it wasn't his perfect will
[40:29] we weren't predestinated to be what we
[40:31] were drunks Liars thieves whatever we
[40:35] were the Bible never tells us that we
[40:37] were predestinated for that we we
[40:39] understand that was his permissive will
[40:41] amen but now we're looking at his
[40:44] perfect will
[40:46] ain't that right that we were
[40:48] predestinated before the foundation of
[40:51] the world to be conformed to the image
[40:53] of his son
[40:56] come on that's right
[40:58] so you're coming now to what you've been
[41:01] ordained to all right from your birth
[41:05] all the way up to the end of your life
[41:08] you think of what God has been doing
[41:10] even though you didn't even know God
[41:12] even though you didn't understand him
[41:14] and it may be nothing about church or
[41:16] you could have been religious whatever
[41:19] but God had been directing your path
[41:22] your path aren't you glad that God been
[41:24] directing your path even when he's a
[41:26] sinner even when you was walking in that
[41:28] bar God was still protecting you God was
[41:31] still guiding you hello
[41:33] now he may have not predestinated you to
[41:35] be in that bar but he had a
[41:37] predestination for you
[41:39] he had a destination for you he had a
[41:42] plan for you and he begins to direct you
[41:45] and he somehow you didn't just by chance
[41:47] begin just happened to walk by a church
[41:49] and hear song sung you just didn't
[41:52] happen to amen just to have a religious
[41:54] thought and say you know what I'm just
[41:56] tired of the way I am I just want to
[41:58] give my heart to God that wasn't by
[42:01] chance God had been directing you and
[42:04] leading you all the way through your
[42:06] life to come to that point
[42:08] ain't that right you gave your heart to
[42:11] God now that's what you were
[42:13] predestinated to do
[42:15] you received the baptism of the Holy
[42:17] Ghost and you realize he predestinated
[42:20] the point the time the place the very
[42:23] second that he would come into your
[42:25] heart
[42:26] and there was no devil that could ever
[42:28] stop that
[42:32] can you say Amen if we can only realize
[42:35] just how planted we really are
[42:38] all right
[42:40] not a church plant
[42:43] this is a Heavenly plant
[42:48] now if you come to the altar by
[42:49] predestination you realize the
[42:51] Millennium is there waiting on you
[42:53] everything is waiting the table's ready
[42:59] even your body is waiting on the other
[43:02] side your theophany
[43:05] it's all this ain't by chance you were
[43:07] planted
[43:09] can you say Amen
[43:11] and then there comes that time in our
[43:14] life where we go to what we were
[43:15] predestinated for brother Brown said he
[43:18] was predestined talking about that man
[43:20] that's planted he was predestinated to
[43:23] catch that word when it was sold
[43:27] means they'll be right there when it
[43:31] sticks she is there he's planted not
[43:35] just stuck down he's actually planted
[43:37] that's right a lot of difference see
[43:40] sticking a stick in the ground then
[43:42] planting something it's different the
[43:44] seed was planted it found its own root
[43:48] hole
[43:49] when the water begins to come in and
[43:51] Break Forth its life the spirit and it
[43:54] began you say well there are nine
[43:55] spiritual gifts and he says amen
[43:58] Let Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[44:00] today and forever amen why he's planted
[44:06] so this experience if I can if I can let
[44:09] you know this experience of being in the
[44:12] Green Pastures and by The Still Waters
[44:15] it's not just a passing thing it's the
[44:18] place where you belong
[44:21] can you say Amen it's the place you
[44:25] belong so therefore you're you're not
[44:28] you're not looking at the word and
[44:30] accepting part of the word and denying
[44:32] the other part amen and you're so mixed
[44:34] up in your mind that that ain't it
[44:36] you're planted in there
[44:40] and that's what the prophet is saying
[44:42] see someone says well he still heals
[44:44] just like he always did and that plant a
[44:46] tree that man will say amen amen
[44:50] amen we got so many people that are just
[44:52] stuck in the message
[44:56] but then there are people that are
[44:57] planted
[44:59] [Applause]
[45:01] well do you love him
[45:03] he said he's planted by the rivers
[45:06] rivers coming from every side rivers of
[45:08] water no wonder he can't weather
[45:10] no wonder he's planted some of them seed
[45:13] fell over there he can't die it's right
[45:16] in the Stream of life
[45:18] it keeps producing that's right it's
[45:21] drawing its life out of them Rivers can
[45:24] you say Amen the new the Old Testament
[45:27] see just being fed right on through
[45:29] there but notice another thing as we get
[45:32] ready to close but another thing that
[45:35] David says notice he lead he maketh me
[45:38] lie down in Green Pastures
[45:40] he leads me beside the Still Waters one
[45:45] thing that stands out to me about this
[45:46] verse is that it speaks of peace
[45:50] contentment
[45:52] rest
[45:54] hello
[45:56] it speaks of a state of being satisfied
[46:03] he may give me lie down
[46:07] the Sheep ain't Nancy
[46:10] it ain't nervous looking around
[46:14] it's actually been able to lay down and
[46:16] rest
[46:18] it's able it's got peace about it
[46:21] hello
[46:23] now that means a lot because it's
[46:25] showing us that wherever the Sheep's
[46:28] food is and the water supply is
[46:31] there's rest
[46:33] there's peace
[46:35] there's contentment
[46:37] the Sheep ain't nervous and antsy
[46:40] we got that Spirit of anxiety that's
[46:42] dominating the world today you know why
[46:44] it is because judgment's coming
[46:47] and that same spirit is trying to get up
[46:49] on this bride
[46:51] and is trying to dominate this bride
[46:53] hello you ain't gonna deal with that you
[46:56] ain't gonna be able to deal with that
[46:58] Spirit by medicine
[46:59] as they're trying to do with these young
[47:02] children
[47:04] it's a spirit
[47:06] [Music]
[47:08] hello
[47:10] but here David is telling us that that
[47:13] Spirit of anxiety cannot touch us
[47:16] I'm made to lie down in Green Pastures
[47:20] I ain't worried about the future
[47:22] I'm right where I belong
[47:25] I I ain't running to and fro trying to
[47:28] find peace
[47:29] I'm laying in the Green Pastures
[47:32] I'm beside the waters that are steel you
[47:35] know still waters are not ripped they're
[47:36] not making a lot of noise
[47:39] hello
[47:40] that's right see see the judgments of
[47:43] God are falling now this ought to make
[47:46] something to us because I believe this
[47:48] scripture applies for our day but that
[47:50] the judgments are falling but while it's
[47:54] falling David is made to lie down
[47:58] now it ain't God getting him and said
[48:00] lying down lie down lie down no no no
[48:02] this saying the Sheep is satisfied
[48:06] his belly is full
[48:09] he ain't thirsty
[48:12] the fruits of the water supply of the
[48:14] air
[48:14] so he's not trying to looking around and
[48:17] all this and the shepherd don't know
[48:18] what to do the shepherd has provided the
[48:21] place for him
[48:26] now the believer's not worried for he's
[48:28] safe
[48:30] also in the Green Pastures was it not
[48:33] the Green Pastures in the Green Pastures
[48:35] that the power of God was manifested
[48:37] when the bear came after the Sheep God
[48:39] manifested his power when the lion came
[48:42] after the Sheep the supernatural was
[48:44] manifested to deliver the sheep and you
[48:47] say Amen
[48:48] I I don't know but just why why was the
[48:52] supernatural manifested in this age
[48:56] to bring Deliverance to the Sheep
[48:59] to deliver that sheep can you say Amen
[49:02] as we talked about from the mouth of the
[49:04] Baptist from the mouth of the Pentecost
[49:06] from the mouth of sickness and disease
[49:08] the supernatural but notice where the
[49:11] supernatural came from it came from
[49:14] where the food is
[49:18] hello
[49:20] you might think me crazy but I just I I
[49:23] don't know I I just believe as we see
[49:26] the supernatural
[49:29] taking place and if you look that's
[49:31] where your Green Pastures are that's
[49:33] where we've been placed that's where
[49:34] we've been brought to
[49:36] spiritually speaking
[49:38] can you say Amen see now the prophet now
[49:41] notice in this Green Pastures
[49:43] the prophet said in his prayer said you
[49:46] set them talking about to the Lord you
[49:48] set them your sheep your children
[49:50] by The Still Waters and the Green
[49:52] Pastures and they have a wonderful time
[49:56] rejoicing and praising God
[50:02] in any time
[50:04] and I know this might be a paradox in it
[50:07] well it is it's it's definitely
[50:09] different
[50:10] when everybody is depressed
[50:13] everybody is so negative
[50:15] everybody is so unthankful
[50:18] everybody wanting to write
[50:21] everybody thinks they've been done wrong
[50:23] everybody been thinking they they they
[50:25] just uh you know underprivileged and
[50:29] it's going on and on and on and on
[50:33] yet there is a people that is just
[50:36] simply
[50:37] praising God and rejoicing
[50:40] because their needs have been supplied
[50:42] they're in a place in a condition where
[50:45] they shall not want
[50:47] so they're not in need God has already
[50:49] provided
[50:51] that they're eating of life life is
[50:54] being sustained in them it's being
[50:56] renewed in them can you say Amen they're
[50:59] drawing from the Waters of Life
[51:02] why can't you just praise the Lord
[51:06] why can't we just be thankful ain't that
[51:09] right do you realize that fits with
[51:12] Revelations 5 and 1 through 13. I I
[51:15] could read it to you but you all know it
[51:18] where John Salva the book that was
[51:20] closed sealed with Seven Seals and the
[51:23] The Voice began to cry who is worthy to
[51:26] open the seals or the book The Loose the
[51:29] seals thereof and John says I'll begin
[51:31] to weep I I cried and and then I hear
[51:35] this uh voice uh say you know we've
[51:39] knocked John
[51:40] behold the line of the tribe of Judah
[51:42] has prevailed he's worthy to open the
[51:45] book thereof and to loosen them seals
[51:48] turned around and looked and there was a
[51:50] bloody bleeding lamb
[51:52] ain't that right
[51:53] and the lamb come and the Bible says he
[51:56] came and took the book out of the right
[51:58] hand of him that set up on the throne
[52:00] and notice it changed the atmosphere it
[52:03] changed the it changed the service it
[52:06] changed everything it brought it from
[52:08] weeping to rejoicing it brought it from
[52:11] down-hearted to worship hey can you say
[52:15] amen I tried see and they sang a new
[52:18] song talking about the four beasts and
[52:20] the Four and Twenty elders and they
[52:21] began to praise him and glorify him and
[52:24] they sung a new song Thou Art Worthy to
[52:26] take the book to open the seals thereof
[52:28] for thou was slain and Hast redeemed us
[52:31] to God by thy blood out of every Kindred
[52:34] and tongue and people in nation and has
[52:36] made us unto our God Kings and Priests
[52:38] and we shall reign upon the Earth ain't
[52:41] that right and he says the number of
[52:43] them was ten thousands times ten
[52:45] thousands and thousands of thousands of
[52:48] angels and beasts and elders and they
[52:51] were rejoicing and as saying Worthy is
[52:54] the Lamb that was slain to receive power
[52:56] riches wisdom strings and honor glory
[52:59] and blessings ain't that right but then
[53:02] John being the type of the Bride as he's
[53:05] washing this watching the worship take
[53:07] place in the atmosphere he enters into
[53:10] that and says every creature which is in
[53:13] to heaven and on Earth on the earth and
[53:16] under the Earth and such as are in the
[53:18] sea and all that are in them heard I
[53:21] sing blessing and honor and glory and
[53:24] power be unto him that sitteth upon the
[53:27] throne and unto the lamb forever and
[53:29] ever can you say Amen see oh I tell you
[53:33] now I'm hoping we can identify with them
[53:36] Green Pastures are amen John saw
[53:39] something here and the prophet said
[53:40] we're in them Green Pastures by The
[53:43] Still Waters secondary rejoicing and
[53:46] praising God and and and having just a
[53:49] good old time and the world all around
[53:52] us is in depression anxiety amen they're
[53:55] blowing their brains out they don't know
[53:57] what to do they're they're facing Doom
[54:00] and Gloom the wrath of God is upon them
[54:02] and right in the middle of it all there
[54:05] is a church there is a people amen that
[54:07] the Lord is their Shepherd amen they're
[54:10] smack dab where God wants them to be
[54:12] their plan entered there the devil can't
[54:15] take them out they're planted there no
[54:18] sin is great enough to take you out your
[54:21] plan is there
[54:23] you're rejoicing
[54:26] having a good time
[54:28] can you say Amen
[54:30] now what kind of food are we eating
[54:35] there's got to be a kind of food that
[54:37] makes them lay down because they're
[54:38] satisfied right it must be the right
[54:40] food
[54:43] and I'll close
[54:45] great according to Revelations 10 8
[54:48] 9 it's the open book
[54:52] that's our food
[54:54] it's the open book
[54:56] not a closed book
[55:01] so where do we get the open book at
[55:03] where do we get our food at Revelations
[55:06] 10 1 and I saw another Mighty Angel come
[55:08] down from heaven only Christ it could be
[55:10] Prophet said
[55:12] cold with a cloud and a rainbow is upon
[55:14] his head and his face was as it were the
[55:16] Sun and his feet is pillars of fire and
[55:18] he had in his hand a little open book
[55:21] no longer closed
[55:23] open book and he set his right foot upon
[55:26] the sea in his left foot on the earth we
[55:28] didn't know that that book was open
[55:30] but he came down with the open book
[55:33] and he cried with the loud voice as when
[55:35] a lion roared and when he cried seven
[55:37] Thunders out of their voice
[55:39] you know this story
[55:42] this event correlates with Joseph of the
[55:45] Old Testament
[55:47] Joseph was betrayed by his Brethren
[55:49] sowed as a slave
[55:52] you know be it Joseph is called the son
[55:56] of prosperity
[55:58] because wherever he went wherever he was
[56:01] things prospered
[56:04] and he was the type of Jesus Christ
[56:07] and God showed Joseph
[56:09] God showed Joseph that there would be
[56:11] seven years of plenty
[56:15] the gifts would be there in operation
[56:20] it'd be an abundant dreams and visions
[56:22] and healings
[56:24] healing campaigns
[56:26] she's going to put it that way
[56:28] the word
[56:32] being brought
[56:34] years of plenty
[56:38] but then he showed him that it would
[56:40] after them seven years they would follow
[56:42] a famine
[56:44] in the land
[56:47] so Joseph
[56:50] by this time
[56:52] he was now living in the palace
[56:55] ruling over the Kingdom right
[56:59] and Joseph's stored up
[57:02] food in the years of plenty thank you
[57:06] stored up them years of plenty
[57:09] while he was preparing for famine
[57:13] is that right
[57:15] and brother brim says it was the only
[57:17] place in the world that had food
[57:22] hello
[57:25] and Joseph had the keys to the food
[57:31] he had the power to give food
[57:35] for there was no other
[57:38] that could give the food
[57:40] ain't that right
[57:42] and brother Brown said it's the perfect
[57:43] of the church today the only place
[57:46] spiritual food is given out is in the
[57:49] Kingdom of Jesus Christ
[57:53] you can go and take some old church
[57:55] Creed and recite a few Apostles Creeds
[57:58] or whatever you want to but brother the
[58:00] spirit lays in the born-again Church of
[58:03] the Living God is only where there's
[58:06] food
[58:09] can you say Amen
[58:11] now here is Christ coming down
[58:16] and what looks to be just the symbol a
[58:19] book
[58:21] is our food
[58:24] hello
[58:26] he's the son of prosperity
[58:30] amen
[58:32] the seventh verse but in the last days
[58:34] uh but in the days of the voice of the
[58:36] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[58:38] sound the mystery of God should be
[58:40] finished as he hath declared to his
[58:41] servants the prophets
[58:43] notice he took the book opened the book
[58:45] tore up the seals and sent it down to
[58:47] the Earth to his seventh angel to reveal
[58:49] it to his people
[58:52] to reveal it to who his people it's
[58:56] hidden to the rest of the world there
[58:58] you are notice he asked this question oh
[59:01] my what happened
[59:03] the screams the shouts the hallelujahs
[59:08] the anointed the power the glory the
[59:11] manifestation that's what came from the
[59:14] open book
[59:16] amen an old John who had been standing
[59:19] there our brother crying why he said
[59:21] everything on Earth everything in heaven
[59:23] uh uh everything in the sea heard me
[59:25] holler amen blessings honor and might
[59:28] and power be to him that lives forever
[59:30] and ever talk about a happy time when
[59:32] themselves broke John must have looked
[59:35] in and seen past the curtain of time and
[59:38] said there's John and he was so happy
[59:43] I don't know what that does for you
[59:47] but the revelation of the open book that
[59:51] open book allowed John to see himself in
[59:54] the future
[59:56] beyond the curtain of time Beyond this
[59:58] Mortal life
[1:00:00] he saw himself in that Millennium he saw
[1:00:04] himself in the new Heaven and new earth
[1:00:07] he saw himself that death could not oh
[1:00:11] death death could take him to the grave
[1:00:13] but there was something coming up yonder
[1:00:15] he already saw himself
[1:00:18] no wonder
[1:00:19] there is peace contentment and
[1:00:22] satisfaction can you say Amen
[1:00:25] the open book that's our food
[1:00:28] if the musicians will come
[1:00:30] got a lot more but we'll we'll just
[1:00:31] close
[1:00:33] sustaining life

[1:00:56] luck anymore
[1:00:58] you're eating food
[1:01:02] that you're seeing it's it's it's

[1:01:21] nope I'm at rest
[1:01:23] he maketh me to lie down
[1:01:26] in the Green Pastures
[1:01:28] oh my
[1:01:30] the people of God are at rest
[1:01:33] and you can tell it by the food they're
[1:01:34] eating
[1:01:37] now for those that are not eaten that
[1:01:39] don't listen to these messages
[1:01:45] and you're feeding off of everything
[1:01:46] else you're listening to all the gossip
[1:01:49] Christians don't listen to gossip
[1:01:54] Christians don't have ears and let their
[1:01:56] ears be garbage cans
[1:02:00] Christians feed off the word of God
[1:02:03] [Music]
[1:02:05] you can listen to all the complaints of
[1:02:07] those that have left this church
[1:02:10] and let your ears be the garbage cans
[1:02:12] you'll never get anywhere with God
[1:02:15] you can listen to the complaints of the
[1:02:17] world you can listen to complaints of
[1:02:19] everything and that's up to you
[1:02:22] that you'll never find strength
[1:02:25] that way
[1:02:26] [Music]
[1:02:29] I'm talking about Green Pastures that
[1:02:31] God has provided
[1:02:33] a sustaining strength for a Rapture at
[1:02:36] hand
[1:02:38] a food that will build rapturing Faith a
[1:02:40] food that brings about that perfect love
[1:02:43] not not human love
[1:02:45] perfect love
[1:02:47] God love
[1:02:48] it's a food that that strengthens our
[1:02:52] faith
[1:02:54] the Bible says that that Abraham got
[1:02:57] stronger in faith
[1:03:00] he considered not the body of uh the the
[1:03:03] deadness of Sarah's womb
[1:03:05] he considered not his own body being
[1:03:08] dead
[1:03:09] getting weaker and weaker and weaker
[1:03:11] more frail all the time he just kept
[1:03:15] nursing off the promise
[1:03:19] now he had only one promise to nurse
[1:03:21] from when we've got an open book to eat
[1:03:23] from
[1:03:25] and as we're eating of this open book
[1:03:29] we're getting stronger
[1:03:32] we're being able to defy the enemy that
[1:03:35] comes our way every demon of hell that
[1:03:37] we used to be scared of now we're
[1:03:39] looking at them
[1:03:41] Square in the eye
[1:03:44] and we're bringing them down by The Sith
[1:03:46] the Lord because we're nursing or we're
[1:03:48] eating out of an open book
