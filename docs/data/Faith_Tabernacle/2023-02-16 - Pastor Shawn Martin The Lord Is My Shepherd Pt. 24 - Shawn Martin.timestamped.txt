[22:22] to do it uh in the evening or afternoon
[22:24] so amen but um before we go into the
[22:29] word let's just bow our hearts and heads
[22:32] to the Lord and just talk to him

[22:40] grateful hearts

[23:06] expectation to meet with you
[23:08] and father we're just asking that you
[23:11] would take what simple words we would

[23:28] pray that you would touch them is our
[23:31] prayer we give you all praise and glory
[23:34] in Jesus Christ's name
[23:37] amen
[23:39] Psalms the 23rd chapter
[23:42] starting at the first verse the Lord is
[23:45] my shepherd
[23:46] I shall not mourn
[23:49] he maketh me to lie down in Green
[23:52] Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still
[23:54] Waters
[23:56] he restoreth my soul
[23:59] he leads me in the paths of
[24:01] righteousness
[24:02] for his name's sake
[24:06] amen
[24:07] you can have your seats this evening and
[24:11] I want to just continue with the title
[24:16] the Lord is my shepherd and looking at
[24:19] that where psalmist said he leads me in
[24:24] the paths of righteousness and as as
[24:27] we've talked about that the the
[24:30] righteousness is the word of God
[24:35] and the Lord
[24:38] Our Shepherd our guide is leading Us in
[24:42] the paths of his word
[24:45] for he leads me in the paths of
[24:48] righteousness
[24:49] and so as we we talked uh last Wednesday
[24:53] the elect of God
[24:55] uh need a guide we need a guide to walk
[24:58] this path because we have never passed
[25:03] this way before
[25:04] and we've talked about how that God had
[25:08] ordered ordained Joshua to lead the
[25:12] children of Israel over into the land of
[25:15] promise
[25:16] and and you know Moses now
[25:21] um Moses
[25:23] um
[25:24] God had sent him
[25:26] uh uh down with the power of Jehovah and
[25:31] with the message
[25:33] uh saying come out you know return from
[25:37] this land
[25:42] message was to come from this land and
[25:46] let's go to the Homeland and so that
[25:49] that was the message that Moses had and
[25:51] and now when I'm I'm looking at these
[25:55] Paths of righteousness he leadeth me
[25:57] into in the paths of righteous this I'm
[26:00] I'm looking at it as the second part of
[26:03] redemption it's it's it's the Redemption
[26:07] and and so Moses dealt with the first
[26:09] part of redemption and that was to come
[26:11] out uh uh there and uh but then God sent
[26:17] Joshua uh with a message of Grace
[26:22] and that to deal with the second part of
[26:26] redemption and that was to come into it
[26:29] was it was going into so two Ministries
[26:32] but yet I believe that brother branham's
[26:36] Ministry actually fulfilled both of
[26:39] those Ministries uh uh there and and
[26:43] Moses and Joshua for uh we've heard the
[26:47] voice say come out of her my people amen
[26:51] and and we wouldn't have come out uh uh
[26:54] if it had not been for the message of
[26:57] the hour so it was the message that
[27:00] brought us out a man of our Creeds and
[27:03] out of the world and out of dogmas and
[27:06] and all of these things ain't that right
[27:08] another thing we look at that we're
[27:11] living in the evening time and it was in
[27:14] the evening time that the token was
[27:17] required amen for E for Israel and God
[27:21] told Moses now when I see the blood I
[27:24] will pass over you ain't that right so
[27:28] so it was it was the ministry of as as
[27:32] uh coming out it it there was a token a
[27:36] man that was required and that Tolkien
[27:39] had to be on display and and we realize
[27:42] that the prophet said that this is in
[27:45] this evening time it's the token that
[27:48] God is requiring a man to be on display
[27:51] and it's not the the the literal blood
[27:55] of a lamb but it's the life now they had
[27:58] to have the literal blood of the Lamb
[28:01] because the the life of that animal a
[28:04] man could not come back upon the
[28:06] believer but in this age we've had the
[28:09] true Lamb of God and and and and and and
[28:13] so we're we're not required to have the
[28:15] literal blood but we are required to
[28:18] have the life a man uh and and that's
[28:22] the life of Christ and he is the word
[28:25] ain't that right so the token man is the
[28:29] word living itself out in you and I for
[28:33] that is the display of of the token and
[28:37] and the prophet said when we can display
[28:39] the token that's the word and we become
[28:43] the same it shows that Jesus Christ met
[28:47] their requirement for our sin and death
[28:50] and his has displayed his token within
[28:53] us ain't that right so he says when God
[28:57] places his spirit in you which is God
[29:00] and when God places himself within you
[29:03] you are as Eternal as God is because
[29:07] you're a part of him because you become
[29:10] a son or a daughter of God and you are
[29:13] displaying his word you're not quoting
[29:16] his word you're displaying his word his
[29:19] word is now living inside of you ain't
[29:22] that right so he says see that he says
[29:25] hallelujah I feel religious that's true
[29:28] God identifies it himself you've got
[29:31] eternal life and that's God in you and
[29:34] this word is God and that word lives and
[29:39] produces itself see just exactly what
[29:42] God has ordained for this age you have
[29:46] it amen the Holy Ghost see and and so
[29:51] um he says uh the holy spirit being
[29:53] displayed and what is it the Holy Spirit
[29:56] the word has been quickened to you by
[30:01] the Holy Spirit to vindicate this age
[30:03] that you have passed from Death unto
[30:06] life amen so again uh the token the uh
[30:10] uh uh the token is Christ as we we
[30:14] believe that to be so and Christ is the
[30:17] word made manifest for the promise of
[30:20] this age the promise of this hour must
[30:23] be manifest and and the prophet would
[30:26] tell us again in another place they
[30:28] evening time message is to apply the
[30:31] token ain't that rhyme amen so we can
[30:34] see how his message a man uh dovetails
[30:37] with Moses's message Amen brother Brown
[30:40] said take the message take the message
[30:42] and take it into your heart that you
[30:46] must have the token the very life that
[30:49] was in Christ being you when I see that
[30:52] I will pass over you ain't that right so
[30:56] we needed this message just as they
[30:58] needed Moses's Ministry in in uh before
[31:03] uh uh they they left because spiritual
[31:06] or death natural death was striking the
[31:09] lamb fixing to strike and so it would
[31:12] strike every firstborn it didn't matter
[31:14] who you were if the token hadn't been
[31:17] applied a man death would come knocking
[31:20] amen but when the token was applied
[31:22] death had to pass this this went went on
[31:26] its way it lost its old it's lost its
[31:28] power hour over that home that had the
[31:31] token that life that had the token but
[31:33] in this day we see that spiritual death
[31:35] is going throughout the land and so when
[31:39] I see the blood or when I see the word
[31:42] manifesting itself a man through you I
[31:46] will pass over you ain't that right amen
[31:49] but we also see how brother branham's
[31:51] Ministry fits with the ministry of
[31:54] Joshua a man for he was the one who took
[31:57] Israel across Jordan into the promised
[32:01] land amen and and many of us uh no doubt
[32:04] have have listened to the message
[32:06] Paradox in 62 I believe it is and and
[32:10] brother Branham talked about the the
[32:12] vision that he had uh uh now now he was
[32:15] you know the uh um uh he had this at
[32:20] three o'clock in the morning and he said
[32:22] I got up and I looked at where in front
[32:24] of me and I was coming down to the
[32:26] Jordan looked like I was standing ending
[32:28] on the map of Palestine and I coming to
[32:31] Jordan and seemed like I could hear the
[32:33] song I'm going down to Jordan someone
[32:36] was singing and as I drew near I looked
[32:39] back and seen which way I had come and I
[32:42] was two-thirds of the way there to
[32:45] Jordan meaning that he had already come
[32:49] in into the first two pulls the first
[32:53] second pull of his ministry he had
[32:56] already come through there now he's at
[32:58] Jordan amen and he's seeing this in a
[33:00] vision and he says I I I was there and I
[33:05] at Jordan and I looked across Jordan and
[33:08] I said oh praise God just on the other
[33:11] side is where all the promises lay every
[33:16] promise lays in the promised land ain't
[33:19] that right which he was referring to
[33:21] that third pool Ministry every promise
[33:25] laid right right there see and so and in
[33:29] the same message following that
[33:31] statement just a little bit on down uh
[33:34] brother Branham said years ago when I
[33:36] saw seen the Bible come down he said I
[33:39] got it wrote right here come down and a
[33:41] hand came from heaven and pointed down
[33:43] to Joshua and read the first nine verses
[33:46] and stopped there that's Joshua come to
[33:49] the Wilderness but never did he said
[33:51] when he got near Jordan God called him
[33:54] out and said this day I'll begin to
[33:57] magnify you before the people and then
[34:00] he took the children of Israel across
[34:03] Jordan to the land where gay he gave
[34:06] them or divided to them the promised
[34:09] land amen so that was the ministry of
[34:11] Joshua amen it it it uh to divide to
[34:16] them their inheritance the people had
[34:18] come out a man under the token amen and
[34:22] now they they were coming into the
[34:24] promised land a man and so another time
[34:28] I'm brother Branham
[34:30] um was talked about the time that the
[34:32] angel of the Lord visited him and showed
[34:35] him different things and and he said
[34:38] this he said I raised up and looked
[34:40] around and I heard something the leaves
[34:42] turning and I looked and here come my
[34:44] Bible write down and it was turned to
[34:48] the uh uh the same scripture where I
[34:51] read tonight and then it was turning
[34:54] back uh towards the front of the Bible
[34:57] and as it turned towards the front part
[35:00] I it stopped on Joshua the first chapter
[35:04] and the finger began to read down and
[35:07] point down along the lines the Lord thy
[35:10] God is with thee wherever thou goest no
[35:13] man shall stand before thee all the days
[35:16] of the life as I was with Moses so will
[35:19] I be with thee be very courageous ain't
[35:22] that right and so forth like that till
[35:24] it read down most of the chapter of of
[35:26] Joshua chapter 1 one then it went away
[35:29] see so God was showing him showing
[35:33] brother Branham that his ministry would
[35:35] be the the just like the Joshua Ministry
[35:38] a man and and so uh again I believe that
[35:43] all the promises lay in in the third
[35:46] pool ain't that right the third pull
[35:48] Ministry and and so what is the third
[35:51] pull and and brother Branham talked
[35:54] about it in different places but in one
[35:56] place he said the third pool is the
[35:59] opening of the word ain't that right the
[36:02] opening of the word the Mysteries
[36:05] revealed amen so that that that is where
[36:09] the promises lay is in the opening of
[36:12] the word the Mysteries revealed and he
[36:15] said there is no more higher order to
[36:17] reveal the word than the prophets but
[36:19] the only way that the prophet can be
[36:21] Vindicated is by the word and remember
[36:24] the third pull was the opening of them
[36:28] Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth
[36:31] that's been sealed in the word of God
[36:34] ain't that right every promise had been
[36:37] sealed a man in the word of God that hid
[36:41] the third pool was the opening of them
[36:44] promises revealing of the promises of
[36:47] God now Moses did not reveal the the
[36:50] mystery that had been hidden and we we
[36:53] understand that that the the uh uh uh
[36:57] brother Brown talks about every tribe
[36:58] them men amen as they were babies or
[37:02] being born uh mom under the the travail
[37:06] would cry out their name Ephraim and and
[37:09] and uh manesses and and and this went in
[37:13] and and brother Rams says their name was
[37:16] actually the meaning of their name was
[37:19] actually placing them in the promised
[37:21] land he ferment oil or something to that
[37:24] effect and the other one meant corn
[37:26] razor and another one meant is and
[37:28] another meant that well them men didn't
[37:30] know and I don't even think their
[37:32] mothers knew but they said it under
[37:34] inspiration see and so Moses didn't
[37:37] reveal what their names meant amen
[37:40] because that wasn't his ministry But
[37:42] Here Comes Joshua under the ministry of
[37:45] Grace takes them over into the land amen
[37:49] and under the inspiration of the Holy
[37:52] Ghost the spirit of Truth amen he began
[37:55] to divide the land and reveal to them a
[37:58] man that they were part of the land can
[38:00] you say amen amen that their names amen
[38:03] and he positionally placed them and so
[38:06] if you notice we had read last Wednesday
[38:08] of how that the Levites Who Bore the art
[38:12] of the Covenant which was the word the
[38:15] Ark of the Covenant amen they bore it
[38:17] upon their shoulders the word amen and
[38:20] yet they were directed by Joshua ain't
[38:24] that right a man sold their headship was
[38:27] Joshua amen and the people were told to
[38:30] stay behind the word don't go in front
[38:33] of it but stay behind it don't get too
[38:36] close don't you try to lead the word
[38:37] amen but you stay behind the word and
[38:40] let the word Lead You amen so here was
[38:43] the ministry a man which I believe that
[38:46] the fightful ministry amen the Levites
[38:48] bearing that that Ark a man represented
[38:51] the fifo ministry under the direction
[38:53] amen of the of the messenger of today
[38:57] amen and and so uh we are being led
[39:01] today in the paths of righteousness
[39:03] under the Joshua Ministry amen see the
[39:07] the the ministry of law a man
[39:10] condemnation and and these things cannot
[39:14] lead us into it for the land deals a man
[39:18] with what was in the mind of God before
[39:20] the foundation of the world Amen these
[39:23] Paths of righteousness deals a man with
[39:26] with what God had ordained before the
[39:30] world began and law a man cannot deal
[39:32] with predestination law cannot deal with
[39:36] them things because it it only dealt
[39:39] with you as a sinner amen as long as
[39:42] you've done right amen the law was there
[39:44] but as soon as you done wrong amen it
[39:47] condemned you ain't that right amen so
[39:50] the ministry today is under the the uh
[39:54] that are carrying the word is under the
[39:56] direction of Joshua amen now brother
[39:59] Branham Likens the pastors as The
[40:01] Innkeeper that was entrusted by the Good
[40:04] Samaritan to take uh care of the man
[40:08] that was beaten remember Jesus talks
[40:10] about the the Samaritan uh that takes
[40:12] that man that was robbed and beaten and
[40:15] and he took him to an end and left him
[40:17] there Amen to be taken care of and the
[40:20] prophet said they are defeat you and to
[40:22] Shepherd you until Jesus comes they they
[40:25] they're the caretaker at the end again
[40:28] see and so he said Jesus give them two
[40:32] pins
[40:33] the word and the spirit ain't that right
[40:36] if they need any more he will give it
[40:38] when he returns amen so that the Levites
[40:42] who carried the word of God upon their
[40:45] shoulders a man noticed they had to
[40:47] stand in the River Jordan amen first the
[40:51] people could not go in amen until the
[40:54] ministry amen went in there and uh
[40:57] before the people could cross over and
[41:00] and so uh uh which tells me because
[41:03] Jordan represents death and and and and
[41:06] you just have to allow me but I believe
[41:08] that it's a sign that the ministry a man
[41:12] that is carrying the word today amen
[41:14] under the Joshua Ministry has to first
[41:17] die out to their ways and die out to
[41:20] their thoughts and die out to their
[41:22] Creeds and their dogmas and and all of
[41:24] these things that they're going to take
[41:26] amen the word of God for this age amen
[41:29] die Elsie and so and they came to Jordan
[41:32] at the time when when the waters was
[41:35] overflowing their Banks and but yet when
[41:38] the priest walked into that that that
[41:41] water a miracle took place and that was
[41:45] that the waters rode back a man so that
[41:48] the people could cross into the land uh
[41:51] without any interference can you say
[41:54] amen amen as long as the priests were
[41:57] standing there in that water amen the
[42:00] people could go over into the promised
[42:03] land a man see and the prophet said
[42:06] Joshua delivered the people into the
[42:10] promised land amen I love that amen he
[42:13] just didn't take him over he delivered
[42:16] them into the promised land the you know
[42:18] the prophet had way with words amen and
[42:21] and he knew you know just God knew what
[42:24] he was saying there amen and I just
[42:26] believe that the people that are going
[42:28] across into the promised land ain't
[42:31] there by chance they ain't there by Will
[42:33] hour it was a Deliverance amen that God
[42:37] in this age the message of the hour
[42:39] would deliver them into the promised
[42:43] land ain't that right so we as the elect
[42:46] of God Amen are in the land of the open
[42:50] book amen uh uh that that's where we're
[42:53] at we are that third pool is working in
[42:56] this age a man for it is the opening of
[42:59] the word ain't that right our
[43:01] understanding is not coming from a
[43:04] psychologist or from a theologian or
[43:06] understanding is coming from a third
[43:09] pool Ministry a man that is lit us amen
[43:13] into the land of promises amen see so
[43:17] what what what that means then is we're
[43:20] in the land and we are seeing we are
[43:23] understanding things amen that have been
[43:26] hid from the foundation of the world you
[43:28] are the most privileged people Amen to
[43:31] Faith amen that in this age amen that
[43:34] you're understanding things that the
[43:36] angels of God have longed to see you are
[43:40] seeing things and hearing things and
[43:42] understanding things that the prophets
[43:44] long to understand hey oh my amen I know
[43:48] people say well you know brother Branham
[43:50] just uh there's nothing anything new and
[43:52] and and they understood it in the first
[43:54] church age I beg to differ with you amen
[43:57] now Paul talked about a Rapture but he
[43:59] talked about it in a mystery form amen
[44:02] he said yes amen the Lord shall descend
[44:04] with the shout but we didn't know what
[44:05] that child was amen we didn't know what
[44:07] the voice of the Trump was we didn't
[44:09] know what the voice of the Archangel was
[44:12] amen until in this age right here do you
[44:16] believe that amen we didn't understand
[44:18] the things that amen that that Paul it
[44:21] was talking because he was talking to
[44:23] things a man that would be later on in
[44:26] the land uh the third pool Ministry
[44:29] would be revealed and opened up to the
[44:31] bride of Christ amen so oh to think of
[44:34] it we're in the land of promise amen the
[44:37] mind of God is no longer hidden to the
[44:40] people of God by the opening of the word
[44:43] ain't that right amen that's right I I
[44:45] just think that is awesome I thank God
[44:48] for allowing us to be right here I'm I'm
[44:50] so thankful to be in the age that I'm
[44:52] living in it would have been nice yes to
[44:55] be in the age where Jesus walked the
[44:56] Earth but still we wouldn't even have
[44:58] the understanding that we have today hey
[45:02] oh my because we are in the second part
[45:05] of redemption amen see so everything
[45:09] that has been promised a man of this
[45:11] bride is now to be not only understood
[45:15] but to be manifested amen yes sir so as
[45:19] Jesus told John it becomes us to fulfill
[45:23] all righteousness and remember uh uh uh
[45:27] Jesus came to the river to be baptized
[45:29] to John and I'm going somewhere so just
[45:32] follow me now but he needed to be
[45:34] baptized for a different reason than
[45:37] what we need to ain't that right you
[45:39] know we are baptized for the remission
[45:41] of sins amen John baptized unto
[45:44] repentance but see we we find a man that
[45:48] Jesus had no sin for he was the Spotless
[45:51] Lamb of God Amen so he wasn't there to
[45:54] be baptized to have his sins washed away
[45:57] ain't that right amen but yet he needed
[46:00] to be baptized and the and Jesus said it
[46:04] was to fulfill all righteousness amen
[46:07] that's why he had to be baptized it had
[46:10] to fulfill all righteousness not one
[46:13] scripture could be misplaced not one
[46:15] scripture could go without being
[46:17] fulfilled in his life every scripture
[46:20] that talked of him prophesied of him had
[46:24] to be fulfilled ain't that right so the
[46:26] word had to be fulfilled you see the
[46:29] prophet said God cannot say anything
[46:31] without it being fulfilled and God had
[46:34] already spoke of Jesus and foretold what
[46:37] he would be and what he would do when he
[46:40] came ain't that right and and the
[46:42] prophet said this when God has spoken it
[46:45] then is already a finished work amen now
[46:49] you think of that oh I wish I could get
[46:51] that to us all amen that when God has
[46:53] spoken it now becomes a finished work
[46:56] amen Jesus wasn't trying to make things
[46:59] happen it was already spoken of him for
[47:02] it to happen amen he just had to walk in
[47:04] the path amen of righteousness he had
[47:07] just a walk in the path of the word
[47:09] ain't that right amen but it was already
[47:12] spoken of him amen so it was already a
[47:15] finished work amen as we have read many
[47:17] times Isaiah 55 and 11 and so shall my
[47:22] word be that going forth out of my mouth
[47:24] it shall not return unto me void amen
[47:28] but it shall accomplish that which I
[47:31] please and it shall pray prosper in the
[47:34] thing where to I sin it ain't that right
[47:37] so every thing that God has said it's
[47:39] already a finished work
[47:44] uh uh before the beginning or from the
[47:47] beginning of of creation a man see so
[47:51] the prophet said when we receive the
[47:53] word into our heart it's already done
[47:56] it's already completed ain't that right
[47:59] amen so we're not struggling here
[48:02] tonight amen you're not struggling to be
[48:04] going to Rapture you're not struggling
[48:06] to come into manifestations of sons of
[48:08] God you're not struggling to these
[48:10] things it's already been said by God and
[48:14] it's a finished work
[48:16] I think that's awesome
[48:19] ain't that right it's awesome hey man so
[48:23] why did Jesus then have to be baptized
[48:25] amen well the prophet said he was the
[48:27] high priest and and he he he had to be
[48:31] anointed but before he could be anointed
[48:34] he had to be washed ain't that right
[48:37] we've read this before I'm going to read
[48:39] it again Exodus 29 and 4 and Aaron and
[48:42] his sons Thou shalt bring unto the door
[48:45] of the Tabernacle of the congregation
[48:47] and shalt wash them with water Aaron and
[48:52] his sons and thou shalt take the
[48:54] garments and put upon Aaron the cold and
[48:57] the robe of the ephod and the ephod and
[49:00] the uh the breastplate and gird him with
[49:03] the Curious girdle of the ephod and and
[49:06] doubt shall put the miter on him upon
[49:09] his head and put the holy crown upon the
[49:11] miter then Thou shalt take the anointing
[49:15] and pour it upon his head and anoint him
[49:18] ain't that right that so we find in
[49:21] Matthew 16 or 3 and 16 and Jesus when he
[49:25] was baptized washed amen went up
[49:28] straight way out of the water and lo the
[49:30] heavens were opened unto him and he saw
[49:33] the spirit of God descending like a dove
[49:37] and lighting upon him see that anointing
[49:40] came to him after he was washed but it
[49:42] would have never happened if the
[49:44] scripture hadn't been fulfilled amen he
[49:47] was there to fulfill the scriptures
[49:49] ain't that right he was anointed and
[49:52] later on Jesus would say the spirit of
[49:55] the Lord is upon me for he hath anointed
[49:59] me ain't that right so then the prophet
[50:03] says that as priests unto our God now
[50:06] speaking to us we must first confess our
[50:09] sins and be baptized in the name of
[50:11] Jesus Christ and as the prophet said
[50:14] what is it it's washing our sins away
[50:17] we've got as Priests of God we have to
[50:20] be washed as well a man say then you
[50:24] shall receive the anointing of the Holy
[50:27] Ghost the gift of the Holy Ghost and we
[50:30] can say it becometh us to fulfill all
[50:34] righteousness ain't that right so we see
[50:37] that Jesus fulfilled the Old Testament
[50:39] and and uh the prophet said all the Old
[50:43] Testament characters represented this
[50:46] the Messiah until it was all fulfilled
[50:50] in one man so so David represented the
[50:53] Messiah Samson represented the Messiah
[50:56] amen uh uh uh Moses represented the
[51:00] Messiah Joshua and and all of the the
[51:04] Saints of old when that anointing would
[51:06] come and the acts that they'd done and
[51:08] and these things they represented amen
[51:11] the Messiah their lives their testimony
[51:13] their their words everything about them
[51:17] represented the Messiah amen and until
[51:20] it was all bottled up into one man
[51:23] hallelujah amen see and he fulfilled
[51:27] every part of the Old Testament that
[51:30] spoke of the Messiah amen what David
[51:33] lived out he fulfilled what Joseph lived
[51:36] out he fulfilled amen everything that
[51:38] they lived down under that anointing he
[51:41] fulfilled ain't that right even to the
[51:44] fact of David going up on the mountain
[51:46] and crying over Jerusalem amen rejected
[51:49] as a king and here later on at the real
[51:52] David the king amen David amen Dairy was
[51:56] sitting on the hill just as David did
[51:58] and crying over Jerusalem a rejected
[52:02] amen King ain't that right amen but as
[52:06] he fulfilled the Old Testament now amen
[52:08] the New Testament has got to be
[52:11] fulfilled if brother Brown said it's
[52:13] another piece to be fulfilled ain't that
[52:15] rhyme amen so Jesus was God's master
[52:19] Beast that fulfilled all righteousness
[52:21] that spoke of him in the Old Testament
[52:24] and he says as it taken him 4 000 years
[52:28] to make this masterpiece now he's been
[52:32] nearly 2 000 years making another
[52:35] Masterpiece a bride for Christ another
[52:38] Masterpiece and in so doing it now
[52:41] listen he does it by his never changing
[52:45] method the same way made the Masterpiece
[52:48] his word ain't that right that's the way
[52:50] he makes his masterpieces because he can
[52:53] only be a perfect Masterpiece when it's
[52:57] the perfect word no Creeds mixed into it
[53:01] no ideas of man tradition it must be
[53:04] perfect word ain't that right and he
[53:07] said his bride will fulfill everything
[53:10] amen that's in the New Testament whole
[53:13] mind to think that's where we're at
[53:15] tonight we are now at the Finishing
[53:18] Touch of the Masterpiece amen why how do
[53:22] we know that because the Capstone
[53:24] himself has come down to finish her off
[53:28] ain't that run so you know what that
[53:30] means then then we are becoming word
[53:33] word by word word by word flesh of his
[53:36] flesh bone of his bone life of his life
[53:39] power of his power she is him him what
[53:43] the word ain't that right now we find
[53:46] that Satan has his bride as well and the
[53:49] prophet said this bride is made up in
[53:52] the form of religion called Creeds and
[53:54] dogmas and and he calls Satan's bride
[53:57] the false uh uh Vine and it's in this
[54:01] age now that this false bride Satan's
[54:04] bride comes into full fruition amen the
[54:09] full fruition her fruit is maturing and
[54:12] ripening he says this evil spirited
[54:15] Church full of iniquity will be revealed
[54:19] as the mustard seed that grew into a
[54:22] tree where enlarged the fowls of the air
[54:26] and at her head will be the Antichrist
[54:30] the mystery of iniquity ain't that right
[54:34] and what is Iniquity knowing to what to
[54:37] do Ryan and yet not doing it ain't that
[54:39] right no to do good and yet not do it
[54:42] and so here at the head of her amen uh
[54:47] this bride Satan's bride will be the
[54:50] mystery of iniquity amen but notice what
[54:53] he says after that God's children
[54:54] everybody say God's children is made up
[54:58] correctly on his word amen see for they
[55:02] are living examples and the word of God
[55:06] Amen living through them amen and it's
[55:10] also in this age that the true bride of
[55:13] Christ will come to her maturity as well
[55:17] the prophet said her rightness shall be
[55:20] an identification with the Lord by means
[55:24] of the word and her head who will come
[55:28] to her is the mystery of godliness not
[55:31] iniquity but the mystery of godliness
[55:35] will be her headship which is Christ
[55:39] ain't that right so we see that that
[55:43] we're living now it's the word the word
[55:45] amen the prophet said as she nears The
[55:48] Headstone which is Christ she becomes
[55:51] like him through the word and Jesus will
[55:55] come that she the bride and him the
[55:59] groom may be United forever as one oh I
[56:04] hope you understand the vision
[56:07] that God has in this age is for you as
[56:11] the Church of the Living God to become
[56:13] one amen and that is power of his power
[56:17] life of his life word of his word amen
[56:20] to where you become him ain't that right
[56:22] so so we fine now now notice what the
[56:26] prophet says about the false and the
[56:28] true he said as the false church with
[56:31] all cunning and diabolical uh uh Power
[56:35] made uh made up of political force
[56:39] physical force and demons of Darkness
[56:42] come against this true bro this True
[56:44] Vine so the false church will come
[56:48] against the the True Vine and we're
[56:50] seeing it happen right now amen the laws
[56:53] are being passed everything is being
[56:55] passed amen and it's it's directed Amen
[56:59] to stomp out the Church of the Living
[57:01] God Amen but notice what the prophet
[57:03] said the True Vine with the fullness of
[57:06] the spirit and the word will do the very
[57:09] acts of power that Jesus did amen see
[57:13] that that's what he's saying of this
[57:14] bride today she will amen she will with
[57:18] the full power of God do the very works
[57:21] that Jesus did so I say to you it
[57:24] becometh us to fulfill all righteousness
[57:27] ain't that right amen the Bible has
[57:29] already promised it amen of all the
[57:32] things that we see of the mighty acts
[57:34] amen that was done in the Bible I
[57:36] believe it not only spoke of Christ I
[57:39] believe it spoke of this age here amen
[57:41] because it's it's not this not you
[57:43] that's doing it it's Christ in you
[57:46] that's doing it ain't that right amen
[57:49] the prophet said he did not do
[57:51] everything amen uh uh uh uh when he was
[57:55] here on Earth there was other things
[57:56] that had to do and what would he do it
[57:59] he would do it not in that body he would
[58:02] do it in your body
[58:04] amen that's right now all of God's word
[58:07] must be fulfilled do you believe that
[58:09] amen so we're not taking these promises
[58:12] lightly amen we know we understand amen
[58:15] that all of God's word must be fulfilled
[58:18] oh my and we're looking now into the
[58:21] promised land the opening of the word
[58:23] and we're seeing these promises now made
[58:26] life amen we're seeing that they've been
[58:28] laying dormant for our day and age we're
[58:31] seeing that no other age could fulfill
[58:33] it but this age that is right here amen
[58:36] now Jesus was the word do you believe
[58:39] that amen and notice what he said he
[58:42] told him search the scriptures search
[58:44] the words scriptures written word for in
[58:47] them you think you have eternal life but
[58:48] this written word testifies of who I am
[58:51] so and now we're standing here
[58:53] understanding this word actually
[58:55] testifies of Who We Are
[58:59] it testifies of it because we are a word
[59:02] bride
[59:03] ain't that right so the prophet said the
[59:07] word must deliver the word bride Church
[59:10] amen that's where you're at right now
[59:12] the word has delivered a wordbride
[59:15] church I believe not must I believe she
[59:18] has
[59:19] I believe this word I believe this
[59:21] message that's what we are you young
[59:23] people are a product of the message of
[59:25] the hour yes sir not some denomination
[59:28] not some traditional idea but the
[59:31] message of the hour and notice the
[59:33] prophet said she's fixing to bring forth
[59:35] the perfect word back there and the word
[59:37] is coming for the word bride now we all
[59:40] know that the Rapture is at imminent I
[59:42] mean it's it's here amen Rush is coming
[59:45] to her place every nation is coming to
[59:48] their place politics and religions and
[59:50] everything of this world is coming right
[59:52] to their place now church if that be the
[59:55] case then I believe that this word bride
[59:57] is on the Earth today I believe that
[1:00:00] she's ready to be raptured out of here
[1:00:04] for he's coming the word is coming for
[1:00:06] the word bride
[1:00:08] a woman see as a woman is part of the of
[1:00:11] the man taken from him so the church
[1:00:14] will have to be a word a word biting
[1:00:17] church can you say that with me we'll
[1:00:19] have to be
[1:00:20] a word abiding church that's why we take
[1:00:24] this message very seriously that's why
[1:00:27] we believe the word of it can you say
[1:00:29] amen that's why we don't we I I don't
[1:00:32] want to ever confuse you a man and God
[1:00:35] forbid that any minister in this church
[1:00:37] would confuse you Amen to tell you that
[1:00:39] this is part of brother branham's
[1:00:41] opinion and this and start picking this
[1:00:43] thing apart amen look at the promises
[1:00:46] look at the ministry amen this is a
[1:00:49] Joshua Ministry can you say amen amen it
[1:00:52] is the open book amen amen I know they
[1:00:56] say well if it's not in the Bible then
[1:00:59] then then then that's just brother
[1:01:01] branham's opinion whatever he says if
[1:01:03] it's not there then that's just brother
[1:01:04] brother branham's opinion and who are
[1:01:07] you old blind man a man that can look at
[1:01:10] the scripture and tell me where brother
[1:01:11] Branham was wrong can you say amen amen
[1:01:15] I can tell you this amen I would rather
[1:01:17] Sean Martin to just to say Sean Martin
[1:01:20] is wrong than to say a prophet of God is
[1:01:22] wrong that way I could be corrected that
[1:01:24] way amen I can repent ain't that right
[1:01:27] amen but when I've come to know it all
[1:01:29] when I've come to know more than what
[1:01:31] the prophet says that I've set myself as
[1:01:33] the standard for everybody to believe
[1:01:35] amen then something's wrong amen
[1:01:38] received the church will have to be a
[1:01:41] word abiding church every word of this
[1:01:44] Bible can you say Amen every word of
[1:01:48] this Bible That's why why would god
[1:01:50] require us to be a word bride in this
[1:01:53] age and that's all he's coming for is a
[1:01:56] word church and then not give us the
[1:01:58] promises not open these Mysteries up to
[1:02:00] us and we don't know what is us and we
[1:02:03] don't know what to fulfill and we don't
[1:02:04] know but we're in the land of the open
[1:02:07] book where we could take every promise
[1:02:10] and say that's mine
[1:02:14] he's leading us
[1:02:16] in the paths of righteousness
[1:02:19] see so he says see the church will have
[1:02:22] to be a word biting church every word of
[1:02:24] the Bible not systems dogmas nothing
[1:02:26] added to it it'll have to be uh in an
[1:02:30] unadulterated pure virgin word amen so
[1:02:34] that's what this bride is she is a
[1:02:37] virgin word unto him
[1:02:39] virgin bride unto him now we talked
[1:02:43] about it amen to thank now amen because
[1:02:46] you got to know your day amen and and we
[1:02:49] we find that God planted a Pentecostal
[1:02:52] seed remember on the day of Pentecost
[1:02:54] and then that seed went into the ground
[1:02:57] at nicaea amen and then we find the
[1:03:00] prophet taught us that the life that was
[1:03:02] in that seed amen began to manifest
[1:03:05] itself Amen in Luther's age and brother
[1:03:08] Brown shows us that the church has gone
[1:03:11] through three stages amen three stages
[1:03:15] of growth just like the corn of wheat
[1:03:17] the stock the tassel and the shuck ain't
[1:03:20] that right amen now thank God for a
[1:03:23] Joshua Ministry that we couldn't know
[1:03:26] where we're at ain't that right amen see
[1:03:29] we are not the tussle neither are we the
[1:03:33] stock and neither are we the shock ain't
[1:03:37] that right amen see we are the seed amen
[1:03:42] like was planted in the ground amen and
[1:03:45] notice what the prophet said the shock
[1:03:48] has give forth its strength into the
[1:03:51] seed it's went on out it was a good shut
[1:03:54] but it served its time see it is the
[1:03:59] word Bride of the word groom amen that's
[1:04:02] where we're at what are we we are the
[1:04:05] Masterpiece just like he was
[1:04:09] Hallelujah
[1:04:11] that's why we could say it becomes us to
[1:04:13] fulfill all righteousness
[1:04:15] amen he says see the Shucks have to dry
[1:04:18] the pollen has to dry everything dies so
[1:04:23] that the seed can produce itself
[1:04:26] amen the thing that God would choose you
[1:04:30] to reflect his full power in in this age
[1:04:36] I think that's powerful
[1:04:38] amen now notice brother Brown says the
[1:04:41] little virgin word flock bride
[1:04:44] of Christ don't care for Satan's
[1:04:46] knowledge
[1:04:48] we don't care for his knowledge I don't
[1:04:51] care what Technology's got I don't care
[1:04:54] what science comes up with the medical
[1:04:55] field and all these things that that
[1:04:58] doesn't move us
[1:04:59] we don't care for Satan's knowledge
[1:05:02] amen the seminaries and the theologians
[1:05:05] and all of that that's that that we
[1:05:07] don't care for that amen you know uh uh
[1:05:11] sometimes just to be honest listening to
[1:05:13] them the radio preachers and and their
[1:05:16] theologies and all that it just turns my
[1:05:18] stomach amen I'm just that's that's not
[1:05:21] where I'm at that's not what I want that
[1:05:23] goes that doesn't help me you understand
[1:05:25] what I'm saying amen we don't care for
[1:05:28] Satan's knowledge brother Brown said she
[1:05:30] the bride keeps free from him amen we're
[1:05:34] not going to be entangled by his his
[1:05:36] nonsense we we we've been cut out from
[1:05:39] all of that you understand what I'm
[1:05:41] saying amen we we didn't hear the voice
[1:05:44] come out of her my people only to keep
[1:05:46] giving an ear to that amen give your ear
[1:05:49] to the message of this hour
[1:05:52] that's what you give ear to
[1:05:54] brother Brown said she waits for her
[1:05:56] Lord and his Millennium honeymoon right
[1:05:59] with the word groom as she is the word
[1:06:03] bride
[1:06:04] that's what you are you are the word
[1:06:07] bride as he was the word groom
[1:06:11] ain't that right and what is the word
[1:06:14] bride the prophet said the manifestation
[1:06:16] of this hour
[1:06:18] she is a living Oracle of God a living
[1:06:22] attribute of God displaying to the world
[1:06:25] the attributes of God in the formation
[1:06:28] of the Bride that's to be expressed in
[1:06:30] this hour that we're now living all to
[1:06:33] think that it's already been written of
[1:06:35] us that this is what we will do that we
[1:06:38] will come to the the fullness of him
[1:06:40] once again remember that's what Paul
[1:06:42] said did he not he talked about the
[1:06:44] church which is his body the fullness of
[1:06:47] him that feeleth all in all
[1:06:51] see so he leads us he leads me in the
[1:06:55] paths of righteousness
[1:06:57] you think of Jesus and John brother
[1:06:59] Brown talking about it and it becometh
[1:07:01] us to fulfill all righteousness he said
[1:07:04] they were the light for their age so it
[1:07:06] was up to them it was up to them nobody
[1:07:08] was going to do it it was up to them to
[1:07:10] fulfill the righteousness they were the
[1:07:13] lights of the age can you say amen
[1:07:14] that's right see and brother Brown said
[1:07:17] the light of every age should do the
[1:07:19] same thing you are the lights of this
[1:07:21] age no one else is the light to this age
[1:07:23] you are the light of this age amen so
[1:07:25] you cannot just amen be passive about it
[1:07:28] you cannot procrastinate into this thing
[1:07:30] you can't just play around with this
[1:07:32] thing and twiddle your thumb amen it
[1:07:34] lays on you it's already been written
[1:07:36] amen of what you will do there is a
[1:07:39] power behind it there is a string behind
[1:07:42] the promises of God
[1:07:46] that's right
[1:07:48] now notice
[1:07:50] we're not sitting around here
[1:07:53] wondering what needs to be done
[1:07:55] brother Brown said we know what's to be
[1:07:58] fulfilled
[1:08:00] now listen church it's one thing to look
[1:08:03] at politics and say well yeah we know
[1:08:05] that has to be done
[1:08:07] it's one thing to look at the natural
[1:08:08] church say well we know that has to be
[1:08:10] done
[1:08:11] we can look all around everything else
[1:08:13] and say yeah we know it but where do you
[1:08:15] fit in
[1:08:17] where do I fit in what do we know has to
[1:08:21] be done by us
[1:08:24] so brother Brown said we know what's to
[1:08:26] be fulfilled you who are spiritual and
[1:08:29] know the word of God you see
[1:08:32] everybody say I see
[1:08:34] you see what God has promised
[1:08:38] amen we're not guessing well what are
[1:08:40] these promises we know what's been
[1:08:42] promised we're in the land
[1:08:47] see we are in that third pool the word
[1:08:49] has been opened up to us
[1:08:51] and we're able to look as we talk to
[1:08:54] last Wednesday night we're able to look
[1:08:55] through the eye of God by the message of
[1:08:57] the hour
[1:08:58] now we know what the prophet said you
[1:09:01] know in the word in the countdown
[1:09:03] and I'm not going to take much longer
[1:09:04] but but hopefully it's it's it's it's
[1:09:06] it's ringing true
[1:09:08] but in the natural we have gone from the
[1:09:10] horse and buggy
[1:09:12] to the automobile
[1:09:14] amen and and and then from there we went
[1:09:17] from the automobile to fly on the
[1:09:20] airplane then we progress from the
[1:09:22] airplane to the astronaut amen going out
[1:09:26] in space
[1:09:27] brother Brown says see science has been
[1:09:29] able to prove that there's an astronaut
[1:09:31] that can go so far till you couldn't see
[1:09:34] it with your natural eye
[1:09:36] see it can go whether it can go whether
[1:09:39] there's any pressure there or not
[1:09:41] see amen no matter the pressures it can
[1:09:44] go
[1:09:45] Hallelujah amen see he can just go on
[1:09:49] out because he in a pressurized tank he
[1:09:53] can go up there and sell around and see
[1:09:55] the worlds around
[1:09:57] see where what is it he goes out where a
[1:10:00] few people can go
[1:10:01] he goes out see and he doesn't hear the
[1:10:04] hustle and bustle amen that's going on
[1:10:06] on the earth he's left the Earth he's in
[1:10:10] orbit he's away from all the the
[1:10:13] confusion and the mess and the honking
[1:10:15] of the horns and the traffic jams and
[1:10:17] and and and the busy life of of the
[1:10:20] Earth
[1:10:21] he's out there soaring above and yet we
[1:10:24] can't even he's seeing things that you
[1:10:25] and I or in the natural can't see
[1:10:30] he's beyond all of that
[1:10:33] brother Brown said it's the type of the
[1:10:34] church
[1:10:35] the church isn't in the horse and buggy
[1:10:37] days it's not in the automobile days
[1:10:39] it's not in the airplane but we are in
[1:10:42] the astronaut age
[1:10:44] he says it's beyond the any natural
[1:10:46] things
[1:10:47] that's where you and I are
[1:10:49] what is it it's a Promised Land
[1:10:55] and it took a special message to get us
[1:10:57] there
[1:11:00] it's a spiritual age brother Brown says
[1:11:03] a spiritual time where God has got
[1:11:06] spiritual astronauts
[1:11:08] astronauts people that can take the word
[1:11:10] of God and prove that he's the same
[1:11:13] yesterday today and forever
[1:11:15] spiritual astronauts are those who stay
[1:11:18] with the Bible and say that he's the
[1:11:21] same yesterday today and forever and not
[1:11:24] afraid of the promise regardless of what
[1:11:26] anybody said they just stay with it
[1:11:29] wow they're astronauts they're doing
[1:11:32] things they're able to accomplish things
[1:11:34] in the spirit amen that no other uh
[1:11:37] people on the Earth has
[1:11:42] oh my
[1:11:44] God you love him
[1:11:46] he said what is it you become in an
[1:11:48] astronaut that can go so far it's beyond
[1:11:52] denominational thinking it's beyond
[1:11:54] anything else it's beyond the things of
[1:11:57] the church out yonder with God and him
[1:11:59] alone you stay astronauts and he said
[1:12:02] now listen remember in order to be an
[1:12:05] astronaut they had to get in a tank and
[1:12:08] they can't control themselves
[1:12:11] it takes a radar power an atomic power
[1:12:15] to lift him out beyond space and then
[1:12:18] he's controlled by a tower
[1:12:21] and the church is the same way
[1:12:24] he leadeth me not me leading he leadeth
[1:12:28] me not the church leading me not the
[1:12:31] pope leading me not some uh uh
[1:12:34] Theologian leading me he leads me in
[1:12:38] these Paths of righteousness
[1:12:46] as the man had to get in the tank
[1:12:49] it suited up
[1:12:52] the prophet said so does this bride
[1:12:54] the spiritual astronaut have to get in
[1:12:57] in the body of Christ
[1:12:59] if she's going to go up
[1:13:01] you got to be in the body can you say
[1:13:03] man and then it's not you that's doing
[1:13:06] it it's not me that's doing it something
[1:13:10] is taken over and is leading us up there
[1:13:14] it's taken control of Our Lives isn't
[1:13:18] that what God wants to do is to take
[1:13:20] control of Our Lives he's got the
[1:13:23] promises laying there
[1:13:25] and when you see the promises you can't
[1:13:27] fear when you see these Giants around
[1:13:30] you you cannot fear when you come into
[1:13:32] failure and you're full you cannot fear
[1:13:35] let him lead you
[1:13:37] he'll lead you into these words
[1:13:45] the prophet said God wants men who can
[1:13:47] come into Christ and believe that he's
[1:13:49] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:13:51] don't take their own thinking
[1:13:53] and move out into space controlled by
[1:13:55] the Holy Ghost
[1:13:57] see he leads us
[1:13:58] in the paths of righteousness
[1:14:01] so look how far this world has advanced
[1:14:03] from the horse and buggy day
[1:14:05] amen and yet yes and yet we still have
[1:14:08] people that ride the horse and buggy
[1:14:11] they refuse to move on
[1:14:13] we've got the car people that ride the
[1:14:15] automobiles but they refuse to fly
[1:14:18] we got people that go in into the you
[1:14:21] know into the airplanes but they can't
[1:14:23] they they can't go up into the astronaut
[1:14:25] and same is it in the church
[1:14:28] people get hung up in these ages they
[1:14:31] get hung up and lose them they get hung
[1:14:33] up in Wesley they get hung up in that
[1:14:35] Pentecostal age
[1:14:36] and that's as far as they go
[1:14:40] that God has taken us over into the
[1:14:43] Promised Land
[1:14:45] it's an astronaut to where you can see
[1:14:47] the word differently than than what they
[1:14:49] can in the horse and buggy you can see
[1:14:52] the word differently than what they
[1:14:53] could in the automobile or even the
[1:14:55] airplane
[1:14:57] you see things that you can't see any
[1:14:59] other way
[1:15:02] and you say Amen
[1:15:04] I hope it's all right
[1:15:07] brother Brandon said first they were
[1:15:09] lizards
[1:15:10] then they became chickens
[1:15:13] then they became crows
[1:15:15] but now they are eagles
[1:15:17] and no one can follow them
[1:15:20] you understand
[1:15:22] you see why it's different
[1:15:24] no one can follow you
[1:15:26] and remember what brother Brown said
[1:15:27] about the third pool it cannot be
[1:15:29] impersonated
[1:15:30] remember that now you're part of this
[1:15:32] third pool it cannot be impersonated

[1:15:49] message of the hour and you just thank
[1:15:51] God for the grace that he has given you
[1:15:53] to see these things and the Liberty Amen

[1:16:08] amen and you remember this the astronaut
[1:16:11] doesn't leave Earth by his own power
[1:16:15] can you say man brother Brown said he
[1:16:17] gets into the tank and is fired out
[1:16:21] he just sits there and he waits for
[1:16:22] countdown
[1:16:24] and when the countdown is over something
[1:16:25] takes over that that thing and he's
[1:16:28] there for the right he doesn't have to
[1:16:31] work it up it's already there
[1:16:33] amen the fire is ignited and it just
[1:16:35] pushes off and he's fired out into space
[1:16:39] Amen brother Brown said that's all you
[1:16:41] have to do is get into it God will do
[1:16:43] the shooting and the placing it ain't
[1:16:46] gasoline power no more neither is it
[1:16:48] some church Creed it's God's Adam power
[1:16:51] that pushes you Plum out of space out
[1:16:54] yonder aren't you glad for that see it's
[1:16:56] beyond your control every promise is
[1:16:59] yours by God's power
[1:17:04] brother Brown said to how much greater
[1:17:06] is the astronaut these things now from
[1:17:08] the old horsepower automobile power
[1:17:10] airplane power you see the astronaut
[1:17:13] he's so high that he can see things that
[1:17:15] a man and a horse and buggy can't see
[1:17:17] he's so high he can see things that a
[1:17:19] man in the automobile can't see he's so
[1:17:21] high that he can see things that a man
[1:17:23] flying an airplane cannot see he's done
[1:17:26] went Plum out of reasoning
[1:17:29] amen glory that's it he done he's done
[1:17:32] went beyond any achievement man could
[1:17:35] think of the organization the
[1:17:37] denominations do you realize that
[1:17:39] Supernatural power belongs to the
[1:17:40] astronaut of this age amen it's not a
[1:17:43] makeup it's not a pushing it's not a
[1:17:46] striving it's it's not anything that we
[1:17:48] can conjure up it's just a super Dynamic
[1:17:51] power that we've been able to tap into
[1:17:53] as the astronauts
[1:17:57] yes sir see he's an astronaut he sailed
[1:18:01] Plum off Plum out into space notice what
[1:18:05] brother Brown says any man that ever
[1:18:07] lives for God will have to go beyond any
[1:18:11] five senses he'll have to go beyond any
[1:18:14] education any achievement that man's
[1:18:18] been able to do and believe God break
[1:18:20] everything everybody say break
[1:18:22] everything and lay it aside see you got
[1:18:25] to break through the sound barriers you
[1:18:28] got to break through that unbeliefable
[1:18:29] barrier you've got to break through amen
[1:18:31] that skeptic barrier you got to break
[1:18:33] through every critic you've got to break
[1:18:36] through every barrier in your life amen
[1:18:38] and it's not you again it's not you
[1:18:41] trying to be a Christian it's not you
[1:18:43] trying to overcome it's not you trying
[1:18:45] in your own power get into the body of
[1:18:48] Christ there is a Dynamics to it
[1:18:56] amen
[1:18:58] he said break everything and lay it
[1:19:00] aside and sweep up into the heavens
[1:19:03] Hallelujah
[1:19:04] another place brother Brown said the
[1:19:06] astronaut is any man or woman
[1:19:09] who will dare at any time to take God at
[1:19:11] his word
[1:19:13] you understand that church
[1:19:15] you see as we said uh Sunday night that
[1:19:18] God would have not claimed to said these
[1:19:20] promises if there was not somebody there
[1:19:23] to catch it to catch that word and God
[1:19:27] wouldn't have wasted his time amen
[1:19:29] bringing that third pool in opening the
[1:19:31] word the promised land to us if we're
[1:19:33] going to sit there and be skeptic and
[1:19:35] you remember this amen that the people
[1:19:37] that were skeptic they refused to go
[1:19:39] into that land and they died in the
[1:19:41] wilderness amen they complained about it
[1:19:43] don't complain about the promises don't
[1:19:45] complain about the things that you're
[1:19:48] looking at amen that seems to be a
[1:19:50] barrier to you look at the word of God
[1:19:52] and say I can I will I do believe
[1:19:57] don't complain about them
[1:20:00] don't let your heart become hardened
[1:20:02] when you see things that you cannot do
[1:20:04] yourself
[1:20:08] you with me
[1:20:10] don't let these obstacles
[1:20:13] dim your vision
[1:20:15] of the land that's that's there
[1:20:18] amen
[1:20:20] them Giants are there it's already
[1:20:22] written they'll be there
[1:20:24] the Giants in your life it's already
[1:20:25] been written
[1:20:27] what them now natural people faced amen
[1:20:30] God was only testifying through that
[1:20:32] that you would face it just as well
[1:20:34] except you would face it in a
[1:20:36] supernatural in a supernatural realm you
[1:20:39] had faced the Demonic Powers it isn't
[1:20:41] people it's demonic's Powers it's not
[1:20:43] you it's demonic Powers amen the
[1:20:46] thoughts that come against you amen
[1:20:47] these negative that's demonic Powers
[1:20:50] everything around you his demonic Powers
[1:20:53] amen the negativity that comes from the
[1:20:56] devil but the promises are the positive
[1:20:58] look to the promise
[1:21:03] amen
[1:21:05] notice now
[1:21:07] the word will not come easy
[1:21:10] you got to press your way into doing it
[1:21:14] you got to press your way in to do it
[1:21:16] the prophet said
[1:21:17] Luke 17 20 breaking in the kingdom of
[1:21:20] God cometh not with observation
[1:21:23] you know
[1:21:24] it it
[1:21:26] amen it's not something that everybody
[1:21:28] just looks says oh wow yeah no it
[1:21:32] doesn't come that way
[1:21:34] Matthew 11 12 breaking in Jesus said the
[1:21:37] Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and
[1:21:38] the violent take it by force
[1:21:41] don't come just with observation
[1:21:44] amen if it's shown to you you got to
[1:21:47] take it by force
[1:21:49] you understand what I'm saying
[1:21:51] don't be passive about this message
[1:21:54] don't just sat there and just say well
[1:21:55] I'm just a mess of believer I believe
[1:21:56] God sent a prophet woe is me
[1:21:59] no no no don't you let these don't sit
[1:22:01] in the message church and let promises
[1:22:02] pass by you
[1:22:05] identify yourself with these promises
[1:22:08] they claim to these promises God you
[1:22:10] said it in your word I believe it that
[1:22:11] that settles it that's how you take it
[1:22:14] by force that that's how you fight it
[1:22:15] can you say amen amen you got sickness
[1:22:18] say God I thank you for healing me and
[1:22:20] promises are mine every service I thank
[1:22:23] God for healing me when you go around
[1:22:25] testifying everybody says how are you
[1:22:26] feeling just say I thank God for healing
[1:22:28] me you don't have to give them the blues
[1:22:30] about it just thank God for healing
[1:22:32] you're testifying of the promise of God
[1:22:34] you're laying claim to the promises of
[1:22:37] God you don't feel like raising your
[1:22:38] hands raise your hands anyways God I
[1:22:41] thank you I love you amen push past the
[1:22:44] discouragement push past the negativity
[1:22:46] in your life amen you say well doesn't
[1:22:48] that make me a hypocrite no if you're
[1:22:50] honest and you're true to God you can
[1:22:52] lay claim by faith to these things and
[1:22:55] watch it work for you
[1:22:58] that's right
[1:23:00] amen
[1:23:03] now notice you have to know
[1:23:06] now Jesus knew that John was the prophet
[1:23:08] of the hour
[1:23:10] John knew that Jesus was the Messiah of
[1:23:13] the hour so they they weren't on Earth
[1:23:15] without understanding
[1:23:17] I hope you understand that now
[1:23:19] you didn't get into the promised land
[1:23:21] they didn't come into the promised land
[1:23:22] just wander around without understanding
[1:23:25] understanding came to them
[1:23:31] now Jesus knew it because the word had
[1:23:33] spoken of John
[1:23:35] John knew it because the word had spoken
[1:23:37] of of Jesus
[1:23:39] and the prophet said they both had a
[1:23:41] clear understanding see the word has
[1:23:43] already spoke of them both
[1:23:47] right
[1:23:48] see so they were predestinated to
[1:23:50] fulfill the prophecies concerning them
[1:23:53] you realize that only God before the
[1:23:55] foundation of the world knew who John
[1:23:57] would be
[1:23:58] now in Malachi 3 and in Isaiah and all
[1:24:01] this he spoke of John did not call
[1:24:03] John's name he just prophesied of what
[1:24:06] John would do in the voice he would be
[1:24:07] he would be the voice of one crying in
[1:24:10] the wilderness and yet God never put
[1:24:12] John's name in the book literally to
[1:24:15] where everybody could say oh John the
[1:24:17] Baptist yeah that's you yeah yeah yeah
[1:24:19] yeah no no he didn't do that but as he
[1:24:22] began to prophesy through the prophets
[1:24:24] God already had John on his mind
[1:24:29] right he knew what John would be he knew
[1:24:32] what John would look like he knew what
[1:24:34] John's family would tree would be
[1:24:36] ain't that right see and so he knew amen
[1:24:40] that John was the one Amen to introduce
[1:24:43] the prophet amen and Only God knew who
[1:24:46] was going to be the Messiah only God
[1:24:48] knew who who married who was going to be
[1:24:50] the Virgin girl amen and all of these
[1:24:53] things amen it was revealed to John as
[1:24:55] to who he was
[1:24:57] ain't that right it was revealed to John
[1:25:00] as to who he was so he wasn't just
[1:25:02] preaching without knowing
[1:25:04] it was the people around him that did
[1:25:07] not know who John was
[1:25:09] they thought he was Elias they thought
[1:25:12] he and when I say Elias they saw that he
[1:25:15] was the literal Prophet Elijah
[1:25:18] hold on they thought he was Messiah look
[1:25:21] look it up John 1 21 and they asked him
[1:25:23] what then are thou Elias and he says I
[1:25:26] am not art thou that prophet in other
[1:25:28] words brother Brown said the Messiah he
[1:25:30] said to any answered no then they said
[1:25:32] unto them who art thou that we may give
[1:25:35] an answer to them that sent us what says
[1:25:37] Thou of thyself he said I am the voice
[1:25:40] of one crying in the wilderness make
[1:25:43] straight the way of the Lord as said the
[1:25:45] prophet Isaiah
[1:25:48] he knew who he was
[1:25:50] oh my
[1:25:52] it was a personal revelation to him as
[1:25:54] to who he was and what he was to do
[1:25:56] ain't that right amen and Jesus being
[1:25:59] the word knew who he himself was
[1:26:02] everybody else didn't know who he was
[1:26:05] but he knew who he was he knew he came
[1:26:08] from God and he would go back to God he
[1:26:11] knew that he was sin of the father to do
[1:26:14] the will of the father
[1:26:18] ain't that Ryan
[1:26:20] yeah he was misunderstood by others but
[1:26:23] it wasn't revealed to them
[1:26:25] so notice if the Church of the Living
[1:26:28] God could only get that into their heads
[1:26:30] this morning in their hearts that the
[1:26:32] church would not be separated by
[1:26:34] denominational bearers and that
[1:26:36] differences in Creeds and colors and so
[1:26:37] forth that we might come together in the
[1:26:39] name of the Lord Jesus and not have
[1:26:42] anything to Bear us away from the true
[1:26:45] word of the Living God and while
[1:26:47] straight down that line of scripture to
[1:26:49] fulfill all God's righteousness of today
[1:26:52] amen so so I'm hoping this is is making
[1:26:55] some sense to you tonight that we're not
[1:26:58] just sitting in this world wondering and
[1:27:00] guessing as to who we are young people
[1:27:02] you got a purpose and and and if you're
[1:27:05] just wandering through life just just
[1:27:07] wondering who you are and and and you
[1:27:10] say well I've already got my life mapped
[1:27:11] out I've already got my education I've
[1:27:13] already got my my degrees and I I know
[1:27:15] where I'm going but but before you go
[1:27:17] all that amen and that's fine and dandy
[1:27:20] but you better just look what the master
[1:27:22] has for you amen because there's there's
[1:27:24] a higher purpose there's a greater call
[1:27:26] amen than this just this life amen you
[1:27:29] could be successful in this life and Mr
[1:27:32] Rapture you could be successful in this
[1:27:34] life and be doomed to hell but if you
[1:27:36] fulfill the purpose of God I I thought
[1:27:39] of hearing brother Branham today and he
[1:27:41] says everyone that is fulfilled the
[1:27:43] purpose of God will raise again
[1:27:45] they're going to rise again ain't that
[1:27:47] right amen and so here we are amen we're
[1:27:51] not just wandering around amen but we're
[1:27:54] now identifying ourselves as the
[1:27:57] promises of God are made known oh my
[1:28:01] soul see what light are we living in
[1:28:04] because we are the lights of this age
[1:28:06] we're we're in the evening light
[1:28:09] ain't that right Zechariah 14 7 but it
[1:28:13] shall be one day which shall be known to
[1:28:15] the Lord not day nor night but it shall
[1:28:17] come to pass that evening time it shall
[1:28:19] be light
[1:28:20] your lights
[1:28:22] it's already been written of you to come
[1:28:25] ain't that right notice the prophet said
[1:28:28] it'll be evening time in the it'll be
[1:28:30] light in the evening time these gospel
[1:28:32] lights would turn back again like the
[1:28:35] same sun rises in the East and sits in
[1:28:38] the west it shall return again in the
[1:28:40] last days and here we are in the last
[1:28:42] days we have received the Holy Ghost we
[1:28:45] know that we spoke in tongues like they
[1:28:47] did at Pentecost we know you can receive
[1:28:49] it and we know that the seventh angel
[1:28:51] has given the message we see it
[1:28:53] Vindicated with signs we know we're at
[1:28:56] the end of the layout of sin age we know
[1:28:59] that National Strife signs and wonders
[1:29:02] are appearing everywhere we know that
[1:29:04] we're at the end time see god-bearing
[1:29:06] witness amen nations against Nations
[1:29:09] perplexed the times distress and all
[1:29:12] these things that we've heard see and
[1:29:14] it's becoming to us that we fulfill all
[1:29:18] righteousness we know what's going on in
[1:29:20] the world and now we know it's behooving
[1:29:23] us to fulfill whole all righteousness
[1:29:29] ah
[1:29:31] brother Ram said we should be ready for
[1:29:32] the Rapture at this time of the age look
[1:29:36] where we're at there's something needed
[1:29:38] and that's back to the word
[1:29:41] back to the word we're promised over in
[1:29:44] Malachi 4 that we would be brought back
[1:29:46] to the word our homeland
[1:29:48] then you say amen back to the word what
[1:29:52] word the word that was in the mind of
[1:29:54] God before the foundation of the world
[1:29:56] and the prophet of Malachi 4 taking us
[1:29:59] back to what has been promised by God
[1:30:02] ain't that right
[1:30:04] amen
[1:30:06] I gotta hurry
[1:30:08] brother Brown said the Royal seed would
[1:30:09] see it
[1:30:11] the Royal Sea will know
[1:30:14] he said can't you see Malachi 4 come to
[1:30:16] pass restored to the original Faith the
[1:30:18] word of God
[1:30:19] surely you people can see that we won't
[1:30:22] have to make it any plainer let that
[1:30:24] denomination go man get back to the word
[1:30:30] and the voice of the last day and the
[1:30:32] sign of the last day is to swing the
[1:30:34] people back to the original Faith
[1:30:36] Malachi 4 said so back to the word and
[1:30:39] he was the word not her him amen the
[1:30:41] name of the Lord Jesus the Vindicated
[1:30:43] word Now by The Promise the word that's
[1:30:47] promised and he says the voice is return
[1:30:52] to the word
[1:30:54] hey man I gotta go but I I just love the
[1:30:57] Lord
[1:30:58] remember I'm talking about the voice of
[1:31:00] the sign
[1:31:01] now the sign there's there's always got
[1:31:03] to be a voice following it if there's a
[1:31:04] sign and without the voice don't believe
[1:31:06] the sign
[1:31:08] he said but listen to The Voice
[1:31:10] and he said the voice says return to the
[1:31:12] word
[1:31:13] return to the word
[1:31:15] return to what God has called you to be
[1:31:17] return to what God has predestinated you

[1:31:57] go back to where you came from
[1:32:00] how did we know
[1:32:02] except the open of the word
[1:32:05] and we realized we were in God before
[1:32:07] the foundation of the world
[1:32:09] we were saved before we ever become
[1:32:11] unsaved we were holy before we ever
[1:32:13] became Unholy amen we were faultless
[1:32:16] before we became full of faults
[1:32:18] Hallelujah and here we are we thought
[1:32:21] this was it this is the we were doomed
[1:32:23] and then we hear the voice
