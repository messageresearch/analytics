[50:09] of the Lord I know the sickness has been
[50:11] going around but um um we're we're
[50:15] definitely
[50:16] conquerors uh even over sickness amen
[50:21] and um um uh we had a just a wonderful
[50:25] time of worship Wednesday night tonight
[50:27] and uh after you know the service and
[50:30] just the presence of the Lord came in a
[50:34] special way and I I thank the Lord for
[50:37] that I after we dismiss several stayed
[50:40] probably 45 minutes after the service
[50:45] just worshiping the Lord and just a good
[50:48] spirit uh there and and I just want to
[50:51] say I I
[50:52] appreciate you just taken the time to
[50:55] Worship the Lord
[50:57] um it um you know I worship is a is is
[51:03] such an important part of
[51:05] service and
[51:08] um uh you know the the song leader don't
[51:11] have everything you know um I don't
[51:15] think he should be able to or have to
[51:17] get us primed up I understand that we
[51:20] have you know sometimes we have services
[51:23] that are you know just everybody tired
[51:26] or whatever but I think it's important
[51:28] to press past that tiredness or whatever
[51:31] we got going on and just to Worship the
[51:34] Lord and you know the the lamb has
[51:37] opened the book and um you know brother
[51:42] Bram called the the the worship the king
[51:45] lamb
[51:46] worship and he said it's time for that
[51:49] that's King Glam worship
[51:52] time and U and we are victorious and
[51:56] that's Why We Worship the Lord is
[51:58] because we we know that it's already
[52:01] done we know that we're Victory Victors
[52:05] we know that Satan is
[52:07] defeated and uh whatever he's trying to
[52:09] put on your life that he's just a bluff
[52:13] and so we don't have to worry about him
[52:15] anymore we just just Worship the Lord
[52:19] and brother brand I'm talking about a
[52:22] man that could live so close to the Lord
[52:24] that the devil don't know what to do
[52:25] with him I think that's what it is is
[52:29] just he can't Bluff us anymore he just
[52:32] to a point that we we've understanding
[52:35] who we are that every angle that he
[52:38] tries to put on us um we we just don't
[52:42] listen to him anymore and he just lost
[52:44] his power over us uh in the sense that
[52:48] he can't Bluff us amen and so we must
[52:52] never let the the spirit of worship die
[52:54] in the church never let the Revival fire
[52:59] die we always want to stay in the life
[53:02] can you say
[53:03] Amen uh we want to if you would like to
[53:06] turn with me the first of all the book
[53:08] of Colossians the first
[53:10] chapter and
[53:13] um we want to as it's been said to keep
[53:16] brother Bill Y and uh the family in
[53:19] prayer as they've sister Shirley has
[53:22] passed away and I believe the the
[53:25] memorials
[53:27] Service uh and the viewing will be
[53:29] tomorrow evening and I don't have the
[53:32] time with
[53:34] me so the viewing starts at 5: and the
[53:37] service starts at
[53:39] 7 okay and it'll be at uh at the the
[53:43] church there the lighthouse I think is
[53:46] it
[53:47] Lighthouse yeah and so uh uh we we want
[53:52] to uh keep them in prayer I understand
[53:54] that brother bill will be taking the
[53:57] service and uh ministering and so I know
[54:02] uh he'll need our prayer and may the
[54:05] Lord just give him the
[54:07] strength also uh our tent meeting is
[54:10] coming up uh uh you know here soon and
[54:16] uh brother Tim had talked to uh uh Diane
[54:20] there at the the the camp and uh she um
[54:25] it it was was that uh uh she had had
[54:30] mentioned to Daniel that we would uh
[54:33] only be allowed to set up uh around the
[54:35] 20th which would have given us only a
[54:38] week and so uh but she told brother Tim
[54:41] that we could set it up on April 14th
[54:44] which will be on a
[54:46] Monday um at this time we can't they
[54:49] don't want to setting it up any
[54:51] earlier uh because of a camp or or
[54:56] someone is coming supposedly coming in
[55:00] at that time um uh for the weekend and
[55:04] so she doesn't want to setting it up
[55:06] before uh that time or during that time
[55:11] and so uh uh it looks like we will be
[55:16] able to set the T up on April
[55:18] 14th uh on a Monday so if any of you
[55:22] brothers would like to help and can get
[55:24] off work uh at at that time that would
[55:27] be great if anything changes we will let
[55:30] you
[55:31] know
[55:32] um uh hopefully uh by the end of
[55:37] February she said she would know if
[55:40] if if that group is going to take the
[55:44] camp uh at that time usually we're the
[55:46] first ones uh that open the camp up uh
[55:50] and so uh this time I guess they open
[55:55] she open opened it up for another group
[55:58] ahead of us and U so anyways uh
[56:02] hopefully that ain't too confusing so
[56:04] April 14th
[56:06] Monday uh we'll be setting the tin up uh
[56:09] unless something changes and we're able
[56:12] to get it earlier than that so uh just
[56:16] keep that in your mind uh Colossians um
[56:20] one and
[56:24] um nine we'll start there for this cause
[56:29] we also since the day we heard it do not
[56:32] cease to pray for
[56:34] you and to desire that you be filled
[56:37] with the knowledge of his

[56:51] of the Lord unto all pleasing being FR
[56:55] fruitful in every good work and
[56:59] increasing in the
[57:01] knowledge of
[57:03] God then if you'll turn with me first
[57:08] Thessalonians

[57:16] 4 and I do want to say I appreciate the

[1:00:18] today I um the title I want to use again
[1:00:22] as I did Wednesday night walk pleasing
[1:00:26] unto
[1:00:27] him and U I truly believe that we're
[1:00:33] living in a time of the manifestation of
[1:00:36] the sons of God and
[1:00:39] um we know it to be the time of
[1:00:43] adoption and uh just maybe for a a
[1:00:49] little background of uh the way brother
[1:00:53] Bram taught us and that about the
[1:00:55] adoption
[1:00:56] [Music]
[1:00:57] uh in the Old Testament when a a a a boy
[1:01:02] was born into a wealthy
[1:01:06] family uh maybe the the boy's father
[1:01:09] owned a a kingdom lots of acerage and he
[1:01:12] had uh servants and and and uh things on
[1:01:17] his his farm or or ranch or whatever and
[1:01:22] so that that boy was born into to the
[1:01:26] kingdom and he was a son but he was just
[1:01:31] a son a son without Authority a son
[1:01:35] without
[1:01:36] privilege a son that had not an
[1:01:40] inheritance as of yet or come into His
[1:01:44] inheritance and basically he was just as
[1:01:47] a servant he was told what to do how to
[1:01:50] do it and commanded and and so uh he he
[1:01:56] wasn't free to tell somebody else what
[1:01:58] to do but he was told to do this he was
[1:02:02] told to do that and he had to he had to
[1:02:04] be taught he had to listen he had to
[1:02:06] know what Authority was and the Apostle
[1:02:11] Paul explains it in in Galatians 4 And1
[1:02:15] he says now I say that the heir as long
[1:02:18] as he is a child differeth nothing from
[1:02:21] a servant though he be Lord of all but
[1:02:25] is under two and governors until the
[1:02:28] time appointed of the father so then the
[1:02:31] son wasn't left on his
[1:02:34] own uh just growing up you know left
[1:02:39] unattended left without instruction
[1:02:42] because he would grow up to be a brat he
[1:02:45] would grow up to be sport you know and
[1:02:49] uh and so uh you know the father then he
[1:02:53] would bring in a tutor
[1:02:56] uh and he had to trust that tutor he had
[1:02:58] to know that tutor it may have been a a
[1:03:00] best friend of his or whatever but uh he
[1:03:05] was he was busy taking care of the farm
[1:03:08] and and making sure everything was going
[1:03:11] good and so he didn't have time to to uh
[1:03:14] raise his son in in in in the way that
[1:03:18] the son needed raising and so he he
[1:03:21] brought in a a tutor and and so uh uh
[1:03:25] you know brother BR says you know the
[1:03:27] father he didn't know if his boy would
[1:03:28] turn out to be a gangster or be slothful
[1:03:32] in running the business so then he
[1:03:34] couldn't just let the boy grow up and
[1:03:37] then turn the kingdom over to the boy
[1:03:40] you know at a at a certain age maybe 21
[1:03:43] or uh or whatever but without first
[1:03:49] training the the boy and then testing
[1:03:52] him the boy had to be trained and tested
[1:03:55] and so he would he would he uh had to
[1:03:58] trust the tutor to train the boy in the
[1:04:01] right way the the father knew how to run
[1:04:04] the business he knew what he was wanting
[1:04:07] he did not want that business to fail he
[1:04:10] didn't want it to be
[1:04:12] sold uh and and you remember the prodal
[1:04:15] son uh he showed himself to be a
[1:04:18] slothful uh he wanted his inheritance
[1:04:20] and he just squandered it well that's
[1:04:23] not what the father wanted uh uh and so
[1:04:26] he would get the best tutor and and and
[1:04:29] then Not only would the tutor have to to
[1:04:32] train the boy right but he also had to
[1:04:35] be honest uh he had to bring report to
[1:04:38] the father on how the boy was doing and
[1:04:42] whether it displeased the father whether
[1:04:44] it made the father happy or whatever he
[1:04:47] had to be honest uh about the the the
[1:04:50] child's uh uh progress so the the tutor
[1:04:54] he was an instructor
[1:04:56] a a a teacher and so you know the
[1:04:59] prophet would tell us that you know
[1:05:00] maybe the the tutor come to the the
[1:05:02] father and and he would tell and say
[1:05:05] well the boy's not he's just not going
[1:05:07] to be very good with business you know I
[1:05:11] you know I i' I've tried to teach him
[1:05:14] I've tried to help him and he he just
[1:05:17] won't listen he just he's stubborn he's
[1:05:20] he's got his own way about things
[1:05:23] and I I just don't know you know and and
[1:05:27] uh he's going to be this or that and the
[1:05:30] prophet says then the Father the father
[1:05:32] realizes right then that that boy cannot
[1:05:36] take over his domain that's right
[1:05:39] because what would he do he had run he
[1:05:41] had run it through he says see The
[1:05:43] Return of the prodical son gives the
[1:05:45] very a very beautiful picture of it he
[1:05:48] couldn't see what would he do uh uh
[1:05:51] would be to mortgage the farm or sell it
[1:05:54] off and drink it up and and run around
[1:05:56] see so then that son continues to be a
[1:06:00] son but without reward he continues to
[1:06:04] be a son but without inheritance because
[1:06:06] that son doesn't inherit anything uh
[1:06:10] there but if the boy proved to be of
[1:06:12] good character and and the the the tutor
[1:06:16] would tell the father oh you'd be proud
[1:06:18] of him I you know uh now this is and and
[1:06:21] you can go look it up the prophet
[1:06:23] preaches hear ye him and several time I
[1:06:26] think 12 times he preaches that subject
[1:06:29] and plus adoption series and on and on
[1:06:33] but you know uh uh maybe he would tell
[1:06:36] the father you know I you know what
[1:06:39] Sunday morning come along and I costed
[1:06:41] him to have a flat tire I caus that tire
[1:06:44] to be flat and you know what he uh he
[1:06:47] went and and instead of just giving up
[1:06:50] he went to the neighbor's house to see
[1:06:51] if he could get a ride to church or he
[1:06:54] called somebody to see if you get a ride
[1:06:56] he said that that that boy just I mean
[1:06:59] he was just I I just I tried to mess his
[1:07:02] day up and and he he was just
[1:07:05] persevering he said now that that boy is
[1:07:08] is going to be good you know and and so
[1:07:12] he he would uh uh brother Brandon would
[1:07:14] explain it in different ways of of how
[1:07:16] this this son would be uh but but the
[1:07:19] son would be proven to be of good
[1:07:22] character and was found to be faithful
[1:07:26] about the father's
[1:07:28] business uh you know maybe the friends
[1:07:31] wanted him to go out and and uh you know
[1:07:35] drink a little bit but uh no no I can't
[1:07:38] do that i' I'm uh I've got to stay with
[1:07:42] this you know and and uh uh so then the
[1:07:46] father would adopt him into the kingdom
[1:07:49] ain't that right now brother Ram said
[1:07:52] his conduct determined his inheritance
[1:07:56] how he conducted himself determined
[1:08:00] whether he come into that inheritance
[1:08:03] now when the boy was adopted that he
[1:08:05] wasn't just a son anymore but the
[1:08:08] prophet said he was Heir coair with the
[1:08:11] father of every possession he had he was
[1:08:17] no longer under a tutor but now he was
[1:08:21] like his father his father give him
[1:08:24] certain things to do he might have told
[1:08:27] him now you take care of this field over
[1:08:29] here or you do this over here and you
[1:08:33] take care of the slaves you take care of
[1:08:35] whatever it is see he was in full
[1:08:39] possession he for he was adopted into
[1:08:42] that family and his name on his check
[1:08:46] was just as good as his daddies can you
[1:08:50] say Amen so so we we find that that
[1:08:55] there Paul would talk about it in
[1:08:57] Ephesians 1 and5 it tells us that God
[1:09:01] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:09:04] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:09:08] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:09:10] will can you say amen I thank God that
[1:09:14] that we we just didn't come through
[1:09:17] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:09:19] of the Holy Ghost but he predestinated
[1:09:23] us to come into our
[1:09:26] inheritance uh adoption but now brother
[1:09:29] Bram tells us through through these
[1:09:32] stories of of the Old Testament just
[1:09:35] that we don't come into
[1:09:37] adoption just
[1:09:39] because uh but we come into adoption
[1:09:43] because our conduct well there's a good
[1:09:47] character about us now now I I'll be
[1:09:50] honest now there's a I know there's been
[1:09:52] a lot of trials that hits us uh there's
[1:09:55] a lot of things that come upon us and
[1:09:58] sometimes it it just seems hot and it
[1:10:01] seems heavy and it seems like we just
[1:10:03] ain't going to make it but I I tell you
[1:10:06] God's testing the
[1:10:09] character he's wanting character can you
[1:10:12] say Amen now our tutor is the Holy Ghost
[1:10:17] um which is the spirit of Truth John
[1:10:20] 16:13 how be it when he the spirit of
[1:10:24] Truth is come and in other words the
[1:10:26] spirit of the word amen not just any
[1:10:29] Spirit but the spirit of Truth the
[1:10:32] spirit of the word when he comes he will
[1:10:34] guide you into all truth how many
[1:10:37] believes that when he comes he's going
[1:10:41] to teach you he's going to instruct you
[1:10:44] in Old truth not partial truth not leave
[1:10:47] you wondering about a little thing no
[1:10:50] this is honest this tutor's honest he
[1:10:52] knows what the father wants and so he is
[1:10:55] going to guide you into all Truth for he
[1:10:58] shall not speak of himself but
[1:11:00] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[1:11:02] speak and he shall show you things to
[1:11:06] come he shall glorify me for he shall
[1:11:09] receive of mine and shall show it unto
[1:11:11] you then in John 14:26 Jesus said he
[1:11:15] shall teach you all things not some
[1:11:19] things all things can you say amen and I
[1:11:24] tell you teach in his teaching sometimes
[1:11:27] is unbearable in a lot of ways his
[1:11:30] teaching sometimes hurts his teaching
[1:11:33] sometimes leaves us bewildered at times
[1:11:37] amen see and sometimes it leaves us
[1:11:40] questioning what's really going on here
[1:11:42] see because a lot of times teaching is
[1:11:45] not just coming behind the pulpit and
[1:11:47] you sitting in a Pew and you're learning
[1:11:49] that way that's good God wants us to do
[1:11:51] that but a lot of times it's a School of
[1:11:53] Hard Knocks
[1:11:55] and and so he shall teach you all things
[1:11:58] and bring all things to your remembrance
[1:12:00] whatsoever I have said unto you so this
[1:12:05] would tell us that we have no other
[1:12:07] teacher outside the Holy Spirit the
[1:12:10] spirit of the word which tells us that
[1:12:12] our headship is the word of God Amen no
[1:12:17] other teacher no other instructor amen
[1:12:20] but our headship is the word and then it
[1:12:25] tells us also that we must have the
[1:12:28] right character amen uh uh and that's
[1:12:32] what God is looking for last Wednesday I
[1:12:36] I spoke on about elaser looking uh uh
[1:12:41] for a bride trying to find a bride for
[1:12:44] Isaac and and his master El uh Abraham
[1:12:48] sent him out to among his own Kindred to
[1:12:51] find a bride for Isaac the prophet says
[1:12:55] and when he got there elaser waited
[1:12:58] until he found character he he he he he
[1:13:02] wasn't looking for beauty he wasn't
[1:13:04] looking for talent in and per se you
[1:13:07] understand what I'm saying he wasn't
[1:13:09] looking for a gifted person if if we
[1:13:11] could look at speak of it in our terms
[1:13:14] he wasn't you know uh uh speaking
[1:13:17] looking for a well-qualified preacher
[1:13:19] one that could uh uh uh just Astound the
[1:13:22] crowd and he wasn't he wasn't looking
[1:13:24] for the he was looking for character and
[1:13:28] he would wait he knew what he was
[1:13:29] looking for he he was wanting to see and
[1:13:32] so the prophet said God is looking for
[1:13:35] character amen we can run around the
[1:13:38] building but God wants character we can
[1:13:40] we can prophesy we can speak in tongues
[1:13:43] we can preach so beautiful sing so
[1:13:45] beautiful play so beautiful in
[1:13:47] instruments and and all of these things
[1:13:49] but God is looking for character that's
[1:13:52] why the preacher goes through trials
[1:13:54] that's why the deacons go through trials
[1:13:56] that's why mothers and fathers and
[1:13:58] children and musicians and and every one
[1:14:02] of us is not exempt from the trials and
[1:14:05] the the testings of life because God is
[1:14:09] looking for character can you say amen
[1:14:12] that's right he's not flirting he's not
[1:14:14] looking for boyfriend girlfriend type
[1:14:16] thing he's not just looking to go dating
[1:14:19] he wants a wife ain't that right and and
[1:14:23] so therefore the car
[1:14:25] comes from the word of God Amen now if
[1:14:29] if you think of it there has been no
[1:14:31] Ministry no Ministry who's who's fell in
[1:14:35] line with the
[1:14:37] responsibility uh that elaser had
[1:14:40] outside of brother brandom's Ministry
[1:14:43] now now think of that elaser was a type
[1:14:46] he was a type Rebecca was a type and
[1:14:50] Isaac a type and and and all of these
[1:14:53] things a type and there's been no Min
[1:14:55] Ministry fulfill that type A as as
[1:14:58] brother branham's Ministry it was and
[1:15:01] brother brandham wouldn't even known of
[1:15:02] that except the angel of the Lord told
[1:15:05] him that his ministry fell in line with
[1:15:08] elaser it was that of elaser go get that
[1:15:12] bride remember brother Brandon wondering
[1:15:14] what he had done if if I've done
[1:15:16] anything wrong do I need to repent of it
[1:15:18] do I make it right what what what what's
[1:15:21] going on is there something else that
[1:15:22] that I'm coming to or or what what is it
[1:15:25] and he opened that he closed his eyes
[1:15:27] opened his Bible and his fingers fell L
[1:15:29] are going after uh uh uh uh a bride for
[1:15:33] Isaac and he said that's right with my
[1:15:36] message go get that bride see so
[1:15:40] therefore if if brother brandham fits
[1:15:43] that type then there must be a Rebecca
[1:15:48] on the earth to meet the word to meet
[1:15:51] the message to fulfill the type of her
[1:15:54] and and if you notice elaser found her
[1:15:58] in the evening time not in the morning
[1:16:01] not midday but in the evening time and
[1:16:05] the message of the hour is the evening
[1:16:08] time message it's not a morning message
[1:16:11] it's not a midday message it's the
[1:16:14] evening message and brother Bram would
[1:16:16] tell us the word the evening message
[1:16:19] must carry evening
[1:16:22] results do you believe that it's not to
[1:16:25] get us all Getty and and and all puffed
[1:16:27] up it's not to get us amen into a
[1:16:31] Pentecostal Revival or a Lutheran
[1:16:33] Revival or a wesleyian Revival it's to
[1:16:36] get us into a place where character
[1:16:39] comes forth our character comes forth
[1:16:42] can you say amen that's right see there
[1:16:45] wasn't much charact and and I'm just
[1:16:46] going to preach now there wasn't much
[1:16:48] character down Through the Ages amen uh
[1:16:51] uh uh God's bride fa amen Adam's bride
[1:16:55] fell and Jehovah's bride fell can you
[1:16:57] say amen and look at the church they
[1:16:59] amen God brings them out they go right
[1:17:01] back in God brings them out they go
[1:17:03] right back in this bride will not go
[1:17:05] back into denominations she she will not
[1:17:08] go back in the world there's a character
[1:17:10] about
[1:17:11] her that's right and this message is
[1:17:15] producing or bringing forth that
[1:17:18] character so he says now the evening
[1:17:21] message must seow evening seed not
[1:17:23] morning seed evening seed is that right
[1:17:26] midday scene see it it seeds back there
[1:17:30] uh was denomination it died and perish
[1:17:33] but evening time message will show
[1:17:36] evening time light will show evening
[1:17:39] time results see the evening time
[1:17:42] message can you say Amen now the
[1:17:44] beginning message if we'd want to say it
[1:17:47] that way the morning message the
[1:17:49] beginning message showed the morning
[1:17:52] results or beginning results and that
[1:17:54] was cre creation Genesis 1:1 ain't that
[1:17:57] right in the beginning God created the
[1:17:59] heavens and the Earth and and and and he
[1:18:02] created this and he created the trees
[1:18:04] and he created the birds and he created
[1:18:06] this and and created man and it was a
[1:18:09] creation that was the morning message
[1:18:11] that was the begning message and then
[1:18:14] brother Brandon would tell us that in
[1:18:16] Jesus time was the midday message amen
[1:18:20] that that showed midday results God made
[1:18:24] his son in his own image in the midday
[1:18:28] amen that's what Jesus was he was a
[1:18:30] creation amen the only begotten son of
[1:18:34] the father can you say amen amen see and
[1:18:37] and the son was created by the midday
[1:18:41] message and he says now in the evening
[1:18:44] time see in the evening time what's he
[1:18:46] doing he makes his bride in the evening
[1:18:50] time a bride is produced by the same
[1:18:54] word can you say Amen the word in the
[1:18:58] beginning brought forth the world the
[1:19:00] word in midday brought forth the created
[1:19:02] son the word in the evening time brings
[1:19:05] forth a
[1:19:08] bride can you say Amen so how did God
[1:19:11] create the Earth in the beginning by
[1:19:13] speaking it into existence by his word
[1:19:17] spoke it into existence amen who was his
[1:19:21] son the word do you believe that in the
[1:19:24] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:19:26] God the Word was God and that same word
[1:19:30] was made
[1:19:31] flesh the word brought forth the sun now
[1:19:36] how is he making his bride by the same
[1:19:39] word do you believe it not by a Creed
[1:19:43] not by a theologian not by psychology
[1:19:46] amen see but God promised that the word
[1:19:49] would come back God promised that the
[1:19:53] word would come back and be made flesh
[1:19:56] again do you believe that amen the
[1:19:58] revealing of the son of man amen the
[1:20:01] word would come back amen but it would
[1:20:04] come back in Bride form it would come
[1:20:08] back in Bride form and the evening time
[1:20:13] message will produce it and I say has
[1:20:18] produced it amen the
[1:20:22] Lord now after elaser found the
[1:20:25] character brother bradam says the next
[1:20:28] thing was getting her ready to
[1:20:30] go he found the
[1:20:33] character next thing was get her ready
[1:20:36] to go to meet the bridegroom notice
[1:20:39] that's the same now brother it's the
[1:20:43] same now the E the end time message is
[1:20:48] not out yonder in
[1:20:51] Babylon it's not for Babylon
[1:20:55] it's not for
[1:20:56] everybody the evening time message of
[1:20:59] elaser was not for Rebecca's
[1:21:04] family it wasn't for the whole
[1:21:07] tribe it was for Rebecca amen can you
[1:21:12] say Amen so you understand why there's a
[1:21:15] lot of folks don't even know about the
[1:21:17] message of the hour others don't even
[1:21:19] care to listen about the message of the
[1:21:21] hour you tell them God sent a prophet
[1:21:24] and they look at you as an a cult you're
[1:21:25] crazy but they'll accept anything else
[1:21:28] that comes along they will accept every
[1:21:31] politician that's that and they'll
[1:21:33] swallow every promise that they make and
[1:21:35] all oh a golden age oh yeah it's a
[1:21:37] golden age amen who says it's going to
[1:21:40] be a golden age Prophet said it's
[1:21:43] not Bible doesn't predict them things
[1:21:47] but when a prophet comes and you try to
[1:21:49] show them by the word of God that
[1:21:50] Malachi 4 promised a profit in this age
[1:21:53] oh that's just cra crazy why it's not
[1:21:56] for that
[1:21:58] crowd it's for a
[1:22:01] Rebecca can you say Amen now notice it
[1:22:05] it takes a prophet to find the character
[1:22:09] that God's looking for see the word was
[1:22:12] lost how many believes that the word was
[1:22:15] lost by Creeds and dogmas and
[1:22:18] Catholicism and and and that carnal
[1:22:22] Church uh uh uh uh that false Vine false
[1:22:27] church that inter intertwined and nearly
[1:22:30] killed out the true church and and and
[1:22:34] they they come up with so much doctrines
[1:22:36] and so much this that the word was lost
[1:22:39] and it took a profit to bring it
[1:22:42] back it started good on the day of
[1:22:45] Pentecost amen that that seed was there
[1:22:48] and and It produced uh uh it showed what
[1:22:51] the real seed was that was an original
[1:22:54] Pentecost there wasn't nothing fake
[1:22:56] about that amen there was no
[1:22:58] impersonation about that Peter took it
[1:23:01] to the scriptures says this is that
[1:23:03] which the prophet Joel spoke of showing
[1:23:05] it was a word seed but look at all these
[1:23:09] other religions there's nothing found in
[1:23:11] the word about it that is true amen amen
[1:23:16] see and and so therefore the word was
[1:23:18] lost everybody accepting this and that
[1:23:22] and and impersonations and false false
[1:23:25] Impressions and and all of these things
[1:23:28] it took a prophet to bring the word back
[1:23:31] and to bring that word back to
[1:23:34] manifestation
[1:23:36] again see God God isn't after another
[1:23:39] church you know uh being established in
[1:23:42] town he's you know he's he isn't after
[1:23:45] another Revival happening
[1:23:50] worldwide he isn't after something new
[1:23:53] to come and excit fight the church and
[1:23:55] stimulate the
[1:23:57] church come on Church he's looking for
[1:24:01] character that can just be stimulated
[1:24:04] with what he's
[1:24:10] revealed he's wanting a word bride
[1:24:13] that's right and it couldn't happen
[1:24:15] until this
[1:24:17] time amen that's right can you say Amen
[1:24:21] the sons of God could not be manifested
[1:24:23] in any other age than this age that's
[1:24:25] right the word could not become flesh in
[1:24:28] any other age but this age there's been
[1:24:31] no other time outside Jesus time between
[1:24:34] jesus' time and now that the son of man
[1:24:37] has been revealed son of man was not
[1:24:39] revealed on the day of
[1:24:42] Pentecost brother Brandon plainly
[1:24:44] teaches that it was the son of God
[1:24:48] dispensation amen that's right can you
[1:24:51] say Amen so there has never been a bride
[1:24:55] with the same character that Jesus
[1:24:59] had to Simply do the will of the father
[1:25:04] that's
[1:25:05] right now Rebecca's family didn't want
[1:25:08] her to
[1:25:10] go and and now they got the gifts just
[1:25:13] as Rebecca got
[1:25:16] gifts but there was
[1:25:18] nothing to excite them about meeting
[1:25:21] Isaac and they didn't want her to go
[1:25:24] yeah but they they did say this let the
[1:25:27] damel speak for
[1:25:32] herself and Rebecca
[1:25:35] spoke I will
[1:25:37] go there was that character I I I'll go
[1:25:42] can you say Amen now brother random says
[1:25:44] this he said see uh when elaser found
[1:25:47] the character that was in the woman
[1:25:49] Rebecca the beautiful bride of Isaac he
[1:25:52] told her about Isaac is that not what
[1:25:55] our messenger has done in this day they
[1:25:58] want to say you know get people to
[1:26:00] Christ before the
[1:26:03] message it shows as Brother Sam would
[1:26:06] say their ignorance they're showing
[1:26:07] their
[1:26:12] ignorance get the get get get the people
[1:26:14] to Christ before the message see our
[1:26:18] eler in this day that's what he's doing
[1:26:22] is telling us all about him
[1:26:24] about
[1:26:26] Christ so he says he told her about
[1:26:28] Isaac and she never questioned one thing
[1:26:32] never questioned one thing never said
[1:26:35] well that's just your
[1:26:37] opinion or that was inspired and that
[1:26:40] wasn't just never question where she
[1:26:42] understood everything or not she just
[1:26:44] never
[1:26:45] questioned she never questioned one
[1:26:48] thing she believed the word of the
[1:26:50] messenger and she made ready to go
[1:26:56] and they went asked the father and he
[1:26:58] said just ask her the damils of age ask
[1:27:01] her let her decision be she said I will
[1:27:03] go brother Braham says to what what is
[1:27:07] she going to go to a man she had never
[1:27:09] seen know nothing about but yet she was
[1:27:12] ready because she was predestinated and
[1:27:15] foreordained to that can you say Amen
[1:27:20] made herself ready now when you think of
[1:27:24] the these then then we look at Ephesians
[1:27:26] 4:17 I've got a few scriptures that I
[1:27:30] want to read to you but it says this I
[1:27:33] say therefore and testify in the Lord
[1:27:35] that you
[1:27:36] henceforth walk not as other Gentiles
[1:27:40] walk in the vanity of their mind now
[1:27:44] notice the scriptures mean something to
[1:27:47] that
[1:27:49] Rebecca true don't walk henceforth walk
[1:27:52] as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of
[1:27:55] their mind having the understanding
[1:27:57] darkened being alienated from the life
[1:28:00] of God through the ignorance that is in
[1:28:02] them because of the blindness of their
[1:28:04] heart who being past feelings have given
[1:28:08] themselves over unto lasciviousness to
[1:28:11] work all uncleanness with greediness but
[1:28:14] you have not so learned Christ if so be
[1:28:17] that you have heard of him and have been
[1:28:19] taught by him as the truth in Jes is in
[1:28:22] Jesus that you put off everybody say put
[1:28:26] off put off concerning the former
[1:28:29] conversation the old man which is
[1:28:32] corrupt according to the deceitful
[1:28:35] lusts you you
[1:28:37] cannot serve God now these scriptures
[1:28:40] are applicable to us in this
[1:28:43] age he's found a
[1:28:46] character that that that says I I'll go
[1:28:49] whatever it
[1:28:51] takes and and and others have said I
[1:28:54] ain't I ain't got to do that I ain't
[1:28:56] that ain't me I'm God knows who what I
[1:28:58] am we believe in grace and they make
[1:29:00] Grace
[1:29:01] disgrace but here Paul is speak that you
[1:29:04] put off concerning that the formal
[1:29:07] conver conversation the old man which is
[1:29:10] corrupt according to the deceitful lust
[1:29:12] and be renewed in the spirit of your
[1:29:14] mind that you put on the new
[1:29:18] man which after God is created in
[1:29:21] righteousness and true Holiness
[1:29:22] wherefore put away
[1:29:25] lying speak every man truth with his
[1:29:28] neighbor for we are members of one
[1:29:30] another can you say Amen uh Philippians
[1:29:34] 1:27 let your conversation be as it
[1:29:37] becometh the gospel of Christ that
[1:29:40] whether I come and see you or else be
[1:29:42] absent I may hear of your Affairs that
[1:29:45] you stand fast in one spirit with one
[1:29:49] mind striving together for the faith of
[1:29:53] the Gospel
[1:29:55] now these scriptures use that word
[1:29:57] conversation and I looked up that word
[1:30:00] and from the Strong's Concordance it is
[1:30:03] behavior let your
[1:30:06] behavior be as it becometh the gospel
[1:30:09] can you say Amen there there's a life
[1:30:12] there there's a way of life there's a
[1:30:14] there's there's a way of living that a
[1:30:16] Christian
[1:30:18] lives that that the world does not live
[1:30:21] that CH uh uh most Christian don't live
[1:30:24] this is to the bride of Christ this is
[1:30:27] to Rebecca put off that old
[1:30:32] Behavior that's right 1 Timothy 4:12 let
[1:30:36] no man despise thy youth but be thou an
[1:30:38] example of the Believers in
[1:30:44] word in word yes don't just be rattling
[1:30:48] off
[1:30:50] things
[1:30:52] hello I you know it it gripes me I guess
[1:30:56] you have to forgive me but it just
[1:30:58] gripes me when when you got Elders or
[1:31:01] supposed to be Elders or whatever that
[1:31:04] is talking about sports to our young
[1:31:06] people and talking about the you know
[1:31:09] the scores that this football team and
[1:31:11] they're just all excited about it never
[1:31:14] talking about the Lord to them never
[1:31:16] encouraging about the things of
[1:31:18] God but they got they know everything
[1:31:21] about football they know everything
[1:31:23] about their team they know everything
[1:31:24] about sports and and and we can what we
[1:31:28] can go in movies television we can go
[1:31:30] about sitcoms and and and whatever you
[1:31:33] want to
[1:31:34] say but there has to be somebody that
[1:31:37] that that that looks at these things be
[1:31:40] thou an
[1:31:42] example of the
[1:31:44] believer in
[1:31:46] word conversation or
[1:31:51] behavior in charity in spirit in faith
[1:31:55] in Purity amen that's good can you say
[1:32:00] Amen so so what is this that he's
[1:32:03] looking for a life of
[1:32:05] conduct this is dealing with a
[1:32:07] Christian's conduct Behavior
[1:32:14] lifestyle that we should be an
[1:32:17] example well I go to church that ought
[1:32:19] to be a good enough example well that's
[1:32:22] that's part of it but you defeat your
[1:32:24] own purpose going to church and living a
[1:32:26] hypocrite you understand what I'm saying
[1:32:29] and and if people cannot see us out on
[1:32:32] the outside if our families can't look
[1:32:34] at us and say now that's a genuine
[1:32:36] Christian right there they can't our
[1:32:39] children can't look at Daddy and and say
[1:32:41] now that's a real Christian dad Daddy's
[1:32:43] a Christian Mama's a Christian when we
[1:32:46] look at one another in in in the church
[1:32:48] and we could say now there's Christians
[1:32:50] right there there's something about them
[1:32:51] they've got a glow about them every
[1:32:53] every time I'm around them their their
[1:32:55] atmosphere is is so radiant of the of
[1:32:58] the presence of the Lord it it just
[1:33:00] makes people want to be around you and
[1:33:03] and and and because there there's Purity
[1:33:06] coming out of your mouth there's Purity
[1:33:08] coming from your behavior there there
[1:33:10] there's character that is there can you
[1:33:13] say Amen it's be thou an example of the
[1:33:15] Believers you know and and I'm not
[1:33:17] saying that we all don't go through
[1:33:18] testings and trials I I ain't saying
[1:33:21] that at all but God got to mold us amen
[1:33:26] amen now James 3:11 do the fountain send
[1:33:31] forth at the same place you know sweet
[1:33:34] water and
[1:33:36] bitter can the can the Fig Tree my
[1:33:39] brethren Bear all of berries either a
[1:33:42] Vine figs so can no Fountain yield both

[1:33:54] you you you can't you can't produce love
[1:33:57] and bitterness at the same time you you
[1:33:59] can't produce peace and and distraught
[1:34:02] at the same time you you can't produce
[1:34:05] you know worldly things and godly things
[1:34:08] at the same
[1:34:09] time you you can't do that see so he
[1:34:12] says in the 13th verse who is a wise man
[1:34:15] and endued with knowledge among you let
[1:34:17] him show out of a good conversation or
[1:34:20] good behavior his works with me weakness
[1:34:24] of wisdom that's right can you say Amen
[1:34:27] 1 Peter 1:13 wherefore gir up the loens
[1:34:31] of your
[1:34:32] mind be
[1:34:36] sober you understand that see the world
[1:34:39] ain't they ain't giring up the Lo of
[1:34:41] their mind they're letting just thoughts
[1:34:43] just run rapid and they're allowing
[1:34:45] these thoughts to control
[1:34:48] them I feel saved one day so I I'm I'm
[1:34:51] I'm woo praise God don't feel saved the
[1:34:57] day and and it could go just any way we
[1:35:00] we allow we feed off the world and we
[1:35:03] tried to well you know I'm finding out
[1:35:06] the more you feed off the world the less
[1:35:08] you feed off of God I find out the more
[1:35:11] that you get involved in in in the
[1:35:13] things of the world whether it be on the
[1:35:15] phone of YouTube and and whatever else
[1:35:19] and and you're feeding off of those
[1:35:21] things feeding off of that even in into
[1:35:24] news and all that then you start letting
[1:35:26] off that prayer life you start letting
[1:35:28] off that that Bible reading you start
[1:35:30] letting off amen listening to the tapes
[1:35:33] and you start letting your mind wander
[1:35:36] amen and the things start dictate you've
[1:35:39] got to G up the loens of your mind
[1:35:44] Rebecca can you say Amen got to G that
[1:35:48] up bride see wherefore gir up the loens
[1:35:52] of your mind be sober
[1:35:54] and hope to the end for the grace that
[1:35:56] is to be brought unto you at the
[1:35:58] revelation of Jesus Christ as everybody
[1:36:01] say as
[1:36:04] obedient
[1:36:06] children as obedient children not
[1:36:11] fashioning yourself according to the
[1:36:12] former lusts in your
[1:36:16] ignorance see you're now becoming to
[1:36:19] know the will of
[1:36:21] God and when we you know there's things
[1:36:24] that before we come into the message we
[1:36:26] allowed there's things that even when we
[1:36:28] come into the message we allowed but as
[1:36:30] we begin to grow in God and the
[1:36:33] knowledge of God's will becomes a
[1:36:35] revelation to us we start putting those
[1:36:38] things away that we may put on the new
[1:36:43] man can you say Amen this is exactly
[1:36:46] when he finds character then he's going
[1:36:48] to get her ready that's
[1:36:51] right can you say man
[1:36:54] so as obedient children not fashioning
[1:36:56] yourselves according to the former lust
[1:36:58] in your ignorance but as he which hath
[1:37:01] called you is Holy so be ye holy in all
[1:37:06] matter of behavior or lifestyle
[1:37:09] conversation because it is written be ye
[1:37:13] holy for I am
[1:37:16] Holy can you say Amen I'm going to read
[1:37:20] another one first Peter and then we
[1:37:22] we'll try Tove move on a little bit but
[1:37:24] 1 Peter 3:1 this is a little lengthy but
[1:37:27] it says likewise you wives be in
[1:37:30] subjection to your own
[1:37:32] husbands that if any obey not the word
[1:37:35] they they also May without the word be
[1:37:38] won by the conversation or behavior of
[1:37:40] the
[1:37:41] wives while they behold your Chase
[1:37:45] conversation Behavior lifestyle coupled
[1:37:48] with fear whose adorning let it not be
[1:37:52] that outward dorning of plating the hair
[1:37:55] and of wearing of gold and putting on of
[1:37:58] apparel now people get stopped on that
[1:38:02] and they you know then they want to put
[1:38:04] on legal
[1:38:05] things uh you know to where you can't
[1:38:08] wear a necklace you can't wear this you
[1:38:10] can't do that can't put your hair up in
[1:38:11] braids and and all that and we know what
[1:38:14] a prophet taught so what Paul is trying
[1:38:17] to tell us is don't don't just look at
[1:38:20] the beauty on the outside don't f focus
[1:38:23] on that because that's not what's going
[1:38:25] to win win that's not going to win
[1:38:28] people that's not going to win your
[1:38:30] spouse or whatever what it is is that
[1:38:33] beauty on the inside a
[1:38:38] character can you say Amen see they're
[1:38:41] going to be hold your Chase conversation
[1:38:44] your lifestyle your
[1:38:48] behavior Can you say
[1:38:50] Amen Let It Be fourth verse but let it
[1:38:53] it be the hidden man of the heart in
[1:38:57] that which is not corruptible even the
[1:39:00] ornament of Meek of a Meek and quiet
[1:39:03] Spirit which is in the sight of God a
[1:39:07] great
[1:39:11] price we're focusing too much on our
[1:39:14] outside appearance brother brand says
[1:39:15] that it's all right if you ladies want
[1:39:17] to be pretty he said that's fine but
[1:39:20] don't get it carried away now don't
[1:39:23] start looking like them
[1:39:25] Jezebels don't start looking like the
[1:39:27] world out there you worry about that
[1:39:30] beauty in the
[1:39:33] heart can you say amen that's right and
[1:39:37] US husband we shouldn't be wanting
[1:39:38] beauty queens out like that out in the
[1:39:40] world we shouldn't put pressure on our
[1:39:43] wives to feel like they have to compete
[1:39:45] with that out
[1:39:46] there you understand what I'm saying you
[1:39:49] got a wife that is serving God and
[1:39:51] treating your children right you ought
[1:39:53] to respect that woman with all your
[1:39:55] heart and if you don't God's going to
[1:39:56] judge you for
[1:39:58] that and that's the
[1:40:02] truth they ain't your they you know our
[1:40:05] wives ain't our door
[1:40:07] matat that we wipe our feet
[1:40:11] onen
[1:40:13] right being subjection now he says then
[1:40:17] that's of of great price ornament of a
[1:40:20] Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the
[1:40:22] sight of God of great price for after
[1:40:25] this manner in the old time the holy
[1:40:27] women also who trusted in God adorned
[1:40:30] themselves being in subject unto their
[1:40:32] own
[1:40:33] husbands now we all know good and well
[1:40:36] that that that's going out the door
[1:40:40] too can you say Amen it's women's
[1:40:45] rights it's telling woman the wife
[1:40:48] telling the husband what to
[1:40:51] do right right
[1:40:53] and we're finding out there ain't much
[1:40:55] Beauty inside they might all be Beauty
[1:40:58] out here and stuck out
[1:41:02] everywhere but they're more of a well
[1:41:05] brother Brown would call him a
[1:41:08] witch he called him you know he called a
[1:41:12] lot of
[1:41:15] things but he said a no good woman is
[1:41:17] water and a man's blood he said you get
[1:41:20] a man that get a good woman it's the
[1:41:21] best thing outside of salvation he could
[1:41:24] get can you say amen I think God gave me
[1:41:27] the best thing outside of Salvation when
[1:41:30] he gave me my
[1:41:31] wife ain't that right but he said a new
[1:41:34] a No Good
[1:41:36] Woman it'll kill a guy he's water in the
[1:41:40] blood water get water in your blood
[1:41:43] going to kill you can you say Amen so
[1:41:46] being subjection unto their own
[1:41:50] husbands even as Sarah obeyed Abraham am
[1:41:53] calling him Lord that's right whose
[1:41:56] daughters you are as long as you do well
[1:42:00] and are not afraid with any amazement
[1:42:03] likewise you husbands dwell with them
[1:42:06] according to knowledge giving honor unto
[1:42:08] the wife as unto the weaker
[1:42:11] vessel hello don't try to make your
[1:42:15] husbands the weaker
[1:42:16] vessel God says you ladies are the
[1:42:19] weaker vessel and husbands are to treat
[1:42:22] their wives as being such and not to
[1:42:24] belittle them and not to tear them
[1:42:26] down can you say
[1:42:28] amen that's right see but uh as so he
[1:42:33] says giving honor unto the wife as unto
[1:42:36] the weaker vessel and as being hirs
[1:42:39] together of the grace of life that your
[1:42:42] prayers be not
[1:42:46] hindered finally now notice be ye all of
[1:42:52] One mind
[1:42:55] are you with me notice having compassion
[1:42:59] one of another love as Brethren be
[1:43:03] pitiful be
[1:43:06] courteous not rendering evil for evil or
[1:43:10] railing for railing other words I'm
[1:43:13] going to get back at them
[1:43:15] someday right see not not that but
[1:43:19] contrarywise
[1:43:22] blessing knowing that you are there unto
[1:43:26] called that you should inherit a
[1:43:29] blessing hello give a blessing whether
[1:43:33] they deserve it or
[1:43:37] not for he that will love life and see
[1:43:40] good day uh days let him refrain his
[1:43:45] tongue from evil and his lips that they
[1:43:48] speak no
[1:43:49] guile let him assure evil shun evil and
[1:43:54] do good let him seek peace and ensue it
[1:43:59] can you say amen that's so so we see
[1:44:02] that a a prophet had to come the word
[1:44:04] always comes to a prophet Amos 3:7
[1:44:07] surely the Lord will do nothing but he
[1:44:10] revealeth his secret unto his servants
[1:44:13] the prophet and then then we were taught
[1:44:16] that a prophet must be Vindicated that
[1:44:20] that Prophet has to be Vindicated by God
[1:44:23] and it has to be scriptural
[1:44:26] Vindication can you say Amen now notice
[1:44:29] brother Brandon would tell us how it
[1:44:31] pleases God to find his children
[1:44:34] obedient to his word not on little isms
[1:44:38] but obedient to the word amen not
[1:44:41] obedient to the church but obedient to
[1:44:44] the word see not obedient to what they
[1:44:47] feel and what they want to do and what
[1:44:49] they want to say and how they want to
[1:44:50] handle things but obedient to the word
[1:44:53] see that is the thing that's going to
[1:44:56] stand this is the blueprint this is the
[1:44:59] standard this is the only thing and
[1:45:01] whosoever shall take away or add to the
[1:45:05] same will be taken his part from The
[1:45:07] Book of Life I don't want anything less
[1:45:11] than this Bible has puts in here and I
[1:45:14] don't want anything more than what it
[1:45:17] says can you say
[1:45:19] amen
[1:45:21] amen so so you see there is a a a uh a
[1:45:27] conduct now first John 2 and one we'll
[1:45:33] read down to the sixth verse but it says
[1:45:35] my little children these things I write
[1:45:36] unto you that you sin not everybody say
[1:45:39] sin not that you sin not and if any man
[1:45:43] sin we have an advocate with the father
[1:45:47] Jesus Christ the
[1:45:49] righteous and he is the propitiation for
[1:45:53] our sins and not for ours only but also
[1:45:56] for the sins of the whole world and
[1:45:58] hereby we do know that we know
[1:46:02] him
[1:46:03] if we keep his
[1:46:06] Commandments hereby we know that we know
[1:46:09] him if we keep his Commandments amen he
[1:46:13] that saith I know him and keepeth not
[1:46:15] his Commandments is a liar right and the
[1:46:18] truth is not in him but whosoever
[1:46:20] keepeth his word in him barely is the
[1:46:23] love of God perfected hereby know we
[1:46:27] that we are in him he that saith he
[1:46:30] abideth in him ought himself
[1:46:33] also also so to walk even as he
[1:46:38] walked can you say Amen so you see where
[1:46:41] we're at is we're at the revealing of
[1:46:43] the son of man and it wasn't just
[1:46:46] applying to brother brandham it was
[1:46:47] applying to a Rebecca a
[1:46:50] bride that we would come up up into a
[1:46:53] place that that no other age has come
[1:46:57] to and and Jesus Christ himself can be
[1:47:04] manifested we we say well yeah we're
[1:47:06] going to speak mountains and we're going
[1:47:07] to speak things into existence let's get
[1:47:10] the
[1:47:12] character walk as he walked the
[1:47:15] character that he had was to do the will
[1:47:18] of the
[1:47:19] father ain't that right so so then we
[1:47:23] find that God wants us to keep his
[1:47:25] Commandments his word which is his word
[1:47:29] notice 2 Corinthians 10:5 now this is
[1:47:32] the battle this is the struggles this is
[1:47:34] this are the things that we are being
[1:47:37] proven on through the
[1:47:40] testings notice what we are to do 2
[1:47:43] Corinthians 10:5 casting down
[1:47:46] imaginations who going to do that God
[1:47:49] going to do that no you're going to do
[1:47:50] that casting down IM imaginations and
[1:47:54] every High thing that exalteth itself
[1:47:57] against the knowledge of God the word
[1:48:00] can you say Amen the knowledge of the
[1:48:02] word and bringing into captivity every
[1:48:06] thought to The Obedience of Christ the
[1:48:10] word ain't that right now we can't go
[1:48:14] around making everybody Christians we're
[1:48:17] not called to do
[1:48:19] that yes it would be nice if we could
[1:48:21] get Bazookas and all these things and
[1:48:23] put it to people's heads and empty the
[1:48:25] bar fill the church up force people to
[1:48:29] say Amen force people to love God force
[1:48:31] people to be divine Christians you can't
[1:48:34] do that you can't do what people do you
[1:48:37] can't you you can't uh uh uh how people
[1:48:40] treat you you you can't you you can't
[1:48:43] take care of that you you can't make
[1:48:47] people treat you better than and and and
[1:48:49] and people love you and people this and
[1:48:52] people that so that's not what Paul is
[1:48:54] is saying casting down am man you know
[1:48:57] people got it into their mind casting
[1:48:59] down you know we're going to just make
[1:49:00] the world a better place and and and
[1:49:03] that's that's what I think the Muslims
[1:49:05] they want everybody to be Muslims and
[1:49:07] you know every religion wants everybody
[1:49:09] to be what they are but that's not what
[1:49:12] we're worried about we can't help
[1:49:14] politicians and we can't help what
[1:49:16] they're doing out there we can't help
[1:49:18] that they drink and that they smoke and
[1:49:20] that they you know uh rape and they you
[1:49:23] know they all it's horrible but we can't
[1:49:26] help them
[1:49:28] things so then what we've got to do is
[1:49:33] us the imaginations that come to us we
[1:49:38] can break that down I can't help what
[1:49:41] you do but I can help what I
[1:49:44] do casting down imaginations and every
[1:49:48] High thing that exalted itself against
[1:49:50] the knowledge of God how where we going
[1:49:52] to cast that down every thought
[1:49:55] everything that tries to build up within
[1:49:57] us that is contrary to this cast it
[1:50:01] down Hallelujah don't let bitterness get
[1:50:04] in don't let that lust take
[1:50:07] root don't let envy and and strife come
[1:50:10] in don't let that Spirit of division
[1:50:12] take
[1:50:15] over every High thing that exalted
[1:50:18] itself against the knowledge of the word
[1:50:21] the knowledge of God
[1:50:23] bringing down bringing into captivity
[1:50:26] think of that now you have the ability
[1:50:29] to bring it into
[1:50:32] captivity prise Lord to The Obedience of
[1:50:36] the word obedience of Christ can you say
[1:50:39] Amen now we looking at Christ Hebrews
[1:50:42] 5'8 speaking of Jesus said though he
[1:50:45] were a son yet he learned obedience by
[1:50:47] the things he suffered brother brand
[1:50:49] said well then what was he obedient to
[1:50:52] the word that's right the word he knew
[1:50:56] that the word spoke of him he knew that
[1:51:00] the scriptures he was the
[1:51:05] Messiah don't you get it the same
[1:51:07] Revelation that came to him is coming to
[1:51:10] us we know we are that Rebecca we know
[1:51:15] we are that
[1:51:17] bride right so he had to bring that body
[1:51:22] in subjection to this
[1:51:26] word his flesh didn't want to be
[1:51:28] despised and
[1:51:30] rejected his old flesh didn't want to
[1:51:32] carry that cross up to up to Calvary his
[1:51:36] flesh didn't want to just go there and
[1:51:38] lay his life down and let him nail him
[1:51:41] and stripe his back with you know and
[1:51:43] his blood re blood running down and all
[1:51:46] these things no his flesh didn't want to
[1:51:49] it cried out if it be thy will let this
[1:51:52] cup but he had a character about him
[1:51:56] that said even so thy will be done he
[1:52:01] knew he couldn't pass the
[1:52:03] book and I say this you cannot pass the
[1:52:07] book to another generation you're that
[1:52:12] generation somebody going to make this
[1:52:14] word
[1:52:19] live somebody going to flow in unity
[1:52:22] somebody going to have the power and the
[1:52:24] ability to lay their life
[1:52:26] [Music]
[1:52:27] down for the word's
[1:52:30] sake can you say
[1:52:32] Amen somebody going to walk in the will
[1:52:34] of God see so so you know Jesus he was
[1:52:39] to fulfill the word for his day and he
[1:52:42] couldn't do that without becoming
[1:52:44] obedient to the
[1:52:47] word amen can you say
[1:52:50] Amen you know good and well that Satan
[1:52:52] was offering all kinds of things outside
[1:52:55] of Calvary sure offering and trying to
[1:52:58] show good things I you know now now he
[1:53:01] knew Jesus knew that it took a Calvary
[1:53:03] for him to inherit amen the kingdoms but
[1:53:06] what was Satan trying to do I'll give
[1:53:07] you the kingdoms come on they're in my
[1:53:09] hands I'll give them to you you don't
[1:53:10] have to go to Calvary I'll give them to
[1:53:12] yourself myself but Jesus knew that
[1:53:15] wasn't the will of the
[1:53:18] father I know brother Bram said they're
[1:53:21] trying to make they're trying to make
[1:53:22] make a millennium without
[1:53:24] repentance but before Millennium can
[1:53:26] happen repentance has got to take place
[1:53:29] can you say Amen they want to make a
[1:53:31] millennium Amen to where they can live
[1:53:33] in adultery and they can live with every
[1:53:35] wife and every woman and every man and
[1:53:38] man with man and woman with woman and
[1:53:40] rebel against the word but there's a
[1:53:43] bride that realizes that's father that's
[1:53:46] going to be
[1:53:48] destroyed we must come to an obedience
[1:53:51] to the word before before the Millennium
[1:53:53] can take
[1:53:57] place see so Jesus had the right
[1:54:01] character for he said my meat is to do
[1:54:04] the will of the
[1:54:06] father another place I do nothing but
[1:54:08] what the father first show me that's it
[1:54:10] Hebrews 4:15 tells us that he was in all
[1:54:14] points tempted like as we are yet
[1:54:16] without sin can you say Amen brother
[1:54:20] Braham said see he was an obedient son
[1:54:22] every step was for the father everything
[1:54:26] he done was to glorify God not glorify
[1:54:29] himself not to brag and say look what
[1:54:32] I've
[1:54:36] done and he says and we seen God in
[1:54:39] Christ that's
[1:54:41] it we saw God in
[1:54:45] Christ right why he' done the will of
[1:54:48] the father his meat was to do the will
[1:54:52] he done nothing but what the father
[1:54:54] first showed him he was his whole breath
[1:54:57] his whole the whole fiber of his being
[1:55:00] was to glorify God and we saw God in
[1:55:05] him amen now God wants to be reflected
[1:55:09] in Us in the same way
[1:55:16] amen he said see no man has seen the
[1:55:18] father at any time but the only begotten
[1:55:20] of the son has declared him the very
[1:55:23] move the very action everything that
[1:55:26] Christ did was God working in him well
[1:55:30] so then notice brother Bram said then
[1:55:33] when he come to his adoption how many
[1:55:35] beli Jesus was adopted I know people
[1:55:38] don't believe that these days but Jesus
[1:55:40] actually was adopted brother brandham
[1:55:41] says that and his adoption took place on
[1:55:44] Mount Transfiguration that's right right
[1:55:47] and and and so when so we won't get into
[1:55:51] all that but brother Brandon says when
[1:55:53] he come into His adoption that's when
[1:55:57] all powers in Heaven and Earth was given
[1:56:00] unto him think of
[1:56:03] that isn't that
[1:56:05] wonderful now if you go back in that
[1:56:07] ninth verse Hebrews uh uh uh you know I
[1:56:12] don't know what it was now but the
[1:56:14] Hebrews but he says and being made
[1:56:17] perfect speaking of Jesus and being made
[1:56:20] perfect he became the author of Eternal
[1:56:24] salvation unto all them that oh B him
[1:56:32] right he become the author of Eternal
[1:56:36] salvation unto all them who has the same
[1:56:39] character as
[1:56:41] him being tested being proven and yet
[1:56:46] being
[1:56:49] obedient you see God has a way of doing
[1:56:52] things and we must follow that
[1:56:55] way his rules and his rules are not
[1:56:58] outside of his word I won't keep much
[1:57:02] longer but according to Daniel 9
[1:57:05] and10 God's law are set his laws we'll
[1:57:10] say his word are they're set before us
[1:57:14] by his servants the
[1:57:17] prophets so it isn't that we come into
[1:57:20] that just anybody can and put rules of
[1:57:24] dos and don'ts on us because there's a
[1:57:27] lot of men that have become
[1:57:30] dictators and they have brought us under
[1:57:33] legalism and they have beat us bow breed
[1:57:36] us beat us they've done all kinds of
[1:57:39] stuff and with just being sheep you
[1:57:42] don't know what to do and and you just
[1:57:44] knuckle down to it but then we find that
[1:57:49] Jesus said but my sheep hear my voice
[1:57:52] and so when the voice of God come
[1:57:54] through a prophet all of a sudden we
[1:57:58] looked at that old Taskmaster and we
[1:58:00] said I you can't beat me like that no
[1:58:05] more Prophet didn't say it that
[1:58:09] way oh you're misinterpreting it because
[1:58:12] the prophet didn't do it that way right
[1:58:15] and he brought us into a
[1:58:17] balance of the
[1:58:20] word so see God's laws are set before us
[1:58:24] by his servants the prophets a
[1:58:27] Vindicated Prophet is God's voice to
[1:58:31] us amen you believe that now the prophet
[1:58:36] said the voice of God copes with the
[1:58:39] scripture if it doesn't then there's
[1:58:42] some kind of a wrong voice speaking to
[1:58:45] you but the right voice will tell you to
[1:58:48] follow the rules of the Bible no
[1:58:50] sprinkling no point ing no fosle see he
[1:58:55] says come right straight out and follow
[1:58:58] the rules of the Bible so then no man is
[1:59:01] sent to get this bride
[1:59:04] ready other than our
[1:59:06] elaser which is a prophet of Malachi
[1:59:10] 4 that's what's going to get us
[1:59:14] ready amen I know we've lived in fear of
[1:59:18] men's rules but you don't have to fear
[1:59:23] just listen to a voice of a prophet and
[1:59:26] get
[1:59:27] [Music]
[1:59:32] ready in the
[1:59:34] beginning God required the first man and
[1:59:36] first woman to obey his word and he has
[1:59:39] never changed on that am God actually
[1:59:42] rejected Cain's
[1:59:44] sacrifice because it wasn't according to
[1:59:47] the Revelation that had been
[1:59:49] given brother Bram said when you leave
[1:59:52] he said you leave Christ when you fail
[1:59:55] to obey his
[1:59:58] word he doesn't leave you you leave him
[2:00:03] yeah amen and you leave
[2:00:05] him when you fail to obbey his word so
[2:00:10] then you might have experienced you know
[2:00:12] we talked about Wednesday night about
[2:00:15] the three works of Grace you might have
[2:00:17] experienced the first work of Grace
[2:00:20] justification and
[2:00:23] you you might have come on in from there
[2:00:25] you might have come into the second work
[2:00:29] of Grace which is
[2:00:31] sanctification you may have even come
[2:00:33] further than that and come into that
[2:00:35] third work of Grace which is the baptism
[2:00:38] of the Holy Ghost and and and you've got
[2:00:40] to come into them steps right now now
[2:00:43] remember a pro the Pentecost is remember
[2:00:46] the prophet kept telling the you think
[2:00:48] you've arrived you got the Holy Ghost
[2:00:50] you think you've arrived you this is it
[2:00:53] he said you're just
[2:00:55] beginning you've got to leave there and
[2:00:59] come on in to that next which is
[2:01:04] adoption can you say Amen see you you
[2:01:08] you got to follow on to get
[2:01:12] ripened and you got to lay in the
[2:01:14] presence of the
[2:01:17] Sun and in order for us to lay in the
[2:01:20] presence of the son that pentec costal
[2:01:22] Shu had to pull
[2:01:24] away talking about
[2:01:26] hard that legalism had to pull
[2:01:29] away that that that you know acting as
[2:01:33] children with gifts had to pull away all
[2:01:36] that unbelief had to pull away
[2:01:37] everything just had to away from
[2:01:40] us talking about
[2:01:43] hard but you got to come to the full
[2:01:46] manifestation of the promised word
[2:01:48] Pentecostal did not do that
[2:01:53] Lutheran didn't do that Wesley didn't do
[2:01:55] that that's our
[2:01:58] place we've come out of her my people
[2:02:01] right we've heard that we've come out we
[2:02:04] followed we've
[2:02:06] obeyed to come to the full promise or
[2:02:09] full manifestation of the promised word
[2:02:13] can you say Amen now in order to do that
[2:02:15] brother brah said a man has to come
[2:02:17] right back to the spot where he left him
[2:02:19] and he said when you hear the word come
[2:02:22] right back it's truly the word of God
[2:02:24] see there's a little buzzer Rings you
[2:02:27] better listen to it don't walk across
[2:02:29] that cuz you'll never get any further
[2:02:32] until you come right back here where you
[2:02:35] left him can you say Amen if if you're
[2:02:39] not coming any further in God stop right
[2:02:42] there and say okay where did I leave him
[2:02:47] where did I keep following or quit
[2:02:49] following him what what was was I
[2:02:52] hanging on to that I shouldn't be
[2:02:53] hanging on to is that little bitterness
[2:02:55] is that little gripe is that little is
[2:02:58] it that little indifference toward my
[2:02:59] brother is is it is it you know whatever
[2:03:03] God is trying to get me to do and I'm
[2:03:04] being so headstrong well God God ain't
[2:03:07] going to bless you you ain't going to
[2:03:08] get any
[2:03:10] further until you come back where you
[2:03:12] left
[2:03:15] him amen can you say
[2:03:20] Amen brother Bram says another place the
[2:03:22] only way to follow God is obey his word
[2:03:25] how many wants to follow him that's
[2:03:27] right well to follow him is to obey his
[2:03:30] word I'm going to follow you lord well
[2:03:32] when you say that that means I'm going
[2:03:34] to obey your word whatever you ask of me
[2:03:37] can you sayen so to follow his word now
[2:03:41] then we have to forsake our own thoughts
[2:03:43] when they are contrary to his word we we
[2:03:47] have to forsake our friends when they go
[2:03:49] contrary to the word we have to forsake
[2:03:51] our own
[2:03:52] feelings brother this
[2:03:54] hurts we have to forsake our own
[2:03:57] feelings when they become contrary to
[2:03:59] the word we have to forsake our own
[2:04:01] beliefs when they go contrary to the
[2:04:04] word of God can you say Amen see so a
[2:04:07] prophet remember is not God didn't send
[2:04:10] a prophet just to preach a good
[2:04:12] message now I'll be honest you know you
[2:04:15] you go hear you go hear some of these
[2:04:17] ministers out there and please don't
[2:04:19] take me wrong by any means
[2:04:22] but you hear some of these ministers
[2:04:24] that are just profound
[2:04:26] profound preachers and I'm talking about
[2:04:29] in the secular World Christendom I mean
[2:04:32] they can they they they can have people
[2:04:35] shouting you know have people on their
[2:04:37] feet through the whole sermon and I mean
[2:04:40] eloquent words I mean
[2:04:42] power but God when when a Prophet come
[2:04:47] he didn't have a lot of
[2:04:50] that he even said I don't even have a
[2:04:52] personality to give to the people that's
[2:04:55] what he said he said I told my wife I
[2:04:57] ain't even got a personality why are
[2:04:59] these people coming amen he' just stand
[2:05:03] there good evening friends you know and
[2:05:06] he' just begin to deliver the word and
[2:05:08] most of the time he was balling people
[2:05:10] out chewing the denominations he loved
[2:05:13] the people but he said I'm branded as a
[2:05:16] woman hater he said I don't hate women
[2:05:19] he says they're my I love my sister
[2:05:22] he said but it's the thing that they're
[2:05:24] doing see so he didn't come just to
[2:05:26] preach A good sermon but what he was he
[2:05:30] was God's
[2:05:32] stonemason and and he come see remember
[2:05:36] he come to find that character and then
[2:05:38] to get her ready once he found that
[2:05:40] character see and he'd come as a
[2:05:42] stonemason to cut them Stones remember
[2:05:45] brother Bram said what good is our
[2:05:46] testimony he said testimony is Stones
[2:05:49] what good is the testimony if there's no
[2:05:51] stonemason to cut to shape them
[2:05:53] testimonies shape them stones into Sons
[2:05:56] and Daughters of God so this message
[2:06:03] hurts
[2:06:04] amen hope you
[2:06:07] understand brother Braham said now I
[2:06:09] said to brother sism and brother
[2:06:12] NES to your an to to your answer
[2:06:17] question I said now I don't take neither
[2:06:20] s either sides with you bre
[2:06:22] I I know as long as you fuss you're both
[2:06:25] wrong because I would rather be wrong in
[2:06:27] my Doctrine and right in my heart than
[2:06:29] to be right in my Doctrine and wrong in
[2:06:31] my heart after all it's your heart's
[2:06:34] condition now what's he doing he's
[2:06:36] shaping he's cutting that's a stonemason
[2:06:41] ameno right he said I made that a
[2:06:44] practice to know this that if a man no
[2:06:46] matter what he does and how much he
[2:06:49] differ and what he says about me if in
[2:06:51] my heart not from just a duty but from
[2:06:54] my heart I can't love that man as well
[2:06:56] as I love anyone else then I know
[2:06:58] there's something wrong in here what's
[2:07:00] he doing he's shaping he's cutting him
[2:07:04] Stones
[2:07:06] right another place here's how you get
[2:07:09] into this Fellowship how do you get it
[2:07:11] brother brandom how do you how do you
[2:07:13] ever get into this Fellowship through
[2:07:14] the shedding of the blood not from some
[2:07:16] experience no sir not from some
[2:07:19] emotional mental emotion no sir sir not
[2:07:22] from some bodily exercise no sir them
[2:07:25] things are all right as good as they may
[2:07:27] be but yet that's not the foundation
[2:07:29] truth leave that set over here to one
[2:07:31] side till you get back right here uh
[2:07:35] back here till you get to the Altar and
[2:07:38] all old things pass away a peace that
[2:07:41] passes all understanding comes in till
[2:07:43] you can't you can hate no more you can
[2:07:46] Envy no more until something that makes
[2:07:48] you love the worst enemy you've ever had
[2:07:51] not imagination but something that'll
[2:07:53] keep you from talking about the neighbor
[2:07:55] that persecutes you something that'll
[2:07:58] make you love those who despitefully use
[2:08:00] you it'll make you pray for those who
[2:08:02] are indifferent and ugly towards you
[2:08:05] that's the
[2:08:06] foundation can you say Amen see and so
[2:08:10] then notice how all this fits with what
[2:08:13] Jesus said Matthew 5:44 I say unto you
[2:08:16] love your enemies bless them that curse
[2:08:18] you do good to them that hate you and
[2:08:20] pray for them which despitefully use you
[2:08:23] and persecute you ain't that right see
[2:08:26] so that's the very words that Jesus has
[2:08:28] said now look brother Braham said when
[2:08:30] you go on the street to rub arms with
[2:08:33] the world tomorrow brother sister have
[2:08:35] you got the thinking man's filter when
[2:08:37] when that man calls you a Holy Roller do
[2:08:39] you have a thinken man's filter when
[2:08:42] that somebody said something evil
[2:08:44] against you do you have a thinking man's
[2:08:46] filter see do good for evil pray for
[2:08:49] those that despitefully use you and
[2:08:51] those who persecute you then you're
[2:08:53] breathing through the thinking man's
[2:08:55] filter if you love those who just love
[2:08:58] you as we shook one another's hands as
[2:09:01] dearly beloved in the Lord that's good
[2:09:03] but can you also love the unlovable
[2:09:06] that's the thinking man's filter that's
[2:09:08] the spirit of Christ in you loving those
[2:09:10] who don't love you then you have the
[2:09:13] reward of God but now if you do that as
[2:09:16] a duty you still haven't got the
[2:09:18] thinking man see you're only up in the
[2:09:20] second side
[2:09:21] but it's from your heart you really love
[2:09:24] him then you're breathing through the
[2:09:26] thinking man's filter and it satisfies a
[2:09:29] holy man's taste that you know from your
[2:09:32] heart you forgive everybody everything
[2:09:35] uh no matter what taken place
[2:09:39] amen and Jesus says in John
[2:09:42] 13:35 by this all men shall know your my
[2:09:45] disciples if you have love one to
[2:09:48] another amen ain't that right
[2:09:52] amen this is a common quote that that we
[2:09:56] know but I'm going to read it and I hope
[2:09:58] this all right this morning it says love
[2:10:01] one another above everything love one
[2:10:04] another no matter everybody say no
[2:10:08] matter no matter no matter what the
[2:10:10] devil tries to say now you're all one
[2:10:13] great big sweet group now but remember
[2:10:16] my
[2:10:17] warning Satan won't let it stay that way
[2:10:21] no sir he'll shoot everything if he has
[2:10:23] to bring somebody in to make his Target
[2:10:25] he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in
[2:10:27] set him down and cause him to fellowship
[2:10:29] with you under the quietness of things
[2:10:32] quietness and things and then he'll
[2:10:34] shoot that guy with some kind of a
[2:10:36] poison stuff and he'll start through the
[2:10:38] church with it don't you take sides with
[2:10:41] it don't you have nothing to do with
[2:10:44] anything else you stay right loving and
[2:10:48] sweet and kind to one another pray for
[2:10:51] that man that he'll be saved too or that
[2:10:53] woman or whoever it is just pray for
[2:10:56] them and stick one with another stay
[2:10:58] with your pastor he's the shepherd and
[2:11:01] you give him respects he'll lead you
[2:11:02] through and because he's ordained of God
[2:11:05] to do so now do you remember that he
[2:11:09] asks the enemy will come when he does
[2:11:13] just cling that much closer together and
[2:11:16] the one the devil is using for an enemy
[2:11:18] will either get out or come in and be
[2:11:20] one of you you that's all don't never
[2:11:24] Clan among one another or talk or make
[2:11:27] yourself clannish we are one can you say
[2:11:31] that with me we are one we are one see
[2:11:35] he says I couldn't say left hand I'm mad
[2:11:37] at you I'm going to take you away cuz
[2:11:39] you're not a right hand he's my left
[2:11:42] hand I want him to stay there even the
[2:11:44] little tip of my finger I want to stay
[2:11:47] right there every little part of my body
[2:11:48] stay right there and God wants us us as
[2:11:51] a body of Believers to stay right
[2:11:53] exactly with one another right at at
[2:11:56] with one another now you've got tapes on
[2:11:58] that you've got tapes on what we believe
[2:12:00] you got tapes on discipline in the
[2:12:02] church and how we behave oursel in the
[2:12:03] Church of God how we got to come here
[2:12:06] together and sit together in Heavenly
[2:12:07] places don't stay home amen you see what
[2:12:12] he's doing he's shaping amen he's found
[2:12:16] a a a Rebecca with
[2:12:19] character now he's going to get ready
[2:12:22] why is he saying this because we we
[2:12:25] fight these things
[2:12:28] Church there's a move going on that
[2:12:30] people can just stay home listen to the
[2:12:32] T press play and
[2:12:35] Obey and they stay home and you can tell
[2:12:39] them I I I I've asked them what about
[2:12:43] the Bible when it says forsake not the
[2:12:45] assembling of yourselves together even
[2:12:47] that more as you see the day approaching
[2:12:49] totally don't even ask answer the
[2:12:52] question but see and I'm not saying that
[2:12:55] they're bad
[2:12:57] people you know I pray for them and you
[2:13:00] know I'm somehow believing they're going
[2:13:01] to make it but I'm just saying here's a
[2:13:04] prophet saying don't stay home if God is
[2:13:07] in your heart you can't hardly wait for
[2:13:10] them doors to open out yonder to get in
[2:13:12] here to fellowship with your brothers
[2:13:14] and if you don't feel that way then I
[2:13:16] tell you it's time you got to praying
[2:13:18] can can you say Amen see because we're
[2:13:21] in the last days where the Bible
[2:13:24] exhorted us much more as we see the day
[2:13:26] approaching to love one another with
[2:13:28] Christian love and divine love to
[2:13:30] assemble ourselves together in Heavenly
[2:13:32] places in Jesus Christ and love one
[2:13:34] another this will all men know you're my
[2:13:36] disciples when you have L one for
[2:13:37] another see that's right stay right
[2:13:40] together now if the brother you think
[2:13:42] he's a little wrong or the sister say
[2:13:44] Lord don't let me ever have the root of
[2:13:48] bitterness spring up because it'll
[2:13:50] affect him
[2:13:51] and it'll take the Christ right out of
[2:13:53] my life see so it's not just that you
[2:13:57] can you can look at them with an evil
[2:13:58] eye and you really think you're hurting
[2:14:01] them but really what you're doing is
[2:14:02] you're taking the Christ out of your
[2:14:05] very life see if your own see so that
[2:14:09] poison acids of malice and jealousy and
[2:14:11] hatred that'll just take the Holy Spirit
[2:14:13] right away from you it'll run him from
[2:14:15] the Tabernacle here it'll kill the
[2:14:17] spirit of God or drive it away from here
[2:14:18] hurt your pastor it'll do everything
[2:14:21] don't you do that you just wax that much
[2:14:24] closer together take the Buckle as the
[2:14:27] brother testified a minister here other
[2:14:29] night about having a buckle seeing it in
[2:14:31] a vision that buckles on the whole armor
[2:14:33] of God just pull her on tighten up move
[2:14:36] right up close to one another love one
[2:14:39] another anyhow talk nice about one
[2:14:41] another say nice things about one
[2:14:43] another and then God will bless you and
[2:14:47] Rebecca
[2:14:48] says amen
[2:14:51] amen that's
[2:14:54] good I'll be
[2:14:56] honest people tend to lock up when you
[2:14:58] read that quote or other
[2:15:03] quotes like that and and and and
[2:15:06] sometimes it tends to lock a church
[2:15:09] up because they think they're getting
[2:15:11] preached at or they think there's
[2:15:12] something going on in the church and
[2:15:14] pastors trying to correct it now that's
[2:15:16] not true that that's not
[2:15:19] today but brothers and
[2:15:21] sisters I'm not preaching this for any
[2:15:24] particular reason except that God's just
[2:15:26] laid it on my
[2:15:29] heart and I
[2:15:33] know as as as the minister of a
[2:15:37] gospel I know what testings and trials
[2:15:42] are and this old preacher has had
[2:15:46] to get alone and shed real just tears
[2:15:51] crying out to God for Mercy for
[2:15:54] me that my heart don't get
[2:15:58] bitter
[2:16:00] and that I become so full of hurt
[2:16:07] anger
[2:16:09] and and so I'm I'm here just laying this
[2:16:12] before you that these quotes are for me
[2:16:14] just as
[2:16:18] well because I I know know sometimes you
[2:16:21] don't see God in the
[2:16:24] trials sometimes you just wonder that
[2:16:26] maybe he's left you alone
[2:16:30] or that he's just doing it because maybe
[2:16:33] you've done wrong or you know and you
[2:16:36] can start holding guilt or you can start
[2:16:39] whatever but that's not true none of us
[2:16:42] like trials how many likes trials y'all
[2:16:45] like trials buddy I don't like
[2:16:48] trials if I had the opportunity to to
[2:16:51] pray that God would take them away which
[2:16:53] I
[2:16:54] have God please take this away I really
[2:16:57] don't want
[2:16:59] it and somehow he doesn't take it
[2:17:05] away and there's times that I have to
[2:17:08] just expose my heart and just have to
[2:17:09] lay before God with I can't even I don't
[2:17:12] even know what to
[2:17:14] pray but just God you know my heart
[2:17:18] amen God help me
[2:17:21] and and when thoughts be start coming in
[2:17:24] and you know how it is you start
[2:17:26] thoughts start coming in and you start
[2:17:28] forming situations before they've ever
[2:17:31] happened if I met so and so and all of a
[2:17:34] sudden just start things start coming
[2:17:37] and starts getting into a bad
[2:17:39] shape when them things start taking
[2:17:42] place I find myself just praying for
[2:17:45] that individual God please help that
[2:17:49] individual God helping somehow if
[2:17:51] they're in the wrong help them if I'm in
[2:17:53] the wrong please help me because why I I
[2:17:57] don't want to be
[2:17:59] bitter I I don't want the spirit of God
[2:18:02] to be taken from My
[2:18:04] Life True you understand what I'm saying
[2:18:07] and and I see that here's these quotes
[2:18:09] laying there and I realize that he ain't
[2:18:13] just preaching just to preach I'm that
[2:18:17] Rebecca and he's come to shape me he's
[2:18:20] come to take that trimming
[2:18:22] away I got to be a Son of
[2:18:26] God I I I'm coming into my
[2:18:30] inheritance you
[2:18:32] understand and so the shaping is there
[2:18:34] it shouldn't take our joy away from us
[2:18:37] it shouldn't take our peace from us we
[2:18:40] just got to lay at the altar before him
[2:18:42] and say God here I
[2:18:44] am do what you will with
[2:18:49] me brother Bram said the same thing
[2:18:51] about him that it it took molding it
[2:18:53] took shaping it took things to bring his
[2:18:57] ministry to where he was where it was
[2:18:59] can you amen you love the Lord
[2:19:02] am so we all deal with things from time
[2:19:06] to
[2:19:07] time and we're tempted in things and the
[2:19:10] world the pressure of the world is
[2:19:12] trying to pull on us you young people
[2:19:14] and things like that to where your
[2:19:17] marriage becomes just the
[2:19:19] common uh you know the the common number
[2:19:23] as as the others and your children
[2:19:25] become just the mediocre as the others
[2:19:28] and preachers just become preach the
[2:19:31] mediocre messages or we all live just a
[2:19:34] mediocre life and and I and I tell you
[2:19:37] we can't we can't give up we can't just
[2:19:40] lay
[2:19:42] down can you say
[2:19:44] amen amen I love the
[2:19:48] Lord so we find that the message is what
[2:19:51] shapes us if the musicians will come the
[2:19:55] message is what shapes us into being
[2:19:57] Sons and Daughters of
[2:19:59] God it is not something that we just
[2:20:01] reference make a reference to every now
[2:20:04] and
[2:20:07] then but it is something that is pure it
[2:20:10] is something that we should apply to our
[2:20:12] lives on a daily
[2:20:14] basis humble ourselves before the Lord
[2:20:17] can you say
[2:20:18] amen amen I love the Lord do you love
[2:20:23] him I know we could go more but we
[2:20:27] um used my time up but I maybe we could
[2:20:32] just sing that song I love him I love
[2:20:35] [Music]
[2:20:37] him oh
[2:20:40] I love
[2:20:42] [Music]
[2:20:44] him
[2:20:47] I love him
[2:20:51] because
[2:20:53] because he
[2:20:57] first loved
[2:20:59] [Music]
[2:21:02] me and
[2:21:05] per just
[2:21:08] [Music]
[2:21:15] my on C
[2:21:20] [Music]
[2:21:24] tree sing it
[2:21:26] again oh
[2:21:31] I love
[2:21:32] [Music]
[2:21:34] you
[2:21:37] I love you
[2:21:42] because he
[2:21:45] first loved me
[2:21:50] [Music]
[2:21:52] and
[2:21:54] per just
[2:21:57] my
[2:22:01] [Applause]
[2:22:03] salvation
[2:22:08] [Music]
[2:22:10] oh
[2:22:12] tree Jesus is the sweetest name oh Jesus
[2:22:21] is the
[2:22:23] sweetest
[2:22:25] name I
[2:22:27] [Music]
[2:22:31] know and he's
[2:22:35] just the
[2:22:37] [Music]
[2:22:39] same
[2:22:41] as his
[2:22:46] lovely oh and that's in the the
[2:22:51] reason
[2:22:53] why I
[2:22:55] love him
[2:22:58] [Music]
[2:23:01] so
[2:23:04] for
[2:23:05] [Music]
[2:23:13] Jesus now as they just play
[2:23:16] softly you
[2:23:18] know when we talk
[2:23:22] maybe preached sermon as like today or
[2:23:27] last
[2:23:28] Wednesday whatever you know some
[2:23:34] might some might think that you
[2:23:37] know coming back under
[2:23:40] law when we talk about keeping his
[2:23:43] Commandments and things
[2:23:45] but I I don't believe that when John
[2:23:48] tells us or Jesus tells us or whatever
[2:23:51] to keep keep his Commandments if you
[2:23:53] love me keep my Commandments and all
[2:23:56] these things I that's not because John
[2:23:59] if we read it the scripture that we read
[2:24:02] but he starts out if any man
[2:24:06] sin Brethren don't sin that's not our
[2:24:10] goal but if any man does sin we have an
[2:24:16] advocate with the father Jesus Christ
[2:24:19] the righteous
[2:24:21] and if you notice that law of
[2:24:24] Moses it it brought the people under
[2:24:27] condemnation it had no mercy in it it
[2:24:30] had no redemption in it it was as the
[2:24:33] prophet would call it the law of
[2:24:35] death but the word that we are to follow
[2:24:38] the Commandments that we are to keep
[2:24:39] it's the Word of Life the word of life
[2:24:42] it actually imparts life to the
[2:24:44] believer it it it protects them it from
[2:24:48] death and creates what is like in within
[2:24:51] that believer it's the only thing that
[2:24:53] can bring Revival it's the only thing
[2:24:55] that can bring full Redemption it's the
[2:24:58] only thing that can bring
[2:25:00] reconciliation it's what's bringing on
[2:25:02] the Rapture the changing of our body can
[2:25:04] you say
[2:25:04] amen and
[2:25:08] so brother brandham said that God shows
[2:25:11] the bride his word of life and she
[2:25:14] receives it and never doubts it that's
[2:25:18] that's that's what the bride is right
[2:25:20] how many believes that you're
[2:25:22] bride he shows us he has showed us by a
[2:25:26] prophet his Word of
[2:25:28] Life she receives it we have received it
[2:25:31] we've never
[2:25:33] doubted but if you do sin we have an
[2:25:37] advocate with the
[2:25:38] father can you say Amen so that that
[2:25:41] means that that as we're
[2:25:43] growing we might have Growing Pains we
[2:25:46] might fall we might fail in in in an
[2:25:49] area or or whatever but
[2:25:53] it's brother Bram said if we didn't have
[2:25:55] an advocate we'd all be gone there
[2:25:59] there'd be no way that we'd ever make it
[2:26:01] we would have no hope
[2:26:03] whatsoever but because we have an
[2:26:06] advocate brother brand says we are
[2:26:08] brought under the rich Ru blood of the
[2:26:10] Son of God and before God we are pure
[2:26:13] and holy can you say
[2:26:16] Amen so we're not worried about being
[2:26:19] saved today lost tomorrow save the next
[2:26:22] day and lost it's not He Loves Me He
[2:26:25] Loves Me Not He Loves Me He Loves Me Not
[2:26:28] amen because Ephesians 4:30 it says
[2:26:31] grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you
[2:26:33] are sealed unto the day of
[2:26:37] redemption and brother Braham says don't
[2:26:39] that just take the scare out of it now
[2:26:42] God's with us everybody say God's with
[2:26:45] us although you sin you got an advocate
[2:26:49] tell God you're sorry come on back
[2:26:53] that's the way to do it don't think
[2:26:55] you're cast off forever as long as you
[2:26:58] still have enough desire to come to this
[2:27:00] church come on God's still with you
[2:27:03] that's right sure he is can you say
[2:27:07] Amen I'm I'm so glad for
[2:27:10] that so he's our
[2:27:13] advocate so I thank God for that as he's
[2:27:15] calling us up
[2:27:17] higher and he's seeing that desire to
[2:27:20] come that we're not making Grace a
[2:27:22] disgrace but we're looking at our wrongs
[2:27:25] we're looking at the mirror of the word
[2:27:27] and we're saying God I I I know I'm not
[2:27:30] where I need to
[2:27:31] be God take me up higher and there's
[2:27:34] that blood that's sprinkling us that's
[2:27:36] covering us keeping us covered all the
[2:27:39] time and brother brandom said this you
[2:27:42] know talking about the Holy Ghost being
[2:27:43] our advocate he says it has Mercy it
[2:27:46] stands in your place it does things that
[2:27:49] you can't do it's a propitiation for
[2:27:52] your sins it's your righteousness it's
[2:27:55] your healing it's your life it's your
[2:27:57] Resurrection it's all that God has for
[2:28:00] you he's an advocate he said how we
[2:28:04] could go into details of that and break
[2:28:06] that down of how that went and he said
[2:28:09] it makes intercession for our ignorance
[2:28:12] sometimes we we got the Holy Ghost we
[2:28:15] ignorantly stagger into something and
[2:28:17] the holy spirit's there to make advocate
[2:28:19] for for us he's our advocator he stands
[2:28:23] there he's our attorney he stands there
[2:28:25] and pleads for us we don't plead for
[2:28:28] ourselves because the Holy Ghost in US
[2:28:30] pleads for us the Holy Spirit giving
[2:28:33] utterance sometimes with words you can't
[2:28:35] understand and makes intercessions for
[2:28:38] us that's what the Holy Ghost is can you
[2:28:41] say amen I think that's why we should
[2:28:43] pray
[2:28:45] more he said when I walk into anything I
[2:28:47] walk like a little kid you walk like a
[2:28:49] little fella he said we're walking in a
[2:28:52] dark world full of enemies full of sin
[2:28:55] full of traps full of everything and you
[2:28:57] say oh I'm afraid to take a Christian
[2:28:59] Life I'm afraid to do this I'm afraid
[2:29:01] I'll do this don't be afraid we have an
[2:29:06] advocate everybody say I've got an
[2:29:09] advocate he stands by us he's in us and
[2:29:13] makes intercession for us the Holy
[2:29:16] Spirit constantly constantly making an
[2:29:19] at for us all the
[2:29:22] time aren't you glad for
[2:29:25] that the thing of it is don't wallow in
