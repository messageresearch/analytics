[44:47] um the eighth chapter Amos
[44:53] 8 praise the Lord

[46:08] within us Lord help us to be more like
[46:11] you father is our prayer in Jesus
[46:14] Christ's name
[46:17] amen praise the Lord uh so the book of
[46:20] amamos First of all and going to read
[46:23] the start at the 11th verse says says
[46:27] behold the days come sayth the Lord God
[46:30] that I will send a famine in the land
[46:34] not a famine of bread nor a thirst for
[46:37] water but of hearing the words of the
[46:41] Lord and they shall wand from sea to Sea
[46:45] and from the north to the east they
[46:48] shall run to and fro to seek the word of
[46:51] the Lord and shall not find it amen then
[46:58] um if you want to go to the Book of
[47:01] Psalms uh We've read this uh psalms
[47:09] 27 praise the
[47:12] Lord and um brother brandham used this
[47:15] in the uh when he had preached the
[47:18] Rapture
[47:20] message and
[47:22] um it is uh certainly a timely
[47:28] scripture for us but we'll start at the
[47:31] first verse the Lord is my light and my
[47:34] salvation Whom Shall I
[47:37] Fear the Lord is the strength of my life
[47:40] of whom shall I be afraid you know it's
[47:44] amazing you can take one scripture and
[47:47] um and it it looks it looks Dreadful you
[47:52] know as we just read there where the
[47:54] famine is going to be in the land and it
[47:56] just seems like you know wow that's
[47:59] that's really rough but if if by God's
[48:02] grace you know the God would send us a
[48:05] prophet and would show us that there's
[48:08] something else that is going on at at at
[48:11] that
[48:12] time when the wicked even mine enemies
[48:15] and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my
[48:18] flesh they stumbled and fell though in
[48:22] host should encamp against me my heart
[48:26] shall not fear the war should rise
[48:29] against me in this will I be confident
[48:32] one thing have I desired of the Lord
[48:35] that will I seek after that I may dwell
[48:38] in the house of the Lord all the days of
[48:40] my life to behold the beauty of the Lord
[48:43] and to inquire in his Temple for in the
[48:46] time of trouble he shall hide me in his
[48:49] Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle
[48:52] shall he hide me he shall set me upon on
[48:56] a Rock Amen then um the scripture we
[49:01] have been reading is Psalms
[49:05] 46 and
[49:07] um the first
[49:10] verse God is our refuge and
[49:13] strength a very present help in trouble
[49:19] therefore will we not
[49:21] fear amen you can have your seats this
[49:25] morning
[49:27] and
[49:30] um so thankful that we can confide in
[49:34] the word of God Amen and
[49:37] trust there's anything that we can trust
[49:40] in that's the word of
[49:43] God but if the word of God means nothing
[49:47] to us if we can't take it for a personal
[49:51] for our personal lives amen it it must
[49:55] be something
[49:57] uh that we take personally just as as uh
[50:02] brother Bram talks about the court case
[50:05] where the the man um was going to be you
[50:09] know he was going to be
[50:11] tried uh uh for doing wrong and his
[50:15] friend had gotten uh a pardon from
[50:18] President Lincoln I believe
[50:21] and Mr Lincoln was in a hurry and so he
[50:25] just scribbled on a piece of paper
[50:26] pardon you know or whatever he did and
[50:29] the friend went back to his friend
[50:31] that's in prison get going to die the
[50:34] next morning and he he told him said
[50:37] you're free I've got your pardon he says
[50:39] oh don't mock me he said that come from
[50:42] president of the United States it would
[50:44] be in a nice piece of paper and da d da
[50:47] you know and uh so he ended up being
[50:51] executed the next day so they
[50:55] they they went to court over it and and
[50:58] these things and you know the story but
[51:00] the conclusion was a pardon is not a
[51:03] pardon unless received as a pardon so
[51:07] the the pardon had the authority I mean
[51:09] it was written there and and it it come
[51:13] from the highest Authority but it it
[51:16] couldn't be effective if the young man
[51:18] didn't receive it in a personal way and
[51:22] so that's the way with the Bible That's
[51:24] The Way with any promise of God it has
[51:26] to be uh received and so when we think
[51:32] of God being present a present help uh
[51:36] in this day then we can see in the
[51:40] scriptures as to what in what way uh he
[51:45] is helping us and uh I I think that is
[51:49] important um you know we we're living in
[51:53] a time of trouble we know that uh it
[51:55] isn't going to get better uh um you know
[52:00] uh the corruption is on every hand and
[52:04] Satan is the the god of the the this
[52:07] evil age and um you know uh we we know
[52:12] and understand I believe that the time
[52:15] of trouble that we're we're looking at
[52:18] and and that we're facing is the
[52:20] judgments of God coming upon the Earth
[52:23] the world is falling apart it's it's a
[52:26] trouble like no other time in the
[52:29] history of of
[52:32] mankind and uh it's it's the end of time
[52:37] it's it's the end of all things more
[52:39] mortality is at its end corruption is at
[52:42] its end politics everything it's it's at
[52:45] its end and as as we know the prophet
[52:48] would take that scripture uh look unto
[52:52] me all ye ends of the Earth and be ye
[52:55] saved and and he tied that scripture to
[52:58] our age that that scripture was applying
[53:02] to this age when all ends of the Earth
[53:05] we're at the ends of the Earth
[53:08] everything is coming to its end it's not
[53:10] just one nation coming to its end uh but
[53:15] it's all things coming to an end and so
[53:20] uh God is shaking not only the Earth but
[53:24] also the heavens as was foretold by the
[53:29] the prophet Paul and according to uh
[53:33] Hebrews
[53:34] 137 it's the removing of those things
[53:38] that are shaken amen it's it's the
[53:41] removing of those things remember God
[53:43] shaking not only the Earth but the
[53:46] heavens and and and this this time of
[53:49] trouble this this what we're living in
[53:52] it's it's a removing of things that can
[53:55] be shaken of as of things that are made
[53:59] so only the things that cannot be shaken
[54:03] will remain amen that's the only thing
[54:06] that's going to remain and and so uh uh
[54:10] so we know that we're living in the day
[54:13] of the Lord uh um and and which is the
[54:18] coming of Christ and and this of course
[54:21] the Prophet Daniel for told of this time
[54:24] and told what would be sh taken and what
[54:27] would remain for here in Daniel
[54:30] 2:31 Thou King sawest and behold a great
[54:34] image this great image uh whose
[54:37] brightness was excellent stood before
[54:40] thee and the form thereof was terrible
[54:43] this image's head uh was a fine gold his
[54:47] breast and his arms of silver his belly
[54:50] and his thighs of brass his legs of iron
[54:53] his feet of iron and part clay uh uh
[54:57] which was is the Gentile kingdoms
[55:00] starting with Nebuchadnezzar all the way
[55:02] down to this day that we're living in
[55:04] and and then he says and thou sawest
[55:07] till that a stone was cut out without
[55:12] hands which smok the image upon his feet
[55:15] that were of iron and clay and break
[55:17] them to Pieces ain't that right and so
[55:21] so this is that removing of things that
[55:24] can be shaken see the day that we're
[55:27] living in of course Peter and Paul would
[55:31] tell us that this stone that that
[55:34] Daniel's talking about is a person and
[55:38] and uh 1 Peter 2 and6 wherefore also it
[55:42] is contained in the scripture behold I
[55:45] lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect
[55:49] precious and he that believeth on him
[55:53] that stone him so it's not it he that
[55:58] believeth on it but but believeth on him
[56:02] shall not be confounded and unto you
[56:05] which believe he is precious that stone
[56:10] is precious see but unto them which be
[56:13] disobedient the stone which the builders
[56:15] dis lowed the same is made the head of
[56:18] the
[56:19] corner excuse me and a stone of
[56:22] stumbling a rock of offense even to them
[56:25] which stumble at the word being
[56:26] disobedient whereinto they were also
[56:29] appointed then you go into Ephesians
[56:32] 2:19 now therefore you are no more
[56:35] strangers and foreigners but fellow
[56:37] citizens with Saints with the Saints and
[56:40] of the household of God and are built
[56:42] upon the foundation of the Apostles and
[56:44] Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the
[56:47] Chief Cornerstone ain't that right so
[56:50] then this coming Stone rolling out of
[56:53] the mountain striking that image of
[56:55] course we we know that's the coming of
[56:58] Jesus Christ which is the day of the
[57:02] Lord which we could take all the way
[57:04] back to uh uh uh Revelations 101 and
[57:09] Luke and and so many scriptures that we
[57:12] have talked about before but if you go
[57:15] back to Daniel
[57:17] 2:35 it says uh when that stone had
[57:20] smoked the image says then was the iron
[57:24] the clay the brass the silver and the
[57:27] gold broken to pieces together and
[57:30] became like the shaft of the summer
[57:33] threshing floors and the wind carried
[57:35] them away that no place was found for
[57:39] them ain't that right so this signifying
[57:42] the removing of those things that can be
[57:47] shaken amen see and it says and the
[57:51] stone that smot the image became a great
[57:54] mountain and filled the whole earth so
[57:58] uh uh then you go down to the 44th verse
[58:01] in the days of this king of these Kings
[58:04] shall God Of Heaven set up a kingdom
[58:09] which shall never be destroyed aren't
[58:11] you glad for that amen now think of that
[58:14] because when Paul is talking about the
[58:17] shaking he's going to shake not only the
[58:20] Earth but the heavens also and that
[58:23] which can be shaken will be shaken and
[58:25] that which will remain uh cannot be
[58:27] shaken will remain and then he says
[58:30] wherefore we receive a kingdom that
[58:33] cannot be shaken well this is what
[58:36] Daniel is saying when when that Stone
[58:39] comes and the strikes the image which we
[58:41] know uh uh to be the revealed word of
[58:44] God for this age the
[58:47] manifestation of Jesus Christ amen
[58:49] because Prophet told us he is the word
[58:51] do you believe that Christ is the word
[58:54] that's right he is the word made
[58:57] manifest amen and so we we see all of
[59:00] these scriptures coming together in our
[59:03] age amen and so there's no other time
[59:07] that a a man could preach the world
[59:09] falling apart amen like in this age
[59:12] because that's exactly what is happening
[59:16] it ain't the just the United States
[59:18] falling apart it ain't just Rome falling
[59:21] apart or Germany falling apart or Russia
[59:24] but it's the world world that is falling
[59:27] apart because we realize that the stone
[59:31] is Jesus Christ the word made manifest
[59:35] amen and
[59:36] so uh uh we we see what a Ministry amen
[59:42] and says but the god of Heaven shall set
[59:44] up a kingdom which shall never be
[59:46] destroyed and the kingdom shall not be
[59:48] left to other people but it shall break
[59:52] in in pieces and consume all these
[59:55] kingdoms
[59:56] and it it shall stand forever not
[59:59] America not Russia not China but it the
[1:00:03] kingdom that God sets up that's the
[1:00:06] kingdom you and I are receiving do you
[1:00:10] believe them amen see so Daniel 7
[1:00:14] and13 we read this last Sunday but he
[1:00:17] says I saw in the night visions and
[1:00:19] behold one like the son of man came see
[1:00:23] that stone so he's called the the son of
[1:00:26] man he's called the Ancient of Days he's
[1:00:28] called The Stone he's called The Mighty
[1:00:30] Angel he's called the lamb amen he's
[1:00:33] called all God he's just all our all in
[1:00:36] all can you say amen amen one like the
[1:00:39] son of man came with the clouds of
[1:00:41] heaven and came to the Ancient of Days
[1:00:44] so now he's revealed not as priest he's
[1:00:47] not revealed as king he's revealed as
[1:00:51] judge amen amen Supreme judge you
[1:00:54] believe that amen see and they brought
[1:00:57] him near before him and there was given
[1:01:00] him Dominion not a political Dominion
[1:01:04] not a natural Dominion but a given him a
[1:01:08] dominion and glory and a kingdom and all
[1:01:12] people Nations and languages should
[1:01:15] serve him his Dominion is an everlasting
[1:01:19] Dominion which shall not pass away and
[1:01:22] his kingdom that shall which shall not
[1:01:25] be destroyed you believe that now notice
[1:01:27] go down that 17th verse and the Saints
[1:01:31] of the most high shall take the kingdom
[1:01:34] and possess the kingdom forever even
[1:01:37] forever and ever oh aren't you glad for
[1:01:41] that amen so we may not have much in
[1:01:44] this life but if we can see what God is
[1:01:47] doing in this
[1:01:49] age the world is falling apart kingdoms
[1:01:53] are falling apart amen the the piety of
[1:01:56] man and the highness and loftiness of
[1:01:59] man all going to be just done away with
[1:02:02] but there is a group of people blessed
[1:02:06] are the meek in heart for they shall
[1:02:09] inherit the earth and and I just believe
[1:02:11] that is is the people of God uh uh and
[1:02:15] so this is where we're at in time amen
[1:02:19] we're we're we're where it's it's a
[1:02:21] blending of where it's the mortality is
[1:02:25] passing away eternity is coming in time
[1:02:29] and everything that is part of time
[1:02:32] corruption and everything is going to
[1:02:34] fade away Fade Out amen is falling away
[1:02:38] amen but here is a kingdom that's coming
[1:02:41] in power and there's a people of God
[1:02:44] that is being recognized as the people
[1:02:47] of God the children of God Amen and God
[1:02:51] has promised them a kingdom which shall
[1:02:54] never pass away aren't you glad glad for
[1:02:56] that now brother brandham compared this
[1:02:59] time amen we we know that we're living
[1:03:02] in the time the stone has come and and
[1:03:05] and the kingdom God is setting up a
[1:03:08] kingdom and and these things and church
[1:03:11] U uh you say well I don't see anything
[1:03:13] but see that Kingdom God is is having
[1:03:16] the preeminence in in a group of people
[1:03:18] in this age amen like never before it's
[1:03:22] in this age that he has been able to
[1:03:24] have complete total preeminence in a
[1:03:27] people that he Redeemed by his blood he
[1:03:31] purchased amen and and and this is where
[1:03:34] we're at in this age see amen the
[1:03:37] kingdom of God being set up amen see but
[1:03:40] brother brandom compared this time to
[1:03:43] that of the first Exodus because he he
[1:03:47] and and he done this in several places
[1:03:49] but in the Third Exodus you'll you'll
[1:03:51] hear him compare this age this time with
[1:03:55] that time of the first Exodus and and
[1:03:59] and so but but if you look at this we we
[1:04:02] read this I think Wednesday night but
[1:04:04] acts 7 and6 and God spake on this wise
[1:04:07] that his seed Abraham's seed uh should
[1:04:10] sojourn in a Strange Land and and that
[1:04:14] they should bring them into bondage and
[1:04:16] entreat them evil for 400 years and the
[1:04:20] nation to whom they shall be in bondage
[1:04:22] will I judge God's saying this I will
[1:04:24] judge that Nation
[1:04:26] said God and after that they the the
[1:04:30] people my people that Seed of Abraham
[1:04:32] shall come forth and serve me in this
[1:04:35] place uh Exodus 2:24 God heard their
[1:04:39] groaning so so this is what happened
[1:04:42] they're in Egypt now they're in the
[1:04:43] world Egypt represents the world and and
[1:04:46] and the people are there but they're now
[1:04:48] they're groaning Amen to be delivered
[1:04:51] from slavery and to go back to their
[1:04:53] Homeland amen and God heard their
[1:04:56] groaning and remembered his Covenant
[1:04:59] amen with Abraham with Isaac and with
[1:05:02] Jacob and I I say this today that amen
[1:05:06] the message of the hour is is given to
[1:05:10] us because God remembered his Covenant
[1:05:13] I'm so glad for that it wasn't just God
[1:05:16] sending a a prophet just to send it but
[1:05:18] God remembered his Covenant there's
[1:05:21] something about this message amen or God
[1:05:24] would have never sent it to us but God
[1:05:26] remembered that Covenant just like he
[1:05:29] done with with here and and so he
[1:05:31] remembered his Covenant with Abraham
[1:05:34] with Isaac and with Jacob then you go in
[1:05:37] Exodus 3 and8 God said to Moses I am
[1:05:40] come down to deliver them out of the
[1:05:43] hand of the Egyptians and to bring them
[1:05:46] up out of the that land unto a good land
[1:05:50] a large land unto a land flowing with
[1:05:53] milk and honey aren't you glad for that
[1:05:56] God remembered his Covenant and says I
[1:05:59] am come down to deliver go to the 10th
[1:06:01] verse he says now come therefore and I
[1:06:05] will send thee a prophet unto Pharaoh
[1:06:10] that thou mayest bring forth my people
[1:06:12] the children of Israel out of Egypt oh
[1:06:16] my so as as we said brother Brown he
[1:06:18] read that scripture said what was God
[1:06:20] doing God was going in the form of a man
[1:06:24] to judge that nation and to deliver his
[1:06:28] people ain't that right and how unusual
[1:06:32] that was to Egypt amen where an old man
[1:06:36] uh just something insignificant but yet
[1:06:40] he had got with him he had a message of
[1:06:44] Deliverance and he brought judgment to a
[1:06:47] nation and deliverance to God's people
[1:06:50] aren't you glad for that well hey God
[1:06:53] has come in the form of a man in this
[1:06:55] age
[1:06:56] God came in a form of a man not to judge
[1:06:59] a nation but to judge the world can you
[1:07:03] say amen and he has also come to help
[1:07:06] his elect in this
[1:07:08] age I I I love the message uh because
[1:07:12] it's God displaying his care for us and
[1:07:17] and I've said it so many time that we
[1:07:19] shouldn't take the message for
[1:07:21] granted that we should cherish it we
[1:07:23] should listen to it we we should uh uh
[1:07:27] uh uh let it be uh a part of us every
[1:07:31] day of Our Lives amen be because the
[1:07:35] message God God sent this message it's a
[1:07:38] message of Deliverance it's it's and and
[1:07:42] and I I want to go further with this um
[1:07:45] you know brother brandom likened the day
[1:07:48] again that we're living in uh to that of
[1:07:52] Elijah's day so many scriptures speak of
[1:07:56] this day so many scriptures I believe it
[1:07:58] was brother Brown said there are more
[1:08:00] scriptures that speak of this day of the
[1:08:03] of the second coming than it than they
[1:08:05] did of the first coming and and so there
[1:08:08] there's so many scriptures that and and
[1:08:11] types and things that speak of our day
[1:08:13] but brother Brandon would liken the day
[1:08:15] of our day that we're living in to that
[1:08:17] of Elijah's day God sent Elijah Elijah
[1:08:22] was a prophet God wouldn't have sent
[1:08:24] that Prophet with without a reason but
[1:08:26] God sent that Prophet to bring judgment
[1:08:30] upon the nation of Israel amen Israel
[1:08:33] had violated all of God's laws and and
[1:08:38] and and as as we know God will not let
[1:08:41] sin go unpunished ain't that right he
[1:08:45] will not amen I they may be they they
[1:08:49] may be getting away with it or they
[1:08:50] think they're getting away with it amen
[1:08:52] but somewhere God uh is going to not let
[1:08:56] that go unpunished see and and so uh if
[1:09:00] you look in first Kings 17 And1 and
[1:09:04] Elijah the tishbite who was of the
[1:09:06] inhabitants of Gilead said unto Ahab as
[1:09:10] the Lord God liveth of Israel liveth
[1:09:14] before whom I stand there shall not be
[1:09:17] due nor rain these years but according
[1:09:21] to my word think of that now how unusual
[1:09:25] that would have been that some man amen
[1:09:29] uh uh would come up to a King amen and
[1:09:33] and say you know what uh uh it ain't
[1:09:36] raining except what I say well he's
[1:09:38] talking to a king that's got everything
[1:09:41] at his at his fingertips he can call for
[1:09:43] a servant to come he comes he can call
[1:09:46] he knows what Authority is but here is
[1:09:48] this old man a man I don't I don't know
[1:09:51] how old he was but anyway he was he he
[1:09:53] wasn't much to look on and and yet he he
[1:09:56] tells that King it it'll be at my word
[1:09:59] it ain't raining unless it's my word see
[1:10:02] and and so but you you would think it
[1:10:05] would have been enough to cause them to
[1:10:07] repent but the prophet said they were so
[1:10:10] removed from the word of God till they
[1:10:13] couldn't recognize what was being said
[1:10:17] they were so far from the power of God
[1:10:21] and the word of God that they couldn't
[1:10:23] even discern a prophet staying in their
[1:10:25] mid see and so they just thought it was
[1:10:29] just a man pronouncing judgment upon
[1:10:32] them now you know brother Bram tells us
[1:10:34] that Israel he had they had a temple at
[1:10:36] in that time a church they had plenty of
[1:10:39] educated men they had plenty of prophets
[1:10:42] all over the country they had plenty of
[1:10:44] priests plenty of scribes plenty of
[1:10:46] religion he said it's the perfect
[1:10:48] picture of today see and and he says
[1:10:52] they even the king of Israel of course
[1:10:53] was Ahab and he was a modernist you know
[1:10:57] and and yet the prophet said he was the
[1:10:59] worst king of them all of all the kings
[1:11:02] amen before Ahab he was the worst of
[1:11:05] them he believed in religion certainly
[1:11:07] he had everything in a Modern Trend he
[1:11:10] had his 400 Hebrew prophets all of them
[1:11:13] well schooled and trained and God sent
[1:11:16] him another Prophet God didn't use His
[1:11:20] prophets amen but God sent his own
[1:11:23] Prophet to Ahab and Ahab wouldn't
[1:11:26] believe it Israel amen see wouldn't
[1:11:29] believe see and so uh uh the people had
[1:11:33] gotten so modern Church listen now the
[1:11:37] people had gotten so modern in their
[1:11:39] thinking see they didn't want to hear
[1:11:42] the true word of the Lord they had
[1:11:45] sincere men they had sincere people they
[1:11:48] was very religious but notice the great
[1:11:51] powers of God had been taken out of the
[1:11:54] church Church the great powers of God
[1:11:59] why they were in idolatry amen and and
[1:12:02] so the the powers of God was unknown to
[1:12:06] them so here a man saying it will not
[1:12:08] rain but that my word how foreign that
[1:12:11] would be what man could even Des dare to
[1:12:15] claim that but but it was God in that
[1:12:19] man and he was acquainted with the power
[1:12:22] and authority of God for he had that
[1:12:26] power and authority do you believe that
[1:12:28] but they were so far removed from him
[1:12:31] that it just seemed stupid it just
[1:12:33] seemed this guy was crazy amen see and
[1:12:37] the prophet would say that sin and
[1:12:40] unbelief by false teachers and
[1:12:42] modernists in the church had brought the
[1:12:45] place uh to this coming oncoming
[1:12:48] judgment see amen say that again sin and
[1:12:52] unbelief by false teachers and modernist
[1:12:55] in the church had brought the place to
[1:12:57] this oncoming judgment then they had
[1:13:00] turned from God's word and his profit to
[1:13:04] a modern theological terms of the word
[1:13:08] see so again brother Brown said it's
[1:13:10] just like the day we're living in
[1:13:12] exactly the same amen and and and so uh
[1:13:17] uh uh today you know they they say the
[1:13:19] word doesn't mean what it says you know
[1:13:22] uh uh you got the Skeptics that say well
[1:13:24] the Red Sea actually didn't open up
[1:13:26] Israel crossed over a bunch of reads and
[1:13:29] and and and and just a little bit of
[1:13:31] water or water the Bible says they
[1:13:33] walked on gr dry ground see and and and
[1:13:36] so but but they don't believe in
[1:13:37] miracles they don't believe in the power
[1:13:40] of God see they they don't believe in
[1:13:42] these things and and so uh and and and
[1:13:46] you know uh I think you know in in years
[1:13:49] ago they decided that Eve didn't eat an
[1:13:52] appos an
[1:13:53] apricot and and and it it's just it's
[1:13:57] constantly modernizing the Bible it it's
[1:14:00] constantly changing it to fit their idea
[1:14:04] of things but brother brandham says it
[1:14:07] takes that kind of a day to bring God's
[1:14:11] Wrath down upon the people it takes that
[1:14:15] kind see and so just as it was the cup
[1:14:18] of iniquity of the amorites had filled
[1:14:20] up in Moses time amen so has it filled
[1:14:24] up in this age the C of iniquity amen
[1:14:28] see and so now notice God knew that it
[1:14:32] would take more than just an ordinary
[1:14:35] theology it would take more than just an
[1:14:39] or any ordinary message it would take
[1:14:42] more than just preaching the word to
[1:14:44] crack their Stony Hearts he knowed it
[1:14:47] would take thus sayith the Lord to send
[1:14:50] that judgment down upon that people so
[1:14:53] he know that when he went out with thus
[1:14:57] sayeth the Lord can you say Amen so so
[1:15:00] again it it shows that that this message
[1:15:03] is not just your ordinary message it's
[1:15:06] not just your uh an ordinary
[1:15:09] theological uh uh uh a message of of
[1:15:13] whatever see but it would take thus say
[1:15:16] the Lord think of that now a man in this
[1:15:20] age come with thus sayith the Lord and
[1:15:22] because of it the world is falling apart
[1:15:26] kingdoms are falling apart time is
[1:15:29] coming to its end and a famine is in the
[1:15:32] land do you believe that now church
[1:15:36] that's how powerful this message is amen
[1:15:39] it's it's it's a powerful message see so
[1:15:43] now you know the the prophet had been so
[1:15:46] long in the presence of God until he
[1:15:49] could say that the Dew will not fall
[1:15:52] except at my word amen he he was in
[1:15:56] contact with God and and the prophets
[1:15:59] lived in the presence of God until they
[1:16:02] became the word of God I I think that's
[1:16:05] the same thing if the bride's to become
[1:16:07] the word you cannot you cannot become
[1:16:11] the word by by keeping your nose in in
[1:16:14] in things that are not right you got to
[1:16:17] stay in the presence of God can you say
[1:16:21] amen amen well we know that to be true
[1:16:24] any anyways so the prophets lived in the
[1:16:28] presence of God until they became the
[1:16:30] word and their message their message the
[1:16:33] prophet said their message is the word
[1:16:37] itself I I know people you got the
[1:16:39] critics that pick this message apart but
[1:16:42] I'm telling you the message is the word
[1:16:44] itself people say well what's the what's
[1:16:47] better the Bible or the message you
[1:16:48] can't tell them
[1:16:50] apart that's right can you say Amen it's
[1:16:53] the self same thing it's God sent a
[1:16:56] prophet with a message and his message
[1:16:58] is the word of God see because the
[1:17:02] prophet had thus sayth the Lord do you
[1:17:04] believe that see so now their message
[1:17:08] the prophet said M from God when a
[1:17:11] prophet received a message it might have
[1:17:13] even been against their own thinking how
[1:17:16] in the world is it going to happen just
[1:17:17] like Isaiah when Isaiah said behold a
[1:17:19] virgin shall conceive he had never seen
[1:17:21] that happen it was totally against the
[1:17:23] law of
[1:17:25] man or whatever um that you would want
[1:17:28] to call it a virgin being able to
[1:17:30] conceive but God said it would and he
[1:17:34] was so yielded to God to where he would
[1:17:37] just open his mouth and say Behold a
[1:17:39] virgin shall conceive and yet it may
[1:17:42] have been against his own thinking can
[1:17:44] you say Amen may have not been under
[1:17:47] able to understand what they were saying
[1:17:49] but they were speaking the word of the
[1:17:51] Lord and Israel had refused they were in
[1:17:55] such a bad shape in ahab's time that
[1:17:59] they refused to hear thus sayth the Lord
[1:18:01] see because it was too unusual for them
[1:18:05] they couldn't believe that a man's word
[1:18:07] could stop rain from coming amen they
[1:18:10] they they just couldn't believe that
[1:18:11] just like people cannot believe that a
[1:18:13] man's word could could bring squirrels
[1:18:16] into existence a man's word could
[1:18:19] actually amen bring uh or or cause a
[1:18:23] snowstorm to to go out of existence a
[1:18:26] man's word amen think of that amen it's
[1:18:29] too hard it's for people to believe it
[1:18:32] because it's unusual and and I I tell
[1:18:34] you this church sometimes we think it's
[1:18:36] too unusual amen for God to take our
[1:18:39] mortal lips and speak his word through
[1:18:41] it but a prophet said the word is in the
[1:18:44] bride amen and you've got to believe it
[1:18:46] you got to know it you got to stay in
[1:18:48] that presence you got to stay connected
[1:18:50] in the power of God in order to truly
[1:18:53] believe that God can take you and speak
[1:18:56] his word through
[1:18:59] you but they couldn't believe it amen
[1:19:02] they can't believe it today they
[1:19:03] couldn't believe it now brother brandom
[1:19:05] says see in that day when Elijah came up
[1:19:07] and he told him said now it ain't going
[1:19:09] to rain oh it must have struck the
[1:19:11] headlines amen I don't know what they
[1:19:13] had if they had newspapers or whatever
[1:19:15] but you know uh smoke signals I don't
[1:19:17] know but I guarantee it got around very
[1:19:20] fast here's this here's this fudy duddy
[1:19:23] man amen long long beard and and I you
[1:19:27] know he might have even stunk you know I
[1:19:29] don't know but be he had camel hair or
[1:19:32] uh clothing and and and and he comes up
[1:19:36] there and he he wasn't really dressed uh
[1:19:38] the occasion to stand before a king but
[1:19:41] it must have got around that this guy is
[1:19:43] claiming he's claiming that it ain't
[1:19:46] going to rain unless he says it you know
[1:19:49] and and so they you know the prophet
[1:19:51] says now they looked at their natural re
[1:19:54] sources here's a man saying it ain't
[1:19:57] going to rain but at my word dou shall
[1:19:59] not even fall upon the ground except
[1:20:01] what I say and they got to looking at
[1:20:03] their natural resources and the rivers
[1:20:06] was flowing really good the Lakes were
[1:20:08] you know maybe overflowing and all the
[1:20:11] reservoirs were were topped off and they
[1:20:13] probably laugh yeah yeah we're doing
[1:20:16] pretty good see and isn't that just the
[1:20:19] same way people are doing today amen you
[1:20:22] tell them about the coming of the Lord
[1:20:24] you tell them about judgment tell them
[1:20:26] oh we've got it made we've got
[1:20:27] everything up now amen everything's
[1:20:29] looking good now for us see but a
[1:20:32] prophet stands here and says there's no
[1:20:36] hope ain't no hope see and so you know
[1:20:41] think of it how can one man's word one
[1:20:44] man's word change
[1:20:46] everything they had been doing
[1:20:49] good they they they had been
[1:20:51] free I mean they had been whatever they
[1:20:54] were were doing it they were abounding
[1:20:57] and how is one man's word going to
[1:20:59] change it for
[1:21:01] us
[1:21:03] amen see they were so removed from the
[1:21:07] word till it was too unusual for them to
[1:21:10] believe but God brought
[1:21:13] judgment just like a prophet said it
[1:21:16] would brought judgment by sending a
[1:21:20] famine in the land you see brother
[1:21:22] brandom says to spurn thus say the Lord
[1:21:24] would be to cross the line of mercy and
[1:21:27] then comes the Judgment see and in 1965
[1:21:31] brother Brandon would say we're entering
[1:21:33] into the Judgment because Mercy has been
[1:21:37] spurned amen God sent a prophet to try
[1:21:40] to bring this world back to try to bring
[1:21:43] this nation back to try to get it to
[1:21:46] repentance and it would not repent and
[1:21:48] so now he's saying we're entering into
[1:21:51] judgment because Mercy has been spurned
[1:21:55] think of it one man his word amen you
[1:21:59] think of the message that he preached I
[1:22:01] indict this generation that was not just
[1:22:04] a a a man just coming up with some
[1:22:08] message because people wouldn't receive
[1:22:10] him that was a voice of God speaking
[1:22:13] through that man and because God stood
[1:22:17] in that behind that Pulpit he indicted
[1:22:20] this nation and this generation by one
[1:22:23] man's word
[1:22:28] word now we see where we're at the world
[1:22:31] is in a spiritual drought spiritual
[1:22:36] famine and people are running to and
[1:22:40] fro trying to find the word of the
[1:22:44] Lord coast to
[1:22:46] coast and yet the Bible says they won't
[1:22:49] find
[1:22:50] it and brother brandom says see when God
[1:22:53] sends forth a message and tells the
[1:22:56] people and they don't receive
[1:22:58] it then he withdraws his servant and
[1:23:02] sends his plagues famine death
[1:23:05] spiritually speaking physically also but
[1:23:08] he said you watch for a depression
[1:23:10] brother you think you've seen something
[1:23:12] you just wait after a while you ain't
[1:23:14] seen nothing you think you're dying for
[1:23:16] a good spiritual Revival you wait till
[1:23:18] after a bit you just wait long and cried
[1:23:22] to hear the word of the Lord
[1:23:25] but he says see that voice that voice
[1:23:29] was quiet in the wilderness it was
[1:23:31] laying quiet see in the wilderness
[1:23:34] somewhere hid away see now that that
[1:23:39] seems you know uh
[1:23:42] uh fateful pronouncement there and a
[1:23:46] fatal thing and it is Amen to this world
[1:23:50] and to this generation and to the wicked
[1:23:54] amen man but then you have to take the
[1:23:57] scripture but the Lord is present to
[1:24:01] help in the time of trouble therefore we
[1:24:07] will not fear amen we we're not like
[1:24:10] those that look at the message and look
[1:24:13] at the pronouncements and laugh at it
[1:24:15] and say oh yeah y old FY duddy that
[1:24:18] ain't going to happen no the Lord has
[1:24:20] been our confidence the Lord has been
[1:24:23] our trust yes the Lord has our
[1:24:26] expectation Cometh From The Lord can you
[1:24:29] say man and and and and so we realize
[1:24:32] that we we are in his hands we we are
[1:24:36] not as as we don't have that judgment
[1:24:40] pronounced upon us because we look at
[1:24:43] the promises of God we have his
[1:24:45] blessings pronounced upon us can you say
[1:24:48] man so if you look at it God sent a
[1:24:52] famine to punish the
[1:24:55] unbeliever and at the same time he made
[1:24:58] a way for the
[1:25:00] believer God always does that Prophet
[1:25:02] said God always does that you can look
[1:25:04] it in the Bible God always does that
[1:25:06] Amen in Noah's time God done that amen
[1:25:09] God was sending a judgment upon the
[1:25:11] world for their sins and the filth and
[1:25:14] all that but God made a way for Noah and
[1:25:18] the
[1:25:19] believer can you say amen amen amen made
[1:25:23] a way of Escape in the day that God was
[1:25:26] going to drown Egypt he made a way of
[1:25:29] Escape across the sea for his people see
[1:25:32] so God always makes a way when there is
[1:25:34] no way amen he is that way can you say
[1:25:38] it with me he is that way God is that
[1:25:41] way he he makes a way and and so God
[1:25:45] made a way for Elijah the prophet said
[1:25:48] which represents the church to escape
[1:25:51] the famine and drought
[1:25:54] amen now he says Elijah had a secret
[1:25:58] place provided by God himself now the
[1:26:02] church never provided it for him the
[1:26:05] king never provided it for him he didn't
[1:26:08] provide himself but God provided
[1:26:11] somebody say God provided God provided a
[1:26:15] secret place for Elijah to be fed all
[1:26:18] the time during the drought where his
[1:26:21] food was provided day by day he didn't
[1:26:24] need to wonder what's going to happen
[1:26:26] tomorrow or wonder if the supply was
[1:26:29] going to run out God said I've commanded
[1:26:31] the Ravens to feed you and they will
[1:26:34] feed you can you say amen God will move
[1:26:38] it it it it's supernatural Church you
[1:26:41] serve a supernatural God you're
[1:26:43] worshiping a supernatural God that can
[1:26:46] make a way when there is no way your
[1:26:49] life is in his hands you don't have to
[1:26:52] worry you don't have to fear
[1:26:57] brother brandham says he ordained the
[1:26:59] Ravens his servants so bless them Birds
[1:27:04] his servants that kept the voice of
[1:27:07] Elijah alive during the time of his
[1:27:09] isolation from the church the Ravens
[1:27:13] brought him flesh and bread at morning
[1:27:16] and flesh and bread in the evening and
[1:27:18] he drank from the little Fountain while
[1:27:20] the rest of them down there were doing
[1:27:23] without any spirit spiritual food and
[1:27:25] water can you say Amen see that that
[1:27:28] there's no Revival in the land Revival
[1:27:31] for America is over I don't care how
[1:27:34] much they shout and they dance they got
[1:27:36] their nice choirs they've got their
[1:27:37] professional musicians they've got their
[1:27:39] professional preachers but Revival is
[1:27:41] over but that does not apply to the
[1:27:45] pride can you say amen that's right see
[1:27:49] so so Elijah God provided a secret place
[1:27:55] for his life to be sustained people were
[1:27:59] dying but Elijah's life was sustained he
[1:28:04] received strength yes he did you look at
[1:28:08] Elijah he didn't look like someone that
[1:28:10] hadn't had had missed a meal for a week
[1:28:12] or two thank of it this famine lasted
[1:28:15] three and a half month
[1:28:16] years three and a half years think about
[1:28:20] that and and and Elijah if you looked at
[1:28:23] him compared to everybody else he didn't
[1:28:25] look like he was going through drought
[1:28:27] cuz God provided a place for
[1:28:30] him can you say Amen brother Ram says
[1:28:34] what a wonderful thing a type of our
[1:28:36] secret place in Christ he's made a way
[1:28:40] for his believing children to escape it
[1:28:43] now see the Wrath and things that are to
[1:28:46] come see so the believer is not in the
[1:28:51] famine that's right that's right now

[1:32:15] might get into our Spirits this morning

[1:32:20] the hour that we're living in
[1:32:24] church God has provided
[1:32:27] it yes he
[1:32:29] has brother brandham said that this food
[1:32:32] this
[1:32:33] carcass son of
[1:32:36] man he said it's
[1:32:39] hidden which goes again right along with
[1:32:42] what David saying he shall hide me in
[1:32:46] the time of
[1:32:47] trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion
[1:32:50] in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he
[1:32:52] hide me he shall set me up on a
[1:32:56] rock rock revelation of who Jesus Christ
[1:33:00] is the revelation of the word of God can
[1:33:03] you say amen amen it's a hidden
[1:33:07] food but we're hid away where that food
[1:33:12] is that word hide means to put out of
[1:33:15] sight to conceal for shelter or
[1:33:19] protection can you say man so in the
[1:33:22] time of trouble God God hides the
[1:33:24] believer where the food
[1:33:27] is hello yes amen where the food is now
[1:33:32] now we know that something can be in
[1:33:34] plain sight and yet
[1:33:36] hidden ain't that
[1:33:39] right it can be in plain
[1:33:43] sight and yet so hidden to man can't
[1:33:48] even see
[1:33:49] it it's been proven in the Bible so many
[1:33:52] times
[1:33:54] you could look at the prophet
[1:33:56] Elisha how he came into Plain View
[1:34:00] remember when when I think it was the
[1:34:04] king of
[1:34:05] Syria kept trying to attack Israel
[1:34:08] they're going to come and Prevail over
[1:34:10] Israel and every time he he would he
[1:34:13] would plan something and they would go a
[1:34:14] certain route there was Israel waiting
[1:34:16] on them and Israel would drive him back
[1:34:19] and finally the king thought okay he got
[1:34:22] his all everybody together and says
[1:34:23] there's a spy in here somewhere that's
[1:34:25] telling you know it's kind of one of
[1:34:27] these uh leakers that we have someone's
[1:34:30] leaking it out you know and uh uh and
[1:34:35] finally someone says oh King Ed Ain't So
[1:34:38] everybody's loyal to you says but what
[1:34:41] what you don't know is Israel has got a
[1:34:43] prophet in the
[1:34:45] land and and he's telling he's telling
[1:34:49] the king of Israel everything you're
[1:34:51] thinking in your bed chamber
[1:34:54] ain't that right and and so this King
[1:34:57] Assyria says well you you go find out
[1:34:59] where he is and tell me so they found
[1:35:02] out where he was he was in Doan so the
[1:35:04] king got all of his army and told him
[1:35:06] says you go down there and Surround that
[1:35:08] City and you bring that man to me so
[1:35:10] they get around that City and and and
[1:35:13] y'all know the story The servant woke up
[1:35:16] one morning you know and he's out
[1:35:18] [Music]
[1:35:19] there wiping his eyes no doubt and he
[1:35:22] opens his eyes you
[1:35:24] know and I mean he he he he well his
[1:35:30] heart got to racing and he runs back
[1:35:33] inside and says oh Elisha we're in
[1:35:35] trouble you know we're
[1:35:38] surrounded and so he brought Elisha had
[1:35:41] to probably drag him out pull him out
[1:35:43] and says here look look and Elisha
[1:35:46] didn't skip a beat you know he just said
[1:35:48] well more are they that are with us than
[1:35:50] they that are with him right and I I I'm
[1:35:53] sure the the servant could do a little
[1:35:55] math and know that that he would
[1:35:58] something wasn't right you know and and
[1:36:00] so but the Bible says that Elisha walked
[1:36:04] right out there in to the enemy walked
[1:36:08] right out there to the enemy and they
[1:36:10] didn't know who he was that's right they
[1:36:12] didn't recognize him and he asked him
[1:36:15] who you looking for and they told him
[1:36:17] said well come here I'll show you I'll
[1:36:19] take you to him led him right to the
[1:36:21] enemy surrounded him
[1:36:25] yeah but the Bible says God closed their
[1:36:28] eyes to where they couldn't recognize
[1:36:31] him yet they were looking at him but he
[1:36:34] was hidden in plain sight that's it
[1:36:37] ain't that right that that goes on with
[1:36:39] with everything even Jesus amen see so
[1:36:43] brother random says now he said see
[1:36:46] today's people are spiritually blind to
[1:36:49] where the Lord can come in the midst of
[1:36:52] them and do what he promised to do and
[1:36:54] they can't see it they don't know his
[1:36:58] great power because they're spiritually
[1:37:01] blind ain't that right so he says God
[1:37:04] blinds the unbeliever from the true
[1:37:07] Genuine Food of the child the believer
[1:37:10] ain't that right he blinds the
[1:37:13] unbeliever from the very thing you're
[1:37:16] eaten
[1:37:18] from amen
[1:37:22] amen people not talk this message you
[1:37:25] you shouldn't get discouraged and say
[1:37:27] well maybe there's something about it
[1:37:28] that's wrong no just know that God's
[1:37:32] blinded
[1:37:33] it and your eyes could be blinded as
[1:37:36] well but God sent the food for
[1:37:39] you are you with me church we we don't
[1:37:42] understand these things and that doesn't
[1:37:44] mean that we're all high and mighty and
[1:37:46] and more better than other people we
[1:37:49] ought to be the most humblest people we
[1:37:51] ought to be the most meekest people we
[1:37:53] ought to be the most thankful
[1:37:55] people and and we ought to do our best
[1:37:57] to try to get people into this message
[1:38:00] brother brandom just re listening to
[1:38:02] today says if someone says they got the
[1:38:04] Holy Ghost and they're not out telling
[1:38:05] people about God he said there's
[1:38:07] something wrong with that person
[1:38:09] individual we ought to be telling people
[1:38:11] about God we ought to be witnessing to
[1:38:14] people
[1:38:16] hello
[1:38:18] amen tell them about what God has done
[1:38:21] for us see so so Jesus had to contend
[1:38:24] with so much unbelief in his day he was
[1:38:28] the word he was the very word of
[1:38:30] Prophecy that the prophet spoke of they
[1:38:33] spoke of him he was he was what the
[1:38:35] prophet said would happen a virgin shall
[1:38:38] conceive and there he was
[1:38:42] right in the beginning God for told of
[1:38:45] of Christ to come in Genesis 3:15 says I
[1:38:48] will put enity between thee and the
[1:38:50] woman and between thy seed and her seed
[1:38:53] and it shall bruise thy head and thou sh
[1:38:56] bruise his heel see so all the prophets
[1:38:59] spoke of him all the way from Genesis on
[1:39:02] they they spoke of Christ's coming he
[1:39:05] was that word manifest and then he
[1:39:06] performed the works of God and they
[1:39:08] still wouldn't believe him they they
[1:39:11] they still wouldn't do it he told them
[1:39:13] you know that the scriptures testified
[1:39:14] of who he was and yet they they were so
[1:39:17] blinded by their traditions and so full
[1:39:20] of unbelief that they couldn't see him
[1:39:22] for what he was
[1:39:24] and and that unbelief still holds to
[1:39:27] date that people still cannot believe
[1:39:30] that he was God they say he was a good
[1:39:31] man he was a prophet he was such and
[1:39:34] such but there were people that
[1:39:35] literally cannot believe that Jesus was
[1:39:37] the son of God can you say Amen they
[1:39:41] believe him to be a good man see and and
[1:39:43] even that little that woman told you
[1:39:46] know brother Brown something I got
[1:39:47] against you and and he said well I you
[1:39:50] know I hope that's the only thing and
[1:39:52] and he's what is it he says you make too
[1:39:55] much of God or Christ being God and and
[1:39:58] he said well he was God no he wasn't you
[1:40:00] know and and and the scripture that she
[1:40:03] used was Jesus wept you know and and he
[1:40:07] says but lady says as a man he wept But
[1:40:10] as God Amen he he he commanded stood
[1:40:14] there at the grave of a dead man that
[1:40:16] been dead four days and commanded him to
[1:40:19] live as God as man he hungered but as
[1:40:23] God he could turn the water into wine as
[1:40:26] as man he thirsted can you say man amen
[1:40:30] but he's would stand on the bow of a
[1:40:32] boat amen and command the storms Amen to
[1:40:36] dissipate and and all that why he
[1:40:38] fulfilled the word that was spoken of
[1:40:41] him do you believe that church brother
[1:40:44] bradam F fulfilled the word that was
[1:40:46] spoken of him this message is is the
[1:40:50] Bible this message is the Fulfillment of
[1:40:53] scriptures do you believe that that
[1:40:55] that's what I'm trying to tell you it
[1:40:56] it's it's it's more than just a man that
[1:40:59] came to us it it was God veiled in a
[1:41:03] body of Flesh Amen to deliver the word
[1:41:07] of God to us we we we want to be so
[1:41:11] convinced of that see amen see and so
[1:41:14] now listen brother brandham see so Jesus
[1:41:17] is is telling them you know search the
[1:41:20] scriptures and and because they testify
[1:41:23] who I am you're so well versed in the
[1:41:26] scriptures you ought to be able to see
[1:41:27] me cuz I'm doing exactly what the Bible
[1:41:30] says I do well brother Brown said see
[1:41:33] it's the scriptures that tell you the
[1:41:35] hour that we're living in you don't you
[1:41:38] don't necessarily have to find you know
[1:41:42] uh uh you know proof as far as science
[1:41:46] and all that look at the scriptures amen
[1:41:49] they tell you the hour that we're living
[1:41:51] in and the things you see done it's God
[1:41:54] everybody say it's God it's God himself
[1:41:57] among his people nothing can raise the
[1:42:00] dead but God nothing can do the things
[1:42:03] that he's doing now but him for the
[1:42:05] Bible says he's the same yesterday today
[1:42:08] and forever notice what he says don't
[1:42:11] you see the authority of the Living God
[1:42:13] in the Living Church the bride the sick
[1:42:16] are healed the dead are raised the
[1:42:19] cripples walk the blinds see the gospel
[1:42:22] Goes Forth in its power for the message
[1:42:25] and the messenger are the same can you
[1:42:29] say Amen see so so we look at all of
[1:42:32] these things of of God in Elijah God in
[1:42:36] Moses now we're looking at God in a man
[1:42:40] God in the bride see amen and and we
[1:42:43] have to look at this message Amen to say
[1:42:46] it is of god god ordained it it come
[1:42:50] from God it was God that spoke to us and
[1:42:53] used a man's voice can you say Amen it
[1:42:56] was so Supernatural that we have to say
[1:42:59] that it is God see and so today the
[1:43:03] world cannot believe that what happened
[1:43:05] in Tucson Arizona you know uh was the
[1:43:09] son of man coming in a cloud with power
[1:43:11] and great Glory they want to say well it
[1:43:13] was a rocket it it it was smoked from a
[1:43:15] rocket it was this it's that but see it
[1:43:18] would take the believer now listen
[1:43:21] Church it takes the believer to be able
[1:43:23] to see it and say no that's
[1:43:26] God can you say Amen we we're not
[1:43:29] looking at it and and debating this
[1:43:32] thing and and trying to reason it out we
[1:43:34] know it's God it was something
[1:43:35] Supernatural that took place hallelu why
[1:43:39] it's our
[1:43:40] food yes it
[1:43:42] is the carnal the prophet said the
[1:43:46] carnal Minds wraps up the thing in their
[1:43:49] own ideas then God sends down and
[1:43:52] unfolds The Thing by his power so that's
[1:43:55] what happened to Ahab he got it all in
[1:43:58] his own thinking how it was all going to
[1:44:00] be and then God would send a prophet
[1:44:04] amen and he and his message was one he
[1:44:07] had that Authority ain't that right the
[1:44:10] prophet said the messenger the message
[1:44:13] and the Word was exactly the same thing
[1:44:18] the prophet the message and the word was
[1:44:23] the same thing can you say Amen see
[1:44:26] brother Bram said any man and his
[1:44:28] message is one he said that's why today
[1:44:32] that they do not believe in doing the
[1:44:34] works of God because they do not accept
[1:44:37] the message of God they don't believe
[1:44:39] the message but those who believe God's
[1:44:42] hour that we're living in these things
[1:44:45] are hidden
[1:44:47] food can you say
[1:44:49] Amen these things are hidden food
[1:44:54] true we don't need to look at the times
[1:44:56] that we're living
[1:44:59] in to get
[1:45:03] strengthened we don't need to and you
[1:45:07] forgive me but we don't need to study
[1:45:09] about all of
[1:45:11] Israel to be
[1:45:14] strengthened we don't need to get into
[1:45:16] the politics of things to be
[1:45:18] strengthened God sent us a prophet
[1:45:24] and he himself the son of man was
[1:45:27] revealed through that Prophet Vindicated
[1:45:30] it the word became flesh and that became
[1:45:35] our hidden
[1:45:36] food can you say
[1:45:39] Amen there's ever a time that we ought
[1:45:41] to study this message stay in the
[1:45:44] presence of God it is
[1:45:48] now can you say
[1:45:50] amen that's right see so we look
[1:45:54] throughout the ages Noah's eyes was open
[1:45:57] to the word of God and the promise Moses
[1:45:59] eyes John's
[1:46:01] eyes was open to the word and to the
[1:46:04] promise of
[1:46:06] God and we look as as like I say I I'll
[1:46:10] get ready to close but Matthew 22
[1:46:14] 1 and Jesus answered and spake unto them
[1:46:17] again by Parables and said the Kingdom
[1:46:19] of Heaven is like unto a certain King
[1:46:21] which made a marriage for for a
[1:46:23] son and sent forth his servants to call
[1:46:26] them that were bidden to the wedding and
[1:46:28] they would not come again he sent forth
[1:46:31] other servants saying tell them which
[1:46:33] are bidden behold I have prepared my
[1:46:35] dinner my oxen my fatlings are killed
[1:46:39] all things are ready come unto the
[1:46:41] marriage but they made light of it and
[1:46:43] went their ways one to his farm another
[1:46:46] to his merchandise and the remnant took
[1:46:48] his servants and entreated them
[1:46:50] spitefully and slew them but when the
[1:46:53] king heard thereof he was wroth and he
[1:46:57] sent forth his armies and destroyed
[1:46:58] those murderers and burned up their
[1:47:01] City then saith he to his servants the
[1:47:03] wedding is
[1:47:05] ready but they which were bidden were
[1:47:08] not worthy ain't that right so we see
[1:47:12] this is happening man is constantly
[1:47:15] making
[1:47:16] excuses and turning God's invitation to
[1:47:19] the marriage supper away turning turning
[1:47:22] it down ain't that right but notice the
[1:47:25] prophet says when God gives a man an
[1:47:28] invitation now you think of that now
[1:47:31] when God gives a man so here we're in a
[1:47:33] famine we're in a but God has invited
[1:47:37] God's inviting to a feast come come to
[1:47:41] the feast see because if you're not in
[1:47:44] if you're not feasting then you're going
[1:47:46] to die of famine you're going to die in
[1:47:48] the drought ain't that right and and and
[1:47:51] you know if you go look and brother
[1:47:54] brandom talks about it there in uh God
[1:47:58] how does that God doesn't send judgment
[1:48:00] without warning first and he said you
[1:48:03] might see a man go die and you say man
[1:48:06] that man didn't know he says oh no no no
[1:48:08] no he said that man knew he said it
[1:48:12] might have been he said you never know
[1:48:14] what God dealt with him in his heart
[1:48:16] might have just been a little prick one
[1:48:17] time and the man turned it down or
[1:48:19] whatever but he said he knew he knew
[1:48:22] what to do and is that right and so when
[1:48:25] God gives a man an invitation to do
[1:48:27] something or to receive the invitation
[1:48:30] and he's given him and he turns it down
[1:48:33] then there's nothing left after Mercy is
[1:48:35] spurned but judgment if you step over
[1:48:38] the boundaries of Mercy then there's
[1:48:40] only one thing left and that is Judgment
[1:48:43] ain't that right see so so and and and
[1:48:46] I'm talking about God's invitation I'm
[1:48:48] not talking about man's invitation I'm
[1:48:50] talking about God's invitation you know
[1:48:52] uh because there there's been you know I
[1:48:54] was in Pentecost and you know man you
[1:48:57] know you there's a lot of times man
[1:48:59] would be trying to bring an altar call
[1:49:01] and then he'd say now you know and I've
[1:49:03] heard it so many times you know there's
[1:49:06] someone out here you know that should be
[1:49:07] at this altar if you don't you know do
[1:49:09] it tonight you're lost you know and that
[1:49:11] happened so many times and only just
[1:49:13] brought fear upon the people so I'm not
[1:49:15] talking about man I'm talking about God
[1:49:18] and this invitation comes through the
[1:49:19] message of the hour the spirit of God
[1:49:22] bringing us to the message so anyways
[1:49:25] man man has done exactly that in all
[1:49:27] ages come up with excuses they come up
[1:49:29] excuses in Noah's day and well just all
[1:49:32] the way through and and so God would
[1:49:35] send his Prophet with thus say the Lord
[1:49:37] people would laugh at it they would just
[1:49:39] treat it lightly they would walk away
[1:49:40] from it and and and but what what God
[1:49:44] was doing by sending the sayth the Lord
[1:49:47] is inviting them to a feast and they
[1:49:50] would turn it down see and and so but
[1:49:54] brother random says the thing that
[1:49:55] people laugh at is the thing that we
[1:49:57] pray
[1:49:58] for
[1:50:00] hello see the thing that people are
[1:50:03] laughing at and the world treating
[1:50:04] lightly that's the thing that the elect
[1:50:07] is praying for ain't that right amen so
[1:50:11] so brother Bram talks about the 2,000
[1:50:13] years ago how Israel turned down the
[1:50:15] invitation to come to the the wedding
[1:50:18] supper that spiritual feast and when
[1:50:20] they turned it down they went into
[1:50:22] judgment
[1:50:23] now notice here Paul would say in 2
[1:50:26] Corinthians 2:3 let no man deceive you
[1:50:29] by any means for that day shall not come
[1:50:32] except there come a falling away first
[1:50:36] and that man man of sin be revealed the
[1:50:38] son of predition ain't that right see
[1:50:41] now notice what brother Braham says this
[1:50:43] Falling Away comes as people get away
[1:50:48] from the spiritual
[1:50:50] Feast they turning down the spiritual
[1:50:53] feast and when they do that that
[1:50:56] invitation to come to the spiritual
[1:50:58] Feast amen then there's a great Fallen
[1:51:01] away this is where we're at can you say
[1:51:04] Amen what is the spiritual Feast it's
[1:51:07] the carcass of the
[1:51:09] word can you say Amen brother Braham
[1:51:12] said they don't come to the spiritual
[1:51:14] Feast of his promise Vindicated word so
[1:51:19] this message that's why it's so
[1:51:20] different from the the the rest of
[1:51:23] messages and and and Ministries is
[1:51:25] because this is the Feast of God's
[1:51:29] promised word
[1:51:31] Vindicated it's what Eagles are that's
[1:51:33] where the Eagles are gathered can you
[1:51:35] say amen that's right see the word
[1:51:39] everybody say the word is Eagle food
[1:51:42] brother brandom called it the fresh
[1:51:44] clean meat the word of the Season he
[1:51:49] said you cannot feed the Bride of Jesus
[1:51:51] Christ
[1:51:53] Pentecostalism can you say
[1:51:55] Amen there is nothing else
[1:51:59] greater that will gather this elect than
[1:52:03] the message of the
[1:52:06] hour aren't you glad for
[1:52:09] that nothing outside of this Vindicated
[1:52:12] Word of Promise amen I'm I'm so glad
[1:52:16] that God has brought us to this place
[1:52:21] amen if the musicians will
[1:52:27] come the son of man revealed in this day
[1:52:31] the manifested
[1:52:34] word he's the one that appeared in the
[1:52:36] Ohio River just as brother brandham was
[1:52:39] baptized in the 17th
[1:52:41] person he's the one who has performed
[1:52:44] the supernatural things in brother
[1:52:45] branham's Ministry he's the one who
[1:52:47] foretold those things perfectly
[1:52:50] right brother Brown said he was only
[1:52:52] standing there when he did it he said I
[1:52:54] was only a voice that he used to say it
[1:52:57] it wasn't what I knew it's what I
[1:52:59] surrendered myself to that he spoke
[1:53:02] through it isn't me it wasn't the
[1:53:03] seventh angel oh no it was the
[1:53:06] manifestation of the son of man it
[1:53:08] wasn't the angel his
[1:53:10] message it was the mystery that God
[1:53:13] unfolded it's not a man it's God the
[1:53:16] angel was not the son of man he was the
[1:53:19] messenger from the son of man the son of
[1:53:22] man is Christ he's the one that you're
[1:53:25] feeding on you're not feeding on a man a
[1:53:28] man his words will fail but you're
[1:53:31] feeding on the unfailing body word of
[1:53:33] the son of man can you say
[1:53:37] Amen so you have to feed
[1:53:40] fully I'm I'm rep paraphrasing it the
[1:53:44] way brother Brown said he's asking the
[1:53:45] question but I'm going to he said you
[1:53:48] have to feed fully on every word to give
[1:53:52] yourself srength to Fly Above All these
[1:53:55] denominations and things of the world
[1:53:57] can you say Amen he's our present help
[1:54:00] in time of trouble he's the one you're
[1:54:03] feeding on
[1:54:06] Amen he's come to bring
[1:54:10] judgment and we see where the world's
[1:54:12] Fallen apart but at the same time he's
[1:54:14] come to be your food to give you
