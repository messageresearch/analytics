[3:55] we just pray a special blessing on
[3:57] brother Andrew and sister Mariah
[4:01] father give them rest and peace Father
[4:05] Lord and just let everything just work
[4:08] out okay
[4:10] we ask it in Jesus Christ's name the
[4:13] church says amen amen
[4:17] just the first verse the Lord is my
[4:20] shepherd
[4:21] I shall not want. amen
[4:26] and then if you'd like to turn with me
[4:28] the Book of John
[4:30] the first chapter
[4:38] amen
[4:42] John 1
[4:45] and I think we're going to start at the
[4:50] 28th verse
[4:53] says these things were done in
[4:56] [Music]
[4:57] bethabara
[5:00] Beyond Jordan where John was baptizing
[5:04] the next day John saith Jesus coming
[5:06] into him and saith Behold the Lamb of
[5:09] God
[5:10] was taketh away the sin of the world
[5:14] this is he of whom I said after me
[5:17] cometh a man which referred before me or
[5:21] which is preferred before me for he was
[5:25] before me and I knew him not but that he
[5:28] should be made manifest to Israel
[5:30] therefore I am come baptizing with water
[5:34] and John bear records saying I saw the
[5:37] Spirit descending from heaven like a
[5:39] dove
[5:40] and yet Abode upon Him amen you can have
[5:46] your seats this evening
[5:48] and I want to
[5:51] just continue with the thought the Lord
[5:54] is my shepherd
[5:56] and pray that it'll be a blessing and
[5:59] certainly don't want to be repetitious
[6:02] but yet I
[6:04] I have a
[6:08] just uh something on my heart and yet I
[6:11] don't know how to get it out per se but
[6:13] pray the Lord will help us
[6:15] but of course David here saying the Lord
[6:18] is my shepherd and and and David you
[6:21] know he was a a shepherd and he was a
[6:23] Woodsman and
[6:24] and uh so he he used different
[6:28] terminologies
[6:31] um
[6:32] as that would be fitting uh maybe for
[6:36] his understanding his way of life and
[6:39] just like in one place he said as the
[6:41] heart penneth after the water Brook
[6:43] so does my soul long after thee
[6:48] and so him knowing the nature of the of
[6:51] deer and
[6:54] um so he he would compare the same
[6:56] thirst that a deer would have maybe when
[6:59] it was wounded and it's searching for
[7:01] water and and it's just that desperate
[7:05] need for water
[7:06] and he would compare his soul to that
[7:09] that he was desperate for God and and so
[7:13] um uh and and so the prophet said that
[7:18] God dealt with David according to the
[7:20] way his mind ran
[7:22] and he says he he does that with all of
[7:26] his uh men he said God always deals with
[7:28] men just according to the way that their
[7:30] minds run
[7:32] and so you know David being out in the
[7:35] in the wilderness way out there with the
[7:39] the sheep and it was drives thirsty and
[7:43] there he would say in Psalm 63 1 my soul
[7:47] thirsteth for thee My Flesh longest for
[7:50] thee in a dry and thirsty land where no
[7:54] water is and so he he would compare his
[7:57] experiences with God to to the things of
[8:01] the natural
[8:02] but here in our opening scripture he
[8:04] writes the Lord is my shepherd I shall
[8:07] not want he leadeth me
[8:10] and you know
[8:14] talking there I I believe that this is
[8:17] very applicable
[8:19] uh for us today
[8:21] the Lord being the shepherd and weeping
[8:25] his sheep
[8:26] and
[8:28] David didn't say they lead me but he
[8:31] said he leadeth me
[8:33] so it's not speaking of plural but it's
[8:35] it's one it's it's a relationship and
[8:39] there is no other that would lead David
[8:42] or lead the children of God than the
[8:45] Lord himself
[8:46] it is he that leadeth me David would say
[8:49] beside the Still Waters he leadeth me in
[8:53] the paths of righteousness for his
[8:56] name's sake ain't that right
[8:58] now this is this leading is is is
[9:04] um
[9:05] very very few can follow that leadership
[9:09] especially in this day and and because
[9:14] Paul would write in second Timothy three
[9:17] and two he said for men shall be lovers
[9:20] of their own selves
[9:22] Covetous boasters proud blasphemers
[9:25] disobedient to parents unthankful and
[9:28] holy with now without natural affection
[9:31] truce Breakers false accusers
[9:34] incontinent fears despisers of those
[9:36] that are good brother Brown puts that
[9:38] emphasis the bride
[9:41] Traders heady high-minded lovers of
[9:44] pleasure more than lovers of God
[9:47] and and he would say now people say well
[9:50] that's just that's the heathens that's
[9:53] just flat ungodly hell-bound people we
[9:57] all can recognize them but then Peter or
[10:00] Paul would say but having a form of
[10:02] godliness but denying the power thereof
[10:05] ain't that right
[10:07] so so brother Branham would let us in on
[10:10] it having a form see anointed ordained
[10:13] ministers having a form of godliness but
[10:17] denying that he's the same yesterday
[10:20] today and forever
[10:22] that now notice these so that they would
[10:24] be heady high-minded lovers of pleasure
[10:26] more than lovers of God lovers of their
[10:29] own selves
[10:30] and and they would have this form of
[10:32] godliness so religious going to church
[10:36] worshiping God so they say but they
[10:40] would deny his power
[10:42] they would deny the power that would
[10:45] come
[10:45] and and so uh in other words they deny
[10:48] his word and and so the prophet would
[10:51] say how do they deny Jesus in that day
[10:53] who did they deny when they denied Jesus
[10:57] it was the word for in the beginning was
[11:00] the word and the Word was made flesh and
[11:03] dwelt Among Us ain't that right and and
[11:06] so whatever word that that was
[11:08] prophesied of of the Messiah in the Old
[11:11] Testament well that word became flesh
[11:14] and fulfilled every Prophecy of the Old
[11:17] Testament that spoke of the Messiah
[11:20] he he was the sacrifice that that
[11:23] natural lamb spoke of in the Old
[11:25] Testament he was the altar he was the
[11:27] high priest he was he he was at all and
[11:30] and everything was types and shadows
[11:32] that spoke of the Messiah ain't that
[11:35] right so when they rejected him they
[11:38] rejected the word every prophecy in
[11:42] every type and every shadow that was in
[11:45] the Old Testament that spoke of him they
[11:47] denied it all and said that it can't be
[11:49] so because here he is he's fulfilling
[11:51] the very word
[11:53] so they they didn't realize they were
[11:55] thinking they were they they were just
[11:57] rejecting that man but they were
[12:00] actually rejecting the word and so they
[12:03] were religious they talked from their
[12:04] Bible but they denied the present day
[12:08] were now we all know that he's the word
[12:11] ain't that right we know he's the word
[12:13] because John said he was in the
[12:15] beginning was the word the word was with
[12:18] God the Word was God John 1 1 and then
[12:21] John 1 14 and the Word was made flesh
[12:24] and dwelt Among Us so they crucified the
[12:27] word they denied the word and and it was
[12:31] the present day word oh they could tell
[12:33] you about Moses and said where of Moses
[12:35] and and they were clinging to Moses but
[12:38] Moses was already gone past he had
[12:40] already he had already preached his day
[12:42] but here was Jesus the word fulfilling
[12:44] what Moses said would happen
[12:46] and they denied him so what what are
[12:50] they doing today the same thing anointed
[12:53] preaching the gospel of Pentecost but
[12:56] denying the present day promise of the
[12:59] word being Vindicated Jesus Christ the
[13:02] same yesterday today and forever ain't
[13:05] that right so we can say well Jesus
[13:07] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[13:09] forever then why does people turn him
[13:11] down when he tries to do what he'd done
[13:13] back then he tried to do today they say
[13:16] oh that's mental telepathy well he
[13:18] discerned Peter
[13:20] he told Peter he was he told Nathaniel
[13:23] who he was
[13:24] didn't even know them and yet he told
[13:26] them who who they were and what they'd
[13:29] done and all of that ain't that right
[13:30] but when Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[13:33] today and forever done it in this day
[13:36] they turned him away and said oh that's
[13:38] Beelzebub that's mental telepathy that's
[13:40] of the devil don't you listen to that
[13:41] ain't that right
[13:43] so so then he says from such turn away
[13:46] Pete Paul says that for this of this
[13:49] sort are they which creep into houses
[13:52] and Lead captive silly women Laden with
[13:56] sins LED away with divers lost so now
[14:00] this is prophetica of today in this age
[14:02] an hour that they would the ministers
[14:05] would deny the Lord or deny the power
[14:08] they would have the form of godliness
[14:10] the people would have a form of
[14:11] godliness but would deny the power
[14:14] thereof and this would be those that
[14:18] would creep into houses televisions and
[14:21] and TV evangelists and radio preachers
[14:24] and and all of these things and and and
[14:27] Lead captive silly women Laden with sin
[14:31] LED away how are they LED away not by
[14:35] the shepherd
[14:36] but with divers or various lusts now
[14:41] brother Brown says see it's ours they
[14:43] say well our sowing parties and our so
[14:45] and so somebody come around trying to
[14:47] misinterpret the word and saying this
[14:49] will it's all right sister for you to
[14:51] have short hair see don't pay no
[14:53] attention to that nitwit see you you you
[14:56] just wear this it's not that it's it's
[14:59] not about pants it's not about the the
[15:01] the the clothing that you wear your
[15:04] outward appearance see it's what comes
[15:06] out of the man's heart that defiles him
[15:08] see and so he says do you realize that
[15:11] you're Anointed with an evil lustful
[15:13] dirty spirit
[15:15] ain't that right see you might sing in
[15:18] the choir with short hair but you've got
[15:20] an evil spirit and that's contrary to
[15:23] the word
[15:24] ain't that right so then he says see
[15:27] it's these groups of people full of
[15:29] Blasphemous names calling themselves
[15:31] Christians that with forms of godliness
[15:35] but denying the power thereof from such
[15:39] turn away for this is the sword that
[15:42] leads silly women Laden with various or
[15:45] diver's lust now notice it's not talking
[15:47] about Godly Godly sisters and that that
[15:51] that's not what he's talking about see
[15:53] and and you sisters should be thankful
[15:56] every day that God has separated you uh
[16:00] from such scriptures as this because
[16:03] there are women that that aren't silly
[16:06] women you know you understand what I'm
[16:09] saying that's what Paul called them
[16:10] they're LED away silly women leading
[16:13] lead way captive by their uh various
[16:16] loves but God's got real genuine sisters
[16:21] that that just believe the word of God
[16:24] ain't that right see and and so you you
[16:28] you understand that they are being led
[16:31] but they're not being led by the
[16:34] shepherd amen they're they're they're uh
[16:37] the shepherd's not doing the leading now
[16:40] another place in second Peter 3 and 14
[16:42] it says wherefore beloved seeing that
[16:46] you look for such things be diligent
[16:48] that you may be found of him in peace
[16:53] without spot and blameless ain't that
[16:57] right and the count that the
[16:59] long-suffering of Our Lord is salvation
[17:02] even as our beloved brother Paul also
[17:05] according to the wisdom given unto him
[17:07] hath written unto you as also in all his
[17:11] of his Epistles see speaking in them of
[17:15] these things in which are some things
[17:17] hard to be understood which they that
[17:20] are unlearned and unstable rest in other
[17:24] words they wrestle with these scriptures
[17:26] see as they do also the other scriptures
[17:29] unto their own destruction
[17:32] amen God didn't write the scriptures
[17:34] that we would wrestle with them and
[17:37] fight with them and struggle with them
[17:39] but we would accept them as the truth
[17:43] do you believe that now now Peter is
[17:46] saying that these things are hard to be
[17:47] understood but none other but
[17:49] nonetheless they are for our benefit and
[17:52] if we wrestled against them therefore
[17:54] our destruction
[17:56] now ye therefore beloved seeing you know
[18:00] these things before listen beware lest
[18:03] you also being led everybody say LED
[18:06] away with the heir of the wicked fall
[18:10] from your own steadfastness ain't that
[18:13] right so it's in this age in this hour
[18:17] that many people are being led by the
[18:22] error of the wicked ain't that right but
[18:26] then there is a group you know Romans 8
[18:29] and 14 Paul would write for as many as
[18:32] are LED everybody say lead by the spirit
[18:36] of God they are the sons of God Amen so
[18:41] they're not being led by their various
[18:45] or divers lusts they're not being led
[18:48] away with the heir of the wicked but
[18:51] these are actually sons of God that are
[18:55] led by the spirit of God so many today
[18:59] are being led by their own lusts and
[19:02] that word lusts is desire their own
[19:05] desire their own craving their own ones
[19:07] their own passions amen the way they
[19:11] view their scriptures the way they
[19:12] interpret things and way they really
[19:14] want to be and and all of these things
[19:17] and you know we can get our own
[19:19] interpretation of scriptures by our own
[19:21] desire
[19:22] you understand what I'm saying amen well
[19:25] if we don't want to do this certain part
[19:27] of the scripture well we can actually
[19:28] explain that part away and just tell you
[19:32] know to show amen and justify ourselves
[19:35] but see they're being led by their own
[19:38] lusts and then there's millions that are
[19:40] being led Away by the error of of the
[19:44] wicked ain't that right but very few are
[19:48] being led by the spirit of God now now
[19:51] as I said you know uh last time uh this
[19:55] scripture Psalms 23 it's been used in
[19:57] funerals it's been used everywhere as a
[20:00] as a comfort to many people but yet it's
[20:04] not to be used as just a cliche it's
[20:07] it's not just to be used as just to pour
[20:09] them on the wall but but this is a
[20:12] literal thing the Lord is my shepherd
[20:14] you see when the Lord when we view the
[20:17] Lord amen we must view him not as just a
[20:21] god up in the in the heavens uh uh not
[20:24] as one that is just coming back amen but
[20:26] we must view him as our Shepherd
[20:29] personal can you say man it's not just
[20:33] the Shepherd of the world he's my
[20:35] shepherd and I am his sheep
[20:38] I'm his lamb ain't that right and and so
[20:42] uh the sons of God can be led by the
[20:46] spirit of God because they are Lambs of
[20:50] God do you believe that they are lambs
[20:53] and the prophet would tell us when he
[20:55] can have complete everybody say complete
[20:58] control of us when he can have complete
[21:03] control of us a man then he can lead us
[21:07] and guide us ain't that right amen but
[21:11] as long as we've got we're giving him
[21:13] Park control amen he's not going to be
[21:16] able to lead he's he's not going to be
[21:18] able to guide and this why it takes a
[21:21] lamb because as we said a lamb is
[21:24] willing a lamb forfeits everything a
[21:27] lamb is dumb a lamb cannot a sheep
[21:30] cannot lead sheep sheep cannot lead
[21:32] itself they've got to have a Shepherd
[21:35] can you say amen and this is why that
[21:38] God would like in his people as sheep
[21:41] not trying to tell God what to do not
[21:44] trying to explain this Bible away not to
[21:47] spend all your Christian Life a man just
[21:50] uh uh ignoring the word of God ignoring
[21:53] what the events are happening today amen
[21:57] and and these things because we just
[21:59] can't believe it we just can't see how
[22:01] it how God would send a prophet in this
[22:03] days so we'll shut up Malachi 4 and 5
[22:06] and act though as though it doesn't
[22:08] exist we'll we'll take all of these
[22:10] scriptures that explained today and the
[22:13] events of what's happening and if we're
[22:15] not sheep if we don't have that sheep
[22:17] like nature amen we'll sit there and
[22:19] argue with God
[22:21] but God cannot lead us and guide us into
[22:25] uh until he has the complete control of
[22:29] us can you say man and and so he must
[22:32] have complete control everybody say
[22:34] complete control the shepherd must have
[22:37] complete control of us in other words
[22:39] he's got to have a strong influence in
[22:42] your life ain't that right he's got to
[22:45] have more influence in your life than
[22:46] Mom and Dad he's got to have more
[22:49] influence in your life amen than the
[22:51] president of the United States or the or
[22:53] the Republican party or the Democrat
[22:55] Party or he's got to have more influence
[22:58] in your life than your job your money
[23:01] your retirement package your wife your
[23:04] husband the preacher whatever God's got
[23:07] to have the strong influence the main
[23:11] influence in your life
[23:14] he's got to have that because he's the
[23:17] one that has to have complete control do
[23:20] you believe that a man see and so now if
[23:24] you're looking at it the word again the
[23:26] Lord is my shepherd and you know what
[23:28] the shepherd is it's the anointed word
[23:31] the anointed word is what you're
[23:33] following
[23:34] ain't that right amen well it's it's
[23:37] true and and so uh we find that that in
[23:42] the Book of John and I won't keep you
[23:44] alone tonight but in the Book of John we
[23:47] we read where Jesus is identified as
[23:51] being the Lamb of God
[23:53] and and the Lord God is identified as
[23:57] the dove ain't that right he saw the
[24:00] spirit of God descending upon him like
[24:03] an unto a dove and where did he send
[24:05] descend upon where did he light upon not
[24:08] the church not denomination not some
[24:11] Priest Some Bishop he he landed upon the
[24:14] lamb
[24:16] John just identified him and said this
[24:19] is the Lamb of God
[24:20] he's the lamb ain't that right to take
[24:23] away the sins of the world Amen and when
[24:26] he identified that God would identify
[24:29] with his Spirit forming as a dove in the
[24:32] form of a dove why the dove is the
[24:35] gentlest most meekest most cleanest bird
[24:38] in all of heavens
[24:40] and the lamb is the most jetless the
[24:43] meekest the uh uh uh animal of all the
[24:47] Earth amen and so we find that when the
[24:50] land the dove descends upon the Lamb of
[24:54] God a voice speaks from heaven and says
[24:57] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[25:00] pleased to dwell in ain't that right he
[25:04] was pleased to dwell in now the prophet
[25:08] said this was one of the greatest events
[25:10] that had ever taken place up to that
[25:13] time amen why amen you sin the dove come
[25:17] up on that lamb what is it it was the
[25:20] Dove and lamb uniting together
[25:23] Heaven and Earth embraced each other
[25:28] God and man become one
[25:32] can you say amen God was able to become
[25:36] one with man again amen see and so this
[25:41] is when God came down from the spirit
[25:43] form and was made a man and dwelt Among
[25:47] Us
[25:48] that's when all eternity embraced each
[25:51] other that's when the human Fallen race
[25:54] of Adam's people and Jehovah God and
[25:57] every angel came together when God and
[26:01] man was made one on that great Memorial
[26:04] Day when John baptized Jesus ain't that
[26:08] right so what a time that was and When
[26:12] sin had separated man and and and and
[26:16] and Driven Man from God and and and and
[26:19] and oh my what a what a a wreck we were
[26:24] that God finally had a man upon the
[26:28] Earth with the right nature
[26:30] that he could come down and be with man
[26:34] again and unite himself to where the
[26:37] word would become flesh
[26:40] ain't that right in so much that when
[26:43] Philip says oh talking to Jesus said it
[26:45] would suffice us if you would show us
[26:48] the father and fill it and Jesus said
[26:50] Philip have I not have I been so long
[26:52] with you and you still don't know who I
[26:54] am he that has seen me has seen the
[26:57] father
[26:58] can you say Amen then how sayest thou
[27:02] show us the father
[27:05] a Oneness
[27:07] amen that you realize this couldn't have
[27:10] happened if Jesus would didn't have a
[27:12] lamb nature
[27:13] if he wasn't a lamb so as we stated
[27:16] before that Jesus was led not driven
[27:20] and sons of God are LED and not driven
[27:25] when it gets to the place you have to be
[27:27] driven
[27:30] driven
[27:32] it's it's it's wrong relationship
[27:36] you got to get the lamb like nature
[27:38] ain't that right
[27:40] he was led by the spirit the prophet
[27:43] said to take Peter James and John to
[27:45] this exceeding high mountain he was led
[27:49] he was led to Golgotha he was led to
[27:52] pilate's Hall he was led to the mountain
[27:55] of uh to the Wilderness to be tempted
[27:57] why he was a lamb
[27:59] ain't that right so now this is the same
[28:03] Oneness that Jesus prayed for In You and
[28:06] I
[28:07] you believe it John 17 19 and for their
[28:11] sakes I sanctify myself again that
[28:14] showed he was a lamb he forfeited every
[28:16] right he had as a human being for your
[28:19] sake that's what the prophet said he
[28:22] could have had a wife but he forfeited
[28:24] for your sake he could have done this he
[28:26] could have done that he could have done
[28:28] he could have had it all he could have
[28:29] the wealth of the world but he forfeited
[28:32] it for your sake
[28:34] and he said I sanctify myself for their
[28:37] sakes that they also might be Sanctified
[28:40] through the truth ain't that right what
[28:43] a lamb
[28:44] neither pray I for these alone but for
[28:48] them also which Shall Believe on me
[28:51] through their word that they all may be
[28:54] one as thou father art in me and I am
[28:58] thee that they also may be one in us
[29:02] that the world may believe that thou has
[29:04] sent me and the glory which thou gavest
[29:08] me I have given them that they may be
[29:11] one even as We Are One thank you
[29:18] hello now they try to show that Jesus is
[29:21] one in the sense that the flesh was one
[29:23] deity the flesh was not deity
[29:27] or that flesh couldn't have died
[29:30] and you say man that flesh bled that
[29:33] flesh hungered that that flesh thirsted
[29:37] that flesh sought for the father's will
[29:42] that flesh had to pray just like you
[29:44] have to pray
[29:48] ain't that right
[29:50] see make them one even as We Are One
[29:54] i in them thou in me that they may be
[29:58] made perfect in one and that the world
[30:01] may know that thou has sick me and has
[30:04] loved them as thou has Loved Me Do You
[30:07] Realize they're questioning the the the
[30:10] legitimacy of Jesus birth they're re
[30:13] they're they're questioning the
[30:15] legitimacy of his life
[30:18] they're questioning the legitimacy of
[30:21] who he is
[30:22] but when you and I become one with the
[30:25] father it's when they will know that
[30:28] what he truly was
[30:32] hello
[30:33] amen because he says this now because he
[30:37] says I am them thou and me that they may
[30:39] be perfect and one that the world may
[30:41] know
[30:42] that thou has sent me
[30:45] and just love them as thou has left me
[30:48] father I will that they also whom thou
[30:51] has given me be with me where I am that
[30:55] they may behold my glory which thou has
[30:58] given me for thou lovest me before the
[31:01] foundation of the world o righteous
[31:04] father what a prayer huh the world hath
[31:08] not known thee but I have known thee and
[31:11] these have known that thou has sent me
[31:14] and I have declared unto them thy name
[31:16] and will declare it that the love we're
[31:20] with thou has loved me may be in them
[31:23] and I am them
[31:26] can you say Amen
[31:28] so see he's praying for Oneness now you
[31:31] know when man traveled to this part
[31:33] country or to this land they United
[31:36] themselves as one people
[31:40] and you know that that's all right but
[31:43] the thing of it was is they United under
[31:46] the wrong leadership
[31:48] they United themselves under the
[31:51] leadership of men
[31:53] can you say Amen
[31:54] and the prophet said but God wants man
[31:57] to unite unto the leadership of himself
[32:01] so so when when we're looking at the
[32:04] Lord as my shepherd it's not just easy
[32:06] to say the Lord is my shepherd
[32:09] amen
[32:10] you you he cannot be your Shepherd when
[32:13] you're trying to unite unto the
[32:15] leadership of some man
[32:18] when you're when you're coming under the
[32:20] wrong leadership and remember the church
[32:22] is all over are coming under the wrong
[32:24] leadership oh yes they're joining
[32:27] themselves together they are becoming
[32:30] one that they're becoming one under the
[32:32] World Council of churches instead of
[32:34] this word
[32:36] it
[32:37] ain't that right
[32:39] now God wants us to be one
[32:42] but he wants to be one in us and with us
[32:48] that's his Oneness
[32:50] ain't that right that's what the prophet
[32:51] said he wants to be one with us
[32:54] a man so man wants his fellow man to be
[32:57] his leader and unite under the wisdom of
[33:00] his fellow man
[33:01] man wants to be one why does man want to
[33:05] be one because God made him to be one
[33:08] ain't that right a banshee and so God
[33:12] designed him for that purpose God
[33:14] designed man the prophet would tell us
[33:16] made him up to be one to work together
[33:19] to cooperate together that's the makeup
[33:22] of man that's the way God made him but
[33:25] man wants to have his idea about it he
[33:28] wants to project something God that God
[33:30] never intended him to do he wants to
[33:34] figure his own ways out he wants to make
[33:36] his own plans he won't accept the plan
[33:39] that God made for him why it's because
[33:43] of his Fallen nature
[33:46] ain't that right
[33:48] so we see that being led of God just
[33:52] doesn't come automatically because
[33:54] you're raised in church or you've been
[33:56] raised in a Christian home
[33:58] and it isn't even because you accept the
[34:01] Lord Jesus as your savior
[34:03] or baptized you know in in the name of
[34:06] Jesus Christ
[34:08] amen we all know we all have this carnal
[34:11] nature and and a carnal mind carnal
[34:13] nature it and and it's something that is
[34:15] constantly working against God
[34:18] working against God
[34:21] be so religious as you want and still
[34:24] work against God
[34:26] ain't that right because it's not
[34:28] subject to the laws of God and Paul
[34:31] would tell us in Romans it cannot be it
[34:34] cannot be subject to the laws of God
[34:37] Amen see a man Isaiah 55 and 8 it says
[34:42] for my thoughts this is God telling us
[34:43] my thoughts are not your thoughts
[34:45] neither are your ways my ways saith the
[34:49] Lord for as the heavens are higher than
[34:51] the earth think of that as high as the
[34:54] heavens amen are higher than the earth
[34:56] so are my ways higher than your ways and
[35:00] my thoughts higher than your thoughts
[35:03] can you shame man that's right see so it
[35:06] shows that there can be no connection
[35:08] between God and man a man with the
[35:12] carnal nature
[35:14] you can think about God but you'll think
[35:16] of him in your own ideas
[35:19] you can talk about God that'll be in
[35:21] your own interpretation of him
[35:25] can you say Amen
[35:27] that there can be no connection between
[35:29] God and man until the nature their
[35:33] nature agrees together
[35:36] Dove and lamb
[35:38] ain't that right
[35:40] amen Dove nature doesn't agree with the
[35:43] wolf nature it just can't do it it takes
[35:46] the lamb nature
[35:48] yes sir
[35:49] now we know that a man can do God a
[35:52] service and not be his in his will
[35:55] and well I'm going to do this and I'm
[35:57] doing that and I'm doing this and it's
[35:58] all religious and it all looks good and
[36:00] yet it can be a service unto God and it
[36:03] not be the will of God
[36:06] but notice the prophet says but a man
[36:09] cannot be led by the spirit of God and
[36:11] get out of the will of God
[36:14] if you're LED if a man is truly led by
[36:17] the spirit of God it's impossible for
[36:20] him to get out of the will of God
[36:22] that you can do god of service and not
[36:25] be his will
[36:27] ain't that right
[36:28] brother Brandon said because as long as
[36:30] he's led by the spirit that's God's will
[36:33] sometimes he does things that he don't
[36:35] even know why know what he's doing
[36:37] himself and don't realize why he does do
[36:40] it but it's God working it around for
[36:42] the good
[36:44] ain't that right
[36:46] but then we find a group of people
[36:48] Matthew 7 and 21 not everyone that saith
[36:51] unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the
[36:53] kingdom of heaven but he everybody say
[36:56] but
[36:57] that's a big word but he that doeth the
[37:01] will of My Father which is in heaven
[37:04] ain't that right there's going to be
[37:06] many people busy doing the things of God
[37:08] doing for the kingdom of God and yet not
[37:11] all of them are going to enter into the
[37:13] kingdom in that day
[37:15] but he that doeth the will of My Father
[37:18] which is in heaven in other words he
[37:21] that was the sheep and I could lead him
[37:23] and I could Shepherd him amen and lead
[37:26] him in the will of my father can you say
[37:29] Amen many will say to me in that day
[37:32] Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy
[37:34] name and in thy name have cast out
[37:36] devils and in thy name done many
[37:38] wonderful Works see it was their
[37:40] interpretation amen of what they thought
[37:43] God wanted ain't that right that they
[37:46] were led by their own pernicious ways
[37:48] they they were led by their own divers
[37:50] lust they were led by the the heir of
[37:53] the wicked can you say Amen thinking
[37:57] that was that was that's the thing that
[37:59] God would uh approve of well sure we
[38:02] would think God would approve of the
[38:04] blind eyes being open we think God would
[38:07] approve of all the Miracles that we're
[38:09] doing and all the things that are done
[38:11] but if it's not according to his will
[38:17] and you say Amen
[38:19] so although they were performing Miracle
[38:22] signs and wonders
[38:24] they don't have that lamb-like nature
[38:27] to be led by the spirit
[38:30] you remember Peter
[38:32] Peter before he was converted he did
[38:34] what he wanted to do too
[38:38] yeah ain't that right
[38:40] John 21 18 Jesus tells Peter verily
[38:43] verily I say unto thee when thou was
[38:45] young
[38:46] now Curtis thyself and walk just wither
[38:50] thou woodst
[38:51] but when thou shalt be old Thou shalt
[38:53] stretch forth thine hands and another
[38:55] shall gird thee and carry thee wither
[38:58] thou wouldest not
[39:01] ain't that right
[39:03] but I want you to notice the day that
[39:04] we're living in because I think this
[39:07] Bears a great responsibility upon every
[39:11] believer for this age now brother Bram
[39:14] says this he says no one would have any
[39:16] more respects for John Wesley sancti
[39:19] Moody Finney Knox Calvin a lot of them
[39:23] great men of past ages and and and any
[39:27] of those men than any of us ministers
[39:31] who appreciate men of God that would
[39:34] have for those men amen but you see
[39:37] we're coming on up on up we're not in
[39:39] that age
[39:41] you with me we're not in that age each
[39:45] one of them served in a different age
[39:47] and in a different measure but we're
[39:49] serving God today
[39:51] in a different measure from what they
[39:55] were
[39:57] you with me
[39:59] and he says if there is a tomorrow there
[40:02] will be an age and there will be a
[40:04] gospel for that age that will still
[40:08] advance until the whole thing is
[40:11] complete in God and God becomes one with
[40:16] us
[40:17] so as the day goes by there is a church
[40:21] that is becoming more like God
[40:25] the very thing that Jesus prayed for of
[40:28] a church becoming one with the father as
[40:32] he was one with the father it's
[40:34] happening in this age
[40:37] so I want you to understand that now
[40:39] we're Beyond just church ages we're just
[40:42] we're not just playing Church
[40:44] we're not we're not just Patty caking
[40:46] around
[40:46] we're not just doing our little Duty
[40:48] coming to church and hearing John 3 16
[40:51] of how God so loved the world and we
[40:53] just all have a little a simple little
[40:55] message and it's just flowery and and
[40:57] then we just go home and just continue
[40:59] with our lives that's not what we're
[41:02] doing but we're understanding to brother
[41:04] Amos the true purpose of God there's a
[41:07] reason why he saved you there's a reason
[41:09] why he filled you with the Holy Ghost
[41:12] that there's a reason why he Sanctified
[41:15] you from all the filth and the sin and
[41:18] the uncleanliness of this world he wants
[41:21] to come to you like he came to Jesus on
[41:23] that day
[41:25] in the form of a dove he wants to come
[41:28] but you must have a nature that can be
[41:30] acceptant of him
[41:35] God becoming one
[41:37] think of that
[41:39] that's why I had no wonder
[41:42] Brandon would preach the lamb and the
[41:44] dove
[41:45] many times he had preached that sermon
[41:48] and
[41:48] other other sermons
[41:51] he would preach and he would talk about
[41:53] that lamb
[41:55] and the dove
[41:58] everybody
[42:01] now notice
[42:03] John 16 12.
[42:05] Jesus says I have yet many things
[42:08] to say unto you but
[42:11] you cannot hear them or bear them now
[42:16] albeit
[42:18] when he or by say he
[42:21] personal pronoun
[42:23] one person
[42:26] when he the spirit of Truth
[42:29] is come he will guide you
[42:33] into all truth
[42:36] for he shall not speak of himself but
[42:38] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[42:40] speak and he shall show you things to
[42:42] come he shall glorify me and he shall
[42:44] receive of mine and shall show it unto
[42:47] you
[42:49] I believe this is in connection with
[42:51] Revelations 10 1.
[42:56] where John saw the mighty angel coming
[42:59] down
[43:01] he the spirit of Truth came
[43:05] hello
[43:10] he the spirit of Truth came with an open
[43:13] book
[43:17] man was shut up from the truth
[43:20] there were truths in every age but it
[43:23] was just a little truth
[43:25] just a sliver of Truth
[43:28] uh we know these things
[43:31] uh Martin Luther had truths but he
[43:34] didn't have all the troops
[43:36] yeah just a little truth just shall live
[43:39] by faith
[43:40] ain't that right
[43:42] but he was still a drunk
[43:45] he didn't even teach he didn't teach the
[43:47] ways of holiness
[43:49] and they they were all worldly
[43:52] but then God would send a little bit
[43:54] more truth John Wesley with the with the
[43:56] message of sanctification
[43:58] to line it all back up and said yes it
[44:01] is just shall live by faith but you
[44:03] can't just live anywhere you want
[44:06] ain't that right
[44:08] but then here come that restoration of
[44:10] gifts there's a little more truth along
[44:12] at a time
[44:14] amen and here come the Pentecostals with
[44:17] the restoration of gifts
[44:20] ain't that right
[44:22] that yet they still didn't have all the
[44:24] truth because they were still baptized
[44:25] at Him Father Son and Holy Ghost
[44:30] some of them didn't believe in miracles
[44:34] a lot of the truth they didn't even know
[44:37] him as this Jesus Christ that's the same
[44:40] yesterday today and forever
[44:42] and even though they were up there in
[44:44] Azusa Street having a great time and
[44:47] still didn't have the truth that he was
[44:49] the same yesterday today and forever
[44:52] but then the lamb opened the book
[44:57] Revelations 5.
[45:00] the lamb opened the book ain't that
[45:03] right and John saw that Mighty Angel
[45:06] come down with an open book now we know
[45:09] it wasn't a literal book
[45:11] it was the revelation of the book
[45:14] being made known to the people
[45:18] can you say Amen the prophet said the
[45:20] lamb took the book Glory open the book
[45:22] tore off the seals and sent it down to
[45:25] the Earth to his seventh angel
[45:27] Revelation 10 7 talks about that angel
[45:30] to reveal it to his people
[45:34] can you say Amen
[45:36] well do you love him
[45:38] can we just go there Revelations 10 7
[45:40] right fast
[45:42] amen
[45:46] Revelations
[45:48] 10
[45:50] and 7.
[45:52] but in the days of the wars of the
[45:54] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[45:56] sound the mystery of God should be what
[46:00] vanished
[46:02] revealed
[46:03] as he hath declared to his servants the
[46:06] prophets ain't that right so all the
[46:09] Mysteries were revealed at the sounding
[46:12] of the Seven Angels message
[46:14] ain't that right
[46:16] what did it reveal the hidden thoughts
[46:18] of God
[46:20] all right ain't that right it revealed
[46:24] the truth
[46:25] it revealed what was the truth ain't
[46:28] that right
[46:29] what was in the mind of God is the truth
[46:33] what is the doctrines of God is the
[46:35] truth
[46:36] there's the doctrines of man that ain't
[46:38] the truth but there is a doctrine of God
[46:41] that is the truth
[46:43] ain't that right the thoughts of man are
[46:46] nothing but lies but there is a thought
[46:49] that is the truth and that's the thought
[46:51] of God
[46:53] ain't that right did you know that there
[46:55] is a real truth about a son of God
[47:01] we think a Son of God is just about
[47:03] church membership
[47:06] signing a a a name on a piece of paper
[47:09] all right I'm going to heaven because I
[47:11] belong to I belong to this denomination
[47:13] I belong to that that ain't the truth
[47:17] that some man-made thing that was
[47:20] conjured up years ago
[47:25] ain't that right
[47:27] people sign their souls away
[47:30] trying to be Catholic and and they're
[47:32] all good people and they're trying to be
[47:34] right before God but there is a truth
[47:37] about it
[47:39] there's a truth about being a son of God
[47:42] did you know a Son of God was never
[47:44] saved on any given day
[47:46] you as always saved
[47:49] now aren't you glad that that mystery
[47:51] has been revealed to you
[47:55] you always were saved in the mind of God
[47:58] you were an eternal thought of God
[48:01] before the foundation of the world God
[48:03] just didn't know you when you was born
[48:05] he always knew you
[48:07] [Music]
[48:09] the Bible says that Jesus was the lamb
[48:11] slain before the foundation of the world
[48:13] he was slain before the world was ever
[48:17] formed in the mind of God yes it
[48:20] happened on Earth that it was already
[48:22] done in the mind of God and you were
[48:24] saved yes you come to an altar but you
[48:27] were already saved in the mind of God
[48:30] praise God God knew you were going to
[48:32] have to do it God knew that a prophet of
[48:36] Malachi 4 would come in this age it was
[48:39] the mind of God
[48:41] ain't that right
[48:43] the prophet said you wasn't saved on any
[48:45] day you was always saved Jesus just come
[48:49] to redeem that but you were saved from
[48:51] the beginning because you had eternal
[48:53] life to begin with
[48:55] think of the god is eternal what is the
[48:58] son
[48:59] a son is a gene seed of their father
[49:02] ain't that right well if that's in the
[49:05] natural then you're a gene seed of God
[49:06] if you're a Son of God you're an
[49:08] attribute of God you're an attribute of
[49:10] his thinking
[49:12] ain't that right so you was always with
[49:15] God in his mind he knew you would come
[49:18] you're not an accident he knew you would
[49:21] come in this Sage he knew you'd be here
[49:23] tonight
[49:24] yes sir and he knows where you're going
[49:27] he knows what your future is that's the
[49:30] truth
[49:31] and he sent his blood to loose you from
[49:35] your sin that's the truth
[49:38] you're filled with the baptism of the
[49:40] Holy Ghost you're sealed them that's
[49:42] what Paul said you grieve not the spirit
[49:44] of God whereby you're sealed unto the
[49:47] day of your Redemption how can you be
[49:50] lost then
[49:52] [Music]
[49:54] he's going to lead you into all truth
[49:57] isn't he
[49:58] we want to know what's truth
[50:02] well then say oh you can't be that you
[50:05] can't there there cannot be no security
[50:06] to Salvation there is a security to
[50:10] Salvation he does it when he seals you
[50:13] praise the Lord
[50:18] see a trout fish can never be a gar or a
[50:21] tadpole he might be in the same water
[50:22] with him
[50:24] but he was from the beginning of trout
[50:27] the Ned only caught him but he was that
[50:30] from the beginning
[50:31] and you were a Son of God from the
[50:33] beginning
[50:37] is this all right
[50:39] I know it's simple
[50:42] I uh we think of redemption
[50:45] the Bible says he come to redeem
[50:49] now we think of saved that he come
[50:55] something new
[50:57] but the Bible says he redeemed us with
[50:59] his own blood
[51:00] we are redeemed now the word redeemed is
[51:03] to bring back
[51:04] to the original place
[51:11] I've told you this before and I
[51:15] I think it's worth telling tonight but
[51:21] I had a
[51:24] well first of all
[51:26] we had young people over a few years
[51:29] back and the boys got to wrestling in
[51:31] the kitchen
[51:32] and
[51:34] one of them hit a plate I think it was
[51:38] or a pitcher or something glass and
[51:41] and it fell to the floor and it just
[51:43] shattered
[51:46] you know and
[51:47] actually I just bought that for my wife
[51:51] and
[51:53] now you're thinking of it now there's no
[51:55] way no way possible
[51:58] that I could put that plate or picture
[52:01] back together
[52:03] I had not the power
[52:07] to to put it back together and present
[52:09] it to my wife
[52:11] as it was in the beginning
[52:15] so therefore I could not redeem it
[52:19] now I could replace it
[52:22] which I think I did hopefully
[52:28] I could go to the store and get one just
[52:31] like it
[52:33] but I didn't redeem it
[52:36] because to redeem I had to take that
[52:39] very plate that was broken in thousands
[52:42] of pieces
[52:43] put it back together as though it never
[52:46] happened
[52:50] now what if I had the power to glue it
[52:53] all
[52:55] and I put it all pieces glued it's been
[52:57] hours to glue it all back and it's I say
[52:59] here
[53:00] you see all the fractures in it the line
[53:02] it still wasn't redeemed
[53:04] it had to be back the way it was
[53:08] ain't that right
[53:09] so I was not its Redeemer I couldn't
[53:11] redeem it I I only replaced it
[53:15] but the Bible says we were redeemed
[53:19] by the blood of Jesus Christ
[53:22] right now this is the spirit of truth
[53:25] that come to lead us in the truth that
[53:27] we weren't just saved we were redeemed
[53:32] so if he redeemed us we had to be
[53:35] somewheres
[53:36] and the where we were in the beginning
[53:38] was in the mind of God
[53:41] now can I tell you where we were in the
[53:42] mind of God we were perfect in the mind
[53:45] of God we were holy in the mind of God
[53:48] we were Sanctified in the mind of God we
[53:52] were not a sinner in the mind of God we
[53:55] were Sons and Daughters of God in his
[53:58] mind
[53:59] I came here as a sinner
[54:04] and I need it to be redeemed
[54:07] but who was the one that could put me
[54:09] together
[54:12] can you say Amen
[54:14] there was nobody that could put me
[54:16] together no preacher could no Pope could
[54:19] no denomination good but God himself
[54:22] became a lamb
[54:25] and was led to Calvary and by that
[54:29] shedding of his blood was able to put
[54:33] all my pieces back together as though I
[54:37] never did it in the first place
[54:39] that's why you're not just forgiven you
[54:43] are Justified
[54:45] and the word Justified is though you're
[54:48] never done it in the first place
[54:54] aren't you glad
[54:56] that the spirit of Truth in this day
[54:58] would lead us in all truth
[55:01] oh goodness
[55:03] never did it
[55:05] now what did the prophet say
[55:07] he said now
[55:10] you could forgive me he said so let's
[55:13] just say
[55:14] how was that
[55:16] you know you heard that I went and done
[55:19] something
[55:21] or maybe I'd done something wrong to you
[55:23] brother peel
[55:27] and I come to you and ask you to forgive
[55:29] me
[55:31] and you'd say well I forgive you
[55:33] it's all done it's it's forgiven well
[55:35] you could forgive me but I'm still not
[55:37] justified
[55:38] because I did it
[55:41] you understand what I'm saying
[55:42] I did it now God didn't want to just
[55:45] forgive you of your sins
[55:47] he wanted to so redeem you that you
[55:50] could be justified
[55:53] right
[55:57] so then brother Branham uses the other
[55:59] analysis
[56:01] of how that maybe you heard that
[56:04] we'll use brother Amos you heard brother
[56:06] Amos went and got drunk
[56:09] he's out in the bar you heard he was out
[56:11] in the bar just stumbling around
[56:12] crousing and you heard that
[56:16] and he's just like oh my goodness a
[56:18] preacher
[56:20] brother Amos would do that poor Sister
[56:22] Lisa
[56:25] did she drive him to that or what
[56:30] and you'd have all these thoughts
[56:33] probably the first thing on the phone
[56:37] but then you heard
[56:40] that it was all a lie
[56:44] you heard that it wasn't true
[56:46] right
[56:47] you heard he he wasn't at the bar he
[56:50] wasn't drinking he wasn't caroused
[56:52] everything you heard about it was a lie
[56:54] it was wrong it was it was false to it
[56:57] and yet you still went to him
[57:00] and said brother Amos I forgive you
[57:03] then he could look at you and see but
[57:04] but what would you forgive me for
[57:06] I didn't do it
[57:11] can you say man
[57:13] I I I wasn't there I didn't do it that's
[57:16] what Justified means
[57:20] that God would so redeem you that you
[57:23] would be justified that there would be
[57:26] nothing to accuse you anymore
[57:29] that you could say but what sin are you
[57:32] talking about I never did do it why
[57:36] because now you're coming back to the
[57:38] thoughts of God
[57:40] God never saw you as a sinner he saw you
[57:43] as a son
[57:44] [Applause]
[57:48] well do you love him
[57:52] he's going to lead you no truth aren't
[57:54] you glad for an open book
[57:56] I'm glad for the spirit of truth that
[57:58] would come in this age
[58:03] he shall Lead You In All truth about
[58:05] Jesus name baptism
[58:07] he shall lead you into the truth
[58:09] about there being only one God
[58:12] working in three offices
[58:15] he shall lead you into the truth
[58:17] of the four stages of perfection
[58:20] three stages of the new birth four
[58:22] stages of perfection
[58:24] he's going to lead you into all truth
[58:26] can you say Amen
[58:28] he's going to lead you into the truth of
[58:30] what Romans 8 and 29 for whom he did for
[58:33] no he did predestinate to be conformed
[58:37] to the image of his son that he might be
[58:40] the firstborn among many brethren
[58:44] more over whom he did predestinate them
[58:47] he also past tense called and whom he
[58:50] passed ins called them he also Justified
[58:53] and whom he justified them he also past
[58:57] tense already glorified
[59:01] can you say amen and ye shall lead you
[59:04] into all truth
[59:08] not just to see your present but to see
[59:11] your past
[59:12] not of what you did in this time but
[59:15] what you were in God and to show you
[59:18] what you are in the future
[59:21] you realize your future is secure
[59:28] and it takes the spirit of Truth to lead
[59:31] you
[59:32] into all truth
[59:35] can you say Amen
[59:37] he led you this far did he not
[59:39] he led you to an altar he led you to
[59:41] baptism he led you to the infilling of
[59:43] the Holy Ghost he leading you to the
[59:45] manifestation of sonship why it's the
[59:48] truth about you that's what he thought
[59:49] about you that's what is true and he's
[59:52] leading you from truth to truth the
[59:54] truth the truth everything about what
[59:57] he's leading you is truth
[59:59] Hallelujah
[1:00:01] Hallelujah
[1:00:03] Romans 8 19 for the earnest expectation
[1:00:07] of the creature waited for the
[1:00:08] manifestation of the sons of God
[1:00:10] that's truth
[1:00:14] for the creature was made subject to
[1:00:16] vanity not willingly he was made a
[1:00:19] sinner not willingly but we were
[1:00:22] we were born in sin shape and iniquities
[1:00:24] come into this world speaking lies not
[1:00:25] willingly but we were we were slaves to
[1:00:29] the devil not willingly but we were can
[1:00:32] you say amen amen but by reason of him
[1:00:35] who has subjected you also in Hope
[1:00:39] even just to subject you into this world
[1:00:42] of sin but he subjected you in a hope
[1:00:47] glory to God because the creature itself
[1:00:50] shall so shall be delivered from the
[1:00:51] bondage of corruption into this glorious
[1:00:54] Liberty of children of God
[1:00:58] that's the truth
[1:01:02] so the spirit of Truth didn't just come
[1:01:04] to educate us about truth he come to
[1:01:07] lead us into
[1:01:10] all truth
[1:01:14] well do you love him
[1:01:17] second Corinthians 3 17 now the Lord is
[1:01:20] that spirit and where the spirit of the
[1:01:22] Lord is there is Liberty
[1:01:24] What Spirit the spirit of Truth
[1:01:26] there's liberty aren't you glad you got
[1:01:28] Liberty to be sons of God how did you
[1:01:31] get that Liberty the spirit of Truth
[1:01:33] came
[1:01:33] and opened a book and he's leading you
[1:01:36] all truth and you're finding there's
[1:01:37] more Liberty than you've ever had you
[1:01:40] didn't have Liberty in the denomination
[1:01:41] you didn't have Liberty out in the world
[1:01:43] but when you heard the spirit of truth
[1:01:45] and the spirit of Truth began to lead
[1:01:47] you it began to give you Liberty
[1:01:50] we need the spirit of the Lord how many
[1:01:52] believes that we need the spirit of the
[1:01:54] Lord why it breaks the shackles
[1:01:57] it breaks the Fetters it frees you
[1:02:02] oh yes sir yes sir it changes things
[1:02:05] look Genesis 1 1 in the beginning God
[1:02:08] created the Heaven and Earth and the
[1:02:10] Earth was without form and void and
[1:02:13] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[1:02:14] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[1:02:17] face of the waters what did it do it
[1:02:20] changed the situation around it
[1:02:23] transformed everything what looked Bleak
[1:02:26] what looked hopeless the spirit of God
[1:02:28] changed it all
[1:02:30] amen that's why it's so important to
[1:02:33] entertain the spirit of God when he
[1:02:35] comes Among Us like he did Sunday night
[1:02:39] as the spirit of God coming Among Us why
[1:02:41] amen he's trying to lead us into truth
[1:02:44] and Satan was trying to bind us and he
[1:02:46] was trying to put shackles upon us he
[1:02:48] was trying to get us into a place of
[1:02:50] discouragement a place of hopeless but
[1:02:53] the spirit of God came and broke the
[1:02:55] shackles that he could continue to lead
[1:02:58] and guide and what does Satan always
[1:03:01] want to do he wants to point all the
[1:03:03] ugliness about it
[1:03:06] yeah
[1:03:08] yes sir
[1:03:10] he'll show you everything that is wrong
[1:03:13] and if you're not careful you'll miss
[1:03:15] your opportunity when God comes knocking
[1:03:18] some people have walked away from the
[1:03:20] spirit of God because they looked at it
[1:03:22] as being wrong they looked and say well
[1:03:24] I can't believe that's happening I can't
[1:03:25] believe that I can't believe that and
[1:03:27] what they don't realize is why they're
[1:03:29] looking at that the spirit of God is
[1:03:31] moving and many times they miss their
[1:03:35] last opportunity
[1:03:37] [Music]
[1:03:40] can you say man
[1:03:42] the spirit of Truth is more than an
[1:03:44] intellectual speech
[1:03:47] it's the spirit of God come and breaking
[1:03:49] shackles
[1:03:50] breaking yokes
[1:03:52] amen
[1:03:55] well surely you can say Amen to that
[1:03:58] it's truth
[1:03:59] ain't that Ryan he's going to lead you
[1:04:02] and guide you into all truth
[1:04:04] amen that's why the devil fights you
[1:04:06] with mind battles but then the spirit of
[1:04:07] God comes and breaks that power
[1:04:11] Hallelujah
[1:04:13] we didn't have the spirit of God
[1:04:15] breaking the Batman the shackles
[1:04:17] how we going to be led
[1:04:20] hello
[1:04:22] you find the shepherd is one that takes
[1:04:24] care of us he don't just lead us he
[1:04:25] takes care of us
[1:04:30] he keeps us from the evil
[1:04:32] when the lion come after that sheep
[1:04:34] David under the inspiration of God
[1:04:37] portraying the very spirit of God went
[1:04:40] after that line and brought that sheep
[1:04:42] back
[1:04:44] then you say man he brought and went and
[1:04:47] got that sheep out of the Bear's mouth
[1:04:49] and brought that sheet back
[1:04:52] and I'll tell you what God does it a lot
[1:04:54] when he brings his Spirit down upon us
[1:04:57] amen he's putting us he's rescuing us
[1:04:59] from the enemy I don't care if it's an
[1:05:01] enemy of sickness I don't care if it's
[1:05:03] an enemy of depression I don't care what
[1:05:07] enemy he's troubling you the spirit of
[1:05:09] God will rescue you
[1:05:12] amen
[1:05:15] that's why we need the spirit of God in
[1:05:17] our services
[1:05:22] amen
[1:05:26] now listen as we get ready to close
[1:05:29] how did he lead Israel
[1:05:32] Exodus 13 21.
[1:05:35] and the Lord went before them by day in
[1:05:37] a pillar of cloud to lead them the way
[1:05:42] and by night in a pillar of fire you
[1:05:45] realize that Pillar of Fire
[1:05:47] is the same pillar fire that we're just
[1:05:49] reading about
[1:05:52] that is not a makeup
[1:05:54] it's not a Photoshop
[1:05:57] it's proven to be the genuine Pillar of
[1:05:59] Fire
[1:06:01] and that same pillar fire was hearing
[1:06:03] the scriptures leading to Israel
[1:06:05] can you say Amen
[1:06:07] oh goodness
[1:06:09] and the Lord went before them by day in
[1:06:13] a pillar of the cloud
[1:06:15] now we saw that in 1963 come
[1:06:18] did we not
[1:06:20] the whole world recognized it they
[1:06:22] didn't know what it was but there was a
[1:06:24] prophet on the earth that said that's
[1:06:26] what this is it's the same pillar of
[1:06:29] cloud it's a cloud of angels
[1:06:33] the world has again has that traditional
[1:06:35] thought that it's always a Thunderhead
[1:06:37] cloud
[1:06:38] but if you trace it all the way back in
[1:06:40] the Bible days it was a cloud of angels
[1:06:44] can you say Amen now you say well I
[1:06:47] don't believe that then you've got to be
[1:06:48] a sheep
[1:06:50] to be led into all truth
[1:06:52] can you say man
[1:06:54] see you have to forfeit your rights but
[1:06:56] he says see and by night in a pillar of
[1:06:59] fire to give them light to go by day and
[1:07:03] night can you say amen he took not away
[1:07:06] the pillar of cloud by day nor at the
[1:07:08] pillar of Fire by nine from before the
[1:07:12] people and why did he send them send
[1:07:16] these to lead the people to a land of
[1:07:21] promise
[1:07:24] oh my isn't the Lord wonderful
[1:07:28] the Lord is my shepherd
[1:07:32] and if you notice the traits of how he
[1:07:34] leads his people
[1:07:36] then you can see what he's doing in this
[1:07:38] age here
[1:07:40] pillar of cloud
[1:07:42] Pillar of Fire
[1:07:44] a prophet on the earth an angel gone
[1:07:47] before
[1:07:49] what
[1:07:51] Leading the People into all truth
