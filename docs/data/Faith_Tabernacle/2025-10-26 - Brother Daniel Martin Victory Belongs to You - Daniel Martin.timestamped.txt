[33:17] that the Lord would just really just
[33:20] continue to doing a work in her. Amen.
[33:23] We uh want to keep her in our prayers.
[33:26] He uh pulled a muscle uh or something in
[33:28] there in his lower back. Amen. He's in

[33:39] needs a healing in her body. So, let's
[33:41] just remember her. Uh we want to keep
[33:44] brother John and sister Kim weeks uh in
[33:47] our prayers. They're out traveling,
[33:49] amen, this morning. So we want to uh

[33:59] Uh they would be traveling um tonight or
[34:03] tomorrow. So let's just keep them in our
[34:06] prayers. Let's just remember uh Dad as
[34:09] he ministers the word this morning there
[34:11] in Arkansas. Amen. That the Lord would
[34:14] just move in a special way. Amen. Maybe
[34:18] ask brother Amos if he would come and
[34:20] and lead us in prayer and I'll let you
[34:22] read these. Amen. How many has an
[34:25] unspoken request? Lift your hands. Amen.
[34:28] The Lord sees every need this morning.

[34:34] &gt;&gt; How many want to see miracles?
[34:36] raise your hand. All right, just turn
[34:39] around and look at look at all the
[34:40] miracles. It's in here. Go ahead, turn
[34:43] around. Look at each other. You're
[34:45] seeing miracles change lives. That's the
[34:48] greatest miracle that could ever happen.
[34:51] There's, you know, here this morning. I
[34:54] know of one, maybe there's more. There's
[34:56] a former alcoholic here and he was an
[35:00] alcoholic, Brother Bob Simpkins, many
[35:03] years ago. Now, that's under the blood.
[35:05] We ain't trying to bring back the old
[35:07] man, but that's a testimony of God's
[35:10] grace. And I could probably go down the
[35:13] list and there was probably somebody in
[35:14] here that abused maybe substances or
[35:18] some other had a habit of some kind and
[35:21] God delivered you from it. And that's a
[35:24] miracle. That it's a miracle. Changed
[35:27] lives. Liars, thieves, whoreongers, the
[35:31] whole nine yards. Paul said of such were
[35:34] some of you. But you're washed. You're
[35:36] cleansed. Glory to God. You're a new
[35:39] man, new creature. Old man's passed
[35:41] away. Behold, all things become new.
[35:44] I have a few more requests to add to
[35:47] that
[35:48] large list. And that is uh let's
[35:52] remember
[35:54] brother John this morning u and and all
[35:57] the other young men that are attending
[36:01] Virginia Tech and also Liberty. brother
[36:04] Christian down there, they have have to
[36:08] deal with certain things. And you know,
[36:10] if God's called you to be a brick layer,
[36:12] a farmer, or an accountant or professor
[36:15] or a doctor, I still believe God's
[36:18] calling people to do those kinds of
[36:19] things.
[36:22] Amen.
[36:23] So, let's remember
[36:25] these. And then I also have a request.
[36:29] God knows her need and that is Sister
[36:31] Leah Hope of Manitoba. Uh she really
[36:35] needs the Lord to yield to the spirit in
[36:39] her life. Let's remember her. Uh I got a
[36:42] prayer request yesterday from Sister
[36:45] Pamela Tilson who attends brother David
[36:48] Farmer's Church in Marian. Uh she's got
[36:51] a really rather serious infection that
[36:54] has set in on that part of her leg that
[36:58] was amputated, the stump that's left of
[37:01] her leg. and it sounds really really
[37:04] serious and she is diabetic.
[37:07] So knowing all of that, we really need
[37:10] God to move for her. She's requested
[37:13] prayer.
[37:15] Uh it's also come across my heart the
[37:18] other evening and not much is said about
[37:21] it and out of sight out of mind
[37:24] ignorance and not ignorance because you
[37:28] want to be ignorant but a lot of times
[37:30] people won't give these reports but as
[37:34] some of you may not realize
[37:38] but there this message has gone to every
[37:40] nation

[37:44] believers s at this time living in
[37:47] Russia. There is a me there are message
[37:50] churches in Russia. There is Russian
[37:54] ministry pastors, evangelists and so
[37:57] forth that have been ministering in
[37:58] Russia and that war that's going on in
[38:01] Ukraine. Russia has reached almost
[38:05] economic collapse. I mean it they've
[38:08] talked about it for a while already, but
[38:10] it's about to go down. Uh we don't hear
[38:14] the things from the media about what's
[38:17] really going on inside the country, but
[38:19] things is getting tough financially for
[38:23] a lot of people. Even the wealthy are
[38:26] curving their their expenditures because
[38:29] and the price of goods has gone through
[38:31] the roof. Fuel, long lines at gas
[38:34] stations and many places you can't get
[38:37] fuel. So, let's remember these requests,
[38:40] the ones that brother, our brother here
[38:43] mentioned, that God will move. He's a
[38:45] God of miracles. He's doing things all
[38:48] the time. Amen. So, let's all pray
[38:52] together this morning if you would. Our
[38:54] heavenly father God, Lord, as I stand
[38:56] here and I look out over this
[38:59] congregation, I know that my brothers
[39:00] and sisters have experienced many
[39:02] miracles in their life. Most of all, the
[39:05] greatest thing was a changed nature. A
[39:08] supernatural change down in their soul,
[39:10] Lord God. Where the old sin nature was
[39:13] eradicated, the new was birthed. The the
[39:16] attribute, Lord, of that true soul, dear
[39:19] God, was birthed into the kingdom of
[39:21] God. It was resurrected by the power and
[39:24] spirit of God that has come to dwell
[39:26] within. And for that, we're grateful,
[39:28] Lord. We're thankful this morning. We're
[39:30] thankful for Sister Martha and Brother
[39:33] Tim. Glory God. I know that Sister
[39:35] Martha is enduring some symptoms in her
[39:39] body even right now, Lord. And Father
[39:42] God, Brother Tim as well getting over
[39:44] the effects. And I understand somebody
[39:46] mentioned about a pulled muscle. They're
[39:48] no fun, Lord. They're very, very
[39:51] painful. God, we pray for their
[39:53] recovery. We think of Sister Kimberly,
[39:55] Lord. Sister Kim Brumfield, Lord, that's
[39:58] with us. Sister Kimberly, that's out
[40:00] this morning. Lord God, we remember both
[40:02] of them. Lord Jesus and Sister Rhonda
[40:05] understand Lord, she's with us this
[40:07] morning by faith, by fa by revelation.
[40:10] She's here, God. She desired to be here
[40:13] this morning despite whatever is
[40:15] bothering her, Father God, this morning.
[40:17] She's determined as the rest of us here,
[40:20] God is determined to be here, Father
[40:23] God. Lord, regardless of physical
[40:25] circumstance to hear the word of God, to
[40:28] come and worship together, Lord God,
[40:30] with a body, Father God, that is our
[40:32] desire. Lord, you see and you know and
[40:34] you've heard these requests that we have
[40:36] mentioned, dear God. We know that the
[40:39] healing, Lord, you've already healed. If
[40:42] you were here physically today, you
[40:44] could do no more as far as healing for
[40:46] us, dear God, because that you took care
[40:48] of nearly 2,000 years ago. It's up to us
[40:52] to already believe what you've already
[40:54] done. And help us, God, to have that
[40:58] revelation this morning. We know that
[40:59] faith is a revelation. And God, we must
[41:03] have that faith that only comes from
[41:06] you, Lord God, where we can believe
[41:09] these things and know that when we pray,
[41:11] we pray, our hearts condemn us not. We
[41:13] have confidence towards God. We know
[41:15] that you hear our prayer, Lord Jesus,
[41:17] and you will answer. You are more than
[41:21] willing. You don't hold a carrot on a
[41:22] stick, Lord God, to see how long we can
[41:25] hold out, God. That's the devil's
[41:27] tricks. But dear God, we know that
[41:29] you're more than willing, Father God, to
[41:33] supply each and every one of our needs
[41:35] that are represented here this morning,
[41:37] even those that are not represented.
[41:39] Lord, Leo Hope there in Canada, Lord
[41:41] God. Lord, we've been praying for a long
[41:44] time. You've done some good things for
[41:46] her, dear God. She needs a real move in
[41:48] her life. I pray God, you see all the
[41:51] requests that was mentioned, Lord, we
[41:53] don't have to re go over them again. We
[41:56] pray you be with each and every one.
[41:58] Bless our brother as he brings the word
[41:59] to us this morning. We ask it all in
[42:02] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; Still an empty grave.
[42:13] Know you like we do.
[42:17] There is power in your name. You can be
[42:22] seated.
[42:23] So much power
[42:26] in your name.
[42:31] Move the unmovable.
[42:34] Break the unbreakable.
[42:37] God we believe.
[42:40] God we believe for it. from the
[42:44] impossible.
[42:47] We'll see a miracle.
[42:50] God, we believe.
[42:53] God, we Brother Terry, do you have a
[42:55] song for us? Move the unmovable.
[43:00] Break the unbreakable.
[43:03] God, we believe.
[43:06] God, we believe for it from the
[43:10] impossible.
[43:12] will see a miracle.
[43:15] God, we believe.
[43:19] God, we believe
[43:21] for it.
[43:24] Amen. How many believers do we have this
[43:27] morning? Amen.
[43:35] [Music]
[43:41] Well, I'll just sing this. Well, it's
[43:43] not an old song. It's I've sang it two
[43:45] or three times, but surely going to be a
[43:48] change after a while. And I think it's
[43:50] getting closer and closer. As brother
[43:52] Amos talking about, you know, Russia and
[43:54] different things. And you know, Brother
[43:56] Bram said one place when Russia goes
[43:57] down to get that oil, if they're almost
[43:59] bankrupt, they probably need some extra
[44:01] money. So, I don't know how it's going
[44:03] to take place, but God will have his
[44:05] bride ready. It'll be a change after a
[44:07] while. In the Bible, we are told of an
[44:11] angel to behold. Yes, a prophet sent to
[44:14] change the course of man.
[44:17] Oh, in a lowly place of birth came a
[44:21] light down to the earth. For it was
[44:23] proof a mighty gift had blessed our
[44:26] land.
[44:27] Now, the time of change is here. And the
[44:30] sign he said was clear that when a stake
[44:33] was driven down into the ground
[44:37] for we was told to travel west that a
[44:40] people might be blessed at the season
[44:43] that the thunders were to sound.
[44:47] I'm telling you there'll be a change
[44:50] after a while. Oh
[44:53] where we now wear a crown we'll wear a
[44:55] smile.
[44:57] Oh, we may suffer pain or loss, but
[45:00] Jesus died upon the cross that we might
[45:03] have a change after a while.
[45:07] The price of change was high and cost
[45:09] and died at all that total loss when the
[45:13] angel put his feet on land and sea.
[45:17] But the bride was watched in bleach. Put
[45:20] her sans far out of reach. Now the
[45:22] virgin bride stands absolutely free.
[45:26] I'm telling you, there'll be a change
[45:29] after a while. Oh,
[45:32] where we now wear a frown, we'll wear a
[45:35] smile.
[45:36] Oh, we may suffer pain or lo, but Jesus
[45:40] died upon the cross that we might have a
[45:43] change after a while. This last verse,
[45:46] the rapture call has done, gone out. We
[45:49] saw the cloud and heard the shout. We're
[45:52] looking for our change just any day.
[45:56] My brother, listen while I sing. The
[45:59] word inside you is the thing. It'll take
[46:02] us home, my friend. No matter what they
[46:04] say,
[46:06] I'm telling you, there'll be a change
[46:09] after a while.
[46:11] Oh, where we now wear a frown, we wear a
[46:14] smile.
[46:16] Oh, we may suffer pain or loss, but
[46:19] Jesus died upon the cross that we might
[46:22] have a change. That we might have a
[46:26] change. That we might have a change
[46:29] after a while,
[46:32] [Music]
[46:39] man. Do you believe that this morning?
[46:43] We
[46:45] shall be changed.
[46:49] Yes, we shall be changed.
[46:54] Oh, changed from this mortal to
[46:57] immortality
[47:00] in the twinkling of an eye.
[47:04] Oh yes, we shall be changed.
[47:10] We shall be changed.
[47:14] Oh, changed from this mortal immortality
[47:20] in the twinkling
[47:23] and high. One more time we shall be
[47:28] changed.
[47:30] Oh, we shall be changed.
[47:35] Oh, changed from this mortal
[47:38] immortality
[47:41] in the twinkling of
[47:44] their eye.
[47:47] Amen. I believe that just any day now.
[47:50] Amen. Can we stand to our feet now?
[47:53] Amen. And as we get ready to go to the
[47:55] word, can we sing that song? I'm going
[47:57] to see a victory.
[48:01] The weapon, the weapon may be formed,
[48:04] but it won't prosper.
[48:09] When darkness falls, it won't prevail.
[48:16] Cuz the God I serve knows only how to
[48:20] triumph.
[48:23] And my God will never fail.
[48:29] Oh my God will never fail.
[48:35] Oh, I'm going to see a victory.
[48:39] I'm going to see a victory.
[48:43] For the battle belongs to you, Lord. Oh,
[48:50] I'm going to see a victory.
[48:53] I'm going to see a victory.
[48:57] For the battle belongs to you, Lord.
[49:04] Oh, there's power in the mighty name of
[49:08] Jesus.
[49:11] And every war he wages, he will win.
[49:18] And I'm not backing down from any giant
[49:24] cuz I know how this story ends.
[49:31] Yes, I know how this story ends. Oh, I'm
[49:37] going to see a victory.
[49:40] I'm going to see a victory.
[49:44] For the battle belongs to you, Lord.
[49:50] Oh, I'm going to see a victory.
[49:54] I'm going to see a victory.
[49:58] For the battle belongs to you, Lord. Oh,
[50:04] I'm going to see a victory.
[50:07] I'm going to see a victory.
[50:11] For the battle belongs to you, Lord.
[50:17] Oh, I'm going to see a victory.
[50:21] I'm going to see a victory.
[50:24] For the battle belongs to you, Lord.
[50:32] Amen. Do you believe that you're going
[50:33] to see a victory? Amen. Can we just bow
[50:36] our heads once again? Dear heavenly
[50:38] father, Lord, we just thank you, Lord,
[50:41] for filling your presence here this
[50:43] morning, Lord. And Lord, I I pray now,
[50:46] Lord, as we go into your word, Father. I
[50:49] pray that you would come and bless it,
[50:50] Lord. I Lord, I I pray, Lord, that you
[50:53] would just speak through me, Lord. Help
[50:55] me to get myself out of the way, Lord.
[50:58] And Lord, I pray that you would help the
[51:00] the congregation, Lord, to get
[51:01] themselves out of the way, Father. Lord,
[51:04] that they that they may be able to
[51:06] receive your word this morning, Lord.
[51:08] Lord, we love you. We thank you for all
[51:10] that you've done. We ask it in your
[51:12] lovely name, Jesus Christ. Amen. We
[51:15] pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. It's really good
[51:19] to be in the house of the Lord this
[51:21] morning. Amen. Can as the musicians uh
[51:24] can be dismissed. Amen. I'd like to turn
[51:27] uh to uh First Peter. Amen. Chapter 5.

[51:47] sheet for the fall festival is in the
[51:50] back if you're uh not able to sign up
[51:54] yet. Amen. Just a reminder there. Amen.
[51:58] But 1 Peter chapter 5 and verse 8
[52:04] through uh verse 10.
[52:08] Amen. It says, "Be sober. See, be sober.
[52:11] Be viligent because your adversary the
[52:13] devil is as a roaring lion walketh about
[52:17] seeking whom he may devour. whom
[52:19] resisteth steadfast in the faith,
[52:22] knowing that the same afflictions are
[52:24] accomplished in your brethren that are
[52:26] in the world. But the God of all grace,
[52:29] who hath called us unto his eternal
[52:32] glory by Christ Jesus, after that he has
[52:35] suffered a while and make you perfect,
[52:38] established, strengthened, settled you.
[52:41] Amen. If we could also turn to Ephesians
[52:50] Amen. Ephesians chapter 6. We're all
[52:53] familiar with this verse.
[52:57] Amen. Ephesians chapter 6
[53:00] verse 10.
[53:08] Amen. It says, "Finally, my brethren, be
[53:11] strong in the Lord and in the power of
[53:13] his might. put on the whole armor of God
[53:16] that you may be able to stand against
[53:18] the ws of the devil. For we wrestle not
[53:21] against flesh and blood, but against
[53:24] principal uh principalities and against
[53:26] the powers, against the rulers of the
[53:28] darkness of this world, against
[53:30] spiritual wickedness in high places.
[53:33] Wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[53:35] of God. Amen. He's he's not saying just
[53:37] some of it. Amen. and just little pieces
[53:40] here and there. But he says to take the
[53:41] whole armor of God that you may be able
[53:44] to withstand in the evil day and having
[53:46] done all to stand. Stand therefore
[53:50] having your loins gird about with truth
[53:52] and having on the breastplate of
[53:54] righteousness and your feet shaw with
[53:56] the preparation of the gospel of peace.
[54:00] But above all, taking the shield of
[54:01] faith, wherewith you shall be able to
[54:03] quench all the fiery darts of the
[54:06] wicked, and take the helmet of salvation
[54:09] in the word, or in the sword of the
[54:11] spirit, which is the word of God,
[54:14] praying always with all prayer and
[54:16] supplication in the spirit, and watching
[54:18] there with all perseverance and
[54:20] supplications
[54:21] for all saints. Amen. You can be seated
[54:24] this morning. Amen. Uh if we could u
[54:29] maybe read one more there in
[54:30] Revelations.
[54:32] Amen. Revelations chapter 3.
[54:38] Amen. Revelations 3. We all are familiar
[54:41] with this as well.
[54:44] But Revelations chapter 3 verse 21 says
[54:47] to him that overcomemeth will I grant to
[54:50] sit with me in my throne even I as I
[54:53] also overcome and am sit down with my
[54:56] father in his throne. Amen. I I would
[54:59] like if I could take a title this
[55:01] morning um and I would like to uh just
[55:05] speak uh this morning on vic victory
[55:08] belongs to you. Amen. and and um I want
[55:13] to just take my time this morning and
[55:15] it's it's a very lengthy subject. I took
[55:18] this uh this part of this message from
[55:21] um um the greatest battle ever fought.
[55:25] Amen. So um if you want to go back and
[55:27] listen to that. Amen. And uh but maybe
[55:31] we can eventually maybe do another part
[55:33] if the Lord wills. Amen. But victory
[55:36] belongs to you. And and we know that
[55:38] we're living in troublesome times uh
[55:40] this morning. Amen. We've we've come
[55:42] through great wars after war. And and we
[55:45] know that the world has been soaked with
[55:47] human blood. This earth is just soaked
[55:50] with the with with the blood ever since
[55:53] the blood of Abel was spilled. And and
[55:55] and just battle after battle. Amen.
[55:58] There's just war. World War I, World War
[56:01] II, so many other world uh wars that
[56:03] we've come through. And here we know
[56:06] that uh uh uh they're talking of World
[56:08] War II happening and and it's just been
[56:11] war after war and and and just death
[56:14] after death and and if the earth stands
[56:18] and and the Lord carries anymore, we'll
[56:20] just keep having more wars. Amen. And
[56:23] yet we read there in our our opening
[56:25] scripture, as Christians, our battles
[56:27] are different. Amen. Our script as
[56:30] Christians, we we we don't fight against
[56:33] flesh and blood. Amen. As Christians,
[56:35] our battle is a spiritual battle. Amen.
[56:38] We fight against the darkness of the
[56:40] world. We fight against Satan and his
[56:42] angels. Amen. And the only way we can
[56:44] stand against the ws of the devil is to
[56:47] put on the whole armor of God this
[56:50] morning. Amen. And if I would just uh uh
[56:53] talk about that for a while, the uh just
[56:56] to lay a foundation. Amen. And we know
[56:59] that there is uh really only two powers
[57:01] in the world today. We have God's power
[57:04] and then we have Satan's power. And all
[57:07] of our differences between nations and
[57:09] differences between each other and
[57:11] everything is mount up to only two
[57:12] powers. Amen. And these only two powers.
[57:16] There's only two kingdoms. And brother
[57:18] Brandham says all the rest, all the
[57:20] little minor things are connected with
[57:21] either one of those powers. And those
[57:23] powers is God's power and Satan's power.
[57:25] Amen. and end every war, every disorder,
[57:28] everything that comes along, it's either
[57:30] controlled by God's power or Satan's
[57:32] power cuz that's the only two powers
[57:35] there is. And that is the only and that
[57:37] is the power of life and the power of
[57:39] death. Amen. Now, that's the only two
[57:42] powers. And the power that Satan's got
[57:45] is a perverted power of God. It's no
[57:48] real power at all. It's a perversion of
[57:50] God's power. Everything that Satan has,
[57:52] Amen. Death is only a perverted uh
[57:55] perversion of life. Amen. Lie is only
[57:58] the truth mistold. Amen. See, adultery
[58:01] is only a righteous act misused. Amen.
[58:04] And everything that Satan has got is
[58:06] something that's that's been perverted.
[58:08] And and but but it's his power. Amen.
[58:11] And and we are today sitting here a and
[58:15] one or the other power is what's going
[58:16] to control us. Amen. We come this
[58:19] morning uh controlled by one by by one
[58:22] power or the other. And as Christians,
[58:24] it should be our desire to be controlled
[58:26] by God's power this morning. Amen. To
[58:29] follow in his will. Amen. Brother
[58:31] Brandham says a devil is almost harmless
[58:34] unless he can have something to work in.
[58:36] He's God. Amen. You remember those
[58:38] devils that were cast out of Legion?
[58:39] They had they want to do more
[58:41] mischievous things. So they wanted to go
[58:43] into hogs. So devil uh so devils must
[58:47] have something to work in, somebody to
[58:49] work through. And that's the way God
[58:52] does it, too. He has to have us. He's
[58:55] depending on us to work through us.
[58:57] Amen. And so, so we must cast down the
[59:00] evil one. Amen. Let's take our positions
[59:03] like the stars of heaven. Brother
[59:04] Brandham says, "Amen." The Bible speaks
[59:07] of wandering stars. Amen. Over there in
[59:09] the book of Jude, I believe, foaming out
[59:12] out their own shame. He says, "Amen. And
[59:14] we don't want to be wondering stars
[59:16] wondering if this is right. Wondering if
[59:18] that is right. Amen. Wondering if this
[59:21] will happen. Wondering how that's going
[59:22] to happen. Wondering how I'm going to
[59:24] get my healing. Wonder how my children
[59:26] are going to be saved. See, just
[59:28] wondering stars. Amen. But don't wander
[59:30] around. Amen. Stay like those stars of
[59:33] the heaven. A real soldier at his post
[59:35] of duty. Stand there believing. Amen.
[59:38] Life or death. Amen. And so any army
[59:42] first is getting ready for battle. Amen.
[59:45] First there's got to be a select of some
[59:47] soldiers. Amen. They've got to be
[59:49] dressed for fighting. They've got to be
[59:51] trained for fighting. Amen. You can't
[59:53] just pull someone off the street and and
[59:55] hand them a weapon and say, "Go fight
[59:57] the enemy and expect them to stay at
[59:59] their post of duty. Expect them to do
[1:00:01] what you expect them to do." Amen. But
[1:00:04] first, there has to come a training
[1:00:06] first. Amen. They have to be dressed for
[1:00:08] fighting. Amen. And and you know, we've

[1:00:38] here. here's here's what you need. Just

[1:00:42] the enemy. That doesn't happen. Amen. Uh
[1:00:45] but there has to come a training. There

[1:00:53] He had to he has to learn how to follow
[1:00:56] orders. He has to learn how to become a
[1:00:58] good soldier. Amen. And that's the same
[1:01:01] way with God's army this morning. Amen.
[1:01:03] Brother Brandham says, "I believe that
[1:01:05] God has been selecting his soldiers. I
[1:01:07] believe that he's been dressing them and
[1:01:09] he's been training them and the
[1:01:11] battlefront is now set getting ready to
[1:01:13] start. Amen. This great first battle
[1:01:15] that was ever fought begin in heaven.
[1:01:17] Amen. When Michael and his angels uh uh

[1:01:23] angels. Amen. See, sin did not originate
[1:01:25] on earth. Amen. Sin did not originate on
[1:01:28] earth. Amen. It originated in heaven.
[1:01:32] And then it was cast out of heaven.
[1:01:34] Amen. and to earth and it fell on the
[1:01:36] human beings. Amen. And then the battle
[1:01:39] was from angels. Amen. It was first from
[1:01:42] angels in heaven and and when Satan was
[1:01:44] cast out. Amen. He went to earth and and
[1:01:48] fell on humans. And now the now uh the
[1:01:50] battle become a human battle. Amen. The
[1:01:53] battle become become between humans.
[1:01:55] Amen. And Satan come to destroy God's
[1:01:58] creation. And God had created to be uh
[1:02:02] that God had created uh Satan come to
[1:02:05] destroy what God had to uh was created
[1:02:07] for himself. Amen. What what God has
[1:02:10] created for himself, Satan is trying to
[1:02:13] destroy. Amen. And that's what his
[1:02:16] purpose was was to destroy it. Then the
[1:02:18] battle began here on earth and it began
[1:02:20] in us. And it has been ra uh raging ever
[1:02:23] since. Amen. since the beginning uh uh
[1:02:27] from Adam and Eve to to us now just
[1:02:30] battle after battle. Amen. Now before
[1:02:33] any battle can be put away their first
[1:02:35] has to choose a place where the battle
[1:02:38] is to be fought.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the first world war, Amen. the
[1:02:42] place was selected in no man's land.
[1:02:44] Amen. They they had a had a place
[1:02:47] selected where where two powers were to
[1:02:49] come meet and see who was the strongest.
[1:02:52] Amen. in World War II, some places were
[1:02:54] chosen there on the beaches of Normandy
[1:02:56] or or or there in Germany and just
[1:02:59] different places to test the two powers.
[1:03:02] Amen. And and and you know, uh with
[1:03:04] Russia and Ukraine where they have to
[1:03:06] choose a battleground. They have to
[1:03:08] choose where they're going to test their
[1:03:10] powers. And one one doesn't just come
[1:03:12] and fight over here while the other
[1:03:14] one's over here. And and one doesn't
[1:03:17] just come running around over here, but
[1:03:18] they have to have a meeting place. Amen.
[1:03:21] There there's a battlefront where they
[1:03:23] meet and test their powers where uh each
[1:03:26] army test its strength against the other
[1:03:28] army. A mutual meeting place. Amen. And
[1:03:31] when this great battle started on earth,
[1:03:33] there had to be a mutual meeting place.
[1:03:38] Amen. There had to be a selected place
[1:03:41] for the battle to begin and for the
[1:03:43] battle to rage. Amen. And I want you to
[1:03:46] catch this now. And that battle ground
[1:03:49] this morning is the human mind. Amen.
[1:03:52] The battle this morning that that God
[1:03:55] and and uh uh the and Satan chose a
[1:03:59] battleground and that's in our minds
[1:04:01] this morning. Amen. It's began in the
[1:04:03] human mind and there's where the battle
[1:04:05] starts. The human mind was chosen for
[1:04:07] the place of the battle and that is
[1:04:09] because the decisions are made from the
[1:04:12] mind, the head. Amen. Uh if I if I could
[1:04:15] just really make this clear to you this
[1:04:17] morning, Brother Brandham says, "Now
[1:04:20] they they never started it from some
[1:04:22] organization. They never started it from
[1:04:24] some mechanical affair. The grounds
[1:04:26] never started there. Therefore, the or
[1:04:29] organization can can never can never do
[1:04:31] the work of God because the
[1:04:33] battlegrounds where you've got to meet
[1:04:35] your enemy is in the mind. You've got to
[1:04:37] make a choice. It meets you. Decisions
[1:04:40] are made in the mind. in the head. There
[1:04:42] is where Satan meets you and the
[1:04:43] decisions are made because God made a
[1:04:46] man that way. Amen. And he goes on to
[1:04:48] say, "The human being is made up just
[1:04:50] like a grain of wheat. It's a seed. And
[1:04:53] the human being is a seed physically.
[1:04:55] You're the seed of your father and your
[1:04:57] mother." Amen. The life come from the
[1:04:59] father and the pulp come from the
[1:05:00] mother. So the two together, the egg and
[1:05:03] the blood comes together and in the
[1:05:05] bloodshell is life. And in there it
[1:05:08] begins to develop making the child.
[1:05:10] Amen. And now that any seed has a shell
[1:05:13] on the outside, inside the pulp, inside
[1:05:15] of the pulp is the germ of life. Well,
[1:05:18] that's the way we're made. We're a body,
[1:05:20] soul, and spirit. The outside, the body,
[1:05:23] the shell, the inside of that, the
[1:05:26] conscience, and so forth is the soul.
[1:05:28] Inside the soul is a spirit. Amen. And
[1:05:33] and the spirit governs all the other.
[1:05:36] Amen. Now, we know that the outside body
[1:05:38] has five senses. is contacted by see,
[1:05:41] taste, feel, smell, and hear. Amen. And
[1:05:44] that's the five senses that control the
[1:05:46] body. Amen. Inside the body is a soul.
[1:05:50] And that soul is controlled by
[1:05:52] imaginations, conscience, memory,
[1:05:54] reasons, and affections. And that's the
[1:05:56] thing that controls the doubt or the the
[1:05:59] that controls the soul. But the spirit
[1:06:02] only has one sense. And that sense that
[1:06:05] dominates it is faith or doubt. Amen. So
[1:06:08] you can either let faith control your
[1:06:10] spirit or you can let doubt control your
[1:06:12] spirit. Amen. And there's only one
[1:06:14] avenue to it. That's free moral agency.
[1:06:17] You can accept doubt or you can accept
[1:06:20] faith. It's up to you. Either one you
[1:06:21] want to work on. Amen. Therefore, Satan
[1:06:24] began at the principal part to cause the
[1:06:27] spirit of man to doubt God's word. Amen.
[1:06:30] And God began at the principal part to
[1:06:33] lay his word in that spirit. Amen.
[1:06:37] That's what that's what he does. Amen.
[1:06:40] Brother Brandham says now remember it's
[1:06:42] not Christian science now. Mind over
[1:06:44] matter that hasn't the mind accepts the
[1:06:47] life which is the word of God and there
[1:06:50] brings the life. Just your thoughts
[1:06:52] doesn't do it. But the word of God
[1:06:54] brought in the channel of your thought.
[1:06:56] See it's not the thought as Christian
[1:06:58] science make it. Mind over matter. No,
[1:07:00] that isn't it. But your mind accepts it.
[1:07:03] It grasp it. What's it what what is your
[1:07:06] mind controlled by? Your spirit. And
[1:07:08] your spirit catches the word of God. And
[1:07:11] that's the thing that's got life in it.
[1:07:13] And it brings life unto you. Amen. Into
[1:07:16] you. Oh, brother. What? When that takes
[1:07:19] place, when the life comes down, that
[1:07:21] channel into you, the word of God is
[1:07:23] manifested in you. If ye abide in me and
[1:07:26] my words abide in you, then ask what you
[1:07:29] will and it shall be done. Amen. And
[1:07:31] then what does that do? From the middle
[1:07:33] of the heart, which is the soul, from
[1:07:36] there goes forth feeding every channel.
[1:07:39] Amen. The trouble of it is we're
[1:07:41] standing here with a lot of doubt,
[1:07:43] trying to accept what's out there. But
[1:07:45] you've got to stop that. You've got to
[1:07:48] you got to come down to that channel
[1:07:49] with the true word of God. And then that
[1:07:52] goes out itself automatically. It's
[1:07:54] what's on the inside. That's the thing
[1:07:57] that counts is the inside. Satan
[1:08:00] approach is from the inside. Amen. Now
[1:08:03] you say, "Well, I don't steal." Amen.
[1:08:05] Well, I don't smoke. I I don't I don't I
[1:08:08] don't commit adultery. I don't do these
[1:08:10] things. I I don't do nothing like that.
[1:08:12] See, it's the inside. No matter how good
[1:08:14] you are, it doesn't matter how matter
[1:08:16] how good you are. You may never have
[1:08:17] smoked. You may never have never tasted
[1:08:19] a a drink. You may never have done any
[1:08:21] of that. Amen. It doesn't matter how
[1:08:23] moral you are, how truthful you are.
[1:08:26] Amen. Uh those things are are respected.
[1:08:28] Those things are are honorable. Amen.
[1:08:31] Not being able to do them things. But
[1:08:32] Jesus said, "Except a man be born
[1:08:35] again." Amen. There's got to something
[1:08:37] that's got to happen on the inside.
[1:08:39] Amen. Something has still got to happen.
[1:08:41] You're still a sinner. Amen. Something
[1:08:43] has got to take place on the inside.
[1:08:46] Amen. If you And if you don't, that
[1:08:48] artificial is a put on. You don't uh for
[1:08:50] down in your heart you desire to do it
[1:08:53] anyhow. Amen. It can't be artificial.
[1:08:55] It's got to be real. Amen. You may have
[1:08:58] never smoked. You may have never drank.
[1:08:59] You may have never uh cheated on your
[1:09:02] spouse or anything like that. Amen. You
[1:09:04] must must have never told a lie. And you
[1:09:06] must you could have just lived true. And
[1:09:08] you could have just uh just been a
[1:09:10] really good human being and given to the
[1:09:12] poor and and feeding the hungry. Amen.
[1:09:15] But it's still in your heart to do those
[1:09:17] things. Amen. So, first there still has
[1:09:19] to come a nature change. Amen. If you've
[1:09:23] never done it, if you've never had a
[1:09:24] nature change, Amen. you you're you're
[1:09:27] no different than the man that has
[1:09:28] committed those actions. Amen. There has
[1:09:30] to come a a change on the inside. Amen.
[1:09:34] And there's only one avenue that can
[1:09:35] come down and that's by the way a free
[1:09:37] moral agency. Amen. Come into the soul
[1:09:40] by your thoughts. As a man thinkketh in
[1:09:41] his heart, so is he. Amen. The Bible
[1:09:44] says if you say to this mountain, move
[1:09:46] and don't doubt in your heart, but
[1:09:49] believe what you have said will come to
[1:09:51] pass, you can have what you said. Amen.
[1:09:54] That's the battlegrounds. Amen. I hope
[1:09:57] you're getting it this morning. Amen.
[1:10:00] When you accepted Christ the word into
[1:10:02] your life.
[1:10:05] Amen. You didn't come just because your
[1:10:07] your mother was a good person. Amen.
[1:10:09] When you accepted God into your life,
[1:10:12] you didn't come because you was a good
[1:10:14] neighbor or you did enough uh enough
[1:10:17] enough deeds to accept God's God's uh
[1:10:20] approval or anything like that. that you
[1:10:22] didn't come because you live by the
[1:10:24] golden rules. Amen. But you came because
[1:10:27] that God had called you to come. Amen.
[1:10:30] You accepted him on the basis of his
[1:10:32] word. Amen. And that's what it mean. And
[1:10:35] that word means everything this morning.
[1:10:38] Amen. You didn't come because you just
[1:10:40] wanted to come, but you came because
[1:10:42] something in your heart was tugging at
[1:10:44] you to come. Amen. Amen. Do you believe
[1:10:47] that this morning? Amen. And if we can
[1:10:49] get everything out of the way, if we if
[1:10:51] we can get our conscience out of the
[1:10:53] way, all of our senses, and just let the
[1:10:55] word come in, the word will produce just
[1:10:59] exactly. Amen. Satan is going to do
[1:11:02] everything he can to get us to doubt.
[1:11:04] Amen. That's that's the battle this
[1:11:06] morning. He is going to do everything he
[1:11:08] can to get you to doubt God's word.
[1:11:10] Amen. He's going to do everything he can
[1:11:13] to block that channel. He's going to
[1:11:15] block that channel that God can't get
[1:11:17] through. Amen. You may say, "Well, these
[1:11:19] these conscience and and these senses
[1:11:21] and so forth don't have anything to do
[1:11:23] with it." Amen. But if you let the word
[1:11:25] come in and cover it uh cover it over
[1:11:29] with conscience and and you cover it
[1:11:31] with w with w with with your your senses
[1:11:34] and and you let it cover with your uh
[1:11:36] reasoning or anything, amen, it can't
[1:11:39] grow. Amen. It can't come forth. Amen.
[1:11:42] If you let the word come in and and you
[1:11:44] cover it with all these things, then it
[1:11:46] then it will just be deformed. Amen. You
[1:11:48] you ever uh Brother Bram says you ever
[1:11:51] take a seat of corn or or anything and
[1:11:54] you take some kind of a a plant or
[1:11:56] anything and you plant it in the ground
[1:11:58] and you lay a stick or or a rock or
[1:12:00] something over it. And when that seed
[1:12:02] begins to produce, Amen. it begins to
[1:12:04] grow crooked because there's something
[1:12:06] that's keeping it from growing straight.
[1:12:08] Amen. It begins to grow crooked. Amen.
[1:12:11] And that's the same thing when when when
[1:12:13] you when you try to accept God's word
[1:12:16] and and you're still holding on to these
[1:12:17] things and you're still holding on to
[1:12:19] conscience and and you're still letting
[1:12:21] these things get in the way. You're
[1:12:22] still letting reasoning get in the way.
[1:12:24] You're still letting doubt get in the
[1:12:25] way. The Lord, it's only just going to
[1:12:27] grow crooked. It can't grow the way it's
[1:12:30] supposed to grow. Amen. And that's the
[1:12:32] matter with the our faith. Sometimes
[1:12:34] we've let too many things hinder our
[1:12:36] faith. Oh my. Satan will try to keep you
[1:12:39] away from a real testimony. that's
[1:12:41] genuine. So, he will point you at
[1:12:43] something. He will point you at
[1:12:45] somebody's failure. He'll point you at a
[1:12:48] hypocrite. He'll point you to whatever
[1:12:50] to hinder your faith in God's word.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. I remember when I was um seeking
[1:12:57] the Holy Ghost and and I was just
[1:12:59] getting real desperate and and Satan was
[1:13:02] just bombarding my mind. My goodness, he
[1:13:05] was just bombarding my mind and and
[1:13:07] just, hey, you'll never get it. and and
[1:13:09] and you know and I've tried to lean on
[1:13:12] our pastor for advice and listen to the
[1:13:15] messages where brother Brandham says and
[1:13:17] and I just begin to try to push those
[1:13:19] things out. Then the next thing you
[1:13:20] know, he's trying to point me out so and
[1:13:23] so and point me at so and so and and it
[1:13:25] got to the point I I was I was talking
[1:13:28] to dad and and you know about the Holy
[1:13:31] Ghost and things and and and I just
[1:13:33] straight up told him I said, "Well,
[1:13:35] Satan keeps pointing me at this person
[1:13:37] and pointing me at that person." And I
[1:13:39] looked at him in the eyes and I said,
[1:13:40] "If that's what the Holy Ghost produces,
[1:13:42] I don't want it. I don't want the Holy
[1:13:44] Ghost if that's what that Holy Ghost
[1:13:46] produces." And he had to tell me, he
[1:13:48] says, "Don't you give up, son." He says,
[1:13:50] "There is a real, there is a genuine
[1:13:52] feeling of the Holy Ghost. Don't look to
[1:13:55] those things." Amen. Look to the
[1:13:57] genuine. Amen. Satan will do everything
[1:14:00] he can to hinder your faith. Amen. But
[1:14:03] he'll uh God will show you the real
[1:14:05] thing. You just got to look to his word.
[1:14:08] Amen. Satan will always try to point you
[1:14:10] in the other direction. Amen. He will
[1:14:13] get you to look at your feelings every
[1:14:15] morning. Oh my. How many of you, you
[1:14:17] know, I'm only 25 years old and I I
[1:14:21] don't mean to be complaining, but but
[1:14:23] I've had some major major lower back
[1:14:25] pain and and it's just it's been it's
[1:14:28] been bothering me so bad. And uh I'll be
[1:14:31] at work or anything and and just just
[1:14:34] can't sit up straight. I'll be sitting
[1:14:35] for a while and go to get up and I and
[1:14:37] I'm hunched over like this and just got
[1:14:39] to slowly walk. I mean, I'm only 25 and
[1:14:43] and it's uh it's it can be rough. I just
[1:14:46] I don't understand. But but Satan will
[1:14:48] point you at your at your how you're
[1:14:50] feeling every morning. Amen. You can
[1:14:52] wake up and look in the mirror and and
[1:14:54] just say, "Oh my Satan will say, "Well,
[1:14:57] see, the the symptoms are still there.
[1:14:59] See, the back pain is still there. See,
[1:15:02] you you never got your healing." And and
[1:15:04] he'll get you to look at your mental
[1:15:06] health. He will get you to just to go
[1:15:08] wherever the wind blows and and be then
[1:15:11] then you just become again a wondering
[1:15:13] star. And when you and when you get
[1:15:15] focused on your own way of thinking
[1:15:17] instead of God's word, Amen. But if you
[1:15:20] can just push all that aside this
[1:15:22] morning, if you can just push all the
[1:15:24] doubt away, if you can just push how
[1:15:26] you're feeling this morning away, amen,
[1:15:28] and look to God's word, the true source
[1:15:31] of the word of God, that it's got to
[1:15:33] stay there. He says, "Amen. Amen. Let it
[1:15:36] come from the true source of the word of
[1:15:38] God. Amen. And the word has got to stay
[1:15:41] in its place.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Heaven and earth will pass away,
[1:15:44] but my word cannot pass away. It must be
[1:15:48] accepted in the mind. Then it's believed
[1:15:50] with the heart. Then the word of God
[1:15:53] becomes a reality. Oh my. Amen. Then
[1:15:57] every sense of soul and body is just uh
[1:16:00] scored out with the Holy Spirit. Then
[1:16:02] your sense of God, your conscience of
[1:16:04] God, everything that that's godly flows
[1:16:07] through you. Amen. That there's not a
[1:16:09] doubt anywhere. There's nothing that can
[1:16:11] rise up. Amen. There's nothing that can
[1:16:13] rise up in memory and say, "Well,
[1:16:15] remember when so and so tried to trust
[1:16:17] in God for healing one time and she
[1:16:19] failed?" Oh my. Brother Brandham says,
[1:16:21] "But if that channel has been cleared
[1:16:24] out and it's been purged and and been
[1:16:26] filled on the inside with the Holy
[1:16:28] Ghost, Amen. that don't even come in
[1:16:30] memory. memory don't even come in. No
[1:16:32] matter about what so so and so did.
[1:16:35] Amen. It's it's you and God together and
[1:16:38] nobody else but you two. There are there
[1:16:41] you are. There's your battle. Kill him
[1:16:44] at the beginning. Stop him dead in his
[1:16:46] tracks. It ain't how long you can keep
[1:16:48] the war lingering. Stop it right now.
[1:16:51] Amen. So so and so may say, "Well, you
[1:16:55] know, I tried trusting in God. I tried
[1:16:57] believing for my healing, but look how
[1:16:59] my circumstance. Look where I'm at now.
[1:17:02] And when you're trying to receive your
[1:17:03] healing, when you're trying to receive
[1:17:05] your deliverance, Satan will point you
[1:17:07] and say, "Look at so and so. Look at
[1:17:09] what she's doing. Look what he's doing.
[1:17:11] He's not getting his healing. He's not
[1:17:13] getting his deliverance." And then if
[1:17:15] you aren't careful, you'll let those
[1:17:17] thoughts come into your mind and come
[1:17:19] down into your spirit. And the next
[1:17:21] thing you know, you'll say, "Well, God,
[1:17:23] I just don't know. God, I'm just going
[1:17:24] to give up. God, I just, you know, my
[1:17:26] pain is still here and the darkness is
[1:17:29] still here and I just don't know
[1:17:31] anymore. But brother Brandham says, if
[1:17:33] you'll come and you'll keep them
[1:17:35] memories and conscience and everything
[1:17:36] thinking about, well, I might fail. It
[1:17:39] might not be right. Don't you do that at
[1:17:41] all. You throw that aside everything.
[1:17:44] Open up the channel and say, God, your
[1:17:46] word is eternally true and it's for me
[1:17:48] and I believe it. If the whole church
[1:17:50] fails, if the whole world fails, Amen.
[1:17:54] Yeah. I can't fail because I'm taking
[1:17:57] your word. There's the battle.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Take God at his word this morning.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Take God at his word and believe.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe you're maybe our channels
[1:18:11] are full this morning. Maybe our
[1:18:13] channels are clogged this morning. Let's
[1:18:16] empty our channels. Let's take God at
[1:18:18] his word this morning and believe him.
[1:18:20] Amen. Brother Brandham says, "A little
[1:18:22] girl come here not long ago from high
[1:18:24] school. Her mother called me up and
[1:18:25] said, "Brother Brandham, my girl has got
[1:18:27] hot hotkins disease. That's cancer
[1:18:30] forming lumps. And the doctor took a
[1:18:31] piece from a break on her throat, sent
[1:18:34] it away, and it was perfectly Hotchkins
[1:18:36] disease."
[1:18:38] So he said, "The next one breaks, it may
[1:18:40] break over her heart, and when it does,
[1:18:43] she's gone. The way they're breaking,
[1:18:44] she's just gone anywhere. She's got
[1:18:46] anywhere about 3 months to live." And
[1:18:49] and the mother was so worried. We all
[1:18:51] know the story. She was so worried. She
[1:18:53] she didn't know what to do. So she asked
[1:18:55] Brother Brownham. She says, "What should
[1:18:56] I do?" He says, "Well, don't tell her.
[1:18:58] Don't just just keep going on. Just keep
[1:19:00] moving." He says, "Well, I'm so scared.
[1:19:02] I don't know." He says, "Well, come to a
[1:19:03] prayer line. Come to come to the prayer
[1:19:05] line." And when they came through, he
[1:19:07] looked down at her mother. And he looked
[1:19:09] down at them both. And he knew something
[1:19:11] wasn't right. Amen. And and he looked at
[1:19:15] them both and he said, "Uh, both of them
[1:19:17] without God, without Christ." And he
[1:19:19] says, "How can you expect healings on
[1:19:21] these grounds? Will you accept Jesus
[1:19:24] Christ as your personal savior? Will you
[1:19:26] will you come to this pool here and be
[1:19:28] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:19:30] Christ for the remission of your sins?"
[1:19:32] And they said, "We will do that." And
[1:19:34] then the little girl was took back to
[1:19:36] the doctor for more tests. And not even
[1:19:39] one trace of Hoskins disease was found
[1:19:42] in her. Why? What was the matter? You
[1:19:45] had to open the channel first. Amen.
[1:19:48] You've got to get the real soldier, the
[1:19:50] Holy Spirit, placed at the battlefront
[1:19:52] that takes God at his word. Amen. For he
[1:19:55] is the word. Amen.
[1:19:59] There's nothing going to stop it then.
[1:20:01] Amen. Every other channel is cleared
[1:20:03] out. Brother Brandham says, just like an
[1:20:05] old boiler with the flu stopped up, you
[1:20:07] put a fire in it, it blows it'll blow
[1:20:10] your thing up. That's that's what's the
[1:20:12] matter with so many blowed up Christians
[1:20:13] is because they don't clean the channels
[1:20:15] out. They don't know how to go uh they
[1:20:18] they they don't go down on the inside.
[1:20:22] They've got to clean it. Conscience,
[1:20:24] memories, uh thoughts, laying aside
[1:20:26] everything and coming from the inside
[1:20:28] out with the unadulterated word of God
[1:20:32] until that becomes the truth. Amen.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; That's that's the truth.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the devil will try to come
[1:20:40] back. Amen. He He will always do that.
[1:20:44] Satan will always come back and try to
[1:20:46] plague your mind. Amen. If he can get in
[1:20:48] there at all. Amen. If he can just get
[1:20:50] if he can just squeeze just a little bit
[1:20:53] in your mind. A and he's got your the
[1:20:56] army around then. Amen. Uh 2 Corinthians
[1:20:59] 10 verse three says, "For though we walk
[1:21:02] in the flesh, we do not war after the
[1:21:05] flesh. For the weapons of our of our
[1:21:07] warfare are not carnal, but mighty
[1:21:10] through God to the pulling down of
[1:21:12] strongholds, casting down imaginations
[1:21:16] and everything that exalted itself
[1:21:18] against the knowledge of God, and
[1:21:20] bringing into captivity every thought to
[1:21:23] the obedience of Christ. Amen. And if
[1:21:27] you got your sense and your if you got
[1:21:30] your senses and your and your taste, you
[1:21:32] got your your your your feeling and your
[1:21:34] smell and your sight. Amen. They're all
[1:21:37] right. Amen. It's all right to have
[1:21:39] those things and and to trust those
[1:21:41] things as long as they line up with the
[1:21:43] word of God. But if they don't line up
[1:21:45] with the word of God, then don't lean on
[1:21:47] your senses this morning. Amen. And our
[1:21:50] imaginations and your conscience and
[1:21:52] your memories and your reasons and
[1:21:53] affections, they're all right. If they
[1:21:56] agree with the word of God, but if your
[1:21:58] affections don't agree with the word of
[1:22:00] God, get rid of it. Amen. If your
[1:22:03] reasons disagree with the word of God,
[1:22:05] then kick it out of your life. Amen. Get
[1:22:08] away from it. If your memories or your
[1:22:10] imaginations or your conscience,
[1:22:12] anything disagree with the word of God
[1:22:15] disagrees with what's on the inside,
[1:22:17] Amen. and then get away from it.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brham says, "When God can
[1:22:21] get a man in his hands, till he can get
[1:22:24] his sense, his conscience, everything
[1:22:26] cleaned out until it stands with God
[1:22:28] behind it in the spirit. There's not a
[1:22:30] devil in the world can poke a doubt in
[1:22:33] there." Amen. That's right. The devil
[1:22:35] will come around and say, "Well, well,
[1:22:37] you don't feel any better. Well, you
[1:22:38] just don't look no different. And and
[1:22:41] see, the tumor is still there, and see
[1:22:43] the back pain is still there. See, the
[1:22:45] cancer is still there and your cold is
[1:22:48] still there. But if you got your mind
[1:22:50] open for God's word to come through
[1:22:52] those channels, Amen. Your conscience is
[1:22:55] gone. Everything is gone from the uh
[1:22:57] from you. Amen. Amen. Everything the
[1:23:00] devil says is gone.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham says, "Then the
[1:23:04] flu is so clear it shouts hallelujah."
[1:23:07] It shines out just as clean and just as
[1:23:09] clear for the word of God to come and
[1:23:12] work through. Amen. the power of God.
[1:23:15] That's your battleground this morning.
[1:23:17] Amen. Brother Benham says
[1:23:20] your battleground is back here at the
[1:23:22] beginning. Back here in the soul, back
[1:23:24] in your mind that opens. The mind is the
[1:23:27] gate to the soul. The gate is the gate
[1:23:29] to the spirit rather. Your mind opens up
[1:23:32] and accepts the spirit or it rejects the
[1:23:35] spirit. Amen. You can have little
[1:23:37] conscience and little feelings and
[1:23:38] little sensations and all these things
[1:23:41] that has nothing to do with it. That's
[1:23:44] just little sensations of things. But
[1:23:46] when it comes to reality, your mind
[1:23:48] opens it up. Your mind either accepts it
[1:23:51] or it rejects it. Amen. See, it's your
[1:23:54] mind that opens the up the door or it
[1:23:57] closes the door. And you listen to your
[1:23:59] conscience, listen to your memory,
[1:24:01] listen to your to your affections. But
[1:24:03] when your mind closes itself to these
[1:24:05] things and let God, the spirit of his
[1:24:08] word come in, it blows the rest of that
[1:24:11] stuff out. Amen. Then every doubt is
[1:24:13] gone. Every fear is gone. Every
[1:24:16] sensation of doubt is gone. Every
[1:24:19] feeling is gone. There's nothing
[1:24:21] standing but there but the word of God.
[1:24:24] And Satan can't battle against that.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; No sir. He can't battle against it.
[1:24:30] Amen.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll get to my text here in a
[1:24:34] minute. Amen. These battles has raged
[1:24:38] since the day of the Garden of Eden.
[1:24:40] Amen. in the battle in the human mind.
[1:24:42] Amen. Satan started it. Amen. What did
[1:24:45] he do when he met Eve? Amen. What did he
[1:24:48] What did Satan do when he met Eve? He
[1:24:50] didn't deny God's word. He didn't just
[1:24:53] straight up just say, "Well, you know,
[1:24:55] he he's just he's wrong." And he didn't
[1:24:58] do that at all. Amen. But he whitewashed
[1:25:00] it. Amen. He stopped up there. He
[1:25:02] stopped up some little channels here
[1:25:04] somewhere. Amen. And after Eve already
[1:25:07] heard the word, Satan said, "Surely,
[1:25:10] surely God, all these things that he had
[1:25:12] promised." See, he know the word was
[1:25:14] right. Amen. Satan know the word was
[1:25:17] right. But he know he couldn't just come
[1:25:19] right out and blast it, but he
[1:25:20] sugarcoated it. But Eve opened up her
[1:25:23] mind to listen to her reasoning. And
[1:25:26] that's the channel that runs down her
[1:25:28] reasoning in her soul. She reasoned. Her
[1:25:30] eyes her her eyes was sight. She saw the
[1:25:34] serpent. She saw how beautiful he was,
[1:25:36] how handsome he was. Uh she he looked
[1:25:39] far better than her own husband.
[1:25:42] He was the most supple of all the beasts
[1:25:44] of the field. And he was probably fairer
[1:25:46] than her husband. He looked like a a
[1:25:49] great masculine beast standing there and
[1:25:51] how great he was. And he was trying to
[1:25:53] tell her what great thing uh it was. And
[1:25:57] the first thing she did, she opened up
[1:25:59] her mind. Why? And when she did, human
[1:26:03] reasonings caught it. Why wouldn't that
[1:26:05] be a thrill? She says, "Why? Why? What
[1:26:08] you're saying, my goodness, I know what
[1:26:11] God says, but what you're saying, man,
[1:26:13] what a thrill it it would be." What does
[1:26:15] he do? He works in that reasoning power,
[1:26:18] the conscience or something begins to
[1:26:20] move through. Amen.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham says, "But if we give
[1:26:24] God's word the first place,
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; if we give God's word the first place,
[1:26:31] we can't sin. A man cannot sin until he
[1:26:35] first casts aside God's word, he can't
[1:26:38] even sin." That's disbelief. Until he
[1:26:41] first get rid of the word of God, the
[1:26:44] presence of God, he cannot sin. Amen.
[1:26:46] Eve could not sin until she laid aside
[1:26:48] God's word. Amen. and opening up her
[1:26:51] channels of reasoning through her soul.
[1:26:53] And she began to reason why certainly my
[1:26:56] husband has never told me these things.
[1:26:57] But but but I believe that you Amen. I
[1:27:01] believe you. Amen. He told me I I
[1:27:03] shouldn't do this, but you know, you
[1:27:05] make it sound so real and so plain. I
[1:27:07] believe it would be wonderful because
[1:27:09] you're making it sound so plain to me.
[1:27:11] Amen. See, that's what this that's what
[1:27:12] the devil does. He'll He'll try to tell
[1:27:15] you things. He'll try to sneak in there.
[1:27:17] He'll try to whisper to you, "Oh, it
[1:27:19] sounds good. Oh, it may look good, but
[1:27:21] you got to stay with the word." Amen.
[1:27:24] See, there was the first battle. And
[1:27:26] through that battle, he caused every
[1:27:27] other war. He caused every other war.
[1:27:30] And every other bloodshed that ever come
[1:27:32] was called was caused right there at
[1:27:34] Eden. She disbelieved God's word. Amen.
[1:27:38] See, God equipped Eve with the word. God
[1:27:41] told her, "Do not eat of this tree."
[1:27:44] Amen. So he told her, he already gave
[1:27:46] her his word. But in her mind, she chose
[1:27:49] reasoning over what God gave her. Amen.
[1:27:52] She chose reasoning. She got from behind
[1:27:54] the word. She got out from from the
[1:27:57] protection of the word and opened
[1:27:59] herself to the devil. Oh my. And it's
[1:28:02] the same thing today. Just like the
[1:28:03] natural army, they don't give you a
[1:28:05] water gun to go fight the enemy. They
[1:28:07] won't ever do that. They won't ever say,
[1:28:09] "Well, here here's a little water gun.
[1:28:11] Go have fun. You know, go get them wet."
[1:28:13] You know, they'll never do that. They
[1:28:14] don't just give you a a small caliber of
[1:28:17] a weapon and say, "Well, go defeat this
[1:28:20] entire army with with a little old 22 or
[1:28:22] something." Amen. They they they don't
[1:28:24] do those things. But when they equip
[1:28:26] their soldiers, when they equip their
[1:28:28] men with with whatever they got, they
[1:28:31] give them the best weapons they have to
[1:28:33] offer. They're going to give them the
[1:28:34] best helmet. They're going to give them
[1:28:36] the best suit. They're going to give
[1:28:37] them the best weapons. Amen. because
[1:28:40] they want they're uh they're meant to
[1:28:42] defeat the enemy. Oh my. They'll give
[1:28:44] them the best machine guns. They'll give
[1:28:46] them grenades. They'll give them tanks.
[1:28:48] They'll give them bazookas. Anything
[1:28:51] that will defeat the enemy. And that God
[1:28:53] was the same way.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; God was the same way. He He didn't just
[1:28:58] He didn't just give you a little water
[1:29:00] gun and some little powerless religion
[1:29:02] to go defeat the devil. But when he
[1:29:05] come, he gave you the greatest weapon
[1:29:08] ever known to man. Oh my. And that was
[1:29:11] the atomic bomb. Amen. He gave you his
[1:29:14] word.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; And in order for our weapon to take
[1:29:20] effect, we have to we have to go shut
[1:29:22] off conscience, memories, reasonings,
[1:29:25] and all these other things that's
[1:29:26] contrary to God's word. Amen. We can't
[1:29:29] reason with it. Don't reason with God's
[1:29:31] word.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. just accept the word upon the
[1:29:35] basis that God said so and that settles
[1:29:38] it. I may not understand it. I may not
[1:29:41] know when it's going to happen. I may
[1:29:42] not know what the future holds, but his
[1:29:45] word says I'm going to have my healing.
[1:29:47] His word says I'm going to have my
[1:29:49] deliverance. His word says my children
[1:29:52] are going to be saved and I'm resting on
[1:29:54] that.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; I believe
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; just accept the word on his basis that
[1:30:00] God said so and that settles it. And
[1:30:02] then every channel comes open between
[1:30:05] you and God. Oh my. Brother Brandham
[1:30:08] says, "There's the battle. The very
[1:30:09] first front line. Let's not use a little
[1:30:12] 22 rifle. Let's get an atomic bomb.
[1:30:15] Let's do the job right. Let's get God's
[1:30:17] atomic bomb." What is it, Brother
[1:30:19] Brandham? F ai T. In his word, that's
[1:30:23] God's atomic bomb. It blows sickness and
[1:30:26] devils right and left. It disintegrates
[1:30:29] everything that's ungodly. And when the
[1:30:31] bomb of faith drops in there, when the
[1:30:34] with the word of God behind it, it blows
[1:30:36] every devil, every sickness, every
[1:30:39] disease out of the way
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; and then you stand there in victory. Oh
[1:30:45] my. Oh my. Get God's atomic bomb this
[1:30:48] morning. Blow those devils out of the
[1:30:51] way. Blow doubt away. Blow reasoning
[1:30:54] away. And stand there in victory. Cuz
[1:30:58] victory belongs to you. Oh my
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Satan get you to reason with it. He'll
[1:31:05] get you so focused on your senses. He'll
[1:31:08] get you to he'll try to get you to doubt
[1:31:10] your weapon. He'll try to get you to
[1:31:12] doubt what God gave you. Amen. Brother
[1:31:14] Brandham says, "Then if Satan can get
[1:31:16] through there by his conscience and all
[1:31:19] these other things, when he gets right
[1:31:21] down here to the end of the soul and the
[1:31:23] mind, you'll never look at one of them
[1:31:26] until you first have to let him in
[1:31:28] there. Amen.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; You have to let him in.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Then when he gets in, he's got control.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Then what does he do? He begins to use
[1:31:40] conscience.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; He begins to use this, begin to use that
[1:31:44] outlet. What is it? See, taste, feel,
[1:31:47] smell, hear, imagination, is conscience,
[1:31:48] memory, reasons, affections. He begins
[1:31:51] to use all those different little
[1:31:53] channels. As long as he could get in
[1:31:56] above this one here, he's got he's got
[1:31:58] to come in your mind first. And you have
[1:32:01] to accept it. Oh my goodness. Oh my. In
[1:32:04] order for Satan to come in, you have to
[1:32:07] let him in.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; That's that's that's wild right there.
[1:32:13] In order for Satan to come in into those
[1:32:15] little channels, you have to first let
[1:32:18] him in. And when he gets in, he'll begin
[1:32:20] to use all those little channels. He'll
[1:32:23] begin to use your conscience. He'll
[1:32:24] begin to use your reasoning. He'll begin
[1:32:26] to use your affections. And he'll begin
[1:32:28] to use your your taste and your your
[1:32:30] hearing and your feelings. And he'll use
[1:32:33] everything he can to get you to doubt
[1:32:35] God's word. Oh my. He begins to move in
[1:32:38] those little channels. Amen. He's got
[1:32:40] you first. And you have to accept it. It
[1:32:42] can batter against you. Amen. But it
[1:32:45] can't get to you until you accept it.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, he's bombarded your mind.
[1:32:51] Amen. He'll he'll bombard your mind.
[1:32:54] He'll he'll he'll bombard your mind with
[1:32:56] negativity. He'll bombard your mind with
[1:32:58] thoughts of reasoning reasoning, but he
[1:33:00] can't get into your mind unless you
[1:33:02] first deny God's word and you accept
[1:33:04] what the devil is saying. Amen. Just
[1:33:07] like you you can't keep a bird from
[1:33:08] flying over your head. You can't keep
[1:33:11] all these birds from flying over your
[1:33:12] head, but you can keep the birds from
[1:33:15] nesting in your hair. Amen. You can keep
[1:33:18] the birds from building a nest in your
[1:33:20] hair. So you can't you can't keep the
[1:33:22] thoughts from coming. You can't keep the
[1:33:24] negativity from coming, but you can keep
[1:33:27] them from having a place in your mind.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Oh my. You may say, "Well, the doctor
[1:33:33] says I can't well get well." Well, it
[1:33:35] looks like he knows everything he's
[1:33:36] talking about. Now, we don't condemn the
[1:33:38] doctors. We don't condemn the doctors at
[1:33:40] all. In their in their uh degrees, they
[1:33:43] they're only telling you what they see.
[1:33:45] They're only telling you what they know.
[1:33:47] They only telling you these things.
[1:33:48] Amen. So, we don't condemn the doctor.
[1:33:51] Amen. But you may say, "Well, well,
[1:33:53] well, I'm just not getting healed. Well,
[1:33:56] I just don't know." And you see, the
[1:33:58] doctor must be right then. Amen. But
[1:34:00] don't reason with it. Don't reason what
[1:34:02] the doctor has to say. Amen. That's the
[1:34:05] devil standing there poking you. Amen.
[1:34:07] That's the devil just poking you, trying
[1:34:09] to get in your mind. Amen. And brother
[1:34:11] Benham says when Satan walked up to Eve
[1:34:14] and says, you know, the fruit is still
[1:34:16] uh the fruit is pleasant, she stopped
[1:34:19] for a moment. Oh, that's when she made a
[1:34:22] mistake. That's when she made a mistake.
[1:34:25] When she stopped for a moment, that's
[1:34:28] when Satan walked right into her mind.
[1:34:30] Said, "Well, it sounds reasonable." Uh
[1:34:33] oh, don't do that. Just take what God
[1:34:36] said. Don't stop for nothing. You've got
[1:34:39] the message. Jesus lives. God is a
[1:34:42] healer. That's the message. Don't stop
[1:34:45] for nothing. No reasonings, nothing
[1:34:48] else. Just keep pressing on.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And as long as you're equipped
[1:34:54] with God's word, then you have
[1:34:56] everything you then you have everything
[1:34:58] you need. As long as you're equipped
[1:35:00] with God's word, then you have nothing
[1:35:02] to fear. Oh yeah, cancer may eat up your
[1:35:04] body, but you still have the promise
[1:35:06] that God is still my healer. Oh, you're
[1:35:09] still your kids may just go further into
[1:35:11] the world, but you can stand there with
[1:35:13] the promise and say, "But my kids are
[1:35:15] going to be there. My kids will make
[1:35:18] it." Stand there with the word of God
[1:35:21] and don't reason with it.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; No one said this world. Amen. Amen. See,
[1:35:28] God God wants to heal your body. God
[1:35:30] wants to heal your body. Amen. God said
[1:35:33] in his word and in third John, I
[1:35:35] believe, above all things, I would that
[1:35:38] you prosper in health. Above all things,
[1:35:41] I would that you prosper in health.
[1:35:43] Amen. So, he wants to heal your body,
[1:35:46] but we have to fight for every inch of
[1:35:48] ground that God has given us. We have to
[1:35:50] fight for every promise, every little
[1:35:52] inch of ground. We've got to keep
[1:35:55] swinging the sword. We got to keep
[1:35:57] pressing the battle. Amen. No one said
[1:35:59] this road would be easy. No one said
[1:36:02] that this road would would bring us
[1:36:03] comfort and peace. Amen. No one said we
[1:36:06] would we wouldn't have any scars, but
[1:36:08] the scars prove that you've been in the
[1:36:11] battle.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; The scars prove that you've been
[1:36:14] fighting and that you keep pressing on.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we didn't have any scars, the
[1:36:19] moment we stop fighting is the moment we
[1:36:21] know that Satan's got us.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; The moment we stop fighting is the
[1:36:26] moment we know that Satan's got us.
[1:36:29] Amen. So, we must keep fighting. We must
[1:36:31] keep pressing the battle. Amen. We must
[1:36:33] keep swinging the sword. Amen. Victory
[1:36:36] is just in sight. Amen. Victory belongs
[1:36:39] to you this morning. Don't stop
[1:36:41] believing. Don't stop accepting his
[1:36:43] word. Keep pressing on. Victory is just
[1:36:46] inside. Victory belongs to you this
[1:36:49] morning. Every promise of God belongs to
[1:36:53] you.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. What we need this morning are
[1:36:56] David. Amen. Who will say who can stand
[1:36:59] and say this morning and say you you
[1:37:02] stand and let that uncircumcised
[1:37:04] Philistine defy the armies of the living
[1:37:07] God? Well, I'll go fight him. Well, I'll
[1:37:10] go. I know that God has chosen me for a
[1:37:12] purpose. Amen. And I'll go fight him.
[1:37:15] That's what we need today. That's what
[1:37:17] we need are Davids that will stand at
[1:37:19] the forefront and say, "I will go fight
[1:37:22] my giants. I will go fight them." Oh my.
[1:37:26] God wants men and women this morning who
[1:37:28] can rise up and say, "I'll take the Lord
[1:37:30] at his word." No matter what may fail,
[1:37:32] wear this or that or the other one did.
[1:37:35] That has nothing to do with it. If you
[1:37:37] want to be a Saul, if you want to be a
[1:37:39] Saul and be afraid to go fight, then you
[1:37:41] can just get back where you belong.
[1:37:43] Amen. But God's army is moving forward
[1:37:45] this morning. If you want to be a Saul
[1:37:48] and go hide in your little tent, then go
[1:37:50] hide in your little tent. But God's
[1:37:52] word, God's army is moving forward this
[1:37:55] morning.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; God wants men and women of valor.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Men and women of faith, men and women
[1:38:05] with power and understanding. That's
[1:38:08] what God wants. Amen. We don't have to
[1:38:10] be smart. We don't have to be educated.
[1:38:13] Amen. We don't We just have to have to
[1:38:16] be uh open up our channels for God to
[1:38:18] work through. Amen. God takes those
[1:38:21] little channels and he makes warriors
[1:38:23] out of us. Oh my, I want to be a warrior
[1:38:27] for him. Oh my. Is that your desire this
[1:38:30] morning, Lord? I want to be a warrior
[1:38:32] for you. Lord, I want to face my giant.
[1:38:35] I I want to face my problems knowing
[1:38:38] Lord that you've gone before me making a
[1:38:40] way. That you've gone before me
[1:38:42] providing a way. Amen. That we've looked
[1:38:45] beyond our giant. We've looked be beyond
[1:38:48] our troubles this morning. And Lord, we
[1:38:51] see a victory.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; We read there in our opening scripture,
[1:38:59] take the whole armor of God. Amen. You
[1:39:02] can't just take some of it. You can't
[1:39:05] just take some of it and leave the rest
[1:39:06] behind.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you have to take the whole
[1:39:09] army of God. Armor of God. Amen. In the
[1:39:12] natural army, we we can take the gun. We
[1:39:15] can't just take the gun and leave the
[1:39:16] ammo. Amen. You need the two to work
[1:39:19] together. Amen. You can't just take the
[1:39:22] gun and leave the ammo and decide that
[1:39:23] you're going to go fight. Amen. It
[1:39:25] doesn't work. Amen. And you can't take
[1:39:28] You can't cut your gear in half. You
[1:39:30] can't take your helmet and cut it in
[1:39:31] half and put one side on and leave the
[1:39:33] other side off. You You've got You need
[1:39:36] every part of your armor. You need
[1:39:39] everything that God has given you. Amen.
[1:39:42] It will do you no good if if you only
[1:39:44] take half of your stuff and leave the
[1:39:46] other half. But you have to be fully
[1:39:48] equipped. Amen. And that's the same
[1:39:50] thing with God's army today. We can't
[1:39:52] just take part of God's word and leave
[1:39:53] the rest. Amen. We can't pick and choose
[1:39:56] on what we want to believe and and pick
[1:39:58] and choose on what the prophet has to
[1:40:00] say. Amen. It won't work. Amen. But what
[1:40:03] in order to stand against the darts of
[1:40:05] the devil, it says to take the whole
[1:40:07] armor of God.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to accept 100% of God's
[1:40:13] word. You can't accept 99.99.99%
[1:40:17] and expect it to work. You have to take
[1:40:20] 100% of what God said and defeat the
[1:40:23] devil with it.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It's time to quit playing
[1:40:28] church this morning. It's time to quit
[1:40:31] playing church. Amen. It's time that we
[1:40:33] quit fussing and fighting with each
[1:40:35] other. It's time we quit we quit uh
[1:40:38] fuzzing and fighting with the pastor.
[1:40:40] Quit fuzzing and fighting with the
[1:40:41] deacons. Quit fussing and fighting with
[1:40:43] each other and press the battle. We're
[1:40:46] all in a battle together.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Oh my. It's later than we think. The
[1:40:51] time is at hand.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Believe every word of God that
[1:40:56] you may be able to stand against the ws
[1:40:58] of the devil. Amen. Believe every word
[1:41:01] of God this morning. Amen. You say,
[1:41:03] "Well, I don't know how it's going to
[1:41:04] happen, but I believe it." Amen. I don't
[1:41:08] know how my children are going to make
[1:41:09] it, but I believe it. Amen. I don't know
[1:41:12] how I'm going to get healed, but I
[1:41:14] believe it. I don't understand
[1:41:16] everything, but I believe it. Don't
[1:41:18] reason your faith away. Don't reason
[1:41:21] your weapon away. Don't doubt your
[1:41:24] weapon away.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; That's what's the matter with preachers
[1:41:28] today. They want to explain the promises
[1:41:31] away. They want to explain this away.
[1:41:33] They want to explain that away. Quit
[1:41:35] explaining the promises away.
[1:41:38] Believe it. Amen. They're trying to
[1:41:41] educate the promises away. But let me
[1:41:43] tell you something this morning. Every
[1:41:45] promise of God belongs to his children.
[1:41:48] And do you believe you're his children
[1:41:49] this morning? Then every promise of God
[1:41:52] belongs to you. Amen. If you're a child
[1:41:55] of God this morning, then he said, "Ask
[1:41:57] anything in my name and I will give it
[1:42:00] to you. See if I won't do something for
[1:42:03] you. See if I won't come through for
[1:42:05] you. Ask for me and I'll make a way.
[1:42:08] I'll provide a way for you.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter if you're the weakest
[1:42:14] Christian this morning. It doesn't
[1:42:16] matter how weak you are. If you are a
[1:42:18] child of God, then you hold every
[1:42:21] powerless
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; that was in Christ.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:29] Amen. If you are a believer this
[1:42:31] morning, then you hold every power that
[1:42:34] was in Christ Jesus.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:38] Amen. Brother Brandham tells the story.
[1:42:42] Amen.
[1:42:44] When Christ died there on the cross.
[1:42:47] Amen. Christ the great warrior.
[1:42:52] When Christ died there on the cross, he
[1:42:54] was laid in the tomb. Amen. All hell was
[1:42:57] rejoicing.
[1:42:59] All hell was having a party.
[1:43:02] All of hell was having fun rejoicing
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; cuz they thought they had finally won.
[1:43:09] They thought they had finally won.
[1:43:13] And they were down in hell maybe
[1:43:14] throwing a party. Maybe they just had
[1:43:16] their rock and roll just blaring and
[1:43:17] just dancing, just having a good old
[1:43:19] time. Amen. And maybe Satan was there.
[1:43:23] I'm going to try to demonstrate a little
[1:43:25] bit. Maybe Satan was sitting there in
[1:43:27] his big old chair and just a little grin
[1:43:30] on his face. Then little keys of death
[1:43:34] held in the grave hanging on his side.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; Maybe he'd clip them off, twirl them,
[1:43:39] lick at them,
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; put them back on his side.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Maybe he was just sitting there just
[1:43:44] just having a good old time.
[1:43:48] And then all of a sudden, all of a
[1:43:50] sudden, there came a little knock on the
[1:43:53] door.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; And Satan says, "Well, well, who is it?
[1:43:57] Can can you not see that we're just
[1:43:58] we're having a good old time down here?
[1:44:01] Why are you late to the party?"
[1:44:04] He says, voice on the other side of the
[1:44:06] door says, "Well, just come open it."
[1:44:09] So, Satan gets out of his big chair and
[1:44:11] he walks over there and he opens the
[1:44:13] door and he goes, "Well, who are you?"
[1:44:16] He goes, "Well, I'm Jesus Christ." He
[1:44:18] goes, "Oh, so you finally made it."
[1:44:22] And and he goes, "I thought I had you
[1:44:25] when I threw Daniel in the lion's den.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; I thought I had you when I threw the
[1:44:30] three Hebrew children in the furnace.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; I thought I had you when I beheaded
[1:44:35] John. I thought I had you then. I
[1:44:39] thought I had you at Calvary. But here
[1:44:41] you are now." Brother, brother Brandham
[1:44:44] says, "I can hear Jesus Christ say, I am
[1:44:47] the virgin born of son of God. I came
[1:44:52] from the ivory palaces of my father and
[1:44:54] I came to the earth and on the earth is
[1:44:57] bathed this morning with my blood that I
[1:45:00] gave and paid the price of death set in
[1:45:03] hell." And he looked at Satan and he
[1:45:05] said, "Give me those keys, Satan. I'm
[1:45:07] taken over from here on." Amen. You've
[1:45:10] kept the people in bondage. You've kept
[1:45:12] them in fear and everything else, but
[1:45:14] I've taken over now. Hallelujah. Took
[1:45:17] them off and hung them on his own side.
[1:45:20] Pushed him back into hell where he
[1:45:22] belonged. Amen. And walked away.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The mighty conqueror. Amen.
[1:45:28] Since he rent the veil in two, behold
[1:45:32] him in full view. The mighty conqueror
[1:45:34] rose up and said, "I am he that was dead
[1:45:37] and is alive again. I'm alive forever
[1:45:40] more and I have the keys of death and
[1:45:43] hell. He that heareth my words and
[1:45:45] believeth on him that sent me hath
[1:45:48] everlasting life. I've got the keys of
[1:45:50] the resurrection and I'll raise him up
[1:45:53] in the last day. Oh my. When he ascended
[1:45:56] up to glory and he sent the Holy Spirit
[1:45:59] back which the which is the
[1:46:01] manifestation of Jesus Christ and the
[1:46:04] church.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:46:08] Amen. It's the mighty conqueror. It's
[1:46:11] the mighty conqueror back in his church
[1:46:13] again. The mighty conqueror who had
[1:46:16] never lost a battle. Amen. Amen. And he
[1:46:20] reigns on the throne this morning. Amen.
[1:46:22] Brother says when Christ was here on
[1:46:24] earth. Amen. He never preached a
[1:46:26] funeral. Why? Because because death
[1:46:29] couldn't stay in his presence. And let
[1:46:32] me tell you, when he ascended up to
[1:46:34] glory, he gave you his power. He gave
[1:46:36] you everything that was in him. He gave
[1:46:39] it to you. Now you can stand there in
[1:46:41] victory. Now you can stand there
[1:46:43] possessing every promise. Amen. Now you
[1:46:45] can stand there and watch demons flee
[1:46:48] from you. Now you can stand there and
[1:46:50] say, "I am a mighty conqueror."
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; My
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; blinded eyes can't stay in his presence.
[1:47:01] Sickness can't stay in his presence.
[1:47:03] Death can't stay in his presence. Lost
[1:47:06] souls can't stay in his presence. Amen.
[1:47:09] Whatever you have need of this morning,
[1:47:11] just come under his presence. Oh my. He
[1:47:15] already won the battle for us. We're
[1:47:17] more than conquerors through Christ.
[1:47:20] Amen. Whatever you have need of. Amen.
[1:47:23] Satan don't don't have the keys to his
[1:47:25] own kingdom anymore. Amen. Satan don't
[1:47:28] even have the keys to hell anymore
[1:47:30] because our mighty conqueror conquered
[1:47:33] death, hell, and the grave. Amen. Christ
[1:47:36] stripped him of everything he was. Amen.
[1:47:38] He's nothing but a bluff this morning,
[1:47:40] church. He's nothing. Just nipping at
[1:47:42] your heels. That's all he's doing. Amen.
[1:47:44] He's just coming at you. That's all he's
[1:47:47] doing. Hey my Amen. He's under your feet
[1:47:50] this morning. He's under Just praise him
[1:47:52] this morning. Just rejoice this morning.
[1:47:55] The mighty conqueror had conquered for
[1:47:57] you. Now you can stand there in victory
[1:48:01] because victory belongs to you. Oh my.
[1:48:04] Amen. Victory belongs to you. The
[1:48:07] two-edged sword he placed in your hands.
[1:48:10] He gave you a two-edged sword. Just trap
[1:48:12] your way through the fear. Just chop
[1:48:15] your way through the feelings. Just trap
[1:48:17] your way through circumstances. Chop
[1:48:19] your way through the doubt. Amen. And
[1:48:21] only believe this morning. Only believe.
[1:48:25] Amen. If you try to use your own ideas,
[1:48:27] you're going to fail.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; If you try to use someone else's ideas,
[1:48:32] you will fail. If you try to lean on
[1:48:34] your mom and dad, you will fail. Amen.
[1:48:37] If you try to lean on your own
[1:48:38] education, you will fail. But if you put
[1:48:41] the word first, you will have the
[1:48:44] victory.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. In closing, I want to say this.
[1:48:50] Brother Brandham says, "What is the
[1:48:52] word?"
[1:48:55] What is the word? The Bible said here,
[1:48:56] we just read it. For the spirit of God
[1:48:59] is the word. See, look here. and take
[1:49:02] the helmet of salvation and the sword of
[1:49:04] the spirit. The spirit that comes in
[1:49:06] through your mind and enters into you.
[1:49:08] And the sword of that spirit is the word
[1:49:10] of God. What does that spirit fight
[1:49:13] with? What does that holy spirit fight
[1:49:15] with? Sensations. Feelings? No. The
[1:49:17] word. What does it fight with? Feeling?
[1:49:20] Word. Word. Let's say it. Word.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Word.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; Word.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Word of God is what the spirit fights
[1:49:28] with. The spirit of God walks right up
[1:49:30] to the devil and says, "It is written."
[1:49:34] Amen. It is written. And the devil gives
[1:49:37] away.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Amen. If you have the spirit of
[1:49:42] God in you this morning, Amen. And you
[1:49:45] look in the mirror and you just, it's
[1:49:47] just a Martha. Your eyes are just
[1:49:48] bloodshot. And Satan says, "See, see,
[1:49:51] you ain't got the victory yet." But you
[1:49:54] can stand there and say, "But it is
[1:49:55] written, Satan. I don't know how I'm
[1:49:58] feeling. I I feel like throwing up. I'm
[1:50:00] in back pain. I feel like laying in bed,
[1:50:03] but I'm going to church this morning.
[1:50:05] I'm going to keep pressing on. It is
[1:50:07] written, Satan.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; You may say, "Well, I'm the weakest of
[1:50:14] Christians. Every day it just seems like
[1:50:16] I flat fall on my face." Well, I'm one
[1:50:18] of them. I'm one of them. I just seem
[1:50:20] like I fall flat on my face every day.
[1:50:23] But it doesn't matter how many times you
[1:50:25] fall. It matters how many times you get
[1:50:27] back up again and keep pressing on.
[1:50:30] Brother Brunner says that even the
[1:50:31] weakest of Christians will fall on their
[1:50:33] knees and Satan trembles. When the
[1:50:36] weakest of Christians fall and bow down
[1:50:38] on their knees, Satan becomes afraid.
[1:50:42] Oh my. Cuz he knows there's power in the
[1:50:44] word. He knows that there's power in
[1:50:46] this message. Amen. It doesn't matter
[1:50:48] how strong you are. It doesn't matter
[1:50:50] how smart you are. It doesn't matter how
[1:50:52] well you feel. If you're fully equipped
[1:50:55] with the God's armor, then nothing can
[1:50:57] stand in your way. Nothing can stand in
[1:51:01] your way.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Put on the whole far armor of God.
[1:51:06] Amen. Amen. I'm trying to hurry now.
[1:51:09] See, David was a ready little guy. He
[1:51:12] didn't look like he could amount to
[1:51:13] much, but he had been anointed for a
[1:51:16] purpose. David was anointed for a
[1:51:19] purpose. when no one else would go stand
[1:51:21] up to that giant. David said, "I will
[1:51:23] go." Amen. And Saul told David, "But
[1:51:26] you're just a little kid. You're just a
[1:51:28] little weakling." But and then Goliath's
[1:51:30] been a a soldier from his youth. He's
[1:51:33] been a warrior from his youth. See,
[1:51:35] that's the difference when one has the
[1:51:37] promise. Oh my. Saul said, "Well, if you
[1:51:39] want to go, wear my armor." So, David
[1:51:42] put on Saul's education. He put on
[1:51:44] Saul's ideas. He he used Saul's
[1:51:46] reasonings. and and but David couldn't
[1:51:49] move. He couldn't just he could he
[1:51:51] couldn't maneuver anywhere. So he says,
[1:51:54] "Get this off of me. Get this armor off
[1:51:56] of me. It's not for me." Amen. He He
[1:51:59] said, "Well well, how am I supposed to
[1:52:02] fight like this?" Amen. It will only
[1:52:03] hinder me. So he went out there with
[1:52:06] only five stones, a sling, and a promise
[1:52:10] from God. Amen. And it's the same with
[1:52:12] us today. We must get rid of anything
[1:52:14] that will try hindering us. Amen. a
[1:52:16] truck, just go out there and fight.
[1:52:19] You've been given the promise this
[1:52:21] morning. You've been given the promise
[1:52:23] that you're more than a conqueror. Amen.
[1:52:26] And and as Goliath was making fun of
[1:52:28] him, David walked out there and and
[1:52:31] Goliath was just say, "But you're just a
[1:52:34] little boy. What are you going to do?
[1:52:36] You you're just too weakling." Amen.
[1:52:38] David says, "But you come at me with a
[1:52:41] spear and a sword." Amen. But I come at
[1:52:43] you in the name of the Lord Jesus. Amen.
[1:52:46] So what did he do? Brother Brandham says
[1:52:49] as he as David was standing there, he
[1:52:52] looked past his Goliath. He looked past
[1:52:56] the mountain. He looked past the giant
[1:53:01] and he saw a victory.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. He saw a victory. Amen. No bear
[1:53:08] could eat him. No lion could have him
[1:53:11] for breakfast. And no giant could stop
[1:53:13] David. Why? because he had been given
[1:53:15] the promise that he was going to be king
[1:53:17] one day. He was going to be king one of
[1:53:20] these days. And you've been given the
[1:53:22] promise that you're going to sit with
[1:53:24] him. Amen. That you're going to be more
[1:53:26] than a conqueror. Amen. Don't fear what
[1:53:29] the devil has against you this morning.
[1:53:31] Just keep moving on. Amen. That's what
[1:53:34] we need to do this morning. Just look
[1:53:36] past your fears. Amen. Look past the
[1:53:38] doubt. Look past the circumstances. Look
[1:53:41] past all your senses. Look past your
[1:53:44] giant this morning. Amen. And you will
[1:53:47] see the victory. Amen. You say, "Well,
[1:53:50] how can we have the victory in a time
[1:53:52] like this? How can we have the victory
[1:53:54] when the world is so dark? How can you
[1:53:56] have the victory when the doctor says I
[1:53:59] won't get well? How can I have the
[1:54:01] victory in the when my body is still in
[1:54:03] pain? Because you've been given the
[1:54:06] promise. You've been given the promise
[1:54:08] that you're going to be okay. You've
[1:54:10] been given the promise." So keep
[1:54:13] fighting, keep pressing with any
[1:54:15] everything in you. Amen. You've been
[1:54:17] given the promise. If God before us, if
[1:54:21] God before us, then who can stand
[1:54:24] against? Amen. Psalms 91:7, a thousand
[1:54:28] shall fall at thy side, and 10,000 at
[1:54:31] thy right hand, but it shall not come
[1:54:33] nigh thee. Amen. and the ninth verse.
[1:54:36] Because thou hast made the Lord, which
[1:54:38] is my refuge, even the most high thy
[1:54:41] inhabitation, there shall no evil befall
[1:54:44] thee, neither shall any plague come nigh
[1:54:46] thy dwelling, for he shall give his
[1:54:49] angels charge over thee to keep thee in
[1:54:52] all thy ways. Deuteronomy 3:16, "Be
[1:54:56] strong and of good courage. Fear not,
[1:54:58] nor be afraid of them, for the Lord thy
[1:55:01] God, he it is that doth go with thee. He
[1:55:04] will not fail thee nor forsake thee.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; There were so many promises in this
[1:55:11] word.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; There were so many promises in the word.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; Read the word. It's for you. The Bible
[1:55:19] is for you. The word, the message is for
[1:55:21] you. Amen. Christ is on your side this
[1:55:24] morning. The great and mighty conqueror
[1:55:26] who has never lost a battle is on your
[1:55:30] side. Amen. Go forward and speak the
[1:55:34] word. Amen. If the musicians will
[1:55:36] comeless,
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham says
[1:55:46] before any victory can be won,
[1:55:50] there must be a great price paid.
[1:55:54] Must be great prices paid. Oh, what
[1:55:56] prices?
[1:55:58] And sometimes they are very deep and
[1:56:00] they make great scars and tearing down.
[1:56:04] But in order to have the mountain,
[1:56:06] you've got to have the valley.
[1:56:10] Before we can have the sunshine,
[1:56:13] we've got to get the rain.
[1:56:17] Before we can have the light, we've got
[1:56:20] to have the night.
[1:56:23] Before we can have the right,
[1:56:27] they have to have wrong or we'd never
[1:56:30] know what wrong was.
[1:56:33] Amen. If I could say this this morning,
[1:56:36] before we can have our healing, there
[1:56:39] first had to come sickness.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; Before we can have the victory, there
[1:56:44] first has to come a battle.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; We must keep fighting. We must keep
[1:56:49] pressing the battle.
[1:56:52] We must keep lifting our banner up high.
[1:56:56] He said he would never leave us nor
[1:56:58] forsake us.
[1:57:00] That he would be with us, even in us, to
[1:57:04] the end of the world. Amen. We've got a
[1:57:07] home in glory.
[1:57:10] Let's press forward that prize. We've
[1:57:12] got loved ones waiting on us. I've got a
[1:57:14] mother waiting on me. I've got friends
[1:57:16] waiting on me over there. Amen. There
[1:57:19] are saints waiting for us. Let's keep
[1:57:21] pressing the battle. Let's keep pressing
[1:57:24] with everything that's within us.
[1:57:27] Press toward the prize.
[1:57:30] It's just in sight. I mean, we're here
[1:57:33] at the end time. This is it. Keep
[1:57:35] pressing the battle. Don't give up.
[1:57:39] Keep believing for your healing. Keep
[1:57:41] believing for your deliverances. Keep
[1:57:44] believing for your children. Keep
[1:57:45] believing for your spouse. Victory is
[1:57:48] just ahead.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:51] Oh my.
[1:57:54] Brother Brandham tells a story.
[1:57:58] I believe only a couple times, but I
[1:58:00] know you all know it. But he tells a
[1:58:03] story. He said that Caesar was going to
[1:58:05] ask.
[1:58:07] He was going to ride in a great chariot
[1:58:10] and he wanted some of his soldiers, an
[1:58:12] honorable soldier
[1:58:15] to ride with him down through the
[1:58:17] streets of this great jubilee.
[1:58:20] and he was going to choose just one to
[1:58:22] ride with them.
[1:58:24] So all the warriors trimmed their plums
[1:58:26] and they polished their shields.
[1:58:30] They were just getting ready cuz Caesar
[1:58:32] was coming. She Caesar was going to make
[1:58:33] his choice. So they wanted to look their
[1:58:35] best.
[1:58:37] So as they trimmed their plums, polished
[1:58:39] their shields and their helmets getting
[1:58:41] ready to pass by Caesar
[1:58:44] to review to see who had been chosen to
[1:58:46] ride with him in this great parade.
[1:58:49] All of his warriors walking perfectly,
[1:58:52] straightly
[1:58:54] walked by and stood with their salute.
[1:58:57] And all along Caesar looked at each one
[1:58:59] of them as he passed by
[1:59:02] and said after a little while a little
[1:59:04] bitty old soldier
[1:59:07] crippled up in his arm.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; That's right. scarred all over his face
[1:59:14] and everything walked by and he felt
[1:59:16] ashamed of himself
[1:59:21] and kind of bowed his head and he
[1:59:23] started to walk away cuz he was
[1:59:25] embarrassed.
[1:59:27] And Jesus said, "Wait a minute. Wait a
[1:59:30] minute there. Come back here." He said,
[1:59:33] "Yes, great emperor."
[1:59:36] He says, "Where did you get them scars?
[1:59:40] Why are you all scarred up? He says, I
[1:59:43] got them in the battlefield fighting for
[1:59:44] my emperor.
[1:59:46] He says, you come up here with me.
[1:59:49] You're the one that I've chosen.
[1:59:52] You're the one that's earned a ride.
[1:59:55] Brother Brenham says, "I don't care
[1:59:56] whether I'm DD, PhD, or doubleld.
[2:00:00] I want some scars to show that I've been
[2:00:03] in the battle." That's what Christians
[2:00:06] ought to do. Don't choose the flowery
[2:00:09] easy things. I'll take away with the
[2:00:12] Lord's despised few. I've started with
[2:00:15] Jesus.
[2:00:17] Oh Lord, take me through.
[2:00:22] Let's show our scars this morning. Let's
[2:00:25] show that we've been in the battle.
[2:00:28] Amen. The scars are only a testimony of
[2:00:31] God's grace
[2:00:33] to prove that we've been in the heat of
[2:00:35] the battle.
[2:00:37] Oh my.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Can we just bow our heads for a moment?
[2:00:44] You may still feel the pain.
[2:00:48] You may still be suffering. You may
[2:00:50] still see your loved ones still in the
[2:00:52] world.
[2:00:55] But look beyond your natural ability.
[2:00:58] Look beyond your senses this morning.
[2:01:01] Look beyond the impossible
[2:01:05] and look to God's word this morning for
[2:01:08] victory belongs to you.
[2:01:12] Amen.
[2:01:15] How many can say, "Lord,
[2:01:18] I'm taking you at your word this
[2:01:20] morning.
[2:01:22] No matter how I'm feeling,
[2:01:24] no matter what the doctor may say, no
[2:01:26] matter what my conscience says,
[2:01:29] Lord, I believe your word and I'm and
[2:01:32] I'm expecting my victory this morning.
[2:01:36] You've got to set a stake down. You've
[2:01:38] got to drive a stake this morning.
[2:01:41] Drive a stake this morning. Says, "Lord,
[2:01:43] I'm healed. Lord, I've got my
[2:01:45] deliverance.
[2:01:47] Lord, I've got my children saved."
[2:01:51] Drive a steak this morning that when you
[2:01:53] go home the next day, the next weeks,
[2:01:56] the next months, the next years, when
[2:01:58] Satan begins to plague your mind, you
[2:02:00] can say, "Satan,
[2:02:02] on that day, on that day, I drove a
[2:02:05] stake down and I claimed my healing. I
[2:02:09] claimed my victory. I claimed my
[2:02:12] children.
[2:02:13] I drove a stake down. Satan, get away
[2:02:17] from me. Get away from me, Satan.
[2:02:21] Amen.
[2:02:23] Just drive a stake down and say, "Lord,
[2:02:25] I'm here. Lord, I'm claiming every
[2:02:28] promise you have for me. Lord, I'm not
[2:02:30] giving up. Lord, I'm not going to give
[2:02:32] up today. I'm not going to give up
[2:02:34] tomorrow. Lord, I've come too far to
[2:02:37] give up now. You've been too good to me
[2:02:40] to give up now. You've been too good to
[2:02:43] me to doubt your word. Now,
[2:02:46] I'm going to keep pressing on.
[2:02:50] Amen. That should be our heart's desires
[2:02:52] with everyone this morning
[2:02:56] is Lord, I need you. Lord, I need your
[2:02:59] strength. Lord, I need you to keep
[2:03:02] pressing on. Don't ever leave my side.
[2:03:06] Hold my hand all the way, Lord.
[2:03:17] terribly. Father, Lord,
[2:03:21] Lord, we feel your presence this
[2:03:23] morning, Lord.
[2:03:26] Lord, you said in your word,
[2:03:29] the victory belongs to us.
[2:03:32] Lord, you said in your word to take the
[2:03:34] full armor of God. And Lord, I believe
[2:03:38] that I'm standing here this morning with
[2:03:40] warriors, warriors of the cross.
[2:03:45] Lord, who has never given up, who's
[2:03:47] never never turned around.
[2:03:52] Lord, we've got needs this morning,
[2:03:54] Father.
[2:03:57] Lord, Satan's been bombarding our minds.
[2:04:02] He's been trying to get us to turn
[2:04:04] around. He's been trying to get us to
[2:04:05] give up.
[2:04:07] But Lord, we're trusting in you, Lord.
[2:04:10] We're believing in your word this
[2:04:12] morning. Lord, you said whatever we ask
[2:04:14] in your name, Lord. You said you will
[2:04:16] give it to us.
[2:04:18] And Lord, we accept our healing. We
[2:04:21] accept our deliverance. Lord, we accept
[2:04:24] every promise you have for us, Lord. You
[2:04:28] said, "Ask you for big things." And
[2:04:30] Lord, we're asking you to move. Lord,
[2:04:34] speak to your children this morning.
[2:04:36] Lord, meet every need this morning is
[2:04:39] our prayer. Lord,
[2:04:42] make us warriors. Father, give us
[2:04:45] scarves. Lord, let us prove, Lord, that
[2:04:47] we've been in the battle.
[2:04:50] Let us keep pressing on, Lord.
[2:04:54] We thank you for it, Lord Jesus. We
[2:04:57] thank you for it, Lord. Thank you for
[2:04:58] victory. Thank you for your promise.
[2:05:01] Thank you Lord. Thank you for moving
[2:05:04] Lord. Thank you for answering our
[2:05:07] prayers.
[2:05:08] We love you Father. We thank you Lord.
[2:05:15] We won't prevail.
[2:05:20] For the God I serve knows only how to
[2:05:24] prosper.
[2:05:28] Trying for my God will never fail.
[2:05:34] No,
[2:05:36] my God will never
[2:05:39] fail.
[2:05:42] I'm going to see a victory.
[2:05:46] I'm going to see a victory.
[2:05:50] For the battle belongs to you, Lord. Oh,
[2:05:57] I'm going to see a victory.
[2:06:01] I'm going to see a victory.
[2:06:05] For the battle belongs to you, Lord.
[2:06:13] Oh, there's power in the mighty name of
[2:06:17] Jesus.
[2:06:19] [Music]
[2:06:21] And every war he wages, he will win.
[2:06:28] And I'm not backing down from any giant.
[2:06:35] Oh, cuz I know how this story ends.
[2:06:41] Yes,
[2:06:44] I know how this story ends. Oh, I'm
