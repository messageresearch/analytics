[40:48] wrath or doubting
[40:51] have total confidence in that atonement
[40:54] that you made father
[40:56] and Lord based upon that atonement we're
[40:59] asking that you would just come
[41:02] and move Among Us and speak to every
[41:06] heart Lord and work the supernatural
[41:09] Lord
[41:10] I pray that you would take control Lord
[41:13] of my lips father and take control of
[41:17] the people's
[41:19] hearts and years Lords and and may you
[41:23] be glorified tonight give us greater
[41:25] understanding of your word
[41:27] we ask it in Jesus Christ's name
[41:31] amen and amen
[41:34] uh the book of Psalms the 23rd chapter
[41:38] uh starting at the first verse and said
[41:41] the Lord is my shepherd
[41:43] I shall not one he maketh me to lie down
[41:46] in Green Pastures
[41:49] eliteth me beside the Still Waters
[41:52] he restoreth my soul
[41:55] eliteth me in the paths of righteousness
[41:59] for his name's sake
[42:02] amen you can have your seats this
[42:04] evening
[42:05] and um
[42:07] tonight I'm just going to be referring a
[42:10] lot of scriptures and
[42:13] um but we have been speaking uh about
[42:17] being led in the paths of righteousness
[42:21] and the Lord being Our Shepherd and and
[42:25] as we've seen brother Brandon said uh uh
[42:29] righteousness
[42:30] is is his word
[42:34] amen so we we could say it that he leads
[42:38] me in the paths of his word
[42:41] not in any in any other thing but the
[42:44] paths of his word it's always the word
[42:46] of God
[42:47] and so I I believe as as we've talked
[42:51] about it uh but I I believe it's safe to
[42:54] say that uh this the paths of
[42:58] righteousness he leading Us in the paths
[43:00] of righteousness is uh for us it's
[43:03] dealing with the second part of
[43:05] redemption which is going into
[43:08] uh I I believe that we are uh in uh the
[43:14] promised land which in one place brother
[43:18] Brown said the land of adoption and it
[43:21] has to do with that third pull Ministry
[43:24] brother Bram talks about and if you
[43:28] remember we we uh mentioned where
[43:30] brother Branham uh talked to the vision
[43:32] he had and he was standing on the map on
[43:36] a map of Palestine and he was at the
[43:40] Jordan River and he was looking across
[43:44] there but he said he looked back at
[43:47] where he came from and he said he was
[43:50] two-thirds of the way uh there he had
[43:53] already gone two-thirds of the way uh
[43:57] which I believe uh was speaking of the
[44:00] first and second pool of his ministry
[44:03] and so but then he looked across uh uh
[44:07] Jordan River and he said oh praise God
[44:10] just on the other side is where all the
[44:14] promises lay every promise lays in the
[44:18] promised land now he was speaking this
[44:21] in the message uh Paradox in 1961.
[44:26] and so I believe that it was it was God
[44:30] letting the church know what was fixing
[44:33] to happen
[44:34] uh uh there and that the ministry was
[44:37] getting ready to change and so in 1962
[44:42] now he said that in in 1961 and in 1962
[44:48] uh brother Branham says now watch close
[44:51] this is going to have a spiritual
[44:54] background let us now let us stand like
[44:57] Joshua and Caleb as we see the promised
[45:00] land coming in sight
[45:01] it's nearing the time to be given Joshua
[45:06] in Hebrew means Savior and represents
[45:09] the promised end-time leader to take the
[45:13] church over and Caleb represents the
[45:16] True Believer who stayed with Joshua
[45:19] amen so this is why we stand with Joshua
[45:21] ain't that right and we know that
[45:24] brother Rams says that Joshua is the
[45:26] Holy Ghost but he also said Joshua or
[45:29] the Holy Ghost is the prophet you know
[45:31] he was the prophet in Isaiah's age he
[45:33] was the prophet in Elijah's day so he's
[45:35] the prophet in our day as well ain't
[45:37] that right it was it the the real
[45:40] Prophet is God Amen and so this is why
[45:44] we we follow the message of brother
[45:46] Branham because we realized it wasn't
[45:48] just a man uh God had his picture taken
[45:51] with him to show that it was God a man
[45:54] that was leading us ain't that right and
[45:57] so in 1965 after the seals are open
[46:02] brother Branham identified the third
[46:04] pool
[46:05] as being the opening of the word the
[46:08] Mysteries revealed and then he says
[46:11] there is no more higher order to reveal
[46:14] the word than prophets but the only way
[46:18] the prophet can be Vindicated is by the
[46:21] word and remember the third pool was see
[46:26] it was the opening of them Seven Seals
[46:30] to reveal the hidden truth the hidden
[46:34] truth that's been sealed in the word of
[46:36] God Amen and so as based upon these
[46:41] things then we can look and say as the
[46:43] elective God we are now in the promised
[46:48] land the land of the open book by the
[46:53] message of the hour now remember when
[46:57] Jesus died brother Brandon says you know
[47:00] that well the Bible says it that when
[47:02] Jesus died that the veil in the temple
[47:05] was is rent from the top to the bottom
[47:08] amen and and you go in in listening to
[47:11] the messages the Mighty God unveiled and
[47:15] brother Branham talks about that and
[47:17] ties it to our day and it's important
[47:21] um uh uh that if to to go listen to that
[47:24] if you if you can but he said see God
[47:27] took the temple and tore it to pieces
[47:29] that they might see God in plain view
[47:34] and they was too blind to see it and
[47:38] he's done the same thing today putting
[47:41] his word right out in front what he
[47:45] promised ain't that right see and he's
[47:48] speaking this now after the the seals
[47:51] have been opened and he said so the same
[47:54] thing that was done there has been done
[47:58] today in this age and and and that was a
[48:01] natural Veil that brother Branham said
[48:04] today the veil is is a veil of
[48:06] traditions the veil of Creeds the veil
[48:09] of of these things but God has torn down
[48:13] them veils that's why brother Branham
[48:16] hit them uh uh denomination so hard he
[48:20] blasted that thing because it was God
[48:23] tearing down the veil for you and I
[48:25] ain't that right amen he had to tear
[48:28] down the veil so we could see God in
[48:30] plain view and so he says see he's done
[48:34] the same thing putting his word right
[48:36] out in front what he promised every
[48:39] promise in the word is laying right
[48:42] before us in plain view he says you know
[48:45] what the Gentile Church does the same
[48:48] thing the Jewish Church did too blind to
[48:51] see it and Saul it'll be on their hearts
[48:54] just as it was in that day and remember
[48:57] Paul says that the veil was on their
[49:00] heart ain't that right amen they
[49:02] couldn't believe they couldn't
[49:03] understand they couldn't see oh they
[49:05] they could read the scriptures but the
[49:07] their their heart was void of
[49:09] understanding and so is it today ain't
[49:12] that right so as as we're looking at
[49:15] this walking in the paths of
[49:16] righteousness in the land of the open
[49:19] book where we've got the promises all
[49:22] there right before us and and and so
[49:25] this if you'll notice is this has to do
[49:28] with more than just walking through the
[49:31] land amen and and and observing all of
[49:36] our surroundings and and say oh wow
[49:38] that's nice and that's nice and and oh
[49:40] yes yes yes he did promise that and yes
[49:43] he yes he promised this and oh yeah that
[49:45] that's really nice and and all that amen
[49:48] but this is has the has to do with doing
[49:53] this is about doing or fulfilling
[49:57] righteousness can you say man remember
[50:00] Jesus said it becometh us to fulfill all
[50:05] righteousness that's right so he came
[50:08] the prophet said to fulfill all the word
[50:12] that the prophets had spoke of him he
[50:16] healed the sick to fulfill the word he
[50:18] raised the dead to fulfill the word he
[50:21] said at Liberty them that are bruised to
[50:24] heal the uh uh to fulfill the word in
[50:28] the gospels in the four gospels that
[50:30] talk about Christ's life a scripture
[50:33] after scripture amen was fulfilled and
[50:37] and and and and and he did things that
[50:40] it might be feel fulfilled he said
[50:42] things that it might be fulfilled he
[50:45] went to places that it might be
[50:48] fulfilled and you look look at it it
[50:50] says and this was done that it might be
[50:52] fulfilled and he said this that it might
[50:55] be fulfilled and and everything
[50:57] all around him because he had come to
[51:01] fulfill the scriptures ain't that right
[51:03] amen not to talk about enough to
[51:06] prophesy of something he was the one
[51:09] that they had prophesied Earth a man and
[51:12] so all around him the prophecies that
[51:15] were waiting for him to come they were
[51:18] laying there in the in the scripture in
[51:20] the word just laying dormant amen uh uh
[51:24] waiting for him to come we're now being
[51:27] fulfilled because he had finally come to
[51:31] Earth ain't that right amen and so the
[51:34] same thing is happening today if you
[51:38] could look and and realize what is going
[51:41] on Amen now brother Branham lets us know
[51:44] this too he says we see a roar in the
[51:47] paper across the television out across
[51:49] the Nations where five stars fell in
[51:52] line with the world what's five a number
[51:55] of Grace every time those stars come
[51:58] then something happens on the earth
[52:01] ain't that right Isaiah sister Jane you
[52:03] was telling me five stars July up a few
[52:06] months ago and and and most people
[52:09] didn't even know it a man see but but
[52:11] but but it has a significance of and he
[52:15] says every time they line up amen it
[52:18] it's for a reason see and so here it is
[52:21] now something happens on Earth what
[52:24] taken place five stars fell in what was
[52:27] it introducing he said see since uh uh
[52:32] since then just look what's taken place
[52:35] Germany almost washed off the map some
[52:38] of the Mad guys said that the world
[52:40] would burst like a watermelon every
[52:42] distressful things prophesied by them
[52:45] for the last days looks what's taken
[52:48] place England the other day had a storm
[52:51] that blowed away seventy thousand houses
[52:53] in one day disasters everywhere
[52:56] California Los Angeles like to wash into
[52:59] the ocean what is it it's the beginning
[53:02] of Sorrows earthquakes has picked up
[53:05] everywheres why five stars have come in
[53:09] line and it's God's grace ain't that
[53:12] right five is the number of Grace he
[53:15] said what's happened why what what why
[53:17] what is all this about an infant Church
[53:20] Hallelujah a bride infancy that the
[53:24] power of God has begun to fall on Earth
[53:27] and she's taken form a bride for this
[53:31] bright groom ain't that right he says
[53:34] see that three stars meant his
[53:36] Perfection of the heavenly father in the
[53:39] Trinity becoming one on earth Among Us
[53:42] Now God's offices or he says that that
[53:45] was God's office is becoming one but
[53:48] what happened now it's the Church of the
[53:51] Living God coming together under the
[53:54] word of God and the astronomic heaven is
[53:58] announcing her approach ain't that right
[54:00] amen so we we we're looking at this that
[54:04] we are a special group of people amen as
[54:08] three stars lined up for his birth a man
[54:10] when he first come now we've got five
[54:12] stars which is a number of Grays
[54:15] announcing the approach of the bride of
[54:18] Christ another Masterpiece a man say so
[54:21] notice now look what's happening today
[54:24] the foolish virgin a man is crying out
[54:27] for oil you can you see it everywhere
[54:31] they're they're crying out for a move of
[54:33] God they want that oil uh uh there
[54:36] Israel has been restored to its Homeland
[54:39] a man which fulfills what Jesus said
[54:42] that the Fig Tree about the Fig Tree
[54:46] putting forth its buds Jesus said there
[54:49] in Luke 21 29 a man breaking in behold
[54:53] the Fig Tree and all the trees when they
[54:57] when they now shoot forth and you you
[55:00] see and know of your own cells that
[55:03] summer is now my hand so likewise when
[55:08] you see these things come to pass know
[55:10] ye that the kingdom of God is at hand
[55:14] ain't that right so Jesus was pointing
[55:16] to a day and and and were in that day
[55:19] amen to think of it he would speak that
[55:22] 2000 years ago or or maybe over and
[55:25] would prophesy and them scriptures have
[55:27] been laying dead and were dormant for
[55:30] all these years until this age right
[55:33] here amen and we know that the fig tree
[55:36] has always been the Jewish Nation amen
[55:40] and and that fig tree has budded a man
[55:43] for the prophet said Israel is in her
[55:46] Homeland today amen but not only has the
[55:50] Fig Tree brought forth its leaves but
[55:52] all all the trees has brought forth
[55:55] their leaves brother Brown said them
[55:56] trees are the denominations a man
[55:59] putting forth their leaves the
[56:01] Presbyterians the Methodist the Baptist
[56:03] the lutherans the Pentecost all the
[56:06] churches putting for their leaves
[56:08] revival can you say amen amen and
[56:11] they're speaking of Revival they're
[56:13] saying Revival is hitting everywhere
[56:15] amen and so we can see that the that
[56:18] that that the leaves are putting forth a
[56:21] man or the trees are putting forth their
[56:24] their leaves but it had to wait for this
[56:27] day look at Russia that was a nothing it
[56:29] was a nobody it was it was there uh uh
[56:33] just just a uh a little thorn in in in
[56:36] in in in the side so to speak but now
[56:39] amen Russia which the Bible calls the
[56:42] King of the North and and there's a
[56:44] prophecy laying for Russia amen and
[56:47] talks about it there in in Revelations
[56:49] in Daniel I believe and all that and now
[56:52] where is Russia she has risen up in
[56:54] prominence Amen in in position in in the
[56:58] world today everybody recognizes Russia
[57:01] everybody fears Russia and look at her
[57:04] flexing her muscles out as as there
[57:06] she's got prominence because there's a
[57:08] word concerning her ain't that right but
[57:10] it had to wait for this hour it had to
[57:13] wait for this day a man see and so
[57:16] brother Bradham in speaking of Jesus
[57:18] said he believed what God Said was truth
[57:22] Jesus believed that what God Said was
[57:25] true and the words must be fulfilled and
[57:29] he knew what his life was to fulfill
[57:33] them so Jesus knew he he had purpose
[57:36] amen he could see himself in the book
[57:39] and every scripture that concerned the
[57:41] Messiah he knew that he would fulfill
[57:44] that amen but the prophet said you're
[57:46] here to fulfill it as well amen the time
[57:50] has come amen for us as we're in this
[57:53] land of promises amen not to look at
[57:55] everything and observe and say wow
[57:57] that's cool amen and pass it to another
[58:00] generation you are the people a man of
[58:03] the book you are the people a man that a
[58:06] prophet came amen and God delivered us
[58:09] into the promised land as Joshua
[58:12] delivered the people into that promised
[58:14] land and I say to you it becometh us to
[58:18] fulfill all righteousness can you say
[58:20] Amen now notice brother Brown said in
[58:23] order for Jesus to fulfill the word of
[58:25] God he had to be the expression of God's
[58:30] word amen he had to be amen and and so I
[58:34] looked up that word expression it means
[58:37] something that manifests or embodies see
[58:41] so he had to be the expression of God's
[58:44] word in order to fulfill all
[58:48] righteousness amen and so the Bible
[58:51] speaks of Jesus saying that he was the
[58:54] visible image of the invisible God he
[58:57] was the image and the prophet said the
[58:59] visible image of the invisible God ain't
[59:02] that right amen so God was in flesh to
[59:06] fulfill his Divine word every promise
[59:10] amen now notice as we're going here and
[59:13] just hopefully I I can uh it'll bring it
[59:18] clear to us but James 1 22 uh breaking
[59:22] in he says be ye doers everybody say be
[59:25] ye doers of the word
[59:27] and not hearers only deceiving yourself
[59:31] see so you got a responsibility amen be
[59:34] doers of the word for If any man be a
[59:37] hearer of the word and not a doer he is
[59:40] likened to a man be holding his face as
[59:43] natural face in a glass or a mirror for
[59:46] he beholdeth himself and goeth his way
[59:48] and straightway forgetth what manner of
[59:51] man he was my eye see but whosoever
[59:55] looked us into the perfect law of
[59:57] Liberty and continuous therein he being
[1:00:01] not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the
[1:00:05] work this man shall be blessed in his
[1:00:09] deed ain't that right then you go to
[1:00:11] Paul uh in Romans 2 13. he tells us that
[1:00:15] it isn't the hearer of the law or the
[1:00:18] word a man that are just before God but
[1:00:23] the doers of the law amen shall be amen
[1:00:27] amen Psalms 15 and 1 Lord who shall
[1:00:31] abide in the Tabernacle a man who shall
[1:00:34] dwell in my holy heel and and and he
[1:00:38] that walketh uprightly and worketh
[1:00:41] righteousness ain't that right amen see
[1:00:44] thy Tabernacle that that that body that
[1:00:48] that a word body see amen who who's
[1:00:51] going to dwell a man in that Holy Hill
[1:00:53] who's going to dwell in that City Amen
[1:00:56] in other words is what he's saying amen
[1:00:58] it's the one that woke us uprightly and
[1:01:02] worketh worketh not heareth worketh
[1:01:05] righteousness and speaks uh the truth in
[1:01:08] his heart amen Psalms 22 and 30. a seed
[1:01:13] Shall Serve him and talking of of Christ
[1:01:16] and and his seed a seed Shall Serve him
[1:01:19] and it shall be counted to the Lord for
[1:01:22] a generation and you remember amen the
[1:01:25] the the uh the question and out from
[1:01:27] Isaiah who shall declare his generation
[1:01:30] for he was cut off from the land of the
[1:01:33] living he ain't got a seed so to speak
[1:01:36] he was cut off so who's going to declare
[1:01:38] him amen but then he promised that there
[1:01:41] would be a seed that would declare him
[1:01:43] ain't that right and church that we are
[1:01:46] that seed and a seed Shall Serve him and
[1:01:49] it shall be accounted to the Lord for a
[1:01:52] generation they shall come and shall
[1:01:55] declare his righteousness or Express his
[1:02:00] righteousness unto a people that shall
[1:02:03] be born that he hath done this amen
[1:02:07] righteousness amen job 29 14 it says I
[1:02:12] put on righteousness and it clothed me
[1:02:15] amen Psalms 132 9 let thy priest be
[1:02:20] clothed with righteousness and the Bible
[1:02:23] says we are Kings and Priests unto our
[1:02:26] God ain't that right be clothed with
[1:02:29] righteousness Isaiah 61 and 10 I will
[1:02:32] greatly rejoice in the Lord my soul
[1:02:35] shall be joyful in my God for he hath
[1:02:40] clothed me with the garments of
[1:02:42] Salvation he hath covered me with the
[1:02:45] robe of righteousness as a bridegroom
[1:02:48] deck as himself with ornaments and as a
[1:02:51] bride adorneth herself with jewels my
[1:02:55] Revelations 19 and 7 let us be glad and
[1:02:59] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[1:03:02] marriage of the Lamb is come how many
[1:03:05] believes were rare for the marriage of
[1:03:07] the Lamb hey any day we're going to that
[1:03:10] marriage supper any day we are the
[1:03:13] people amen there is no other generation
[1:03:15] there is no other age you are the finale
[1:03:18] amen you are this scripture right here
[1:03:20] Amen Let us be glad and rejoice give
[1:03:24] honor to him for the marriage of the
[1:03:26] Lamb has come and his wife everybody say
[1:03:29] his wife now that's you now his wife
[1:03:32] hath made her self-ready amen see it
[1:03:36] becometh us to fulfill all righteousness
[1:03:38] and to her was granted that she should
[1:03:41] be arrayed in fine linen clean and white
[1:03:44] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[1:03:48] of the Saints can you say man see and
[1:03:52] and then the prophet Raptor reading that
[1:03:54] says she is clothed in his righteousness
[1:03:58] it shows that she is a word Bride Can
[1:04:01] you say man amen for the prophet said
[1:04:04] the Garment she had on was his own word
[1:04:08] and she was dressed in his righteousness
[1:04:11] so so the this bride amen what you're
[1:04:14] dressed with what you're clothed with is
[1:04:17] his word amen aren't you glad for that
[1:04:19] amen every promise a man that we're we
[1:04:23] we that have spoke of this day is the
[1:04:25] thing that will close you amen and dress
[1:04:28] you amen for the for this wedding supper
[1:04:32] hey ain't that right now in in First
[1:04:35] John 3 and 7 amen he says little
[1:04:39] children let no man deceive you he that
[1:04:42] doeth righteousness is righteous even as
[1:04:46] he is righteous
[1:04:48] ain't that right so got the same
[1:04:50] righteousness amen not not different
[1:04:53] righteousness but as he is righteous he
[1:04:56] that doeth righteousness is righteous as
[1:05:00] he is righteous ain't that right and the
[1:05:04] word doeth there means fulfilled a man
[1:05:07] see so he that fulfills righteousness is
[1:05:12] righteous even as he is righteous now
[1:05:17] notice the Bible is prophesied of a
[1:05:19] people in this day that that would have
[1:05:22] a form of godliness amen just to form
[1:05:26] and this is completely different a man
[1:05:30] from from fulfilling righteousness
[1:05:33] it's just a form a man and the word form
[1:05:37] is a visible shape or configuration of
[1:05:40] something it's it's a body of a person
[1:05:43] or thing it's it's the external
[1:05:46] appearance ain't that right amen so so
[1:05:50] example the Brazen serpent there in the
[1:05:53] Old Testament it was it was it was
[1:05:56] shaped as a snake as a as a serpent but
[1:05:59] it wasn't a serpent it was just the form
[1:06:02] of a serpent right it was just a form
[1:06:05] amen it had no life and so and and
[1:06:09] that's just one of the things that we
[1:06:11] can look at but but let's look at it in
[1:06:13] the spiritual sense amen that that the
[1:06:16] Catholics they they have all kinds of
[1:06:18] statues that they prayed to some of
[1:06:20] these Idols are made in the form of a
[1:06:23] woman a man called Mary or some other
[1:06:27] name see and then some of these Idols
[1:06:30] are made in the form of a man which yeah
[1:06:33] uh they call Jesus or Peter or or Saint
[1:06:38] something else you know amen but none of
[1:06:40] these have life amen they just they they
[1:06:43] they are they are a form of something
[1:06:46] ain't that right a man's seat and so a
[1:06:49] form of godliness is something that
[1:06:52] human beings practice yet there is no
[1:06:55] Godly life a man that is there is just a
[1:07:00] form it's a form but yet it's devoid a
[1:07:04] man of God ain't that right amen you you
[1:07:07] could have a church and it just has a
[1:07:09] form amen with without the life of God
[1:07:13] and and so that's that's what the
[1:07:15] prophet is saying or uh uh Peter is
[1:07:17] saying godliness without God is just a
[1:07:21] form ain't that rap godliness without
[1:07:24] God is just a form amen I'm getting
[1:07:27] somewhere now and so as uh since after
[1:07:31] the fall of Man there have been all
[1:07:33] kinds kinds of forms of religion all
[1:07:36] kinds of forms of religion Creeds
[1:07:39] darkmas in in all of these things and
[1:07:42] the prophet said that Satan is bringing
[1:07:44] his bride to him in a form of religion
[1:07:48] called dogmas and Creeds it's just a
[1:07:51] form ain't that right now one thing I
[1:07:54] have noticed a man is that legalism
[1:07:56] thrives on forms of religion it it
[1:08:01] thrives on forms and man-made leadership
[1:08:04] takes preeminence in forms of religion
[1:08:08] it could be one man dictating a group of
[1:08:11] people look take Nimrod for example or
[1:08:14] even the pope a man they're dictating
[1:08:16] over a a people and and they've got
[1:08:19] their own form of worship a form of
[1:08:22] religion form of of of of of of of
[1:08:25] whatever seek or it could be the
[1:08:27] leadership of a group of men such as the
[1:08:30] Pharisees and the Sadducees and and
[1:08:33] today it would be called denominations
[1:08:35] and it's just a form a ritual a a
[1:08:40] dictate of of men to where a preacher
[1:08:43] couldn't preach the truth a man without
[1:08:45] answering a man to the headquarters you
[1:08:48] understand what I'm saying it's a
[1:08:50] dictate of men a man in the form of
[1:08:53] religion or it could be an individual
[1:08:55] dictating his or her own life such as
[1:09:00] Cain did ain't that right so any
[1:09:03] religion outside of God's leadership and
[1:09:06] Direction and power amen constitutes a
[1:09:09] form of religion a man see and so we see
[1:09:13] that a form of godliness is just nothing
[1:09:16] just another form of of religion one
[1:09:20] writer said forms in Christianity are
[1:09:23] mostly familiarly uh uh uh dictates of
[1:09:28] church Authority or tradition Church
[1:09:31] government uh liturgy uh uh Doctrine see
[1:09:35] so so that that that's what becomes the
[1:09:38] dictate in forms of Christianity see is
[1:09:42] a church Authority traditions and and
[1:09:44] all that and and so they he says the the
[1:09:47] pattern of religious practice is a form
[1:09:51] of religion just go to church go do your
[1:09:54] thing amen listen to the preacher do
[1:09:56] this do that live by colds live by
[1:09:59] conduct live by the rules of the church
[1:10:01] and all of that that is just the form
[1:10:03] ain't that right but we're not talking
[1:10:06] about form amen we're talking about
[1:10:08] fulfilling all righteousness can you say
[1:10:12] Amen example there are Catholics and
[1:10:15] Protestants alike who have confessionals
[1:10:17] a man which follow forms that are
[1:10:21] dictated by Church Authority or
[1:10:23] Traditions amen amen Catholics just
[1:10:26] don't come up to the altar like we would
[1:10:28] or kneel at a at a at a Pew like we
[1:10:31] would and and and talk to God they
[1:10:33] they've got their statues they've got
[1:10:35] their candles they've got their priests
[1:10:37] they've got their confessional that's a
[1:10:39] form of religion ain't that right well
[1:10:42] denominations do too amen they have
[1:10:45] their form of religions and and all of
[1:10:48] these things and so uh with this form of
[1:10:51] religion and form of godliness or
[1:10:54] whatever
[1:10:55] self-righteousness everybody say
[1:10:57] self-righteousness is exercised in forms
[1:11:02] of religion or godliness and every
[1:11:05] denomination or non-denomination has a
[1:11:09] form of godliness with the exception of
[1:11:12] those who are part of the bride of
[1:11:14] Christ a man and self-righteousness is
[1:11:17] only a form amen but it has no power to
[1:11:21] fulfill all righteousness so every form
[1:11:24] of godliness the forms of religion amen
[1:11:27] it it only exercises self-righteousness
[1:11:30] ain't that right amen uh uh that that's
[1:11:34] right see so the righteousness though
[1:11:37] that David is speaking of is not a
[1:11:39] self-righteousness amen uh the Lord is
[1:11:42] not leading Us in the paths of
[1:11:45] self-righteousness ain't that right amen
[1:11:48] now denominations will lead you that way
[1:11:50] a form of religion will lead you that
[1:11:52] way amen a form of godliness will lead
[1:11:56] you in the paths of self-righteousness
[1:11:58] Amen but we're not leading being led in
[1:12:01] the past of self-righteousness we are
[1:12:04] being led in the paths of his
[1:12:06] righteousness can you say amen that's
[1:12:09] right see so now notice
[1:12:11] self-righteousness Works apart from the
[1:12:14] atonement it works apart from the
[1:12:17] revealed word of God a man see and so we
[1:12:21] can look at Cain for an example he went
[1:12:24] through all the forms and the Motions as
[1:12:27] did Abel but he was self-righteous in
[1:12:31] what he did ain't that right he wasn't
[1:12:34] looking to please God he wasn't looking
[1:12:36] to honor God he was depending upon his
[1:12:40] own abilities his own way his see he did
[1:12:43] it he worshiped yes he erected an altar
[1:12:47] yes he brought forth a substance unto
[1:12:50] God yes but he done it all without
[1:12:53] knowing the will of God and offered the
[1:12:56] work of his own hands to God ain't that
[1:12:59] right amen even the Pharisee amen had
[1:13:03] the form of religion and went through
[1:13:05] all the emotion uh the emotions of
[1:13:08] religious duty but yet all the while
[1:13:11] rejecting God's provided way amen so it
[1:13:15] was an exercise a man of of
[1:13:18] self-righteousness ain't that right amen
[1:13:21] now notice Cain offered something that
[1:13:24] was totally contrary to the will of God
[1:13:27] and he'd done it without Revelation or
[1:13:30] understanding but now the Pharisees amen
[1:13:34] they they actually performed the
[1:13:37] Commandment of God Amen for what they'd
[1:13:40] done it was the will of God it was the
[1:13:43] Commandment of God offering a lamb they
[1:13:45] offered the lamb amen having a breeze an
[1:13:48] altar they had one amen they've done it
[1:13:50] all they were working amen exactly the
[1:13:53] way God commanded it amen but they'd
[1:13:56] done it without Revelation amen they've
[1:13:58] done it they didn't have any
[1:14:00] understanding as to what they were doing
[1:14:02] and and so Jesus when he come he said
[1:14:05] you've made the Commandment of God of no
[1:14:08] effect by your Traditions it become a
[1:14:11] tradition to them the house of God
[1:14:14] became a tradition into them worship
[1:14:16] became a tradition to them offering up a
[1:14:19] sacrifice became a tradition to them
[1:14:21] amen they didn't honor God by it it was
[1:14:24] just a tradition because they didn't do
[1:14:27] it with the Revelation or understanding
[1:14:29] they offered a lamb they had their
[1:14:31] altars they had their priests they had
[1:14:33] their amen every ritual amen but they
[1:14:36] couldn't look Beyond The Natural Things
[1:14:39] amen and to see the substance of what
[1:14:43] those things spoke of can you say amen
[1:14:46] amen that's right so when the true lamb
[1:14:48] came on the scene they despised him when
[1:14:52] the true high priest stood in their in
[1:14:54] their midst and they rejected him amen
[1:14:57] when when the God who they claimed the
[1:14:59] worship came in a human body and then
[1:15:02] spoke to them amen They Crucified him
[1:15:06] because everything they'd done even
[1:15:08] though they were obeying the
[1:15:10] Commandments of God they did it without
[1:15:12] revelation
[1:15:14] ain't that right yes sir see they knew
[1:15:18] the Bible they knew the scriptures by
[1:15:20] intellectual knowledge but they didn't
[1:15:23] have the revelation of what it all meant
[1:15:26] so they only had a form of religion
[1:15:32] a form ain't that right and how many
[1:15:34] people go to church today and don't even
[1:15:36] understand why they're going amen why
[1:15:38] they don't understand why it's important
[1:15:40] to amen a preacher Amen to hear the
[1:15:42] preacher they don't understand amen oh
[1:15:45] yeah God sent a prophet but they don't
[1:15:46] understand why God sent a prophet they
[1:15:48] don't even understand it and it's
[1:15:50] becoming a ritual to them it's becoming
[1:15:53] a tradition to them God doesn't want
[1:15:55] Church to be a tradition God doesn't
[1:15:57] want your worship to be a tradition God
[1:16:00] doesn't want your praise to be a
[1:16:02] tradition God doesn't want your a man's
[1:16:05] to be a tradition God wants it to be a
[1:16:07] living reality to you and you can only
[1:16:09] do that through a revelation
[1:16:12] it's great and you say man
[1:16:16] that's right see now if you notice see
[1:16:19] they only had a form of religion but all
[1:16:22] the Old Testament Saints understood that
[1:16:25] the lamb the high priest the altar the
[1:16:30] Tabernacle had a deeper meaning than
[1:16:34] just the natural
[1:16:35] so they were able to look beyond that
[1:16:37] natural lamb and see a true lamb and by
[1:16:41] faith they believed in that lamb
[1:16:44] can you say Amen not not the letter lamb
[1:16:48] the true Lamb by faith amen they were
[1:16:52] looking at a night or they they were
[1:16:54] able to look beyond the natural
[1:16:55] Tabernacle and by faith they could see a
[1:16:58] true Tabernacle and they were able to
[1:17:01] look Beyond and and believe in the true
[1:17:03] Tabernacle they were able to look past
[1:17:05] the natural priest and see a true high
[1:17:08] priest oh Church it wasn't a form of
[1:17:12] religion to them this was something that
[1:17:14] captivated him and when they were doing
[1:17:17] it as they offered that lamb they were
[1:17:19] fulfilling the righteousness amen that
[1:17:22] was revealed to them
[1:17:24] that's right
[1:17:27] it was revealed
[1:17:29] Hebrews 11 and 13 says these all died in
[1:17:33] faith
[1:17:34] not having received the promises but
[1:17:36] having seen them
[1:17:38] afar off
[1:17:40] and were persuaded of them
[1:17:42] oh my to think of that
[1:17:45] as they slaughtered that natural lamb
[1:17:48] amen them Old Testament Saints they
[1:17:50] weren't dependent on the lamb because
[1:17:52] that natural lamb couldn't get them out
[1:17:54] of the grief
[1:17:55] but they sold something far off
[1:17:58] and brother or Paul says it was a
[1:18:00] promise to them afar off they seen it as
[1:18:03] a promise can you say amen and they died
[1:18:05] being persuaded of the promise and not
[1:18:09] embracing the natural but they embraced
[1:18:11] the spiritual they embraced the true
[1:18:13] ain't that right they embraced the
[1:18:15] substance of what the natural had had
[1:18:17] the type had spoke of and so they were
[1:18:20] persuaded of them and embraced them and
[1:18:22] confessed that they were strangers and
[1:18:25] pilgrims on the earth to think of what
[1:18:27] Moses hid he had built the Tabernacle
[1:18:30] and the Wilderness according to what he
[1:18:33] saw in the heavens amen he perfectly
[1:18:36] built the Tabernacle on Earth as what he
[1:18:39] saw in the heavens Amen to think of that
[1:18:42] as he went to the Natural Tabernacle he
[1:18:45] knew that there was a Heavenly
[1:18:46] Tabernacle amen and he has embraced it
[1:18:49] he was persuaded of it because he had
[1:18:52] saw it
[1:18:53] amen hallelujah
[1:18:56] it becomes us
[1:18:59] to fulfill all righteousness
[1:19:01] but those that did not have a revelation
[1:19:03] of of what that lamb spoke of they just
[1:19:06] held to the Natural
[1:19:08] those that had didn't have the
[1:19:09] revelation of what all these forms were
[1:19:12] and all these these these these Works
[1:19:14] were they just held to it as rituals it
[1:19:17] became ritual and then when the lamb
[1:19:20] true lamb come that the natural
[1:19:21] sacrifice spoke of they they crucified
[1:19:24] him can you say amen and so is it doing
[1:19:28] that today in this age
[1:19:31] hallelujah hallelujah but do you realize
[1:19:34] that every Old Testament saying or the
[1:19:36] New Testament Saints before us they saw
[1:19:39] our day I just believe they saw it Paul
[1:19:42] spoke of it amen and those people
[1:19:44] embraced it amen but as they saw it and
[1:19:47] they were in break you are in the land
[1:19:49] of promise Amen to take hold of it and
[1:19:53] make it a reality for you you're not
[1:19:55] looking afar off you're standing right
[1:19:58] there and every promise is opened up
[1:20:01] into your hands
[1:20:03] now hey man
[1:20:09] they were able to see they saw them afar
[1:20:11] off
[1:20:13] God had led them
[1:20:15] by his eye
[1:20:17] and so is it in this age
[1:20:19] he said I'll guide thee with mine
[1:20:22] can you say Amen
[1:20:24] they died in faith
[1:20:26] not having received the promises but
[1:20:28] having seen them afar off and were
[1:20:30] persuaded of them and embraced them but
[1:20:33] then to the others the Commandments of
[1:20:36] God had become a Creed and a Dogma a man
[1:20:39] see and and what is a Creed amen we've
[1:20:42] read it before but a Creed is a
[1:20:44] statement of the basic beliefs of a
[1:20:46] religious Faith a set of guiding
[1:20:49] principles or beliefs a man's seat so
[1:20:52] that that's what they had made the
[1:20:54] Commandments of God nothing but just to
[1:20:56] Creed every denomination has a Creed
[1:20:58] whether it be and and all of them is is
[1:21:01] based upon their own ideas a group of
[1:21:04] men one man or whatever amen uh uh and
[1:21:07] they've developed this and now if you if
[1:21:10] you're a Baptist if you're a Jehovah's
[1:21:12] Witness or if you're a Mormon or if
[1:21:13] you're if you're whatever then then you
[1:21:16] have to come under this this this Creed
[1:21:19] this set of rules this set of belief
[1:21:21] amen and it doesn't matter if you've
[1:21:24] been born again it doesn't matter you
[1:21:26] just automate exactly become a Baptist
[1:21:28] you just automatically become an
[1:21:30] Assemblies of God you just automatically
[1:21:32] become whatever amen because you now
[1:21:35] come under amen that set of of rules
[1:21:38] that that set of of beliefs can you say
[1:21:41] man a Dogma is something considered as
[1:21:45] an established opinion A belief or body
[1:21:48] of beliefs concerning Faith or morals
[1:21:51] laid down by a church so everyone now
[1:21:54] you just think of that a form of
[1:21:56] godliness a form of religion how many
[1:21:59] millions of people just have a form of
[1:22:02] religion amen but yet they're only
[1:22:04] abiding by a form of a belief a belief
[1:22:08] that has been conjured up not from the
[1:22:11] word of God but of man
[1:22:14] and you say Amen
[1:22:16] and and all it is is a
[1:22:19] self-righteousness it it it's promoting
[1:22:21] self-righteousness
[1:22:26] but we'll never be able to stand before
[1:22:28] God depending on our own righteousness
[1:22:31] hope it's all right
[1:22:33] Ezekiel 33 12 therefore thou son of man
[1:22:36] say unto the children of thy people the
[1:22:39] righteousness of the righteous shall not
[1:22:40] deliver them deliver him in the day of
[1:22:44] his transgression
[1:22:45] say that again the righteous of the
[1:22:48] righteous he shall not deliver him in
[1:22:52] the day of his transgression for as the
[1:22:55] wickedness of the wicked he shall not
[1:22:57] fall thereby in the day that he turneth
[1:23:00] from his wickedness neither shall the
[1:23:03] righteous be able to live for his
[1:23:06] righteousness in the day that he sent us
[1:23:08] so no matter how much you go to church
[1:23:10] and how much righteous you are amen by
[1:23:14] your set of beliefs and your set of
[1:23:16] rules in your well I don't care it could
[1:23:18] be you you John if you want strict rules
[1:23:21] join the Muslims they got better rules
[1:23:24] they got stricter rules than what we
[1:23:25] would ever think of Amen if you really
[1:23:28] want to live by set of rules and
[1:23:30] strictness then you go go to there amen
[1:23:33] but yet in the day of your transgression
[1:23:35] not one of them things amen will be able
[1:23:38] to save you
[1:23:40] can you say man for it's not all about
[1:23:42] all of that that is just a form of
[1:23:44] religion
[1:23:48] he says when I when I shall say to the
[1:23:50] righteous that he shall surely live if
[1:23:53] he trusts to his own righteousness and
[1:23:56] commit iniquity all is righteousness all
[1:23:58] everybody say all is righteousness shall
[1:24:01] not be remembered
[1:24:03] well out of all the righteousness that
[1:24:06] he he has within himself in the day of
[1:24:09] his iniquity shall not be remembered
[1:24:12] amen that he hath committed see but but
[1:24:15] for see uh shall not be remembered but
[1:24:18] for his iniquity that he committed and
[1:24:20] he shall die for it ain't that right so
[1:24:24] there is no appeal Before the Throne of
[1:24:26] God that we can make of our own
[1:24:28] righteousness ain't that right amen so
[1:24:31] again leading Us in the paths of
[1:24:33] righteousness don't you think it's your
[1:24:35] righteousness that's that's doing this
[1:24:37] he's not leading Us in the paths of our
[1:24:40] own righteousness he's he is righteous
[1:24:43] Isaiah 64 and 6 we are all as un as an
[1:24:48] unclean thing and all our righteousness
[1:24:50] are as filthy rags and we all do fate as
[1:24:54] a leaf and our iniquities like the wind
[1:24:57] have taken us away
[1:24:59] now if you look at the law of Moses it
[1:25:02] brought about a self-righteousness
[1:25:04] and the law came about because the
[1:25:07] people wanted something that they could
[1:25:08] do themselves
[1:25:10] so they tried to be holy without the
[1:25:12] power of Holiness a man they tried to
[1:25:15] Love Without The Power of Love they
[1:25:17] tried to be reconciled to God without
[1:25:19] the power of reconciliation uh or
[1:25:22] without the atonement amen they tried to
[1:25:25] to serve god without the power of of
[1:25:28] Revelation ain't that right amen and and
[1:25:32] and that's what it was but then after
[1:25:34] Jesus come and and and noticed after he
[1:25:37] had died he had resurrected now he talks
[1:25:39] to the church acts 1 and 8 but you shall
[1:25:43] receive power after that the Holy Ghost
[1:25:46] has come upon you ain't that right and
[1:25:49] what is the Holy Ghost we've we've
[1:25:51] talked about it he is the spirit of
[1:25:53] Truth which will lead and guide you into
[1:25:56] all truth so what is the one that's
[1:25:59] leading us into the paths of
[1:26:00] righteousness it's the holy ghost that
[1:26:04] is leading Us in the paths of
[1:26:05] righteousness the path of Truth the
[1:26:07] paths of the word of God Amen brother
[1:26:11] Brown said he will teach us he will
[1:26:13] guide us in other words he will reveal
[1:26:15] all righteousness to us
[1:26:20] isn't that wonderful
[1:26:21] he will reveal all righteousness to us
[1:26:28] John 6 45
[1:26:30] it is written in the in the prophets and
[1:26:33] they shall all
[1:26:35] be taught of God
[1:26:37] all shall be but who is that all Isaiah
[1:26:41] 54 13 explains it and all thy children
[1:26:45] shall be taught of the Lord
[1:26:47] see so the all of God are the children
[1:26:50] of God
[1:26:51] brother Brown said so the evidence of
[1:26:53] being a true child of God he whom the
[1:26:56] spirit has come upon and indwells is
[1:27:00] again set forth as one taught the word
[1:27:04] by the Holy Ghost
[1:27:05] can you say Amen he's the one that leads
[1:27:09] or teaches or Reveals All the paths of
[1:27:12] righteousness to us so this is not a
[1:27:16] form of religion we're not part of a
[1:27:18] form of religion taking our own ideas or
[1:27:21] taken this and taking that amen but we
[1:27:24] are as as Paul would say he that hath
[1:27:28] hath anointed us is the Holy Ghost we
[1:27:31] have an unction amen and that is the
[1:27:34] Holy Ghost ain't that right amen see so
[1:27:37] again the people uh have this form of
[1:27:40] godliness while denying amen the power
[1:27:44] of Revelation now that's what the
[1:27:46] prophet said you know now Peter I think
[1:27:48] it was Peter and Paul amen said that
[1:27:51] they would have a form of godliness
[1:27:52] denying the power thereof from such turn
[1:27:55] away amen and the prophet says it was
[1:27:58] the power of Revelation that they would
[1:28:00] deny in other words they would not allow
[1:28:03] him to lead them they were built upon
[1:28:05] their own self-righteous they would take
[1:28:07] a Creed they had rather take a Dogma
[1:28:09] they'd take their own opinion of it
[1:28:11] instead of the Holy Ghost leading them
[1:28:14] can you say amen that's right see and so
[1:28:18] today people are just as Israel did they
[1:28:21] want something they can do themselves
[1:28:25] a man joins a church and by that he
[1:28:28] considers himself a Christian
[1:28:30] a man puts his name on the roll and by
[1:28:33] that he deems himself a Christian he
[1:28:38] pays his tithes and offerings and by
[1:28:40] that he thinks himself the Christian he
[1:28:42] he prays three times a day and by that
[1:28:45] he he he's ready for heaven
[1:28:50] all right
[1:28:51] then you look at the woman she wears a
[1:28:54] long hair
[1:28:55] and deems herself a Christian
[1:28:58] she doesn't wear the Rings she places
[1:28:59] you know or Pierce her ears like the
[1:29:01] other women do so she considerselves a
[1:29:04] Christian
[1:29:05] she doesn't wear the pants and the
[1:29:07] britches and the shorts like everyone
[1:29:08] else does so she considers herself a
[1:29:11] Christian
[1:29:14] but do you realize you can do sir God's
[1:29:16] service without it being his will
[1:29:19] and you say man and that's exactly what
[1:29:21] David did he should have consulted the
[1:29:24] prophet of God first before he acted I
[1:29:26] imagine
[1:29:27] can you say Amen now you know the
[1:29:30] prophet says it and if you've read it at
[1:29:32] all that women was sometimes Satan can
[1:29:35] jump on a spirit can jump on a woman
[1:29:37] where she get long hair and gets
[1:29:38] prideful about it
[1:29:41] God didn't tell us to tell you women
[1:29:42] sisters to wear your long hair so I can
[1:29:44] get proud about it and think you're
[1:29:47] better than somebody else
[1:29:49] it's fulfilling all righteousness
[1:29:51] amen and how many people do it without a
[1:29:54] revelation of what they're doing
[1:29:56] can you say amen that's exactly right
[1:29:58] God doesn't want you doing things
[1:30:00] without revelation
[1:30:03] it's true
[1:30:06] see it becomes a form
[1:30:08] amen just just a form of godliness
[1:30:11] a man see and so people are doing the
[1:30:13] exact same thing that David did God sent
[1:30:16] us a prophet
[1:30:19] and the people have bypassed it
[1:30:23] doing their own thing
[1:30:25] don't tell me that we're the only
[1:30:26] Holiness group there is
[1:30:28] there's apostolics that got more more uh
[1:30:32] uh convictions at what we would have
[1:30:36] amen don't believe in the Beards don't
[1:30:38] believe in certain colors don't believe
[1:30:39] in long or short sleeves don't believe
[1:30:41] in sideburns don't believe this and
[1:30:43] don't believe that amen they've got all
[1:30:45] kinds of ideas
[1:30:47] and yet through it all they've never
[1:30:49] consulted a prophet about it
[1:30:53] and we've got people in the message
[1:30:54] doing the same thing
[1:30:56] they tell us wearing a necklace is wrong
[1:30:58] you can't do this and you can't do that
[1:31:00] and you can't they're trying to strip
[1:31:01] you everything without consulting a
[1:31:03] profit but you go listen to a prophet
[1:31:06] he tells you how to wear a necklace he
[1:31:10] tells you how to conduct yourself
[1:31:13] can you say amen he knows what to do
[1:31:16] people say well you can't listen to what
[1:31:18] he does in his family life I beg to
[1:31:20] differ with you I ain't gonna listen to
[1:31:22] you
[1:31:24] I'd rather listen to what he did I'd
[1:31:26] rather look at how he led his family he
[1:31:29] led his family and the angel of the Lord
[1:31:31] must have been pleased with it because
[1:31:32] the angel of the Lord came to him
[1:31:36] can you say Amen
[1:31:38] that's exactly right it's not about form
[1:31:40] of religion it's about a revelation and
[1:31:43] the Revelation comes through a prophet
[1:31:50] and you say Amen
[1:31:52] see they want to do their own religious
[1:31:54] thing
[1:31:55] they got these legalist spirits on them
[1:31:57] coming into the message then they got
[1:31:58] these these disgraceful spirits that
[1:32:01] coming in the message
[1:32:02] they'll either make a disgrace out of
[1:32:04] Grace or they'll make it or where there
[1:32:05] ain't no Grace at all
[1:32:07] to where they're the ones that's
[1:32:09] dictating the people
[1:32:11] yeah
[1:32:12] can you say Amen that it's not matter
[1:32:15] how holy you are because you could have
[1:32:17] a Holiness and to be a
[1:32:18] self-righteousness
[1:32:20] but we have come to fulfill all
[1:32:22] righteousness
[1:32:25] every promise in This Book Is Ours
[1:32:32] they bypass the prophet
[1:32:36] and go after serving God on their own
[1:32:39] opinion
[1:32:40] or some other man's opinion
[1:32:43] but I'll tell you what I'll take a
[1:32:45] prophet's opinion over your opinion any
[1:32:47] day
[1:32:50] can you say Amen
[1:32:51] but what they're doing they're
[1:32:53] fulfilling the prophecy for this day
[1:32:54] blind wretched miserable naked and don't
[1:32:58] know it that's the problem they don't
[1:33:00] know it they've got a form of religion
[1:33:02] oh yeah they cannot they can out pray
[1:33:04] they can out uh uh look at they can out
[1:33:07] they can outperform any day amen but
[1:33:10] they're blind or wretched miserable and
[1:33:13] they don't know it because they do it
[1:33:14] without a revelation
[1:33:19] oh that's all right
[1:33:22] brother Brown said even their mental
[1:33:24] faculties are gone they're spiritual
[1:33:26] faculties of mental spiritual
[1:33:27] understanding
[1:33:29] he says the holy spirit is to lead you
[1:33:31] into all truth
[1:33:33] and I was just listening to him today
[1:33:35] and we talked about it before about the
[1:33:37] the the way there there's a highway and
[1:33:40] brother Brown says and most ministers
[1:33:42] say about that Highway the highway we're
[1:33:44] walking the highway he submit brother It
[1:33:46] also says there's a way and that way is
[1:33:49] in the middle of the highway and that's
[1:33:52] where Holiness is that's where the bride
[1:33:54] is standing that washes all the trash
[1:33:57] off over on this side and that side
[1:33:59] she's staying right in the middle of the
[1:34:01] road
[1:34:02] foreign
[1:34:03] can you say Amen
[1:34:05] see the holy spirit is to lead you into
[1:34:08] all truth reveal these things to you he
[1:34:11] leadeth Us in the paths of righteousness
[1:34:14] hmm
[1:34:15] Hallelujah
[1:34:17] and he says and the modern Church hates
[1:34:19] that
[1:34:21] he said the people of today is choosing
[1:34:23] a modern denomination and it only
[1:34:25] reflects their poor understanding of the
[1:34:28] word
[1:34:29] that just blows my mind that people come
[1:34:32] in the message and and and and and they
[1:34:34] will choose a man to bring in
[1:34:41] Pentecostal age ideas
[1:34:44] they'll bring in Charles Stanley ideas
[1:34:47] [Music]
[1:34:49] hello
[1:34:51] they'll bring in uh uh the spurgeon's
[1:34:55] ideas they'll bring in Moody's ideas
[1:34:58] they'll bring it all in and mix it all
[1:35:00] up you understand what I'm saying amen
[1:35:03] see so they're choosing I I just believe
[1:35:05] that if God sent a prophet to restore
[1:35:08] the word that's all we need
[1:35:11] are you with me now that's all we need
[1:35:14] he can tell you how to live he can tell
[1:35:16] you how to walk he can tell you how to
[1:35:18] talk he can tell you how to conduct your
[1:35:20] family your home your church your
[1:35:22] marriage your children he can do it all
[1:35:25] amen it's the truth he's leading Us in
[1:35:27] the paths of righteousness
[1:35:35] really Brown said instead of
[1:35:36] Spirit-filled men in the church who were
[1:35:39] led by a spirit-given revelation
[1:35:42] foreign
[1:35:43] there are now Creeds and bylaws and the
[1:35:46] educated guesses of educated men
[1:35:49] he knows how to put it don't he
[1:35:51] learning has taken the place of
[1:35:53] Revelation
[1:35:54] reason has replaced faith
[1:35:58] program has replaced spontaneous praise
[1:36:01] in the Holy Ghost
[1:36:03] but notice brother Brown describes the
[1:36:05] Church of the Living God
[1:36:07] he said my heart's desire is to meet the
[1:36:10] church which he has died foreclosed in
[1:36:13] the righteousness of his own blood
[1:36:15] dressed in his word and the
[1:36:18] righteousness of his word for his word
[1:36:21] cannot fail
[1:36:23] can you say man
[1:36:25] that's exactly what he's saying the
[1:36:27] church is going to be
[1:36:29] it's going to be a church that will not
[1:36:31] be clothed in a Dogma it won't be
[1:36:33] clothed in whatever amen as Adam did he
[1:36:36] took his own self he took on
[1:36:38] self-righteousness right he presented
[1:36:41] himself in the clothes that he had
[1:36:43] designed that he had made himself and
[1:36:45] God rejected it amen and in the presence
[1:36:48] of God he had to hide amen because the
[1:36:51] wrath of God the only thing that saved
[1:36:53] Adam was God provided a blood and not
[1:36:57] only a blood and got covering
[1:37:01] you understand that the lamb bled for
[1:37:04] Adam
[1:37:05] but then God took the skin of that lamb
[1:37:09] and dressed Adam
[1:37:10] and it's the bloody bleeding word that
[1:37:12] bled it's the word that bled for you
[1:37:14] amen and now God has taken his word and
[1:37:17] dressing you
[1:37:21] brother Brown said I hope he will Crown
[1:37:22] my Ministry of this of letting me take
[1:37:25] the clothes of the word and dress his
[1:37:26] bride in the clothe of the word and for
[1:37:29] his righteousness do you believe that's
[1:37:31] brother branham's Ministry I just
[1:37:33] believe that is amen that God you would
[1:37:35] take that Prophet amen and put the
[1:37:38] desire in there because that's exactly
[1:37:40] what his purpose was to do amen a church
[1:37:42] that would be found naked miserable
[1:37:45] blind and naked but then there would be
[1:37:47] his church God's church amen that would
[1:37:50] be found clothed in the righteousness of
[1:37:52] his word amen because God would have a
[1:37:55] bride or a Prophet come with the word of
[1:37:57] God and dress her
[1:38:01] you see she's not just observing of
[1:38:03] promises
[1:38:06] she's working righteousness
[1:38:09] fulfilling righteousness
[1:38:12] that's okay
[1:38:15] but notice what Paul said in Romans 10 4
[1:38:17] breaking in Christ
[1:38:19] is the end of the law for righteousness
[1:38:22] to everyone that believeth
[1:38:25] so no longer by the law do we live for
[1:38:28] righteousness
[1:38:30] do we become righteous
[1:38:32] do we seek to be righteous
[1:38:34] Christ
[1:38:36] is the end of that
[1:38:38] he is our righteousness
[1:38:40] can you say Amen
[1:38:42] he is our righteousness and he has come
[1:38:44] in this day his blood is the voice that
[1:38:48] is speaking upon our behalf and he's
[1:38:51] clotheing Us in the righteousness of his
[1:38:53] word so the only way that a man could be
[1:38:56] righteous is by believing Christ and he
[1:38:59] is the word now notice Romans 3 and 21
[1:39:02] but now the righteousness of God without
[1:39:06] the law is manifested being witnessed by
[1:39:10] the law and the prophets even the
[1:39:12] righteousness of God which is by faith
[1:39:15] of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all
[1:39:19] them that believe aren't you glad for
[1:39:22] that we've read the scripture many times
[1:39:24] you've read it but where Paul says if
[1:39:27] any man be in Christ he is a new
[1:39:29] creature or a new creation old things
[1:39:33] are passed away and behold all things
[1:39:35] are become new ain't that right being in
[1:39:39] Christ and by only only by one Spirit
[1:39:41] can you be baptized into the body of
[1:39:45] Christ and it's not a water baptism it's
[1:39:48] a spirit baptism that's right see amen
[1:39:52] see so now look at this as we get ready
[1:39:54] to close first John 2 29 if you know
[1:39:58] that he is righteous
[1:40:01] you know that everyone that doeth or
[1:40:04] fulfilleth
[1:40:05] righteousness is born of him
[1:40:09] not born of the church but born of him
[1:40:13] if you know that he is righteous how
[1:40:16] many believes he's righteous
[1:40:18] then you know that everyone that doeth
[1:40:21] righteousness not has the form of
[1:40:23] godliness
[1:40:24] not having a self-righteousness but he
[1:40:27] that doeth righteousness is born of him
[1:40:31] begotten ain't that right amen see so
[1:40:35] for a person to fulfill righteousness
[1:40:36] shows that he is born of God First John
[1:40:39] 3 and 10 it says whosoever doeth not
[1:40:43] righteousness is not of God
[1:40:47] again many forms of religion
[1:40:50] a form of godliness
[1:40:52] producing self-righteousness and yet
[1:40:56] that doesn't count to God
[1:40:59] whosoever doeth not righteousness is not
[1:41:02] of God ain't that right
[1:41:05] so we read the scripture I read it again
[1:41:08] and he that doeth or fulfilleth
[1:41:11] righteousness is righteous even as he is
[1:41:14] righteous
[1:41:15] now Hebrews 11 4 it says by faith
[1:41:19] everybody say by faith Abel offered
[1:41:22] notice he's he's doing something he's in
[1:41:25] action
[1:41:28] Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice
[1:41:32] than Cain by which he obtained witness
[1:41:36] that he was righteous
[1:41:40] I think that's awesome that's a powerful
[1:41:42] scripture right there
[1:41:45] he offered by faith he offered unto God
[1:41:48] a more excellent sacrifice and came by
[1:41:51] which he obtained witness that he was
[1:41:54] righteous
[1:41:56] now brother Brad I'm in speaking of Abel
[1:41:59] and Cain said both of them religious
[1:42:01] both of them anointed both of them
[1:42:04] Desiring life and both worshiping the
[1:42:07] same God
[1:42:10] but Abel did something that was
[1:42:12] different than Cain did
[1:42:15] he fulfilled everybody say he fulfilled
[1:42:18] the will of God
[1:42:20] he fulfilled the will of God
[1:42:24] in other words he fulfilled the
[1:42:27] righteousness for his day
[1:42:31] and he couldn't have done that
[1:42:34] brother Brown said he couldn't have done
[1:42:36] that
[1:42:37] if it hadn't been revealed to him
[1:42:41] right
[1:42:42] but by faith he offered a more excellent
[1:42:45] sacrifice than did Cain which showed
[1:42:48] that what he did was revealed to him
[1:42:54] he did it by faith it wasn't just a form
[1:42:56] of religion
[1:42:58] he did it by faith
[1:43:01] which showed that what he did was
[1:43:03] revealed to him it wasn't his own
[1:43:06] thinking
[1:43:09] ain't that right
[1:43:10] brother Brown said see
[1:43:12] Cain and Abel Come To Worship
[1:43:15] but Cain
[1:43:16] come before the Lord in class
[1:43:20] Style
[1:43:22] but Abel came in righteousness by
[1:43:25] revelation
[1:43:28] you see when you come to church you're
[1:43:30] coming to God in righteousness
[1:43:32] by revelation
[1:43:34] and we're that group of people that the
[1:43:36] book has been open to
[1:43:38] we're in this land of of of open book
[1:43:42] all the promises are being made known to
[1:43:45] us
[1:43:46] we're not just sitting twiddling our
[1:43:48] thumbs and guessing and probing that
[1:43:50] that that's all over with
[1:43:52] we are now in the land of an open book
[1:43:55] and the promises the veil has been torn
[1:43:58] to where we can now clearly see
[1:44:05] you notice the paths of righteousness is
[1:44:08] the path of the just
[1:44:11] proverbs 4 18 the path of the justice as
[1:44:14] The Shining Light that shineth more and
[1:44:16] more into the perfect day
[1:44:18] the path of the just
[1:44:21] is as a Shining Light
[1:44:24] now remember I believe it's the psalmist
[1:44:26] said Thy word is the light my my light
[1:44:28] right so the word is the light that path
[1:44:32] is the light the others that walk in the
[1:44:33] other path we talked about it they're
[1:44:35] walking in the path of darkness and they
[1:44:37] stumble and they know not what at what
[1:44:40] ain't that right so the path he leadeth
[1:44:43] me in the paths of righteousness to just
[1:44:46] walking in the path of light
[1:44:49] and that light is shining more and
[1:44:51] brighter and brighter
[1:44:53] it's
[1:44:55] uh uh
[1:44:58] I I don't know is is it the song This is
[1:45:01] the evening time where it talks about
[1:45:03] the light has never been shining like it
[1:45:05] has been in this day I can't remember
[1:45:06] what song that is but we sing it the
[1:45:09] path of the just but notice it is
[1:45:12] written the just everybody say the just
[1:45:15] shall live by faith
[1:45:17] the just shall live by faith
[1:45:20] Abel offered by faith
[1:45:24] the just shall worship by faith
[1:45:26] can you say Amen the just shall amen by
[1:45:30] faith
[1:45:31] the just shall worship by faith amen the
[1:45:34] just shall come to church by faith
[1:45:36] the just shall read every Promise by
[1:45:39] faith but just shall claim the Promises
[1:45:41] by faith
[1:45:43] you understand what I'm saying that just
[1:45:45] shall live by faith any promise that you
[1:45:48] have is by faith you ain't gonna get it
[1:45:51] any other way you'll get your healing by
[1:45:52] faith you'll get your deliverance by
[1:45:54] faith every promise comes to you by
[1:45:56] faith
[1:45:58] ain't that right so by faith Abel
[1:46:01] offered a more excellent Sacrifice by
[1:46:03] faith know what built an art by faith
[1:46:05] Abraham left his own land his kin and
[1:46:09] looked for a city whose Builder and
[1:46:11] maker was God they've done it all by
[1:46:13] faith and notice what the prophet said
[1:46:15] faith is a revelation of the will of God
[1:46:19] favor so the just shall live by faith
[1:46:26] oh I hope it making sense to you
[1:46:29] the judge shall live by faith
[1:46:32] not form of religion
[1:46:35] sisters your Holiness is not a form of
[1:46:37] religion to you
[1:46:39] you're doing it by faith because it's
[1:46:41] revealed to you
[1:46:44] our worship is not just a form of
[1:46:46] religion to us we're doing it by faith
[1:46:49] for we realize it's been revealed the
[1:46:51] will of God has been revealed to us
[1:46:55] people say oh they're dancing they just
[1:46:57] get emotional now I don't understand
[1:46:58] there's people that do that then that's
[1:47:00] a form of religion
[1:47:05] but you forget
[1:47:06] that there is a scripture speaking of
[1:47:09] our day
[1:47:10] that when the lamb came and opened the
[1:47:12] book
[1:47:15] they were screaming there was shouting
[1:47:18] Prophet said John must have gotten to
[1:47:20] side himself
[1:47:23] did he not why something was revealed to
[1:47:26] him his name
[1:47:29] and he represented the bride of Christ
[1:47:31] for this day our worship is not a form
[1:47:34] of religion it's not a form of godliness
[1:47:37] it's a revelation to us
[1:47:42] so they fulfilled righteousness by
[1:47:44] fulfilling the revealed word for their
[1:47:47] age what had been revealed to them they
[1:47:49] fulfilled it
[1:47:51] therefore they fulfilled all
[1:47:53] righteousness
[1:47:54] for their age
[1:47:57] amen and Abel showed he was righteous by
[1:48:01] fulfilling righteousness
[1:48:03] and we are righteous through Jesus
[1:48:06] Christ and to show that we are righteous
[1:48:08] we are fulfilling all righteousness that
[1:48:12] are spoke of this age
[1:48:14] I hope ain't born you
[1:48:16] appreciate your pull
[1:48:18] I'm going to close
[1:48:20] but I want to get down to you
[1:48:22] we are to fulfill everybody say we are
[1:48:25] to fulfill
[1:48:26] the revealed word
[1:48:28] for our age
[1:48:30] don't don't don't don't bypass that
[1:48:33] profit because you won't know what the
[1:48:34] revealed word is
[1:48:35] don't don't look at anything else cause
[1:48:38] they can't lead you in the paths of
[1:48:39] righteousness
[1:48:40] can you say amen amen better prophet's
[1:48:43] message has opened up the land to us and
[1:48:46] we can now know what is expected of us
[1:48:48] and what every promise it ain't about
[1:48:50] rules of do's and don'ts it's about the
[1:48:52] quickening power of God coming upon the
[1:48:54] church
[1:48:57] now notice we fulfilled the revealed
[1:49:00] word for our age brother Brown said the
[1:49:02] beginning of righteousness is God's
[1:49:04] revealed truth
[1:49:07] see it's not forms of religion it's not
[1:49:10] forms of godliness
[1:49:12] it's the power of Revelation that has
[1:49:15] brought the righteousness to us
[1:49:17] righteousness at the beginning of
[1:49:19] righteousness is God's revealed truth
[1:49:22] and the entire Church of the Living God
[1:49:25] is built upon that
[1:49:27] not Creeds not dogmas not whatever else
[1:49:34] Jesus said blessed are they that hunger
[1:49:36] and thirst after righteousness they
[1:49:37] shall be filled
[1:49:39] brother Brown says it this way he just
[1:49:41] knows how to put it blessed are they
[1:49:42] that are Hunger and thirsting to know
[1:49:44] righteousness
[1:49:45] and they shall be filled
[1:49:48] are you hungering to know you're
[1:49:50] thirsting to know and your food and
[1:49:52] drink comes from the revealed word of
[1:49:54] God
[1:49:57] that's how you you're hungering to know
[1:49:59] you're thirsting to know how is that
[1:50:02] thirst and hunger quenched the word of
[1:50:04] God
[1:50:06] so he leads me in the paths of his word
[1:50:10] Paths of righteousness the Apostle Paul
[1:50:12] called it the word of righteousness
[1:50:14] and that word was ordained before the
[1:50:16] foundation of the world
[1:50:18] Isaiah 46 9 remember the former things
[1:50:21] of old for I am God and there is none
[1:50:23] else I am God and there is none like me
[1:50:26] declaring the end from the beginning
[1:50:29] and from ancient times the uh the things
[1:50:32] that are not yet done oh my so this
[1:50:35] Bible is the plan of God it's the
[1:50:37] purpose of God written out in in letter
[1:50:41] form ain't that right but notice Jesus
[1:50:44] being the Living Word of God for he was
[1:50:47] the word made flesh he knew what was
[1:50:50] written of him to do ain't that right so
[1:50:53] the prophet said every word that was
[1:50:56] wrote of that Messiah was fulfilled to
[1:50:59] the letter
[1:51:00] now his bride will fulfill everything
[1:51:04] that's in the New Testament why she is
[1:51:08] the word Bride of the word groom
[1:51:13] that's right
[1:51:15] in these six thousand years after the
[1:51:18] fall
[1:51:21] God has only made two masterpieces
[1:51:27] and that's Christ the bridegroom
[1:51:32] and today
[1:51:37] he's come to the finale
[1:51:40] of his second Masterpiece which is the
[1:51:42] bride the church
[1:51:45] the bride of Christ
[1:51:48] you see the first Masterpiece was
[1:51:51] finished when the fullness of God dwelt
[1:51:53] bodily in Christ
[1:51:55] and today the second Masterpiece is
[1:51:57] completed
[1:52:00] for the same God that was in Christ is
[1:52:02] now in fullness in his church
[1:52:05] right
[1:52:07] now brother Brown said now if he was the
[1:52:09] Messiah by being in the anointed one for
[1:52:12] that day to fulfill the word of God to
[1:52:14] be the Redeemer and the anointed one and
[1:52:15] God raised up that body
[1:52:17] his bride is Anointed is the anointed
[1:52:21] one for this day
[1:52:22] it's already raised with him in the
[1:52:24] resurrection because these two are one
[1:52:27] speaking of this adoption
[1:52:30] he says the powers that was in Christ
[1:52:32] has been given to his church all that
[1:52:35] God was he poured into Christ and Christ
[1:52:37] was God manifested on Earth and all that
[1:52:40] Christ was he poured into his church and
[1:52:42] all the powers that God had rested in
[1:52:44] Christ and the fullness of Christ now
[1:52:47] rests in his church
[1:52:52] so he says the last thing that the
[1:52:54] church is going to see is Christ
[1:52:55] manifested in his power in fullness in
[1:52:58] his church just before the fire falls
[1:53:01] and church were here
[1:53:05] we're here
[1:53:10] the word has prophesied of these
[1:53:12] organizations that we have today and the
[1:53:15] curses upon them
[1:53:17] but the prophet said the word has also
[1:53:19] prophesied of the things that would take
[1:53:21] place by his truly anointed Church
[1:53:25] why
[1:53:27] for the church is a word bride
[1:53:30] and she will have the word
[1:53:32] and brother Brian said here we are
[1:53:36] aren't you glad for that
[1:53:38] as the musicians come
[1:53:41] can you lift your hands and just Worship
[1:53:43] the Lord
[1:53:44] isn't the Lord just wonderful
[1:53:46] here we are
[1:53:48] we're here at church
[1:53:52] these Paths of righteousness that we're
[1:53:54] walking in it's the promises of God
[1:53:58] that was late dormant for years and
[1:54:00] years and now here you are not just
[1:54:02] observing
[1:54:04] but you're right in the middle of the
[1:54:06] land
[1:54:07] Hallelujah
[1:54:09] the power is in you the authority is in
[1:54:11] you
[1:54:12] everything that Christ was is in this
[1:54:16] church
[1:54:17] here we are
[1:54:19] and brother Brown said those in the
[1:54:21] bride do only his will
[1:54:23] no one can make them do otherwise they
[1:54:26] have thus saith the Lord if they keep
[1:54:28] still they know that it has to be God in
[1:54:32] them doing the works for feeling his own
[1:54:35] word
[1:54:36] he did not complete all his work while
[1:54:38] he was while in his Earthly Ministry so
[1:54:41] now he works in and through the bride
[1:54:45] she knows that for it was not yet time
[1:54:48] for him to do certain things that he
[1:54:50] must now do but he now will fulfill
[1:54:53] through the bride
[1:54:56] that work which he left
[1:54:59] for this specific time
[1:55:01] all do you love him
[1:55:03] I'm so glad that it's just not a form of
[1:55:06] religion to us
[1:55:10] Hallelujah
[1:55:11] it's the spirit of God that's leading us
[1:55:15] into the paths of his word
[1:55:17] amen what song
[1:55:20] there's never been a day
[1:55:25] like this day
[1:55:28] to me

[1:55:35] like this day
[1:55:39] [Music]

[1:56:36] oh sing it again there's
[1:56:41] ever been a day
[1:56:45] like this day
[1:56:47] to me

[1:57:15] as they just play Softly
[1:57:18] I couldn't help but as we me and Ruth
[1:57:21] was coming to service tonight
[1:57:26] we didn't see the Sun but we saw just
[1:57:29] the beauty that it reflected through the
[1:57:31] clouds
[1:57:32] the color is just just just beautiful
[1:57:36] that sounds that you know
[1:57:39] sweetheart that the sun is just nothing
[1:57:41] but a ball of Fire
[1:57:44] stuff fire but it lights everything up
[1:57:50] and I don't know just simple but it just
[1:57:52] kind of struck me but I thought and God
[1:57:55] would rise and make that sun just like
[1:57:58] that to to symbolize himself
[1:58:01] the Bible says that God is light and
[1:58:03] he's a consuming fire
[1:58:06] that I thought it was on the day of
[1:58:07] Pentecost that licks of fire fell up on
[1:58:10] that 120.
[1:58:13] I thought oh my
[1:58:15] foreign
[1:58:16] [Music]
[1:58:36] and that little lick of deity that fire
[1:58:39] burning is now coming inside of us
[1:58:41] consuming everything that's not locking
[1:58:45] and I thought oh as these clouds and as
[1:58:47] these skies are reflecting the Sun
[1:58:50] I just couldn't help but be thankful
[1:58:52] that I God would choose me to reflect
[1:58:55] him
[1:58:56] and the beauty and the radiance of his
[1:58:59] glory and his righteousness
[1:59:02] and God would reflect you all or choose
[1:59:04] you all to reflect
[1:59:06] can you imagine living in this world
[1:59:10] and we are reflecting
[1:59:14] himself
[1:59:16] the radiance the beauty
[1:59:20] the rainbow is just a reflection of the
[1:59:24] Sun

[1:59:38] reflecting through us the seven colors
[1:59:41] of God
