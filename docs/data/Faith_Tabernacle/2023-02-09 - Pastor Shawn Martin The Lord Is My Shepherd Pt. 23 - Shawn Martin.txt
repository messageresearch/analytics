and we sure love brother Walker very much and so if you don't mind just really keeping him sister Sue in your prayer he he definitely needs it um this evening praise the Lord but before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to the Lord father indeed we love you we thank you Lord we just can't love you enough we can't express in words how we feel in our heart towards you that father we just pray Lord that you just take our lives and use it For Your Glory Lord may you have just complete control and father let you get the honor let you get the praise oh God for we're here to serve you father and I pray that you would just move in a special way this evening you know every need that is present father and you know how to meet those needs Lord as you said in your word you sent your word and healed them of all their diseases and there's power in the word of God we've seen it happen how the word would just break the Fetters off the people and bring Deliverance we've seen the blind eyes come open just by the preaching of the Gospel we've seen things that take place just by Your Word going forth and the people just believe in it and may it be so tonight every question every thing that is maybe bothering your people may you just come through your word and and and and set free heal deliver oh God that you may have Glory and Honor we ask these things in your precious name Jesus Christ and the church says amen amen we look in here at the Psalms the 23rd chapter and starting at the first verse the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures I've got an echo oh you're you're just fine brother Joe I just I I just don't like to hear myself preach no you're fine so second verse he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his namesake amen you can have your seats this evening a man and uh I want to I guess just continue uh with the title the Lord is my shepherd been on it for a little while but uh and I and I thinking of that he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness and it you know we we've talked about the the the the two paths the Broadway uh and the narrow way and and how that the Broadway leads to destruction and many there be that that follow this path and uh then the the other path the narrow way uh lead us to life and few there be few there be that that follow this path and so uh we we know that this narrow path is is a path of Life David calls it the path of life and and and and and here in the psalm 16 11 that would show me that will show me and or we'll put it this way that will reveal to me the the the path of life so so the path of life is not mistakenly found it's it's revealed it has to be revealed uh uh to those that will walk this path and so a few there be that that follow or walk on this path amen and so therefore uh uh David uh tells us uh well I I'm gonna put it in in my way of thinking that it's the Lord that reveals it to us for for David said the Lord is my shepherd and and he leadeth me he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness and so all throughout the Bible it talks about a path and and so I believe that these Paths of righteousness is the same path it's a path of life it's a narrow path it's it's a path that that there's blessings in that path but the Lord is the one that leads us in in these paths you believe that and so now brother Branham he he said now you have to have a guide you have to have a guide if you don't know where you're going and so this is why that that we have to have the Lord as our Shepherd to lead us in these Paths of righteousness and and he says now you don't have to have a guide uh uh to lead you down the Broadway that's what Brad Graham says you you don't have to have a God he said you know all the alleys and everything else else you know all the way to sin you you know all about every sin there is to know you know all the shortcuts you know you you've been around a long time see so you don't need a guide uh uh to take you down this this broad way and and there's no need of somebody telling you about that path no one has to teach you how to steal this is what he's saying now there no one has to teach you how to steal no one has to teach you how to lie no one has to teach you how to commit adultery no one has to teach you how to curse no one has to teach you how to do these evil things because you you know all about that we were born in sin shaped in iniquity coming to this world speaking lies and uh conceived in sin so so we we know all about this and brother Brown said it's posted on he said everywhere on every tree amen if you want to learn about Sin if you're amen I mean even even just a little stage uh uh you know take take it your your little babies and and how they start throwing the temper tantrum and we even when they begin to speak amen they begin to speak lies and and they'll they'll bite and and they'll hit and at a little Age and and these things because that's that that you they don't need a guide to tell them about this that old carnal nature is is this way but the Lord is my shepherd amen so so he's wanting to take us away from that broad way and bring us into a narrow way that that we don't know nothing about and and so the Lord is my shepherd He leads me in the paths of righteousness so we need a God do you believe that we we need a guide um you know I I thought of this as Joshua you know we we talked about Joshua last weekend and his ministry versus uh Moses's Menace history but but Joshua told told Israel as they were fixing to go over into the promised land uh uh there in Joshua 3 and 3. he said when you see the Ark of the Covenant uh of the Lord your God and the priests that uh the Levites bearing it then you shall remove from your place and go after it now now remember that when you see the Ark of the Covenant so then then we know that the the what what is the Ark of the Covenant the word ain't that right amen don't follow nothing else but the word amen and so he says when you see the word amen begin to go then you follow after don't get ahead of the word don't get beside the word that you follow after the word ain't that right and he said yet there shall be a space between you and it about 2 000 cubits by measure come not near unto it see let it be the priests amen uh uh uh bearing that word don't come near it that you may know the way by which you must go ain't that right amen for you have not passed this way uh uh heretofore in other words you you ain't been this way before amen so God would set a guide for the children of Israel and that would be the word of God Amen and the word of God would take them into the promised land because they hadn't been there and they needed a god ain't that right a man so the word was their guide or we could we could uh identify it as the spirit of Truth amen because you remember when Joshua he didn't know what them tell the names of them tribes meant but uh uh Yet brother Brown told us that uh uh when the mothers were given birth to the children they they would place them in the promise land while they were in travail years before they got to the promised land and and they would call their name and their name men a uh a certain position uh in the in the promised land and so they didn't know what their name meant Joshua didn't even know what their name meant but the spirit of Truth was with them amen and and it began to be revealed by to Joshua and Joshua would set each tribe in the in the land ain't that rhyme a man so so we we find a man that there was the spirit of Truth the word uh remember the Book of Joshua parallels the book of Ephesians and brother Branham said the Book of Joshua should be called the book of Ephesians of the Old Testament so so we know where we positionally stand that we are in the Ephesus again at the book of Ephesians is is a book of positioning it's it's dealing with our placing is dealing with our adoption it's it's dealing with what we are in the word of God and it's all predestination ain't that right amen the book of Grace the and that's what Joshua's Ministry was was the ministry of Grace amen so today as we we understanding now that we are in an Ephesus again a positioning and as Israel the natural people needed a God so do we need a guide as well see and so uh uh now it it came time uh for for uh the church amen uh to cross over into the promised land we we are we are at a place and and I hope you understand exactly where the position that the Church of the Living God is at right now we are I and and I'm gonna have to say it this way I believe we've crossed we've crossed across the into the promised land we are in the promised land amen and and and remember it was only in the promised land that everything that God had predestinated for them in that land now become a reality they were no longer talking about it long no longer prophesying about it no longer uh singing about it and dreaming about it and longing for it it was now right there before them ain't that right but they needed to God they had to have a guide to take them into the land hey can you say amen and so we have never been this way before do you believe that if you go listen to the guide or and I believe it's the god brother Branham tells us we've never have been this way before you can look at history and you can say that through all of history there's the church today has never been this way before can you say Amen Paul waited for the manifestation of son of God they talked about it they talked about the Rapture they talked about adoption they talked about all uh uh the church coming back into a Oneness amen and being the the the the body or the fullness of him that filleth all in all and here we are in this day they talked about it but I'm telling you we're not prophesying about it we're not dreaming about it amen but I'm telling you young people I'm telling you parents and your preachers and myself we are there in the land can you say man and we've never been this way before so brother Brown says don't you don't don't travel your denominational Roots now stay right behind the word can you say man amen don't don't follow Pentecostal Traditions don't follow what they done in the Pentecostal age amen because it's going to bring you a bunch of confusion ain't that right stay behind the word ain't that right stay behind the word he says because you've never you haven't passed this way before so another place he says here we are right everything right at the door and the people still following after their Creed he said you better stay behind the word the word will lead you across don't be led by Sensations don't be led by visitations don't be led by amen some Supernatural power or some Supernatural thing out there you remember this Satan can transform himself into an angel of Light just as much as anything else he can impersonate just as good as the bad the rest of them can you say amen amen that's exactly right so he says stay you better stay behind the word for the word will lead you cross amen he said because the word is Christ and Christ is God and God is the Holy Ghost so stay behind the word oh yes sir stay with that God everybody say stay with that God Amen now that's a warning for you and I remember he knew I believe he knew he was going to leave amen and and and and and so or the Holy Spirit did anyways and here we are what's 50 60 years now as his brother Bradham and it has left the scene and it's gotten more crazier it's gotten more fanatical it's gotten more dangerous it's gotten more deceiving amen and yet we hear the voice of a prophet screaming out stay behind the words can you say man you don't need another Prophet to come do you amen with us saith the Lord just stay with the word that God restored unto you stay right behind that word can you say amen he said don't get in front of it you stay behind it let it lead you don't you lead it you let it go let him lead you can you say Amen see we know nothing about that road we know nothing and and I'll say it this way we know nothing about the paths of righteousness we've we've never in for our age we've never been this way before so see you're you're you're you're you're you're in a different land Church hey you understand what I'm saying you are in a different land that's exactly right see and uh then what's been down Through the Ages and so uh uh to the ones who have crossed over Jordan you are in a different land your surroundings are different don't you look at uh at church natural amen and say that's your surroundings no you're in a different land you can you say man amen don't look at science and all these other things and say oh and get come no no that's not your land you are in a different land where the blessings of God the promises of God and the things that were in the mind of God that has been hidden is now being revealed Amen to the church can you say amen I hope that makes sense to you amen but it's another land brother Brown said it's a Heavenly land and so he says you're born again Heaven he's born again you are born again so he says you are in the promised land amen yes sir so he says here you can look you know your way around he's talking about in the world now just just the world common Flesh and Blood Man uh woman boy girl he said you you know your way around here oh yes you know you know how to stand on a certain hand of cards and you know what the dice you know when it Rose what it means and everything like that but when it comes to nobody the Holiness and righteousness and the power of God and how the Holy Spirit operates and what it does you better stay right behind that word can you say man we're not just Faith Tabernacle we're not just your average Church goer amen we are people that were predestinated to a land that was predestinated for us the supernatural belongs to us the promises belong to us don't try to operate this Christian life amen based on a carnal mind and off your own works and all of these things you're in a different land stay behind the word can you say Amen you might be able to run a business good that don't you try to run the church like a business it takes the supernatural can you say Amen see you've never passed this way before so Jesus said those that pass this way now he's talking about the uh the the the the uh the narrow way the the the the the the the the paths of righteousness though Jesus said those that pass this way these signs will follow them ain't that right my name in my name they'll cast out Devils speak with new tongues or take up serpents or drink deadly things and it won't harm them if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover most of them refuse it and deny it and say it's not even inspired but they're not following the guide they're following a man-made Creed that you better stay right behind the word because you haven't passed this way can you say amen amen that not just any man is going to work the third pull amen this is something that's going to take a God to get us there and you've not passed this way so stay behind the word of God ain't that right so see so we we find Jesus said the works that I do shall you do also even greater than these shall you do ain't that right that's a promise and you're in the promised land and you've never done that before we've we've never come into that place of the greater word we've seen what a prophet done amen but now that them greater worse wasn't just applied to brother Branham it was applied to the Church of the Living God and he's brought us over into the promised land you've not gone this way before but don't you let unbelief amen discourage you from and don't you let the Giants take the take your faith away you stay behind the promise the word of God hey can you say Amen everything that Jesus Promised everything that this Bible promised for us today it's now reality because you're in the Promised Land ain't that Ryan amen so brother Branham says you'll come to church and you hear somebody raise up and hollered glory to God hallelujah why you'll say my goodness they never did that in my church I'll get up and walk out he said be careful stay behind the word stay behind the word and let the God lead you and then it's hard for people to believe in the Supernatural amen but stay behind the word hey hey Ryan see so we we find a man uh the trouble of it is brother Brown says the people that come to church they just said a few minutes and when something goes on that they're not used to they get up and walk out ain't that right he says another places I admire a little woman from a cold formal church just had prayer for her God's going to heal that little woman but she didn't understand this and she'd know nothing about it she'd come in and she said she didn't know but I told her come on and see me and she was kind of timid and backward but the guide kept telling her move on move on and he said she got it she got exactly what she needed because the God was leading her to it aren't you glad that God's been leading you it led us to the message did it not it's leading us see he says see it's because the holy spirit that guides us into these things it's it's the holy spirit that guides us now in Scripture that I want to look at is Psalms 32 and 8 and and I hope we've made sense so far that we need a guide but notice what the Bible says there God says it I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way that thou shalt go I will guide thee with mine I ain't that right and so by this scripture just by this scripture alone we can understand the importance of God sending to us the prophet of Malachi 4. for a true Prophet sees through the eye of God and tells us what has been tells us what is and tells us what's going to be ain't that right so God promised to lead his people amen by his eye amen and by looking through the eye of God Amen we talked about it the other day but the prophet name amen 2500 years ago or around that time amen back in the Years could look ahead to this day and tell us about our cars that we would have tell us about the highways tell us about the wrecks that would happen they were jostling a man see and and the staying see and he was able to do that by looking through through the eye of God ain't that right every god-sent Prophet has been able to foresee the future by looking through the eye of of God and so that's what a prophet is called he's called a Seer a man he's able to get lifted up and he's able to see what a natural man cannot see and and and so we find that he sees things that are impossible for us to see and that's why we needed to profit in this day amen we didn't need a theologian amen he couldn't look through the eye of God we we didn't need just some uh irregular preacher amen we we uh uh uh we needed a prophet see because he can look through the eye of God the prophet of our day read the same Bible that we have been reading for centuries but he saw things that the brightest mind could never see ain't that right God could take a seventh grade hillbilly Kentucky and amen and reveal the word to us that that the brightest the most educated preacher could never uh uh uh uh see in in here ain't that right see but God promised that he would guide us by his eye ain't that right so therefore a prophet of this day was able to give us the the the correct interpretation of the word of God Amen now if the word is going to be our leader then we're going to have to have the the correct interpretation of the word ain't that right we're not going to accept anything as the word of God Amen but I tell you what we've looked at it and we've understood that today God would send the prophet of Malachi 4 and he saw things that were totally different amen because he was looking through the eye of God he was able to give the interpret correct interpretation of dreams that God gave he was able to see Visions he was able to see in people's lives and tell them things that they themselves either forgot about or or or didn't even know about see and and he was able to tell the kind of disease a person had that even the doctor didn't even know how how to describe it they they couldn't even find these diseases and yet there was a prophet that would tell them and even when the doctor would keep it from the patient amen that they were dying there was the spirit of God the prophet looking through the eye of God and could tell him now the doctor don't want you to know this but you're dying and you ain't got much to live it's going to take the grace of God what what man could do that that wasn't a physician he wasn't trained in science he wasn't trained in the medical fields and all that see it was through the eye of God that he could deceive these things amen now prophets are human beings just like you and I and that right they are men of like passion just as we are but God would enables him Amen to look through his eye so to guide his people amen now this is important church amen you've got to have a guide and you got to know who your God is amen because a goat will lead you to death ain't that right but but the prophet or David that would declare to us that the Lord is Our Shepherd and if the shepherd The Lord Is Our Shepherd then the Sheep's got to know the way of the shepherd amen the Sheep's got to know how the shepherd Works can you say amen that's right and we we just believe that and so prophets to whom the word of the Lord came were the the mouthpiece of God ain't that right the prophet Isaiah had thus saith the Lord the prophet Moses had thus saith the Lord every Prophet down Through the Ages a true prophet of God had thus saith the Lord ain't that right amen God would use their lips Amen to speak his word and so the the Bible is the word of God and I'm getting somewhere now so stay with me that the Bible is the word of God that was spoken from the lips of mortal men that they were prophets amen and not one prophecy ever failed and and and even though a prophet was maybe 400 years from uh separate from the other one they would all speak the same thing they didn't have the whole Bible like we did but yet their prophecies was in continuity all the way down why they were looking through the same eye and that was the eye of God a prophet with decease and he would be buried but the same Eternal God had the same Eternal eye amen and therefore he would raise up Prophet after prophet and they could look through the eye of God Amen until what would be until what has been and tell what is going on can you say Amen oh my and to think of it we rest our hopes upon what they've said we rest Our Hope amen not Upon A man we're not following a man we're not following his idea we're following amen the voice of God [Music] so a prophet is important to us because God speaks to them now this is how important a man a prophet is to us and and and of Psalm 17 4 David would say by the word of thy lips by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the Destroyer so so think of that by the word that came from his lips can you say Amen not David's lips amen but God's lips but we know God the only lips that God had was a prophet that would have thus saith the Lord ain't that right amen for brother Brown said they were the mouthpiece of God Amen Israel knew the importance of a prophet if they wanted to hear from God Amen they needed a prophet go to the prophet let's let the prophet speak for us ain't that right and then we needed it now so God has not left us without a God Amen it's because now now notice it's because of the message of the hour that we are able to look through the eye of God Amen we are able to look for the message came by the prophet looking through the eye God's eye ain't that right amen now if a man isn't looking through the eye of God he's blind amen and he does not know where to go ain't that right amen and he walks in darkness for he cannot see Amen brother Branham said we will not walk in darkness as long as we look through God's eye and you say amen amen this will not be a book of Darkness if you can look through God's eye can you say amen amen and I'm so glad that we've got a message of the hour today amen because it is the interpretation uh that have come by looking a prophet looking through God's eye amen safe amen and I just personally believe amen that there are ministers today amen that are under the same inspiration they're not bringing a new message amen but they're listening to them tapes they're studying the message amen and they're seeing something that the prophet caught amen and I believe that the people of this age is seeing something that the prophet caught and the book as it became a new book to brother Branham it's becoming a new book to us it's becoming a new book to you mom and dads amen it's becoming a new book to you young people because you're able amen by the prophet and the interpretation to look through the eye of God [Applause] see by the message of the hour we're able to see what has been and what is and what shall be amen by the message of the hour we're able to see ourselves in the word of God ain't that right amen I just thank God for for his All-Seeing Eye a man see so the Bible is the only book The Prophet says that can tell you uh where you come from who you are and where you're going this Bible ain't that right but it took God's eye to reveal it it took a prophet being able to see a man through a different lens through a different eye a man then a theologian what a theologian was seeing amen see this Bible has been sealed up meaning that there could not be an understanding of it it's been a mysterious book can you say man and the Mysteries have been probed at throughout these denominational years the prophet said and so we we find in Revelations 10 7 that that uh if foretold of the seventh angel coming and revealing the Mysteries that had been hidden in the word it would take the bloody bleeding Lamb of God Amen to step forward and take the book out of the right hand of him that's set upon the throne and the loose the seals thereof amen and then we find in Revelations 10 1. amen now we're looking through the I've got now amen and we're seeing a man that that Mighty Angel descending from heaven with an open book and we know it to be only Christ it could be the spirit of truth that has come in this day ain't that right amen now the prophet would tell us the first thing that represented that Redemption come the lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world he took the book Glory opened the book tore off the seals and sent it down to the Earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people and the prophet said that that seven angel had to be a prophet for the word of God to come to amen but he wouldn't get his own interpretation now he would look through an eye the same God that promised to guide his people by this eye amen he would raise up that Prophet Amen to guide us today do you believe that amen we're being guided amen so the 7 of Angel brother Brown said winds up all the loose sins that these fellas probed at and the mystery comes down from God as the word of God and reveals the entire revelation of God not one mystery is closed not one mystery is hidden everything is opened up we don't need a nice day messenger amen we don't need another Prophet to come and reveal something we don't need brother Branham to come back and open up the seals the entire revelation of God has been made known can you say amen that's why we stay with the prophet of the age amen the seventh angel messenger ain't that right so you you remember now John foresaw the lamb opening the book and when the book came open John Saul his name on it he saw his name on the book ain't that right and I just saw this in if you notice John in the Revelation he was Guided by the by by one of these seven angels even he himself had to be guided ain't that right and he said it was one of the Seven Angels amen and he speaks of the Seven Angels uh uh there in Revelations chapter one amen and that angel amen told him that he was a prophet amen remember he was going about John was going to Bow Down and Worship Him amen he said oh no no no don't worship me worship God Amen I'm just of your fellow brother and one of the prophets ain't that right amen see amen but it was a prophet that was God John not a reformer it was a prophet amen that would guide John and and and of course John represents the Bride of Jesus Christ can you say Amen but I say this the book amen the book remains mysterious if you're not looking through the eye of God right can you say Amen now and I'm getting somewhere now but hopefully tonight but brother Branham said you cannot read this Bible as you would a newspaper ain't that right the Bible is a love letter can you say man it's it's a love letter if you're getting law out of this book amen for this age you've missed it it's a message of Grace it's a love letter and brother Branham said the real message is hidden between the lines see it's going to take an eye not your eye not your understanding it would take the eye of God Amen that we could see through and really see what it is yes my name is Sean Martin is not in there but when I look through the eye of God I see that I'm in here I'm part of every promise yes sir amen and you can't take that away from me Hallelujah I've already looked through the eye of God ain't that right amen see so you cannot understand this amen you cannot understand God's love letter amen his Secrets Amen to his bride amen through by having some theological interpretation of it ain't that right Luke 10 21 Jesus said I thank the old father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent amen seeds so it's the wise it's hid from the wise and prudent amen job speaking here in job 12 25 5 they grew up in the dark without light and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man amen job 17 3 for thou has hid their heart from understanding therefore Thou shalt not exalt them now as I've been reading these scriptures and stuff I I just get excited and and hopefully you know the spirit of God would just take it into you of what a blessing it is Amen to have a greater understanding than just a carnal understanding of this Bible amen because you'll never be able to see the things that God has in this Bible except we look through the eye of God can you say amen amen and soak here amen he's hid their understanding therefore he shall not exalt them this tells us that God exalts his people by giving them the understanding or the river Revelation ain't that right and this is why Satan hates Revelation amen he hates it amen for the prophet said he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is she and what she stands for that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible harm man amen see revelation will Elevate you up amen from from just a a beggar Amen to a child of the king it will Elevate you amen it'll elevate your prayer it'll elevate your your worship it'll Elevate you your faith it'll Elevate you all together because you're not coming to church as a vagabond you're not coming to church thinking that you're just a coincidence you're not coming to church just thinking that you're just never gonna make it amen in question how can I and God why and and I just don't know but now that Revelation has elevated you amen into a position mission that you can now tell the devil get out of my life get out of my home get out of my church leave my daughter alone leave my son alone leave my husband alone amen see it elevates you but he will not Elevate those that has hid the mystery from can you shave man but what God is Grace to you that God would reveal he a hidden word to you amen because he's elevating you that's what he's doing he gave us a prophet to see through the eye of God that you could see what he is seeing by Revelation and you're elevated do you believe that this bride is exalted above demon powers do you believe that for the Bible says Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and the prophet said it's the revelation of Jesus Christ and you're part of Jesus Christ the revelation of this day is you being missed Jesus Christ you are that anointing you are the predestinated seed of God [Applause] yes sir you're exalted above demonic powers this bride is exalted above negative voices this bride is exalted you're more exalted than the president of the United States your prayer is more powerful than an angel's prayer can you say man that's what the prophet says your prayer gets somewhere with God more than an angel you mean more to God than an Angelic being for you've got the blood of Jesus Christ flowing through your veins now God has hid these things Paul said from that wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes and the prophet said such as will learn ain't that right now listen now we know we're living in the time of Capstone of the Capstone The Seven Ages have run out amen now it's time for the Capstone do you believe that that's what this message is it's the Capstone the Capstone finishes the work do you believe that it's not the beginning of the work it's the completion of the work amen see uh uh the Great Pyramid amen it's it's a it's still a mystery today of how man built that amen but it was never complete amen because the Capstone was never laid upon it ain't that right amen that's right see they didn't put the Capstone on it amen but but then and and and and we know that the pyramid the Great Pyramid is god's second Bible amen and and Enoch's the one that built that under inspiration and and and and and and so uh uh but they didn't put the Capstone on it and and I believe it was inspired that they didn't to show that Jesus Christ the Capstone would be rejected when he's first came ain't that right he was rejected amen but see in this Sage everybody's saying this age Jesus comes as the Capstone [Applause] can you say man to the bride and he will not be rejected by her again he ain't gonna be rejected he's going to be received and the Bible's already promised that they would cry Grace Grace unto The Headstone as he comes down amen he's resting up on her finishing her off she becomes power of his power life of his life word of his word Spirit of his Spirit she is him Ain't That Rock she becomes the Masterpiece that God started in the day of Pentecost that's right see so Christ the Capstone comes down upon the bride and she and he becomes one and the same now brother Brown said Christ will have to be in the church the anointed of the word to make everything fulfilled keep that in mind everything fulfilled amen see that's and that's the Capstone that comes upon the last Church age not the laodicea now it's a calling out of that a bride out of a church a church out of a church and otherwise just like he called a nation out of a nation in Egypt now we're living in that day and we're grateful for these great things that we've been seeing ain't that right now if you'll put that picture up amen now our American dollar testifies of the day that we're living in ain't that right amen here's the pyramid there amen and then right under that it says under the pyramid it says the Great Seal and brother Brown says now why didn't they put the Seal of the American seal on it amen which is the eagle amen he said because that's not God's sealed this is God's seal testifying of the age that we're living in and if you notice there's the Capstone coming down and what's in that Capstone it's an eye can you say man amen it would be the eye that God promised Amen in in in Psalms that I would guide thee with my eye amen and even an American our government has to testify of it they don't understand what they're saying that God would say there would be a Prophet come out of this nation and he would be the one to get to the people and lead them into the plan to promise and what we see is an eye amen can you say Amen God's showing that he's true to his word and even the prophet said and even our own government is testifying of it I'm bored hey do you love him Hallelujah it's our own American dollars testifying of the Capstone coming down in this day and the Capstone the prophet said is a great big eye amen see what is it it's the eye of God the spirit of truth that's leading us into all truth the Capstone Ministry can you say Amen now if you'll give me some time amen I'm trying to hurry amen but this reminds me of what Paul wrote in Ephesians now and he's praying for this day Ephesians 1 16. I cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayer that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and understanding of spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him can you say Amen Spirit of wisdom and Revelation that the eyes of your understanding be enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance is in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe according to the working of his mighty is this all right so as the Sheep of God we're able to look through the eye of God by the prophet of Malachi 4 that seventh angel First Corinthians 2 and 9 but as it is written I I hath not seen nor ear has heard neither has it entered into the heart of man the things listen I'm still talking about the paths of righteous I actually hadn't left it yet the things that God has restored or has has uh prepared for them that love him but everybody say but aren't you glad for that changes the scene right there it changes from hopeless to now hope it changes from impossible now to possible but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yea the Deep things of God them things that have been hidden for ages and ages before the foundation of the world has now been revealed by the eye of God can you say Amen now we that's that's that's important amen see Deuteronomy now listen to this one Deuteronomy 29 and 29 the secret things everybody say the secret things belonging to the Lord Our God but those things which are revealed belong to us come on Church y'all to be excited about that one that's your promise the secret things belong unto the Lord Our God the devil has nothing he has no hold Amen to the secret things he has no power over the secret things they belong unto God and those things that he has revealed belong to us not only us but to our children forever the devil can never take what God has revealed to you because they belong to you God gave them to you blew his eye and by revealing them he gave them to you Redemption belongs to us healing belongs to us Deliverance belongs to us you'd understand that church that's why the devil can't keep your wayward loved one away he can never keep them Bound for long it belongs to us that's a promise amen they belong to us Perfection belongs to us the future home of the Earthly bride and the Heavenly bridegroom that belongs to us these things that the prophet revealed amen is is a revelation that because God gave them to you adoption belongs to us the manifestation of God belongs the sons of God belong to us amen that which is beyond the curtain of time belongs to us not just the Earthly things amen but that which is an eternal things a man belongs to us God would reveal what was over there the Rapture belongs to us it belongs to us and our children forever can you say that with me it belongs to us and our children forever how you going how's it going to do it I don't know I I ain't no I ain't no whatever I I can't tell you how it's going to be done it'll be done it belongs to us can you say man see looking through the eye of God now we see we know we understand that's the key we see we know we understand the things that belong to us or that aren't ordained for us see when they come into the promised land hey man they just didn't go around say no I wonder if that's mine I wonder what this is I wonder no it all belonged to them everywhere they look every ground inch of ground that they stepped on it was mine it was theirs they didn't have to guess they didn't have to bargain they didn't have to go around amen having a survey of the land to see what what part is theirs and all of that they just knew they were in now in the promised land they had to win to moab's land and they couldn't possess that they went through Esau's land and they couldn't possess that amen the church has gone through seven ages and there's nothing that we could have possessed but now's the day now is the time that every promise in the book is mine can you say man amen the sixth Church age couldn't lay claim to the manifestation of the sons of God but you're that people that can lay claim to it see we know we see we understand the things that's been ordained for us because God has led us by his eye isn't that wonderful God's lettuce he's stay true brother Bill he stayed true to his word hey amen hey brother Brown said God's eye reflects his will his spirit and his word see so looking through the eye of God now if you're looking through the eye God what you're going to see is God's will for you your spirit in you working for you 'll see his word you'll see the promises ain't that right couldn't see it through a theologian nope nope no they can't give you promises yeah that's true amen now so then then we realize now that Deuteronomy 28 29 does not apply to us for God says here thou shall grope at Noonday as the blind groupeth in the Darkness and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways and that shall be openly oppressed and spoiled forever and no man shall save thee oh I'm so glad I'm not in that scripture but we are in it identified in what David said he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness do you realize the prophet said the beginning of righteousness is God's truth revealed that's the beginning of righteousness the path opens up for you when God begins to reveal the truth he begins to reveal the promises he begins to reveal can you say Amen oh see the word of God was revealed to Jesus he knew what he was sent to do he knew that he was to fulfill the scriptures he said to John it's becoming to us to fulfill all righteousness see it's up to us brother Brown said it's up to us to fulfill all righteousness can you say Amen now see what is righteousness it's his word righteousness every promise that has been laying here that's his righteousness amen and now the the revealed word the revealed truth has opened up the paths of righteousness can you say Amen that you could walk in them and what what it means is that now you're walking and fulfilling the promises you're not walking the Broadway God has showed you this way and and it's now become a personal revelation it's become a personal book every promise now becomes personal uh personal it's mine healing is mine Deliverance is mine whatever I have need of he is my Jehovah Jireh he is my Jehovah Shalom he is my amen my banner he is my victory it's mine so brother Branham says what is righteousness his word and it has to be fulfilled can you say man so these these Paths of righteousness have been are foretold in the scriptures see the word of God is not just being made up as we go along nope it's been these paths have been forordained before the foundation of the world we've read these scriptures we know them but we find comfort in them Romans 8 30 moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called and whom he called then he also justified in whom he justified then he also glorified ain't that right it's already done it's a subtle thing oh my we didn't know it but it had to be revealed can you say man now we're walking the past now we know what we're walking what kind of paths we're really walking can you say man it's something that's already been declared it's something that's already been finished it's something that's already been predestinated for me to walk [Applause] listen uh uh we read it last Wednesday I believe Ephesians 2 10 for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works ain't that right which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them ain't that right so it's already been set in motion amen and there is a people on Earth who are predestinated to fulfill it remember the land was predestinated to a certain people and there was a certain people that was predestinated to walk into that land and there was not one that was missing there was not one that God had already foreordained a man that would walk in that land that was already there oh church I mean I'm so glad that God saved me for this last stage you're not a coincidence God foresaw you in this age you would be the people to take the land you would be the people that God would send a Prophet by through his eye and would lead us into the promised land and show us every promise that belongs to us the paths of righteousness we didn't know anything about it until a prophet came along and looked through the eye of God notice what he saw a week ago and more and more on to what he saw but he said there that morning he's talking about he's telling the people he's talking about the going beyond the curtain of time and he said there that morning the quickening power come and he let me look over the curtain and I saw all of you there I just don't believe that he's just talking about that that group that was sitting there I believe he saw every predestinated believer so I'm going to just lay claim I believe he saw Sean Martin can you say men why he was looking through a different lens looking through a different eye and he said I saw you there can you say amen he was looking through the eye of God Paul being a prophet looked and Saul that we have already a body waiting for us when we leave this Earthly uh body and he said we have one waiting the prophet said we already have one it's there see and see we we find amen how could Paul say that because he was looking through the eye of God now we can say that's nothing but the truth are you with me now why because we're looking through the eye of God we're seeing ourselves you with me if John could see himself from the book when the book opened then John represented us now church either the book is closed or it's not but it's open ain't that right the book is open so then that means that if if John typed us as the bride then we can look at the book and see ourselves all right come on now brother Branham in looking through the eye of God said if God when I was an alien from him so loved me till he stooped down to get me and pick me up that gives me confidence that he wants to use me he's got a purpose in doing so he's seen something in me seen something in you he hadn't he had a reason to save you look at the people that's unsaved today look at the millions he could have took beside you but he took you and no one can take your place now now how can he say that because he's looking through the eye of God no one can take your place you're in God's economy no one can do it that's his love to you see it's already done so then as the prophet would tell us that takes all the fear away from us do you believe that because when God makes a decree there's nothing that's going to stop it isn't that wonderful when God makes a decree there's nothing going to stop it now I'm getting ready to close but God said to Jeremiah in Jeremiah 1 4 before I formed Thee I knew thee before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet before uh unto the Nations ain't that right brother Brown said see what what did Jeremiah have to do with that nothing God did it so it's God's Sovereign Grace that he does things and God has a church that's going to appear without spot or wrinkle he's already said it do you believe that he's already said it and he's not guessing as to who's going to be there he's already knows who's going to be there and I believe I'm looking at him that church he said is for ordained do you believe it oh isn't the Lord good amen amen I got a lot more but I'm gonna just I'm not going to close I know it's a Wednesday night but if the musicians will come but I want you to notice what Israel or God tells Israel as a nation there in Isaiah 41 and 8. but thou is alert my servant Jacob whom I have chosen the Seed of Abraham my friend thou whom I have taken from the ends of the Earth and called thee from the chief men thereof and said unto thee Thou Art my servant I have chosen thee and not cast thee away fear thou not for I am with thee be not dismayed for I am thy God I will strengthen thee yeah I will help thee yea I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness or the right hand actually means power with the power of my word in other words see again there in Isaiah 43 and 1. uh uh God speaks to Israel but now thus saith the Lord that created the old Jacob and he that formed the O Israel fear not for I have redeemed Thee I have called thee button thy name Thou Art mine when thou pass through the waters I will be with thee and through the the rivers they shall not uh overflow thee and when thou walkest through the fire Thou shalt not be burned neither shall the flame Kindle upon thee for I am the Lord thy God the Holy One of Israel thy savior I gave Egypt for thy Ransom Ethiopian seba for thee since thou was precious in my sight thou has been been honorable and I have lovely therefore will I give men for thee and people for thy life fear not for I am with thee I will bring thy seed from the East and gather thee from the West now seek God now you think of this God now knowing he's prophesying amen say I will say to the north give up and to the South keep not back bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the ends of the Earth even everyone that is called by my name for I have created him for my glory I have formed him yea I have made him I believe this prophecy applies to both spiritual and and and natural people but looking at the natural people for nearly 2 000 years now Israel as a people have been scattered throughout the world ain't that right they've been scattered throughout the out the world Amen and and and there has not been a nation of Israel uh for nearly 2 000 years amen scattered abroad it looked hopeless but there was a promise that God made concerning to that natural people that no matter how scattered you are see it was already ordained it was a path that was already fordained God knew that this would happen but he said I'm not I'm not forsaken thee so when you feel forsaken when you feel alone when you feel like I forgot you remember this I gave people for thy life I gave Egypt for a ransom for thee amen I have loved thee amen when thou was small amen everything that God had toward Israel is still there can you say amen amen see and so but today we look and there are the Jews now they're gathered they're in their Homeland amen and so we see that once again Israel stands as a nation which testifies of this promise that God didn't forget the promise God had already forordained it to happen but he says after time I'm gonna gather thee I'll say to to the South I'll say to the Lord the East the West give them up and they had to give up and there they stand as a nation that is a miracle [Music] then we find there in Revelations that God prophesied again [Music] that there would be a certain number out of each tribe he's going to seal hello twelve thousand out of each tribe which equals to what 144 000. and God's promised that but we know as the prophet told us that the only way that God could deal with him is as a nation he deals with us as individuals but as to Israel as a nation so in order to seal them he had to bring him back to their Homeland and now they are they're there and no doubt that maybe there's some stragglings around throughout the Nations that that through these wars and things that are going on that God's bringing them in because it's time and God's going to keep his promise and God knows exactly who he's going to seal and I believe that I believe that there are people living on the earth of Jews that are going to be part of that number just as much as I believe that there are people that are leaving on this Earth that'll never taste death that they're going to be in a Rapture I just believe that that's how close we are [Music] Say Amen so he's always predestinated when God speaks it's going to happen and this is what these Paths of righteousness these are ordained paths that God has predestined his word concerning this Bride for this age and it's going to be fulfilled he's leading us aren't you glad for that I wished I could get into the history of it and these things and go more but we see that what the church has gone through through church history [Music] 66 million Christians martyred the church lived on because there were promises for this day that had to be fulfilled [Music] Satan couldn't kill that seat off but here we are glorious here we are Triumph because we're Guided by his eye into these Paths of righteousness and all we can say it's been God's grace in our lives do you love him
