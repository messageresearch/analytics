foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] can we sing that again Jesus is the sweetest of all Jesus is the sweetest name I know [Music] the same as his lovely name that the reason why I love him so [Music] foreign Jesus is the sweetest name I know well is he sweet to you amen he's so lovely you can't help but love him once you know him get acquainted with him a man he's just so wonderful to listen the musicians can be dismissed but you know we're in a day where the Bible says that men would become lovers of pleasure lovers of their own selves more than lovers of God and it shows that they've kicked him out and uh because I once you you really have that relationship with Christ uh you you just put yourself on the back burner and you put the world on the back burner and uh you just don't have them desires because he becomes the main focus he he has the main preeminence a man and uh but I'm so glad that there are a people that love the Lord and that are walking with him and and it's so good to have everyone here with us this morning and um we missed the different ones brother shamaya and he was sick Wednesday and brother Terry sister Alice was sick and Miss sister Cindy and uh Wednesday night and you know and so it's good to have everyone and we just missed those that everyone and just uh whether you have to work or not able to make it for some reason we we certainly miss miss all of you a man when you're not here and we want to remember communion this evening the Lord willing and looking forward to that as well amen and if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the book of Ephesians the first chapter and like to just say I really appreciate uh the the ministry ministers that here at Faith Tabernacle that God has sent to us to help me amen labor in the gospel and um these men are a constant support to me and um and I'm I'm glad that we can work together in the Lord and uh you know everyone's got their different gift their gift different style and um and different approach you know there's we we all have a uh maybe a different approach to things it's kind of like climbing a mountain I I may come up on one side of the mountain and uh you know uh brother Amos may come up on another side of the mountain and brother Terry another side and we're approaching maybe the subject it uh in a different way and yet we're all coming to this the top and the same point and um I I just uh I'm so glad that God's got a variety and we always strive to to arrive at the same at the top at the same place and uh so I just thank the Lord and uh it's just we all got different um as as even as a group uh different personalities different ways of of looking at things and um and but yet it's it's something that is good it's it's good and and because we all love the Lord and as long as we're staying in scripture as long as we're following the message of the hour then that's what we want amen and so uh here in the book of Ephesians um we've been reading this and so I'm just going to um um just start at the 22nd verse read the two verses there but it says then hath put all things under his feet and gave him Christ to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all now let's just bow our heads and talk to our Lord how great you are our old father Lord you Reign on high and there's none else like you and Lord we are your children we are sons and daughters in your image Lord that have been made from your your hands the work of your hands Lord your word and father we just humble ourselves here this morning asking that you would just come Among Us we take all limitations all father that you would be free to move Among Us father May our faith be elevated to a place Lord that father we can believe all things but that's that's what we desire Lord I pray Lord that you would help us to be more established in your word give us the words to say Lord and anoint these lips of clay father and I pray that you had anoint the heart and ear of your people to hear and receive let it all be For Your Glory and we ask these things in your lovely name Jesus Christ amen and amen you can have your seats this morning and I'm just going to continue on the subject that we've been speaking on and there is a a reason I am going in this direction that I've gone the past two Sundays I have I have been um studying this for a little while and uh told I believe maybe my wife brother Andrew that I'm wanting to to go this way I guess a month ago or so and and but there's a reason why and and we know that there are two sides that exist really to everything and uh one side that we we see is that where people don't believe that you have to have a Pentecostal experience and also they don't believe in in the shouting they don't believe in dancing they don't believe in uh speaking in tongues or prophesying and they view all of these things as sensational emotional uh nonsense and fanatical or whatever and they consider these things as being part of the Pentecostal age they say well we're now in the opening of the word so these things are something that don't belong to us and so they they tend to have this era about them that the people back in the first church you know they were just as what the Bible would say just ignorant and unlearned and we are now you know they they have this attitude that now we're a better class we're better than what they are we're better off than what they are and uh and so we don't need really what they had and uh maybe not saying it but that's the attitude that's that's what they project when they when they're when they're talking preaching teaching whatever and and and so we don't need what they've got because we have the word open to us we have more knowledge than what they had and therefore we are better off than they and of course their teaching is just very dry intellectual no anointing and their worship is formal and orderly and and to be honest this seems to be uh more appealing to the upper class uh or people that try or want to be dignified and so they don't believe in the nine spiritual gifts being in the church today and they teach that the gifts were for the apostles now we're in the adoption age or or whatever and and so um or they they teach that you know there's some gifts that are for us and but not all the gifts and and and and so then you got some that don't don't believe in laying uh hands on the sick anymore because we've all gone to the spoken word and uh they criticize our prayer lines they create criticize the ministers for hollering and and you know going all over the place and spitting and they don't see the need to break down and cry and boohoo and uh they they don't they don't see the need for the shouting and the dancing and everything needs to be orderly you know and don't need to see the need for the excitement and all of that and and to be honest a lot of people lean that direction and uh then then on the other side of this we have people who who believe in all nine spiritual gifts they believe in the shouting the dancing the praising God they believe in speaking in tongues they believe in Prophecy and Visions they believe in the word of knowledge and and and I I will say that the the prophet lean more to that side than he'd done the other side uh uh for he said I'd rather have a little Wildfire than none at all and he said I'd rather be around a fire that's popping and jumping anytime if the world's cold then to be around an iceberg uh but as we we see and I hope to to uh show that the prophet had a balance to everything he he always had a balance now the problem with this side is that they use these things as a standard for having a good service or a good meaning meeting or and they tend to put these things above the word of God dreams are good but don't trust them right dancing and shouting is good but don't trust them you you cannot trust these things and base the your salvation off of any of this tongues are good but don't trust them prophecy is good but don't trust them and when I say that and and hopefully we can get more into it but prophecy is to be judged ain't that right before the church accepts it it's got to be judged before two or three Witnesses before it is you know from what I can see before it's even brought to the church before the congregation and so uh but but as it was in the Pentecostal age uh it it become a basis uh it become the foundation for everything and so uh uh this side base is a good service on these things they base their whole walk on these things shouting and and so then it becomes shouting and dancing speaking in tongues and and all the nine spiritual gifts become so important that uh uh it because it becomes now the standard for it all and and and and and that's where it becomes starts becoming a workup uh but you cannot base your salvation on anything but the word of God and and so do not and and I repeat that do not be led by dreams emotions Sensations uh uh or even prophecy judge everything by the word of God do you believe that now brother Branham uh he and and there's several places but um you know how it is when you're studying brother Terry and and you read this quote and and then you pass it and then you can't find it and you know you just read it well that's the way it is but I did find uh one uh where brother Brown said I don't care what any Angel would say if it ain't according to the word I don't believe it ain't that right and he said if that angel told me something different from that this word I wouldn't believe the Angel that's right God's words first above all angels and everything else so so you have what brother Branham called the formal side and then you have what brother Branham called The Fanatic side and that that was more Pentecostals in that in that rim and and but he says then the bride stands in the middle walking straight through it calling from both sides ain't that right now I want you to understand that that I'm not fighting with any side it's not a personal thing to me but uh and and what's bad when when when you address things is is because there's so many teachings there's so many things that maybe are are in Era that people automatically think that when you're hitting something if I if I hit on seven Thunders and they're teaching of seventh turn if people know who's teaching that stuff automatically goes right there and say oh he's talking about that group you know and uh or if we talk about two Lords if you know the group that that's talk about two Lords and we're dealing with two Lords it's automatically he's talking about that group but no we're just we're just preaching and we're just trying to say what brother Branham said I don't care who starts it it's just brother Branham is the one that's that come as a prophet and so so it's not a personal thing but it is important to be established in what brother Branham taught and to know what the word says about it as I read last Sunday no True Believer is any stronger and pers spiritually healthy and Alive than his knowledge of and adherence to the pure word of God amen so I'm I'm I'm uh as as a minister of the gospel and as your pastor I am responsible to preach what I believe and see that is in the scripture and in the message and so I'm not going to believe anything and uh by God's grace that would make me have to overlook the many quotes and scriptures uh in order to make my belief work and and if we have to do that if if if we start you know uh if if maybe you you start maybe leaning some way and and then all sudden you see several quotes where brother Brandon says this and it bothers you that he said that to where you can't quote them then something's wrong or so is it with the scriptures if if you're looking at quotes where brother Brown said this and then you and then I ask you well what does the Bible say about it too well brother Ram said this well what does the Bible say about it you understand what I'm saying well that means that your opinion or your interpretation of what brother Brown said ain't mansion because he never taught anything outside this Bible you understand so so you now so so you may hear me say something and automatically you say well he's talking about that individual or is that certain church or whatever that's not true and so don't don't think that okay he's he's taking the fight behind a Pulpit uh to get to get someone in a personal matter that's not true say you you got to let it let the preacher preach and just just let us let it let me just talk and and and if if the minister is preaching truth you know and if it's if if it's I don't care what it is if it's about trinitarian well we're not you know and if there's a trinitarian sitting here we're not singling that that guy out you know we're just preaching truth now and and I understand you know uh you always try to uh uh be wise in in these things but when it's just a church full of uh Believers then we're just going to preach and so it has nothing to do with in in a personal way and I'm not saying anyone has talked to me about it or anything I'm just wanting to make it clear that that uh that you can and I pray that you can have the confidence in me as your pastor uh uh to where uh uh you know that you can say well he's just preaching what the Bible says and what the message says and if it's against what I'm believing or if it's against what so and so is whatever that is truth and and so if if you can't do it that way then there's just no sense in preaching uh uh because uh uh there's so many things out there that any any way you preach any angle You Preach uh you're going to hit something hit somebody or you're gonna whatever if you understand so we we find I want you to listen to this quote brother Brown said when Jesus passed by the pool of Bethesda and seen all the people and he healed a man and the Jews questioned him why and he said I do nothing but what the father shows me I can't do nothing so he said whatever he does he shows me and then I go do that that's true in Saint John 5 19. and we noticed him he was a kind man a humble man and yet he was a man of power when he spoke see he was very humble and gentle but when it come time see between to separate between truth and error Jesus was very Stern picked up some ropes and tied them together and kicked over the money changers Chargers table and beat them out of the temple called the Pharisees those religious people said well you bunch of Hypocrites you serpent snakes in the grass and all these things see he was a man who could speak when it come time to speak and he was a man who was full of love notice what he says but he loved his father so much till he stayed in harmony with his father and anything that interfered with that Harmony then Jesus drew the line now this harmony is supposed to exist in the bride because he says this he says this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death ain't that right so so now you as individuals y'all can do what you want to do I don't I don't care I'm just preaching yeah I just preached the word and and I I I'm I'm doing everything by God's grace to stay in balance with the message and and the word but and so but I'm going to draw a line between anything that would try to get in the way between Harmony and that Harmony and disrupt that Harmony between me and my father because as Jesus loved the father I love the father and I know you do too and so by God's grace I'm not going to teach you the Traditions that came from the Pentecostal age I just want to at this time to to take you as to what the Pentecostal the first church was now upon saying that I want to make a correction as to what I said last Sunday um and and and I I mentioned about brother John Ryan uh laughing in the spirit and speaking in tongues and prophesying over brother Branham when I got home or even after the service I just felt man I just felt something wrong and I I I got home and it just bothered it's just something there and and uh it just wouldn't let up for a couple days and and so in my heart I was wondering what what did I say what what happened what was wrong and so Tuesday night I I couldn't sleep I um just that just kept uh there uh in my mind and and so I I started just trying to find the story where brother Branham talks about it and uh got to searching through the message and and this is what brother Branham says he said I become acquainted with brother Ryan during that time um uh speaking of that uh the the uh Pentecostal meeting in Indiana that he went to and he said uh he said around that time he said but I met him at a service one day and hurting testifying Louisville and so he invited me and that's when he come to my house and he sat there one day and he said now Pentecost was a strange thing to me and how many times he tried to tell me about it and he was sitting there and he just raised up and he threw up his hand and began to speak with unknown tongue with an unknown tongue and he stopped and looked at me right straight walked to me laid his hand over on my shoulder and said brother Billy you're just a lad now there's a lot of Youth to you yet but someday that's going to settle down and almighty God is going to use you to steer the Nations and he walked out so it had been a long time since I had read this uh uh uh and for some reason I thought brother Brown said he laughed in the spirit and and so um but he didn't say that at all he just said he spoke in tongues and he prophesied so I got to looking into it more about what brother Brown said about laughing in the spirit and found out he didn't say nothing about laughing in the spirit at all uh and and unless you all know something that I don't that I I looked and I I'd spent some time uh trying to search it out and and so then the Bible doesn't even mention laughing in the spirit now the Bible talks about Rejoice sing it talks about being happy it talks about all these things but that phrase laughing in the spirit the the Bible doesn't even talk about it and and so uh um uh so as far as I know that it's the it's the it's something that happened in the Pentecostal age unless you all have history that I don't have or or whatever I I did not study in history I'm just taking it for what brother what where brother Brandon mentioned it or the Bible in that phrase laughing in the spirit and so it's something that from what I've gathered happened in the Pentecostal age and now as a child in the Pentecostal uh or whatever Rim uh age I I um uh I've seen people laugh in the spirit and and to be honest I I'm going to stay neutral with that I I I'm I'm gonna be because brother Brandon never mentioned it and and so I'm not going to say it's it's I'm not going to say either one I'm not going to say anything against or four uh now I have seeing it on internet laughing in the spirit charismatics and and to be honest it just looks it's it's it's demon uh knowledge uh from it just looked to be demonic uh there as as uh uh Kenneth Hagin and and them if you've ever watched that it's it's you know and and the Brownsville Revival in Florida They're laughing in the spirit and barking as dogs and and Howling and and they they've actually getting dog leashes and putting it around their necks and while they're on all fours laughing in the you know as laughing in the spirit and so I I I I looked up what that phrase means laughing in the spirit and they said it goes does come from Pentecost and and uh that it can last up to 15 seconds or to 10 minutes and and so uh these things and so uh anyways so I wanted to make that correction because calls I I am I'm if I'm going to tell you uh uh you know what what that that we are part of that Pentecostal what happened on the day of Pentecost then uh then then and that we need that type of experience and you know I just believe that the Lord wants me to not add things that maybe was in the Pentecostal age uh uh to what was the original you understand so I really think the Lord for for uh uh opening that up to me uh so what happened on the day of Pentecost was a supernatural event and more than that it was a supernatural God that came into man and and so uh uh brother Branham puts a correction uh you know where if you look at the the beginning of the book of Acts it says uh the the the uh what is it the the Acts of the Apostles and and um where brother Branham corrects that and said it wasn't the Acts of the Apostles it was the acts of the Holy Ghost and and so uh what the Holy Ghost did uh uh through these men uh came after the day of Pentecost ain't that right and so the the Holy Spirit was able to to uh um to do what he did through these men because of what took place on the day of Pentecost and and so and and we know uh what transpired on the day of Pentecost it was a birth it was the inauguration of the church ain't that right now in John 3 3 Jesus said verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom then you go on the sixth verse and Jesus said verily verily I say unto you except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God so again what happened on the day of Pentecost was the birth of the church and and and anyone who is a part of that church must receive a supernatural birth which again is a Pentecostal experience so nothing that these people received was of man it did not come from man it was not inspired by man this was the action of the Holy Ghost this was God coming into the people ain't that right and so it's it's uh the church or anyone that belongs in that church you cannot be in that church without receiving the birth and I say it's the birth because there's is only one birth that counts your first birth don't count this birth counts can you say man and and and there's only one birth that is able to put a man in the body of Christ and so first uh Corinthians 12 and 13 for by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body ain't that right and in that body there are gifts I like what brother Branham said he he said it's kind of like let's say this room here this this room you know he says there's gifts uh uh there's a chair to sit in there's uh music to play there's uh uh you know different things that that are beneficial to us and and and and and they're here in the room but you cannot come into the room unless you're baptized into this room you understand what I'm saying so that's what brother Brown's saying you cannot come into that body unless you're bad baptized by one Spirit into the body so so uh uh we we uh experience uh brother Brandon would say we experience Pentecost by the new birth ain't that right outside of the birth you're making up Pentecost it's it's an impersonation of Pentecost but but but by that birth you will experience Pentecost ain't that right and so everybody has to have a birth Rich poor dumb smart educated not so educated and and these things and it doesn't matter who they are they had to be born ain't that right amen you all of us had to be born or you wouldn't be here today you wouldn't even exist amen uh and and and we know that that birth was a mess amen your mama can tell you about that the the your birth was a mess and any birth is a mess ain't that rhyme and so the educated sophisticated dignified guy a man when he was born his birth was a mess it was just as a mess as the homeless man ain't that right see and and so uh uh the king even had to his birth was messy as as his subject's birth was messy amen the birth is a mess it it doesn't qualify it doesn't matter if you're in a in a family of royalty you're being born from a a the queen and and King uh or or you're born from a uh just a pauper a man every birth is a mess can you say man we all had a messy birth when we come into this world brother Brown said most people don't want the new birth because the new birth is kind of messy it's like any other birth any birth is a mess I don't care where it's at if it's in a pig pen or in the barn or if it's in a pink decorated hospital room it's a mess and so is the new birth a mess ain't that right he said it'll make you you do things that you don't think you would do stand on a corner and beat a tambourine or sing glory be to God hallelujah praise God glory to God why you act like a maniac that's what it done to the apostles that's what it done to the Virgin Mary Mary she act like she was drunk she was a mess in society but it takes a mess for life to come out of and he said anything unless anything dies and rocks life can't come from it and unless a man dies and rots in his own thoughts Christ can't get into his heart ain't that right so so this is the only way for for people to get to Christ and you think of that a man is by the birth and and I know the prophet said we're not getting people to Christ we're getting them to a church but brothers and sisters I know people apply that to the message ranks amen but he was talking to people that was in Donald denominations he was talking to people that was holding on to Creeds and holding on to false doctrines and holding on to traditions and and holding on to all we have the remedy to get people to crash and that is a messy birth can you say man we have that remedy and if you ain't got that power to bring a person to Christ by that birth something wrong hello you can't tell me that these charismatics know what a birth is you can't tell me that that that these denominations know what a birth is but we know what a birth is because we see the standard of that birth and that is in Pentecost there's a day of Pentecost it changed them it changed their lives it changed them Peter from a coward to a a man that could have the boldness to preach the gospel change the way of thinking ain't that right so see so it's the only way for us to get people to Christ preach the pure word to their own sinking and Creeds of men and traditions of men will rot the desires of the world will rot and you say man and and and so we we find in and I'll say it this way you don't have to tarry and wait till you get the Holy Ghost amen they waited they tarried because the Holy Ghost said that the the day of Pentecost hadn't fully come yet but brother Branham tells us you don't have to wait you don't have to tear me can you say man but I will say this if you ain't got what they had then don't go out and say you got it and if you're not getting it the prophet said there's something wrong You Gotta Die Out I don't care if you got to die out to your pride I don't care if you gotta die out to your thoughts whatever it is some people don't want the Holy Ghost because they're afraid what it'll do to them y'all May it'll embarrass them I'd rather have the Holy Ghost than be embarrassed we need it we need it you wander away from that day of Pentecost you've gone too far hello every generation has a chance for this right there it's true we may have more knowledge of the word today but you'll never be able to walk away from that seed outgrow that what what God done what God planted it was life in them people he planted life his own life in the people then you say Amen and if that life is still here it's the same life now we we find brother Bram says when you're trying to think for yourself well now if I walk up to the Altar and say Yes Lord I'm a fine fellow I'll take you I'll pay my tithes I'll do this no you've got to die and rot right there to your thoughts let everybody say let the Holy Ghost take over and just do whatever he wants to do with you whatever he wants to do with you just let go and let God can you say Amen you say oh no I'm opening up to Devils when I do that that's not true when you open up to this word you're opening up yourself up to Devils when you deny the day of Pentecost is for us today that same experience that was there is for us today and if you can't believe that that's the devil lying to you you've got to have an experience you've got to have a new birth can you say man and so you've got to just let him do based upon this promise I ain't gonna accept blood in my hands I'm not going to accept oil in my in coming out of the forehead that ain't what the Bible promised that God whatever you promised in this word I'm gonna yield myself to it can you say Amen so let the Holy Ghost take over and just do whatever he wants to with you get kind of messy with it ain't that right I know these charismatics make fun of these women you know our our women and the women of old that would have them bee hives you know them hair dudes and they get to dancing and Bobby here you know I've heard them I've uh They're laughing and making fun of it but it's the Holy Ghost when a lot of them sisters that was doing that and they didn't care what people think and they still don't care they gotta dance their shoes off let them dance it and I say to you young people whatever God has you to do don't you be afraid of it don't be afraid of the scorners don't be afraid of the Skeptics because you're going to have them all through life anything you do for God and and some of you that are leaders in in the church uh you're gonna you know that there's people always going to fight you in whatever you're trying to do they're going to be Skeptics of this and Skeptics of that well that's the way it is with Believers with Christians the more you move up in God the greater this criticism is going to be but just get lost in the spirit get kind of messy with it he said that's that sounds horrible not sacrilegious but it's the truth it's the only way I know how to punch the thing out to make you understand it what was more of a mess than that dignified bunch of Jews that day to see them people come out there with stammering lips dignified people watching a bunch of people with stammering lips I look you know brother random talked about you know stammering wrote around said is like stuttering so they had stammering lips they couldn't speak all they done is uh uh uh uh uh uh uh they they they they they they they were stuttering the Bible called it stammering lips hello Jesus see that and and and and and see they're they're pure tongue cloven tongues like as a fire and it's set up on each of them right that word cloven means part it's split like a a cloven hoof split see and the people couldn't say anything they weren't talking they weren't jabbering they weren't doing nothing the prophet said but just making noise uh uh now the prophet said see Mary had stammering lips which means clothing just a stammer trying to say something she was so full of the spirit she couldn't say it so brother Branham in imitates a stammering person and and say stammering lives and all of a sudden with another language they spoke out [Music] hello that's what the prophet says with another language they spoke out but see they were maniacs to a dignified bunch of people maybe you don't believe that but that's what the prophet says they were maniacs oh I got the Holy Ghost then you're trying to be friends with everybody you can't stand criticism hello so so we'll get more into that later but Jesus said except a corn of wheat fall in the ground and die and rot see so brother Brown said see messy get dirty with it that's right just die out and get down there he said a woman said to me one time said I'd be ashamed them people down there said I couldn't even hear you preach said why them women and men hollering hallelujah amen praise the Lord I couldn't hear what you were saying I said if they didn't say it it'd scare me to death hello if they didn't say it it would scare me to death she said when that woman got up there and started crying just run chills uh chills right up my back I said if you'd ever get to heaven you would preached to death the prophet didn't side with her say well I know them people need to be quiet I'm trying to teach them no he didn't side with him he said lady if you'd ever get to heaven you're going to freeze to death then if one woman's screaming and hollering and being excited about the word of God is going to run chills up in your back amen then you're going to freeze to this because they're going to be a millions of them over there then you say amen that's right he said see because everybody will be screaming and shouting and praising God do you realize you're only reflecting at the place that you're going to down here down here you're reflecting you're either a reflection of heaven or you're a reflection of the other place and there ain't gonna be people miserable there ain't gonna be people a man that is just uh so gloomy and talking negative and don't they they ain't going to be that way up in heaven and that same life is in a people today that gives us a a a an Outlook when there ain't nothing to look at positive about we can still see heaven we can still see that God is with us we can still see that God is going to answer our prayer that's what gets us excited what is it that life within us so he said see he said if you ever go to get to heaven you would preach to death I said because every everybody will be screaming shouting and praising he said what they're afraid of the new birth and you say man that's the reason we got grandchildren in the church they're afraid of the new birth afraid of the Holy Ghost afraid of the power of God afraid it'll wash some of the makeup off you or something afraid it'll clean them up afraid that they'll have to walk alone and lose all their friends they're afraid so they they want to make they want to make it a social gospel this message ain't Social Gospel if if you don't want to walk alone then don't follow the message I understand there are people that just want to be a part of the message but they don't want to leave that world they don't want to leave amen they're they're Pentecostal Traditions Baptist Traditions or whatever all right because it makes you act crazy you love him so what happened on the day of Pentecost brother Brown said deity fell out on the day of Pentecost and it's still falling that's what he said that's what it is it isn't about the shouting and the dance and all that let's just say what happened deity fell on the day of Pentecost and it done something to them people and it's still falling and it's still doing something to us that's the new birth and this is what made them a Christian and that's still what it takes to make a Christian and you say Amen brother Brown said see to be a Christian you must be christ-like tabernacling deity in you with the Holy Ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost not some emotion but I mean a real Pentecost foreign and then in another quote he says but Sensations come with it it's not a sensation that they receive but sensation came with it so you have a real Pentecost when deity is tabernacling in you like it did on the day of Pentecost what is it it is quickening quickening ain't that right see Ephesians 2 1 and you have to Quicken who were dead in trespasses and sins acts 1 and 8 and you shall receive power Supernatural power quickening power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you ain't that right so that's what happened the Holy Ghost deity came into them people and they were quickened Hallelujah now this power that they received is the ultimate it's the Supreme it's the highest the absolute above any other power as I said it changed Peter and the rest of the people that had received this deity God in them ain't that right and when Paul received it it changed him when any man received it when any woman boy girl received it it changed them can you say man yes sir that's right for it's the only way that a man can change yeah and that's true now it's the only way a man can change and as I said that the gospel the church is not a zoo we are free to come and go as we please we are free to do whatever we want to as we please but something has got a hold of us it has changed us to where I no longer want the world I I don't there's Temptations but down in my soul it it there's something that says I don't want that it's true so the only way for a man to receive this power is by receiving the holy ghost in the soul that quickens deceit in them ain't that right notice what brother Brown said the power of God took over the church on the day of Pentecost it made them drunk yep the Bible says they were drunk Prophet says they went into the streets staggering swinging their arms and acting like a bunch of Maniacs oh boy formals don't like that do they we want to just stand there and be dignified try not to break a sweat now brother Brad you know what brother Brown said after that quote he said to say that that's wrong is to deny the Bible ain't that right you say that that's wrong is to deny the Bible another quote he says the mother of Jesus had to go up there and be included in that bunch of people so drunk on the spirit till she staggered like she was drunk on whiskey or something and you think you'll get to Heaven by sleeping over to the church putting your song book under your arm and walking over every Sunday morning and the build tolls and sit and listen at some and walk back and some of the and then then he just says and walk back he said you'll never do it just coming to church sitting there listening to a preacher and walking out they ain't gonna do it and you say amen he said you'll have to come that route the way Mary came and the way the others came you're going to have to come that route because that's the only everybody say the only route that God ever lay down and ever has and you'll walk it or you won't be there he said I'm not your judge but I'm preaching the gospel that's exactly the truth the Blessed Virgin was right there acted just like it just as idiotic as the rest of them did just as drunk as the rest of them another place brother Brown said they went out on the street to begin screaming and act like crazy people but they say the opening of the word changed all that nonsense the opening of the word is the fullness of the word right so that means you can't pick and choose you can't say well yeah we're we're I'm going to believe it all but then deny the experience that they had for you hello now now you're working all of it up that's that's Pentecostal age that that comes from Pentacles I'm not talking about that they didn't work it up they waited on a promise hello it didn't matter they didn't know what the Holy Ghost was going to do to them they didn't know so there was no standards there you understand what I'm saying they didn't know okay Peter now now when this thing comes we're going to be dancing we're going to be shouting we're going to be we're going to be speaking in unknown tongues or tongues and and stammering and all that when it comes that way we'll know we got it they had no idea but all they knew when it happened it happened they were changed then you say amen and then they acted drunk and I don't care what the Holy Ghost does for you that all I know when it comes you're going to be different and if it makes you emotional to where you sit and cry or you roll on the floor or whatever it is you're going to be changed from that moment forward the prophets at Sea the Holy Ghost fail and divided itself and tongues of fire set upon each of them and while they were influenced everybody say they were influenced not by man but by the Holy Ghost and while they were influenced by the Holy Ghost they went into action staggering like drunk men screaming speaking in tongues out into the street they went what was it they were influenced by the Holy Ghost another place brother Graham said it made them slobber oh stammer act like a bunch of drunk people but everybody say but they were receiving New Life God was placing his life into that 120. they screamed they shouted they spoke in tongues they ran they acted like drunk people because they was inoculated and you say man what were they inoculated from the prophet said from the styles of the world I think it was brother Terry that had mentioned uh a couple weeks ago or so that the 120 were scared then people that went in that upper room they were scared to death they were cowards and and and and well let's I don't want to set that way uh uh they they it made them cowardly because they were scared for their life and and I'm gonna be honest with you I I probably would be too you understand what I'm saying that's the human side of it right The Human Side and and and so they they were they were scared for their lives they you know uh they didn't they really didn't know all they knew was the command that Jesus told them go and tarry and so we we know that they went out into the upper room they hid themselves ain't that right they hid themselves in the upper room and but notice what brother Brown said it was a paradox how about them people up in that Upper Room they're afraid of the Jews and had walked out walked with Jesus but when the Holy Ghost came they wasn't afraid no more out in the street they went screaming and falling and acting like a bunch of drunk people that was a paradox then you say man it's a paradox and I think that's the same way it is today when we go through our trials when we see the fear and the things uh uh that are happening in the world today that is causing fear you know good and well that our our economy is is not stable they they are saying recession is coming they they they they they you know their their props signed Doom and Gloom and and all of that but why is it that we still Rejoice why is it that we're still thankful why is it that we're still praising God why is it that our churches there ain't a a gloomy Spirit over the church today is because we're not afraid We're Not Afraid and we're not trusting in our own ability but the same life that God filled himself Amen in US is quickening us to where we know that God is the one that supplies our needs can you say Amen he's the one that'll protect us he is the one that will keep us so out on the street they went screaming falling and acting like a bunch of drunk people that was a paradox see the Holy Ghost Came Upon them women and all they wasn't ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ so the Holy Ghost took the fear away and so remember brother Brown said that on the day of Pentecost God planted a Pentecostal seed that's when the the church was inaugurated and and and brother Brown said God had a perfect Church he had a perfect Church and he says another place that church was a noisy Church they all staggered under the power of God full of new wine is that right we read this before he said that's the way the church was ordained that's the way that every church was ordained every time God has a church it'll be that same kind of a church because it ain't got no uncertain sound and you say amen and the preachers ain't preaching an uncertain sound we're telling you what God did for them you can have it today the same experience can you say Amen people our hearts are filled with fear in this world why they ain't got the experience that they needed they trusted in their Church they trusted in the preacher they trusted in their uh some experience but it wasn't based upon a Bible they they trusted in a dream they trusted in a prophecy they trusted in speaking in tongue they trusted it all but they never had a life change you love him so that was the birth of the church back then and every individual that receives the new birth will receive that same power and same Pentecostal experience and you say man and notice what they did afterward laughs the people went out the prophet said and done signs and wonders Peter who couldn't even write or read his own name couldn't read couldn't write his own name and yet that that same man the Bible says he and John I think was walking at the gate called Beautiful into the temple there was that lame man that man had been like that for many years or maybe even since birth I can't remember how the Bible talks about it but we know that he was begging for alms that was his way of life and he looked for rich people I'm sure people that had money But Here Comes these people that didn't have much but Peter says you know what silver and gold I don't have any but what I do have I give to you in the name of Jesus Christ rise and walk and the Bible says the man leaped to his feet shouting praising God can you say man that's right see so so we find that Paul upon receiving the same Pentecostal experience had so much God in him that he took the handkerchiefs off his body and sent it back to the sick person and he got healed see and and brother Branham said see the real Holy Ghost brings forth the same kind of an Evidence and proof that they had back there it comes with the same Holy Ghost you with me same Holy Ghost that's why we should be under expectation I want to challenge you to believe this morning I I hope that that that you're believing that when you're looking at the obstacles in your life and and maybe in your family whether it be your child or your husband or whatever that you can look and say that same holy ghost that I received will bring forth the same evidence are you with me now that same Holy Ghost I don't care I don't have to worry about it I don't have to ponder over it I don't have to fear about it can you say man the same promise that was back there is for you today think of what was given to that Philippian Jailer you just believed believe on Jesus Christ be in thy house shall be saved that meant a lot to that Philippian Jailer and Paul didn't even know his family I I don't guess but he gave the promise anyhow thee in thy family it's to thee in thy house can you say amen and then a prophet stands upon on on the Earth today to give us the same promise it's for thee in thy house lay claim to it can you say Amen see why you've got the same Holy Ghost receive the same power and you have the same evidence oh my I I'd encourage anyone here to read the book of Acts and go through it and see what what they done what that early church done hello because what they done is not an isolated thing because we are identified with that Pentecostal scene notice what brother Brown said the seed of Christ must come through his body not through a denomination now but through a word through a born again seed of the word must come through now remember what is it Christ's seed how does my seed come through the body how does the apple seed or tree seed come through the body see seed is through the body and the church is the body of Christ that right the Bible Church see uh this birth produces that's the new birth himself in body his church is his word so that people can see the confirmation of Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you believe it see now not denominational hybrids now this is those that's in the in in the orbit waiting for the countdown you know what I mean fixing to take a a a a a Rocket's Glory see not these are not for denominational hybrids not standing in here and they're not no sir it's the seed I may seed well we're seed age that's what the prophet said were seed age see time bright time so what happened on the day of Pentecost is for us today and I believe this is true because also brother Branham Likens that experience that they had and the things that they did to the manna that fail in the wilderness in the Old Testament most of us know about it every day God sent manna from Heaven defeat his people and brother Brian said it was manna that fell on the day of Pentecost ain't that right and notice that manner that fell in the wilderness was bread remember Graham called it angel food it was bread which was a type of Jesus Christ is that right for Jesus said in John I am the bread that came from Heaven came down from heaven so the prophet said he was the word bread the word bread so then we find Matthew 4 4 Jesus said it is written just break it in here man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God so he was the word manna that fell on the day of Pentecost ain't that right now as we said brother Brown said God planted a Pentecostal seed there but he also called it a bread grain right so what fell on the day of Pentecost was bread seed Pentecostal seed bread grain that's right see so it was bread green bread word bread grain Pentecostal seed all the same Manna it fell and now brother Brown says that Manna is a very beautiful type of the Holy Ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost which is our bread see men have failed just the same on the last day of their Journey as it did on the first day of the journey and it fell all through the Journey now brother Brad said today we'll continue falling till the millennium you say man now don't get quiet on me and disagree with that because I'll show you later on exactly where it's all coming down to where we're at the point I'm getting today is we're still at Pentecost in experience and it wasn't just something that just happened it was a manner that the church needed then you say man so we we find in the Old Testament you know the the God told the people he remember he told the people he says now now don't store up the manna don't store up the Manna uh for tomorrow you just take what you need for today ain't that right just take what you need today because it'll get it's full it'll ruin and so in in Exodus 16 20 we found out that some of them didn't listen and some left of it until the morning and it bred worms and stank and Moses was Wrath with them ain't that right but that's not the end of the story we find in Exodus 16 33 that Moses said unto Aaron take a pot and we know that this was a commandment from God take a pot and put an Homer full of manna therein and lay it out before the Lord to be kept for your Generations hello so what now is it this manner would not be left for everybody this would be a hidden manner hello and as the Lord commanded Moses so Aaron laid it up before the testimony to be kept see so where do they put it they had to put it in the holiest of holy not just anyone could go into the holiest of holy everybody had their had their Manna out here and out there nobody was able to keep it because it would spoil but in there that Manna would be kept for Generations after ain't that right so see and and the prophet said see that Manna was was kept where The Mercy Seat was it was kept where The Mercy Seat was and where the presence of God was ain't that right and it would last for future generations and only the elected called Chosen and ordained out of each generation were able to go behind that Veil amen and partake of the original manna foreign says every generation after that priesthood when a man comes to go becomes to go to be a priest to minister the word the first thing he gets to do after he is ordained is go in and get a handful of that original Manna and eat it and you say man now I'd say to you every ordained child of God that is called and elected and chosen to go behind the veil has every right to partake of that original manna can you say Amen that's right only the chosen now brother Brown says now you don't have to receive some duplicate or something wait till you get a taste of the original manna that fell on the day of Pentecost another place every believer that'll break behind the curtain Yonder and enter into this priesthood has a right to eat of the original manna that fell on the day of Pentecost a real old-fashioned Holy Ghost blessing another place every man that meets God's conditions and becomes a priest to come behind the veil and separate himself from the world receives not only a mouthful but a heartful of the original manna that fell on the day of Pentecost not something that looks like it but some of the real thing [Music] another place that people who really want the Holy Ghost won't receive something that looks like the Holy Ghost but they've got a mouthful and a Heart full of the original manna that fell on the day of Pentecost God's laid it up for every generation and you say amen and where is that hitting man hat where the presence of God Is Where The Mercy Seat is ain't that right he's got it laid up for every generation hallelujah amen and it brings the same results staggering like drunk men filled with the spirit signs and wonders brother Brown in another place said the same Holy Ghost which was a type that fell on the day of Pentecost will continue the same until the Millennium sets in men will still have the Holy Ghost and the same things will take place all the way through until the Millennium age and you say man and if you'll notice that Manna is not contaminated it's hidden minute it's the original it's not contaminated with Creeds and dogmas and traditions of men it's not it's not contaminated with unbelieving spirits it's not it's not contaminated with the god saying well yeah you can't do that that's not supposed to be today and this ain't supposed to be happening that ain't and then putting rules to what the Holy Ghost can do can you say amen that's right if it's in the Bible the Holy Ghost still does it if they can do it you can do it I believe if Peter walked on the water you can do it hello and I ain't even going to spiritualize all that I I I'm saying if you need a literal uh a way to get over some water for some reason God can sow anoint you to you walk on that water or he can park the waters I don't care how he does it he just still can do them things God is God and you say Amen you love him so again it was word bread that fell on the day of Pentecost and Peter identified in the word as to what was taken place notice the people that were on the sidelines were All Amazed and we're in doubt saying to one another what meaneth this others mocked it saying these men are full of new wine but Peter in Acts 2 15 said these are not drunken as you supposing it is but the third hour of the day but notice but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel so he identified the experience with the word and you say Amen so showing that it was word bread that fell that day now we we quoted it uh but the church the prophet said the church natural don't want to be pregnated with the word because them screaming hollering blabber in Acts 2 38 miserable creatures she thinks they are see it's the only it's the only kind that the word can produce she don't want that being pregnant with that word and I'll be honest with you I don't care what age you're in and what word we're in and all of that that's what the word produces not some intellectual Bunch or crowd of people that we just sit there without an experience then you say Amen it produces it the word produces it screaming that's what the prophet says screaming hollering blabbering Acts 2 38 right you can amend that now that's what your Prophet said don't we won't we won't twist that we won't misinterpret that that's what the brother Branham said that's the only kind that the word can produce and the prophet says again the modern Church doesn't want any of this here screaming shouting tongues speaking Acts 2 38 youngins around her see she don't want any of them whooping and crying and screaming amen hallelujah she doesn't want that but that was the manna that fell and that's the manner that you can partake of that's not contaminated that's not what came from a Pentecostal age that came from a Pentecostal experience and you say Amen you love him the Lord is so wonderful amen now I'm getting ready to close but the prophet said he started on the day of Pentecost to build another Masterpiece The Original Seed word seed word started in the first church what was it the seed word the word manifest did everybody say the word manifested the promise that had been given see so the seed had perfect life in it because it was the life of Jesus Christ and the prophet said the life that was in Jesus was in the first church and they taught the pure word of God it wasn't mixed with denominations it wasn't mixed with traditions this was the original Church and you say man so their faith wasn't in the Creed it wasn't in a Dogma but it was in the presence of Jesus Christ brother Brown said they had Faith to heal the sick cast out Devils do Miracles and we still have that faith and all the great promises that Jesus made that first church held on to that now where he said it was there it was the lifeline ain't that right now we know that we're in an age where it's going to require greater Faith than ever but you cannot have that greater Faith than ever and deny white little faith they had if they had a faith to heal the sick we ought to have the faith to heal the sick as well if they had the faith to cast out Devils we must have that Faith as well brother Graham said we want to have faith for rapture we can't even have faith for a headache you understand what I'm saying so so the faith grows the faith has grown to where we're actually receiving the greatest Faith ever than any church age or whatever it's the it's the greatest for this is rapturing age and it has rapturing faith amen well praise the Lord all right if the musicians will come how do we know that it was a word seed because everything they'd done was based on the word how was it a word seed that was planted everything they'd done was based on the word can you say man now again there are people that don't believe in Divine Healing that ain't word seed they don't believe in speaking in tongues that's not word seed they don't believe in laying hands on the sick they don't believe in casting out Devils it's that's not word seed and you say man because look what was the first commission that Jesus gave his disciples Matthew 10 and 1 and when he had called unto him his twelve disciples he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out and heal all manner of sickness and all manner disease so the very first thing the prophet said of the Gospel is Divine Healing and casting out Devils ain't that right so he says then says what was the commission that Jesus gave to the church the last commission Mark 16 15 and he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature mm-hmm he that Believers and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that belief and you say Amen how many believers do we have we got Believers now that we we may be very few out in the world as far as worldwide a man Believers and that's why we ain't got healing campaigns and all of these things and and and that that that was that was for brother Brandon's Ministry if you want to put it that way uh and we'll get it more into that but but but every believer this is talking about to believers this ain't talking about worldwide this is talking if you're a Believer this is what follows then you say Amen see we're preaching the gospel ain't that right not just playing tapes we're preaching the gospel rotary we're called to that and no man gonna take us out of the pulpits and when we preach the gospel pastors evangelists teachers apostles profits you're preaching the gospel these things happen to everyone that believeth ain't that right in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and so what was the last thing heal the sick and cast out devils that is the message to the church ain't that right these signs shall follow every creature in all the world that is a Believer they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues that's a promise to every age not just to the day of Pentecost but every believer can you say Amen oh do you love him I hope it's helped you today amen oh I love him Lord is so good to us there's ever a time to be on fire for the lord it's now is there is ever a time to believe in the power of God it's now we're being challenged on every Hand by Devils whether in your mind whether it's trying to eat come to your children your spouse whether you're you're you're dealing with them at work at school and wherever it's at demons just everywhere and and the prophet already told us how it was Unleashed can you say man and and it's Unleashed in the Civil uh what is it the ecclesiastical rim and these things and if we don't believe that that that in in casting Devils out we're going to stand helpless we don't believe that we have that same power ain't that right then then we're going to just stand helpless but I I if I can just encourage you and and to bring to your remembrance that you are a believer you don't have to knock down to the devil you don't have to you don't have to answer to him you don't have to let him just defeat you and and just look like it's all hopeless even if your back is against the wall and you don't know what to do you still have hope can you say man for you're a believer speak the word speak it the promises are for you can you say Amen oh I love the Lord amen what song are we consume me yes oh come soon Me Lord with the fire of your spirit soon Me Lord make me just like you
