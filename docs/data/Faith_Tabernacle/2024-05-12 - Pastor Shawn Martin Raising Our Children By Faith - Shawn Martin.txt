glad for that amen it's the only way our lives can prosper it's the only way we can flourish in him just like the the rod uh that they put in it was just an old dead Rod but when they put it in the presence of the Lord it was God vindicating it and that's that's how our lives are Vindicated when we stay in his presence it's not about how smart we are how talented that that has nothing to do with Vindication but when he comes and vindicates us our lives flourish in his presence I'm so glad for that amen it's good to be here this morning prise the Lord amen and um the musicians can be dismissed

children have already moved out and uh it's just you and your husband again uh but thank you for your service and and and um uh raising your children amen and um uh Hebrews the 11th chapter and I'm just going to read the 23d verse by faith Moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment amen amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer Lord Jesus father we're so glad that we could come in your presence Lord this morning Father and we could call you our father knowing that we're your children and Lord we're just asking that you would just speak now now father help me to get myself out of the way pray Lord that um if there's any Sins not under the blood we'd ask that you'd forgive us all of our sins Lord and father May the word have its way here this morning and be able to draw us closer bless every mother this morning Father just with a special blessing we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated this morning and uh just to speak to your mothers for a few moments but um I guess if I would have a title it would be raising our children by faith and um I uh I believe that you mothers are are very special um you are Priceless even as you become more invaluable Priceless As Time continues uh the world is getting darker and it'll just continue to get more darker and you become more of a a jewel um in my in my estimation and um it is sad that Mother's Day has become commercialized um and uh it's kind of lost its meaning uh just just as anything uh Christmas and Easter it's you know it doesn't hold the value that it should have and it's all just become commercialized and things but I I I thank God uh for you mothers and and not just because you you raising your children children or you have raised but I appreciate the fact thatth you are raising them or have raised them to serve the Lord amen and but I go even further than just that because maybe many many mothers uh today have introduced uh what they uh would believe Christ to be and they've introduced their children to church or religion or whatever but I think what separates you and sets you apart is that you're not just telling your children of Christ of 2,000 years ago amen of what he done and how he lived and and things like that but uh and you're you're not just taking them uh to a history lesson in the Bible and and uh and that that's fine but uh uh to me you have recognized the day in which you have are living in amen and I think that's important amen um that uh uh that our children can be raised right not just by pointing them to scriptures and and telling them a history but to to recognize that that something is happening today amen but also not only have you recognized the day in which you're living in but you have also recognized uh the importance of your child being here in this age at this time amen and I I I think that's what separates you from any other other mother uh around uh and this is exactly what Moses's mother was able to do um uh she recognized uh the time that she was living in and she recognized the importance of her child uh uh for as as we we read that that both uh moses' parents saw that he was a proper child the prophet said they saw that their child was predestinated foreordained and was elected by God amen and and so this a lot of mothers that day uh in that age and and and having children and but this this couple this mother uh uh she she recognized value in in her child and and could place him strategically for the the age that they were living in and and that he wasn't just a a normal child just any child and and so she recognized that her her responsibility was greater amen because of the child that she had borne and and so uh uh you see both parents had been praying to God uh to send a deliverer and so the prophet said if you'll notice that their prayers was exactly with scriptures exactly with script R they had an understanding of scripture amen and and so their prayers was according to this the scriptures and I think if there's ever a a people that have an understanding of scripture it is us today amen far beyond any other age because the book has been open and our understanding has been made clearer it's it's it's it's it's it's it's a it's just Grace that we can take the scriptures and not look at it as as it has been looked at Through the Ages and so many millions are looking at this Bible in the same light that the other ages but the lamb has come forth and has opened the book to us and and so therefore our understanding is made clearer it requires a different action it requires a different way of life it requ re Ires a different prayer it requires different message it requires different action because now we have an understanding of the age we're living in we we have an understanding of what God is after we have an understanding of these not only for us not only for our church but for our children amen right amen so their prayers the prophet said were with the promised word see they weren't praying for God and if IID said in in our uh term today they weren't praying for God to send them you know an NBA star a NFL you know football player they they they weren't asking God to send them a genius they they weren't asking God to to make their child wealthy they were just praying according to what God had promised and and in that day God promised to send a deliverer ain't that right they they they they were looking for a deliverer and that was with what God had promised God had promise to deliver he didn't promise you know that that uh he would send a genius to them he didn't promise amen that he had send some uh uh Financial guide to them he promised them a deliverer and when they began to pray for a deliverer God answered their prayer and she become the mother of a deliverer Lord that's right she recognize and so you know we don't want to be like so many parents today who are praying against what God has promised for this day amen look we know by the message of the hour and again we're so blessed to have a prophet and to be setting under the message and to be able to believe it but we're living in a day where the world is falling apart how many believes that amen we're living in a day where God promised to shake not only the heavens or the Earth but the the heavens also is that right we're living in a day where that all all that can be shaken will be shaken and that which remains will remain we're living in that dayen th this has been promise after promise after promise now we're living here we can say this day these scriptures are being fulfilled right before our eyes we're living in a day where we we and I I'm saying we as the elect of God are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken do you believe that we're we're no longer looking at these scriptures and saying it's going to come it's going to come it's going to come it's happening and by the grace of God we can recognize what is taking place before our eyes this isn't something to play with this is something that is real it's it's happening it's it's scriptures that have been laying dormant for years and people have fussed about and argued about and tried to figure it out and it's happening right before us that's that's right we shouldn't pray for God to make our children something great in this world Amen we shouldn't even spend the efforts and time to try to make our children uh uh you to where they have a great name in this life so many people spending their time and investing their children into sports investing their children into schools investing their children into to to Hollywood investing their children and so many things you understand what I'm saying but we shouldn't pray for God to make our children something great I in in this world and and I'm not saying that they should be dumb and ignorant I ain't saying that at all but there's a promise there is a promise what good is it to have them to have wealth when we know that this world is falling apart the economy is sinking and there ain't no president that's going to help it there ain't nothing that's going to help this thing this ship is sinking amen Millions of people don't even know that but by God's grace we've been given a prophet to let us know the time the age that we're living in Amen in Matthew 24:12 Jesus speaks of this day and how do we know he speaks of this day because a prophet said it was for this day and and and and he speaks of this day saying because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold can you say amen and brother ad would say he says in this last age selflove selflove that's why you can't correct people anymore that's that's why you can't you you you you you can't get people to to involve themselves in the things of God because it's self-love if it's too hard for them they don't want to do it if it's too strous they don't want to do it they don't want to put any effort to the kingdom of God anymore a lot of people don't want to put effort to keep their marriage together a lot of people don't even want to put effort in in raising their children it's selflove ain't that right and love for material things will take the place of the true love of God so many excuses of why people can't come to church you know what people used to not do that then in in the days of to come but it happens in this day and it's actually to be accepted as the truth like we're supposed to believe this and to say anything contrary to it that everybody gets offended to it amen so many so so many things see but the love for material things will take the place of the true love of God we need to guard against the power of sin in these last days can you say Amen not only the preachers but fathers and mothers and and and lay members and and whoever you are we need to guard against this this this power of sin in these last days brother Bram goes on to say so many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effect of this last day Spirit hello that's right so many are are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effect of this last day Spirit it is time to draw n to God everybody say it is time we we're not looking for another generation it's now it is time to draw near to God can you say Amen it ain't nothing to us to pass it on to another generation hello we got to recognize our day we're standing here recognizing the day that we're living in a prophet is telling us the day that we're living in amen it is time to draw nigh to God and let him fill our lives with his love or we will feel the coldness of the last day church and reject the truth of God which alone is able to help us can you say Amen brother brandham talked on the invasion of the United States and and our schools it's changed a the environment has so changed to where it's more easier to sin it's more easier to think corrupt it's more easier to deny the word of God it's because the environment has changed can you say amen amen see and and so uh uh you you see when an evil spirit comes in it creates its own environment yes it that's why people don't don't they don't recognize the spirit thereof they they can't humble themselves to the word there's something wrong that has created that type of an environment Christians always humble themselves to the word of God Amen do you believe that yes sir brother Braham says you take a man that's a good moral man and let him marry a woman that ain't worth a dime it isn't long till he isn't worth a dime either yeah see and he says that can be vice versa see and it's because that that individual has come under a certain environment I'm going somewhere see and and and so brother Brown said you know he talked of uh uh lovely mothers that he knew and that had that live in an atmosphere or environment of a husband that drinks and things like that and and and they they they thought they thought that they could change that individual they thought they they could help him amen by marrying him and and before you know it she becomes a drunk she becomes a uh uh uh no good whatever you understand what I'm saying see and he says see now the mother and all them are drinking and carrying on he said the environment they came into change them are you with me amen see and and this is what's happening what what what is causing the homosexuals what's causing the the transgender what's causing people to fall away from the truth what's causing people to be so unsteady anymore what what's causing people Amen to look at the the the worldly things as as something greater value than the word it's the environment amen it's an environment and people don't even know they're being rocked asleep and they don't know that they're change the environment has changed their convictions it's it's changed their ideas it's changed them to where they think Sports can help their child more than the word of God amen or television or whatever you want to call it amen the environment and brother Bram said now he said what is it it's the devil it's the devil The Invasion he swept into this nation like a roaring land he set himself down here in the best place they had in Hollywood he said I can get the movies here until the television comes on then I'll get them and he sat down there and the people instead of shutting down the shows and not letting setting their children go they give them 10 cents on a Sunday afternoon and send them down there so they can have a little social party and be out to their C and ride around oh what a disgrace now they just turn the tele now they just turn the television on and watch all the dirty rotten Tommy rot there is in the world on it can you say amen amen then we find uh uh uh um uh the divorce cases are on a rise like never before motherhood is broken brother BR say mothers don't stay home no more with their children like they used to they got to have a job you understand what I'm saying and and and and to me it's a flat shame that girls have become in the message have become so career-minded amen more than just stand with what the prophet taught they're they're more career-minded they're worried about careers they're worried about and they always have this excuse well what if my husband amen uh uh uh what if he becomes ill amen and what about this why are you looking at all them things for didn't god promise to provide the needs amen see we're no longer living by faith anymore we're living by intellect amen it's a shame you know to see the young mothers pating their children off on someone else so that they can you know fulfill their their their career and and all these things brother Bram says it's such an hour of prostitution at hand the devil's done told them that they're the boss of the house talking about women they'll make their own way they'll do what they wish to and you get it out of them if you can he said there's only one thing you can uh that can get it out of them and that's the altar before Jesus Christ an oldfashioned tear streaming religion that'll break their hearts and tear them to pieces and make them what they ought to be the problem is people's hearts don't get hard uh soft anymore they don't cry they don't they they ain't broken up anymore and it's just the truth why the environment's changed can you say Amen it's just truth no wonder it's hard to be a real mother and and uh uh in this age to really teach your children the way of the message and the way that God wants them to be raised it is so hard and that's why I say you're more invaluable than you realize you're worth more than anything amen amen that's right and if you husband you got a mother like wife like that teaches your children you ought to respect them to the highest if you have a mother like that you ought to respect them amen but so many are living under the environment of this leodys and age but see Malachi 4 is the reason that we're not part of this amen see that God would set us apart go God would would he he he would put a distinguishing line between the world and his elect and that could only be by Malachi 4 hello for Malachi 4:5 I'm going to read it we know it but behold I will send you Elijah the prophet for the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and He Shall everybody say he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the children of the uh the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse now we know we know that this sixth verse was isn't fulfilled all at once uh uh it's got a two-fold uh uh purpose there John the Baptist was sent to turn the heart of the fathers to the children ain't that right Luke 1:13 but the angel said unto him fear not Zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name John 16th verse and many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord God his message would turn them to the Lord Our God their God and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children hello so Malachi 4:6 is speaking of the two comings of Elijah the first time it was John the Baptist coming to turn the hearts of the the fathers to the children and and what what do you mean fathers brother Brown said it was the old patriarch fathers the Jews right the old Jews to the faith of the children right that's right Peter James John Matthew amen all all them that believed in Jesus Christ amen see he was there to turn that see and believed of the coming uh of Messiah see now so that was John but today God would send us a prophet and I know these saying but don't let it just slip You by we don't want a generation to raise up not know KN who brother brandham was and the importance of what he was to this age he was a prophet sent from God Amen not just to have a Ministry but to turn your heart back that's you believe that now this Prophet The Prophet said has taken in this day has taken the P the message of Pentecost and with that message turned us us the children back to our Pentecostal Apostolic fathers can you sayen brother ramam said see he'll be taken the message of Pentecost to turn the children to the faith of the fathers Apostolic fathers not Jewish fathers Apostolic fathers Pentecost fathers not not on ausa street but all the way back at the days of Acts can you say Amen because he'll re he'll be Reb rebuking them because that they didn't keep this same faith that was back there at the beginning so he takes us this prophetic message of Malachi 4 has the power and the ability to turn us back to the same faith that was once delivered there is no other message outside this message that'll take you back can you say Amen thank you Lord God so the prophet of Malachi 4 has come to change our environment change the atmosphere that we've been living in an atmosphere of unbelief change it to an atmosphere of Faith an atmosphere of hopeless change it back to an atmosphere of an environment of of of absolute Victory amen can you say Amen yes sir amen Church he's come to even to change our atmosphere and our environment of corruption to incorruption from Mortal to immortality this is what the prophet of Malachi 4 has come to do is to change us not to make us another church member amen you remember the little eaglet living in the chicken pinise Lord see he was living in an Earthly environment living in a total environment that he was not made to live in but then he heard Mama scream Hallelujah ain't that right and it not only caused him to recognize his who he was that it caused him to change his environment he lived from an went from an Earthly environment to a Heavenly environment he went from just scratching around and and things that he was not made to do he was not created to be Amen to where he can now go back to what God had created him can you say amen and that's exactly what this message has come to do it has called us back to what God had in his mind in the beginning true Sons true daughters with authority with Dominion not giving into the devil not being defeated but Victorious Overcomers over every devil over every situation amen that comes our way that's what you are made to do that is what a prophet of Malachi 4 has come to do change our environment everybody say change my environment he's come to change your environment you don't have to live in depression amen listen to a prophet amen there's power in this message to change you amen from depression to Victorious amall yes sir y not to make you an Earthbound chicken if you're living like that hear the voice hear the voice of Mama Eagle can you say Amen man you'll never find what is in you until you really truly listen humble yourself to the word of the age humble yourself to the word of the hour can you say amen amen don't argue with Mama amen don't argue with that voice that voice is telling you come up obey iten start flapping your wings praise the Lord till you rise above it all Hallelujah so he got out of that o old Earthbound environment why because the voice Mama Screaming made him realize this is not where I belong amen notice now brother Brown said the message of this great Messenger right now Malachi 4 that'll come in this closing day in the L odyssean Church age the Pentecostal age will'll be the one everybody say we'll be the one not we'll be one of those but we'll be the one that'll take the church to the Rapture that's right are you with me now yes he will this is the age of rapture may we recognize our day now the world is preparing for tribulation that's right and the prophet says now they they have no hope they're going in Tribulation so what are they doing to to stoke to to stifle their fears comedy entertainment that's right the world putting her nose in all kinds of nonsense brother can you say Amen why to hide from the wrath of God that's coming but you don't have to put yourself in that you don't have to invest your time and all of that because that's not your lot God placed you under a message that if you had believe this message it'll take you home it'll take you it'll rra you out of here now if this is the age of rapture and we recognize the day that we're living in why would we as parents invest our children's time in politics why would we invest our children's time in television Hollywood why would we invest let let them be invest their time into video games and entertainment and we all know that them are voices that are drowning out the voice of God am there's so many voices out in the in the land today that is literally the prophet said that is drowning out the voice of God you don't want your child sitting in a message church and really can't be moved by a message I I see adults that way they can't even be moved anymore because they've given into voices of Gossip voices of this voices of that voices of that and they can sit in a message church and it doesn't even move them then they become just Topsy Turvy and and all of these things you don't want your children that way that's right Hallelujah hello you see if the prophet of Malachi for's message doesn't affect you or doesn't affect the people then you know what happens they won't return to the faith cuz there's nothing else that's going to do it you you you know it's it's sometimes we'll call it for Comfort Comfort everybody wants Comfort these days comfort comfort you know I I uh I we've been you know since we've been putting up that tent and working last month or so I've gained a little weight hate to say it now my dear Mother though she she really gave me lifted me up today she said it looks like you're still losing but I had to confess I said no but but that I appreciate my mother and and but you know my wife told me said well it's Comfort Foods you know and I'm like well you're right maybe that's it just Comfort Foods I see that donut I got to get comforted you know and and then I I see the the dingdong and I got to get comforted you know and then I I see this and I see that and I I find comfort you know and and uh and and I I think this is what is is happening is is we're being comforted by so many things today and we think that that our children needs to be comforted now listen I I know it's an onslaught that we're we're coming into today it the lid of hell has been P lifted lifted off demons are pouring in they're streaming in the prophets already said this years ago and we're feeling them effects are we not and and and and but but here's the thing is we try to comfort our ourselves and not only ourselves but our children in in the things of the world and Satan's got so many things out there to offer some type of comfort but it's not good for your health hello it's literally uh you're decreasing in faith you're decreasing in godliness you're and you're becoming more people are becoming more Earthbound than they are Heavenly bound true true brother and it's slipping into the churches today now we all know that that God promised we preached what a few Wednesdays ago that God promised us comfort and there's only one comfort that is good for us and sents it himself he said I'll send the Comfort it'll be the spirit of Truth can you say amen and and the fact that God would send the spirit of Truth in this day with the Voice of Truth open the word to us and let us know that you don't belong in this world you belong up there you are always with me before the foundation of the world that ought to be our comfort that's the best Comfort we can have Amen brother amen that's the truth now if the prophet's message does not affect nothing will no nothing will bring us closer to God than the message of the hour am and not just saying I will go to a message church but actually this message is headship it leaves no room for nothing else it's head chip amen you could take you know used to we could take commentators and we could read what they have to say and we would add that to our sermon and and we would take this commentator add it to the sermon and we'd take this and add it oh they were all nice and then we piece our thought you know and come up with a good old thought you know but that's not the way with the message amen we we don't just cut listen to the message to get a good thought to preach on we listen to this message to submit Our Lives to it's going to change us see well but if it doesn't affect and if it doesn't affect people then they will fulfill the prophecy given for this lotsy and age they will become lovers of pleasure and lovers of self more than lovers of God that's a promise for this age for the world they will become truth Breakers and false accusers and incontinent that's a promise for the world for this day they will become lukewarm being neither cold nor hot they'll come into a condition their churchgoers their religion they even confess God and all that but they live in such a rotten condition that God wants to spew them and says I will spew them from my mouth in other words they'll not speak for me they'll not be my part of my word they'll not be part of anything amen see and and and and and so that's the condition that's the promise for the world today can you sayen now we recognize then as people that are under the message that have been called out amen how many's been called out amen praise the Lord you believe that what called you out because you liked a preacher you liked a certain church so you thought well I'll just go there I I just like whatevers no there's a scripture that says come out of her my people come out of her come out of her my people God sent that voice yes he does that voice is the voice of this Prophet that would call out come out come out come out and he would identify his message with that of elaser to go get a bride for is that's true can you say Amen so then if if you've been called out then you realize that God has called you for in this age to be his bride a virtuous bride sinless bride a word bride word bride not a not a not a philosophy bride not a bride of theology a word bride perfect word that's why God Vindicated this man can you say Amen that you would know that it ain't just him speaking that's God speaking directly to you come out of her there's a power behind this message to shape you and to mold you to keep you out of this world to keep you out of the muck and the mire amen and to keep you and to throw off all them demons that are trying to latch on to you amen amen praise God if we recognize that for us what about our children amen see we recognize that our children are our Offspring and they're special they are not meant for this leysan age amen amen do you understand me they are not meant for this Le oysan age they are not meant to be what brother brandham called Canon fodder everything outside is Canon fod our children are not meant to be part of that Canon fod can you say amen and if we believe that and we know that then we know that we are not to raise them as such amen we are not to parent them as though they're just common blowjo you know and this and that and just little old Suzie QQ and little old this and whatever we are a god a responsibility sir Proverbs 22 and6 hope this is all right but 226 says train up a child in the way he should go when he's old he will not depart from it amen then that means that we should know which way our CH children should go we should know how dangerous it is out in the world we should know what kind of spirits are out there in them games and what kind of spirits are out in them movies and what kind of spirits are out in the entertainments and what kind of spirits are out there in in our in in the in our friends homes and and what you understand what I'm saying what kind of Spirits amen that our children are hanging around and this and that and this and and all of these things amen we ought to train up a child in the way should go and when he is old he will not depart from it Joel 1:1 the word of the Lord that came to Joel the son of uh pthu uh I guess that's how you'd say that hear this ye old men and give ear all ye inhabitants of the land hath this been in your days or even in the days of your fathers tell ye your children of it notice this tell you tell ye your children of it and let your children tell their children and their children another generation can you say Amen see so children are a blessing to us a blessing to us everybody say they're my blessing children are a blessing why because God want has given you your children Amen to to that they could tell of the acts of God they a tell of the promises of God you're obligated I'm obligated to teach my children of the promis don't teach them Dave Crockett don't teach them you know what the prophet says amen that they children these days know more about Davey Crockett than they do about every you know the Daniel and the Lion's Den that's right they can quote they they they can tell you the movies they can tell you country songs rock androll songs ungodly songs they can tell you about everything ungodly come on now every about every sports player and and the NFL and and the national league and this and that I don't know what all out there but they can tell you what about Malachi 4 that's true hello tell you your children of it don't let the devil take your time up tell ye your children of it and let your children tell their children this thing's got to be passed on and they're children another generation ain't that right now notice Exodus 24:12 and the Lord said unto Moses come up unto me into the mount and be there and I will give thee tables of stone and a law and Commandments which I have written that thou May teach them Deuteronomy 66 and The Words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and sht talk of them when thou s sest in thine house and when thou wst by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up ain't that right so we have to teach them everybody say we got to teach them teach who these little Rugrats that are running around teach them teach them those that we just seem to get in our hair and under our feet and and in the way all the time teach them amen teach them to be faithful to the house of God teach them not to use [Applause] excuses hello teach them teach them to forgive teach them to respect the Servants of God teach them to walk in humility teach them to overcome when Satan is Waring against them teach them to abstain from all appearance of evil and fleshly lust which war against the soul teach them the value of this message am if you don't know the value of it how are you going to teach them teach them that it's the message of Grace and not of law teach them to take God at his word regardless amen teach them teach them can you say amen Amen brother Bram said mother is first with the child and she's a great responsibility of what that child will be will be based upon the way that mother starts that child on the on the path that it must travel mother has the responsibility from God to place that child on the right Road and I think that's why mothers has a special little touch that right another place children are Little Treasures that God has given you the responsibility of raising and I've always said and made this kind of a saying to mothers we know written a four gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John but there's a Fifth Gospel Unwritten that's mother she gets them before Matthew Mark Luke and John's teaching gets them see so the responsibility is placed upon you mothers and you fathers to raise these children to the afford the kingdom of God can you say Amen am amen now thinking of of Moses's mother and what Moses was and she recognized that he was a prophet recognize that he was to be a deliverer but our children you know our children may not be born to be a prophet may not be born to be a deliverer like Moses was do but they don't have to be a prophet they don't have to be a deliverer they don't even have to sing they don't have to be musicians hello amen the entire body of Christ isn't made up of just prophets or the fful ministry it isn't just made up of of of singers and musicians or whatever the Bible teaches us that there's one body in many members of that body amen ain't that right uh Corinthians 12: 15 if the word if the foot shall say because I'm not of the hand uh uh I am not of the body is it therefore not of the body and if the ear shall say because I am not the eye I am not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the whole body were an eye then where were the hearing if the whole were the body was the hearing where were the smelling see but now God has Set uh uh the members every one of them in the body as it has pleased him amen I want to tell you young people you're important yes sir amely you're important amen you're important to God you're important to the body of Christ you're important to this local assembly amen amen I consider her children to be a crop a harvest that has been planted Genesis 1:26 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image and in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the FL fou of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth is that right now they were not just to have children on but they were to have children like unto themselves Adam came by the spoken word and he was to bring children by the same way by the spoken word ain't that right amen see see when God plants the seed it should always bring forth of what he planted bring forth of its kind when God planted the Pentecostal seed on the day of Pentecost that's exactly what he intended it to be amen every generation every age should be a Pentecostal church just like the day he planted amen that's right if it brings forth anything else then we know that it's been tampered with ain't that right Eve Eve brought forth a hybrid crop she brought forth something different from the word of God and we know every denomination is is a product of hybridization it it it did not come from the original it it shows that something was hybrid and that is the result of it and hybriding always brings forth death ain't that right see and so Eve got away from the word and the natural church has gotten away from the word of God and it's brought forth nothing but illegitimate children illegitimate to the word I believe the prophet would say it that way illegitimate to the word in other words they don't know what the word is they don't know who their their their their father and mother is spiritually can you say amen Amen brother Braham said a hybrid crop is a dead crop yes it is I pray the Lord just plant that into our hearts a hybrid crop is a dead crop talking to a man the other day you know he's ons to a certain denomination he telling me so our our our church is dying our young people that we ain't got any we we don't know what we're going to do why you hybrid the word you kill it you bring forth hybridization you cannot bring forth another generation somewhere it's got to die sure amen so he said see a hybrid crop is a dead a dead crop far as rebreeding it won't rebreed itself it can't cuz God said so it has to bring forth of its kind and you've mixed it and you can see the church right there we're going to wind up he says it died there for it cannot bring forth of its kind why it's mixed you can't do nothing with it it's dead it's finished are you with me come on the moment we hybrid experiences all right the moment we substitute the Holy Ghost for something else you died and what does it do it not only affects your life it affects your children's life hello true right now the Luther Revival finished it's dead because it brought forth a hybrid crop Wesley Pentecostal revivals they f because they brought forth hybrid crop and they will never the prophet said they will never have a Revival again right they might have a gathering but never a Revival again of the true move of God can you say Amen but look by the message of the hour the perfect word has been restored to us again the perfect word that we don't have to put our own interpretation we don't have to guess at it we just simply believe it it's brought us back to being Sons and Daughters of God again spoken Sons spoken word daughters amen back to sunship again but not only is the word for us it's for our children do you believe it amen that's right God forbid that this Revival Brides Revival die with us we must not be at ease in Zion notice and I'm going to close here shortly but I do want to get it to you but notice the danger that we Face according to history looking at the history of Israel we see that Revival would come in one generation then the prophet shows us that that when the next Generation come the Revival started dying the fire started uh fading and in the third generation Embers may be glowing slightly but in the fourth there may be no Trace no Trace whatsoever of the original flame then after a time God would light that fire again and the same process is repeated yes Amen brother Ram says it is simply the manifestation of the truth that God has no grandchildren right can you say that with me God has no grandchildren God has no grandchildren right right the same experience that you it took for you it takes for your children amen are you with me amen people think that we got a better age today because you know our children are just got it so much better we didn't have television you know and so so you know we all had to go outside and play with sticks and all that but now bless the God blessed us you know we can now give them the television where they don't have to go out in the Heat and they got video games so they don't have to go out and use their imagination with the sticks and and all of these things no that's a curse amen amen all together I think so anyway true great so he said see God has no grandchildren salvation is not passed on by natural birth anymore than is there any truth to Apostolic succession it isn't in the word you start out with truly Born Again Believers and when the next Generation comes along they are no longer just plain Christians but they have taken a denominational name and are now are Baptist Methodist Etc that is exactly what they are too they are not Christians you have to be born of the will of God not the will of man to be saved so this is exactly what happened in the first church age I believe it what the first church age started 30 some years 50 some years after the day of Pentecost and already at that at just at that little short time God is rebuking that age saying you've left your first love why the fire started dying Amen brother Braham said see the original fire had died down and they weren't the same anymore the fervent desire to please God the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out in the spirit all began to fade and instead of that church being on fire with the fire of God it had cooled off and became a bit formal and he said the abandonment to God had died out and the people weren't too careful about what God thought of them as they began to be careful about what the world thought of them ain't that right brother Brown says when the church thinks more of conforming to the world instead of conforming to God it isn't long until you see them stop doing the things they used to do and start doing things they wouldn't do initially they changed their manner of dress their attitudes their behavior and they get lacks yes amen he says that cycle of Revival and death has never failed all you have to do is recall this last move of God in the spirit when men and women dressed like Christians went to church prayed all night took to street corners and weren't ashamed of the manifestations of the spirit he said see the church at Ephesus Ephesus they left their old dead churches and worshiped in homes or old store buildings they had reality but it wasn't too long a time until they began to get enough money to build new fine churches see and they put in a choir instead of singing unto God for themselves they put gowns on the choir and they organized a movement and ran it by man and they soon began to read books that weren't fit to read and they let down bars the bars and goat the goats came in and took over the Cry Of Joy was gone the freedom of the spirit was gone oh they kept on with the form but the fire had died down and the Blackness of Ashes is about all that is left that's true that was the first church age and in each age it has happened the the cycle of Revival and death has happened and now we're here in the worst stage of them all the Le oysan age where Jesus says it's the only age that God would tell them you're blind wretched miserable naked and don't know it amen but as we've said Revelations 18:4 and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues that's right how many's come out I've come out Hallelujah now you know why you come out it's death out there you come out of death into life don't look back and look for that for your children your children cannot be comforted by them things don't teach them that they can be don't put an impression that they can be they're going to go through discouragement but teach them the way of the Lord amen amen see we haven't been grandfathered in we had to receive an experience yeah but what about our children I do not believe that God has called us to bring forth a hybrid crop God forbid that we do that's right brother amen God gave us our children amen Psalms 1273 low children are in Heritage of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward you realize that by the message of the hour and I know we've brought it before and you could go listen to the the the series of adoption and and so many other sermons uh uh but but we we have been brought over into the land of adoption this is not just a saying this is absolute truth this is facts this is reality amen we've been brought over into the land of adoption what is that it was the promised land we are living in the Ephesus again I I think it's Paradox in 64 that or 62 62 or 64 he preached it three or four times but but brother Brown talks about that that we are living in the Ephesus Age Again an Ephesians age and he Compares that with the age of Joshua when Joshua by his message brought Israel over into the promised land and not just let him run wild he placed them strategically positionally in their inheritance that's right amen it was then they could possess the land it was then they could defeat their Giants it was then that they could say this land belongs to us it's then that God they could see the reality of every promise that God had made them that's right yes sir can you say Amen so we have been brought over by the message of the hour into the promised land this age of adoption and are being positionally placed in our inheritance now see the land was their inheritance and I want you to I want to read this brother Brown said see it was such a great thing that the inheritance how it was that in and inheritance in the land notice that no one else but a close Kinsman could redeem that inheritance no one but a close Kinsman could redeem that inheritance now after he says that notice what he says right after oh now just let me drop a little token here that I touched on the other night to you mothers how many here has prayed for your loved ones lost all right there you go are again your inheritance amen what's your inheritance your children that's right that's your inheritance amen hallelujah Paul told the Roman said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou and thy house shall be saved if you've got enough faith for your own self to be saved have faith enough no matter how Wayward that boy is or that girl is they'll be saved anyhow God somehow if he has to lay them on their back laying there in the hospital dying they'll be saved God promised it that's the inheritance hall now notice here's the promise now remember Moses's mother recognized the promise over her child she connected her child with the promise yes and she acted on by faith yes now notice the promise for you Isaiah 65:17 for behold I create new heavens and a new Earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mine but be ye glad and rejoice forever in that which I create for behold I create Jerusalem a rejoicing in her people a joy and I will rejoice in Jerusalem and joy in my people and the voice of weeping shall no more be heard in her for the voice nor the voice of crying there shall no more then an infant uh there shall be no more then an infant of days nor an old man that hath not filled his days for the child shall die 100 years old but the sinner being 100 years old shall be ACC cursed and they shall build houses and inhabit and they shall plant Vineyards and eat the fruit of them they shall not build in another inhabited inhabit they shall not plant and another eat for as the days of a tree are the days of my people and my elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands they shall not labor in vain nor bring forth for trouble they for they are the seed of the Blessed of the Lord and their offspring with them how many is the seed of the Lord amen praise God and your Offspring with you amen if if you notice Moses was born in a dangerous time it was a time when Pharaoh was putting all the children to death brother Braham said it was the devil in the form of Ramsay and he had purposed to get rid of the children with the natural death they stabbed the little ones and threw them over into the rivers for the crocodiles to eat and the crocodiles got all fattened up with them and the Hebrew children and all these things and but why why why why did he want want to kill the children is if you read it in the Bible is because the Hebrews were increasing in number increasing they they weren't diminishing they were increasing because they kept bringing on generation after generation so finally he said let's just kill the children let's kill them all off see and and so then we find that the the king set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens and they built for Pharaoh treasure cities and all these things and they ined them more and the more they inflicted them the more the children of Israel multiplied and so they the Bible says they were grieved because of the children of Israel and then we find that Pharaoh uh uh called forth the two Hebrew midwives and told him that every male child that you deliver kill it and and the Bible says that but the the women feared God and and they would not do it and God blessed them for that so then Pharaoh Exodus 1 122 he charged all his people saying every son that is born ye cast shall cast into the river and every daughter you shall save a life so there went a a a great great Slaughter throughout Egypt and it was in the time that that Moses Moses was born and but but Moses's parents as we read did not fear the Commandment of the king because they knew that their child was in the hands of God and they believe that so she built this this this little basket it was well brother BR said it was the ark it was an ark and and and by faith she done all this by Faith by faith she knew that her child was a proper Child by faith she knew that he was the deliverer by faith she she knew that he was the one that God had promised and uh she could tie it to the scriptures and it was by Faith by faith she built this basket by faith she put her baby in this this Ark and by face she she put that little Ark with the baby in it in that uh crocodile infested waters true the prophet said she built that Ark not by her own knowledge but by she was directed on how to build it and she directed it in such a way that when she put it out there them old fat alligators they were looking say m what's that smell you know and and and and smelt that boy and and and here they come to to attack it like they would any other but there was something there was a stench about it that that that pitch uh uh brother Brown said it was something about that that caused them them them alligators to stay away from that baby and it was floating that mother did it all by Faith by faith she didn't want to part from that baby she didn't want to place that baby in in that danger but by faith that's right brother that's right Lord I thinking of you mothers that have raise your children in this old dangerous World demons all around that is set there to devour you devour your children it's the most dangerous age ever in my opinion but we do not fear we don't bring fear upon our children we don't bring fear upon our household as though the devil is going to gift him but we place them in God's hands by faith we teach them by faith don't you worry about tomorrow you worry about today amen amen can you say Amen we can't protect them in Every Which Way but by faith that's true we're doing it by faith amen that's right sir they're going to make mistakes but by faith the Lord they may not show any signs of positivity toward God but by faith amen can you say amen amen I'm so glad I had parents that lived by faith that's right not only to believe God for miracles and I could go tell you story after story about how God provided things for our families through Dad mom's Faith praise the Lord filled gas dad's gas t pank up one time time had no groceries and God would provide it send someone at the door with groceries it was just constant by Faith by Faith by faith the Lord but I'm so glad I had parents that could use that same faith on me I was an honor guy prise the Lord but they would never tell me I'm honor they would never tell me just how a brat I was oh I got my share of whooping I got I got wooden paddles broke over my rum couple times that my mom and dad by faith loved me they never told me how a sorry they were that they had me they never let me you know taught me that it was the devil that would teach me I was demon-possessed that's right it was the devil that would try to tell me I was a hopeless case my parents never told me them things that's right can you say Amen they do it by faith they may have not saw any positive sign about me but by faith right right amen it was by faith can you say amen and that's the same thing with you I I remember my mom you know I had uh she says I had dry dry scalp I I'm sure I did but you know it was real pretty flaky but my mom took advantage of that you know and she may not even remember but I remember getting the olive oil out and putting me on the a chair and on the porch and uh she putting that olive oil on my head and just rubbing in my scalp and my mom and while she's doing is praying God touch Shawn God save Shawn God move upon him you know and I'm just sitting there listening to my mom praying over me and you know I found comfort in that and I you know I think Lord please do that Lord you know thank God for Mama answer her prayer I need it but but by faith everything was by faith can you say Amen do you love him see and so the prophet says they wasn't scared because they seen something in this baby to begin with they saw it that this was the answer of prayer and by faith she saw him with the children of Israel placing them over in the promised land so it was by faith can you say amen amen by Faith by the eyes of Faith the prophet said she seen what God was going to do she took him right down to the river in this little Ark no doubt we couldn't think that that was a natural act friends it's got to be a supernatural act there she was standing there with the crystal tears in her eyes as she placed her little baby as it were in the casket of death that was going to be uh to pitch it out in on the water there and of course she knew that by faith she believed that behind all the Clouds Of Darkness there was a living God who would take that baby to its destination for she seen it was a a proper child she did not let fear dictate her life dictate her actions and dictate that child it was by faith you love him we could go on and on and on but by faith if the musicians will come How Great Is Our God if I could say don't ever lose vision for your children amen don't ever if they're growned up or if they're young that's right they may be having little habits and they may have hangups don't you ever think that you got a perfect family and that your little old child is free from whatever Satan is on doing everything he can to distract that child at a young age don't think that when they get teenagers is when you start teaching them the ways of God and teaching them how to be faithful and teaching them how to you teach them right now at the very youngest age that's true when I see these little ones little Wyatt and little Autumn and these others and they're lifting their hands don't even know what they're doing I say but that's right that's the way to teach them that's what we're doing got Josiah's children there what is it it's it's teaching them the ways they may not understand what they're doing but it's teaching them the way amen I thought of this brother brah said now the reason I thought about saying this is because you people here most of you your children are saved they're Christians he said I have admired brother evans's family these young men here usually who would you get a teenager to sit around and listen to some a preacher talk why they'd be out and gone somewhere little girls like that and I said to brother Fred his kids they they can just hear me say one thing that's wrong and they're they're ready to stop it right now and set with highest respect instead of being out hot roding and rambling around see when they hear you speak about the gospel they're ready to sit right there and listen now I want I know we we all and I want you to listen he said I know we all want to think our kids is Renegades and things like that but we must stop that I believe that we must remember that these kids are the best kids in the world because they're our children and we claim them for God right amen can you say amen amen now your salvation will not save that child but now Paul said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thy and thy house shall be saved now what did he mean by that he didn't mean that because they were saved that their house would be saved with it he meant this that because they if he had enough Faith to be saved himself his same amount of faith that he had for himself would work for his children see what I mean he said now I've got my children there's my little son Joseph and Billy and Sarah and Rebecca well now I want to see each one of them a worker in the gospel doing something I want to see them saved and filled with the Holy Ghost now I've committed them to God and say I'm holding on to God for them and I believe they're going to be saved every one of them I believe they're going to be saved and I'll have them on the other side and I don't believe my salvation will save them no but my faith in God will do it notice that my faith in God will do it can you say amen amen see you see my faith believ in God will do it and will cause them to come to Christ and I believe that's where you people praying for your children that's the reason your children has the manners and the real lady and gentlemen in this wild age that we're living in yet that part about them that's the best I know of any kids see well I think that's the reason of that is because it's your prayers for them and you committed them to God and holding on can you say amen amen do you love the Lord [Music] amen so we're not we're not raising our children in hopes that they can be saved or that they will will be saved we're raising our children in the ways of the Lord believing and knowing with all of our heart that God's going to save them just as much as you believe that with all your heart that God's going to come and take you home that same faith is for your children do you love the Lord I thank God for Women of Faith for you mothers I say God bless you richly amen I trust this was a help an encouragement to you in some way you're raising them is not in vain everything that you go through is not in vain amen Satan may be attacking you in your mind and getting you discouraged and all that but remember if he can get you down he's going after your children stay strong in the Lord amen your children are looking to you more than you ever realize yeah they are we've got all kinds of mistakes as parents and any any one of you think you're perfect you know you think you could teach the older generation how to parent I say you're crazy every parent's going to have their mistakes every child is going to have their mistakes but by faith that's right brother by Faith by faith and this is where the grace of God comes in do you beloving amen what song All faith in God can move the mighty Mountain [Music]
