all in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen amen if you would have your bibles if we could turn to um John 4 St John 4 amen and St John 414 if you're there say amen amen John 4 and14 but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life and the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come hither to draw Jesus saith unto her go call thy husband and come hither the woman answered and said I have no husband Jesus said said unto her thou Hast well said I have no husband for thou Hast had five husbands and he whom thou now Hast uh is not thy husband and and that thou sayest is true and the woman saith unto him sir I perceive that thou are a prophet our fathers worshiped in this mountain and ye said that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship Jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet in Jerusalem worship the father ye worship you know what um you worship you know what you know not what you know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in Sp spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him amen if we could turn over to Hebrews we all are familiar with this uh and should all know it by heart but Hebrews 13 verse 8 Hebrews 138 says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen are you thankful for that this morning as you can be seated amen I um I have pray that this thought blesses you this morning I've um I've had nothing I I um Dad had asked me a couple weeks to take this service and um and uh so just a few days ago I texted dad and I said you're going to have to take Sunday because I don't have anything I've I had three different thoughts but nothing would come and uh he said well just just listen to messages and I said I've been listening to messages constantly constantly I said nothing will come so we finally sat down for and just calmed my spirit down and this is what just came so I pray that it just blesses you in some way this morning amen but if I were to give it a title this morning um I wasn't sure what to title it but um you know I'd like to maybe title it God is a reality um God is a living reality amen and um you know brother brandham said here that uh Jesus found the people in his day seeking a religion that would bring them a deliverance and they wanted a religion that would deliver them from all their evils and from their enemies and Christianity met every challenge that they asked for and Christian ADM everything that they needed and everything that they asked for it challenged every one of their needs but they would not receive it you know and they uh they they asked they they prayed and when Jesus came and offered his what they needed what they prayed for they couldn't receive it amen it challenged every one of their needs and it's about the same uh uh but they would not receive it and it's the same thing to in this day we find people today seeking H H uh for religion that will do something for them that'll bring a reality to them and uh in real Christianity the word meets every one of those challenges but they won't receive it amen Matthew 5:6 says blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled and today we are trying to give people we're trying to give people something that they really need a and they don't want it they don't want to accept it they don't want to receive it and yet we know that we have exactly what the world needs today we know that we have the answer for the world and it's the religion of Jesus Christ amen uh deliverance from things that they're fearing uh things that they're needing healing restoration and brother Brenham says in the days when we are here on Earth one of the reasons why that they could not receive Jesus of Nazareth and believe him and get their Deliverance because it was too unusual for them my it didn't come in the way they wanted it to come so they would not accept it it was just it was too unusual too different for them he brought his Deliverance God had sent them a deliverance and it was so unusual to them that they didn't want to accept it because it didn't come just the way that they were used to receiving religion and it's the same thing today the people are today wondering where is the god that opened the Red Sea where is the god that made the lepers well where is the god that set the captives free and we know that he is here today and yet they don't want to receive him why the the the same reason they had it was too contrary it was too unusual and in that day if he would have brought them Creeds or if he would have brought them uh uh some form that they had to go through some rituals or so forth they would have gladly received him my and and but because he brought it in a way uh in the way that he did that people didn't want to receive it in that form that he brought it and that's exactly the same today they don't want it they they they don't want to receive it on the level that God brings it and they don't want to uh go they don't want God's provided way they don't uh they want it but they don't want to receive it on the level that God brings it and and we cannot bring it down to our level of thinking we can't we can't bring it uh down to we got we got to bring it we got to bring our mind to God level of thinking amen and they don't want God's provided way and and we've got to raise oursel to his level of thinking and meet him on the grounds that he's provided for us to meet him on Amen they all use their denomination and Creeds and the Pharisees and they had Sadducees and and they had all kinds of different forms of religion in that day and each one uh had his own idea each one had their own revelation of the word and one believed it in the resurrection and dancing and and the others didn't and one believed it in ciding a Creed and the other was fine with just shaking the preacher's hand a and we would uh present that to the world today if we were to present that if we would take the message and we would just tell the world today well all you got to do is recite this greed all you got to do is just shake my hand they would gladly receive it my hand but when he come in his power and of his resurrection to make his people live and to make his people act right and believe and behave themselves and to change their attitudes to change their ways to change their way of living they don't want nothing to do with that my so they're looking for a God that will not judge them they're they're wanting to walk they're wanting to do whatever they want they want to be able to come to church and and go out the church and live any old way that they want to live and they're looking for a god of love and and we do serve a god god of love but we do serve a god of judgment and God judges Us by his word amen they're satisfied with this uh with with their uh uh religion for the week they come for church for the week and they're satisfied with that and go back and do anything that they want to do the rest of the week my but well when Jesus was born God became man that he might become uh that he might become fellowship with man and in man to what to achieve one purpose and that is to bring man what God is not what a church is but what God is Jesus came that he might present God to man amen and man can't fathom the mind of God we can't fathom the mind of God so so what did the world do today uh they they decide to build their Bible schools they decide to build their seminars to try to understand God through their intellectual thinking my and God is not known by intellectual conception God is not known by by Theology and by psychology God is known by a new birth God is known by the Holy Ghost amen not by any other way the Bible has plainly told us no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost now the holy spirit will not misbehave itself in one person and behave itself in another and behave itself in another it'll make each person come into its own into its character because it's the spirit that leads you it makes you subject to its nature amen you don't bring it subject to your nature you make it subject to its nature amen when the Holy Spirit comes in you just love to give up the things of the world oh my I remember when I was young and and I just love to do the things of the world but when we got a new birth the things of the world just melted away oh my cleanses you it washes you it puts the desire in you to follow him and to thirst and Hunger for More of it amen you're just bathing yourself amen He makes himself a reality to you my now when God placed men here and in the days of the Lord Jesus he gave him a true road map uh to his power amen amen we all know that road what a road map is we called a GPS today and I remember dad uses in the atlas Maps when we were kids we don't use that no more and thank the lord we don't use that no more heyen we just follow a GPS and if you you want to know you have a desired destination and you don't know where to go you follow that GPS until it comes in your mind and then you remember it and then you don't and then you just keep following that GPS and brother Brown says God wants you to know his word a and we know it we've traveled it we've tested it we've tried it and you know where it leads to amen now his road mapap is is his Bible the word the Bible is the road map that leads to the power of God faith leads you to the power but uh Power produces the promise amen now what does the road map point us to he would come to unite God and man together amen but the Pharisees and the fuce couldn't see that God come to unite man and and himself or God come to unite himself with man but they didn't want to receive it they couldn't understand it Pharisees and the Sadducees they couldn't all understand so they rejected it and Jesus said you Hypocrites he said that you could well discern the skies when you say it's low and red that tomorrow will be foul weather and it's fair you can discern the skies but when the signs of the time you cannot discern if you would have known me you would have known my day my it became a book knowledge to them oh they read the Scrolls they read the scriptures but they couldn't understand it all they could know and it's the same thing today we've got people who who know how to read this Bible they've read it through over and over again every year they'll in January they'll start in Genesis and at the end of the year they'll end by Revelation but they can't tell you what it means they can't tell you that that that it's become more than just words on a page amen these people they uh these these men and women can can quote the quotes and they can tell you and but they don't know the life oh my amen but because they didn't have a reality of who God was when he came they missed it amen you can quote the quotes you can read the Bible over and over again but unless God makes himself a reality to you it does no good you will still miss it yes sir amen he says at that day you'll know that I am in the father and the father in me and I in you and you in me amen he came to bring God and man together where man was made a helper to God and became uh where man was made a helper to God and became a God himself of the earth we became little Gods amen he lost his origin through sin and the Bloods of bulls and goats could not make an atonement for for this sin but the blood of Jesus Christ could do it amen God came to redeem man back to himself so he could prove himself to his to the world that He is Alive and Well in his people amen and the only way God can do that is by his word my it's God's provided way of doing things now in the days of Noah they had religion they had it for 2,000 years like we've had C Christianity and there were there were C critics just like there is now and in the days of Noah what happened we find out that Noah stood in that door of the Ark and built an ark which was contrary to the human beings it was contrary to human imagination it had never rained and never had been a cloud in the sky but God said it was going to rain amen so what did Noah do Noah had to build an ark amen it's amazing to think that throughout the Bible when disaster strikes the land that God would call uh I mean God would call for a time of Deliverance that God would always set His prophets to show the people the way of an escape my just like Moses when it was time for deliverance God God sent Moses before the people to show them a Deliverance God sent Noah to point them to a Deliverance to point them to an ark to point them to Christ amen and just like he did with Moses when was time he he sent Moses with the word to prepare the people we look at Noah here God said it's going to rain it looked impossible my we've had many of those situations our situation so many times just look impossible and that's what God's word God says prepare an ark Noah and Noah prepared the ark and stood in that door and preached salvation amen Noah would stand at the ark and says if you want to see a living God come in the ark if you want to seek Refuge from the Storm come in the ark oh my and it's the same thing today God sent a prophet at the door pointing to Christ saying if you want Deliverance come to the ark if you want salvation comeing in the ark amen now is the time for deliverance God sent us a prophet to point us to Jesus Christ if you want to see a Rel a living reality get in the ark man if you want to see God making himself known to his people we've got to get in the ark we've got to get to Christ amen they looked at the five loads and the fish is being multiplied in Jesus's day excuse me they they they focused on the loaves they focus on the fishes being multiplied they follow the Miracles of Jesus's day but when it came time to hear the word they refused it and it's so today they look to the healing campaigns they they follow that they look to the signs and the Wonders and the prayer lines but when it comes time for the word they refused it oh my it didn't match their way of thinking so they missed it amen we got to quit looking to the numbers we cannot base our experience of how many people are sitting in the church we can't base our experience how full the church is we got to quit looking to how many uh come to an altar each service quit looking to see how many says amen e service amen Feast your eyes on the word amen don't miss what God is doing for this church don't miss what God is doing for your family don't miss what God is doing for your husband your wife amen he's making himself known to his people amen God may be dealing with someone here this morning God may be dealing with someone in their Pew he may be changing a life right now God may be healing someone right now God may be restoring someone right now and as long as there's a heart ready to receive he will make himself known he will make himself a reality to you Amen Let God prove himself to you if you have a desire in your heart to see more of God there's more of God to be had oh my God loves to make himself known to his bride we must keep our keep our eyes off of off of the situations keep our eyes off of the troubles but Feast your eyes on the word Feast Your Eyes On Christ this morning and and he will make himself a reality to you hey man if you have a hunger in your heart for more of God we've got to surrender we've got to surrender everything we have God can't make himself known if we're too full of of the world if we're too full of this problem of that problem and and but we've got to surrender everything that we've got within us and we've got to surrender our complexes we've got to surrender our our ideas we've got to surrender of how we want to run things and how we want to do things so God can become a reality to us oh my amen if you've got a hunger in your heart Adventures an odyssey isn't going to feel that hunger oh come on now listening to your favorite audio book isn't going to isn't going to quench that hunger oh amen Dr doson can't restore your family oh come on now Dr doson has no right in your home Heen reading books on how to raise your kids oh come on now reading books on how to raise your kids can't teach you like this message can or you may get good ideas from it but reading them uh reading a book on how on how Susan wro on on some Susan wrote to to keep your kids from the drugs keep your kids from pornography keep your kids from addictions it won't work amen Susan can't teach you how to fear the lord can't teach you how to teach your kids to fear the lord well my kid is just throwing tantrums and picking up bad habits let's see let's let's just see what Susan has to say today it won't work amen you're not careful you'll let movies raise your kids oh God don't let some woman who cuts her hair that's the problem we we've

didn't stop praying for me they didn't stop I battled as a young person oh my I struggled with addictions as a young person I struggled with complexes as a young person I struggled with things that that no one should be struggling with and I was but with because of Godly Parents because of because of them dedicating themselves to this message because they wouldn't let let nothing come between us they they they they didn't stop praying for me they didn't stop crying out to God to do something for me they saw a hungering down in my soul and they knew that the world wasn't going to give it to me amen they saw a hungering and they knew that the world wasn't going to feel it so what did they do so late nights night after night after night they stayed up late praying for hours for me for God to do something for me they would plead the blood over my life until one day it paid off one day God did something for me God took those addictions away God clean uh complexes God gave me in Deliverance like never before amen don't let some woman tell you how to raise your kids don't let some man tell you how to raise your kids let the message have prance in your home let the message have prence in your lives in your children's life don't stop praying Don't Stop Believing cuz one day you're gonna see a victory God will make himself a reality to you Amen to your children amen I'm a life that was changed amen amen they didn't get that from reading a book they didn't get it from uh from some idea of of some some crazy woman but they got the idea they because they surrendered to the word I'm a life that was changed amen and that's what kids and teenagers need today not somebody that that'll bring them and take them through a program to get their lives straight but they need to see a living God they need to see a God not yesterday but today oh my they needed an experience of Jesus Christ they don't need experiences of movies and of sin and of this and of that they need an experience of Jesus Christ a living God oh my not a god from 2,000 years ago but a god of today working through the blood thought Blood Bought Holy Ghost filled bride of Jesus Christ amen God always likes to work through men amen it's God's program to work through men when God made man in his own image he put him on the earth as a Lesser God Jesus declared it when he said it is is it not written in your laws that ye are gods and they and if they called those Gods who the word of God come to which was the prophets how can you condemn me when I say I am the Son of God he said see they just couldn't understand it see but man was put here with a dominion over the Earth he had everything under his control when Adam lost Jesus proved that he had restored he stopped nature he raised the dead he done everything now for the people to see a living God in their day in their age they had to stay with the word if once they got away from the word they couldn't their their religion become dead amen wherever the word is God made himself known to the people amen and the world is groaning today the Bible says for the manifestations of the sons of God and God to get his children again in reality to make things real and the only way you're going to see a living God today is through the word and that was sent for us today amen the only way you're going to see a living God is you got to stay with the message amen stay with the message for your hour stay with the message for this day amen Paul had a message for his day amen and throughout the ages they all had a message for their day Paul's message wouldn't work for this day and and brother Brandon's message wouldn't work for this day we all have our own program to play our own uh position to play and and ours fell on this day amen the greatest day of them all amen it's not a Baptist idea Christ is this message how many believe that Christ is this message this morning amen Christ is this message it's not a Baptist idea it's not a Lutheran idea it's not even a Pentecostal idea but what they couldn't uh but they had what couldn't work for us today they had a portion of the truth back then they had a portion each age had their own portion but they got away but they got away they created a domination and they stepped away from the word they stepped away from the truth but when they took their eyes off the word they lost it and they're trying to find their way back to God by their denominational ideas and traditions and they're just giving the people something that died years ago oh my amen aad this idea was created years and years and years ago and they're still trying to present that before the people but they're just beating a dead horse so to speak they're trying to present this to the people and all they're getting is dead Works they're just getting ah dead religion oh come on now am man the method the Methodist will say well we've got the truth the Baptist says well we've got the truth if you want to see a living God come to our idea come to our idea we've got what you need the Church of God says they've got the truth amen working there at Camp Christie Church of God owns that there and and I've have had the privilege of uh talking with the uh he says he's the pastor of all Pastors in the state of Virginia and we've got to talk him back and forth and and and I've got to ask him what well how does your religion work how does your denomination work and so he told me he T he finally stopped and he he says well how do you guys do it I said well we follow the teachings of of William brandham and and he's like okay and I saidwell have you heard of the message of William brandom he says I sure have and I said okay so we got to talking a little bit of what we believe and and what our church is like and things and when we got done he says he says Daniel I love talking to you he says if we can he says I want to be able where where I've got time I want to spend a few more hours talking about this he says I love it I love talking about it and this is a pastor of all pastors over Virginia and you never know where that seat is but your job is to preach the word job is to stay with the word oh my but the Methodist says they've got it the Church of God says that they've got it but they're trying to produce something that isn't there amen if you want to see something that's got life in it if you want to see something that's got life in it if you want to see something that can produce and can Quicken that seed that's laying deep within you come in the presence of the S so n come into the presence of the son and watch God unveil himself to you amen you're not going to see God in in Traditions you're not going to see a living God in Traditions but God has given you his word to make himself a reality to you amen once you come to the presence of that light and surrender your thoughts and you surrender your ideas and and once all that malice is gone and once all that doubt is gone then that light will shrink that seed down in your heart and will produce the same spirit that Christ had amen the word becomes a living reality to you the Bible became a new book and you'll know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen how many believes to take off the Holy Ghost this morning amen God God had seen a seed down in your heart and once you got rid of that malice once you've got rid of that that gossip that is laying in there once you got rid of that Disobedience once you got rid of your own thoughts and your own ideas the S so n was able to get that light and strike that seed and he became real to you heyen not a god of yesterday but a god of today a god of tomorrow and a god of the next day oh my we've got to stay with that word amen God just wants one person who can surrender God wants one person he can show his power through amen the problem we've got today is is people just get burned out amen humans just get burned out and and they they they they've let the message become common they they've Let Jesus Christ become common now well it's your sister Jane up there singing a song well that's just that's just so and so up there preaching well that's just that that song leader again well he's just up there and he keeps us too long it's become common it's become common to you and the preach have been saying well Jesus is coming back for years and and well you know he still hasn't come well preachers are saying well well I've been preaching the message for 50 years and saying that he's coming since day one and he ain't come and they've let it become common and and let me say this when when you may be stuck in a rub but just because you can't see what God is doing today does it mean he's not moving just because you get stuck in a rat and sometimes we get stuck in rats I'm not going to lie sometimes we just wonder why and and but that doesn't mean that God's not moving still in this church that God's not doing something for you that God's not doing something for the person beside you amen he's still moving we've got to stay with the word but see burn out we've become burned out next thing you know they're just trying to bring this idea that's that's what's happening I'm not saying this church at all I'm not saying that I believe that we we are grounded we know what the truth is and we're staying with but I'm just I'm just I'm just trying to lay examples to you but those the the the the so-called message churches out there that that have left the message what happened was they they they become burn out it didn't happen overnight it was something that was just building up it was this thought that come in and it was that thought that come in and and and they slowly just let it build now well yeah you're right you know we have been preaching a long time well I don't know well well they're not coming to an altar anymore well you know we used to have 50 people come to an altar now it's down to two well see they they just keep focusing on the negative they kept focusing and and later than then it become become well they're well uh they're not they're not they're not loving me and and it become all about themselves that they let the message become common and the next thing you know uh they try to bring people to a Baptist idea and and they said that they say well well we're going to witness to people but first we got to bring them to a Baptist idea before we can get them to Christ it won't work amen that's like trying to induce or trying to introduce a a freezing man to a painted fire amen this man is out there freezing and you said well I know how to keep you warm so you paint a fire and you said here are you warm yet are you warm yet he goes oh yeah I've had enough enough and then you get him to the real thing it won't work if you're going to witness to somebody get him to the real thing first oh my if the man is freezing getting them something that's got a reality in it that's right amen but they've become ashamed they become ashamed of the message they're kicking this picture out of their churches now they're kicking it out of their homes because they become ashamed it's become too common amen when I heard that they were kicking that I went and bought a picture and it's the first thing you see when you come into my house oh my I'm not ashamed of this gospel it's done something for me that the world can't do oh my amen I don't care who gets offended by that picture I don't care if it offends The Sinner when he comes in you got to know who you believe amen we don't worship that man but we worship the god of that man we worship God was so pleased in that man that he had his picture taken with him oh man we are blessed people to have that picture in our church I'm thinking for our pastor not taking that picture out of our church amen when my kids grow up I can point them to that that's God that's God above that man God sent that man to our age God sent that man to give us the truth and we believe it this morning do you believe it this morning are you thankful for our Prophet this morning amen God Vindicated himself in that man amen he's proven proven himself too many times to me for me to be ashamed oh my I don't care if it cost you your popularity I don't care if it cost you your friends or if it cost you your job if it was good enough for Paul it was good enough for Noah then it's good enough for you tonight oh my when all else fails it will be there to pick you up when all your friends forsaken you it'll stick close to to you than a brother when you feel like you're losing your mind it will be your peace when you can't seem to find happiness it'll be your joy oh come on now it'll be there for Your Darkest Hours it'll be there for your children it'll be there for your wife it'll be there for your husband come on now I'm not talking about a drug I'm not talking about alcohol I'm not talking about about some formal idea some religion out there but what I am talking about I am talking about a reality I'm talking about that will never leave you nor forsake you oh my I'm talking about Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen his word made flesh again and a many membered body tonight this morning amen all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into his bride he poured into his church amen the realities have God unveiled in these last days amen God making himself known amen the world has chosen their souls to be King instead of God they put their faith in their intellectual ideas and their Creeds and their religion and it died with Saul my the people they wanted they they wanted us they wanted uh uh someone else to be king a man to be king besides God being their King and they put their trust in Saul they put their faith in Saul and they put the religion in Saul but when Saul died it died with them amen but I believe that there's David's here who can say I don't know nothing about your Spears I don't know nothing about your swords I don't know nothing about your intellectual training but when they I do know and that is I've tried him I've tested him I placed my faith in his word and look what his Mercy has done for me look at what the blood has done for me look at what his power has done for me I once was lost but now I'm found I was blind but now I see I'm talking about a re a religion that's got a reality in it that's something that's got a backbone in it oh you oh my you can just sit there if you want but God has done something for for me and I'm going to preach about it I'm going to sing about it I can't contain it oh my it's like fire shut up in my bones oh my a living reality the world don't want it if the world don't want it I'll take it oh you give it to me oh my it's going to get us ready for our Rapture one of these days oh we Are Witnesses every one of you are witnesses of God's reality this morning amen you wouldn't be here if there wasn't something that that you had a desire you wouldn't be here if there was if God hadn't put a seed down in your heart amen but God has making himself known to you by the word God is making himself a reality to his people that you can't wait for them Church doors to open you can't wait to praise your praise the Lord and sing the songs and lift your hands oh my because he's a reality to you he's more than just words on a page he's more than just a story he's more than than a bedtime story to your kids but he's a living reality whatever you have need of God will give it to you if you would ask this morning amen he's a living reality Hallelujah so the gospel consists more than just teaching the word for Paul says first Thessalonians 1 and verse 5 for Our Gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the Holy Ghost amen demonstrations of the Holy Spirit would come and demonstrate the gospel bringing the word to a living reality amen if you just receive the word by if you just receive the word by knowing the word that doesn't do any good the letter kth but the spirit giveth life see that's what we was talking about earlier we we've got people who can read the word and and who can read the Bible who can read the message you can quote quotes but without the life behind it without the spirit of the Lord behind it it won't do no good but then we must be born again and the Holy Spirit quickens the word to you in other words it's like a grain of corn that's laying in my hand it's just a grain of corn it'll never be anything else but you bury it it it comes contaminated molds and then it brings another grain of corn just like it amen you see it's good to read and talk about the Miracles in the Bible I'm not against that I love reading the Bible I love telling my children my my little almost two-year-old I love to tell I tell her every day you do know that I love you you do know that mama loves you and do you know that most of all Jesus loves you and and Mama would begin to tell her the stories of David tell her the stories of Jesus and tell her the stories of what what's going on and but see but see there's nothing wrong with telling the stories of Moses and David and it's good to know them it's good to teach your children those things and and it's good uh uh to to know that but see the Baptists do the same the the methodists do the same they teach their kids the Bible and the Church of God does the same they try to raise their kids in the right way as the best they can by the word but without the life behind it it becomes of no avail oh come on now and the church does the same amen but what what has happened is they haven't laid the seed in the ground they haven't laid that seed in the ground and they and but but what they have is they buried it in their Traditions they buried it in in their ideas and it's only produced a formal and dried up religion oh amen they've got so focused on the Easter Plays they've got so focused on on what Jesus did that they missed the everything he is doing in this day oh my and there are were people this morning that has hidden that word in their heart and it's not and is let the Holy Ghost come and Quicken that life that's in him amen I believe I'm preaching to a people that's that's hid that word down in their heart and they've let the Holy Ghost come in and and and it Sprout up the things of God and God is making himself known to you and he's ministering to you by the word oh my myall amen and when you can hide that word in your heart the next thing you know them old traditions just fall away the next thing you know the old man is buried it doesn't become a form of words or a decoration of so many words put together but it becomes a living reality that Jesus Christ is in us now and the Holy Spirit is moving back and forth through every human being amen surging through the hearts amen we've got to let our faith in God and bring the power of God to a living reality amen won't hold you too much longer some trust in chariots some trust in horses but we will remember the name of the Lord Our God Amen Jesus said Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will never fail amen what good is he to us if he's if he's in the history what good is he to us if he's only in of God in another age the world wants to see a living reality amen the world is crying out where's the god of Moses where's the god of Elijah amen where is the god and and you as the Church of the Living God can stand and testify he is here he is here amen I have the answer he is here this morning amen and he's here and he's moving right Among Us now making himself known not by any Bunny not by Santa Claus not by some formal idea but he is making himself known by the word by your faith in God and the power of the Holy Ghost shown himself with great signs and wonders that the world has never seen before Oh My but the world doesn't want it amen the world wants to go back to ausa Street the world wants to go back to the healing Revival but we've got a Revival of ourselves and it's the bride's Revival oh my God proving himself alive and well in his people oh my amen you may say well my my my uh my situation is impossible you may say well I just I don't know I'm just about to give up I'm about to give up on my kids cuz I just don't know well I'm about to give up on my job cuz I just don't know well the doctor said there's just no way but brother random says this no matter whether it was impossible God can alter circumstances he can make the impossible become a probable and not only a probable they could make it a reality when man can just take God at his word and except God's provided way that God has provided for for the man amen it may take you 10 years it may take you a year it may take you months it may take you your whole life but if you can stay with that word if you can stay with with God's provided way amen then then those impossible situations begin just to fall then then them impossible situations God will meet your need oh my amen God is looking for surrendered Hearts God is looking for someone to rely not God is looking for someone uh to not rely on their natural eyesight but that can place their faith in the Unseen things of God looking for someone that can say not my will but your will be done oh God Amen brother Bri says if you can accept the same seed that they accepted it'll be a living reality to you that'll bring you into the same experience that they had oh my if it was good enough for Paul if it was good enough for Peter if it was good enough for brother brandom if it was good enough for brother Walker then I tell you it's good enough for me amen I'll take away with God's Chosen Few I've started in Jesus and I'm going through oh my I don't care what the world says I don't care if the world don't want it I don't care but you give me Jesus I'll take it and I'm going to go all the way oh a living reality the world needs to see a living reality not your own ideas of what you think the message is but if you can preach what brother brandham says the world will see a living reality it don't mean that they're going to accept it we don't know the seeds that are out there but God does and if you can just stay with what the message says God will bring that seed in amen amen we've got to surrender everything we have tonight if the musicians will come Lord amen God is looking for a surrendered heart if we're too full of the things of uh of of not so much of the world but if we've got our our mind Minds just just focused on problems after problems and situations and well this one is is gone and that one is going or or anything and we wonder in our church pews are getting emptier and and we just don't think God is going to move let me tell you something God's not through God is not if there's still a hungering in your heart God's not through with you amen if there's still someone that's willing to receive the message I'm going to stand here your pastor is going to stand here these breaching brothers are going to stand here and they're going to minister day in and
