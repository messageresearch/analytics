[1:03:06] week week and a half so keep me in your
[1:03:07] prayers
[1:03:09] this is going that's a long time
[1:03:12] isaiah 53-1 a familiar scripture but who
[1:03:16] hath believed our report and to whom
[1:03:19] is the arm of the lord revealed who hath
[1:03:22] believed our report and to whom is the
[1:03:24] arm of the lord revealed coming by our
[1:03:26] heads this morning dear gracious
[1:03:28] heavenly father we want to thank you for
[1:03:30] your grace
[1:03:31] and your mercy lord as we felt your
[1:03:33] presence this morning god this is a new
[1:03:35] service father another time lord i ask
[1:03:38] that you would help us tonight father
[1:03:40] lord as i lay myself aside anoint this
[1:03:43] vessel lord jesus lord anoint the
[1:03:45] congregation father be in everything
[1:03:47] that's said and done take this little
[1:03:49] thought that you've placed upon my heart
[1:03:50] lord we ask these things in your
[1:03:52] precious name amen you may be seated
[1:03:56] my my title this evening would be a
[1:03:58] challenge to the believer i know there's
[1:04:00] many ways that you can take this
[1:04:02] scripture and it's a popular scripture
[1:04:04] it's preached on a lot
[1:04:06] but i'm going to take this tonight as a
[1:04:07] challenge and a challenge is to see what
[1:04:10] you're made of to see how if you're
[1:04:12] stronger than your opponent faster than
[1:04:14] your opponent smarter than your opponent
[1:04:16] but there's one thing though we've got
[1:04:17] to realize we're never stronger than the
[1:04:19] devil in our own ability we're never
[1:04:21] smarter than the devil we see eve in the
[1:04:23] middle of perfection got outwitted by
[1:04:25] the devil you're never smarter than the
[1:04:27] devil you're never stronger you're never
[1:04:29] faster but we still have to fight for
[1:04:32] every inch of ground but god has given
[1:04:34] us the ability through the strength of
[1:04:36] the lord to stand in this last day more
[1:04:39] than overcomers we've got a fight you
[1:04:41] see brother branham says now you see
[1:04:43] after you become a christian many people
[1:04:45] think well after i become a christian
[1:04:47] that settles it all i have to do is just
[1:04:49] say well glory to god everything's mine
[1:04:51] he says no sir you're mistaken you have
[1:04:53] to fight for every inch of ground that
[1:04:55] you take god told ease israel down in
[1:04:58] egypt i give you the promised land but
[1:05:00] he told joshua when he went in
[1:05:02] everywhere the sows of your feet shred i
[1:05:04] give you it was already given to them
[1:05:06] but you had a fight for every inch of
[1:05:08] ground in other words footprints mean
[1:05:10] possession just keep walking now they
[1:05:13] had to fight for it but god had given it
[1:05:15] to them and i believe god has given us
[1:05:16] every promise when he died at calvary
[1:05:19] gave you your healing your deliverance
[1:05:21] the the the holy ghost for your loved
[1:05:23] ones but you still gotta fight you still
[1:05:26] gotta get up put your boots on and say
[1:05:27] devil we're going another round we're
[1:05:30] going another time but in your own
[1:05:31] ability we can't do it but god has
[1:05:34] equipped this with everything that we
[1:05:36] have need of to overcome every spirit to
[1:05:39] overcome every devil and that is the
[1:05:41] holy ghost you see we have to fight
[1:05:43] brother branham says he didn't get we
[1:05:45] didn't get saved to be on a picnic he
[1:05:47] says we got saved and now we're put in a
[1:05:50] battleground we're on a battlefield the
[1:05:52] fact whenever god gives you something
[1:05:54] the devil's going to come right back and
[1:05:56] try to take it away from you what a
[1:05:57] brother branham says he says when you're
[1:05:59] healed from cancer that devil is going
[1:06:01] to try to come back but we got to fill
[1:06:03] up that void with the word of god with
[1:06:05] the holy ghost when you're delivered for
[1:06:07] something from something the devil's
[1:06:08] gonna come right back and try to give it
[1:06:10] to you but we gotta fight the battle
[1:06:13] ain't over at a meeting the battle land
[1:06:15] over whenever you get your deliverance
[1:06:16] but you gotta fight to maintain your
[1:06:19] liberty it's a fight to come the church
[1:06:21] the preacher fights mind battles the
[1:06:23] song leader fights mind battles the
[1:06:25] deacons fight mind battles the the sound
[1:06:27] guys everybody that comes to church is
[1:06:30] fighting mind battles why the devil
[1:06:32] knows if you can ever get in an
[1:06:34] atmosphere where all things are possible
[1:06:37] he loses your hold if you can get in an
[1:06:40] atmosphere where the mind battles fall
[1:06:42] you can get your deliverance and that's
[1:06:44] why he fights you from coming to church
[1:06:46] that's why he fights you from breaking
[1:06:48] through to the presence of the lord but
[1:06:51] i say this this evening if you can break
[1:06:53] through pass those mind battles into
[1:06:56] this presence this evening all things
[1:06:58] are possible if you need healing god can
[1:07:00] give it to you if you need the holy
[1:07:02] ghost god can give it to you if you need
[1:07:04] to refill it god can give it to you but
[1:07:07] we gotta fight it's for our grounds god
[1:07:10] has already given us a refilling or
[1:07:12] promised us to refill it but we got to
[1:07:15] fight for it but you see you're not
[1:07:16] alone in this battle the devil will like
[1:07:18] you to think that you're the only one
[1:07:20] that goes through mind battles you're
[1:07:22] the only one that goes through complexes
[1:07:24] you're the only one that fights
[1:07:26] temptations the fights discouragement
[1:07:28] and fights this and fights that you're
[1:07:30] not alone every one of us fight
[1:07:33] complexes but god as it gave you has
[1:07:35] equipped a body a unit that can stand
[1:07:38] shoulder to shoulder and fight for the
[1:07:41] promises of god oh but there's got to be
[1:07:43] somebody accept the challenge
[1:07:50] it's hard for me to keep my coat on
[1:07:53] amen but we got to fight for everything
[1:07:56] that we're going to preserve or possess
[1:07:58] you see the devil wants to bring a
[1:07:59] division where we're off to ourselves
[1:08:02] doing our own thing but that right there
[1:08:04] is a target for the devil to come and
[1:08:07] lure your way to complexes when you're
[1:08:09] by yourself what does complexes do
[1:08:12] that's not the way i'm intending it to
[1:08:13] go but what does complexes do complexes
[1:08:16] draw you up to yourself
[1:08:18] oh it draws you up where now now you
[1:08:21] don't feel like you can fit in with
[1:08:22] everybody because the devil has placed a
[1:08:25] complex in your mind that you're fat
[1:08:28] that you're too skinny you're too short
[1:08:30] you're too tall you're too die in a
[1:08:32] complex that was too dark whenever i was
[1:08:33] younger so i didn't feel like i could
[1:08:35] fit in with some people that was a
[1:08:37] complex
[1:08:38] that the devil put on me and wanted me
[1:08:40] to draw up to myself but if i drew up to
[1:08:43] myself the devil was going to plague my
[1:08:46] mind day after day after day and by
[1:08:49] myself i was going to fall apart so the
[1:08:52] devil places complexes so that you draw
[1:08:55] up by yourself god didn't mean this to
[1:08:57] draw up it didn't mean for us to draw up
[1:08:59] by yourself he placed a body in the
[1:09:02] middle of laodicea where we can feed off
[1:09:04] the word of god we can feed off each
[1:09:06] other's testimonies we can feed off the
[1:09:09] spirit of god that he's placed upon our
[1:09:11] in our lives you know the story in the
[1:09:13] old testament uh i believe that the
[1:09:16] syrians had seized samaria
[1:09:18] and what they did was they surrounded
[1:09:21] the city and cut off their water supply
[1:09:24] cut off their food resources and now
[1:09:26] they're trapped inside of a city that
[1:09:29] they built with their own hands
[1:09:32] what does a complex do a complex is a
[1:09:35] wall that you build up yourself trying
[1:09:38] to protect yourself
[1:09:40] you got hurt or or you think this one
[1:09:42] don't like you those mind battles are
[1:09:44] building up a wall between you and your
[1:09:46] brother between you and your sister
[1:09:49] between you and the pastor between you
[1:09:51] and this one it's the devil placing a
[1:09:54] complex and instead of fighting against
[1:09:56] that complex you build up a walled city
[1:10:00] the syrians had built up a city to
[1:10:02] protect themselves and now they're
[1:10:04] surrounded and they're trapped inside of
[1:10:06] their own city what happened the bible
[1:10:08] says that it got so bad that the famine
[1:10:11] got so bad that the the the mothers and
[1:10:14] fathers were eating their own children
[1:10:16] the their family was the one struggling
[1:10:19] and being hurt inside of that city what
[1:10:22] happens you're not the only one that
[1:10:24] gets hurt in your complex
[1:10:26] your loved ones get hurt your family
[1:10:28] members get hurt what i'm trying to say
[1:10:30] is this is a battle we're going to have
[1:10:32] complexes but don't draw up to yourself
[1:10:35] fight against that complex we've been
[1:10:37] equipped in this last day not the false
[1:10:40] subject to complexes and anxiety and
[1:10:43] this and that but we've got the power
[1:10:45] through the name of jesus christ with
[1:10:47] the baptism of the holy ghost to stand
[1:10:50] up against the challenges the devil
[1:10:52] sends our way and so there were some
[1:10:54] lepers they didn't fit in with the
[1:10:56] society but they were sitting at the
[1:10:58] gate and said shall we sit here till we
[1:11:01] die
[1:11:02] on the outside of the wall everybody
[1:11:04] worked up in their mind that there was a
[1:11:06] great big army worked up in their mind
[1:11:08] that they couldn't get water worked up
[1:11:10] in their mind that they couldn't get
[1:11:12] enough food oh what's the complex do it
[1:11:14] cut you off where you're the water
[1:11:16] supply of the holy ghost is covered off
[1:11:18] away from you the food supply of the
[1:11:21] word is cut off away from you you don't
[1:11:23] want to come to church no more you don't
[1:11:25] want to go to the fellowships no more
[1:11:27] i'm preaching this evening you don't
[1:11:29] want to go to the youth meetings no more
[1:11:31] it's a complex that you built up a wall
[1:11:34] with that's cutting you off from the
[1:11:36] resources that god has given for you
[1:11:39] oh but there were some lepers some
[1:11:41] nobody that wasn't even allowed to go in
[1:11:43] the city but they said shall we sit here
[1:11:45] till we die what happened i know the
[1:11:47] story these lepers defied the odds says
[1:11:50] you know what we may be in a hard time
[1:11:53] but we're not just going to sit here and
[1:11:54] die we're going to fight to survive oh
[1:11:58] we need some sons and daughters of god
[1:12:00] that say i'm not going to lay down i'm
[1:12:02] going to fight to survive in this last
[1:12:04] day the last plague is spiritual death
[1:12:07] but i'm not going to give in to
[1:12:08] spiritual death i'm going to fight and
[1:12:11] claim every promise every inheritance
[1:12:14] that god has given me oh so these these
[1:12:16] lepers went outside of the city and
[1:12:18] there wasn't even no army there
[1:12:21] there wasn't even an army there but they
[1:12:23] were trapped inside of a city they built
[1:12:26] thinking there was something on the
[1:12:28] inside
[1:12:29] that's what a complex does
[1:12:31] in reality the pastor likes you
[1:12:34] your mama likes you
[1:12:36] your sister likes you your brother likes
[1:12:38] you but you worked up a walled city
[1:12:41] because of a complex and nothing's even
[1:12:44] there
[1:12:46] i got some news for you walk out of that
[1:12:48] city you don't gotta stay in that
[1:12:50] complex you don't gotta stay in that
[1:12:52] anxiety walk out of the city the devil's
[1:12:55] nothing but a bluff he defeated every
[1:12:58] strong code every power every capability
[1:13:01] at calvary but god needs somebody to get
[1:13:04] some grit about them and stand up and
[1:13:06] say devil i'm accepting the challenge
[1:13:09] i'm not laying down i'm not giving up
[1:13:11] i'm gonna fight for my mind i'm gonna
[1:13:14] fight for my deliverance i'm not giving
[1:13:17] up oh come on somebody somebody needs to
[1:13:20] fight
[1:13:21] there's nothing on the outside of that
[1:13:23] complex
[1:13:24] everybody likes you
[1:13:26] god made you to be that way
[1:13:28] to be short to be tall to be chubby to
[1:13:31] be skinny god created you that way but
[1:13:34] the devil wants to take what god meant
[1:13:37] for good and turn it into evil
[1:13:40] oh that's where the complex is god made
[1:13:42] you with a certain personality that can
[1:13:45] fit a certain gift that god gave you
[1:13:50] oh god places gifts in each and every
[1:13:53] one of our lives well this is going
[1:13:54] south but here we are god places gifts
[1:13:57] in each and every one of our
[1:13:58] lives but he places certain
[1:14:01] personalities to fit those gifts
[1:14:04] so you can't just lay down and see my
[1:14:06] wish i was like so and so i wish i could
[1:14:08] sing like that one wish i could preach
[1:14:10] like that one god didn't make you to
[1:14:12] preach like that one the shame like that
[1:14:15] one god made you to whip upon the devil
[1:14:18] with that character and personality that
[1:14:21] god gave you
[1:14:23] but the devil would like to take that
[1:14:24] personality and turn it into a complex
[1:14:29] take that personality instead of being a
[1:14:31] leader you're a bully
[1:14:34] this is the way it's going instead of
[1:14:36] being a follower to follow a husband or
[1:14:39] to follow your pastor now you're
[1:14:41] following the things of the world we've
[1:14:43] got to fight to keep our liberty we've
[1:14:47] got to fight and say no devil you're not
[1:14:49] taking what god gave me my personality
[1:14:53] god had picked for me my stature god
[1:14:57] handpicked for me brother branham says
[1:14:59] he knew your eye color before the
[1:15:01] foundation of the world he knew your
[1:15:03] stature he knew your hair color he knew
[1:15:06] this and he knew that he also said he
[1:15:08] has a picture of you
[1:15:11] god placed you on earth for a special
[1:15:14] purpose don't give up that purpose for
[1:15:17] the lives of the devil don't give you
[1:15:19] that purpose for a complex don't give up
[1:15:22] that purpose for anxiety
[1:15:24] but fight to keep that purpose that god
[1:15:27] has given you you may say i'm a nobody
[1:15:30] god's equipped you
[1:15:32] remember the story of the little wash
[1:15:34] woman that saved up all of her money and
[1:15:36] she rented a little building a little
[1:15:38] stable i believe and she was going to
[1:15:40] have a revival as she did all she could
[1:15:43] she got some flyers printed up and she
[1:15:45] was handing out the flyers and the
[1:15:46] people were mounting up those flowers
[1:15:48] and throwing it down she was getting
[1:15:50] discouraged the devil was trying to
[1:15:52] plague her mind saying you're out of the
[1:15:54] will of the lord you're not doing
[1:15:56] nothing for god but she didn't give up
[1:15:58] she stayed there and fight george we're
[1:16:00] in a fight we're on a battleground you
[1:16:03] don't have to give up any inch of ground
[1:16:06] the devil's trying to take from you
[1:16:08] the devil was trying to take away her
[1:16:09] joy but she gave out another flower and
[1:16:12] there was a young boy with hair down to
[1:16:14] him down past his eyes brother branham
[1:16:16] says
[1:16:17] and he said i can't read ma'am what's
[1:16:19] that say and she said there's a church
[1:16:22] there's some services going on at that
[1:16:24] stable
[1:16:26] you're welcome to come it's happening
[1:16:28] these certain nights at this certain
[1:16:30] time you need to come down to this
[1:16:32] meeting and that night at that church
[1:16:35] service nobody came but that god called
[1:16:38] minister got up oh i'm still thankful
[1:16:40] there's god called ministers in this
[1:16:42] last day that's willing to stand against
[1:16:45] the odds and preach the truth as that
[1:16:47] man started to preach started the
[1:16:49] preacher nobody was even there but that
[1:16:52] young boy walked into that to that
[1:16:54] stable sat down and something struck his
[1:16:57] heart something struck him he came to
[1:17:00] the altar and gave his life to christ
[1:17:02] you may say brother josh what's up with
[1:17:04] this story that young boy was dwight l
[1:17:06] moody brother branham says he won a
[1:17:09] million souls to christ and that little
[1:17:11] wash woman was responsible for all of
[1:17:14] those souls it was somebody that didn't
[1:17:17] look special didn't look important but
[1:17:19] she had a purpose
[1:17:21] come on somebody she had a purpose that
[1:17:24] god gave her and she was responsible for
[1:17:27] 1 million souls oh my you may just win
[1:17:30] one soul the best soul may go across the
[1:17:32] ocean to africa and wind souls to christ
[1:17:35] you're responsible for it the testimony
[1:17:38] that god gave you can win somebody to
[1:17:40] christ
[1:17:41] you may have a testimony that i don't
[1:17:44] got so you can reach people i can't
[1:17:46] reach
[1:17:47] we go through things that are in our
[1:17:49] life for a purpose
[1:17:51] all things work together according to
[1:17:53] his purpose
[1:17:55] oh
[1:17:56] hallelujah you see me as an evangelist
[1:17:59] can reach people on the sean can reach
[1:18:01] but he is a pastor can reach people i
[1:18:04] can't reach as an evangelist we're all
[1:18:06] working together for one purpose
[1:18:09] that's jesus christ for one purpose
[1:18:12] that's to destroy strongholds in
[1:18:15] people's lives
[1:18:16] you may say i'm not a preacher god
[1:18:19] hasn't called you to be a preacher
[1:18:22] well i can't think god maybe didn't call
[1:18:24] you to sing but he's called you for his
[1:18:26] purpose
[1:18:28] he's called you for a special purpose
[1:18:31] you may say you don't know what i've
[1:18:33] been through you don't know what i've
[1:18:35] done that don't matter
[1:18:37] all things work together god's going to
[1:18:39] use your past maybe to win somebody the
[1:18:42] christ
[1:18:42] you all know the story of jonah remember
[1:18:45] we say john is a is a runaway prophet he
[1:18:48] went to he was supposed to go to nineveh
[1:18:49] went to tarshish what happened he got
[1:18:52] thrown out of the boats and then and a
[1:18:54] well came in and ate him and he came and
[1:18:57] spit the well spit jonah out
[1:19:00] at nineveh but you know what happened
[1:19:02] the people looked at that well and say
[1:19:05] wow
[1:19:06] that's our god right there god used his
[1:19:09] mistake
[1:19:10] or used what we think his backsliding
[1:19:12] for god's good
[1:19:15] and because of that the people didn't
[1:19:18] get saved by the well god
[1:19:21] but got saved because of the god of
[1:19:23] jehovah that jonah was bringing to them
[1:19:26] his past brought an entire city to
[1:19:29] christ
[1:19:30] your past mistakes your testimonies can
[1:19:33] bring somebody to christ
[1:19:35] can't bring a deliverance
[1:19:37] oh they can look at jonah and see what
[1:19:39] happened there says my backslid i didn't
[1:19:42] obey the commission of the lord but the
[1:19:44] same god that had mercy on me is the
[1:19:47] same god that can have mercy on your
[1:19:49] souls
[1:19:50] and you can you maybe be able to say i
[1:19:52] once was bound to pornography i once was
[1:19:55] bound to this i once was bound to that
[1:19:57] but the same god that set me free can
[1:20:00] set you free
[1:20:02] but we need somebody to be satisfied in
[1:20:05] the calling that god has given you
[1:20:08] well i may be just a young person god's
[1:20:10] given you a calling
[1:20:13] oh hope this is okay tonight but god
[1:20:15] needs somebody to be satisfied what
[1:20:18] happens if i got out of my calling and
[1:20:20] tried to be a pastor
[1:20:22] now there's a calling that ain't being
[1:20:23] fulfilled
[1:20:26] come on somebody or somehow a pastor
[1:20:28] tried getting out of his calling and to
[1:20:29] get into my calling there's a calling
[1:20:31] the name fulfilled
[1:20:33] god's called us for special callings
[1:20:37] oh my
[1:20:40] but anyways we go through trials in our
[1:20:42] lives to see what we're made of to see
[1:20:45] where our faith is anchored at if our
[1:20:47] faith is anchored in our good looks
[1:20:49] that's going to fade one day if our
[1:20:51] faith is anchored in the pastor the
[1:20:53] pastor may backslide one day we've seen
[1:20:56] many pastors in this last day that fell
[1:20:58] away and people's faith was anchored in
[1:21:01] the pastor instead of the word of god
[1:21:03] and they fell away with him where's our
[1:21:06] faith anchored at but we go through
[1:21:08] trials and they'll see where our faith
[1:21:10] is but i believe there's some people in
[1:21:12] this building that can stand up and say
[1:21:14] i may be in a challenge right now but
[1:21:16] i've been through some past challenges
[1:21:18] and that's created the faith that i can
[1:21:21] say this little thing i'm going through
[1:21:23] it's nothing for my god i've been
[1:21:25] through some hard times i've been
[1:21:27] through some testing times but i can
[1:21:29] stand in here and say my god is able oh
[1:21:32] my god is able remember the story of the
[1:21:34] shoot of my woman the shoot of my woman
[1:21:36] wasn't able to have a son
[1:21:39] and god came and miraculously gave her a
[1:21:41] son she wished she was going through a
[1:21:43] challenge
[1:21:44] she wanted the baby she wanted to have
[1:21:46] their so bad
[1:21:48] the the women are created to be mothers
[1:21:51] but she felt like she couldn't fulfill
[1:21:53] her purpose
[1:21:55] oh let me say this the devil can never
[1:21:57] destroy the purpose in your life
[1:22:00] before the foundation of the world god
[1:22:03] knew she was going to have a baby
[1:22:05] and here she is in her challenge
[1:22:08] thinking she can't fulfill her purpose
[1:22:11] but nothing the devil can put in her
[1:22:13] mind put in her body do whatever he
[1:22:15] wanted to do could destroy the purpose
[1:22:18] that was on her life and nothing the
[1:22:21] devil can throw on your mind and try to
[1:22:23] say you're a son of his nothing can
[1:22:26] destroy the purpose that god has placed
[1:22:29] in your life he may come and say you're
[1:22:31] one of my daughters your serpent's hate
[1:22:34] but if god's called you there's nothing
[1:22:36] the devil can do to destroy that seed
[1:22:40] oh nothing he can do to destroy that
[1:22:42] seed i'm sure the devil thought he was
[1:22:44] going to destroy jonah but god had a
[1:22:47] purpose for jonah and nothing could
[1:22:49] destroy that seed
[1:22:52] oh hallelujah so the shooter my woman
[1:22:54] wanted the baby then god came and the
[1:22:57] prophet came and spoke the the words of
[1:22:59] life over her and she got a baby
[1:23:02] and now because of that challenge she's
[1:23:04] coming up to another challenge her
[1:23:06] baby's now taken away
[1:23:08] it died
[1:23:10] but since she had been through a
[1:23:11] challenge before she knew the same god
[1:23:14] that brought her out of this challenge
[1:23:16] can bring her through this challenge
[1:23:20] you don't go through trials in vain
[1:23:22] you don't go through hard times in vain
[1:23:24] god's equipping you with the faith to go
[1:23:28] through another trial so go what does
[1:23:30] the bible say he won't put nothing or
[1:23:32] more on us than we can bear god knows
[1:23:35] what he's doing your confidence hating
[1:23:37] your ability your confidence hate to be
[1:23:40] in your mind your confidence is in the
[1:23:43] word of god i'll never leave you i'll
[1:23:45] never forsake you yeah i'll be with you
[1:23:48] until the end of the world you're
[1:23:50] engraved in the palm of my hand i've
[1:23:53] seen the righteous forsaken but i've
[1:23:55] never seen his seed begging for bread
[1:23:57] it's the word of god we'll put our
[1:23:59] confidence in it's not my ability
[1:24:02] david could stand up and say you're a
[1:24:04] giant you've got a sword and a shield
[1:24:07] and a spear and i've got nothing but a
[1:24:09] slingshot but the battle's not mine it's
[1:24:12] the lord i've been through a challenge a
[1:24:14] bear trying to take me one time but god
[1:24:16] brought me through a lion trying to take
[1:24:19] me one time but god brought me through
[1:24:21] and the same god you know somebody that
[1:24:24] brought me through those challenges is
[1:24:26] the same god that's gonna bring me
[1:24:28] through this challenge
[1:24:30] the battle's not mine but it's the
[1:24:32] lord's he couldn't say that if he didn't
[1:24:35] have faith in jehovah
[1:24:37] he couldn't have faith in jehovah unless
[1:24:40] he seen god personally
[1:24:43] oh what does a trial do
[1:24:45] a trial puts you in a situation where
[1:24:48] you see god personally
[1:24:50] when we was first married there was
[1:24:52] times we didn't have no money we didn't
[1:24:54] have money for our bills we knew
[1:24:57] we knew that our loan was due well we
[1:24:59] hadn't paid it that month so i called
[1:25:01] the bank and says can i put i was going
[1:25:03] to ask if we could push it up a couple
[1:25:05] of weeks and we was going to try to get
[1:25:07] some money it was a challenge that we
[1:25:09] were going through but we wasn't word we
[1:25:11] was praying and seeking god we called
[1:25:13] the bank and the bank says it's already
[1:25:15] paid for the month
[1:25:17] that's the challenge that we went
[1:25:19] through that god showed me personally
[1:25:22] and loretta that god has a purpose for
[1:25:25] the things we go through
[1:25:27] another time we knew we had a certain
[1:25:29] amount of the bank we called to see how
[1:25:31] much was in there to make sure and it
[1:25:33] was doubled
[1:25:34] well i don't know how to explain it but
[1:25:36] all i know is jesus christ is never
[1:25:39] going to leave me never going to forsake
[1:25:41] me but he's going to be with me to the
[1:25:43] end of the world
[1:25:45] i may not understand why i'm going
[1:25:47] through this hard time but god's given
[1:25:49] me a testimony
[1:25:51] oh we like the testimony but we don't
[1:25:53] like going through the tests but you
[1:25:55] have to have the testimony or the test
[1:25:57] to have the testimony
[1:26:00] we have to have that
[1:26:03] oh hallelujah
[1:26:04] but they're shooting my woman she was
[1:26:06] going up to the prophet and the prophet
[1:26:08] was going to send his servant and then
[1:26:10] the woman says no i don't want the
[1:26:12] servant i want to talk to elijah
[1:26:15] but she had faith she went up to elijah
[1:26:18] and elijah says all is well with your
[1:26:20] husband all as well

[1:27:08] the prophet went and god raised the boy
[1:27:11] from the dead
[1:27:13] it was because of a challenge that
[1:27:15] created the faith in her life that she
[1:27:17] knew
[1:27:18] if she could just get in that presence
[1:27:21] that all things are possible
[1:27:23] you're seeing it's not our ability the
[1:27:25] world of fire it's not our strength that
[1:27:27] this bride is in a in a bride's revival
[1:27:30] it's god
[1:27:31] it's not our ability and god has sent us
[1:27:34] through some trials to make sure we're
[1:27:37] not going to get tired out in the middle
[1:27:39] of the battle
[1:27:40] to make sure we're not going to get worn
[1:27:42] out in the middle of the battle you go
[1:27:44] when you join the military you go to
[1:27:46] boot camp what are they doing they're
[1:27:48] equipping your body with them strength
[1:27:51] so that you're not going to get tired
[1:27:52] out on the battlefield
[1:27:54] they go through challenges they got to
[1:27:56] run a little bit they got to run with
[1:27:58] their pack on they gotta run with the
[1:28:00] rifle they're equipping them with some
[1:28:03] challenges that's gonna prepare them for
[1:28:05] the upcoming battle
[1:28:08] oh and the guy and god sends us through
[1:28:11] some hard times to equip us with some
[1:28:14] battles ahead
[1:28:16] for some battles ahead brother branham
[1:28:17] tells us the story how when he used to
[1:28:19] box his trainer was called six seconds
[1:28:22] myth he said he was the roughest man he
[1:28:24] had ever met he'd be hitting on him
[1:28:27] hitting on him hitting on him and he
[1:28:28] said but abraham would stop and see my
[1:28:30] you're about to kill me while you're
[1:28:32] being so rough on me his trainer stop
[1:28:34] and he says no matter how athletic you
[1:28:36] are how strong you are for your size how
[1:28:40] trained you are those those licks stop
[1:28:43] the blood
[1:28:44] and you're going to get in the ring and
[1:28:46] take a lick and you're going to be
[1:28:47] knocked out for the count but i'm
[1:28:49] equipping your body
[1:28:52] with some blows so that whenever you get
[1:28:54] in the ring your body is equipped to
[1:28:58] take some blows and when the other ones
[1:29:00] take a blow and it's out for the count
[1:29:03] you can get back up
[1:29:05] come on somebody we've been equipped
[1:29:07] when others go through some trials and
[1:29:09] they're down for the counts you can get
[1:29:11] back up why you've been through some
[1:29:14] hard times you've been through some
[1:29:16] trials but you're standing on this side
[1:29:18] of the trial saying my god is able
[1:29:21] my god has been good to me
[1:29:24] hallelujah his his his purple his
[1:29:27] trainer had a purpose for those
[1:29:29] challenges
[1:29:30] had a purpose
[1:29:32] hallelujah and if you're still on this
[1:29:34] earth you've got a purpose there's
[1:29:36] nothing the devil can do to ever destroy
[1:29:38] that purpose if you look at the three
[1:29:40] hebrew boys i know this is simple
[1:29:42] tonight so hope it's okay the three
[1:29:44] hebrew boys were left alone and felt
[1:29:46] like in the fiery furnace for standing
[1:29:49] up for what they believe god is going to
[1:29:51] make sure that you've got faith in the
[1:29:54] word of god he's going to make sure that
[1:29:57] you know what you're talking about
[1:30:00] and so these three human boys young
[1:30:01] people they weren't adults they were
[1:30:03] young people but they had witnessed
[1:30:05] something on the inside of their life
[1:30:08] that they wasn't going to bow down to
[1:30:10] the image of that day they wasn't going
[1:30:12] to bow down to the spirits of that day
[1:30:15] and uh and the king had told him we're
[1:30:17] going to play the music and you're to
[1:30:19] bow down to this image but these three
[1:30:21] ruby boys says no king
[1:30:24] no king our god is able to deliver us
[1:30:26] and even if he don't
[1:30:29] we're not going to bow
[1:30:31] that's some faith right there knowing
[1:30:33] that god had everything under control
[1:30:38] and as they were going into the fiery
[1:30:39] furnace you remember the branham
[1:30:41] dramatizes it one looks back and says
[1:30:43] that you prayed up oh i'm prayed up the
[1:30:45] other one looks back or you prayed up oh
[1:30:47] yes i'm prayed up the circumstance
[1:30:50] didn't take away their joy the trial
[1:30:52] didn't take away their praise the hard
[1:30:54] times didn't take away their faith but
[1:30:57] that hard time was giving them another
[1:31:00] testimony
[1:31:02] and now their testimony we can point
[1:31:04] back to in that faith
[1:31:07] just like your trials can give faith
[1:31:10] for somebody else going through a hard
[1:31:12] time
[1:31:14] come out somebody my grandma her
[1:31:16] platelets were low and she went through
[1:31:18] hard times her body she struggled and
[1:31:20] struggled when god healed her that gave
[1:31:23] a testimony so that somebody else can
[1:31:26] look back and say if god did it for
[1:31:28] julian martin god can do it for me
[1:31:31] come on somebody if god healed you of
[1:31:33] cancer god can do it for the next person
[1:31:36] don't be ashamed of your testimony don't
[1:31:39] be ashamed for what god has done for you
[1:31:42] hallelujah
[1:31:44] they felt like they're alone in that
[1:31:45] fiery furnace but as they got in the
[1:31:48] heat of the battle that's when god
[1:31:49] showed up he wanted to make sure they
[1:31:52] were going to stand and if they stood
[1:31:54] for him he was going to stand for them
[1:31:56] and if you stand for god god will stand
[1:31:59] for you in every trial in every
[1:32:02] circumstance whatever you go through
[1:32:05] god knows what he's doing and you see
[1:32:07] the king
[1:32:08] this trial was the witness to the king
[1:32:10] that god was alive
[1:32:13] the very one that was sending them
[1:32:15] through trials
[1:32:16] let me say this the co-workers you work
[1:32:18] with may be may be terrible to you but
[1:32:22] the ways you live can be a witness that
[1:32:25] there is a god
[1:32:27] what did the king say did y'all throw
[1:32:29] three men in the fire how come i see
[1:32:31] four and the fourth one looks like the
[1:32:33] son of the living gods the trial
[1:32:36] produced a testimony and a witness to
[1:32:40] the very one that was putting them in
[1:32:42] that trial
[1:32:44] oh you look at daniel 3 and 25 and he
[1:32:46] answered and said lo i see four men
[1:32:48] loose walking in the midst of the fire
[1:32:50] they have no hurt and the form of the
[1:32:53] fourth is like the son of god
[1:32:55] you notice they were still in the trial
[1:32:59] you notice that
[1:33:00] jesus our god didn't come and take them
[1:33:03] out of the trial
[1:33:05] he didn't come and take them out of the
[1:33:06] furnace he came on was with him
[1:33:10] in the furnace
[1:33:11] god may not come and take you how did
[1:33:13] that furnace take you out of that trial
[1:33:16] but he what he will do is he's never
[1:33:18] going to leave you
[1:33:20] he's going to come and be right there in
[1:33:23] every circumstance
[1:33:25] oh we know how brother branham tells us
[1:33:28] how that the angels were up looking and
[1:33:30] says have you seen what's going on down
[1:33:31] there god there's some three believers
[1:33:33] that they're about to throw in the fiery
[1:33:36] furnace and what did god say oh i know

[1:33:43] head knows when a sparrow falls

[1:33:48] going to take his eye off of you
[1:33:52] come on somebody i'm trying to uplift
[1:33:54] your faith you may go through some
[1:33:56] challenges but god's never going to

[1:35:00] promises are so be it by your stripes

[1:35:16] hope this is okay tonight
[1:35:18] so who hath believed our report
[1:35:21] and to whom is the arm of the lord
[1:35:23] revealed
[1:35:24] yeah that's past tense
[1:35:26] in other words you've seen my arm before
[1:35:30] you can see it again just believe the
[1:35:33] reports
[1:35:35] who have believed our report past tense
[1:35:38] and whom has the arm of the lord been
[1:35:40] revealed
[1:35:41] past tense i brought you through some
[1:35:44] trials i brought you through some hard
[1:35:46] times and i can do it again it's a
[1:35:49] challenge to see what you've been to see
[1:35:51] what you're made of you see the arm of
[1:35:54] the lord is the strength of the lord
[1:35:56] it's the power of god you look at luke 1
[1:35:59] 49 for he that is mighty have done to me
[1:36:02] great things in his holy name his mercy
[1:36:06] is on them that fear him from generation
[1:36:08] to generation he has showed strength
[1:36:11] with his arm you look at isaiah 62 and 8
[1:36:15] the lord has sworn by his right hand and
[1:36:18] by the arm of his strength psalm 71 17
[1:36:22] and 7 show thy marvelous loving kindness
[1:36:25] hold thou not save us by thy right hand
[1:36:27] psalms 89 and 13 that was the mighty arm
[1:36:31] and strong is thy hand oh you look at
[1:36:34] psalms 98 and 1 a psalm o sing unto the
[1:36:37] lord a new song for have done marvelous
[1:36:39] things his right hand and his holy arm
[1:36:42] has gotten the victory what am i trying
[1:36:45] to say that's the strength of the lord
[1:36:48] if the arm of the lord has been revealed
[1:36:50] to you that's the power of the almighty
[1:36:52] god that can heal you
[1:36:54] that can that can bring you through
[1:36:56] these trials and he's asking a question
[1:36:59] here you know brother branham says says
[1:37:01] this here and god hiding himself in
[1:37:03] simplicity who have believed the report
[1:37:06] and to whom is the arm of the lord
[1:37:08] revealed he says let me read it again
[1:37:10] now closely who hath believed or report
[1:37:13] questioned and to whom is the arm of the
[1:37:16] lord revealed in other words if you
[1:37:18] believed a report
[1:37:20] then the arm of the lord is revealed
[1:37:23] but first you got to put your faith into
[1:37:26] action
[1:37:28] oh hallelujah god ain't just going to
[1:37:31] come and bring you out of that trial
[1:37:33] you've got something to do you've got to
[1:37:35] take the faith and put it into action
[1:37:38] and say devil i may be in a hard time
[1:37:40] but i'm not giving up
[1:37:44] you got to put your faith into action
[1:37:47] and this here i believe is talking to
[1:37:49] born again believers you look at
[1:37:51] ephesians 2 and 8 for by grace are you
[1:37:53] saved through faith so the very first
[1:37:56] step of being a christian is believing
[1:38:00] them the arm of the lord is being
[1:38:02] revealed but it's only through the holy
[1:38:05] ghost can you see the arm of the lord
[1:38:07] revealed personally
[1:38:09] not just see the arm of the lord he
[1:38:11] didn't say i'm going to show the arm of
[1:38:14] the lord but he says the arm of the lord
[1:38:16] is going to be revealed
[1:38:18] in a personal way and what happens
[1:38:20] whenever you get the holy ghost the arm
[1:38:22] of the lord is personally revealed you
[1:38:25] look at you look at the children of
[1:38:27] israel they have seen the manna come
[1:38:29] from heaven you see they've seen the
[1:38:31] water come out of a rock the the red sea
[1:38:33] was split open they had seen the arm of
[1:38:36] the lord but it personally revealed in
[1:38:38] their lives they had never seen it
[1:38:40] so when they came to the promised land
[1:38:42] what does the bible say they brought an
[1:38:44] evil report when they went into the
[1:38:46] promised land they came back with an
[1:38:48] evil report
[1:38:50] but there was joshua and caleb that came
[1:38:52] back with another report
[1:38:54] so now there's two reports
[1:38:57] they had to choose which part they was
[1:39:00] going to believe
[1:39:01] they got to put their faith into a
[1:39:04] report
[1:39:05] and let me say this you're going to put
[1:39:07] your faith in the doctor's report or in
[1:39:10] god's report you're going to put your
[1:39:12] faith in the devil's report that says
[1:39:15] you're not good enough that says you're
[1:39:17] not worthy or you're going to put your
[1:39:19] report in god's report or put your faith
[1:39:22] in god's report that he says he loves
[1:39:25] you but he's here for you you've got to
[1:39:28] put your faith into something
[1:39:31] but how come joshua and caleb
[1:39:34] going to come back with the report and
[1:39:36] says the land's ours the arm of the lord
[1:39:38] was revealed to him
[1:39:40] oh hallelujah what happened they came
[1:39:43] back with the fruits
[1:39:45] they came back with the grapes the young
[1:39:48] ones didn't have the fruits of the
[1:39:49] spirit
[1:39:51] oh
[1:39:52] follow me follow me this evening joshua
[1:39:54] and caleb came back with the evidence of
[1:39:56] the new land which is a type of the holy
[1:39:58] ghost
[1:39:59] they came back with the fruits of the
[1:40:01] spirit the arm of the lord was revealed
[1:40:03] to them
[1:40:05] and they knew that the same god that
[1:40:08] gave them a promise is the same god that
[1:40:10] can give them their lands
[1:40:13] the other ones didn't have the fruits of
[1:40:14] the spirit
[1:40:16] oh so they couldn't believe the report
[1:40:19] they couldn't see the arm of the lord
[1:40:20] revealed to them but joshua and caleb
[1:40:23] says the arm of the lord's been revealed
[1:40:25] and i know that i can have my mountain i
[1:40:28] can have my inheritance i can have
[1:40:30] whatever god has given to me
[1:40:33] brother branham says is there a person
[1:40:34] here that has never been saved and say
[1:40:36] brother branham remember me i've never
[1:40:38] been born again he says i'm not listen
[1:40:41] you're not saved until you're born again
[1:40:45] my
[1:40:45] it puts it out there pretty plain
[1:40:48] another place you're not a christian
[1:40:50] until you've accepted christ and been
[1:40:52] born by the holy ghost a new creature
[1:40:54] anything less you're lost
[1:40:57] it questions and answers he says now the
[1:40:59] next question is it true you're not
[1:41:02] saved unless you receive the holy ghost
[1:41:04] he says there could take about a good
[1:41:07] five hour discussion on that when you
[1:41:08] accept christ as your savior and are
[1:41:11] then ready for baptism in water you have
[1:41:13] not yet been converted you're only
[1:41:15] believing unto repentance conversions
[1:41:18] means to be changed so without the holy
[1:41:22] ghost you never sing the arm of the lord
[1:41:25] revealed
[1:41:26] hope this is okay this evening you've
[1:41:28] never seen the strength of god
[1:41:30] personally you may say brother josh i've
[1:41:33] got the holy ghost when have i seen the
[1:41:35] arm of the lord revealed he took those
[1:41:37] habits away
[1:41:38] he changed her nature he broke the
[1:41:40] chains of those addictions that's the
[1:41:42] arm of the lord being revealed
[1:41:46] hope this is all coming together tonight
[1:41:48] acts one and eight but you shall receive
[1:41:50] power after the holy ghost has come upon
[1:41:53] you what is the arm of the lord the
[1:41:56] power of god
[1:41:58] so the holy ghost comes and reveals the
[1:42:01] power of god personally
[1:42:03] that's why i say it's a challenge who
[1:42:06] has believed the report i've done works
[1:42:09] in your life time after time after time
[1:42:12] you're going through another challenge
[1:42:14] but just believe the report

[1:45:30] my sons and my daughters may be out
[1:45:32] paying the town red but i'm believing
[1:45:34] the reports we know the story of
[1:45:35] kimberly ware she has seen the arm of
[1:45:38] the lord personally revealed to her and
[1:45:40] now she knew that if god did it for her
[1:45:43] she can he can do it for her brother
[1:45:46] kimberly where was i as a young lady
[1:45:48] from louisiana her brother justin was in
[1:45:51] a rock band in the drugs into this and
[1:45:53] into that but she kept believing that
[1:45:56] her brother was going to be saved and
[1:45:58] brother wayne lawson was down preaching
[1:46:00] on a wednesday night
[1:46:02] a wednesday night where most people come
[1:46:03] to church out of duty
[1:46:06] oh my but this young lady came to church
[1:46:09] with an expectation just see what god
[1:46:11] would do when you come with an
[1:46:13] expectation
[1:46:15] we come out of duty too many times if we
[1:46:17] come out of expectation we can see god
[1:46:21] come in a mighty way service after
[1:46:23] service after service oh hallelujah god
[1:46:27] will do it to you do it for you if you
[1:46:30] come believing and expecting
[1:46:33] so this young lady on a wednesday night
[1:46:35] there was a prayer line this young lady
[1:46:37] went up to the prayer line it says i
[1:46:39] want to see my brother saved justin is
[1:46:41] that home and then the service i believe
[1:46:43] was going to about midnight
[1:46:45] a lot of us would have a cow on a
[1:46:47] wednesday night if the church was going
[1:46:49] till midnight
[1:46:51] but anyways
[1:46:52] it was about midnight justin where was
[1:46:54] in bed
[1:46:55] something woke him up
[1:46:57] i can tell you what woke him up the arm
[1:47:00] of the lord
[1:47:01] the arm of the lord woke him up he got
[1:47:04] up and says i'm lost
[1:47:06] i'm going to hell i'm not ready i'm not
[1:47:09] ready to see god so he ran to his
[1:47:11] sister's bedroom she was gone because
[1:47:13] she was at church oh my he runs to his
[1:47:16] parents bedroom they're at church too he
[1:47:18] says i miss the rapture he runs to the
[1:47:21] neighbor's house which is also about
[1:47:22] church and we go i miss the rapture he
[1:47:26] runs to another one they're at church so
[1:47:28] he's so panicked he says i need to get
[1:47:30] right with god he goes flying to the
[1:47:32] church he runs over a fence and his
[1:47:35] truck pulls into the parking lot and
[1:47:37] dies
[1:47:38] and the deacons come out running grabs
[1:47:40] him takes him into the church then the
[1:47:42] arm of the lord was revealed to him
[1:47:45] personally not just for his sister not
[1:47:48] just for his mama not just for his daddy
[1:47:50] but because of a young lady that wasn't
[1:47:53] going to take no for an answer
[1:47:56] you your prayers can bring salvation for
[1:48:00] your loved ones just believe the report
[1:48:02] of the lord she didn't give up for her
[1:48:06] brother and now he's married has a kid i
[1:48:09] believe he's standing on the promises of
[1:48:11] god
[1:48:14] the arm of the lord was revealed to him
[1:48:18] because there was a young lady that was
[1:48:20] in a challenge that says no
[1:48:22] i'm not giving up
[1:48:24] we can go through testimony after
[1:48:25] testimony my brother caleb my brother
[1:48:28] caleb went through some hard times but
[1:48:30] god came and saved his soul
[1:48:32] we was having a meeting at our church
[1:48:34] and he was in a gang and he was he was
[1:48:36] supposed to be somewhere and doing
[1:48:38] something pretty bad but he didn't want
[1:48:40] to do it and he said i ain't doing that
[1:48:42] and he was scared because the gang was
[1:48:44] going to come after him so he believed
[1:48:46] the only safe place was that church
[1:48:49] and let me say the only safe place is in
[1:48:52] church
[1:48:53] hallelujah so we're having a meeting he
[1:48:56] comes in the church he's sitting there
[1:48:58] the preachers preaching preaching i
[1:49:00] believe it was a friday night
[1:49:02] you see all things work together for the
[1:49:04] good what if we wouldn't have had
[1:49:05] meetings on that friday night where
[1:49:06] would caleb would have win
[1:49:09] all things work together the pastors are
[1:49:12] more spiritual than some people think
[1:49:14] but anyways
[1:49:16] there were some meetings that weekend
[1:49:18] caleb comes and is at the altar weeping
[1:49:20] his way to calvary till after midnight
[1:49:23] it was the arm of the lord my mama never
[1:49:26] gave up on him my daddy never gave up on
[1:49:28] him they kept saying that he's gonna be
[1:49:31] saved and then the arm of the lord was
[1:49:33] revealed to caleb
[1:49:35] now he has the holy ghost he's married
[1:49:37] and has
[1:49:38] four kids i think
[1:49:40] a bunch of them but god did a work for
[1:49:42] his life
[1:49:44] grandma d
[1:49:45] grandma dolores and rebecca's mom god
[1:49:48] did a work for her life and rebecca
[1:49:50] wasn't going to give up on her mama she
[1:49:52] knew that the same god that saved her
[1:49:55] soul can save her mama
[1:49:58] oh when everybody else gave up on her
[1:50:00] there was somebody that says i'm
[1:50:02] believing the report of the lord oh
[1:50:05] don't give up on your loved ones don't
[1:50:07] give up on your children don't give up
[1:50:09] on your parents don't give up on your
[1:50:11] brothers and your sisters believe the
[1:50:13] report of the lord
[1:50:15] and watch the arm or the strength of the
[1:50:18] lord mighty in action
[1:50:20] mighty in battle the third polling just
[1:50:23] for the prophet
[1:50:24] the third poll is operating inside of
[1:50:27] the brides
[1:50:28] oh hallelujah well you remember brother
[1:50:30] and i must tell them the story of the
[1:50:32] three squirrels hope this is okay tell
[1:50:34] them the story of the squirrels at
[1:50:36] hattie wright's house i believe
[1:50:38] and hallie wright was hearing the report
[1:50:41] and she stood up and says that's nothing
[1:50:43] but the truth
[1:50:45] she had experienced the power of god
[1:50:47] before
[1:50:49] and since she had believed the report
[1:50:51] before she's saying this is of god i'm
[1:50:54] going to believe it again that's nothing
[1:50:56] but the truth
[1:50:57] and see that's what happens when there's
[1:50:59] somebody saying amen in church they're
[1:51:02] hearing the report of the lord and
[1:51:04] saying amen so be it that's the truth
[1:51:08] what that preacher is talking about is
[1:51:10] for me
[1:51:11] what the pastor is talking about is for
[1:51:13] me amen so be it that's nothing but the
[1:51:17] truth
[1:51:18] hallelujah
[1:51:20] so she said that's nothing but the
[1:51:21] triple branham stop and he says you
[1:51:24] speak the word
[1:51:25] so no longer is this creative power
[1:51:28] inside of the prophet
[1:51:30] but because it was taken by faith this
[1:51:33] power us now with howdy right
[1:51:35] he says you speak the word whatever you
[1:51:37] have need of you're poor you ask for a
[1:51:39] million dollars it'll be right here
[1:51:41] you're your sister i believe was a
[1:51:43] i believe and she said you speak
[1:51:45] the word for her and she'll get well
[1:51:48] whatever you have need of you know my
[1:51:51] she wasn't selfish
[1:51:52] she wasn't selfish she says i want my
[1:51:54] boys to be saved those boys were over
[1:51:57] there laughing at him that's saying that
[1:51:59] they're making fun of it but she says i
[1:52:01] want my boys to be saved and she says
[1:52:04] hey brother brandon says i give them to
[1:52:06] you those boys fell over gave their
[1:52:08] hearts to christ
[1:52:10] that's not an emotion that's not a
[1:52:12] sensation that's the strength of the
[1:52:14] lord being revealed
[1:52:17] that's an impossible situation those
[1:52:19] boys didn't want nothing to do with god
[1:52:22] but it was a prayer of a mama
[1:52:25] it was a prayer of obama that says these
[1:52:27] boys are mine you gave me a promise god
[1:52:30] and i'm not going to let the devil take
[1:52:32] him away from me
[1:52:36] and that's just not for hatty right
[1:52:38] that's for the bride
[1:52:40] you've got the power
[1:52:42] to say satan get out of my body
[1:52:45] you've got the power to say satan you're
[1:52:47] not plaguing my mind any longer you've
[1:52:50] got the power to say satan i'm accepting
[1:52:53] the challenge he's the same yesterday
[1:52:55] today and forever this ain't my this
[1:52:58] ain't my my my words it's the word of
[1:53:01] the lord brother branham says i'm
[1:53:03] thankful tonight for supernatural the
[1:53:05] holy ghost god's flame a fire who could
[1:53:08] come down in the human heart and burn
[1:53:10] out sin unbelief don't harm the person
[1:53:13] but to purchase him there it is daniel
[1:53:15] the holy ghost purges you as he was
[1:53:17] talking about earlier it purges you it
[1:53:20] makes it makes you grow stronger more
[1:53:22] faith here comes tonight he came down

[1:53:27] of cancer of that tumor of that
[1:53:30] tuberculosis with fire the heavenly holy
[1:53:33] spirit a fire falling from god out of
[1:53:36] heaven he says my that's no mystery if
[1:53:39] he can burn out sin how much more can he
[1:53:43] burn out cancer by the same holy ghost

[1:54:16] preacher here heal

[1:54:39] midst

[1:54:47] message in its fullness because we're
[1:54:49] not backing up our the message god
[1:54:51] himself is backing up the message you're
[1:54:54] not backing up your faith god's backing
[1:54:57] up your faith

[1:55:00] of god it's god backing it up brother

[1:55:13] healing well we let you know that your
[1:55:15] pastor we let you know that your pastor
[1:55:18] is a man of god just as a much authority

[1:55:28] than them men that's on the field today
[1:55:30] praying for the sick your pastor has the
[1:55:33] same authority
[1:55:36] come on somebody we don't need brother
[1:55:37] branham here to have a prayer line and
[1:55:40] for you to be healed we need the same
[1:55:42] god that was in brother branham's
[1:55:44] meeting to be here
[1:55:46] hallelujah but you've got to believe the
[1:55:49] report of the lord remember the woman
[1:55:51] had the issue of blood she had tried
[1:55:53] doctor after doctor after doctor her
[1:55:56] faith was starting to get weary but
[1:55:58] christ not a preacher
[1:56:01] come on somebody not a preacher not a
[1:56:04] prophet not this one not that one but
[1:56:06] christ walk by her way
[1:56:09] service after service christ walks by
[1:56:12] your way
[1:56:14] but since we're not aware who's in our
[1:56:17] presence
[1:56:18] come on somebody we come to church and
[1:56:20] we're not aware that the same god that
[1:56:24] spoke flies into existence in moses
[1:56:26] moses day is the same god here the same
[1:56:30] god that healed and raised up a dead man
[1:56:32] for jesus is the same god that's here
[1:56:35] the same god that was in brother
[1:56:37] branham's meetings is the same god here
[1:56:40] but we're not aware of her too many
[1:56:42] times because we're not willing to fight
[1:56:45] past the mind battles
[1:56:47] oh hallelujah fight pass the mind
[1:56:50] battles but this woman says i'm going to
[1:56:53] get my healing i'm not passing up my
[1:56:55] opportunity this is my time my service
[1:56:58] my moment
[1:57:00] and she was willing to get on her hands
[1:57:01] and knees and crawl till she got to the
[1:57:04] master and she touched the hymn of his
[1:57:06] garments
[1:57:07] jesus stopped and he said who touched me
[1:57:11] something touched me virtue went out of
[1:57:13] my body now the the disciples rebuked
[1:57:16] him jesus there's people everywhere see
[1:57:19] he preached up and says oh no there's a
[1:57:21] certain one
[1:57:22] somebody touched me
[1:57:24] there was somebody the bible says it was
[1:57:27] a certain woman
[1:57:28] there's a certain woman she wasn't just
[1:57:30] a special woman but it was somebody that
[1:57:33] had faith
[1:57:34] she was certain that if she could get to
[1:57:37] jesus
[1:57:38] her condition could be made well and i
[1:57:41] believe there's a certain woman in this
[1:57:44] last day inside of faith tabernacle on a
[1:57:47] sunday afternoon that's certain that
[1:57:49] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[1:57:53] and forever
[1:57:55] it was a certain woman
[1:57:57] she wasn't her faith wasn't looking up
[1:57:59] the doctor's report her faith was in
[1:58:02] god's
[1:58:03] hallelujah
[1:58:05] and we know what happened she got her
[1:58:07] healing
[1:58:08] she tried physician after physician but
[1:58:10] one moment a moment with dr jesus made
[1:58:13] her well in one moment with dr jesus you
[1:58:17] may say what was the secret she had to
[1:58:19] recognize who was in her midst
[1:58:22] oh everybody else didn't recognize it
[1:58:24] but she recognized it
[1:58:26] you remember i believe it was simon that
[1:58:28] had jesus over to make fun of him
[1:58:30] brother branham says and i believe it
[1:58:32] was it was a prostitute that recognized
[1:58:35] that was jesus
[1:58:36] the preachers didn't recognize it the
[1:58:38] priest didn't recognize it this this one
[1:58:41] about she wasn't even invited to church
[1:58:44] invited to that moment but she
[1:58:46] recognized that the power the presence
[1:58:49] that was inside of that man can change
[1:58:51] her life and she was willing to
[1:58:54] sacrifice all she was saying i believe
[1:58:56] the reports of the lord
[1:58:59] and she was willing to crawl her way to
[1:59:02] jesus feet and what happened is she
[1:59:05] started to wash his feet with her tears
[1:59:07] and dry it with her hair what was that
[1:59:09] it was reverence she was willing to
[1:59:11] submit herself to christ
[1:59:14] are you willing to submit that sickness
[1:59:17] to christ
[1:59:18] submit that complex to christ submit

[1:59:36] just be aware who's in your presence
[1:59:39] who's in your midst
[1:59:41] someone rebuked him and says you know
[1:59:42] who this is oh yeah i know who this is

[2:20:40] brother branham says any men
[2:20:43] or women
[2:20:44] that ever make real warriors
[2:20:47] in the kingdom of god is perfectly
[2:20:50] unconscious
[2:20:51] to their faith
[2:20:54] he said you keep trying to test your
[2:20:56] faith
[2:20:57] well i wonder if i've got enough to do
[2:20:59] this
[2:21:00] see have i got faith
[2:21:02] he said don't test your faith
[2:21:05] everybody say don't test your faith
[2:21:09] god said so
[2:21:11] do it anyhow

[2:21:29] to fast a while and test your faith to
[2:21:31] see if you've got enough faith to drive

[2:21:38] you believe it
[2:21:40] and that's the way
