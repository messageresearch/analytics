[42:47] tell you where and uh but brother Kelly
[42:50] Hil de brand and his his father and and
[42:54] doing a just a wonderful work up there
[42:57] and uh but uh so we just uh just really
[43:00] honored to have him and uh wished his
[43:03] whole family could come but uh uh he's
[43:06] got brother Isaac as a sidekick and and
[43:10] uh so hopefully we'll get him to sing or
[43:12] whatever and uh so but we want him to
[43:15] come if everybody could just stand to
[43:17] your feet and I think this is the most
[43:20] important part of the service is uh the
[43:23] word of God and um you know the the
[43:27] message taught us that Christ is the
[43:30] word he's more than just Spirit he is he
[43:33] is
[43:34] word and um if if he could just speak to
[43:39] our hearts that's what we want that that
[43:42] word to come and whether it's reproof
[43:45] whether it's just encouragement whatever
[43:48] it is but I I've I've I'm a witness that
[43:51] if you're dealing with something in your
[43:53] life whether it's sin whether it's
[43:56] oppression
[43:57] discouragement whether it's just
[43:59] sickness or whatever it is physically
[44:02] mentally spiritually when that word
[44:05] comes forth it has the ability to drive
[44:07] them Spirits away and break the feathers
[44:11] I've seen it amen time and time again
[44:14] I've had it happen in my life there's
[44:17] times that I have come and visiting
[44:19] Minister coming and just fighting things
[44:23] in my mind maybe
[44:24] discouragement and uh and and you know
[44:28] you're you're worshiping God and
[44:30] entering in and then the the ministers
[44:33] just start speaking and it's almost like
[44:34] he's personally directing it to you and
[44:38] and I've just had the that that burden
[44:40] just lift and I know the power of the
[44:43] word I know what it is that if we could
[44:46] just believe it and and receive it and
[44:49] just amen the word it doesn't matter
[44:52] who's preaching it it just matters the
[44:54] word Goes Forth amen and if we can just
[44:57] believe it and how many's got a need in
[44:59] your heart and whatever it would be amen
[45:02] I've seen the physical blind eyes open
[45:05] just by the preaching of the gospel I've
[45:07] seen the crippled walk just through the
[45:09] preaching of the gospel I've seen The
[45:12] Sinner saved by the preaching of the
[45:14] gospel and I promise you God is here to
[45:17] do that today amen praise the Lord so
[45:20] let's just sing it again in the presence

[56:50] because we're on the same diet amen and
[56:53] and there's this connection by that Same

[56:59] times how do we get into the bride and
[57:03] it's by one Spirit you are baptized into
[57:06] one body amen it's not a church it's not
[57:09] a group uh in terms of a fellowship a
[57:12] hall but it's a universal bride member
[57:16] that's coming together amen and and I
[57:18] just love the uh the message for that uh
[57:22] not bringing us out of balance but uh
[57:25] zeroing Us in on the target amen

[58:57] Samuel
[58:59] 17:32 and David said to Saul let no
[59:02] man's heart fail because of him thy
[59:05] servant will go and fight with this
[59:08] Philistine verse
[59:09] 33 and Saul said to David Thou Art not
[59:13] able to go against this Philistine to
[59:16] fight with him for thou art but a youth
[59:19] and he a man of war from his Youth and
[59:22] David said unto Saul thy servant has kep
[59:26] his father's sheep and there came a lion
[59:28] and a bear and took a lamb out of the
[59:31] flock and I went out after him and smote
[59:34] him and delivered it out of his mouth
[59:38] and when he arose against me I caught
[59:41] him by his beard and smote him and slew
[59:44] him thy servant slew both The Lion and
[59:48] the bear and this uncircumcised
[59:50] Philistine shall be as one of them

[1:00:06] church and what it stands for Lord and
[1:00:09] thankful for your word Lord how it's

[1:00:59] are struggling in mental battle would
[1:01:01] have Victory today Father we believe
[1:01:03] that you're able to do that and we're
[1:01:06] looking forward to the victories we ask
[1:01:08] it for your blessing Lord For Your Glory
[1:01:12] in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you
[1:01:16] you're welcome to have your seats
[1:01:21] and amen from David's youth uh he knew
[1:01:25] that he was sent from God because he had
[1:01:28] gifts and callings the Bible tells us
[1:01:30] are without repentance election and
[1:01:33] calling is sure and David he'd learned
[1:01:35] that it's not him that willth nor him
[1:01:38] that runneth but it was God that showeth
[1:01:40] Mercy it's not necessarily what I want
[1:01:44] but it's to do the will of God Amen and
[1:01:47] for us we as Christians know it's God's
[1:01:50] will to save the Lost can we say amen
[1:01:53] and we know that it's God's will to heal
[1:01:55] the sick do you believe believe that
[1:01:57] amen healing is in God's promise it's in
[1:01:59] the word and salvation is is God's
[1:02:02] promise it's in the word and and we know
[1:02:04] we believe that God's word it never
[1:02:06] fails amen so during the early years of
[1:02:10] David knowing this in his own heart uh
[1:02:12] the nation of Israel had went off into a
[1:02:15] bad spot and they had wanted to be like
[1:02:17] the world and and they had said give us
[1:02:20] a king and so God had given them a king
[1:02:23] after the people's heart King Saul and
[1:02:26] and Saul rose up uh you know little in
[1:02:29] his own eyes but with time as God gave
[1:02:32] Victory he became puffed up feeling that
[1:02:35] he really was a somebody that he really
[1:02:37] had part to play and and we know that
[1:02:40] brother brandham taught us that when
[1:02:41] that happens God just puts you on the
[1:02:44] Shelf until you humble yourself back
[1:02:46] down and then he can use you again
[1:02:49] Hallelujah so David had seen this and uh
[1:02:52] and and he was uh uh preparing himself
[1:02:55] God preparing him rather for the work
[1:02:58] that was coming ahead amen they wanted
[1:03:01] to be like the rest of the world so God
[1:03:03] gave them a king and and and I've heard
[1:03:05] it myself at times where you'll go to a
[1:03:08] church and somebody will say well you
[1:03:10] know we we would like to uh go to the
[1:03:12] movies uh or or this church here they
[1:03:15] they allow girls to cut their hair uh or
[1:03:18] this church that they wear the short
[1:03:19] dresses and and and I've said well why
[1:03:23] would we want to go on the devil's
[1:03:24] territory Hallelujah
[1:03:26] we've been given the privilege to live
[1:03:28] above those things of the world can we
[1:03:30] say Amen so we don't want to be like
[1:03:32] those uh uh seeking Assa going after you
[1:03:36] know the the ways and the effects of the
[1:03:38] other assemblies per se if there be some
[1:03:40] like that here but we want to stay on
[1:03:42] that straight and narrow way knowing
[1:03:44] that it leads to safety hallelujah amen
[1:03:48] bless the Lord now now I'm not really a
[1:03:51] legalist myself but I believe that the
[1:03:54] gospel can change a person person
[1:03:56] Hallelujah we don't have to cope with
[1:03:58] Spirits we don't have to uh uh deal with
[1:04:01] demons in our lives but we believe in
[1:04:03] total Deliverance Hallelujah we believe
[1:04:06] that we can arise and be free it's our
[1:04:10] privilege being a blessed Children of
[1:04:13] the Lord amen now a true filling of the
[1:04:16] Holy Spirit just changes everything
[1:04:20] Hallelujah it'll save you it'll clean up
[1:04:23] your life it'll cleanse every dirty spot
[1:04:26] we sing that song what can wash away my
[1:04:29] sins now all man was born in sin and
[1:04:32] came into the world speaking lies
[1:04:34] Hallelujah and when Jesus came he hasn't
[1:04:38] redeemed our flesh yet now our Spirits
[1:04:41] have been redeemed but our flesh well it
[1:04:43] still gets sick and you know there's
[1:04:46] there's times where even Paul said when
[1:04:49] I do good evil is present we make
[1:04:52] mistakes and but that isn't our Destiny
[1:04:56] we're moving to a body that'll be
[1:04:58] perfect that is very soon in the
[1:05:01] peripheral it's just ahead of down the
[1:05:03] road but down here we may be struggling
[1:05:05] just a little bit at times with oh I did
[1:05:09] that the other day and the devil's
[1:05:11] coming and he's beating on your mind
[1:05:14] with
[1:05:14] condemnation and all you have to do is
[1:05:17] say thank you Jesus for the blood
[1:05:20] there's a crimson stream that's flowing
[1:05:23] and it and it makes me white as snow
[1:05:26] I was seen in Revelations as a bride in
[1:05:29] a perfect spotless garment now that was
[1:05:32] not my perfection but Christ came and
[1:05:35] perfected me Hallelujah do you believe
[1:05:38] that amen and he makes my temple
[1:05:41] beautiful in his in his sight in the
[1:05:44] book of Jude the Bible says and unto the
[1:05:46] only true wise God who is able to keep
[1:05:49] me from
[1:05:50] falling well what a powerful state to be
[1:05:54] able to be uh uh to eliminate falling
[1:05:58] but you know that word they falling
[1:06:00] doesn't mean exempt from mistakes it
[1:06:03] means not a Cast Away seeing how Satan
[1:06:08] fell out of Heaven as a cast away no
[1:06:11] longer no more remission for his sin he
[1:06:14] was cast out he fell from his seat but
[1:06:20] God is able to keep me from falling
[1:06:24] Hallelujah I believe David had quite a
[1:06:26] personal testimony about this point
[1:06:29] right here because David was not a
[1:06:32] perfect
[1:06:33] man but David served a perfect God
[1:06:38] Amen Hallelujah not only does Jesus save
[1:06:42] me his power continues to keep me saved
[1:06:47] Hallelujah not only does he heal me but
[1:06:49] he continues to keep me healed when I
[1:06:52] get sick again amen and we know that
[1:06:55] David was a man after God's Own Heart
[1:06:58] brother brandham said that he was
[1:06:59] actually a Divine healer he healed with
[1:07:02] music hallelujah how many enjoyed our
[1:07:04] musicians up here today aren't you
[1:07:07] grateful to be blessed by those amen
[1:07:09] let's give them a hand
[1:07:11] amen
[1:07:13] hallelujah amen I I started playing the
[1:07:17] uh the piano at our assembly when I was
[1:07:19] 15 years old um judah's age I guess and
[1:07:23] uh and i' been I'm still playing it
[1:07:26] uh um with a lot of encouragement uh so
[1:07:29] those of you that are musicians it's a
[1:07:32] battle you know and and and your mind
[1:07:34] thinks well I'm not good
[1:07:36] enough but you are because it's
[1:07:40] predestined that you'd be doing it how
[1:07:43] do we know that because you're doing it
[1:07:46] so it's God's plan to have you there and
[1:07:50] so you can be confident that you didn't
[1:07:52] put yourself in that spot I trust but
[1:07:55] God placed you there so that way you
[1:07:58] could be a blessing to the body amen a
[1:08:01] and so in that God will use that music
[1:08:05] to heal yes he'll use that music to
[1:08:08] bring Deliverance Hallelujah he'll use
[1:08:11] that music to prepare for the moving of
[1:08:13] the word it says that way when this
[1:08:15] preaching comes forth there will be
[1:08:17] Deliverance do you do you believe that
[1:08:19] amen so we're thankful for god-given
[1:08:22] talented musicians now I I am not not
[1:08:26] well taught um I I just play by ear
[1:08:29] mostly um and I I make lots of mistakes
[1:08:33] we have a a a theme back home if you hit
[1:08:36] the wrong note twice they'll think it
[1:08:37] was
[1:08:40] right I don't know if it's a good one
[1:08:42] but that's the way we do it back home
[1:08:45] Hallelujah and you know it just takes a
[1:08:47] little bit of that nervousness away it
[1:08:49] is that way it's not about playing it
[1:08:52] right it's not about being the best
[1:08:53] preacher it's not about
[1:08:56] but it's just Allowing God to use you
[1:08:57] and and you know I would play and as a
[1:08:59] young man I'd be coming up and I'd be
[1:09:01] thinking sometimes you know I'm getting
[1:09:03] better I'm getting pretty good and and
[1:09:05] then I would just really mess up the
[1:09:08] next song you know and I realized that I
[1:09:11] needed to pray and you know it's it's
[1:09:13] almost like being a minister you're
[1:09:16] you're fighting devil spirits and we
[1:09:19] seen David fighting off these evil
[1:09:21] spirits with his harp as he would come
[1:09:24] in you know think about this out of a
[1:09:26] two million some odd people how would
[1:09:29] they have found David to be a cunning
[1:09:31] player of the harp you know he was on
[1:09:34] the backs side of the desert forgotten
[1:09:35] when Samuel came and somehow he was
[1:09:39] noted to be a cunning player of the harp
[1:09:43] I don't have any Scripture on it but I
[1:09:44] think they must have had some sort of a
[1:09:46] recital you know sometime where they
[1:09:49] come together and and that that playing
[1:09:52] would have just calmed people you know
[1:09:54] and and
[1:09:55] somebody in that high level close to the
[1:09:58] king would have remembered there was
[1:10:01] somebody because their mind went well
[1:10:04] Saul needs to be freed of this evil
[1:10:06] spirit now remember Saul was not lost he
[1:10:08] just lost his position while he was in
[1:10:10] the flesh because of a mistake but Saul
[1:10:13] was saved he went to Paradise you
[1:10:15] remember right but now we're going to
[1:10:18] send David and they found David this
[1:10:21] cunning player of the harp amen it just
[1:10:25] brought brought a lot of joy to my my
[1:10:27] heart when I thought how David was found
[1:10:29] and moved into position and I believe
[1:10:32] it's the same uh for every musician uh
[1:10:36] they are called by God for a a position
[1:10:39] for a
[1:10:42] role Hallelujah to be used for his glory
[1:10:46] to create that atmosphere so when you're
[1:10:49] all said and done and and you're done
[1:10:51] criticizing you make sure you look at
[1:10:53] that musician and you thank them for
[1:10:56] their their efforts you know thank you
[1:10:58] sis and each one that was up here the
[1:11:00] the guitar and the bass player and and
[1:11:02] all of that it's a tremendous blessing
[1:11:06] amen and God will just continue if you
[1:11:08] stay humble to move you further into
[1:11:11] your ministry and all of a sudden you'll
[1:11:13] be like me looking 25 years behind you
[1:11:16] and thinking I don't know how I got this
[1:11:18] far but I made it and you you'll
[1:11:22] probably quit a few times but you know
[1:11:24] just brandom the Bible tells us to just
[1:11:27] get up and try again don't don't be
[1:11:31] embarrassed Hallelujah I've turned quite
[1:11:33] red at times but
[1:11:35] hallelujah it's good for
[1:11:38] you you know God's doing something when
[1:11:42] you're in that spot and here David was
[1:11:44] being
[1:11:45] trained he was moved close to the king
[1:11:48] to see how a king needed to
[1:11:50] operate it's just awesome how God does
[1:11:53] things
[1:11:55] God testified of David in Acts 13:22 he
[1:11:59] says and when he had removed him he
[1:12:02] raised up unto them David to be their
[1:12:04] King a removed Saul to whom also he gave
[1:12:08] testimony and said I have found David
[1:12:11] the son of Jesse a man after mine own
[1:12:15] heart which shall fulfill all my will
[1:12:19] Hallelujah that was God's testimony what
[1:12:21] a what a testimony you know you can look
[1:12:24] at that time and really there was a a
[1:12:26] quite a church split that happened over
[1:12:28] there uh in Israel when David came to
[1:12:32] the throne the whole Kingdom became
[1:12:33] divided and David was over here and it
[1:12:36] was it Jobo uh I think it was uh was
[1:12:40] over here and and it looked like David
[1:12:43] was out of the will of God but he was
[1:12:45] the anointed the one that was risen up
[1:12:49] to bring Deliverance to Israel
[1:12:53] Hallelujah now we're getting a little
[1:12:54] ahead of ourselves but won't try to
[1:12:56] otherwise I'll be way longer than
[1:12:57] brother
[1:12:59] Sean God provided
[1:13:02] Hallelujah we thank the Lord in
[1:13:04] Deuteronomy 30:6 the Bible says and the
[1:13:07] Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart
[1:13:11] and the Heart of thy seed to love the
[1:13:13] Lord thy God with all thine heart and
[1:13:18] with all thy soul that thou mayest live
[1:13:22] and that's just the thing you might feel
[1:13:24] that I am I'm not qualified but God will
[1:13:28] circumcise thine heart and your seed
[1:13:31] that are after you to love the Lord thy
[1:13:35] God with all thine heart and that's our
[1:13:38] subject today with all our heart an
[1:13:41] important key in David's life is David
[1:13:43] was quick to ask for forgiveness when he
[1:13:45] fell he was quick to be obedient to the
[1:13:48] will of God noticing that mistakes don't
[1:13:51] separate you from God but remaining in
[1:13:55] error is what separates you because when
[1:13:57] you're in that spot you've allowed the
[1:13:59] devil to talk you out of the word
[1:14:02] hallelujah in FA Faith once delivered to
[1:14:04] the Saints brother brandom says I got
[1:14:07] lots of respect for a man when he does
[1:14:09] make a mistake he's got courage enough
[1:14:12] to rise and try
[1:14:15] again we're all going to make mistakes
[1:14:18] the best makes mistakes but a soldier is
[1:14:21] not one who will lie down when he's
[1:14:23] knocked down but with rise up again we
[1:14:27] used to sing this little song Let Me
[1:14:29] rise and try again and I like that for I
[1:14:31] have made brother brandom saying I have
[1:14:34] made many mistakes in my life as we all
[1:14:38] have but I've always been thankful to
[1:14:41] God for Grace to let me rise and try
[1:14:46] again not a cast away but to him that's
[1:14:50] able to keep you from falling Hallelujah
[1:14:52] so don't focus on what was done right
[1:14:55] wrong whether it was you or someone else
[1:14:57] but focus on the promise made by God
[1:15:01] Almighty and rise and try again
[1:15:05] everything David did he did it with all
[1:15:07] of his heart over in Psalms 42:1 David
[1:15:11] said as the heart panteth after the
[1:15:13] water Brook so panteth my soul after
[1:15:16] thee Oh God my soul thirsteth for God
[1:15:19] for the Living God When shall I come and
[1:15:22] appear before him hallelujah what a
[1:15:25] confidence David gained by putting his
[1:15:27] whole trust his whole being all his
[1:15:30] faith rested with God not with David no
[1:15:33] but he put his trust in one that could
[1:15:36] not fail Hallelujah in Psalms 27:1 the
[1:15:40] Bible says the Lord is my light and my
[1:15:44] salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is
[1:15:47] the strength of my life of whom shall I
[1:15:50] be afraid when the wicked even my
[1:15:52] enemies and my foes come upon on me to
[1:15:55] eat up my flesh they stumble and fall
[1:15:58] though an host should encamp against me
[1:16:01] with my my heart shall not fear say me
[1:16:05] my heart shall not fear Hallelujah
[1:16:09] though War should rise against me in
[1:16:12] this will I be confident because God's
[1:16:15] already fought that battle for us the
[1:16:18] battle is the Lord's but the Victory Is
[1:16:21] Ours amen aren't you grateful that he's
[1:16:24] figh fighting your battles for you
[1:16:26] Hallelujah the one that's never lost the
[1:16:29] battle is standing at the very entrance
[1:16:32] of your battle saying put me into action
[1:16:35] but you've got to call him on the scene
[1:16:37] you've got to say I Trust You Lord just
[1:16:39] like David did you've got to say I
[1:16:42] believe you can deliver me and then God
[1:16:44] will come moving on the scene he might
[1:16:47] do it a little different avenue than
[1:16:48] what you'd like it it might be like what
[1:16:51] are you doing God I don't know but
[1:16:53] that's because that's God's way
[1:16:55] amen not our way God's not going to
[1:16:58] deliver us by according to our way but
[1:17:01] God will come in his perfect will and
[1:17:04] he'll bring things to pass amen amen do
[1:17:07] you believe that wisdom to man is
[1:17:09] foolish to God but wisdom to God
[1:17:13] sometimes we don't understand it but
[1:17:15] it's still God's wisdom Amen in
[1:17:18] possessing all things brother brandom
[1:17:19] says the promise is yours but if you
[1:17:23] ever get it you ain't going to get it
[1:17:25] easy I'm going to tell you that you're
[1:17:27] going to have to take it away from Satan
[1:17:31] Satan captures your health you've got a
[1:17:33] right to go to Satan and say give it
[1:17:35] back hand it over I come in the name of
[1:17:38] the Lord the possessor of heavens and
[1:17:40] earth and I'm his Heir say that's
[1:17:43] me Hallelujah give it back brother
[1:17:46] brandom says you took my child you got
[1:17:49] her mixed up with the wrong boy or you
[1:17:51] took my boy and mixed him up with the
[1:17:53] wrong girl but I claim claim them that's
[1:17:56] right I claim my children I claim my
[1:17:58] brother I claim my sister yes Satan
[1:18:01] you've took them from God's house you've
[1:18:03] coaxed them out there but I'm coming
[1:18:05] after them I claim them do you believe
[1:18:08] that now we as adopted children we
[1:18:11] possess the deed the tital deed given to
[1:18:14] us at Calvary it's mine devil amen we
[1:18:17] could say give me back my health when
[1:18:19] we're sick amen we could say give me
[1:18:22] back my joy when we lose our joy thank
[1:18:25] the Lord give me back my marriage if
[1:18:27] there's trouble in your marriage give me
[1:18:29] back my child give it back Satan it's my
[1:18:33] property do you believe that amen my
[1:18:36] father owns it and I come by a right of
[1:18:40] inheritance I'm his child amen we know
[1:18:43] the Bible says healing is the children's
[1:18:45] bread Hallelujah I would that my people
[1:18:47] would be well so if you're sick just
[1:18:50] take the promise and don't look at the
[1:18:53] symptoms brother brandom taught us but
[1:18:54] you look to that promise and you say
[1:18:56] that is my promise I am walking towards
[1:18:59] my promise by his stripes I am healed
[1:19:02] victory is mine Hallelujah I'm going to
[1:19:05] arise and I'm going to be well amen
[1:19:09] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thy
[1:19:12] and thy house shall be saved it doesn't
[1:19:15] just say part of your house it says all
[1:19:18] of your house can we say all Hallelujah
[1:19:22] that is your possession God didn't just
[1:19:24] give you some serpent seat for kids God
[1:19:27] has given you bride
[1:19:29] seats Hallelujah do you believe that
[1:19:35] amen
[1:19:37] hallelujah those are ours and we are
[1:19:41] Gods so by a right of adoption we can
[1:19:46] come and we can say with authority that
[1:19:49] is my child amen hallelujah they might
[1:19:52] get worse but they're coming home
[1:19:54] [Music]
[1:19:57] amen amen I I wrote that song we're
[1:20:00] we're taking our families our loved ones
[1:20:02] and our children we're not going to
[1:20:04] leave no one behind uh we just had a a
[1:20:07] brother in our church that's my age that
[1:20:09] just walked away from his family and
[1:20:11] went into the world and and God inspired
[1:20:14] me to write that song for him because I
[1:20:17] believe that we're not going to lose a
[1:20:19] one we're not leaving a hoof behind we
[1:20:22] don't have to settle for some broken and
[1:20:24] tore up life down here but we can go
[1:20:27] after them and we can claim them our
[1:20:29] Prophet taught us that do you believe
[1:20:31] that that is our property amen oh they
[1:20:35] might get scars they might be a little
[1:20:36] bit like Samson they might step aside
[1:20:39] and and and not give God their entire
[1:20:41] heart and they'll suffer for that well
[1:20:43] they'll reap what they
[1:20:45] sow but Samson was still an elected
[1:20:49] bride member and he's going to be there
[1:20:52] whether his his hair got cut and it
[1:20:54] wasn't supposed to or not he'll be there
[1:20:57] whether he went after the wrong
[1:20:58] girlfriend or not Hallelujah but God
[1:21:02] will bring him there and God will do the
[1:21:04] same for your child there's no
[1:21:05] circumstance too hard Our God Is Bigger
[1:21:09] he's powerful more Mighty than anything
[1:21:12] the devil has the devil's just a
[1:21:15] counterfeit do you believe that
[1:21:17] Hallelujah so we can have confidence
[1:21:20] when we pray we can ask anything in the
[1:21:24] name of Jesus Jesus Christ and it shall
[1:21:27] be granted that's the word that's what
[1:21:30] we believe amen that's right we're
[1:21:33] Believers Devils so step aside in the
[1:21:36] name of Jesus Christ who's given us the
[1:21:39] right that we could ask anything in his
[1:21:41] name Hallelujah in John 14:14 the Bible
[1:21:45] says if you ask anything in my name I
[1:21:47] will do it so give back our property
[1:21:51] devil whether it's sickness whether it's
[1:21:53] doubt what whatever it is maybe you're
[1:21:55] questioning something you just go and
[1:21:57] you take back your property you say he's
[1:21:59] promised to give me a sound mind I can
[1:22:02] have peace I don't have to be all tore
[1:22:04] up I can have freedom in the love divine
[1:22:09] amen now the devil he'd stolen from
[1:22:10] shamgar for years but there came a day
[1:22:13] when shamgar he just had enough and he
[1:22:16] stood with faith against the enemy and
[1:22:18] the enemy fell now it wasn't shamgar
[1:22:21] that killed that devil it was his hand
[1:22:23] that done it but it was the power of God
[1:22:25] that delivered shamgar do you believe
[1:22:27] that Hallelujah there was a time when
[1:22:30] Gideon needed to be stirred up and God
[1:22:32] chose Gideon Hallelujah and Gideon stood
[1:22:36] whether with lots or with few and he
[1:22:39] conquered the enemy was it Gideon that
[1:22:41] done it it was God that done it Gideon
[1:22:43] was their present Hallelujah we heard a
[1:22:46] song on the three Hebrew children
[1:22:48] Hallelujah and those boys they had faith
[1:22:51] in the word of God and they believed in
[1:22:53] the promise Hallelujah
[1:22:55] they didn't have any Scripture they
[1:22:56] didn't have any word for it but they
[1:22:58] knew that there was a God in heaven that
[1:23:01] could interpret dreams that could uh uh
[1:23:04] tell them what was happening and they
[1:23:06] believed in their prophet of the day
[1:23:09] Hallelujah so they said well we don't
[1:23:11] know if we'll be delivered from the fire
[1:23:13] or not but we believe and we're not
[1:23:16] willing to bow down to worship some Idol
[1:23:19] hallelujah amen and they was delivered
[1:23:23] Daniel was not armed by the Lions
[1:23:26] Hallelujah was it Daniel that protected
[1:23:28] himself no it was God that came down and
[1:23:31] protected so I'm I'm telling yes amen it
[1:23:35] it's not you that's got the power but
[1:23:38] you've got the
[1:23:39] authority you've got the title deed in
[1:23:42] your hand and you can look at that devil
[1:23:44] and you can say this is the word I'm a
[1:23:47] Believer now I might be the weakest of
[1:23:50] Christians but I know when I go on my
[1:23:52] knees I know that you're trembling so
[1:23:55] Satan give it back in the greatest
[1:23:58] battle ever fought brother Bram says see
[1:24:00] his attack watch listen close his attack
[1:24:03] is what disbelieving God's word that's
[1:24:07] his attack there can you see the
[1:24:09] greatest battle was ever fought there's
[1:24:11] only two forces that's Satan and that's
[1:24:15] God yes what is Satan's weapon against
[1:24:17] you is to try to get you to disbelieve
[1:24:20] your weapon he disarms you let's brother
[1:24:24] says let's real quiet down now listen if
[1:24:27] we can if if he can get you to
[1:24:29] disbelieve your weapon is equivalent if
[1:24:32] he gets you to believe that your weapon
[1:24:34] is not strong enough he has disarmed you
[1:24:38] Hallelujah right so brother brandom he
[1:24:40] says look he's disarmed you you when he
[1:24:44] gets you to disbelieve that weapon when
[1:24:45] you lay that down that finishes your
[1:24:48] fight you're done true so he's telling
[1:24:51] you hold that weapon don't you lay it
[1:24:54] down down Hallelujah are you willing to
[1:24:57] hold that weapon up now what is that
[1:24:59] weapon that weapon is a faith in the
[1:25:01] finished work of Calvary that weapon is
[1:25:04] I believe that God has sent me the
[1:25:07] seventh Church age messenger I believe
[1:25:09] that that word is the message to the
[1:25:11] final age do you believe that Hallelujah
[1:25:14] I believe that this Bible is true it's
[1:25:16] Vindicated Hallelujah you know if we
[1:25:18] didn't have a Bible we wouldn't know
[1:25:19] about a message those two go hand in
[1:25:22] hand you can't separate one from the
[1:25:23] other they dovetail from Genesis to
[1:25:26] Revelations Hallelujah but we believe
[1:25:29] that that is the word of God and and we
[1:25:33] know the Bible says heavens and earth
[1:25:34] shall pass away but my word shall dwell
[1:25:37] forever Hallelujah so now you could take
[1:25:39] something of Eternal value and we know
[1:25:42] that Satan isn't Eternal Hallelujah
[1:25:45] Satan is coming to a demise he's got a
[1:25:48] an appointment at the back of the book

[1:29:34] than what you've
[1:29:35] heard well what should you do you should
[1:29:38] go and you should study it out not just

[1:29:52] Jonah said today h I didn't understand
[1:29:54] how he was so but Lord maybe you're
[1:29:56] trying to tell me something I believe I
[1:29:59] prayed for the service I asked you to
[1:30:01] come and speak to me you ought to have
[1:30:02] done that and so Lord I'm expecting that
[1:30:05] you spoke today because that's what I
[1:30:07] prayed so there wasn't any false
[1:30:09] Doctrine ministered today because I
[1:30:11] prayed that there wouldn't
[1:30:13] be Hallelujah that's your job if
[1:30:17] something's going wrong at the pulpit
[1:30:18] it's because you haven't done your job
[1:30:20] out there amen you've got a great job to
[1:30:24] do Amen to keep the body
[1:30:27] clean amen what did Brother brandham say
[1:30:30] that the gifts were in the body for the
[1:30:32] speaking in tongues and all of that it
[1:30:35] was to keep the body clean now he never
[1:30:38] uh uh God never just you know put
[1:30:41] something on the shelf and we don't need
[1:30:42] that no more no God continues to add
[1:30:45] horsepower he continues to just make it
[1:30:48] a little better make it a little bit
[1:30:49] more powerful oh sure they go off in
[1:30:52] Pentecost and we know all about that but
[1:30:54] we're in the message we're the Bride of
[1:30:57] the lord we don't have to worry about
[1:30:58] that
[1:31:00] nonsense I hope amen
[1:31:04] amen
[1:31:05] amen bless the Lord I better get back on
[1:31:08] my notes I'll get in
[1:31:11] trouble I'm just an evangelist today so
[1:31:14] brother Sean can straighten it all up
[1:31:16] when I'm gone and the other pastors I
[1:31:19] feel so blessed to have these brothers
[1:31:21] here all the ministers and I'm Just a
[1:31:23] Nobody I I I'm really just a small
[1:31:25] little one amongst these Mighty Men God
[1:31:28] bless your Ministries and we're thankful
[1:31:30] for you all and the labor that you
[1:31:32] Brothers have labored uh rolling out the
[1:31:36] paving the road for me that I might be
[1:31:38] able to come Amen brother brandom and by
[1:31:41] faith Moses says what good is a God that
[1:31:45] could deliver from the fiery furnace the
[1:31:46] Hebrew children if he isn't the same God
[1:31:49] today what good is a God that would
[1:31:52] judge between right and wrong wrong in a
[1:31:54] day gone by and punish the wrong and
[1:31:57] bless the right if he isn't the same God
[1:31:59] today what do we go to church for why do
[1:32:03] we abstain from the things of the world
[1:32:05] if he isn't the same God of the same
[1:32:07] judgment and the same opinion that he
[1:32:09] always was what good would it be for a
[1:32:12] God who could touch a woman's hand with
[1:32:16] a raging fever and the fever stop if he
[1:32:18] isn't the same God today what good would
[1:32:21] it be to serve a god
[1:32:24] who could call his friend from the grave
[1:32:25] after being dead for our days if he
[1:32:28] isn't the same God today brother
[1:32:30] brandham he's getting to something here
[1:32:32] but by faith we believe that some
[1:32:34] glorious day he shall call us from the
[1:32:37] earth though we be a spoonful of Ashes
[1:32:41] again how do we prove it we do not prove
[1:32:45] it we believe it we're not asked to
[1:32:48] prove anything but we're asked to
[1:32:51] believe and we've got all this nonsense
[1:32:53] now people trying to out profit the
[1:32:55] prophet and disprove what we know to be
[1:32:57] real what we know to be true and they're
[1:32:59] looking for a proof we're not to prove
[1:33:02] anything the Bible says only believe
[1:33:06] what was it that Jesus says when I come
[1:33:08] back will I find faith on Earth he
[1:33:11] wasn't looking for some great psychology
[1:33:14] or or some magnificent Minister that
[1:33:16] could put it all together in just such a
[1:33:18] perfect way he was looking for simple
[1:33:22] Faith Hallelujah
[1:33:24] so that gives me hope because I can't do
[1:33:26] all those other things but I can only
[1:33:28] believe I can hold to the promise of God
[1:33:31] and I can say Lord I can't see how it'll
[1:33:34] be done but I know you promised it and
[1:33:36] if you promised it I know that you're
[1:33:39] the same yesterday today and forever in
[1:33:42] Isaiah 54:17 the Bible declares no
[1:33:44] weapon that is formed against thee shall
[1:33:46] prosper and every tongue that shall rise
[1:33:49] against thee in judgment Thou shalt
[1:33:52] condemn this is the heritage of the
[1:33:55] Servants of the Lord and their
[1:33:57] righteousness is of me saith the Lord so
[1:34:02] I'm not standing here on my own
[1:34:04] righteousness my righteousness is filthy
[1:34:06] rags but the Bible declares that I'm
[1:34:09] standing on the very righteousness of
[1:34:11] God and that's what's holding me that's
[1:34:14] what's going to take me from glory to
[1:34:15] Glory Hallelujah in Revelations 5:12 the
[1:34:19] Bible says sang with a loud voice Worthy
[1:34:21] is the Lamb that was slain to to receive
[1:34:24] power and riches and wisdom and strength
[1:34:27] and honor and glory and blessings and I
[1:34:30] believe Jesus Christ is worthy he's the
[1:34:32] only worthy one amongst us he deserves
[1:34:35] all of our praise Hallelujah he deserves
[1:34:39] everything I can give him if that means
[1:34:41] that I'm to vacuum this church I ought
[1:34:43] to do it with all my heart Hallelujah if
[1:34:46] that means that I I'm to pray and my job
[1:34:49] is to be a prayer Warrior I say be a
[1:34:52] real Warrior pray without ceasing just
[1:34:55] be constant in prayer fervent zealous
[1:34:59] your name maybe never gets called you
[1:35:01] maybe never come up for a special but
[1:35:04] you've got the greatest role out of any
[1:35:06] person to pray brother brandham says
[1:35:09] that that what is the uh uh uh how do I
[1:35:13] do so well in the meetings it's because
[1:35:15] there's those that are praying for me
[1:35:17] they're the ones that bring the victory
[1:35:19] Hallelujah Prayer Changes Things amen
[1:35:24] we ought to be praying more the Devil
[1:35:26] comes along and he makes us so busy and
[1:35:28] he distracts Us in so many ways he's got
[1:35:30] he he's a master at it he's been tring
[1:35:32] this for 6,000 years but I say greater
[1:35:35] is he that's within me I say prick your
[1:35:37] conscience stir up your minds and get
[1:35:39] back to a prayer life get back to having
[1:35:42] communion with God back to a a all night
[1:35:45] prayer meeting would be a good thing
[1:35:47] right now I'd say amen back to a a
[1:35:50] fellowship with the love divine not just
[1:35:52] to go to church on on Sunday and then go
[1:35:54] to the restaurant Sunday afternoon but a
[1:35:56] real fervent a desire to see God moving
[1:36:00] on the neighborhood a desire to see God
[1:36:02] moving on on our families that are maybe
[1:36:05] from without that we don't see often
[1:36:07] Hallelujah was it at isusa Street
[1:36:10] Revival where they prayed and it was how
[1:36:12] many six blocks out I believe it was
[1:36:14] that people would fall under the
[1:36:16] conviction of the Holy Spirit by prayer
[1:36:20] amen and lives be changed healings be
[1:36:22] happening there was no preaching it was
[1:36:25] prayer in those instances read the
[1:36:27] testimony of it sometime what an example
[1:36:31] we'll get back to David here we find
[1:36:33] David being called from his father's
[1:36:36] sheep I like that he was working and he
[1:36:39] went to uh uh to the castle and he
[1:36:42] delivered Saul from all of those spirits
[1:36:44] and then there be there there comes the
[1:36:45] battle David and Goliath you know all
[1:36:48] the boys like David and Goliath and I I
[1:36:50] think the girls like Esther or Hannah or
[1:36:53] something right right and we need to
[1:36:55] write a song only a girl named Esther I
[1:36:58] don't know anymore we have to write that
[1:37:00] brother
[1:37:02] Sean you know we got David with his
[1:37:04] sling and Esther but you know
[1:37:07] David left the castle and he went back
[1:37:11] right straight to his job you know he
[1:37:13] didn't just take a
[1:37:15] holiday he just left the palace and
[1:37:17] playing the harp and and and he was an
[1:37:19] example and then his dad called him to
[1:37:22] bring some cakes and uh and deliver
[1:37:24] those down to the captains and and some
[1:37:26] cheeses and whatnot and so he's bringing
[1:37:28] his cart down there and and so he comes
[1:37:31] up to the scene of the battle and
[1:37:34] excitement and all the armaments and the
[1:37:37] port cutlasses Pro no they didn't have
[1:37:39] those quite yet but they had swords and
[1:37:41] Spears and Shields and daggers and armor
[1:37:44] all over the place and uh and then there
[1:37:46] were some Cooks over there no doubt then
[1:37:48] they was doing the real work at this
[1:37:49] time these guys were all scared
[1:37:52] Hallelujah and it got real quiet and all
[1:37:55] of the work that happened at the
[1:37:58] battlefield everybody was
[1:38:02] listening there was a devil that had
[1:38:04] placed a spell of unbelief on God's Army
[1:38:07] and they had lost their faith because
[1:38:10] this Goliath was so tall and so strong
[1:38:12] and so well protected uh how possible
[1:38:17] could it be to kill such a mighty mighty
[1:38:20] Giant and they were scared all of Israel
[1:38:23] the whole host they didn't know how they
[1:38:26] could uh Break
[1:38:27] Free yeah the people of Israel knew
[1:38:31] where he was from they knew about his
[1:38:32] father and about his mommy and they'd
[1:38:35] done all their research on Google and
[1:38:37] they knew the doctors and the devils and
[1:38:39] they knew everything about him and they
[1:38:42] knew he'd never been conquered they were
[1:38:45] scared they knew the promise of God but
[1:38:49] it just seemed so
[1:38:51] impossible they they looked at the simp
[1:38:53] symptoms and the pain and the discomfort
[1:38:55] and they could hear this boast and the
[1:38:58] chain mail and the spear and my it was
[1:39:01] just overwhelming these
[1:39:04] Israelites but
[1:39:06] wait David
[1:39:08] heard and he didn't look at the problem
[1:39:12] his mind went straight to the
[1:39:14] promise who's this uncircumcised lying
[1:39:17] low down good for nothing devil who is
[1:39:20] this guy that would dare speak let Al
[1:39:23] show himself he wasn't cowed down by a
[1:39:27] uh this
[1:39:29] demon he he'd try to stop the move of
[1:39:31] God this devil attempt to take away
[1:39:34] peace and attack our worship and uh
[1:39:37] let's cast them out who's fighting with
[1:39:40] me David said well David was in for a
[1:39:43] surprise even uh Abner and uh and Saul
[1:39:47] and all of his brothers uh they kind of
[1:39:49] thought he was just some madeup stuffed
[1:39:51] shirt and well who do you think you are
[1:39:54] that you can come in here you're no
[1:39:56] match for this devil David said
[1:39:58] absolutely I am I'm anointed I'm a bride
[1:40:01] member I'm just going to March and go
[1:40:03] forward I'm not going to look right nor
[1:40:05] left I'm going to take them I'm taking
[1:40:07] my Mountain he's he's going to die today
[1:40:10] Hallelujah David's
[1:40:12] mind it moved away from all of that
[1:40:15] doubt and it went to the word you know
[1:40:18] his thought they would have went to
[1:40:19] those stories that he heard about Moses
[1:40:21] at the Red Sea and uh he remembered his
[1:40:24] mommy telling him about Joshua and the
[1:40:26] mighty walls and and of course he
[1:40:28] believed that Josh David was a believer
[1:40:30] in Hebrews 138 Hallelujah he didn't
[1:40:33] believe that it was a god of history but
[1:40:35] that God was alive still today
[1:40:37] Hallelujah God is here he'll deliver me
[1:40:40] it doesn't matter any alcohol Spirit any

[1:41:04] says if you shall ask anything in my
[1:41:06] name I will do it so Goliath just like

[1:41:13] time the wrong time his voice fell on
[1:41:16] the ears of a Believer amen hallelujah

[1:41:21] promises he knew God had promised I will
[1:41:25] be with you that was good for David amen

[1:48:42] name of the Lord Jesus I come yielding
[1:48:45] this sword of Faith claiming the Oneness
[1:48:47] of God in Man by the Holy Ghost through
[1:48:51] the mercies and sacrifice of Jesus Jesus
[1:48:53] Christ his son I defy every devil that's
[1:48:56] bound anybody in any way in this
[1:49:00] building whether he be boy or girl man
[1:49:03] or woman I defy every sickness I defy
[1:49:06] every doubt I defy every fear I defy
[1:49:10] everything that's
[1:49:11] ungodly leave this Auditorium in the
[1:49:14] name of Jesus Christ and come out of
[1:49:16] this
[1:49:17] audience that we can be one with God and
[1:49:21] can serve god without sickness or fear
[1:49:25] May the power that made us one with God
[1:49:28] how can that devil squawk himself around
[1:49:30] the anointed how can that devil stand
[1:49:33] out there and squawk himself like a
[1:49:35] Goliath when David come into the camp he
[1:49:37] said you mean you let that uncircumcised
[1:49:39] Philistine stand there and defy the
[1:49:41] armies of the Living God brother brandom
[1:49:44] saying oh God make men and women rise in
[1:49:46] the power of the spirit let that
[1:49:48] unconverted that dejected devil that's
[1:49:51] harmed the human race down Through the
[1:49:53] Ages stand here and defy the Church of
[1:49:55] the Living God Satan come out and leave
[1:50:00] in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[1:50:04] do you believe that I believe we're in
[1:50:06] the position of taking a Rapture I
[1:50:09] believe that we're just getting
[1:50:10] ourselves ready for the catching away
[1:50:13] and I really believe that God he's
[1:50:15] prolonged it because there's been some
[1:50:17] of us that have been slow he's been
[1:50:20] waiting on us just to get us into the
[1:50:22] right position position so that way we
[1:50:23] can take our body change you remember
[1:50:25] that testimony of that little lady that
[1:50:27] fell into the river and died and brother
[1:50:29] Brandon went prayed for her and she
[1:50:31] resurrected and then just a few months
[1:50:33] later she passed on what was go brother
[1:50:36] brandom question God remember that and
[1:50:39] and what did he say God came and told
[1:50:42] him she was supposed to go then but she
[1:50:44] wasn't right with me yet so I just
[1:50:47] needed to give her a little more time
[1:50:50] says that way she would be where I
[1:50:52] wanted to be Hallelujah isn't God so
[1:50:56] good you know he will not lose one every
[1:51:00] single bride member will come in they
[1:51:03] might be some of your children there
[1:51:04] might be some of them that are
[1:51:05] struggling it might be a an uncle it
[1:51:08] could be I don't know who they are I
[1:51:10] don't hardly know any of you but God
[1:51:12] knows exactly every single need and he's
[1:51:16] not finished yet he has a great plan
[1:51:19] that he is going to be projecting it's
[1:51:21] just getting right into that place where
[1:51:24] God is saying it's getting close and
[1:51:27] we're going to take that Rapture
[1:51:29] hallelujah amen then we don't have to
[1:51:32] worry about Democratic and Republican
[1:51:34] and we don't have to worry about the
[1:51:36] person down the road and what they said
[1:51:37] the other day we can just let it all go
[1:51:41] I I think we probably should just let it
[1:51:43] go now Hallelujah and just say let God
[1:51:47] have his way you know offenses are such
[1:51:50] a terrible thing because they bind
[1:51:54] people when they ought not to be bound
[1:51:57] and you know the best way there's not a
[1:51:58] one of us that has not been offended so
[1:52:01] you're not alone maybe you feel like it
[1:52:04] was worse for you but it
[1:52:06] wasn't no it was hard for everybody and
[1:52:10] you know as long as you stay in that
[1:52:12] offended State you're paralyzed your
[1:52:15] sword has been put down so I say become
[1:52:21] unoffended release it just forgive them
[1:52:25] my my daddy he preached a sermon on Let
[1:52:28] It
[1:52:29] Go Do you know how much power there is
[1:52:33] in letting something go did you know if
[1:52:35] you never owned a skid steer you'd never
[1:52:37] have to change oil in
[1:52:40] it yeah it's that simple yeah that's
[1:52:44] them tractors with the bucket on the
[1:52:45] front you know if you never owned a
[1:52:48] truck you never had to fuel it up and if
[1:52:51] you don't get an fence you don't have to
[1:52:54] fuel that fire you can just let it die
[1:52:57] right out and continue on in the
[1:53:00] freeness peace you'll love everybody it
[1:53:03] makes me love everybody Hallelujah that
[1:53:06] oldtime religion you ought not to have
[1:53:08] any sticky nature what did Brother
[1:53:10] brandham say that's a lack of rain it
[1:53:12] happens to Cactus just let that Holy
[1:53:14] Spirit rain down and where's that going
[1:53:16] to happen in your prayer life on if you
[1:53:19] feel like you're getting cold or maybe
[1:53:20] you're just
[1:53:23] I don't want to be this way
[1:53:25] pray true pray and what did Brother
[1:53:28] brandom say you get down on your knees
[1:53:30] and that person that was you know
[1:53:32] contempt you'll get in their shoes and
[1:53:35] you'll say oh Lord I never knew it was
[1:53:37] like that for them brother brandham said
[1:53:39] no man in that presence could
[1:53:42] ever didn't use the word criticize but
[1:53:45] could never criticize another Hallelujah
[1:53:48] that's where I want to be is in his
[1:53:51] presence amen amen
[1:53:54] amen well aren't you grateful for his
[1:53:58] Mercy
[1:54:01] amen bless the Lord I told God to just
[1:54:04] move me
[1:54:05] wherever and uh that's what we want him
[1:54:07] to
[1:54:09] do amen why don't the musicians come and
[1:54:13] do we know that song in his
[1:54:16] presence Let's uh sing that song if we
[1:54:19] could and as they're preparing
[1:54:21] themselves and playing that softly if
[1:54:23] you would just close your eyes and why
[1:54:26] don't
[1:54:27] you why don't you
[1:54:29] pray and as that presence would come and
[1:54:32] sway by you just as David played on the
[1:54:34] harp you know that story had ended David
[1:54:37] killed his
[1:54:38] Goliath he didn't have any struggle with
[1:54:40] it at all and I believe whatever trouble
[1:54:43] is in your
[1:54:44] life whatever problem is besetting you I
[1:54:49] believe that that could be the same as
[1:54:51] Goliath right right now if you'll just
[1:54:54] reach out to God in
[1:54:56] faith and if you'll say Lord
[1:54:58] Jesus I'm depending on you I've fought
[1:55:02] as hard as I could I've done all I
[1:55:04] humanly know how to do but
[1:55:06] Jesus I know I'm not enough but I'm
[1:55:08] looking to you the one who holds
[1:55:12] tomorrow and I know that they're the
[1:55:14] best hands that I could ever place this
[1:55:16] trouble
[1:55:18] in I've been sick I've been very sick
[1:55:22] and nearly lost my life due to a a
[1:55:25] situation and but God healed
[1:55:28] [Music]
[1:55:30] me cuz he wasn't done with me yet so I
[1:55:34] stand here today knowing god as a Healer
[1:55:37] you know I ran from God when I was a boy
[1:55:40] but my mommy and my daddy they
[1:55:42] prayed and I know God as a
[1:55:46] savior Mercy came running after me
[1:55:52] I've been depressed
[1:55:54] before but God came and he took that
[1:55:56] away and he gave me peace and joy in the
[1:56:00] trial he's the same
[1:56:03] God he's not dead he hasn't lost power
[1:56:08] the devil isn't too much it seems like
[1:56:10] it sometimes that flood is
[1:56:13] rising but God raised up a standard that
[1:56:15] would be greater than anything the devil
[1:56:17] ever could give and that standard is
[1:56:20] living in your heart
[1:56:23] it's a standard of Hope to the Hopeless
[1:56:26] rest for the weary you have something
[1:56:29] that the world knows nothing
[1:56:32] about I say we ought to praise him we
[1:56:36] ought to give him our whole
[1:56:38] heart and say Lord Jesus I'm sorry for
[1:56:41] holding back I'm sorry for the times
[1:56:45] that I've been critical I'm sorry for
[1:56:47] those thoughts I'm stuck in this flesh
[1:56:50] Tabernacle but thank you for the blood
[1:56:52] blood that brought me forgiveness and
[1:56:54] Lord I want to drill down on the devil

[1:57:05] me and Lord I will do all that I can I I
[1:57:09] maybe feel
