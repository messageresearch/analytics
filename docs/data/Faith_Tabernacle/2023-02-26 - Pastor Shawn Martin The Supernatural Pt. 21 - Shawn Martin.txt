your heart's desire [Music] and he alone we yield ourselves to a man and let's say to me that's a paradox in this age something that is a miracle that a people that um can yield themselves to the Lord holy amen but I'm glad that there are people on Earth that can do that and is doing it and glad to be a part of that amen well it's really good to see everyone in the house of the Lord and I think it's been a little while since we've all been together with the sickness and different things but um sure good that everyone is feeling better and getting all this sickness behind us and maybe there's some that are still sick and we want to keep them in our prayer but um um you know we uh we're we're marching on that's for sure and ain't gonna let the devil get us down amen the musicians can be dismissed it's it's good to have Stephen Josh with us amen and God bless you all and always just an honor to have you with us and I I do if you want to turn to the book of Ephesians the first chapter I want to just say that we're gonna we're planning a work day here at the church on March the 25th so be I believe uh it'd be the last weekend last Saturday of March so March 25th and so uh any of you that would be free to come and would want to come it would really be appreciated we're going to do some work around the church and it has been brought to my attention uh by a couple that or a few that uh be nice to have a good spring cleaning here in the church as well and so a few sisters um you know you got free time and you'd like to come and and be a part of that just to give the church an overhaul here in inside just clean uh that that would really be appreciated as well it's been a while since we've just had a good work day amen and uh so um we're planning on that so just Mark that on your calendar if you don't mind uh March 25th uh the last Saturday of March and uh we'll have a good time I'm sure a fellowship right amen but um also our spring meetings coming up there in April the 26th through the 30th and that is coming around real soon and uh we'll be setting up the 10th April 7th the Lord willing to be on a Friday uh and so any of you brothers that would be able to come we would appreciate the help um this is we got our tent and so you know we we don't know the uh you know hadn't set up something that that size before and so uh so it's going to be interesting and uh sure want to be there to to to watch and uh put your little effort into it there and and I'm sure it'll be fun uh but before we do set it up uh when it gets closer time we're going to they've got a video uh that uh the the gentleman said we could watch that would show us how to uh you know give us a little bit more insight on how to set it up and what's required and so um here in a couple weeks we'll play that downstairs for you Brethren and those that would be interested and maybe you know we can put it all up in a perfect way uh and he wants pictures of it too so he said if that tin is sagging it's your fault not mine well that really puts pressure on us huh and uh so anyways but we're really excited about it and and looking forward to what God has in store amen but the uh the book of Ephesians the first chapter and before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to the author of the word father as we come your children whom you have redeemed Lord you've expressed your love to us father and you've done that work of redemption and you've kept us all through our lives Lord even when we didn't even know it was you Lord and Father Here we are now a work of your hands and we're here to express our love back to you just to tell you thank you and how we love you and we make so many mistakes in this human body Lord we fight so many things Lord but down in our heart there's always something that has stabilized this Lord or something has drawn us even to this day today to come and worship it wasn't buyer wheel power it was it was a divine order of God we just say thank you and Lord we just asking that you would move Among Us this morning father if you've called us together then you've got an eternal purpose for it and Lord now that we yield ourselves to you we pray that you would use the Mortal lips Lord here and help me to get myself out of the way and God pray that you had helped the people just to get themselves out of the way and anoint their ears and hearts to hear and receive we ask these things in your gracious name Jesus Christ and the church says amen Ephesians the first chapter in the 22nd verse says then hath put all things under his feet and of course speaking of Christ and gave him Christ to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all a man you can have your seats this morning praise the Lord I want to just continue along the lines we've been talking about and and I believe that the the body of Christ is the most powerful thing on Earth today it is made up of people all around the world and it's a universal body and I thank the Lord that the blood has a way and it's so powerful that it could reach all kinds of humanity and John actually sees this there in the Book of Revelations he saw a great multitude which no man could number of all nations of All Peoples tongues kindreds amen and this is the body of Christ and this is the Fulfillment of the prophecy that God said to Abraham in Genesis 17 and 4. where God says as for me behold my Covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations and later on or in another place God tells Abraham I will make thy seed as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for multitude and so here John in being caught up and he sees this he said I see this people there which no man can number from All Nations tongues kindreds peoples and so uh you see for Abraham to be a father he had to have a seed and God said that he would have a seed and that every promise of God that He gave Abraham he would give it to his seed as well it'd be to Abraham and his seed and so just to read some scriptures Genesis 13 and 14 and the Lord said to Abram after that lot was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art North northward Southward Eastward and Westward for all the land which thou seeest to thee will I give it and to thy seed forever and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered occur arise walk through the land in the length of it and in the breath of it for I will give it unto thee Genesis 17 7 and I will establish my Covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an Everlasting Covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee and I will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger all the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession and I will be their God and God said unto Abram Abraham Thou shalt keep my Covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee in their generations and this is my Covenant which you shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised and then Genesis 22 and 16 by myself I have sworn saith the Lord for because thou has done this thing and has not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing I'll bless thee and in multiplying all multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou Hast obeyed my voice so we we understand that the seed it it's it the promises belong to Abraham and his seed after him which seed is The Offspring and so in the natural we we talked about it last Sunday but in the natural Abraham had uh uh several children he had the Ishmael he had Isaac and then he had several after Isaac and and yet there was only one uh uh that God would establish his Covenant with and that was with Isaac and and here in Genesis 17 19 and God said Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name Isaac and I will establish uh with my Covenant with him for an Everlasting Covenant and with his seed after him amen so so Isaac was the Seed of Abraham potentially but he wasn't the real Seed of Abraham in what God was speaking of uh uh we find that Isaac was the natural seed that God had established his Covenant with and and brother Brown said see not in the rest of the Jews but in Isaac in Isaac and that that that that that matters now not not in all Seed of Abraham but in Isaac would would God establish a covenant with uh and in Romans 9 and 7 it says neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children see uh uh but in Isaac everybody's saying Isaac shall thy seed be called not not in all the children of Abraham but in Isaac shalt and thy seed be called and so it was through Isaac that Christ uh came uh which was the true Seed of Abraham amen that that's right see and so I uh Christ uh he was the royal Seed of Abraham he was the the supernatural seed of of Abraham but but just looking at the natural for a moment we even see predestination uh in the natural seed that God established his Covenant with uh for example Jacob and Esau uh they were the Dirac sons of Jacob so they were the direct descendants of Jacob they were uh twins of the natural seed ain't that right but then we read there in Romans 9 and 11 the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that clawless it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated so if you notice Esau had the birthright for he was the firstborn the Bible tells us that there was actually between the two babies the two boys were wrestling in the mother's womb and and Esau came out of the womb first and Jacob was holding on to Esau's Hill and and he come out of the womb as well and so uh uh but the the firstborn had the birthright ain't that right and so the word Birthright I just looked it up and we could go more into that but I won't today but it's it's a right a Birthright is a right a privilege or possession to which a person is entitled by birth so the birthright always laid to the firstborn uh son the firstborn son and and so the eldest child received the inheritance now the others may have had a blessing but the inheritance belonged to that first child uh the first son and so the wrestling that was going on uh uh continued it was it went in the womb but it also continued outside the womb Jacob wanted that Birthright now he knew he couldn't get the birthright because he wasn't the eldest but he still wanted it and and now as the prophet tells us that that is the type well here it is brother Brown said it's the spiritual man today and spiritual woman that's elected predestinated of God to come to eternal life if they have to sell everything they got if they have to take their name off of every Church book in the nation they still want that Birthright see it's the only thing that matters to them I I I I I I I I I I think that's the way it is here this morning uh uh is is that's all that matters is the birthright it's the only thing that matters to them just get that Birthright that's all no matter how and what level they have to come on if they have to get down at the altar and cry and boo hoo if they have to run through the places and go back and make things right and sell what they've got or give away everything they have and become a pilgrim and a stranger it doesn't matter they want the birthright that's all they're interested in is the birthright and he says now don't blame them people you can't blame Jacob you you can't blame the people of today they cannot help it they were predestinated to that they were elected to it ain't that right so so now Jacob represents uh uh you and I today that really wants the birthright we you know what you you just we can't be happy with anything else amen we find that there's no Greater Joy than to walk with God we find that there's no Greater Joy than to know our savior we find that there's no other Joy than to to have the Seal of the Holy Ghost Upon Our Lives we find that there's no other Joy than to have the approval of God upon us can you say amen amen because that's all we were born for that's what we were predestinated for it's funny how we'll give up uh certain jobs and and good money just so we can be at church and and we'll give up things of the world so we can just have uh uh peace with God and and know that we're walking according to God's ways ain't that right amen and and the world don't understand that but you can't blame us because that's what we were predestinated for amen I've thought of many times brother Bram said I'd rather live under a bridge eating soda crackers or crackers and soda drinking soda water or Branch water or whatever than to have all of this other stuff in the world and know that I'm walking with God Amen well I believe that's every in elect of God because that's what we were predestinated for take my house take my cards take my take my money take whatever as long as I'm walking with God that's all that matters amen well now this is what Jacob he wanted that Birthright and he got it now now now not so not only did Jacob represent us a man by wanting the birthright but he also represented Us in that he got it and so will this bride get it the birthright belongs to you and you'll stop at nothing to get it you're going to go through your trials you're going to go through your headaches you're going to go through your your uh turmoils and you'll watch friends go you'll watch family go you'll watch everybody else go amen because they're interested in everything else amen but the birthright is what we want and we'll get it it's just that way Jacob got it and so will this bride and so and this bride's got it amen so we find he got it and and notice how I got it now Genesis 25 and 29 and Jacob Assad pottage and and what that was is he boiled some vegetables there uh or or it could have been mixed with meat and and and and things like that and made a soup and and so well then it says and Esau came from the field and he was faint he was starving I'd I don't know you know he was a hunter so you think he would have shot him a deer or something but uh uh to eat but but when he met Jacob he was starving and to the point he thought he was going to die you know if I miss a meal sometimes I think I'm gonna die too but I don't know how far he had to have gone uh uh you know five days a month I don't know it could have been an hour but anyway and Esau said to Jacob feed me I pray thee with that same red pottage for I am Thane therefore was his name called the Edom and notice how Jacob he's a he's a smart dude he's a conniver you we all know about Jacob but one thing he won that Birthright right so he didn't care what he was going to do he didn't care how he got it he just wanted the birthright so here's Jacob now he's just been a little tough on Esau and he says I tell you what I'll give you some if you give me your Birthright that's what I want sell me your Birthright right now you know Jacob I mean good night Esau was the Hunter he would have said well skip you I'll just go ask Mom for something he must have been you know miles away from home I don't know but uh uh but anyways he said Jacob said sell me this day thy Birthright and Esau noticed the attitude notice what he says he says behold I'm at the point to die what prophet good Lord what prophet shall this Birthright do to me now do you realize that Jacob or Esau having that Birthright it on only went to him it went to his family it went to his children what a selfish individual my opinion and Jacob said swear to me this day and he swear unto him and sowed his Birthright unto Jacob so then you notice now Isaac has no idea the father has no idea what just happened now Jacob comes for the birthright to get a blessing and his mom's in on this now right and she looked the Bible says that Isaac loved Esau Rebecca loved Jacob so Jacob was a mama's boy and so Rebecca got in on this to deceive Isaac so she told Jacob what to do you know because he saw was hairy he had a lot of hair so they went and killed some uh whatever they killed and put skin on Jacob's arms and whatever so he'd be Harry he saw must have really been hairy but this was the case and so we find that when Jacob appeared he says to eat Isaac he says I'm I'm Esau lying right there I'm Esau but he don't care he wants that Birthright that's all he wants so I'm I'm Esau and I want I've come for my blessing and Jacob you know Esau was well come here you know and let me feel you because he's blind Isaac is blind so he's fiddling around and he's rubbing all that hair you know and he says well he says this is you're the voice of Jacob but man that's the that's the arms of Esau you know so he's a little confused but but regardless he he took it as Esau right so here's the blessing Genesis 27 and 28 therefore God give thee God give thee of the Dew of Heaven and the fatness of the earth and plenty corn of corn and wine let people serve thee and Nations bowed down to thee be Lord over thy Brethren what a Birthright and let thy mother Sons bow down to thee curse be everyone that curseth thee and blessed be he that blesseth thee do you know that still stands today for the natural Seed of Abraham now Jacob's name actually went in from Jacob a conniver to Israel a prince with God and so that's why the Jews are called Israel is after their father Abraham and that still stands today that those that bless Israel will be blessed now that's just a natural Covenant that's just enough but see that belonged to Esau that belonged to Esau and he despised it good grief you know what he's Charles children became thieves and robbers that's the effect that Esau had on his family by turning this thing down he thought that he was going to die so what is it going to do me didn't even think about his children didn't even think about the grandchildren he didn't even think about his future gender the generations after him but thank God there's a Jacob and said if you ain't wanting it I'll take it I want it and because he he was able to stay for that Birthright and obtain that Birthright his seat after him was blessed I think that's pretty powerful did you know the prophet said nothing Supernatural happened in Esau's life nothing even though he was religious yet nothing happened in eso's life he didn't have a Birthright gave it up and God says I hate him for it but how many people give up their Birthright today that they'll take a better job they'll they they want better retirement they want every and they disregard the Supernatural and the spiritual part of of their lives and don't realize it'll affect their families down the road you may not have much in life but you stay with God ain't that right because it'll be a blessing to your children it'll be a blessing to your Offspring down the road sure will you say well I mean my children's gone Haywire it does not matter you walk with God you have to write over that devil you have right over sin you have more Authority amen over yours your your Offspring than the devil does and you say man amen now so so we we find that that Esau rejected the birthright and in Hebrews 11 and 8 Paul uh in speaking of Abraham said by faith he's sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise it was Jacob that's mentioned as the heir of the same promise not Esau ain't that right heir of the same promise and Esau is not even mentioned as being an heir of the same promise can you say man so this tells us that in Isaac the seed was not secure Esau come out of Isaac but he was not secure see only in Christ everybody say only in Christ The Royal seed are we secure um and you say man amen Isaac couldn't help what he's all done and yet coming out of that natural lineage God says I hate him ain't that right coming out of a natural lineage of Isaac that it showed that Isaac was not the real seed that God was talking about he was speaking of Christ can you say Amen we find out that of the two and a half million people that left Egypt they all died in the wilderness except for two Joshua and Caleb ain't that right and and yet they were they were Israelites amen they come out of Egypt they they they they they were walking to the promised land and and and yet the the uh uh Jesus said about the rest of all of them that come out says they're everyone dead ain't that right and we know what dead death represents it it represents separation and and brother Rams said see there they are eternally dead eternally separated ain't that right yet they a lot of them come out of the lineage of Isaac and yet only two made it of the original made it into the Promised Land ain't ain't that right yes sir see and and so be it they're eternally dead amen so the promise wasn't guaranteed in Isaac's ability to bring forth seed ain't that right you see it's never been in the natural as to what man can do God has never looked at the natural ability God don't care what you can produce God don't care what you can sum up God don't care about your ability God don't care about your willpower God don't care about your talents can you say Amen what talents can you give Amen to to bring to God Amen that would Elevate you up closer to him what is there anything to do with you a man that you can present to God that would cause him to love you even more can you say man so it's never been in the natural Amen brother Brown said the natural Siege failed because it accepted the law instead of the word of Grace aren't you glad for Grace we'll stay with Grace same ain't that right but they failed that natural seed failed amen because they accepted the law over the word of Grace a man see and and again the prophet says the promise was not only made to Abraham but he is seed not his seed Isaac for it failed and proved it did can you say man look at what happened when the net what what did the natural seed do when Christ The Royal Seed of Abraham came to the Earth They Crucified him the natural seed can you say man but yet the the natural seed boasted to Jesus they they boasted about being the Seed of Abraham and notice Jesus has replied to them in in John 8 35 says I know that you are Abraham's seed but you seek to kill me because my word my Covenant has no place in you ain't that right it has no place in you and in 40 the 44th verse he says you are of your father the devil and the lust of your father you will do ain't that right amen see and and so it showed amen that that that there was a a greater significance amen uh uh than just being I succeed amen see they they were part of the seed amen but Jesus identified their father as of the devil amen and we've got a greater father amen than Isaac was we've got a greater father amen that's right so Israel the the Jewish people are the natural seed of Isaac or natural Seed of Abraham and brother Brandon says in Israel in Isaac Israel in Isaac failed keep that in mind Israel in Isaac failed and denied the genuine seed when it come on ain't that right and so their works showed that they were really the children of the devil amen see you think of it now also just speaking in in the natural sense um uh uh in the Old Testament God uh told David that he would give him a son amen and and that he would not uh uh he would never leave him without a a seed and that that his son the son of David was to sit on the throne ain't that right and his and David's Throne would be established forever amen that's right see but but and it looked to be like it was Solomon it looked like Solomon was the promised one but we found out that Solomon wasn't the promised one it was actually Christ Christ was the true son of David ain't that right see the natural seed of David was Solomon and he looked to be the seed but the prophet said he backslid just like the Seed of Abraham did see so so when Christ was there he told them a greater than Solomon is here before you ain't that right he was there proven a greater than Solomon Christ was that greater than Solomon and he was proven to them that he was the real seed of David ain't that right so Not only was he the genuine Seed of Abraham he was the genuine seed of David that had the promise yes sir it's all in Christ he's the heir ain't that right amen so so Isaac was the Lesser son the prophet said of Abraham and so was Solomon the Lesser son of David amen see uh uh but God has never looked at the natural man is the one that looks at the natural oh God help us to get our eyes off the natural amen you can't find fulfillment in the natural amen and and even if it you say well I've got a good job I've got good pay I've got I've my family's done good don't you look at the natural and then because he can change in a moment you might be saying well all hell is broken loose and and and and and and and and and just just I I'm so devastated I don't know what to do I don't know how to uh which way to turn which way to go which way to look don't you look at the natural amen God never looked at the natural he never looked at inability and he never looked at the abilities he looked at his word can you say Amen yes sir he always looks to his word amen you can't save yourself you can't help yourself and I've just met it this way you can't get God to hate you and you can't get God to love you more it's all within himself then you say Amen if he ever loved you he's always loved you and there ain't nothing that you can do to deter that you know why he loves you because you're all the faults and all the failure you still want to Birthright you steal one God that's right didn't want my children the other day I don't care I don't care what it takes even if I go to hell I don't want this world I don't want nothing God never answers another prayer it don't matter to me I just want him I'm happy where I'm at I'm happy to know him I'm happy to know this message and I want to know it more can you say man so God it's man that looks at the natural but you know the natural is nothing but a product of man's labors man builds an altar man builds a denomination man establishes Creeds and dogmas man is the one that erects the temples and and Tabernacles and and and man comes to the place that he's really thinks he's a chief something is that right but if you notice when God ever used the natural it was always he used it to foretell of something greater when God uses the natural he always used testifies of something greater to come ain't that right yes sir so we we find that that's what happened God had them to build a natural altar but it testified of the greater altar to come he had them to build a natural Mercy Seat but it only testified of a greater mercy seat that was to come God had them to kill a natural lamb in the Old Testament but it only testified of a greater lamb to come can you say man God bless the natural seed but in that natural seed while blessing them it only testified of the greater seed to come amen they they the natural seed conquered amen but it only showed and testified of a greater conqueror to come of a greater people that would conquer greater things amen than them can you say amen amen that's right and I say to you a greater than that natural seed is here today a greater than Solomon a greater than Abraham now greater than David a greater amen than Ruth is here today a greater than Esther is here today the natural when God uses the natural it always brings them testifying of something to come can you say Amen now amen God told Moses to erect a natural Tabernacle amen but there was a Greater Tabernacle Hallelujah and Moses saw that Tabernacle so every time as I said Wednesday night every time he showed up at that natural Tabernacle he was thinking of a Heavenly Tabernacle amen why man can't get past the natural there are a people that could look past that natural and see the real I believe they saw a real bride to come God used a natural Boaz to tell us that there's a a real Boaz and church were not tied to a natural Boaz we are tied to the real greater than Boaz oh remember God had Abraham to kill a sacrifice and to cut it in half and he took he took these three animals the Bible speaks of and he cut them apart and he laid them piece by piece and we all know the story when they made a covenant they would take it and take an animal and they would kill it and then they would cut it in half in the Old Testament and then the two that was making that Covenant they would stand between that dead animal and they would make their agreement and then then they'd say let our body be as this dead sacrifice if we don't fulfill our end of the bargain the two had to come together if you read where God made that Covenant with Abraham he put Abraham to sleep and the Bible says that pillar fire walked between both of them both the sacrifice showing that he was not only going to fulfill his part but he was going to fulfill our part how more guaranteed can the Covenant be to you and I God's the one that promised he will fulfill it Abraham you have nothing to do with it your seed has nothing to do with it I'll tell you what Abraham I've already done it it's already been done you were chosen before the foundation of the world I elected you I called you you are already not just Justified you're glorified you've already got it at the office do you realize you already got a theophany waiting on you on the other side when the prophet went across the the the the curtain of time he said I saw every one of you there I don't believe he was just talking about that group of people there I believe he was talking about the Seed of Abraham and I just had just happened to believe I was part of that amen I can't explain everything I I don't understand everything but all I know is I am there I was there my theophany is calling me how can it be it's a finished work ain't that right but notice Abraham had cut he had cut them sacrifices now he was waiting for the next the next um uh commission if you want to say so God told him do that cut the sacrifices so he cut it he laid it out there and he waited and he waited and he waited and while he was waiting the buzzards were flying around and he would come tried to land on that sacrifice and Abraham would be over there shooing them off showing them off well it took a profit to get that spiritual significance of that amen he shoot him off and brother Brahm said it was a type everybody say it was a type of Abraham's seed not in in the Old Testament not in the new in the New Testament so to speak in the Bible days amen but in this last day natural Abraham doing a natural action shoeing the natural birds off was only testifying of a greater people to come and it would testify of his seed in the last day casting out Devils from the sacrifice casting them from away from the sacrifice can you say Amen so Abraham was not typing out his natural seed for his natural seed failed they failed to keep unbelief off of the word amen and when the pure word came in to them the real son of man they crucified him with their unbelief the buzzards of unbelief amen possessed them and they kept they didn't keep it away like their father Abraham did can you say Amen but he wasn't typing out that natural seed they accept the law overground over Grace over the word of Grace ain't that right and so is it that Abraham was not typing the natural Church of today because they're doing the same thing that the natural Seed of Abraham did they're letting all the buzzards of unbelief come upon the word to where they preached nothing but die a dogmas and Creed they've taken the supernatural out of the Bible amen they don't even believe in anything anymore so he wasn't typing out the natural seed he wasn't typing the natural church so natural If Abraham was typing out the rule seed of today a man who is standing true brother Brown said casting out Devils doing great signs and wonders getting all the unbelief from the word of God keeping the sacrifice clean keeping the word holy keeping it reverence not putting anything with it and adding anything to it just keeping it away standing on guard letting nothing touch it so natural Abraham by doing that was typing you and die today of keeping that word clean keep it all unbelief out can you say Amen Hallelujah that's right so the natural lamb was just a substitutionary until Christ came the natural altar was substitutionary till Christ came the high priest was substitutionary till Christ came Isaac brother Brown said Bing after the flesh was only substitutionary until Christ came Solomon being after the flesh it was only super uh uh substitutionary until Christ came ain't that right amen I hope this is okay Galatians 3 16 now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made oh my but we're not looking at it now as well God bless Israel God bless Israel we we're just going to try to make it God bless Israel no no look what Paul says and to see and he saith not to seeds as of many but as of one everybody say one which is Christ and divine seed which is Christ see the the natural seed Isaac the natural man Isaac yes he had a blessing and yes in in his lineage come Jacob and David and and and uh Moses and and whoever else down to that lineage and look what God done through them in a supernatural way amen but they were only testifying of what this seed would do of what you would do so you could look back no wonder brother random kept using these testimonies of the Hebrew boys and and Daniel and the Lion's Den he constantly referred to the the stories of the Old Testament amen that you could identify that if they could do it you're the greater it was only a testimony if God could spare and save and rescue and redeem a natural seed he can save you as well to thy seed so Christ was the spiritual seed that the promise was made through and he come through Abraham's Faith the faith of Abraham and the lineage of people would come through that seed think of your lineage a lineage of people would come to that seed roll seed which would make Abraham a father of Nations amen and it's that lineage of people that make up the body of Jesus Christ amen in this Gentile dispensation that's what is making up the body of Christ now Christ was the spiritual seed that would be the son of David that would establish David's Throne forever God establishes David's Throne by the son of David which is Jesus Christ and if I can say it this way you're part of that royalty not by being the natural seed Solomon's Dead and Gone he did not establish David's Throne forever so I'm glad I'm not part of that lineage but I am part of a lineage of a real seed which is the son of David and I will reign with him you're going to reign with him and not not only will you you are now how else could you defeat the devils how else could you defeat sin how else could you conquer it's through the ruling you're ruling over this body Christ is the seed of the woman that brews the Serpent's head Christ is the Seed of Abraham that possessed the Gate of his enemy and Christ is the seed of David that is to Reign on the throne but if you notice he was not a product of Abraham's labors he was not in according to the flesh he was not a product of David's labors after the flesh for he was not born after the flesh brother Brown said he was not born by natural birth but was born by a supernatural birth can you say man how how did this Supernatural seed come about through a supernatural birth yes Sarah see so and and that happened by the supernatural faith of Abraham Abraham believed Jacob believed David believed and you see Christ in David you see Christ in Abraham you see Christ in Isaac you see Christ all the way down through the linear until he became a a a a a human being the fullness of Christ the fullness of God in human flesh can you say Amen now we know brother Brown says faith is Supernatural everybody say faith is Supernatural faith is Supernatural and it does Supernatural things just think of that now the faith of Abraham produced Christ the supernatural faith of Abraham produced a supernatural God made flesh and you say man Romans 4 13 for the promise that he should be heir of the world was not to Abraham or to a seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith so the faith of Abraham produced Jesus Christ now notice his faith Abraham Paul says who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations all the tests that Abraham went through that the trials that Abraham went through but his faith stood and against all hope he believed in Hope do you see what your faith is doing and what he's going to produce you say well I ain't got nothing I've talked to my loved ones and and I might my daughter or my son my husband my wife and and I ain't get nowhere amen then don't depend upon your natural abilities your faith your faith can you say Amen it'll produce the supernatural every time now notice the faith Seed of Abraham that he believed God's word everybody say believe God's word regardless of what the circumstances was now I just gonna be honest now as I've been studying this my faith has been tried and and and you know this morning I just I just told the Lord Lord help my faith I helped my faith to be strong if there's anything else amen I I'm not asking for much of anything of you I just want my faith to be right can you say Amen foresee he believed God's word regardless of what the circumstances was there you are who he says see you know I feel like shouting look see look the faith Seed of Abraham what was it not Abraham's body but Abraham's faith your faith will produce the supernatural your faith will bring Christ upon the scene Abraham's faith in what the word of God no matter what come he called anything contrary to it as though it wasn't there his body was weak and it got weaker but he never considered it so Sarah's womb was dead and it was more dead than it ever had been before but he had never considered it he looked at the promise and considered God's faithful that gave the promise and you realize it's in Christ that all the promises are sure the promises in Christ are sure to all you believe that yes sir notice second Corinthians 1 20 for all the promises of God everybody say all the promises of God in him are yea and in him amen unto the glory of God by us ain't that right all the promises not some promises but all the promises of God are are in him yea and in him amen in Christ ain't that right now notice now because this to me has something special amen Ephesians 1 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Isaac in Christ according as he hath chosen us in him who Christ before the foundation of the world not Isaac we were not chosen in Isaac we were chosen in Christ we were not predestinated to be part of that natural lineage we were predestinated to be part of the supernatural lineage and every blessing is is ours he has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Christ that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by who Isaac Jesus Christ oh my so not by Isaac the natural but by Jesus Christ the supernatural the Royal seed now the Bible tells us that there's going to be a bride without spot wrinkle or blemish that promise could not be guaranteed in Isaac the promise of the manifestation of sons of God for this last day could not be guaranteed in Isaac the promise that Jesus gave the works that I do shall you do and greater than Works than these shall you do could not be guaranteed in Isaac is that right only in Christ now God told Abraham that his seed Bill Brown said would be coming from the dust of the Earth to the Stars in heaven he said see we humbly bow our heads down our thoughts and our thoughts and we looked at where we came from from the dust of the earth of sand and then we look up to heaven and see where we're going to be what we're going to be and what we are where we're going it's it's to be the shining stars in the heavens can you say man yes sir see see Genesis 22 17 Again breaking in in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore oh my look look at the the the the the when Rebecca got on the camel to go meet Isaac watch what listen to what her family says to her Genesis 24 60. I'll break it in and they blessed they blessed Rebecca and said unto her Thou Art our sister be thou the mother of thousands of Millions brother Brown said you know what that was that's bringing in the Gentiles they didn't even know what they were prophesying sister Martha but they were prophesying of us be thou the mother of Millions and let thy seed possess the Gate of those which hate them can you say amen and I'm going to be honest with you as long as there is a Seed of Abraham remaining there is going to be a people that is possessed in the gate of their enemy I understand we're living in a dark evil age and it's Satan is running running rampant around destroying homes destroying people's minds destroying Nations amen he's having his Heyday but there's one people that he is limited to and that is the Seed of Abraham for they will possess him and not him possessing them let the trouble come but we are the possessor Amen Let the depression come but we are the possessor let the sickness and Jesus diseases come but we are the possessor when it comes to the bride of Christ when it comes to that rule Seed of Abraham Satan is limited you realize the blessings are still even with natural seed we've been watching a series of documentary in the evening times well a couple nights we have about Israel and talking about the last day or The Six Day War and talking about all kinds of wars and the man that is in doing the interview he he tells at the beginning of this series I'm not a believer I don't believe in miracles and he gives his explanation as to why he don't believe in it and all that he said after talking to these people I've come to realize that there has to be something different more than this human coincidences or whatever just paraphrasing and so here is a natural seed and do you realize one man a Jew said most Israel are secular don't even believe in God do you realize Israel the Bible actually calls Jerusalem what the city of homosexuals or uh Egypt and Sodom they are the homosexual capital of the world is Jerusalem or Tel Aviv they have their hate you know their celebrations and all that for the homos right in Israel natural seed but see God's kept a covenant with Israel I wish you could all go watch the documentary and and the stories is is beyond it's it's incredible to where you have to realize there was something more Supernatural and even those that were agnostic and said hey I don't believe in God or I didn't some of them even said they were they're older now and and they're given the testimony says I didn't believe in God but now I've come to the conclusion there had to be something that was watching us you see that that Covenant Still Remains with natural Israel and you know why because he already promised in the Book of Revelation there's going to be 144 000 come out of there that he will seal but he can't seal them until he's finished with you and I hello now now we we know that the world Second World War II and Hitler and all of his demonology and possessions and all that amen and what they've done to Israel and all the nations turned against Israel Israel was seeking um what what what would be the word they were seeking refuge in other nations and even America turned her down there was one ship that had 200 and some Jews uh uh up on on the ship and they would not no Nation would let her dock they stayed there for days out in the ocean and they all they all finally drowned the ship just sunk but but no Nation everybody turned their back upon the Jews but the prophet now gave us an Insight it was the tender hand of Jehovah driving the people back to their Homeland they had to be in their Homeland because God doesn't deal with Jews as as individuals he deals with him as a nation and here it was impossible for them to be a nation there was Egypt there was Iraq there was uh the Palestinians and all them Nations around there if you look on the map and see how small Israel is compared to everything else and all these nations amen were were gunning them uh for them and told them you will never be a nation they said we didn't even have artillery we didn't have nothing and yet here we stand today and they begin to tell of accounts that is incredible amen here with some Jewish soldiers amen that that that that that was there and here come hundreds of Palestinians or or what did Jordan Jordanian uh coming up and they knew they knew that they were going to be killed they knew that and and uh uh so they were given their last wishes to each other and and all that and and he said when they got up there they actually the jordanians saw that group and they said there they are and they're getting rerun to them and all of a sudden they backed up and they started looking and and and and and looking up in the heavens and they took off running they all fled what just happened you know and and and and they they were able to capture one of them uh uh uh one of them boys got captured and they asked him why did you run they said you didn't see it there was Angels there we saw uh we we saw a God or uh Abraham father father of Abraham and the angels all around now if he is going to do that to a natural seed what will he do to a rise oh I hope you understand you cannot fail the natural seed fell but you cannot fail because you didn't come from Isaac you come from a Royal Sea you wasn't born of a natural lineage you was born by a supernatural lineage a supernatural birth the same birth the same word that begat Christ also begot you how can you fail you love him yep can't fail and as long as there's a seed the gates of the enemy going to be possessed you realize amen the guarantee comes by being in Christ and we are the promised everybody say we are the promise We Are The Promise Christ was the promise seed right now now you you know foreign you know that when you go plant a seed the seed abides alone unless it dies and rot in the ground but if it does die it bringeth forth much fruit right where do the apples come from from a seed Not seeds as of many but one seed right and so when God was looking for a a a a a super race he couldn't rely up on the natural seed so he brought his own seed ain't that right when he was looking for a body that would represent him on Earth he he couldn't rely upon a natural seed because every one of them failed but he could rely upon the seed that he would produce now you're the fruit of that seed which is Christ for he chose us as we read he chose us in him before the foundation of the world so how did you get here him go ask the Appleseed I had to go ask the Apple off the apple tree how did you get here he would point you down to the seed down in the and in the in the earth and say I came from it you got your Origins Church and your origin isn't a denomination your origin isn't just your good looks your origin isn't from anything natural your origin came from Christ can you say man oh that's all right now did you know that God testified of us Gentiles being the heir of Promise of Abraham in the Old Testament he promised it now it's amazing just how little significant things that happen testify of a greater now in Genesis 48 this is dealing with when Joseph brought his two sons and I'm not going to keep you much longer but he brought his two sons Ephraim and manessa before his father Jacob Jacob was old he was going to die and so he brought his two sons Ephraim and manessa manessa being the oldest Ephraim being the younger son and he brought him to Isaac or did Jacob to be blessed ain't that right so Genesis 48 8 and Israel beheld Joseph's Sons Israel Jacob remember his name was changed from Jacob to Israel and Israel beheld Jacob's sons and said who are these and Joseph said unto his father they are my sons whom God hath given me in this place and he said bring them I pray thee unto me and I will bless them now the eyes of Israel Jacob were dimmed for age so that he could not see and he brought them near unto him and he kissed them and embraced them and Israel said unto Joseph had not I had not thought to see thy face and lo God has shown me also thy seed and Joseph brought them his two boys out from between his knees and he bowed himself with his face to the Earth notice the position that Joseph brings his boys places them and Joseph took them both Ephraim being the younger uh in his right hand uh toward Joseph Israel's left so in other words he brought the younger boy to Jacob's left hand so he could bless him like this and he brought manessa over here to Jacob's right on Jacob's right hand and so uh um we find that that uh it says in Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on ephraim's head who was the younger and left and his left hand up on Vanessa's hand guiding his hands wittingly for manessa was the firstborn so Manasseh should have received the birthright and this was this is why Joseph the right hand always means something Jesus sitting at the right hand of God it's Authority power and so he puts the firstborn Joseph puts that firstborn manessa at the right hand of Joseph so that he could put his right hand and bless the firstborn and put Ephraim the younger on Jacob's left right but then we find that Jacob or Israel placed his hand on the younger and his left hand on the odor and he blessed Joseph and and said God before whom my father's Abraham and Isaac did walk the god which fed me all my life long unto this day the angel which redeemed me from all evil blessed The Lads and let my name be named on them and the name of my father's Abraham and Isaac and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth words are important the blessings were important and when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim it displeased him see because it he led it he put it on the younger and it did please displeased him and he held up his father's hand to remove it from ephraim's head and to put it on manasseh's head and Joseph said unto his father not so my father for this is the firstborn put thy right hand upon his head and his father refused and said I know it my son I know it he also shall become a people and he also shall be great but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he and his seed shall become a multitude of Nations the younger received the birthright so God was showing that the blessing would not come upon Israel the firstborn it would come upon us gentiles wouldn't come upon the natural seed it would come up on the Royal seat you say man now notice what brother Brown said about it Jacob started to bless Ephraim and manessa and when he started to put his hands he put uh on he put Ephraim on the right and Vanessa on the left to get the right hand blessing the oldest and when he started to pray his hands crossed and he gave the youngest one the right hand blessing instead of the one that was on the right hand see and Joseph said not so father you have put the blessing on uh uh uh Manasseh which again manessa actually was the oldest instead of Ephraim uh so brother bran just there but anyway he said Joseph said God or Jacob God has crossed my hands brother Brown said what it went from the Jews the oldest the first chosen of God through the cross coming back to the Gentiles to get the pride blessings come through the cross from the Jew to the Gentile see the Jew rejected the cross there 4 he got a gentile bride just to find it a long time ago look at the natural and they didn't even know what they were doing but the natural would Testify the greater Jacob another place Jacob when he brought his grandchildren between his knees when he put He when he was an old man Ephraim and manessa blessed those children see and in part of this them spiritual blessings that lasted even to this day how he crossed his hands from one to the other taking the blessings from the Jews to the Gentile at the cross another place Jacob crossed his hands and give the younger child the blessing and the two kids was added unto the 12 tribes which was only 10 at that time and he blessed them in Jacob himself and Joseph his prophet's son standing there said father you've done wrong and said you put your right hand blessing on the on on the young child where it ought to have went to the old and Jacob said but I know my hands was crossed but God has crossed them why Israel having the rights to be a bride rejected and sold their Birthright and it went from the old son Israel to a new amen Gentile and the blessings went from there through the cross to the bride another place transfer the life from anything to another thing if you take the life out of a pumpkin and put in a watermelon vine it would bear pumpkins exactly see you take the life out of a peach and put it in a pear it'll bear peaches see because the life that's in the tree gives the evidence of it and there is how the roll seed through Isaac come the natural seed that rejected but in the cross from Ephraim to manessa it was transferred the blessings from the right hand to the left or the left hand belong to the uh the left hand belong to the left the youngest to the Odyssey through there turn the whole situation from the natural seed of Isaacs which rejected Christ and the natural church today still rejects him but the spiritual Royal seed of God that believes the roll Seed of Abraham which believes every word of God there is a confirmation of a living Resurrection what did Jesus Christ in them God knew we were coming oh that's so exciting we were chosen in Christ not Isaac and you say man and Paul in Galatians 3 29 if you be Christ then you are Abraham's seed and heirs everybody say heirs according to the promise what happened it was at the cross that it turned from Jew to Gentile they had every right to be the bride but here you are today you had no rights to be bribed but by his grace you have
