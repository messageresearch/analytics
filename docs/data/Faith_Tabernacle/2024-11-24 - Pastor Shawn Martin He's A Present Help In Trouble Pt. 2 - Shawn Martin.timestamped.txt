[47:14] of dawn the breaking of the day God

[49:08] morning we can't say it enough
[49:13] um I guess and really no need to say it
[49:17] because we see it in by every day but we
[49:21] are living in a troubled World a time of
[49:25] trouble
[49:27] um and we know it's not just a passing
[49:31] thing RI it's really good to have you
[49:33] this morning thought you'd sneak in but
[49:36] you
[49:38] couldn't amen we sure love brother
[49:40] shamiah and sister
[49:42] Bethany
[49:44] amen and um but the
[49:48] um the the trouble that is here is not
[49:51] just a passing thing it's not just a
[49:55] season it's not just an
[49:57] age but we we realize that it's uh
[50:02] tribulation is setting
[50:05] in and um uh the trouble that we are
[50:09] seeing is is prophecy being fulfilled
[50:13] it's the end of not just an age but it's
[50:15] the end of
[50:17] time the end of uh civilization as we
[50:22] would know it is the end of all things
[50:25] the end of
[50:27] political power religious power it's the
[50:30] end of
[50:32] governments and uh and tribulation is
[50:36] setting in it's a time of trouble that
[50:39] no man has seen this Earth has never
[50:44] seen um of what is coming and um it's uh
[50:51] uh it's a it's a time of trouble that
[50:54] really you cannot even fathom
[50:57] them um and um you know when when you
[51:01] hear the word uh the when you read the
[51:04] Bible and it talks about such a time has
[51:06] never been and then you read the history
[51:10] of atrocities and things that have
[51:12] happened Through The Years you think how
[51:15] how how worse could it get how what is
[51:18] this and and I you know you really can't
[51:21] describe it um but we we just know that
[51:25] the Bible says it will be a a time of
[51:27] trouble as like never before and we're
[51:31] we're starting to see the
[51:34] manifestation of what is is uh fixing to
[51:39] uh be
[51:41] fullblown uh and and of course the
[51:44] prophet had talked about of how that man
[51:46] would go completely insane to where uh
[51:50] they will um see birds uh you know uh
[51:54] six blocks I think or city block or
[51:57] something to that with wings that that
[52:00] long and and uh but it'll all be in
[52:03] their minds they it'll just be an
[52:06] imagination um uh be Locust rise up out
[52:09] of the Earth with long hair to torment
[52:12] women that have cut their hair and um uh
[52:17] so so it's but it's all in their mind
[52:20] and of course Hollywood is preparing the
[52:23] hearts uh the the minds and we're seeing
[52:25] that people are going
[52:27] mentally uh insane it's it's a mental
[52:31] it's a mental thing it's a mental
[52:33] breakdown and it's it's happening more
[52:37] and more and so we this is is something
[52:41] that the doctors will never be able to
[52:43] fix psychiatrists psychologist whatever
[52:46] can't can't fix uh because this has been
[52:51] prophesied for the last days and a time
[52:54] of tribulation
[52:56] and so the world is getting in the
[52:59] spirit of the last days as the prophet
[53:02] would tell us in in the 60s of uh that
[53:06] it's preparing and of course the comic
[53:08] books and and and we could even say the
[53:12] movies and and uh these things are
[53:16] preparing this the world has been being
[53:20] prepared it's for this time and we're
[53:22] looking at a generation that is so wacko
[53:26] it's uh in their beliefs and uh kind of
[53:29] interesting you know they've got a a
[53:31] transgender that got voted in to the
[53:34] White House and and of course um uh you
[53:38] know he's he's uh I guess expected to
[53:41] use the uh wants to use the women's
[53:43] restroom and and and so you've got a
[53:46] republican woman that is saying no you
[53:49] know that that don't need to be we ain't
[53:51] going to tolerate that and and of course
[53:54] she's trying to pass the law they then
[53:56] you've got the the AOC you know the
[53:59] liberal lady that is saying well for her
[54:02] to do that that's endangering women you
[54:05] know and and you know H how can a
[54:08] transgender endanger women you know or
[54:11] or or you know not having a transgender
[54:14] in the women's bathroom endanger women
[54:17] but that's just how insane that that
[54:19] they're coming it's and and they truly
[54:22] believe this stuff they they truly
[54:24] believe that a man be a woman and and uh
[54:28] putting you know uh women's uh uh uh
[54:32] things in men's bathrooms and and things
[54:35] like that and you're just like you know
[54:37] but what what it is the world has been
[54:40] getting in the spirit all this time for
[54:42] the last days and it's been it's been
[54:45] Hollywood it's it's been all of the
[54:48] things that have been preparing the
[54:50] people's minds for this and and uh uh
[54:54] brother brandom said the comic books are
[54:55] preparing the children's mind for the
[54:57] blast that he's going to give them and
[55:00] brother it's here uh and and so but yet
[55:06] in in all of this it you know uh Romans
[55:10] uh 15 and9 it tells us that whatsoever
[55:14] things were written a four time were
[55:16] written for our learning that we through
[55:20] patience and comfort of the scriptures
[55:23] might have hope and and and so what God
[55:27] has written in this in these scriptures
[55:30] is not for to be debated it's it's not
[55:33] for us to to to look at it and and and
[55:37] and say well I just can't believe that
[55:39] it's it's it's written for our comfort
[55:41] it's written for our learning and for
[55:45] our comfort that we might have hope so
[55:48] this morning we when in our in our
[55:50] scriptures that we have read we are
[55:53] comforted in these things because
[55:56] because we we we read that he is a
[55:59] present help in time of trouble uh he is
[56:04] a present help God knew that we were
[56:07] coming to this day he knew that it would
[56:10] be so evil and so so uh uh vile he knew
[56:14] that the troubles was coming for he
[56:17] already said that men's Hearts would be
[56:19] failing them for fear speaking of this
[56:22] day but then he would ra put in the
[56:24] scriptures that he would be a present
[56:26] help in in trouble amen and and
[56:30] therefore we will not fear you
[56:32] understand that church we will not fear
[56:34] that's the reaction of the elect of God
[56:37] when we understand that he is the
[56:40] present help in the time of trouble when
[56:42] the fear is gripping the hearts of men
[56:45] to where they're failing and and they
[56:47] don't know what to do and and they're at
[56:49] a at uh the politicians and the
[56:52] brightest minds and and and and and the
[56:55] government and the churches and and all
[56:58] these things don't know what to do uh uh
[57:00] and they're trying to stop what is
[57:02] coming but they can't stop it because
[57:04] it's already been promised God's already
[57:07] prophesied and his word cannot fail you
[57:10] understand that and so we're not getting
[57:13] into this in into the the spirit of the
[57:16] last days trying to fix problems that
[57:18] cannot be fixed but we do find comfort
[57:21] in the fact that he is our present help
[57:24] in time of trouble amen and so that
[57:27] spirit of fear cannot grip our hearts
[57:30] and even though it does try now we
[57:33] understand that there are two spirits in
[57:34] the world today and and again you know I
[57:37] I I thank God every day for a prophet
[57:39] can't thank him enough for sending me a
[57:41] prophet uh uh you know and and more and
[57:44] more I understand why brother brandham
[57:47] said for God to send a prophit Amen to a
[57:49] people it's Grace to that people and I
[57:52] say Amazing Grace it's been Grace that
[57:54] God would send a Prophet amen and he
[57:57] would this Prophet by his through his
[58:00] message and through divine order of God
[58:03] he would expose the spirit that was in
[58:06] in in the world the two spirits and and
[58:09] them two Spirits is one of them is the
[58:11] spirit of God and the other is the
[58:14] spirit of Satan and and according to
[58:17] First John 4:6 uh God is the spirit of
[58:21] Truth and Satan is the spirit of error
[58:25] amen God is the spirit of Truth and and
[58:28] Satan is the spirit of error now now
[58:32] we're looking at God uh and and and and
[58:34] I I maybe just we we we're here talking
[58:39] of he is a present help in time of
[58:41] trouble and and and we want to know who
[58:43] he is right amen see and and so uh we we
[58:47] don't want to mistake the spirit of air
[58:50] as being God and being a present help in
[58:53] time of trouble because the spirit of
[58:55] air will take you in destroy you amen so
[58:58] the so so God uh he's the spirit of
[59:01] Truth and and and John 1 one tells us
[59:05] that the word is God ain't that right
[59:07] and then Jesus in praying to the father
[59:11] said Thy word is truth Thy word is truth
[59:15] amen so therefore God being the word is
[59:21] the spirit of Truth amen God being the
[59:24] word is the spirit of Truth so we could
[59:27] say that the word is is a present help
[59:30] in time of trouble and we could say the
[59:33] spirit of Truth amen is a is a present
[59:36] help in time of trouble can you say Amen
[59:40] it's not just the spirit it's not just
[59:41] the feeling it's not just an emotion
[59:44] that's our help in time of trouble amen
[59:46] because that's what the Pentecostals
[59:48] thought amen they taught us they showed
[59:50] us they tried to get us to to understand
[59:52] that it was emotions that was your help
[59:54] it was Sensation that was was your help
[59:56] it was some prophecy that was your help
[59:58] it was some some gift to tongues that
[1:00:01] was your help that's not true amen
[1:00:03] because we know that the spirit of air
[1:00:05] can do all of them things amen but the
[1:00:08] the the spirit of Truth is a present
[1:00:11] help in the time of trouble amen see the
[1:00:14] word is a present help in the time of
[1:00:17] trouble and we can just say it the word
[1:00:18] for our age is a present help in the
[1:00:22] time of trouble amen that's right see so
[1:00:26] now now you know we we automatically
[1:00:29] picture God and and I say we the just
[1:00:32] Humanity uh uh picture God as being good
[1:00:35] and and and Satan uh uh as being uh Pure
[1:00:40] Evil and and that is true he he is evil
[1:00:44] God is good and there there is no sin
[1:00:47] found in God there is no evil found in
[1:00:50] God but but and and and and we find that
[1:00:53] John 10:10 Jesus gives the the uh shows
[1:00:58] a difference between the Satan and and
[1:01:02] and and and him God uh the thief cometh
[1:01:05] not but for to steal to kill and to
[1:01:09] destroy so he's not your present help in
[1:01:12] time of trouble he's come to steal to
[1:01:16] kill and to destroy but he says I am
[1:01:20] come and we know this is God made flesh
[1:01:23] I am come the word made flesh the spirit
[1:01:26] of truth I'm come that you may have life
[1:01:29] and have it more abundantly so these two
[1:01:32] Spirits are roing in the land today one
[1:01:35] is to kill to steal and to destroy and
[1:01:38] another spirit is here a present help in
[1:01:41] the time of trouble to give life and
[1:01:44] that you may have it more abundantly
[1:01:47] amen see and so uh uh uh so we we
[1:01:52] understand that one is good and one is
[1:01:54] bad one is to give life one is to kill
[1:01:56] steal and destroy but then Jesus said in
[1:02:00] the Book of Matthew that the spirits the
[1:02:03] spirits would be so close that it would
[1:02:06] deceive the elect amen if it was
[1:02:09] possible amen they would look close
[1:02:11] alike the uh uh to where it would be
[1:02:13] hard to tell the difference and actually
[1:02:16] the only ones that'll be able to tell
[1:02:18] the difference is the elect amen and and
[1:02:21] so then in 2 Thessalonians 2:4 Paul
[1:02:25] tells us that that Satan the spirit of
[1:02:28] air the one that is trying to kill to
[1:02:30] steal and to destroy notice he opposeth
[1:02:34] and exalteth himself above all that is
[1:02:38] called God in other words he opposeth
[1:02:40] and exalteth himself above all the word
[1:02:43] can you say Amen everything that God is
[1:02:46] trying to do amen Satan is opposing it
[1:02:50] and exalting himself above it amen or
[1:02:54] that is called God or that is worship so
[1:02:58] that he as God sth in the temple of God
[1:03:03] Amen showing himself that he is God Amen
[1:03:07] so this evil one this this Spirit of air
[1:03:11] is actually showing himself that he is
[1:03:14] God he sits in the church he preaches
[1:03:16] the gospel he sings the songs of Zion
[1:03:20] and yet he is a spirit that is trying to
[1:03:23] kill steal and to dest destroy amen so
[1:03:27] close that it would be deceive the elect
[1:03:30] if possible now we read in Isaiah
[1:03:34] 1413 that Satan the very Heart Of Satan
[1:03:37] the very core of Satan he said it in his
[1:03:40] heart I will sin above the clouds and I
[1:03:44] will be like the most high I will be
[1:03:48] like the most high and he said he'll sit
[1:03:50] above the stars of God the sons of God
[1:03:53] is what the the interpretation as the
[1:03:56] sons of God he he will he he's going to
[1:03:59] he determined that he will dictate the
[1:04:01] sons of God he he is dictated that he
[1:04:04] will be the ones that that that sits
[1:04:07] above the star the sons of God and Rule
[1:04:10] and uh but but uh that but the the Bible
[1:04:14] says how art thou Fallen oh Lucifer can
[1:04:17] you say Amen so so now only God
[1:04:20] everybody say only God is a present help
[1:04:24] in time of trouble only God Amen only
[1:04:28] that word Vindicated word uh word for
[1:04:31] the age is a present help in time of
[1:04:33] trouble no wonder Satan is attacking
[1:04:35] this message amen and I say to any of
[1:04:38] you if y'all if y'all hear of this uh uh
[1:04:41] you y'all get sent of these things of
[1:04:43] negativity don't listen to it amen don't

[1:04:59] me the answer God's already said it's
[1:05:01] true I don't care what the naysayer says

[1:05:07] interested don't listen to it don't just
[1:05:10] just you don't want negative in your
[1:05:12] mind you want to think upon the positive
[1:05:14] God's done everything he can to give the
[1:05:17] positive in your mind that this message
[1:05:19] is right is true you don't need to look
[1:05:21] at anything else can you say amen that's
[1:05:24] right see and that's too amen I like
[1:05:27] what Jack Duff said brother Jack Duff
[1:05:29] amen someone sent it and I sent it to my
[1:05:31] family amen but he says you know he said
[1:05:34] the answer I've got Amen to talk to tell
[1:05:37] these guys that are talking negative
[1:05:38] about this message amen he says I'm not
[1:05:41] interested about a bridge I'm not
[1:05:43] interested about what brother Bram said
[1:05:44] about all these things and trying to
[1:05:46] prove all this he says all I got to say
[1:05:48] is sech the way Jesus told the Skeptics
[1:05:50] of his day search the scriptures search
[1:05:53] the scriptures can you say in anyone can
[1:05:56] put things up on Google anyone can put
[1:05:59] things on YouTube anyone can do what
[1:06:01] your answer is in the scripture search
[1:06:03] the scriptures for in them you think you
[1:06:06] have eternal life but they testify of
[1:06:08] what that message is they testify of the
[1:06:10] messenger amen they testify we're not
[1:06:13] wondering about him we know what the
[1:06:15] Bible says it is the seventh angel
[1:06:17] messenger it is Malachi 4 it is a amen a
[1:06:21] Vindicated prophet of God Amen to bring
[1:06:24] the message and I am part of that elect
[1:06:27] can you say amen amen that's right see
[1:06:31] amen I already know who he is and I'm
[1:06:33] just discovering who I am ain't that
[1:06:36] right amen so we we look that only God
[1:06:39] is a present help in time of trouble he
[1:06:42] is the only one who has the power to
[1:06:45] restore to save to deliver and to heal
[1:06:49] amen so what is God God is Supernatural
[1:06:53] how many believes that God is
[1:06:55] Supernatural and and and we've talked
[1:06:58] about it before but Supernatural
[1:07:00] transcends the natural amen uh uh it
[1:07:04] goes beyond the limits in other words of
[1:07:06] the natural amen it exceeds any
[1:07:09] restriction the natural has amen every
[1:07:12] man is is is limited in what he can do
[1:07:16] even you are limited in what you can do
[1:07:19] you're limited in your natural ability
[1:07:21] and I'll say it this way you are even
[1:07:23] Limited in to fulfill the word of God
[1:07:25] god without the supernatural there is no
[1:07:28] way that you can overcome your trials
[1:07:31] without the supernatural there is no way
[1:07:34] amen that you can even believe this
[1:07:36] message amen without the supernatural so
[1:07:39] God is Supernatural so what thing
[1:07:42] natural thing can heal you there's
[1:07:45] nothing amen what natural thing can
[1:07:47] raise the dead there's nothing what
[1:07:50] natural thing can change an old man and
[1:07:52] an old woman back to their youth again
[1:07:55] there's nothing amen what natural thing
[1:07:58] can bring something into existence that
[1:08:01] was not there amen there's nothing amen
[1:08:04] see so but but when we think of God well
[1:08:08] God is Supernatural he's the one that
[1:08:10] can heal he's the one that can raise the
[1:08:13] dead he's the one that can change amen
[1:08:16] an old man back to his youth again he's
[1:08:19] the one that can bring uh something amen
[1:08:21] that was nothing and bring it into
[1:08:24] existence amen for he is Supernatural
[1:08:28] can you say amen I just want you to know
[1:08:30] what kind of present help he is to you
[1:08:32] in the time of trouble God is
[1:08:35] Supernatural and he's not bound to you
[1:08:37] he's not limited to your trouble he's
[1:08:39] not limited to what professional say
[1:08:42] he's not limited to what medical science
[1:08:44] says he's not limited to what a doctor
[1:08:47] of divinity says he is Supernatural and
[1:08:50] he is your present help in the time of
[1:08:53] your trouble
[1:08:56] right God is Supernatural he can work
[1:08:59] miracles because he's Supernatural do
[1:09:02] you believe that amen what is a miracle
[1:09:05] it's something that exceeds the limits
[1:09:07] of the natural here is the natural amen
[1:09:10] and when the natural says it cannot be
[1:09:12] done anymore it's over it's finished
[1:09:15] it's it's settled amen then the
[1:09:17] supernatural comes on the scene and and
[1:09:20] and defies everything that the natural
[1:09:22] just told you amen and makes it possible
[1:09:26] that's right amen see and so now we find
[1:09:31] amen that God is a present help in the
[1:09:33] time of trouble amen but to see him to
[1:09:37] see him you have to look for the
[1:09:41] supernatural can you say Amen to see him
[1:09:44] you have to to to to to look for the
[1:09:46] supernatural to walk with him you have
[1:09:49] to walk with the supernatural to believe
[1:09:51] in him you have to believe in the
[1:09:53] Supernatural see not everything is
[1:09:56] natural we live in a natural and a
[1:09:59] supernatural world at the same time amen
[1:10:03] you know natural human beings are here
[1:10:05] amen but the angels of God are here as
[1:10:08] well how many believes that we believe
[1:10:11] that Jesus Christ is present Among Us
[1:10:14] now for he is a present hell you know
[1:10:17] it's sad to to to see that God there
[1:10:20] there's so many people billions and
[1:10:22] billions of people that really don't
[1:10:24] know God they claim to serve him but
[1:10:27] they don't know him amen and and so how
[1:10:30] can a person truly know uh serve God and
[1:10:34] not know him amen and and I'm talking
[1:10:37] about knowing him I'm not talking about
[1:10:39] going to a seminar even coming to church
[1:10:41] and having a little lesson about God and
[1:10:44] to where you can go one you know just at
[1:10:46] 1 2 3 4 You know and know all the the
[1:10:48] the basics of God and and all of these
[1:10:51] things I'm talking about when knowing
[1:10:52] him I'm talking about experiencing him
[1:10:55] him amen a lot of people say they they
[1:10:57] they serving God but they've never
[1:10:59] experienced him amen see and and so
[1:11:03] knowing him by experience how can a
[1:11:05] person worship Him and and and not
[1:11:09] believe in him no no wonder they they
[1:11:12] the prophet said they're thinking they
[1:11:14] think they're worshiping God but they're
[1:11:15] actually worshiping the devil amen see
[1:11:18] so so they're say they they're
[1:11:20] worshiping God Amen but but but they
[1:11:23] don't believe in him because they don't
[1:11:24] believe in the supernatural amen see
[1:11:27] amen and and so they they may believe in
[1:11:30] his existence but they don't believe him
[1:11:33] to be what he really is is is
[1:11:36] Supernatural so they they
[1:11:39] unconsciously believe that God uh uh uh
[1:11:43] has limitations as though he was
[1:11:45] something natural amen that's why they
[1:11:47] fall apart amen when it seems like
[1:11:50] they're going to die when it seems like
[1:11:52] they're at their their their their their
[1:11:54] their wits end uh on things and their
[1:11:56] back is against the wall then all of a
[1:11:58] sudden they just start falling apart and
[1:12:01] and I'm telling you it's easy to fall
[1:12:03] aart amen when you get bad news that
[1:12:05] you're going to die amen it's easy all
[1:12:07] of a sudden for fear to grip and and you
[1:12:09] think oh no what am I going to do what
[1:12:11] what's my best surgeon what's my best
[1:12:13] remedy what's this what's you know but
[1:12:15] but but here God is a present help in
[1:12:18] the time of trouble can you say amen
[1:12:21] amen see and and and we're not against
[1:12:24] doctors we're not against all these
[1:12:25] things but they're not the final answer
[1:12:27] amen they're not the final verdict that
[1:12:29] no doctor can give you a final verdict
[1:12:32] amen and until God see God's the one
[1:12:34] that gives the final verdict God's the
[1:12:37] one that moves he's the last one Amen to
[1:12:39] move on the scene can you say Amen if we
[1:12:42] could say it that way amen so we we we
[1:12:45] see that natural men in their
[1:12:47] professional careers amen carry more
[1:12:50] weight today in their estimations their
[1:12:54] opinions and agnosis than the
[1:12:56] supernatural God God that does in his
[1:12:59] own word amen it it seems that the
[1:13:02] Professionals in their opinions and
[1:13:04] their diagnosis and and and and their
[1:13:07] professionalism amen they carry more
[1:13:10] weight amen uh uh uh concerning us and
[1:13:13] what they think and what they say and
[1:13:15] what they do and and about us and all
[1:13:17] these things then God does in his own
[1:13:20] word oh my that's exactly right there is
[1:13:24] no word that is an absolute this is the
[1:13:27] word that is the absolute this is the
[1:13:29] only word amen that has the final say so
[1:13:33] how many believes that the doctor can
[1:13:35] say something it's a professional
[1:13:37] opinion but you just know that he's only
[1:13:39] a per a practicing physician but there
[1:13:42] is a great physician and that great
[1:13:45] physician has already declared in his
[1:13:47] word I'm the god that Health thee there
[1:13:50] is no weapon formed against you that's
[1:13:52] going to prosper amen this is the final
[1:13:55] word of every situation don't you fall
[1:13:58] apart when the world is turning against
[1:14:01] you and everything is is is turning
[1:14:03] against you and your back is against the
[1:14:05] wall and you don't see any way out there
[1:14:08] is a final word to it amen and that's
[1:14:11] God's word and he is a present help in
[1:14:14] the time of trouble amen that's right so
[1:14:18] we find that uh uh the church see has
[1:14:22] gotten away from the supernatural amen
[1:14:25] you see the supernatural was presented
[1:14:27] uh to them in this age amen the son of
[1:14:30] man was revealed the church kicked him
[1:14:33] out see so the Supernatural is more
[1:14:36] sensation it's more than just a good
[1:14:38] thought it's the person of God God is
[1:14:41] Supernatural his actions are
[1:14:43] Supernatural his thoughts are
[1:14:45] Supernatural his word is Supernatural do
[1:14:48] you believe that even the fruits of the
[1:14:50] spirit the prophet said is Supernatural
[1:14:52] amen you can love and and a human love
[1:14:55] it'll come to its end but then there's a
[1:14:57] supernatural love amen and how in the
[1:15:00] world can a man love his worst enemy aen
[1:15:03] that would kill him if he could and yet
[1:15:05] there's a supernatural love there amen
[1:15:08] that just keeps on and keeps on Amen
[1:15:11] it's just God God so we we find that the
[1:15:17] the supernatural was presented to the
[1:15:20] church in this age to the world Amen and
[1:15:25] they kicked him out the son of man
[1:15:27] revealed and it kicked him out so now
[1:15:30] the whole world the whole world Amen
[1:15:34] stands in a condition to where they
[1:15:35] explain away the supernatural they have
[1:15:38] their church but no Supernatural they
[1:15:40] have their choirs but no Supernatural
[1:15:42] they talk about the blood but even now
[1:15:45] they're even taking the blood out
[1:15:47] because they don't see any reality to
[1:15:49] the blood amen you there's no reality to
[1:15:51] the blood when you take the supernatural
[1:15:53] out
[1:15:55] can you say amen amen that's true you
[1:15:58] even got them explaining away the
[1:16:00] Rapture because they don't believe in a
[1:16:02] supernatural amen how how can you go in
[1:16:05] a you know even even you know years ago
[1:16:07] my cousin you know talked about Rapture
[1:16:10] and all that he's questioning about how
[1:16:11] how in the world is that going to happen
[1:16:13] amen how's if if you're going to be
[1:16:15] caught up you know then how is it that
[1:16:17] Europe here and China's down here and
[1:16:19] and he's trying to reason it away I said
[1:16:21] I don't care about all that I don't even
[1:16:23] know how to explain it all but there's
[1:16:24] going to be the Rapture because I
[1:16:26] believe the Rapture is not a natural
[1:16:28] thing it's a supernatural thing and the
[1:16:31] god that can save my soul when it was
[1:16:34] impossible I have no question I or no
[1:16:37] answers to how he could save my soul I
[1:16:39] have no answer as to how the blood amen
[1:16:43] can be so strong that God can look at me
[1:16:46] and justify me as though I never done it
[1:16:49] and see me as a sinless righteous
[1:16:51] virtuous bride of Jesus Christ but all I
[1:16:54] can say It's
[1:16:56] Supernatural it's just
[1:16:59] Supernatural it so the world has explain
[1:17:04] the supernatural away leaving them to
[1:17:07] think that the events that take place
[1:17:10] are the result of a natural
[1:17:12] [Music]
[1:17:14] happening the prophet said Egypt done
[1:17:16] that Egypt was so scientific in their
[1:17:20] learning so educated they leaned to all
[1:17:23] of that they were so Heathen in their
[1:17:26] mind and their understanding that they
[1:17:29] thought that when God parted the Red Sea
[1:17:32] amen they didn't see it as something
[1:17:34] Supernatural they thought it was
[1:17:36] something natural an earthquake or or
[1:17:38] something that took place and so they
[1:17:40] they didn't see and so brother Brown
[1:17:42] said Egypt drowned in the Red Sea
[1:17:45] because she failed to see the day and
[1:17:47] she considered the supernatural of God
[1:17:50] to be a natural thing that happened in
[1:17:53] the earth so they could not see God as
[1:17:56] being a present help they just saw it as
[1:17:59] something natural well if it's natural
[1:18:02] they crossed it we can do it but the
[1:18:04] supernatural closed that water up on
[1:18:07] them can you say amen that's right see
[1:18:10] and so we find it was actually a
[1:18:12] supernatural happening that Israel could
[1:18:15] walk on dry ground amen right between
[1:18:18] them Waters amen and there was a
[1:18:20] supernatural power holding them
[1:18:23] back do you believe that you realize
[1:18:26] what's been stopped in This World War II
[1:18:28] and this world coming to obliviation was
[1:18:30] a supernatural hand amen of God because
[1:18:34] there's somebody that needed to be
[1:18:35] sealed there was a bride that needed to
[1:18:37] be caught
[1:18:38] out can you say Amen now Church they're
[1:18:41] talking about World War I amen there
[1:18:43] there it's that is a common thing right
[1:18:46] now the nations are shaking amen they're
[1:18:49] doing everything in their power but all
[1:18:52] I can tell you it will not happen until
[1:18:54] the bride is gone the bride must happen
[1:18:57] the bride must be changed and if you
[1:19:00] don't believe in a supernatural power of
[1:19:02] God I don't know what to do amen but I'm
[1:19:05] going to tell you he is here as a
[1:19:07] present help in the time of
[1:19:09] [Applause]
[1:19:10] trouble he sure
[1:19:13] Isen oft times you know the word
[1:19:18] coincidence is used when something
[1:19:20] happens oh that was just a coincidence
[1:19:22] oh that was just luck
[1:19:26] Christians should never use that word
[1:19:28] luck that's right I like that song says
[1:19:31] don't call me lucky call me blessed
[1:19:34] amen so this word coincidence is in you
[1:19:38] know it means it just happened to be
[1:19:40] that way without Rhyme or Reason it was
[1:19:42] just by chance uh or by accident or
[1:19:46] whatever but I don't believe that things
[1:19:48] happened by chance or by coincidence I I
[1:19:51] I don't believe in coincidence I I
[1:19:53] didn't get saved by
[1:19:55] coincidence I didn't get healed by
[1:19:59] coincidence uh you know the the pain
[1:20:01] that just happened to quit it it didn't
[1:20:03] just happen to quit uh uh it was God you
[1:20:08] you know have you ever just had a little
[1:20:09] pains and you've asked God to do it he
[1:20:11] touch you and he touches you and then
[1:20:13] Satan says oh you was just imagining
[1:20:14] that or it would have really went away
[1:20:16] you didn't need to pray about that you
[1:20:18] know and and he trying to get you to
[1:20:20] reason with it but but I do remember I
[1:20:23] do remember that when I was doing some
[1:20:25] electrical work with uh men Wendell and
[1:20:27] another man in uh doing was doing a
[1:20:30] wiring a church actually and uh uh we we
[1:20:34] were had already ran our conduit and we
[1:20:36] were uh had put the wires through the
[1:20:38] conduit and I I was clipping some wires
[1:20:41] off and it it shot right in my eye and
[1:20:45] oh man it was just a little piece and it
[1:20:48] got my eye and I was trying to get it
[1:20:49] out and it wouldn't come out and uh I
[1:20:52] couldn't even open my eye we were uh an
[1:20:54] hour away from from home and so worked
[1:20:58] throughout that day and you know I was
[1:21:01] laying in the truck there just my eye
[1:21:03] just kept watering and I it just hurting
[1:21:06] so bad and I didn't want to go to the
[1:21:08] doctor and it wasn't that I was against
[1:21:10] doctors I just you know uh maybe young
[1:21:13] and dumb I don't know but I I didn't go
[1:21:16] but I sitting there just in pain and
[1:21:18] there's a song that um uh well a Baptist
[1:21:23] preacher uh uh sings it and and it's uh
[1:21:27] called without be made whole uh than
[1:21:30] Believe In Christ and all of a sudden
[1:21:33] that that song just kept playing in my
[1:21:35] mind without be made whole then Believe
[1:21:37] In Christ without be made whole then
[1:21:39] Believe In Christ and and so I said Lord
[1:21:44] I said I don't know if that's you or not
[1:21:47] but but I said I I do believe in you and
[1:21:51] and I know that you could take this pain
[1:21:53] away right now and I'm asking that you
[1:21:55] will and the pain left I mean it was
[1:22:00] gone you know now of course Satan was
[1:22:03] trying to say well that's just your
[1:22:05] imagination all that I said no that
[1:22:07] wasn't my imagination I mean the water
[1:22:09] was running my eye was red and it
[1:22:11] cleared up it was when I moved up here
[1:22:15] when I'm just a little bit after I moved
[1:22:17] up here one day something protruded out
[1:22:20] of my
[1:22:21] eyelid and I pulled that out and there
[1:22:23] was that copper wire
[1:22:25] that was that come out of my eyelid and
[1:22:28] I said Satan see that wasn't coincidence
[1:22:31] that was a supernatural hand of God that
[1:22:33] was a present help in the time of
[1:22:36] trouble so see so so when when healing
[1:22:40] takes place uh it's not by accident see
[1:22:43] we I I didn't just happen to start
[1:22:46] breathing again when I was just a baby
[1:22:48] and my breath the breath left the body
[1:22:51] and and and the mom ran me up you ran up
[1:22:55] carrying me to the church uh to the
[1:22:57] platform here in uh uh there in Oklahoma
[1:23:00] and and saying pray pray and the church
[1:23:02] began to began to pray and a a breath
[1:23:05] come back into the body and that I just
[1:23:07] didn't that wasn't coincidence that was
[1:23:10] a supernatural something Supernatural
[1:23:13] how how many's ever had Supernatural
[1:23:15] touch in your life see it is an accident
[1:23:17] it leaves doctors baffled because
[1:23:20] they'll tell you something and then God
[1:23:22] does something totally opposite and I
[1:23:24] just love proven to the devil that God's
[1:23:26] still living I just love to show the
[1:23:28] doctors that that I I appreciate what
[1:23:30] you say I appreciate every effort but
[1:23:32] there's a God that I serve that my end
[1:23:35] ain't over yet can you say amen that's
[1:23:38] right say it's you know uh uh uh so so
[1:23:42] uh Faith uh you know she she had two uh
[1:23:45] uh she had a bump rise in her hand and
[1:23:47] she said Dad show show the uh she said
[1:23:50] feel that and I felt it looked like a
[1:23:51] bone or something in her hand and she
[1:23:53] said that really hurts and and uh she I
[1:23:57] said what did you do she said I don't
[1:23:58] know she it just just popped up and so
[1:24:01] then the next day she's come back from
[1:24:03] work and she said dad say another

[1:25:16] supernatural happening amen and now you
[1:25:19] know the Supernatural is what blinds the
[1:25:23] unbeliever brother brandom actually says
[1:25:25] it makes them worse the supernatural
[1:25:27] makes the people worse amen because it
[1:25:30] blinds them and he says this that's why
[1:25:33] today the message blinds the people so
[1:25:36] much is because they're not used to
[1:25:38] seeing the supernatural see it's not
[1:25:41] just a man message if it was just a
[1:25:43] message like a a a Baptist or a
[1:25:46] Pentecostal or whatever people would
[1:25:48] readily accept this amen but see it's a
[1:25:51] supernatural message amen it it didn't
[1:25:54] come from brother brandham amen that's
[1:25:56] why God had his picture taken this is
[1:25:58] God's message you understand that God
[1:26:01] ain't vindicating some man and saying oh
[1:26:04] follow that man that's not the point
[1:26:06] it's God saying I'm the one that's
[1:26:08] speaking this is my voice this is my
[1:26:10] word this is my
[1:26:13] message it's supernatural can you say
[1:26:16] amen and the message is the son of man
[1:26:19] revealed amen now notice in Luke

[1:26:46] happening this day this scripture is
[1:26:48] being fulfilled amen and then they shall
[1:26:51] see the son of man coming in a cloud

[1:27:24] said man we were all excited about this
[1:27:26] wondering what it was and and he said we
[1:27:29] trying to figure it all out in our mind
[1:27:31] now what is this you know and they all
[1:27:33] had the magazines out in the parking lot
[1:27:35] before church and and they were all
[1:27:36] talking it was just a big deal and then
[1:27:38] brother brandham comes and rising of the
[1:27:40] sun I believe it was and and he says I
[1:27:43] wondered about this and he said the
[1:27:45] angel of the Lord told me turn it to
[1:27:47] your right and he said now they're all
[1:27:49] sitting there Ed Hunter said we're all
[1:27:51] sitting there wondering what this was
[1:27:53] you know what significance and when
[1:27:55] brother brandham said it you said you
[1:27:57] and and he and they turned it to the
[1:27:59] right and he said you could just hear
[1:28:01] the gasp in the audio you know like wow

[1:28:07] more than just a
[1:28:10] rocket smoke from a rocket this was more
[1:28:14] than just whatever this was something
[1:28:17] Supernatural and then brother Brandon

[1:28:21] picture can you say amen and tell us
[1:28:24] tell them tell us amen that this was the
[1:28:27] Supreme judge and he has come with power

[1:28:34] final say on your situation amen when it
[1:28:37] looks like it's hopeless when it looks
[1:28:39] like everything is going down the drain
[1:28:41] amen the judge has stepped forward and
[1:28:43] he's shown that he is a present help in
[1:28:46] the time of trouble you don't have to
[1:28:48] fear you don't have to worry you don't

[1:29:17] people are losing their minds and having
[1:29:19] mental breakdowns he came in the time of
[1:29:22] trouble
[1:29:27] and the Messiah sign was done in this
[1:29:29] day to declare his presence brother
[1:29:32] Brown said it that's what it's done for
[1:29:34] is to declare his presence a Vindication
[1:29:38] of him being
[1:29:40] here do you love him is that not what
[1:29:44] God done in the body of MDC when he
[1:29:47] stood before Abraham that day he
[1:29:50] declared himself as God before for
[1:29:54] Abraham by the Messiah sign where is
[1:29:57] Sarah thy wife she's in the tent behind
[1:30:00] you why did she laugh and Sarah says I
[1:30:02] didn't laugh and he said oh yes you did
[1:30:04] laugh amen what was it there was a
[1:30:06] supernatural God that was taking and
[1:30:09] reading her mind reading her thoughts
[1:30:12] and telling her exactly what she thought
[1:30:15] about what was it it was a sign that God
[1:30:18] was standing there in a body of
[1:30:20] Flesh yes
[1:30:22] siren huah Jesus showed that that the
[1:30:27] same God that appeared to Abraham was on
[1:30:29] the earth in his day amen remember he
[1:30:31] told the woman at the well amen all the
[1:30:35] things that she had done who she was and
[1:30:38] who she had been living with and d d d
[1:30:40] see and she immediately recognized that
[1:30:43] God was standing there in flesh can you
[1:30:47] say amen and I have to tell you that
[1:30:50] same Supernatural sign was done in this
[1:30:52] day amen Church that wasn't just a
[1:30:55] coincidence that isn't just something a
[1:30:56] man can do amen even his Skeptics say
[1:30:59] that not one time did he miss it not one
[1:31:02] time did he fail oh yeah they can laugh
[1:31:04] and they can have their news media and
[1:31:06] all that today amen he's been long gone
[1:31:09] he's dead and and and you got the
[1:31:10] Skeptics amen but the people that were
[1:31:12] sitting in that meeting amen his that
[1:31:16] didn't even believe his teaching didn't
[1:31:18] even believe all that would tell you
[1:31:20] that the the discernment was real there
[1:31:23] was no mistake in it it was perfect
[1:31:25] every time why it was God Amen showing
[1:31:30] himself he's here in the time of
[1:31:36] trouble trouble on every hand the world
[1:31:39] is about to
[1:31:44] blow amen but we have seen the
[1:31:47] supernatural sign and I don't know about
[1:31:50] you but I believe he's here
[1:31:54] amen isn't it wonderful
[1:31:57] amen you'll go listen to the message
[1:31:59] Supernatural the
[1:32:01] supernatural brother Brown tells us that
[1:32:03] it takes the right atmosphere to see the
[1:32:07] supernatural can you say amen amen amen
[1:32:11] that's right look at the kind of
[1:32:13] atmosphere the world has created by
[1:32:15] their unbelief yeah the so-called
[1:32:18] Christian will readily accept some
[1:32:21] formalistic teaching and some
[1:32:22] formalistic worship but he cannot accept
[1:32:26] the
[1:32:27] supernatural amen and so brother brand
[1:32:31] says now the idea of a real believer
[1:32:33] today is one who loves the Lord goes to
[1:32:36] church every Sunday Pays His dues to the
[1:32:38] church treats his neighbors right he
[1:32:41] said but that's just moral
[1:32:44] acts you can do that and well still go
[1:32:48] to hell that that that that has nothing
[1:32:51] to do with it amen that of course you
[1:32:54] should do that as a good
[1:32:56] citizen right but that's just moral acts
[1:33:00] see but that's the idea of a real
[1:33:02] believer today oh he goes to church he's
[1:33:04] a Believer he's saved you know he he
[1:33:07] treats his neighbors right he goes to
[1:33:08] church every Sunday Pays His dues Pays
[1:33:11] His tithes and offerings and and helps
[1:33:13] in the church he's a worker in the
[1:33:14] church and all these things that guy's a
[1:33:16] real believer brother Brown said that's
[1:33:17] just moral act he said another place a
[1:33:20] man that's born again everybody say
[1:33:22] that's born again
[1:33:24] hungers say it with me hungers for the
[1:33:28] Supernatural and the power of the Living
[1:33:30] God not satisfied just sitting on a a
[1:33:33] bench not just satisfied going to church
[1:33:36] every Sunday not satisfied just playing
[1:33:38] the tapes amen not satisfied with just
[1:33:41] saying amen amen not satisfied just
[1:33:44] knowing what the Bible is but a man that
[1:33:46] is really born again hungers amen for
[1:33:49] the Supernatural and for the Living God
[1:33:52] I will not stop uh amen you understand
[1:33:55] what I'm saying it ain't time to get
[1:33:56] discouraged church when the when the
[1:33:59] storms are there when the when the
[1:34:00] trials are there it's not time to wield
[1:34:03] it's time to hunger God I want to see
[1:34:06] you move if you are Supernatural I know
[1:34:09] you are and I know you're here letting
[1:34:11] you move in my
[1:34:16] situation
[1:34:18] hunger now notice brother brandham also
[1:34:21] said where the Supernatural is
[1:34:23] demonstrated
[1:34:25] there is where the Eagles of God are
[1:34:27] gathered not gathered around the good
[1:34:30] intellectual sermon not gathered around
[1:34:33] a good beautiful choir and professional
[1:34:37] musicians but gathered around where the
[1:34:41] Supernatural is demonstrated because the
[1:34:44] Eagles of God believe in the
[1:34:46] Supernatural amen that's why we don't
[1:34:49] question God we don't limit God because
[1:34:52] we've experienced the super natural if
[1:34:54] you're going to limit God to your
[1:34:55] healing how in the world can you how can
[1:34:57] you do that and not limit God to your
[1:34:59] salvation amen but I don't limit God to
[1:35:02] my salvation I don't limit God to my
[1:35:04] healing I don't limit God to anything I
[1:35:07] ain't going to limit God to my Rapture I
[1:35:09] ain't going to limit God to what he can
[1:35:10] do in me oh he's
[1:35:15] Supernatural Amen brother Ram said
[1:35:18] everything that belongs in the realm of
[1:35:20] Christianity is worked by the
[1:35:22] supernatural the nine fruits of the
[1:35:24] spirit are
[1:35:26] Supernatural if you need love joy peace
[1:35:30] if you need long suffering
[1:35:32] forbearance if you need patience if you
[1:35:34] need what see God is a present help in
[1:35:37] the time of trouble can you say Amen you
[1:35:41] say well what does that mean well you
[1:35:42] see brother Braham said only the elect
[1:35:45] will have that love oh love will only be
[1:35:48] found in the elect a amen that's true
[1:35:51] and this elect is being sorely tried
[1:35:54] amen sorely tried because he's trying to
[1:35:56] take that value away from us amen and
[1:35:59] make us just another statistic out in
[1:36:01] the world Amen but in the time of
[1:36:03] trouble God is present that Supernatural
[1:36:07] power amen can flow through you and give
[1:36:10] you that Divine love give you that
[1:36:12] Divine peace give you that Divine joy to
[1:36:14] where you don't need joy in Hollywood
[1:36:16] you don't need joy in vacation you don't
[1:36:19] need joy in money you don't need Joy you
[1:36:21] could go through the very worst dark
[1:36:23] hour and still have joy because it's
[1:36:26] something that is
[1:36:29] Supernatural brother Brown said every
[1:36:31] Shield of the believer is
[1:36:34] Supernatural prise the Lord so it is
[1:36:37] impossible to understand God the
[1:36:39] supernatural with the natural mind
[1:36:41] brother Braham said you can't explain
[1:36:42] Supernatural things you just have to
[1:36:45] believe
[1:36:46] it they tried for years to explain God
[1:36:49] through the intellectual mind
[1:36:51] intellectual reasoning and what they've
[1:36:54] done through it all at the end of it all
[1:36:56] their conclusion they've just explained
[1:36:57] it away amen and brother Brown said when
[1:37:01] you explain away the supernatural out of
[1:37:03] the Bible you're explaining away the
[1:37:05] very God that you worship can you say
[1:37:07] Amen so see God being a present help in
[1:37:11] the time of trouble you have to believe
[1:37:13] in the Supernatural you have to expect
[1:37:16] the supernatural you have to believe in
[1:37:18] it you have to anticipate it you you
[1:37:21] understand what I'm saying in other
[1:37:23] words don't don't just come to church
[1:37:24] all gloomy and and in the dumps and and
[1:37:27] act like this is you going to be your
[1:37:29] last supper and and you're just going to
[1:37:31] die no no no if you can believe amen
[1:37:34] that God is present amen God has shown
[1:37:37] himself to be present he's proved
[1:37:39] himself in a supernatural way he did not
[1:37:41] leave when a prophet left and he did not
[1:37:44] leave when you entered into your
[1:37:46] trials he's
[1:37:49] God amen
[1:37:51] amen amen
[1:37:54] so we find where there's a supernatural
[1:37:58] god brother Brown said there's going to
[1:38:00] be Supernatural things happening because
[1:38:03] he is
[1:38:04] Supernatural do you believe that sir
[1:38:07] amen so when you explain the
[1:38:09] supernatural out of the Bible you're
[1:38:11] explaining way the very God that you
[1:38:14] claim to worship then you're only
[1:38:16] serving then a god of your imagination
[1:38:20] you cannot be serving a real God
[1:38:22] worshiping a real God
[1:38:23] because he's Supernatural so then you've
[1:38:26] come down and you've you've formed a God
[1:38:29] out of your own form uh imagination well
[1:38:32] and and then that's when you can play
[1:38:34] you you know you you can limit God to
[1:38:36] whatever you want to limit to him well I
[1:38:38] I know I'm going to Rapture amen but I
[1:38:40] just I I I got this trial and I got this
[1:38:43] trouble and I got this and I just don't
[1:38:45] know I just don't and you really believe
[1:38:46] you're going in Rapture right I mean you
[1:38:49] know so God can get you in a Rapture but
[1:38:50] God can't heal you God God you you can't
[1:38:53] take God for everything that he says you
[1:38:56] understand it's because we've taken God
[1:38:58] and we formed an imagination of God it's
[1:39:01] a God that we have formed amen and we
[1:39:04] made our own little god of what we can
[1:39:08] reason and what we can believe and what
[1:39:10] if doctor says we're good then oh go
[1:39:12] glory to God we're good if the doctor
[1:39:14] says we're bad I just don't know you
[1:39:17] understand what I'm saying amen but
[1:39:19] brother brandom said if you really had
[1:39:21] perfect Faith amen and the doctor told
[1:39:23] told you Friday that you were going to
[1:39:25] die M by Monday he said You' laugh in
[1:39:27] that doctor's face why because you
[1:39:30] believe in a supernatural God yes that
[1:39:33] doctor may be telling you the truth
[1:39:35] naturally and and by all scientific
[1:39:38] rights you should be dead by Monday but
[1:39:41] there is a supernatural God that can
[1:39:44] turn the situation around and I choose
[1:39:47] to believe
[1:39:49] it he's a present help so when you serve
[1:39:53] God when people serve God of their own
[1:39:56] imagination then fear comes in worry
[1:39:59] anxiety takes hold you understand and
[1:40:03] this is exactly where the world stands
[1:40:05] today because they have taken God the
[1:40:08] supernatural out of their lives
[1:40:11] therefore they have no experience of the
[1:40:14] supernatural they're walking with their
[1:40:16] the god of their knowledge and their own
[1:40:19] imagination and they've done away with
[1:40:21] the god the real God the Supernatural
[1:40:24] that works can you say Amen but notice
[1:40:27] the prophet said God's church has always
[1:40:29] believed in the Supernatural and it's
[1:40:32] always got a fundamental Church standing
[1:40:34] over here that believes just as
[1:40:36] fundamental as they do but they deny the
[1:40:39] supernatural so there's two churches two
[1:40:42] Spirits one spirit is is controlling the
[1:40:45] fundamental Church they believe just as
[1:40:47] fundamental as this is they believe in a
[1:40:50] Rapture they believe in God they believe
[1:40:52] in this all of these saying that one has
[1:40:54] the supernatural with him and the other
[1:40:57] one has rejected the
[1:41:00] Supernatural and remember the Bible says
[1:41:03] that that the the people would have a
[1:41:05] form of godliness but would deny the
[1:41:07] power thereof can you say Amen in other
[1:41:10] words God would be there as a present
[1:41:12] help but they wouldn't believe in it
[1:41:14] they they they don't go to it they they
[1:41:16] don't accept his help they would rather
[1:41:19] accept some
[1:41:20] politician amen
[1:41:26] you love him I hope this is all right
[1:41:30] helps
[1:41:31] you did you notice that in the days of
[1:41:33] lot the supernatural had come as we had
[1:41:36] said and it was only done to the
[1:41:40] elect
[1:41:43] Abraham and Jesus said as it was in the
[1:41:45] days of lot so shall it be in the
[1:41:47] revealing of the son of
[1:41:49] man where the supernatural would be made
[1:41:51] known only to that elect
[1:41:54] oh yeah there'll be other
[1:41:55] Messengers and they'll be sounding out
[1:41:58] but the real Supernatural would be done
[1:42:01] to that elect and there would be a
[1:42:04] promise God remember manifested himself
[1:42:07] as being a present help in time of
[1:42:10] trouble they could not make that promise
[1:42:13] live they could not fulfill what God
[1:42:16] promised to them but here he is now in
[1:42:19] standing before them and says I'll visit
[1:42:22] you according to the time of life I'll
[1:42:25] visit you and and this is what Sarah
[1:42:27] laughed at cuz here she's old how can I
[1:42:30] have pleasure with my
[1:42:32] Lord can you say
[1:42:34] Amen but there was a God standing
[1:42:40] there you might ask how in the world is
[1:42:42] it going to happen it ain't up for you
[1:42:44] to know just believe it he's here and
[1:42:49] he's a present help in the time of
[1:42:51] trouble can you say Amen
[1:42:54] and and Satan will get you to trying to
[1:42:56] show you all the incidents where it
[1:42:58] failed and all the in where you know and
[1:43:01] and what he don't get get you to
[1:43:03] understand is that maybe there was a
[1:43:04] doubt there was unbelief in that heart
[1:43:06] and and and and and all these things
[1:43:08] it's just like you know there there's
[1:43:10] there's one you know and and the the the
[1:43:12] negative naysayers believe they have
[1:43:14] really something to stand on and that's
[1:43:16] that's someone that was you know healed
[1:43:18] in the meeting and then eventually got
[1:43:20] sick over the same thing or whatever you
[1:43:23] you know and and and what brother
[1:43:24] Brandon actually I think it's in that
[1:43:25] Supernatural amen he was talking about
[1:43:28] it and and a preacher rose up and said
[1:43:30] see that that brandom he's a false
[1:43:31] prophet you know because that that one
[1:43:33] man he got healed and and later on he
[1:43:36] got sick of the same thing you know and
[1:43:38] uh he says you know once God heals he'd
[1:43:41] heal forever you know but see the
[1:43:43] skeptic always thinks they have a
[1:43:44] foundation amen and and and on on their
[1:43:47] arguments and all these things but if
[1:43:49] they would just only look at scriptures
[1:43:53] and brother bradam says that you know
[1:43:55] your healing lasts as long as you
[1:43:56] believe it your salvation lasts as long
[1:43:59] as you can believe it everything lasts
[1:44:01] upon your faith can you say amen and I'm
[1:44:03] going to tell you I believe there's real
[1:44:05] Believers in this building that will
[1:44:07] take God at his word regardless
[1:44:11] amen Jesus Christ no matter how you feel
[1:44:15] no matter where you're going no matter
[1:44:16] what amen God is real can you say amen I
[1:44:21] won't keep you much longer
[1:44:24] but in the Old Testament God was a
[1:44:25] present help to Israel yes sir why
[1:44:28] because Israel was God's chosen Nation
[1:44:30] among the Nations Deuteronomy 7 and6 for
[1:44:35] thou art an holy people unto the Lord
[1:44:37] thy God the Lord thy God hath chosen
[1:44:39] thee to be a special people unto himself
[1:44:42] above all people that are upon the face
[1:44:44] of the Earth the Lord did not set his
[1:44:46] love upon you nor choose you because you
[1:44:48] were more in numbered than any people
[1:44:51] for you were the few fewest of all
[1:44:54] people but because the Lord loved
[1:44:58] you ain't that wonderful amen if he
[1:45:01] would do that for a natural people he
[1:45:02] does that for a spiritual people amen
[1:45:04] it's not because we were Mighty it
[1:45:06] wasn't because we had real strong faith
[1:45:08] and we just had the IQ you know of
[1:45:11] Einstein or whatever it was just simply
[1:45:14] the Lord loved us can you say man and
[1:45:17] the Lord loved you and because he would
[1:45:20] keep the oath which he had sworn unto
[1:45:22] your the your fathers hath the Lord
[1:45:25] brought you out with a mighty hand and
[1:45:27] redeemed you out of the house of bondman
[1:45:30] and from the hand of pharaoh king of
[1:45:33] Egypt know therefore know therefore amen
[1:45:37] he's talking to his elect know therefore
[1:45:40] that the Lord thy God he is God the
[1:45:43] faithful God which keepeth Covenant and
[1:45:46] mercy with him that love him and keep
[1:45:49] his Commandments to a thousand
[1:45:51] Generations
[1:45:53] so not only did God choose Israel that
[1:45:57] Nation for himself amen and set him them
[1:46:02] apart from uh that Nation apart from all
[1:46:05] the other nations amen but he was
[1:46:08] faithful in keeping his Covenant with
[1:46:12] them and mercy to them can you say Amen
[1:46:16] Deuteronomy 4:7 for what nation is there
[1:46:19] so great who hath God so nigh unto thee
[1:46:23] him as the Lord our God is in all things
[1:46:27] that we call upon uh him for isn't that
[1:46:30] a what a question and this is God
[1:46:32] speaking to the to Israel which you good
[1:46:34] no good and well that promise or that
[1:46:36] that scripture is really for us amen see
[1:46:39] what nation what people amen for Peter
[1:46:43] said you are a peculiar people a holy
[1:46:46] nation can you say Amen what nation is
[1:46:49] there so great who have God so NY unto
[1:46:54] them as the Lord our God is in all
[1:46:57] things that we call upon him for and
[1:47:00] what nation is there so great that hath
[1:47:02] statutes and judgments so righteous as
[1:47:04] all this law which I set before you this
[1:47:07] day oh isin't that wonderful it was the
[1:47:10] this nation of Israel that God delivered
[1:47:13] from the hand of the Egyptians it was
[1:47:15] this nation that God had the the the
[1:47:18] angel of of the lord of the Angel of the
[1:47:22] Covenant going before them so see God
[1:47:25] was a present help to them amen uh uh uh
[1:47:30] uh because he had given them a land of
[1:47:33] inheritance he said I give unto you this
[1:47:36] land right it was a land of inheritance
[1:47:39] and so God was a present help to them
[1:47:42] and because he had made an unconditional
[1:47:44] Covenant with Abraham and his seed after
[1:47:47] him ain't that right and so when Israel
[1:47:51] was in Egypt the Bible says says there
[1:47:53] in Exodus 2:24 God heard their
[1:47:58] groaning and God remembered his Covenant
[1:48:01] with Abraham with Isaac and with Jacob
[1:48:04] and God looked upon the children of
[1:48:07] Israel and God had respect unto
[1:48:11] them who a nation that he had called for
[1:48:15] himself a nation that he had given the
[1:48:18] the made a an unconditional Covenant
[1:48:21] with and given them the land of
[1:48:23] inheritance when they begin to call upon
[1:48:26] him God began to hear and God had
[1:48:30] respect unto them not because they
[1:48:33] deserved it but because the Lord loved
[1:48:35] them the two things that the Lord cannot
[1:48:38] do he cannot change you cannot lie amen
[1:48:42] do you believe it in the beginning God
[1:48:44] had made a conditional Covenant with
[1:48:46] Adam and and Adam broke it and and any
[1:48:50] time that God has made a a conditional
[1:48:53] Covenant with man man man always fails
[1:48:57] to keep his part of the bargain ain't
[1:48:59] that right that's that's right so when
[1:49:02] God made a an unconditional Covenant
[1:49:04] with Abraham what what was he doing he
[1:49:07] he left Abraham out of the picture he
[1:49:09] put Abraham to sleep and and while God
[1:49:12] was was uh busy making the deal
[1:49:15] Abraham's asleep so Abraham had nothing
[1:49:17] to do with it just like you have nothing
[1:49:19] to do with the Covenant that God made it
[1:49:21] wasn't you God said I'll do this and you
[1:49:23] said well good I'll do this then you
[1:49:25] know I'll do my part you do your part
[1:49:27] you know no no no we couldn't do it so
[1:49:30] God makes an unconditional Covenant in
[1:49:33] with Abraham and he pledges himself to
[1:49:37] fulfill both sides of the Covenant both
[1:49:41] both parts of the Covenant can you say
[1:49:43] amen that's right so not only did he
[1:49:46] fulfilled his part in Christ amen but
[1:49:50] now he's come amen to fulfill our part
[1:49:55] in
[1:49:57] us he's a present help in the time of
[1:50:01] trouble can you say amen he come in
[1:50:05] Christ to fulfill his
[1:50:09] part but he come in US Amen to fulfill
[1:50:13] our
[1:50:14] part I'm so glad for
[1:50:17] that Christ in you everybody say Christ
[1:50:20] in
[1:50:21] Me God loves Israel and he could not
[1:50:24] change that
[1:50:26] love he made an unconditional Covenant
[1:50:29] with Abraham he could not
[1:50:30] lie throughout the Old Testament we are
[1:50:33] told that God remembered his Covenant
[1:50:37] God remembered his Covenant amen God
[1:50:40] always remembers his Covenant can you
[1:50:43] say Amen this is why God is a present
[1:50:46] help in the time of trouble it's not
[1:50:48] because you deserve it but God
[1:50:50] remembered his Covenant
[1:50:55] can you say Amen even when we don't feel
[1:50:57] worthy enough to pray God remembers his
[1:51:02] Covenant even when we don't feel worthy
[1:51:04] to worship God and to lift our hands God
[1:51:09] remembers his Covenant amen can you say
[1:51:12] Amen now Psalms 105 and8 he hath
[1:51:16] remembered his Covenant forever the word
[1:51:19] which he commanded to a thousand
[1:51:20] Generations which Covenant he made with
[1:51:22] with Abraham and his oath unto Isaac and
[1:51:26] confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law
[1:51:28] and to Israel for an Everlasting
[1:51:30] Covenant saying unto thee will I give
[1:51:32] thee uh give the land of Canaan the lot
[1:51:35] of your inheritance when they were but a
[1:51:38] few in number yay very few and strangers
[1:51:42] in it when they went from one nation to
[1:51:45] another from one Kingdom to another
[1:51:48] people and God suffered no man to do
[1:51:51] them wrong he reproved Kings for their
[1:51:55] sake saying touch not my anointed and do
[1:51:57] my prophets no harm what was it he was a
[1:52:01] present help in the time of
[1:52:05] trouble amen right Exodus 1321 the Lord
[1:52:09] went before them by day in a pillar of a
[1:52:12] cloud to lead them the way and by night
[1:52:15] in a pillar of fire to give them light
[1:52:17] to go by day and night he took not away
[1:52:20] the pillar of the cloud by day day nor
[1:52:23] the pillar of Fire by night from before
[1:52:25] the people and I say that's the same
[1:52:27] thing
[1:52:28] today the prophet may not be here but
[1:52:31] the pillar of fire is still here with
[1:52:33] this
[1:52:35] elect do you believe that amen God help
[1:52:38] us forever believe that and God fought
[1:52:41] their battles for them a natural people
[1:52:44] but a people that he set for himself he
[1:52:46] parted the waters for them he fed them
[1:52:49] he provided for them healed them preser
[1:52:52] their clothes their
[1:52:54] shoes even you know even when the
[1:52:57] children of Israel went into the land of
[1:52:59] Moab remember Balo was jealous of them
[1:53:03] the king and so he hired that false
[1:53:07] prophet balum to go out and curse
[1:53:11] Israel balum he goes out there and he
[1:53:14] opens his mouth to curse God would not
[1:53:18] let him do it God was a present help in
[1:53:24] time of
[1:53:27] trouble I don't even know if Israel knew
[1:53:30] what that Prophet was getting ready to
[1:53:32] do but God was on the
[1:53:35] scene and when balam opened his mouth he
[1:53:39] began to bless
[1:53:41] Israel couldn't curse him amen can you
[1:53:45] say amen and notice Moses reminded
[1:53:48] Israel of this in Deuteronomy 23:5
[1:53:51] saying nevertheless say the Lord thy God
[1:53:54] would not hearken unto
[1:53:57] balum but the Lord thy God turned the
[1:54:00] curse into a blessing unto thee because
[1:54:04] the Lord thy God loved
[1:54:09] thee do you feel his love today I hope
[1:54:13] you
[1:54:14] do I love he was a present help in time
[1:54:19] of trouble if you notice when it come to
[1:54:21] the fundamental heart balum and B
[1:54:24] brother brandham shows
[1:54:26] us that they could be identified with
[1:54:29] Moses they had the same form of worship
[1:54:32] as Moses did seven altars seven Rams
[1:54:34] seven Bullocks and yada yada but brother
[1:54:38] Bram said but you see Moses being the
[1:54:40] correct prophet of God not only had the
[1:54:43] fundamental
[1:54:44] Parts but had the identification of God
[1:54:48] yeah he was in the line of duty exactly
[1:54:51] what was promised for that age not for
[1:54:54] the age of Noah but for the age then I
[1:54:57] will take you to a land that's flowing
[1:54:59] with milk and honey and they were on
[1:55:02] their
[1:55:04] way Bao and balam had no promise of such
[1:55:09] but God had given that to that Nation
[1:55:11] Israel and God was a present help to
[1:55:13] them in time of trouble no man could lay
[1:55:16] a curse to them and the world is trying
[1:55:18] to curse natural Israel today and God
[1:55:22] will will not let it
[1:55:26] happen if God will not let it happen to
[1:55:29] a natural people what do you think about
[1:55:30] a spiritual
[1:55:32] people his
[1:55:34] bride that Nation Israel is not bride
[1:55:37] they're
[1:55:39] servants what a prophet said Israel's
[1:55:42] always servant but he promised to get a
[1:55:45] bride flesh of his flesh bone of his
[1:55:48] bone power of his power life of his life
[1:55:51] out of the Gent
[1:55:54] Iles that's
[1:55:57] good so Israel was identified the
[1:55:59] prophet said with their Prophet Moses
[1:56:02] with the message of that age the
[1:56:05] characteristics of God was identified in
[1:56:07] Moses the pillar of fire was following
[1:56:09] him and he also had the atonement in
[1:56:13] action showing that the supernatural God
[1:56:16] was with them he had the atonement in
[1:56:19] action so he says he wasn't just talking
[1:56:21] about it of what will be but what is
[1:56:24] right
[1:56:25] now hello we're not just talking about
[1:56:29] what God done 50 years ago we're talking
[1:56:31] about what he's doing right now
[1:56:35] amen can you say amen and Moses had a
[1:56:39] brass
[1:56:40] serpent I'm going to let you go in a
[1:56:42] minute but he had this brass serpent
[1:56:45] hanging on a pole right lifted up the
[1:56:49] prophet said for the diseases and
[1:56:51] sickness of the people therefore Moses
[1:56:55] was practicing Divine
[1:56:57] Healing he did not have a Red Cross he
[1:57:00] did not have doctors and on hospitals
[1:57:03] that's not what he was called to do the
[1:57:07] church is not called to build hospitals
[1:57:09] and seminaries and all of these things
[1:57:11] the church is to cast out
[1:57:15] demons lay hands on the sick and they
[1:57:18] shall
[1:57:19] recover the church has greater power
[1:57:22] than even a doctor
[1:57:27] does true why Supernatural God's with
[1:57:32] us amen amen can you say Amen so
[1:57:36] therefore Moses had the atonement in
[1:57:39] action for he was practicing Divine
[1:57:41] Healing
[1:57:43] amen according to numbers 216 the Lord
[1:57:47] sent fiery serpents among the people and
[1:57:50] they bit the people now why why would
[1:57:52] God do that a good God as he is people
[1:57:56] don't want to look at God as being a
[1:57:58] just God because the people were
[1:58:00] murmuring and complaining against his
[1:58:02] Prophet
[1:58:03] Moses they were un UN in unbelief they
[1:58:07] they they couldn't take what Moses was
[1:58:09] trying to tell them they wouldn't they
[1:58:10] accept it they would accept everybody
[1:58:12] else but not
[1:58:14] Moses anybody that wasn't even
[1:58:16] Vindicated of God anybody that just had
[1:58:18] rose up and just had their own little
[1:58:19] message they they just follow after
[1:58:23] them but when it come to a real prophet
[1:58:25] of God they murmured and
[1:58:27] complained ain't that right and so the
[1:58:31] Lord sent fiery serpents among the
[1:58:32] people and they bit the people and much
[1:58:35] people of Israel died therefore the
[1:58:37] people came to Moses notice the humility
[1:58:40] now and said we have sinned for we have
[1:58:43] spoken against the Lord and against thee
[1:58:45] pray un to the Lord that he take away
[1:58:47] the serpents from us and Moses prayed
[1:58:50] for the people and what do we find out
[1:58:53] the Lord was a present help in the time
[1:58:55] of trouble can you say Amen it wasn't
[1:58:58] Moses idea Amen to start practicing
[1:59:01] right then Divine Healing amen that was
[1:59:04] God's idea it was God's idea for him to
[1:59:07] set up a pole and put a breath serpent
[1:59:09] showing that every sin was already
[1:59:12] judged representing Christ to come can
[1:59:14] you say Amen see so brother Braham said
[1:59:17] Moses had the atonement see the brace
[1:59:20] the brass serpent simp symbolizing that
[1:59:23] God was in the camp amen amen amen can
[1:59:27] you say Amen now notice I want you to
[1:59:31] see here that that serpent was made of a
[1:59:33] natural material but notice what a
[1:59:35] prophet said but that piece of brass
[1:59:37] hanging on a pole was God's gift of
[1:59:40] healing to the people the brass did not
[1:59:43] have healing power in it but God he says
[1:59:47] put his gift of healing upon that surf
[1:59:50] serpent see so God is always sending the
[1:59:53] supernatural down upon on the natural
[1:59:57] can you say amen and and and and as we
[1:59:59] get I could go more and more that God
[2:00:02] has made a way not just to condens send
[2:00:05] upon a serpent not just to condescend
[2:00:08] upon natural Waters that God has made a
[2:00:11] way that he can all condescend and live
[2:00:15] in a
[2:00:16] people to show himself present not on a
[2:00:20] serpent not in a body
[2:00:22] of natural water but in a group of
[2:00:26] people God is showing himself
[2:00:30] real how many believes that God come
[2:00:33] upon prophets he moved up them prophets
[2:00:36] and the prophet said that that the
[2:00:37] prophets of old the Old Testament had a
[2:00:40] portion of God just a portion a portion
[2:00:42] the spirit of God would fall upon the
[2:00:44] natural the supernatural falling upon
[2:00:46] the natural because the word of God come
[2:00:48] to the prophets and God would show
[2:00:50] himself to be among the People by a
[2:00:53] prophet then he come in fullness in
[2:00:57] Jesus
[2:01:00] Christ now we know that Christ con he he
[2:01:04] ascended sent his Spirit there the day
[2:01:07] of
[2:01:08] Pentecost but never has it been in
[2:01:11] fullness as it is in this
[2:01:14] age the fullness of God is here again
[2:01:18] amen not in one
[2:01:20] man in a people amen called The Bride
[2:01:25] aren't you glad for that can you lift
[2:01:27] your hands unto the Lord and thank him
[2:01:29] for that we've got so much to thank God
[2:01:32] for he is a present help in the time of
[2:01:36] trouble God by this message has showed
[2:01:39] himself to be
[2:01:41] present for us in this age and now by
[2:01:46] the word us believing the word the
[2:01:49] prophet said when you believe God the
[2:01:50] word you're receiving God into your
[2:01:52] heart you receive the word you receive
[2:01:54] God into your heart and as the word
[2:01:56] grows God begins to grow the fullness of
[2:01:58] the word begins alive the fullness of
[2:02:01] God begins to come alive and become real
[2:02:03] you're not just God's not just a God to
[2:02:05] you in the healing part he's a God to
[2:02:08] you in the in the Salvation he's a God
[2:02:10] to you in Deliverance he's a God to you
[2:02:13] in providing he's a God to you in every
[2:02:16] aspect of your life I am so glad for
[2:02:19] that aren't you glad for that you know
[2:02:21] the thing of it brother Brown said the
[2:02:23] reason why people can't believe in uh
[2:02:25] the Supernatural is because they've been
[2:02:26] taught against it I am so glad that God
[2:02:30] sent a prophet and he would stand behind
[2:02:32] a Pulpit whether all these Skeptics
[2:02:34] behind him or Skeptics out there he
[2:02:37] would still declare that the
[2:02:38] supernatural God power of God is here
[2:02:41] it's real it's strong to where it would
[2:02:43] take all skepticism and unbelief out of
[2:02:47] our hearts to where we could accept the
[2:02:49] Mighty God that is present in time of
[2:02:52] trouble if the musicians will come God
[2:02:56] bless you I love the
[2:02:59] Lord I love him with all of my
[2:03:02] heart great he is amen amen amen don't

[2:04:53] bless the name of the
[2:04:55] Lord what
[2:04:57] song here he is

[2:05:12] here oh I Will
[2:05:16] Bless do you have it within you to bless
[2:05:19] his name
[2:05:22] Glory Glory Glory Glory
[2:05:26] [Music]
[2:05:33] Glory he is
[2:05:39] [Music]
[2:05:41] here you will never
[2:05:45] be I I'm going to read this it's going
[2:05:49] to be be a little lengthy but just place
[2:05:52] softly that song he is
[2:05:55] here in 2 Chronicles 20 and
[2:06:00] 23 it tells us that the children of Moab
[2:06:03] and the children of
[2:06:05] Amon and others came against Jehoshaphat
[2:06:09] to war against
[2:06:10] them and the 23rd verse it says the
[2:06:13] children of Amon and Moab stood up up
[2:06:16] against the inhabitants of Mount seir
[2:06:19] utterly to slay and Destroy them that
[2:06:22] was the intent of the enemy to wipe them
[2:06:25] from the face of the
[2:06:26] [Music]
[2:06:27] Earth and if you notice that when
[2:06:29] Jehoshaphat he heard that there was a
[2:06:32] great multitude coming against him he
[2:06:36] feared and he set himself to seek the
[2:06:40] Lord amen now I think that's where we
[2:06:43] ought to come to when trouble is
[2:06:49] coming you ought to sit down
[2:06:52] you ought to determine to seek the Lord
[2:06:54] set yourself to seek the Lord God the
[2:06:59] enemy is determined to destroy me
[2:07:01] determined to destroy my family it's
[2:07:04] determined to destroy my spouse my
[2:07:07] children it's
[2:07:09] determined that God your word
[2:07:12] said now I can't handle it I can't do it
[2:07:15] it's too Beyond me so this is what
[2:07:17] Jehoshaphat done he determined to set
[2:07:20] the Lord and so see instead of letting
[2:07:23] fear take a hold and letting anxiety
[2:07:25] dictate him
[2:07:28] see he set himself to seek the Lord
[2:07:31] until he could find that Blessed
[2:07:32] Assurance in his
[2:07:34] heart then the fourth verse Chronicles
[2:07:37] there uh uh
[2:07:39] 20 he said and Judah gathered themselves
[2:07:42] together to ask help of the Lord even
[2:07:45] out of all the cities of Judah they came
[2:07:48] to seek the Lord and Jehoshaphat stood
[2:07:51] in the congregation of Judah and
[2:07:53] Jerusalem in the house of the Lord
[2:07:55] before the new court and said oh Lord
[2:07:58] God of our fathers are not thou God in
[2:08:01] heaven and rulest not thou over all the
[2:08:03] kingdoms of the Heathen see
[2:08:05] acknowledging God yeah and in thine hand
[2:08:09] is there not power and might so that
[2:08:11] none is able to withstand thee art thou
[2:08:15] not are not thou Our God who didst drive
[2:08:18] out the inhabitants of this land before
[2:08:20] thy People Israel and gave it to the
[2:08:22] Seed of Abraham thy friend forever and
[2:08:25] they dwelt therein and have built thee a
[2:08:27] sanctuary therein for thy name saying if
[2:08:30] when evil cometh upon us as the sword
[2:08:33] judgment or pestilence or famine we
[2:08:36] stand before this house and in thy
[2:08:37] presence for thy name is in this house
[2:08:40] and cry unto thee in our Affliction then
[2:08:42] thou will hear and help now behold the
[2:08:46] children of Aon and Moab and mount seir
[2:08:49] uh uh whom thou wouldest not let Israel
[2:08:52] invade when they came out of the land of
[2:08:54] Egypt but they've turned from them and
[2:08:57] destroyed them not behold I say how they
[2:09:00] reward us see to come to cast us out of
[2:09:03] thy
[2:09:04] possession which thou Hast given us to
[2:09:07] inheritance see oh Our God wilt thou not
[2:09:11] judge them for we have no might against
[2:09:14] this great company that cometh against
[2:09:17] us neither know we what to do but our
[2:09:20] eyes are upon
[2:09:23] thee then if you go to the 15th
[2:09:26] verse it tells us that the spirit of the
[2:09:28] Lord Came Upon jahaziel I don't know if
[2:09:31] that's the right
[2:09:33] pronunciation and he said hearken ye all
[2:09:36] Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem
[2:09:39] and Thou King Jehoshaphat thus say the
[2:09:41] Lord unto you be Not Afraid nor dismay
[2:09:45] by reason of this great multitude for
[2:09:47] the battle is not yours but it's God's
[2:09:50] amen you go down to the 17th verse God's
[2:09:54] still speaking you shall not need to
[2:09:56] fight this in this battle set yourselves
[2:09:59] stand ye still and see the salvation of
[2:10:01] the Lord with you oh Judah and Jerusalem
[2:10:05] fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out
[2:10:08] against them for the Lord will be with
[2:10:10] you notice notice when it's really
[2:10:14] Revelation struck
[2:10:16] Jehoshaphat and Jehoshaphat bowed his
[2:10:19] head with his face to the ground ground
[2:10:21] in all Judah and the inhabitants of
[2:10:24] Jerusalem fell before the Lord
[2:10:26] worshiping the
[2:10:28] Lord church I think it's time we worship
[2:10:32] the
[2:10:33] Lord he's present with us he's already
[2:10:36] told us we can't fail he's already told
[2:10:40] us no weapon formed against us is going
[2:10:42] to prosper is not this King lamb worship
[2:10:48] time is that not what brother brandham
[2:10:50] said that when the seals was open and
[2:10:52] the lamb showed himself to be the mighty
[2:10:55] conqueror showed himself to be worthy
[2:10:58] opened the book of redemption loosening
[2:11:00] the seals and John began to worship All
[2:11:03] Creatures began to worship and brother
[2:11:05] Bram said it was King lamb worship it
[2:11:08] was time for King lamb worship get out
[2:11:11] of your grumbles get out of your doubt
[2:11:13] get out of your fear look what the lamb
[2:11:16] has done for us he showed himself to be
[2:11:19] with us it's time for
[2:11:23] worship do you believe
[2:11:26] that yes sir he's redeemed us and notice
[2:11:29] that 20th verse and they Rose early in
[2:11:32] the morning and went forth Into the
[2:11:34] Wilderness of uh
[2:11:36] teoa and as they went forth Jehoshaphat
[2:11:39] stood and said hear me oh jeru Judah and
[2:11:42] ye inhabitants of Jerusalem believe in
[2:11:45] the Lord your God so shall ye be
[2:11:47] established believe His prophets so
[2:11:50] shall ye prosper Prosper don't you let
[2:11:53] any spirit unbelieving Spirit take you
[2:11:55] from this message and when he had
[2:11:58] consulted with the people he appointed
[2:12:00] singers unto the Lord that and that
[2:12:02] should praise with the beauty of
[2:12:04] Holiness as they went out before the
[2:12:07] Army and to say praise the Lord for his

[2:12:13] worshiping God start praising start
[2:12:17] thanking God for the Victory and when
[2:12:20] they began to sing and to praise the
[2:12:23] Lord said ambushments in other words the
[2:12:26] Supernatural come on the scene and the
[2:12:29] Lord set ambushments against the
[2:12:31] children of Amon Moab and mount seir
[2:12:34] which were come against Judah and they
[2:12:36] were smitten can you say Amen 24th verse
[2:12:39] and when Judah came toward the
[2:12:41] Watchtower in the wilderness they looked
[2:12:43] unto the multitude and behold there were
[2:12:46] dead they were dead bodies Fallen to the
[2:12:48] Earth and none escaped Hallelujah can
