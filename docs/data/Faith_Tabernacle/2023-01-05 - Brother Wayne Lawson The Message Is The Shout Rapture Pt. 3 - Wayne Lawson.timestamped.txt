[52:07] sometimes we spend a few days overseas
[52:10] and you know I don't know sometimes
[52:11] maybe first time I went I went almost a
[52:14] month and I figured out that's not good
[52:16] for a married man with a family you know
[52:18] you maybe we can cut her down to about
[52:20] 10 15 at the most you know and but when
[52:23] you when you're on about the 13th day
[52:26] and you've got 15 and you're walking
[52:28] into that Sunday morning and and you
[52:31] know that Sunday night that you're going
[52:33] to pack your bags and you're off to the
[52:35] plane you got a different attitude
[52:38] you don't really care what they're doing
[52:41] or what everybody's thinking or there's
[52:44] they're making plans for next week and
[52:46] you walk right by their conversations
[52:49] and you'd only get included because you
[52:50] ain't going to be there you you know and
[52:52] I feel that way a little bit about this
[52:54] whole world you know they got a lot
[52:56] going on out here and there's a lot of
[52:58] things happening but it really doesn't
[53:00] uh it doesn't pertain to me because just

[53:06] this bride and we're going to be gone

[53:58] Daryl and amen I I counted such an honor
[54:01] uh preaching these kind of meetings and
[54:05] and just just centering on the very
[54:07] message of this hour and putting our
[54:09] Hearts here and our focus and and our

[54:39] for it amen and we want to tonight just
[54:42] before we take a scripture reading we'll
[54:44] bow our hearts together
[54:46] and let's just pray father it is an
[54:49] honor to stand in this place tonight and
[54:52] these men of God that have gathered here
[54:54] and these Saints Lord that have gathered
[54:56] around them Lord they have brought their
[54:59] confidence Lord
[55:01] they come to put their shoulder against
[55:03] the wheel
[55:04] the people of God come into feed and to
[55:08] Lord to feel the presence of God while
[55:11] they hear the word of God
[55:13] and Lord Jesus I pray tonight
[55:16] you take a hold of me Lord you would use
[55:19] me for your glory and your honor and
[55:22] Lord if if there be something to be

[55:27] give us a Divine leadership here in this
[55:29] meeting Lord and fathers we have our
[55:31] heart on Rapture we're centered here
[55:33] we're asking you to deal with us now
[55:35] lead us in this way we ask you father in
[55:38] Jesus name amen and amen and God bless
[55:42] you as you could be seated tonight
[55:45] I want to talk to you a little bit again
[55:48] about you can be civilia I want to talk
[55:50] to you again if we could uh from the
[55:53] message of course this is the third part
[55:55] on the Rapture subtitle I want to preach
[55:57] to you on the message is the shout the
[56:01] message is the shout now there will be a
[56:04] few of these things that is very
[56:06] familiar to you and you've heard them
[56:07] preached a lot of times but the
[56:10] revelation of the Rapture hasn't changed
[56:12] uh since the prophet spoke it now it has
[56:16] become clearer and we've been able to
[56:18] identify things maybe a little clearer
[56:21] since of the the times that was first
[56:23] spoken uh as it was brother Branham said
[56:26] things it was so far I didn't read the
[56:29] scripture that's what you were talking
[56:30] about amen I I didn't sorry I got our
[56:33] own conversation going on there uh I
[56:36] didn't uh I didn't
[56:39] uh things that was probably light years
[56:42] uh a way that a prophet spoke those
[56:46] things and then you know we're finally
[56:49] coming into them and uh and we we thank
[56:51] God for him I've already had you seated
[56:53] is it okay if I just read this to you
[56:55] we've been coming from first
[56:56] Thessalonians 4 and the Lord himself
[56:59] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[57:01] and with the voice of the Archangel and
[57:03] with the Trump of God and the dead in
[57:06] Christ shall rise first then we which
[57:09] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[57:11] together with them in the clouds to meet
[57:13] the Lord in the air and so shall we ever
[57:16] be with the Lord and so shall we ever be
[57:20] with the Lord and I I just want to take
[57:22] this for a moment on the subject of the
[57:24] Rapture of course we've been defining it
[57:27] as a seizure or a capturing or a
[57:30] kidnapping which is completely different
[57:32] than most people look at the Rapture
[57:34] most people are thinking about how they
[57:36] work themselves into it and but what the
[57:39] Prophet preached to us is that it
[57:41] captures you it's something that came
[57:44] for you amen and and because you are a
[57:47] seed God has something for you and I and
[57:49] and uh as brother Brandon will begin
[57:51] this uh he he's talking to the
[57:53] Christians businessman of course brother
[57:56] Bradham uh is speaking to people that
[57:58] has a lot of a lot of opinions on what
[58:01] the Rapture is they've got thoughts and
[58:03] feelings and and they've got thoughts on
[58:05] what the Rapture is and uh it's amazing
[58:09] to me because he actually starts it by
[58:11] saying I'm going to take a different
[58:13] avenue he said now uh but how many in
[58:16] here believes the Bible teaches there
[58:17] will be a Rapture now he's actually
[58:20] talking to people that believes in
[58:21] Rapture but they don't believe in the
[58:23] Rapture the way he does and he says I'm
[58:26] going to take a different avenue well
[58:28] how could he have not taken a different
[58:31] avenue these men have taken every Avenue
[58:34] that every person down Through the Ages
[58:36] had took and they had taught things in a
[58:39] certain way way but nobody's sitting
[58:41] there knew that the message was the
[58:44] shout nobody nobody that was listening
[58:46] to him even had a clue that they were
[58:48] listening to the messenger of the
[58:50] Rapture speaking to them and he was
[58:53] taking a different Avenue and I I
[58:55] personally believe that that was the
[58:57] Avenue a man that Enoch took amen I
[59:00] believe that's the right Avenue that's
[59:01] the one the church wants to be on right
[59:04] we want to get on the path amen the
[59:06] Avenue William Branham was talking about
[59:08] and as we said it last night it wasn't
[59:10] opened amen until a certain season and
[59:13] then when that season came there was an
[59:15] opening for it now brother Bradham says
[59:17] you're not a blind people you're a
[59:19] responsible people a sensible people and
[59:22] he said if I stood here and I said these
[59:24] things for a Prejudice he said I don't I
[59:27] say it because it's life and because I'm
[59:29] responsible to God for saying it and I
[59:32] must say it and and my message and
[59:34] knowing all the time back there it's got
[59:36] to come forth knowing the message would
[59:38] come forth here it as them Seven Seals
[59:40] have been opened the Mysteries showing
[59:42] things that has happened he said I
[59:44] didn't know it of course he's saying
[59:47] that he's not saying it for prejudice
[59:49] now he was saying it for need and we'll
[59:51] get to this a little bit but he was
[59:53] saying it because it's what it needed to
[59:55] be spoken he he wasn't even saying it
[59:57] because he thought it would just please
[59:58] the people or it would say something
[1:00:00] good but he knowed that the bride needed
[1:00:04] this word spoken and he couldn't speak
[1:00:07] it without Crossing up other ideas
[1:00:09] because those men had already spoke
[1:00:12] those things and it was not necessary
[1:00:14] for them to speak it but they had spoken
[1:00:16] and they built denominations upon it and
[1:00:19] he was listening to disagree with all of
[1:00:21] them and he was trying to get he was
[1:00:22] trying to let him know it's not that I
[1:00:24] don't like brother Smith or not that I
[1:00:26] don't like Martin Luther or I don't like
[1:00:28] John Wesley they did their job and he
[1:00:31] elevated them as messengers of the ages
[1:00:34] he said but see if they would have lived
[1:00:36] long enough they'd be here where we are
[1:00:38] tonight payment because it wasn't opened
[1:00:41] in that time is the reason they didn't
[1:00:43] preach it that way but but they got
[1:00:45] lutherans today who are saying well
[1:00:47] Martin Luther didn't believe it like
[1:00:49] that but if Martin Luther was here
[1:00:50] Martin Luther would believe it like that
[1:00:52] amen because he preached the current
[1:00:54] revelation of the age he lived him and I
[1:00:57] believe today that's exactly where the
[1:00:59] bride of Christ is standing and some of
[1:01:01] the things we preach may sound
[1:01:03] prejudiced to other people or other
[1:01:05] denominations or other ways of believing
[1:01:08] but we're really not being prejudiced to
[1:01:10] them we don't I don't at least I'm not
[1:01:12] I'm not being prejudiced to the ideas of
[1:01:14] men but we must preach this rapture we
[1:01:18] must preach this Rapture somebody said
[1:01:19] well preacher why are we going to preach
[1:01:21] Paul said we must Comfort one another
[1:01:23] with these words come on we got to
[1:01:25] preach this Rapture y'all know amen
[1:01:27] y'all know Divine Healing is something
[1:01:30] that was done 2 000 years ago Divine
[1:01:32] Healing brother bam said it on the table
[1:01:34] of gold he said Jesus couldn't heal you
[1:01:37] if he was here in the building tonight
[1:01:39] he said healing was already paid for at
[1:01:41] Calvary and the only way you excess it
[1:01:44] is by the preaching of the word it
[1:01:46] builds faith and Faith translates into
[1:01:49] healing but the fountain come on now I'm
[1:01:51] talking about Divine Healing preaching
[1:01:53] amen if I if you want salvation the
[1:01:56] blood's already been given for it and a
[1:01:58] man preaches salvation by the word amen
[1:02:01] somebody put a a sin a quote a bit ago
[1:02:03] and they said you know the thing about
[1:02:04] this is the preaching of the word is the
[1:02:06] casting out of demons it's not you're
[1:02:08] not saving a person by the words you're
[1:02:10] saying you're casting a demon aways from
[1:02:13] somebody so they can believe the word
[1:02:15] and when they believe the word they're
[1:02:17] saved now now come on church I'm saying
[1:02:19] there's salvation faith and there's
[1:02:21] healing Faith but there is rapturing
[1:02:24] Faith and the bride must hear rapturing
[1:02:27] preaching to bring a rapturing faith
[1:02:29] somebody said well all he wants to
[1:02:31] preach on is the rapture you betcha
[1:02:32] that's all I want to preach on because
[1:02:34] it's the revelation of the age I'm
[1:02:37] living on and I pray that God put the
[1:02:39] Rapture Revelation in the church and
[1:02:41] bring Faith up to the place where it's
[1:02:43] at it's not that it's not available amen
[1:02:46] it's not that it's not available it's
[1:02:48] here amen but we must preach it and and
[1:02:51] and and as I said other times of course
[1:02:53] other men are called for other things
[1:02:55] and I'm not against other men who are
[1:02:57] called for other things but I've been
[1:02:59] called for this this is the calling on
[1:03:01] my life this is what draws me when I
[1:03:04] look at the scripture when I think about
[1:03:06] the people this is where it brings me
[1:03:08] now other men it takes some other places
[1:03:10] but this is it's this is where my heart
[1:03:13] is this is my life God put it on our
[1:03:15] heart to do these things now the prophet
[1:03:18] of God said of course amen that this is
[1:03:20] not for prejudice it's for need amen and
[1:03:24] and and the prophet of God said of
[1:03:26] course he said if there's if there's not
[1:03:28] a Rapture where are we at
[1:03:31] come on y'all y'all looking at the news
[1:03:34] and the situations that's going on and
[1:03:36] the problems that are everywhere you you
[1:03:39] start trying to fix it and you'll think
[1:03:40] well if we could fix it like this and
[1:03:43] and you go to the school teacher and she
[1:03:45] said well if we could just get it fixed
[1:03:46] we could get it fixed but we can't fix
[1:03:48] it at the school because we got to fix
[1:03:50] it at home and then and then if you go
[1:03:52] to the homes they can't fix it because
[1:03:54] the homes are they don't have any
[1:03:55] foundation the half the fathers are not
[1:03:58] even staying and raising children and
[1:04:00] the mothers are not staying and they're
[1:04:01] going amen half of your generation was
[1:04:03] raised by grandparents amen because that
[1:04:06] people there's no foundations to any of
[1:04:09] it you you can't where you're going to
[1:04:11] how far are you going to go back because
[1:04:13] if you go back to the families then you
[1:04:14] got to say well we need a good church
[1:04:16] and then you go back to the church and
[1:04:18] the in the organization is undermined
[1:04:21] the premisary and and so so it's all
[1:04:23] gone folks it's a it's empty it has
[1:04:26] nothing behind it amen that's why God
[1:04:28] gave us a Rapture as a way of Escape he
[1:04:32] said with every Temptation there is a
[1:04:35] way of escape and I believe tonight that
[1:04:38] God gave this bride a way of escape and
[1:04:40] matter of fact he said God would bring
[1:04:42] an escape upon the church and it's for
[1:04:44] the bride of Christ
[1:04:47] the man's okay if I get rid of this
[1:04:48] jacket amen is for the bride of Christ
[1:04:52] amen now what are we speaking about amen
[1:04:55] we're talking about the the who is for
[1:04:58] it's for brother bam said now this
[1:05:00] Rapture is for the bride and then he
[1:05:02] says it's only one that's going to be in
[1:05:04] the Rapture nothing but the right the
[1:05:07] elected ones the foreknown of God from
[1:05:09] the father's spiritual genes now that's
[1:05:12] powerful stuff friends the father's
[1:05:15] spiritual genes amen and then it makes
[1:05:18] kidnapping clear don't it amen it's not
[1:05:21] him taking somebody else's kid he's just
[1:05:24] taken his own son before the fire falls
[1:05:27] amen he's got every right to pick his
[1:05:29] little boy up and say all right we're
[1:05:31] getting you out of here and he said well
[1:05:33] I want no you ain't staying we're
[1:05:34] getting you out of here judgment is
[1:05:36] coming it's a kidnapping or a seizing
[1:05:38] but it's his own child that he's taken
[1:05:41] come on you're not the Son of Perdition
[1:05:43] you're not the daughter of Perdition
[1:05:45] you're the Sons and Daughters of
[1:05:47] almighty God and God sent a Vindicated
[1:05:51] Prophet to tell you so oh come on church
[1:05:54] amen this message didn't come to condemn
[1:05:57] you it come to redeem you
[1:05:59] now in the leadership powerful sermon in
[1:06:02] leadership brother Branham actually says
[1:06:04] this your physical contacts the physical
[1:06:06] your spiritual contacts the spiritual
[1:06:09] but inside of you you've got a soul and
[1:06:13] that soul is the gene that come from God
[1:06:17] ooh brother amen amen there's three
[1:06:20] levels to a man and that third level to
[1:06:23] a Believer to a redeemable child of God
[1:06:25] the soul is the gene that came from God
[1:06:29] Amen the prophet of God modern events
[1:06:31] paragraph 172 the real ordained of God
[1:06:34] the real Gene that real germ is a soul
[1:06:37] of God that was in God before the
[1:06:39] foundation of the world you amen that's
[1:06:43] really got the spirit of God tonight you
[1:06:45] were in Christ because he was the
[1:06:47] fullness of the word he was the fullness
[1:06:48] of the godhead bodily amen and skipping
[1:06:51] here a little bit then if you were the
[1:06:53] gene a gene a word an attribute from the
[1:06:55] beginning then you walked with him here
[1:06:57] upon the earth now somebody said well
[1:07:00] brother Wayne when did we get the seed
[1:07:02] let me say what the prophet said God
[1:07:03] who's rich in Mercy he said when that
[1:07:06] little baby is born into the world
[1:07:07] there's something in that baby if he's
[1:07:10] ever going to have life there's
[1:07:12] something in there in that child he said
[1:07:14] he'll come sooner or later that little
[1:07:17] seed is in him and the scriptures
[1:07:20] plainly declare it
[1:07:22] again God rich and mercy one day you
[1:07:24] being a part of god you being a part of
[1:07:26] the word you when you heard the words
[1:07:28] you knew you where you come from you
[1:07:31] know that was the truth you always you
[1:07:35] were always the seed was in you and then
[1:07:39] the word sing the word now watch that
[1:07:42] the word sing the word amen he was
[1:07:45] telling you you were the word when you
[1:07:47] come into this Earth amen and he sent A
[1:07:50] Spoken Word by a prophet into this Earth
[1:07:52] and when the word meets the word amen
[1:07:55] there's a reaction is that right that
[1:07:57] you were the word and this is the word
[1:07:59] and it comes together amen just like a
[1:08:02] husband and a wife just like a father
[1:08:04] and a son just like a eagle and a baby
[1:08:06] eagle it's word coming to word that's
[1:08:09] right you always were amen somebody said
[1:08:11] well brother Wayne Amen I got I got I I
[1:08:14] come to a new birth down in the
[1:08:16] Pentecostal church and so how in the
[1:08:18] world could I be listen there's a great
[1:08:20] secretly in here the prophet told us
[1:08:22] it's about atmosphere and he said if you
[1:08:24] were a seed you always were a seed he
[1:08:27] said and let me tell you this you can
[1:08:28] take a seed he said you can take a duck
[1:08:31] egg you can take a chicken egg amen or
[1:08:33] an eagle egg and put it under a chicken
[1:08:34] and hatch it and brother bam actually
[1:08:36] said it happened one time he said they
[1:08:38] took a duck egg and put it under a
[1:08:40] chicken he said and they hatched it amen
[1:08:42] that means that somebody could be
[1:08:44] hatched in the wrong place they can be
[1:08:46] hatched amen they will understand some
[1:08:48] old teacher amen got all um everything
[1:08:51] all messed up payment amen but if you
[1:08:53] get it in the right atmosphere and if
[1:08:55] there's a seed of God in that heart
[1:08:57] it'll come to life brother amen but if
[1:09:00] it comes to life and it's enough to
[1:09:01] begin with it'll be an ugly duck as long
[1:09:04] as it lives in the chicken yard amen
[1:09:06] it'll be there in a wonder why it don't
[1:09:09] think like others think oh they don't
[1:09:10] feel like others feel but brother mom
[1:09:12] said one day there's a duck born in that
[1:09:14] chicken yard y'all know the story he
[1:09:16] said he'd come around the barn he said
[1:09:18] he got a sin of that water and straight
[1:09:20] to the water he went then he could
[1:09:22] understand his bill then he could
[1:09:24] understand his web feet he probably he
[1:09:27] probably wanted feet like everybody else
[1:09:29] but all of a sudden he realized he was
[1:09:32] born different and he was always going
[1:09:34] to be different he just needed to get in
[1:09:36] the right place with the right people
[1:09:38] Old Church of the Living God when I came
[1:09:41] to this message I found my kind of
[1:09:44] people I found shouting people I found
[1:09:46] believing people I found Holy Ghost
[1:09:49] people and this generation that we're
[1:09:51] living in you call me a duck if you want
[1:09:53] to but brother I got a sin of the water
[1:09:55] amen and ain't nothing
[1:09:58] glory to God Amen that old took off
[1:10:01] running brother bam said he jumped
[1:10:02] jumped in the in the pond and there it
[1:10:04] went to swimming
[1:10:06] come on I think it's powerful brother
[1:10:08] you know what he said he said brother
[1:10:09] bam said we used to have an old swimming
[1:10:11] hole he said I'd run down there and jump
[1:10:13] in that old swimming hole you remember
[1:10:14] it he said we talked about he said you
[1:10:16] never knew what the water was going to
[1:10:17] be like he said so I said I had one pen
[1:10:20] in my overalls just had one pen he said
[1:10:22] he said I had a little little nail
[1:10:24] hanging there he said the rest of them
[1:10:26] had to stop and take her and deal with
[1:10:28] her clothes he said but not me he said
[1:10:30] I'd be running I'd pull that pen he said
[1:10:32] I'd walk right out of them overhauls he
[1:10:34] said and jump into that pond he said if
[1:10:36] it was good he said you'd turn back and
[1:10:38] say it's good come on in boys I'll tell
[1:10:41] you what the prophet got in the water
[1:10:42] before you and me amen but I tell you
[1:10:45] what he did he went back and way back at
[1:10:47] the church and said it's good Waters
[1:10:49] come on in church come on in I'll tell
[1:10:53] you something tonight amen some of us
[1:10:55] has been in the waters of life and I
[1:10:57] think we ought to be able to wave into
[1:10:58] the church tonight and say the water's
[1:11:00] good come on in amen when's the last
[1:11:03] time that you got to swim around in the
[1:11:05] bless sing to the Holy Ghost and the
[1:11:08] power of the Living God let me tell you
[1:11:10] it's a powerful thing to come into the
[1:11:12] presence of the Living God
[1:11:15] ah goodness amen the same thing there is
[1:11:18] to a Believer when he meets God face to
[1:11:20] face he comes to himself the seed is in
[1:11:24] him and he's quickened
[1:11:26] they commence filter that word cannot
[1:11:29] deny itself and it then it's satisfied
[1:11:31] or a desire of what what made you desire
[1:11:35] it in the first place
[1:11:37] now that's a that is a that is a that is
[1:11:40] a life question
[1:11:42] what made you like this message what
[1:11:45] made you want this message brother
[1:11:47] banham said I've got to turn my timer on
[1:11:49] too amen he said what it is he said what
[1:11:51] it is he said it's because your desire
[1:11:53] in the first place down in your soul
[1:11:56] that was a predestinated seed which was
[1:11:59] eternal life and it was always there
[1:12:04] so preacher what are you doing I'm
[1:12:05] justifying God of getting you
[1:12:07] God is Justified in the beginning of you
[1:12:10] you belong to him he didn't steal
[1:12:12] nothing you you were his to begin with
[1:12:16] and the only reason he shed the blood
[1:12:18] was to buy back his own boat
[1:12:22] y'all know that story about that
[1:12:24] sailboat that little boy lost it didn't
[1:12:26] he but one day he saw in the pawn shop
[1:12:29] and he said that's my boat and he went
[1:12:30] and said mister that's my boat he said
[1:12:32] well somebody found it and if you wanted
[1:12:34] it's a certain price and he paid the
[1:12:36] price he bought his own boat well I'll
[1:12:38] tell you God bought his own bride and
[1:12:40] he's the Justified and taking it you're
[1:12:42] double redeemed don't you you double
[1:12:44] bought you were used to begin with and
[1:12:46] he also paid for you pawn shop can't
[1:12:49] hold you come on there ain't no leans
[1:12:51] against your life you're free and you're
[1:12:53] free if you want to be free if you want
[1:12:55] to be free I'm on church if you want to
[1:12:58] be free you're free tonight there's no
[1:13:00] leans against you it's nothing can hold
[1:13:03] you come on church you can let go and
[1:13:05] let God if you so desire amen amen
[1:13:09] there's a seed on the inside of you and
[1:13:11] here's the powerful thing do you know
[1:13:13] that seed won't receive anything
[1:13:15] that she won't receive just anything
[1:13:18] Brother Band said there's nothing to get
[1:13:20] into that but the Holy Ghost
[1:13:22] my goodness amen he said there's nothing
[1:13:24] can get in that seed but the Holy Ghost
[1:13:27] it's that germ it might come to life
[1:13:29] anywhere but nothing can get into it but
[1:13:32] the Holy Ghost amen it's a germ a seed
[1:13:35] from the beginning that was in God at
[1:13:37] the beginning standing there drawing
[1:13:38] that Seed Life this seed is in Your
[1:13:41] Heart by for the nation Hallelujah the
[1:13:44] seed is already in there by the
[1:13:46] foreknowledge of God predestinated and
[1:13:48] when it draws it can't draw nothing else
[1:13:51] but the word my goodness has been a
[1:13:54] filter put in us the filters a built-in
[1:13:57] filter the gene seed of God and can only
[1:13:59] draw the word of the or the holy ghost
[1:14:02] out of the word isn't it powerful what
[1:14:05] is it it's a drawing power there's only
[1:14:07] one thing that will pass through that
[1:14:09] word that's the Holy Ghost
[1:14:11] that's the Holy Ghost
[1:14:13] so preacher what are you talking about
[1:14:14] I'm talking about things that are to be
[1:14:16] amen raptured part two things that are
[1:14:19] to be brother bam said a real child of
[1:14:21] God is hungering and thirsting and if
[1:14:24] there's something in your heart telling
[1:14:25] you you want it and it needs it there it
[1:14:28] shows something pulsating trying to pull
[1:14:30] you there if there's something wanting
[1:14:32] to change if there's a body a desire for
[1:14:35] the body change there's got to be one
[1:14:37] somewhere I'm on Church there's not a
[1:14:41] fish that has a fin on his back unless
[1:14:43] there's a puddle of water to swim it in
[1:14:45] amen and there's not a desire in your
[1:14:48] heart to walk from one dimension to
[1:14:50] another unless there's a way to do it
[1:14:52] amen there's got to be something I I
[1:14:55] don't know I don't know I I I I I how
[1:14:58] could I say it I know we're all on the
[1:14:59] same page here but I'm gonna talk about
[1:15:01] me my desire is to feel the elements of
[1:15:04] my body I want to know what it's like to
[1:15:07] find mortal elements change to be
[1:15:10] immortal elements I want to be even the
[1:15:12] Fulfillment of first Thessalonians 4 as
[1:15:15] something in my life that is the
[1:15:17] greatest pool on my life it has pulled
[1:15:19] me through everything every situation
[1:15:22] every argument every five every every
[1:15:24] destitute every desperate thing every
[1:15:27] family problem every Church problem
[1:15:29] every world problem when others just
[1:15:31] stopped on the roadside and for some
[1:15:34] reason I kept pressing it's this Rapture
[1:15:36] that I'm interested in I'm interested in
[1:15:39] the change of my body well if I'm that
[1:15:41] interested in it if I desire it that
[1:15:44] much there has got to be a Rapture
[1:15:46] somewhere foreign
[1:15:51] and thirsting if there's something there
[1:15:54] there's something trying to pull you
[1:15:55] there there's a body that's there
[1:15:59] amen there's a body that's there one of
[1:16:02] this type here what are you using this
[1:16:04] for and glorify the devil in the world
[1:16:06] but there's something up there you're
[1:16:07] glorifying god with your life In My
[1:16:09] Father's House of many mansions if it
[1:16:11] wasn't so I wouldn't have told you I go
[1:16:13] and prepare a place and come again to
[1:16:15] receive you unto myself things that are
[1:16:17] to be things that are now only potential
[1:16:20] our calling for things that are to be
[1:16:25] he said preacher what are you saying
[1:16:28] I'm saying William Branham preached the
[1:16:30] Rapture because there was a seed in you
[1:16:33] for rapture
[1:16:36] now I want you in the message things
[1:16:38] that are to be brother Brown says
[1:16:40] something that's very powerful he said
[1:16:41] listen before a little baby is born it's
[1:16:44] craving for vitamins and a mother's word
[1:16:47] specs and says Dad I want cantaloupe or
[1:16:49] I want watermelon I want something
[1:16:51] another he said well he'll do anything
[1:16:53] he can to get it because he wants his
[1:16:55] child born as perfect as it can be how
[1:16:58] many of you had them babies
[1:17:00] hey man you you know you'd weather the
[1:17:02] cold night to get out and get get your
[1:17:05] wife now you boys ain't got a guy
[1:17:07] married yet you ain't got babies you
[1:17:09] don't understand this but but to
[1:17:10] anybody's got babies and your wife over
[1:17:12] and she she gets to want some pickles
[1:17:15] with her ice cream they ain't no pickles
[1:17:16] in the house you'll get up on a cold
[1:17:18] night and slip your clothes on go down
[1:17:20] to the market amen and pick her up some
[1:17:22] pickles or get some ice cream you'll do
[1:17:25] something because she's asking for it
[1:17:27] and that that's your baby you want
[1:17:29] perfection in your baby and you you can
[1:17:32] say well that's the weirdest that's the
[1:17:34] weirdest appetite anybody ever had why
[1:17:37] do you want that kind of food why you
[1:17:38] want why you want bananas on peanut
[1:17:40] butter with mayonnaise why what you want
[1:17:42] that for wait a minute it's showing you
[1:17:45] she never wanted that before
[1:17:47] she never liked that before
[1:17:53] pulling for something because something
[1:17:55] is coming into existence and you maybe
[1:17:58] were in the world or you was loving the
[1:18:00] things and amen you was out there doing
[1:18:02] whatever you was going to do Amen
[1:18:04] Brother on you remember I've heard your
[1:18:06] testimony you were doing whatever you
[1:18:07] want to do but one day you got to
[1:18:09] craving something else you got to want
[1:18:12] something else amen I remember very
[1:18:14] distinctly when God wouldn't let me
[1:18:16] alone for two years amen it was a war I
[1:18:19] couldn't go to sleep I couldn't go deer
[1:18:20] hunting I couldn't be alone amen because
[1:18:22] every moment of my life something was
[1:18:25] pulling at me what was it it was God
[1:18:27] pulling at that seed but he had a
[1:18:29] prophet to speak those words because
[1:18:31] there was something in me that needed
[1:18:34] that word to develop develop a perfect
[1:18:37] life and there's a life on the inside of
[1:18:39] you and a God Amen brother Adam says it
[1:18:42] like this he said God will call a man to
[1:18:45] the pulpit to preach something because
[1:18:48] of your need
[1:18:51] because of your need
[1:18:54] come on sometimes you need it when you
[1:18:56] don't even know you need it
[1:18:58] I could preach a little while right here
[1:18:59] sometimes God will have a man preach
[1:19:01] something you don't even know why he's
[1:19:02] preaching it but you got a need of it
[1:19:04] come on they didn't think we needed
[1:19:07] Seven Seals preached but God knew we
[1:19:09] needed Seven Seals I didn't even there
[1:19:11] was Seven Seals but when God said we
[1:19:14] needed it he opened up the green beans
[1:19:16] and because it was a bride needing
[1:19:19] vitamins and you can't eat it till it's
[1:19:21] open you can't walk it till it's broke
[1:19:23] but we are in a generation where God has
[1:19:27] gave us every vitamin of the word of God
[1:19:29] to fulfill whatever desire we have in
[1:19:32] this generation he'll call somebody to
[1:19:35] the pulpit to speak it
[1:19:38] so brother Wayne I wasn't even here when
[1:19:40] brother Brown preached the Rapture
[1:19:41] that's all right that's all right but
[1:19:43] let me say let me tell you what he said
[1:19:44] in paragraph 181 he said we're ready now
[1:19:47] waiting for the Rapture God calls
[1:19:48] somebody to preach it now he said the
[1:19:50] Rapture of the Saints it has been spoken
[1:19:53] and so shall it be
[1:19:56] in the end of the Rapture sermon if you
[1:19:58] listen to that tape very often you're
[1:20:00] going to notice something along towards
[1:20:02] the end of it brother Brown's going to
[1:20:03] say I believe that woman wants us to
[1:20:05] leave
[1:20:07] I believe that woman wants us to leave
[1:20:09] she came to the back of the room they
[1:20:12] had expired their stay
[1:20:13] things had come to an end
[1:20:17] and she's wanting to kick the prophet
[1:20:19] out
[1:20:20] come on church and he's saying his last
[1:20:24] words over this congregation he's only
[1:20:27] got a few more sermons to preach amen
[1:20:29] and here he is saying these last words
[1:20:31] and they're trying to kick him out that
[1:20:34] woman's trying to put him out he said
[1:20:36] but I've got to say a few more things
[1:20:38] and he finishes a Rapture and said it
[1:20:41] has been spoken so shall it be look at
[1:20:44] that he had to force his way and hold
[1:20:46] back the doors and preach it when he
[1:20:48] wasn't even wanted to preach it when
[1:20:50] they didn't even desire him to preach it
[1:20:52] but he knew that was coming to church it
[1:20:55] was coming to Pride he knew we was going
[1:20:57] to need this word and he said it has
[1:21:00] been spoken so shall it be he took those
[1:21:04] last minutes he said take the offering
[1:21:06] and pray pray for it if you'd like to
[1:21:09] now you say preacher what what are you
[1:21:11] getting that I I was I was blessed one
[1:21:13] time I think it was in Jeffersonville
[1:21:15] when I first heard that so it's been so
[1:21:17] concerned I didn't really want to preach
[1:21:18] on it because I thought am I making too
[1:21:19] much out of this it has been spoken so
[1:21:22] shall it be so I actually was similar
[1:21:23] was with the brothers notes on the
[1:21:25] Rapture was laying out I think I was in
[1:21:26] Jeffersonville and I walked by and I
[1:21:29] looked down at his handwritten notes in
[1:21:31] a big block it was written it has been
[1:21:35] spoken so shall it be and I thought oh
[1:21:38] he wasn't no accident he meant to say
[1:21:41] that amen he meant to put those words
[1:21:44] out there and he knew what he was doing
[1:21:46] church he knew he was speaking the
[1:21:49] Rapture for this generation it has been
[1:21:52] spoken so shall it be when God says
[1:21:55] anything all heavens and earth will pass
[1:21:57] away but that word will never fail
[1:22:00] paragraph 182 he said when God set back
[1:22:03] there in Genesis 1. look what he's
[1:22:04] comparing his ministry to amen back
[1:22:07] there in Genesis 1 it might have been
[1:22:09] 100 years before there was any light but
[1:22:11] he said let there be a palm tree let
[1:22:13] there be an oak let there be a desert
[1:22:14] let there be a mountain let there be
[1:22:16] this he spoke it you see and as long as
[1:22:19] it went out of his mouth in a word it
[1:22:22] had to be manifested it had to be as
[1:22:25] long as it went out of his mouth it had
[1:22:28] to be spoken and once it was spoken it
[1:22:30] would manifest it had to be paragraph
[1:22:33] 189 brother bam Compares himself to
[1:22:35] Isaiah amen how did Jesus get into the
[1:22:38] Earth folks Isaiah prophesied of him 800
[1:22:41] years before he ever came and brother
[1:22:43] man said an intelligent young man that
[1:22:45] one day under inspiration he said he
[1:22:48] couldn't help but saying it a virgin
[1:22:50] shall conceive can you imagine how silly
[1:22:54] they looked at him him a Vindicated
[1:22:56] Prophet amen didn't have anything lined
[1:22:59] up to fix that or he made but he spoke
[1:23:01] that word and said a virgin shall
[1:23:04] conceive unto us the son is born and
[1:23:06] unto us a child is given his name should
[1:23:09] be called counselor and Prince of Peace
[1:23:11] body God Everlasting father and of his
[1:23:14] government there shall be no end he said
[1:23:16] there shall be no end to this rain how
[1:23:18] could that man intelligently say that a
[1:23:21] virgin should conceive everybody look
[1:23:24] for it though and it's done been spoken
[1:23:26] it was the saith the Lord it had to come
[1:23:29] to pass because it was God's word and
[1:23:32] that's the same as it was in Genesis
[1:23:34] when he planted them seeds down there
[1:23:36] beneath that sea it was without form and
[1:23:38] void and water was upon the deep but it
[1:23:41] had to come to pass and one day 800
[1:23:44] years later there was a womb of aversion
[1:23:46] conceived of the Sea of God and created
[1:23:49] and she brought forth a son my when that
[1:23:52] Prophet spoke it you've heard it
[1:23:54] preached 800 years it circled the Earth
[1:23:57] come on Church it had been there longer
[1:24:00] than that because when God told Eve amen
[1:24:02] the woman sees shall bruise the head of
[1:24:04] the serpent that was the same seed and
[1:24:06] it had been frozen since the Garden of
[1:24:08] Eden waiting for somebody to have it
[1:24:10] when God told Abraham he would have a
[1:24:13] son Isaac was not the son he was talking
[1:24:15] about Jesus was the son and Mary
[1:24:18] produced the son of Abraham Jesus Christ
[1:24:22] and Mary produced the son of God Amen
[1:24:26] what was it it was the spoken word fell
[1:24:28] into the womb oh it was a virgin whom it
[1:24:31] fell into nothing mingled with it
[1:24:33] brother so when it produced It produced
[1:24:36] Purity It produced something that was
[1:24:38] not corrupted you see what he was
[1:24:40] talking about the prophet of God said
[1:24:41] the womb amen of the church is their
[1:24:44] mind he said this word falls into the
[1:24:47] spirit of your mind and you let it fall
[1:24:49] into your heart and there the womb
[1:24:52] produces
[1:24:55] the womb produces the word in the
[1:24:58] generation that is spoken in
[1:25:00] [Applause]
[1:25:02] the preacher what are you talking about
[1:25:03] I'm talking about the Virgin born son of
[1:25:05] God
[1:25:06] brother bam said it was the son of the
[1:25:08] Virgin the manifested word let me ask
[1:25:11] you that amen what are you producing the
[1:25:14] manifested word from the Virgin womb
[1:25:17] brother man said when that son was born
[1:25:19] he said the same son that came from the
[1:25:22] words of Isaiah stood at the grave of
[1:25:25] Lazarus and he said Lazarus come forth
[1:25:29] what was it amen God produced the voice
[1:25:33] of Resurrection by the spoken word of
[1:25:35] Isaiah and the Church of the Living God
[1:25:37] brother random says the message is the
[1:25:40] shout but the bride is the voice and
[1:25:43] when he prophesied of a bride coming
[1:25:44] that fell into the womb of the church
[1:25:46] and that same thing that is produced
[1:25:49] through the church is the voice of
[1:25:51] Resurrection now I'll tell you what Amen
[1:25:54] in the days of Martin Luther when he
[1:25:55] preached his message amen the lutherans
[1:25:57] came to him and they raised up and they
[1:25:59] came and John Wesley they raised up and
[1:26:02] they came
[1:26:03] is that right amen and and in the days
[1:26:05] of the Reformation under the baptism of
[1:26:07] the spirit they raised up and they came
[1:26:09] amen but under the message of the hour
[1:26:11] they've raised up and they came can I
[1:26:13] say something to y'all but this is the
[1:26:15] opening of the Lamb's Book of Life and
[1:26:17] when you begin to believe this this is
[1:26:20] going to bring forth every saint of
[1:26:22] every age that has ever been in the
[1:26:25] ground we're going to draw power out of
[1:26:27] the ground ironius out of the grand Ruth
[1:26:29] that's going to come out of the ground
[1:26:31] by your faith in this word it will
[1:26:34] deliver everything
[1:26:35] yeah
[1:26:36] what has been produced what has been
[1:26:39] produced is the voice of Resurrection
[1:26:43] show it to you in the scripture
[1:26:46] Jesus called the resurrection
[1:26:50] Jesus called the resurrection
[1:26:53] the bride
[1:26:55] is the voice of Resurrection
[1:26:59] somebody told me one time so brother
[1:27:00] when I was preaching that wrong I said
[1:27:02] we are I said didn't brother bam say the
[1:27:04] voice is in the bride they said yeah but
[1:27:07] it doesn't say the voice of
[1:27:08] resurrections in The Bride I said well
[1:27:10] you're smarter than I am
[1:27:12] they said what do you mean I said well
[1:27:13] I've never been able to take the
[1:27:15] resurrection out of the voice of God
[1:27:18] I figure if God speaks there's
[1:27:19] Resurrection in The Voice
[1:27:22] amen I I'm just I'm sorry I'm oh
[1:27:25] hillbilly I figure there's power in that
[1:27:28] voice there's Resurrection in that voice
[1:27:29] it's anointing in that voice I'm talking
[1:27:32] about something here's an eye the Flesh
[1:27:34] of this message is the voice of
[1:27:37] Resurrection in this generation and that
[1:27:39] ain't somebody that was and that is
[1:27:41] somebody that's coming I'm talking about
[1:27:43] you I'm looking at the voice of the
[1:27:46] Resurrection in the last day not that
[1:27:48] you're going to stand over a grave and
[1:27:50] call your loved ones names that's not
[1:27:52] what I'm talking about I'm talking about
[1:27:54] a seed that's in the field waiting for
[1:27:56] the harvest season who calls who caused
[1:27:59] the Resurrection The the seed or the
[1:28:02] farmer I tell you who does it the farmer
[1:28:05] does it and whatever grain is in the is
[1:28:07] in the is in The Granary bin they don't
[1:28:09] call for the Harvest they're already
[1:28:11] there the ones that causes the Harvest
[1:28:13] is the grain that's in the field but
[1:28:16] when they get into the ripening
[1:28:17] condition when the when the ripening
[1:28:20] comes their voice calls for them to
[1:28:22] bring a harvest into the Earth
[1:28:26] and as this bride begins to mature
[1:28:28] Harvest
[1:28:30] Harvest will become brother Brown said
[1:28:33] it's been spoken it will come to pass
[1:28:35] all right
[1:28:37] that's pretty powerful stuff folks
[1:28:42] if you if you miss anything else about
[1:28:43] the Rapture tape go back and listen to
[1:28:45] this it's been spoken
[1:28:47] it shall come to pass
[1:28:52] it'll get you through everything
[1:28:56] it'll get you through everything it's
[1:28:58] the vision that it gets you through it
[1:28:59] all
[1:29:01] right y'all know brother man when he
[1:29:03] went to that doctor and he come back and
[1:29:04] gave him that discouragement he said
[1:29:05] brother man Angel met him remember he
[1:29:08] met him he said now don't let him do
[1:29:10] that to you it's just your stomach and
[1:29:13] brother Brown said if it hadn't been for
[1:29:14] the vision I'd have been a very
[1:29:16] discouraged boy all right
[1:29:19] think about Joe think about Joshua
[1:29:22] standing there at those walls
[1:29:25] without a vision
[1:29:28] hey man I got one I'm not using it so
[1:29:30] sorry I did that to you again didn't I
[1:29:32] I just like to see him walk down that oh
[1:29:35] the Hank job God bless him
[1:29:39] he did something for the for the man of
[1:29:41] God God bless him
[1:29:43] amen
[1:29:45] what's this it's it's been spoken she'll
[1:29:47] shall be now if you go to First
[1:29:49] Corinthians 15 51 Paul is the same
[1:29:51] writer of Corinthians and Thessalonians
[1:29:54] and he said behold I show you a mystery
[1:29:56] and we don't have a lot of time to
[1:29:58] preach there but I'll say this and Amos
[1:30:00] it tells us that a mystery can only be
[1:30:02] revealed by a prophet
[1:30:04] so Paul locks the Rapture at this point
[1:30:08] and he said we shall not all sleep but
[1:30:10] we shall all be changed telling us it
[1:30:14] takes the presence of God to change
[1:30:16] living
[1:30:17] and change dead it takes him to change
[1:30:20] all but it says in the moment in the
[1:30:22] twinkling of an eye at the last Trump
[1:30:25] for the Trump shall sound and the dead
[1:30:26] shall be raised Incorruptible and we
[1:30:29] shall all be changed now look at the
[1:30:30] beauty of this for this corruptable
[1:30:32] must put on incorruption
[1:30:35] and this Mortal must put on immortality
[1:30:39] and when this corruptable shall put on
[1:30:41] incorruption this Mortal shall put on
[1:30:43] immortality then shall be brought to
[1:30:45] pass the saying that is written death is
[1:30:47] swallowed up in Victory
[1:30:50] now if you if you if you recognize that
[1:30:53] he's talking about both resurrection and
[1:30:55] rapture he's talking about Mortal
[1:30:57] becoming Immortal he's not like
[1:30:58] corrupted becoming incorrupted and he's
[1:31:00] showing you that there's a change going
[1:31:02] to happen in the flesh that's what Paul
[1:31:03] is preaching to us it's happening in the
[1:31:06] in the flesh now the reality is this
[1:31:09] that there has to be a stopping of the
[1:31:13] corruption in your body
[1:31:15] and a reversal of that corruption to
[1:31:17] incorruption
[1:31:19] now
[1:31:20] job will say this in job 14. he said oh
[1:31:23] that thou will hide me in the grave that
[1:31:25] thou will just keep me secreted to thy
[1:31:26] wrath has passed and that would support
[1:31:28] me a set time and remember me now if a
[1:31:31] man shall die shall he live again in all
[1:31:33] the days of my appointed time will I
[1:31:35] wait till my change come
[1:31:38] Thou shalt call and I will answer thee
[1:31:41] that will have the desire
[1:31:44] to the work of thine hands now the
[1:31:47] prophet of God actually will explain job
[1:31:50] to us in a message called the end time
[1:31:53] seed sign now I know as well as
[1:31:55] preaching to you I'm setting this uh
[1:31:57] maybe a few my watch it later and so I
[1:32:00] want to quote this point to you end time
[1:32:01] seed sign when I first studied this
[1:32:03] sermon in depth I wondered why he would
[1:32:06] call it the end time seed sign but it's
[1:32:08] preached right after spoken word
[1:32:10] Original Seed and he preaches end time
[1:32:12] seed sign and uses the scripture Amos 3
[1:32:15] the Lord Our God shall do nothing until
[1:32:17] he first sends it by a prophet
[1:32:19] and he says in in he begins by saying
[1:32:23] and being a prophet we know the story of
[1:32:25] Job God finally explained to job that
[1:32:30] the seed of man was imperfect because
[1:32:32] the mother of man had failed
[1:32:35] that that what job remember job looked
[1:32:38] at the at the at the flowers and he said
[1:32:40] they go down and they come back and he
[1:32:43] said the tree it goes down and it comes
[1:32:45] back he said but man now when we place
[1:32:48] him in the grave he said he stays there
[1:32:51] remember he just keeps staying there now
[1:32:53] what God was doing was he was showing
[1:32:55] job in nature in a short cycle see if
[1:32:59] you if you want to understand the
[1:33:00] resurrection and and maybe you're not
[1:33:02] going to live from the time to a
[1:33:04] resurrection of humanity but if you put
[1:33:07] a flower in the ground you see it next
[1:33:10] spring
[1:33:11] so you can see the witness of
[1:33:13] Resurrection in nature because in one
[1:33:16] year you see a death a burial and a
[1:33:18] resurrection and brings it back to the
[1:33:20] same now if you don't want to study it
[1:33:22] in a year long or an annual Resurrection
[1:33:24] brother Brown said it actually happens
[1:33:27] daily by the sunshine he said the sun
[1:33:29] comes up in the morning right he said
[1:33:32] that's your birth and then it comes to
[1:33:34] 10 o'clock and there's your teenage
[1:33:35] years and then it hits that noon sun he
[1:33:38] said there's your middle age he said
[1:33:39] then you see it begin to fall right he
[1:33:42] said now when it goes down in the
[1:33:44] evening he said that's not all of it in
[1:33:47] the morning he said it'll raise up again
[1:33:50] he shows you death burial and
[1:33:52] Resurrection every day of your life
[1:33:55] Garnet Pink's funeral actually brother
[1:33:57] Branham brings it out and he says look
[1:33:58] in that in that point he says he says
[1:34:01] now everything witnesses that Garnet
[1:34:03] will raise again he actually speaking
[1:34:05] now and he says the Bible testifies he
[1:34:08] will he said the son testifies he will
[1:34:11] he said the flowers testify he will he
[1:34:14] said it's the word of God doing the
[1:34:15] testifying you say preacher what are you
[1:34:17] saying job was seeing that he was seeing
[1:34:20] the testimony in the son he was seeing
[1:34:22] the testimony in the nature but he
[1:34:25] hadn't seen the actual Resurrection yet
[1:34:27] so he said what's the matter with man
[1:34:29] that he goes in the ground he don't come
[1:34:31] again but brother Adam said but what
[1:34:33] happened he was a prophet so God showed
[1:34:35] him the secret he said what it was he
[1:34:38] said he had known to the prophets he
[1:34:40] spoke the word and when he spoke the
[1:34:42] word God showed him and it become
[1:34:43] material it was a spoken word now what
[1:34:46] he had seen was is he had seen when God
[1:34:48] spoke the word in the Garden of Eden now
[1:34:50] don't lose our train it has been spoken
[1:34:52] so shall it be amen back there in the
[1:34:55] Garden of Eden when he spoke that word
[1:34:57] back there amen Adam and Eve lived in
[1:35:00] Perfection until Eve corrupted the word
[1:35:03] and what job saw in Vision being a
[1:35:07] prophet was we fail because of that
[1:35:09] corruptive word he's said but then being
[1:35:12] a prophet God didn't leave him in just
[1:35:15] see him the problem as a lot of people
[1:35:17] can see problems folks but job being a
[1:35:20] prophet he didn't just see the problem
[1:35:22] but he turned and said oh I see what it
[1:35:25] is it's the corrupted word he said then
[1:35:28] there must come another spoken word that
[1:35:32] will be without corruption and job turns
[1:35:34] around remember in job 19 and 25 he said
[1:35:37] I know that my redeemer liveth and they
[1:35:40] shall stand in the latter days upon the
[1:35:42] Earth and though after my skin worms
[1:35:45] destroy this body yet in my flesh I
[1:35:47] shall see God and whom should I see for
[1:35:50] myself my eyes Shall Behold Him and not
[1:35:53] another though the Reigns be consumed
[1:35:55] within me he said preacher wise That's
[1:35:57] so exciting because that Resurrection
[1:35:59] was being prophesied by job himself he
[1:36:03] was talking about his own body was going
[1:36:06] to come out of the ground and then he
[1:36:08] said put me in the ground if you want to
[1:36:10] but my change is coming my change is
[1:36:13] coming I tell you something that I
[1:36:15] church amen I believe there's been
[1:36:17] people in this generation that'll speak
[1:36:19] the resurrection and the Rapture by the
[1:36:22] preaching of the word of God it has been
[1:36:25] spoken hey hey amen no wonder David
[1:36:28] could send my flesh shall rest in hope
[1:36:30] the flesh arrests and hope it had
[1:36:33] already been spoken
[1:36:35] my
[1:36:37] said preacher what are you talking about
[1:36:39] if you can find more corruption come in
[1:36:41] I can tell you how to stop it come on
[1:36:44] church we are reversing the death cycle
[1:36:46] we are stopping the corruption cycle and
[1:36:50] we're moving from a death cycle to a
[1:36:52] life cycle
[1:36:53] the cycle of the Rapture is already on
[1:36:57] us amen the cycle of the change is
[1:37:01] already on us
[1:37:04] somebody said well when's this Rapture
[1:37:06] going to start it'd be like me going in
[1:37:08] the house and Chris in there washing
[1:37:09] clothes
[1:37:11] amen there's Cycles so that there's a
[1:37:13] rent cycle and a wash cycle and a tumble
[1:37:15] side all them Cycles is there but the
[1:37:17] minute she pushes that power button she
[1:37:19] just started washing my clothes and
[1:37:22] after a little while when it's all over
[1:37:24] I'll take my clothes out of the finished
[1:37:26] cycle amen and if I'd say it to you
[1:37:28] sisters the washing machine's running
[1:37:31] already amen the cycle of the spoken
[1:37:34] word has already came into the Church of
[1:37:37] the Living God we're not waiting on the
[1:37:39] prophet to say it this spot will have
[1:37:42] the saith the Lord or shall stand still
[1:37:44] that's why Prophet turned around and
[1:37:46] said now she has the saith the Lord then
[1:37:49] the prophet will say it like this the
[1:37:52] move is on for the bride it's time to go
[1:37:55] church it's time to go the cycle of the
[1:37:59] Rapture is a Polish in this generation
[1:38:04] stopping at this cycle
[1:38:07] stopping the death cycle and beginning a
[1:38:10] life cycle
[1:38:13] it's in the scripture second Corinthians
[1:38:15] 11 and 2 I'm jealous over thee with The
[1:38:17] Godly jealous for I have a spouse
[1:38:18] neither one husband that I may present
[1:38:20] you a chaste virgin to Christ but I fear
[1:38:22] my last any means the serpent begalled
[1:38:24] Eve through stability so will your minds
[1:38:27] be corrupted from the Simplicity that is
[1:38:28] in Christ
[1:38:30] Paul knew it was corruption that caused
[1:38:32] the problems too
[1:38:34] but in the mystery of First Corinthians
[1:38:37] 15 he is preaching a prophet coming with
[1:38:40] a spoken word of clarity without
[1:38:43] corruption come on it was The
[1:38:45] Incorruptible word of God that was being
[1:38:48] spoken
[1:38:50] it's a preacher I don't believe words
[1:38:51] have that much power have you read your
[1:38:53] Bible lately
[1:38:54] [Music]
[1:38:55] have you read your Bible lately what
[1:38:57] condition was evelist in before she
[1:39:00] listened to the words perverted by Satan
[1:39:02] she was in a condition of perfection she
[1:39:05] was in a condition of eternal life
[1:39:07] everything was perfect one word twisted
[1:39:10] around pulled her out of Peace into
[1:39:13] nervousness out of Peace into depression
[1:39:16] out of joy and salvation into a fall
[1:39:19] they fell from eternity into the Earth
[1:39:22] what a fall they had what a fall it was
[1:39:25] oh but thanks be to God Amen he said the
[1:39:29] word being tormented and twisted brought
[1:39:31] them out but if the word being broke can
[1:39:34] bring somebody out what about when the
[1:39:37] word is restored to the Church of the
[1:39:39] Living God this word can take you from a
[1:39:42] nervousness back to Joy it can take you
[1:39:45] from an Age of Anxiety into the peace of
[1:39:48] God it can take you from death to life
[1:39:50] it can take you from Mortal the
[1:39:52] immortality it can take you from
[1:39:54] correction to win corruption I'm talking
[1:39:57] about the power of the spoken word of
[1:40:00] God in this generation uh it's been
[1:40:03] spoken so shall it be
[1:40:06] [Applause]
[1:40:08] let me say it like this if snake if
[1:40:10] Satan could snatch her from the Garden
[1:40:12] of Eden by a corrupted word then God can
[1:40:16] snatch a bride out of laodicea by a
[1:40:20] perfect word and we now have the perfect
[1:40:23] interpretation of the perfect word and
[1:40:26] it's come to snatch you
[1:40:28] [Applause]
[1:40:30] where the car can see who's there the
[1:40:32] Eagles shall be gathered together
[1:40:35] we won one in the bear two in the back
[1:40:37] one live one taken two in the field one
[1:40:39] left one taken where's this gonna happen
[1:40:41] Lord where the carcass is
[1:40:44] there the Eagles will gather together
[1:40:48] man lives by every word
[1:40:52] see the power of the Gospel to snatch
[1:40:54] you out of the hands of the enemy
[1:40:57] so preacher I'll tell you what man don't
[1:40:59] feel like Rapture to me let me know I'm
[1:41:02] going to present the way the prophet did
[1:41:04] end time seed sign he said what did
[1:41:06] Elijah tell that woman
[1:41:08] she went nothing but a handful of meal
[1:41:10] he said make me a curse first
[1:41:13] now I'm telling you that was a poor
[1:41:15] little woman without money or without
[1:41:16] food and if that Prophet asked to be fed
[1:41:18] first it wasn't because he wasn't a
[1:41:20] gentleman
[1:41:22] come on Church it wasn't that he wasn't
[1:41:24] a gentleman but he knew a law of God
[1:41:28] if you'll take my word first you won't
[1:41:31] have no more need your life is over your
[1:41:34] days of destitute are finished your days
[1:41:36] of famine have ended into a great feast
[1:41:39] of the Lord and when that woman amen
[1:41:41] when that woman obeyed that word he come
[1:41:43] back and said the saith the Lord the
[1:41:46] millbarrow will never go dry the curse
[1:41:48] will never run empty again when she was
[1:41:51] at the bottom
[1:41:52] oh my god when she was at the end that's
[1:41:56] when Elijah came and when the laodicea
[1:41:59] was at the end of his rope it was at the
[1:42:02] end of things that's when the prophet
[1:42:04] came and said give me what you got first
[1:42:06] and then I'll give you the saith the
[1:42:09] Lord I'll give you a word that'll snatch
[1:42:11] you out of your denomination it'll
[1:42:13] snatch you out and bring you into this
[1:42:16] great Rapture of life amen what brother
[1:42:19] bam said he said the miracle happens
[1:42:21] after you take God's word
[1:42:23] everybody
[1:42:25] was not being rude it was not being
[1:42:28] prejudiced you needed a word and he
[1:42:31] preached it even though it rubbed him
[1:42:33] them theologians wrong
[1:42:38] you began to believe God's word and the
[1:42:40] Miracle takes place on that word that's
[1:42:43] a refrigerator quote
[1:42:44] the miracle takes place
[1:42:46] on the word
[1:42:49] because the word is a seed that brings
[1:42:52] forth the miracle got to take the word
[1:42:55] first
[1:42:57] amen I said preacher what are you trying
[1:42:59] to say brother man said it's the law
[1:43:00] that's what Mary did remember
[1:43:02] Gabriel met her and testified to the
[1:43:04] word and said a virgin shall conceive
[1:43:06] that's your type now an angel came and
[1:43:08] said this is the word she checked it by
[1:43:10] the book of Isaiah and then she said be
[1:43:12] it unto me according to Thy word no
[1:43:15] feelings
[1:43:16] no Sensations no emotions she just took
[1:43:19] the word now some theologians took that
[1:43:22] and tried to make it the baptism of the
[1:43:24] Holy Ghost it's not right the same woman
[1:43:27] just a few days later went up into the
[1:43:30] upper room and received the Holy Ghost
[1:43:32] come on Church you don't have to have a
[1:43:35] feeling to take the word but when you
[1:43:37] get the Holy Ghost it's a different
[1:43:39] story altogether
[1:43:41] I'm not feeding emotionalism and I'll
[1:43:44] tell you this hey man if you ever got
[1:43:46] what I got you'd know you got it
[1:43:49] I was a sinner amen I was in the I tell
[1:43:53] you what I feel I'm preaching right now
[1:43:54] I tell you what I I tell you this if you
[1:43:57] was as poor as I was poor and somebody
[1:43:59] walked in and handed you a billion
[1:44:01] dollars you'd feel it from the bottom of
[1:44:03] your feet to the top of your head and if
[1:44:05] you was as lost as I was lost when God
[1:44:07] gave me the Holy Ghost brother I felt it
[1:44:10] from the bottom of my feet to the top of
[1:44:12] my head and it ain't never left me
[1:44:16] my goodness
[1:44:19] I think the Young's Brothers saying it
[1:44:21] he gave me something I could feel
[1:44:29] I could preach all night on that point
[1:44:32] I said preacher why were you what are
[1:44:33] you talking about because brother Brown
[1:44:34] well my goodness let me just say it real
[1:44:37] clear brother man said why do they call
[1:44:39] me a Holy Roller I'm identified with
[1:44:42] that guy
[1:44:45] take the rapture
[1:44:46] as a seed
[1:44:49] oh boy
[1:44:51] have you ever thought
[1:44:52] that you're taking the Rapture as a seed
[1:44:57] you're accepting the Rapture as a seed
[1:45:00] when you receive this message you are
[1:45:03] receiving the seed of rapture
[1:45:09] when you believe it
[1:45:11] when you accept it into your life you
[1:45:13] are accepting the seed of rapture
[1:45:17] somebody said well I thought we were
[1:45:18] already seen Mary was seed when Isaiah
[1:45:21] said a virgin would conceive she was the
[1:45:23] seed but when Gabriel come he brought
[1:45:25] her Isaiah's word and seed come to seed
[1:45:27] and there was manifestation there's a
[1:45:29] word seed
[1:45:30] right there's a word seed and then
[1:45:33] there's a jean seed
[1:45:35] the prophet's message is the word seed
[1:45:37] you're the gene seed and they got to
[1:45:40] come together
[1:45:42] the predestinated plan of God is in view
[1:45:44] just as the seed other seeds must have
[1:45:46] ground prepared beforehand must have
[1:45:48] ground prepared before him this message
[1:45:51] had to have ground prepared to receive
[1:45:53] it
[1:45:55] works as faith is expressed that's the
[1:45:57] very very brother Brown said it's got to
[1:45:59] be prepared he said there's the
[1:46:00] predestinated plan just as other seeds
[1:46:02] the word of God is a seed and must have
[1:46:04] a ground prepared before amen now Jesus
[1:46:08] said a little lower in his Parable he
[1:46:10] said the ground has been made ready
[1:46:12] first so God in Sovereign Grace prepares
[1:46:14] the heart first he prepares you before
[1:46:18] the foundation of the world to receive
[1:46:21] him in this age
[1:46:23] he foreknew You by foreknowledge and
[1:46:26] ordained you to eternal life and he knew
[1:46:28] you therefore he prepared you
[1:46:32] that poor legalist Devil's flopping out
[1:46:34] the floor right now
[1:46:39] I'm talking about a snatching
[1:46:42] kidnapping a seizing
[1:46:44] God planted this in you he prepared you
[1:46:47] for it God's power to transform brother
[1:46:49] Brahman said Enoch he's our type was
[1:46:51] translated from Death By God's
[1:46:53] transforming power what did God do that
[1:46:56] for for a type for a Rapture that's
[1:46:58] coming
[1:46:59] paragraph 254 saying message he said the
[1:47:02] word has got to come to pass it's God's
[1:47:04] word planet in your heart if you want to
[1:47:08] go in the Rapture if you want to be a
[1:47:10] genuine Christian place this word I
[1:47:13] believe it was Ezekiel God said take the
[1:47:15] scroll and eat it up that prophet and
[1:47:18] the word became the same and every
[1:47:20] promise in here has to be manifest
[1:47:23] because it's God's original seed don't
[1:47:26] let some educated Theologian come out
[1:47:28] here and pump it out of you don't you
[1:47:30] let them spray you with that carnal
[1:47:32] science of knowledge and education you
[1:47:34] believe God Amen what's he telling you
[1:47:37] eat this take this message into you amen
[1:47:40] as a as a as a remember as that
[1:47:43] expecting mother take that message into
[1:47:46] you take the seed of the word into you
[1:47:49] as expecting mother craves food We crave
[1:47:52] the seed of rapture we knew we had to
[1:47:55] have it we knew something something
[1:47:57] wasn't satisfying there's an empty sound
[1:47:59] in the Pentecostals there's an empty
[1:48:01] sound in the lutherans there's a it's
[1:48:03] it's some of it's okay but there's just
[1:48:04] something's just not it didn't have the
[1:48:07] seed of rapture in it it could justify
[1:48:10] you it could sanctify you it could get
[1:48:12] you to get but it couldn't bring Rapture
[1:48:14] into your life but this message brings
[1:48:16] Rapture it's a rapturing faith and a
[1:48:19] Rapture and anointing it's a strange
[1:48:21] call Brother bam said
[1:48:25] it's a strange call he said I read in
[1:48:27] the past I read in the paper I'm gonna
[1:48:29] have to hurry he should have read in the
[1:48:30] paper the other day about a boy sucking
[1:48:32] on a bicycle
[1:48:34] now now friends he said that boy wasn't
[1:48:38] sucking on the bicycle Palace mom cut
[1:48:40] now his mom come out and caught him
[1:48:41] doing that and took him to the doctor
[1:48:43] you know why she took him to the doctor
[1:48:44] because it's a strange thing to see a
[1:48:46] kid of that age sucking on a bicycle
[1:48:48] pedal most kids ride them
[1:48:50] most kids using the bicycle you don't go
[1:48:53] out and see your kid on a bicycle and
[1:48:54] take it to the doctor and ask what's
[1:48:55] wrong but the minute it sucked on the
[1:48:57] bicycle pedal this kid's different
[1:49:00] something wrong with this kid
[1:49:03] and she took him to the message
[1:49:05] to find out what's wrong with this kid
[1:49:07] why do they just keep coming down that
[1:49:10] Altar and praying for that Holy Ghost
[1:49:11] why they keep asking for God why they
[1:49:14] keep they just won't quit they just want
[1:49:16] you've seen it brother Daryl in our
[1:49:17] meetings people sometimes you'll come by
[1:49:19] and pray and next year some of them same
[1:49:21] kids will be saying I want that Holy
[1:49:23] Ghost I want there's something about
[1:49:24] them that they just can't quit till they
[1:49:26] get that absolute
[1:49:29] what's wrong with them right brother
[1:49:30] ma'am said I'll tell you what was wrong
[1:49:31] with him he said they come to find out
[1:49:33] he didn't have enough sulfur in his body
[1:49:35] right y'all heard that he didn't have
[1:49:36] enough sulfur in his body he said but
[1:49:38] see it was in that bicycle pedal he said
[1:49:41] because it had came from the Earth where
[1:49:43] his body had came from so what happened
[1:49:45] is in his birth he had bypassed the need
[1:49:49] for the sulfur that was needed for life
[1:49:51] so there was somewhere their sulfur was
[1:49:55] and it was just in that bicycle so being
[1:49:57] he bypassed it in his birth he had to
[1:50:00] find it in another place so when he
[1:50:02] found it in the bicycle pedal he didn't
[1:50:04] care it was a bicycle pedal he just
[1:50:06] sucked on it anyhow come on church and
[1:50:09] you bypass your theophany when you was
[1:50:11] born into this Earth and when you come
[1:50:13] here you came about this theophany amen
[1:50:16] but one day you said I gotta have
[1:50:18] something I gotta have more than I got
[1:50:20] and you started back towards the word of
[1:50:24] God and started started listening to the
[1:50:26] message of the hour which everybody
[1:50:28] thought was no more than a bicycle panel
[1:50:30] amen but you was ready to do it and
[1:50:32] somebody says what's wrong with them I
[1:50:34] tell you what's wrong with them they got
[1:50:36] a gene seed on the inside and they
[1:50:38] bypass the word when they was born here
[1:50:40] but now they're coming back to the word
[1:50:43] and one of these mornings this word is
[1:50:45] going to change our middle bodies back
[1:50:48] to what it was to begin with amen they
[1:50:51] all come out of the ground didn't they
[1:50:52] and why are you feeding on this open
[1:50:54] book church because you was in the book
[1:50:56] before you were here and this message is
[1:50:59] the calling out of that book this
[1:51:01] message is the preaching of the book of
[1:51:03] redemption in this generation you're
[1:51:06] going back to where you come from that
[1:51:08] baby's born into the Earth and
[1:51:10] immediately it turns back to its mother
[1:51:12] and begins to nurse on the breasts of
[1:51:15] his mother where it came from and we
[1:51:17] come from God and we're returning to God
[1:51:19] God sent a message in this generation a
[1:51:23] door
[1:51:25] a door to return
[1:51:32] according to John 5 24 we're going to
[1:51:34] bypass judgment
[1:51:36] we're not coming into condemnation and
[1:51:39] you're going to need something to get
[1:51:40] around judgment and brother Brown says
[1:51:42] since you ain't going in judgment he
[1:51:44] produced a Rapture for the church and
[1:51:46] you're going in a Rapture instead of the
[1:51:48] Judgment you're going into a change
[1:51:50] instead of the instead of the Judgment
[1:51:52] seat we're going into the change of our
[1:51:54] body we've already passed death and came
[1:51:57] into life and you can put us in the
[1:52:00] ground but we will never die foreign
[1:52:09] says this bra to be waiting for the
[1:52:11] Revelation this rapture
[1:52:13] but there won't be no higher order
[1:52:16] than a prophet to bring the word
[1:52:18] right so we have
[1:52:20] the revelation of rapture that's why
[1:52:22] you're feeding on the message
[1:52:25] that's what's causing you to go there to
[1:52:26] feed
[1:52:27] it's it is strange I know it is it's odd
[1:52:30] for you to believe this compared to what
[1:52:31] the world believes but the reason behind
[1:52:34] it is different than what they think
[1:52:38] we're eating this way because our bodies
[1:52:41] are going to do something different than
[1:52:42] theirs
[1:52:45] if you're going to do something
[1:52:46] different you need a different food
[1:52:50] come on church we know we are what we
[1:52:52] eat
[1:52:53] y'all don't tell what I've been eating
[1:52:57] been eating that homemade biscuits and
[1:52:59] gravy and some fried chicken
[1:53:01] ain't nothing but ain't nothing as good
[1:53:03] if you don't fry it
[1:53:05] I'm down south I'm preach it out Cana
[1:53:09] I hope my home Church ain't listening
[1:53:14] ain't nothing as good as you fry it you
[1:53:16] know
[1:53:17] boy you don't only taste good you wear
[1:53:19] it sometimes
[1:53:24] I just hope we wear the message
[1:53:27] brother bam says you know
[1:53:29] that we're waiting on the Revelation if
[1:53:31] you read the message of the rapture
[1:53:34] he says we're waiting on it and just a
[1:53:36] few pages later
[1:53:38] he tells you the revelation of the
[1:53:40] rapture
[1:53:41] he tells you the revelation of the
[1:53:42] Rapture how no how many knows God does
[1:53:44] things in threefold purposes
[1:53:47] when you're listening to the message of
[1:53:48] the seventh seal you'll hear something
[1:53:50] beautiful Brittany he'll say that
[1:53:52] there's three folds to the seventh seal
[1:53:53] in the seven seal book he'll say all
[1:53:56] Heaven quiet everything hushed up he
[1:53:58] says but think of it he opened it and
[1:54:00] then he'll say here's my revelation of
[1:54:03] it
[1:54:04] he said it was in a threefold purpose
[1:54:06] and I will tell you of a foal of it but
[1:54:09] the mark first time I heard that amen
[1:54:11] somebody said you can't prove it by the
[1:54:12] seven sealed book I said I think I can
[1:54:13] but we'll listen to it and so I listened
[1:54:16] to the to the seal and you know honestly
[1:54:18] brother bam didn't tell you what it was
[1:54:20] he just said he said you know he says
[1:54:23] well I'll tell you a fold of it
[1:54:27] and then so I'm listening to it and
[1:54:28] brother Amos I'm looking for him to tell
[1:54:29] me the scripture and kind of teach it
[1:54:31] out you know what it is they don't tell
[1:54:34] you he just starts talking about his own
[1:54:35] life he starts talking about Sabino
[1:54:36] Canyon about this vision of these angels
[1:54:39] and he starts talking about all these
[1:54:40] things and how they came so I rewounded
[1:54:42] and I listened to it again I thought
[1:54:44] well brother ma'am I appreciate what
[1:54:45] you're saying there but I thought she's
[1:54:46] going to tell us what the first four of
[1:54:48] the seven seal was
[1:54:49] and let's do it again
[1:54:51] and listen to it again
[1:54:53] then listen to it again
[1:54:55] and then I don't know maybe it was a
[1:54:57] hundredth time I said it's here he said
[1:54:59] he was going to tell us
[1:55:01] and I'm sitting here listening to it and
[1:55:02] then it hit me
[1:55:04] oh
[1:55:07] the word coming to the prophet
[1:55:11] was the first fold of the seventh seal
[1:55:16] oh my goodness
[1:55:19] it wasn't a Doctrine
[1:55:22] it was something God was doing in our
[1:55:24] generation bringing the word to a
[1:55:26] prophet because he had to speak it
[1:55:30] he had to say it it had to be spoken
[1:55:33] through the lips of a prophet it was
[1:55:35] sending angels and you know that broke
[1:55:38] into that pyramid maybe and maybe Andrew
[1:55:39] will get to it ain't gonna have time but
[1:55:41] it gets into the Pyramid of Junior
[1:55:42] Jackson and moves out there in that
[1:55:44] pyramid of seven angels and out of it
[1:55:46] comes the third pull the Sword and the
[1:55:48] Hand the word and brother Ben was
[1:55:50] talking about that third pull well then
[1:55:51] the next sermon he goes to Christ the
[1:55:53] mystery and he said it's in threefold
[1:55:55] right he said now the first foal of it
[1:55:57] is a revealing the second foal of it is
[1:56:00] the Revelation takes preeminence and the
[1:56:03] third is the changing or taking back to
[1:56:05] Eden so we have the seven seal in
[1:56:07] threefold we have Christ the mystery
[1:56:09] threefold and then when he comes to the
[1:56:11] Rapture he takes you to first
[1:56:12] Thessalonians 4 he says it's in
[1:56:14] threefold he said first we've got to
[1:56:17] shout and then we've got a voice just
[1:56:19] leave it up there we've got to shout he
[1:56:22] said then we got a voice he said then we
[1:56:24] got a trump the shout is the revealing
[1:56:27] of the word
[1:56:29] the voice is when the word revealed
[1:56:32] falls into the womb of the Bride
[1:56:35] and the and the son of that black calls
[1:56:38] the resurrection it's the voice and the
[1:56:41] trumpet is the very change of our body
[1:56:43] that's why we don't know at what point
[1:56:45] that's going to happen could be tonight
[1:56:49] could be this very hour somebody said
[1:56:51] well I thought something had to happen
[1:56:52] you know what brother Mann said it's the
[1:56:54] Readiness of the Bride
[1:56:55] he said that's all we're looking for is
[1:56:57] the Readiness of the Bride is that what
[1:56:59] he said he said when you know who you
[1:57:01] are
[1:57:03] this Rapture is going to go when this
[1:57:05] Revelation gets so prevalent over your
[1:57:08] life that you're done arguing with it
[1:57:10] when you're done arguing he said you're
[1:57:12] a son to begin with why do you want to
[1:57:15] argue with that just say yes I was a son
[1:57:18] to begin with you're the anointed
[1:57:20] children yeah I'm the anointed child of
[1:57:22] God you are The Virtuous sinless bride
[1:57:24] of Amen I'm The Virtuous sinless bride
[1:57:27] of Jesus Christ amen I tell you what I'm
[1:57:29] done arguing with this message I think
[1:57:31] we ought to believe it there's a miracle
[1:57:33] on it preach man there's a miracle on it
[1:57:37] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:57:39] angel the seventh seal brother man said
[1:57:41] would be pulled back what are we talking
[1:57:43] about three things the Rapture message
[1:57:45] I'm I'll try to hurry here the Rapture
[1:57:47] message a shout is the message going
[1:57:50] forth now I've been preaching this all
[1:57:52] all day all the services what I've been
[1:57:54] talking about
[1:57:55] the planning of the of the Rapture seed
[1:57:59] it had to be spoken through a dedicated
[1:58:02] Channel
[1:58:02] a shout what is a shout it's the message
[1:58:05] going forth the living bread of life
[1:58:08] bringing forth the bride God has a way
[1:58:11] of doing things he never changes his
[1:58:13] policy in Amos 3 and 7 he would do
[1:58:15] nothing on the earth until first he
[1:58:18] reveals it to his secrets of prophets
[1:58:19] it's the word first
[1:58:21] and then we believe it and it makes a
[1:58:23] change among y'all y'all stood there on
[1:58:26] the valley amen with Ezekiel you've
[1:58:28] stood there and and read that with him
[1:58:30] and you could hear the horror in the
[1:58:32] man's voice looking at such a vision and
[1:58:35] God's saying can they live can they live
[1:58:37] well no they can't live Lord but but he
[1:58:40] didn't say it like that he said you know
[1:58:41] y'all remember brother boom had a vision
[1:58:43] like that didn't he looked at a
[1:58:44] situation the Lord said can it be can
[1:58:46] they live can it be fixed and he said
[1:58:48] you know amen but Ezekiel Saw that
[1:58:51] condition there it was laying in a place
[1:58:53] where it couldn't come back but God said
[1:58:55] to him prophesy Prophet prophesy profit
[1:58:59] and let me say this we might not be
[1:59:01] prophets but we're prophetic people and
[1:59:04] the word of God has been placed in the
[1:59:06] voice of this bride I tell you it's time
[1:59:08] to prophesy it's time to prophesy this
[1:59:11] word over the church prophesy let me say
[1:59:15] it plain the message is the shout amen
[1:59:18] the shout of first Thessalonians 4 is
[1:59:21] the mess message of William Branham it
[1:59:23] is not the first poll it is not the
[1:59:26] second pull the shout is the third pull
[1:59:28] of William branham's Ministry no we
[1:59:31] don't have a first pull and no we don't
[1:59:33] have a second poll but we are the
[1:59:35] Vindication of the third pool of William
[1:59:38] Reynolds Ministry first two pulls was
[1:59:40] ministered in a cave
[1:59:42] brother Ron we've we've battled Giants
[1:59:44] all over the world ain't we and you know
[1:59:46] you've been told same as I've been told
[1:59:47] amen these works that I do greater work
[1:59:49] should I do shall be gone the father
[1:59:51] that was just brother random right I've
[1:59:53] been told that by many theologians and I
[1:59:55] say if you bumped your head
[1:59:57] and they say he's personal pronoun I
[1:59:59] said but it also says in John 5 24 he
[2:00:02] that believeth so it's that one is all
[2:00:04] of this only to one man but William
[2:00:06] random didn't preach it that way William
[2:00:08] Branham said he ministered the power of
[2:00:11] it back into the church come on now you
[2:00:13] say preacher what are you saying when I
[2:00:15] when I first started preaching the third
[2:00:16] pull in the bride I had somebody come
[2:00:18] say well I'll tell you if you got a
[2:00:20] third pull where's your first two and I
[2:00:22] just looked at him funny I thought well
[2:00:23] you know what third pull is do you so
[2:00:25] but I never say anything to him I just
[2:00:27] let it go and then I study him one day
[2:00:29] and the Lord spoke to me he said the
[2:00:31] first two was ministered by an Angel and
[2:00:33] had nothing to do with you in that
[2:00:35] manner but the third was the opening of
[2:00:37] the word which was the beginning of your
[2:00:39] change it was the beginning of your come
[2:00:41] on Church The Rapture is a spoken word
[2:00:44] manifestation and this spot holds the
[2:00:47] seed of the Rapture it's the third pool
[2:00:53] it's the third pull
[2:00:56] it's not the third push it's the third
[2:00:59] pull come on you ain't running this down
[2:01:02] it came and got you you're not trying to
[2:01:05] chase this Revelation it came and got
[2:01:07] you it pulled you out it brought you out
[2:01:10] it got you out of troubles and
[2:01:12] situations if you get in the ground it's
[2:01:15] gonna get you out of the ground it got
[2:01:17] you out of the graves of denomination
[2:01:19] this message coming to get you
[2:01:21] [Applause]
[2:01:24] my mama used to say the devil's gonna
[2:01:26] get you and I'll tell you why it was
[2:01:28] Jesus that got me
[2:01:31] I found out hey man you can't hide from
[2:01:34] Jesus if you got something on the inside
[2:01:35] of you
[2:01:36] [Applause]
[2:01:38] the third pool
[2:01:39] was the opening of that word
[2:01:42] if you're reading it in a church age
[2:01:43] book brother bam said the Bible said
[2:01:44] they called out once remember the
[2:01:46] Rapture is for the called out the
[2:01:48] Genesee he said they called out once he
[2:01:50] said or the summonsed ones
[2:01:53] he blessed is a man whom thou chooses
[2:01:56] and causeth to approach unto me that
[2:01:59] they might dwell in the in thy courts
[2:02:01] now let me just say this when William
[2:02:03] Branham calls this a summons it changes
[2:02:05] everything
[2:02:07] the Rapture is a summons
[2:02:11] anybody ever been to court
[2:02:13] anybody ever received a summons if you
[2:02:15] got come on gay you can preach this
[2:02:17] message right here strong you've served
[2:02:19] a bunch of mentioned hey man he served a
[2:02:22] bunch of summons he's a police officer
[2:02:23] and God bless him for his service let's
[2:02:25] put our hands together for this man of
[2:02:27] God I wish to all the police officers
[2:02:29] were good message believe in men of God
[2:02:31] Amen be some character back in the in
[2:02:34] the business amen but you but but if you
[2:02:37] serve a summons that's not a suggestion
[2:02:40] they they do not they do not suggest you
[2:02:44] to come to court
[2:02:46] they do not say look if you don't have
[2:02:47] anything else to do would you show up on
[2:02:50] this day but when a judge summons you
[2:02:52] there ain't no excuses you you I guess
[2:02:55] you could die amen but you're gonna go
[2:02:57] to court
[2:02:58] and the prophet of God said the message
[2:03:00] is a summons to you God is summonsing
[2:03:02] you well I tell you what amen am I not
[2:03:05] carrying that kind of badge but I got

[2:03:24] word of this age you have been summoned

[2:03:39] will change our mortal bodies ah
[2:03:43] goodness you say preacher how in the
[2:03:45] world how in the world is God attracting
[2:03:47] the church brother man said he fulfills
[2:03:49] his word
[2:03:50] when Thy word fulfills it is a Divine
[2:03:53] attraction or a summons upon the seed of
[2:03:57] God what happened on Mount sunset
[2:04:01] God confirmed his word that's what this
[2:04:03] noise is about God fulfilling the
[2:04:04] promised word what he said Revelations
[2:04:06] 10 1-7 If You Ever Wanted about a legal
[2:04:09] affidavit
[2:04:11] of your sermons read Revelation 10 1-7

[2:04:20] Church age fulfills Luke 17 30 and the
[2:04:24] day when the son of man is revealed when

[2:04:31] me and we'll run after thee amen the
[2:04:35] king hath brought me into his Chambers

[2:04:49] couldn't help but to run I didn't run
[2:04:51] from him no more I ran to him I ran into
[2:04:54] the presence of God two decisions in my
[2:04:56] life I have never regretted first one
[2:04:58] was I married that little girl Carissa
[2:05:00] Lawson that was a Wonder of my life and
[2:05:02] thank God for her she ain't here with me
[2:05:04] tonight stood by my side through many
[2:05:06] many hard trials and years she picked me
[2:05:09] up off of the floor a lot of times after
[2:05:11] me meetings just laid out there in
[2:05:13] unknown tongues in another dimension can
[2:05:15] you only know who I am or amen don't
[2:05:17] even know if I can get back to myself
[2:05:19] and her take my my clothes off and lay
[2:05:21] me in the bed and sit and rub my brow
[2:05:23] till I come back to myself amen special
[2:05:25] woman God gave me and never never ever
[2:05:27] regretted that decision to take her as a
[2:05:30] wife and the other decision I never
[2:05:32] regretted is one night I come to an
[2:05:34] Old-Fashioned Altar and God gave me the
[2:05:36] Holy Ghost and brother when he gave it
[2:05:38] to me I'll never take it back again I
[2:05:40] tell you amen it puts something in me I
[2:05:43] this world may fall apart but I love
[2:05:45] Jesus the world may fall apart this
[2:05:48] message is right every Church may fall
[2:05:51] every man may let you down but Jesus
[2:05:54] Christ is still a reality by this word
[2:05:57] in this generation
[2:05:59] sorry I talk like that in a minute I'll
[2:06:01] get kind of I'll get a little emotion on
[2:06:03] y'all but but look here look this is
[2:06:05] this stuff changed my life

[2:06:10] else's story folks

[2:06:15] calling you
[2:06:17] therefore the message has caused the
[2:06:19] bride together we now have the
[2:06:21] inspiration that'll call the bride to
[2:06:23] the elected God is calling y'all know
[2:06:25] that y'all know the breach remember
[2:06:26] brother man said when the seals are open
[2:06:28] he said he'll call for his bride to come
[2:06:30] and stand by his side
[2:06:33] this time though it'll call the dead out
[2:06:35] of the Grave come on them that's went
[2:06:37] and they're in the Seas that'll call
[2:06:39] them out of the Seas them laying over
[2:06:40] them Arenas this message will do it all
[2:06:42] it'll call them all out this is the
[2:06:45] Capstone Revelation to the elected amen
[2:06:48] this is the very thing brother random
[2:06:49] went out in the desert to get it to
[2:06:52] bring inspiration back to us I'm
[2:06:53] hurrying through these quotes he said
[2:06:55] see for the Gathering of the people
[2:06:57] that's right amen it's the anointing of
[2:07:00] this age it's the Gathering of the unity
[2:07:02] of the church under the word amen we're
[2:07:05] looking at Ruth's anointing Gathering to
[2:07:07] my last we're looking at rahab's
[2:07:10] anointing Gathering to Solomon we're
[2:07:12] looking at the bride's anointing
[2:07:14] gathering with this word it's uniting
[2:07:17] time brother man said the world is your
[2:07:19] 19 but the bride has another United Team
[2:07:21] she's uniting with that word heavens and
[2:07:24] earth shall pass away amen but she's
[2:07:26] uniting herself with thus saith the Lord
[2:07:30] oh I'll tell you I could I could walk
[2:07:33] pews right now
[2:07:35] she's uniting herself with thus saith
[2:07:37] the Lord what's the saith the Lord at
[2:07:39] this age not justification not
[2:07:41] sanctification not just the baptism of
[2:07:44] the spirit but the very change of our
[2:07:46] body is the very thing that a prophet
[2:07:49] has prophesied over this church shall be
[2:07:52] changed
[2:07:52] [Applause]
[2:07:54] we're uniting
[2:07:58] it's a uniting for the rapture
[2:08:01] y'all know y'all know when things are
[2:08:03] about to change
[2:08:04] the bees begin to swarm y'all know I
[2:08:07] mean y'all heard it
[2:08:09] I remember I was a little kid went out
[2:08:11] one day and he's a big beehive hanging
[2:08:12] out about my dad's at my dad's uh tree
[2:08:16] there and we kids we're fascinated with
[2:08:19] them bees just hanging offside that knot
[2:08:20] of that I think it was a big old oak
[2:08:21] tree there and dad dad had some buddies
[2:08:24] it would be guys and he called one and
[2:08:25] said what did I do and he said well he
[2:08:27] said I got a box here he said set that
[2:08:28] out back to your house and I'll come
[2:08:30] down we'll capture that we'll capture
[2:08:32] that uh that queen bee and we'll move
[2:08:34] her
[2:08:35] so they went after I remember as a
[2:08:37] little kid was in need of slang they
[2:08:39] found that queen bee and I don't know
[2:08:40] how they know her from I guess she's
[2:08:41] bigger or something I never I'm not a
[2:08:43] big guy but they moved at B out there to
[2:08:45] that house
[2:08:46] and brother it wasn't but a few hours
[2:08:49] when that bee moved
[2:08:51] all them bees found their way
[2:08:54] they moved right into that into that
[2:08:56] they swarmed right there in that Hive
[2:08:58] amen right around that because something
[2:09:00] was happened to United nobody told her
[2:09:03] where to go nobody told them how to get

[2:10:17] Time Amen to pack stuff around with you
[2:10:20] it's a time to lay aside every week that
[2:10:23] would beset you that you can fly into
[2:10:26] the heavens my goodness amen get lighter
[2:10:29] and lighter and lighter I tell you
[2:10:36] I've been I've been out there Brother
[2:10:38] Rich Cobb took me salmon fishing out in
[2:10:40] the out in the ocean
[2:10:42] hey man we didn't catch nothing
[2:10:45] we come in we come in and done some
[2:10:47] bottom fishing me and Zach caught our
[2:10:49] limit and everybody on the boat's limit
[2:10:52] they didn't know you got to be on the
[2:10:53] right side of the boat to catch fish
[2:10:55] they were all dragging their the boat
[2:10:58] was drifting they was all dragging their
[2:11:00] bottom weights you can't fish like that
[2:11:01] you know so Zach and I go to the other
[2:11:03] side and we cast and we fished and we
[2:11:05] were just nailing them they thought we
[2:11:06] was magicians
[2:11:09] no we were fishermen we caught our limit
[2:11:11] their limit the captain's limit
[2:11:13] everybody was they loved us you know
[2:11:18] but you know why they fish salmon in a
[2:11:20] certain season is because they gather in
[2:11:22] the ocean
[2:11:23] and they gather and they they get in
[2:11:26] groups we was just a little early but
[2:11:28] they're Gathering groups and those
[2:11:30] groups just as they gather the next
[2:11:32] thing they do
[2:11:33] is they turn and run up the river
[2:11:36] when they start seeing them gather out
[2:11:37] in the ocean the news will spread on the
[2:11:40] on the mainland and they say guys get
[2:11:42] your poles out they're fisting ahead for
[2:11:44] the rivers and they'll get a you know
[2:11:47] the Salmon's a little bit like walleye
[2:11:48] we have them up north and the wall I
[2:11:50] come up the rivers in the spring like
[2:11:52] March and April they'll come up in the
[2:11:54] rivers but you but you but you think you
[2:11:56] know that rain would disturb these guys
[2:11:59] but when it get a good rain they call it
[2:12:01] a push
[2:12:02] amen because they're sitting there
[2:12:04] waiting they need a little water to move
[2:12:06] and when you get a good rain all of them
[2:12:09] just starts moving together in that rain
[2:12:11] now look Church we've had a gathering
[2:12:15] amen but I feel them a lot of rains
[2:12:16] falling up on the church
[2:12:18] and there's another push into the word
[2:12:20] there's another there's another there's
[2:12:22] another thrust of the spirit of God
[2:12:24] pulling the church into it amen amen
[2:12:27] because when you see them Gathering it's
[2:12:29] time to go it's time to go you know uh
[2:12:32] I'll say this I I I've years ago I was
[2:12:36] preaching on this on this third pull and
[2:12:38] I was reading where brother Branham says
[2:12:40] he says that actually he says that it
[2:12:42] was a fishing vision
[2:12:45] hey I understood that man I you know I
[2:12:48] understood that when he said that it was
[2:12:49] a pool I get what he means he means he's
[2:12:51] got a bait on him he's got a bait on a a
[2:12:53] a a a line and when he pulls it that's
[2:12:57] what makes it attract you know like if
[2:12:59] you if you're fishing and and you're
[2:13:01] just carrying the bait sometimes don't
[2:13:02] do much but when you when you pull it
[2:13:04] it'll it'll flutter like that and the
[2:13:07] flutter will catch the sunshine and the
[2:13:08] fish will sit and they'll get it it
[2:13:10] looks like a live fish and you know when
[2:13:12] he pulled it he said that first time he
[2:13:15] said it was just little fish and he said
[2:13:16] he pulled it he said then it was just
[2:13:18] bigger fish he said but when he pulled
[2:13:21] it that third time
[2:13:22] he said the little fish got away from it
[2:13:27] he said and that's what attracted that
[2:13:30] big fish
[2:13:32] [Music]
[2:13:33] now brother Branham he was a prophecy
[2:13:36] but in the end he got off
[2:13:39] see his teachings got bad and and and
[2:13:41] the Pentecostals in them they had to get
[2:13:43] away from him but
[2:13:45] but that's what attracted you
[2:13:48] yeah
[2:13:50] you must be that big fish oh
[2:13:54] wow
[2:13:55] how many knows brother Bram caught the
[2:13:57] world record rainbow trout at one time
[2:13:59] it was it was at least the national
[2:14:00] champion
[2:14:02] world uh rainbow trout
[2:14:06] I think it was a symbol
[2:14:08] of another fish he caught
[2:14:11] a trophy bride
[2:14:13] with seven colors running through her
[2:14:17] what was it he hooked her
[2:14:19] with that third pull
[2:14:23] see when you took the seed of the word
[2:14:26] raptures in you amen no different than
[2:14:30] when a when a fish riches up and grabs
[2:14:32] the bait
[2:14:33] he thought he was getting the bait he
[2:14:35] got a journey into the boat
[2:14:38] and when you took this message maybe
[2:14:40] you've thought for a better life or you
[2:14:43] thought for a better way or it was
[2:14:44] something that attracted you but when
[2:14:46] the hook got set
[2:14:48] come on when the hook got said it was
[2:14:50] God setting a hook into you and you
[2:14:52] wasn't just taking it for a little
[2:14:54] something you might not know why you
[2:14:55] took it but God made you take it because
[2:14:58] he's taken you on a journey
[2:15:01] come on now I'm a little bit of a
[2:15:03] fisherman I know I know the best
[2:15:05] fisherman of all is one that it's one
[2:15:07] thing to hook a fish folks I've been
[2:15:09] salmon fishing up Michigan and we we
[2:15:11] hooked a bunch of fish and I was fishing
[2:15:13] with a bunch of guys and we had a we had
[2:15:15] to fish with a with a uh we had to fish
[2:15:17] with a barbless hook and it has to be a
[2:15:19] certain size so they don't want you
[2:15:20] snagging them you know and so we had
[2:15:22] these little flies and 17 pound test
[2:15:25] leaders on our rods and threw them after
[2:15:27] we'd hook him salmon and you'd hook into
[2:15:29] them in just a few minutes pow he'd
[2:15:31] break them it wasn't hard to hook one of
[2:15:33] them but they was maybe catching one
[2:15:35] ever six or eight or ten hookups and I
[2:15:38] told Zach I said well we're gonna have
[2:15:39] to do something some we got to listen to
[2:15:41] drags on our poles I said we're fishing
[2:15:43] to catch one not to hook one so I said
[2:15:46] loosen the drag a little and then we had
[2:15:48] hook except we're bending I said you're
[2:15:49] gonna buy a better hook and tie your own
[2:15:51] entire own flies so he tied us some
[2:15:53] flies with a good strong little hook and
[2:15:56] we we loosened the drag a little and we
[2:15:58] took it from one to eight and ten until
[2:16:00] we caught nearly everything we hooked
[2:16:02] because we wouldn't just wanting to hook
[2:16:04] something we wanted to catch something
[2:16:05] and God is not looking just to hook
[2:16:08] something he's looking to catch
[2:16:10] something and I tell you what he done he
[2:16:11] caught him a bride and he's going to
[2:16:13] catch her away in the moon in the
[2:16:15] twinkling of an eye this bride's going
[2:16:17] to move from the Waters of life into the
[2:16:19] she's going to turn into another
[2:16:21] dimensional creature you know what I'm
[2:16:23] talking about you've been hooked for it
[2:16:24] Church come on you never caught this
[2:16:27] message this message caught you they
[2:16:30] meant no trout ever caught affect you
[2:16:32] never seen a bass flopping on the bank

[2:16:36] job catching you no amen that bass got
[2:16:39] caught and that trout got caught and
[2:16:41] that salmon got caught the same way you
