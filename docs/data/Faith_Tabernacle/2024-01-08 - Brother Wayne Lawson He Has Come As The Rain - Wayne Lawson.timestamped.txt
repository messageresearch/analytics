[35:53] Revival it takes the people to pull on
[35:56] the the gift and when you're hungering

[36:03] looking for God to move I promise you he
[36:07] will meet your need amen and no matter

[36:28] doctors can't do God come down and done
[36:31] it things that people just don't know
[36:33] what to do and how to do it we've seen

[42:49] Psalms 139 verse
[42:51] 14 to verse
[42:55] 17
[42:57] and I will praise
[42:59] thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully
[43:02] made marvelous are thy works and that my
[43:07] soul knoweth right
[43:09] well my substance was not hid from thee
[43:13] when I was made in secret and curiously
[43:16] wrought in the lowest parts of the earth
[43:19] th eyes did see my
[43:21] substance yet being
[43:23] unperfect and in thy book all all my
[43:26] members were written a't that amazing
[43:30] amen that David was all written out in
[43:32] the scripture before he ever come to the
[43:34] Earth and in thy book was all the
[43:37] members written which in countenance
[43:40] were fashioned when as yet they were
[43:42] none of them how precious also are thy
[43:46] thoughts unto me oh God how great is the
[43:50] sum of them let's also look in the book
[43:53] of
[43:54] Hosea the 6th chapter Hosea chapter 6
[43:58] and verse
[44:01] one
[44:02] come and let us return to the Lord he
[44:06] have torn and he will heal us and he has
[44:09] smitten and he will bind us
[44:11] up and after two days will he revive us
[44:16] and in the third day he will raise us up
[44:18] and we shall live in his sight now
[44:21] brother Bram said we're well into that
[44:22] third day now it was about 2700 years
[44:26] ago this prophecy was made brother said
[44:28] here we are moving into that third day
[44:30] and of course this is speaking Hosea to
[44:33] Israel but I love how that the
[44:36] fellowship between Israel and the
[44:39] Gentiles are tied together in Prophecy
[44:42] because the Gentiles had to fulfill
[44:44] certain portions before the Israelites
[44:46] can fulfill their portion and so they
[44:48] moved together in Prophecy amen now he
[44:52] says then shall we know if we follow on
[44:56] to know the Lord his going forth is
[44:59] prepared as the morning and he shall
[45:02] come unto us as the
[45:05] rain as the latter and the former rain
[45:09] unto the earth now tonight I would like
[45:12] to speak to you a little while I'm going
[45:13] to take that last portion of that and
[45:16] I'm just going to say it like this he
[45:19] has come unto us as the rain let's just
[45:23] bow our hearts father we thank you
[45:25] tonight tonight for your word we thank
[45:28] you for these men of God that have
[45:29] gathered in this building Lord for these
[45:31] saints that have gathered around your
[45:33] word we thank you Lord that there's a
[45:35] place established Lord that still
[45:37] believes you and loves you and Lord as
[45:40] your message is being sent into all the
[45:42] Earth lord it's catching hearts and
[45:45] lives and father we have gathered in
[45:48] this building tonight to assemble
[45:49] ourselves around that Lord father maybe
[45:52] some even watching tonight on the video
[45:55] and things Lord and maybe later they'll
[45:57] see these things but dear God we're
[45:59] asking you that may you come here in
[46:02] this visible audience tonight Lord and
[46:04] may you touch the needs these people
[46:06] have driven they've put aside their time
[46:08] through this week Lord and we just ask
[46:11] you now that you would take your servant
[46:13] Lord you would use us for your glory and
[46:15] your honor and Lord that you would speak
[46:17] to the need now Lord we ask you bless
[46:20] this community and all that Lord is in
[46:22] the reach of this word we pray in the
[46:24] name of Jesus Christ amen and amen and
[46:28] God bless you as you could be seated
[46:30] tonight I want to take just a few
[46:31] minutes here amen for he has come unto
[46:35] us as the rain um I I certainly trust
[46:40] that uh that we uh realize that this is
[46:45] such a beautiful hour of the hour of the
[46:48] great bride's Revival amen and I uh am
[46:52] one of those who contend to the reality
[46:54] that we're not looking for Revival that
[46:57] we are the Fulfillment of Revival and I
[47:01] love how brother bam said and how could
[47:02] I overcome he said now I chose this
[47:05] because I think that it's time that we
[47:07] should never let the spirit of Revival
[47:10] die right we've got to keep in Revival
[47:13] constantly revived every day Paul said
[47:16] he had to Die daily that Christ could
[47:18] live and we must never let this this
[47:21] revival die within us now this revival
[47:25] is not dying but we don't know what to
[47:27] die within us we got to constantly
[47:29] brother BR said keep this in Revival now
[47:33] I believe specifically that this is a
[47:36] season uh that would be a chance or an
[47:38] opportunity for the believer some are
[47:40] the church age brother Brandon will say
[47:41] this he said here we are coming to a
[47:44] conclusion as the Eternal logos God was
[47:47] manifest in the Sun and in Jesus dwelt
[47:50] all the fullness of the godhead bodily
[47:52] and that Eternal one was the father
[47:54] manifest In the Flesh there thereby
[47:56] gained the title of son even so we
[47:59] Eternal in his thoughts in our turn
[48:03] somebody say our turn in our turn became
[48:07] the many membered spoken word seed
[48:11] manifest In the Flesh and these Eternal
[48:14] thoughts now manifest in his flesh are
[48:17] the sons of God even as we are soall we
[48:22] did not become seed by rebirth we were
[48:26] seed and therefore were reborned for
[48:29] only the elect can be reborn because we
[48:32] were seed is the reason we could be
[48:35] quickened nonseed there is nothing to
[48:38] Quicken now David says in Psalms 139
[48:42] that my substance was not hid from thee
[48:45] and I was made in secret and I was
[48:47] curiously wrought my substance there was
[48:48] something of David that was existent in
[48:51] God there was something that was not hid
[48:53] from God and brother Ram said it was in
[48:55] our turn that we become the many
[48:57] membered spoken word be in other words
[48:59] that there was a turn the church has a
[49:01] turn to become that part of God that
[49:04] would be expressed and David would say
[49:06] here that my substance was not hid from
[49:08] thee when I was made in secret and
[49:10] curiously rod in the lowest parts of the
[49:11] Earth for Thine Eyes did see my
[49:14] substance yet being unperfect but in thy
[49:17] book all my members were written and in
[49:20] countenance were fashioned as it were
[49:22] none of them how precious are thy
[49:24] thoughts unto us how precious are thy
[49:28] thoughts now what's David is saying Lord
[49:30] I was in your mind eternally because
[49:32] brother B going tell us this that the
[49:35] elect have an eternal quality under them
[49:38] that the thoughts of God are real and
[49:40] they are Eternal amen so as in the mind
[49:43] of God you are Eternal in the mind of
[49:46] God and and David begin to say Lord that
[49:49] thought of me oh how precious Lord are
[49:52] thy thoughts unto me when you begin to
[49:54] see it now I I realize this I realize
[49:57] that there is no such thing as Eternal
[50:00] sunship amen how many knows hey brother
[50:02] maram said see there's no thing s such
[50:05] thing like that there's no Eternal
[50:07] sunship he said that's where the Roman
[50:08] Catholics went into error he said they
[50:10] tried to make Eternal son he said the
[50:12] word son he said think about it it's a
[50:14] created being it's not amen it's not an
[50:17] eternal son he said it never was eternal
[50:19] sunship amen but you see it's not the
[50:22] Eternal son Eternal sunship like
[50:26] but there is an eternal
[50:28] son in other words sons are Eternal amen
[50:32] now watch because the scripture will
[50:34] tell us amen that the Eternal son see
[50:37] there cannot be Eternal because you have
[50:39] beginnings and endings that which
[50:40] beginning is not Eternal and if you
[50:43] maybe but if you would mold it out of
[50:46] something Eternal then you would have an
[50:49] eternal substance in other words other
[50:51] words if you could look at something you
[50:52] take a brother Bam's thought on
[50:54] Michelangelo and you look at that great
[50:56] uh uh substance that was made Moses was
[50:58] made now now that that was not even made
[51:01] till am me you know in the late hundreds
[51:03] and and brother bam saw it and then he
[51:05] told us about it but he couldn't look at
[51:07] that and say that was an eternal image
[51:09] or he couldn't say that was a a thousand
[51:11] years old or a million years old because
[51:13] Michelangelo made it right amen but you
[51:16] see but the granite that he made it out
[51:18] of that Granite was as old as the
[51:21] creation of the heavens and the Earth
[51:23] and you recognize tonight that as Sons
[51:26] maybe well I'm but just take me I'm 50
[51:28] years old amen but what I'm created out
[51:31] of is as Eternal as the god that created
[51:34] me brother said the sons of God are made
[51:37] out of Eternity they are as Eternal as
[51:40] God is eternal amen because they've been
[51:42] formed from Eternal substance the
[51:45] thoughts of God are real and they are
[51:47] Eternal you're not just you're not just
[51:49] an afterthought of God this isn't like
[51:52] the second thought of God this isn't
[51:54] just something that he come up with but
[51:56] in the beginning he B you in his mind
[51:58] and you're as Eternal as God is eternal
[52:01] but the word has now form that eternity
[52:04] into a human being and now I'm 50 year
[52:07] old and I'm Eternal amen because there's
[52:10] two beings and don't you ever forget
[52:12] amen I know we're 50 years old maybe
[52:15] however old you are and you look at your
[52:17] own self and you think about amen your
[52:19] age and you think about all these things
[52:21] that's happened in your age amen but
[52:23] don't you ever forget about the deity
[52:25] part of your life don't you forget about
[52:27] the Eternal part of your life amen that
[52:29] which had no beginning and had no end
[52:32] that part that was eternal before the
[52:34] foundations of the world I love it when
[52:36] the prophet of God begins to tell us
[52:38] about being predestinated in the mind of
[52:40] God and not only we were predestinated
[52:42] but we are a part of God and that's why
[52:45] we are a many member spoken word seed
[52:47] bride amen I I say this part there is an
[52:50] eternal soul in every believer and I
[52:53] believe that that is substance is an
[52:55] eternal substance amen if we had about
[52:58] an hour on that it'd be beautiful
[53:00] Eternal thought
[53:02] substance That's What You're Made Of is
[53:04] eternal thought substance do you
[53:07] recognize now somebody said well brother
[53:09] Wayne what then is the difference
[53:10] between us in Jesus I'm glad you ask
[53:13] brother randam says it like this he says
[53:15] we bypassed arth theophany he said and
[53:18] we come to the Earth he said but here is
[53:21] where we are tempted amen and brother
[53:24] man will teach us he'll say he'll say
[53:26] things like this he say see we were
[53:28] supposed to been born there he said but
[53:30] we wasn't born there we were born in
[53:32] this time element He said and we
[53:34] bypassed our theophany amen but what is
[53:37] the word come for the word has come to
[53:39] birth us and put us back in the same
[53:42] place amen that we should have been
[53:44] before we fail in the Garden of Eden
[53:47] friend the way back amen is that Eternal
[53:50] logos come on church and that Eternal
[53:53] logos is not the second person of the
[53:55] godhead it is God himself known to you
[53:59] as the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[54:01] you're as Eternal as God as Eternal when
[54:04] eternity has come into you I know amen
[54:06] that just tears the legalist up but
[54:08] listen amen there's a soul inside of you
[54:11] that come from God and it will return to
[54:14] God you are the Eternal Gene attribute
[54:17] of almighty God that's why you believe
[54:19] this message that's why you believe this
[54:21] word that's why you're here tonight
[54:23] that's what settled in your soul
[54:25] that's why you made up your mind and
[54:27] that's why you will not fail to get back
[54:30] to where God made you to be because the
[54:32] word of God will never fail because God
[54:36] who is rich in Mercy has made these
[54:38] things for you and I and distribute Us
[54:40] in the power of God I think of this I
[54:43] think of God dealing with us in this age
[54:46] that there is no Eternal sunship of
[54:48] course but there is an eternal God
[54:51] living in his
[54:54] sons
[54:55] so what you're made out of I ain't made
[54:57] out of
[54:59] granite you're made from
[55:02] eternity that's a quote by the way what
[55:05] God does off of God when he created in
[55:08] the beginning what do he have to work
[55:10] with eternity see the Eternal sunship
[55:14] see now do you see that that is an
[55:16] eternal God in his son I love it how
[55:22] precious are thy thoughts unto me can
[55:26] you imagine amen seeing yourself in the
[55:29] scriptures the same as God created the
[55:32] heavens and the Earth your substance is
[55:36] in the Eternal Word of God When I See
[55:40] This I see David knowing the power of
[55:43] the thoughts of God no wonder Jeremiah
[55:46] and 29 you you all love this one it's a
[55:48] a great favor to many people Amen in the
[55:51] 11th verse he said I Know Thy thoughts
[55:54] that I think toward the sayith the Lord
[55:56] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[55:58] give you an expected end isn't that
[56:02] beautiful y'all remember this is
[56:03] Jeremiah amen This is Jeremiah 29 now
[56:06] you know they've been carried off into
[56:08] Babylon they've been carried out of
[56:09] their home country and it seems like
[56:12] that God must have bad intentions toward
[56:15] Israel because they've lost a place of
[56:17] worship everything's went wrong amen it
[56:19] just looks horrible it looks like that
[56:21] God wouldn't be for them but then he
[56:23] causes Jeremiah to say to them I know
[56:25] the thought I think hold you you you see
[56:28] because now watch this because we always
[56:31] give motive to other people's actions
[56:33] right and and and if if y'all's like me
[56:36] usually you give a bad motive I had to
[56:39] totally retrain my way of thinking you
[56:41] know if I see two people stand talking I
[56:43] used to I used to be so uh what they
[56:45] call complexed I used to have such a
[56:47] complex I couldn't go to a football game
[56:49] cuz every time they huddled I thought
[56:50] they talking about
[56:53] me but you you know what the prophet
[56:55] said he said when you see people doing
[56:57] that he said just assume they're getting
[56:59] talking about what they're going to get
[57:00] you for your birthday or what they're
[57:01] going to get you for Christmas or he man
[57:03] that they're talking about something
[57:04] good they're going to do to you see you
[57:06] got to turn that thinking around and and
[57:08] when something happens in your life
[57:10] you're just sure that God's upset with
[57:12] you or that something's going to happen
[57:14] but don't never forget the scripture and
[57:16] the scripture tells us that we're sons
[57:18] of prosperity we're Daughters of
[57:20] prosperity and the Bible said all things
[57:23] work together for the good of them that
[57:24] love God and are called according to
[57:26] their purpose you tell that Old Devil
[57:28] amen listen I ain't got no time to fool
[57:30] with you amen God's thoughts towards me
[57:33] are peace and of good and not of evil
[57:36] for he said so in his own word amen and
[57:39] his thoughts are precious unto me
[57:42] because when God begins to reveal his
[57:43] thought that's when love begins to
[57:45] strike your heart to know that he had
[57:48] you in his mind before the foundation of
[57:50] the world and everything that's ever
[57:52] happened in the world has happened
[57:54] happed around the revelation of who you
[57:56] would be in this generation and when you
[57:59] would come listen church I think it's
[58:01] beautiful for I know the thoughts that I
[58:03] think towards you do you know God before
[58:05] they left before they see see you you
[58:08] yall know the history lesson of course
[58:10] it it was when Israel left Jerusalem to
[58:12] they tore down the walls and They
[58:14] carried them into Babylon they're going
[58:15] to be there for 70 years right amen but
[58:18] before they ever left Jeremiah had
[58:21] already prophesied their return before
[58:23] they ever left I Isaiah had already
[58:26] prophesied the return Jeremiah had
[58:28] already told him you'll be there for 70
[58:30] years and then you shall return do you
[58:33] see but God already had in his mind that
[58:36] the glory that you have now will not
[58:39] even be compared with the glory you'll
[58:41] have at a later time when I'm done with
[58:44] you you'll see my thoughts every thought
[58:46] that I have had has been for your good
[58:49] and it has been for your prosperity and
[58:52] God's purpose and will in your life is
[58:55] to prosper you in health is to prosper
[58:57] you in life it's the will of God that
[58:59] you would have life and truth and you
[59:02] would have an abundantly in his presence
[59:04] for I know the thought I think towards
[59:06] you saith the Lord thought of peace and
[59:08] not of evil to them amen to give them
[59:10] expected in this is the area when they
[59:12] come back when they come return to the
[59:14] to the temple this is where it is said
[59:16] and he guy remember when they're
[59:17] restoring the temple some people are
[59:19] disappointed with it remember that and
[59:21] they're disappointed with it and they
[59:22] said well the glory of this second
[59:23] temple is not quite as good as the glory
[59:26] of the first temple but the Bible said
[59:28] the glory of this lighter house shall be
[59:31] greater than the former amen sayith the
[59:34] Lord of hosts and in this place I will
[59:36] give peace sayith the Lord of hosts the
[59:38] glory of the second temple was greater
[59:41] than the glory of the first temple now
[59:43] people talk about three temples but just
[59:45] for Bible History there's only actually
[59:47] two temples there was Solomon's Temple
[59:49] tore down and then rebuilt again amen
[59:52] but that Temple that was rebuilt and in
[59:54] the days of zerubabel that Temple was
[59:57] not as glorious in its look amen but
[59:59] later it was kind of spruced up amen
[1:00:02] amen and and then they called it uh
[1:00:04] what's his name King King herod's Temple
[1:00:07] and they restored that Temple so they
[1:00:09] call it three actually it's only two
[1:00:10] temples but it was remodeled the last
[1:00:12] time but he was telling us that the
[1:00:15] glory of the latter would be greater
[1:00:17] than the glory of the first now what was
[1:00:19] the glory of that Temple of Solomon this
[1:00:21] was the glory when they said the word in
[1:00:24] the house of God the Bible said the
[1:00:26] glory of the Lord filled the temple
[1:00:28] where they were s so they couldn't even
[1:00:29] Minister and the shakol light came down
[1:00:32] and it dwelt as a midst in the children
[1:00:35] and back there where they couldn't see
[1:00:37] it hid behind the curtains over the word
[1:00:40] of God there was a glory that settled
[1:00:43] there over that word and it remained
[1:00:45] there but it was hidden from the eye of
[1:00:47] the people but in that latter Temple the
[1:00:50] Bible said in the Book of Malachi I
[1:00:52] think it's powerful things in the book
[1:00:54] of of Malachi it said for the Lord whom
[1:00:57] you seek shall suddenly come to his
[1:00:59] Temple and one day they knew that that
[1:01:02] same Shak Glory was going to take a
[1:01:05] flesh body and they said and we beheld
[1:01:08] him as the only begotten and the glory
[1:01:11] of God the word became flesh and when
[1:01:14] the word became flesh it was the visible
[1:01:17] glory of the almighty God and Jesus was
[1:01:20] the glory of God oh but Church of the
[1:01:22] Living God this Bri is the glory of
[1:01:26] Jesus Christ amen we are not looking at
[1:01:28] the pillar of fire tonight as a light
[1:01:31] above the crowd but I see the word that
[1:01:34] is joined with the power of God and now
[1:01:37] the glory is greater than it was
[1:01:42] before and we beheld his glory they saw
[1:01:45] it amen as the only begotten Son of God
[1:01:49] they have Jesus said if you have seen me
[1:01:52] come on you have seen
[1:01:55] my
[1:01:56] father oh my the glory of the latter was
[1:02:01] greater than the glory of the first for
[1:02:04] the Lord whom you seek just suddenly
[1:02:07] come to this Temple and when he stepped
[1:02:10] into the door they didn't even know him
[1:02:12] but the glory of the latter house was
[1:02:14] the word had become flesh oh my come on
[1:02:18] church we look back there and we see
[1:02:20] that first day of Pentecost and we see
[1:02:22] him filled in the upper room we see the
[1:02:25] power of God come and we talk about it
[1:02:27] and we talk about it and we look at
[1:02:29] what's happening today and we don't see
[1:02:31] it as glorious as what it was in that
[1:02:34] day but let me let me say this to you
[1:02:36] tonight the glory of this latter house
[1:02:39] it shall be greater than the glory the
[1:02:40] former house amen because the word that
[1:02:44] was given to the Thessalonians that the
[1:02:46] Lord in say should descend from a heaven
[1:02:48] and there'll be a change in our body in
[1:02:50] the Corinthians it was prophesied that
[1:02:52] they would rais up in death will be
[1:02:54] swalled in Victory and the glory of the
[1:02:57] lateral house that first church it come
[1:03:00] to its Perfection but God put it in the
[1:03:02] ground as a seed and they were planted
[1:03:05] in the ground but that latter house the
[1:03:08] glory of this latter house is the word
[1:03:11] would be fulfilled in the house of God
[1:03:14] oh Church of the Living God I tell you
[1:03:17] tell the devil get out of the way amen
[1:03:19] the darkness has come upon the Earth and
[1:03:21] gross Darkness but his thoughts they are
[1:03:24] precious unto me because I know what God
[1:03:27] is
[1:03:29] thinking oh these bad things happening
[1:03:32] Brother Wayne God must hate us to put us
[1:03:34] in this age I know what he's thinking
[1:03:37] he's already told the devil I got one I
[1:03:39] can trust you can try this eve every
[1:03:43] which way you can try amen but I got an
[1:03:45] eve that will not fail because she is
[1:03:48] the word
[1:03:50] itself Hallelujah you talk about a
[1:03:52] precious thought tonight
[1:03:55] how
[1:03:57] precious how precious are his
[1:04:00] thoughts unto me oh my for my word my
[1:04:07] word my thoughts they're known unto me
[1:04:10] he says don't tell me how I feel about
[1:04:13] you I know how I feel about you isn't
[1:04:16] that
[1:04:17] powerful the thoughts of peace and not
[1:04:21] of
[1:04:21] evil now there's some uh uh some people
[1:04:26] I don't
[1:04:28] know I'm not picking on anyone
[1:04:31] specifically I just mean thoughts there
[1:04:34] are thoughts that somehow the message is
[1:04:37] different than the Bible right which has
[1:04:40] been a great insult to the
[1:04:43] message people say well had you rather
[1:04:46] take the message or had you rather take
[1:04:48] scripture well then you're suggesting
[1:04:51] that the message is somehow outside the
[1:04:53] scripture amen come on which is a great
[1:04:56] insult and people say well you want
[1:04:59] Paul's gospel or brother bram's gospel
[1:05:01] well let me say this Jesus amen don't
[1:05:04] have another gospel and Paul said I'm
[1:05:07] I'm surprised that you've been removed
[1:05:09] to another gospel being there is not
[1:05:11] another gospel there isn't another
[1:05:14] gospel somebody said well then do we
[1:05:17] understand P Paul didn't listen there
[1:05:18] were things revealed in Paul's day that
[1:05:21] light didn't come on it to this day but
[1:05:23] the same as in Genesis 3 when Jesus was
[1:05:27] being prophesied as the woman's seed the
[1:05:30] prophecy was already there but later it
[1:05:33] was told to Abraham he would be
[1:05:34] Abraham's seed it was not a different
[1:05:37] prophecy it was a furtherance of the
[1:05:39] Revelation and whatever Paul spoke in
[1:05:42] the gospels is the same thing we believe
[1:05:44] tonight but the seven seal has opened up
[1:05:47] and showed us the Revelation that God
[1:05:50] had in his mind before the foundation of
[1:05:52] the world then this Bible is the
[1:05:54] complete Cannon of the revelation of
[1:05:56] Jesus Christ and with a prophet standing
[1:05:59] there as an anointed eye we can see
[1:06:01] every action of the Bride is already
[1:06:03] written in the Bible this is a Bible
[1:06:06] bride this is a word believing bride we
[1:06:09] are not some illegitimate come by the
[1:06:11] side denomination we're the only real
[1:06:14] word church that's left on the earth
[1:06:17] don't have to tear out one page of the
[1:06:19] Bible I don't have to make one word of
[1:06:21] the Bible my baptism is Paul's bapt ISM
[1:06:24] predestination is Paul's predestination
[1:06:27] I preached the Rapture the same way Paul
[1:06:29] preached it come on church but we didn't
[1:06:32] understand it until God sent an anointed
[1:06:35] Eagle in this
[1:06:36] [Applause]
[1:06:39] age so I put an idea out there that
[1:06:43] somehow this message is different than
[1:06:45] the Bible it's probably the greatest
[1:06:47] insult ever given to William
[1:06:52] Brandon could you give me just a few
[1:06:54] minutes and anything brother brand
[1:06:56] priest I can show it to you in
[1:06:59] scripture and if I can I'm going to pray
[1:07:01] till I can cuz I know it's
[1:07:03] there I don't mean that arrogantly I
[1:07:06] mean that I know what the prophet
[1:07:09] taught
[1:07:11] amen now here's how he would teach the
[1:07:14] Bible every word in the Bible is God's
[1:07:17] thoughts laid in seed
[1:07:22] form now if you can see that it's a seed
[1:07:25] form then you recognize the maturity the
[1:07:28] seed was not always spoke of okay
[1:07:32] Abraham I will deliver thee with a
[1:07:33] mighty
[1:07:35] hand they didn't know Moses's
[1:07:39] name when God told Moses to go down and
[1:07:42] deliver the children he didn't know
[1:07:43] Janice and jambers was going to show
[1:07:46] up it was in the seed
[1:07:50] though but as it began to develop you
[1:07:52] seen a fuller revelation of what had
[1:07:55] been laid in
[1:07:57] seed now watch the scripture for every
[1:08:00] word in the Bible is God thoughts laid
[1:08:02] in seed form that it received into the
[1:08:04] human
[1:08:05] being and spoke by the same thought that
[1:08:09] materialize the Bible it brings the
[1:08:12] thing to
[1:08:13] pass see what I mean how powerful could
[1:08:17] the church be the Bible said let the
[1:08:20] mind that was in Christ be in you amen
[1:08:24] and as a man thinketh in his heart so is
[1:08:28] he now your thoughts they become
[1:08:33] expression the water of Separation he
[1:08:36] says you got to die to every thought of
[1:08:37] the flesh so that you can receive the
[1:08:40] mind of Christ and walk from hence forth
[1:08:43] not of your own but of his mind the mind
[1:08:48] of Christ in you that's the only way to
[1:08:52] stay alive woo that's the only way for
[1:08:55] you to remain alive in this age is the
[1:08:58] word has got to live in you it's the
[1:09:00] only living Force there is listen what
[1:09:03] he says that's the only way I can stay
[1:09:06] alive all I live by is by the Holy
[1:09:09] Spirit God said Jesus said man shall not
[1:09:12] live by let alone but by every word that
[1:09:15] proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[1:09:17] brother man will say in 1954 he'll say
[1:09:20] if your heart and mind is so and filled
[1:09:22] with the God's spirit until your thought
[1:09:24] become his thought there you are when
[1:09:27] your mind and your leading and your
[1:09:29] guiding becomes a direct place or a
[1:09:32] direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[1:09:35] that's moving the Mortal being what kind
[1:09:37] of people would we be the Holy Spirit
[1:09:39] has embodied or empowered that you don't
[1:09:42] use your own thoughts you don't use your
[1:09:44] own mind you don't use your own opinion
[1:09:46] oh God he he's bringing her down there
[1:09:49] ain't it now folks that's that's the
[1:09:51] real that's the real line right there
[1:09:54] the word our thought and it takes a lot
[1:09:56] of dying to stay on that word he said
[1:10:00] tell your thoughts and your being is
[1:10:02] God's spirit expressing itself through
[1:10:04] you what kind of church would be we what
[1:10:06] kind of people would be be this morning
[1:10:08] if brandom Tabernacle was so filled with
[1:10:10] the presence of God when you didn't even
[1:10:13] use your own mind didn't use your own
[1:10:17] thoughts you didn't have an alternative
[1:10:20] of your own you were just led by the
[1:10:23] spirit amen my goodness amen what's he
[1:10:26] saying you got to die to every thought
[1:10:28] of your flesh so that you can receive
[1:10:31] the mind of Christ and walk henceforth
[1:10:34] not of your own but of his mind the mind
[1:10:36] of Christ that's in you that's the only
[1:10:39] way see that's the only way that you can
[1:10:41] stay alive now somebody said well
[1:10:43] brother Wayne but I got I got some ideas
[1:10:45] here I love how brother Bram says this
[1:10:48] he says you think question mark he said
[1:10:50] see but you ain't got no think coming
[1:10:54] come on sounds sounds pressure don't it
[1:10:56] you ain't got no think coming he's not
[1:10:59] he's not trying to belittle you he's
[1:11:02] trying to exalt you because it's your
[1:11:05] thinking that keeps you out of the
[1:11:07] Eternal part of God's mind everything
[1:11:10] God thinks about you is eternal
[1:11:13] everything that you think about you is
[1:11:15] through your expressions and your family
[1:11:17] and your failures and your human life
[1:11:20] amen but you see if you don't got no
[1:11:22] thought coming and God's expressed his
[1:11:24] thoughts and you ain't got no right to
[1:11:26] think then let the mind of Christ come
[1:11:28] into you and he purposed and done the
[1:11:30] will of God if I do not the works then
[1:11:32] don't believe me see you ain't got no
[1:11:34] think coming he's the one that does the
[1:11:37] thinking let his mind come into you the
[1:11:41] same as it's in that word woo Glory I
[1:11:45] tell you what we're going to have to do
[1:11:46] we got to get outside of our own
[1:11:49] thinking now I know we could take this
[1:11:51] in a lot of directions but let's get
[1:11:53] down to the basis of the real faith that
[1:11:56] God put you on this Earth for you got to
[1:11:58] get away from what you think about
[1:12:00] yourself what your family thinks about
[1:12:03] you what individuals think about you and
[1:12:06] you've got to solely base your thinking
[1:12:09] on what the word of God has spoke
[1:12:11] concerning your life brother B said see
[1:12:14] we've got to go beyond the camp now
[1:12:16] we've got to go be on the camp of our
[1:12:19] own thinking woo Glory isn't that
[1:12:21] something that our own thinking becomes
[1:12:23] the denomination and if you don't agree
[1:12:25] with me you're out come on watch this
[1:12:28] amen we can get our own thinking and
[1:12:30] then we won't qualify anybody who don't
[1:12:33] get into that thinking pattern but I say
[1:12:35] every one of our thinking is wrong I say
[1:12:38] every preacher is wrong I say every
[1:12:40] denomination is wrong I say the message
[1:12:43] of the hour is right and the thoughts of
[1:12:45] God are right amen concerning you come
[1:12:48] on Church y'all know I speak the truth
[1:12:50] concerning the church the prophet of God
[1:12:52] said the denomination has crucified this
[1:12:54] word and from this day forward it is the
[1:12:57] word and the word only that I don't have
[1:13:00] to go ask no State presor I don't have
[1:13:02] to go ask no Bishop I don't have to go
[1:13:05] ask no certain church I don't have to go
[1:13:07] ask no certain people we have received
[1:13:10] the thought of God concerning our lives
[1:13:13] and this word we've got to get beyond
[1:13:15] the camp of our own thinking let this
[1:13:17] mind be in you that was in Christ you
[1:13:19] see what he done right there get beyond
[1:13:22] the camp of your thinking let this mind
[1:13:24] be in you so when you hear the scripture
[1:13:26] let this mind be in you it's
[1:13:27] automatically a call out of your own
[1:13:29] life see it's a call out of your own
[1:13:32] thinking let this mind be in you isn't
[1:13:36] it odd that's not that's not a it's not
[1:13:38] a forceful command it's a
[1:13:42] request let the word speaks of letting
[1:13:46] something happen it's letting something
[1:13:48] in the door kind of like behold I stand
[1:13:51] at the door and knock and if any man
[1:13:54] will open up can I say it I'll come in
[1:13:56] and give him my thinking let my thinking
[1:14:00] come into you now watch this because
[1:14:04] brother bam in the message Christ he'll
[1:14:05] say it like this he said you're not
[1:14:07] using your own thoughts you're using his
[1:14:10] thoughts let the mind that was in Christ
[1:14:12] be in you think his way of thinking what
[1:14:15] he says confession means say the same
[1:14:19] thing to confess is to say the same
[1:14:22] thing now carries the mind of Christ to
[1:14:25] your confession in other words when you
[1:14:27] begin to confess something you don't
[1:14:29] confess what you think about that you
[1:14:31] confess what the word of God says about
[1:14:33] that you can feel any way but you've got
[1:14:36] to hold the confession of the word over
[1:14:39] your life he is the high priest of our
[1:14:44] confessions is that right amen now
[1:14:46] here's the thing we cannot alter the
[1:14:48] word of God we have to alter our
[1:14:52] thinking let the mind of Christ come in
[1:14:55] you then you'll think like he thinks and
[1:14:57] begin to think on these things he says I
[1:15:00] can see him become all tore up see you
[1:15:02] got to think on these things now we can
[1:15:05] read it from the scripture Philippians
[1:15:06] chapter 2 let the mind be in you which
[1:15:08] was also in Christ Jesus who being in
[1:15:12] the form of God thought it not robbery
[1:15:15] to be equal with God but made himself of
[1:15:18] no reputation and took upon him the form
[1:15:20] of a servant and made in the likeness of
[1:15:23] men what was it the mind of God come
[1:15:26] into humanity and brought the glory of
[1:15:29] God into a human being amen look at this
[1:15:33] amen we've got it let it be formed into
[1:15:36] us the scripture in 1 Corinthians 2
[1:15:38] watch how Paul say it for who hath known
[1:15:41] the mind of the Lord that's a good
[1:15:44] question for who hath known the mind of
[1:15:48] the Lord he says but we have the mind of
[1:15:52] Christ isn't that something who's got
[1:15:54] the mind of the Lord does the Baptist
[1:15:56] have it does the Lutheran have the mind
[1:15:58] of the Lord come on does the atheist
[1:16:00] have the mind of the Lord does the
[1:16:02] priesthood have the mind of the Lord
[1:16:04] who's got the mind of the Lord Paul said
[1:16:06] I've got the mind of Christ can I say
[1:16:09] this to you tonight we have received the
[1:16:11] mind of Christ when the message of the
[1:16:14] hour came to us it was the mind of
[1:16:17] Christ descending into the age by a
[1:16:20] prophetic word to give us divine rection
[1:16:23] upon mentality and life and the aspects
[1:16:26] of our homes our churches we have the
[1:16:30] mind of Christ can I say this this is
[1:16:32] not the fleshly mind of a
[1:16:35] man this is not the fleshly mind of a
[1:16:38] man we have received the mind of Christ
[1:16:42] and if we receive it as the word do you
[1:16:44] see the effectuality it would have in
[1:16:46] our lives we would receive an efficient
[1:16:49] and beneficient effect of the word of
[1:16:51] God because the message is not the
[1:16:54] thoughts of William
[1:16:56] brandham W Glory that's not the thoughts
[1:17:01] of brother bandam it is the thought of
[1:17:04] God spoken over the
[1:17:06] church it's the
[1:17:08] word it's the word of the
[1:17:12] age see we see this and we realize that
[1:17:17] in the unveiling brother Bram said the
[1:17:18] word manifested or revealed in the
[1:17:20] Revelation he said then what does that
[1:17:23] put me if he is the Shak of Glory I'm
[1:17:26] part of it amen the word itself
[1:17:31] revealed reveals
[1:17:34] itself my goodness Lord you see what
[1:17:37] brother Bram said I'm revealing myself
[1:17:39] by doing this he's saying I'm a part of
[1:17:42] this shakana and by me doing this I'm
[1:17:44] revealing to you I'm a part of
[1:17:47] this see the mystery reveals the son
[1:17:51] right uh Daniel
[1:17:53] uh somebody interpret this dream all
[1:17:56] them people and nobody could do it but
[1:17:58] because there was a mystery when Daniel
[1:18:01] interpreted it set him apart from the
[1:18:04] others and see because there is a
[1:18:07] message it sets you apart when it lives
[1:18:10] in you it divides the church from the
[1:18:15] bride see the mysteries of God made
[1:18:17] known unto us in this day by that same
[1:18:20] Heavenly messenger was made known to
[1:18:23] them in that days the same Pillar of
[1:18:25] Fire that sent Moses the pillar of fire
[1:18:27] that was Moses wrote this Bible the same
[1:18:30] Pillar of Fire met Paul on the road to
[1:18:32] Damascus amen that see that same
[1:18:36] Heavenly messenger is revealing the word
[1:18:40] today now the scriptures tells us in
[1:18:43] Isaiah chapter 55 Amen in the 10th verse
[1:18:47] for as the rain

[1:37:53] Tabernacle up into the city of David to
[1:37:55] be put under a
[1:37:56] tent in the middle of that he did it
[1:37:58] outside the will of God and a man died
[1:38:01] and it had to be put on pause for a
[1:38:02] while but at the end of that pause the
[1:38:05] Holy Spirit spoke to him and said David
[1:38:07] seal up the breaches which you have made
[1:38:09] and take the word down to the tent and
[1:38:12] then they begin the sacrifices and they
[1:38:13] begin to put are y'all with me the
[1:38:16] denominations come to a breach but then
[1:38:19] the prophet took the word on over amen
[1:38:21] and placed it in
[1:38:24] tents he put it in a tent you know what
[1:38:26] happened in that tent there was no more
[1:38:28] law they were outside of Pentecostal
[1:38:30] laws they were outside of Baptist
[1:38:33] Traditions you know what they did at
[1:38:34] that tent of David amen they worshiped
[1:38:37] and praised daily sacrifices were made
[1:38:40] not under Mosaic law but under davic
[1:38:43] worship where they raised their hands
[1:38:45] and shouted and danced and played
[1:38:47] instruments of all kind because the word
[1:38:49] was in the tent listen Len that wasn't
[1:38:52] about that day that was about a day when
[1:38:55] there would be a continual praise a
[1:38:57] sacrifice of praise that would come from
[1:38:59] the Tabernacles of David the tent of the
[1:39:02] Lord come on Church the tent Vision
[1:39:05] which Moses built represented a tent
[1:39:08] vision of the Bride of Jesus Christ and
[1:39:11] the word has been placed in the bride
[1:39:14] and the Shak glory is in there and she's
[1:39:17] shouting and dancing and lifting hands
[1:39:20] and playing instruments and it's not a
[1:39:22] Sunday worship and it's not a Wednesday
[1:39:24] worship amen but it's an everyday
[1:39:27] worship it's a worship of the
[1:39:32] Lamb the day when the breaches have been
[1:39:35] closed up and the word has returned to
[1:39:38] the Tabernacles of
[1:39:41] David the Bible said in that day they
[1:39:44] that possess the remnant of Edom and the
[1:39:47] children of the Heathen them which are
[1:39:48] called by thy name sayith the Lord
[1:39:49] behold the days come sayith the
[1:39:52] Lord I just love this that the plow man
[1:39:56] is going to overtake the
[1:39:59] Reaper and The Treader of grape him that
[1:40:02] Seth seed and the mountain shall drop
[1:40:05] sweet wine and the hills shall me and
[1:40:07] what the world we're talking about a
[1:40:12] season that when the planter and the
[1:40:15] reaper are be in the field at the same
[1:40:18] time I'm talking about a moment that
[1:40:21] when the latter rain and the former rain
[1:40:24] are dropping in the same season I'm
[1:40:26] talking about when the plant rain you
[1:40:28] put a seed in the ground and there's a
[1:40:30] former rain that Waters the planting and
[1:40:33] then there's a lighter rain that brings
[1:40:35] a harvest to the
[1:40:37] planting but there is a season coming
[1:40:40] and may I say is now that the planter
[1:40:43] and the reaper in the the same field at
[1:40:45] the same time amen we have taken the
[1:40:47] seed of this word and we are sewing it
[1:40:50] into heart
[1:40:52] and while the word is being sown there
[1:40:55] is a rain falling upon that seed and at
[1:40:58] the same moment there's a harvest rain
[1:41:01] do you recognize the spoken word in the
[1:41:03] season we're living brother B said it'll
[1:41:05] flash like
[1:41:07] Lightning prise God come on now you
[1:41:10] watch it amen amen back there brother
[1:41:12] Ronnie said something the other day and
[1:41:14] I I I don't remember exactly what he was
[1:41:15] talking about but I want to say this
[1:41:17] it's a little bit about Pentecost but I
[1:41:19] thought it was pretty powerful that the
[1:41:21] first Pentecost was 50
[1:41:23] days from the time of the first fruits
[1:41:25] until Pentecost they moved from Egypt
[1:41:28] and they went to the Mount SII where the
[1:41:30] fire came down and rode on tables of
[1:41:32] stone right amen but then when Jesus
[1:41:35] amen prophesies amen of the outpouring
[1:41:37] to Pentecost they went into the upper
[1:41:39] room they waited 10 days brother B said
[1:41:41] they waited up there 10 days to get all
[1:41:43] the fussing and stewing and all the
[1:41:45] indifferences and get it all out amen it
[1:41:47] took them two days look how the timing
[1:41:49] increased yeah
[1:41:51] went from 40 days to 10 days but isn't
[1:41:54] it amazing that brother man said in this
[1:41:55] hour he said a man could receive the
[1:41:58] Holy Ghost while he's sitting in his Pew
[1:42:00] that you wouldn't even have to come to
[1:42:02] an altar but while the word of God is
[1:42:04] being preached it is a moment of an
[1:42:07] instant work of almighty God people can
[1:42:10] be healed in the preaching of the word
[1:42:12] under the third pool there could be
[1:42:15] total healing a praying and a watering
[1:42:18] and a reaping in the saint Serv in the
[1:42:21] same moment people can receive the Holy
[1:42:24] Ghost lives could be changed the power
[1:42:26] of God could be real I'm talking about
[1:42:29] God coming as the rain in this
[1:42:31] generation
[1:42:33] Hallelujah both farmer and latter praise
[1:42:37] the
[1:42:38] Lord if you look at it as a rain I know
[1:42:41] I'm I'm running out of time so I got to
[1:42:43] preach it but if you look at it as a
[1:42:46] rain let's take Elijah and remember when
[1:42:50] he prophesied on on Mount Carmel that
[1:42:52] there was going to come rain remember
[1:42:54] after he destroyed the prophets of baale
[1:42:56] he said I hear the sound of the
[1:42:57] abundance of rain and he went up on the
[1:42:59] mountain after prophesying after three
[1:43:00] and a half years rain's coming and he
[1:43:03] went up and sat on the mountain but he
[1:43:04] was wore out and tired right but he was
[1:43:10] expecting and you know what he did he
[1:43:13] said to his servant G he was tired he
[1:43:15] couldn't even get up and go look he said
[1:43:17] Gaza go over there and look toward the
[1:43:20] sea
[1:43:21] and tell me what you
[1:43:23] see and guy got up went over there and
[1:43:25] he said oh Lord Elijah I know you
[1:43:28] prophesied rain but they ain't a cloud
[1:43:30] in the
[1:43:31] sky I don't see
[1:43:34] nothing so he went back and told the
[1:43:36] story and I love I love Elijah's
[1:43:39] perseverance he knew it was the word of
[1:43:41] the Lord amen go look
[1:43:44] again and he sent that man back Seven
[1:43:47] Ages looking for that Revival That was
[1:43:49] supposed to be coming the Lord amen and
[1:43:51] when he got back there you know what he
[1:43:52] done that last time he circles back and
[1:43:55] he looks at Elijah and he said I see I
[1:43:57] seen something finally he said what was
[1:44:00] it that you saw he said I seen the cloud
[1:44:03] but it was just about the size of a
[1:44:05] man's hand can you imagine that's all he
[1:44:10] saw one little cloud in the sky the size
[1:44:14] of a man's hand and Elijah got into
[1:44:17] Revival Elijah saw he was coming as the
[1:44:21] rain he saw the first moving of rain was
[1:44:25] not just the prophecy of the word but
[1:44:27] now there was a cloud he had a physical
[1:44:30] sign in the sky what has happened up
[1:44:33] there is about to happen down here and
[1:44:36] he begin to cry out and he began to
