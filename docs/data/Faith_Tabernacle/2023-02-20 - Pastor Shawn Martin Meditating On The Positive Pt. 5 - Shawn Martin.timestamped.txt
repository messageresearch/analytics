[35:02] the book he saw the lamb take the book
[35:05] and he knew you know and I think we know
[35:08] that he took the book because we see our
[35:11] name
[35:12] written in the Lamb's Book of Life it's
[35:15] it's something that's becoming a part of

[35:58] um
[35:58] the book of the Philippians the fourth
[36:01] chapter

[36:11] we just appreciate the Lord and all that
[36:14] he's done
[36:15] for us and um

[36:31] looking forward to his coming

[36:43] Lord
[36:44] precious father
[36:47] it is so good to be with your people
[36:50] father
[36:52] here tonight and
[36:55] just to know that you're among us
[36:58] father we we brought you with us Lord
[37:01] and
[37:02] it's just a thrill not only to us to
[37:08] meet with you but you to meet with us
[37:10] you're redeemed
[37:12] and father we just humbly ask that you
[37:15] would just have your way
[37:17] God we need you more today than we ever
[37:21] have
[37:22] and our hearts are yearning for more of
[37:25] you father
[37:27] and Lord may we not get slacked may we
[37:30] not take our salvation for granted and
[37:34] what you've done for us Lord but
[37:36] may it so forever burn within us Lord
[37:41] May the convictions May
[37:46] Lord your your spirit just just be
[37:51] overwhelming Lord and be more
[37:54] burning within us than it ever has for
[37:58] we see people getting slack we see the
[38:01] layout of sin age the spirit taking over
[38:06] that God may we are may we have the all
[38:10] in our lamps and our Lambs trimmed and
[38:13] burning bright Lord
[38:15] and father I pray that you would just
[38:18] take over the service now
[38:20] we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen
[38:25] we want to look at Philippians the
[38:28] fourth chapter
[38:30] and the eighth verse
[38:33] it says finally Brethren whatsoever
[38:36] things are true
[38:38] whatsoever things are on us whatsoever
[38:41] things are of good rep or adjust
[38:44] whatsoever things are pure whatsoever
[38:47] things are lovely whatsoever things are
[38:49] of good report
[38:51] if there be any virtue and if there be
[38:54] any praise think on these things
[38:57] and those things which you have both
[38:59] learned and received and heard
[39:02] and seen in me do
[39:05] and the God of Peace
[39:08] shall be with you
[39:10] amen you can have your seats this
[39:12] evening
[39:13] and
[39:15] not to to keep you long but I do want to
[39:20] continue with the the thought meditating
[39:23] on the positive
[39:26] and
[39:27] um
[39:28] is there such a thing where a person can
[39:33] control what they meditate on
[39:36] I I personally believe you can and
[39:40] because I think just just by that
[39:42] scripture alone it tells us that you can
[39:47] uh you you can control and
[39:52] um for the scripture here tells us what
[39:55] to meditate on
[39:57] and so if it tells us what to meditate
[40:01] on then it it it it then it shows that
[40:05] we have control we can choose as to what
[40:10] we
[40:12] um meditate and so now as we know the
[40:16] prophet said you cannot you cannot
[40:18] control the thoughts that come into your
[40:22] mind
[40:23] um and but you can control
[40:27] um well as as the example we use is that
[40:31] that you can't keep a bird from flying
[40:33] over your head but you can keep him from
[40:36] building a nest in your hair and so
[40:41] um then this word meditate according to
[40:44] Webster is to focus
[40:47] to focus one's thoughts on
[40:51] to reflect on or ponder over to plan or
[40:56] project in the mind intend purpose
[41:01] so with that in mind
[41:04] Paul tells us to think think on things
[41:07] and so not everything is of a good
[41:10] report not everything is honest not
[41:13] everything is just or pure not
[41:16] everything is lovely
[41:18] and and we find that there's more of
[41:22] that than there is the other
[41:24] uh just but yet God tells us to think
[41:29] on things that are just pure lovely
[41:33] honest of good report if there's any
[41:36] virtue if there's any praise uh think on
[41:40] these things
[41:41] we are living in an age where it seems
[41:45] as though people of the world have no
[41:49] control to stop anything they have no
[41:52] power to control or to stop and and you
[41:57] know we're not we're not out to try to
[42:01] control government that's that's fact
[42:03] it's it's going to be we're not out to
[42:07] control things that we are it's
[42:09] impossible for us to control but I think
[42:13] a lot of times we're so busy or and I
[42:15] say we the world people in general are
[42:18] so busy trying to control things that
[42:20] they cannot stop
[42:22] and yet failed to to look at the things
[42:25] that they can control
[42:28] and so uh but we find that people have
[42:31] no control uh over their minds uh they
[42:35] have no control over their passions and
[42:37] lusts they have no control or really
[42:40] over anything
[42:42] uh just to be honest and and I I think
[42:45] the Bible actually says that people
[42:48] would be incontinent and I've looked up
[42:50] that word incontinent and that is the
[42:53] lack of self-control they they have no
[42:55] control so they'll be incontinent
[42:57] and and with this thought
[43:00] people which the prophet Lord predicted
[43:03] it that people are going insane
[43:06] and and now you know I I want to say
[43:09] this for a moment that
[43:12] um
[43:13] just because that you know someone had
[43:17] had put out publicly that people in the
[43:21] message when it comes to mental issues
[43:23] that people don't in the message refuses
[43:26] or they don't understand or they cut you
[43:29] off and that's wrong
[43:31] because we we're finding that the battle
[43:34] is in the mind
[43:35] and there is a lot of mental pressure
[43:38] there's a lot of things that uh if if if
[43:41] we sing anything especially among our
[43:45] young people uh but I think with any uh
[43:47] with with uh any age is that is mental
[43:53] battles mental things that are are going
[43:56] on and and I think we could all raise
[43:59] our hand I guess unless you're you're
[44:01] different but uh that that there is a
[44:05] real mental fight
[44:08] that is going on today more than it ever
[44:11] has and it's and it's it's really is
[44:14] something that is trying to affect the
[44:16] mind and yeah I think and I believe it's
[44:20] because that the the world is going that
[44:23] direction they are going insane and uh
[44:27] and and so it's trying to affect uh the
[44:31] bride more people are just you know uh
[44:35] ending their lives ending their own
[44:37] family's lives ending we're finding more
[44:40] murders rapes and uh incest uh it's it's
[44:45] just oh on and on and on and and the
[44:47] prophet said no one in their right mind
[44:49] would ever do such a thing but it's
[44:52] mental people are literally loosened
[44:54] their their capability of thinking right
[44:59] and so uh and and because of this Satan
[45:04] is able to use uh uh people in whatever
[45:08] degree he wants and we're finding out it
[45:12] isn't it is it's it's it's whether
[45:15] you're rich it's whether you're POI it
[45:18] has no bearing whether you're rich or
[45:20] poor uh uh uh whatever is is the
[45:24] people's minds in whatever level you're
[45:28] you're in or raised in Blue Collar White
[45:30] Collar gold collar you know whatever but
[45:35] Satan is able to use people in whatever
[45:38] degree uh that that he wants to and this
[45:43] is because that people have given their
[45:46] mind over to things that are inspired of
[45:52] the devil
[45:53] and and whether they want to agree with
[45:56] that or not it's just the truth this is
[46:00] Satan's Eden it's his inventions it's
[46:04] and he's doing it for a purpose he all
[46:07] these inventions are for a purpose
[46:09] whether right it's it's just that way
[46:12] and and and so years ago people didn't
[46:16] think on things that people in this age
[46:19] think one
[46:20] but it's it's just it's out of control
[46:24] and and we know it's an anointing uh uh
[46:29] that that has come upon the people and
[46:33] so uh that the Bible even prophesied
[46:36] that it would be in this age that evil
[46:39] things uh would be invented uh Paul
[46:42] would say they would be inventors of
[46:44] evil things and and so uh uh but but I
[46:49] looked it up uh you know inventions it's
[46:52] something that starts in the mind it's
[46:54] something that is drawed up in the mind
[46:57] and and now now I I will say do people
[47:00] just intend to invent evil things I I'm
[47:04] not going to go there even though they
[47:06] are inventing horrible things but but
[47:10] it's it's it's an inspiration that
[47:13] they're under that that they're they're
[47:16] inventing things but Satan is taking
[47:19] them and using it to destroy us
[47:22] it to destroy homes to destroy family to
[47:26] destroy churches to destroy whatever
[47:29] he's just out to do that and I think I
[47:32] think we could all agree to that that
[47:35] the more inventions
[47:37] they come up with the more troubled our
[47:40] young people become the the more
[47:43] troubled that people are becoming and
[47:46] and and it's just it's uh brother
[47:49] Brandon and brother Branham calls it
[47:51] because we don't see them maybe as evil
[47:53] but brother Branham calls it enticing
[47:55] Spirits it's it's an invasion of the
[47:58] United States and so uh we look at it
[48:02] through television uh internet and
[48:05] things as such people have opened their
[48:10] mind up to where Satan has full access
[48:14] to them
[48:16] simply because of inventions
[48:21] I honestly don't think that a man had
[48:25] issues with with with the lusts the
[48:29] passions that men have today uh I don't
[48:33] think 200 300 years ago that men had
[48:37] that problem as they do today
[48:41] because it wasn't opened up to them
[48:44] I'm not saying that it didn't lay there
[48:46] because they're common-born men
[48:48] but it wasn't opened up to them as it is
[48:51] today
[48:52] I don't care what program you get on
[48:55] whether it's Instagram whether it's it's
[48:58] just YouTube or whether it's uh just
[49:01] plain old television or whatever
[49:03] Billboards uh or just go to call around
[49:06] the college or whatever things are
[49:08] becoming more open and more and and to
[49:11] where these boys are be introduced to
[49:14] things that it never was in it to begin
[49:18] you know years ago and and so uh uh and
[49:24] and so but now we we look at what
[49:26] brother Brown would say in his age that
[49:29] the comic books comic books uh that the
[49:34] children were reading were preparing
[49:37] their little Minds The Children's Minds
[49:41] for a blast that the devil was going to
[49:43] give them y'all remember the quote that
[49:46] brother Miranda talked about now look
[49:48] where we are today compared to what that
[49:52] was but it was seed sowing back then and
[49:56] and now and it was preparing the
[49:59] children's Minds and I I I have to say
[50:03] that I think our schools are preparing
[50:06] the children's Minds
[50:09] don't think that Hall I don't think
[50:11] homeless homosexuality just
[50:13] were not it started as seeds preparation
[50:16] that's why brother Brown screamed out
[50:19] against education and and and and
[50:21] Science and all that they have an agenda
[50:24] whether you believe it or not they just
[50:27] have agendas and and and and and they
[50:30] took away prayer out of the school they
[50:32] took away our Bible out of the school
[50:33] and whether the teachers realized it or
[50:36] not the devil knew it because that's ex
[50:38] it's his kingdom it's his world it's his
[50:42] his things and and and so now how does
[50:46] presidents get in the way they are today
[50:48] they wouldn't have got in back then but
[50:51] they're in today uh uh uh they get in so
[50:55] easily and and these things and they're
[50:58] just heathens
[50:59] he just won't say it that way but what
[51:02] is it it's just because we've got a
[51:04] generation that don't care about it
[51:06] anymore
[51:07] I don't care about values they don't
[51:09] care about principles they don't they
[51:11] don't care about it but what was it it
[51:14] was something that was preparing them
[51:18] now
[51:20] you know I I honestly believe then not
[51:25] only the people have given themselves
[51:26] over to these things but I believe we're
[51:30] living in a time where God has given the
[51:33] people over
[51:35] God has given it over it's one thing for
[51:38] a person to open up their mind to
[51:40] something
[51:42] but then it's another thing for God to
[51:45] give that person over
[51:47] and and so I I believe that a person can
[51:51] open their mind to something that's not
[51:53] right
[51:54] and but yeah
[51:58] I believe they can still be convicted
[52:01] uh of it
[52:03] and and something will tell them that
[52:05] they're doing wrong
[52:06] because I think maybe we're all guilty
[52:08] of opening up to something that we
[52:11] shouldn't have and the Lord convicts us
[52:14] and says you shouldn't do that
[52:19] but then it's another thing that God
[52:21] gives that person over now when God
[52:23] gives the person over then I wonder
[52:27] if if there's any more convictions about
[52:30] it
[52:31] honestly don't think there is
[52:34] about things and this is where we're at
[52:36] that people just don't have convictions
[52:38] anymore
[52:39] people don't think twice about doing it
[52:41] anymore people they just ain't got
[52:43] morals hang up principles they ain't got
[52:47] nothing anymore
[52:48] and and you wonder why is that but I
[52:52] believe before God would give a person
[52:55] over that they would have to actually
[52:58] reject the truth
[53:00] before God turns them over right and I'm
[53:04] going to read some scriptures concerning
[53:06] this like Psalms 81 and 10 through 12 I
[53:10] am the Lord thy God which brought thee
[53:13] out of the land of Egypt open thy mouth
[53:15] wide and I will fill it but my people
[53:19] would not hearken to my voice and Israel
[53:21] would none of me so I gave them up under
[53:25] their own Hearts lust and they walked in
[53:29] their own councils
[53:31] they had a prophet right there with the
[53:34] word of God that they walked in their
[53:37] own councils ain't that right acts 7 and
[53:40] 38 this is he that was in the church in
[53:44] the wilderness with the angel which
[53:45] spake unto him which spake to him in the
[53:48] Mount Sinai and with our fathers who
[53:51] received the Lively oracles to give unto
[53:54] us to whom our fathers would not obey
[53:57] but thrust him from them think of that
[54:01] and in their hearts turned back again
[54:04] into Egypt saying unto Aaron make us
[54:07] Gods to go before us as for this uh
[54:10] Moses see which brought us out of the
[54:13] land of Egypt we want not what has
[54:15] become of him see and and they made a
[54:19] calf in those days and offered sacrifice
[54:21] unto the idol and rejoiced in the works
[54:24] of their own hands then God turned and
[54:28] gave them up to worship the host of
[54:30] Heaven as it is written in the book of
[54:33] the prophets oh ye House of Israel have
[54:35] you offered to me slang beasts and
[54:38] sacrifices by the space of 40 years in
[54:41] the wilderness yay you took up the
[54:44] Tabernacle of moloch and and the star of
[54:47] your God rimfum rimfum uh figures which
[54:52] you made to worship them and I'll carry
[54:55] you away Beyond Babylon see so before
[54:58] God will act in the wrong way or what we
[55:02] would you understand what I'm saying he
[55:03] don't act wrong but he something that
[55:06] would be detrimental uh there let's say
[55:10] it this way before the wrath of God can
[55:12] be poured out upon the people in this
[55:14] age they first had to turn the word down
[55:17] ain't that right and and so uh uh uh
[55:21] Romans 1 21 because when they knew God
[55:25] they glorified him not as God neither
[55:29] were thankful but became vain in their
[55:31] imaginations and their foolish heart was
[55:34] dark and professing themselves to be
[55:36] wise they became fools and changed the
[55:39] people did they changed the glory of The
[55:41] Incorruptible God into an image made
[55:44] like the corruptable man and to birds
[55:47] and four faded-footed beasts and
[55:49] creeping things wherefore God also gave
[55:53] them up this was the reaction of God to
[55:56] what they're doing God would give them
[55:58] up to uncleanness through the lust of
[56:01] their own Hearts to dishonor their own
[56:04] bodies between themselves ain't that
[56:07] right
[56:08] homosexuality transgenders and all of
[56:11] that this is the result of people
[56:13] forsaken the word
[56:16] right so they changed see who changed
[56:20] the truth of God into a lie see then
[56:23] worshiped and served the creature more
[56:25] than the Creator who is blessed forever
[56:28] amen for this cause God gave them up to
[56:31] vile of undivile affections for even
[56:34] their women did change the natural use
[56:37] into that which is against nature right
[56:40] see and and likewise also the men uh uh
[56:45] leaving the natural use of the woman
[56:47] burned in their lust uh one toward
[56:50] another men with men working that which
[56:53] is unseemly and receiving in themselves
[56:55] that recompense of their error which was
[56:58] me and even as they did not like to
[57:02] retain God in their knowledge God gave
[57:05] them over to a reprobate mind to do
[57:08] those things which are not convenient
[57:10] see being filled with all
[57:12] unrighteousness fornication wickedness
[57:14] covetness maliciousness is full of Envy
[57:17] murder debate deceit malignity Whispers
[57:20] backbiters haters of God despiteful
[57:23] proud boasters inventor of evil sayings
[57:26] disobedient to Parents Without
[57:28] understanding Covenant Covenant Breakers
[57:31] that uh without natural affection
[57:33] implacable unmerciful ain't that right
[57:36] so this is what the people became so
[57:39] second Thessalonians 2 and 10 because
[57:42] they receive not the love of the truth
[57:45] that they might be saved see for this
[57:49] cause God shall send them strong
[57:51] delusions that they will believe a lie
[57:53] and that they all might be damned who
[57:56] believe not the truth but had pleasure
[57:58] in unrighteousness so so we see that
[58:02] that God gives the people over too they
[58:05] give themselves over to evil things they
[58:09] give themselves over and and because
[58:11] they give themselves over God gives them
[58:15] over
[58:16] to to fulfill what they've wanted what
[58:19] they've desired can you say man see this
[58:23] is not a cowboy rodeo brother shalom
[58:25] it's not have you ever been to a rodeo
[58:27] yeah well back in Oklahoma they have
[58:30] them rodeos you know and and I've been
[58:33] to a couple and but uh it and it's just
[58:36] gotten so nasty uh they're dirty jokes
[58:39] and stuff that they use I just decide
[58:41] not to go but but they get on them
[58:43] things you know and they get on that
[58:45] wild that wild Bronco or that Wild Bull
[58:48] you know and the bull the way they go
[58:50] they got eight sections to stay on right
[58:52] and uh my nephew before he gave his
[58:55] heart to the Lord he uh he joined one of
[58:58] these uh rodeos of uh uh you know when
[59:02] it come into town and and you you had to
[59:06] um you had to outlast that bull they put
[59:08] you in a ring and you had the last one
[59:11] standing got got so much money you know
[59:14] and uh so you know well he got you know
[59:17] he's a big old buff dude and but the
[59:20] bull won you know that bull took him out
[59:23] and but but sometimes we think that's
[59:27] the way church is and serving God is
[59:29] that way but that's not see we we don't
[59:32] argue with God we we we've got to come
[59:35] to God's way of doing things and and so
[59:39] when people doesn't want to give their
[59:42] life to God and when they just buck in
[59:44] the system then God eventually gives
[59:48] them over now so so with this thought in
[59:52] mind God always gives his word first
[59:56] first of all ain't that right what we do
[1:00:00] with his word determines our outcome
[1:00:04] ain't that right if we keep pushing it
[1:00:07] aside as though it is nothing to us then
[1:00:10] there's a certain outcome to that but
[1:00:13] then we find that David would say Thy
[1:00:16] word have I hid in my heart that I sin
[1:00:20] not against thee now so David made the
[1:00:23] choice to hide the word instead of
[1:00:26] pushing the word he took that word and
[1:00:30] hid it in his heart ain't that right so
[1:00:33] we've got um God tells his people think
[1:00:37] on the right things think on the right
[1:00:40] things ain't that right see now brother
[1:00:42] Bradham says you and I think I've read
[1:00:45] this last uh Sunday but he says you hear
[1:00:48] so much today about positive thinking
[1:00:50] you just put your mind on anything and
[1:00:53] think positive on it yeah it don't work
[1:00:56] see the devil can do that see there's
[1:01:00] only one thing that rules overall see
[1:01:04] and that's God's word ain't that right
[1:01:06] so there is a a a an authority when it
[1:01:12] comes to the word of God see and that's
[1:01:15] God's word if you're thinking contrary
[1:01:17] to the word he says then forget your
[1:01:20] thinking
[1:01:21] sank on the word ain't that right so
[1:01:25] there's going to be all kinds of
[1:01:27] thoughts that run through your mind but
[1:01:30] then we find out that there's only one
[1:01:32] thing positive there's only one thing
[1:01:35] that actually has the that control and
[1:01:39] that is the word of God Satan's coming
[1:01:41] in like a roaring lion Satan's coming in
[1:01:44] like a flood he's he's coming in as the
[1:01:47] prophet priest invasion of the United
[1:01:49] States and he's finding every Avenue
[1:01:51] through every invention a man that he
[1:01:54] can come through Amen to affect you he
[1:01:57] again he wants to destroy destroy your
[1:02:00] life he wants to take the spirituality
[1:02:02] away from you he wants to get you to
[1:02:04] where he don't mind you coming to church
[1:02:06] as long as you don't experience the the
[1:02:08] realities of God
[1:02:10] ain't that right amen as long as your
[1:02:13] mind is thinking on everything else
[1:02:15] while you're sitting in church and and
[1:02:17] and and remember when your mind is
[1:02:19] bogged down a man he he can he can
[1:02:22] nearly run you over
[1:02:26] just can I mean just any little old
[1:02:29] thing anymore that comes it nearly
[1:02:32] knocks people flat amen see it's just
[1:02:35] because we we've we've come to his way
[1:02:38] of thinking
[1:02:41] no wonder fear is gripping the land
[1:02:44] today
[1:02:49] old is all right but
[1:02:52] there are many many things in the world
[1:02:55] that tried to direct our mind and again
[1:02:59] it's it's just it's Satan's Eden it's
[1:03:02] Satan's kingdom
[1:03:03] so so what he's doing he's smarter than
[1:03:07] you
[1:03:08] and he studies you he's an opponent just
[1:03:12] as much as the boxer studies his
[1:03:14] opponent and you should
[1:03:16] you know he wants to know his weaknesses
[1:03:18] he wants to know all about him he wants
[1:03:21] to know if he fights more with the right
[1:03:22] hand or the left hand he wants to know
[1:03:24] if he's Southpaw he wants to know
[1:03:25] everything if he's going to win he's got
[1:03:28] to know his enemy well Satan gonna study
[1:03:29] you and he studies you individually
[1:03:33] ain't that right and we find out that
[1:03:36] he's he's perfecting his his inventions
[1:03:40] he's perfecting it to where it's not
[1:03:42] just Elders amen the elderly it's it's
[1:03:46] now he's dropped down into teams and now
[1:03:49] he's even affecting little ones he he
[1:03:51] knows how to captivate
[1:03:54] ain't that right but the point is is he
[1:03:58] wants to direct our minds there's so
[1:04:00] many things in the world today to direct
[1:04:03] our minds and the point is is to get us
[1:04:06] off the word to get us trained to
[1:04:08] something else get our minds and see and
[1:04:11] and so and and and the world wants our
[1:04:14] thoughts to come under their influence
[1:04:16] Hollywood has influenced Millions
[1:04:23] Hollywood has influenced the way
[1:04:26] millions of people think
[1:04:31] is that right the media controls
[1:04:35] the way millions of people think about
[1:04:39] things
[1:04:40] true
[1:04:42] the church
[1:04:45] controls the way millions of people
[1:04:50] perceive God
[1:04:53] they they control the thought process
[1:04:57] it's true when Jesus came to the Earth
[1:05:01] uh walking the Earth uh there were
[1:05:05] people that literally thought that the
[1:05:08] Messiah would be different than what the
[1:05:09] word said he would be
[1:05:11] and the prophet says they missed him
[1:05:14] because they thought different their
[1:05:16] thoughts their thoughts see the church
[1:05:19] had trained them
[1:05:22] through Creeds and teachings of darkness
[1:05:25] and all that had actually directed their
[1:05:27] thought process
[1:05:29] to seeking
[1:05:31] that the Messiah would be coming
[1:05:32] differently than what the word said
[1:05:35] so when the Messiah came according to
[1:05:37] the word they didn't believe it because
[1:05:38] their thinking process
[1:05:40] had been changed
[1:05:45] but if they would have come under the
[1:05:46] influence of the word and let their
[1:05:48] thoughts be directed by the word
[1:05:50] they would have saw him
[1:05:53] can you say man
[1:05:55] and and no matter what the Samaritan
[1:05:58] lady went through and all that she had
[1:06:00] been taught right by her mother
[1:06:02] first he said we know when the Messiah
[1:06:05] comes he'll do these things and all he
[1:06:08] had to say is I am he
[1:06:10] and it caught
[1:06:14] but somehow she knew the Messiah was
[1:06:16] going to do that
[1:06:17] first she said we know right
[1:06:20] now now I am of the beliefs that our
[1:06:22] children need to be started off in the
[1:06:24] right path
[1:06:25] by being careful as to what they read as
[1:06:28] to what they listen to as to what they
[1:06:30] take in
[1:06:31] can you say man that's why television
[1:06:34] should not be the babysitter
[1:06:36] phones should not be the babysitter
[1:06:40] now I'm telling you it'd be the easiest
[1:06:42] thing to do is to let your children have
[1:06:44] phones to where they can just sit there
[1:06:47] and listen to anything and and all that
[1:06:49] and they're just as quiet as they can be
[1:06:52] why we go do our own thing
[1:06:55] as long as they ain't getting in the in
[1:06:57] the pantry and as long as they ain't
[1:06:59] touching the fire and as long as they
[1:07:01] ain't getting in the medicine cabinet
[1:07:03] we're fine just give them something to
[1:07:06] where that satisfies but what we don't
[1:07:08] realize is they're imputing things
[1:07:11] that they shouldn't be imputing
[1:07:17] brother random talking about Abraham
[1:07:20] Lincoln said the only two things he had
[1:07:23] was the Bible and Fox's book of Martyrs
[1:07:27] and he said they were the things that
[1:07:30] molded the kind of character Abraham
[1:07:33] Lincoln was
[1:07:34] now if a comic book can prepare a little
[1:07:38] child's mind for a blast that the
[1:07:40] devil's going to give them then then
[1:07:43] that automatically we can reverse that
[1:07:45] and say that the right kind of material
[1:07:48] will prepare their minds
[1:07:51] to receive what God has for them
[1:07:54] ain't that right I believe God wants to
[1:07:57] give them the Holy Ghost you believe
[1:07:59] that and so if we prepare them for that
[1:08:04] um
[1:08:05] yeah well if if if they can receive
[1:08:07] things that the devil has then they can
[1:08:09] receive things God has surely right now
[1:08:12] brother Branham says this way you you
[1:08:14] keep your Bible laying close to your
[1:08:16] children
[1:08:18] he said that's right he said you keep
[1:08:20] your Bible in close for your children
[1:08:22] and then read it yourself so to be the
[1:08:25] example
[1:08:27] ain't that right so you teenagers and
[1:08:31] couples alike make sure
[1:08:34] you feed off the word of God
[1:08:36] make sure
[1:08:39] make sure you play them tapes
[1:08:41] to feed off that word of God
[1:08:43] play them tapes and don't just listen to
[1:08:46] video clips that someone's put up a
[1:08:48] brother Branham
[1:08:49] play the tape
[1:08:52] play the tape
[1:08:53] when you come to church listen to what
[1:08:55] what is being said ain't that right why
[1:08:59] because you've got to feed off the word
[1:09:01] of God
[1:09:03] come under the influence of the word of
[1:09:05] God
[1:09:07] there's nothing wrong with that
[1:09:09] coming off the influence of the word
[1:09:13] why because trouble is going to come to
[1:09:15] you
[1:09:18] um you're going to face challenges you
[1:09:20] will meet the enemy
[1:09:23] already taught us that and when you do
[1:09:26] make sure you remember the enemy will
[1:09:28] come you will meet him and when you do
[1:09:30] meet him you got to know
[1:09:33] you you can't be in a position
[1:09:36] to where the Satan Satan can have Heyday
[1:09:38] brochure on with your mind
[1:09:40] you can't be in the position
[1:09:43] that when you're out at work
[1:09:46] and and you're at the store and you're
[1:09:49] at at places and then Satan meets you in
[1:09:53] whatever form
[1:09:56] then he can have Heyday with your mind
[1:09:59] because you ain't been grounded
[1:10:04] ain't that right
[1:10:06] I mean people can get upset about the
[1:10:09] most ridiculous things and before you
[1:10:11] know it they got the gun pulled out
[1:10:13] why
[1:10:15] because there's no control
[1:10:18] they've watched so many murders they've
[1:10:21] watched so many filth
[1:10:23] it's just embedded in them
[1:10:27] so when it comes time that they meet
[1:10:29] Satan they ain't got none they ain't got
[1:10:32] no defense
[1:10:37] and you know the the prophet said the
[1:10:39] Holy Ghost always feeds off the word
[1:10:42] amen and so if if you've got the holy
[1:10:45] ghost that Holy Ghost feeds off the word
[1:10:46] more than anything else
[1:10:49] ain't that right so make sure you feed
[1:10:51] off the word see because you're gonna
[1:10:54] have to have roots
[1:10:55] you're going to have root you have to
[1:10:57] have roots to to keep you to hold you
[1:11:01] it's like the tree you know when the
[1:11:02] wind comes He's Got Roots if he's got
[1:11:04] roots then the wind ain't gonna be able
[1:11:07] to take him out
[1:11:08] it's those that ain't got real roots
[1:11:12] yeah
[1:11:13] now Satan wants to destroy you
[1:11:16] he wants to ruin you he wants to make
[1:11:19] you another statistic he wants to make
[1:11:21] you believe his lies
[1:11:23] ain't that right
[1:11:25] and and you're going to have to be
[1:11:27] rooted in the word of God
[1:11:30] you're going to have to have strength to
[1:11:31] fend off the enemy
[1:11:33] and I won't say this fun and games
[1:11:39] ain't going to help you in these times
[1:11:43] comedy ain't gonna help you in these
[1:11:46] times
[1:11:48] now now you know me
[1:11:50] I I want you young people to have a ball
[1:11:54] and and and and and you know I I think
[1:11:58] you should be able to have good times
[1:11:59] together
[1:12:01] and and that's that's you know so I'm
[1:12:05] I'm I'm a promoter of them things
[1:12:08] but at the same time
[1:12:10] you know and and your brother and
[1:12:13] forgive me because uh
[1:12:16] you know I wanted I want to join you in
[1:12:18] having a good time
[1:12:20] but at the same time these little toy
[1:12:22] guns ain't gonna help you in the back
[1:12:29] I'm just ain't gonna help you in the
[1:12:32] battles
[1:12:33] you know it's it's it's good to have
[1:12:36] laughter it's good but volleyball ain't
[1:12:38] gonna help you in the battles
[1:12:41] uh you know and and and again I I'm not
[1:12:45] against these things and I I hope you
[1:12:47] understand but now I you know as much as
[1:12:51] I promote that and I want my boys to
[1:12:53] have fun because I'd rather my boys
[1:12:55] doing that than out there uh partying uh
[1:12:58] you know with the rock and rollers and
[1:13:00] and all of these things so so it you
[1:13:04] know we can't take all the fun away you
[1:13:06] understand what I'm saying you know uh
[1:13:08] sure it's easy when I'm I'm an older man
[1:13:11] and and and I now I'm worrying about
[1:13:14] breaking my bones right brush my and and
[1:13:17] I'm worried about getting out there you
[1:13:19] know I used to skate too but you know
[1:13:21] what I get out there and skate and I'm
[1:13:23] thinking oh my Lord if I break a bone
[1:13:25] you know that's going to be rough but
[1:13:27] but so I'm in my age now but I can't
[1:13:30] look at my children being young so y'all
[1:13:32] can't do that you know uh uh now sure we
[1:13:36] want to apply wisdom right but and say
[1:13:38] think before you do them things but
[1:13:40] still you gotta enjoy life uh uh because
[1:13:43] so I was a teenager once and we had a
[1:13:46] good time right but so I'd rather you
[1:13:48] have a good time than again out there
[1:13:50] partying and running the streets and all
[1:13:53] that and I'm for the hunting and the
[1:13:55] fishing and the and and whatever so
[1:13:58] there is that balance but now we're
[1:14:00] talking about some real things there is
[1:14:01] a real enemy
[1:14:03] and and so you cannot be shallow when it
[1:14:08] comes to knowing the word of God
[1:14:12] you you cannot be shallow when when you
[1:14:16] when the enemy faces you you gotta know
[1:14:19] that it's your enemy and how to defeat
[1:14:21] that enemy
[1:14:24] is that all right
[1:14:25] you want to know where you stand in the
[1:14:28] word
[1:14:30] and so you want to have your mind and
[1:14:33] your thoughts in the word of God
[1:14:36] and and you want the word of God to be
[1:14:39] deposited in you
[1:14:43] ain't that right
[1:14:45] and and many of you have already been
[1:14:48] fighting
[1:14:49] the enemy and I I I want to say that
[1:14:54] you've done a great job at defeating him
[1:14:57] standing true
[1:14:59] uh uh but I also say don't you let up
[1:15:04] the battle gets hot the battle gets
[1:15:07] weary it it just you know and sometimes
[1:15:10] you don't see the light at the end of
[1:15:11] the tunnel and and you're there and
[1:15:14] Satan is just vehemently uh uh there but
[1:15:18] and it may seem that he's getting the
[1:15:20] upper hand but I want to tell you that's
[1:15:22] not true
[1:15:24] can you say man you're just in a Warfare
[1:15:27] but you you keep that word deposited in
[1:15:30] you yeah the times that you get under
[1:15:32] the pressure and the times that you
[1:15:34] don't feel the Lord sometime you know
[1:15:36] sometimes you just may not know what's
[1:15:38] up and down and and and and these things
[1:15:41] but but but but but but stand there upon
[1:15:44] that word don't give up
[1:15:51] now we you you Elders you know good and
[1:15:54] well how the word devil works
[1:15:57] he'll battle you and fight you and fight
[1:16:00] you maybe with temptation
[1:16:03] and maybe there's just a certain way
[1:16:05] that he he keeps hitting you out keeps
[1:16:07] hitting you and you you stand and you
[1:16:10] stand and maybe you fall then you get
[1:16:12] back up and you're standing and you're
[1:16:14] standing and it just keeps sitting there
[1:16:16] and he wants to make you think
[1:16:19] young people he wants to make you think
[1:16:21] that that's just the way you are
[1:16:26] because it comes at you so many times in
[1:16:28] them areas
[1:16:31] and I think the elders could actually
[1:16:33] testify to that that if you just keep
[1:16:36] standing
[1:16:37] you'll find your victory
[1:16:40] you'll find that you'll overcome but
[1:16:42] it's in that battles
[1:16:45] that Satan just keeps wearing you down
[1:16:47] and trying to wear you down and wear you
[1:16:50] down can you say man
[1:16:52] and before you know it if you're not
[1:16:54] careful you start thinking on other
[1:16:56] things you start thinking of other ways
[1:16:58] and and you think well maybe it's not
[1:17:00] working maybe I'm not where I'm supposed
[1:17:02] to be maybe and all it is is you're
[1:17:05] standing upon the word of God
[1:17:07] and every day that you're standing every
[1:17:09] day that you're confessing the word
[1:17:11] every day that you're lifting your hands
[1:17:13] and thanking God the devil Ain't Got You
[1:17:19] every time he's fighting you shows he
[1:17:21] ain't got you
[1:17:23] so keep standing upon this word
[1:17:29] you don't need Plan B you don't need
[1:17:32] plan C just stay with the word
[1:17:35] it'll work every time
[1:17:38] you believe that
[1:17:40] so we must deposit the word within us
[1:17:42] and I'm going to close here
[1:17:45] that I believe it starts by meditating
[1:17:47] on the word
[1:17:49] and I'm not speaking of just having an
[1:17:51] intellectual knowledge of it but I'm
[1:17:53] speaking upon meditating it on it from
[1:17:56] your heart the word has to get in your
[1:17:58] heart
[1:17:59] Psalms 19 14 David speaks of the
[1:18:02] meditation of my heart see the
[1:18:05] meditation of my heart and Psalms 49 3
[1:18:09] my mouth shall speak of wisdom and the
[1:18:11] meditation of my heart shall be of
[1:18:13] understanding amen so you're not
[1:18:16] meditating on confusion you're not
[1:18:19] getting this and this report and that
[1:18:21] report and that report you're standing
[1:18:23] right with one report and that's the
[1:18:25] word of God and your meditation is not
[1:18:28] meditation meditating of confusion but
[1:18:31] your meditation shall be of
[1:18:32] understanding
[1:18:34] ain't that right
[1:18:35] that's right see and and then you you
[1:18:39] look here uh and we all know it as the
[1:18:43] man thinketh in him as a man thinketh in
[1:18:46] his heart so is he ain't that right so I
[1:18:50] want to say it this way don't think on
[1:18:52] your problems
[1:18:54] and I'm not I'm not being a positive
[1:18:56] thinker here in that way but I do want
[1:18:59] you to repeat after me
[1:19:01] I shall not
[1:19:03] think on my problems
[1:19:06] I shall not
[1:19:10] think on what's wrong with me
[1:19:13] I shall not
[1:19:15] thank all my failures
[1:19:18] I'm going to think on God's word
[1:19:22] gonna think on God's word
[1:19:24] that's where your meditation should be
[1:19:26] I'm going to think on God's word
[1:19:29] and you say man
[1:19:30] don't dwell on what others do or say
[1:19:33] don't meditate on that as Jesus said
[1:19:36] what it is what is it to thee just
[1:19:38] follow thou me
[1:19:40] ain't that right don't think on this see
[1:19:42] don't think upon that you're losing your
[1:19:46] mind
[1:19:47] don't think on that
[1:19:48] ain't that right
[1:19:50] don't think about how sick you are
[1:19:53] don't think on that
[1:19:55] think on God's word
[1:19:57] and God's word says you're well God's
[1:20:00] word said you're healed God's word says
[1:20:02] it all ain't that right that's the only
[1:20:04] way you're going to defeat the Devil now
[1:20:06] is you got to stand on the ground you
[1:20:08] got to have some roots
[1:20:10] to defeat the enemy with
[1:20:12] now now Jesus never or Jesus never tells
[1:20:16] us as to what kind of Trials you're
[1:20:18] going to have he never tells you that
[1:20:20] he just says think it not strange
[1:20:22] concerning the fiery trials
[1:20:25] that come your way no don't think it's
[1:20:27] strange it's going to happen now brother
[1:20:29] Brown says this and this is how the this
[1:20:32] is not mental now this comes from the
[1:20:34] heart now this is what you're supposed
[1:20:35] to how you're supposed to respond you
[1:20:38] say well now brother Branham I don't
[1:20:40] know whether I can move my hand or not
[1:20:43] you'll never move it as long as you
[1:20:45] think like that
[1:20:48] you'll never move it as long as you
[1:20:49] think that
[1:20:51] believe that he has already done it
[1:20:56] then you say that he's already done it
[1:20:59] he's already done it
[1:21:01] now that's what you're supposed to think
[1:21:03] on that's the meditation that you should
[1:21:04] be thinking
[1:21:06] you realize that all the inventions and
[1:21:09] everything that the people are thinking
[1:21:10] people are so gloomy
[1:21:12] negative down
[1:21:15] dishearted
[1:21:19] because they think on nothing but
[1:21:22] negative
[1:21:23] media puts negativity that's all you
[1:21:25] hear on the news negative negative
[1:21:27] negative
[1:21:28] and so you anymore everything is just
[1:21:31] the reports of negative and it affects
[1:21:33] the people
[1:21:36] to where everything is so negative right
[1:21:39] troubles come in the home you know I've
[1:21:42] seen the parents scream at their
[1:21:44] children you idiot
[1:21:46] you dummy I just don't understand you
[1:21:48] why are you always troubling me
[1:21:51] people always have told me when I was
[1:21:53] kids when when my children were small oh
[1:21:56] you better be careful they're Angels now
[1:21:57] wait till they're teenagers
[1:22:00] I never accepted that never would
[1:22:04] why
[1:22:05] because I speaking negative
[1:22:08] sure teenagers go through challenges and
[1:22:10] my children's gone through them and
[1:22:12] we've gone through them challenges
[1:22:14] but by God's grace
[1:22:18] we've remained positive about it
[1:22:23] and you say man why because the word's
[1:22:26] positive
[1:22:29] yeah
[1:22:31] you love the Lord
[1:22:34] see the word helps us in every aspect
[1:22:37] every stage of our life
[1:22:40] so as parents as as we're getting older
[1:22:43] in life as a pastor I have to be
[1:22:46] positive because it's the word the
[1:22:48] positive is the word
[1:22:50] everything about you you're positive you
[1:22:53] you got to be the word is your absolute
[1:22:57] so when you young people you're going
[1:22:59] through your battles and and maybe maybe
[1:23:01] it involves with who do I marry who do I
[1:23:04] do this what job do I take what is my
[1:23:07] future
[1:23:09] where do I go have you ever just been
[1:23:12] there
[1:23:13] in in in the future just right here and
[1:23:16] you ain't got answers and that's rough
[1:23:18] when you're trying to live life go
[1:23:20] through through life without answers of
[1:23:22] the future but you really have the
[1:23:24] answers it may not be specific in the
[1:23:27] way that this is the one you're going to
[1:23:29] marry and this what the job you're going
[1:23:30] to take and this is what you're going to
[1:23:32] do but but but there is there's answers
[1:23:35] trust in the Lord with all thine heart
[1:23:38] and in all thy ways acknowledge me and
[1:23:41] he shall acknowledge the Lord and He
[1:23:43] Shall direct thy past that's an answer
[1:23:47] that's that's that's enough answer right
[1:23:50] there and there's more answers but
[1:23:52] there's that's enough answer to where
[1:23:53] you just don't give up
[1:23:56] it's enough answer for you to meditate
[1:23:59] on to where you just don't look at and
[1:24:00] and just think life and life is just
[1:24:03] gonna always be this way
[1:24:05] no he'll lead you and guide you into all
[1:24:07] truth he'll he'll take you
[1:24:10] if you just say Jesus hold my hand
[1:24:12] can you say man
[1:24:14] we could go more but if the musicians
[1:24:17] will come
[1:24:19] but brother Ram said you'll never move
[1:24:21] it as long as you think that believe
[1:24:22] that he's done it and go say everybody
[1:24:25] say go say he's done it so testify he's
[1:24:29] done it
[1:24:31] he's done it
[1:24:32] well how do you know he said it he's
[1:24:35] done it
[1:24:36] so so so you can apply that to anything
[1:24:39] well
[1:24:42] what if what if my child
[1:24:45] you know what if what if they're lost
[1:24:48] what if they died today in their loss
[1:24:50] why would you think them things
[1:24:53] you'll never get anywhere that way
[1:24:58] if you ain't gonna get anywhere by
[1:25:00] saying well what if I can't move my hand
[1:25:01] well I just can't move my hand
[1:25:05] said you'll never move it then
[1:25:08] so if you keep looking at the negative
[1:25:09] oh well they're doing this and well
[1:25:11] they're doing that well sure Satan's
[1:25:12] going to tell you all that but why
[1:25:14] meditate on it
[1:25:15] why let it go there don't let your mind
[1:25:18] go there don't meditate on them things
[1:25:20] think of what God Said think upon them
[1:25:22] promises
[1:25:23] because the the the ultimate the word of
[1:25:26] God has complete authority over every
[1:25:28] situation
[1:25:30] does it not
[1:25:33] so he says this way and this applies not
[1:25:36] only to healing but applies to anything
[1:25:38] that you want to look at
[1:25:41] but he says believe that he's done it
[1:25:43] and go say he's done it and act like
[1:25:46] he's done it
[1:25:48] act like it
[1:25:51] he said move it an inch and if you can't
[1:25:55] move it
[1:25:56] let's take it all move it a little bit
[1:25:58] further
[1:26:00] see the next day just say I'll move it a
[1:26:03] little further the next day say I'll
[1:26:05] move it a little further and Satan says
[1:26:07] well that's as far as you can go you say
[1:26:10] back because see he'll enter in your
[1:26:12] thought and say well see you can't do
[1:26:13] that you're well that's just the devil
[1:26:15] anything negative is of the devil
[1:26:18] right because there's nothing negative
[1:26:21] in Christianity
[1:26:22] so the devil will tell you well that's
[1:26:25] as far as you can go and that may just
[1:26:26] come as a thought but you say oh no
[1:26:30] I'm going on
[1:26:32] and keep on with it and stay with it
[1:26:34] great faith will bring you right now
[1:26:38] see a little faith will bring you on
[1:26:41] anyhow if you'll stay with it
[1:26:44] just when you see the ray of light
[1:26:47] follow it stay with it it'll bring you
[1:26:49] out and you say Amen do you love the
[1:26:52] Lord
[1:26:54] we could go on but
[1:26:57] we'll leave it there and start maybe
[1:26:59] next week or whenever but God bless you
[1:27:04] once though
