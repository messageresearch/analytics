of God you permitted him to draw a little bit of light there just for the bride and in the evening time it shall be light and we know that there's darkness in the world and gross Darkness from the people and Lord we don't never want to uh dwell on the negative side because we have such a bright future and a promise and Escape out of this land but truly Lord we the reality of it is um it's all falling apart very very very rapidly and Lord It's just prophesied to be that way because this is Satan's kingdom this is his Zenith this is his time but Lord you said in all of that you would have a bride and we're so thankful to be part of it you called us ordained us to be thus predestinate us put our name there oh God how we thank you for this wonderful message every time we think about anything that's going on in the world we say thank God you send us a prophet Lord even because you even said in Malachi 4 that L you have to Smite this Earth with a curse you sent a prophet even for that reason oh God how we thank you and I pray for these requests brother Shay and his family there not feeling well you pray that you touch him and Kevin also brother Bob the different requests given

brother sha as he brings the morning message and Lord we may we feed on the word of God may it be a lamp into our feet and a light into our pathway and Lord may we even though we've been in the message many many years but Lord may it never become common or old or grow staled and may we never just take for granted these things but truly Lord it may be fresh manner all the time for us even though we've heard it before Lord truly it is fresh because the Bible's inspired it's eternally inspired how we thank you Lord that we can come worship you this morning the doors are open the freedom we still enjoy how we thank you for that Lord we just bless your name Lord bless all that's done and said this morning we ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen you can be seated I love I love you Lord

glad for the blood amen that'll never lose its power and we have felt the power of it in our lives amen I believe we all have and and we're so thankful for that uh the musicians can be dismissed and if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the Book of Revelations the uh first of all the 17th chapter amen and um look at that uh for a few moments praise the Lord amen this off amen and then I need some there we go um but you love the Lord amen we want to um remember this uh evening around 4:30 uh for those who would want to uh meet at sister Psy's and was going to just sing some songs and and uh for an hour or so and uh maybe just just encourage her a little bit and so if you're wanting to go uh you're more than welcome to come and uh also we want to uh keep uh little shuile in our prayer and uh uh yesterday morning brother shmaya had U went up there to um feed the baby and notice a not uh be on his around his J his ear swollen a little bit and uh so he had uh made mention to the nurse and um nurse come in check the temperature and I think it was 101 or so and so um we had I'd went up there and prayed with the uh the baby and um so while we were there uh in the room the uh they come and draw blood and uh baby didn't cry at all uh through all that and but it's oxygen went all the way down just you know it supposed to be up 98 and went down to one and uh so it was a little concerning uh but after a little bit it got back up uh there to normal but wouldn't eat uh he he he wouldn't eat and um so this morning um um they say that the knot is still there the SW swelling is still there and its white blood cell count uh is up and so uh they were waiting to hear from the doctor so don't really know what's going on at this time but I know of course parents are really worried and um and um rightly so you know I mean it's just a normal thing but we want to really pray uh for the child and and that the Lord will just touch that baby and I believe he's going to and uh brother shemaya of course is sick and so I know that's got to be uh rough on him wanting to be there and uh but not able to at this point but the baby um weighs uh 5 lb 2 O I believe as of yesterday and so this is good and and um um he's they've moved him up from the the room that he was in or they call it pods the Pod that he was in to another uh area so it shows that he's improving in things and so we're really thankful to the Lord for that and uh so as we go into the word uh maybe we just pray and let's just pray for that baby that the Lord will just uh come by and touch uh touch the child and and uh just give Mom and Dad strength there so let's bow our heads father you are our great physician Lord father we have no one that we can turn to but you when the doctors say there's no hope or they don't understand or know what's going on Lord we know that you've got it all in control we realize that it's just a spirit a demon that is trying to afflict that child but Lord you did not give us the ability maybe to work in the medical field some do but Lord you have given us all the ability to lay hands on the sick and to cast out Devils father and we're just um asking that you would go to that area that room where that baby's laying father Lord as it can't help itself is just relying upon mom and dad and others Lord we're just your children relying upon you now that you go by and just heal that child May the swelling go down and the temperature the fever break and whatever is going on Father we pray that you would touch him make him well father and be with Dad and Mom father Lord Brother shemiah sick pray that that you would touch him Lord fathers they just weary Lord being up there in that that area that hospital for all these Time Lord I know it's got to be uh weary on them but father just renew them in their strength and their mind their body their spiritual walk with you father we just give it to you now and I pray that you had just bless the ministering of your word Lord father we can open the Bible we can read with our natural eyes father but Lord it would take you to just reveal it to us I pray Lord that what simple words we would have that you would just Inspire it to as father make us more like you make us better equipped to face the enemy oh Father we just humble ourselves before you now in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen amen and amen Revelations the 17th chapter and we're going to start at the first verse and there came one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vows and talked with me saying unto me come hither and I will show unto thee the Judgment of um the great that sth upon many Waters with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication so he carried me away in the spirit uh Into the Wilderness and I saw a woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and 10 horns and the woman was arrayed in purple in scarlet color and decked with gold and pre ious stones and Pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of Abominations and filthiness of her fornication and upon her head forehead was a name written mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots and Abominations of the earth amen then um Revelations the 18th chapter the fourth verse and I heard another voice from from Heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues amen you can have your seats this morning and um it's certainly good to just to have everyone um um I know different ones have been sick and some may be still struggling in their bodies but um um we know the Lord is is the Healer amen and um I I want to just speak on this thought coming out of Babylon we've uh talked about it um and this is the the age that um God is calling us out of of of it and um and I thankful to be part of that that time I think think it's more than just uh uh going to a message church but the message must have a an impact it must have an influence over our lives in every aspect of it and um and so this this is what it's doing in this age one of the things that Babylon is known for uh and and I guess is still uh known for is is confusion uh so when God calls us out of Babylon he's calling us out of confusion and and this word confusion is a state of disorder a mixture of several things so um um God is not the author of confusion he is um uh everything that God does is original um if if it then that that was all the way from the beginning uh of time God is the original of creation and so Satan is the author of confusion he is the one that mixes things up he's the one that brings other things into the picture but when it comes to God he's original and this original means consisting or constituting the origin or the beginning and so uh God is the origin originator of what comes from him anything that comes from God he's the originator he does not copy things he does not impersonate things uh uh if God's going to do something it'll come from him he doesn't need to copy off of what anyone else does man copies off what God does Satan copies off what God does but God is the originator and he can be the originator because he's the only one that can create God is the Creator and so uh um so he's the originator and the word originator means the source or cause from which something arises so God is the source he's the originator so there is an original love there is an original uh godliness there is an original patience there's original Joy there is an original uh Church there is an original creation there is a a a a an original marriage there everything that that God does he it's an original thing and and so uh then then everything that Satan does just brings confusion because he is an impersonator uh and and and and to impersonate is to act like or look and and pretends to be like amen he's not really that but he he copies he's a pretender he's an impersonator and so remember it's it's Satan is the one that said I will be like the most high amen I will be like so so then then he's an impersonator he's wanting to copy not not just copy something he wants to copy God himself amen he wants to copy he wants to be God and so in in 2 Thessalonians 2:4 uh uh Paul would talk about it and say he as God sth in the temple of God so he sits in the church showing himself that he is God Amen but he's not really God he's just an impersonator he's a copycat and and uh so uh we would call it a fake he's just um uh a knockoff right and and so uh so then then we see how uh there is a lot of confusion as to who is who what is what because um uh uh he wants to be like God and so he can he can get so close amen he has been working on this for so long to where he's come to a Perfection to where it's it's really hard to know the difference between if it's really God or if it's act actually Satan looking like God and and so uh now you know uh uh Satan is the worship person of the world today Satan is and the prophet said the people are ignorant of worshiping Satan but it's it's Satan impersonating himself as the church see the church see they worship Satan thinking that they're worshiping God through the church so so this is where we're at now Jesus already propes side of this day for he said that it would be so close so close that it would actually deceive the elect if it were possible but now it's not possible because the elect can know the difference and God would make sure she knew the difference amen by sending a message in this age now so it it would be so close so such a lookalike that you couldn't tell the difference you know um I used to uh uh I told you before I used to sell shoes and they were knockoffs you know they were Nikes or knockoff Nikes and and Adidas and you know and all these things you know and so you get people coming up and we sold them for 20 bucks you know and and so you you could if you went down to the and bought the real thing it'd be 300 200 bucks you know so they were just yeah I mean they were just beside themselves when they come up and saw these guys you know and uh they thought they were really real you know they thought they were Nikes you know and the only thing difference was the Nike instead of it you know having that swoop up it ours was down you know it had to swoop down you know and so they were so excited and they were calling friends Nikes for 20 bucks you know and of course I I couldn't sell them you know a Nike for 20 you know and and let him go home thinking they got Nike you know so I'd have to tell them look these ain't Nikes you know they they just look like Nikes you know but but it it it was just all it was just a little difference and most people didn't know the difference they they didn't know so they were so excited you know now this is just the truth I had some of them buying 20 pairs of shoes you know loading their their you know and uh but now when I told him it wasn't really Nike they really didn't care you know so I was thankful for that you know uh uh but but but you know in in the day that we're living in when it comes to religion it really makes the difference in in what you really have it it really makes the difference if you've got the goods or you don't if you got the genuine or you got the fake you you know what I'm saying and so so there is a a so much confusion and and if we're not careful people join the church and come into church thinking oh I got it I got the real thing and you know and if it God would send a prophet that would really be honest with us to tell us the difference whether we got the real thing or we didn't get the real thing and I I'm so glad that we've got parents we've got preachers we've got we've got lay members we've got people that'll actually tell someone whether it's the real thing or if it's not the real thing instead of just letting them go thinking they've got the real thing now we find that Satan comes as a teacher of the word he comes as a pastor he actually even comes as a prophet amen he comes as a deacon or as a trustee and in judas's case he he came as a Treasurer and uh following the message of the hour he comes as a lay member or a Sunday school teacher he comes as one who is wealthy um and got great personality and great influence and or he comes as one that is just pours job's turkey you know and uh has to lean against the wall to Goble you know uh uh they just so poor and and so but Satan comes in any way that he that he he wants to come and and this is why uh uh uh I think it was Peter or Paul talks about men uh uh crept in unaware among you uh be because it was so close you know and and and and and that was a deceptive age all the way down has been through deception but there's never been a deception like this age here amen Jesus never said about any age where it' be so close that it deceive the elect but this age right here can you say Amen now if if it wasn't that a deceptive age back then and even in Jesus's day look how close it was and look how deceiving it was and yet it wasn't the most deceptive age but when Jesus said one of you going to betray me and Judas is in the room not one of them looked at Judas and says I knew you were that one you know no no they all said is it me is it I is it I you know and and had no clue that the son of predition was sitting right there among them see it was deceptive but not as deceptive as this age that we're living in but notice how Paul would expose him he says see he opposes everybody say he opposeth see Satan opposes and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped ain't that right now we we know that this man of sin is not going to be revealed it wasn't promised that he would be revealed except in this age there there would be a people that would actually be able to look at him and and say I know exactly who you are you you understand what I'm saying and so uh but his motives no matter what he comes in whether it's a teacher whether it's a musician or whether it's a uh uh uh uh lay member or whatever uh the spirit of him he comes in opposing and exalting himself above all that is called God or that is worship now brother brandom says now Lucifer thinks and exalts himself above the humble word of God's truth by the knowledge of the Revelation so he exalts himself above the revelation that God gives his people amen anything that God does anything that God shows himself to be amen and even even brother brandham says he Associates himself with the real thing amen see and so and and that's why he would tell us that the Baptist would not they're not deceiving amen the formal churches Catholic and that's not deceiving type amen we're so far beyond that that that's not the deceiving type and and and even even even the Pentecostals really they're not really a deceiving type look at them today they're they're so they're so entrenched in dead and formal and and all of that but it's up to the real thing can you say Amen now see so so we we're looking at this because God wants us to come out of confusion he's calling us out of this confusion Satan will never be able to agree with the full word of God he agrees with part of the word amen but he will not agree with the full word ain't that right see and so then then brother Bram would tell us then we need the full word of God we need the full word of God in this age ain't that right so now how can we tell the difference between what is false and what is true well brother brandham he he asked that qu how can you tell them how can you tell them apart he said give them the word test how how can you know it speak the word and see what they say about it if they don't believe the word they have no seed germ in them they are of the evil one and deceive you ain't that right so brother brandham says uh in another place he said the people exalt him they exalt him above all that's called God the authority of a denominational Church the peoples uh believing that denomination more than they believe God Amen so God can do something in in a way of miracle and if the if their denomination says that the days of Miracles are passed they won't won't even believe in in Miracles you you remember that brother brah talked about that man on the radio he got the gave the challenge that anyone that can prove a miracle I'll give you I'll give you $1,000 I think it was so brother brandham heard it and and he says all right he he says I'll take that thousand he said I'll I'll send it to the mission Fields you know he said I ain't going to let that man just just uh make his brag about it so he went and got uh four people four people that were sick and uh uh uh diagnosed medically and then uh medically proven to be healed and so he got four people and brought the doctors in there and that man looked at him and says I tell you what he said you cut that child up he said you you you cut her up and then then then work a miracle and I I'll I'll believe it and brother R said you're you're you're sick he said you're you're sick in the head you know any man that would want a girl a child to be cut up you know uh uh something wrong with that man well he didn't even pay the ,000 you know but uh uh but see that they'll believe their denominational Creed above the word of God which exalts Satan above all that's called God can you say Amen so anything that exalts itself above the word of God then you know that Satan at work right there see now see our coming out of has to do with more than just a physical change from one Church to another church from from one Doctrine to another Doctrine and and and going from one place to another and all that but it's actually coming out of the organizational system it's coming out it's cut doing away with from Creeds and dogmas and and ideology of man and and and and to that that really means to come out come out of the conf confusion see and in order to do that a man must first hear and then Believe the full word of God everybody say full word of God see full word of God and of course I I I be honest now we all know it that that no no no ages had the full word of God uh revealed uh uh uh like it has in this age Luther had part of the word Baptist had part of the word Ley and Pentecostal and and all these things they had part of the word but the full word was to be restored unto us to the ministry of Malachi 4 and the angel 7eventh angel of Revelations 10:7 which they both tied together the prophet of Malachi 4 is the seventh angel of Revelations 10:7 can you say amen and he wasn't to bring a new doctrine and a new idea a new Theory something that just would make us a little bit different from the rest of them amen uh uh you you that would be a David Kesh or that would be a Jim Jones or that would be whatever we're we're not just following something like that but this is the full restoration of the word of God the full word of God had been restored unto us do you believe that see now separation come out of her my people well in the Old Testament God ordained that there be a water of Separation a water of separation and and and in numbers 19 and9 it it it says and a man that is clean Shall Gather up the ashes of the hepher and lay them up without the camp and and uh in a clean place you know outside the camp remember what Paul said let us go outside the camp and let us go unto him and bear his reproach see going out of the camp it must be laid them up without the camp in a in a clean place and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation and what was that water of Separation it is a purification for sin sin is unbelief ain't that right so so we don't have time to go into it today but but but the water of separation is is the type of of our water of Separation so the water of Separation in the Old Testament is a type of the water of our separation in this day which is the word can you say Amen the word of God the revealed word amen see and so in John 17 and6 Jesus said in his prayer they are not of the world they are not of the world even as I am not of the World San ify them separate them from uh uh them through thy what truth sanctify them separate them call them out they're not of this world I know they look like it and and and made they were born Sinners and and and born in sin and shaped in iniquity and and a lot of them are caught up in this denominational thing but the foundation of God stand assur the Lord knoweth them that are is they are not of the world see they belong to God ain't that right so now he's calling for a separation sanctify them and the only way this could happen is through thy truth and thy word is truth Thy word is truth ain't that right now Ephesians 5:25 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify separate and cleanse it see with the washing of Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so then the word is a purification uh for sin for our sin for our unbelief ain't that right another another scripture uh just comes to mind where it John first John I believe he was manifested to take away our sins our unbelief can you say Amen now now notice uh uh so the prophet said see they took the ashes of the hepher and put them in the courts for use for a water of Separation to wash the unbeliever in the waters of separ ation for a purification for we are now washed everybody say we are washed we are washed who's that we the believer we are Washed by the Water of the word of God it washes us it separates us and that's why you can't be a you can't you can't be a Christian and still hang on to the world there is something that washes you but you it's not just out drinking and smoking and all that but it's it's clean in you from every unbelief of man every tradition every Doctrine every man-made thing can you say Amen see so so faith brother bran would quote the scripture Faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word of God that word hearing is understanding amen Faith cometh by understanding if you want in rapturing faith it takes an understanding of the message can you say Amen receiving it believing it and and brother BR say what it does it only separates us from our sin it it doesn't kill you the word doesn't kill you if if you're being killed by the word you're under a law amen of of Commandments if it's condemning you then then you're under a law but the word is really to be used to separate you from your sins and separate you from your unbelief that you can actually walk with God and have fellowship with him how many believes we can have fellowship with him we're we're not waiting to go to heaven to have Fellowship we're having fellowship with him by the separation of the word we've been cut out we we've been separated to go unto him and to have this Fellowship see so so you can understand why we need the word of God preached to us see more than speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues more than singing and dancing and prophesying we we need the word do you believe that now brother Brandon in speaking to the Pentecostal said you twist your baptisms you twist your evidences and you make it fit some kind of a Creed instead of taking the word well let the word bear its own fruit let the word bear its own fruit see you you make some kind of a thing you got to do to bring you an Evidence of it and Satan everybody say Satan can interpret every evidence that you want to put forth sure he can he he certainly can see but he cannot produce the word that's one thing that burns him up he wants to be like God he's doing everything he can to impersonate to show that he is God but one thing that burns him up is he cannot impersonate the word he can't live that word word by word word by word word by word can you say Amen can't bring it the prophet said that's right see so the the devil could make us impersonate every gift you know brother Bram said he could go out here he can make us lay hands on the sick and they recover he can make us speak with tongues he can make us interpret tongues he can make us have wisdom and knowledge but that isn't What It Takes ain't that right amen then brother Brown says to know him to know him is life not to know the orders but to know him the person ain't that right now I found out long ago that speaking in tongues interpretation of tongues prophecy dreams and all these things it does not get you out of confusion amen that's right that's true a young lady I hope this is all right for me to tell this um but a young lady was presented the message and uh she's like oh y'all's a cult y'all's following a man you know and uh and so uh said I wouldn't no sir I wouldn't be part of that M and uh so she working somewhere and here in town and and uh a young man come in and I saw her and at the register and came over there and you know doter says I had a dream last night I've been wanting to know you know I didn't know what was about or who it was for but when I saw you I just knew it was for you so I began to tell this dream and and and and she was telling the dream to a uh well my daughter and uh it was so it was so way out there you know I mean you and and it it puzzled her cuz she she I mean it I don't know you know it was bad about you know this is how bad it was you know maybe an elephant up on the moon or something I don't know if that was a dream but but it was that bad you know and so uh uh and and so but but she had she was telling uh my daughter about it and she was so excited and she said man you know says I uh I uh it baffled me when when he told me that and told me it was for me and I didn't even understand the dream it was so out out far out fetched but if he said it was of the Lord then it's of the Lord and so she uh she said you know I've been thinking about this and pondering about this wondering what that dream meant and I come to figure it out I'm meant to go to Bible school so she now she's building her dreams for Bible school now you know now now I'm telling you now she thought we were a cult yeah following a man right and we got Vindication oh but here comes some guy with a dream that she didn't even know yeah and now she's going to build her whole life on a man's dream now that's how gullible people are in this age that's exactly right so close amen so so then speaking in tongues prophesying interpretation of tongues dreams does not get you out of confusion now gifts of the Spirit they're wonderful yeah and they're in the church but they are to be judged everybody say they are to be judged they are to be judged now if you've known the message long enough you know that there's a difference between a a prophet and a gift of Prophecy a gift of Prophecy has to be judged before the church can receive it yes ain't that right but the word of the Lord comes to a Vindicated prophet and that Prophet doesn't have to be judged he stands before no one brother BR said you never did see Isaiah standing before a group of men you never did see you know uh Moses or whatever uh uh Paul and and all the standing before a a a a group of men no one stands before that Vindicated prophet and judges him but when when it comes to a gift of discernment or a gift of Prophecy a dream a uh whatever it would be it has to be judged before it can be received by the church brother Ram said a man can send his soul to hell with a Divine gift but remember knowing him is life knowing Jesus Christ the person of Christ is life now now notice and I and I hope this all makes sense to you but but justification the prophet said justification made way for sanctification sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in Perfection back to the word again to manifest itself can you say Amen so those three stages the justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen brought forth the revealing of the son of man the word made manifest can you say man see so so the church had to go through these stages justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost uh so that the son of man could be revealed do you believe that see well so does the individual the individual has to go through these stages you have to go through that you have to go through just justification sanctification the baptism of the holy spirit before the word can be made flesh in you amen amen now now watch and today before Jesus comes again the prophet says the full manifestation everybody say the full manifestation of the person of Jesus Christ is to be manifested in flesh and you say Amen the full manifestation of the person of Jesus Christ is to be made flesh or be manifested in flesh think of it Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed what is revealed unfolded it's made known the secret has been brought forth revealed in the day that the son of man will be revealed the world will be in a Sodom condition see and to know him is life to know him can you say Amen now Jesus ain't in confusion he's calling us to come out of confusion unto him that we may know him the person the full word the revealed word for the hour now notice another quote brother Bram says the church will come through justification through Luther through sanctification through Wesley through the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Pentecostal and go right on into the Perfection of the son of man see when that when husband and wife how many is his wife amen you've gone from being bride to his wife the marriage is happening right now you're married to him the word can you say Amen married to him not married to a Creed not married to a Dogma you're you're out of all of that and you're married to him the word see see so husband and wife will be the selfsame persons God will be so manifested into his brightest church till they will be both be the same they are one everybody say they are one you can put it in a personal I am one with him now he says you see where we're at you see the age that we're living in can you say Amen see so now how do we know that it's him in us and it's not just a feeling it's not just an emotion it's not just some good time it's not just a good thought how do we know that we're not just being deceived about this well brother brandom said the word being manifested everybody say it with me the word being manifested is the evidence that it's right amen the word being manifested is the evidence that it's right see the word being manifested he said see but people never look to that they look to everything else instead of to the word they look for all kinds of feelings they look for emotions they look for manifestations of gifts but they don't look for the manifestation of the word hello people speaking tongues and still wearing their shorts women wearing their shorts people speaking in Tong women speaking in tongues prophesying and preaching the gospel and people will ignore that word they'll ignore the word and look at the manifestation of a gift amen and the gift could even be right amen the gift could be even accurate and you say Amen uh uh the one that had the uh the PTL that had the TV program Jim Baker you know when he got out of prison and stuff and of course everything fell apart but he he he come to an audience and it was just right after he' gotten out of out of prison but he uh was speaking before an audience and I was listening to him and he took that word and uh uh depart from me ye worker of iniquity I never knew you and so I thought that's going to be interesting and of course I wasn't even we weren't even in the message at the time but he he broke that word down new intimate I never had an intimate relationship with you I never you know uh I never CA you to conceive NE never planted my seed in you and I thought wow you know this is profound you know Jim Baker talking about this you know and he says you know and and he says this has really been made made clear to me known to me he says you know he says when we got to talking about the days of the PTL and things he said we would have I'd have a man come in and he said he could read he could tell you your whole life he could read everything about you tell you where you live tell you what's wrong with you tell you I mean read you like a book and go right outside and use the lord's name in Vin and smoke and cuss and he said that happens all the time it's not the gift it's the word amen can you say Amen see so they look to everything else instead of the word so brother BR says how will you know him he is when you see his nature his word being manifested and doing just exactly what it's always done then you know that's him that's why in a when a church gets formal and they say they've got God in it that's not God God's not in that church it's true if God started his Pentecostal Church on the day of Pentecost and look what them people done by him coming in them it so quickened them and then people just sit there on a Pew barely say Amen barely worship God barely they got so restricted in their worship that the people can't even be free to sneeze anymore so how will you know it's him he is when you see his nature his word being manifested and doing just exactly what it's always done then you know it's him you can't change him come on Church you can't change his way Hebrews 138 says you can't he's the same yesterday today today uh uh yesterday today and forever ain't that right so so then see this is the reason that God sent the prophet of Malachi for to us he came to introduce Jesus Christ the [Music] word such a deception as to wondering what's right who's right what's going on where is he this look looks like it's God this looks like it's of God this looks like it but that God would send a prophet right to introduce he's got the key to introduce to us Jesus Christ Lord if you believe the message you have to believe that John the Baptist was the key to Christ he was the key to knowing Christ ain't that right for his message introduced the Messiah it wasn't a a group of people it wasn't a denomination it wasn't a bunch of preachers there was a prophet and he came to introduce Christ to the people ain't that right now notice brother Brown said that same Spirit see Elijah spirit that that same spirit that was upon John the Baptist shall appear in the last days to bring the people back to the word without that prophet but you ain't coming back to the word no one will come back to that word without this message of the hour he was the anointed one to bring the people back to the word so that the bride will know her husband know her mate the revealed word so this bride isn't going to be deceived God sent a a a message to introduce to her Jesus Christ right that's right bring her out of this confusion bring her out of this mess you can't introduce people to a living Christ through a Pentecostal message you can't even introduce people to Jesus Christ by a Baptist message there's one that has the key to it to introduce Jesus Christ to this bride and that's the prophet of this age as John forun my first coming so shall your message forun my second you realize you can't even introduce people to Jesus Christ by the nine spiritual gifts if that me the case the Pentecostals would have had it they would have had the key and there had been no reason for Elijah the uh a prophet to come in this age it amazes me you know when I hear people within the message ring say we need to get the people to Christ before we get them to the message you can't get to Christ without knowing this message can you say amen amen if the prophet was to stand here and introduce Jesus Christ where was he going to introduce him at in The Bride Can you say Amen in the bride get the people to Christ before the message they don't understand the message then the message is Christ the message is Christ what is the message it's the shouten remember the Lord himself would descend with the Shout with the shout the shout comes from him yet it's the message of the hour why because that Prophet is Anointed of Jesus Christ amen to declare him and introduce him to the people that's true John the Baptist went out into the Wilderness Prophet said because he didn't want to get mixed up in all the traditions of the church he had an important job to do amen he was ordained of God to introduced the Messiah and notice the prophet said see he got away from all that mix up all that confusion one saying of this and one saying this and one saying this and one saying that he just got out of from all that confusion because he had a job to do and that was to introduce the Messiah and he had to be sure that he knew he was the one can you say amen he had to be sure of who the Messiah was see he couldn't take the denominations idea of it amen because the denominations did not know who he was he couldn't take just the lay member's idea of it because the lay member didn't know who he was he couldn't take a preacher's idea of it because the preacher didn't know who he was he was the one amen as a prophet ordained to let everybody know who that Messiah was do you believe it and did you realize the world would have not recognize Jesus if a prophet hadn't come you say oh that's nonsense well you you you take that up to God then yeah come on God winess sent a a prophet John the Baptist and give him a specific me Ministry to introduce Jesus Christ if the world was already going to see him can you say amen amen but it took it took a a prophet to stand there and thank God you could know now listen you can know who that Jesus Christ was the true word because he did not go to a denomination he did not go to some lay member he didn't go just to any old preacher he went to the prophet because the word always comes to a prophet and because it was John's mission to to uh uh introduce him to the people Behold the Lamb of God you believe that see so we find brother Bram says now we are told that in the last days that will repeat again there is going to be a message come forth that will introduce the Messiah to the people you believe that so this message is so different from the rest of them in the other ages this message is to enter roduce Jesus Christ Living the person Jesus Christ and you must have it in order for the elect not to be deceived so close that it would deceive the elect so close but God would send a Vindicated Prophet to introduce the real Messiah can you say amen amen he says see he says come forth a message that'll introduce the Messiah to the people and it'll be in such a way they'll stand dumbfounded like they did then but he promised it amen he says so how will the people that's believe in him know it unless they're constantly in the word to know what he is Daniel said the wise shall know but the foolish the unwise wouldn't know but they shall know their God ain't that right now I won't keep you just too much longer but brother Bram says the Bible is a living forto witness of Jesus Christ do you believe that see so as the Earth has growed into its fullness uh uh and also Vines grow into their fullness the day grows into its fullness well the Bible was manifested in its fullness in the person of Jesus Christ see he was the word of God revealed the whole Complete Book of redemption the Bible is God's word forthtelling the future events its Believers is commanded by its author to read and to believe every word of it not just part of it one word to disbelieve it you might as well quit trying until you believe that word see every word is absolutely a part of almighty God God made manifested wound into his word to show forth who he is and we are commanded as Believers to believe every word of it do you believe that and and and I can say this it it whatever whatever uh uh uh you're dealing in in your life whatever situation you've got to take the word to apply it don't just apply it when you come to church apply it when you're facing troubles apply it when bitterness is trying to come in uh apply it when doubt is trying to come in apply it when when unforgiveness is is trying to take over apply it when pride is trying to take over take that word and apply it then you're believing every word of it don't make excuses one ey OD every word is absolutely a part of almighty God God made manifest wound into his word to show forth who he is and we are commanded as Believers to believe every word of it and it's wrote by the author of God himself see there is no one nobody can add anything to it or take anything from it if you would it would be a freak body of God it would have maybe like six fingers in one hand and three arms and or something you know add to something take away something from it maybe an arm short one finger short it's the complete body of Jesus Christ and in Christ being the male the groom the bride is represented in him also and these two are one and when does it become manifested that they are one in this day that's right for at that day you'll know that I'm in the father and the father in me and I in you and you in me ain't that right brother Brown says what complete picture we've come to the complete picture see and the True Believers in this word who accept it that way believe it and with patience wait for its prophesied promises every one of them to be manifested in its age every believer has watched for it every believer that's been on the toes watching is the one that's it's been revealed to aren't you glad for that yes sir see so those who make up the the bride of Christ the wife of Jesus Christ in this day has come out of confusion got to come out of the confusion why because we've got to identify who he is this bride ain't confused on any promise he got confused on one promise that he's the same yesterday today and forever ain't that right but this bride is not confused on any promise of the word of God she's watching for it she's waiting for it you believe it and it's happening it's happening see now if you look at it the the Pentecostal age was a time of God restoring the gifts to the church that's was the Pentecostal age but there was so much confusion absolutely in it the Propet said it's because the people didn't know how to control the gifts so much confusion and and if you wasn't part of that that that type era of Pentecostal uh you really wouldn't know you know what was in it but if you could go on YouTube and kind of watch the uh what it's led to today in The charismatics Barking like dogs rolling on the floor and shaking and one of them you know one in a Revival I think it was the Brownsville Revival woman came up and said the spirit of the Lord told me I needed to bark like a dog or how like a wolf and she's like oh Lord you mean that you really I got to do that yeah you got to do that so here it goes oh a spirit of the Lord Spirit of the Lord if it hadn't been for a prophet we would have been caught up in that stuff we would have been justce confused but there's so much impersonation and and so it gives you the idea of why the importance of brother Brown standing against that spirit that was trying to take over the church that poor man you know when you really think of the pressure that brother Brandon was under what he had to go through how many knows Kenneth Hagen well you know he claims to be a Prophet too and someone sent me a a a a a uh meeting of brother brandham a full meeting now we only hear the we only hear him preaching brother brandham me uh preaching but there's actually recordings of the entire businessman's meeting and before brother brandham gets up they introduce Kenneth Hagen and Kenneth Hagen gets up and starts prophesying over the people and the people oh yes yes now brother bradon's got to come on behind this yeah so we just hear him preaching a sermon oh I and and I wished I knew what message he preached it was a it was a barn burner and yet he had to preach that Kenneth Hagen standing there sitting behind him claiming to be a prophet yeah pronouncing blessings and then here comes the true Prophet it makes you it just makes you thankful that brother brandham couldn't be bought that he couldn't be swayed he wouldn't turn to the left or to the right he didn't bother about popular opinion he didn't bother about hurting people he just had to speak the truth but what was he doing he was introducing not a me not an impersonality not a a a a another prophet he was introducing Jesus Christ we needed it so we wouldn't be confused right in Pentecostal there was so much impersonation that came with it and sad to say there still is imperson ations uh that that that are happening and and many of it was considered to be of God but it wasn't many acted upon impulse thinking it was God many of them acted on you know uh sensation feelings uh uh Impressions whatever and and so uh uh but that that doesn't mean it's the Lord you you can be impressed to do something but that don't mean it's the Lord and and so but then there was that genuine article but they they brought disorder to the church brother BR said it disorder confusion can you say Amen brother random actually called the Pentecostal meetings a modern confusion of Babylon a modern confusion of Babylon it it is so you know you know uh uh how many how many men have been prophesied over that they're called to preach and they ain't got a lick of calling in their life there ain't no anointing in it they just stand there and just talk there ain't anointing in it but because somebody prophesied or had a vision or had a dream that they're standing behind the pulpit you understand what I'm saying it even got so bad that they were rearranging marriages that's happened and it's happened in this message you talk to some up in Canada some guy claimed to be a prophet and he he split marriages because he saw that they weren't supposed to be together it's a mass of confusion can you say Amen am but see it it was a massive confusion because it didn't work according to what the Bible teaches now notice what the prophet said God never placed signs ahead of his word he said amen that's a scorcher God never placed signs ahead of his word they were added for proof of the word but the word come first to prove it Elijah said to the woman bake me a cake first then watch the miracle happen come to the word first then watch the miracle see the seed word itself is what the Holy Spirit energizes another place brother Brown said the leadership of God is follow the Vindicated word of the hour by the Holy Ghost oh I'm feeling led to do something let it be within the bounds of the Vindicated word of this hour oh I feel to prophesy it better be within the bounds of the of the Vindicated word for this hour can you say Amen say see we we're coming that's the leadership of God they that are Le they that are the sons of God are led by the spirit of God oh I feel that it will be within the bounds of the Vindicated word you're following the Vindicated word you can't be so outled or so led by the holy spirit that the Holy Spirit takes you from the Vindicated word of this age of the hour can you say Amen nope the more you're led by the Holy Ghost the more it takes you in submission to what the prophet said for this age you believe it now brother Braham said speaking in tongues is a gift of God but it's subject to what's on the floor at the first place now there Christian there's where you make your mistake he said now I don't know someone told me that Monday night or Tuesday night when I was preaching that somebody spoke in tongues while I was preaching it's a good thing I didn't hear it or I'd have stopped and called you right out called you out right there cuz you was out of order can you say Amen what's he doing now he's going to bring order into the church he's bringing order because we're he's taking us out of confusion is this okay see he don't speak he said see the Holy Spirit if I'm anointed of God speaking by the Holy Spirit he's speaking here he don't speak over here and over here and over here see it's a confusion the Bible says that Christian see so that's right we must get those things down in our heart everything has to come in its season amen do you love the Lord amen just a little bit more time and then I'll close coming out of Babylon coming out of confusion do you realize that that tongues and interpretation of tongues and prophecy it's a private Ministry go ahead that's right brother bradam say it's not an open ministry right as is the five-fold ministry amen ain't that right he said it's a Ministry to help the church but it isn't to be done in the main congregation he said it's the only way I'm going to tell you is to it's to be done so brother Bram he was pretty strict on that it's the only way it's to be done it should be done in a room a private room separate from the congregation then he says then whatever a brother speaks another brother gives the interpretation then let someone write down on paper what is said he says now we all know that the coming of the Lord is coming we're aware of that how many knows the Lord's coming if you don't know that you've been living in your closet the Lord is coming he says now see and and if brother Neville got up brother Neville being a preacher being a pastor being he's he's the part of that five-fold Ministry if brother Neville got up each night and said behold the Lord is coming behold the Lord is coming that would be all right see but he's saying that the pastor at the platform for he's got the word for that can you say Amen he's got the word for that and if he be a pastor a prophet to the church or a pastor rather he's to study the word of God and tell you what's written in the word of the Lord about the coming of the Lord and you warned by that ain't that right but a Ministry otherwise to the church which he wouldn't have any connection with is tongues interpretation of tongues which is prophecy or a prophet speaker see that's something that's not written in the word what's written in the word the pastor brother Neville you know what the five-fold minut he's to bring it see but what's not written in the word is what you're to tell him prophecy tongues yeah hello yeah now he's going to give us an example because he's not going to take us outside the word right so he gives us an example of what this kind of a Ministry interpretation of tongues tongues and and these things what it's for for ex instance tell brother wheeler thus sayith the Lord tomorrow in his sandpit not to go to it because there will be a truck turn over or something like that and it's got to be done hello see so he says when these people meet together in in a room see let them who have wisdom first come because you see if one speaks in tongues and gives an interpretation according to the scripture that cannot be received unless it be witnessed by two or three people two or three two or three more witnesses see has to witness that that they believe it to be the word of the Lord and that's to be done before brought before the whole church ain't that right now notice why is it because sometimes in these minor Ministries now Pentecost put them Ministries above the five-fold ministry anytime they wanted to speak in tongues anytime they wanted they just felt led to jump up they just jumped up whether the preacher was preaching or or whatever brother brandom says you know for someone to jump up and start speaking in tongues while the preacher is going on he said it'd be just as bad if if the if the song leader or someone else got up and started singing a song during the preaching as just as rude just as disorder confusion hello see so sometimes in these minor Ministries just like any other Ministry you get Spirits that's wrong they'll fly in there and we don't want that we don't want confusion amen we want these Ministries ready to be exposed if they're to be exposed because anything that is of god you don't worry about exposing it it'll stand the the test if it's of God so just like the pastor if somebody challenges him on the word he don't have to back up about it he knows exactly what he's talking about see come come on up here see and the and same as these other Ministries got to be the same way and if one speaks in tongues and gives a message see now people speak in tongues when they're just edifying themselves and the Bible says they're just having a good time they'll speak in tongues they'll feel see they they they do speak in tongues they actually speak with tongues and it's the spirit doing it but if it's sitting out there in the audience speaking in tongues just edifying themselves it isn't anything profitable for the church it's the man edifying himself or the woman or whoever's doing it ain't that right but to speak in tongues is a gift of God to edification as Paul says in the scripture that's to edify the church so it had to be some direct message from God to the church outside of what's wrote here in the Bible do you believe that it must be a direct message to the people of something that's fixing to take place or something they should do you love the Lord now I want to say he did not do away with speaking in tongues did not do away with the nine spiritual gifts amen did not do away with that can't show me in the Bible where he says it can't show me in the message where it says it Paul didn't take away from it brother brand said I preach what Paul preached ain't that right but what did he do he took the confusion out of [Music] it so he says now when you go into a meeting the first thing you do you go in there and you have a bunch of tongues and interpretations and somebody raised up and and keep quoting the scripture now that's carnal absolutely God said for us not to use vain repetitions well what about him then if he's wrote it once you believe it you understand what I'm saying if he's wrote it here believe it I'll go even as far as if God sent a Vindicated prophet and what he says you believe it you don't need some other uh Prophet to come on the scene just take what God Said ain't that right see so if he's wrote it once you believe it he don't have to say it again tongues and interpretations is right but it's to be a direct message to the church and to somebody another place it cannot be repeating scriptures he's already wrote that it must be a direct message to somebody yeah and then before it can be received then two or three Witnesses at least two out of three had to witness it was of God and then them Witnesses have to be proven can you say Amen so two or three two out of three Witnesses had had to witness it was of God or it wasn't received if they said it's of God they wrote it down they signed their name to it thus said the Lord tomorrow at 2:00 tell brother Jones to move away from that railroad track there there's going to be a wreck out there and his house will be torn up in the wreck they wrote it down because they thought it was of God it's a direct message right and you say amen amen not the lord loves you the lord loves you now it's okay for a minister to say that because he's taking the word of God and he's showing you all through that that well brother Brandon said this is a love story it's love secrets you understand what I'm saying it's a love letter to you brother will so there's a pastor there's an evangelist there's a teacher of the fivefold ministry that takes this word and let you know just how much God loves you but you don't need somebody to prophesy over you and say oh God loves you God love that's vain reput just take the word of God and believe it that's all right well for some it is see what we're doing is we're anchoring our faith in the word that's right anchoring our faith in the word I remember when we was in the Pentecostal when we got discouraged we needed somebody to have a dream need someone to have a vision needed someone to prophesy so we'd start feeling better but what about when that prophesy ended if you can't take the word what makes you think you're going to believe that a word that's Vindicated a word that's being revealed healed then what makes you think you're going to take somebody else's word then you're going to wonder about them when that preacher Falls then you realize that preacher ain't preaching all the way right then how you going to ank yourself on that prophecy then you just go from church to church Revival to Revival prophecy to prophecy before you know it you become sign Seekers instead of just staying right with the word of God can you say Amen you love the Lord see so we believe what is written in the word now then God sends a direct message cuz we I can't tell you what's going to happen tomorrow I don't know if you're going to be in a wreck tomorrow but wouldn't have been something wouldn't it be something if God moves upon somebody in the congregation yes and begins to tell exactly what's going on and what's going to be I believe that happens that's just me amen and I believe it'll be so direct that it ain't going to be well God's going to bless you in the future yeah come on that's right you know what I mean amen lot of these prophecies that are going forth It's so it's so open that that you can't just sit there and judge and say all right let's see what time it's going to happen that's right but brother Bram said you should be so direct it should be so specific amen amen at such and such time this is going to happen don't be there well then we'll know if something something happen right one place brother BR said to prophecy go forth and tells a brother said don't be at your house because the tornado's coming at 2:00 something like that and said sure enough 2:00 here it comes totally destroys the home but then next service everybody's rejoicing because brother Jones is with them or brother so and so's with them and and God spared his life he said if it doesn't happen that way then you got a lie in spirit among you but anybody anybody can can tell you well brother Amos you got it you got it okay great well got what yeah got money got the chills amen chicken poie what well you know what do I got you love the Lord if the musicians will come so brother Bram says then after a while maybe a spirit of Prophecy come among them that wasn't in the main Auditorium where Sinners and things were setting that was in their own room the gifts operating then the first thing you know some prophecy hit one there's a lot of difference between a gift of Prophecy and a prophet see a gift of Prophecy may be on one tonight and never again and be on another the next night see it's them nine spiritual gifts that works in the body but a prophet is born to Prophet all down through Li their life it's thus sayith the Lord but a gift to prophecy has to be judged but you never seen anybody you know stand before Isaiah or Jeremiah to judge them no but the Bible says if one prophesies let two or three judge whether it's right or not see because Satan can slip in there then these discerners with the spirit of discernment then said you know thus said the Lord tonight there will be a woman see how direct it is there will be a woman coming from a certain place she'll have a green scarf over her head she'll be brought in she's from Ohio and have brother brandom to lay hands on her but first before doing that tell him to tell her that she was a Treasurer in a certain Church she stole money and that's the reason she's paralyzed you'll make that right and God will heal her see discerner raise up and say well that's that's of God another one says I believe that's of God see so all right they they put that message down then when it come to the platform a little buzzer rang from my study I walked out here's these prophecies was I give it to the people right the way it was wrote there with the man with discernment on it see no slip UPS there they was see and and that night there come a woman in she's in a wheelchair caught whatever it was she's brought up there green scarf all the congregations looking for it there she was I said lady you stole money out of the treasurer when you was a young that's right that's right brother brandom that's right God forgive me I'll make it right well stand up to your feet Jesus Christ makes you well well there it was see brother Jones move away tomorrow at two: it's going to happen see all right he moves away and it happens well fine we thank the Lord go on but what if it don't happen now there's an evil spirit among them see they don't get that no more till they pray that thing away see cuz you know I said you know you don't want that Spirit on you you don't want no Folly you don't want no Hawks right right you want the real holy ghost or don't pass any at all he said now you put your church in that kind of order and watch what Pentecost Rises to do you love him aren't you glad that we've been able to come out of the confusion whereas what Paul says I know in whom I have believed I know in who I put my trust I know whom I anchored my soul to Hallelujah not a gimmick not some impersonator not some impression not some feeling or sensation I've anchored my soul in the Haven of Rest Jesus Christ I'm glad for that hallelujah what song word make it plain give me the word it's a light that I might see give me the word [Music] [Music] oh it's been tested it's been tried searching minds are satisfied though the story's old the message still is true it's been ridiculed it's been chained still its power is never changed it'll stand the test forever give me the word oh give me the word make it plain and clear to me give me the [Music] word hallelujah give me the word [Music] over every situation give me the word now I don't want it watered down sugar coed or profound give me basic truths that last the course of time oh preach it strong preach it clear so that all the

victory over every situation give me the word sing the last lines over every situation give me the word over everything all we need is that word just take the word just believe it till the word becomes us can you say Amen you love the Lord be wonderful to us today amen I love the Lord as I had announced uh I think last Sunday or so that we would um don't have the dates before me but uh we're
