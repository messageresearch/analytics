good all the time amen not in the way the world wants him to be amen I was musicians can be dismissed but uh uh listening to someone today and and they were ex given the reasons why you know America uh is not uh it's going to prosper and things and uh the individuals said it's because God is good he's merciful you know and he's uh not a god of judgment but we know that he's good uh but he's a god of judgment amen and I I see God is being good because he saved my soul I see as being good because he's answered our prayer and and he's made the preparation for us to leave this whole world amen amen and um if you have your Bibles we're going to first of all turn to the Book of Psalms it's uh good to be here uh back home and um I appreciate the prayers uh for us and um appreciate brother Amos filling in uh for us last Wednesday and um heard yall had um a good service and so we're thankful for that and um uh just uh to say that this Sunday uh We've announced it but we'll be having an evening service uh this Sunday and uh um a time of testimony of songs and so um uh if you can make it we'd love to have you and and U always enjoy that time and also uh there will be no midweek Service uh next week due to Thanksgiving and it's just hard to believe that it's uh around the corner we're facing another time of Thanksgiving and uh seem like the older I get the faster the years go uh but uh this is good uh because we're going home it's a it is an indication that um we we we're not going to be here much longer amen and uh so uh the book of Psalms uh the 46th chapter and I'm going to to uh start at the first verse but it says God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble therefore will not we fear though the Earth is removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea amen um if you'd like to also turn with me to the Book of Proverbs the 3 chapter amen Proverbs chapter 3 amen and um we'll start at the fifth verse says trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not to thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy paths amen let's just uh bow our heads our hearts to the Lord precious father we're so glad that we can sing the songs of redemption and know Lord what we're talking about father you truly have been good you have been merciful to every one of us and Lord we're here to give you thanks for that and we're now asking Lord that you would just move among us tonight and Lord help me to get myself out of the way and uh Use Me Lord to be a blessing to your people and father May the word have preeminence in this service and in our lives father is our prayer Lord bless those that are sick father pray Lord that you would heal them uh those that maybe for some reason or another wasn't able to make it tonight I pray that you would help them bless them Father meet their every need father and we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen amen and amen and you can have your seats this evening uh just a simple thought this this evening um but I like what David said and uh just been thinking on that uh is that God God is a present help in trouble in the time of trouble God is a present help and so if he is a present help then and he's not a god of History so we we we must not treat him as such or make him as as just a historical God uh the the the scripture uh Hebrews 13 and8 has been uh made very very clear to us that he Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever throughout the Bible we have seen God as being uh a present help for his people um when when they needed protection God was a present help when uh Israel needed a deliverer God was a present help when uh they needed mercy God was a present help when they needed an atonement or uh when they needed a token uh God was a present help God's always been a a a present help even even when when we look at uh Rahab the Harlot uh needing Redemption needing that mercy God was a present help amen and and it's it's been this way when Israel needed a way of Escape God was a present help and he's always been there he's not not as a bystander not just as one that looks on and sees the need and and yet does nothing about it like a lot of folks do today uh get out their camera as there someone's getting beat up or something and uh they they're just the bystander you know but God God's never been that way to his people but he's he's always been there as a a present help you know it's one thing to be there and then not being able to help or uh or not taking the action to to do anything but that's not God and and this this whole this Bible is is God in action and and anytime that we have seen God's people in trouble amen God has always been there to to to help them to to bring them through to deliver them uh uh and and and these things you know and and and so God is a present help in every situation you know we we you may have problems maybe you have a plumbing problem and you're you know you got to you got to call the the plumber and and maybe he can get to you maybe he can't or if you're having the electrical problem you're going to call the electrician if you're if you're needing mechanic work done you're you're going to you're going to call the mechanic and and these things or if you're needing the doctor then then you'd go to the doctor uh uh for him to to help you and and we we've got all kinds of of of of professions if we could call it that that that can help us in in in times uh when we're needing a uh uh uh the things done I I if if we could say it that way but yet and and we're thankful for these things I'm thankful for the doctor I'm thankful for the mechanic I'm thankful you know but I'm thankful for the plumber I'm I'm thankful for you know all of the the the the the things that you know people do but yet they they only work within the natural rim and they're they're Limited in in what they can do and and we all I I'm sure um have been disappointed by Humanity in some way or another uh uh and maybe they've not been able to fix things they've might not been able to help and even though they might have tried to help and even though they might have done done their their best and and yet uh uh we end up disappointed but you know when you need a miracle uh then who are you going to call who who are you going to go to you know there there's no man that can perform a miracle no doctor can perform a miracle no no uh no Banker no no lawyer no no nothing they they can't perform the miracle no no politician is a miracle worker it's just you know when when you're when you need spiritual help uh well then who are you going to call um you know I know that God works through man and he works through you know the the ministry and and he works through individuals um maybe to help but but you know you you when you look to a man when you when you look uh to any man as the main source of help then then that would be wrong because even a preacher can disappoint you even even mom and dad can dis disappoint you the musicians can disappoint the sound guys can disappoint and and and and you know all all of these things and so uh uh we we know that we can't look just to man in itself and even us we we disappoint ourselves and and uh uh if if you haven't disappointed yourself you might have an ego problem uh you know uh there but I I think if if we could all just admit it that we we have disappointed ourselves we've come short many times but but we we find that that uh people can look to a minister as though that he is the one to fix their problems and work a miracle and people look to doctors as though they're the absolute and and what their word says is the the the it's it's the thing if they say I'm dying I'm dying you know if they say I'm going to get better well I'm going to get better if they say not do this or to do this and and all of that and you know uh there there's so many things out there uh that uh that that are you know treated as though they're it's the absolute it's the thing but really nothing here is the absolute nothing here can can is is the the thing that can fix the problems but you know uh uh Psalms 20 and7 it says some trust in uh chariots and some trust in horses and in in other words what it's saying is some trust in in man some trust in hospitals some trust in doctors some trust in lawyers some trust in in themselves some trust in the church some trust you you understand what I'm saying amen some trust uh in in in different things but we and and and and we'll put we as the elect of God we the elect will remember or trust in the name of the Lord Our God Amen see because he is the present help in time of trouble amen see uh there there's no David wasn't exalting himself he wasn't exalting the military he wasn't exalting uh government and he wasn't exalting doctors and and all these things uh but what he was saying is God is the present help in time of trouble uh uh Proverbs 18 And1 says the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous again the elect the righteous run into it and and is safe ain't that right and so God uh um in this age of humanity in this age of scientific achievement in this in this age where man is being exalted and and the works of man and all of these things Jeremiah 3 33 would tell us uh God would be speaking to us through that Prophet call unto me and I will answer thee call unto me and I will answer now I I believe that God answers prayers do you believe that I'm not just saying it because I'm a Christian I'm not just saying it because someone else told me i' I've seen it happen I I've I've seen uh you know uh uh God answered my mother's prayer uh when I was a child many times but I do remember a time now we were very poor dad worked at the school and and and we you know a lot of times didn't have uh uh you know uh money to make ends meet and and but uh one time the dryer quit working and we we we couldn't call that technician to come and fix the dryer or or to even buy a dryer and all that but my mom was a woman of faith and I I just remember laying her hand upon that dryer and she began to ask God to to make that thing work and you know uh when she got done praying she switched on that switch and it and the thing started working again uh uh but God answered her prayer because he's a present help in the time of of trouble uh you know Dad tells the story of when he run out of gas and he didn't have money to to get more and and and so he he prayed and and the truck wouldn't start before the prayer he tried to start it but but he just prayed and asked God to be merciful and to uh to help him get home and and he said right before his eyes that tank uh the gauge went from E to full God was a present help in time of trouble amen you you brother Andrew uh was telling me you know a couple months ago of how that when he was a boy and and you know uh he he lived with his mom uh most of the time and and and and they didn't have just a lot of money but they would went somewhere run out of gas didn't have the money to get gas and he said they both just bowed their head and prayed and God gave them a tank of gas because God is a present help in time of trouble I remember when Seth just a young uh boy and me and him was out selling shoes and it take me 2 hours to set up the the display of shoes and just got it all set up had one box left and and I wielded out of the trailer had that uh metal trailer and Seth had his fingers on the side door and the wind blew and and I heard a just a uh the the door slam and uh then Seth started screaming and looked and his fingers was right caught in that door and opened the door and his his uh uh the the finger was broke and and it was all bent and there was a Blackness and swed up and I didn't have time to to get my shoe I couldn't leave my shoes there I was in a rough part of town and and that was my livelihood and so I I just said Seth you want you want Daddy to pray yeah I want you know and and so we took off our hats and we just began to pray and he when when just immediately he he stopped his crying and at the end of the prayer we looked and the fing finger was back straight and the the swelling went down the the the color the Blackness was gone amen and and and because God was a present help in the time of trouble I Faith uh uh uh just in one instance was skating you know in our basement there in Pennsylvania and me and the boys were gone to town and so it was her and her mom and and and an uh just a a little girl at that time and but but she had uh uh uh broke her ankle and the bone was protruding you know and and Rebecca didn't have a way to to get uh to the hospital we didn't have cell phones at that time and but she began to pray and and that bone snapped back into place and and Faith continued on skating see God was a help uh a present help in time of trouble uh we had just got back from uh just got out of church at brother Roy I had been ministering there and and and Daniel had the door open and somebody come and shut that door the sliding door to the van and his hand was in that and and we opened the door and and and there was a mark there and he was just a balling and I remember uh uh brother Roy and and and the church just we all gathered around began to pray and and immediately the pain had left and and the swelling went down and and because God was a present help in the time of trouble Levi suffering with an ear rake and and and laying there on the couch and we went and just prayed and laid hands on him and and immediately the pain had left and because God was a present help in the time of trouble amen Judah when he was just a little baby and Rebecca had passed away and me and the children were driving uh uh on we were on the road and we were coming from Arizona back to PA e and and and we were in the and he was a sickly uh baby and and uh choking a lot and losing his breath and and a lot of things going on and and you know I we didn't know how to Faith was only 12 at the time and we just didn't know what to do and but we were in the in the hotel room and his fever shot up to 105 degrees and and I couldn't I I couldn't get it down I was having uh uh wash claws on him and I called Mom and and she said well Sean you got to you got to go get some Tylenol or do something and and so I I told the children I said well I got to go uh y'all just stay here but I said let's pray and and and ask God to be merciful to that child and and and and so we we all gathered we laid hands upon him and I went to go get whatever I needed and come back and Judah was crawling around playing and and and and they said the moment I left he just got the feeling the the fever broke and it was because God was a a present help in the time of trouble and when she was born uh uh she was born without a hip socket and doctor said she's going to need surgery and if she had surgery she she would always walk with the lip uh limp and and and so uh uh it was beyond our control and yet uh uh uh the church began to pray and uh Heather or Rebecca took her to a specialist uh uh uh to schedule for surgery and he said well I want to do my own X-ray and well he had begin to work on around her hip and pulling her leg and all these things and he he he said something's not right and he he said brought in another physician and he began to look at said well I want to do my own x-ray something something went wrong something going on and when they took the X-ray there was a hip socket right there and and there was an x-ray where there wasn't a hip socket and then an x-ray where there was a hip socket see God was a a present help in the time of trouble amen uh sister Jane was telling me uh uh you know that that I had told that story about an and and one one she started having hip problems and it got so bad that when she left the church to go home she she got home she couldn't even get out of her car she was hurting so bad and she didn't know what to do and and and and it come to her come to her about Anne being healed and she said God if you can do that for Anne you could do that for me she said I'm just asking that you would touch my hip and immediately the pain left she got out of her car and she never had problem with that again God was a present help in the time of need amen sister Brenda talking about how that she was diagnosed with something you went to the doctor she having some pain or something and the doctor found thought he found tumor or something to that effect and they found something my li found something with the limp node and uh of course we don't take these things for granted amen and and and we we know what these things can be but uh so the the doctor was a little concerned and she come to get prayed for and and went back and the doctor couldn't even find anything that was wrong and it it was because God is a is a present help in the in the time of trouble ain't that right Heather was having some health problems and and and uh uh issues and and so uh uh she made an appointment with the doctor and and she got to the doctor and the doctor began to check her out and and you know the doctor gave her a clean bill of health and and and and whatever was going wrong amen God just totally took care of the problem because God is a present help in in the time of trouble amen there's many times that you know there's been times that we haven't had money money uh you know and and and you wonder where maybe all of us has been in this you know and and you wonder where you know where it's going to come from or what what what what do you do and all that and and you know I was telling the children the other night that any time that I ask God to supply my need God that I'll always get a call for the most part might take a day or two but but God will uh uh call somebody to call me amen for a stunt job they want to stunt ground and and God has always provided our needs be because he is a present help in in the time of need amen now we could all say it this way when we needed a savior God was a present help in in time uh of trouble when we needed mercy God was a present help when I've needed encouragement amen God will will move upon somebody just to give and encourage surging word amen because God is a is a present help in the time of trouble amen I think that's all of our testimony amen if you ever if you're ever a Christian and and you're you're walking with God Amen you you you know what it is to experience the supernatural amen none of these things are by accident amen God is a present help in the time of trouble amen someone you might just be needing prayer and and I've had you know uh uh Sister Kim uh uh Brumfield the other day just text me I was going kind of going through some things and and and uh uh well I was just kind of well yeah just going through some things and and a text you know she sends a text and she says I'm praying for you I don't understand the need but God has laid you on my heart and I wanted you to know that I'm praying for you what is that God is a present help in the time of of trouble amen see now now it it's amazing of how easy it is for people to forget God Amen they they get into trouble and and forget that God is a present help or or they just ignore God they just ignore the fact that that he is there amen and and it it reminds me of in second king uh the first chapter we read about King uh Isaiah I believe it is and who fell through a latus uh in his uh upper chamber Second Story home I guess and got sick and and notice what he done he sent Messengers to inquire of Bel bbub amen bbub the god of acran whether I shall recover of this he he told The messers Messengers go to this God of Beelzebub amen the god of acran and and and ask if I'm going to recover now notice in 2 Kings 1 and3 but the angel of the Lord lord said to Elijah the tishbite Elijah the prophet right arise go up to meet The Messengers of the king of samarra and say unto them is it not because there is not a God in Israel that you would go to inquire of be elub the god of acran now therefore thus sayth the Lord Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which Thou Art gone up but shall surely die amen now you think of it that that king of isra Heen uh uh uh uh uh he he uh uh that that King there he saw more value in in that Idol amen which that's that's exactly what it was just an idol amen he saw more value in that Idol than he did the prophet of God Amen now you think of that amen see uh but there there uh was also another king ASA Amen in in first chronicles 16 and2 who trusted in another King instead of trusting in the Lord and in the second verse and he sent to uh this ASA uh he sent to Ben Hadad king of syah that dwelt at Damascus saying there is a league between me and thee as there was between my father and thy father behold I have sent thee silver and gold go break thy league with Basha uh uh king of Israel that he may depart from me now go into the seventh verse amen and at that time hanai Hann hanani or whatever the Seer or the prophet see came to ASAC king of Judah and said unto him because thou Hast relied on the king of Syria and not relied on the Lord thy God therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand see we're not the Ethiopians and the lubans uh uh a huge host with very many chariots and Horsemen see where you know he said and yet because thou didst rely on the Lord he delivered them into thine hand he says for the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to show himself strong he's still doing it today he's running through and fr throughout the Earth to show himself strong can you say Amen in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect for toward him here in thou Hast done foolishly he's talking to a King now that did not trust in the Lord but trusted in another government Amen to take care of his problem amen so therefore from hence forth Thou shalt have wars then ASA was rought with the Seer with the prophet and put him in a prison house for he was in a r AG with him because of this thing and ASA oppressed some of the people the same time and behold the acts of Asa first and last Lo they are written in the books of the kings of Judah and Israel and ASA in the 3 and9th year of his Reign was diseased in his feet until his disease was exceedingly great now notice yet in his disease he sought not to the Lord but to the Physicians he never considered the Lord amen to to be his help to be his healer he sought the Physicians amen now think of it his disease got worse and and and worse and and yet he never took the time to acknowledge the Lord amen the prophet said this about this King ASA got a disease in his feet and he died with it because he did not ask the Lord for Divine Healing but he just went to the doctors alone can you say amen amen the moment you start looking to doctors and said of the Lord as your healer amen something's wrong amen it shows that you have departed from the Lord I'm I'm thankful for doctors amen but I'll never put a doctor over God can you say amen amen that's right see he just went to the doctors alone he couldn't ask the Lord for he was too stubborn see he just got to a place where he just begin to listen to some modernistic views and didn't believe maybe or didn't believe the Lord healed so he didn't consult the Lord nothing about it he thought well my doctors can help me and there's no need of asking anybody else oh my that's a pitiful condition can you say man amen when when we we looking at the doctors as our absolute amen and we'll let the doctor put fear in us we'll let the doctor rule our life amen when there's a God in heaven amen that is more than able to deliver there's there's a God in heaven that's more than able to preserve amen and bring us out can you say Amen see so if you notice this king's actions showed he didn't believe in Divine Healing and the prophet said it he didn't believe in Divine Healing he didn't believe that the Lord would answer his prayer he didn't believe that God would preserve him amen so he just trusted in the physici he trusted in the doctor but the doctor couldn't help him but he was too stubborn to simply just ask God God I need you can you say amen amen that's right now notice if if the king would have believed in Divine Healing if he would have believed in God and the ways of God you know what he would have done he would have went to the prophet that was in the land amen the prophet of God Amen let me ask you who did the shunamite woman go to when when her baby was laying there dead did she go to a physician did she go to a politician did she go to to whatever no she went to the prophet of God yes sir amen the prophet Elisha amen who did non go to get rid of his leprosy it was a prophet of God he went he went to the prophet ain't that right amen how did God become a present help Amen to Israel when they were in Egypt amen God sent to them a prophet and God through that prophet's Ministry showed himself to be a present help in the time of need that's right you see the prophet says amen amen that that uh uh uh the prophet was God's representative amen now you know how how did God become a a present help in the time of need amen for the Widow of zerath you remember it was a time of famine amen and this lady was going to die she she had had her last meal prepared and then her and her son had already committed themselves uh that they they it was hopeless there was no help and there was nothing and and they were going to die amen but God was a present help to her in time of trouble by sending her a prophet amen with thus sayith the Lord and Elisha said the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the cruise of old fell until the day that the Lord sends rain upon the Earth can you say amen amen see she found that God was in his representative God was a help in time of trouble yes sir you see before Christ came God represented himself in the prophets Amen brother Bram said and God's obligated out of that channel amen out of the Prophet that Prophet is a channel channel to whom the word of the Lord comes to and out of that channel God is obligated to make that word come to pass just exactly the way it's promised the seed will grow so God represented himself in the prophets of the Old Testament then he represented himself in one man Jesus Christ amen for when Jesus was upon the Earth that was God in Christ and God showed himself to be a present help in the time of trouble when the blind would come to him when the lame would come to him when the when the when the uh the dead amen or whatever it would be look at Martha Martha when her brother Lazarus had been dead for 4 days in the grave already decaying amen but when Jesus walked into it it up up there amen uh uh uh Martha didn't despair amen for she knew that God God had come in that representative amen she recognized that Jesus was the representation of God upon the Earth amen the prophet said she seen too much Supernatural in him she saw the works that were Supernatural she couldn't doubt now even though the problem was too impossible when it seemed like all hope was gone God was there in his representative in the time of trouble I am you believe it amen yes sir and she acknowledged the Lord amen you see the prophets had a portion of God Jesus had the fullness of God for he was the word but we find today the prophet says today God is representing himself in his church in the church how many's part of the church amen then you know what that means is God God's representing himself in you amen you you're not just here to be a church member you're not just here just to learn about God Amen you're not just here to have a knowledge of God and then God become a historical God you're not in a in a Sunday school lesson amen writing all the stuff and yet you don't know what God is you're here as a representative of God the supernatural God is living inside of you you're the repres representative of God now notice Colossians 1:27 now notice this has been a mystery that's been hid to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this ministry among the Gentiles he didn't make it known to the Jews it didn't make it known to the Samaritans this mystery has been made known among the Gentiles in this last day amen which is Christ in you everybody say it's Christ in me it's Christ in me I am that representative Christ in me the hope of glory now notice what Matthew 18:18 uh Jesus says verely say unto you whatsoever you shall bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven again I say unto you that if two of you shall agree on Earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven now church that's not a wish that is a promise that is God speaking to his representative here upon the Earth God was speaking to his church knowing there would come a time that he would come into them and live through them and express himself prise the Lord you see he's a very present help in time of trouble in you you believe it amen he's not a myth out there not some Spirit floating around he's in your body you realize you take him home tonight because he's in you you take him to work because he's in you you take him to the grocery store because he's in you he's a very present help in the time of trouble when you need him he's a present help can you say Amen wherever you go you take him with you because you are God's representation amise Lord why would he give us power to loose and to bind well you know we walk hand inand with him we're supposed to walk hand in hand with him but we're not walking without direction we're not walking just aimlessly that's right but there's a direction amen we've quoted this scripture many times Jeremiah 29:11 for I know the thought that I think towards you sayith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you everybody say to give you an expected end so we're not we're just not wandering around God has an expected end God has a destiny God has a goal for every one of our lives that are part of the church God didn't you didn't become part of the church amen because you joined it it was because God by Grace birthed you into this church because he had a purpose for your [Music] life now we know that this plan that God had he had a plan he had a purpose before the foundation of the world according to Ephesians the book of Ephesians Paul would tell us that it is the Eternal Purpose with uh which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord it's an eternal purpose but we know that we started out in life amen the wrong way amen we were born Sinners we weren't supposed to be sinners God didn't predestinate us to be Sinners he predestinated us to be conformed to the image of his son God didn't predestinate us to to lay as low life into this in this earth and to lay in the slums and the garbage of life amen he didn't predestinate us for that amen he predestinated us to be sons of God Amen but he allowed it to happen Amen to show that we could show he could show us his Mercy can you say Amen that he could show us who he is amen but we started out as Sinners we started out as Liars we started out as Bound for hell amen and this is the reason why the Bible would tell us that you've got to be transformed by the renewing of your mind transformed trans everybody say transformed you got to be changed you you you got to be made different you you got to come from one thing to another thing transformed ain't that right amen it also tells us to be conformed to the image of his dear son in other words we are to be changed we're to be changed from sinner to Saint change from servant to son change from bondage to Freedom change from Mortal to to immortality change from corruption to incorruption change from Wars Amen to peace change from sin Amen to righteousness we we've got to be changed and it's a journey that God has has called every one of us who is a part of the body of Christ to walk it's a it's a journey that we are walking amen that's right see now if you look at the world the world is degressive I know they're making Promises of a better future it will not happen this world is degressive and it's becoming more and more and more amen it's it's making in other words it's making its descent it's it's in a downward spy it's just going down it's and and further down and further down why because they are under the power of Darkness amen they're under this power amen of deformity they're under this power amen and and and the power of darkness is of the devil how many believes that for he is the ruler of darkness and he is doing his best amen now notice what he's got he's got control of the government he's got control of the natural Church he's got control of Education he's got control of science he's got control of everything but one thing he does not have control of and that's you and I as the body of Christ amen see amen look look at this you know and and he's trying to get us amen he's trying to Captivate Us he's trying to to bring us in under his rule he's trying every which way to keep us from becoming what God ordained us to be that's right but Paul said in Colossians 1:13 Christ has delivered us from the power of Darkness amen how many's been delivered come on Church you been delivered he's delivered us from the power of darkness and he's translated us into the kingdom of his dear son and in other words we're under another government we're under another kingship under another headship Christ is our King can You amen he doesn't begin to be our King in the Millennium or or in the in the new heavens and the new Earth he is our King now we are under his domain yes sir now we have been given the power to bind and to loose we have been given the power not everybody but we as his Representatives on the earth we've been given that power you don't have to know Knuck down to the devil you have been given the power to bind that devil can you say amen amen and when bondage tries to come upon you you have the power to loose yes sir you have the power now notice Luke 10:19 behold Jesus said behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing everybody say nothing now come on church we all know what nothing is it doesn't take a a a high school education to even know that nothing shall by any means hurt you Hallelujah prise the Lord right can you say Amen who's that you the ones that's been given the power that's right to tread upon serpents and scorpions on on over all power of the enemy see acts 1: 18 but you shall receive power not when you start just getting a religious spirit on you a religious feeling but you'll receive power after that the Holy Ghost comes upon you and you shall be Witnesses of me ain't that right now just to say it it's not our power it's not my power it's not your power a ain't that right but notice 1 John 44 you are of God little children and have overcome them you've overcome every SP Spirit you overcome every devil you've overcome every trial every situation every Antichrist spirit that rises up you have overcome them why because greater is he that is in you yes sir than he that is in this world can you say Amen so now this power has come by a person coming into you Amen on ain't that right amen The Living Word see so don't don't don't think that you have something to do with it amen I I you know it's it's amazing when people bless God and they they they you know oh God God God but then they put themselves into it I've done this and I've done that and I'll make this and I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that you ain't doing nothing without the help of the lord lord so don't think that you have something to do with it can you say Amen even the Bible tells us don't you lean to your own understanding amen now Paul showed us the the power that a Believer has even over the natural yeah remember when he was laying wood on the fire putting wood in the fire and he's laying that wood down there Bible says a Viper rose up and bit him brother brah said that Viper was so ven venomous poisonous that he should have dropped dead within seconds ain't that right but what did Paul do Paul just shook it off shook it back off in the fire he didn't worry about it he just continued on because he knew that he was a representative of God he knew he had the power over that thing right praise the Lord hallelujah can you say amen amen he shook off the Beast and Into the Fire the Bible says and he felt no harm the prophet said see Paul looked at it not a bit more scared than nothing walked over and shook it over the fire and acted as if no harm would ever come and went right ahead he wasn't scared he said the reason it hurt you is because you get scared don't be scared Hallelujah I want to say this don't you worry about things don't you Fred about things when situations come don't you worry about them situations God help us all can you say Amen see Paul wasn't scared see he said the reason it hurts you is because you get scared don't be scared if you can get a perfect love of God in your heart that knows that this is the truth and God is your father and that he's taken care of you there is nothing everybody say there's nothing there is nothing that can harm you there's no natural serpent there is no no spiritual serpent there is no trial there's no weapon there is nothing that can harm you if you notice acts 28:4 it says when The Barbarians saw this venomous snake Beast hang on his hand they said among themselves no doubt this man is a murderer whom though he ha escaped the sea yet V Vengeance suffereth not to live now think of that here they saw this thing happen to Paul and automatically they think he's a devil amen he's Something Wicked man amen and that's that's that's just the norm people think they see us going through our trials they see us professing Christianity they see us living the life and they see us and then they see us going through hell and they see us going through discouragement they see us going through trial after trial oh yeah they get an opinion of us they oh they're worthless oh they must be Sinners oh they must be amen they're following an Ault they're this and they're that they've all got their opinion of us when we're all going through the valleys and and we're going through the uh uh the storms but notice in the sixth verse how be it when they looked when he should have swollen or fallen down dead suddenly but after they had looked a great while and saw no harm come to him they changed their minds and said that he was a god they changed their minds oh my why God was a present help in the time of trouble show amen Lord you know in the Bible Satan is called that old serpent the devil I just say to you that God is proven he's proving to the world that we are not what they say we are true by showing them that that old serpent the devil cannot harm us you may go down but you're coming up you may weep now but joy is coming in the morning you may be struggling now in your trials but you're coming out amen why because there's nothing that can harm you you are a representative of God upon the Earth amen God is a present help in the time of trouble you see the Bible even says that every knee is going to Bow and every tongue is going to confess that Jesus Christ is Lord can you say amen and I'm telling you right now he is showing that he is he is Lord through you and I we are his Representatives here upon this Earth and he's showing himself to be a present help in the time of trouble yeah amen the world thinks us to be miserable creatures and failures and you know just no bodies but they're going to be surprised they're going to be surprised eyes when they come up to that white Throne judgment and see us St sitting upon that Throne can you say Amen they're going to be surprise church now we're going to sit on that throne with him hello we're not the one that's going to stand in that judgment we are the ones that's going to overcome we are the Overcomers and we're going to sit with him upon the throne what a surprise on that day that old you know that old nobody neighbor of ours they got in this this this cult bramit they're poor they just you know whatever but what they don't realize is we're representatives of God can you say Amen you love him you see if you notice Paul was God's representative to the people yes sir Peter was God's representative to the people acts 5:5 they brought forth the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches that at the least the shadow of Peter passing might overshadow some of them there came also a multitude out of the critics round about unto Jerusalem bringing sick folk and them which were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed everyone can you sayen why God had a body here upon the Earth and he could show himself to be the Pres a present help a present help you see Peter was a coward Peter was the one that denied the Lord but then when he come amen uh on the day of Pentecost he was one of them that was in the upper room that received the Holy Ghost amen and he was one of them that received power to become sons of God can you say Amen now what is the Holy Ghost brother Bram said it's the spirit of the word amen what is the holy ghost that comes to you it's the spirit of the word amen that comes to you that's right it isn't Goosebumps amen that may come upon you it it you know it it it it isn't you know come to you there to make you shout and dance and speak in tongues and roll over the on the floor you might do all that stuff I I don't know but I'm telling you that's not what it's there for amen oh yeah you get emotional but that's not what it's there for amen you see amen see God sends the Holy Ghost to his elect for a greater purpose amen than to prophesy than to run over the building and and and to shout and rejoice we you we do them things and and and we love it but God sent the Holy Ghost to you and I for a greater purpose now notice the prophet said the spirit of the word is the holy spirit that's what quick it the word the letter kth the spirit gives it life see gives the letter the letter see just a printed letter life where does it come to now this letter becomes living inside of you see and makes it manifest brings the word to pass exactly what God promised can you say Amen see that's what that's how you're transformed that's how you're changed amen is you you're changed from sinner to Saint because the Holy Ghost comes inside of you and there's a predestinated seat all of this word is speaking of you do you believe that this ain't a fairy tale this is God's plan written in letter form and then he comes down and inside of you and begins to Quicken every promise to you changes you from sinner to Saint changes you from bondage to Freedom changes you from a slave to a son it changes you can you say Amen it quickens see so the power amen so so that's how you know that the word is inside of you because the Holy Ghost quickens it the Holy Ghost comes to you and quickens it that's why the Holy Ghost will never leave you amen because it's there to Quicken it's there to make sure you're going to make it brother Branson it's there to make sure amen sister Janice that you make it in a Rapture amen it's there to Quicken that word oh sure you may be going through the valley but you can't be counted out yet because the Holy Ghost is there as a present help in time of trouble GL see the power isn't in the emotions and S and Sensations it's in the word amen that's why John 15:7 if you abide in me Jesus said and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you so God is in his word not in emotions not in Sensations can you say amen that's right he's in his word that's why brother Braham said if the word abides in you then you're anointed person with the word you abide in me and my word in you then ask what you will it will be done for you that's Christ in you anointing the word for this age or whatever whatever age they lived in can you say man see so the word in you is Anointed showing that he is a present help come on church he is a present help he not he may not make you a millionaire in this life but he's a present help that's right money's going to fall kingdoms are going to fall this world is falling apart but God is a present help can you say man oh Church bless the Lord the word in you brother Braham said deity is not in heaven it's in you he's a present help it's time to acknowledge that hello God made a way where we can be his representative on the earth now now watch brother Brandon was talking here said the other day over in a little place I was having a meeting over here in toeka Kansas there was a boy a young preacher one of my sponsors brother Roy sitting here remembers the place in this great place this Minister young Minister had got under a roof or a place the sidewall mashed him down beneath that the little fellow was going to die his liver was bursted his spleen was knocked out of place tons fell on him I sat at the breakfast talking to the wife I said wife you know if Jesus was here you know what he'd do I said when he sponsored me I believe that word he was sponsoring Christ when he sponsored me that word the word that he was preaching he was sponsoring Christ and I said see that's a trick of the devil I said if Jesus was here he'd go lay his holy hands upon him that boy would get well I don't care if his liver is bursted he would get well because Jesus would walk in there knowing exactly who he was who he was not the preacher and the young preacher he knew who that man was but he also knew who he was knowing who he was say see and and uh um so so I'm now I lost my place so I don't care if the liver was bursted he would get well because Jesus would walk in there knowing exactly who he was he knowed his calling the scriptures was right vindicating in him that he knowed who he was see not a Shadow of Doubt I I I I hope you get that real clear not a Shadow of Doubt he didn't have a Shadow of Doubt who he was and there not must not be a shadow of a doubt of as to who you are can you say Amen are you with me that's why this this message come for you and and God so Vindicated this message so that when the prophet would talk about you being the bride that you would have no doubt about what he's saying about you amen if he called us The Virtuous sinless spotless bride of Jesus Christ there should be no doubt about that believe Hallelujah yes sir he'd go lay his hands upon him that boy would get well see and he says he knowed his calling Jesus knowed his calling the scripture was right vindicating in him that he knowed who he was not a shout of doubt he had laid his hands upon him and say son be well walk out of there and I said there isn't enough devils in hell to kill that boy then I said he would get well but I said you see honey he was Jesus the holy hands of God he says I I I said I I'm a sinner I was born sexual birth my father father and mother were both Sinners and I'm just a no good nothing and I said but you know what if the Lord would give me a vision and send me down there then that would be different I'd say i' i' I said I'd go down there lay my hands on him he'd come out of that bed if he' give me a vision then I got to thinking after all if it was the vision what was it it was the same dirty hands on him uh-huh same man praying for him same dirty hands in other words the the the vision didn't change who he was right he'd have a vision but it would still be brandom brother brandom's hands laying on him right see so it didn't change it to be holy hands he said but then see I got to thinking after all if it was a vision what was it it was the same dirty hands on him uh-huh same man praying for him same dirty hand then I began to think I am his representative amen then God doesn't see me that blood of that righteous one lays up there upon the altar it makes intercessions for me God have mercy he is my sufficiency he is my prayer he is my life I said the only thing that make me put my hands on him with faith because I had faith in the vision and without the vision the same Faith would do the same thing praise the Lord come on now so brother brandom is saying I don't have to have a vision I just got to have that same faith that I would have in that Vision come on now same Faith would do the same thing so I reckon myself nothing but reckon him my all in all he is my life he is my commissioner no denomination sent me he sent me Hallelujah I go in his name I'll lay hands upon him I walked down there laid hands on that boy and that night he was in the meeting solid well why God had a representative on the earth that God could prove himself to be a present help in the time of need that's right you see it you say well I'm Just a Nobody but there's one making intercession for you amen hallelujah amen the ible says the blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed us from all unrighteousness so what does that mean it makes us a channel for the word of God to flow through are you with me amen God didn't send you the Holy Ghost to Quicken the word into you just to sit there and doubt everything when Trouble Comes don't doubt it amen he's a present help yes sir Hallelujah in you in you amen somebody say it's in Me In Me In Me Now watch brother Brandman his prayer said our heavenly father I bring these people sweetly and humbly to you in the name of your son the Lord Jesus to be sure that my prayer is offered for them to be sure that I did all that I know how to do that they will receive you being that you have been so good to take these old frail bodies of ours and to let the Holy Spirit speak through them it's certainly taking a sanctifying grace of God to do it because we are sinners of no good at all but the Holy Spirit has taken the blood of Jesus and cleansed our hearts and Sanctified our lips like you did the prophet at the altar and now the word of God spoken word of God flows forth to vindicate his presence to this generation before it shall pass into eternity to give an account can you say amen amen see the word of God flowing the word of God well the word of God flowed through Jesus did he not amen he was a representative he was the word the fullness of God made flesh and notice brother Bram and speaking of Jesus said no wonder winds and waves obeyed him uh see obeyed his words obeyed his words because it was God's word through him he was a man but he was the word made flesh and when God when he spoke it was God speaking through human lips no wonder the winds and waves the very creator that created the winds and the waves was in him he was a present help in the time of need now think of it think deep now no wonder demons paralyzed that his word it was God in him it was God in Christ the demons was paralyzed no wonder the dead that was turning back to the dust could not lay there at his word he was the word he said to Lazarus after being dead and stinking four days his face nose had fell fallen in in that much time and yet he said l come forth and a man dead raised upon his feet why it was God Amen he that was in Christ was God see the dead could not stand in his presence for it was God in Christ what was it a present help in the time of trouble a present help can you say amen God had a body that he could work through God had a body that could manifest himself to the people amen death thought he could have Lazarus but God was a present help he says remember God created the winds it's air now he's talking about when when they were in his disciples were on the boat and the winds coming and and and and the waves rocking the boat Jesus was asleep in the boat remember amen he said now God created the winds it's air he created the waves it's water but when the devil got into it he got it to tumbling to bring destruction see also God created men to be sons of God but when the devil gets into them see it's trouble see now that was the devil that got into the winds that sent that storm couldn't the creator that created that wind say go back where I created you is that not what God did in the time of trouble amen when they woke Jesus up he stood there on the bow of that ship and he said peace be still and the winds and the waves obeyed their creator amen why God's representative was there upon that boat amen and God was there in the time of trouble amen but notice what brother Bram says he says then he says isn't that the same creator that was standing on Colorado Hill the other day amen remember God had a representation upon the Earth amen and the storm was coming people were getting ready for this big blizzard that was coming but there stood a representative of God upon that mountain and God showed himself to be a present help in time of trouble prise the Lord then he says isn't that the same creator that created the squirrels then he that was in Christ is in us see for it does the same works that he did the very same thing and I say to you when the devil gets into situations of your life amen it's the same God that created the storm or that that spoke to the storms that created the squirrels that that that that that brought that storm into nothing amen see uh caused it to to to dissipate is the same God in you that will speak to the situations don't you try to handle them situations on your own can I say it this way don't be too stubborn like ASA to ask for his help don't get to the place that you cannot acknowledge God don't make him as helpless as you are don't put him equal with your doctor or with some psychologist yes don't put him on the same level with the church world it would be like comparing a canary bird with a canary brain to that of an educated man that graduated from Purdue there's no comparison that's right God said in Isaiah 559 for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts can you say Amen there's no comparison but can we know the mind of God yes we can for 1 Corinthians 21:16 for who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ can you say Amen yes sir that same God that is higher than our ways and and and higher than our thoughts and he's that same God now that lives in you amen that wants to take over your vessel he doesn't want to use your mind he'll take his own mind he'll take your lips and he will speak his word through your lips he'll take your hands he'll take your feet if you just surrender to K and acknowledge Him in all thy ways he he will direct your paths he will be a present help in the time of need Lord can you say Amen all do you love him we are called to walk with God as Enoch I'm going to try to hurry now we're called to walk with God just as Enoch did which means that we should be in constant Fellowship with him you remember Israel remember every time they went through trouble any time they complained they griped they murmured they left Moses and they went after other things and God said they do always error in their heart because they have not known my ways you understand amen now now we're a people that should know his ways because God has called called us to walk handin hand with him just as Enoch did Enoch walked with God and was not for God took him Enoch was our type so if we're walking with God then that means we should be in constant fellowship with him true constant Fellowship which makes us conscience of his presence at all times it makes us aware that he is a present help at all times can you say Amen brother Braham said when a man will walk for God and walk with God God will walk with that man but when that same individual turns his back from God then God just lets him shift for himself now church we got people all around claiming Christianity but fear is gripping their hearts fear is running rampant in the land it's it's prevailing over the people amen see because why they're not seeing God as a present help in time of trouble they they they join the church amen they're they're living by their Creeds they're they're living by their dogmas they're they're living by rituals they're living by amen the laws of of of dos and don'ts they're living by all that but they're failing to walk with God they're they're failing to to be conscience amen that God is a present help that's why they all go after uh after some politician with all these promises and all and not realize that this world world is falling apart and every promise that he can give you is not going to be fulfilled he cannot do it because a prophet said America will never come back to its place again but God is a present help amen amen can you say amen and what is it they've left him behind as Mary and Joseph left Jesus behind at the Pentecostal Feast ain't that right remember they left him behind at at the Pentecost brother said people are doing that they're leaving they're leaving him behind in other words they're not getting that Pentecostal experience that they need amen they're not realizing they're not getting him inside of them amen to where he can have his way in them there's others that you know are not realizing that he is with them maybe like the two on the that walk the road to emus there Jesus was with them and yet they didn't know it maybe there's there's people like that and and and and and you know they they might have received him and yet don't realize that he's still with him like when when the disciples were there upon that ship and they were going to the other side Jesus in the uh the asleep in in in the bottom of the boat and and and and brother Brown said 10,000 demons swore that day that they would drown him amen and that they would kill him and Satan as we talked about got into the storm got into the winds and the waves and and all of that and and the disciples were afraid because they were at their in they didn't know what to do they they had tried their expertise a lot of them were fishermen and yet they had tried and and they realized they were beyond their their hope and they began to be afraid but then the prophet said it must have dawned on them hold it he's in the bottom of the ship he's with us he's with us and they went and woke him up brother brandham says this he said you know he says he said they didn't have to go say oh Master wake up wake up wake up Master wake up no no no they just said master and he said Here Am iise the Lord car thou not that we perish he said oh where is your faith you have little faith he said that's it forgetting he is with us calling Jesus on the scene to act people today say if I know if I could know for sure that that was him if I could just be sure see how could they be sure how was the disciple sure of it now listen he says not because he was an educated man as far as I know he wasn't he only had the wisdom of God but the worldly education we don't have no record of him ever going to school but some great PR priest and some great renowned person no see see we have no record of anything like that he was just a common man but how could they know it was him he said now listen close don't miss this how could they rest assure amen are see we are sure that thou art the Christ how could they because they had seen the promised word Vindicated in other words made manifest made known The Living Word of Promise Was Made Alive projected right through that body and they know that God was with him they knew that God was a present help in the time of trouble God wasn't a god way back in Moses day in the Years Gone by amen and they're just believing on some God that was but now they how God it presentend and I say to you God is presentent in the church today Jesus amen acknowledge the Lord in all thy ways that's right and he shall direct their paths if the musicians will come I want to say that prayer is such a vital thing to Christians why do we struggle with things amen why do we struggle with believing God why why do we struggle with bitterness why do we struggle with anxiety and fear why do we struggle to overcome things in our life CU often times we don't acknowledge him in prayer true we're trying to do it on our own and we become content with life we we become content battling these situations in our life bitterness becomes the norm gossip becomes the norm dry experience with God just becomes a Norm just going to church not feeling God becomes the norm struggling becomes the norm having difficulty just taking God at his word becomes the norm anxiety and fear and it just becomes the norm it's like we accept it but that's not a Christian Life that may be the life of a Christian but not a True [Music] Believer because God is a present help in the time of need if you've got fear and anxiety God is a present help in the time of need if you're struggling with things in your life God is a present help in the time of need if bitterness and anger is trying to take over you God is a present help in the time of need if you're sitting there and your life is filled with worry about tomorrow worry about the future just worry worry worry God is a present help yes he is what I'm saying is God will help you through that and overcome that thing you don't have to live like that I think what the prophet said he said you Christians don't stay in that lukewarm condition anymore lay aside everything everybody say it with me lay aside everything lay aside everything don't get involved in things that you shouldn't get involved in lay aside everything don't get involved in the gossip don't get involved in the negative don't get involved with [Music] stuff he said just get as close to God as you can walk with him talk with him let everything else be secondary but your prayer life stay right with him all the time can you say Amen but what it is is we try many times to handle our problems and handle our situations just exactly like the world does we depend on things the way the world does and yet we know that they'll never it never works the world's looking for a messiah and yet Messiah has been here all along showing himself powerful showing himself true so showing himself real but that they fail to acknowledge Him and yet they keep looking and looking and one thing lets him down another thing lets them down and another thing lets them down where people are just bitter at God bitter at Christianity walking away from everything that's not the way we should handle our problems the way we should handle our problems is is on our knees prayer Works do you believe that brother brandom in his prayer is's talking to the Lord he says Lord I want to express to you my feeling if I can just in Thanksgiving expressing the very Adoration of my heart that I adore thee thou matchless one I love thee many times in great trials see an airplane pitching in the air falling twisting around and I look on the ground below me it whirling around and just a little prayer and it straightens it out knowing to be plunged to death in a minute standing out before which doctors and Devils then challenging and walking forward and just a little prayer sets them standing paralyzed how demons scream from your children by prayer or scream and come from your children in other words they're delivered by prayer oh your love Lord if the little one is sick come say daddy will you pray for me and see him steal the fever and quieten the child like a mother hushing it on her bosom he's a very present help in time of trouble can you say man can you say that tonight aren't you glad he's
