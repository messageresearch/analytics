[48:55] labored here here uh brother Wayne
[48:57] brother Josh now brother Andrew and they
[49:00] mean very much to me and uh just they
[49:03] stand for the gospel and um you know
[49:07] Satan is attacking the ministry in this
[49:10] day and and I know they go through a lot
[49:12] of things in their own lives and just
[49:14] discouragements but they stay strong
[49:18] amen and they just stay faithful to the
[49:20] word of God and uh I have been blessed
[49:24] by their Ministry and I know you have
[49:27] too and um and but their Ministries
[49:30] would be in vain if there wasn't a
[49:32] people to believe it there wasn't a
[49:35] people to receive it but God looked
[49:37] before the foundation of the world and
[49:39] he placed the gift within these men's
[49:41] lives and you pastors and
[49:44] evangelists and in and and he placed
[49:46] them in this age because there would be
[49:48] a people that needed it amen and uh that
[49:52] would stay true to the message of the
[49:53] hour so God bless bless you as our

[50:21] worldwide Ministry but it's not him
[50:24] that's promoted it it's God that's
[50:26] promoted it and and we've seen God bless
[50:29] him tremendously and we've certainly
[50:31] been blessed here and so we want him to
[50:35] just to preach whatever the Lord lays

[57:03] Jesus here speaking he says I am the

[57:28] speaks again and says henceforth I call
[57:31] you not servants for the servant knoweth
[57:33] not what his Lord doeth but I have

[57:38] into a closer relationship for all
[57:41] things that I have heard of my father I
[57:43] have made known unto you he withheld
[57:46] nothing of Revelation now in the 16th
[57:48] verse he says ye have not chosen me but
[57:52] I have chosen you and and ordained you
[57:55] that you should go and bring forth fruit
[57:57] and that your fruit should remain and
[58:00] that whatsoever you shall ask of the
[58:02] father in my name he may give it you now
[58:06] in the book of Acts the 2 chapter the
[58:08] book of Acts the 2 chapter in the first
[58:11] verse I know we know these scriptures by
[58:13] heart but in Acts chapter 2 and verse
[58:16] number one Speaking here on the Holy
[58:19] Spirit falling on the day of Pentecost
[58:21] and filling the Believers in Acts
[58:24] chapter 2 and verse one the Bible says
[58:26] and when the day of Pentecost was fully
[58:29] come they were all with one Accord
[58:32] somebody say one Accord one Accord they
[58:34] were all with one Accord in one place so
[58:38] they're speaking of unity with one
[58:40] Accord in one place and suddenly there
[58:43] came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing
[58:46] Mighty Wind notice this and it filled
[58:49] all the house where they were sitting
[58:53] amen it filled all the house house where
[58:55] they were sitting they were in one mind
[58:57] in one Accord and the Holy Ghost filled
[58:59] all the house where they were sitting we
[59:01] ask Lord this evening to add the
[59:03] blessing to the reading of his word as
[59:04] you can have your seats here this
[59:06] afternoon we thank the Lord for the
[59:08] reading of the word of God Amen I I want
[59:10] to tonight by the help of the Lord for
[59:12] just a few moments to speak to here and
[59:14] if I title this tonight I want to speak
[59:16] to you on the power of Harmony amen the
[59:19] power of Harmony I I believe that that
[59:22] there is a very powerful uh ele El of
[59:25] Harmony that the devil does not want in
[59:27] the church now in the message question
[59:29] answers 1954 brother B says this he said
[59:32] the main thing above everything is to
[59:34] keep the church in Harmony and in love
[59:36] of God and moving on if we can all
[59:39] believe that the blood of Jesus Christ
[59:41] cleanses us from all sin and
[59:43] unrighteousness he said if the woman
[59:44] sitting next to you or the man sitting
[59:46] next to you if he doesn't believe that
[59:48] Jesus will actually come visibly again
[59:51] he said well let's just believe it and
[59:52] go right ahead anyhow he so we don't
[59:55] agree with him on the scripture but
[59:56] let's make the church move on for
[59:59] harmony because in there we're going to
[1:00:01] catch some more people amen so here the
[1:00:04] prophet of God is identifying that in
[1:00:06] harmony there is the ability Amen to
[1:00:09] actually manifest the desire of Jesus
[1:00:11] when he said I'll not just make you
[1:00:12] Fishers of fish but I'll make you
[1:00:14] Fishers of Men so power uh Harmony has
[1:00:17] the power to draw more people said he
[1:00:20] said now watch but when the church is
[1:00:22] out of Harmony he said then you hurt the
[1:00:24] church then you hurt the ca so as long
[1:00:26] as the church is in harmony amen there's
[1:00:29] a power to draw more people in there's a
[1:00:31] power Amen to further the cause of
[1:00:33] Christ but when the church gets out of
[1:00:35] Harmony he said then you hurt the church
[1:00:38] and then you hurt the cause another
[1:00:39] place he said I believe that everything
[1:00:41] in the natural line amen Works in
[1:00:44] harmony or should with the spiritual so
[1:00:47] everything working in the natural Amen
[1:00:49] in line with the natural should be
[1:00:51] working the same with the spiritual
[1:00:53] again in the Inside Man 1953 he said now
[1:00:56] let their faith just meet that condition
[1:00:58] and it'll be for thou has said as thou
[1:01:01] Hast believed in thy heart so shall it
[1:01:03] be and I pray that you'll grant that
[1:01:05] tonight and make the whole atmosphere
[1:01:07] Lord a creative atmosphere of one soul
[1:01:10] of one mind of one Accord and one
[1:01:13] purpose he said my heart so hungers to
[1:01:15] see that atmosphere see the atmosphere
[1:01:18] is what brings it if every person here
[1:01:21] would get in one Perfect Harmony it
[1:01:23] would be settled amen if every person
[1:01:25] here would get in one Perfect Harmony it
[1:01:27] would be settled see like the natural
[1:01:29] way for an egg to hatch it amen put it
[1:01:31] under the H and it'll hatch because it's
[1:01:34] the atmosphere it's warm but you just
[1:01:36] wrap it in a blanket keep it warm it'll
[1:01:38] hatch anyhow but put it in an incubator
[1:01:41] it would hatch anyhow see it's the
[1:01:42] atmosphere amen that brings the results
[1:01:45] it's the atmosphere that brings the
[1:01:47] results can I give you one more he said
[1:01:49] now this person what if you could ever
[1:01:51] get this Soul on the inside so in
[1:01:54] harmony with God that your soul and God
[1:01:57] would be one together then you could ask
[1:01:59] what you will amen and it shall be given
[1:02:02] unto you I do not believe that that is
[1:02:05] in the future I do not believe that that
[1:02:07] is in the past amen but I believe that
[1:02:10] God of Mark 11 is right here in this
[1:02:12] building tonight amen to manifest the
[1:02:15] desires of the heart of every believer
[1:02:18] amen I believe that God desires Harmony
[1:02:21] in the church how many would agree that
[1:02:23] God desires Harmony in the church amen
[1:02:25] I'll say this Lucifer hates Harmony amen
[1:02:28] and he will do anything that he has to
[1:02:31] Amen to see that the harmony is broken
[1:02:33] amen let me say this Lucifer uses
[1:02:36] Discord Amen to break up Harmony amen
[1:02:39] the Bible tells us in Proverbs 6:19 amen
[1:02:42] that there are seven things that God
[1:02:44] hates in the 19th verse it says a false
[1:02:48] witness that speaketh lies amen and he
[1:02:50] that Seth Discord among the Brethren now
[1:02:53] look at this word strife it means
[1:02:55] Discord amen or or Strife or contention
[1:02:58] now brother B says this one thing God
[1:03:00] hates is sowing Discord amen among the
[1:03:02] Brethren that's right and thems the
[1:03:04] organizations is what does it see it SS
[1:03:07] Discord among the brethren we should be
[1:03:10] standing in the breach saying amen that
[1:03:12] we are brothers amen amen how many
[1:03:15] tonight could say Lord I'll take a
[1:03:16] pledge to what a prophet said amen that
[1:03:19] we should not be standing in the breach
[1:03:21] causing more Division and more confusion
[1:03:23] and more more strife and more Discord
[1:03:26] amen but we should be standing in the
[1:03:28] breach saying we are brothers Amen
[1:03:30] brother said I believe in the fatherhood
[1:03:32] of God and the Brotherhood of Man he
[1:03:34] said and I think we're brothers together
[1:03:36] and that's the way we should be and God
[1:03:38] has his children and maybe some of them
[1:03:40] are a little odd to our belief or your
[1:03:42] belief or mine amen but God has accepted
[1:03:45] them as his children amen so we have to
[1:03:48] accept them as our brothers and our
[1:03:50] sisters Amen Let me just go ahead and
[1:03:52] preach this since I'm here amen just
[1:03:54] because they're odd to us don't mean
[1:03:55] they're odd to God Amen because you may
[1:03:58] be odd to them and they may be odd to
[1:04:00] you amen but God has accepted them amen
[1:04:04] as a part of his Plan of Redemption amen
[1:04:06] he saved them he Sanctified them filled
[1:04:09] them with the Holy Ghost amen I think
[1:04:11] it's time to get back to Harmony I think
[1:04:13] it's time to get back to Unity I think
[1:04:15] it's time to get away from all the
[1:04:16] confusion all the different doctrines
[1:04:19] and come back to the homeland of the
[1:04:20] church which is the message of the hour
[1:04:23] amen and that is where our Unity is
[1:04:26] That's the basis of our fellowship now
[1:04:28] many people think when you go to
[1:04:29] preaching on Harmony amen and unity in
[1:04:32] the body that that it's really not that
[1:04:33] important you know we we've moved on to
[1:04:35] deeper Revelations and more more
[1:04:37] understanding amen but I believe that
[1:04:39] it's more important than we realize
[1:04:41] because I'll tell you why amen we must
[1:04:43] be in harmony or in tune with God in
[1:04:46] order to declare the super natural amen
[1:04:49] we're not here to declare another church
[1:04:51] service we're not here to declare
[1:04:52] another service we are here to declare
[1:04:55] the Supernatural and the prophet said in
[1:04:57] the message Fellowship by Redemption he
[1:04:59] said in the fourth dimension amen people
[1:05:02] can prove that right through this room
[1:05:04] now is coming radio activity radio
[1:05:06] messages they're coming right through
[1:05:08] this building now is coming television
[1:05:10] pictures but it's too fast for our eyes
[1:05:13] he said now you go millions of miles
[1:05:15] beyond that Dimension and you'll get
[1:05:17] into a place that's just as real as
[1:05:18] television pictures is in this room here
[1:05:21] this morning he said and you'll see that
[1:05:23] there's the Lord Jesus Christ he said
[1:05:26] the resurrected Son of God standing
[1:05:28] there and the reason that you cannot see
[1:05:30] him is because our heart hasn't become
[1:05:33] tuned down to it amen our heart has not
[1:05:36] become tuned down to it he said and the
[1:05:38] reason we can't see the television
[1:05:40] picture is our bodies are not set as
[1:05:43] instruments to pick up mechanical s
[1:05:45] things but when our body becomes in tune
[1:05:48] with God becoming a part of him then our
[1:05:51] soul can pick up the power of the Holy
[1:05:54] Holy Spirit to vindicate amen the
[1:05:56] presence of the Lord Jesus Christ in all
[1:05:59] of his power and his omnipotence amen
[1:06:02] well don't get mad at me tonight but for
[1:06:03] six Services amen there's been radio
[1:06:06] waves coming through this building and
[1:06:08] ain't nobody picked them up there's been
[1:06:10] television waves coming through this
[1:06:12] room and ain't nobody picked them up
[1:06:14] amen but there's been prophetic word and
[1:06:16] there's been healing there's been
[1:06:17] Deliverance there's been Miracles
[1:06:19] there's been anointing and it's been
[1:06:21] flowing through this room amen and
[1:06:23] people have been picking it up do you
[1:06:25] know why they're picking it up it's
[1:06:27] because their heart is not tuned to
[1:06:29] what's happening down here what's
[1:06:31] happening over there what's happening
[1:06:33] back there their heart is tuned to one
[1:06:35] thing and that is Jesus Christ is the
[1:06:37] Son of God he is raised from the dead he
[1:06:40] is the god of his word he is the god of
[1:06:43] his spirit and he's here in power
[1:06:45] tonight listen you're not an instrument
[1:06:47] to pick up complexes you were not sent
[1:06:49] here to pick up depression you were not
[1:06:51] sent here to pick up cancer you were not
[1:06:54] not sent here to pick up sickness you
[1:06:55] were sent here in this Dimension to
[1:06:58] declare that Dimension is just as real
[1:07:00] as this
[1:07:03] Dimension now you know the Father's
[1:07:05] prayer in the model prayer he said
[1:07:07] father let thy kingdom come and let thy
[1:07:09] will be done on the Earth as it is in
[1:07:13] heaven in other words there's people on
[1:07:15] the Earth that's already manifesting the
[1:07:18] power of Heaven because they're in tune
[1:07:21] with the god of Heaven he has risen from
[1:07:23] the dead he lives among us today and he
[1:07:26] wants Fellowship back with his people
[1:07:28] again his great Majesty his glory is now
[1:07:31] spreading forth and he's Desiring to
[1:07:33] Fellowship again with his people like he
[1:07:36] did in the Garden of Eden so the fall in
[1:07:39] the garden actually came in and it
[1:07:41] caused man to get out of tune with God
[1:07:44] it caused man to break harmony with God
[1:07:46] Amen and when Harmony is broken amen
[1:07:49] there going to be repercussions brother
[1:07:51] said my mother-in-law come to me when I
[1:07:52] was going among the p costals and she
[1:07:54] said you're not taking my daughter down
[1:07:56] there among that trash he said well
[1:07:58] she's my wife he said she said he's my
[1:08:01] daughter he said now listen she looked
[1:08:03] at me and said I'll go to my grave
[1:08:05] heartbroken now watch what brother said
[1:08:07] he said and instead of listening to God
[1:08:10] Amen I listened to the woman he said and
[1:08:12] then sorrow said in immediately he said
[1:08:15] the 1937 flood come up Sorrows begin to
[1:08:18] break in things went wrong at the church
[1:08:20] he said the congregation begin to drop
[1:08:22] he said just get out of harmony with God
[1:08:25] one time he said in friends I'll always
[1:08:27] regret it as long as I live now you say
[1:08:30] brother Andrew he was a prophet so
[1:08:32] surely amen he could get out of harmony
[1:08:34] with God and God wouldn't correct him
[1:08:36] because he was a prophet God wouldn't
[1:08:38] God wouldn't bring him back in line amen
[1:08:40] but do you remember the Bible says that
[1:08:42] God is no respect to persons amen and
[1:08:45] that word respect to persons means the
[1:08:47] fault of one who when called on to give
[1:08:49] judgment has respect of the outward
[1:08:52] circumstances of man and not of the
[1:08:54] inner marit so watch amen the Propet of
[1:08:57] God brings it on down and shows us here
[1:08:58] I'm laying a foundation brings it on
[1:09:00] down and shows us that God is not a
[1:09:03] respect of persons for anybody he said
[1:09:05] he's not even one for America he said
[1:09:08] America was founded amen upon biblical
[1:09:10] principles now I know it's hard to
[1:09:12] believe amen but at one time America was
[1:09:15] in harmony with God at one time America
[1:09:18] was in tune with God so much that when
[1:09:20] they signed the Declaration of
[1:09:22] Independence the prophet said that there
[1:09:24] was an extra chair sitting there he said
[1:09:26] and I believe that the Son of God came
[1:09:29] down amen and set in that chair while
[1:09:31] they signed the Declaration of
[1:09:32] Independence he said see but this nation
[1:09:34] has gone so far he said somebody told me
[1:09:37] today he said brother Brandon you mean
[1:09:38] to tell me that God would let America be
[1:09:40] overrun I said God never did say to
[1:09:43] America what he did to the Jews down
[1:09:44] there the Israelites but when they got
[1:09:46] out of harmony with God Amen God let
[1:09:49] them go that's right he said I tell you
[1:09:51] brother amen what you sow is is what you
[1:09:54] reap amen now can I preach that point
[1:09:56] for a second because we always
[1:09:58] automatically apply that to the negative
[1:10:00] that if you're so bad you're going to
[1:10:01] reap bad if you're so bad you're going
[1:10:03] to reap bad amen but why have we got to
[1:10:05] leave it in the negative amen why can't
[1:10:08] we bring it over into the positive amen
[1:10:10] if a person can s negative and they can
[1:10:12] reap negative amen I believe a person
[1:10:15] can s positive amen and they can reap
[1:10:17] positive amen you may not see it right
[1:10:19] now amen but these meetings you've been
[1:10:22] sewing amen you've been sewing in the
[1:10:24] kingdom of God you've been sewing in the
[1:10:26] atmosphere you come on church amen your
[1:10:28] pastors have been sewing in the churches
[1:10:30] your singers have been sewing in the
[1:10:32] churches listen meetings like this don't
[1:10:34] just happen overnight amen meetings like
[1:10:37] this don't just happen because some
[1:10:39] special preacher sewed up amen but
[1:10:41] there's been men of God sewing in local
[1:10:43] churches and when the Believers come
[1:10:45] together and the anointing begins to
[1:10:47] settle amen you begin to reap the
[1:10:50] benefits of all those Wednesday nights
[1:10:52] and all those Sunday mornings well I
[1:10:54] might as well preach since I'm here if
[1:10:56] we've been doing that in this Dimension
[1:10:58] amen then what about all that we've been
[1:11:00] sewing on the other side one of these
[1:11:02] mornings we're going to reap a new body
[1:11:04] one of these days we're going to reap a
[1:11:06] resurrection one of these days we're
[1:11:07] going to reap the future home what you
[1:11:09] sow in the negative you will reap in the
[1:11:12] negative and what you sow in the
[1:11:14] positive you will reap in the positive
[1:11:16] and this is a positive
[1:11:18] message yes sir it's a positive message
[1:11:22] amen that God by the New Birth and the
[1:11:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost has made a way
[1:11:27] for harmony to be restored brother said
[1:11:30] the new birth is an experience right he
[1:11:32] said it's a gift of God it's the Seal of
[1:11:35] your faith how many knows Paul said
[1:11:37] grieve not the holy spirit of God Amen
[1:11:39] whereby ye are sealed until the day of
[1:11:42] your Redemption he said God made the
[1:11:44] promise to Abraham and Abraham believed
[1:11:46] God and was justified by faith and God
[1:11:49] give him the sign of circumcision as a
[1:11:52] seal so he does today we believe him and
[1:11:57] then if you say you believe and do not
[1:11:59] receive the Holy Spirit then you do not
[1:12:02] believe because God promised Amen to
[1:12:04] give you the Holy Spirit when you did
[1:12:06] believe see now in believing you do not
[1:12:09] receive the Holy Spirit when you believe
[1:12:10] for Paul said have you received the Holy
[1:12:13] Spirit since you believed he said and
[1:12:15] when the spirit of God comes into a man
[1:12:18] it quickens him and then he becomes a
[1:12:20] new creature he believes in the immortal
[1:12:23] God he believes in all things that he
[1:12:25] does and his heart is in tune with God
[1:12:30] Amen now can I say this to you I know
[1:12:31] we've been having some powerful Services
[1:12:33] some mighty manifestations of God and I
[1:12:36] say this the devil's not happy the
[1:12:38] devil's not happy and the devil does not
[1:12:41] well some of you all come in these
[1:12:42] meetings and your heart was out of tune
[1:12:45] your spirit Was Out Of Tune your family
[1:12:47] and all kinds of situations amen but God
[1:12:50] by the word through the spirit amen has
[1:12:52] tuned your heart back up to God Amen can
[1:12:55] I say this no matter what happens amen
[1:12:57] stay in tune with the supernatural no
[1:13:00] matter what tomorrow holds no matter
[1:13:02] what next week holds no matter what the
[1:13:04] future holds you stay in tune with the
[1:13:07] god of your salvation you stay in tune
[1:13:09] with a God Amen that can make a way out
[1:13:12] of no way you stay in tune with a God
[1:13:14] that can deliver from the fiery
[1:13:17] furnace he said no matter what you got
[1:13:19] here in this world what you haven't got
[1:13:21] keep your heart amen right in tune with
[1:13:23] God he said now if that's right with God
[1:13:25] or heart he said then you'll come forth
[1:13:27] again just as certain as there's a God
[1:13:29] in heaven if it's not right with God you
[1:13:32] got to take the other route see you got
[1:13:34] to make a choice now you may say brother
[1:13:36] Andrew my heart being in tune with God
[1:13:38] it's really not that important well let
[1:13:40] me say what brother Bron said he was
[1:13:42] asked a question brother brandom why
[1:13:43] would Christ appear to me as I was about
[1:13:46] to take the sacraments so here's
[1:13:48] somebody coming to the communion table
[1:13:50] and all of a sudden brother Josh Christ
[1:13:52] just appears to him him and they're
[1:13:54] they're they're they're they're caught
[1:13:55] off guard so to speak and they say why
[1:13:57] would this happen and brother said no
[1:13:59] doubt your heart was just in tune with
[1:14:01] God Amen as you was walking to the
[1:14:04] communion table your heart was in tune
[1:14:07] with God and you was coming sacredly up
[1:14:09] to God to do it he said and that's why
[1:14:11] he appeared to you I tell you friends I
[1:14:14] want my heart to stay in tune with God I
[1:14:17] want my spirit to stay in harmony with
[1:14:19] God I don't want to show up on a
[1:14:21] Wednesday night and him not appear to me
[1:14:23] I don't want to show up on a Sunday
[1:14:25] morning and him not appear to me I said
[1:14:27] God if you could put me in tune in a
[1:14:29] Revival you can keep me in tune on
[1:14:31] Monday you can keep me in Harmony on
[1:14:33] Wednesday don't ever let my heart Get
[1:14:35] Out Of Tune and out of harmony with you
[1:14:38] now this word harmony is a very powerful
[1:14:40] word harmony means the combination amen
[1:14:43] of simultaneously sounded musical notes
[1:14:46] Amen to produce cords amen and cord
[1:14:49] progressions having amen a pleasing
[1:14:52] effect then so listen you can have the
[1:14:54] chords you can have the notes you can
[1:14:57] have the sheet music but unless you've
[1:14:59] got Harmony it's not going to have a
[1:15:01] pleasing effect it's the quality of
[1:15:04] forming a pleasing and a consistent hole
[1:15:07] amen Harmony is very important in
[1:15:09] musical Productions amen because the
[1:15:12] purpose of music is to display Harmony
[1:15:15] the purpose of music is to display the
[1:15:18] ability of Harmony now in St John 5 with
[1:15:21] that in mind we see that Jesus goes by
[1:15:23] the pool of bethesa he passed many
[1:15:26] people brother Brian but he went to one
[1:15:28] man who was an impotent man who had been
[1:15:31] in that condition for a long time and
[1:15:33] the Bible said that Jesus healed him on
[1:15:35] the Sabbath day and the Jews rose up a
[1:15:38] fuss right they said why are you healing
[1:15:40] on the Sabbath day and Jesus looked at
[1:15:42] him and said my father worketh hitherto
[1:15:44] and I work amen therefore the Jews
[1:15:47] sought the more to kill him because he
[1:15:49] not only had broken the Sabbath but said
[1:15:51] that God also was his father amen making
[1:15:54] him equal with God now do you all know
[1:15:57] that there's only there's one type of
[1:15:59] Harmony that they call the best kind of
[1:16:01] Harmony you know what kind of Harmony
[1:16:03] that is they call it family Harmony amen
[1:16:06] and they break it on down into harmony
[1:16:08] between a parent and a child oh are you
[1:16:11] hearing me they break it on down between
[1:16:13] a parent and a child and that's a that's
[1:16:15] a special kind of Harmony that's the
[1:16:17] best kind of Harmony and here Jesus is
[1:16:20] doing things but he's not doing it C he
[1:16:22] wants to or on the whim or because he
[1:16:24] feels like doing it but he's doing it
[1:16:26] because he's in harmony or in tune with
[1:16:29] another dimension and that Dimension is
[1:16:31] where his father is and so his father is
[1:16:34] in that Dimension and then he is in this
[1:16:36] Dimension but they're so in tune that
[1:16:39] what the father wants done the son is
[1:16:41] picking it up and the actions of the son
[1:16:44] is manifesting the desires of the father
[1:16:47] listen church this is not just a
[1:16:49] Pentecostal age this is an adoption age
[1:16:52] where the authority of the father will
[1:16:54] be manifested in the actions of the
[1:16:56] [Applause]
[1:16:57] son we're not just in tune with CNN
[1:17:01] we're not just in tune with Fox News
[1:17:03] we're not just in tune with Israel news
[1:17:05] we are in tune with another dimension
[1:17:08] amen and that Dimension is a perfect
[1:17:10] Dimension that Dimension is a clear
[1:17:12] Dimension that Dimension is an anointed
[1:17:14] Dimension that's why we're not bound by
[1:17:17] the things of this Earth that's why
[1:17:19] we're not looking at wars and rumors of
[1:17:21] wars we are looking to the
[1:17:24] unseen Jesus said un them verily I say
[1:17:27] unto you the son can do nothing of
[1:17:29] himself but what he sees the father do
[1:17:31] for what things soever he doeth these
[1:17:34] also doeth the son likewise so brother
[1:17:37] brother will they were so in harmony
[1:17:39] that what the father showed Jesus to do
[1:17:42] he went and done it brother said when he
[1:17:43] passed by the pool he seen all the
[1:17:45] people and he healed a man and the Jews
[1:17:48] questioned him why he said I do nothing
[1:17:50] but what the father shows me I can't do
[1:17:52] nothing but whatever he does he shows me
[1:17:56] and then I go do it remember said and we
[1:17:58] notice him that he was a kind man how
[1:18:00] many believe Jesus was a kind man he was
[1:18:02] a humble man yet he was a man of power
[1:18:06] I'm going somewhere he was a kind man
[1:18:08] brother M he was a humble man but yet he
[1:18:10] was a man of power when he spoke he was
[1:18:13] very humble and gentle but when it come
[1:18:15] time between to separate between the
[1:18:17] truth and the error amen Jesus was very
[1:18:20] Stern when it came to truth and error he
[1:18:23] didn't put gloves on and become a
[1:18:25] politician and say well I don't want to
[1:18:26] mess with this I don't want to speak it
[1:18:28] that amen he was very Stern when it come
[1:18:31] to truth and error remember said see
[1:18:33] when it come time he picked up some
[1:18:34] ropes and tied them together and kicked
[1:18:36] all the money changers table beat them
[1:18:38] out of the temple called the Pharisees
[1:18:40] those religious people a bunch of
[1:18:42] Hypocrites a bunch of serpents a bunch
[1:18:44] of Snakes in the Grass and all these
[1:18:46] things see he was a man who could speak
[1:18:49] when it come time to speak he was a man
[1:18:51] who was full of love but he loved his
[1:18:54] father so much until he stayed in
[1:18:56] harmony with his father and anything I'm
[1:18:59] preaching to you now anything that
[1:19:01] interfere with that Harmony amen Jesus
[1:19:04] draw the line come on Church anything
[1:19:07] that begin to interfere between the
[1:19:10] harmony of him and his father is where
[1:19:12] he drew the line he loved the Pharisees
[1:19:15] but when their false Doctrine begin to
[1:19:17] interfere with that Harmony between him
[1:19:19] and his father he drew the line he loved
[1:19:22] the SAG se but when their traditions and
[1:19:24] the rituals begin to interfere with the
[1:19:27] harmony between him and his father he
[1:19:29] drew the line well may I say there is
[1:19:31] again another Bride on the earth tonight
[1:19:34] who when anything begins to interfere
[1:19:36] with her Harmony between her Lord and
[1:19:39] her heart she will draw the line and say
[1:19:42] Satan you've gone as far as you've going
[1:19:44] to go you know what I feel like
[1:19:46] preaching right now I think this was a
[1:19:48] line drawing
[1:19:50] meeting I think this was a line draw and
[1:19:53] meeting I think some people drew a line
[1:19:55] and said Satan you've gone as far as
[1:19:58] you're going to go you've interfered
[1:20:00] long enough you've deceived long enough
[1:20:02] you've confused long enough Satan hears
[1:20:05] the
[1:20:06] line anything somebody say anything that
[1:20:09] interfere with that Harmony there is
[1:20:12] where Jesus draw the line brother Mark
[1:20:14] you agree that brother randam had the
[1:20:16] same Ministry of Jesus Christ and watch
[1:20:18] what he said the only thing I'm here for
[1:20:21] is to follow the in instructions of my
[1:20:23] brothers as long as it don't interfere
[1:20:26] with the things that God has for me to
[1:20:29] do now think about that the same
[1:20:32] Ministry that was in John 5 had now come
[1:20:35] into brother brandham the seventh angel
[1:20:38] and he was still exhibiting that same
[1:20:41] Harmony between that Dimension and this
[1:20:44] Dimension now look at the word interfere
[1:20:46] it means to take part or to intervene in
[1:20:49] an activity without invitation or
[1:20:51] necessity it means to come into
[1:20:54] something when you wasn't invited to
[1:20:56] come into it I could preach there for a
[1:20:58] while amen there's a lot of trespassers

[1:21:41] ain't no Strife there ain't no
[1:21:42] contention there ain't no division going
[1:21:44] to interfere between the harmony between
[1:21:47] me and my
[1:21:50] father things come in and they were un
[1:21:52] invited so it's time to show them the
[1:21:54] door it means to prevent a process or an
[1:21:57] activity from continuing or being
[1:21:59] carried out properly it is of a thing
[1:22:02] Amen to strike against something when
[1:22:04] working Amen to get in the way of now

[1:22:39] that Satan right quickly amen goes to
[1:22:41] work against God's program he said we
[1:22:43] see that malignant eye of the devil that
[1:22:46] serpent that always tried to interfere
[1:22:48] with God's program before it comes on
[1:22:51] the earth amen Satan is trying to
[1:22:53] interfere with the program of God before
[1:22:57] it comes on the earth he said because he
[1:22:59] always knows when it's coming mostly now
[1:23:01] do you know that the devil got on daan
[1:23:03] and cor brother Malachi the devil got on
[1:23:06] them to interfere with the program of
[1:23:08] God in delivering his seed by a vision
[1:23:11] given to Abraham and the devil tried to
[1:23:14] interfere with their Deliverance but can
[1:23:16] I say this it didn't work the devil got

[1:23:21] liberation and tried to impersonate the
[1:23:24] sign of Moses Amen to interfere with the
[1:23:26] Deliverance of the seed of God Amen but
[1:23:28] it didn't work amen and that same old
[1:23:31] devil has come right around the ranks of
[1:23:33] this message Amen in the time of the
[1:23:35] Third Exodus in the season of body
[1:23:37] change in the season of rapture and he's
[1:23:40] trying to interfere with your rapture

[1:23:44] trying to stop your future but I want to
[1:23:46] put that devil on notice tonight he

[1:23:58] be a resurrection there is going to be a
[1:24:00] millennium there is going to be a future
[1:24:02] home and devil you can do everything you
[1:24:04] want to but you will never stop amen the
[1:24:07] program of God from coming to pass we
[1:24:10] are in harmony with God we are in tune
[1:24:13] with God and there is a declaration From
[1:24:16] Another Dimension that that Dimension
[1:24:18] just real as this Dimension and our
[1:24:20] hearts are saying we came from God and
[1:24:22] we're going back to
[1:24:24] God we didn't come from Lea Sister Janet
[1:24:27] we ain't going back we didn't come from
[1:24:29] the son of predition so we ain't going
[1:24:32] back we came from the son of man so we
[1:24:34] got to go back we came from eternity so
[1:24:37] we got to go
[1:24:39] back now now you know that devil
[1:24:42] interfered with Moses can I say this
[1:24:44] brother B said like this very beautiful
[1:24:46] he's preaching in the message earnestly
[1:24:48] contended for the faith actually in
[1:24:49] carsville Indiana he's just preaching
[1:24:51] along you know
[1:24:52] just having a good service and the Devil
[1:24:55] comes in and interferes he's just
[1:24:57] preaching along he says then you say oh
[1:24:59] no I don't believe in Divine Healing I
[1:25:00] don't believe in all that racking
[1:25:02] carrying on believe in all that shouting
[1:25:03] praising God and crying tears running
[1:25:05] down your cheeks I don't believe in all
[1:25:07] that I know there's no such thing as
[1:25:09] that see it shows you haven't got it
[1:25:11] that's exactly right here was a man
[1:25:13] right up there balum was just as
[1:25:14] fundamental and just as right as just
[1:25:16] Doctrine as Moses was but Moses had
[1:25:19] healing he had the signs he had a big
[1:25:21] Pillar of Fire amen hanging over him are
[1:25:23] you are you catching the picture brother
[1:25:25] BR is just preaching away brother sea is
[1:25:27] just having a good service and he says
[1:25:29] hallelujah I hope you get it the pillar
[1:25:31] of fire hanging over here right now and
[1:25:33] he comes down and he says now look then
[1:25:35] he said let me die that death of the
[1:25:36] righteous then if you go to your table
[1:25:39] in the bracket you'll see these words
[1:25:41] brother randam stops as a model airplane
[1:25:44] noise interferes you can read it right
[1:25:46] there in the message brother Bram stops
[1:25:48] as a model airplane noise interferes
[1:25:51] then brother BR says hey see how the
[1:25:53] devil will do now if you want to see the
[1:25:55] devil look out there he got in them men
[1:25:58] out there to get them to do such things
[1:26:00] as that now if someone said do you mean
[1:26:02] that was the devil what other thing
[1:26:05] would interfere with God's spirit but
[1:26:07] the devil so here is a prophet oh I feel
[1:26:10] good right now here is a prophet
[1:26:12] preaching and a model airplane amen
[1:26:15] interferes with noise in his preaching
[1:26:18] in other words here is the astronaut age
[1:26:21] Prophet amen standing behind the pullit
[1:26:23] trying to tell the people you're not
[1:26:26] chickens you're not airplane pilots
[1:26:28] you're astronaut people and an airplane
[1:26:30] noise interrupts his preaching but he
[1:26:33] didn't lay down and say well I guess
[1:26:35] we're airplane pilots he said no amen
[1:26:37] the devil will try to stop the meeting
[1:26:39] but you cannot stop God I said you
[1:26:42] cannot stop God God will move right on
[1:26:44] just the same there's nothing simply
[1:26:46] nothing can stop God or the power of God
[1:26:49] he said the same people amen tried to
[1:26:51] stop it but they failed are you hearing
[1:26:54] me in other words nothing can interfere
[1:26:56] with this message I'm preaching to you
[1:26:58] now nothing can interfere with your body
[1:27:00] change nothing can interfere with a
[1:27:03] predestinated seed that's on the inside
[1:27:05] of your heart Jesus said the things I do
[1:27:07] shall you do also how could he say that
[1:27:10] because there was a Harmony between the
[1:27:12] father and the son this is God's sworn
[1:27:15] Covenant and it's true R said then Jesus
[1:27:17] is here how many will agree Jesus is
[1:27:19] here his spirit is here then what just
[1:27:22] happened now amen now can I show you
[1:27:24] something here's a prophet trying to
[1:27:26] preach and the devil interfere and try
[1:27:28] to break between the fault and interrupt
[1:27:31] the meeting amen but here's a prophet
[1:27:33] who said now what just happened I went
[1:27:35] into another world it's an Unseen World
[1:27:38] see we become so conscious of looking at
[1:27:40] one another like this but there's an
[1:27:42] Unseen World and it's greater than
[1:27:44] anything you can see and here's Christ
[1:27:47] in this world in this building here are
[1:27:49] evil spirits and War and Christians is
[1:27:52] Anointed and the angels of God encamped
[1:27:54] about them trying to energize them with
[1:27:56] faith and here I am standing just
[1:27:58] yielding myself and the holy spirit's
[1:28:00] moving this is what you call Heavenly
[1:28:03] places church but remember Satan's
[1:28:05] always a skeptic at the sons of God I'm
[1:28:08] bringing on down home now he wasn't just
[1:28:10] trying to interfere with Jesus and his
[1:28:12] father he wasn't just trying to
[1:28:14] interfere with brother brandham and his
[1:28:15] father but he's a skeptic of the
[1:28:18] manifested adopted sons of God and the
[1:28:20] prophet said someone with a skeptic idea
[1:28:23] is just trying to interfere but
[1:28:25] Christians always overcome don't you
[1:28:28] ever forget that church that Christians
[1:28:31] always overcome there's never one time
[1:28:34] that Christ does not overcome there's
[1:28:36] never one situation that Christ does not
[1:28:39] overcome in Christians always
[1:28:43] overcome when God wants to display his
[1:28:45] power nothing will interfere with that
[1:28:48] now can I say the reason why the devil's
[1:28:50] fighting you the reason why the devil's
[1:28:52] TI in your life is because the same
[1:28:54] Harmony that was between the father and
[1:28:56] the son has now come into existence
[1:28:59] between the groom and the bride this
[1:29:01] harmony is now to exist see the bride
[1:29:04] has the mind of Christ for she knows
[1:29:06] what he wants to done with his word and
[1:29:08] she oh God she performs the command of
[1:29:12] the word in his name right for she has
[1:29:16] thus sayeth the Lord then the word is
[1:29:18] quickened by the spirit and it comes to
[1:29:21] pass like a seed that is planted and
[1:29:23] watered amen and it comes to full
[1:29:26] Harvest amen serving its purpose amen
[1:29:29] can you say that with me serving its
[1:29:31] purpose you are a seed of God in this
[1:29:34] dimension in tune with that Dimension
[1:29:37] with a mind that has thus sayith the
[1:29:39] Lord and you are serving your purpose
[1:29:41] you say brother anderw I'm a young
[1:29:43] person I don't have a purpose well let
[1:29:44] me say this brother M said you had two
[1:29:47] every believer here has two purposes the
[1:29:49] first purpose is he is a fruit Bearer
[1:29:52] the second purpose is you are a
[1:29:55] lightbearer and brother Bram said we are
[1:29:57] God's fruit bearers he said now the vine
[1:30:00] puts forth the fruit but the branches
[1:30:02] amen has to Bear the fruit if the branch
[1:30:05] is getting its life out of the vine well
[1:30:07] it's the same kind of life that's in the
[1:30:09] vine don't you think so it has to be now
[1:30:12] our hands our lips our eyes them's God's
[1:30:14] hands lips and eyes we have here he has
[1:30:17] on earth now he's gone back to God and
[1:30:21] sends forth his energy of his Spirit to
[1:30:23] anoint us with the Holy Spirit and then
[1:30:25] if we are submissive to him then our
[1:30:29] hands represent his hands he has gone
[1:30:32] back in that Dimension but he's not here
[1:30:34] without a representative if he is in us
[1:30:37] then our hands represent his hands if we
[1:30:40] are submissive to him that's the reason
[1:30:42] he said they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:30:45] and they shall recover don't you let
[1:30:47] some devil just isolate back to just a
[1:30:50] preacher or just a prayer line or just
[1:30:52] an altar call amen but if God is in your
[1:30:55] heart and the Holy Ghost is in your soul
[1:30:58] and the Seal of promises upon your life
[1:31:01] your hands is his hands and there's an
[1:31:03] energy flowing through your hands
[1:31:05] there's an anointing flowing through
[1:31:07] your hands you can cast out you can cast
[1:31:10] out Devils you can lay hands on your
[1:31:12] sick
[1:31:14] babies I'm just going to say it I
[1:31:16] believe there's going to be some fifth
[1:31:17] gospels that's going to have some fruit
[1:31:19] on the other side I don't believe it's
[1:31:21] just going to be preachers I believe
[1:31:23] there's going to be some Holy Ghost
[1:31:24] filled mamas that's going to have some
[1:31:26] fruit on the other side that's going to
[1:31:28] be able to stand there and say I was
[1:31:30] sick in my body one day but my mama laid
[1:31:32] her hand on me and rebuked the fever
[1:31:35] rebuked the illness and I was healed are
[1:31:37] you hearing me I'm not talking about a
[1:31:39] generation coming I'm talking about you
[1:31:42] I'm talking about you are taking the
[1:31:44] place of Jesus Christ on the Earth right
[1:31:47] now then the same Harmony in him it's
[1:31:50] the same Harmony in you and the devil
[1:31:52] can't stop it and sin can't defile it
[1:31:55] and demons cannot scare you out of it
[1:31:57] you are a Christian and Christians
[1:32:00] always
[1:32:02] overcome brother R said the church is
[1:32:04] the fruit Bears today somebody say today
[1:32:07] the church is the fruit bearers today
[1:32:10] not tomorrow today brother B said watch
[1:32:13] as sure as Adam and Eve had to be put in
[1:32:15] the same Spirit Christ and the church
[1:32:17] has to be in the same Spirit the same
[1:32:19] Ministry these things I do shall you do
[1:32:21] also so do you see what I mean they had
[1:32:24] to unite together flesh and blood and
[1:32:27] God had to come together and be one
[1:32:30] spirit and Jesus Christ and his church
[1:32:33] is one Spirit my Jesus Christ and his
[1:32:37] church is one Spirit how can the church
[1:32:40] deny creation how can they deny the
[1:32:42] things Christ told them to do how can
[1:32:44] they deny then say we are of Christ we
[1:32:47] are his fruit bearers ye are his
[1:32:50] lightbearers is this okay okay Jesus
[1:32:52] said ye are the light of the world you
[1:32:54] agree with that you are a city that is
[1:32:57] set on a hill and it cannot be hid
[1:33:00] neither do men light a candle put it
[1:33:02] under a bushel but on a Candlestick and
[1:33:04] it giveth life unto all that are in the
[1:33:06] house let your light so shine before men
[1:33:09] that they may see your good works and
[1:33:12] glorify your father in Heaven are you
[1:33:15] hearing me you're in this Dimension but
[1:33:17] they're seeing your good works and
[1:33:19] they're glorifying your father in Heaven
[1:33:22] because there is a Harmony between the
[1:33:24] two
[1:33:27] Dimensions I wish I had the ability to
[1:33:29] break this down there's a connection
[1:33:31] between the two bit Dimensions he is in
[1:33:33] the Unseen we're in the seen and there
[1:33:36] is a fellowship through the blood and
[1:33:38] what he desires to be done in Leona he's
[1:33:41] doing regardless of the fact that
[1:33:43] Lucifer has become the god of this evil
[1:33:46] age brother we think Fe to be the
[1:33:48] lightbearers of this age to be ready to
[1:33:50] manifest how many can say I'm ready I'm
[1:33:53] ready to manifest the promised word for
[1:33:56] the age that we're now living in knowing
[1:33:58] that in the beginning you allotted out
[1:34:00] your word knowing that in from the
[1:34:02] beginning each age you allotted your
[1:34:04] word to that age and somehow we don't
[1:34:07] know how it ever happened but in each
[1:34:09] one of those ages as we look back upon
[1:34:11] the word we see that there was an
[1:34:13] anointing I'm turning the corner now
[1:34:15] there was an anointing that come in that
[1:34:16] age that fulfilled that word there was
[1:34:20] an anointing that in that age that
[1:34:22] fulfilled that word and in this day we
[1:34:25] are now living in there is an allotted
[1:34:27] word there is a promise for this age and
[1:34:30] we believe that the holy spirit is here
[1:34:33] on Earth now trying to find Hearts to
[1:34:36] manifest and to bring to pass by
[1:34:38] vindicating the word that's now
[1:34:40] prophesied for this day and this hour
[1:34:43] amen can I shake you out of your sleep
[1:34:44] tonight can I preach to you for a second
[1:34:47] amen get out of your feelings get out of
[1:34:49] your ideas get out of your complex get
[1:34:52] out of your excuses get out of where I
[1:34:54] come out of this family and I come out
[1:34:55] of this situation the angel of God is in
[1:34:58] the Earth today who is hunting out
[1:35:00] Honest Hearts who will believe this
[1:35:03] message and he sent an anointing in this
[1:35:05] generation to fall into your life and to
[1:35:08] cause you to manifest the promise of the
[1:35:10] age you're living in come on church we
[1:35:12] ain't building an ark because that's not
[1:35:15] the promise of this age we're not
[1:35:16] putting literal Blood on the door
[1:35:18] because that's not the promise of this
[1:35:20] age but we're feeding on the unfailing
[1:35:23] body word of the son of man we're laid
[1:35:26] in the presence of the son and all the
[1:35:28] greenness is being Bak town because the
[1:35:30] promise of this age is a mature bride to
[1:35:34] take a Rapture in the moment in the
[1:35:36] twinkl of an eye may I say it and all
[1:35:39] hell can't stop it all Devils can't stop
[1:35:42] it we will
[1:35:46] overcome the devil can try to stop it
[1:35:48] but the anointing will break his back
[1:35:50] the devil can try to bind it but the
[1:35:52] anointing will break through the devil
[1:35:54] can try to defeat you but the anointing
[1:35:56] will cause you to say greater is he that
[1:35:59] is in me and he that is in the
[1:36:02] [Applause]
[1:36:04] world oh what are you saying belander
[1:36:06] I'm saying there's an anointing in this
[1:36:08] age and it's a word anointing and it's
[1:36:11] the anointing of Isaiah 10 that said the
[1:36:14] Yoke the Yoke shall be destroyed because
[1:36:18] of the anointing and we just have church
[1:36:20] on Saturday afternoon
[1:36:22] we just have church for a few minutes
[1:36:23] can I get a testimony here tonight that
[1:36:26] the oak has been destroyed can I get a
[1:36:29] witness here tonight that the anointing
[1:36:31] of the word has destroyed the
[1:36:33] Yoke you say brother Andrew it broke the
[1:36:36] Yol then there's a problem because
[1:36:38] anything that's broken can be repaired
[1:36:41] and put back on you but if it is
[1:36:43] destroyed it is beyond repair it is
[1:36:46] beyond fixing it is beyond wearing again
[1:36:49] and I want to tell you this anointed
[1:36:51] word word has broke your complexes this
[1:36:53] anointed word has broke your sicknesses
[1:36:56] this anointed word has broken the devil
[1:36:58] over your past and has liberated you to
[1:37:01] marry this new anointed word the
[1:37:04] anointing shall be destroyed because or
[1:37:07] the Yol shall be destroyed because of
[1:37:09] the anointing can I say this the same
[1:37:11] anointing that destroys the yolk the
[1:37:14] same anointing that destroys the yolk is
[1:37:17] the same anointing that moves you as a
[1:37:19] True Believer to fulfill the word of God
[1:37:23] the same anointing brother Josh that
[1:37:25] released you from the hand of the enemy
[1:37:27] is the same anointing that put you in
[1:37:30] position to fulfill the allotted word
[1:37:33] that was prophesied for the age that
[1:37:35] you're living in I want to say this
[1:37:37] tonight we're not just church members
[1:37:39] we're True Believers we're not just
[1:37:41] we're not just we're not just social
[1:37:43] Christians on a happy go-lucky picnic we
[1:37:46] are believers of God who are here to
[1:37:49] manifest the prophesied word now listen
[1:37:51] the pro ask a question you all have
[1:37:53] heard me preach on this point before at
[1:37:55] home but I'm going to say it like this
[1:37:56] real quickly explain the difference
[1:37:58] between the spirit and the Soul well now
[1:37:59] that's a hard one but the first thing
[1:38:01] you are see you're a tringe being just
[1:38:03] like Father Son and Holy Ghost amen and
[1:38:06] father son Holy Ghost is three things
[1:38:08] titles rather going into one person
[1:38:10] which is Jesus Christ and your soul body
[1:38:12] and spirit but it takes them three to
[1:38:15] make you how many degrees it takes them
[1:38:17] three to make you the Messiah 61 he said
[1:38:20] when God in the inner part of a
[1:38:22] man in the inner part of a man a man is
[1:38:26] made up in the system of a Tabernacle in
[1:38:29] the outer courts the holy place and the
[1:38:31] holies of holies the Shak glory on the
[1:38:34] inside the veil now in Romans 66 Paul
[1:38:37] can I give you some scripture real quick
[1:38:39] I'm I'm going to lay a point in here in
[1:38:41] Romans 66 Paul said knowing this that
[1:38:43] our old man is crucified with him that
[1:38:46] the body of sin might be destroyed that
[1:38:49] henceforth we should not serve sin
[1:38:51] Ephesians 2:14 for he is our peace how
[1:38:54] many believes he's our peace who hath
[1:38:56] made both one and ha broken down the
[1:38:58] middle wall of partition between us amen
[1:39:01] so in other words he's brought Harmony
[1:39:03] having abolished in his flesh the enemy
[1:39:06] enmity even the law of Commandments and
[1:39:08] contained in ordinances for to make
[1:39:10] himself of Twain one new man so making
[1:39:12] peace that he might reconcile both unto
[1:39:15] God in one body by the cross having
[1:39:18] slain the enmity thereby in Ephesians
[1:39:21] 3:16 that he would Grant you according
[1:39:23] to the riches of his glory to be
[1:39:25] strengthened with his might by spirit in
[1:39:28] the Inner Man in Ephesians 4:22 that you
[1:39:31] would put off concerning the former
[1:39:32] conversation the old man which is
[1:39:34] corrupt according to the deceitful lust
[1:39:37] and be renewed in the spirit of your
[1:39:39] mind that she put on the new man which
[1:39:42] is after God is created in righteousness
[1:39:46] and true Holiness in 2 Corinthians 4:16
[1:39:49] for which cause we thinkt not but though
[1:39:52] our outward man perish but the inward
[1:39:55] man is renewed day by day in Colossians
[1:39:58] 39 lie not one to another seeing that
[1:40:01] you put off the old man with his deeds
[1:40:04] and have put on the new man which is
[1:40:07] renewed in knowledge after the image of
[1:40:09] him that created him can I say this the
[1:40:12] anointing is not striking the outer man
[1:40:15] it's not just striking your flesh but
[1:40:18] the anointing is striking the Inside Man
[1:40:21] and the prophet said the Inside Man is
[1:40:23] the spirit man he said now the inside
[1:40:25] man he said now there is God he said
[1:40:28] there's a conscience and there's a
[1:40:29] subconscious y'all know that there's God
[1:40:32] the word you got a conscience and then
[1:40:34] you got a subconscious remember said now
[1:40:36] watch if we start overseas by ship and
[1:40:38] there's a man sitting up here and he's
[1:40:40] the one who gives the orders the man
[1:40:42] goes down the ship to run the ship down
[1:40:43] here well he don't see where he's going
[1:40:45] but he just takes orders from up above
[1:40:47] see but way down in the midst of here in
[1:40:49] our hearts is the subconscious and it
[1:40:52] takes orders from up there now up here
[1:40:54] this conscience comes up to the platform
[1:40:56] brother B praise the Lord I have faith
[1:40:58] but right down there in that other
[1:41:00] little conscience said now you know you
[1:41:01] haven't see well if you can get this one
[1:41:04] and that one in harmony with that one
[1:41:05] then something's going to happen see
[1:41:07] until that does it well it just won't
[1:41:09] work amen all the orders you can have
[1:41:12] but it goes this way that way or this
[1:41:14] way they're just pulling your ship one
[1:41:16] way or the other and you'll never get
[1:41:18] out of the harbor until the conscience
[1:41:21] and the subconscious all comes into
[1:41:24] harmony you're going to stay in the
[1:41:26] harbor he said see but watch if they all
[1:41:28] come in agreement amen then something's
[1:41:30] going to move now can I say this if you
[1:41:33] have the Holy Ghost on the inside of
[1:41:35] your soul amen there is a Harmony in you
[1:41:39] that's working that maybe you don't even
[1:41:40] realize is
[1:41:42] working can I say it like this the
[1:41:44] prophet said now in you is God right you
[1:41:46] who have the Holy Ghost God is in you do
[1:41:48] you believe that now Jesus said I give
[1:41:51] you power let me show you the weakness
[1:41:53] of the church today by God's grace I
[1:41:55] give you power over unclean spirits and
[1:41:57] you'll cast them out in my name they
[1:41:59] shall cast out Devils they shall speak
[1:42:01] with new tongues they shall take up
[1:42:03] serpents and if they drink deadly things
[1:42:05] it will not hurt them did you read what
[1:42:09] Jesus said in his last commission as he
[1:42:11] was leaving he said they shall take up
[1:42:13] serpents and it shall not hurt them do
[1:42:15] you realize in Acts 28 I'm preaching
[1:42:17] fast cuz I'm trying to hurry in Acts 28
[1:42:20] now watch this Paul is in a vision do
[1:42:22] you realize that yes he's Shipwrecked
[1:42:25] but he's in a vision and the vision said
[1:42:27] you're going to be Shipwrecked the
[1:42:29] vision said these things are going to
[1:42:30] happen but it also said you're going to
[1:42:32] stand in a certain place and perform a
[1:42:35] certain work and when Paul was
[1:42:37] Shipwrecked he got off amen and the
[1:42:40] Bible said that he was gathering sticks
[1:42:42] and when he was gathering these sticks
[1:42:43] there was a Venom a serpent that come up
[1:42:46] out of the sticks and bit Paul and the
[1:42:49] prophet of God said when he throw some
[1:42:50] wood down a great deadly Beast bit him
[1:42:52] and that Beast was so deadly till if it
[1:42:55] hit a person they usually Dro dead
[1:42:57] within a minute or two so the natives
[1:42:59] looked at him and said oh he's a
[1:43:00] murderer you know he's escape the storm
[1:43:02] but he's not going to escape the serpent
[1:43:03] he's going to die now look a moment Paul
[1:43:05] looked and seen it he seen this this and
[1:43:09] this all agreed and there was not a
[1:43:11] speck of fear and he remembered they
[1:43:13] would take up serpents and it would not
[1:43:16] hurt them he said so Satan's Fear cast
[1:43:19] It Out by perfect love he said and this
[1:43:21] this and this was all in Harmony and he
[1:43:25] looked at the thing and said well he
[1:43:27] just shook it off in the fire and got
[1:43:29] more sticks because he had a job to do
[1:43:32] he said well Paul aren't you afraid
[1:43:33] you're going to fall dead why certainly
[1:43:35] not I can't fall dead the holy spirit is
[1:43:38] in me glory to God I can't fall dead the
[1:43:42] holy spirit is in me so here's Paul
[1:43:45] there's God he give a vision you're
[1:43:47] going to stand before Caesar and the
[1:43:50] devil was trying to interfere between
[1:43:52] the harmony of God and Paul and while he
[1:43:54] was gathering sticks he was bit by a
[1:43:57] serpent but when the serpent bit him
[1:43:59] they was expecting him to die but he
[1:44:01] just shook it off in the fire and the
[1:44:03] prophet said the very holy spirit that
[1:44:05] made the heavens and earth had that man
[1:44:07] so charged with the power till the death
[1:44:10] and that thing of that serpent wouldn't
[1:44:12] even go in his body because his whole
[1:44:15] body was full amen of spirit the same as
[1:44:18] it was blood
[1:44:21] Hallelujah his whole body was full of
[1:44:24] spirit the same as it was full of blood
[1:44:27] in other words we would not even know
[1:44:30] that Paul was bit by the serpent had
[1:44:32] somebody not recorded it because he was
[1:44:35] in such harmony with God can I preach a
[1:44:38] minute he was in such harmony with God
[1:44:41] that when the serpent bit him when the
[1:44:43] serpent Li onone to him I believe it
[1:44:45] like this brother Caleb I don't even
[1:44:47] believe the Venom got in him I don't
[1:44:49] even believe the Venom affect him
[1:44:51] because the power of the Holy Ghost had
[1:44:53] him so in tune with that
[1:44:56] Dimension are you can I say it like this
[1:44:58] in other words Paul what's happening in
[1:45:01] your present cannot affect your
[1:45:04] future brother Mark what's happening in
[1:45:07] your present cannot affect your future
[1:45:10] but wait I'm serpent B but there's a
[1:45:13] Harmony the prophet said they done great
[1:45:15] Miracles why they were so perfectly in
[1:45:17] harmony with God that first church and
[1:45:19] Christian friend until we can get back
[1:45:21] to that we can argue squirrel quirrel
[1:45:24] and fuss with denomination and never get
[1:45:26] into it see it'll never work until all
[1:45:29] that comes into harmony until all that
[1:45:32] comes into harmony until all that comes
[1:45:35] into
[1:45:38] harmony now brother Andrew what are you
[1:45:39] getting at I'll tell you very I'll tell
[1:45:41] you very plainly what the Bible said if
[1:45:43] that's okay the Bible says amen that the
[1:45:46] last days the spirit speaketh expressly
[1:45:48] that in the latter times some shall
[1:45:50] depart from the
[1:45:52] faith that's Bible some are going to
[1:45:55] depart from the faith amen now watch
[1:45:57] this giving heed to seducing spirits and
[1:46:02] doctrines of devils so in other words in
[1:46:04] the last days there's going to be
[1:46:06] seducing Spirits which a seduction is
[1:46:09] connected to a serpent so there's going
[1:46:11] to be seducing Spirits all the way from
[1:46:13] the from evees interpreter that's going
[1:46:15] to come into this age and they're going
[1:46:17] to seduce some and they're going to
[1:46:19] separate some amen but I love what the
[1:46:21] prophet said he said but the time has
[1:46:23] come for the signs to follow the
[1:46:24] Believers we're at the end time we're in
[1:46:27] the latter time we're at the time when
[1:46:29] men will be he high-m minded lovers of
[1:46:30] pleasure more than lovers of God truce
[1:46:32] Breakers false accusers incontinent and
[1:46:35] despisers of those that are good they
[1:46:37] are heady and high minded see the time
[1:46:39] has come when they're teaching doctrines
[1:46:41] of devils and perverting the Bible's
[1:46:44] teaching into theories and theologies to
[1:46:47] draw groups of people away after them
[1:46:51] brother said the time has come that God
[1:46:53] and then the time has come for Jesus to
[1:46:55] come now can I say this the only time
[1:46:58] that's going to happen is at the time of
[1:47:00] the next change come on when seducing
[1:47:03] spirits and doctrines of devils will
[1:47:06] come into the pull pit will come into
[1:47:08] the church is the same time it's time
[1:47:11] for a change in the Sheep
[1:47:14] music are you hearing me is the same
[1:47:17] time that it's time for a change in the
[1:47:19] Sheep music you say sheet music well in
[1:47:22] 19 can I have a few more minutes in 1964
[1:47:25] brother B introduces to us this thought
[1:47:27] in the message Shalom and he calls it a
[1:47:29] great Symphony he said God has a great
[1:47:33] Symphony now you say what is a symphony
[1:47:35] well a symphony is an elaborate musical
[1:47:38] composition and it's a full orchestra
[1:47:40] that typically moves in four movements
[1:47:43] it typically moves in four movements at
[1:47:47] least one of which is traditionally in a
[1:47:49] Sonata form now look at this four it
[1:47:52] moves in four well there were four death
[1:47:55] Messengers that eat the tree down but
[1:47:58] there were be four life Messengers that
[1:48:00] would restore the tree back and the
[1:48:02] prophet of God said you know what the
[1:48:03] symphony is it's a music It's a drama so
[1:48:07] they acted out amen are you with me now
[1:48:09] so if you're going to have a drama if
[1:48:12] you're going to have a symphony you've
[1:48:14] got to have some instruments to act out
[1:48:16] what's trying to be portrayed and the
[1:48:18] prophet said well that little Russian
[1:48:20] Symphony sometimes they act out on the
[1:48:21] drums what is it Peter and the Wolf he
[1:48:23] said you know it's about the little
[1:48:25] woodpecker you know goes down in the
[1:48:26] woods and they had the flutter and the
[1:48:28] beating on the drums and things and you
[1:48:30] hear it all as you go through the
[1:48:31] symphony I forget the name of it he says
[1:48:32] oh that Peter and the Wolf amen now
[1:48:34] watch he said they don't have little
[1:48:36] figures flying around they don't have
[1:48:38] little figures flying around playing
[1:48:40] flying around playing it out but they
[1:48:42] play it on drums and then brother Bram
[1:48:44] knocks on something else and makes the
[1:48:46] drums and sounds and things and it plays
[1:48:50] out it acts it out now watch this if
[1:48:53] you're going to have Harmony in the
[1:48:54] symphony amen you got to have some
[1:48:56] musicians and all the musicians have got
[1:48:59] to be in the same key brother B said
[1:49:01] they just cannot hold that key to the
[1:49:03] mystery how the Rhythm and the sounds of
[1:49:05] the tuning and so forth Rings it out it
[1:49:08] takes the key if you're going to have a
[1:49:11] symphony you got to have some musicians
[1:49:14] who are playing in the right key now
[1:49:16] brother B turns and says the word of God
[1:49:19] is like a great syphony he said now if
[1:49:21] you don't understand the symphony it's a
[1:49:23] big bunch of Racket to you amen if you
[1:49:25] don't understand it see amen now watch
[1:49:27] the key of symphony is the ability to
[1:49:30] understand it's all done by signs and
[1:49:32] motions but it acts out a drama in this
[1:49:35] Symphony now notice the only one that
[1:49:37] understands a symphony is the composer
[1:49:40] the only one that understands the
[1:49:42] symphony is a composer and those who are
[1:49:44] interested in knowing it and they know
[1:49:47] its changes and they know what takes
[1:49:49] place so there's only one person who
[1:49:52] understands amen why people are standing
[1:49:54] up and shouting at the word about a
[1:49:56] seven seal why they're shouting about
[1:49:58] seven Thunders while they're rejoicing
[1:50:00] about a third pole there's only one
[1:50:02] person that knows and that is the
[1:50:04] composer but the other people that know
[1:50:07] are the ones who were elected from
[1:50:09] before the foundation of the world to
[1:50:12] come into the Same Spirit of the
[1:50:14] composer who wrote the
[1:50:16] music and the prophet said so the
[1:50:18] composer he knows every move from the
[1:50:21] end to the beginning did you know that
[1:50:24] the one who wrote it up he composes this
[1:50:26] he knows every little Junction if he
[1:50:29] knows every Junction now watch if the
[1:50:32] composer knows it I'm moving on down if
[1:50:35] the composer knows it he said then so
[1:50:38] does the
[1:50:39] director if the composer brother Tim
[1:50:42] knows it then so does the director in
[1:50:45] order to direct it now you got it you
[1:50:47] can't twist your creedy mat because one
[1:50:49] little m
[1:50:50] of that stick or that sign one little
[1:50:52] Miss sign at adjunction would throw the
[1:50:54] whole Orchestra off it would throw the
[1:50:56] whole Symphony out now you know that's
[1:50:58] true the composer and the director has
[1:51:02] to be in the same Spirit In other words
[1:51:05] the power of Harmony that operated
[1:51:08] between the father and the son oh come
[1:51:10] on church I'm preaching to you now when
[1:51:13] Jesus went by the woman at the well he
[1:51:15] did not guess how many husbands she had
[1:51:17] he knew how many husbands she had when
[1:51:20] he went
[1:51:21] by when he went by by by zachus he did
[1:51:24] not guess about zachus when he went by
[1:51:27] Philip and Andrew he did not guess about
[1:51:29] them because one miscue of the sign from
[1:51:33] the director would throw the whole
[1:51:34] Symphony off are you hear me now that's
[1:51:37] why we got over 8,000 recorded
[1:51:39] discernments and prayer lines and
[1:51:42] prophecies and there's not one of them
[1:51:45] off there's not one of them off there's
[1:51:48] not one time that somebody's stops
[1:51:50] brother brandham and says no that's not
[1:51:52] right but every time every prayer line
[1:51:55] every waving of the stick every
[1:51:57] manifestation of the sign there was a
[1:52:00] that's the truth that's the truth you
[1:52:02] know why because the composure was
[1:52:04] coming In The Same Spirit into the
[1:52:07] director come on you know I'm telling
[1:52:08] you the truth from the composer it moves
[1:52:11] into the director and the prophet said
[1:52:13] that's why the minister and the word of
[1:52:15] God the great Symphony has been playing
[1:52:17] since the dawn of time he said now look
[1:52:19] amen the minister at the word has to not
[1:52:22] look over here and say I believe this
[1:52:24] ought to be this you ought to make it
[1:52:25] this way he has to go the way the shoot
[1:52:29] he has to go the way the sheet music
[1:52:30] says take it that's the way the gospel
[1:52:32] has to be preached the way the word says
[1:52:34] take it you know if you throw a Creed in
[1:52:36] there you got the whole thing messed up
[1:52:38] if you go to make the drama just exactly
[1:52:42] right can I move on he said now there
[1:52:45] will be no trumpet give an uncertain
[1:52:46] sound in this war he said now you see
[1:52:49] the comp supposer God who wrote the
[1:52:51] Bible it's all together the revelation
[1:52:54] of Jesus Christ and he know the changes
[1:52:57] and the times and in the man the
[1:53:00] director who is directing them with the
[1:53:03] sign of the age has got to be exactly
[1:53:06] with the Bible signs in other words
[1:53:08] brother Josh he's got to preach several
[1:53:10] sermons and say the trumpet gives an
[1:53:12] uncertain sound then who can prepare for
[1:53:15] the battle he said it's uncertain to
[1:53:17] everything you look at but there's one
[1:53:19] thing that's certain and that's Christ
[1:53:22] there's one thing that's certain and
[1:53:24] that's the composure there's one thing
[1:53:26] that's certain and that's the one who
[1:53:29] wrote the sheet
[1:53:30] music don't you listen to an uncertain
[1:53:33] sound You Believe Gospel you believe
[1:53:35] God's gospel in its fullness because the
[1:53:38] gospel has no uncertain sound now can I
[1:53:41] show you what brother RAM does he brings
[1:53:43] it from the composer right on down to
[1:53:45] the director and says now look the
[1:53:47] church has an uncertain sound he said
[1:53:49] the the churches and depending on what
[1:53:51] they did in college amen the true church
[1:53:53] but it's the living Holy Spirit in the
[1:53:55] church amen leading it and guiding it
[1:53:58] for showing it things to come like it
[1:53:59] did in the days of Titus amen warning
[1:54:01] them of things to come to flee the Wrath
[1:54:04] that is to
[1:54:05] come can I say this to you the seventh
[1:54:08] Angel's message is not an uncertain
[1:54:11] sound the seventh Angel's message is a
[1:54:15] certain
[1:54:17] sound that's right because coming
[1:54:20] directly from the composer down to the
[1:54:23] director and the prophet said this Seven
[1:54:25] Seals on the book the book will not the
[1:54:26] shelds will not be released until the
[1:54:28] message of the seventh angel so we are
[1:54:31] presuming but the genuine revelation of
[1:54:34] God will be made perfect in that
[1:54:36] sounding Vindicated truth amen now can I
[1:54:39] say what God did by this message by the
[1:54:41] message of the hour amen God I'm coming
[1:54:44] I'm coming down now God has put the
[1:54:46] church back in Rhythm brother Kevin and
[1:54:50] he's tuned them up amen and now they're
[1:54:53] back in Rhythm and they're back in tune
[1:54:55] with the sheet music in other words God
[1:54:58] the conscience and the subconscious all
[1:55:00] come in harmony Jesus was in harmony
[1:55:03] with the father and watch what the
[1:55:04] prophet says he said and today there's a
[1:55:06] symphony when they stand up and say the
[1:55:08] days of Miracles has passed it don't hit
[1:55:10] the right note see but when it gets in
[1:55:12] the right swing of it when it gets in
[1:55:15] the right swing of it amen and it gets
[1:55:17] in the right Spirit of it then how you
[1:55:19] going to do it until the spirit comes
[1:55:21] down of the composer listen friends it's
[1:55:23] been more than a preacher Spirit here
[1:55:25] this weekend amen but the composer
[1:55:27] Spirit has come down in these meetings
[1:55:30] and has moved across the church and some
[1:55:32] of us Was Out Of Tune some of us was
[1:55:34] playing in the wrong Rhythm amen but the
[1:55:36] composer come down and he begin to use a
[1:55:39] director he begin to use a five-fold
[1:55:41] Ministry and he begin to swing that
[1:55:43] stick he begin to say listen the message
[1:55:46] is the truth there's only one way to
[1:55:48] Rapture the holy ghost is still here the
[1:55:51] Supernatural is still available the
[1:55:53] Miracles are still happening and he
[1:55:55] begin to direct the composer begin to
[1:55:57] direct the director well I might as well
[1:55:59] go ahead and close on this if he brought
[1:56:01] it from the composer into the director
[1:56:04] then the same spirit in the director is
[1:56:06] going to come in the
[1:56:09] musicians The Same Spirit that's in the
[1:56:12] director in the composer is going to
[1:56:14] come into the
[1:56:18] musicians
[1:56:22] now I know I know this may sound funny
[1:56:24] but it's actually a true story in middle
[1:56:27] school I was in ban believe it or not I
[1:56:29] was in ban I played the trumpet I I I
[1:56:33] say I played the trumpet I
[1:56:35] tried never played a trumpet in my life
[1:56:37] brother will but I didn't want to play
[1:56:39] sports so I had to do something in
[1:56:41] middle school so I went to band said put
[1:56:44] me on the trumpet I blow the trumpet
[1:56:46] band director says all right you can
[1:56:48] play You Don't Know Much but we'll teach
[1:56:50] you okay I'm in I got the trumpet so I
[1:56:52] went through sixth grade and we played
[1:56:53] sixth grade music but when it comes
[1:56:55] seventh grade in sixth grade you're just
[1:56:57] sixth grade band alone so you have your
[1:56:59] own concerts you have everything just
[1:57:01] isolated sixth grade but when you come
[1:57:02] to seventh and eighth grade then you
[1:57:04] begin to play together so now you're in
[1:57:07] seventh grade but you're playing with
[1:57:09] eight gr eighth graders amen and now in
[1:57:11] our and come time for our Christmas
[1:57:13] concert Christmas concert band Mr Brown
[1:57:15] my band director he comes around brother
[1:57:17] Sean and he hands out a piece of music
[1:57:19] well I took the music I laid it up on
[1:57:21] the on the stand and I looked at it and
[1:57:24] brother Josh when I first looked at it I
[1:57:26] was like whoa that's a lot different
[1:57:28] what I'm used seeing so I had a director
[1:57:31] Mr Brown but then in the afternoons on
[1:57:33] Tuesdays and Thursdays I had an
[1:57:35] instructor so I went to my instructor
[1:57:38] and I go in one day and he says what do
[1:57:39] you want to practice today in your
[1:57:40] lessons I said well might as well
[1:57:42] practice my concert band so we get the
[1:57:44] music out I lay it down on the on the
[1:57:46] stand and he looks at it and he goes no

[1:57:53] music he said no no no you're concert
[1:57:56] band you're seventh grade I said that's
[1:57:58] what he give me that's what the director
[1:57:59] give me he said no he said this is
[1:58:01] written on the 10th grade
[1:58:04] level wow this is written on a 10th
[1:58:08] grade level you're in seventh grade why
[1:58:10] do you have 10th grade music I said it's
[1:58:13] hard but it's what he gave me oh God
[1:58:17] it's hard but it's what he gave me so I
[1:58:19] begin to play it he said now listen
[1:58:20] here's what we'll do we'll fix this so
[1:58:22] he went in there and he began to dumb
[1:58:24] down the music he be to put some
[1:58:27] different some different keys and
[1:58:29] whatever he done he said I'm going to
[1:58:30] make it easier for you to play so I go
[1:58:33] back to Band the next day and we all get
[1:58:35] our music out and we all start playing
[1:58:38] and Mr Brown stops and says something's
[1:58:39] off in here something's off in here and
[1:58:42] I thought oh no and I just sat there you
[1:58:46] know and smiled I wasn't going to say
[1:58:47] nothing he said let's try again so he
[1:58:49] played again he stopped he said
[1:58:51] something's off in here I just sat there
[1:58:53] and smiled he said everybody lay your
[1:58:54] instruments down and don't touch your
[1:58:56] music stands so here he comes walking
[1:58:58] through looking all the music and he
[1:59:00] comes by me and I'm just praying Lord
[1:59:02] don't let him look don't let him look
[1:59:03] don't let him see don't let him see and
[1:59:04] he looks right at it and he says it's
[1:59:06] you I said me he said yeah I said no
[1:59:09] way he said yeah it's you I said me he
[1:59:12] said you're the one that's off I said I
[1:59:15] am wow I knew I was off he said you're
[1:59:18] off I saidwhat do you mean he said' I
[1:59:20] got a question he said who dumbed down
[1:59:23] this
[1:59:25] music who dumbed it down I said what do
[1:59:27] you mean he said who changed what I gave
[1:59:30] you I said well my instructor he said
[1:59:33] your instructor is not the director he
[1:59:35] said your instructor has got you sitting
[1:59:37] in here playing a different key than the
[1:59:40] rest of the band is playing and I'm the
[1:59:42] director he said Andrew the reason I
[1:59:44] gave you that 10th grade music is
[1:59:46] because it's time for you to realize
[1:59:48] that there's potential in you to play
[1:59:50] Above what you've been playing so the
[1:59:52] music was a challenge Amen to play above
[1:59:55] a sixth grade level to play above a
[1:59:57] seventh are y'all hearing me and God
[2:00:01] come down in this age and he passed out
[2:00:03] the sheet music and there's been a lot
[2:00:05] of change into it there's been a lot of
[2:00:07] instructors who's added and taken away
[2:00:09] and hacked and cut and put in and
[2:00:11] changed the tune but in the evening time
[2:00:14] in the evening time it shall be light
[2:00:17] again and there will be somebody who the
[2:00:20] potentials of God will be revealed in
[2:00:23] their life the devil said you can't play
[2:00:25] it so we tried to interfere with it the
[2:00:28] devil said it's too hard for you and he
[2:00:30] tried to interfere with it but the
[2:00:31] director said I see something in you and
[2:00:34] you're able to do
[2:00:38] it in other words in the end time the
[2:00:44] composer and the director and the
[2:00:47] musicians are all in In The Same
[2:00:51] Spirit are you hearing me can I close on
[2:00:55] this point can I close on this point get
[2:00:58] back to the
[2:00:59] director get back to the director get
[2:01:03] back to what he
[2:01:04] said come on now I know what I'm talking
[2:01:06] about get back to what he said I know
[2:01:09] brother Josh said something last night
[2:01:11] and it just come through this room when
[2:01:12] he said it he said listen the message is
[2:01:15] more true now than when it was spoke in
[2:01:17] he said it's more accurate now now and
[2:01:19] it was preached then and I thought to
[2:01:21] myself the devil could get a hold of
[2:01:23] that and the devil could try to twist
[2:01:24] that amen but that's a powerful
[2:01:26] statement because brother Josh said that
[2:01:29] amen preaching to a church full of
[2:01:31] people who was rejoicing at things come
[2:01:33] on friends that they heard back there
[2:01:35] but they did not
[2:01:37] understand come on Billy Paul heard
[2:01:40] future home and he walked out of there
[2:01:42] and brother Bram said Billy did you
[2:01:44] understand it he said sure did Daddy he
[2:01:46] said did you really understand it he
[2:01:47] said no I didn't he said said Billy I
[2:01:49] can count on my hand the people that
[2:01:51] understood that amen but here we are
[2:01:53] years later and there's young people in
[2:01:56] this building tonight who can understand
[2:01:58] things that was confusing back then Here
[2:02:01] We Are Tonight church and there's a
[2:02:03] bride on the earth who is not changing
[2:02:06] the Sheep music they're not dumbing it
[2:02:08] down they are just playing
[2:02:10] it Hall the composer the director and
[2:02:15] the musicians will all be in the same
[2:02:17] Spirit are you ready for this yes here
[2:02:19] the authenticated prophet of God who
[2:02:22] appears in last age what he says from
[2:02:24] God the bride will say the spirit the
[2:02:26] prophet and the bride will be saying the
[2:02:29] same
[2:02:30] thing yes
[2:02:34] sir can I leave you with
[2:02:37] this the purpose of the
[2:02:40] symphony is to bring three parts into
[2:02:45] harmony to transform the sheet music
[2:02:48] into real
[2:02:51] reality so Brother Sam there's not
[2:02:53] woodpeckers flying around there's not a
[2:02:55] wolf flying
[2:02:56] around but there's a composer there's a
[2:03:00] director and there's musicians in the
[2:03:02] same
[2:03:05] spirit and they're playing out the great
[2:03:07] Symphony what are you saying brother
[2:03:09] Andrew I'm saying this our lives are a
[2:03:12] part of this
[2:03:13] Symphony can I read you Isaiah 12:1 the
[2:03:17] Bible said that day Thou shalt say oh
[2:03:18] Lord I will praise thee though thou was
[2:03:20] anger with me thine anger is turned away
[2:03:22] and thou Comfort us me behold God is my
[2:03:26] salvation I will trust and not be afraid
[2:03:29] are you ready for this for the Lord
[2:03:31] Jehovah is my
[2:03:34] strength and my song he has also become
[2:03:38] my salvation therefore with joy shall
[2:03:40] you draw water out of the wells of
[2:03:42] Salvation And in that day shall ye
[2:03:46] say praise the Lord call upon his name
[2:03:50] declare his doings among the people make
[2:03:54] mention that his name is exalted do you
[2:03:56] read verse 5 there and sing unto the
[2:03:59] Lord for he hath done excellent things
[2:04:03] listen this is known in all the Earth
[2:04:05] cry out and Shout thou inhabitant of
[2:04:08] Zion for great is the Holy One of Israel
[2:04:11] in the midst of thee can I tell you what
[2:04:13] that word sing means that word sing
[2:04:15] means to sing praise brother Sean it
[2:04:18] means to make music to play a musical
[2:04:21] instrument so in other words in the last
[2:04:23] days Jehovah oh God is going to come
[2:04:27] down in the church he's going to come
[2:04:29] from the composer into the director and
[2:04:32] he's going to come into the musicians
[2:04:35] and he's going to want to sing a song
[2:04:38] think about that Jehovah is going to
[2:04:40] want to sing a song but you all know if
[2:04:42] you're going to sing a song you got to
[2:04:44] have some musicians that know the song
[2:04:46] and can play the song and they're in the
[2:04:48] same King
[2:04:50] and then there'll be a Harmony and then
[2:04:52] there'll be a pleasing effect well do
[2:04:54] you know what the prophet of God said he
[2:04:56] said in 1964 in a message the unveiling
[2:04:58] of God he said there was an Old Violin
[2:05:00] one time he said they took that violin
[2:05:02] out there to the auction he said it was
[2:05:04] all crummy it was an old fiddle
[2:05:06] everything couldn't even get a bit on it
[2:05:08] he said finally somebody said I'll give
[2:05:09] you a dollar he said something like that
[2:05:11] can I say this to you the violin Was Out
[2:05:13] Of Tune the I'm closed on this point it
[2:05:16] was out of Harmony amen and it was at
[2:05:19] the auction are you awake it was at the
[2:05:22] auction because somebody got theault it
[2:05:24] was finished yeah somewhere somebody got
[2:05:28] the fa brother Josh nothing else can
[2:05:30] come out of this violin it's finished
[2:05:33] it's scarred take it to the auction and
[2:05:35] get rid of it amen you can't get no more
[2:05:37] music out of this violin but there was
[2:05:39] one standing there glory to God there
[2:05:43] was one standing there that didn't think
[2:05:45] it ought to sell for a dollar didn't
[2:05:47] think it ought to sell for $2 so he went
[2:05:49] up there and struck it in his hands and
[2:05:51] he picked up the bow and he be to rosing
[2:05:53] up the bow and he played a tune and we
[2:05:56] did everyone started crying they never
[2:05:58] heard such music like that in their life
[2:06:01] and then the auctioneer said what am I
[2:06:03] offered Sister Janet one said 2,000
[2:06:06] somebody else said 4,000 somebody else
[2:06:08] said 5,000 somebody said 10,000 brother
[2:06:11] said see what was it it was the Master's
[2:06:14] Hand revealed what was veiled in the old
[2:06:17] instrument the Master's Hand revealed
[2:06:21] what was veiled in the old instrument he
[2:06:23] said and it's the same now this book is
[2:06:25] ragged it's been laughed at it's been
[2:06:28] burnt it's been made fun of and it's on
[2:06:30] the denomination o and the World Council
[2:06:32] of churches but remember there is
[2:06:34] something the old book that is promiser
[2:06:37] would be a predestinated ordained hand
[2:06:39] come one day that would pick it up would
[2:06:42] pick up the Sheep music and would make
[2:06:44] the word this book through a
[2:06:45] predestinated heart to the task it's
[2:06:47] made for reveal the promises that's in
[2:06:50] it listen it depends on Whose hand the
[2:06:54] bow is in are y'all hear me it depends
[2:06:58] on Whose hand the bow is in in other
[2:07:00] words the violin was the word it was the
[2:07:03] Bible it's the message of the hour amen
[2:07:06] and the violin must have a bow and the
[2:07:08] bow is the believer so what does the bow
[2:07:11] do the bow lays across the violin and
[2:07:14] brings out the music of the violin in
[2:07:16] other words the prophet of God said
[2:07:18] Can't You Hear The Master's fol and pull
[2:07:20] across the bow across the word he's the
[2:07:23] same yesterday today and
[2:07:28] forever the Bible is the
[2:07:31] violin the believer is the bow when the
[2:07:34] master got a hold of violin he tuned it
[2:07:37] up and he laid the believer over on at
[2:07:39] the
[2:07:41] bow and he begin to strum across it and
[2:07:44] he begin to play out the sheet music of
[2:07:47] the message of the hour and listen
[2:07:49] Friends The Master's violin has been
[2:07:52] touched by the hand of the
[2:07:54] master as our musicians are coming the
[2:07:57] Master's violin the violin was at the
[2:08:00] auction because it had been
[2:08:04] manhandled it had been
[2:08:06] manhandled it had been mishandled it had
[2:08:09] been handled without permission it had
[2:08:11] been handled in a way Amen to to to
[2:08:14] hinder its progress it had been handled
[2:08:17] in a way to PR vent it from bringing the
[2:08:19] passage purpose yeah yeah Mark 11:23
[2:08:22] Jesus said if you say to this mountain
[2:08:24] be moved and don't doubt in your heart
[2:08:25] but believe somebody say
[2:08:26] believe that what you said will come to
[2:08:29] pass you can have what you
[2:08:33] said can I tell you what brother Ram
[2:08:35] said he said you can't stand here fumble
[2:08:38] in your mind and say you've got and say
[2:08:40] it you've got to be inspired to say
[2:08:44] it I looked at that word fumble brother
[2:08:46] Thomas it means to handle something or
[2:08:48] Clum ly aimlessly to make awkward
[2:08:50] attempts to carry
[2:08:53] something so you're trying to carry
[2:08:56] it you're trying to handle it
[2:09:01] aimlessly but watch a prophet he said
[2:09:04] but Jesus said have faith in God for
[2:09:06] verily I say unto you if you not if I if
[2:09:08] you shall send this mountain be moved
[2:09:10] and doubt doubt in your heart it'll obey
[2:09:11] you it have to it have to just the way
[2:09:14] you say it don't doubt now see now you
[2:09:16] believe it up here now let's get this
[2:09:18] subconscious believe in it and when the
[2:09:20] subconscious and this conscience comes
[2:09:21] in harmony with God then it will
[2:09:26] happen when the subconscious the
[2:09:29] conscience and God comes into
[2:09:33] harmony the Sheep
[2:09:36] music there will be a visible
[2:09:39] manifestation of
[2:09:41] [Music]
[2:09:43] reality I know what the devil does the
[2:09:47] devil takes some of us
[2:09:49] and the devil says we're
[2:09:51] finished I know what the devil does the
[2:09:54] devil takes some of us and he says we're
[2:09:56] finished we're done we need to go to the
[2:09:59] auction but then the but then the
[2:10:01] composure comes by yeah he gets in the
[2:10:04] director and he begins to stand there
[2:10:06] and he begins to say listen there's some
[2:10:08] songs that's got to be

[2:10:14] Salvation somebody's got to sing the
[2:10:16] song of redemption somebody's got to
[2:10:19] sing the song of Deliverance so he
[2:10:21] begins to take some instruments and you

[2:10:25] part of God's Great Symphony after all
[2:10:28] these sermons after all the word I've
