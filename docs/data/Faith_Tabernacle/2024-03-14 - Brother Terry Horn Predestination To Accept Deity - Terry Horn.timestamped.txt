[33:36] text that brother RAM used for Christ is
[33:38] a mystery and we all know what that is
[33:40] don't
[33:46] we I better go ahead and say at
[33:48] Colossians
[33:54] 127 praise the
[33:56] Lord
[33:58] and we going to read actually 25 through
[34:04] 28 it's just a glorious time to be
[34:06] living in deceiving time Hard Times
[34:10] uncertain you can turn me down a little
[34:12] bit get a little ringing up here
[34:14] feedback or something but
[34:17] um it's a wonderful time to be living
[34:20] prise Lord I'm I'm glad I'm alive in
[34:22] this day amen glad to know the truth
[34:26] where would we be if we didn't have the
[34:28] truth we wouldn't be out there deceived
[34:30] like everybody else but thank God for
[34:32] election predestination he called us
[34:34] chose us said he's going to have a
[34:35] perfect bride and I just you know I'm
[34:38] just dumb enough to believe I'm one of
[34:39] them just one of them so so let's look
[34:43] right into the word Colossians 1 start
[34:44] with
[34:47] 25 and the Bible says whereof I am made
[34:51] a minister according to the dispensation
[34:53] of God which is given to me for you to
[34:58] fulfill the word of God sure appreciate
[35:00] those messages brother Shan been
[35:02] teaching on preaching on Ministries
[35:04] there all kinds of Ministries and so
[35:06] much in the different Ministries whether
[35:09] it be the fivefold ministry Ministry of
[35:11] each individual person verse 26 even the
[35:14] mystery remember in the Bible everywhere
[35:16] it says mystery you can just think of
[35:17] secret because it's in the emphatic
[35:20] dialogue it's always secret even the
[35:22] secret of God the mystery of God which
[35:24] had been hid from ages and from
[35:26] Generations but now is made manifest to
[35:30] his Saints you have to remember that was
[35:32] written in Paul's day about 865 or
[35:35] something like that but it wasn't really
[35:37] understand a lot of the scriptures had
[35:39] to be written to put in this cannon of
[35:40] the scripture but were really applied to
[35:42] our date as far as full understanding
[35:46] manifestation and so
[35:48] forth like brother Ben said I'm going to
[35:50] call you bride so that you will
[35:52] understand yes yeah so that you might
[35:55] understand verse 27 to whom God would
[35:58] make known or reveal what is the riches
[36:02] of the glory of this mystery among the
[36:05] Gentiles which is let's everybody say it
[36:08] Christ in you the hope of glory whom we
[36:13] preach warning every man and teaching
[36:16] every man in all wisdom
[36:20] that here's a reason that we may present
[36:23] every man perfect in Christ Jesus mat
[36:27] remember the Ephesus Church was a infant
[36:31] bride this is the mature bride this is
[36:34] the adopted bride this is a last day
[36:36] bride that was just the infant church
[36:38] this is the mature church this is the
[36:40] church that really has the full
[36:42] understanding of the Revelation the word
[36:45] now while you're standing I want to read
[36:47] this
[36:48] quote uh
[36:50] tremendous and Christ mry brother man
[36:52] says the new birth is Christ is the
[36:55] revelation God has revealed to you this
[36:58] great mystery that's the new birth now
[37:02] what are you going to do when you when
[37:04] what are you going what are you going to
[37:06] do when you get all that group together
[37:09] where the Revelation is perfectly in
[37:11] Harmony and God expressing it through
[37:13] his word by the same actions the same
[37:15] signs he did making the word manifest oh
[37:18] if the church only knew its position it
[37:21] will one day then the Rapture will go
[37:23] when it knows what it is what when he
[37:26] says what it is he didn't say who he is
[37:28] which you know it's it's all tied
[37:30] together but he's talking about if the
[37:32] church knew its position then the
[37:34] Rapture go when he knows what it is what
[37:36] its position is so that's that's the
[37:38] focus on that sentence but we know it's
[37:41] Rec bride recognizes who she is so all
[37:43] through the lesson tonight I want you to
[37:45] think on this if you could just only if
[37:49] we could only truly truly truly
[37:52] recognize who we are that's the whole
[37:54] Focus today you know 40 years ago we
[37:57] come to message God God sent a prophet
[38:00] you know uh prayer lines hunting trips
[38:03] all those things wonderful understanding
[38:05] the you know the the the opening of the
[38:08] word in very Simplicity but this is
[38:10] maturity time this is allog together
[38:12] different Focus you got to we have to
[38:14] recognize who we are we're going to need
[38:17] that one day we're going to need that
[38:20] amen then the Rapture will go so if you
[38:23] can only recognize and accept who you
[38:25] really are we won everybody and do
[38:28] everything we can to help us to better
[38:30] realize who and what we are amen some
[38:33] people say well Jesus never said who he
[38:35] really was I beg you pardon he did St
[38:37] John 4 the woman of the well say when a
[38:40] messiah comes he'll tell us these things
[38:41] he said I am he that talks you he did
[38:44] tell me I am the Messiah of course he
[38:46] knew who he was we have to recognize who
[38:49] we are let's pray brother Sean would you
[38:52] lead us in prayer father thank you Jesus
[38:56] approach the word tonight father we pray
[38:58] Lord that your word can find the bedding
[39:01] place in our heart yes Lord May the
[39:04] power of creation do a creative work
[39:07] within us father bless your name thank
[39:10] you Jesus father that we may understand
[39:13] who we are tonight father and I pray
[39:15] that you would just bless the
[39:17] ministering of your word anoint bless
[39:19] your name our prayer anoint our ears and
[39:22] hearts to hear and receive thank you
[39:24] Jesus Jesus Christ name amen thank you
[39:27] Lord you can be seated in the name of
[39:29] the Lord Jesus so when we talk about uh
[39:33] my title tonight it's predestinated to
[39:35] accept
[39:36] deity now when we talk about well I want
[39:41] to give kind of equal emphasis to
[39:43] predestination uh accepting and deity
[39:46] and we talk about predestinate to accept
[39:48] deity now we're we're talking about
[39:51] predes to accept deity in you now we
[39:53] know Christ was deity so that's not the
[39:55] issue not accepting that Christ was
[39:57] deity
[39:58] deity in us our deity the deity that's
[40:00] been assigned to us we got to accept
[40:03] that it's more important brother man
[40:05] said it's more important you believe
[40:06] what the word says you are than what you
[40:08] think you are yourself so what it
[40:10] declares that's the way it's going to be
[40:13] so let's look at that a little bit
[40:15] tonight if we can predestinated to
[40:17] accept deity now one of the hardest
[40:19] things for us to do is to lay aside
[40:22] religious Traditions you know and you
[40:24] know somebody might say well you know
[40:26] everybody's doing it so much must be
[40:27] right well that's kind of the Catholic
[40:28] Church you know we we stood for 1,700
[40:30] years well they killed 68 million no
[40:32] wonder they stood you know they had the
[40:34] power the you know the Inquisition
[40:35] everything else if it didn't line up you
[40:37] just you know cut their head off you
[40:38] know but no but I mean but Jesus said
[40:41] straight is the gate and there's a way a
[40:43] few be that find it so just because the
[40:45] masses believe it that's that's the best
[40:47] way to be we better realize better get
[40:49] away from that because only uh few be
[40:52] that find it so we understand that now
[40:55] this is Satan's Eden and almost
[40:57] everything we see taste feel smell here
[41:00] we know it's it's contrary to God's word
[41:02] it's deceptive it's carnal and you know
[41:04] that brother man said that God took
[41:05] 6,000 years to conform this world to
[41:08] what he wanted to be and Satan took
[41:10] 6,000 years to deform this world to what
[41:12] he wanted to be so now Satan is the God
[41:14] of this evil age he's the God of this
[41:16] world and so he is he is he is the ruler
[41:20] of all Kingdoms at this present time
[41:23] God's got it all in control but Satan is
[41:25] the ruler of this Earth at this present
[41:27] time now we've never had a messenger who
[41:30] could ever stand and correctly make this
[41:32] statement that I'm going to read we've
[41:33] read it so many times in visible Union
[41:35] but to just show us what I want the
[41:37] direction we want to go he said you are
[41:39] standing completely Justified can can we
[41:42] accept this statement you are standing
[41:44] completely Justified as though you never
[41:46] did it at the
[41:47] beginning this is my message to the
[41:50] church now you are pure now he's
[41:52] declaring what you are I'm going to call
[41:55] you a bride you are pure P virtuous
[41:58] sinless Bride of the son of the Living
[42:01] God every man and woman born of the
[42:03] spirit of God washed in the blood of
[42:05] Jesus Christ and believes every word of
[42:08] God stands as though you never sin at
[42:11] the first place you are perfect the
[42:15] blood of Jesus Christ you are perfect
[42:17] now he is making a declaration of what
[42:19] we are can can we accept that yes can we
[42:23] truly accept that we we we we have it
[42:26] here amen
[42:27] do we have it here truly that's saying
[42:31] can we can we really accept for yourself
[42:34] who you are as I said it's more
[42:36] important you got to believe what the
[42:37] word says we are than what we feel we
[42:40] are because we got to get away from C
[42:42] taste feel smell here we're not by
[42:44] feelings at all it's by faith it's by
[42:46] revelation we must accept it by
[42:49] Revelation now God yes God put that
[42:51] identifier in you brother man calls it
[42:53] representation that predestinated seed
[42:55] of God germ of God God's life it was
[42:58] dormant for many years until the light
[43:00] of the word struck that seed and it came
[43:02] to life but he was there we were born
[43:04] with it God put it there you know our
[43:06] names were put on the lands but before
[43:08] the foundation of world we know that so
[43:10] that representation was put there God
[43:12] put it there we've got to accept the
[43:14] fact that God put it
[43:16] there amen we got to we got to you we we
[43:20] we have to accept that there's something
[43:22] about we have to accept it
[43:25] amen as the story was told and I'm going
[43:28] to tell this little story because it
[43:29] fits with the the lesson night and it's
[43:32] was told about Napoleon and I remember
[43:35] this story being told actually brother
[43:39] um arasmus Theo arasmus told it down in
[43:41] the camp meeting probably 35 years ago
[43:44] you were probably down there at the
[43:46] meetings you brother Rasmus and and
[43:48] brother green all them back years ago
[43:50] and way The Story Goes it's true story
[43:52] about Napoleon the great conqueror and
[43:54] one day that Napoleon was out he was on
[43:56] his white horse and he was had a passing
[43:58] review with all of his soldiers had them
[44:00] all lined up Rank and filed you know and
[44:02] he was passing through them inspecting
[44:05] the soldiers and and had a big field day
[44:07] I guess you would say and they were all
[44:09] at attention you know it's a great
[44:12] Mighty conqueror napol would pass
[44:13] through just Rose after Rose after Rose
[44:17] and different brigades of them and so as
[44:19] he was passing through on his White
[44:21] Horse there uh and now you know you
[44:23] stand in a tition I mean and when if you
[44:25] move if you break record anything they
[44:28] chop your head off I mean you're gone
[44:29] you're just a little old one strip or a
[44:31] little Corporal or whatever it was you
[44:32] know you you you don't do anything
[44:35] contrary to Napoleon I mean he's he's
[44:37] the he's the great conqueror so anyway
[44:39] he's was passing by right in front of
[44:41] this group of soldiers all these
[44:43] soldiers here and it's standing in
[44:45] attention and about that time his true
[44:48] story his White Horse it stumbled so
[44:51] this one soldier right in front he
[44:54] actually broke Rank and ran up to to the
[44:57] horse to steady the horse which he could
[44:59] have been killed for it he steadied the
[45:01] horse and Napoleon looks down to the
[45:03] little Corporal and he says thank you
[45:07] Captain and the little Buck Sergeant the
[45:09] little Corporal looks up at Napoleon
[45:11] says thank you sir I
[45:16] accept think about that so the next
[45:19] words out of the little corporal's mouth
[45:20] was he said sir to which Brigade am I
[45:24] the captain of so wheels are going in
[45:27] Napoleon's mind he said you will now be
[45:30] the captain of the ninth Brigade so NPO
[45:34] so a little now he got a feel promotion
[45:37] so he he breaks Rank and he goes out
[45:40] through the multitudes there he says
[45:42] where is the n Brigade where is the
[45:44] ninth Brigade I am now the captain of
[45:46] the ninth Brigade and they said what
[45:47] what are you doing what are you doing
[45:49] don't you know he could kill you who
[45:50] told you to do this have you ever heard
[45:53] of
[45:54] Napoleon like okay I got the authority
[45:58] so Napoleon tells his right-hand man
[46:01] that's with him right there he said now
[46:03] listen here this is the focus he said
[46:05] you train that man up he'll be exactly
[46:08] what I said he
[46:09] was and thus he did you know how Israel
[46:14] when they find a lot of their leaders in
[46:16] the military different places and
[46:18] probably they probably do in some
[46:20] different schools I know they'll take a
[46:22] little young children like that fourth
[46:24] fifth sixth grade where they go out to
[46:25] recess and and out of 30 40 children
[46:28] you're going to have one or two leaders
[46:30] you always there one of one of them is
[46:31] going to be a leader they see there's a
[46:34] certain trait there's a certain
[46:35] characteristic about that young child so
[46:37] they said that's going to be a leader
[46:39] right there he he shows that potential
[46:41] for leadership and that's one way that
[46:43] they find their their leader so so we
[46:46] have to accept what God has said now
[46:50] there was something about that little
[46:51] Corporal I mean there was something in
[46:52] there why in the face of death he could
[46:54] have been killed for that why did he
[46:55] break rake and because of his loyal
[46:58] master Napoleon he wanted to save his
[46:59] life he was willing to risk his life for
[47:01] his
[47:02] master so he is willing to risk his life
[47:05] and he did but look what his promotion
[47:08] was I
[47:11] accept I I I told that that same story
[47:15] in another sermon years ago when I
[47:17] preached at Dar Salam and a camp meeting
[47:20] there in Tanzania and brother shija he
[47:22] liked it so much he just made he said I
[47:24] accept that become the theme for the
[47:26] whole camp meeting I accept so that's
[47:30] what we want to do we accept we
[47:32] certainly want to accept and thank God
[47:34] we have yes
[47:39] amen praise the lord it's 10:00 going to
[47:42] come here
[47:44] soon yes train up that man he'll be
[47:47] exactly what they said he was now that
[47:49] man had a certain characteristic now
[47:51] listen God put something in us now
[47:53] remember Mankind in his Fallen State we
[47:56] we had had no desire for God we had the
[47:59] Bible says God seeks man man does not
[48:01] seek God now don't don't get confused
[48:03] with that because after you're born
[48:04] again after you're truly converted born
[48:06] again you do seek after God you want
[48:08] more of God you want all of God but
[48:10] before that you no man can call Jesus
[48:13] the Christ except the Holy Ghost draws
[48:14] in first it's not in a uh unregenerated
[48:18] person to seek after God it's just not
[48:20] there God has to put that in there so we
[48:24] have to accept the fact that there's
[48:25] something in there it might be dormant
[48:27] for many many years but our fallen
[48:30] nature we had nothing to desire God no
[48:33] no no means to love God right now here's
[48:37] a let's listen to this this uh quote
[48:40] here out of Easter seal and this is
[48:42] really good here's a tremendous quote
[48:44] about Abel about Abel really tremendous
[48:47] out of the Easter seal they put him to
[48:49] death speaking of Jesus brother man said
[48:51] they put him death killed him just like
[48:54] they did faithful Abel why was Abel
[48:57] killed now listen to this statement why
[48:59] was Abel killed now we know just
[49:02] jealousy Cain got jealous as his brother
[49:04] we know because you know Cain's
[49:06] sacrifice was not was refused Abel's
[49:08] sacrifice was accepted it was accepted
[49:11] but why was he killed not only jealousy
[49:14] but why was he jealous brother man said
[49:17] because not talking about Abel because
[49:18] in his heart he had the revelation of
[49:22] God's acceptance of what it took to
[49:24] redeem man from sin yeah
[49:27] I'm going read that again because in his
[49:29] heart he had the revelation of God's
[49:32] acceptance of what it took to REM redeem
[49:35] man from sin he knew it was blood Abel
[49:38] knew it was by Blood he had that
[49:41] Revelation that's the reason they put
[49:43] Jesus to death because in him was the
[49:46] revelation of what had taken for God to
[49:49] cure sin that's the very reason today
[49:52] that we're against the that's the very
[49:55] reason today that they're against the
[49:57] real Church of the Living God because it
[49:58] preaches the cure for sin the things
[50:01] that makes people live different amen so
[50:04] I thought that was real good about able
[50:06] he had that revelation of what God would
[50:10] accept that's why I could correctly use
[50:13] this title of predestinated to accept
[50:16] deity we've got that Revelation but God
[50:18] gave us that Revelation nothing Upon Our
[50:20] Own that's right now we believe in
[50:22] predestination we don't have that's one
[50:24] thing we don't have to in the message we
[50:26] do not have to convince anybody of
[50:28] predestination but I I I just there's
[50:31] hundreds of quotes but I just wrote down
[50:33] to I just want to uh just I don't want
[50:35] to confirm anything because we all
[50:37] believe it but I thought this these were
[50:38] good Paul in Romans 8 he said foolish
[50:41] man who can tell the the Potter what to
[50:43] do about it when the clay raises up says
[50:45] why you why make me this or thus did not
[50:49] he raise Pharaoh up for the same purpose
[50:51] that he might show his glory down in
[50:52] Egypt he hardens who he will justify who
[50:56] he will it's not him that willth or him
[50:59] that runthe mercy so listen what he
[51:03] brother says so you have nothing to do
[51:05] with it you have it one thing to do it's
[51:08] Grace it's a free gift there's not one
[51:11] thing you can do about it God has given
[51:13] it to you and that's the will of God
[51:15] that's the thing that God has
[51:17] predestinated in you God put that Jean
[51:20] that seed that that that life even
[51:23] though it was dormant for years he put
[51:25] that in your soul you were born with
[51:27] that in your soul the preacher didn't
[51:29] put it there God put it there that's
[51:31] right another place he said Moses
[51:34] couldn't help being Moses and Jeremiah
[51:36] God Jeremiah God called him before he
[51:38] was even formed in his mother's womb
[51:40] said I knew you Sanctified you and
[51:42] ordained you to be a prophet said he had
[51:44] nothing to do with it yeah so we got to
[51:47] and we believe this you know now when we
[51:49] was in Pentecost there's you in
[51:51] Pentecost you don't mention
[51:53] predestination they throw you out on
[51:55] your ear I mean they did not believe in
[51:57] pred none zero but thank God we have a
[52:00] revelation of it and I know it's you
[52:01] know to really understand predestination
[52:03] it takes it takes it takes a little bit
[52:05] of re Revelation because you know it's
[52:07] not God's will that any should perish
[52:09] you know and God's no respect of persons
[52:11] and on and on and on but he is the great
[52:14] Potter and we're the clay the Potter has
[52:16] the right to make one vessel of honor
[52:18] and another vessel Of Dishonor that's
[52:20] just God now it's we need to understand
[52:23] for for my lesson tonight we need to
[52:26] understand stand from the beginning
[52:27] God's purpose and Satan's purpose
[52:29] dealing with Humanity so I got really a
[52:32] an interesting thought here that help
[52:35] God's purpose and Satan's purpose now
[52:39] God's power to transform let's just read
[52:41] for a moment in the book of Isaiah let's
[52:42] go down fourth uh 14th chapter oh we
[52:45] know the scripture how they're far from
[52:47] Heaven oh Lucifer and then so he reads
[52:49] that scripture brother man says Satan's
[52:52] purpose from Eden listen now Satan's
[52:55] purpose from Eden was to make his own
[52:58] self an Eden and exalt himself above so
[53:04] the stars of God would worship Him Sons
[53:06] would worship Him and and this is in
[53:09] Satan this is in God's power to
[53:10] transform 1965 and brother Ben says and
[53:14] he has absolutely carried it out
[53:17] now Satan is the God of this world no
[53:21] question about that we know that to be
[53:22] true it was his desire to be
[53:25] worshiped Supreme control of this Earth
[53:28] what he does after 6,000 years he has
[53:31] succeeded you could say this day this
[53:32] scripture is fulfilled all right so we
[53:35] must understand that that's what that's
[53:37] what Satan desired Lucifer's desired and
[53:40] we we must understand that okay now
[53:43] Satan is presently the God of this evil
[53:45] AE you're living in Satan's jungle and
[53:47] all the wild beast you're camping out
[53:49] with we got to live with them every day
[53:50] but you know what in the midst of all
[53:52] that God still has a spotless Bride on
[53:53] this Earth today as I speak is living
[53:56] today not will be is living today and
[53:59] we're in the closing pages of history
[54:01] and you're living in Satan's Paradise
[54:03] Satan's Ena Eden Satan Zenith but this
[54:05] is still the day for the bride the move
[54:08] is on for the bride now watch this
[54:10] listen here in God of this evil a you
[54:12] talking about Satan how dominating Satan
[54:15] is today how much influence he's had
[54:17] today where he is today with his
[54:19] children listen Satan Satan's got
[54:21] children brother B says now listen for
[54:23] Satan is not spoke of as the god of any
[54:25] other age but this age he wasn't spoke
[54:28] of the god of the age of Noah he wasn't
[54:30] spoke of the god of the age of Moses the
[54:32] god of the age of Elijah but this evil
[54:35] age he is oh don't miss it he is a God
[54:38] now listen he is a God of this evil age
[54:41] worship I'm going to read it just like
[54:43] he said worshiped by millions and
[54:45] billions millions and billions of people
[54:49] and they don't know
[54:51] it that is sad that is sad and you know
[54:55] what most of them people will not make
[54:57] it most of them people will not be saved
[54:59] I mean that's straight As the gate in
[55:01] every way few be that find it when you
[55:03] think about election and predestination
[55:05] brothers and sisters you ought to be so
[55:06] thankful every day and I'm not saying
[55:08] you don't you probably do thank God he
[55:10] let me see it thank God he predestinated
[55:12] me thank God I can understand it thank
[55:14] God he gave me a desire to understand it
[55:16] thank God I can see the what little bit
[55:18] I can see thank God he let me see this
[55:22] truth Satan is worshiped by millions and
[55:25] millions in this day and they don't even
[55:27] know
[55:28] it that's true they're blinded to
[55:31] it what a day what a day so Satan is a
[55:34] God of this world
[55:36] now Satan listen Satan's trium because
[55:39] he's become the god of this world that's
[55:41] that's no hindrance to God Satan Satan
[55:44] only works by permission so God
[55:46] permitted Satan to do this and so he
[55:48] only works by permission God is still
[55:51] got it all in control sure amen remember
[55:55] this as we well know this is honing down
[55:57] honing down time Capstone time getting
[56:00] lesser and lesser fewer and
[56:02] fewer okay like job God had a hedge
[56:06] around him we know God had a head around
[56:08] job's soul today we have a hedge around
[56:10] our soul it's called The
[56:13] Token the token Satan could only do to
[56:16] job what God permitted Satan to do to
[56:19] job Satan can only do to us what God
[56:22] permits Satan to do to us but he cannot
[56:25] get to that
[56:27] now why is this last generation so
[56:29] different remember this is the age of
[56:31] the pale horse rider that fourth old
[56:33] Grizzly colored mix pale sickly looking
[56:35] old horse everything in this age is
[56:37] hybrid we know that yeah hybrid religion
[56:41] the church is hybrid the marriages are
[56:42] hybrid food is hybrid politics is hybrid
[56:45] everything's hybrid but on the other
[56:47] side of the coin on the other side of
[56:49] the coin this is a bride AE the only age
[56:51] named after God's wife the bride the
[56:53] seals are open the full word been born
[56:55] in the manifestation the token could
[56:57] only come in the evening time it's the
[56:59] only age of Total Restoration everything

[57:03] our day today wonderful age to be living
[57:07] amen even the spoken word you said the
[57:08] spoken word what about them squirrels
[57:10] what do you think that was God gave him
[57:12] he said speak you're out honey what do
[57:13] you need the spoken word even in E
[57:17] condition when the Colorado Storm was
[57:18] rebuked he's coming off that mountain
[57:20] said why don't you walk with me goes
[57:21] down he comes back up goes back up and
[57:24] and speaks to the storm and rebukes
[57:26] storm and goes away by the spoken word
[57:28] goes back down off the mountain like
[57:29] that he sees those three deer and the
[57:31] deer come to him said I could shoot all
[57:33] three of you you know just as as as
[57:35] quick as you know he could reload like
[57:37] that but he said they just kept getting
[57:39] closer and closer and closer he said I'm
[57:40] walking down this mountain and virgin
[57:42] Timber why did he say virgin Timber why
[57:44] did the animals you know not fear that
[57:47] man why after he had spoke that it's a
[57:50] eating condition just like it was back
[57:52] in the Garden of Eden same kind of
[57:54] eating condition there so we see the
[57:56] first manifestation first matured Son of
[57:58] God oh so now and this is the only age
[58:02] where brother M taught us that the age
[58:04] where the Mighty God Veil unveiled
[58:06] before us that the only ways that the
[58:07] word is made flesh the word is made
[58:11] flesh deity walking again in shoe
[58:14] leather we've got to accept that deity
[58:17] the only people that has heard from
[58:18] their theophany this is the age you got
[58:21] to remember now Satan had his plan but
[58:24] God had his plan everything that Adam
[58:26] lost has been restored back to it so
[58:28] what is God going to do it only makes
[58:29] sense he's going to have a bride that's
[58:30] perfect just like just like at the
[58:32] beginning was perfect not in our flesh
[58:34] but because we have been our Nature has
[58:37] been changed our soul has been changed
[58:38] everything about our Inside Man the real
[58:40] you has been changed so it's gone back
[58:42] to that Perfection
[58:47] again so we're at a but we're at a
[58:50] tremendous dilemma a bride is coming to
[58:53] her Zenith a church is rising up and
[58:55] Satan is at his Seth that he's the God
[58:57] of this evil age so the stage is set for
[58:59] a final
[59:02] battle so we know who's going to
[59:06] win yes amen s Satan is flexing his
[59:09] muscles and the bride's recognizing who
[59:11] she is so we have the greatest battle
[59:14] ever fought don't
[59:15] we now brother B says this in God
[59:19] perfecting these church now in verse he
[59:22] says now uh to make he said to make you
[59:26] perfect and to bring you back into
[59:28] Fellowship he's God perfect this church
[59:30] he's talking about what God wants to do
[59:31] make us perfect and bring us back into
[59:34] Fellowship to make you perfect now
[59:36] remember what we read in in verse 28 of
[59:39] Colossians that we may pres the Paul
[59:41] said that we may present every man
[59:43] perfect in Christ Jesus that means
[59:45] mature not perfect in our flesh mature
[59:47] adopted sons of God make you perfect and
[59:50] bring you back into Fellowship
[59:52] Fellowship like he had in the Garden of
[59:53] Eden the right kind of Fellowship he he
[59:56] brings you through that blood cell to
[59:57] himself you get it through the blood
[59:59] cell of the Lord Jesus that veiled the
[1:00:02] life of Jehovah and we coming through
[1:00:04] that blood cell becomes part of that
[1:00:06] life his life so deity itself lays in
[1:00:10] the man that's received the Holy Ghost
[1:00:13] deity in itself lays in the man that's
[1:00:16] received the Holy Ghost I'm going to say
[1:00:17] that about seven times so deity itself
[1:00:20] lays in the man that's received the Holy
[1:00:21] Ghost when you get it catch up with me
[1:00:24] so deity itself lays in the man that's
[1:00:26] receed the Holy Ghost let's all see it
[1:00:29] deity in itself lays in the man that's
[1:00:32] received the Holy Ghost or a woman so
[1:00:35] you got that you truly been have a word
[1:00:38] birth you've been born to the spirit of
[1:00:39] God you your your whole life and focus
[1:00:42] and everything is Jesus Christ you truly
[1:00:44] know you've been born from above deity
[1:00:46] lays inside of you but you've got to
[1:00:49] accept that that's right you got to
[1:00:50] accept that brother B says so deity
[1:00:53] itself lays in the man that's received
[1:00:55] the Holy Spirit remember and I don't
[1:00:57] want to get off I don't want to get off
[1:00:58] because the Bible says in the book of
[1:00:59] Acts God gives the Holy Ghost to them
[1:01:01] that
[1:01:03] obey why why do a lot of people when
[1:01:05] they repent be baptized in the name of
[1:01:07] Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift
[1:01:09] of the Holy why don't they receive the
[1:01:10] go Holy Ghost say actually you should
[1:01:12] you could you should but most people
[1:01:14] don't why there's a reason brother
[1:01:16] explains that in many different places
[1:01:18] so I'll just let that go you research it
[1:01:20] so deity lays inside the man that Fe the
[1:01:22] Holy Spirit you are son I'm Brandon by
[1:01:25] birth I'm part part of Mr Miss brandom
[1:01:27] is in me and if you become a son and
[1:01:29] daughter of God part of deity lays in
[1:01:32] you so Napoleon is saying thank you
[1:01:35] Captain the little Corporal says thank
[1:01:37] you sir I
[1:01:39] accept I accept he said I'm a captain
[1:01:42] I'm a captain he said I'm the the
[1:01:45] captain of the ninth Brigade I'm going
[1:01:47] to find the ninth Brigade we're talking
[1:01:49] about Ministry brother sea whatever he
[1:01:50] declares us to do let's find out what he
[1:01:52] wants us to do and do it he's done
[1:01:54] declared it let's do it we're going to
[1:01:56] do it he made a way that we could do it
[1:01:59] so you see how the devil robs you said
[1:02:01] oh I can't do this all things are
[1:02:03] possible them that believe no matter
[1:02:05] what it is you are a part of deity deity

[1:02:18] deity a son of uh a son not a servant a
[1:02:22] son and daughter not a
[1:02:24] servant I got to thinking about a son
[1:02:26] not a servant amen and I don't want to
[1:02:28] preach the the message of the prodical
[1:02:30] son but you know when the prodical son
[1:02:32] left God is inheritance went down there
[1:02:34] and he left it spent all of his
[1:02:35] inherence and come to himself realizing
[1:02:38] hey you know all the food that even the
[1:02:40] servants eat better than I do now I'm
[1:02:41] starving this so he said I'm going to go
[1:02:43] back tell my father I'm sorry just make
[1:02:45] me a servant I am no longer worthy to be
[1:02:46] a son make me a servant so when the
[1:02:48] prodical son is coming back home it's a
[1:02:50] very very interesting thing takes place
[1:02:54] as a prodical son's coming home preach
[1:02:55] whole message on so you're going to get
[1:02:57] another message free here tonight what
[1:02:59] happens what happens the father first of
[1:03:01] all the father saw now we're talking
[1:03:03] about he's a son not a servant we are
[1:03:05] Sons and Daughters of God not servants
[1:03:07] the Jews are servants we're Sons and
[1:03:11] Daughters the father sees the prodical
[1:03:13] son coming back first of all if he a far
[1:03:15] off so for him to seem a far all first
[1:03:17] of all he had to be looking for him he
[1:03:19] wasn't doing his work of about B he had
[1:03:21] to be looking for him he saw him a far
[1:03:22] off second thing is when he saw him a
[1:03:24] far off he ran to meet him now it's
[1:03:27] absolutely for for Elder a Hebrew Elder
[1:03:31] is absolutely a disgrace for a Hebrew
[1:03:33] Elder to run that's Jewish law but he
[1:03:36] broke every protocol he ran to meet
[1:03:39] him they're not supposed to run at all
[1:03:41] that's that's Jewish law not only that
[1:03:44] he fell on his neck and kissed him
[1:03:46] that's a sign of welcome I mean he spent
[1:03:48] all his living in right righteous living
[1:03:51] but he welcome me back didn't ask no
[1:03:52] question he welcome him back then he
[1:03:55] gets him back to the house he puts the
[1:03:57] best robe on
[1:03:58] him you can see why the elder brother
[1:04:00] was jealous why the elder brother hated
[1:04:02] it now you got to understand the best
[1:04:04] robe what about the best robe servants
[1:04:06] wore short robes the sons wore long
[1:04:10] robes but the best robe was one a robe
[1:04:13] that was stored in the house and only
[1:04:15] used for special occasions no other time
[1:04:18] so he has bring out the best robe and
[1:04:20] put it on this man put it on this
[1:04:22] Renegade you might say that's the way
[1:04:24] the world would look at it
[1:04:26] not only that but he puts a ring on his
[1:04:28] finger what does that symbolize that
[1:04:29] symbolize honor and d and honor and
[1:04:32] dignity what did this son do he he
[1:04:34] wasted all of his money what honor and
[1:04:35] dignity he' had but the father put it on
[1:04:37] him I'm talking about the Father's Love
[1:04:39] I'm talking about the Father's Love For
[1:04:41] sons and not servants what God how God
[1:04:43] loves
[1:04:44] us not only he put a ring on his finger
[1:04:47] he put shoes on his feet what does that
[1:04:48] represent no shoes barefooted all slaves
[1:04:51] were barefooted they took their shoes
[1:04:53] away they wore slaves so he came back
[1:04:55] bare fo but the father says put shoes on
[1:04:57] him that's a sign of sunship that's a
[1:04:59] sign of Freedom again he put shoes on
[1:05:02] his feet then he says he then he gets
[1:05:04] him back to the house and he tells the
[1:05:06] wife there to or service he said kill
[1:05:08] the fatted C brother sister that was not
[1:05:10] peanut butter and jelly that was the
[1:05:12] fatted Cal why why do you why do you
[1:05:15] think that the elder brother said yeah
[1:05:17] look you haven't never done this for me
[1:05:18] I've served you all this years you never
[1:05:20] done that for me but what was it it was
[1:05:22] once he was dead now he's alive he was
[1:05:25] in sin he's come back
[1:05:27] alive amen why shouldn't he why
[1:05:30] shouldn't he dress him up he was a son
[1:05:32] he never was a servant he was a son he
[1:05:34] was just a backsliding son a fallen son
[1:05:37] but he was still his
[1:05:39] son to me that Parable should have been
[1:05:41] the Father's Love instead of the
[1:05:42] prodical son all that focused to me was
[1:05:44] on the father what he did for him oh
[1:05:47] tremendous tremendous story brother and
[1:05:50] at the at the bottom of this paragraph
[1:05:52] brother B is talking about being part of
[1:05:54] God through the blood cell he said
[1:05:56] that's what makes Satan mad that's what
[1:05:59] shakes him when the Church of Jesus
[1:06:02] Christ only knew who they were brother
[1:06:04] he's talking about recognizing you're
[1:06:06] part of that blood cell when that blood
[1:06:07] cell was broken in Calvary you were in
[1:06:09] there you're in there part of God
[1:06:12] through that blood in Christ of mystery
[1:06:14] brother says the new birth is a
[1:06:16] revelation God has revealed this to this
[1:06:19] you this great mystery that's the new
[1:06:20] birth oh if the church knew its position
[1:06:23] well one day then the Rapture will go
[1:06:25] when it knows what it is got to read
[1:06:27] that again amen so we must recognize
[1:06:30] you're part of God you're a part of your
[1:06:32] father we're a part of we're made we're
[1:06:34] a family it's Christ in you the Bible
[1:06:36] said it's Christ in you the hope of
[1:06:39] glory and I think about that many times
[1:06:41] Christ in you it's just like the
[1:06:44] scripture uh the foot washing scripture
[1:06:46] and Jesus is telling Peter said if I
[1:06:48] wash you not you have no part with me he
[1:06:51] didn't say you have no part in me
[1:06:53] because Peter was he was predestinated
[1:06:55] to have the kingdom to have the keys to
[1:06:57] the kingdom rather he was chosen of God
[1:06:59] to be one of the 12 apostles how can
[1:07:01] Jesus turn around and say well because
[1:07:02] you didn't wash my face you have no part
[1:07:03] in me he couldn't say that he knows he
[1:07:05] was ordained a lie but he said if you
[1:07:07] have no part with me that means you have
[1:07:09] no Fellowship but he didn't say you have
[1:07:11] no part in me it's a whole you got to
[1:07:13] watch these words he said you have no
[1:07:16] part with me Fellowship he didn't say
[1:07:18] you didn't have any part in me because
[1:07:20] he was predestinated to be part of them
[1:07:22] oh it's just beautiful I just love the
[1:07:24] Bible you know it's every word is just
[1:07:26] amen and perfect think about that Peter
[1:07:29] was chosen to receive the keys to the
[1:07:31] kingdom as I said and so and and also
[1:07:34] Peter was predestinated God to be one of
[1:07:36] the 12 apostles and which makes him you
[1:07:38] know one of the 24 Elders I mean just
[1:07:39] like John John you know on the aisle of
[1:07:42] patmas when he was Saul in Revelation 5
[1:07:44] the 24 Elders you know was always
[1:07:46] sitting around the throne he already
[1:07:47] knew he was one of the patri uh uh
[1:07:50] Apostle John was one of the one of the
[1:07:51] Apostles you know the 12 apostles and 12
[1:07:54] Patriarchs and he saw
[1:07:55] the 12 and 12 sitting around the Sun
[1:07:57] John saw John saw himself there he said
[1:08:00] he's already
[1:08:01] there and the same thing about when
[1:08:04] brother B went beyond the curent of time
[1:08:05] he saw you there he saw me there he saw
[1:08:08] himself there we got to
[1:08:11] recognize we got we got we just have to
[1:08:13] recognize these things are true this has
[1:08:15] happened in our generation true he he
[1:08:18] saw me there he saw you there it's it's
[1:08:22] nothing we don't take lightly like well
[1:08:24] you know he had a transl out a vision
[1:08:26] and know a bunch of no no he he saw me
[1:08:28] and you there just like you have to you
[1:08:30] have to you have to really recognize I
[1:08:33] heard my name called brother man said
[1:08:34] you heard from theop when you receive
[1:08:37] the word of God God accepts your faith
[1:08:39] gives you the Holy
[1:08:41] Ghost you've heard from your theop
[1:08:43] you've got you have to AC we have to
[1:08:45] accept the fact that what he said that's
[1:08:47] what I
[1:08:48] am now let's go a little step
[1:08:51] further s in church age he said but we
[1:08:54] do know want to review our case for the
[1:08:56] first we all know surely that the
[1:08:58] purpose of God stands in
[1:08:59] election it was God's purpose to bring
[1:09:01] forth listen it was God's purpose to
[1:09:04] bring forth the people like unto
[1:09:08] himself predestinated to accept deity it
[1:09:11] was God's purpose to bring forth a
[1:09:13] people like unto himself and that would
[1:09:15] be a word bride she was chosen before
[1:09:17] the foundation of world in him and he
[1:09:19] got in him in bold letters there again
[1:09:21] just what I said about you know Peter
[1:09:23] there at the foot washing you have no
[1:09:24] part with me not in me he couldn't he
[1:09:27] was in him he couldn't he couldn't deny
[1:09:28] that he couldn't throw him out but with
[1:09:31] me she was chosen before found in him
[1:09:35] she was for and beloved before she was
[1:09:38] ever brought forth during the ages upon
[1:09:39] the Earth she was Redeemed by his blood
[1:09:42] and can never come into condemnation she
[1:09:44] can never be in judgment because sin
[1:09:46] cannot be imputed to her blessed is a
[1:09:49] man whom God will not impute
[1:09:52] sin true I accept
[1:09:56] accept amen I
[1:09:59] accept now the first man was like now
[1:10:03] the first man was like unto himself in
[1:10:06] Genesis 1 126 and God said make let us
[1:10:09] make man in our image after our likess
[1:10:12] let them have dominion over the fish of
[1:10:13] the sea over the fowl of the air over
[1:10:15] the cattle and over all the Earth and
[1:10:17] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[1:10:19] upon the earth oh how Satan hated that
[1:10:22] yes he did so God created man in in his
[1:10:25] own image God created man in his own
[1:10:27] image didn't create Lucifer In His Image
[1:10:30] God created man in his own image in the
[1:10:32] image of God created he him male and
[1:10:34] female created him them Satan hated that
[1:10:39] now you know what Satan hated one
[1:10:42] Genesis
[1:10:43] 1:27 because Satan's is jealous and he
[1:10:47] because see Satan Lucifer used to be
[1:10:50] God's right-hand man as brother B said
[1:10:51] had Fellowship With God all but a
[1:10:53] Creator iniquity rose up him in in
[1:10:56] Lucifer God kicked him out now he don't
[1:10:59] have fellowship with God anymore but God
[1:11:01] desired to have fellowship with man and
[1:11:03] Lucifer Satan hates that hates that just
[1:11:08] like Cain Cain was jealous of Abel
[1:11:10] because Abel's uh sacrifice was was
[1:11:14] received by God and because Abel had a
[1:11:17] revelation of what God's acceptance was
[1:11:19] Cain hated him for that and killed him
[1:11:22] for it the rest of the reason the world
[1:11:24] hates us because what we
[1:11:27] believe now God uh could not have would
[1:11:31] fellowship with man God would now have
[1:11:34] fellowship with man so Satan had to do
[1:11:36] something to alter the change destroy
[1:11:38] God's fell fellowship with man of course
[1:11:40] that was a false we understand that
[1:11:42] Satan fell listen God did nothing for
[1:11:45] listen when Satan fell God did nothing
[1:11:47] for Satan nothing but when man fell God
[1:11:50] did everything to redeem man he could
[1:11:53] care less about Satan he's he's here to
[1:11:55] do his job test man like brother B said
[1:11:57] in uh and uh not Godless evil age but
[1:12:01] one of the mess he said why why did God
[1:12:04] put us here in this age to be tested and
[1:12:09] tried amen not only not only he wanted
[1:12:12] to have Fellowship back with man but he
[1:12:15] wanted to dwell in man that's what God
[1:12:18] desired he want to dwell in man and God
[1:12:20] is a spirit God wanted to dwell in man
[1:12:22] but Satan wanted to Satan wanted to
[1:12:24] think same thing
[1:12:25] now listen here here's here's a real a
[1:12:28] real Stinger if you will in the Ephesian
[1:12:31] church
[1:12:32] now well I'll just read it so you'll
[1:12:36] understand God wants to get inside man
[1:12:39] and Satan wants to get inside
[1:12:41] man now listen to
[1:12:44] this now why did this have to be so
[1:12:47] theasian Church age why was it that the
[1:12:50] seed of the serpent must come this way
[1:12:52] Man was created for God man was to be
[1:12:56] the temple of God the place of God's
[1:12:59] rest the Holy Spirit was man the temple
[1:13:04] Satan has known this all along he also
[1:13:08] wants to indwell man even as God so does
[1:13:12] but God has reserved to himself that
[1:13:15] right Satan cannot do that God Alone
[1:13:19] appeared in human flesh Satan could not
[1:13:22] and cannot do that he does does not have
[1:13:25] created Powers the only way for Satan to
[1:13:28] accomplish what he wanted to do was to
[1:13:30] enter the serpent in Eden even has he
[1:13:33] entered by evil spirits into the swine
[1:13:35] of gadera God does not enter animals but
[1:13:39] Satan can and will to accomplish his
[1:13:43] ends that's what he did with the serpent
[1:13:45] in the guard of Eden he could not have a
[1:13:47] child directly by Eve as did God by Mary
[1:13:50] so he entered into the serpent and then
[1:13:53] begal Eve he seduced her and by her did
[1:13:57] Satan have a child through Eve or
[1:13:59] vicariously he says Cain bore the full
[1:14:03] listen
[1:14:04] Cain Satan's first son Cain Cain bore
[1:14:09] the full spiritual characteristics of
[1:14:12] Satan and the animalistic sensual
[1:14:16] fleshly characteristics of the serpent
[1:14:19] that's
[1:14:20] Cain yeah and how why people say well
[1:14:23] Cain and Abel they were twins I mean you
[1:14:26] know what's this serpentin stuff like
[1:14:28] that well I mean come on I mean why did
[1:14:30] Cain have the nature he had Abel had a
[1:14:32] totally different nature while I was
[1:14:33] Cain jealous Abel had to write sacrifice
[1:14:37] uh Bible says you know uh all there's
[1:14:40] five or six scriptures that prove Ser we
[1:14:42] believe that Satan so he says Cain bore
[1:14:45] the full spiritual characteristic of
[1:14:46] Satan and the animalistic sensual
[1:14:48] fleshly characteristics of the serpent
[1:14:51] no wonder the holy spirit said that Cain
[1:14:53] was of that Wicked one
[1:14:56] so you see Satan entered into the
[1:14:58] serpent then the serpent did Evil just
[1:15:01] like Judas at the Last Supper Satan and
[1:15:03] the Bible says and Satan entered into
[1:15:05] Judas and he went to do what he was
[1:15:06] ordained to do I've well I don't W get
[1:15:09] into that CU another Ser why did I
[1:15:11] wonder how much really uh Judas knew I
[1:15:14] mean I know he was a thief you know he
[1:15:16] probably he stole out the treasury but I
[1:15:18] wonder if he really knew he was that one
[1:15:20] that was ordained to be the deceiver but
[1:15:22] anyway yeah so we now we want to expose
[1:15:27] Cain I want to ask a question who really
[1:15:30] was Cain this is where we want to kind
[1:15:32] of tile This Together who really was
[1:15:35] Cain Cain was the first incarnate son of
[1:15:38] the devil remember Cain was was Satan's
[1:15:41] son Lucifer's son Abel was Adam's son
[1:15:44] they had twins we know the story okay
[1:15:46] Adam was the first incarnate Son of God
[1:15:49] think about it and Cain was an incarnate
[1:15:52] devil man all that back at the beginning
[1:15:56] so I you know I got to thinking
[1:15:58] okay what about Incarnation what is it
[1:16:01] what brother M say about
[1:16:03] Incarnation and like in the second seal
[1:16:05] brother B said Jesus was the Incarnate
[1:16:07] God and Judas was the Incarnate
[1:16:10] devil and a man can be an incarnate
[1:16:12] devil true then I remembered what
[1:16:15] brother B said about Elvis
[1:16:17] Presley so I got that quote brother Ben
[1:16:19] says this in book of Corinthians and
[1:16:23] then even the ministers trying to up
[1:16:25] build that kind of thing and Elvis
[1:16:26] Presley saying yeah I trust God for all
[1:16:28] my success and how would a living holy
[1:16:31] God ever give such to vulgarity and a
[1:16:34] devil demonized thing that's absolutely
[1:16:37] been one of the greatest hindrances in
[1:16:39] this nation has ever been seen is a guy
[1:16:41] like Elvis Presley who sent who sent who
[1:16:44] sent millions of souls to Hell by his
[1:16:47] old dirty filthy rock and roll stuff
[1:16:50] sent millions of souls to Hell by Dirty
[1:16:52] rock and roll stuff certainly I don't
[1:16:55] have to apologize at all if you listen
[1:16:58] to this if you can believe me to be
[1:17:00] God's Prophet remember there is an
[1:17:02] incarnated devil absolutely he said it I
[1:17:05] didn't say it I'm just reading what he
[1:17:06] said right there Elvis Presley in our
[1:17:10] day an incarnated devil yeah so then
[1:17:14] another incarnated devil in our day so I
[1:17:17] got to thinking okay what Incarnation
[1:17:21] what is it what does incarnation mean
[1:17:23] what is the definition incarnation
[1:17:24] incarnate
[1:17:26] Incarnation very very
[1:17:29] interesting he says but dictionary said
[1:17:32] to be made flesh endowed with a human
[1:17:36] form inhuman form to provide with flesh
[1:17:41] or a body to embody to give actual form
[1:17:44] to make real that's incarnate
[1:17:46] Incarnation means endowment with a human
[1:17:50] body appearance in human form any person
[1:17:54] listen this any person or animal serving
[1:17:57] as the embodiment of a God or
[1:18:01] Spirit any person or animal serving as
[1:18:04] the embodiment of a God or spirit so
[1:18:08] you're telling me so if a person serves
[1:18:11] as a house for a God or a spirit that
[1:18:14] person is the Incarnation of that God
[1:18:17] wow that's that's a definition so we see
[1:18:20] Elvis He had he he his he provided the
[1:18:24] body for Satan to get into and he was
[1:18:26] incarnate devil we understand that it
[1:18:28] was a house it was a house that Satan
[1:18:30] lived
[1:18:31] in sent millions of souls to hell
[1:18:34] because of his filthy rock and roll so I
[1:18:36] got to thinking Judas was incarnate
[1:18:38] devil Hitler was and several of them
[1:18:40] Elvis was incarnated devil so that just
[1:18:43] didn't seem right we're going to have an
[1:18:44] incarnate devil in this Earth on this
[1:18:45] generation now what about the opposite
[1:18:47] come on they got to be an opposite
[1:18:50] somewhere there must be God incarnated
[1:18:53] somewhere we got find it somewhere we'
[1:18:56] got this generation if if you got the
[1:18:58] the evil there's got to be the positive
[1:19:00] you got the negative got to be the
[1:19:02] positive right I got to lay in right
[1:19:04] here before me amen so I got to lay
[1:19:08] right here endowed with human body to
[1:19:10] take on a human body remember brother
[1:19:11] saying this generation is a generation
[1:19:14] that the word will become flesh the word
[1:19:17] will be made
[1:19:19] flesh rising of the sun brother man sees
[1:19:21] bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life
[1:19:23] of his life power of his power
[1:19:26] she is
[1:19:29] him
[1:19:31] amen can you accept
[1:19:34] that she is him I don't feel worthy she
[1:19:40] is him he declared it's more important
[1:19:44] you believe what the word declares you
[1:19:45] are than what you think you are yourself
[1:19:48] amen I'm unworthy I make mistakes my
[1:19:50] flesh is carnal many times I fall short
[1:19:52] I this I that I that forget it we're not
[1:19:55] talking about this sticky flesh said
[1:19:57] your flesh will be sticky till you get
[1:19:59] out of here we're talking about a
[1:20:00] predestinated seed we're talking about a
[1:20:02] gene of God we're talking about the very
[1:20:04] life of God what is the token what is
[1:20:06] the token the literal life of the
[1:20:08] literal the literal Life of Christ the
[1:20:10] token could only come in the evening
[1:20:12] time only come in the evening
[1:20:15] time no other time the only come in the
[1:20:18] evening time so brother B says Jesus
[1:20:23] said at that day that day is this day at
[1:20:26] that day when this Revelation is made
[1:20:28] known you will know that I in the Father
[1:20:30] the father of me I in you and you in me
[1:20:33] when the Revelation is made
[1:20:35] manifest made manifest at that day you
[1:20:39] should know that I and the father are
[1:20:42] one can you accept that I and the father
[1:20:44] are one I the father and the father of
[1:20:47] me then when the revelations comes forth
[1:20:49] and it's I and you and you and me there
[1:20:51] you are all that God was we could oh we
[1:20:54] just we can we can eat this one up all
[1:20:56] God was he poured into
[1:20:59] Christ part of what God was he poured
[1:21:01] into his bride didn't say that all that
[1:21:04] God all that Christ was he poured into
[1:21:05] his bride that's what he said can we
[1:21:09] accept
[1:21:10] [Music]
[1:21:13] that I
[1:21:15] believe now don't let this quote choke
[1:21:17] you second seal brother man said now but
[1:21:20] the age after the church goes home
[1:21:23] listen to this real closely but the age
[1:21:25] after the church goes home he becomes
[1:21:27] talk about the Antichrist he becomes a
[1:21:28] beast he becomes the devil incarnate the
[1:21:31] red dragon himself oh my can't you see
[1:21:34] what I mean he's incarnated in his
[1:21:36] people then he's got his people Bound by
[1:21:39] this power the false prophet has
[1:21:40] prophesied them right into it giving
[1:21:43] them over the strong delusions to
[1:21:44] believe a lie and be damned by it
[1:21:46] denying the word in the form of Godless
[1:21:49] but now God on the other side God works
[1:21:52] his place in a trinity jusic
[1:21:55] sanctification incarnates himself in his
[1:21:58] people with the baptism of the Holy
[1:22:04] Ghost incarnates himself in his people
[1:22:07] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:09] incarnates himself and his people with
[1:22:12] the baptism of the Holy Ghost are you
[1:22:14] able to accept the fact that now you
[1:22:17] possess that part of deity I believe it
[1:22:20] incarnates himself but if you had truly
[1:22:22] truly I'm not talking about just being
[1:22:24] Justified just being Sanctified I mean
[1:22:27] there there's many around the message
[1:22:29] you know that's just walking in
[1:22:30] Sanctified I'm talking about if you
[1:22:31] truly have had a word birth and you know
[1:22:33] you born from above the whole your very
[1:22:36] life expresses the love of God you you
[1:22:38] make mistakes sure but your whole nature
[1:22:40] desire Focus everything about you is you
[1:22:43] love God you love this message that's it
[1:22:45] you know you pass from death and life
[1:22:48] then the Incarnation of God dwells in
[1:22:50] you that's the word of God that's what
[1:22:53] the prophet of God said to me that's
[1:22:55] thus sayith the Lord amen
[1:22:58] amen God works his place in the Trinity
[1:23:01] justification sanctification and
[1:23:02] incarnate himself in his people with the
[1:23:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost the same thing
[1:23:08] the devil's just a type the devil's just
[1:23:11] a type after Christ don't you love that
[1:23:14] the devil's just a type after Christ
[1:23:17] yeah he incarnated Judas he incarnated
[1:23:19] Elvis Hitler you name it he's only a
[1:23:21] type after
[1:23:22] Christ brother man also in the second
[1:23:25] seal now what Satan now what Satan when
[1:23:28] Jesus incarnates himself in his people
[1:23:31] the very life that was in Christ is in
[1:23:34] this
[1:23:38] person oh brother I could just I can
[1:23:42] just hug that I just I love this
[1:23:45] message it's our freedom it's our life
[1:23:48] it's our
[1:23:49] deliverance it's our Escape out of here
[1:23:51] it's our ticket to get on the plane
[1:23:55] oh now listen uh how long have I been
[1:23:59] how many more minutes I
[1:24:02] got um I'm about I'm getting close this
[1:24:05] I I I read I found this and this is
[1:24:07] really good this is a commentary wrote
[1:24:10] this but he really had some
[1:24:12] understanding and I want to touch on
[1:24:14] this just for a minute and then I'm
[1:24:15] going to close it this is very very good
[1:24:17] don't quit for I
[1:24:23] do this commentator writes this I really
[1:24:26] really I really love this he said the
[1:24:28] Incarnation God did the Incarnation God
[1:24:32] did not embody merely qualities and
[1:24:36] Perfections but himself how closely must
[1:24:40] the nature of man be related to the
[1:24:43] nature of God okay God Christ
[1:24:47] okay how closely must the nature of man
[1:24:49] be related to the nature of God for God
[1:24:52] himself became incarnate in Jesus of
[1:24:54] Nazareth it was through the points of
[1:24:57] similarity now I'm not saying everything
[1:24:59] he hears is perfectly right but he's got
[1:25:01] very very good understanding here it's
[1:25:04] through these points of similarity
[1:25:05] between the nature of God and the nature
[1:25:07] of man God became man see that the
[1:25:10] Incarnation of deity in humanity became
[1:25:14] possible he said now we revolt at the
[1:25:17] Heathen idea that a Divine being a
[1:25:20] Divine being can be enshrined in wood or
[1:25:22] Idol or stone we know that's that's
[1:25:24] that's false because there are there are
[1:25:26] no Godlike
[1:25:29] faculties in that wood or stone right
[1:25:32] because there are no Godlike fa
[1:25:34] faculties through which the the radiance
[1:25:36] of divine presence can stream forth on
[1:25:39] the Kindred faculties of the worshippers
[1:25:42] who are to be illuminated by that
[1:25:44] manifestation I mean that's a lot of
[1:25:46] words there but there there there's no
[1:25:47] similarities there amen can't you can't
[1:25:50] have a god wood or stone there's no
[1:25:51] similarities there there's just nothing
[1:25:53] there
[1:25:55] if man be The Offspring of God the the
[1:25:57] Incarnation becomes rational and
[1:26:00] credible man has some good understanding
[1:26:03] there so our first nature was not
[1:26:06] compatible with God we born in sin not
[1:26:09] compatible with God but our new nature
[1:26:12] is closely related to the nature of God
[1:26:15] I mean we could take a whole message
[1:26:17] have the mind of Christ and so forth and
[1:26:18] so on our new our new Nature has Godlike
[1:26:22] faculties and characteristics
[1:26:24] we eat on the word we love what God
[1:26:26] loves we hate what God hates I mean it's
[1:26:28] just we have those Godlike
[1:26:29] characteristics our new nature is his
[1:26:32] nature what is the token the literal
[1:26:34] life of Jesus Christ his nature is now
[1:26:36] in you he became me that I might become
[1:26:40] him that's right so now we're we're
[1:26:42] seeing in our first uh nature we come in
[1:26:46] this world we have no faculties that
[1:26:49] have Godlike characteristics before we
[1:26:51] have a nature change that's why Jesus
[1:26:53] said his first doct ye must be born
[1:26:56] again amen you ain't going to enter in
[1:26:59] you got to be born again you you can't
[1:27:01] have a hog nature you got to have a lamb
[1:27:03] nature you must be born
[1:27:07] again so I say if Elvis was incarnated
[1:27:11] devil then the bride is the word made
[1:27:14] flesh Christ in Christ in you the hope
[1:27:18] of glory listen friends this is the age
[1:27:21] of deity back in flesh deity person
[1:27:24] ified in flesh as I said what is the
[1:27:26] token what is the token tell it to me
[1:27:28] the literal life of Jesus Christ back in
[1:27:31] his
[1:27:32] bride full brother man said full
[1:27:34] obedience to every word of God entitles
[1:27:37] you to the Token token full obedience
[1:27:40] that's why he said next God gives the
[1:27:42] Holy Ghost to them that obey that's
[1:27:44] right he don't give it to everybody he
[1:27:46] gives it to them that's predestinated to
[1:27:47] receive the Holy Ghost and them that
[1:27:49] obey so Jesus Christ incarnates him in
[1:27:52] his people by the baptism of the Holy
[1:27:57] Ghost how close am I five minutes
[1:28:01] 10 he you can't get anything out of
[1:28:06] him okay remember remember what I just
[1:28:10] read to you how closely must the nature
[1:28:13] of man be related to the nature of
[1:28:16] God think about that to the nature of
[1:28:19] God for God himself to become incarnate
[1:28:22] in Jesus of Nazareth for God in in God
[1:28:26] himself to be incarnate in his bride see
[1:28:29] he cannot he cannot God cannot dwell in
[1:28:31] an un see there's just so many aspects
[1:28:34] as we see right now I mean Luther he had
[1:28:38] he had a por a dip into the Holy Ghost
[1:28:40] brother say Wesley di Pentecostal is dip
[1:28:42] but now the full word is born of in
[1:28:44] station we have the full complete word
[1:28:46] of God God and we we we have come to the
[1:28:50] place of of I'm talking about real
[1:28:55] sanctification not that works is is is
[1:28:57] everything not that but God is not going
[1:28:59] to indwell a dirty vessel that's right
[1:29:02] not only just the dirtiness of the flesh
[1:29:04] we're not so much talking about that but
[1:29:06] we're talking about believing every word
[1:29:08] God is not going to dwell in people that
[1:29:09] don't believe every word that's why this
[1:29:12] is the only age that God desired this
[1:29:14] for 6,000 years that he wanted to
[1:29:16] indwell just like Satan wanted to
[1:29:18] indwell man God wanted to rewell man in
[1:29:22] this age and he's going to bring it past
[1:29:23] he has brought her to pass because the
[1:29:25] full word has been born in manifestation
[1:29:28] the bride receives a full word she's
[1:29:30] recognizing who she is she is a part of
[1:29:32] word she is a part of deity she's is
[1:29:35] Christ in you the hope of glory no other
[1:29:38] age could have been said she is that's
[1:29:39] why he said invisible Union you are now
[1:29:41] the pure spotless sinless Bride of the
[1:29:44] Lord Jesus Christ you never done it in
[1:29:46] the first place what was the first what
[1:29:48] was the first place the first place was
[1:29:50] like Adam there was no sin in him at all
[1:29:53] you never done in the first place just
[1:29:55] like Adam praise the Lord before the
[1:29:57] fall you never done it you was trapped
[1:30:00] into
[1:30:03] it
[1:30:05] Hallelujah the Incarnation what does the
[1:30:07] Incarnation of Christ show I'll close
[1:30:09] and just second it shows this it shows
[1:30:11] our souls are dear to God he
[1:30:14] condescended to humanity to show his
[1:30:16] love inside he wanted to be inside his
[1:30:18] bride the Incarnation of Christ shows
[1:30:21] the high Destiny of man Christ in you
[1:30:24] the hope of
[1:30:25] glory god in flesh walking in SHO
[1:30:28] leather being birthed into Christ we
[1:30:31] assume the nature of Jesus Christ what
[1:30:35] does the Incarnation of Christ show it
[1:30:36] shows that our souls were intended to
[1:30:38] have fellowship with God Amen God placed
[1:30:41] his germ his seed there in our souls if
[1:30:43] we're predestinated that seed of God and
[1:30:45] every seed must bring forth the kind
[1:30:47] remember he said spoke word seed every
[1:30:49] seed has a potential to bring forth what
[1:30:51] it's ordained to bring and it's going to
[1:30:53] do that it's going to do it can't do
[1:30:55] anything else you plant mustard it's
[1:30:56] going to come mustard if you plant corn
[1:30:58] it's going to come out corn I don't
[1:30:59] we're not talking about hybrid stuff
[1:31:00] we're talking about what God's original
[1:31:02] seed is it's got to bring forth that God
[1:31:05] said he's going to have mature sons in
[1:31:07] day he's going to have mature sons in
[1:31:08] this day I accept I accept how many can
[1:31:12] say I accept I accept what else is the
[1:31:16] Incarnation of Christ show Christ Lord
[1:31:19] shows human beings were distinctly
[1:31:21] marked out for his dominion and His
[1:31:23] glory we we were made in his likess in
[1:31:25] his likeness rather Paul said let this
[1:31:27] mind also be in Christ we got to start
[1:31:29] thinking like God's thinks that's right
[1:31:31] truly I mean we and we're doing it we're
[1:31:34] doing it we're doing it the bride's
[1:31:35] doing it hallelujah what else this show
[1:31:38] God is becoming Humanity shows the it
[1:31:41] shows the recoverability of Fallen
[1:31:43] Humanity hallelujah hallelujah yes God
[1:31:47] didn't throw us away he didn't throw the
[1:31:49] mold away he didn't throw the Broken
[1:31:51] Pieces away he said I'll just make it
[1:31:53] over I'll just give him a new nature
[1:31:55] I'll make I'll bring him back that's
[1:31:56] what that's why that's why Resurrection
[1:31:58] is not replacement it's bringing that up
[1:32:01] that went down we're Fallen he bring us
[1:32:03] back up it's not replacement it's
[1:32:05] Resurrection oh thank God for that he
[1:32:08] became us that we might become him he is
[1:32:11] the only way back to Total
[1:32:13] reconciliation he is our Perfection
[1:32:15] Perfection is unattainable unless God
[1:32:18] dwells in us as a music musicians come
[1:32:21] I'm going to read you two or three
[1:32:22] quotes that be okay I'm going to do it
[1:32:24] anyway thank you brother M said listen
[1:32:26] to this says men and women it's time
[1:32:29] that we found out who we are did you
[1:32:33] hear that
[1:32:35] amen men and women it's time we found
[1:32:38] out who we are but I can say to you
[1:32:40] right now the bride is recognizing who
[1:32:42] she is she is the devil's trying to hide
[1:32:45] you back tell you that you're some
[1:32:47] little old trod down something you're
[1:32:48] not you're Sons and Daughters of God the
[1:32:51] deity is not in heaven where is it it's
[1:32:54] in you amen that's right no room for
[1:32:57] Jesus instead of going church they go to
[1:32:59] the shows dances everything call
[1:33:01] themselves Christians but brother when
[1:33:03] the deity of God by the Holy Ghost comes
[1:33:05] into the human heart it calls out
[1:33:07] everything that Christ has it created
[1:33:09] Hallelujah wow Bo I like that it just
[1:33:12] calls out everything why your whole
[1:33:14] focus is Christ it's Christ everything's
[1:33:17] about Christ we have nothing to do we
[1:33:19] don't love the world we don't go with
[1:33:20] the place of the world we have nothing
[1:33:22] to do with the world we live for God
[1:33:25] brother say a man is just a man is just
[1:33:27] a man until he's fully submitted to God
[1:33:30] and then deity dwells in The Man by the
[1:33:32] Holy Spirit not man but God in the man
[1:33:35] does the work amen oh we got we got
[1:33:38] hundreds
[1:33:40] Hallelujah listen when when brother BR
[1:33:42] went beyond the curtain of time as I
[1:33:45] said earlier he saw you and he saw
[1:33:47] himself there what does that tell
[1:33:50] me another thing is really interesting
[1:33:54] when brother Brown preached the preview
[1:33:56] of the
[1:33:57] Bride tells it tells it four or five
[1:33:59] different places and you know the
[1:34:02] story he saw the early church come in
[1:34:04] preview p and reviews we talked about
[1:34:07] you know beautiful nice church then he
[1:34:10] said now we'll preview the Church of
[1:34:11] America he saw ungodly filthy
[1:34:14] half-dressed naked led by witch he said
[1:34:17] if this is the best we've done to
[1:34:18] present a bride of Christ to you he said
[1:34:20] It felt so bad and he was just like you
[1:34:22] know what can we do I just you know then
[1:34:25] he said but the bride must preview a
[1:34:28] second time then she comes marching over
[1:34:31] the hill correctly dressed marching into
[1:34:33] the tune of owner Christian
[1:34:35] Soldiers she marches up the other
[1:34:38] marches down falls
[1:34:41] down but and my point of being that God
[1:34:45] gave brother bam that vision of the
[1:34:48] preview of the Bride
[1:34:50] yeah and what he saw was the last day
[1:34:53] Church
[1:34:54] in Step marching to the word everything
[1:34:56] correctly dressed long hair etc etc he
[1:34:59] saw the Church of America led by which
[1:35:02] undressed
[1:35:04] Unholy that was that was not brother
[1:35:07] bram's idea that was God's idea of the
[1:35:10] Church of America and the bride you got
[1:35:13] to understand that was that was God gave
[1:35:15] brother that that Vision true that that
[1:35:19] was you might as say that's thus sayith
[1:35:21] the Lord that's right that was true
[1:35:23] that's God's impression God's opinion of
[1:35:26] the Le oan Church filthy half-dressed
[1:35:29] naked miserable even uh you know
[1:35:32] Revelations 3 says
[1:35:34] that it's it's that's striking but then
[1:35:38] he sees the bride preview the second
[1:35:39] time that's what God thinks about us
[1:35:42] brother sister are we
[1:35:44] blessed are we truly
[1:35:47] blessed truly blessed can you accept
