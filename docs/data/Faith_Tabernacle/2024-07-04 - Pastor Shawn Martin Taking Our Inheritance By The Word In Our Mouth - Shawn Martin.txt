Lord that you would help us to rise above the obstacles in our lives and Lord that we could just um become closer to you Lord we ask it Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen praise the Lord um the Book of Joshua the uh 14th chapter and we're going to start at the seventh verse we had read this last Wednesday I believe but it says 40 years old was I and this is Caleb speaking to [Music] Joshua and says when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh barnea to asy out the land and I brought him word again as it was in Mine Heart nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt but I holy I holy follow the Lord my God and Moses aware on that day or swear on that day saying surely the land where on thy feet have trotten shall be thine inheritance and thy children's forever because thou H has wholly followed the Lord my God and now behold the Lord hath kept me alive as he said these 40 and5 years even since the the Lord spake this word unto Moses while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo I am this day four score and 5 years old as yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war both to go out and to come in now therefore give me this mountain whereof the Lord spake in that day for thou Hast for thou heardest in that day how the uh Anakin uh were there and that the cities were great and fenced if so be the Lord will be with me then I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said amen you can have your seats this evening and um um last week we just uh uh talking about Caleb and um and I want to maybe just uh talk some more about him and maybe use the um the title taking our inheritance by the word of our mouth and Caleb was a True Believer uh he wholly follow the lord yes and he did this by believing the message of the hour that uh the prophet Moses brought un unto unto them and so uh we know that Caleb was a Believer because he showed what he was there at Kadesh Baria and and we know that Kadesh barnea was the place of judgment right and before God would allow uh uh Israel to go into the promised land and you have to remember that th this God had promised them this inheritance for for many years ahead before and and and God had moved in many miraculous ways uh uh throughout the journey even their deliverance from Egypt uh out of Egypt was a miraculous thing and so the supernatural followed them they had the pillar of fire the uh that followed them by Night Cloud by day and and these things and so uh uh but uh and there was a lot of Trials a lot of things but right before God would allow to go into the promised land he led them to Kadesh Baria a place of judgment and and this would be the the final test God would bring them to this final test and uh uh and and this would uh uh prove them and so he sent God sent 12 Spies uh into the land and Caleb and Joshua was was part of that and so when they they saw the land um and they brought evidence of the land back uh that Moses had said would be there and and and they brought it all back and and so then the these 12 Spies had to give their report and and uh uh uh as to what they saw what they heard and and as to what they thought as to what uh you know they they thought of the land and so now now this testing the prophet said God loves to put your faith uh to a test to see how you would act on it let you be anointed and prayed for and then make you worse and say come on Satan put him to the test I know he believes me bless God forever oh my see put him to the test now see I know he took my word for it and and then he asked the question can he say that about you he said that about job he said do anything you want to but don't you take his life for I know he loves me he's made the burnt offering he's made the requirements he did what I told him to do and he believes it now roll him over the coal if you want to so so God loves to put us through the test and so this test is nothing strange uh uh if God done it back then he does it today and and uh uh you know and and so uh uh brother random another place said God puts our faith to a test to see if we really believe that he is God ain't that right to really believe that he is God see where we're at with all of this see so now God never told them about the Giants in that land as far as I know he he never told them you know about the obstacles uh uh per se but when they came back uh the when the 12 Spies uh 10 of them gave their report and their report was there's Giants in the land it's we were as grasshoppers in their sight you know and we we uh uh we ourselves uh felt like we were grasshoppers you know as as grasshoppers you know and and so uh uh and and and and then the report was you know we can't make it we're not able to take that land it's it's just impossible see and so but but so so they gave an evil report and and but Joshua and Caleb uh uh well the Bible says that Caleb had a different Spirit he had another spirit which we understand that to be the spirit of God and and and he stealed the people and he gave the report that yeah yeah that may be true but look at the evidence everything that God promised us would be there is there and here it is and and so we're more than able to take the land and see so we we know now that that of course God says no they ain't going in because all the people believe the 10 spies over the uh Jos josu and Caleb and so they they all frightened and and God says all right they will not go into the promised land they they ain't going in and and of course they said oh yeah we will go in and they went in they got they got their britches beat right and and so uh uh well they they died uh God let them die in the wilderness and then when when Joshua God raised up Joshua to take a new generation over into the promised land and Caleb was with them that went over there now Joshua represented the the promised end time leader to take the church over the prophet said and Caleb represents the True Believer who followed Joshua into the land and stayed with him ain't that right amen see so Caleb amen he he passed the test he was he was the only one him and Joshua out of that two and a half million people that passed test that says I don't care about Giants I don't care about wal City I don't care about the obstacles we're more than able to take the land amen and and you find I think it's I think it's strange that that Joshua the end time leader amen and and uh uh uh Caleb the the the True Believer that would follow Joshua into the promised land at that time at Kadesh Baria when everybody else was saying no we can't do it Joshua and K CB were saying the same thing amen both of them saying the same thing which is is interesting because the prophet said in this last day listen to the authenticated prophet of God who appears in this last s and what he says from God the bride will say Amen the spirit the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing can you say Amen so Joshua and Caleb have been saying the same thing a what the spirit had been telling them all along ain't that right well so is it today amen people are walking away from the message people are talking contrary to the message amen but there is a true people of God that are saying the same thing amen that the prophet has told us you're more than able you to take the land you are more than able Amen to go through whatever you're going through and the bride will say amen I am able I I know I am able can you say amen that's right see so in our our opening scripture amen Caleb is in the land of promise now and and of course the the the promised land represented the age of the Overcomer amen see the land was theirs to possess amen it it was theirs to possess it was their inheritance but the Giants occupied the land the world cities uh uh there was obstacles in that land and so they're going to have to overcome amen every obstacle in that land if they're going to take their position you you can't they they weren't God didn't call them just to wander in the land god called them to come into that L land and place them positionally exactly where they are to be ain't that right so in that land see Caleb he had a right to lay claim he had a right to lay claim to the land amen I looked up that word lay claim it means to demand as one's property Amen to assert one's right or title to to say that you own it ain't that right so this is what Caleb was doing there's that there was a portion of land that was given to him by a prophet's word amen and now he was laying claim to that land amen not asking the enemy not asking the those that were already uh uh uh inhabiting the land would you please give give it to me oh no no no he was laying claim to that land that Land Is Mine amen you can move off whatever of course you know they weren't going to move off and so uh he had to fight them amen but see uh uh uh they they had to lay claim amen and so this is what Caleb was doing was laying claim to what rightfully belonged to him you see he had a right to lay claim to it do you believe that he had a right to lay claim to it it wasn't just something that he wanted and was wishing for God gave him that land amen that that's the thing see so if he had a right to claim it then it it made it a legal claim what he was claiming now he's not one of these squatters out here that that that takes over somebody's house and says well it's mine and yet they ain't got the title deed they ain't got nothing to that amen that's what was in Caleb see Caleb had a legal right to possess the land that belonged to him and his claim was a confession of faith God gave it to me that land is mine it's just like ours today we've got a confession of Faith healing is mine victory is mine Deliverance is mine Heaven Is Mine The Rapture is mine everything that God promised is mine because it's I'm laying claim to every promise of God that belongs to me amen it's a confession of faith and we know what a confession means it is it means to say the same thing as in other words to repeat what has already been said and when Caleb said give me my Mountain this mountain belongs to me he was only making a confession of what had already been spoken by the prophet of God can you say amen that's right see and and so therefore the prophet's word became his absolute amen that's right and so is it today this message is every true believer's absolute if God said it to that Prophet I believe it can you say amen and a True Believer we're not we're not wavering off of it we're not varying off of it I don't care how bad it gets I don't care how hot the battle becomes I don't care how strong The Temptations come I don't care if my feelings leave me and how low I feel amen God said every promise is mine amen and we're going to take we won't take the doctor's words for an absolute I ain't taking some other preacher's words for an absolute I'm taking what a prophet said amen because the prophet the word of God comes to a prophet you see you have every legal right to lay claim to everything that Jesus Christ died for do you believe that amen see now the word the word amen he believed the word that a prophet had spoke and that word he believed it from the heart amen the prophet preached the message believe from the heart amen well Caleb believe from the heart amen and that word that was in his heart now was in his mouth and he began to speak exactly what a prophet told him amen as I said last Wednesday amen the Moses wasn't there to remind Joshua amen about the promises of God that he didn't need to be there amen because Caleb had hid that word down in his heart amen I I I I think that's where we are today amen it would have been nice to have brother brandom here amen with us to remind us of the promises and all these things amen but what they the world don't understand they can burn the books they can burn the Bible they can tear the tapes they can take everything away from us but the bride has already received that word down in her heart and now it's in her mouth can you say amen amen you can't take it away from this bride yes sir now see so this is exactly what Jesus was meaning when he said in Luke 6:45 a good man out of The Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good and an evil man out of The Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil for of the bundance of the heart his mouth speaketh ain't that right so therefore this tells us that Caleb was a True Believer at heart amen he had the word not in his head not in his intellect but it had come into his heart amen and and he had gone through trials he had gone through things amen and and and it seemed like amen as as as the longer that time carried amen uh uh the older he got amen and yet he would still tell Joshua I know I'm older but I'm still as strong as I was when Moses first gave me the the word amen gave me the promise amen that's a True Believer can you say Amen see so so this Falls in line with what the scripture teaches amen uh uh because of a real believer amen 1 John 37 little children let no man deceive you he that doeth or worketh righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous the prophet says that what that means is what a man does he is can you say amen amen what a man does he is amen I know there was a me to and half Millions following amen the message of that hour and they had seen all the signs and all the Wonders and they had partook of many things amen but at that testing time amen they failed amen they showed their colors they showed exactly what they were the prophet said they were unbelievers ain't that right but here was a man had gone to the test had gone to the tries had seen the same Giants that they saw had seen the same old cities that they saw amen but he had the word in his heart and therefore he would not let negative come into his mouth he would not let doubt come into his mouth because doubt wasn't in his heart amen Faith was in his heart belief was in his heart amen and his mouth expressed what was really there amen he was a True Believer James 3:11 do a fountain send forth at the same place Sweet Water and bitter see you can't do it see brother brandom said to say something amen that is not in your heart shows you're a hypocrite amen a hypocrite you can you can say something and if it's not in the heart it's a sign of a hypocrite but Caleb was no hypocrite can you say amen amen see so Romans 62 how shall we s how shall we that that are dead to sin live any longer therein amen see so a man is changed amen and shows what he is but as we said the 10 spies were Believers amen so therefore they gave the negative report to the people amen because that's the only thing they could think about that's the only thing they could see amen yeah they saw the they they saw the evidence amen but but but the the the the negative was was Far overwhelming for them to believe in the evidence that God had for them amen see and so they saw the Giants that's all they could think about they that's all they could think about is the world cities all they could think about was the the negative the impossibilities and they couldn't get over it no matter what God had done they couldn't get over it you understand what I'm saying church it's time we got to over things amen and look at the promise of God Amen for what it is amen get over things amen see so they only saw the negative they only thought about the negative they only talked about the negative amen they only they they only live the negative amen see and so Paul would tell us that they had an evil heart of unbelief can you say Amen so what they were is they were anointed to disbelief amen anointed to disbelief amen that's what the prophet said see so now but we we as the bride of Christ how many believe you're the bride of Christ you believe you're the bride of Christ well then then what what what that means is you're anointed to defeat the enemy you're anointed to defeat the enemy that's that that should be all that comes in your mind is you're anointed to defeat the enemy that should be all that comes into your heart I'm anointed to defeat the enemy don't look at the obstacles don't let Church you surely we've lived long enough to know that there's going to be obstacles amen you've seen them come you've seen them go there's going to be more and they're going to go just as well amen but the thing is going to stay is the word of God we've got to have the word of God to keep us anchored in the time of TR Tres can you say Amen yes sir see and so we've been ordained we must not think about the enemy we've been ordained to defeat the enemy don't look at the size of the enemy don't look at the impossibility of the enemy don't look at the Warfare that you're going through don't look at the struggles you're going through don't let listen to the devil tell you that you'll never be a part of this bride and that you'll never overcome and and it's impossible for you to get your joy don't look at that you're ordained to defeat defeat the enemy yes you are you're you're ordained can you say Amen so we're going to have to defeat the enemy now it's not an option it's a must we're going to have to defeat our enemy if we're going to come and be positionally placed in the in our inheritance that means for our enemy amen it's not flesh and blood the Bible says we wrestle not against flesh and blood amen so you're not wrestling against uh uh uh uh uh your neighor you're not wrestling against uh the the grer you're not wrestling against your employer uh uh the preacher the the Deacon the song what what you're not wrestling against that see but what you must conquer is you must conquer fear everybody say fear I must conquer fear you must conquer worry you must conquer anxiety you must conquer bitterness you must conquer unbelief you must conquer hard feelings you must conquer that old lust you must conquer self-will and and and let's put it the way the prophet said you are your biggest enemy amen you're your biggest enemy you've got to conquer complexes you've got to conquer things in your life it's you that's got to conquer yourself can you say amen amen that's right and we must do it if we're going to find our position in the land can you say Amen yes sir now we all know that it's going to take something greater than than us amen that's right for we're no match for the devil amen just like Caleb amen they might have thought he was just off the wall to say that we're able and maybe they try to look at him say now come on man you saw these 10 foot Giants and here you are 5 feet you know and you you saw the I mean come on the ratio here you know the D I mean and then you say we're able but Caleb was not looking unto himself Caleb was no match for that enemy he was no match see but you see God never intended for us to face our enemy alone don't you try amen to go Toe to Toe with the devil on your own you ain't going to make it right can you say Amen but notice in John 20:21 Jesus said as my father has sent me so send I you as my father sent me so send I you and how did the father send him by going with him and being in him amen that's right and the same way the father sent Christ Christ sends us now we understand Christ in you the hope of glory Christ in you can you say amen that's right amen John I believe in John it says greater is he that is in you

before Satan ever gets to it done told it what is it God dressed up in his church these offices is God's dress wear when you see those offices pastors teachers evangelists what is that that's God's dress wear God's presence God's spirit working through man and if that office denies any of this word then it's not God's dressing see amen that's right no that's that wolf in sheep's clothing watch that fella be aware of him but when he just takes what the word says remember that's God because he speaking his word but if he says well oh see it isn't see he says oh oh oh you better get away

disciples come stole him away yes they didn't believe it see they seen that and and God says now wait a minute I'm going to come and be in it myself I'm going to meet my enemy in my church and I'm going going to beat him on his own Ground God didn't leave you here Amen to to fall in in in despair God didn't leave you here just to leave you wasted God ordained you here so he could defeat his enemy in you he made you part of his church to defeat his enemy he oh God if you just in the Rapture Rapture Rapture Rapture Rapture what about God defeating his en enemy in you today that's right can you say amen I thank God for a Rapture we're looking for a Rapture but until that time com don't you give your body to the devil don't you give your mind to the devil don't you give your your actions and your energy and everything that you are to the devil let God take you and let him defeat his enemy through you yes sir how in the world's are young people going to make it amen in this evil age of pornography and the filthiness and the the the oh ungodliness they're going to make it because greater is he that is in them than he that is in this world abely you believe it yes sir see he said so he did that once you know what he did he took Moses and set him right under the enemy's nose let the enemy feed him and raise him up right like that went down and defeated the enemy and sunk him in the bottom of the Dead Sea sure he is see he said to think that old all old infinite God what we got to worry about church what do you have to worry about what do we have to worry about why why do we worry about tomorrow why do we worry about the future I understand the world's in in an unrest we don't know what this election's going to be we don't know what's going to happen in the next 6 months and we don't know what's going to happen tomorrow anything could take place Anything Can Happen church but what do we have to worry about amen thank you yes sir he said he's God everybody say he's God say that again he's God he's God just go ahead and believe him amen that's right see that that's how different Caleb was to the 10 spies amen they were worrying Caleb was not worrying he just knew God was God and he simply took God at his word and believed him Hallelujah and you say Amen sir so he said see so he said what he would do he said he would come and vindicate himself in his church and they would vindicate his resurrection by his works oh my I'm so glad for that amen see so I'm just going to skip some down here but he said see uh uh uh if if this Holy Spirit that's here today if it isn't the same word that it was in the beginning he said if it is will do the same works that's the reason Jesus said he that believeth in me in me the works that I do shall he do also there's not one time that Satan was able to trip Jesus up and defeat Jesus and to leave him to where he did not fulfill scripture that's right brother exactly and he that believeth in him the same work shall he do amen yes sir he'll stand absolutely he'll Triumph he'll overcome that's good brother can you say Amen yes sir he's going to overcome amen why it's the same word the same Works cuz Jesus was God's works that we know that and Matthew 28 says I'll be with my Army not only that I'm going in my Army think of it think of it see our great warrior great Triumph word General in us the word General in us the word who was made flesh and triumphed over every devil every sickness every death every hell and the grave that same general is in us with us for how long till the end of the world right on down think of it the one that's leading the battle every Power of the enemy defeated when he was here on Earth he took the word and triumphed over everything that Satan had he triumphed over death triumphed over hell triumphed over the grave he rose up on the third day he's come back and now living in his church this great Word War Warrior the warrior that was the word and that same Warrior that is the word is in us living himself punctuating every sign of his resurrection and his coming and he's doing it today in this evening time when is when the great evening Tim lights are beginning to shine can you say Amen now notice what the prophet said in another place he said God can only help you as your faith will permit him to operate in you see you don't have to try to figure things out just believe God you don't have to have all the answers just believe God you don't know how you're going to do it just believe God can you say Amen if you if you go if you let Satan take you to reasoning you're going to try to figure it all out you're going to try to get it and connect all the dots you don't have to connect the dots let God connect the dots in your life can you say Amen he'll take you from point A to point B from point B to point Z he take you from a vagabond to a royalty he'll take you from a slum amen and put you on the throne you don't have to figure it out let God do it let God do it and as you can let your faith is he can only help you as you let your face operate can you say Amen yes sir now Caleb knew Caleb knew he was going to he was going to be victorious he knew that that mountain belonged to him he knew it believed it well then what what did he base his victory upon he knew he was going to come to Victory he knew then Giants were going to fall before him he knew whatever wal city was in his way he'd take care of it amen it would it would fall amen but what did he base his victory upon God's word God's word you got to the only way you can base your Victory on is God's word the only way you can base your deliverance on is is God's word the only way you can base your salvation up on is God's word the only way you can base your body change on is God's word you understand what I'm saying amen we may not be the smartest children on people on the Block but that doesn't matter as long as we are believers Believers from the heart to where the devil cannot take it from us and let it now start speaking I am a child of the king I am going to make it I am going to live I am healed I am going in a Rapture I am a Christian I am a believer I am a member of this bride that's what God wants you to do and if God is in you he'll speak it through you it's God speaking and you say amen hallelujah see so Caleb had something to base his victory upon and that was God's word and his confession lined up with what God Said ain't that right so how could he maintain his confession amen it's easy when on the mountain top it's easy when you ain't got troubles it's easy when things ain't around you amen that you can oh yeah I love God and oh yes God is for me well well what makes you say well I got money in the bank I got a nice car I got a nice house everything's going good for me I'm going to Hawaii next week and and yada yada yada you know well well that's easy that's easy but you face them Johns like Caleb did you face the opposition like Caleb did amen you face things that you don't know how it's going to how it's going to work out like Caleb did amen see but the because the word was in his heart amen his confession remained the same come on now right he wholly followed the Lord yes so he didn't defeat the enemy on his own strength can you say Amen right his faith in God is what got him the victory remember 1 John 5:4 it says this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith even our faith so what is Faith it's our Victory faith is the victory over every situation there's there are several of us here tonight we've all got different Lifestyles all got different challenges in life but faith is the victory for every one of us no matter what you're facing brother Bill no no no matter what you're facing Faith no matter what you're facing brother Matthew faith is your Victory faith is your Victory faith is your Victory faith is your Victory faith is our Victory faith is the victory for this church Faith is the victory for this preacher faith is the victory for every song leader every musician faith is the victory for everyone in this building right now Faith is your Victory no politician going to get you Victory faith will get you Victory H can you say amen hallelujah so so see so Caleb had faith in what the word said he was he had faith in what the word said he would do so he was already speaking it before it ever happened right true I I'll conquer that mountain on what he says you are the word of God said so well how do you know it's the word because it come from a Vindicated Prophet yeah praise God I know people don't like to think about this message being the absolute and that's fine moses' message wasn't the the the 10 spies absolute either on come on hello that's right and look where they ended up at so if you don't want it for your absolute that's okay but a prophet God sent a prophet to Give Me Faith an absolute can you say Amen right yes sir yes sir so how did Jesus overcome the world well you know brother Bram said Jesus had faith in the word of God that said what he was yeah that's exactly right he had faith do you realize the prophets were his absolute amen the prophet's words was his absolute that's right that's why he said went destroy this this Temple and within three days I'll raise it up again Prophet said he had only one promise one scripture to base that statement upon that was in Psalms yes I'll not see my a holy one to see corruption or or uh suffer my Holy One to seek corruption or leave is SE in hell and Jesus knew that that uh uh corruption would he he would have to rise within that three days before corruption could set in amen that's right that became his absolute surely and he began to confess it amen yes sir that's right Prophet said he he he had faith in the word that's why it go it is written of me it is written of me it's written of me that's right amen he wasn't here to preach a new doctrine he was here to manifest what a prophet said about him sir and you say amen and Caleb knew the time had come for him to manifest exactly what the prophet said he would do yes praise the Lord hallelujah that's right so the prophet said he knew with that perfect Fai speaking of Jesus that he was the anointed Messiah he knew that he was the son of God without any Shadow of Doubt now you know they try to discourage him they try to tell him he wasn't they said you know he was illegitimate born he was this and he was that the church was against him politics was against him the world was against him even his own Mama denied it amen the testimony all of these things but Jesus beyond the shadow of a doubt knew he was the son of God what faith that's right see the word said he was so you've got to be Anointed with faith to believe you know that's why the prophet said you've got to be Anointed with faith to believe amen that's right and he said a Believer is the faith of God that moves in you everybody say it's the faith of God that moves in me we all know about what the faith of God does it created a world it spoke things into existence that were not and yet it it was as though it was he knew the end from the beginning and by faith he spoke you he called you chose you Justified you glorified you that's what the faith of God does God was so sure of his faith of his word he know you're going to make it come on now that's right now the prophet said see if the church can only get anointed Anointed with real Faith see speaking of Samson he said when that lion roared I guess Samson shook but the spirit of the Lord come upon him he was persistent and he looked at that line and said I'm ready to meet you come on now oh my are you are you ready to meet your enemy are you ready to meet him head on are we going to go in our closet and hide are we going to quit are we going to go out in the woods and be a Hermit no we're going to stand and face the enemy I'm ready to meet you he grabbed that line and pulled him apart and throw him over to one side and just kept walking on praise the Lord I think that's what we're doing in this hour we're just taking every demon ripping them apart and moving on why we are anointed to defeat this enemy hallu God is with us God is with us you see there is no way absolutely no way that you can overcome with unbelief you say oh God I want to overcome help me to overcome well I don't think I can do it you got unbelief amen get rid of that unbelief cuz you'll never go forward in God with unbelief too many Giants too many things too many obstacles you're going to go by your feelings you ain't going to overcome amen Faith Can't rest in feelings feelings come and go yeah they do Sensations come and go amen ain't that right come on now so there's absolutely no way to overcome with unbelief do you realize that unbelief gives power to the devil to do what he wants to do with you that's exactly right unbelief look look at the first look look look at what happened in the Garden of Eden Satan was powerless he was totally defeated he could not do nothing but when unbelief came in it gave open the door for Satan to come in and do what he's done in the world today yes sir can you say Amen but see God could not give a a a a bring a new Earth a new Heaven and a new Earth all of these things as long as unbelief is in the people's hearts hello that's right so he brings a message in this hour the prophet of Malachi 4 to turn our hearts back restore us back to a perfect [Music] Faith come on now hello so it gives the devil unbelief gives the power it it opens the gate to to demonic Powers yes it does unbelief produces doubts and fears it does brother BR said it'll produce sickness and disaster yes sir so you you cannot defeat the enemy when you're empowering the enemy that's right good well well said well said yeah yeah you say well I'm I'm going to defeat you Satan well the only weapon you've got is the word of God Amen and and and Satan's job is to get you to doubt your weapon yes sir yes sir that's exactly right ain't that right and when you throw down your weapon when you doubt your weapon when you doubt the word of God he's got you amen he does and you've empowered him over your life exactly amen true help us God so the prophet said see unbelief Robs a man of every blessing that God has promised him it sends the unbeliever to hell that's right it doesn't hinder God cuz God's going to fulfill his word amen sure ain't that right but it hinders the unbeliever it hinders the man that's got the unbelief yeah of course that's right see and so then then we find the Bible tells us that the unbeliever dies the unbeliever dies in the Old Testament as we all know the unbelievers they perished in the wilderness they had seen they had tested the the promises of God the realities of God they had seen the Supernatural and yet they disbelieved ain't that right they disbelieved and they perished you look at since the Garden of Eden amen uh uh uh creation man has been given the choice between life and death life and death that's that's the choices and so God gave Adam and Eve life and death he he placed in the garden uh uh in the midst of the garden a tree of knowledge which was the tree of death placed there tree of life he told him you can eat of any other trees but don't you touch this tree of knowledge it's a tree of death the day you eat thereof you die so they had the choice so basically their choice was is to live by the word of God and they lived stay with the word of God believe the word of God and they lived doubt the word of God and and we know what doubt done when Eve doubted the word of God she partook of the tree of knowledge and she died on yes sir death set in ain't that right so it's always been the the choice of life and death amen uh uh in Jeremiah 218 go says behold I set before you the way of life and the way of death so to believe the word of God is to live to doubt the word of God is to die amen God sent his word to the people so that they could live amen believe it and live that that's the that's the thing you got to do believe everybody say believe and live believe and live ain't that right yes sir see and so he sent his word how did he send his word by the prophets ain't that right the Lord and then so they sounded forth the word of God thus sayi the Lord thus sayi the Lord right and then God would allow Satan to come and utter his voice of knowledge yeah his scientific his wisdom his reasoning amen and then the people has always had a choice believe God or and live or accept what Satan is saying and die it's it's just that way ain't that right now we're not just talking about a natural death we're talking about a spiritual death yes sir amen so this is exactly what happened to every unbeliever at Kadesh barnea they judged the obstacles to be greater than God's promised word they judged the impossibilities to be greater than the evidence that God showed them of the land and because because they doubted God's word they died brother Braham said eternally eternally separated ain't that right so they died spiritually that's what death is the separation so Jude 11 woe unto them for they have gone in the way of Cain and ran greedily after the heir of balam for reward and perished in the gainsaying of Kora amen uh Hebrews 3:16 for some when they had heard did provoke how be it not all that came out of Egypt by Moses see uh but with whom was he grieved 40 years was it not with them that had Sinn whose carc carcasses fell in the wilderness and to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believ not see so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief now notice what the prophet said physical death amen is the uniting of mother Eve and Satan together by disbelieving God's word they United and brought in the product of death see death is a product of uniting Satan and Eve together Eve had the word Satan is against the word and look almost 99 and 99 H hundredths of it see Satan admitted was right so close the Bible said in the last day would deceive the very elective possible see how it comes in how it's always been how it's going out the same way United of unbelief in all the full word of God you got it that's what brought death is uniting unbelief with the word unbelief just a little bitty part of it little bitty teeny bit 100th of 1% but it must be 100% yes believe God's word yes sir believe God's word you love the Lord God believe him Hallelujah that's what we are we're Believers there's going to be a Rapture because there's Believers on the earth amen there's going to be a body change because there's Believers on the earth somebody that's going to take God at his word regardless yes sir if you you notice Jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God ain't that right and Caleb lived by that word and it sustained him and he was able when every one of them died off he was there to go into that promised land and defeat the enemy just the way the word said he would and so are we hallelujah amen do you believe it we are defeating this enemy just the way the word said it it's written brother BR said you cannot fail it's written prise God it's written can you say amen amen and because he lived by that word that word sustained him notice he said I'm just as strong as as I was now I'm just as strong now as I was the years before back when Moses first gave me the word it sustained him his faith was still alive just like Abraham God gave him the word and 25 years it took but the Bible says he got stronger in faith that word sustained him we're not we're not regressing this bride's not regressing true brother not the True Believer that's right amen the True Believer ain't defeated brother I know it's getting more evil out there but that don't mean that we're we're getting more weaker that's right it it doesn't mean that we're not going to overcome blessed be his it's already been written we'll overcome Hallelujah to God you believe it amen now notice brother Braham said God's daughter the church the bride is also a product of God and his word United that's what you're a product of God's God and His word uniting produce the bride praise the Lord the holy spirit uniting in a body of Flesh It produced the son of God a product of the righteousness of God and in the last days as we're told as it was in the days of Sodom the bride will be United by the word of God made manifest In the Flesh the Holy Spirit sealing them into God and Sealing unbelief out amen praise God unbelief is on the outside but down in that Soul it's already sealed up Satan cannot touch you glory to Goden Hallelujah so we're not a product of unbelief can you say Amen yes you know thinking of Satan's Eden you know Satan's Eden is not built upon Faith the prophet said this he says see by unbelief in all of God's word has brought the seed of unholiness in Satan's Eden that's exactly what unbelief does unbelief in God's word brings uh uh the seed of unholiness in Satan's zeden now if unbelief will do that think of what faith will do yeah it'll bring forth the manifestation of sons of God it'll bring forth a Victorious Church a Triumph Hallelujah he said now we are now entering in where Satan is taken the throne as the Antichrist in an Eden of this Earth an Eden of sin perverted religion he started not upon I am Satan I'm the great Angel no not upon that but upon perverting God's word and that's how he's brought his kingdom in every age and now in this great deceitful age ready to take is thrown by his people he has built himself an intellectual educated scientific Eden right scientific preachers scientific Church scientific theology everything is scientific everything is based on the basis of knowledge the whole church caral church is built upon knowledge it is not built upon faith and Satan is spraying his unbelief by H breing His science his knowledge until what it was at the beginning when God put Adam and Eve in the garden that beautiful paradise without death without sickness without sorrow and everything perfect in order look what Satan's DDT has done she is in chaos there's nothing left in it yes you you can't depend on anything to bring you to victory nothing it's all death that's right brother chaos turmoil yeah yes sir hello yeah that's right and people in this evil age of of Satan's Eden is dominated brother R said they're dominated by spirits of the enemy which make them to disbelief that's right there is something that's causing the people to disbelief they can't see it hello come on now that's right see so then what it does it causes them to question God's word God says he's our healer and the people will question it God says you know he's the way maker and the people question it when do they question it when everything is going good when they're in health no when things are going bad when the sickness is there when the trouble is there hello come on now Jesus says he's the same yesterday today and forever and the people qu what brings the questions they are anointed with unbelief that's right anointed to disbelief oh my can you say amen and the prophet said Satan always everybody say Satan always nothing of God nothing Satan always puts a question mark across God's word amen he does ain't that right and brother said if he can do that to you then he's got you he's got you question in this word I I mean from ker to kiver if he's got you question one little ounce of that word he's got you ain't that right see but once you another place when you once break through that veil of unbelief then you've got the keys in your hands of death hell and the grave because you've got a conqueror who conquered for you then you've got Hebrew 138 that tells us Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen when you break through the trail the veil of unbelief you see Christ for what he is a conqueror Victorious Overcomer triumphant and he's in you he's in you you love him he wonderful if the musicians will come if you notice in the Book of Revelations John sees Christ standing in the midst of the church that's right there's one thing that he says to John fear not amen fear not why his presence is there he's alive he's got the keys of death Hell In The Grave he stands there is triumphant fear not yes think of that church what do you got to fear brother Braham says and he tells John Don't Fear John Don't Fear Little Flock all that I am you are a too that's right all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours as I stand in your midst I have not come to bring fear and failure think of that he's not come to bring fear and failure I pray the Lord really gets that in our hearts yes why did he come and give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost for not to bring fear and failure that's right amen then where is this fear of failure at where is this fear of not making it where is all that coming from it's coming from your enemy but he ain't come to do that he said I've not come to bring fear and failure but love and courage and ability think of that love courage and ability yes [Music] all power is given unto me and it is yours to use you speak the word and I'll perform it that is my Covenant and it can never fail and you know what a prophet says the the word has never failed in the mouth of believing children praise God the word has never failed in the mouth of God's elect cuz you speak it and
