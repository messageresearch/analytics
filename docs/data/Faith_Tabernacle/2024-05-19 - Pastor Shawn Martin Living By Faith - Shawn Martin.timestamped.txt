[49:37] forward to a a wonderful time amen uh
[49:42] Romans the first chapter and
[49:47] um I want to start at the 16th
[49:51] verse Paul saying here for I am not
[49:54] ashamed of the gospel of Christ
[49:57] for it is the power of God un salvation
[49:59] to everyone that believeth to the Jew
[50:02] first and also to the Greek for therein
[50:05] is the righteousness of God revealed
[50:08] from Faith to Faith as it is written the
[50:11] just shall live by faith can you say
[50:15] that with me the just shall live by
[50:18] faith let's just bow our heads talk to
[50:21] the Lord
[50:23] father you're the one who wrote this
[50:26] word word it's your word father
[50:29] and it will forever
[50:32] endure but father our carnal
[50:36] mind can't fathom Lord the true meaning
[50:40] of it even though we could read it with
[50:42] our natural eyes that it would take you
[50:45] to reveal it and I pray that you would
[50:48] do so
[50:49] today father that the word could come
[50:53] off the pages and be so so lit in our
[50:57] hearts to where it it takes on flesh our
[51:03] flesh father we don't want to just to
[51:05] waste time here and we certainly don't
[51:07] want to waste your
[51:09] time but Lord as we
[51:13] now prepare our hearts just to hear your
[51:16] word we pray Lord that you would help us
[51:19] yield ourselves to you help me Lord just
[51:22] to get myself out of the way and that
[51:25] you would speak through the these mortal
[51:27] lips father to your people and Lord may
[51:30] we all just uh draw closer to you father
[51:34] and when we leave this place we had
[51:37] known that we had met with you may we
[51:40] always cherish these times we ask it in
[51:44] Jesus Christ's name and the church says
[51:48] amen amen and amen you can have your
[51:51] seats this
[51:53] morning last Sunday I had talked about
[51:58] uh raising our
[52:00] children by faith I use that title and I
[52:05] guess today would be a sequel to that uh
[52:08] but I'm going to use the the title
[52:10] living by
[52:12] faith and
[52:14] um you know um as
[52:19] Believers we are we are different from
[52:23] the rest of the
[52:24] world and uh that that also includes the
[52:27] religious world Amen and it's not that
[52:30] we tried to be different it's just God
[52:32] made us different and and um I I know
[52:38] that there is the foolish Virgin uh that
[52:42] is uh you know uh there and
[52:46] and uh as we know that the foolish
[52:49] virgin is made up of the same material
[52:52] as the bride of Christ we know that she
[52:55] is clean she is ho
[52:57] holy um and and these things but she is
[53:01] the remnant of the the
[53:04] material that goes to make the bride
[53:07] yeah um and brother Brandon talked of
[53:11] that of
[53:12] how um that that you know the seamstress
[53:16] You Know She lays out her patter uh the
[53:19] the
[53:19] material and then she selects a certain
[53:23] place in that material and then She lays
[53:27] her pattern out of the dress she wants
[53:29] to make or whatever and then she begins
[53:32] to cut that that pattern that that
[53:35] material according to the
[53:38] pattern and when she gets it cut then
[53:41] there's that remaining part it's still
[53:43] the same
[53:44] material but it's uh set aside because
[53:49] for another time as the prophet would
[53:51] say because uh she's working on the the
[53:55] material that that she's cut out is what
[53:58] she's working on now to fit the pattern
[54:03] and so uh we we know that the wise
[54:06] virgin is is the the one that has been
[54:12] cut out to fit the pattern she's the one
[54:15] that God is working with now and uh as
[54:19] we know the foolish virgin will have to
[54:21] go through the
[54:22] tribulation uh because she has rejected
[54:26] the atonement in its fullness and so she
[54:29] didn't have the faith to go all the way
[54:33] uh there but as the bride of
[54:36] Christ uh uh there is a faith that is
[54:41] not found in any other uh uh uh group of
[54:46] people uh and so we we walk by faith and
[54:50] not by sight everything that we do uh is
[54:55] by faith we are to to walk by faith and
[54:58] if we are to walk by faith then
[55:00] everything that we do must be by faith
[55:03] we sing by faith we worship by faith we
[55:07] pray by faith we preach by faith we we
[55:12] uh uh make confession on the Promises of
[55:15] God by faith uh we we make our choices
[55:19] by faith or uh uh anyone from from you
[55:23] young people to to the eldest uh any any
[55:26] decision that you make it must be by
[55:29] faith uh uh uh there and and then when
[55:33] we fall as as we know that we you will
[55:36] fall you make mistakes but by faith you
[55:39] get back up and and you keep pressing on
[55:42] by faith it's everything about the the
[55:46] Christian Life or I would say the
[55:48] bride's life is is faith we we walk by
[55:53] faith and so we we don't do any of these
[55:56] things preach sing worship um uh uh live
[56:01] moral life what whatever we we don't do
[56:03] these things by a Creed or a Dogma we
[56:06] don't do it by a set of rules it's it's
[56:10] simply by faith that we do these things
[56:13] and so then then as parenting as well we
[56:16] raise our children by faith it
[56:19] everything about our lives is is by
[56:22] faith and so any individual who walks by
[56:25] faith
[56:26] is considered to to be absolutely crazy
[56:30] uh uh uh to in in the eyes of the world
[56:34] and and that's because uh the believer
[56:36] doesn't walk by sight nor does he go by
[56:39] his own intuition he he doesn't go by
[56:43] what he thinks and he doesn't go by his
[56:46] feelings or uh his Sensations or
[56:49] anything like that he just simply walks
[56:52] by faith and and and you'll find the the
[56:56] the more you you become dependent upon
[56:59] faith and you you simply walk by faith
[57:02] then you become so strange to to the
[57:05] world but but he is he is what God calls
[57:09] a Believer uh believers do not consider
[57:13] anything that's negative to what they
[57:16] are confessing in in their confession
[57:19] and and the Believers have a positive
[57:22] confession they have a positive outlook
[57:26] have a positive that's that's what it
[57:28] means by walking by faith and and not
[57:31] because we're we're strong mentally or
[57:34] we're strong uh uh whatever and so we
[57:37] have this uh uh will to endure it it has
[57:40] nothing to do with that it's simply
[57:42] because there's a faith within the
[57:44] believer that that he sees something
[57:48] different than what the world sees uh he
[57:51] his Outlook is totally different and so
[57:54] now one might consider the the believer
[57:57] to be gullible and and easily deceived
[58:00] uh uh Etc but that's not the case at all
[58:04] in fact a a Believer is actually more
[58:08] sound than anyone else in the world a a
[58:12] Believer his life is more sound his his
[58:15] testimony is more sound his confession
[58:18] is more sound e everything about him is
[58:21] more sound because he he doesn't build
[58:24] his life up on shifting Sands he's he's
[58:28] not built his testimony uh uh on
[58:32] emotions and Sensations and how he feels
[58:35] and and all of these things we as
[58:38] believers do not build our hope uh uh
[58:41] upon things that that that just come and
[58:44] go and and all these things so the
[58:47] believer doesn't pay any attention to
[58:49] the negative that's within him or around
[58:53] him and and all of us tonight or today
[58:56] there there are plenty of negative
[58:58] things about our life and and if God
[59:01] would would put a microscope on our
[59:03] lives and and magnify it we'd all be
[59:06] ashamed and embarrassed and and these
[59:08] things because we all deal with
[59:10] negatives in our life but as Believers
[59:13] we do not look at the negatives whether
[59:16] it's in our lives or the negative that
[59:18] is surrounding us amen and and so it's
[59:22] not that we we uh um uh deny the
[59:27] negative uh uh because we can all
[59:29] readily agree that there is negative uh
[59:33] and this is what the devil uses against
[59:35] us is the negatives of our lives and and
[59:39] so we're very much well aware of of
[59:43] negativity uh around us in us a part of
[59:47] us and and all these things and so we we
[59:51] we do as Believers acknowledge it to a
[59:54] degree that it is the there and this is
[59:57] what keeps us um uh humble this is what
[1:00:00] keeps us uh uh persevering and not
[1:00:03] becoming complacent and and and these
[1:00:06] things but a a Believer doesn't let the
[1:00:09] negative dictate his confession amen uh
[1:00:13] he doesn't let the neg negative in his
[1:00:16] life around him dictate his worship the
[1:00:20] way he worships and and how he worships
[1:00:23] and and and these things the negative
[1:00:26] doesn't change the believer in how he
[1:00:28] views the promises of God can you say
[1:00:31] say Amen see it's the believer that is
[1:00:34] as Paul would say grounded settled
[1:00:36] steadfast unmovable because he has faith
[1:00:42] not because he has willpower he has
[1:00:45] Faith Can you say amen and and you could
[1:00:48] be the most weakest uh individual and
[1:00:51] and and and look like in a pushover but
[1:00:53] if you ever have faith then Satan will
[1:00:57] never be able to push you around and
[1:01:01] dictate you uh uh because uh faith is
[1:01:05] stronger than Satan and and his his his
[1:01:08] power or anything like that and and so
[1:01:11] uh um as Paul would say that that as the
[1:01:15] believer we apprehending that for which
[1:01:19] I have been apprehended for or of Jesus
[1:01:23] Christ amen we we're we're we're
[1:01:26] constantly apprehending we're another
[1:01:29] place Paul would say reaching for to
[1:01:32] those things uh which are before I I I
[1:01:36] press I I I press toward the mark of the
[1:01:39] High Calling Not Looking Back not
[1:01:41] considering so there's things about a
[1:01:44] Christian's life that yes he is Mortal
[1:01:47] yes he is human yes he has mistakes yes
[1:01:50] he has challenges yes he has battles and
[1:01:53] yes he goes through tests and trials but
[1:01:56] he never looks at those things he's
[1:01:59] there because of Faith he lives by faith
[1:02:04] amen and so uh um uh the faith that we
[1:02:08] live by is of course the faith of God
[1:02:11] this is what Jesus told us have have
[1:02:13] faith in God and and as we know that
[1:02:16] that is is interpreted in Greek as have
[1:02:19] the faith of God Amen so this is God's
[1:02:22] own faith that makes a Believer to POS
[1:02:26] to be a believer uh is to possess God's
[1:02:29] own faith not just a faith but God's Own
[1:02:33] Faith amen and and and so by faith God
[1:02:37] created the world as we know in other
[1:02:39] words he he he saw the world he saw
[1:02:43] think of that he saw the world before he
[1:02:46] ever created it he saw the world in
[1:02:49] existence he saw what he wanted and what
[1:02:52] he was after before he even created amen
[1:02:55] see it was because he had Faith ain't
[1:02:59] that right amen and also by faith God
[1:03:02] saw a lamb a man uh slain for the
[1:03:06] Redemption of man before the foundation
[1:03:09] of the world and that was by faith he he
[1:03:12] could actually see it and he decreed it
[1:03:14] to be so amen see he done this by faith
[1:03:18] so when when Adam fell in sin and it and
[1:03:21] it looked like it was so contrary I mean
[1:03:24] the holy image of God them uh he fell
[1:03:27] from his his rightful place uh he become
[1:03:30] perverted in his mind he he become
[1:03:33] carnal in his mind he become an enemy
[1:03:35] against uh to God and and and never now
[1:03:38] now his understanding of God Amen was
[1:03:41] was now diminished and and he acted like
[1:03:45] a a beast and uh just a brute beast and
[1:03:48] and and these things uh because brother
[1:03:50] brah says a man without the Holy Ghost
[1:03:52] is nothing more than just a brute Beast
[1:03:54] so so he fa and what a condition he fell
[1:03:57] and and now we're seeing in this day
[1:04:00] just how Fallen he really became and and
[1:04:03] and who who would think that man would
[1:04:06] be the way they are today but that never
[1:04:08] moved God it it never moved God because
[1:04:11] God by faith saw uh uh all the way to
[1:04:15] the end and he had declared what man was
[1:04:18] to be can you say Amen so so God never
[1:04:21] moved he had Faith amen so the
[1:04:24] conditions of man never there ever
[1:04:26] wavered the when he called Israel and
[1:04:28] ordained Israel amen and and called them
[1:04:31] to be his his people and they they up
[1:04:34] and down up and down up and down they
[1:04:37] they they they had you know he would
[1:04:40] bring them back in line and then they'd
[1:04:42] backslide then he'd bring them back and
[1:04:43] he had they' backslide they'd go into
[1:04:45] that captivity he'd bring them out and
[1:04:47] they'd go right back in and he you know
[1:04:50] and and he would tell them you know only
[1:04:51] serve one God then they found out they
[1:04:54] you know then the next thing they're
[1:04:55] many gods and and on and on but it never
[1:04:58] moved God Amen because by faith he lived
[1:05:01] by faith can you say amen amen see so
[1:05:05] God ain't going to ask you to do
[1:05:06] something if he ain't going to do it can
[1:05:09] you say amen that's right see so so God
[1:05:12] is never moved by World conditions he
[1:05:15] has never moved amen by by your feelings
[1:05:18] by your Sensations he he he he ain't
[1:05:21] moved he's got faith amen the faith of
[1:05:25] God amen see and and so if your name see
[1:05:29] because by faith God wrote every name
[1:05:32] that would be redeemed in the Lamb's
[1:05:34] Book of Life do you realize he saw you
[1:05:37] before the foundation of the world see
[1:05:39] he had Faith amen and so he wrote your
[1:05:42] name in the Lamb's Book of Life and if
[1:05:45] your name is written in there then God
[1:05:48] foresaw you amen and by faith he fornew
[1:05:52] you he called you he justified ified you
[1:05:56] and he already what glorified you can
[1:05:59] you say amen he could do that by faith
[1:06:02] before it ever become a reality before
[1:06:05] here you are you're coming into the
[1:06:07] thing that he's already called you that
[1:06:09] he could do it by faith amen it's it's
[1:06:13] it's all by faith so he wasn't bothered
[1:06:16] and uh uh at the fact that you came into
[1:06:19] this world a sinner he wasn't bothered
[1:06:21] by the the life that you lived as as a
[1:06:25] sinner amen uh uh uh because by faith he
[1:06:29] already decreed you and he still lives
[1:06:32] by that Faith he sees you by his faith
[1:06:36] can you say amen he what he has declared
[1:06:39] you to be by faith he's still that's
[1:06:41] that's what he sees you as can you say
[1:06:45] Amen so so then he he lives by faith and
[1:06:49] so his faith exists now notice his faith
[1:06:53] exists by him knowing who he is and what
[1:06:58] he is capable of so it's not like we
[1:07:02] would be that would say well I I want I
[1:07:05] I want I want to have an a nice you know
[1:07:08] a nice house and or I I want to do this
[1:07:11] and I want to do that but then we find
[1:07:13] within ourselves limitations amen that
[1:07:15] we can't we cannot make that happen but
[1:07:18] that's not God God knows who he is God
[1:07:22] God knows that he is able to do it and
[1:07:24] not only is is he able to do it he's
[1:07:26] determined to do it he determined to
[1:07:28] have a bride without spot or wrinkle or
[1:07:30] blemish before the foundation of the
[1:07:32] world and he knew that there was nothing
[1:07:34] greater than him there would be no sin
[1:07:36] greater so he could allow Satan to do
[1:07:38] whatever he wanted to do even bring us
[1:07:42] in into into the most uh demoral
[1:07:45] situation of life that could ever be and
[1:07:48] yet God knew amen by his faith he could
[1:07:52] raise you up amen and bring you back to
[1:07:55] a son and daughter of God he he knows
[1:07:58] that can you sayen see so his faith
[1:08:01] exists but knowing who he is and what he
[1:08:04] is capable of and knowing that when he
[1:08:07] speaks his word it will never fail
[1:08:09] because he stands behind his own word
[1:08:12] ain't that right so then there's no need
[1:08:14] for him to fall apart uh when he knows
[1:08:17] that he's able to redeem you there
[1:08:20] there's no need for him to fall apart
[1:08:22] when he knows he's able to heal you name
[1:08:25] the worst name the worst possible
[1:08:28] situation whether it be disease whether
[1:08:30] it be uh uh uh what whatever it would be
[1:08:34] uh a sin or or whatever and yet God
[1:08:37] never falls apart when you're going
[1:08:39] through it cuz he knows he's able Amen
[1:08:43] to restore you can you say Amen so
[1:08:46] therefore if we know that he's able to
[1:08:48] do it we know that whatever we're facing
[1:08:51] is is not a problem to God then we have
[1:08:53] to rely on his Sovereign will will that
[1:08:56] God has a plan for this can you say Amen
[1:08:59] it's not that Satan has defeated God
[1:09:02] it's not that Satan has put God in
[1:09:04] Checkmate and now God is trying to
[1:09:06] figure another plan on how to help us
[1:09:09] God God's got it all taken care of by
[1:09:12] faith he has done this can you say Amen
[1:09:15] see and so his faith is founded in
[1:09:18] himself knowing that he will do as he
[1:09:21] pleases is that not what the Bible says
[1:09:24] that he does what ever he pleases in the
[1:09:26] heavens and in the earth and he's the
[1:09:28] one that controls the hearts of men he's
[1:09:30] the he controls the the the the the
[1:09:33] Kings he controls Nations he's he's ah
[1:09:35] head of it all yes the these kingdoms
[1:09:38] are set up by Satan and all these things
[1:09:40] but Satan will never ever ever ever get
[1:09:43] the upper hand on God Amen look at King
[1:09:46] Nebuchadnezzar he tried it amen he tried
[1:09:48] to destroy God's children but he can
[1:09:50] never do it amen for God stepped in the
[1:09:53] fire and took the heat out of the fire
[1:09:55] he tried to destroy the Prophet Daniel
[1:09:57] in the Lion's Den but God stepped in
[1:09:59] right in time and shut the M the the
[1:10:01] mouths of the Lions see God is able to
[1:10:04] do whatever he wants to see so his faith
[1:10:08] again his faith is founded in himself
[1:10:11] nothing outside of himself God's faith
[1:10:13] is not based upon you it's not founded
[1:10:16] in you he knows what you are he knows
[1:10:19] you're nothing without him can you say
[1:10:22] Amen so his faith is settled in him he's
[1:10:25] established himself his faith in himself
[1:10:29] he knew that his hand is not shortened
[1:10:32] that it cannot save he knew that there
[1:10:35] is none that can stay his hand he knew
[1:10:38] that once he speaks the word amen his
[1:10:40] word it will not return unto him void
[1:10:43] but it shall accomplish where unto he
[1:10:45] sent it ain't that right that's what the
[1:10:48] Bible says see so in his mind he saw the
[1:10:52] end from the beginning so he's not just
[1:10:55] planning on a day-by-day basis like we
[1:10:57] do or we may even plan a year out and
[1:11:00] yet we don't know if we're ever going to
[1:11:02] get there things may fall apart we have
[1:11:04] to cancel plans amen we have to do
[1:11:06] something else we have to go to plan B
[1:11:08] plan C sometime plan Z you know but but
[1:11:12] it's because we don't have the power
[1:11:14] Amen to make things happen we just go
[1:11:17] day by day and and and as the prophet
[1:11:19] told us we should always say if the Lord
[1:11:21] will if I'm going to do this if the Lord
[1:11:24] will ain't that right but God doesn't
[1:11:26] have to do that he saw the end from the
[1:11:28] beginning he decreed the end from the
[1:11:31] beginning and he done it by his
[1:11:34] faith can you say amen and so by faith
[1:11:38] he decreed it to be so and by faith he
[1:11:41] entered into rest now see now now think
[1:11:45] of it this is God's faith and he shows
[1:11:48] us what can be done by faith his faith
[1:11:52] and and and how he the the the how how
[1:11:55] the the results that his faith brings he
[1:11:58] rests he rests he's not struggling with
[1:12:01] you brother Bill he's not struggling
[1:12:03] with me he's not struggling brother
[1:12:05] Jordan wondering if you're going to make
[1:12:06] it he's already decreed it and by faith
[1:12:09] he's entered into a rest can you say
[1:12:12] Amen see now notice now the the the that
[1:12:17] same faith is expressed in the elect of
[1:12:21] God that that same faith is expressed in
[1:12:24] the elect and see so this Faith only
[1:12:28] anchors itself in the word of God now if
[1:12:31] you're trusting in yourself you've got
[1:12:33] the wrong faith if you're trusting in
[1:12:35] the preacher you've got the wrong Faith
[1:12:38] amen for this faith that God had could
[1:12:40] only come and find its existence in
[1:12:44] himself can you say Amen so then this
[1:12:47] faith that we have of of that is the
[1:12:49] faith of God it is now resting in him
[1:12:53] amen we're not looking to our elves
[1:12:55] we're not looking to our abilities we're
[1:12:57] not looking whether amen we feel like
[1:12:59] achieving or whether we don't feel like
[1:13:01] achieve sometimes we feel like we're you
[1:13:03] know we feel like pressing on other time
[1:13:05] we don't feel like pressing on sometimes
[1:13:06] we think all right we got this Whip and
[1:13:08] other times we wondering God where are
[1:13:10] you at right see but faith faith amen
[1:13:14] endures Faith keeps it in in God's hands
[1:13:18] trusting in God and not
[1:13:23] ourselves now so this Faith only acors
[1:13:26] itself in the word of God it does not
[1:13:29] believe in
[1:13:30] myths nor does it rely on gimmicks it
[1:13:34] doesn't believe in anything outside of
[1:13:38] God's word can you say amen and what God
[1:13:42] has in his word is nothing but promises
[1:13:45] that's right so it does not rely on
[1:13:48] anything outside what God has promised
[1:13:51] for this age can you say Amen this Faith
[1:13:55] feeds off the word of God that's why we
[1:13:58] love to come to church to hear the word
[1:14:00] that's why we love to play the messages
[1:14:03] amen throughout the day this is God God
[1:14:06] has given us the opportunity Amen to
[1:14:09] play the tapes throughout the day God's
[1:14:11] given us the opportunity bless the name
[1:14:13] of the Lord As Americans to be able to
[1:14:16] come freely to worship God and and to
[1:14:19] learn of him why Faith feeds off the
[1:14:23] word when you come when you when you
[1:14:25] when you just well brother Brown said
[1:14:27] when you stay home from church you you
[1:14:29] cannot you cannot remain the same
[1:14:33] Christian in in a strong Christian you
[1:14:35] you just can't do it and so so then then
[1:14:39] we find amen that Faith feeds off the
[1:14:42] word of God and notice it doesn't look
[1:14:45] for anything else because it doesn't
[1:14:49] need anything else talking about the
[1:14:52] faith of God now so here God decrees it
[1:14:55] God by his faith decreed a world now he
[1:14:58] didn't look for someone else to make
[1:15:00] that world happen he didn't look for
[1:15:02] confirmation outside of himself you say
[1:15:05] well there wasn't anybody there exactly
[1:15:08] his faith stemmed from who he was then
[1:15:12] that means he's still not looking to you
[1:15:14] to confirm him he's not looking for this
[1:15:16] church to confirm him he's not look
[1:15:19] we're just here because he decreed it by
[1:15:22] his faith can you say Amen so then
[1:15:25] therefore if we possess the same faith
[1:15:28] we are totally relying upon thus say the
[1:15:31] Lord we we this is why we feed off the
[1:15:33] word of God and we're not looking for
[1:15:36] confirmation from everybody else Amen to
[1:15:39] let us know that we're going to make it
[1:15:42] God said we're going to make it that's
[1:15:44] the faith we live
[1:15:46] [Music]
[1:15:49] by see the faith of God is satisfied in
[1:15:52] the word of God and that's what a Bel
[1:15:55] ver is he's
[1:15:56] satisfied how many
[1:15:59] satisfied satisfied in the word of God
[1:16:02] satisfied in what God has promised
[1:16:05] that's right see and so this is why
[1:16:07] believers do not follow
[1:16:09] impersonations if it doesn't line up
[1:16:11] with the word of God they don't want it
[1:16:14] they don't believe it you can call a
[1:16:16] snub snobs you know uh narrow-minded all
[1:16:19] you want to but the faith of God doesn't
[1:16:22] look for crutches the Faith Of God
[1:16:25] doesn't look for anything else it is So
[1:16:28] Satisfied in the promise of God for
[1:16:32] them that's right can you say
[1:16:35] Amen now people who simply don't have
[1:16:38] faith or their faith hasn't fully
[1:16:40] developed then they need those kinds of
[1:16:42] things to help them along they they need
[1:16:45] an assurance you're going to make it
[1:16:47] keep on keep pressing on you got it see
[1:16:50] and and and and I'm not talking about
[1:16:52] just encouragement we all could use
[1:16:54] encouragement we God sends encouragement
[1:16:56] our way and and and these things and and
[1:16:59] and I think I I I thank God for that
[1:17:02] amen but we we we we don't need them
[1:17:05] things see we're brother brandom would
[1:17:07] call it rugged Faith rugged Christians
[1:17:11] where you don't have to be babied and
[1:17:12] pampered and and all of these things
[1:17:15] you're you're able to actually stand on
[1:17:17] your own two feet now Church we're
[1:17:19] coming to this place where the world is
[1:17:21] turning against us we are becoming more
[1:17:23] odd by by by the day we are becoming
[1:17:26] more of the elite or or uh what what
[1:17:29] what do they call that when when the
[1:17:31] animals are about gone and and extinct
[1:17:35] We are Becoming just about extinct if it
[1:17:38] had not if it's not have have not been
[1:17:40] for the grace of God I hope you
[1:17:42] understand there's plans Satan's got
[1:17:44] plans out there to destroy us he is
[1:17:46] trying his best to destroy us but what
[1:17:48] keeps us standing there is a faith in
[1:17:51] God's word what keeps us from falling
[1:17:53] apart faith in God's word God say
[1:17:56] there's no weapon formed against me that
[1:17:58] can prosper did he not say that well
[1:18:01] then that's all I
[1:18:04] need that's
[1:18:06] right but see people whose faith is
[1:18:08] anchored in the word of God simply
[1:18:10] believe what God Said So they believe
[1:18:13] when things are going good they still
[1:18:15] believe when things are going bad they
[1:18:18] believe when the sun is shining they
[1:18:20] believe when the rain is when it's
[1:18:21] storming they they they they believe can
[1:18:24] you say Amen they believe when they
[1:18:26] ain't got the money amen for things and
[1:18:29] and yet they believe when they do have
[1:18:31] money they believe when they feel good
[1:18:33] they believe when they don't feel good
[1:18:35] it it's a faith it's a faith God doesn't
[1:18:37] look at the world the the conditions of
[1:18:40] this world does not dictate the faith of
[1:18:42] God God he
[1:18:45] settled are you with me heavens and
[1:18:47] earth will pass away but my word will
[1:18:49] never pass away that's what his faith is
[1:18:52] anchored in amen come on now
[1:18:55] yeah so Faith causes the believer to
[1:18:59] endure that word endure means to hold
[1:19:02] out so God would challenge different
[1:19:06] Believers to give us the example Abraham
[1:19:09] 25 years but he held out prise the Lord
[1:19:12] he endured right Noah preached 120 years
[1:19:17] but he held
[1:19:18] out ain't that right on and on and on he
[1:19:22] that's why he would promise the the the
[1:19:24] the the the coming Messiah amen right at
[1:19:27] the very beginning and how many 4,000
[1:19:30] years and there was an elect still
[1:19:32] holding out still holding out still
[1:19:34] enduring looking to the promise looking
[1:19:36] to the promise Why by faith that's right
[1:19:40] by
[1:19:42] faith
[1:19:45] amen see so Faith causes the believer to
[1:19:49] endure Faith keeps Believers from
[1:19:52] jumping ship yeah when the going gets
[1:19:56] tough brother Braham says see Faith
[1:19:58] doesn't move no matter how contrary it
[1:20:00] looks I want to say that again no matter
[1:20:03] how contrary it
[1:20:07] looks
[1:20:10] on faith stays right there it never
[1:20:16] moves now this Faith the faith of God is
[1:20:19] not
[1:20:20] blind it's it's not you you probably
[1:20:22] heard of the phrase Blind Faith
[1:20:26] and and I looked it up Blind Faith is an
[1:20:28] is an unquestioning belief in something
[1:20:33] never questioning just simply believing
[1:20:35] it even when it's unreasonable or
[1:20:39] wrong it's also known as delusion Blind
[1:20:44] Faith So Blind Faith just accepts
[1:20:46] anything anything anything anything
[1:20:48] anything not not
[1:20:50] questioning not questioning is this of
[1:20:53] God or not because see again the faith
[1:20:56] of God only relies upon the word of
[1:20:58] God can you say Amen so so it doesn't
[1:21:02] seek to see it just unquestioning
[1:21:04] accepts it it's
[1:21:06] gullible can you say amen and sad to say
[1:21:09] millions of people just have this Blind
[1:21:12] Faith and they will accept most anything
[1:21:15] without question this is why the Jim
[1:21:17] Jones and the David cores and and and
[1:21:20] and and and all this other has
[1:21:23] followings is because people
[1:21:26] blindly just blindly without question
[1:21:28] without caring it they just blindly walk
[1:21:31] into the Trap and and and and you know
[1:21:34] Jesus called them blind leaders of the
[1:21:37] blind can you say Amen but a real
[1:21:40] believer doesn't have Blind Faith for
[1:21:43] the faith that he actually has
[1:21:48] sees do you believe that see God didn't
[1:21:51] do this by Blind Faith he s
[1:21:55] you come on now ain't that
[1:22:01] right brother brandham called it the eye
[1:22:04] of Faith yeah in other words see this
[1:22:08] Faith sees things that the natural eye
[1:22:11] cannot see amen it's a super
[1:22:14] sense it it it sees it now if you see it
[1:22:18] then you know it you see it
[1:22:20] existent right so see your salvation was
[1:22:24] more more real to God than you being a
[1:22:26] sinner because that's what he saw you as
[1:22:29] is a saint he saw you redeemed he saw
[1:22:33] you can you say Amen he's already got a
[1:22:35] body waiting for you he saw you by faith
[1:22:39] so it wasn't a blind faith well I'm
[1:22:41] going to pick him and I'm going to
[1:22:42] choose this but you know let's see what
[1:22:45] he comes that like no he already knows
[1:22:48] what you're going to
[1:22:49] be because he decreed it he sees you he
[1:22:54] sees you not now the way you are he sees
[1:22:57] you what you are what he's already
[1:22:59] decreed you to be that's exactly right
[1:23:02] well what keeps him from seeing us right
[1:23:04] now the
[1:23:05] [Applause]
[1:23:06] blood that's what brother brandom said
[1:23:09] he cannot see you he sees the blood he
[1:23:11] hears your voice but he sees the
[1:23:15] blood ain't that right and red through
[1:23:18] red makes what
[1:23:21] white though your sins be as Scarlet
[1:23:24] will be white as
[1:23:25] snow can you say amen that's right see
[1:23:29] and so uh uh we find that a real
[1:23:32] believer actually sees it's it's the eye
[1:23:34] of Faith so so then this eye of Faith
[1:23:37] actually sees things that this natural
[1:23:39] eye cannot
[1:23:41] see
[1:23:43] amen amen that's why we live by
[1:23:46] faith come on now and you say Amen see
[1:23:50] it knows things that the the natural
[1:23:52] mind cannot know yeah right
[1:23:56] hello so you could be feeling your worst
[1:23:59] worst ever and you could still come to
[1:24:01] church lifting up your hands praising
[1:24:03] God well what would make you do that is
[1:24:06] because by faith you live you're seeing
[1:24:10] something you you you're in the darkest
[1:24:12] of our but you're seeing the light
[1:24:14] shining on the other side of it you know
[1:24:17] God is there with you but even though
[1:24:19] you feel like he's not there but by
[1:24:21] faith you know he's there
[1:24:27] amen so it is a super sense that
[1:24:30] supersedes the natural senses that we
[1:24:32] have if you if you didn't have the
[1:24:35] natural sense of sight then you would
[1:24:38] not be able to tell what's in the
[1:24:41] room right you wouldn't even be able to
[1:24:43] tell except if you were able to
[1:24:45] distinguish the voices yeah who's in the
[1:24:49] room ain't that
[1:24:51] right that's right but if you did have
[1:24:54] the natural sense of hearing then you
[1:24:57] wouldn't be able to tell the the kind of
[1:24:59] noise that is sounding in the
[1:25:01] room ain't that right thank God for
[1:25:04] natural
[1:25:06] sense and and by our natural sense it
[1:25:09] becomes a reality I I don't I don't I I
[1:25:13] don't have to wonder if sister Brenda is
[1:25:16] here this morning because I see
[1:25:19] her and so I don't go around questioning
[1:25:21] is sister Brenda here did she make it no
[1:25:24] my own eyes ver bear witness that she's
[1:25:27] here now that's the natural so that I'm
[1:25:31] at rest she's here anyone that would
[1:25:33] tell me she's not here anyone would say
[1:25:35] well sister Brenda didn't make it I'd
[1:25:37] have to say well no my eye ain't didn't
[1:25:40] play tricks I saw her not only that I
[1:25:44] heard
[1:25:45] her you understand what I'm saying see
[1:25:48] it it becomes a knowing to me it becomes
[1:25:51] something solid to me it becomes a
[1:25:54] guarantee an assurance to
[1:25:57] me a ain't that right that's right see
[1:26:00] someone you know uh uh our visitors the
[1:26:03] uh other night come in and and and and
[1:26:05] some of them said well I didn't see the
[1:26:07] the the gentleman I I I didn't see him
[1:26:09] and I could say but he was there cuz I
[1:26:11] saw him he he he was in the room well I
[1:26:14] didn't see him well I I don't that
[1:26:16] that's fine but but but you ain't going
[1:26:17] to tell me you that don't shake me in
[1:26:20] the fact that he wasn't there I saw him
[1:26:22] for myself
[1:26:24] can you say Amen see so we're not living
[1:26:27] by somebody else's experience we living
[1:26:29] by a faith that we have it's our
[1:26:33] eyesight it's declaring to us the things
[1:26:36] that cannot be seen by this natural
[1:26:39] eye that's right
[1:26:43] amen you see if you didn't have faith
[1:26:45] that eye of faith that super sense you
[1:26:47] you wouldn't know that there's the
[1:26:49] Unseen God and angels all around us
[1:26:51] right now amen hello right if if you
[1:26:55] didn't have this eye of Faith then you
[1:26:57] wouldn't be able to look beyond the
[1:26:58] natural and see the promises of God so
[1:27:02] then everything around you would dictate
[1:27:04] your life if the sun is shining it would
[1:27:06] dictate you if the clouds were there it
[1:27:09] would dictate you everything about your
[1:27:11] life whether you're you're you're going
[1:27:12] through something or or all of these
[1:27:14] things but by the eye of Faith then we
[1:27:17] become more assured and that rest
[1:27:20] knowing I don't care what it says that's
[1:27:23] devil says well you're not going to make
[1:27:24] it but by the eye of faith I see myself
[1:27:34] there Hebrews 11:6 it says he that
[1:27:37] cometh to God must believe that he is
[1:27:40] amen so in other words you must see that
[1:27:45] he is don't learn about just Ju Just
[1:27:48] learn about God see that he is
[1:27:54] amen can you say amen that's the only
[1:27:57] way to come to
[1:27:59] God
[1:28:02] God I I'm I'm needing
[1:28:05] help if if if you could just help
[1:28:09] me I I know I could make it you're not
[1:28:13] coming to God
[1:28:14] right you have to see that he's
[1:28:17] able well God if you really love me you
[1:28:20] know I I just feel so alone if if you
[1:28:23] just love me and and show me your love
[1:28:25] and and I I really don't know you're
[1:28:28] you're not coming right you're coming by
[1:28:31] wishes God I wish I could be better I I
[1:28:35] just wished I I just wished I could be
[1:28:37] what you want me to be I I don't know I
[1:28:41] I I just you know you know what that'll
[1:28:44] dictate your worship every
[1:28:46] time instead of having hands lifted up
[1:28:52] it's head hanging down come on now yeah
[1:28:55] I don't
[1:28:56] know hello yeah but when you come to God
[1:29:00] believing that he is then you that means
[1:29:03] you see that he
[1:29:05] is can you say amen that's right so see
[1:29:09] that that's the faith that the believer
[1:29:10] has he knows that God is present tense
[1:29:14] he knows that God is alive and well he
[1:29:17] knows that God is all powerful he knows
[1:29:20] that God is omniscient he knows that God
[1:29:23] is s Sovereign he knows that God is
[1:29:26] greater than any situation that he's
[1:29:28] going through he he knows that God is a
[1:29:31] way maker can you say Amen see faith is
[1:29:35] what causes us to ask for big things
[1:29:37] because that's what God has promised us
[1:29:40] is big things so our prayer doesn't
[1:29:42] should not should not be tampered by our
[1:29:45] complexes our prayer should not be uh
[1:29:48] tempered and and limited amen by our
[1:29:51] feelings and our emotions and all these
[1:29:53] things we must believe that God is well
[1:29:56] what is what is the god that you're
[1:29:58] serving tonight or today come on Church
[1:30:02] what is the god well oh oh well he's
[1:30:05] he's he's Mr Trump he's the one that's
[1:30:07] promised this world peace
[1:30:09] right come
[1:30:12] on well well we we get our satisfaction
[1:30:15] in in in in some basketball player the
[1:30:17] team that we're rooting for because they
[1:30:19] win
[1:30:22] really but we can't find a peace in
[1:30:26] prayer knowing that that that that when
[1:30:29] we call upon him he is listening to
[1:30:35] usall can you say Amen see so so to to
[1:30:40] believe that God is is to know that God
[1:30:42] is able to keep his
[1:30:44] word and that he is determined not only
[1:30:47] able but he's determined to fulfill
[1:30:49] every promise that he's
[1:30:52] made can you say Amen
[1:30:54] he that come unto God believes that God
[1:30:56] is faithful to his
[1:30:59] word living by
[1:31:02] faith amen hallelujah this is the faith
[1:31:06] that we live by by the eye of faith we
[1:31:11] see what God has promised for this day
[1:31:14] well how do we see it then it's by
[1:31:16] Revelation amen are you with me it's
[1:31:19] it's by Revelation faith is a revelation
[1:31:22] the prophet said so revelation is an act
[1:31:25] of revealing to view see taking off the
[1:31:28] cover taking off the what is veiling it
[1:31:30] take unveiling it so that we can view it
[1:31:34] and and it's a making known it's an
[1:31:36] unveiling of something ain't that right
[1:31:38] see and and so then then then then
[1:31:41] before the Revelation came it couldn't
[1:31:43] be seen everybody pre probing at it
[1:31:45] wishing and and wondering what it is and
[1:31:48] don't really know how can you pray to a
[1:31:50] god that you don't really know how can
[1:31:53] you pray and ask for things that you
[1:31:55] really don't know if it's available to
[1:31:57] you but see when the unveiling is is is
[1:32:00] taken is takes place the Revelation
[1:32:04] comes
[1:32:07] Lord you know brother Brandon said if we
[1:32:11] lose Faith all our spiritual reality is
[1:32:17] gone I'll say that again if we lose
[1:32:20] faith if if if it it it it it just like
[1:32:24] you if you lose your eyesight if you
[1:32:26] lose your hearing then the reality of of
[1:32:29] what's around you is gone you won't know
[1:32:32] if they're in the room or out of the
[1:32:33] room you wouldn't know who is here and
[1:32:35] who isn't here see then then it becomes
[1:32:38] a a a
[1:32:40] question but when faith comes and and
[1:32:43] and so if we lose that super sense if we
[1:32:46] lose that sense of Faith then the
[1:32:48] spiritual reality of Heaven and the
[1:32:51] blessings and the promises of God are
[1:32:54] gone it's lost to
[1:32:57] us
[1:32:59] it brother brah said you cannot have
[1:33:01] faith in things that you
[1:33:03] see talking about the natural life for
[1:33:05] the things that you see are all
[1:33:08] perishable do you believe
[1:33:11] that money is perishable materialistic
[1:33:14] things are perishable everything that we
[1:33:17] you do not build your hopes up on this
[1:33:20] life and expect to get through life and
[1:33:23] I say that to you young people you can
[1:33:25] build dreams and all that and and and
[1:33:27] good for your dreams but but but but
[1:33:29] don't live by those dreams live by
[1:33:32] faith live by faith cuz circumstances
[1:33:36] will change you can have your all the
[1:33:39] Ducks lined up in a row and and have
[1:33:41] everything just planned and and
[1:33:43] something just comes and shatters
[1:33:47] that live by faith amen sir can you say
[1:33:51] amen he said if we look at some great
[1:33:53] person or great minister or great
[1:33:55] congregation they will all perish
[1:33:56] someday if we look at a great nation or
[1:33:58] a great weapon they'll all perish
[1:34:00] someday and then we must we must
[1:34:03] everybody say we must live by faith of
[1:34:06] those things that science does not
[1:34:08] declare it's by faith that we believe
[1:34:11] now we lose our Glory if we lose faith
[1:34:15] if we get away from Faith then we take
[1:34:17] the church into an intellectual
[1:34:20] Rim then we're trying to reason how it
[1:34:23] can happen and how it can be and we're
[1:34:25] trying to make it all work and and line
[1:34:27] up before we can believe we don't want
[1:34:29] intellectual faith we want a faith of
[1:34:32] God that can actually see it and make it
[1:34:35] real to us make it positive to us and
[1:34:38] know that it puts our heart at rest your
[1:34:41] salvation is positive not because you
[1:34:43] came to an altar it was positive before
[1:34:46] you ever was
[1:34:47] born by faith God lived it by faith God
[1:34:52] saw it it was a Revelation to him and
[1:34:55] you can't take it out of God's mind
[1:34:57] that's right no sin can take it out of
[1:34:59] God's mind no situation can take it out
[1:35:02] of God's
[1:35:03] mind even to the fact that if you were
[1:35:06] to to die burned
[1:35:08] alive or if you were to drown and and
[1:35:11] and your ashes scattered through the
[1:35:12] four corners of the world it'll World
[1:35:14] it'll never take that picture out of
[1:35:16] God's
[1:35:17] mind it's by faith he
[1:35:21] lives that's right amen
[1:35:26] I hope it all
[1:35:28] right you see Revelation is a Divine
[1:35:31] truth everybody say a Divine truth div
[1:35:34] trth revealed by
[1:35:36] God thus Faith Comes Revelation is not
[1:35:41] your idea it's not what you come up with
[1:35:45] it's a Divine truth that only is
[1:35:48] revealed by God thus Faith Comes
[1:35:54] his Revelation that he had of you now
[1:35:56] strikes your
[1:35:57] soul his revelation of a bride for this
[1:36:00] date now strikes your
[1:36:03] soul can you say amen amen now you take
[1:36:06] on the mind of God now you see as God
[1:36:08] sees it you confess as God confesses
[1:36:12] it's by faith we
[1:36:14] live by
[1:36:17] faith you see it takes it to be from God
[1:36:22] before faith can come because Abraham
[1:36:24] would not have had the faith that he
[1:36:27] had if God would not have revealed to
[1:36:30] him that's right his
[1:36:34] future if God did not reveal to
[1:36:37] him that his seat would possess the
[1:36:40] gates of his enemies right before he
[1:36:42] even had a seat yeah to the Natural it
[1:36:45] was impossible for him to have a seat
[1:36:48] but God revealed it to him therefore
[1:36:51] Abraham never looked at his situation
[1:36:54] he never looked to Sarah at her
[1:36:55] situation he never expected Sarah to
[1:36:58] come up with something he never come
[1:37:00] expected himself the pressure was lit
[1:37:03] off of him because by Revelation he
[1:37:05] could see the
[1:37:09] sun amen 25 years but he kept watching
[1:37:12] him am he could see
[1:37:15] it am the world made fun of him because
[1:37:18] he they couldn't see it because they
[1:37:20] were looking by natural eye where's your
[1:37:22] son never moved Abraham he could see it
[1:37:25] by Revelation he knew it was coming
[1:37:29] am that's it's
[1:37:32] true can you say
[1:37:36] Amen yep he saw the sun he saw the sun
[1:37:40] before the world ever saw it
[1:37:43] therefore by his faith he called those
[1:37:46] things that are not as though they
[1:37:49] were can you say amen amen he called
[1:37:52] those things that are not though they
[1:37:53] were I was just listening to brother
[1:37:54] brandham this morning and he was talking
[1:37:56] about how that he was praying and
[1:37:58] thanking God for for a man like Joseph
[1:38:01] yeah in the Bible he's reading about
[1:38:04] Joseph and he just got to thanking God
[1:38:05] for a man like Joseph and he said it
[1:38:07] wasn't a vision it was just something
[1:38:09] spoke to his heart a revelation you
[1:38:11] shall have a son and you shall call him
[1:38:14] Joseph how many years did he go four
[1:38:17] five many
[1:38:19] years going to have a Joseph he went
[1:38:22] around telling the world going to have
[1:38:23] have a son named Joseph wife got got to
[1:38:26] exp him is that going to be Joseph I
[1:38:27] don't know but I'm going to have a
[1:38:28] Joseph right and and and he says you
[1:38:32] know then then Sarah was born everybody
[1:38:34] started making fun of him he said his
[1:38:35] own flesh Brothers start well then you
[1:38:39] know I thought you said that the the the
[1:38:41] prophecies were always right they are
[1:38:43] right well well but but you didn't have
[1:38:45] Joseph I didn't say when I was going to
[1:38:46] have Joseph I'm going to have Joseph
[1:38:48] right and then someone says well maybe
[1:38:50] it was Josephine you meant no no it was
[1:38:52] Joseph and and and and people started
[1:38:55] making fun of him and all that but see
[1:38:57] what he saw he
[1:39:00] declared can you say amen he didn't need
[1:39:03] confirmation he didn't need the doctor
[1:39:05] to say oh you got a boy no no God had
[1:39:07] already showed him and he could see
[1:39:10] Joseph before the world ever saw him
[1:39:13] never moved
[1:39:15] him doctor says oh you better tie her
[1:39:18] tubes up she ain't ain't going no no she
[1:39:20] it's by her going to have a boy she
[1:39:23] going to die I don't care she's going to
[1:39:25] have a boy I don't know how it's all
[1:39:27] going to work out I already see Joseph
[1:39:29] coming then you say Amen because it was
[1:39:32] a
[1:39:33] revelation he lived by
[1:39:39] faith so he called Abraham called those
[1:39:42] things that were not as though they were
[1:39:44] the Amplified says he spoke of the
[1:39:46] non-existent things that God had
[1:39:48] foretold and promised as if they had
[1:39:51] already existed think of that now now
[1:39:54] that makes us
[1:39:57] crazy
[1:39:59] right how can we speak of us being there
[1:40:02] when we're not
[1:40:05] there how can we speak of a body change
[1:40:08] as though we're already
[1:40:10] there how can we speak of being in a
[1:40:12] Rapture as and and yet here we are in
[1:40:14] this body of
[1:40:17] Shame amen we're speaking of things that
[1:40:20] do not exist yeah but yet we see see
[1:40:25] them by
[1:40:27] Faith by faith that's the same way with
[1:40:29] your healing people say well I I don't
[1:40:31] feel any different so I'm ashamed I I
[1:40:32] probably shouldn't say anything cuz it
[1:40:34] make me act crazy if you really got the
[1:40:36] faith of God you'll express your healing
[1:40:39] before it ever happens why because your
[1:40:41] healing is real to you it don't have to
[1:40:43] be real to the world it don't even have
[1:40:45] to uh be real to your own body but by
[1:40:49] faith you see yourself
[1:40:51] healed therefore you declare you're
[1:40:54] healing I am
[1:40:57] healed it's like that the blind man John
[1:41:00] out on the streets extra extra read all
[1:41:02] about it thank God I'm
[1:41:05] Healed what was it he could see
[1:41:08] it that's can you say amen he was
[1:41:11] confessing something that wasn't even in
[1:41:13] existence to the world and the world
[1:41:16] would make fun of him and they would jab
[1:41:18] at him and and all of these things the
[1:41:20] barber you know that final time the last
[1:41:22] Jab
[1:41:24] I heard you went to a holy ghost meeting
[1:41:26] yes I did I heard you got prayed for yes
[1:41:27] I did I heard you can you're saying
[1:41:29] around here that you can
[1:41:31] see yep yep well you can see oh thank
[1:41:34] God I can see and the scales come off
[1:41:36] his eyes it become a
[1:41:39] reality can you say Amen see but the
[1:41:43] confession is what made Abraham crazy to
[1:41:45] the
[1:41:47] world but he could see it when they
[1:41:50] couldn't Bible says Abraham against hope
[1:41:53] believe in Hope ain't that right humanly
[1:41:56] speaking scientifically speaking medical
[1:41:59] speaking it was totally impossible there
[1:42:02] was no hope at all but by faith he
[1:42:05] believed in Hope then what where did
[1:42:08] that hope come from the promise of
[1:42:12] God the hope we're not a hopeless
[1:42:16] people amen are you with me church you
[1:42:19] can go through the biggest trial of your
[1:42:21] life but you're not hopeless
[1:42:24] the promise gives you
[1:42:26] hope if you could just look beyond the
[1:42:28] natural and see the Promise for
[1:42:32] you then against hope you'll believe in
[1:42:35] hope that's can you say Amen the Bible
[1:42:39] says he staggered not at the promise of
[1:42:41] God but was strong in faith his body
[1:42:43] grew weaker but he was stronger in faith
[1:42:46] his body showed more signs of negativity
[1:42:49] but he was strong in faith can you say
[1:42:51] amen he never lost vision of the promise
[1:42:53] that promise never lost its reality to
[1:42:56] Abraham the sun was just as real as
[1:42:59] though it was right there in Flesh and
[1:43:01] Blood that's right Lord now brother
[1:43:04] Brown said he was like God he had a part
[1:43:07] of God in him for he believed and you
[1:43:10] say amen he was like God Abraham was
[1:43:13] like God for he had a part of God in him
[1:43:16] for he
[1:43:18] believed to have the faith of God is to
[1:43:20] have the nature of God to have the
[1:43:23] divine nature of God humanly possible
[1:43:26] you can't have have the faith of God but
[1:43:28] when God imparts himself in you now you
[1:43:31] have his divine nature you have his
[1:43:33] Divine character you have his Divine
[1:43:38] [Music]
[1:43:39] word therefore when God speaks a word it
[1:43:42] comes as a re Revelation to the one it
[1:43:44] is intended
[1:43:46] for you see God didn't speak his word in
[1:43:48] this day just for men to wander about it
[1:43:51] and to fuss over it
[1:43:53] amen there's many men women boys girls
[1:43:58] just argue about the message of the hour
[1:44:00] fuss about the me message of the hour
[1:44:02] trying to prove it's
[1:44:05] right but here is an elect God sent that
[1:44:09] word to the elect just like he sent it
[1:44:13] he he sent it to Abraham he sent it to
[1:44:15] Noah he sent it to all the the the the
[1:44:17] Saints of old and he sends that word to
[1:44:20] the elect of this age
[1:44:23] amen for them to Anchor their soul in am
[1:44:27] and to believe it regardless of the
[1:44:28] condition yes can you say Amen see the
[1:44:32] word came as a revelation to the elect
[1:44:36] see so it's it's to a certain group of
[1:44:38] people the Revelation came to Abel not
[1:44:40] to Cain it came to lot or Abraham not
[1:44:44] lot it came to moses' parents and not to
[1:44:46] the
[1:44:47] others and you say amen and it caused
[1:44:50] them all to act different caused Abraham
[1:44:52] to act act different than
[1:44:54] lot caused Noah to act different from
[1:44:57] the rest of the world why because they
[1:44:59] were seeing something that the rest
[1:45:01] can't see it caused Moses's parents to
[1:45:04] to act different than the others that's
[1:45:07] right they knew the promise was here
[1:45:11] they knew it was time for deliverance
[1:45:13] can you say Amen by faith they could see
[1:45:15] it they Liv by that Faith Can you say
[1:45:19] amen and I say to you the Revelation has
[1:45:21] come to us in this day
[1:45:23] yes sir let the world fuss about it and
[1:45:25] argue over it and deny it and and say
[1:45:28] well this message is just a sham and and
[1:45:30] all of these things but it's a
[1:45:32] revelation to
[1:45:34] US 1 Corinthians 2:9 but as it is
[1:45:38] written I have not seen nor ear heard
[1:45:40] neither have entered into the heart of
[1:45:41] man the things which God hath prepared
[1:45:44] for them that love him but God hath
[1:45:47] revealed them to us by his spirit for
[1:45:50] the spirit searcheth all things yay the
[1:45:53] Deep things of
[1:45:54] God see so there is a people in this day
[1:45:58] that is rising up in faith for something
[1:46:01] has been revealed to them that they're
[1:46:04] now seeing things that that no man can
[1:46:06] ever
[1:46:07] see for what man knoweth the things of a
[1:46:10] man say the spirit of man which is in
[1:46:11] him even so the things of God knoweth no
[1:46:14] man but the spirit of God now we have
[1:46:16] not received uh we have received not the
[1:46:19] spirit of the world but the spirit which
[1:46:21] is of god that we might know the things
[1:46:23] that are freely given to us of God can
[1:46:26] you say Amen now notice the Revelation
[1:46:29] that the believer receives lines up with
[1:46:31] the word of God we're not interested in
[1:46:34] just any man's revelation we want that
[1:46:36] Revelation that comes from the
[1:46:38] scriptures and then it's Vindicated to
[1:46:42] let us know that the Revelation came
[1:46:43] from God not from
[1:46:46] man theologians have read this Bible
[1:46:49] forever and try to tell us how this how
[1:46:51] this what this Bible means right but it
[1:46:54] was never backed up or
[1:46:56] Vindicated but God come in this age
[1:46:58] through a prophet of the
[1:47:01] age Lord can you say Amen yes sir see so
[1:47:04] therefore this is how Faith Comes the
[1:47:09] Revelation lines up with the written
[1:47:11] word of God Revelations or Romans 10:17
[1:47:15] so then Faith cometh by hearing that
[1:47:18] word means uh hearing is understanding
[1:47:20] or Revelation see Faith cometh by
[1:47:24] understanding Revelation by hearing and
[1:47:27] hearing by the word of God by the word
[1:47:31] of God not some Creed not some idea can
[1:47:34] you say Amen not a Pentecostal idea not
[1:47:37] a Baptist idea ain't that right not my
[1:47:42] idea not your idea see brother brah said
[1:47:45] faith is something that's revealed to
[1:47:47] you that is not yet but you believe it
[1:47:50] will be how many believes it it will be
[1:47:54] that's we live by faith we believe by
[1:47:58] faith that's right yes sir it will be it
[1:48:01] will
[1:48:03] Beall don't base your decisions young
[1:48:06] people on your ex
[1:48:08] discouragement base your decisions by
[1:48:11] faith it will be I may not see it today
[1:48:15] I may not feel it today but it will be
[1:48:19] for by the eye of faith it exists in my
[1:48:21] view
[1:48:23] it exists it exists it exists prise the
[1:48:26] Lord hallelujah see we're not making
[1:48:27] things up these things are actually
[1:48:29] revealed to us ain't that right so we're
[1:48:33] not hoping that it's going to be and
[1:48:35] therefore act like it's going to be we
[1:48:37] know it's going to
[1:48:39] be and confess that it
[1:48:42] is can you say amen for God has actually
[1:48:46] revealed his word to us now see Moses
[1:48:50] parents and I get ready to close but
[1:48:52] Moses parents had this same kind of
[1:48:55] faith of God see Hebrews 11:23 by faith
[1:48:59] Moses when he was born was HD three
[1:49:01] months of his parents because they saw
[1:49:03] that he was a proper child and they were
[1:49:06] not afraid of the king's commandment now
[1:49:08] you know the prophet said when fear is
[1:49:10] gone faith is
[1:49:12] perfect when fear is gone faith is
[1:49:15] perfect Lord they were not afraid of the
[1:49:18] king's commandment so therefore they did
[1:49:20] not allow themselves suppos to be
[1:49:23] dictated by by fear of what that King
[1:49:26] had
[1:49:27] decreed death was all around them but
[1:49:30] they live by
[1:49:31] faith not by what a king decreed they
[1:49:35] live by faith can you say amen that's
[1:49:39] right by faith they saw that he was for
[1:49:41] ordained of God to be delivered to the
[1:49:43] children of Israel see it was revealed
[1:49:46] to them and the Revelation notice that
[1:49:48] they received lined up with the
[1:49:51] scriptures yeah
[1:49:54] it was according to the promise that God
[1:49:56] gave
[1:49:57] Abraham Lord can you say
[1:50:00] amen and they would have never had that
[1:50:03] type of
[1:50:04] Faith had not it been revealed to them
[1:50:07] all right they would have been just like
[1:50:09] everybody else and and shaken by the
[1:50:12] fear by the com the the with fear of the
[1:50:15] of the king's
[1:50:16] Commandments of what that King
[1:50:19] decreed but God revealed to them
[1:50:22] something different
[1:50:23] the king had determined to kill him but
[1:50:26] they knew different because they could
[1:50:28] see Moses as a
[1:50:32] deliverer can you say Amen yes sir they
[1:50:35] could see nothing else but a
[1:50:38] deliverer prise the Lord they look at a
[1:50:41] dead
[1:50:42] baby think of it if they feared what
[1:50:46] Pharaoh said about him they would have
[1:50:48] been looking at wondering this could be
[1:50:50] his last breath this could be any moment
[1:50:52] any moment they didn't
[1:50:54] fear because they saw a
[1:50:57] deliverer the king's commandment could
[1:50:59] never take that from him them what they
[1:51:02] saw they saw not in existence at that
[1:51:06] time but they saw it by faith and knew
[1:51:10] it by Faith Lord now notice Revelations
[1:51:13] 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the
[1:51:16] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:51:17] sound the mystery of God should be
[1:51:19] finished as he ha declared to his
[1:51:20] servants the prophets amen now just
[1:51:23] reading quotes that we all know that the
[1:51:25] seventh angel brother BR said winds up
[1:51:28] all the Loose Ends that these fellas
[1:51:30] probed at and the mystery comes down
[1:51:33] from God as the word of God and reveals
[1:51:36] the entire revelation of
[1:51:39] God can you say
[1:51:41] Amen now now in this revelation of God
[1:51:45] you can't help but see
[1:51:49] yourself right cuz you're part of God

[1:51:56] part of him as Eve was to
[1:51:58] Adam praise the Lord hallelujah so this
[1:52:02] Revelation that comes from that seven
[1:52:04] Angel reveals the mysteries of God then

[1:54:18] Revelation in the opening of the word is
[1:54:21] the revelation of of our name written in
[1:54:24] the book before the foundation of the
[1:54:25] world prise the lord Revelations 51 and
[1:54:29] I saw in the right hand of him that sat
[1:54:31] on the throne a book written within and
[1:54:33] on the backside sealed with Seven Seals
[1:54:36] and I saw a strange angel or strong
[1:54:39] angel proclaiming with a loud voice who
[1:54:41] is worthy to open the book and to loose
[1:54:43] the seals thereof no man in Heaven Nor
[1:54:46] in Earth neither under the Earth was
[1:54:48] able to open the book neither to look
[1:54:49] thereon and I wept much because no man
[1:54:52] was found worthy to open and to read the
[1:54:54] book neither to look thereon and one of
[1:54:56] the elders saith unto me weep not Behold
[1:54:58] The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root
[1:55:00] of David hath prevailed to open the book
[1:55:03] and to loose the seals thereof and I
[1:55:06] beheld and lo in the midst of the the
[1:55:08] throne and of the four beasts and in the
[1:55:10] midst of the Elder stood a lamb as it
[1:55:12] had been slain having seven horns seven
[1:55:15] eyes which are the seven spirits of God
[1:55:16] sent forth into all the Earth and he
[1:55:19] came and took the book out of the right
[1:55:21] hand of him that sat upon the throne and
[1:55:23] when he had taken the book The Four
[1:55:25] beast and 4 and 20 Elders fell down
[1:55:28] before the lamb having every one of them
[1:55:30] Harps and golden vials full of oders
[1:55:32] which are the prayers of the Saints and
[1:55:34] they sung a new song See saying Thou Art
[1:55:37] wory to take the book and to open the
[1:55:40] seals thereof for thou was slain and H
[1:55:42] has redeemed us to God by thy blood out
[1:55:44] of every Kindred tongue people and
[1:55:47] nation and has made us what a revelation
[1:55:51] now is coming forth H has made us Kings
[1:55:54] and Priests and we shall reign upon the
[1:55:57] Earth can you say Amen it's a revelation
[1:56:01] they're seeing something by
[1:56:03] faith see and I beheld and I heard the
[1:56:07] voice of many angels round about the
[1:56:09] throne and the Beast and the elders and
[1:56:10] the number of them was 10,000 times 10
[1:56:13] thousands and thousands of thousands and
[1:56:16] saying with a loud voice Worthy is the
[1:56:18] Lamb that was slain to receive power
[1:56:20] riches wisdom strength and honor and
[1:56:23] glory and blessing and every creature
[1:56:26] which is in heaven and on the earth
[1:56:28] under the Earth and such as are in the
[1:56:30] sea and all that are in uh in them heard
[1:56:34] I see saying blessing and honor and
[1:56:37] glory and power be unto him that sth
[1:56:39] upon the throne and unto the lamb
[1:56:42] forever and ever ain't that right so the
[1:56:44] brother Ram talking about this scripture
[1:56:46] he says what a jubilee going on in
[1:56:48] heaven that when the lamb leaves the
[1:56:51] that intercessory body
[1:56:52] here to come here to possess his claim
[1:56:55] you know that got next to John he must
[1:56:58] have saw his name wrot there what a
[1:57:04] revelation he saw himself there he saw
[1:57:08] himself redeemed he saw himself saved he
[1:57:11] saw himself already
[1:57:15] secured amen can you say amen he must
[1:57:19] have saw his name wrot there when them
[1:57:21] seals broke he must have got real happy
[1:57:23] another place John must have looked in
[1:57:26] and saw a past the curtain of time and
[1:57:28] said there's John there's
[1:57:32] me living by
[1:57:36] faith I believe brother Ram said God's
[1:57:40] great mystery what the Eternal God had
[1:57:43] as a mystery has now been unfolded in
[1:57:46] Jesus Christ then given right down to
[1:57:48] his church what once was once in God's
[1:57:51] mind is now in the body of Christ Jesus
[1:57:54] making love to the church his bride

[1:58:24] church by him revealing the secrets to

[1:58:38] secrets not these flirters I mean his
[1:58:41] wife he said all right now look no he
[1:58:44] says by having the revelation of his
[1:58:46] secret made known to them see by his
[1:58:49] grace how the grace of God people he
[1:58:51] says I hope you know uh you don't think
[1:58:54] this sounds personal to a bunch of
[1:58:55] people or this that but the secret that
[1:58:58] God is sharing with the whole church if
[1:59:01] they would just receive it doesn't mean
[1:59:04] just me or just you it means the church
[1:59:08] he's trying to get into
[1:59:10] it can you say amen and I say to you you
[1:59:14] don't need a personal word from the Lord
[1:59:17] when the lamb has opened the book in
[1:59:20] this day and is trying to reveal it to
[1:59:23] his entire
[1:59:25] church you don't need to have some
[1:59:28] Vision or some experience to go to
[1:59:30] heaven amen just to see your name
[1:59:32] written there the Revelation is coming
[1:59:35] through the message of the
[1:59:38] hour it's the message that God through
[1:59:41] the message is God revealing the secrets
[1:59:44] to the
[1:59:46] church Hallelujah well I wonder if God
[1:59:49] loves me I just I just wonder I I wonder
[1:59:52] if I'm going to make it well you don't
[1:59:53] need someone to prophesy over
[1:59:56] you telling you you're going to make it
[1:59:59] it's right hearing the word you just
[2:00:02] need God to reveal it to
[2:00:04] you Amen on it's true
[2:00:08] anyways Lord you just need a revelation
[2:00:11] of what is written in the
[2:00:13] word and you cannot buy the the bypass
[2:00:16] the prophet and have an understanding of
[2:00:18] this word it's been closed up the
[2:00:22] greatest minds of this
[2:00:24] Bible can even couldn't even understand
[2:00:27] it and still can't today it comes by the
[2:00:29] message of the hour can you say Amen
[2:00:33] every promise can you say that with me
[2:00:35] every promise has been revealed revealed
[2:00:39] by the seventh
[2:00:41] angel every promise has been revealed by
[2:00:44] the seventh angel that's exactly right
[2:00:47] can you say amen and this message is the
[2:00:51] Joshua minist his that not only took the
[2:00:54] people into the promised land but showed
[2:00:56] them the
[2:00:57] promises and placed them in the promise
[2:01:00] in their
[2:01:02] inheritance can you say amen amen by
[2:01:05] faith yes sir we live by faith good amen
[2:01:10] now the Revelation that makes it known
[2:01:12] to us this is why brother brandham said
[2:01:14] pray for Revelation for re pray for
[2:01:17] Revelation oh if if if I could just set
[2:01:20] under minister so and so no just pray
[2:01:22] for
[2:01:23] Revelation oh but if I could just do
[2:01:25] this and if I could just do this if
[2:01:27] someone just prophesy over me and I I'd
[2:01:29] feel you know that's the way it was in
[2:01:31] Pentecost we we we just on you on an
[2:01:34] emotional roller coaster you know some
[2:01:36] some guy that was supposed to be a
[2:01:38] Prophet come in we just oh God if You'
[2:01:40] just call me out I know you love me you
[2:01:42] know I I just know if you call me out I
[2:01:44] know I'm going to make it you know well
[2:01:47] then if he didn't call you out then what
[2:01:48] are you going to do you know it's like
[2:01:50] rubbing the rabbit's foot you know you
[2:01:51] just trying to wish for luck and all
[2:01:53] these things see but but when the
[2:01:56] message of the hour has come then then
[2:01:59] you don't need those things you now you
[2:02:01] become you just need the revelation of
[2:02:04] what God has been whispering all along
[2:02:06] to his
[2:02:07] church these are love
[2:02:10] secrets that's right why why why would
[2:02:14] we want something
[2:02:16] else brother Braham said a prophet never
[2:02:18] had to stand before a judge to be judged
[2:02:21] yeah are you with me yeah come on Isaiah
[2:02:24] never had to stand before anyone to be
[2:02:26] judged of them why he had the word of
[2:02:29] the Lord he just spoke thus say the Lord
[2:02:32] it happened it didn't take didn't matter
[2:02:34] how long it it took there's some of his
[2:02:36] stuff prophecies that are still yet to
[2:02:39] be uh uh uh uh
[2:02:41] fulfilled speaking of the the Millennium
[2:02:44] and stuff prise the Lord but but he
[2:02:46] never stood but every a a a a a dream
[2:02:50] has to be judged right right if if if it
[2:02:53] if it's all in symbols it takes a
[2:02:55] prophet to to to to reveal the
[2:02:58] dream if a prophet ain't there God ain't
[2:03:00] going to give dreams and
[2:03:02] symbols it's just the facts it's that
[2:03:06] way the message taught can you say
[2:03:09] amen and then if if a gift of Prophecy
[2:03:12] Goes Forth an interpretation is not to
[2:03:14] be received the church is not to receive
[2:03:17] it unless it's judged by two or three
[2:03:21] Witnesses and them Witnesses has to be
[2:03:23] credible they have to be
[2:03:26] proven so why would we want to base our
[2:03:30] our faith in them things hello I believe
[2:03:33] in gifts I believe in Prophecy I believe
[2:03:35] in them things but brother Brown tells
[2:03:37] us what it's supposed to be you know he
[2:03:39] says you know prophecy comes forth
[2:03:42] interpretation and says Mr Jones there's
[2:03:44] a tornado coming to your house tomorrow
[2:03:46] at 2:00 make sure you're not there get
[2:03:48] your house in order make sure you're not
[2:03:50] there and then tornado just sure enough
[2:03:52] just wipes the house or whatever and the
[2:03:55] church all comes together brother Jones
[2:03:56] is there at the church and they're all
[2:03:58] excited just praising God for saving
[2:04:00] brother
[2:04:01] Jones that's the way it ought to
[2:04:04] be that's right
[2:04:06] amen but but to put your
[2:04:10] destination your Eternal destination and
[2:04:13] build your faith upon them
[2:04:16] things well God if you just send someone
[2:04:19] just prophesy over me and tell them you
[2:04:21] know that I'm saved saved I'll be all
[2:04:22] right no we live by faith we live by
[2:04:26] faith that that that's what makes all
[2:04:28] these personalities rise up because
[2:04:30] people ain't living by faith they're
[2:04:32] going from preacher to preacher preacher
[2:04:33] to preacher Church to church they they
[2:04:35] just want satisfac satisfac uh
[2:04:39] satisfied they just want to be satisfied
[2:04:42] they they just want to feel secure the
[2:04:44] word will secure you if you can get the
[2:04:47] revelation of what has been
[2:04:50] said can you say amen you love the Lord
[2:04:53] amen you may believe it you may not but
[2:04:56] that's just the way I believe it amen
[2:04:59] it's got to become a revelation to our
[2:05:03] hearts amen if the musicians will
[2:05:06] come God help us to live by faith amen
[2:05:10] there's anything that we should pray for
[2:05:11] is revelation God reveal it to me can
[2:05:14] you say amen amen I thought of Moses's
[2:05:19] mother how she defied
[2:05:23] everything because she lived by
[2:05:26] faith brother Bram said she saw him with
[2:05:30] the children of Israel taking them over
[2:05:32] into the promised land she saw that
[2:05:34] praise the Lord and and and and so by
[2:05:38] faith and you have you have to
[2:05:41] realize that everything about Moses
[2:05:44] growing up was contrary to what what she
[2:05:48] was
[2:05:50] confessing she had to give him
[2:05:52] away Place him in a you know in a in in
[2:05:57] an ark in in like brother BR would say
[2:06:00] in
[2:06:03] death showing the death and Resurrection
[2:06:06] he was raised up but then you you you
[2:06:09] look he was reared up taught by the
[2:06:15] enemy he lived in the enemy's
[2:06:18] house he's being prepared by the enemy
[2:06:20] to take the Throne of the
[2:06:23] enemy he was being taught Egyptian
[2:06:26] language he was being taught no doubt
[2:06:29] their
[2:06:31] cultures he was being dressed like the
[2:06:34] enemy having their clothes instead of
[2:06:37] Hebrew clothes she took him as a
[2:06:40] son hello and yet all along by faith his
[2:06:45] mother saw a deliverer never moved him
[2:06:48] never moved her at
[2:06:49] all by faith
[2:06:53] she would tell Moses Moses you're a
[2:06:56] deliverer and what if she would have
[2:06:57] given up what if she would have looked
[2:06:59] at the conditions there's my child
[2:07:00] dressed as an Egyptian speaking
[2:07:04] Egyptian there's my child he's supposed
[2:07:07] to be one of us and look he looks more
[2:07:08] like
[2:07:10] them what if she just backed off and not
[2:07:13] said a word but by
[2:07:15] faith am she didn't see some Egyptian
[2:07:18] she saw a
[2:07:20] deliverer she saw the promise and by
[2:07:23] faith she kept teaching
[2:07:25] him you're called of God Amen no doubt
[2:07:29] maybe he was being introduced to all
[2:07:31] these other gods Moses there's only one
[2:07:33] God and he called you one of these days
[2:07:36] you're going to deliver the people amen
[2:07:38] one of these days she she lived by faith
[2:07:41] she Ted by faith she taught her children
[2:07:44] by faith right can you say amen
[2:07:47] amen that's
[2:07:50] good did you know
[2:07:52] know Moses was trained under military of
[2:07:56] the of the
[2:07:58] Egyptians he was taught by the
[2:08:01] best of that
[2:08:03] day he was taught by their
[2:08:06] scientists he knew how all the medicines
[2:08:10] worked he knew all the he was a smart
[2:08:14] man looked like he had his way made and
[2:08:18] it looked like there was so much in
[2:08:21] influences around Moses's life that his
[2:08:24] poor little old
[2:08:26] mother didn't even stand a chance amen
[2:08:30] but you know
[2:08:32] what the prophet said it was Moses's
[2:08:36] mother that helped build his
[2:08:40] [Music]
[2:08:41] character because she did it by
[2:08:44] faith she didn't look at what he was she
[2:08:47] didn't look the way he was being trained
[2:08:49] by pharaoh and all them
[2:08:52] by faith she clung to a promise that's
[2:08:55] right and God honored
[2:08:57] her and all the influences that he was
[2:09:00] under could not touch the influence of
[2:09:03] that
[2:09:04] mother that's good and her
[2:09:07] faith caught onto
[2:09:09] him and the Bible says when he got old
[2:09:12] enough to take that Throne he by faith
[2:09:16] refused to be called Pharaoh's Son by
[2:09:21] Faith
[2:09:23] Moses when he looked out that window and
[2:09:25] he saw the slaves out
[2:09:28] there think of
[2:09:31] it when Pharaoh looked at them people he
[2:09:33] just saw nothing but mud dobers and
[2:09:38] slaves and vagabonds and no good people
[2:09:41] and all that but by faith when Moses
[2:09:43] looked out there he saw the children of
[2:09:45] God he saw the people of God where did
[2:09:48] he get it his mother was teaching him
[2:09:50] she was ins stealing something within
[2:09:54] him and even though it become it was an
[2:09:57] intellectual Faith at that time it was
[2:10:00] changing him he began to see something
[2:10:03] different he chose to be a mud Dober
[2:10:05] with him than to take the
[2:10:07] throne can you say Amen but one of these
[2:10:11] days that that intellectual teaching
[2:10:14] come together with a personal experience
[2:10:17] with
[2:10:18] God Moses was changed that's that you
[2:10:21] love him we live by
[2:10:24] faith God help us to live by faith today
