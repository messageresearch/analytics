[Music] [Music] I read of a land that is wonderously fair. They say that its splendor is far beyond compare. In that place that's called heaven, my soul longs to be. But Jesus will be what makes it heaven for me. Heaven for me. Heaven for me. Jesus will be what makes it heaven for me. [Music] All the beauty and splendor I'm longing to see. But Jesus will be what makes it heaven for me. [Music] If the walls there weren't jasper and if streets were not gold. If mansions would crumble. And if folks still grow old, still I'll see everything that I'm longing to see. For where Jesus is, it will be heaven for me. Heaven for me. Heaven for me. Jesus will be what makes it heaven for me. All the beauty and splendor I'm longing to see. But Jesus will be what makes it heaven for me. [Music] For where Jesus is, it will be heaven for me. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe that tonight? &gt;&gt; Every promise in the book is mine. Every chapter, every verse, every line. Oh, I am trusting in his love divine. Oh, every promise in the book is mine. Oh, every promise in the book is mine. Oh, every chapter, every verse, every line. Oh, I am trusting in his love divine. Oh, every promise in the book is mine. If Jesus said it, I believe it, for his words cannot lie. For it's written in the Bible, I'll believe it till I die. Though the mountains be removed and cast into the sea, God's word will live forever throughout eternity. If Jesus said it, I believe it. His word cannot lie. It's written in the Bible. I'll believe it till I die. Though the mountains be removed and cast into the sea, God's word will live forever throughout eternity. Amen. Are you ready to hear the word tonight? Amen. If we could just stand to our feet as we invite our pastor to come. Lead me, Lord, and I will follow. Lead me Lord and I will follow. Lead me Lord and I will go. You have called me and I will answer.

Lead me, Lord, and I will go. Well, is that your desire? is God just to lead us and we'll be willing to go. Amen. For we know that he doesn't lead us in places that wouldn't be contrary to his will. Amen. But um and he promised that he'd be with us. Amen. Protect us. Amen. Uh it's good to be here in the house of the Lord and the musicians can um be dismissed and um trust everyone had a good day today. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And um good to have sister Crystal here with us this evening and &gt;&gt; see that she's uh recovering and so this is wonderful. &gt;&gt; And uh I tell you what, the Lord is is good to us. Amen. And uh sister um Leotaa is I guess most of you know that she's passed away uh last Sunday and um and so they're going to be having her memorial service uh at Saturday and uh be there at the church spoken word tabernacle. And so the viewing or visitation is going to be from 11 to 1 and then right after that will be the funeral service. And um so if you'd want to go I um um there's that. Amen. If you uh want to do that, we uh certain I appreciate the life of um Sister Leotaa and Brother Roy. Um, I think I read they were married 79 years and so uh uh we u I know brother Roy was a great inspiration uh to me. Amen. And uh if you have your Bibles uh we're going to turn to the book of Job. Amen. And uh the first chapter. Praise the Lord. Amen. And uh before we go into the word, may we just bow our heads, talk to our Lord. Father, it is indeed a privilege to be here, Lord, once again, gathered with your people, gathered under a promise, Lord, that you would be here with us. Not that you have to, but it was a desire of yours, Lord, to meet with your redeemed and manifest yourself among us and how we, your children, are under great expectation to see you this evening. I pray that you would speak to us, Father, and Lord, that you would feel at home, feel welcome, be free, Lord, to do whatever you would want to do. For we are a people that believe in the supernatural. We are a people that believe that all things are possible, Lord, to them that believe and that there's nothing, Lord, that you cannot do. and you've given us a a Bible full of promises that would cause our hearts to come under expectation. Even so, Lord, do it, Lord. And I pray that you would anoint both speaker and hearer. Help me to get myself out of the way. And may you speak through me, Lord, to your people. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen. I uh have forgotten my glasses today and my eyes kind of hurting. So I've asked Daniel to read for us. Um so we're going to read Job 1 uh through 6 and then Job chapter 2 um or Job uh chapter 1 6-12 and Job 2 1-6. Amen. Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came along uh came also among them. And the Lord said unto Satan, "Which comest thou?" Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, "From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it?" And the Lord said unto Satan, "Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that fearth God, and uh it cheweth evil." Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, "Does Job fear God for for not? Hast thou not made a hedge about him, about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. But put forth thy hand now, and uh touch all that he hath um and he will curse thee to thy face. And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thine power, only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Job chapter 2 and verse 1-6. &gt;&gt; Again, there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord. And Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord. And the Lord said unto Satan, "From whence thou with from whence comest thou?" And Satan answered the Lord and said, "From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it." And the Lord said unto Satan, "Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that fearth God, and cheweth evil?" And still he holdeth fast his integ uh integ in integ uh yes, I can say integrity. Yes. Amen. As a twist of my tongue. Although thou hast moved me against him to destroy him without cause. And Satan answered the Lord and said skin for skin. Yeah. All that a man will uh hath will he give for his life. And put forth thine hand now and touch his touch his bone and his flesh and he will curse thee to thy face. And the Lord said unto Satan, "Behold, he is in thine hand, but save his life." &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you can um have your seats this evening. And if I were to uh use the title, it would be He knows the way that I take for he ordained it for me. Um what I have to say this evening uh is nothing new. Um but I I do pray it'll encourage you. And u before I get started, I um uh uh want to say that that God has a way. How many believes that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has a way. And um just if you look through the Bible, you'll you'll see that it's the way of truth. So there's no perversion in it. No lie. It's a way that is perfect. For the Bible says, "As for God, his way is perfect." It's the way of God. It's the way of righteousness. &gt;&gt; The Bible also tells us that this way is the way of life. And there is no death in it. &gt;&gt; There's no destruction in it. There's no um uh defeat in it. &gt;&gt; It's it's a way of life. And brother Brandham in praying for a woman who was having a nervous breakdown said, "Father, here a salvation woman stands here this afternoon. Oh, I pray that you'll heal her and make her strong." She's nervous and breaking down. After a while, Satan will have her sitting in a padded cell if he had his way. But your way is different. Your way is the way of health. May she walk in that path from now on in the path of health. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; What a path. &gt;&gt; What a way. A way of health. A way of victory. A way of triumph. a way that uh Satan's effect uh loses its power. Satan has no power in this way. &gt;&gt; And so I I can't help but believe that Job was walking in this way of God. He knoweth the way I take. Now it it would seem that the the trial that Job was going through uh would destroy him &gt;&gt; and that is certainly the intention of the devil. &gt;&gt; But yet Job had this consolation that he would come forth. &gt;&gt; Amen. For he knew the way he had taken and God knew. Now you know when we talk about tri the trials that we go through, we we have to talk about Job. Uh because um Job um is is the example for all of us believers. All every believer goes through trials and tribulations. There's not one of us that will be exempt from it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh uh and so uh we can relate to the pain, the suffering, the maybe the anxieties, the anguish that Job went through. And I I believe that God purposefully gave uh a detailed account of what happened before and during and after Job's trial &gt;&gt; and and God uh uh also gave us Job's attitude in the trial. Yeah. &gt;&gt; God wanted us to make sure that we knew that what Job was before the trial. &gt;&gt; After the or during the trial and after the trial, &gt;&gt; Romans 15:4, Paul would tell us that for whatsoever things were written before time were written for our learning. &gt;&gt; So God purposefully puts Job's story in scriptures for our learning. &gt;&gt; Amen. that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; We going to go through things, but we got scriptures &gt;&gt; that we can find comfort and have hope. Job didn't have scriptures that he could look to and say, "Oh, this one, you know, uh, made it and God brought took him through trials and he made it and all these things." But we do have scriptures that we can find comfort and hope. Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; So, one thing that uh we learn from Job's story is that God knows what we're going through. How many believes that &gt;&gt; God knows? And and and God wanted us to make sure uh that that uh we could read this that God knew what Job was going through. And this this is important to us because Satan uh does his best to try to convince us that God uh doesn't know where we're at. That uh God has forsaken us and and he isn't concerned. But we we find in the book of Psalms 37:18, it says, "The Lord knoweth the days of the upright." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knows every day that you live. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh Psalms 16, the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous. Ain't that right? So he has a knowledge. He has a knowledge and understanding of the way of of the righteous. He comprehends the way of the righteous. And and we find again going back to Job is that the way of the righteous is not one uh that is a flower flower flowery bed of ease, but it's a way of hardship. &gt;&gt; How many believes that &gt;&gt; it it it's a way of suffering, a way of trials, uh uh a way of tribulation. 2 Timothy 3:12, it it says, "All that live godly or all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution." &gt;&gt; Not some, but all. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, um, uh, you know, Brother Brandon would say it this way. Sometimes we have more troubles when we become a Christian than we did when we were sinners. &gt;&gt; Now think of that. Ain't that contrary to the way we think and the way uh uh the the Christianom wants to paint the the life of Christianity today? &gt;&gt; But but think of that. We we have sometime more trials as a Christian than we do uh uh a a as a sinner. Uh uh Psalms 34:19, "Many," everybody say, "Many, many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord deliverth them." Say, "The Lord deliverth him &gt;&gt; out of them all." See, and so I I'm reminded of what Paul told the elect in in First Thessalonians uh 3 and2. He says, "We sent Timoththeus, our brother and minister of God and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith that no man should be moved by these afflictions." &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; No man should be moved by these afflictions, for yourselves know that we are appointed there unto. So Paul was not bemoning the afflictions. He was not saying, "Look, this has come to me as a surprise. I I really don't know what to do. I I don't know what's happening." But but yet Paul was telling them, I I've come we've sent someone to see that that that you're not moved by these afflictions. &gt;&gt; We we've told you that these things are to happen. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And and were appointed there unto. For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation even as it came to pass. And you know, ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So, and and and to think now even us ministers, I I I want to read a scripture that um uh uh maybe comfort the ministry. Um, and I'm I'm not just talking about ministers, but I'm talking about anyone that's in ministry doing something for the Lord. Uh, because Paul would tell us that there's things that ministers uh have to endure. He said, "We then as workers together with him beseech you also that you receive not the grace of God in vain. For he saith, I have heard thee, in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I secured thee. Behold, now is the accepted time. Behold, now is the day of salvation. giving no offense in anything, that the ministry be not blamed, but in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, &gt;&gt; in afflictions, &gt;&gt; in necessities, in distresses, in stripes, &gt;&gt; beaten, right? imprisonments, in other words, being uh uh thrown in jail, in tomb, tumults, uh uh turmoil, I guess, in laborers, in watchings, in fastings, by puress, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned. &gt;&gt; Amen. by the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, by honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report, as deceivers and yet true. As unknown and yet well-known, as dying and behold, we live. As chastened and not killed, as sorrowful yet always rejoicing. as poor yet making many rich, as having nothing and yet possessing all things. &gt;&gt; What a ministry. What what a what a a time. I mean, what what what things we go through. So to to expect that, you know, as ministers, we we well, you know, we want every life to be good. We want everything. And and yet Paul is telling us that's not the way of ministry. &gt;&gt; There's always going to be afflictions. There's always going to be the ups and downs. There's always going to be the troubles. There's always going to be the testings and the challenges. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Now, we we all go through these things. You know, Brother Brandham says, "Sometimes I think we ministers make it a little too much flowers for the convert. Oh, come to Christ. Everything is lovely." But you see, it isn't like that. Everybody says it isn't like that. If you've lived uh uh uh for Christ just just barely uh uh a few days, you you know that that that it isn't like that. It's not a flowery bed of ease. Oh, come to Christ. See, he said it isn't that way. See, in the way that that saying that everything is a flowery bed of ease because he says, see, if you're not suffering persecutions for Christ's sake, then there is something wrong. &gt;&gt; If you're not going through things, there's something wrong. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I I'm not advocating that you go seek trouble. I'm not advocating that you go seek to be poor. God will bring it upon you. Uh can you say amen? I'm not saying that you pray for afflictions or seek afflictions and and all of these things. I'm just saying whatever God leads you or brings you to, just take it as no surprise. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so the the prophet goes on, if the devil ain't after you, then he's got you. &gt;&gt; That's all. Because as long as he's after you, that's a sign he hasn't got you yet. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? See, but if he isn't a few, it's a sign that he's got you. Yeah. So, just remember, as long as he's blasting at you, you're a few jumps ahead of him. Yet, just keep on going. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So, Job had this revelation that God knows the way that I take. &gt;&gt; I think that's a a a a comfort that we all should have in the trials. uh uh is is is he knows the way that I take. &gt;&gt; Even David wrote in Psalms 139 uh 1-3, "Oh Lord, thou hast searched me and known me. Thou knowest my downsitting, my uprisings. Thou understandest my thought a far off. Thou compasseth my past and my lying path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways." Ain't that right? Amen. So, so there was nothing about David that was hid from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and the scriptures pertain to us that if God was acquainted with all of David's ways, he's acquainted with all of our ways. &gt;&gt; He knows everything about us. He knows our ups and downs. He knows our valleys, our mountains. He knows every experience that we go through. He knows all the seasons that we go through. Amen. and and he's acquainted with all of these. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; See, so now it it's the way of humanity uh uh to think that God only knows the good things that happen to us that that he's only concerned about the good things and he's only uh blessing us with good things and and anything else is just uh God's not in it at all. uh it's the devil and and uh uh but but that's that's not really true. And and and we readily in in this day see the good times uh as as uh times of blessings uh of God. Amen. and and uh but when we go through the suffering and experience loss and loneliness and and the hardships, we tend to believe that God is no longer interested and and somehow Satan is able to cut us off from the blessings of God and and that God may be over here and and there's a big gap and Satan's got us over here and God's trying to reach and trying to trying to get to us and we just don't know what we're going to do. Amen. Well, that's not that's not the case at all. &gt;&gt; Amen. If if you look in um uh Revelations 2:9, God speaks to the church saying, "I know thy works and tribulation and poverty." And we know, Brother Brown deals with this in the church age book. Amen. And he says, "Remember, he's walking in the midst of his people. &gt;&gt; He's present among them." Ain't that right? Amen. And and yet they are going through the worst time that the church has gone through up to that point. And and and and he's not standing there looking helpless as he watches them go through all of this trouble and tribulations and the poverty that they're going through. He's not saying, "I know there, but I I can't help you because I can't reach you." No. He's standing in the midst of the church. A ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So So then he's he's not standing there helpless. Amen. For the prophet said he's the chief shepherd of the flock. A shepherd is a is a guide. A shepherd is protector. It's I I it's the uh uh uh uh provider of his flock, the deliverer of his flock. Ain't that right? as David which was a type of Christ when when the lion come after his flock. Amen. David anointed went and and and slew that lion and rescued that sheep and and and when the bear come to do the same thing. David under the anointing he ran after that bear and slew the bear. Ain't that right? So here is Christ as the chief shepherd &gt;&gt; amongst his flock. And yet it just seems like Satan as the wolf is devouring the sheep, devouring the church, devouring the elect. And God is helpless to do anything about it. &gt;&gt; That's the picture we paint. &gt;&gt; But that's not the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. He is the chief shepherd and there's nothing that the devil can do to us to destroy us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So God simply tells them, I know you're suffering and your tribulation and he lets them know that he is not at all unmindful of what they are going through. He sees, he knows, he's aware &gt;&gt; of the way that they've taken. Ain't that right? Now, brother Bram would say this is a stumbling block to so many people. He said it's just like Israel, you know, they wondered if if God really loved them. How can God be just and loving if he stands by and watches his people suffer? And and this is exactly what they they asked there in Malachi 1 uh and one the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi, I have loved you, sayith the Lord. Yet you say, "Wherein hast thou loved us?" What was not Esau's Jacob brother? Sayeth the Lord. Yet I loved Jacob and I hated Esau. I laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness. Ain't that right? So the prophet says, "See, Israel could not understand God's love. Neither can we understand God's love." A lot of times, especially when we're going through the trials, we we feel the love of God when everything is going great. We feel the love of God when when, you know, the the stock market is high and and we're making great bank, you know, in in our investments and and and the jobs are looking good and everything is just great. No troubles. Amen. But then we start questioning the love of God when we go through the sufferings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you know uh uh people feel that somehow if if God truly loved them then they wouldn't have to go through sufferings &gt;&gt; and and you know they think that God proves his love to them by caring for them the way a mother would her infant child. &gt;&gt; But the prophet said God's love is elective love. &gt;&gt; Everybody say God's love &gt;&gt; is elective love. Now notice the proof of his love is election. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh God, I just wish you had proved your love for me." He's proved it by electing you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He proved it by choosing you. &gt;&gt; He proved it by ordaining you. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And and and so his the proof of his love is election. that no matter what happened, his love was proven truly by the fact they were chosen under salvation because God hath chosen you to salvation through the sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth. Aren't you glad for election? &gt;&gt; Amen. We couldn't even come to God. We couldn't even desire God if there was not an election upon our lives. That God chose us. Therefore, it is proof that he loves us. So no matter what happens, no matter what we go through, we can ass be assured that God loves us. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's right. So the prophet said, "God may commit you to death as he did Paul." He may commit you to suffering as he did Job. &gt;&gt; That's his prerogative. &gt;&gt; For he is the one that is sovereign. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So then therefore it it would behoove us and I I pray God just helps us more and more to know the God that we really serve. &gt;&gt; We believe he's How many believes he's God? &gt;&gt; Do you believe he's almighty? &gt;&gt; I believe he's almighty. I believe he's greater than anything. But I also believe he's sovereign. And if he's sovereign, he doesn't get have to get permission. Amen. From me, from you, from the pope. He doesn't have to get permiss permission from anybody. He didn't have to get permission to save you, to choose you, to ordain you. He didn't have to get permission to give you the promises. And he doesn't have to get permission in the way he deals with us. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's right. The Bible says he's an all- wise and all- knowing God. So he he is the one who works all things according to his purpose. &gt;&gt; The sovereign God is able to work all things according to his purpose. &gt;&gt; So what looks like it would be a detriment to you, what looks like it would be a a something that would destroy us, Amen. God uses these things to produce his plan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So he isn't performing according to our pleasure and our wants. It is not him that looks to us and says, "Well, what would you want me to do today?" But it is us who prays to him, "Thy will be done." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now to think of that when we say thy will be done, we are actually by our own free moral agency asking him or we could even say it giving him the permission. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And not only saying, "Well, God, you can have your way in my life." But there is the desire for God to have his way in our life. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; This is the problem. We got people proclaiming Christianity, but the Bible says that in this day they would deny the Lord that bought them. In other words, they would deny him lordship, rulership. They would deny him the right to rule over them. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; See, and and and and so but but the elect looks to God and we're understanding that God, you're sovereign. You are the great shepherd. And without you, I'm nothing. &gt;&gt; I want you to lead me. I want you to have your divine way and your purpose in my life. &gt;&gt; Now, he knows the way I take because he has ordained it. Psalms 37:23, "The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, &gt;&gt; and he delightth in his way. Though he fall, he shall not utterly be destroyed or cast down." Why? It's a way of life. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Though he fall, he shall not utterly uh be cast down for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Now, he is the one God is the one as we read that he asked Satan, "Hast thou considered my servant Job?" &gt;&gt; Right? Now, God wanted us to understand this &gt;&gt; that before one trial hit Job, God was having a conversation. &gt;&gt; God is the one that brought Job's name up. &gt;&gt; Satan didn't even think he had a chance with Job &gt;&gt; because he said, "Thou hast a hedge around him and his house. &gt;&gt; I can't touch him." &gt;&gt; Hello. That's right. He said to the Lord, "You have made an hedge about him and about his house and about all that he hath on every side." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have blessed the work of his hands and his substance is increased in the land. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you're asking me, "Have I considered Job? I can't do nothing." &gt;&gt; But you you just let your hedge down a little bit. You allow me to get to him. I'll be able to do something with him. Right? &gt;&gt; So then then we find the Lord says unto Satan, "Behold, all that he hath is in thine power. Only upon himself put not forth thine hand." &gt;&gt; So Satan goes from the presence of the Lord with the authority and the power to touch everything that Job owns. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? God wants us to make sure that we understand that &gt;&gt; true &gt;&gt; that it wasn't just men coming and taking Job's stuff. &gt;&gt; It was God giving Satan the authority to do such &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Now, so God allowed Job to go through this trial. It was not because Job sinned. &gt;&gt; Amen. It wasn't because Job disobeyed God. &gt;&gt; For Job was a righteous man. &gt;&gt; He was walking in the way of righteousness. &gt;&gt; For Job says, "He knoweth the way I take." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It was a way of blood. It was a way of a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; It was a way of an atonement. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Job knew that he was perfect before God. not by himself, but by a blood sacrifice. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And his heart was perfect before God. And still God allowed him to go through hell. &gt;&gt; Job couldn't get away from it. &gt;&gt; He couldn't run from it. He couldn't sidestep it. He couldn't prophesy his way out of it. Come on now. &gt;&gt; He couldn't fast enough to get out of it. &gt;&gt; Couldn't pray enough to get out of it. &gt;&gt; It was totally out of his hands. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, Psalms 11:5 says, "The Lord tryth the righteous." Can you say that with me? The Lord tryth the righteous. The Lord tryth the righteous. It's not the wicked that he just tries. He tryth the righteous. &gt;&gt; So then Job acknowledged that God had a hand in the trial that he was going through and he says, "And when he hath tried me, &gt;&gt; I shall come forth as gold." &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. In Job's story, we learn two things that are going on when we go through trials. When we go through trials, by reading Job's story, we understand that there's two things that are going on. &gt;&gt; For one, that the trials are a contest between God and Satan. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; It's a contest. Now, the the one thing that's going on is Satan is trying to get Job to curse God. &gt;&gt; He's trying to get you to curse God &gt;&gt; through your trials that you go through. He's trying to get you to curse God. He's trying to get us to quit on God and give up. That's exactly what happened to Job. Even his wife turned against him &gt;&gt; and told him to curse God and die. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Now, I personally believe that it was Satan speaking through that woman, trying to get to Job. &gt;&gt; Maybe Job really loved that woman. It was his wife, helpmate. It was his companion. And yet Satan to not not to get to her, but to try to get to Job, he was speaking through her, which was his heart. and and and she even tells him, "Honey, won't you just give up, curse God, and die?" &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; See, I believe that Satan also spoke through uh Job's friends and accused him of being a sinner. I I I I believe that, you know, Satan will affect us, you know, he will affect us in our body. He'll affect us in our spirit, in our mind. He will affect us in the things that maybe we own or have, we love dearly, whatever. And then he will speak to us in whatever form. He will bring thoughts in our mind. Maybe he'll use people, maybe use what whatever. But but he's good at putting thoughts in our mind. And he brings accusations towards us. And he tells us, see, we're not worthy. you you you you've done this and you've done that and and and and oh, he's he's just good at what he's doing. And and and his purpose is is to get you to lose faith in God, &gt;&gt; to get you to turn and to believe that God has turned against you. Why not turn against him? &gt;&gt; Is that not the way it is with with humanity? is you turn against me, I turn against you, you say something against me, I say something against you, you do something harmful to me, I seek revenge. And now he is trying to get us to think that God is seeking revenge from us from our sins, our failures, and and he's after us and all of the there's no hope. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, and and and and so so we we all experience these things. Amen. Of of and and sometimes we can even feel, you know, the depths of despair and and and the depths of darkness. It it goes so long and it and the trial is so hot and it just seemed like we ain't we just don't know where to turn and who to go to and and all of these things. Well, you know, his job's friends, he had these three friends and uh you know, Brother Brandham says they were church folks. I can't help but believe that they were a littleistic, legalistic in their doctrines and their ways. And I just can't help but believe that they were righteous, but they had some self-righteous &gt;&gt; their self-righteousness. And maybe maybe they saw things about Job that they really didn't approve of and had never approved of and you know he was a good boy, but they saw things that maybe through their legalistic eyes uh wasn't just quite right and and all these things. And so now that Job has lost everything and Job's going through the trials and he's got boils and and and and he just suffering and it seemed like God ain't answering his prayers and all that. Now it' be a good time that maybe they begin to think that maybe God is now starting to see the way they saw all along &gt;&gt; and they start accusing Job of being a secret sinner. They they they they start finding faults and and start finding things that well, any man, any woman that really wants to serve God, they're going to get hit really hard on them things. Well, you've done this and you've done that. And maybe maybe you know uh uh maybe the you know uh you you everything going wrong because you've you've disobeyed or you haven't done things right and and maybe that's the way they people can start thinking about a church or maybe they start looking at a family and and everybody wants to be vindicated and and they feel more vindicated when someone else is going through the trials and say see I told them I I I knew that they were wrong. I knew that this was right uh not the way that you know and they shouldn't have left and they shouldn't have done that and they shouldn't done that. Now look at their problems. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But you know Job knew he was righteous again because of the blood sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said God was dealing with the saint in Job's trials. God was dealing with the saint. &gt;&gt; So he was not in agreement with Job's accusers. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Now, so, so Satan was using this trial to get Job to curse God. That was the bet. You let me have him and I'll get him to curse you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Take off everything. Take off the hedge. Break all that down. Let me in in on it. I'll take his family. I'll take everything that he's got. I'll even Well, you you know that he came back. He wasn't able to get Job that way. So, he said, "You let me have him. Let me just let me put sickness on him. Let let me inflict him in his body." And you know how it is when you're inflicted in your body, then it starts working in your mind. &gt;&gt; You're not feeling good. you're running fever and you're just starting to get weak and and all that. Then it starts working in your mind and Satan starts talking and he starts knocking and he starts all these things. So So that trial, Satan was using the trial to get Job to turn against God, but yet God was using the trial to reveal himself to Job. the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, Romans 8:28, it Paul would tell us, "We know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose." &gt;&gt; Now, notice what a prophet said. God promised. Everybody say, "God promised." &gt;&gt; You love the promises of God. &gt;&gt; Always love to see what God promised me. Yeah. &gt;&gt; How many wants to know what God promised you? &gt;&gt; Oh, man. Well, I want to tell you what God promised. God promised many afflictions. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You still want to know what he promised you? &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Strange feelings, strange things that would be beyond our understanding. But it's always, everybody say, it's always &gt;&gt; done for our good. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, so he has established his love to us by election. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's the best way for him to establish his love. Not by giving you a candy bar &gt;&gt; because tomorrow he might not give you that candy bar. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Not by answering a prayer of yours because tomorrow you may not just get your prayer answered the way you want it &gt;&gt; and as fast as you want it. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; He established his love to us by election &gt;&gt; all together. &gt;&gt; Then he has his sovereign way with us. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; But it's done for our good. just can't understand it because if we did then it would not be a faith to us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If we understood everything of God's plan, if if we understood if he'd come in flesh and he just broke it all down for us and broke down our future and broke down, we wouldn't have to pray a prayer of faith. We wouldn't have to preach a sermon of faith. We wouldn't have to sing a song by faith. We wouldn't have to worship God by faith because we'd have it all written down. Explain to us that God does things beyond our human understanding that we would worship him, serve him by faith and faith alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, see, but we do it. We do it and we have it and believe. We believe by faith, his word, that it's going to work some good thing for us. If we could grasp that today, uh uh if we could grasp that all of our troubles, there is none of us immune from them. And if we could realize that those things are for our good. Every every believer is in God's hands for we are an eternal thought of God. Brother Brandham has labored on that the last part of his sermons laboring to tell us that we are an eternal thought of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God thought of us as his sons and daughters. Amen. &gt;&gt; God thought of us as the bride for Christ, the bride of Christ. God thought of us as word children. &gt;&gt; God thought of us as the pure, sinless, virtuous bride of Christ. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; God saved us. Uh we were saved before the foundation of the world. Everything that God had thought of us to be was in God's mind. And that is the reality of it. We did not come that way. But the reality is is that you're not a sinner. You're a son. &gt;&gt; Now you have to go through the you the process of blood sanctification, the baptism of the Holy Ghost coming to adoption that God already thought of this be in the in the in his mind before the foundation of the world. Ain't that right? So brother Brown says now you were made for an eternal purpose. So God is not you you just stumble through here and you're parting and drinking and lying and acting like an idiot and then all of a sudden you you think, "Oh my, I need to get saved." You know, and you get saved and then God all all of a sudden gives you a purpose. No, God had a purpose for you before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And and so therefore, you were made even when you were conceived in sin, born in iniquity, all of that stuff. You were made for an eternal purpose because you was the manifestation of an attribute that was in God that thought of you and expressed you. And he made an earth to take you out of and to make you a human being. Can you say amen? He did not make you for this earth. He made this earth for you. That's true. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; For you would be an expression uh uh laying there in the dust and God would take that dust. Amen. And put you in that body, amen, to express his thoughts. &gt;&gt; So he made an earth to take you out of to make you a human being. Sin come along, perverted his way. You come anyhow, but you was lost with the world. So he came and redeemed you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The expressed attribute. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So now he says in the future home, all the curse of sin is gone when the Holy Ghost accepts you. &gt;&gt; You don't accept the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost accepts you. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? you you ain't just coming and you know just walking down through life and and God who there might be something special about him. &gt;&gt; I think I'll just try and give him the Holy Ghost. See what happens. &gt;&gt; No, you were an eternal thought. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost accepted you &gt;&gt; because you were in his mind. &gt;&gt; You didn't accept the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You don't have to beg for it and plead for it. The Holy Ghost comes and accepts you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now watch he says now if it's the Holy Ghost means God's spirit is the attribute the thought of God has accepted you because uh that you were ordain ordained for that purpose. Yet you was born in sin but God had that attribute and here you expressed yourself here on the earth. He comes down and gets you. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; He comes down and get you. &gt;&gt; Satan thought he had you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You get it? &gt;&gt; Satan thought he had you. And that stupid devil thinks he still got you when you're going through your trials. &gt;&gt; But God come and broke that power. Satan &gt;&gt; loose you. He came to get you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? comes down and gets you. You're back here. Here is where you belong. You're back here. Sin has lost its power. That's right. The desire of sin has done gone from your heart. When the Holy Ghost comes in, you are a restored person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm as glad you're a restored person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, you have that token, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. But in order to become the clear or full expression or whatever you want to call it of God's thoughts, we must be molded into his image, word image. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So there now has to be a molding. Doesn't mean you lost the Holy Ghost. God's put that in the scripture and the prophet laid that clear. And if you ever got the Holy Ghost, you're sealed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; You're sealed to the day of your redemption. &gt;&gt; Not when you lost the victory. When even when you lose the victory, you've got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Even when you have fallen flat on your nose, you still got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Even in your darkest moments, you've got the Holy Ghost. There's nothing that can take that. You're sealed. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; But there's a molding. Yeah, &gt;&gt; there's a shaping, &gt;&gt; there's a trimming, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I liked um what one uh brother said. He was talking about Moses and um Michelangelo. And if I it's going to be paraphrasing, but basically he said he took that rock and he wasn't he wasn't mo he wasn't shaping Moses out of that. He already saw Moses. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He saw Moses in that rock. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He just chipped away all the stuff that wasn't Moses. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's true. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; He already saw Moses in that rock. Now he just started chipping away things that wasn't Moses, that wasn't a part of Moses. &gt;&gt; What you always was a son of God. You was always a daughter of God. You was always there. That God has to take all of that stuff that is not part of that. &gt;&gt; It's not part of your original life. It's not part of the original thoughts of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So there has to be this molding and and the prophet Jeremiah speaks of it. Jeremiah 18:1, the word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, "Arise, go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words." Then I went down to the potter's house, and behold, he wrought a work on the wheels. And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter, &gt;&gt; still in the hands of the potter. So he made it again another vessel as seemed good to the potter to make it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now Job 23:13, this is Job in his trials. He said he is of in one mind speaking of God who can turn him. Aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now that's comforting when you're in the trial. It's comforting when you're out of the trial, but it's very comforting in the trial. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is in one mind. Who can turn him? Can I turn him? Nope. Can my accusers to turn him? Nope. &gt;&gt; Is there anything to turn him? Nope. He's in one mind. Who can turn him? &gt;&gt; And what his soul desireth, even that he doeth. &gt;&gt; For he perforth the thing that is appointed for me. Amen. &gt;&gt; And many such things are with him. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the prophet prayed this prayer. He said, "Great sculptor, great God who made man and molded him and fashioned him in your image, your own image. I pray thee, Lord, that you'll take us tonight. May this be a memorial night real me memorable to us that tonight Lord tonight here right here in the Stardust Motel. May you mold men into the image of the sons of God. Granite Lord great sculptor. You're the only one can do it. Take your word Lord. Mode it right into the hearts of all of us that we might be masterpiece in the last days and be called the bride of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, see, there's a molding. There's a shaping. &gt;&gt; Yes, he called us to be the the bride of Christ. Yes, he called us to be sons and daughters of God. But now, there's a molding. And he does it by his word. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; We find out that the Bible says the word of the Lord tried Joseph until the time that his word came. So don't don't think for a moment that you can accept the word of the Lord and not be tried by it. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hebrews 10:32 says, "But called to remembrance the former days in which after you were illuminated, you endured a great fight of inflections." &gt;&gt; True. After you were illuminated, after you had received revelation, &gt;&gt; you then endured a great fight of affliction. &gt;&gt; Even when John ate the book, he said, "It was in my mouth, sweet as honey, and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter." &gt;&gt; Brother Bradom says, "See, in his lips, it was sweet." See, when you have to digest it, digest this word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen? Then it gets bitter. &gt;&gt; Everybody's against you. &gt;&gt; Everybody's saying you're a holy roller. You're this, that, or the other. You're off on your head. You're off your head. See, so it's hard to digest it. But when you're testifying of his glory, it's sweet in your lips. &gt;&gt; Have you ever just been discouraged and you're going through the battles and you just start talking about the Lord? something just begins to happen. &gt;&gt; That's true, the Lord. &gt;&gt; You just get excited. You get pumped up. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it it it now it's in your lips and it becomes sweet to you. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; but when you digest it, it becomes bitter. &gt;&gt; You say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; See, so so it it it it's sweet in your lip. That's all. When you stand up in a meeting and you say, "Glory to God." Oh, hallelujah. When you're going through that great siege, it's hard. But then when you're out of that great siege and you can testify of it, then it's sweet in the lips. That's his book of redemption. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, God knows what it's going to take to get me to where he wants me to be. &gt;&gt; He knows what it's going to take to get you to where he wants and ordained you to be. Ain't that right? He He sees the bigger picture. He knows we may not see the big picture, but he sees the bigger picture. &gt;&gt; And and and so therefore, he's not wasting his time with me or he's not wasting his time with you. Uh uh Job's trial was not a waste of God's time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did you know that God already knew that Job wouldn't curse him? Right? &gt;&gt; So, the trial wasn't the fact that, well, I'm going to see if Job will curse me or not. &gt;&gt; God knew that Job wouldn't curse him. &gt;&gt; Satan didn't know. So, Satan thought he had a winning hand. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And God says, "Okay, you do whatever you want to. Don't take his life, but do everything else." &gt;&gt; But God already knew. &gt;&gt; Already knew. But God was going to use this trial to to to to teach Job something. &gt;&gt; That's right. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So, so we find that that God used the the trial to bring Job closer to him. God used it to give Job a better experience of him that one he had known before. For Job 42:5 says, "I have heard of thee went by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye seeth thee." &gt;&gt; Amen. It did not destroy Job. &gt;&gt; It didn't make his faith weaker in God. &gt;&gt; God used the trial to show himself to Job. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Job says in Job 19:25, "I know that my redeemer liveth." Now, you know, he didn't know that. He didn't know that when before the trial. He didn't know that. But something happened to Job. &gt;&gt; In the trial, God began to give him a revelation. And he stands up and says, "I know my redeemer liveth. And he shall stand at the latter day upon this earth." Can you say amen? And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God. for whom I shall see for myself. My eyes shall behold not another though my reigns be consumed within me. &gt;&gt; God used the trial to take all take in purity out of Job. For Job says when he have tried me I shall come forth as pure gold. See so trials are for our benefit. How many believes it? &gt;&gt; Trials are for our benefit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; 1 Peter 1:7 says, "The trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found under praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ." Brother Brown said, "It's it is God giving us these trials." Everybody say, "It's God giving it." &gt;&gt; God given us these trials. After we become his property, our confession, our baptism, our promise to walk in life for him, then every trial that comes upon us is to perfect us for his glory. Is to bring us to a place where God can make himself more real to us than he was before the trial came. Another place he says, why does God let troubles come? God harnesses trouble, puts bits in its mouth, and makes it obey him. And those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with God. There had been no rainbow until the flood came. But after Noah was pressed into that condition that he was in to float 40 days and nights in a storm and the little ark pitching up and down in the water, it was after the flood was over that he saw the rainbow for its first time. The covenant of hope, the covenant of promise. After he had went through the tribulation, then he saw the promise. And that's the way you see the promise. after you've gone through the tribulation. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Tribulation does not take away the promise. It does not take away the covenant. It just allows you to see it more clearly. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; after Abraham went through his trial, the prophet said he spoke face to face with Elohim under the oak that day. It was after he had suffered his trials, after he had went through the troubles that he had went through that God appeared to him in the form of a man and sat there and told him he was married and his wife's name was Sarah and said, she laughed at him in the tent behind him. It was there that Abraham called him Elohim. It was after the trial and tribulation. It wasn't until the Hebrew children was forced into the fiery furnace on one of their most outstanding trials that they seen one like the son of God standing among them. Their troubles produced the son of God standing among them in the breezes to wave away the heat wave. But not until they went into the fire did that comforter appear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was after Daniel was forced to go through a trial. He saw the angel of the Lord standing in the midst of him, that great pill of fire standing between him and the lions. And the lions could not get him because he had went through the trial and tribulation and troubles. Oh, if the church could only wake to itself today to find out that after the troubles and trials and laughs and made fun of the things that the church has been through, the Pentecostal church, that we see God in our midst, doing great signs and wonders. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; It's only God bringing something to us, making himself more real to us. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's one thing to know God by the book and by intellectual knowledge, but it's one thing to go through the experience of knowing him &gt;&gt; and seeing him. Paul says in 2 Corinthians 4:13, "Our light affliction," can you say that with me? Our light affliction light. He calls your affliction, my affliction light. Our light affliction which is but for a moment workketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now one thing the prophet says in all these things Satan tries to make us nervous &gt;&gt; and upset us to get us to think oh why did this happen? Why? Why couldn't I have been made this way? Have you ever just thought of those things? &gt;&gt; Well, why? Why did I do it that? Why? Why? Why? Why couldn't I be someone else? Why do I have to go through these things? It is Satan trying to get you to get nervous. &gt;&gt; Trying to get you to get all anxiety and full of nervousness to where you can't rest in the promises of God. &gt;&gt; God made you the way you are. &gt;&gt; He knows the way you take. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; For he ordained it. &gt;&gt; He ordained that you would receive the message of the hour. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He ordained it that you would take the book and you would eat it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he knew the sufferings that would follow. He knew the afflictions that would come. But be assured, the Lord deliverth every one of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Out of them. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I like what the prophet said. He said God curs or Job cursed the day he was born. So he did curse. &gt;&gt; He cursed the day he was born. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; He said, "May the stars not shine at night, nor the sun by the day, but he wouldn't curse God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Got him to curse the day he was born, but he wouldn't curse God. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "And there, Satan got him right down to the very threadbear moment." The very moment that it just seemed like Job was going to break. And the only thing that Job did was curse the day he was born. &gt;&gt; Oh, do you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we find that it's after that we have suffered a while that Paul would tell us that we would be made perfect. We'd be established, strengthened, and settled. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh God, help us. &gt;&gt; We want to stand, don't we? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I um I think there was um brother Brandham he says you know uh he says those crucial hours that press us onto those sacred sands. It was in the Bible. He said and you remember no matter how great the distress is, Satan cannot take your life until God is finished with you. And there's nothing that can happen to you unless God permits it. There is no evil that can come unless God permits it. And it's for your good &gt;&gt; that he's working that. &gt;&gt; It's for your good. Everybody say, "It's for my good." &gt;&gt; My good. &gt;&gt; So don't be downhearted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's for your good. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he says this. He says, "And if the musicians will come," he said, "When your faith is put to a test, then don't fail. Stay right with what you believe." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't alter. Don't get discouraged. Don't say, "Well, maybe I'm just believing it in vain." Stay right with what you believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's revealed it to you. This message is right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And if you notice that none of the trials that the saints went through in the Bible throughout history, Satan was never able to get them to quit God. &gt;&gt; Never able to get them to give up. Job 23:11, he says, "My foot hath held his steps. His way have I kept and not declined. Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips. I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food." Yep. Satan couldn't get him to curse God. The words of God became life to Joel. It became more dearer and dearer. Can you say amen? I thought of David and the and the troubles and the trials that that man went through and buddy he went through them. &gt;&gt; But Jo or Psalms 42:5 or 42 and1 David said, "As the heart panth after the waterbrook, so penneth my soul after thee, oh God." You didn't find him getting discouraged. You didn't find him wanting to quit. You didn't find him just wanting to get away from everything and just leave God and curse God and deny God. The hunger for God became greater. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God? My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, "Where is thy God?" When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me. For I had gone with a multitude. I had went with them to the house of God with the voice of joy and praise with the multitude that kept holy day. Why art thou cast down, oh my soul? Why art thou disqued in me? Hope thou in God, for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance. Do you have it within you to praise him? Can you lift your hands unto the Lord and praise him? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God is greater than the storms. God is greater than my trials. God is greater. Satan ain't going to get me to curse God. I'm becoming more hungry. I I'm becoming more desirous of him. His word is becoming more precious to me. The promises are becoming more dear to me. The stronger the the the winds come, the the the hotter the fire gets, the more precious God becomes to me. Hallelujah. He knows the way I take. It's a way of life. It's not a way of destruction. It's the way of the righteous. Can you say amen? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. What song? Something keeps holding me [Music] every day. I see. [Music] Helping me faithfully to overcome my trial. [Music] constantly guiding me, giving me victory. [Music] He's a reality. Jesus is holding me. [Music] All the trials of this world was getting closer. Oh, the pull I felt was more than I can bear. Oh, yes it was. And I was on the verge of just giving over. [Laughter] [Music] Oh, of justice within myself. It just wasn't. But as Job said, he gives me strength. Something keeps holding me. Oh, every day I see he's helping me faithfully. It ain't you overcoming yourself. It's not you standing by your own desire, your own will. It's God there that's with you. It's God showing he's there to comfort you. He's there feeding faith in you. He's there sustaining you, preserving you. [Music] Hallelujah. It's a reality. Jesus is holding me. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, Satan laid before me his temptation. Oh, it was his desire to steal away my faith. [Music] Oh, but I have found in time the revelation. Oh, the strength I need to keep me in his grace. Aren't you glad for the strength of God? Oh, something keeps holding me. He's worthy of our praise, church. Hallelujah. He's worthy. Blessed be the name of the Lord. We're going to come through. We're going to come through. Satan will not keep us from the rapture. Satan will not keep us from the promises of God. Hallelujah. I've got a resolve to serve him. I've got a faith that's stronger than yesterday. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Sing it again. Oh, something keeps holding me. Every day I see, helping me faithfully to overcome my trial. Oh, constantly guiding me, keeping. Oh, yes, yes, yes. It's a reality that Jesus is whole. Sing the second verse, shall we? Oh, now Satan laid before me. What a temptation. He laid it before Jesus. He laid it before Eve. He laid it through all the time. Trying to steal away my faith. Hallelujah. Oh, but I have found in time the revel. What are we doing? We're proving we're not like Eve. [Music] All the strength I need to keep me in his grace. Oh, something keeps holding me. Every day I see helping me faithfully to overcome my trial. constantly constantly giving me victory. [Music] He's a reality. Jesus is holding me. [Music] I'm reminded I I think me and brother Tim talking yesterday and I was telling reminded of that story of brother Brandham talking about Billy Paul when Billy just a little baby child and he had it was in the middle of the night sometime and he had to go to the bathroom. He said, "Daddy, I got to go bathroom." He said, ' Okay, just just go down the hall. He said, 'Well, why don't you come with me? He said, 'By, he says, it's baby, it's just right down the hall. You you'll be fine. You're you're okay. He said, I was so tired and weary. And he said, "Oh, Daddy, come on. Come come come with me." So, he Oh, okay. So he got up and Billy grabbed a hold of his hand and they're walking through the dark he stumbled on a toy or something and he fell. I believe that's the way the story went. He got brother Brandham helped him get back up and he looked at at brother Brandham said, "Daddy, why won't you just hold my hand?" And he said, "That's the way it is. We just want God to hold our hand." When we're going through the times of darkness and the times of trouble, God's there just to hold our hand, isn't he? Oh, beholding me. [Music] eternal. [Music] Jesus is holy. Oh, the trial of this world was getting closer. [Music] The pull I felt was more than I could bear. [Music] Oh, and I was on the verge of just giving over. The strength within myself just wasn't there. Oh, but something keeps holding me. Every day I see. Oh, he's helping me faithfully to overcome my trials, [Applause] guiding me constantly, [Music] giving me victory. He's a reality. Jesus is holding me. Oh, something keeps holding me. [Music] Every day I see he's helping me faithfully to overcome my trials. [Music] Oh, guiding me constantly, [Music] giving me victory. Oh, &gt;&gt; it's a reality for Jesus is holding me. &gt;&gt; As they play softly, I very thankful of what God is doing in Sister Martha's life. and um um something that seemed to be horrendous I believe by the hand of God that it's brought it down and and into a mild form of uh what they I guess they would call it cancer a mild form just a just tumor. her. Uh they said that she's had it for years and u so now she's they're wanting her to have this surgery as soon as possible to get this out and um so we want to just keep praying for sister Martha. She's lost a lot of weight and uh very weak and u uh just having to force herself to drink, have to force herself to eat and um it's u it's attached itself to different things, but uh it looked like they're going to have to take part of her colon and they're saying that she'll have to wear a bag possibly. uh you know and and but it's it's I think it's kind of funny that the doctor would say that the devil trying to bring fear but I remind the devil brother David Gadman just had surgery I think yesterday or today I think maybe yesterday where they cut a big part of his colon out the doctor said that they would he would have to have a bag and and uh if not permanently, temporarily, but it looked all doom and gloom and all that. But he gave the testimony today, you don't have to have a bag at all. &gt;&gt; Amen. So take that, devil. &gt;&gt; We will not fear the doctor's report. The doctor knows what he knows, but we know better. We know greater. I was telling brother Andrew, we was talking today. I said, 'You know, it's amazing. This message is the answer. &gt;&gt; It It has the answers to everything. He sent me a quote the other day and you know, we planes falling out of the skies all the time here lately. You know, Brother Brandham talks about that and he says the reason why the planes, he gives the answer as to why the planes are falling out of the sky. I wished I had the quote with me. I'd read it to you. Look it up, though. He gives the answer as to why planes are falling out of the sky. I thought while they're looking all over, people are getting fired left and right. But we got the answer. &gt;&gt; No matter what happens, we got answers. Whether it's in the world, whether it's to our bodies, whether it's in our mind, to our minds, to our trial, whatever, we have the answer. You know, and and you know, I know I've hit psychologists, and I'm sure psychologist does good for other people, but we don't need no psychologist. We got answers. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad to live in a day that we got answers. Thank God for the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Well, God bless you as our prayer. We want to just keep Sister Martha in our prayer. Keep Steve in our prayer. keep uh Sister Alice. Is she doing good? Well, we we certainly want to keep Sister Alice in our prayer and um um keep Brother Amos, Sister Lisa as they're going to be traveling for a few weeks, uh ministering at different churches. And so we want to always keep them in our heart as they are and that God would just bless their trip. You know, we ain't got time to waste. We want to do everything that we can for the kingdom of God, don't we? I mean, we ain't got much time. Y'all heard about the tsunamis. I mean, they're predicting the whole West Coast. I don't know if that's over. I hadn't looked at the news yet or here lately, but they're predicting a tsunami from to Alaska, Hawaii, to the whole west coast of America. An 8.8 earthquake, I think that's what they said, off of Russia. Church, we're close. We're close. Stay in prayer. &gt;&gt; Stay with God. &gt;&gt; Not time to get discouraged. do all you can for the kingdom of God. Can you say amen? Amen. God bless you. Amen. Brother Terry, do you want to dismiss us in prayer? Father God, we have the answer to the devil's question. Thank you, Lord.
