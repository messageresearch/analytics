[42:33] Jesus then uh the next
[42:37] chapter chapter 4 and
[42:40] 14 seeing then that we have a great high
[42:44] priest that has passed into the heavens
[42:48] Jesus the son of God let us hold fast
[42:53] our
[42:54] profession amen you can have your seats
[42:59] tonight I want to continue just talking
[43:03] about our high priest
[43:05] and um I'm truly amazed at the the grace
[43:10] of
[43:12] God
[43:14] um you know that that God has shown to
[43:17] us as as
[43:19] Believers as we know that the the grace
[43:23] of God is something that is UNM merited
[43:27] uh something that um uh we we certainly
[43:31] don't deserve so anything that
[43:34] God provides for us and gives us uh you
[43:40] know is an act of Grace on his part
[43:45] thank Jes anything that he gives us
[43:47] outside of what we deserve it's an act
[43:51] of
[43:52] Grace and I I I tell you you know we we
[43:56] certainly don't deserve anything but
[43:59] hell torment and
[44:02] anguish uh we we we don't deserve
[44:06] anything but but
[44:08] that but the grace of God has
[44:12] been to us and and we are certainly
[44:16] deserving of the worst that God could
[44:19] give and uh which would be the ultimate
[44:23] that uh would be exceeding of of of
[44:28] anything that anybody could do horrific
[44:30] to us right uh uh we we deserve that
[44:34] yeah and we deserve the worst because of
[44:37] sin we're we're Sinners uh born in sin
[44:41] and having a vow nature that was
[44:44] contrary to God against God and uh we
[44:48] have uh we've broken every law that he
[44:53] would have and um because there in James
[44:58] 2:10 it says whosoever shall keep the
[45:01] law or keep the whole law and yet offend
[45:04] in one point then he's a guilty of it
[45:07] all and so we may not have murdered or
[45:11] whatever but just the fact that we've
[45:14] might have told a lie or even a white
[45:16] lie or and and and and you know things
[45:21] that may not even matter to us in the
[45:24] presence of God it it is
[45:27] magnified and so then we find ourselves
[45:30] that we're just guilty we're guilty of
[45:32] it all and in the beginning you know uh
[45:36] that's that's the the the start of of
[45:39] everything is the SE chapter is in
[45:42] Genesis and uh we we see where God had
[45:45] told man now don't eat of of this uh uh
[45:50] forbidden fruit and told him that the
[45:53] day that he would eat of that that would
[45:55] be the the day he would die and so it
[45:59] happened just the way God said it man
[46:02] partook of the tree of knowledge of Good
[46:04] and Evil and and he died and and of
[46:08] course uh Paul would tell us that the
[46:11] wages of sin is death and so we had
[46:15] nothing to look forward to to be honest
[46:17] but but just but but death uh uh because
[46:22] God cannot go back on his word he's
[46:26] infinite he has infinite knowledge and
[46:29] and so uh he's Eternal so brother Bram
[46:33] would say the the way that God acts upon
[46:36] the subjects that accept his decision
[46:39] it'll forever uh act every on every
[46:42] subject that accept his decision that
[46:45] way so if if God uh made a way for man
[46:50] to be saved the first way he made uh
[46:52] then has to ever remain that same way if
[46:56] God promised healing to the sick upon
[46:58] Faith to believe it then it ever Remains
[47:00] the Same see CU he cannot take it back
[47:03] he he must remain uh the the same in in
[47:07] every way ain't that right so so God
[47:10] could not take his word back but there
[47:12] was something something that God uh that
[47:16] CS God and I'm so glad that God is not
[47:19] just a god of Holiness and God of Wrath
[47:22] but he's a he's a god of longsuffering
[47:25] he's a god of patience he's a he's a god
[47:27] of love and the Bible says God is love
[47:32] and so it it would be from from there
[47:35] that God uh uh would seek to have seek a
[47:39] remedy and and it it was that God in the
[47:43] garden accepted a substitute for man and
[47:48] and so this word substitute is to take
[47:51] the place of another to to replace ain't
[47:54] that right that's right so we know that
[47:57] though that this substitute had to be a
[48:00] blood sacrifice it it had to be uh a
[48:04] blood sacrifice that would pay uh for
[48:07] the sins of the people or or pay for sin
[48:10] the price of sin uh God's word cannot be
[48:14] uh uh uh changed uh but he would he
[48:18] would provide a a substitute amen and
[48:22] and and he he didn't want us just to be
[48:24] religious wasn't calling uh uh for a
[48:28] form of godliness but he was he was
[48:31] calling for something that would
[48:34] reconcile us back to God to where that
[48:37] that word of condemnation would be
[48:40] lifted from us and that we could be free
[48:44] to be Sons and Daughters of God Amen so
[48:47] this blood sacrifice amen God says I I I
[48:52] will have that I will you know I will
[48:55] accept accept the blood sacrifice uh uh
[48:58] as a substitute which means that this
[49:02] substitute would be our pardon amen this
[49:06] blood sacrifice would be our pardon
[49:09] ain't that right and and if you listen
[49:12] to the message pardon you know brother
[49:14] brandham talks about this but he says
[49:16] pardon is a release from guilt amen and
[49:20] that's what God sought in and again this
[49:22] is the act of Grace on God's part that
[49:25] God would seek to Pardon you he and and
[49:28] me he he would he would seek for
[49:31] something that that uh would take our
[49:34] place that you and I could could be free
[49:37] ain't that right so the Christian life
[49:39] is not about dos and don'ts the
[49:41] Christian life is not about you know
[49:43] it's not all about uh what we do what we
[49:45] don't how we live and how we dress and
[49:48] and all of these things and what we
[49:50] abstain from and and all these things
[49:53] simply put the the Christian Life life
[49:56] is the result of a man or woman child
[49:59] being pardoned amen you you can't be a
[50:03] Christian without being pardoned amen so
[50:06] God would seek to Pardon us and and and
[50:10] again that would be an an act of Grace
[50:13] something given to us provided to us
[50:17] that we don't deserve ain't that right
[50:20] it's always been the grace of God
[50:22] throughout the Bible uh uh he he even
[50:25] the you know uh I think it was Paul said
[50:28] where sin do abound Grace doth more
[50:30] abound so even down through the law uh
[50:34] uh when when when they chose law over
[50:36] Grace God still provided Grace amen
[50:39] Grace was always with them amen and and
[50:43] so sin uh sin could not obliviate or
[50:47] hide Grace it it it was just the the
[50:50] grace of God ain't that right so we know
[50:53] that Jesus Christ is our sub substitute
[50:56] that God would provide for us and and so
[51:00] even though that God has done everything
[51:03] he could to to to Pardon us and and to
[51:07] provide a pardon well we know that a
[51:10] pardon is not a paron unless accept it
[51:13] as a pardon so so you you have to
[51:16] receive that pardon and I I think that
[51:19] is is important that that not only God
[51:23] would accept the sacrifice but you and I
[51:25] have to accept that sacrifice amen and
[51:28] and so um uh brother bam said you are
[51:31] pardoned the very minute that you accept
[51:34] Jesus Christ as your savior aren't you
[51:36] glad you're pardon amen you you have to
[51:40] accept that God's provided it but now
[51:42] when you accept that sacrifice then you
[51:46] are pardoned amen so so accepting the
[51:50] sacrifice that God provided is very
[51:53] important and and then when we accept
[51:56] the sacrifice then we confess him as our
[51:59] savior we confess him as our healer we
[52:03] confess him as our Lord we confess him
[52:06] as as our deliverer we we we we uh uh
[52:11] confess him as our peace ain't that
[52:13] right because we have identified that he
[52:17] is our substitute and if God will accept
[52:21] it then we must accept it upon that
[52:24] basis ain't that right
[52:25] he is our peace aren't you glad for that
[52:29] he is our joy he is our everything
[52:32] everything that that that sin had laid
[52:35] upon us and we were Afflicted of because
[52:39] of sin our blood sacrifice amen through
[52:42] the pardoning grace took it all away
[52:45] from us that we could accept God's
[52:49] provided place or provided way ain't
[52:53] that right so now now now he becomes the
[52:56] the high priest of our confession amen
[53:00] and I'd like to get into that more uh uh
[53:03] next time of the high priest of our
[53:05] confession but but see God providing a
[53:08] substitute is not just an afterthought
[53:12] uh uh sin come along now God seeson says
[53:15] now now what next you know I I I I got
[53:18] to do something so he provides the The
[53:20] Substitute but the Bible says that Jesus
[53:23] was slain as the L am before the
[53:26] foundation of the world so that tells us
[53:29] that God already knew our condition he
[53:32] already knew that man would fall he
[53:34] already knew it was part of his plan
[53:37] that he already had a provided
[53:40] substitute a sacrifice for you and I
[53:44] amen you know man was not made to die
[53:47] and you know you hear the prophet saying
[53:50] you know that man was not made to go to
[53:52] hell amen and and the hell the the Bible
[53:55] says hell was created for the devil and
[53:57] his angels and and all of these things
[54:00] ain't that right so God knowing that
[54:03] that that that he did not create hell
[54:07] amen for his people and for his elect he
[54:10] would provide a bloody sacrifice God's
[54:13] always one step ahead or probably well
[54:16] we could say a thousand steps ahead of
[54:18] them then than us ain't that right he
[54:21] already knows the end from the beginning
[54:23] it it it in all we have to do is is
[54:26] trust in him but but it's always been
[54:29] blood and the prophet said it was blood
[54:31] in the Old Testament it and it was blood
[54:34] in the New Testament it's it's it's just
[54:36] blood all the way around amen and he
[54:39] said the only way that God receives his
[54:42] children back is by this Blood
[54:46] substitute nothing else will do ain't
[54:49] that right amen so you you would think
[54:51] that every man would be thankful for
[54:54] God's provision Vision uh uh but but
[54:57] that's not so uh because it's in man
[55:00] it's it's that Fallen nature of man to
[55:03] do everything that he can to be part of
[55:06] it he he he wants to have a say in it he
[55:09] wants to have something to do with it
[55:11] and and so that that that's just him and
[55:14] he's always tried to do something on his
[55:17] own outside of God's uh uh uh provided
[55:21] way and therefore he he remains dead and
[55:25] we know what dead means it it means
[55:28] separation so he he remains separated
[55:31] from God and and and he remains without
[55:35] fellowship and peace and contentment and
[55:38] no understanding of God's perfect will
[55:41] amen because he's out of of of he's well
[55:45] he's dead he's separated from God so he
[55:49] cannot see himself in God's promises uh
[55:52] because he's out of Fellowship he's cut
[55:54] off from God ain't that right but see
[55:57] this is why God would provide a pardon
[55:59] for us this is why he would provide a a
[56:03] a a bloody sacrifice for us to have our
[56:06] pardon to come back into fellowship and
[56:09] and and and just going to church don't
[56:11] mean you're in fellowship with God Amen
[56:14] and even just praying don't mean you're
[56:16] in fellowship with God there has to be a
[56:18] heart Union there there has to be some
[56:21] Union that that really takes place a
[56:25] binding of man's soul to God Amen to
[56:28] where there's nothing in the way sin
[56:31] ain't in the way uh condemnation ain't
[56:34] in the way you're actually in fellowship
[56:38] with God Amen conscience of his presence
[56:42] conscience of his awareness can you say
[56:44] man but see man wants to Merit his own
[56:47] way to God and and his Fallen nature
[56:51] causes him to seek his own way just like
[56:53] Adam did amen as soon as he fail and uh
[56:57] uh what does he do he goes after amen
[57:00] trying to uh uh uh uh uh find his own
[57:04] covering sewing fig leaves together uh
[57:07] thinking that it would hide his shame
[57:10] and and if you notice this is why the
[57:12] law came into existence in the first
[57:15] place is because man wanted his own way
[57:19] he he wanted to to to walk with God on
[57:22] his own Merit and his own way he
[57:25] thinking he could peas appease God and
[57:28] and and live good enough to be
[57:30] reconciled to God and and all these
[57:33] things they wanted something to do on
[57:35] their own in the Bible we see that
[57:38] there's two covenants amen uh that God
[57:41] made um uh and and really it was the the
[57:44] conditional Covenant and and the
[57:47] unconditional Covenant and and uh the
[57:50] word testament uh uh means Covenant and
[57:55] and so we've got two uh Testaments the
[57:57] the old uh testament which is is
[58:00] represents or which is the old Covenant
[58:04] the law and we've got the new testament
[58:06] which is the Covenant of Grace it's an
[58:09] unconditional Covenant ain't that right
[58:11] amen so the old Covenant it's a
[58:14] conditional Covenant where where you
[58:16] know the prophet said you know it's like
[58:17] God says if you'll do this then I'll do
[58:19] this and if you do that then I'll do
[58:21] that and and and see it was that way and
[58:24] so this Covenant a conditional Covenant
[58:27] came about because man wanted to enter
[58:31] into partnership with with God and and
[58:35] so again he wanted to something to do on
[58:38] his own that he could Merit his way to
[58:41] God Amen but then there's that New
[58:43] Covenant amen which is the unconditional
[58:47] Covenant and and uh uh it's it's an
[58:50] unconditional Covenant and it is
[58:53] guaranteed it by say it's
[58:56] guaranteed this Covenant is guaranteed
[58:59] to us because it's
[59:03] unconditional ain't that right it's
[59:05] unconditional and being that is it is
[59:08] unconditional Covenant then it's not
[59:11] based upon what we do or what we don't
[59:14] do it's solely an act of Grace on God's
[59:18] part this unconditional Covenant God
[59:22] made with us knowing that we could not
[59:25] keep he tried to keep uh uh have a a
[59:29] conditional Covenant with man and every
[59:31] time that God would make a conditional
[59:33] Covenant with man it would be broken and
[59:36] it would not be broken on God's part it
[59:39] was always man breaking his own Covenant
[59:43] can you say amen amen see but this
[59:46] unconditional Covenant is based upon
[59:49] what God would do himself amen now look
[59:53] and and this show shows God's de
[59:55] determination and desire amen for you
[59:58] and I to walk with him amen and and uh
[1:00:02] uh in Genesis 3:15 God said I I will see
[1:00:06] put enity between thee and and the uh
[1:00:09] the woman and between thy seed and her
[1:00:12] seed and it shall bruise thy head and
[1:00:14] thou shalt bruise his heel ain't that
[1:00:17] right God see and and the prophet said
[1:00:19] right there God was promising amen a
[1:00:22] redeemer he already knew how that
[1:00:25] Redeemer was going to come and it wasn't
[1:00:27] up to woman it wasn't up to man to to
[1:00:30] produce a redeemer God promised he would
[1:00:32] bring it God produced it ain't that
[1:00:35] right but he said to Noah in Genesis
[1:00:37] 9:11 I will establish my Covenant with
[1:00:41] you he said to Abraham in Genesis 12:2 I
[1:00:45] will make thee a great nation and and I
[1:00:48] will bless thee and make thy name great
[1:00:51] and thou shalt be a blessing God said in
[1:00:54] Genesis
[1:00:55] 13:16 I will make thy seed as the dust
[1:00:58] of the earth so that if a man can number
[1:01:01] the dust of the earth then shall thy
[1:01:03] seed also be numbered arise and walk
[1:01:06] through the land in the length of it and
[1:01:08] in the breadth of it for I will give it
[1:01:12] unto thee and of Sarah he said I will
[1:01:15] bless her and give her give thee a son
[1:01:19] also of her yay I will bless her and she
[1:01:23] shall be a mother of Nations and kings
[1:01:26] of people shall be of her ain't that
[1:01:29] right on and on throughout the Bible we
[1:01:32] see that God was promising I will do it
[1:01:35] I will perform I have spoken I have said
[1:01:39] it can you say amen amen I will sin amen
[1:01:43] see so therefore amen God never
[1:01:46] obligated us to any promise that he made
[1:01:50] he just made us the
[1:01:52] beneficiary of the promise Pro can you
[1:01:55] say man he made us the beneficiary he's
[1:01:58] the one that said I will send unto you
[1:02:00] Elijah the prophet we never knew we
[1:02:02] needed a prophet amen we had no uh
[1:02:06] desire for a prophet we weren't praying
[1:02:08] for a prophet amen we we didn't deserve
[1:02:11] a prophet but the prophet says God by
[1:02:14] his grace always sends a prophet when a
[1:02:17] prophet comes on the scene it's the act
[1:02:19] of God's grace to a people ain't that
[1:02:23] right that God promised it so so see
[1:02:26] everything amen that God promised ye
[1:02:29] we're looking at it now he's already
[1:02:31] done it amen think of it in this age
[1:02:34] we're looking back at Calvary and every
[1:02:37] promise that he has fulfilled Amen to
[1:02:40] bring a people to Redemption he's
[1:02:42] already done it amen we're looking at
[1:02:45] Christ based upon the finished works of
[1:02:49] Calvary aren't you glad for
[1:02:51] that now think of it it's not that we're
[1:02:54] waiting for him to do it go go look look
[1:02:57] at it he done it really before the
[1:02:59] foundation of the world the lamb was
[1:03:01] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:03:04] ain't that right and and and it was on
[1:03:07] God's desire God's part it was it was
[1:03:10] his love it was his desire we didn't
[1:03:13] have a choice I I didn't even exist a
[1:03:16] you didn't even exist you weren't even
[1:03:18] allowed to vote for it brother Amos that
[1:03:20] God had already taken care of it amen
[1:03:23] for the Bible says he predestinated us
[1:03:27] amen ain't that right those he fornew he
[1:03:30] predestinated and those he predestinated
[1:03:32] he called and though he called he
[1:03:34] justified and them that he justified
[1:03:36] he's already glorified can you say Amen
[1:03:40] see so why would God now if he's already
[1:03:44] taken care of it then why would he put
[1:03:46] us on a conditional Covenant because a
[1:03:49] conditional Covenant can never guarantee
[1:03:52] you amen into heaven it will never
[1:03:54] guarantee you of any promise of God Amen
[1:03:58] but he done it based upon an
[1:04:00] unconditional Covenant he purposed
[1:04:03] within himself to see you
[1:04:06] through praise the Lord praise the Lord
[1:04:09] so a conditional Covenant can be broken
[1:04:12] but an unconditional Covenant is one
[1:04:14] that cannot be
[1:04:15] broken ain't that right for the Bible
[1:04:18] says God is not a man that he should lie
[1:04:20] or nor the son of man that he should
[1:04:22] repent another place it is impossible
[1:04:24] for God to lie ain't that right so the
[1:04:27] prophet said see God turned men and
[1:04:29] women back to the dust of the Earth from
[1:04:31] where they came see they go right back
[1:04:33] and someday he's promised everybody say
[1:04:35] he's promised amen he he it the
[1:04:38] situation does not matter with God he
[1:04:42] promised amen that that again to redeem
[1:04:47] that body back to its original state he
[1:04:50] will do it everybody say he will do it
[1:04:53] God will do
[1:04:55] it oh my doesn't matter if they're just
[1:04:58] a pile of Ashes God will restore that
[1:05:01] body doesn't matter if they're just dust
[1:05:04] and there ain't no bones left a sign a
[1:05:06] trace of human amen but God will bring
[1:05:09] that body back amen because he promised
[1:05:12] to bring it yes sir nothing's impossible
[1:05:16] amen that's why he can make an
[1:05:18] unconditional Covenant with you cuz he
[1:05:21] he's a god of imp that works an impossib
[1:05:24] ities he's over everything all he has to
[1:05:28] do is speak his
[1:05:31] word that's right yes sir for him to
[1:05:34] make an unconditional Covenant with you
[1:05:36] shows that he don't need help he don't
[1:05:39] need the the president's help he don't
[1:05:41] needs King's help he doesn't need
[1:05:43] government's help he doesn't need them
[1:05:46] to to to to lower the prices on the gas
[1:05:49] and the food and and the rent and all of
[1:05:51] that to take care of you God can provide
[1:05:53] it when there's no other way to have for
[1:05:55] it to happen true and he made an
[1:05:58] unconditional
[1:06:00] Covenant amen that's good anytime that
[1:06:04] God makes this unconditional Covenant
[1:06:06] it's always broken this this this
[1:06:09] conditional Covenant right but the
[1:06:11] prophet said God God God made an
[1:06:14] unconditional Covenant because he
[1:06:16] determined to save man praise the Lord
[1:06:19] aren't you glad that he's
[1:06:21] determined he's he's more determined
[1:06:23] than you
[1:06:25] are amen amen so it's a Grace Covenant
[1:06:30] so in in that Covenant God provided a
[1:06:33] substitute not not law but but in that
[1:06:37] unconditional Covenant God would provide
[1:06:40] a substitute which which is God
[1:06:44] incarnated in Jesus Christ praise the
[1:06:47] Lord ain't that right see the law being
[1:06:49] a conditional covenant could not
[1:06:51] guarantee us to any promise of God as
[1:06:54] we've said before for it had no saving
[1:06:57] power the prophet said it only makes us
[1:06:59] sinners it condemned us put us in prison
[1:07:02] and could not take us out amen the
[1:07:05] prophet says the law says you are a
[1:07:06] sinner Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt
[1:07:08] not commit adultery thou shallal not
[1:07:09] bear false witness see it's a policeman
[1:07:12] that says you're wrong and you're
[1:07:16] guilty ain't that right but it doesn't
[1:07:18] only just say you're guilty it actually
[1:07:21] puts you into prison with no of coming
[1:07:25] out ain't that right so through this
[1:07:29] conditional Covenant of of of of the law
[1:07:32] it's it's hard to see predestination and
[1:07:35] election uh see When sin is magnified
[1:07:38] and that's exactly what law done is it
[1:07:41] just magnified sin and we we we we
[1:07:44] understood that we're Sinners by
[1:07:47] law ain't that right see and and so so
[1:07:51] and and it's the law that is what Mak
[1:07:54] the Pharisees and Sadducees it it's it's
[1:07:56] the law that is what blinded their eyes
[1:07:59] and caused them to crucify the Messiah
[1:08:02] it it's the law that calls them not to
[1:08:04] recognize their day of visitation ain't
[1:08:07] that right because they were trying to
[1:08:09] do something on their own God was
[1:08:11] providing it all the way through if they
[1:08:13] would have just Ste with Grace amen and
[1:08:16] just watch God move for them it would
[1:08:18] have been easy for them to receive
[1:08:21] Messiah when he came but they were so up
[1:08:24] in their ideas and their uh
[1:08:27] denominations and their Theology and
[1:08:29] their own works and their own way of
[1:08:32] doing things that when God would provide
[1:08:35] by Grace they they they totally missed
[1:08:38] it there a Prophet says in this Grace
[1:08:41] Covenant there is absolutely no law
[1:08:43] whatsoever
[1:08:45] right the Grace Covenant has no law in
[1:08:49] it at all he said can you sayen the Lord
[1:08:53] so see I I I didn't have to you didn't
[1:08:57] have to produce
[1:08:59] anything but God through this
[1:09:02] unconditional Covenant provided it
[1:09:04] praise the lord it's it's through this
[1:09:06] Covenant of Grace that produced Jesus
[1:09:08] Christ praise the Lord law didn't it was
[1:09:11] the Covenant of Grace can you say man
[1:09:15] and and not only did it produce Jesus
[1:09:17] Christ it has produced a bride for Jesus
[1:09:20] Christ in this day Miss Jesus Christ
[1:09:24] it's a miracle that you exist in this
[1:09:26] age but Grace done
[1:09:28] it it's not just a name that is tagged
[1:09:31] upon us it's a
[1:09:35] reality you realize how special you are
[1:09:38] no one can produce a Miss Jesus Christ
[1:09:41] not even
[1:09:43] yourself amen look at even your faults
[1:09:45] and your failures and and everything
[1:09:48] goes against
[1:09:51] it but Grace produced it
[1:09:55] dou on
[1:09:57] now under the old Covenant there was the
[1:10:01] little levitical or ironic priesthood as
[1:10:04] we've said and no man could be a
[1:10:08] priest unless he was of the tribe of Le
[1:10:11] Levi and they were priests by
[1:10:14] lineage and so uh uh and these men had
[1:10:19] to be holy uh in in very strict and in
[1:10:23] things but they didn't have to be called
[1:10:26] they didn't have to be ordained to it
[1:10:28] per se uh um you know they just had to
[1:10:33] be of a lineage of the tribe of
[1:10:36] Levi and and it and it just became um
[1:10:41] something that that it was just
[1:10:42] automatically done and and it just
[1:10:45] become a tradition just become a thing
[1:10:47] well I'm a you know and just like maybe
[1:10:50] some of people think well just because
[1:10:52] my dad's a preacher I'm going to make it
[1:10:53] or or even even you know we could even
[1:10:56] go to a prophet's children you know they
[1:11:00] got to have a birth just like a prophet
[1:11:02] did see there's no lineage in this thing
[1:11:05] you understand what I'm saying no
[1:11:07] lineage my children's got to have a new
[1:11:08] birth just like everybody else does and
[1:11:11] I had to have a new birth just like my
[1:11:13] dad did it ain't lineage on Amen and and
[1:11:17] and so but these priests were by lineage
[1:11:20] and and and yet even though they they
[1:11:23] were require ired to be perfect in that
[1:11:25] they kept the law and everything on the
[1:11:28] outside yet they they were men that had
[1:11:31] infirmity and and Hebrews 7:28 Paul
[1:11:35] would tell us the law maketh men High
[1:11:37] priests which have infirmity and and
[1:11:40] they had to offer sacrifices not only
[1:11:43] for the sins of the people but they had
[1:11:44] to offer sacrifices even for themselves
[1:11:48] because it was just a priesthood of men
[1:11:51] can you say Amen but but Paul would show
[1:11:54] the the difference in in the two
[1:11:56] priesthoods of of of the the levitical
[1:11:59] and and then Christ as as our high
[1:12:02] priest uh there and and Hebrews 7:23 and
[1:12:08] they they were uh they truly were many
[1:12:10] priests because they were not suffered
[1:12:13] to continue by reason of death but this
[1:12:15] man because he continueth forever ha an
[1:12:20] unchangeable priesthood notice wherefore
[1:12:24] he is able to
[1:12:27] save
[1:12:29] uh also to save them to the uttermost
[1:12:32] that come into unto God by him seeing
[1:12:36] that he ever liveth to make intercession
[1:12:39] for him now this is the scriptures is it
[1:12:42] not he liveth and abideth forever and
[1:12:46] because he liveth and abideth forever
[1:12:49] he's able to save to the uttermost even
[1:12:51] to this layot ofy and a
[1:12:54] then what a slap into God's face when
[1:12:57] they say the days of Miracles is over
[1:13:00] and and the days of healing and and the
[1:13:03] Holy Ghost and and and the power of God
[1:13:06] Amen is is over if it's over then he has
[1:13:11] been finished but he's not dead and
[1:13:14] that's the message of the hour is to
[1:13:16] prove that Jesus Christ is still the
[1:13:19] same yesterday today and forever and
[1:13:23] we've got a promise that he's able to
[1:13:25] save to the uttermost it doesn't matter
[1:13:28] how low you are it doesn't matter how
[1:13:30] Fallen your children are he's able to
[1:13:33] save because he's the same
[1:13:37] God he ever
[1:13:39] liveth it doesn't change priesthoods
[1:13:42] with him amen can you say Amen come on
[1:13:45] now and notice he ever liveth everybody
[1:13:49] say he ever liveth ever live to make
[1:13:51] intercession for them make inter he ever
[1:13:54] liveth to make intercession for him one
[1:13:57] day you could in the levitical maybe you
[1:13:59] had a good priest that really took it to
[1:14:01] heart and maybe the other when he passed
[1:14:04] his son would come along and he really
[1:14:06] didn't take it to heart he was just kind
[1:14:07] of SPO he was just he would rather be
[1:14:09] the carpenter he would rather be out on
[1:14:11] the lake fishing or whatever but he had
[1:14:13] to maintain because he was of the
[1:14:14] lineage of Levi ain't that right so so
[1:14:19] he didn't take things to heart you
[1:14:21] understand what I'm saying but Christ
[1:14:23] took you to
[1:14:26] heart that's right now he maketh he ever
[1:14:29] liveth to make intercession for them the
[1:14:31] Greek daglock says to interpose on their
[1:14:35] behalf praise the Lord he lives to
[1:14:38] interpose on their behalf and and I
[1:14:40] looked up this word interpose it means
[1:14:43] to put oneself in between to intrude to
[1:14:48] put forth by way of interference to
[1:14:51] introduce or throw into between the
[1:14:53] parts of an argument see or conversation
[1:14:56] so you got two people amen that are at
[1:14:59] odds with one another and and of course
[1:15:01] that would be us and God ain't that
[1:15:03] right and you know we're going to be on
[1:15:05] that receiving end more than he's going
[1:15:06] to be on the receiving end you can you
[1:15:08] can cuss God curse God deny God whatever
[1:15:11] amen but when all when it's said and
[1:15:13] done he's got the final say ain't that
[1:15:16] right amen and just about when we were
[1:15:18] to feel his wrath and and all of these
[1:15:21] things then God provides a high priest
[1:15:25] that would interject
[1:15:28] himself
[1:15:30] hallelujah praise the Lord maybe you
[1:15:33] don't believe that but he
[1:15:35] does the
[1:15:37] Lord he puts himself between God and us
[1:15:41] and begins to mediate for us
[1:15:44] amen hello yes sir yes sir come on and
[1:15:50] this is one that knows the law he knows
[1:15:52] the book he knows the the word amen he
[1:15:55] knows what has been promised could you
[1:15:57] imagine someone that didn't know the
[1:15:59] promises trying to mediate on your
[1:16:01] behalf sister
[1:16:04] Brenda now there's a lot of times we
[1:16:06] don't know the word of God there's a lot
[1:16:09] of times we don't understand things we
[1:16:11] Satan will mess with our mind but
[1:16:13] there's one that intercedes for us sure
[1:16:16] can you
[1:16:17] amen and so therefore Because He Lives
[1:16:20] there's no need for another priesthood
[1:16:22] to rise up we we don't need another
[1:16:23] sacrifice we don't need another priest
[1:16:26] and and and these things he is able to
[1:16:29] accomplish that which the levitical
[1:16:32] priesthood could not do ain't that right
[1:16:36] amen see so so as we know that the
[1:16:38] levitical priesthood and I'll try to
[1:16:40] hurry here but they had to keep offering
[1:16:42] sacrifices because the sacrifices they
[1:16:45] offered was not sufficient enough to to
[1:16:48] redeem man uh uh therefore that that
[1:16:51] priesthood of men it was a carnal
[1:16:53] priesthood and and it it it had to be
[1:16:56] abolished ain't that right sinful men uh
[1:16:59] uh there but but but we find that the
[1:17:02] the shadows and the symbols and it
[1:17:04] served its purpose until till the the
[1:17:08] anti-tip if we could say it that way the
[1:17:10] substitute was manifested and and then
[1:17:14] Paul would tell us in Hebrews 7:2 for
[1:17:16] the priesthood being changed there is
[1:17:19] made of necessity a change also of the
[1:17:23] all now the Amplified Bible would tell
[1:17:25] us this way when there is a change in
[1:17:28] the priesthood there is of necess
[1:17:31] necessity a change of the law concerning
[1:17:35] the priesthood as well ain't that right
[1:17:38] amen see so so God would set the whole
[1:17:42] uh uh ju Judaism I guess we could say it
[1:17:46] that way aside when the substitute uh uh
[1:17:50] true came and and and uh so so so then
[1:17:54] Paul would tell us it is evident that
[1:17:56] our Lord sprang out of
[1:17:59] Judah ain't that right which of which
[1:18:03] tribes Moses spake nothing concerning
[1:18:06] the priesthood so it tells us that he
[1:18:09] isn't a priest by a a The Works of a
[1:18:12] natural man amen that there isn't any
[1:18:16] man any human that could lay claim to
[1:18:19] his
[1:18:21] existence ain't that right amen see now
[1:18:25] we we look and and just just look here
[1:18:28] uh 2 Corinthians
[1:18:30] 5:21 he he he hath made him to be sin
[1:18:34] for us who knew no sin ain't that right
[1:18:37] 1 Peter 2:22 he did no sin neither was G
[1:18:41] found in his mouth who when he was
[1:18:44] reviled reviled not again when he
[1:18:47] suffered he threatened not went but
[1:18:49] committed himself to him that judgeth
[1:18:51] righteously who his own bear uh his own
[1:18:56] self bear our sins in his own body on
[1:18:59] the tree that being dead to send should
[1:19:02] live under righteousness by whose
[1:19:04] stripes we were healed you were healed
[1:19:08] ain't that right 1 John 3 and5 you know
[1:19:11] that he was manifested to take away our
[1:19:14] sins and in him is no sin what a what a
[1:19:18] different
[1:19:19] priesthood can you say man he he wasn't
[1:19:23] of a lineage of of just common born men
[1:19:27] there was no sin attached to him amen
[1:19:30] ain't that right the prophet Isaiah
[1:19:33] cried out he took our infirmity and bear
[1:19:35] our sickness see so he having no
[1:19:39] infirmities amen yet took our
[1:19:42] infirmities and nailed them as Paul
[1:19:45] would say to his cross ain't that right
[1:19:48] therefore he bore the likeness of
[1:19:51] MDC Glory ain't that right for he was
[1:19:56] MDC made
[1:19:59] flesh hlj ain't that right amen that's
[1:20:02] right see so so he was not only the word
[1:20:05] the prophet said but he was the high
[1:20:07] priest of his own
[1:20:09] word God was the high priest of his own
[1:20:14] word interceding over every promise he
[1:20:18] made for you right no wonder he can make
[1:20:21] it unconditional yeah come on now can
[1:20:25] you say
[1:20:26] Amen levitical priesthood was made up of
[1:20:29] men under the law as we talked about
[1:20:32] legalist carnal Commandments the law
[1:20:34] said Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not
[1:20:36] steal Thou shalt not commit adultery
[1:20:38] Thou shalt not Thou shalt not it you see
[1:20:42] and and and therefore uh it it was it
[1:20:45] was uh uh uh carnal Commandments the
[1:20:48] prophet said legalism legalist and that
[1:20:50] that's what these high priests come out
[1:20:52] of of is is they were made of carnal
[1:20:55] Commandments but Christ was not can you
[1:20:57] say Amen you know I know personally
[1:20:59] people that that that they they're in
[1:21:02] just the legalism you know they don't
[1:21:04] believe in wearing the Rings you know
[1:21:06] they they don't believe that you know
[1:21:07] man or a woman could wear a ring they
[1:21:08] don't believe a woman should wear a
[1:21:10] necklace they don't believe a man you
[1:21:11] know can wear short sleeve men have to
[1:21:13] wear long sleeves can't have a beard and
[1:21:16] and it just on and on and on you know
[1:21:19] there there's no limit to the laws that
[1:21:21] man will imp on us you know just
[1:21:24] thinking of here just in the message you
[1:21:26] know you know it it gets around you know
[1:21:29] you get you get just funny people if a
[1:21:31] gospel song is written that that isn't
[1:21:33] you know that's written by some
[1:21:34] unconverted guy out there then it
[1:21:37] shouldn't be sung in the church you know
[1:21:39] there are those who believe that if a
[1:21:41] song isn't an old hymn then it shouldn't
[1:21:43] be sung in the worship service you know
[1:21:45] it all needs to be old hyms and and you
[1:21:48] know you can't have certain instruments
[1:21:50] in the church and they can't be fast
[1:21:51] songs sung in in the church because it's
[1:21:53] just working people up but you know what
[1:21:56] it all is it's legalism it just come
[1:21:59] legalism legalism legalism and before
[1:22:01] you know it you got people fighting
[1:22:03] nitpicking they can't come to church to
[1:22:05] enjoy the service because they have set
[1:22:08] themselves to be one that was let's see
[1:22:10] what they're going to do next you know
[1:22:11] and I'm going to let them know about it
[1:22:13] you know and it just becomes a a a hey
[1:22:16] we we come out of all that see so we I
[1:22:18] know what I'm talking about but what
[1:22:20] happens if we give an inch to that kind
[1:22:22] of the spirit see well then what happens
[1:22:25] it dictates the church to where the
[1:22:27] people can't be free we we lose the fact
[1:22:30] that there's promises we lose the fact
[1:22:32] that God saved us by his grace we lose
[1:22:35] the fact that God is the one that have
[1:22:37] preeminent over his elect amen we lose
[1:22:41] the fact that it's not me that's keeping
[1:22:43] the church it's God that's keeping the
[1:22:46] church God keeping the church you see
[1:22:49] why because the the the church isn't
[1:22:51] made up of law
[1:22:53] right can you say man Christ wasn't made
[1:22:55] up of of law of the carnal Commandments
[1:22:58] and neither is the church made up of law
[1:23:01] of carnal Commandments amen see see so
[1:23:05] so notice now there had to be a change
[1:23:08] for the law made nothing
[1:23:11] perfect I've thought of that the the
[1:23:14] priesthood wasn't perfect the sacrifice
[1:23:16] wasn't perfect the the Tabernacle wasn't
[1:23:19] perfect the the blood wasn't perfect in
[1:23:22] that it wasn't sufficient ain't that
[1:23:24] right but here God had already swore and
[1:23:27] he promised that he would redeem a
[1:23:30] people he promised that he would take a
[1:23:32] people back with him he already promised
[1:23:35] that there's going to be
[1:23:36] Millennium look at Isaiah he he talks
[1:23:39] about the
[1:23:40] Millennium can you say amen he swore
[1:23:43] that he would have a church without spot
[1:23:45] wrinkle or blemish he swore that his
[1:23:46] people would be perfect and that he
[1:23:49] would be the one to perfect them right
[1:23:51] the Lord yeah can you say Amen so they
[1:23:54] wouldn't have to face his wrath that's
[1:23:56] coming upon the Earth brother this the
[1:23:58] wrath of God is is is is coming it it's
[1:24:02] approaching and it is very
[1:24:05] real can you say Amen we're not making
[1:24:09] lie of that but one thing about it we've
[1:24:11] been
[1:24:13] cleansed we've got a blood sacrifice
[1:24:16] that took away the
[1:24:18] sins amen oh aren't you glad for that
[1:24:22] amen
[1:24:23] see God see God predestinated Christ to
[1:24:25] be the bloody
[1:24:27] sacrifice and he was predestinated to be
[1:24:29] our great high priest and what was he
[1:24:32] then he was not made up of a natural
[1:24:34] lineage he was made up of the word of
[1:24:36] God do you believe that God created his
[1:24:40] own blood cell and would be powerful and
[1:24:43] and sufficient enough to save every one
[1:24:48] of his elect Lord save us completely can
[1:24:52] you amen prise the Lord uh Hebrews 7:18
[1:24:56] it says by so much was Jesus made a
[1:24:59] shity of a better
[1:25:01] Covenant Jesus was made the high priest
[1:25:05] of a better Covenant amen aren't you
[1:25:07] glad for thaten the Greek daglock says
[1:25:10] that Jesus has become a pledge of a
[1:25:13] better Covenant amen God pledged him
[1:25:17] amen that's right amen swore by himself
[1:25:21] and there was Christ yeah amen ain't
[1:25:23] that right so we find that Jesus now
[1:25:27] Christ is the mediator of a better
[1:25:29] Covenant which was established upon
[1:25:32] better promises ain't that right a
[1:25:35] better Covenant because it's an
[1:25:37] unconditional Covenant it's a perfect
[1:25:40] Covenant a perfect sacrifice a perfect
[1:25:43] blood that has brought forth a perfect
[1:25:47] loosening and it's all based upon
[1:25:50] predestination not b based upon what you
[1:25:53] do or what you don't do it's based upon
[1:25:55] predestination what God predestinated
[1:25:57] you to be Lord do you think of that
[1:26:01] now God called you before the foundation
[1:26:03] of the world he ordained you then he
[1:26:06] justified you then right glorified you
[1:26:09] then he's already had a predestinated
[1:26:13] end for you
[1:26:14] then can you amen and notice the
[1:26:18] Covenant the prophet said was written
[1:26:20] with his own blood right
[1:26:23] and then he goes into the presence of
[1:26:24] the father packing his own
[1:26:27] blood can you say Amen Allelujah yes sir
[1:26:32] amen you know in the days of Paul there
[1:26:35] were people who struggled to let go of
[1:26:38] the old and come into the
[1:26:41] new and he was trying to tell them there
[1:26:44] in Hebrews that that the the church had
[1:26:47] turned a
[1:26:48] corner and and um you know a lot of them
[1:26:53] wouldn't receive it
[1:26:56] but especially the Jewish the Jewish
[1:26:59] people they refuse to to turn the corner
[1:27:03] yeah and today uh the church has turned
[1:27:06] another Corner amen very important to
[1:27:10] understand
[1:27:11] that uh because you see the message is
[1:27:14] not dealing with the old ways of of
[1:27:17] churchianity Amen the message is not
[1:27:20] dealing with uh the ways of LA and
[1:27:23] legalism as brother brandham said this
[1:27:25] is the message of Grace and if you you
[1:27:28] go listen to the title of that is the
[1:27:31] message of Grace and listen to what he
[1:27:34] has to say it's the grace of God and
[1:27:37] that when The Headstone comes down the
[1:27:40] people would be crying Grace Grace unto
[1:27:43] The Headstone amen but it it it it was
[1:27:47] God turning the corner for the church
[1:27:49] can you say Amen see God God the prophet
[1:27:53] said is finished with the church ages do
[1:27:55] you believe that see so the days of
[1:27:57] signing our name on the church card are
[1:27:59] over the the the days of uh shaking a
[1:28:02] preacher's hand and and and joining the
[1:28:05] church that's that's over the days of
[1:28:07] being baptized into the church is over e
[1:28:11] every Creed and every uh uh Dogma that
[1:28:14] was put upon us that we would accept to
[1:28:17] be saved or to be considered a Christian
[1:28:21] amen that's old over the denominational
[1:28:23] ages have run out can you say Amen the
[1:28:27] prophet said now what made the
[1:28:29] denominations in the first place he says
[1:28:31] well one group picks up a little
[1:28:33] Doctrine and they run off to the side
[1:28:34] with it and say this is it another group
[1:28:37] picks up another doctorine and they run
[1:28:39] off to the side and says well this is it
[1:28:41] see and each one he says has built a
[1:28:44] denomination under it until we got
[1:28:46] hundreds of denomination and it's left
[1:28:49] nothing but the people confused to where
[1:28:52] they don't know what to believe can you
[1:28:54] say amen amen they they believe in in
[1:28:56] purgatory that is never in the Bible
[1:28:59] they believe in intercession of saints
[1:29:01] that's never in the Bible they believe
[1:29:02] in priests and popes and and and and and
[1:29:06] Bishops and and Cardinals and and and
[1:29:09] hierarchies and headquarters and this
[1:29:11] and that it's never been written in this
[1:29:14] Bible can you sayen it's been a dictate
[1:29:17] of men ruling over the people but the
[1:29:20] days of that is over thank the
[1:29:27] Lord can you say Amen thank you Lord
[1:29:31] Jesus that was the seven Church ages
[1:29:34] yeah and they represented The Seven
[1:29:36] Feast
[1:29:37] days brother Brian said there were seven
[1:29:40] feast days that represented the seven
[1:29:42] Church ages ain't that right yes now I
[1:29:44] have to be careful with this but you go
[1:29:46] listen to the Future home of the Earthly
[1:29:49] bride and Heavenly bridegroom amen
[1:29:52] brother Brown talks about the days and
[1:29:54] and and of course there's many uh weird
[1:29:57] do men men have come up with all kinds
[1:29:59] of doctrines with this but never the
[1:30:01] fact we would never know we would never
[1:30:04] know the eighth day that there was an
[1:30:06] eighth day for us if it had not been a
[1:30:08] prophet that would bring this so we must
[1:30:11] not shy from it right because men have
[1:30:15] turned it into all kinds of things and
[1:30:17] we understand you know that we're not in
[1:30:20] the Millennium right now
[1:30:22] hello but go back and listen to what
[1:30:24] brother Brown says about the eth day and
[1:30:26] and just go all the way through that
[1:30:28] that it's three hours long I think but
[1:30:30] go listen to it and just keep listening
[1:30:32] to it and listen to it there there is so
[1:30:34] much there that is promised to us and
[1:30:37] about our future and all these things
[1:30:39] but but brother Brandon brought out the
[1:30:41] scripture in Leviticus where it talks
[1:30:42] about the Holy convocation being the
[1:30:45] Eighth Day and remember he runs out of
[1:30:47] sevens and and and brother someone he
[1:30:49] said well you you might say well brother
[1:30:51] brand You' run out of sevens what are we
[1:30:53] going to do he goes oh no you know
[1:30:54] you've run out of days or whatever and
[1:30:56] he says oh no I haven't and he takes us
[1:30:58] back to Leviticus and he begins to read
[1:31:01] about the Holy convocation on the eighth
[1:31:03] day ain't that right well what is the
[1:31:06] Eighth Day and and he says it he goes
[1:31:08] well there's no we we all know that
[1:31:10] there's seven days in a week so there is
[1:31:12] no Eighth Day so he says the eighth day
[1:31:14] takes us all the way back to the first
[1:31:17] day right ain't that right and he says
[1:31:20] now what seven days
[1:31:22] which means pass away seven days have
[1:31:25] passed away he says see I have said
[1:31:28] we'll change to another eight days
[1:31:31] everybody say eight days deals with New
[1:31:34] Creation not old creation eight days is
[1:31:39] New
[1:31:40] Creation now in the Old Testament
[1:31:43] brother brand tells us that that Israel
[1:31:45] went through seven Church ages they went
[1:31:48] through seven days seven Church ages but
[1:31:51] at that at end when they run out there
[1:31:55] stood a new
[1:31:57] creation true the Old Law had passed
[1:32:01] away the old levitical priesthood passed
[1:32:04] away every the blood sacrifice as far as
[1:32:07] the natural sacrifices the natural
[1:32:09] priest and the natural Temple and the
[1:32:11] natural altar all of that passed away
[1:32:14] there was a new creation Jesus Christ
[1:32:18] God
[1:32:20] incarnate that's right can you say
[1:32:24] Amen the old passed away and a new
[1:32:29] creation knew he was not of the old
[1:32:32] creation he was the creation of God
[1:32:35] himself the prophet said God was made
[1:32:36] flesh and dwelt Among Us in another
[1:32:39] place God the Creator created the blood
[1:32:41] cell in the womb of that woman knowing
[1:32:44] no man by seexual desire what a
[1:32:47] different priest can you say Amen see
[1:32:51] see so he says see and that blood cell
[1:32:54] developed into the man which was the son
[1:32:56] of God and through that unadulterated
[1:32:58] blood of the Son of God creative blood
[1:33:01] by Jehovah without sexual desire through
[1:33:04] the shedding of that blood on calvary's
[1:33:06] Cross redeems us from sin and sickness
[1:33:10] it was a new Dawning a new day a
[1:33:13] Dawning God was able to abolish the old
[1:33:17] by a new
[1:33:19] creation amen
[1:33:22] another place he says the great Jehovah
[1:33:24] came down and was made tangible by
[1:33:26] living in the body of his own son
[1:33:28] declaring and reconciling the world to
[1:33:31] himself God was nothing Christ was
[1:33:33] nothing short of God and God was nothing
[1:33:35] short of Christ the two together made
[1:33:38] the godhead bodily made a little lower
[1:33:40] than the angel so that he could suffer
[1:33:43] Angels cannot suffer Jesus was the
[1:33:45] tabernacle that God dwelt in aren't you
[1:33:48] glad for that and with his own per blood
[1:33:52] we have been perfectly loosed aren't you
[1:33:55] glad for thatl God would make a creation
[1:33:59] and abolish the old so he can make
[1:34:01] another
[1:34:03] creation yes sir now notice another
[1:34:06] place brother Brown said it's through
[1:34:07] his holy blood that we now everybody say
[1:34:10] we we see have access to life and our
[1:34:14] sexual blood is dismissed and we have
[1:34:17] the blood of Jesus Christ that is
[1:34:19] greater than your sexual blood greater
[1:34:22] than your sinful blood that stands for
[1:34:25] an atonement making an atonement for our
[1:34:29] sins hallelujah oh man now if you go all
[1:34:34] the way to
[1:34:36] Revelations the last Church age
[1:34:39] Revelations
[1:34:41] 3:14 the lay odyssean age it declares
[1:34:45] that Jesus is the beginning of the
[1:34:47] creation of God praise the Lord and I'm
[1:34:49] going to
[1:34:50] close but it's in this day that he calls
[1:34:54] himself the author of the creation of
[1:34:58] God now notice what brother Brown said
[1:34:59] this is another creation yeah this has
[1:35:03] to do with the church amen this is a
[1:35:06] special designation of himself he is the
[1:35:09] creator of that church the Heavenly
[1:35:11] bridegroom created his own bride right
[1:35:13] as the spirit of God he came down and
[1:35:16] created in the womb Virgin Mary the
[1:35:18] cells from which his body was born he
[1:35:21] said I want to repeat that he created
[1:35:23] the very cells in the womb of Mary for
[1:35:26] that body it was not enough for the Holy
[1:35:29] Spirit to Simply give life to a human
[1:35:32] oven oam supplied by Mary that would
[1:35:36] have been sinful mankind producing a
[1:35:39] body see but that would not have been
[1:35:42] produced see uh that would have that
[1:35:44] would not have produced the last atom
[1:35:47] for of him it was said Lo a body thou
[1:35:50] father has prepared for me see God not
[1:35:54] Mary provided that body see Mary was the
[1:35:57] human incubator and she carried the holy
[1:36:00] child and brought him to birth it was a
[1:36:03] God man he was the son of God he was of
[1:36:08] that new creation man and God met and
[1:36:11] join he was the first of this new race
[1:36:14] he is the head of this new race can you
[1:36:17] say
[1:36:18] Amen now 2 Corinthians 5 17 therefore If
[1:36:22] any man be in Christ he is a new
[1:36:24] creature or a new creation watch old
[1:36:28] things are passed away aren't you glad
[1:36:31] for that old things are passed away
[1:36:33] behold all things have become
[1:36:36] new see so man was of the old order or
[1:36:40] old creation that's what we were we were
[1:36:42] of that old order of the old or old
[1:36:45] creation but notice but now Paul would
[1:36:49] tell us we are now in Union with Christ
[1:36:53] and brother Brown said see now in Union
[1:36:56] with Christ he has become the new
[1:36:58] creation of God aren't you glad for that
[1:37:01] in
[1:37:02] reconciliation that blood having an
[1:37:06] atonement for our sins and perfectly
[1:37:08] loosening us to where that God does not
[1:37:11] see you as a sinner he sees you as
[1:37:15] perfect he does not see you as full of
[1:37:19] faults and full of of is use he sees you
[1:37:22] as what he called you to be his son and
[1:37:25] what he predestinated you to be now we
[1:37:28] have come into Union with
[1:37:32] him that's true Ephesians 2:10 for we
[1:37:36] are his workmanship created in Christ
[1:37:38] Jesus unto good works oh my which God
[1:37:43] hath before ordained that we should walk
[1:37:46] in them so the doctrines of the church
[1:37:48] does not make you what you are that's
[1:37:51] right can you say Amen the law does not
[1:37:54] make you what you are legalism does not
[1:37:56] make you a bonified Christian then what
[1:37:59] makes you God Made You by
[1:38:02] [Applause]
[1:38:06] predestination
[1:38:08] it so now
[1:38:10] notice this new creation is not the old
[1:38:13] creation made over or it could not be
[1:38:15] called a new creation amen this is
[1:38:19] exactly what it says it is the new New
[1:38:21] Creation amen it is another creation
[1:38:23] distinct from the old one no longer is
[1:38:27] he dealing by ways of the flesh amen
[1:38:31] that's how he dealt with Israel he chose
[1:38:34] Abraham and Abraham's of Abraham's issue
[1:38:37] Through The Godly Isaac lion but now out
[1:38:40] of every Kindred tribe and Nation he has
[1:38:43] purposed a new
[1:38:45] creation he is the first of that
[1:38:47] creation he was God created in the form
[1:38:49] of man now Now by his Spirit he is
[1:38:52] creating many sons unto himself God the
[1:38:56] Creator creating himself a part of his
[1:38:59] creation amen aren't you glad for that
[1:39:02] amen he says this is the true revelation
[1:39:04] of God that was his purpose see this was
[1:39:06] his purpose this purpose took form
[1:39:08] through election that is why he could
[1:39:11] look right down to the last age when it
[1:39:13] all would be over and see himself still
[1:39:17] in the midst of the church as the author
[1:39:19] of this new creation of God God his
[1:39:22] Sovereign power brought it to pass by
[1:39:25] his own decree he elected the members of
[1:39:27] this new creation he predestinated them
[1:39:30] to the adoption of children according to
[1:39:32] the good pleasure of his will by his
[1:39:34] omniscience and omnipotence he brought
[1:39:36] it to pass how else could he know that
[1:39:39] he would be standing in the midst of the
[1:39:41] church receiving Glory from his Brethren
[1:39:43] if he did not make sure he all things he
[1:39:46] knew and all things he worked out
[1:39:48] according to what he knew in order that
[1:39:50] his Purp purpose and good pleasure be
[1:39:52] brought to pass nothing to do with you
[1:39:55] it was all what he purposed in his heart
[1:39:59] can you say Amen now here we are amen
[1:40:04] God not dealing with with us through the
[1:40:06] the the law through the church ages this
[1:40:08] is totally a message of Grace amen so if

[1:45:07] always saved Jesus just come to redeem
[1:45:11] that but you was saved from the
[1:45:13] beginning because you had eternal life
[1:45:15] to begin
[1:45:18] with he said a trout can never be a
[1:45:20] guard or a tadpole he might be in the
[1:45:22] same water with him but he was from the
[1:45:24] beginning of Trout the Ned only caught
[1:45:27] him but he was that from the begning oh
[1:45:30] aren't you glad for a
[1:45:31] message that would not deal with us
[1:45:33] according to what we were not trying to
[1:45:36] be accepted and happen to be accepted by
[1:45:39] the priest and a pope and and whatever
[1:45:41] else group amen he has accepted us amen
[1:45:46] it's an un unconditional Covenant amen
[1:45:49] so brother R said see eight cannot be
[1:45:52] counted with the week it cannot be
[1:45:54] counted eight days in a week you cannot
[1:45:56] do it see because there's only seven
[1:45:58] days in a week count any count it any
[1:46:01] way you want to Sunday is the first day
[1:46:03] of the week you count seven then you go
[1:46:06] back in and start over again count seven
[1:46:08] come back and go over it again and we've
[1:46:11] lived all through these types in here
[1:46:13] but when you hit the eighth you go into
[1:46:16] eternity you don't come by laws and
[1:46:18] rituals and orders you come by
[1:46:24] predestination you don't get saved at an
[1:46:26] altar you don't get filled with the Holy
[1:46:29] Ghost out you don't have to come to an
[1:46:30] altar to get the Holy Ghost hello
[1:46:34] Church you don't have to have certain
[1:46:36] rituals and
[1:46:38] [Music]
[1:46:41] forms you just believe in your heart you
[1:46:43] can have
[1:46:45] it and you say
[1:46:47] ma'am he said see that's it we're in
[1:46:50] ending see you come by predestination
[1:46:52] there is a genuine holy convocation and
[1:46:55] we're ending the seventh Church age
[1:46:56] Church age see Pentecostal age we're
[1:46:59] entering that Holy convocation we are
[1:47:01] entering into that real genuine eternity
[1:47:04] where the church is called not to some
[1:47:07] station not to some denomination but
[1:47:09] into eternity with their Eternal King
[1:47:13] amen we don't have it at all there's no
[1:47:15] such things as days and things and times
[1:47:18] you passed into eternity where you come
[1:47:21] from you was there to begin with and he
[1:47:25] says if you've got eternal life there is
[1:47:27] only one form and that's God and you are
[1:47:29] an expressed attribute if you're not
[1:47:32] you're not going to be there anyhow no
[1:47:34] man can come to me except my father has
[1:47:36] drawed him see so it's that which passes
[1:47:39] away all these old things but these
[1:47:42] things don't so it speaks of Eternity
[1:47:46] right the Holy Ghost is eternal then you
[1:47:49] are in eternity where you was all the
[1:47:51] time but you just recognized what
[1:47:55] happened you were made for an eternal
[1:47:57] purpose because you was the
[1:47:59] manifestation of an attribute that was
[1:48:01] in God that thought of you and expressed
[1:48:04] you and he made an earth to take you out
[1:48:06] of and to make you a human being and sin
[1:48:08] come along and perverted his way but you
[1:48:11] come anyhow but you was lost with the
[1:48:13] world so he come and he redeemed you the
[1:48:16] expressed attribute and also redeems
[1:48:19] this Earth by the same way aren't you
