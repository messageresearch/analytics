[39:27] and his Zeal for God's people amen
[39:31] and amen in this in this age and time
[39:34] you it's just uh it's got to be a
[39:36] god-given gift for to have a passion for
[39:38] Souls you see so many that just let
[39:40] souls go by
[39:42] and don't really have a care for them
[39:45] but then God plants gifts and you see
[39:48] those gifts operating just to do
[39:49] anything they can to win souls for the
[39:51] kingdom
[39:53] amen amen turn to the book of
[39:55] Deuteronomy with me the second
[40:09] chapter we're just going to read two
[40:11] verses from here Deuteronomy the 2
[40:14] chapter start at the second verse and
[40:17] the Lord spake unto me saying ye have
[40:19] compassed this mountain long enough turn
[40:23] you northward you have compassed this
[40:25] mountain long enough turn you northward
[40:29] amen maybe while your bbl's open this
[40:31] morning if you just ask the Lord to come
[40:33] by your way and take something off those
[40:36] pages and make it real to you this
[40:37] morning Father we thank you Lord for
[40:39] your grace and yes Jesus your mercy
[40:41] father that's brought us here to this
[40:43] morning Father Lord we're well aware of
[40:46] your presence in the room and we're
[40:47] aware that the scripture is open to your
[40:49] word and father that's where all life
[40:51] comes from Lord is Lord out of your word
[40:54] and from you Lord and father we ask that
[40:56] it would be more than just ink on pages
[40:58] Lord or quotes being read but father it
[41:01] would be life Lord poured out upon us
[41:03] this morning Father Lord I pray that
[41:05] you'd bring restoration Lord I pray that
[41:08] you'd increase Faith Lord I pray that
[41:09] you'd bring healing father Lord I pray
[41:12] that you'd bring your spirit father we
[41:14] believe that you're still a filling God
[41:15] that fills every heart and soul that's
[41:17] hungering for you oh god father I pray
[41:20] that you would just anoint this word in
[41:21] a way that it would become such a
[41:23] reality to us this morning Father that
[41:26] Lord you'd allow me just to move out of
[41:28] the way father and you'd use my lips and
[41:30] voice father but Lord you use the
[41:32] audience and and you'd open their hearts
[41:35] father Lord and you'd move into them and
[41:36] be indwelling father this morning and
[41:39] God I ask that you just anoint your word
[41:41] to us Lord As We Lift Your Name father
[41:43] Lord we know that you promised you'd be
[41:45] here and father we we're aware that
[41:48] you're here father and Lord we know when
[41:51] you come in the room that you're here to
[41:52] do a purpose father you're here to
[41:54] perform your father 's business and Lord
[41:57] we thank you ask you bless us now in the
[42:00] name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may
[42:03] be seated this morning there in that
[42:06] Deuteronomy we read about uh the
[42:08] children of Israel walking around the
[42:10] mountain and if we could just call this
[42:12] mountain brother Brandon would call this
[42:14] mountain the mountain of
[42:15] unbelief and they would be walking
[42:17] around this mountain of unbelief and
[42:19] they would walk around this same
[42:20] Mountain for 40 years they would be
[42:23] stuck in a rut just walking around this
[42:25] same mountain of unbelief so this
[42:27] morning just for a few minutes in time
[42:29] wanted to talk about enough is enough we
[42:32] walked around this mountain long enough
[42:34] and enough is enough I I believe as
[42:37] children of God we're given rights and
[42:39] we're given inheritance and we're given
[42:41] laws that apply to us and we're given
[42:43] Authority in the land but we've got to
[42:45] recognize the authority that we've been
[42:47] given and we've got to have the courage
[42:49] to stand up and say enough is enough and
[42:52] I believe we're a Joshua generation in
[42:54] this age that we're not we're not
[42:55] looking for somebody else to come and to
[42:57] take the Reigns but we are the Joshua of
[43:00] this generation that will take the
[43:01] Reigns of this word and we will cross
[43:03] over into another land and you got to
[43:06] think that during this time that they
[43:07] were walking around the mountains and
[43:09] they they were they were compassing and
[43:11] brother Amos you got to know that they
[43:12] probably stepped in the same place that
[43:14] they stepped in the year before and they
[43:16] saw the same footprint that they were in
[43:18] the year before and they saw their same
[43:20] the dead their dead horse on the side of
[43:21] the road that was there the year before
[43:23] and they circle around and they circle
[43:25] around and you think about this for 40
[43:26] years they circled around imagine if
[43:29] somebody were to come to the Altar for
[43:30] 40 years with the same burden on their
[43:32] heart or the same need and they'd have
[43:33] to come back to the same Revelation for
[43:36] 40 years in a row and never actually
[43:39] crossing over into a Promised Land but I
[43:41] say we're living in a time and an age
[43:43] where we are saying enough is enough
[43:45] I've had enough of seeing the same the
[43:48] same Egyptians I've had enough of seeing
[43:50] the same fears the same complexes I've
[43:52] had enough of dealing with the same
[43:54] situations I've I've had enough of only
[43:56] reaching it to this plateau and never
[43:58] going further into the word I've had
[44:00] enough of of compassing this mountain of
[44:03] unbelief and I'm going to rise today and
[44:05] use my authority to say enough is enough
[44:09] I'm not going to settle for just what
[44:10] I've been given in this life but I've
[44:12] been given another inheritance and I've
[44:14] got to rise to the occasion and say
[44:16] enough is enough we don't get anything
[44:19] else out this morning just take that
[44:21] phrase enough's enough when the Devil
[44:23] comes back to you this week and he hits
[44:25] you tomorrow morning morning you say
[44:26] enough is enough I'm not going to I'm
[44:28] not going to go around this mountain of
[44:30] argument again I'm not going to reason
[44:32] out if this is the truth in my mind
[44:33] again I'm not going to go back to a
[44:35] place where I wonder where I'm at or the
[44:37] position I've been given or or the
[44:39] authority I've been given in this age or
[44:41] I want that seat in the church or I want
[44:43] this position in the church and I'm not
[44:44] going to go back to that place of Reason
[44:46] in my mind but enough is enough I'm
[44:49] going to go on in Perfection as a Joshua
[44:51] generation is commissioned to do to
[44:53] cross over into a place where nobody
[44:56] else had been before they'd heard of a
[44:58] land of a Holy Ghost Land but nobody had
[45:00] crossed over that land before so Joshua
[45:03] had a vision to know that I've got I've
[45:05] got a place over there I've got a home
[45:07] over there I've got I've got authority
[45:09] over there in that land over there I I'm
[45:11] free from Harm's Way yes there's going
[45:13] to be battles yes there's going to be
[45:15] fights but I am protected by the
[45:18] Covenant God gave that if we're in that
[45:20] land then we are under his protection if
[45:22] we're under his protection then there is
[45:24] no weapon for against us that shall
[45:27] prosper we're under the protection of
[45:29] the message of the hour no more
[45:31] reasoning about it no more wondering
[45:33] about it we've Compass the mountain long
[45:35] enough we've got to enter into the
[45:36] authority of the land and if we're not
[45:38] in that land then we don't have rights
[45:40] to the authority right under the Judean
[45:43] law they were they were blessed people
[45:46] right the children of Israel were
[45:47] blessed people in Egypt but they were
[45:48] still in they were still in slavery they
[45:51] were still blessed but they were not
[45:52] fully blessed cuz they were not living
[45:54] where they were supposed to live live
[45:56] and as children of God in this age we
[45:58] can be blessed outside here but we'll
[45:59] always have a mediocre life short of
[46:02] Victory and short of walking in the
[46:03] fullness until we come fully into the
[46:06] promised land where we belong that is
[46:08] where our rights come into effect so why
[46:10] would we wait outside in the Border land
[46:12] when we can cross all the way in and
[46:14] enjoy the benefits the benefits of a
[46:17] body prepared amen the benefits of a
[46:19] holy ghost land where God has already
[46:21] made a way for us but we've got to say
[46:24] enough's enough and you got to think
[46:25] Joshua walked in these same circles and
[46:27] these same ruts and stepped in the same
[46:29] Footprints and every time they would get
[46:31] to the entrance to the promised land he
[46:33] would feel a pull within him you know he
[46:35] looked over there and he said it's just
[46:37] that way if we could just go that way
[46:38] and trying to get two million people to
[46:40] to see what he saw if we could just come
[46:42] this way we could just move this
[46:45] direction and and and the people just so
[46:47] strong in their mind and say no we're
[46:48] going to go back in the same Circle that
[46:50] we've gone in before it reminds me of a
[46:52] prophet that came in this age and was
[46:54] talking to the denominations he said if
[46:56] you could just pull this way and yet so
[46:58] headstrong in their denominational
[47:00] thought they went back in the same
[47:02] Circle in the same rut and came back
[47:03] into the same falling of an age and
[47:05] Pentecost failed and Pentecost went away
[47:07] even though the prophet was trying to
[47:09] say this is the direction this is the
[47:11] way to go and yet they found themselves
[47:13] walking in the same rut that Wesley did
[47:15] and that Luther did and walking back in
[47:17] another cycle but I think it's time we
[47:19] break the cycle this message will not
[47:22] denominate we will break the cycle we're
[47:24] going to get free from this circle of
[47:26] unbelief this mountain I don't know
[47:28] about you friends but I've Compass this
[47:30] mountain long enough I I was born in a
[47:32] message home I've been in a message
[47:34] church so you can say I've been walking
[47:35] around almost 40 years hearing the same
[47:37] promises and the same the same preaching
[47:39] and the same Revelations but there's
[47:42] coming a time when we're saying enough
[47:44] is enough I'm taking this word and I'm
[47:47] crossing over into my land enough's
[47:50] enough you can go back in a circle if
[47:52] you want to but as for me in my house we
[47:55] will cross over we have seen a Promised
[47:57] Land we've tasted of a land we witnessed
[48:00] of the land we we've prepared for it to
[48:02] make it over there if we're not prepared
[48:04] to go there why are we here this morning
[48:06] but our entire life has been coming into
[48:08] a house of God preparing Our Lives
[48:10] preparing our hearts for what to go back
[48:12] in the same Circle no to cross over into
[48:15] somewhere that we've never been before
[48:17] to place our foot on Authority amen that
[48:20] is where the third pole lies is in that
[48:23] land and we'll never have access to that
[48:25] Authority tell we we're living in that
[48:27] land and that land is the holy ghost in
[48:29] the message of the hour we can't stop
[48:31] short of that and that's why we have
[48:33] fights and that's why we have bickering
[48:34] and that's why we have so and so did
[48:36] this and so and so did that and that's
[48:38] why we have divisions and we have
[48:39] leavings and we have bad feelings and
[48:41] because we're not living in the land
[48:43] where we're supposed to live but as for
[48:45] me in my house I say it's time to move
[48:48] into the land where we're supposed to
[48:49] live where we don't let the divisions
[48:51] conquer us we don't let the bad feelings
[48:53] conquer us we don't let the Mind battles
[48:55] conquer us cuz we're living in our
[48:58] Authority that's what we're crossing
[49:00] over into now we say a Holy Ghost Land
[49:02] is that is that a land of dancing and
[49:04] jumping and shouting yeah maybe there's
[49:06] a lot of Victories there but that's not
[49:07] all that's in that land that land is a
[49:10] land of spoken word Authority where you
[49:12] have the same rights that that join HS
[49:16] join HS with Jesus Christ right so you
[49:19] have the same rights that he had you
[49:20] have the same rights that the prophet
[49:22] had I don't believe that this message
[49:23] came in this time and this age just to
[49:26] tell one man that he could have spoken
[49:28] word Authority I believe he said you can
[49:30] too I believe he said this that I've
[49:32] done you will also do these works that I
[49:35] do shall you do and greater because
[49:37] there's more of you if the church could
[49:39] all move into the land of authority then
[49:41] they would all have the same rights they
[49:43] would all have the same vision they
[49:45] would all have the same word of Prophecy
[49:46] in their mouth no we don't have a
[49:48] messiah sign no we don't have that great
[49:51] gift of discernment no we don't have
[49:52] that same the same life pattern that
[49:54] brother bandam had but we are given the
[49:56] same Authority to me that's a more
[49:59] miraculous thing I was not protected
[50:02] from Harm's Way I was not protected from
[50:04] from from defiling my body I was not I
[50:06] didn't have an angel of the Lord
[50:07] hovering over Me Knocking away
[50:09] cigarettes and knocking away bottles so
[50:11] I think it's a greater miracle that
[50:12] you're sitting here this morning and
[50:14] even through all the trials that you've
[50:16] been through and all the mistakes that
[50:17] you've had you've been given the same
[50:20] the same benefits if you cross into that
[50:22] Holy Land so I think we've had enough of
[50:25] walk in ruts amen I don't know about you
[50:28] but I've had enough sir of just catching
[50:31] glimpses of a Promised Land we've had an
[50:34] exodus right we've come out of
[50:35] denomination some of us in some of us
[50:38] have not still but we've come out of
[50:40] denomination and we've come into what we
[50:42] call a message realm right but then but
[50:44] then other people have denominated that
[50:46] same realm because they failed to cross
[50:48] over so would bring out there's two
[50:50] parts to an exodus right there's two
[50:52] parts to Redemption there's a coming out
[50:54] of and there's a going into so here's
[50:57] where we're at stuck in this Valley
[50:59] between the the coming out of and the
[51:01] going into but I think it's time we
[51:02] settle it this morning and we take what
[51:05] we know and we go
[51:06] into let what's been said been said and
[51:09] been done been done lay it behind you
[51:11] and cross over into the land of
[51:13] authority you're never going to have
[51:15] true Joy or true happiness or true peace
[51:17] until you're living in that land and yes
[51:20] there's battles in that land there's
[51:22] there's opposition in that land there's
[51:24] Giants in that land there's enemies in
[51:26] that land but you are different in your
[51:28] in your faith because you're standing in
[51:30] a position of authority and you think
[51:33] you look at somebody well they're still
[51:34] fighting but they're in a position of
[51:36] authority what what what what what
[51:38] battle are you going to win not knowing
[51:40] who you are the devil's going to come
[51:43] right to that point every time you you
[51:45] try to attack him back and every time
[51:46] time you try to take back what's yours
[51:48] you're going to end up right at that
[51:50] crossroads do you know who you
[51:53] are if you're living in the land of
[51:55] Authority the only way you got there is
[51:58] by the blood and the blood has tagged
[52:01] you that you know who you are you know
[52:04] that you didn't access that just by by
[52:06] you didn't slip in under the radar but
[52:08] God allowed you to be in the promised
[52:09] land of Victory because you are tagged
[52:12] with the blood tag you know who you are
[52:15] that land is only for the Sons and
[52:17] Daughters of God with that seed that can
[52:19] have that have that Authority in this
[52:21] life nobody else has that same Authority
[52:24] they can have faith and they can have
[52:26] the miraculous done but to know who you
[52:28] are and to know where you're going and
[52:29] to know that your
[52:31] name now we know why we're rejoicing
[52:33] right if you're not in the land you
[52:35] don't really know why you're rejoicing
[52:37] you're rejoicing the spirits are subject
[52:39] unto you you're rejoicing that the
[52:40] anointing and an emotion came in the
[52:42] room and all those things are great
[52:43] reasons to Rejoice but when you're
[52:45] living in the land you have seen your
[52:47] name on the Lamb's Book of Life and you
[52:50] know why you're rejoicing because no
[52:53] matter what this life brings you you're
[52:54] going to make it and I think we say
[52:57] enough is enough of not knowing if our
[52:59] name is on the book and I think we
[53:01] settle it this morning and we say I want
[53:02] to see my name if John could see his
[53:05] name then I can see my name too if it
[53:07] could be revealed to Paul that he would
[53:09] know that he would know that he would
[53:10] know then I can too I believe we've got
[53:12] to step into a position where we know
[53:15] who we
[53:17] are but it's something that's slipped
[53:19] into the church and we're even unaware
[53:21] of it brother man was say he's speaking
[53:23] of a meeting there in Europe he say
[53:25] sitting there in the lap land where I
[53:27] couldn't even speak one word and half
[53:29] the fins couldn't their sweds and there
[53:31] the Holy Spirit was set in and tell the
[53:33] people things all down and they were
[53:35] just in one Accord everybody just
[53:37] pleading out for God and just great
[53:40] signs and wonders there was no friction
[53:43] they didn't even speak the same language
[53:45] she can't tell me he worked him up into
[53:46] some kind of emotion they didn't
[53:48] understand what he was saying but when
[53:49] the feeling came in the room they
[53:51] recognized it he said there was no
[53:54] friction there sometimes you get in such
[53:56] a rut Till There is no really setting
[53:59] right to a man is that right you just
[54:01] get to a place till subconsciously
[54:04] you're
[54:05] disbelieving when you don't want to do
[54:07] that you don't want to do that see the
[54:10] thing is to do is lay down everything
[54:13] and believe with all your heart so the
[54:15] prophet's telling us here that we can
[54:17] get into a rut in our life where we're
[54:19] subconsciously disbelieving the word not
[54:22] even knowing it because we're afraid to
[54:24] cross over into the land that God's
[54:26] already said was ours and he said the
[54:28] thing to do is to lay down all the isms
[54:31] and schisms and doubts and wonderings
[54:33] and hard feelings and you see that's a
[54:35] hard thing for for for for us to do
[54:38] because we we've been hurt and when
[54:40] you've been hurt you're not just easily
[54:42] going to give that up you're not going
[54:43] to easily if you've ever been if you've
[54:44] ever been jabbed here you're always
[54:46] going to cover that with your arm right
[54:48] and it's going to be hard to let that go
[54:50] because there's a wound there and and
[54:52] but what the prophet's telling us is
[54:53] subconsciously you're protecting
[54:55] yourself from the Holy Spirit entering
[54:57] into that place so he can bring a bomb
[55:00] so he can bring a healing and you've got
[55:02] it covered and you've got it protected
[55:04] but the prophet's telling us the thing
[55:05] to do is to let it go and let the Holy
[55:08] Ghost come in and bring a healing to
[55:10] that to that issue bring a healing to
[55:12] that battle in your mind he says what
[55:14] happened with Joshua one day little
[55:16] Joshua he believed every word that God
[55:18] said every word somebody say every word
[55:20] every word God took care of us and he
[55:23] kept his promise he said he Supply our
[55:25] needs while we're out here but that's
[55:26] not all of
[55:28] it come on now there lays a Promised
[55:31] Land let's go to it he says you've been
[55:34] on this mountain 40 years turn now turn
[55:38] northward and upward and cross
[55:41] over I think the prophet's giv us some
[55:43] powerful Direction here turn now turn
[55:47] turn upward and turn northward so if you
[55:51] hold a compass like this brother Kevin
[55:52] the compass is always going to press
[55:54] North right it's always going to have
[55:55] that red arrow pointing North I don't
[55:57] know what direction North is from here
[55:58] maybe somebody does Brother Sam you know
[56:00] what North is from here this way okay so
[56:03] if I was holding the compass the arrow
[56:05] will be pointing that way right sure
[56:07] that direction is but what brother
[56:10] Braham was saying not to just turn it
[56:12] northward but to turn it upward glory
[56:15] and if you look on a map the direction
[56:16] of North is always on the top of the map
[56:18] right well he's saying don't just turn
[56:20] your direction to a geographical North
[56:22] here but turn your eyes upward turn your
[56:24] turn your sights upward stop looking to
[56:26] the left or the right or the person in
[56:28] front of you or thinking this is for the
[56:30] person behind you but turn your vision
[56:32] upward and move on and move past it move
[56:35] past all the friction move past all the
[56:37] all the all the grinding and the
[56:39] attitudes and the waves that you feel
[56:41] you know how sometimes you get into a
[56:42] conversation with somebody you feel that
[56:44] there's some resistance there and you're
[56:45] not sure why and there's this friction
[56:47] that happened and they didn't shake your
[56:48] hand just right or they didn't look at
[56:50] you the right way or you know and then
[56:51] you leave with this thought well they
[56:53] don't like me or they don't you know and
[56:55] in reality they're thinking the same
[56:56] thing about you and you see the devil
[56:57] moves right in there in the middle of
[56:59] that and he says yeah they don't like
[57:00] you you should just go yeah they don't
[57:02] like you either you should just leave
[57:04] and you know the best way to settle this
[57:05] is to go find a new church or to move on
[57:07] to somebody else so you don't have to
[57:08] come face them again you know I know
[57:10] what I'm talking about I've grown up in
[57:12] church i' I've dealt with all this and
[57:14] I've had to battle through all this
[57:15] myself and I know where I'm what I'm
[57:17] talking about and that's how the devil
[57:19] moves into our our our midst and he
[57:21] tries to divide and he tries to conquer
[57:23] and he tries to steal kill and
[57:26] Destroy and if he can get into the
[57:28] middle of our of our fellowship then he
[57:31] can he can cut off that blood supply he
[57:33] can cut off that flow of unity right
[57:35] there was no friction among them and
[57:38] that's when the Holy Spirit fell I
[57:39] wonder if we could say that in the
[57:40] Church of God this morning there is no
[57:42] friction among them oh well I sit on
[57:45] this side of the church cuz that brother
[57:47] sits on that side of the church and I
[57:48] want to be as far away from him as I can
[57:49] be and you see how how how church goes
[57:51] on this is nothing new it's been a cycle
[57:55] the battle that you're fighting is a
[57:57] cycle I'd like to tell you that your
[57:59] that your issue with people is new but
[58:02] it's not it's a cycle it's the same
[58:04] mountain of unbelief that we've
[58:06] compassing we've been compassing and the
[58:09] church has been compassing but there's
[58:11] got to come of people that are willing
[58:12] to rise up and say enough is enough I
[58:16] don't care what they've said I don't
[58:17] care what they've done I don't care what
[58:19] attitude I imagine I don't care enough
[58:22] is enough Joshua didn't just say all my
[58:24] friends are going to come with me and
[58:26] all the people that I hang out with are
[58:27] going to come with me he said we've got
[58:29] a land
[58:30] people we've got a land that's ours and
[58:33] we've got to move to that land we're
[58:34] going to die out here in the wilderness
[58:36] and they were busy well Joshua we can't
[58:38] go over there because this brother
[58:39] believes that
[58:42] way Joshua is thinking wow there's a
[58:44] Promised Land over there there's a Holy
[58:47] Ghost Land over there if we could just
[58:48] get there it'll take care of the
[58:50] division it'll take care of all that and
[58:52] they're saying no we can't enter into
[58:54] that because this brother said this and
[58:56] no we can't enter into that because we
[58:57] get too fanatical or we can't go that
[58:59] way because we get too dried up and we
[59:01] can't go that way and you see Josh is
[59:02] trying to say if we could just cross
[59:04] over there it would take care of all
[59:06] this it would take care of all the
[59:08] bickering and all the fighting and all
[59:10] the all the hard feelings and the sore
[59:12] feelings and we can't fellowship and we
[59:13] can't shake hands and we can't brother
[59:15] bam said you could bitterly disagree
[59:17] with
[59:18] me come on and I'll shake your hand and
[59:22] say I love you now we say that's easy to
[59:25] do until we come in contact with
[59:27] somebody that we can't do that anymore
[59:29] and we have a hard time reaching that
[59:30] hand out in love with a genuine love in
[59:33] us to say brother I know you're wrong
[59:35] and I know you're in error but I love
[59:36] you
[59:37] anyway that's a hard thing to do it's a
[59:40] hard thing for us to get past our own
[59:42] emotion because we just we want to fix
[59:44] everybody right we want everybody to be
[59:46] in the pattern the way that we see it
[59:47] but not everybody fits in the same
[59:49] pattern that we fit in some will go this
[59:51] way and some will go that way but as for
[59:53] this for this message bride she will
[59:56] only stay with the word and the word
[59:59] says that you've got to have a hand of
[1:00:01] Fellowship out and say I love you anyway
[1:00:04] I love you no matter how you treated me
[1:00:06] you you might have stabbed me in the
[1:00:07] back but I love you anyway you see that
[1:00:10] only can come by walking in the land of
[1:00:12] authority amen you can't have that just
[1:00:15] in your
[1:00:16] flesh you can try but on the inside it
[1:00:19] won't be the real thing the real thing
[1:00:21] only comes by living in the land of
[1:00:23] authority living where where where the
[1:00:25] Holy Ghost is supreme ruler he says turn
[1:00:29] now turn northward and upward he said
[1:00:32] don't you want to cross over Jordan now
[1:00:33] ain't it long enough in the
[1:00:36] wilderness ain't it long enough
[1:00:40] friends I don't know about you but I
[1:00:42] think it's enough I've had enough of
[1:00:45] wondering what's the truth or wondering
[1:00:46] what's the reality or who should we
[1:00:48] listen to or whose opinions
[1:00:50] right
[1:00:52] enough enough and the devil come enough
[1:00:56] no enough I've I've had enough I'm just
[1:00:58] going to push away from the table I've
[1:01:00] had enough of this negative conversation
[1:01:03] but I see a Promised Land over there I'm
[1:01:06] not going to walk in the same rut I'm
[1:01:08] not going to walk in the same cycle oh
[1:01:10] they tried it and then they found
[1:01:11] themselves right back in the same cycle
[1:01:13] just walking in circles just walking in
[1:01:16] circles and that's how the devil has
[1:01:18] stopped this church from entering into
[1:01:21] into this Rapture and fullness is he's
[1:01:24] got it walking in circles brother going
[1:01:27] back to the same Cycles going back to
[1:01:29] the same circle of unbelief and
[1:01:31] wondering and wandering and wondering
[1:01:33] not sure of the direction to head but if
[1:01:35] we could get under the Joshua commission
[1:01:38] through the message of the hour it has
[1:01:40] made a way my word is a lamp unto thy
[1:01:42] feet and a light unto thy path it is the
[1:01:45] way that is right it is the it is the
[1:01:48] narrow way and we've got to walk on that
[1:01:49] way and without that we will just be
[1:01:51] wandering in cycles and some wander in
[1:01:54] wider patterns and some wandering closer
[1:01:56] patterns but they're all wandering in
[1:01:58] circles but there's going to be a bride
[1:02:00] there's going to be a Joshua Church in
[1:02:02] this age that has had enough of
[1:02:04] wandering the same mountain and they're
[1:02:06] going to be willing to take the step
[1:02:08] into Liberty and say I've had enough I'm
[1:02:11] not settling to go back I'm not going
[1:02:13] back where I was last year I'm not going
[1:02:15] back for the same thing that I came in
[1:02:17] here with I'm not going back to the same
[1:02:19] addiction I'm not going back to the same
[1:02:21] fear I've had enough and I'm walking
[1:02:23] into victory that is the commission of
[1:02:25] the church in this age not to go in C
[1:02:27] anybody can walk in circles but we've
[1:02:29] been given a commission to go forward
[1:02:32] and speak the word there's only one
[1:02:33] direction of the Holy Ghost brother bam
[1:02:35] said it's forward not in circles but
[1:02:38] forward not back around the bend but
[1:02:40] forward I couldn't even count so many
[1:02:41] u-turns we've made I there's too many to
[1:02:44] count but there's only one direction of
[1:02:46] the true Holy Ghost it's forward in the
[1:02:48] word we're not going backwards to
[1:02:51] restore the church we're going forwards
[1:02:53] to restore the church we're not going
[1:02:55] back to a Pentecostal pattern like we
[1:02:57] think backwards we'd be have to go all
[1:02:58] the way through the ages to go back to
[1:03:00] there but we're going forward to a
[1:03:02] Pentecost the pattern of the church
[1:03:05] that's where we're headed we're not
[1:03:06] trying to go back nobody's trying to
[1:03:07] take us back well if they are they're
[1:03:09] off the word but we're not trying to go
[1:03:11] back to isusa Street why do we want to
[1:03:12] go back to isusa Street where they were
[1:03:14] off the word they didn't know how to
[1:03:16] baptize they didn't know the authority
[1:03:17] they had they didn't they didn't know
[1:03:18] anything it was the breaking of an age
[1:03:20] and the anointing came down well I don't
[1:03:21] want to go back to that we've come way
[1:03:23] too far to go back to that but we've got
[1:03:25] to get back to the original pattern of
[1:03:27] the church which was the Pentecostal 120
[1:03:29] in the upper room church and the only
[1:03:31] way to get there is to go forward in the
[1:03:33] word is that all right I got quotes for
[1:03:36] all this I just paraphrase them so I'll
[1:03:38] send them to you if you want goad
[1:03:39] brother that's all right you're doing
[1:03:40] good but I know brother Sean preached
[1:03:42] the message you guys have probably heard
[1:03:43] these quotes praise the Lord he says I
[1:03:46] believe your
[1:03:48] word speaking of Samson Revenge my eyes
[1:03:51] that I that has been put out let me die
[1:03:54] let me die out to my own self I don't
[1:03:56] care what they say about me I may be
[1:03:58] Bishop I may be this that or the other I
[1:04:00] don't care what they say bring back the
[1:04:01] power of the holy ghost in my life I've
[1:04:04] been blinded long
[1:04:06] enough Samson saying I've been blinded
[1:04:09] long enough bring back the power you see
[1:04:12] he's saying restore the power of once I
[1:04:14] once had I I had once tasted that power
[1:04:17] bring it back I've been blinded long
[1:04:19] enough and when's the last time church
[1:04:21] that we had a clear Direction on what we
[1:04:23] were doing in this life a clear
[1:04:25] direction of how we we knew where we
[1:04:26] were going we know the position we held
[1:04:28] we knew the direction of the of the hour
[1:04:30] and we were walking steadfastly and I
[1:04:32] say there's people in the room that know
[1:04:34] there's people in the room that know
[1:04:36] what we're doing here there's people in
[1:04:37] the room that know the direction we're
[1:04:38] heading and we're not looking to the
[1:04:40] left or the right so we're just trying
[1:04:42] to get everybody to come on board with
[1:04:44] us it's so much easier brother Terry
[1:04:47] when you're not looking to the left or
[1:04:48] the
[1:04:49] right just like brother B would talk
[1:04:51] about that boy on the balance beam right
[1:04:53] how did you do well I didn't look down I
[1:04:55] didn't look left I just looked to the
[1:04:56] end point and when you're looking to the
[1:04:58] end point you're not looking at brother
[1:05:00] so and so or sister so and so you're
[1:05:01] only looking at the end of the line and
[1:05:04] it doesn't really matter what they're
[1:05:05] doing you're just trying to get them to
[1:05:06] get to the end of the line with
[1:05:09] you prise the Lord is that all
[1:05:13] right
[1:05:17] Hallelujah the man would say now I
[1:05:19] believe that we're living in the days or
[1:05:22] the days that we're living in should
[1:05:23] cause the church to go completely into
[1:05:26] desperation I believe since the message
[1:05:29] this morning from God not me I believe
[1:05:31] it ought to throw this entire
[1:05:32] congregation into desperation that we
[1:05:34] have played long enough we've went to
[1:05:38] church long enough we've got to do
[1:05:41] something how is it that we can see
[1:05:43] other great signs and wonders done on
[1:05:45] others and what about us it should cause
[1:05:48] in a state of desperation that we are
[1:05:50] determined before
[1:05:53] God Lord so let's bring this down to
[1:05:56] individual
[1:05:59] now we've seen Miracle after Miracle
[1:06:02] take place under the authority of this
[1:06:04] message I we'd lose count to say that
[1:06:07] the message is lost power would be the
[1:06:09] most ignorant statement I've ever heard
[1:06:10] we lose count of the amount of Miracles
[1:06:13] and testimonies and and and deliverances
[1:06:16] and fillings and we'd lose count yeah if
[1:06:19] we would just took the last if we took
[1:06:21] the last five years we'd lose count
[1:06:23] think about what's happening just in our
[1:06:25] midst here but then magnify that all
[1:06:27] over the world and think about churches
[1:06:28] in Africa and churches in Australia and
[1:06:31] churches in Europe and all the Miracles
[1:06:32] that God's working through this message
[1:06:34] of the hour we would lose count amen we
[1:06:37] would run out of ink in just a short
[1:06:39] amount of time if we started recording
[1:06:41] all the different ones you think about
[1:06:42] you have a testimony service and
[1:06:43] everybody here say well God's met me
[1:06:45] sometime in the last year praise God he
[1:06:48] should have yeah and we'd have we'd have
[1:06:52] just in this church we'd have
[1:06:54] pages over the last couple years of
[1:06:56] Miracles right and we can say well this
[1:06:59] happened and this happened and this
[1:07:00] happened and the message hasn't lost
[1:07:02] power to say that would just you'd have
[1:07:04] to literally have blinders on and just
[1:07:06] have your head buried in the sand to not
[1:07:08] know that the power and authority is in
[1:07:10] the Church of of the Living God Amen but
[1:07:13] brother brandom is saying here after
[1:07:15] seeing all that what about
[1:07:18] us come on now now I've been to this
[1:07:21] temp meeting here that you guys have
[1:07:22] every year since you've had it and I've
[1:07:24] seen more miracles come out of that
[1:07:25] prayer line Hallelujah I couldn't even
[1:07:27] count them I wouldn't even know them all
[1:07:30] this one would maybe wouldn't say what
[1:07:32] was really fixed on the inside of them
[1:07:33] or this one and some are physical
[1:07:35] manifestations you could see and some
[1:07:36] are fillings of the Holy Ghost and some
[1:07:38] are and you watch Miracle after Miracle
[1:07:40] after miracle happened and the water's
[1:07:42] being troubled and the people are
[1:07:44] walking into the troubled water and
[1:07:45] you're seeing the results of that
[1:07:47] Troubled Water but then you look out and
[1:07:48] you still see some sitting there in the
[1:07:50] chair and you got to wonder what they're
[1:07:51] thinking yeah what are they thinking
[1:07:53] sitting sitting 15 ft away from this
[1:07:55] miraculous thing going by and they're
[1:07:57] just watching it Go by spectating it
[1:07:59] spectating Miracle after miracle and the
[1:08:01] prophet of God is saying after seeing
[1:08:03] all these signs and wonders take place
[1:08:04] in our midst what about you where's your
[1:08:07] Miracle where's where's your deliverance
[1:08:09] and you you watch this sit by and go by
[1:08:11] and you think oh that's wonderful God
[1:08:13] did this and God did that and God did
[1:08:15] this but what about our individual
[1:08:16] testimony maybe this doesn't apply to
[1:08:18] everybody in the room but if it applies
[1:08:20] to pay attention and you watch and you
[1:08:22] watch this this this this flood of the
[1:08:25] anointing come through the service and
[1:08:27] you'll see it affect this one and this
[1:08:28] one and this one and you know sometimes
[1:08:30] you just sit in the back of the church
[1:08:32] and as as a as a deacon you really get
[1:08:34] to enjoy that because you can literally
[1:08:36] watch the anointing come like a wave and
[1:08:38] you can just see it affect the people in
[1:08:40] different ways or front to back or back
[1:08:41] to front you can literally tell the
[1:08:43] direction of the anointing moving across
[1:08:45] the church as it changes the countenance
[1:08:47] of the people and people are entering in
[1:08:49] but yet some people will sit there and
[1:08:50] they'll go right by them and they'll
[1:08:52] never enter into that anointing it
[1:08:54] reminds me of that man at the pool of
[1:08:55] Bethesda right where he was just just
[1:08:58] from here to the door to the Fountain
[1:08:59] and there would be there'd be so many
[1:09:01] people healed and he watched healing
[1:09:02] brother Amos come out he'd watch a guy
[1:09:04] walk down on crutches they carry him
[1:09:05] down on the bed and he'd go down there
[1:09:07] and he'd watch that same man walk out on
[1:09:09] his own two legs because of the
[1:09:11] authority of that was happening inside
[1:09:13] that inside that
[1:09:15] well and we watch many miracles take
[1:09:17] place in our midst we watched one
[1:09:19] walking in the prayer line that was
[1:09:20] ready to to to kill themselves in a
[1:09:22] spirit of suicide and walk out on the
[1:09:24] other side totally delivered ready to to
[1:09:27] to live their life for God we've seen
[1:09:29] the miraculous happen but what about our
[1:09:31] Miracle what about us come on
[1:09:34] now hallelujah what about your need well
[1:09:38] I would do that but this I would do that
[1:09:41] but this I I would do that but this you
[1:09:42] see how the the man is making these
[1:09:44] excuses for not being able to get to the
[1:09:47] Fountain and he wants to within himself
[1:09:49] but he's not able to stop going through
[1:09:51] the same cycle that he's been going
[1:09:52] through for 35 years of not being able
[1:09:55] to enter into that Troubled Water and so
[1:09:58] you know what happens there's an
[1:09:59] interruption that happens in his life he
[1:10:01] doesn't have the faith to get there so
[1:10:03] the word comes to him he doesn't have
[1:10:06] the faith to get to the troubled water
[1:10:07] himself brother Brown said right now the
[1:10:10] waters are troubled and the word has
[1:10:12] come to us so the word will come right
[1:10:14] to where you're at and you might have
[1:10:16] not have the faith or the ability to get
[1:10:18] to the troubled water but the troubled
[1:10:20] water will come to you and you've got to
[1:10:23] recognize the anointing has come through
[1:10:24] the room it's cycling through this
[1:10:26] building right now and you've got to be
[1:10:28] willing to say I've had enough I've had
[1:10:31] enough of what I've been dealing with
[1:10:32] I've had enough of the pressure I've had
[1:10:34] enough of the Mind battle I've had
[1:10:36] enough not knowing I've had enough of of
[1:10:39] being dried out I've had enough of just
[1:10:41] wondering if I'm the next one to leave
[1:10:43] I've had enough of this of this battle
[1:10:45] going on enough is enough rise into the
[1:10:48] anointing and say I take it I move into
[1:10:50] the troubled water I'm moov into the
[1:10:52] opening of the word I'm move into the
[1:10:54] authority of the land I've had enough of
[1:10:56] this
[1:10:57] mountain Hallelujah church until we move
[1:11:00] into the anointing of God we'll always
[1:11:02] be struggling it's hard to kick against
[1:11:05] the Pricks it's hard to fight against
[1:11:07] the anointing but if we just move into
[1:11:09] it if we just let go of our own
[1:11:12] abilities if we let go of our own mind
[1:11:14] if we let go of our own wants and
[1:11:15] desires and let the anointing come and
[1:11:17] lead us
[1:11:20] hallelujah praise His holy name thank
[1:11:22] you Jesus
[1:11:24] we are not sheep without a
[1:11:26] Shepherd the anointing of the age is The
[1:11:28] Shepherd of the sheep and we've got to
[1:11:31] be led by the anointing to just let go
[1:11:34] and and be led and we sing the songs and
[1:11:36] we sing the Praises of it but when does
[1:11:38] it become a reality to us that we
[1:11:40] actually let go of what's going on in
[1:11:43] here and we let the anointing lead here
[1:11:46] and take us on into a higher Place
[1:11:49] [Music]
[1:11:50] hallelujah it's our commission in this
[1:11:52] age turn with me to Revelations 21 or
[1:11:55] they can pull it up on the
[1:11:57] screen just uh I just want to point out
[1:11:59] here some areas of
[1:12:02] why we would continue to go in the same
[1:12:04] cycle come on brother that's right
[1:12:08] Revelations
[1:12:09] 21 and the sixth chapter and he said
[1:12:12] unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega
[1:12:15] the beginning and the end I will give
[1:12:17] unto him that is the thirst of the
[1:12:18] Fountain of the Water of Life freely he
[1:12:20] that overcometh shall inherit all things
[1:12:22] somebody say all
[1:12:24] things he that overcometh shall inherit
[1:12:27] all things where do you get your
[1:12:29] inheritance in the promised land in the
[1:12:32] land of authority in the land of the
[1:12:34] Holy Ghost that's where you inherit all
[1:12:37] things and I will be his God and he
[1:12:39] shall be my
[1:12:40] sonallah
[1:12:43] but the
[1:12:45] fearful and unbelieving and abominable
[1:12:47] and murderers and hor mongers and
[1:12:49] Sorcerers and idolators and all liars
[1:12:51] shall have their part in the lake which
[1:12:52] burth with fire and brimstone which is
[1:12:54] the second death and there came into me
[1:12:56] one of the Seven Angels which had seven
[1:12:58] vials full of the seven last plagues and
[1:12:59] talked to me saying come hither and I
[1:13:01] will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife
[1:13:04] amen so the bride is not in this picture
[1:13:07] here of these lists of people that will
[1:13:10] be cast into the Lake of Fire there's
[1:13:12] another place where she's
[1:13:14] resting well shemaya when I read this I
[1:13:17] thought maybe maybe this is Sunday
[1:13:18] school stuff and and that's usually I'm
[1:13:20] pretty simple guy but I thought it was
[1:13:22] really weird that the first first thing
[1:13:23] on that
[1:13:24] list is
[1:13:26] fearful oh my now we would expect the
[1:13:29] sorcerers and the liars and the
[1:13:30] murderers and the and and and all the
[1:13:33] criminals and all the you know all these
[1:13:34] people that have done wrong and knew to
[1:13:36] do better and they did wrong and all the
[1:13:38] iniquity workers right we'd expect all
[1:13:40] them to be cast into the Lake of Fire
[1:13:42] but the first one on the list is the
[1:13:45] fearful all right church so what would
[1:13:47] keep us from walking out of this circle
[1:13:50] walking out of this cycle and walking
[1:13:52] into a place that we've never never been
[1:13:53] before it's fear it's fear upon the
[1:13:56] church that we will be called this or we
[1:13:58] would be called that or we would we
[1:14:00] would almost get there we'd fall short
[1:14:02] or I think brother Bram said this this
[1:14:04] is several quotes the greatest problem
[1:14:06] in the church is fear of failure the
[1:14:08] greatest issue in the Church of God
[1:14:10] today is a fear of failure that you
[1:14:13] would give it your all and you would
[1:14:14] still fail that you would give it your
[1:14:16] everything and you would still come
[1:14:17] short that you would you would try to
[1:14:18] cross over but you would still fall
[1:14:20] short it's a fear of failure and I think
[1:14:22] it's time that we say enough is enough
[1:14:26] enough's enough I'm not going to
[1:14:27] struggle with this fear anymore I'm not
[1:14:29] going to struggle with this anxiety over
[1:14:31] whether I'm going to make it or not
[1:14:32] anymore enough's enough I know who I am
[1:14:35] and I know where I'm going think about
[1:14:37] this friends you would never murder
[1:14:39] somebody you would never perform sorcery
[1:14:41] or witchcraft over somebody or conjure
[1:14:44] up spirits to cast Over somebody's
[1:14:46] household you think about that man that
[1:14:47] person belongs in the Lake of Fire so do
[1:14:50] the fearful and they're fearful to enter
[1:14:52] into the Promises of God and I'm not
[1:14:54] dealing with a spirit of fear where you
[1:14:56] think you're afraid to leave your house
[1:14:57] you're afraid of this you're afraid of
[1:14:59] that I'm talking about the fear of
[1:15:00] entering into the word of God come on
[1:15:03] the fear of taking God at his word to
[1:15:06] say I know he said it I know he'll
[1:15:08] perform it I know he'll see me through I
[1:15:11] know he'll bring Deliverance I know
[1:15:12] he'll bring restoration I know he'll set
[1:15:15] back it on the straight way I know that
[1:15:16] he'll bring correction when I need it I
[1:15:18] know that he'll do it because he said he
[1:15:21] would do it and I'm not fearful about
[1:15:23] whether I'm walking in the perfect will
[1:15:24] of God I know that I'm walking in the
[1:15:26] perfect will of God because I'm lining
[1:15:28] up with the word upon word upon word
[1:15:31] upon word upon word this is not a
[1:15:33] message of cans I don't know where this
[1:15:36] came from and that we have to deal with
[1:15:37] all this you can't do this and you can't
[1:15:39] do that and you can't do this when did
[1:15:40] brother bandom ever say any of that come
[1:15:44] on
[1:15:46] brother it's
[1:15:47] denominational you know it is for a man
[1:15:50] to stand up here and say you can't do
[1:15:52] this and you can't do do that and you
[1:15:53] can't do this and you can't do that and
[1:15:55] and then not have any word to back it up
[1:15:58] but it's just his own opinion being
[1:15:59] projected from the pulpit his own
[1:16:02] conviction being projected from the
[1:16:03] pulpit if the prophet didn't say it then
[1:16:05] it doesn't apply to me amen if the
[1:16:08] prophet didn't say it like that then I'm
[1:16:09] not going to eat that it's my own
[1:16:11] personal conviction that's fine but I'll
[1:16:13] never preach my own personal conviction
[1:16:15] over a Pulpit because it's my personal
[1:16:18] conviction come on but what's happened
[1:16:20] is man has gotten involved in this and
[1:16:22] they've got in between the message you
[1:16:23] see back in the day not everybody had
[1:16:26] the table app right how many people
[1:16:29] remember before before amen I remember
[1:16:32] just being a kid and and my dad had all
[1:16:34] the books and all the things laid out
[1:16:35] and and he would just study and go
[1:16:37] through and read and read and read and
[1:16:38] he would he would be up all night
[1:16:39] brother am was trying to find a quote
[1:16:41] and now I can just type in a quick
[1:16:42] search and I have that quote right in my
[1:16:44] hand right but you see it used to be
[1:16:47] that the church had to come to the man
[1:16:50] to get the word yeah they didn't have
[1:16:52] their own tapes they were real to real
[1:16:54] and they were you had to know somebody
[1:16:55] who knew somebody and you had to mail in
[1:16:56] that tape to get another tape back and
[1:16:58] you had to I was just having lunch with
[1:17:00] some people that that where you went to
[1:17:02] Brother Brand's meeting several times
[1:17:03] one of them was dedicated by brother
[1:17:05] brandom and they were telling us yeah
[1:17:06] they remember you had to send out the
[1:17:07] tape and this is pretty funny she sent
[1:17:09] out one of their tapes she was like a
[1:17:10] 15-year-old girl she sent out their real
[1:17:13] toore to come back and the real toore
[1:17:15] came back with a man's name and address
[1:17:17] on it and she remembered that name I
[1:17:20] can't remember the brother's name but it
[1:17:21] was a pretty unique name and so she
[1:17:23] remembered that name will come to find
[1:17:24] out 5 years later she'd be married to
[1:17:26] that man
[1:17:27] wow do you see how it used to work you
[1:17:29] used to send it in and have to wait for
[1:17:31] it to come back and they were doing the
[1:17:32] best they could but that was the age
[1:17:34] that they were in yes we're not in that
[1:17:37] age anymore that's right that's right
[1:17:39] brother I I don't have to wait and hear
[1:17:42] hear the filtered down word skipping
[1:17:46] over this part of this quote and
[1:17:47] skipping over this part of this quote
[1:17:49] cuz it doesn't quite Dov tail so I'm
[1:17:50] just going to cut this part out and you
[1:17:52] see how the church ended up in
[1:17:53] denomination and they ended up scattered
[1:17:55] and wondering and confused and walking
[1:17:57] in circles because the man of God back
[1:17:59] then felt that the right thing to do was
[1:18:01] to just to preach the agenda that he was
[1:18:03] given I'm not saying it was a bad man or
[1:18:06] they were bad that was just the age they
[1:18:07] were living in that was the direction
[1:18:09] they wanted the church to go in but
[1:18:10] we're not in that direction anymore
[1:18:13] we're coming out to the exit to the
[1:18:14] promised land again and now we're not
[1:18:17] just relying on what the man has to say
[1:18:19] behind the pulpit or what he might read
[1:18:20] to us or the part of the quote that he
[1:18:22] wants us to catch we are we have the
[1:18:24] full word that's why I I I don't know
[1:18:27] how you could believe that we're not in
[1:18:28] the age of the open word you have it
[1:18:30] literally in the palm of your hand you
[1:18:32] could search any time anywhere any place
[1:18:35] you could search exactly what the
[1:18:37] prophet said about it you could hear the
[1:18:39] The Voice come through your phone you
[1:18:41] anywhere you're at you can hear the
[1:18:42] prophet speak we did not have that 20
[1:18:45] years
[1:18:46] ago we did not have that 30 years ago
[1:18:49] and you see how how it's not the fault
[1:18:51] of these men but they just weren't given
[1:18:53] the authority that we're given they were
[1:18:55] only given maybe 600
[1:18:57] books right brother Terry you remember
[1:19:00] just a few tapes a handful my dad came
[1:19:03] in the message on five tapes and he had
[1:19:05] those five tapes I think for the first
[1:19:06] five years and that's all he
[1:19:09] had but we're not in that age we're not
[1:19:13] there anymore we're not back in that in
[1:19:16] the in the buggy age we're in another
[1:19:19] age the word is open unto us it's in the
[1:19:23] of your hand let me say it like this
[1:19:24] friend you've got no excuse you've got
[1:19:27] no excuse that you're not walking in the
[1:19:29] perfect word you can't blame it on the
[1:19:31] pastor anymore you can't blame it on
[1:19:33] soand so anymore you've got the same
[1:19:35] access to the word that they have you've
[1:19:38] got the same access to the word that
[1:19:40] anybody has you can you can read every
[1:19:42] quote that I'm reading this morning the
[1:19:43] pal me I know in our church there's a
[1:19:45] there's guys that read the same quote at
[1:19:47] the same time the preachers reaching in
[1:19:48] they searching in there it Marvels me
[1:19:49] Brother Sam that would never have been
[1:19:51] possible 10 or 15 years ago of course
[1:19:54] the devil's going to try to use that to
[1:19:55] bring correction and to fact check and
[1:19:57] to do that let the devil do what he's
[1:19:59] going to do but what the reality of it
[1:20:01] is is it has opened a source to us it's
[1:20:04] opened a fountain in the church that we
[1:20:06] can draw from this word we can draw from
[1:20:09] this message any place any time anywhere
[1:20:13] under any condition we can draw from the
[1:20:15] word and that is how we break free from
[1:20:18] that cycle we're not stuck in a rut
[1:20:21] we're not stuck in a cycle if we are
[1:20:24] it's our own fault when you have the
[1:20:26] word he sent his word in this age that
[1:20:29] we could use it as a weapon to break
[1:20:32] free from the
[1:20:33] cycle I think that we have enough is
[1:20:36] enough of what we say about ourselves of
[1:20:39] what so and so says about ourselves I
[1:20:40] think it's time brother Amos that we say
[1:20:42] what God said about us and God said that
[1:20:45] I will have a church without spot
[1:20:48] without wrinkle I will have a perfect
[1:20:50] bride I will have a perfect believer she
[1:20:53] will walk step and step with my word she
[1:20:55] will not go to the left or the right but
[1:20:57] she will continue on in everything every
[1:21:00] line every dot every title everything
[1:21:02] will be lined up with according to how I
[1:21:04] have presented it to
[1:21:07] her I think we we talk about us like God
[1:21:10] talks about us let's say what God said
[1:21:13] about us God said that we would be
[1:21:16] [Applause]
[1:21:17] victorious we ask us we say well I'm
[1:21:20] fearful God said you're Victorious yes
[1:21:23] You' got to change your mentality of who
[1:21:25] you are I'm not I'm not down I'm not a
[1:21:28] slave I'm not in bondage I'm not in fear
[1:21:30] I'm not just barely going to make it I'm
[1:21:32] not just squeaking in here God has
[1:21:34] elected me before the foundation of the
[1:21:36] world and he deposited with me a seed
[1:21:39] and at the appointed time Abraham was
[1:21:42] just a regular old
[1:21:44] guy right worked a regular old job
[1:21:47] worship the same Idols that everybody
[1:21:48] else worshiped there was nothing special
[1:21:51] about him to anybody else said there but
[1:21:53] God knew God knew on the inside of Abram
[1:21:56] there was a seed in there and at that
[1:21:59] time God would would wake up that Jean
[1:22:01] seed is this all right this morning amen
[1:22:05] he'd wake it up and Abram would become
[1:22:08] Abraham and there would be a name change
[1:22:10] happened there and nothing on the
[1:22:11] outside looked any different Branson he
[1:22:13] looked exactly the same to everybody
[1:22:14] else but everything about his his
[1:22:16] disposition changed that's true oh the
[1:22:20] wrinkles didn't just fall off right away
[1:22:23] he didn't just stand up straight right
[1:22:24] away but he got a revelation and then he
[1:22:28] continued in that Revelation to know
[1:22:30] that he was an elected Son of God and
[1:22:32] think about this Abraham didn't have
[1:22:34] anybody else that believed like him come
[1:22:37] on brother that's right all right come
[1:22:39] on
[1:22:40] now nobody come on nobody believed like
[1:22:45] Abraham believed he went out on his own
[1:22:48] and under the his countenance changed
[1:22:50] people came to him his nephew said
[1:22:53] what's different about you H there's
[1:22:55] something changed about you he said God
[1:22:56] came to visit me God which Idol was it
[1:22:59] no God came to me the original God came
[1:23:02] to me oh my you can think how many
[1:23:05] people thought Abraham had lost his mind
[1:23:07] that's right come on oh you yeah you're
[1:23:09] real special guy you're just a regular
[1:23:12] brick layer like everybody else I saw
[1:23:14] you worshiping Idols last Sunday said
[1:23:16] but it's
[1:23:17] different come on Brother come
[1:23:21] on and Abraham didn't just walk out and
[1:23:23] complete Victory that's right it was the
[1:23:25] trial of Abraham's Faith to maintain the
[1:23:29] promise you know Abraham doubted and
[1:23:30] laughed at the promise of God before
[1:23:32] Sarah did before Sarah ever laughed
[1:23:35] Abraham laughed the scripture says it
[1:23:37] that's why I know the Bible is true
[1:23:39] because it writes the truth of the
[1:23:40] matter whether it's bad or whether it's
[1:23:42] good it writes the truth of the matter
[1:23:44] and Abraham doubted the promise of God
[1:23:46] before Sarah ever doubted the promise of
[1:23:48] God it's recorded in the scripture right
[1:23:51] that's the beginning of Abraham's life
[1:23:53] but I like it in Romans 4 where it says
[1:23:56] Abraham staggered not at the promise of
[1:23:59] God but was strong in
[1:24:02] faith shiah how does that work how does
[1:24:05] a guy that records the first half of his
[1:24:07] life and he staggered all over he didn't
[1:24:09] even know what direction to go he had
[1:24:11] lot pick the direction cuz he didn't
[1:24:13] know where to go and he said you choose
[1:24:14] and I'll go the other way didn't know
[1:24:17] where he was going but yet when it's
[1:24:19] written about him and Paul was a man who
[1:24:21] would tell you the truth no matter how
[1:24:22] it seemed but when Paul wrote about
[1:24:24] Abraham's life he said Abraham staggered
[1:24:28] not staggered not Glory you know what
[1:24:30] that tells me Josiah it's not how you
[1:24:33] start out it's how you finish it's not
[1:24:36] it's not how you were born into this or
[1:24:38] you were born into that or you had this
[1:24:39] inability or you had a you you got a
[1:24:42] quick short work to come into it's how
[1:24:44] you
[1:24:45] finish it's how you finish Church we've
[1:24:48] all come in and we've been in corrupt we
[1:24:50] were in closed Ministry we I grew up I I
[1:24:52] wasn't allowed to fellowship with
[1:24:53] anybody I didn't know there was youth
[1:24:54] camps I didn't know there was you I
[1:24:56] didn't know there was this brother or
[1:24:57] that brother I never heard anybody's
[1:24:59] name in the message except for our
[1:25:00] church wow and now I've got friends all
[1:25:03] over the world by the grace of God and
[1:25:07] this message of unity it's not how you
[1:25:10] start it's how you finish many of you
[1:25:13] started out in a bar stool somewhere
[1:25:15] smoking cigarettes before you're old
[1:25:17] enough to buy them drink it before
[1:25:18] you're old enough to buy it it doesn't
[1:25:20] matter how you start out it matters how
[1:25:23] you finish and if you still have breath
[1:25:25] in your lung this morning then you're in
[1:25:27] the Finish hour he's not giving up on

[1:25:35] thing you think how many times the devil

[1:25:46] win you're still here spirits of suicide
[1:25:49] that try to take your life you're still
[1:25:51] here this morning why because he lost
[1:25:53] because God had a purpose for you and
[1:25:56] you're still here this morning because
[1:25:57] it's not how you start it's how you
[1:26:01] finish I think it's time that we say
[1:26:03] enough is enough it's time to finish
[1:26:06] this I'm crossing over I'm laying it
[1:26:08] down I'm running the race I'm giving up
[1:26:11] everything why would we give up so much
[1:26:13] and then and fall short of giving up
[1:26:16] everything
[1:26:17] Amen brother Brandon would say it like
[1:26:19] this you got just enough religion to be
[1:26:21] miserable
[1:26:22] yeah because you're giving up so much
[1:26:25] but you haven't give up everything and
[1:26:27] as soon as you give up everything it
[1:26:29] doesn't matter what you give
[1:26:30] up I'm not I'm not I don't do those
[1:26:33] things because I don't want to do
[1:26:34] them it's not something I gave up I just
[1:26:37] didn't want to do it I don't want to be
[1:26:38] that I don't want to be identified with
[1:26:40] that why because I've given up
[1:26:41] everything and let his holy spirit tell
[1:26:44] me and dictate to me what I should and
[1:26:45] should not do so then I don't have to
[1:26:47] wonder about it I don't have to question
[1:26:49] about it I don't have to get down and
[1:26:50] say I wonder if I should do this brother
[1:26:52] said if there's a question about it
[1:26:53] don't do it
[1:26:59] amen praise the Lord hallelujah too
[1:27:02] fearful preach to enter in he says
[1:27:05] that's where the church is you're always
[1:27:07] scared it's not going to happen wow
[1:27:10] that's the reason it don't happen when
[1:27:13] that when love casts out fear when
[1:27:15] you've got love fear is gone Lord but as
[1:27:18] long as you got fear love cannot
[1:27:22] operate it right
[1:27:27] Hallelujah what's the Capstone
[1:27:30] Amos as long as you've got fear love
[1:27:34] cannot operate the Capstone cannot
[1:27:37] operate in your life the Capone
[1:27:39] Authority cannot come down and Crown you
[1:27:41] because you've got fear in there and
[1:27:42] fear and love cannot abide together
[1:27:44] death and life cannot abide together
[1:27:46] Darkness and Light cannot abide together
[1:27:48] fear and love cannot abide together wow
[1:27:53] so as long as there's fear in there love
[1:27:55] will never crown that I think enough is
[1:27:59] enough I don't want to have fear I don't
[1:28:02] want to have fear of of this or what
[1:28:04] might happen or I might fail or I might
[1:28:06] give up or I might be washed to the side
[1:28:07] or I might be a shipwreck one of those
[1:28:09] Believers that makes it 30 years down
[1:28:10] the road or 50 years down the road and
[1:28:12] then they end up just walking away at
[1:28:13] the end I don't want it that's a fear
[1:28:16] that's not going to be you that's not
[1:28:18] your testimony cuz that's not your role
[1:28:20] in this thing you've got to see seed
[1:28:22] within
[1:28:23] you Eve is not your type you've got
[1:28:27] another seed within you that will finish
[1:28:30] this that will make it all the way God
[1:28:32] didn't bring you this far to leave you
[1:28:34] now but he brought you this far cuz he
[1:28:36] knew you would have the goods to finish
[1:28:38] the race cuz he put him in there you
[1:28:40] didn't come by yourself brother but God
[1:28:43] put a seed within you that he could hook
[1:28:45] his anchor and he could pull you into
[1:28:46] the house of God this morning it's by
[1:28:49] his word that he's doing this it's it's
[1:28:52] not by your strength it's by his
[1:28:53] strength all we've got to do is let go
[1:28:55] and be led say Lord enough's enough I'm
[1:28:58] being led by the spirit of
[1:29:00] God haven't we had enough of trying to
[1:29:03] turn the car

[1:31:23] left church for years but you're
[1:31:28] here what was it Sister Kim it was the
[1:31:31] gene seed of God with inside you that
[1:31:34] even though you were wandering around he
[1:31:35] hadn't lost you he hadn't lost track of
[1:31:37] you he didn't he didn't lose place of
[1:31:39] where you were at but he had his eye on
[1:31:41] you the whole time and at that time you
[1:31:43] would be resurrected and that seed would
[1:31:45] be activated and it would be Quicken to
[1:31:48] the word and there is nothing that would
[1:31:50] stop you now from being inside the doors
[1:31:52] when they're open what was it it was a
[1:31:54] miraculous thing that happened in your
[1:31:55] life the supernatural God came down and
[1:31:58] quickened a seed within you amen you
[1:32:01] can't explain it you can't put your
[1:32:02] finger on it you don't know but it's
[1:32:05] there it's there there's a deposit
[1:32:08] within you that Christ made before the
[1:32:10] foundation of the world it's there and
[1:32:13] at the time he'll activate it why do we
[1:32:16] have to fear I've got quotes for days on
[1:32:18] this for fear fear fear fear fear we've
[1:32:20] got no reason to fear
[1:32:22] yes amen no
[1:32:26] reason that's right if we could conquer
[1:32:30] fear anything is
[1:32:33] possible fear is the anti to belief if
[1:32:37] we could conquer fear only believe which
[1:32:41] means no
[1:32:42] fear all things somebody say all things

[1:33:08] not that's had a power of the devil I
[1:33:10] just feel to give that to you go search

[1:33:35] not going to go listen to that you're
[1:33:36] not going to no we wouldn't do it anyway

[1:33:41] take him at his word and his word says
[1:33:44] that he already has defeated every enemy
[1:33:47] his word says that he resurrected and
[1:33:49] gave gifts unto men and those gifts well

[1:41:35] discernments in one prayer for one
[1:41:38] individual 21 individual discernments of
[1:41:41] detail all right brother you could guess

[1:41:46] nature if you grew up on the streets you
[1:41:48] understand human nature pretty well I
[1:41:49] grew up in a little rough neighborhood I
[1:41:51] understand how human nature Works a
[1:41:52] little
[1:41:53] bit and you can guess at a lot of
[1:41:57] stuff people are all kind of the same
[1:41:59] you're right you can guess right this
[1:42:02] was not a guess Daniel that's right this
[1:42:04] Prophet was not guessing amen this was
[1:42:06] not a 21 individual
[1:42:10] discernments in one person's life now

[1:42:15] things about

[1:42:41] different anyways he was not
[1:42:45] guessing this was not just a stab in the
[1:42:47] dark say I hope this lands come on
[1:42:50] Brother come on come on but you see the
[1:42:52] gift of discernment operates like this
[1:42:55] when go when Jesus was having that
[1:42:56] interaction with the woman of the well
[1:42:57] he wasn't reading your thoughts he was
[1:42:59] reading her heart and he was looking
[1:43:01] into her heart and she he was pulling
[1:43:03] out what was on the inside of her heart
[1:43:06] and delivering it back to her and no
[1:43:08] doubt the word has done that many times
[1:43:09] to you through the operation of Hebrews
[1:43:12] 4:12 in operation discernment pulling
[1:43:14] out of what's in your heart and pulling
[1:43:16] it out to to some of you thought nobody
[1:43:18] would ever know that but that man spoke
[1:43:19] exactly well that man had no idea what
[1:43:21] he was saying but it was the word in
[1:43:23] operation that is still a discerner of
[1:43:25] the thoughts and intents of our heart
[1:43:27] and it's still active today it did not
[1:43:29] stop in 1965 but Hebrews 4:12 and
[1:43:32] Hebrews 138 are still the same word
[1:43:34] today that they were back then amen amen
[1:43:38] praise the Lord he was not guessing amen
[1:43:42] but he knew what was on the inside of
[1:43:44] the heart that's the way a gift of
[1:43:46] discernment works but this was not just
[1:43:48] a regular gift of discernment this was
[1:43:50] the Messiah sign now this was not in my
[1:43:52] notes and I didn't have this in my mind
[1:43:54] so we're just going to trust the Lord to
[1:43:55] go here this morning it was the Messiah
[1:43:58] sign in
[1:44:00] operation amen he opened the heart of
[1:44:03] the woman at the well he opened the
[1:44:04] heart of Abraham he opened the heart of
[1:44:06] Sarah and he spoke back to them what was
[1:44:09] on the inside of their heart and by that
[1:44:11] they knew this is Supernatural this is
[1:44:14] God this is Elohim Abraham called him
[1:44:16] Elohim the highest name in the land
[1:44:19] Elohim has come MDC has come by just one
[1:44:24] one one miracle coming out of his
[1:44:26] heart and in this age Christ has come
[1:44:29] amen and I'm not just talking about the
[1:44:31] people on the prayer line think about
[1:44:33] this that that that the the gift of
[1:44:35] discernment that fell in this age
[1:44:37] through the prophet William Brandon will
[1:44:38] never be matched come on brother now I
[1:44:41] believe in individual Gifts of
[1:44:42] discernment in the body where God might
[1:44:44] give this sister or this brother we've
[1:44:46] got sisters in our church that have
[1:44:47] wrote out exact dreams of conversations
[1:44:49] that happened in the back room of the
[1:44:50] pastor 's office exactly to detail it's
[1:44:53] still in operation sure God uses men to
[1:44:56] tell you what's on the inside of your
[1:44:57] heart what you were praying about what
[1:44:58] you were thinking about the the the gift
[1:45:00] of discernment is in the body but it's
[1:45:02] not like this gift that was in brother
[1:45:04] brandom this was the Messiah sign it is
[1:45:08] the true sign of discernment of the word
[1:45:11] not not there will not be another we're
[1:45:14] not waiting for another gift of
[1:45:15] discernment like that there's only one
[1:45:18] Prophet to an age and he had the gift of
[1:45:21] the word in his life now think about
[1:45:23] this he was able to 8,000 something
[1:45:25] people and how many people of tape did
[1:45:28] that gift operate on and he was able to
[1:45:30] tell them where they were from their
[1:45:31] name their address their what they were
[1:45:33] thinking what their brother-in-law said
[1:45:34] to them the day before and that wasn't a
[1:45:36] man he wasn't guessing at that it was
[1:45:39] God it was the operation of discernment
[1:45:42] opening
[1:45:43] Hearts amen but something changed in the
[1:45:46] man's Ministry come on now and that gift
[1:45:49] of discernment got greater
[1:45:51] and he got stronger and he began to go
[1:45:53] into another pole of his ministry so he
[1:45:55] wasn't just opening the hearts of the
[1:45:57] people yeah go ahead he was opening and
[1:46:01] Discerning the heart of God and he was
[1:46:03] opening the heart of God brother Amos
[1:46:05] and he was portraying what was inside of
[1:46:07] the heart of God and he was putting it
[1:46:10] on display this was not just some gift
[1:46:12] of discernment but this was a messic
[1:46:14] sign in our age that would be able to
[1:46:16] access the very heart of God and bring
[1:46:19] it back down to us to tell you this is
[1:46:21] what God thinks about you in his
[1:46:25] heart that does something to me I don't
[1:46:28] hear the message of the hour in here I'm
[1:46:30] not going to make it I don't listen to
[1:46:32] The Prophet's voice and hear that I'm
[1:46:34] just not going to have enough faith I
[1:46:35] don't put on the tape and I feel down
[1:46:37] and out I'm never going to make it when
[1:46:39] I put on a message when I put on a tape
[1:46:41] I hear I'm going to make it I've already
[1:46:43] made it I've seen you I've seen you on
[1:46:46] the other side I've seen you in the
[1:46:48] heart of God I see that you are the The
[1:46:50] Works of God expressed in this age
[1:46:53] you're his thoughts cast out you're his
[1:46:55] you're the back part of his mind on
[1:46:57] display I've seen it in his heart and
[1:46:59] that gift of the Messiah sign working
[1:47:01] and telling me where I am in the heart
[1:47:03] of God
[1:47:05] Amen yes oh my I see that brother Bram
[1:47:09] said this in the church AG book the
[1:47:11] thoughts of God are Eternal and they are
[1:47:13] real he says if you can see this you
[1:47:16] shall see many things let me say church
[1:47:19] if you could grasp that last statement
[1:47:21] not because I'm powerful and wise but
[1:47:22] because it's the truth of the message if
[1:47:24] you could grasp it you will see many
[1:47:26] victories in your life this message
[1:47:29] didn't come to confuse it didn't come to
[1:47:31] divide or cause doctrinal disputes or
[1:47:33] who's bigger or who's better or whose
[1:47:35] church is is nicer it didn't come for
[1:47:37] any of that it came to open the heart of
[1:47:41] God into this age it's Way Beyond
[1:47:44] individual discernments of you came from
[1:47:46] this town and you came from this there's
[1:47:47] a water tower and it's blue your house
[1:47:49] is such and such such it's way bigger
[1:47:51] than that now there was a turn in the
[1:47:54] ministry and his ministry began to open
[1:47:57] up the heart of God and to discern what
[1:47:59] was on the inside of God's heart and
[1:48:02] repeat it back to the people and this is
[1:48:04] what God Said and this is what God
[1:48:06] thinks that's why he was not guessing
[1:48:08] brother Kevin but he knew the heart of
[1:48:13] God don't ever ask me why I'm a message
[1:48:16] believer you're going to get an
[1:48:19] earful why do you follow that man what
[1:48:22] man
[1:48:25] on why are you worshiping that man what
[1:48:27] man are you talking about are you
[1:48:29] talking about the man William Brandon
[1:48:31] that God so loved that he allowed to be
[1:48:33] in his picture come on I love that man
[1:48:37] I've never worshiped him a day of my
[1:48:39] life that's right I've never bowed down
[1:48:41] to him I've never baptized in his name
[1:48:44] I've never ended a prayer in his name
[1:48:46] I've never let a tape perform my wedding
[1:48:48] I've never let any of these things I
[1:48:49] don't worship a
[1:48:51] man but I worship the light that's
[1:48:53] hanging over him and if that light would
[1:48:56] be willing to take a picture with him
[1:48:58] then I think we ought to give him due
[1:48:59] credit and we ought to protect him and
[1:49:01] we ought to stand up for his name and
[1:49:03] not let it be slandered in the street
[1:49:05] like it's just some other preacher or he
[1:49:07] was just some other reformer or he was
[1:49:09] just some other guy with the microphone
[1:49:11] no God was so pleased to dwell in that
[1:49:13] man that he gave him the gift of the
[1:49:15] Messiah sign that he could open up God
[1:49:18] chose brother brandom to to be the
[1:49:20] mouthpiece of his own heart
[1:49:23] Hallelujah that's why I'm a message
[1:49:26] believer and that's why I will stay in a
[1:49:28] message taught church that preaches the
[1:49:31] message without fear or favor not to
[1:49:33] cater to this or to pull to that but
[1:49:35] preach the message preach the message of
[1:49:38] the hour and it'll set the captive free
[1:49:41] I don't have to work you up I don't have
[1:49:43] to psychologize you I don't have to talk
[1:49:45] you into it just preach the
[1:49:48] message and the the seed will
[1:49:53] respond oh I don't like this I don't
[1:49:55] like that I like the
[1:49:58] message Hallelujah my appetite is only
[1:50:03] for the
[1:50:04] message glory to God blessed is he who
[1:50:08] hunger and thirsteth after righteousness
[1:50:11] for he shall somebody say shall he shall
[1:50:14] be filled

[1:50:23] Hallelujah I can't wait for the church
[1:50:25] doors to open Sister Kim cuz I am
[1:50:29] [Music]
[1:50:31] hungering I am hungering I am thirsting
[1:50:35] after righteousness and if I know I can
[1:50:37] come to a place where the word is
[1:50:39] exalted above a man's opinion where the
[1:50:42] word is exalted above a theory or a
[1:50:44] thought or a good idea or a good
[1:50:47] homedical thought I believe that if we
[1:50:49] come into the presence of where that
[1:50:51] word is exalted above all else we shall
[1:50:56] be filled glory amen glory I think it's
[1:50:59] enough is enough of coming to church and
[1:51:01] leaving with empty vessels the message
[1:51:03] is doing its job are we allowing it to
[1:51:06] work in our life
[1:51:11] amen hallu it's come to do what it
[1:51:13] promised am yes sure it did you can't
[1:51:16] find a
[1:51:17] mistake bless the Lord
[1:51:22] brother Brandon begged brother Terry
[1:51:25] begged for 30 something years behind a
[1:51:28] Pulpit please come and tell me where I'm
[1:51:31] wrong
[1:51:33] anybody
[1:51:35] anybody thousands millions of people
[1:51:38] millions of people got that invitation
[1:51:42] anybody I'll give you a
[1:51:44] moment nobody amen crickets Men actually
[1:51:49] exited the building
[1:51:50] yeah they did you cannot find a
[1:51:53] flaw if you take the Bible as your
[1:51:55] absolute you will not find a flaw in
[1:51:57] this teaching the man sure as soon as
[1:52:00] you make it about a man you're off
[1:52:01] anyways it was never about a man it was
[1:52:04] about the pillar of fire that came in
[1:52:06] this age and open the word unto us and
[1:52:08] if you recognize that it was that light
[1:52:10] that came in this age and it was that
[1:52:12] light that struck the lens of that
[1:52:14] camera and it was that light that struck
[1:52:15] the lens of your life if you recognize
[1:52:17] that it was that light you'll never look
[1:52:20] to the left to the right you'll never
[1:52:21] try to find a flaw because that light
[1:52:23] has activated the sea with inside you
[1:52:26] and by a supernatural light something
[1:52:28] came awake inside you the same Pillar of
[1:52:31] Fire the same anointing this the the the
[1:52:34] same Holy
[1:52:35] Ghost came into our life and woke us
[1:52:40] up that's why I'm not looking for
[1:52:42] another I'm not looking to go somewhere
[1:52:44] else or to to think about another
[1:52:46] theology I'm not looking we can quote
[1:52:48] these men of God spurgeon's a good man
[1:52:50] and and no doubt pink was a good man and
[1:52:52] all but they were not the Messiah sign
[1:52:55] in this age and we can we can share some
[1:52:57] quotes and some thoughts and they had
[1:52:59] some good ideas but Spurgeon was a
[1:53:02] trinitarian why are we going to compare
[1:53:04] him to the Vindicated word of God I'm
[1:53:06] not preaching against sharing quotes
[1:53:08] from Spurgeon I think some of them are
[1:53:10] really good but don't compare them
[1:53:12] brother Brandon was not just another
[1:53:14] preacher he was not just another man
[1:53:16] with a Pulpit he was not another Billy
[1:53:18] Graham or an oral Roberts or a Charles
[1:53:20] Spurgeon he was the Vindicated word
[1:53:23] mouthpiece of this age and we will not
[1:53:26] look for another but we will stay only
[1:53:29] with the word
[1:53:32] hallelujah hallelujah and when we stay
[1:53:34] only in the word all
[1:53:38] fear Glory all fear is gone because I
[1:53:44] know I Know Who Holds my
[1:53:47] future every bit of it yes all fear
[1:53:51] Hallelujah imagine what it's like to
[1:53:52] wake up and all fear is gone oh oh my
[1:53:56] not what's going to happen today and
[1:53:58] it's Monday
[1:54:00] again Josiah what clients am I going to
[1:54:02] have to deal with this week but imagine
[1:54:04] waking up on a morning come on
[1:54:08] now I'm
[1:54:11] free praise the Lord I'm
[1:54:15] free no longer bound yes sir amen no
[1:54:20] more fear hold in
[1:54:23] me Glory my if we could wake up that
[1:54:26] that way every morning thank you Jesus
[1:54:29] thank you Jesus thank you Jesus
[1:54:31] hallelujah thank you Jesus every devil
[1:54:33] in hell we don't know what to do with
[1:54:36] them Hallelujah we don't know what to do
[1:54:38] with them we don't know how to handle
[1:54:39] them and I'm trying to close here but
[1:54:40] brother B said there's a place you can
[1:54:42] go in this word where the devil cannot
[1:54:45] follow youen he's not
[1:54:48] free glory to God I'm going say it again
[1:54:53] the devil ain't
[1:54:55] free so there's a place you can go where
[1:54:58] he can't go and it's not great
[1:55:00] Revelation it's not studying the seal
[1:55:01] book so hard that you understand every
[1:55:03] period of it it's a place of
[1:55:08] Freedom if you have a feeling of
[1:55:10] disparity in your life that anointing is
[1:55:12] from a demon come on they were cast out
[1:55:16] of heaven in despair having no hope for
[1:55:20] a future and if that's how you feel or
[1:55:23] that's what you deal with in your life
[1:55:24] it's an anointing of a devil and it
[1:55:26] needs to be removed off of your life
[1:55:29] amen we have a future our Future's clear
[1:55:33] we know where we're going we know that
[1:55:35] he's coming back for us we know his
[1:55:37] future his future is to be cast into the
[1:55:40] Lake of Fire to have no more trouble to
[1:55:43] not ever plague another life to not ever
[1:55:45] come against another believer to not
[1:55:47] ever bring another accusation he has
[1:55:49] spent his entire existence accusing you
[1:55:52] Branson day and night the accuser of the
[1:55:55] Brethren has accused you day and night
[1:55:57] but there's coming a day glory and now
[1:56:01] is Glory when he will be shut up in the
[1:56:06] Lake of Fire and where will we be
[1:56:10] walking in
[1:56:12] Freedom I think it's time we say
[1:56:14] enough's enough playing around with this
[1:56:16] devil thank you Jesus stop dwelling
[1:56:19] where he can access stop dwelling in
[1:56:22] places where he can get to
[1:56:24] you he cannot go into Freedom that's
[1:56:27] right he's not free he's Bound by a
[1:56:30] chain of circumstance these are all
[1:56:32] scriptures friends use the word against
[1:56:34] him he's bound he can't go where you can
[1:56:38] go Jes if the music players would come
[1:56:43] we lived in a in a in a community
[1:56:45] brother Junior knows too much about it
[1:56:48] uh we driving down the road and they'll
[1:56:49] be horse and buggies in the middle of
[1:56:50] the road yeah going maybe 10 miles an
[1:56:53] hour and you're going 70 come over a
[1:56:56] hill and there's a horse and buggy in
[1:56:57] the road and you're slamming on the
[1:56:58] brakes and watch out
[1:57:00] and but they do that by choice they do
[1:57:03] right but 120 years ago that was itm
[1:57:08] sure that was the climax a horse and
[1:57:12] buggy
[1:57:13] right fast as you can get shemaya you
[1:57:16] got got you got a four team horse man
[1:57:19] you were on the roll that's as fast as
[1:57:22] you could
[1:57:23] go then came the
[1:57:25] car slow at first little model T P maybe
[1:57:31] get three four miles faster than a
[1:57:34] horse harder to drive than a
[1:57:37] horse then a couple years down the
[1:57:41] road another car come out a little
[1:57:44] faster a little faster bigger engine
[1:57:45] brother bam said that they thought that
[1:57:47] they could reach the speed of 30 m an
[1:57:48] hour they lift off the Earth and be gone
[1:57:50] into
[1:57:52] atmosphere broke the sound barrier in
[1:57:54] 60s sometime maybe late 50s I don't
[1:57:58] remember when it was nobody thought that
[1:57:59] ever be possible come on then the plane
[1:58:04] came faster than any car could ever go a
[1:58:07] little rough at first they got it
[1:58:09] figured out they got it stabilized and
[1:58:12] now we can cross the globe and few
[1:58:15] [Music]
[1:58:16] minutes they thought that's the fastest
[1:58:18] they'd ever go
[1:58:20] but then came the rocket yes sir they
[1:58:22] thought there's a moon out there I'd
[1:58:25] like to go to that
[1:58:26] Moon little shaky at first couple mess
[1:58:29] ups couple mishaps yeah yeah come on but
[1:58:32] they got it yeah they got it and now
[1:58:34] that rocket is open where anybody with
[1:58:36] enough
[1:58:39] money but you see what I find
[1:58:41] interesting junior is in the same age
[1:58:43] where Tesla is sending people up in
[1:58:44] Rockets I can come over a hill in Ohio
[1:58:48] and there's a person in a
[1:58:52] buggy that's as much as they want to
[1:58:56] access you can stay in some old cold
[1:58:59] formal religion you can stay in the
[1:59:01] light of another age you can stay back
[1:59:04] having to having to deal with what what
[1:59:06] the man with the books once told you or
[1:59:08] you can actually look at the word for
[1:59:09] yourself and you can enter into a place
[1:59:12] of Liberty where the devil cannot go
[1:59:14] he's not built to go where you can go
[1:59:17] he's not built to climb where you can CL
[1:59:19] CL he physically is incapable of getting
[1:59:21] to where you can get in the word I think
[1:59:24] enough is enough of of dwelling down
[1:59:27] here in this realm where he can access
[1:59:29] us and he can pick on us and he can kick
[1:59:31] us around and he's got authority over us
[1:59:33] we're still in his land I think it's
[1:59:35] time we
[1:59:39] cross there's a land just across
[1:59:44] there I think it's time I think it's
[1:59:46] time we take a
[1:59:48] step
[1:59:50] H I'm
[1:59:53] done enough's enough
[1:59:58] amen instead of throwing in the towel on
[2:00:00] this belief why don't you throw in the
[2:00:02] towel of dealing with the devil and say
[2:00:04] enough's enough I'm pulling the gloves
[2:00:06] off I'm going higher than you can go I'm
[2:00:09] going deeper than you can go I'm getting

[2:04:18] never be able to
[2:04:21] say he doesn't have access to that he
[2:04:24] doesn't have access to This Promise
[2:04:26] you've been given and This Promise is to
[2:04:29] you thank you Jesus it's to
[2:04:34] you it's not to your neighbor it's not
[2:04:37] just for your daddy or your mom or your
[2:04:39] sister or so and so or the pastor or the
[2:04:41] preacher This Promise men and Brethren
[2:04:45] This Promise is to you and to your
[2:04:49] children and to as many as are far off
[2:04:52] as many as the Lord Our God shall
[2:04:55] call God to our children yep why do you
[2:04:59] think Peter worded it like that it's
[2:05:02] your promise but it's also the promise
[2:05:04] for your children amen and your
[2:05:06] children's
[2:05:09] children praise the
[2:05:12] Lord you don't think God's able to wake
[2:05:14] up the seed within
[2:05:17] them
[2:05:19] some come off church pews some are just
[2:05:22] Hypocrites workers of iniquity but one
[2:05:23] day the seed woke up maybe they didn't
[2:05:25] have that night and day transformation
[2:05:27] cuz they played the part well but
[2:05:29] something woke up inside them
[2:05:31] amen for others maybe they're out in
[2:05:33] drugs alcohol and women maybe just the
[2:05:36] life that they don't care about church
[2:05:38] they don't care about this they think
[2:05:39] you're in a wrong thing or they think
[2:05:41] about this or
[2:05:43] that but the seed
[2:05:45] Glory that's right prevails over every
[2:05:49] Circumstance the seed prevails over
[2:05:52] every inability Abraham was just a
[2:05:55] regular Idol worshiper yes sir but the
[2:05:58] [Music]
[2:06:00] seed and the only thing that wakes that
[2:06:03] seed up is the quickened word the same
[2:06:05] pillar of the
[2:06:07] fire one
[2:06:11] moment thank you Jesus one
[2:06:14] moment that gift of discernment would go
[2:06:16] to work in a little cabin one time that
[2:06:19] Messiah sign and he would access the
[2:06:21] heart of God and God would tell him what
[2:06:23] do you need he'd say I need a
[2:06:25] squirrel that squirrel would come and he
[2:06:27] would take that witness back to a little
[2:06:31] cabin brother Amos it she didn't have an
[2:06:34] LL she didn't have a PhD she didn't have
[2:06:38] a dictionary that's right it wasn't even
[2:06:41] good English brother
[2:06:43] Terry but she believed the message that
[2:06:45] came forth so much with everything that
[2:06:48] was in her she said that ain't nothing
[2:06:51] but the truth Glory thank you Jes
[2:06:53] Brother Sam it wasn't a worked up
[2:06:55] emotion there wasn't some glorious thing
[2:06:57] that came down he said that ain't
[2:06:59] nothing but the truth but when she said
[2:07:01] that he said that the anointing in that
[2:07:03] room was greater than the anointing at
[2:07:04] the dawn of creation Now you think about
[2:07:07] that if a daughter of God who don't have
[2:07:09] two cents to her name in a little old
[2:07:11] cabin that leaked and was and was not
[2:07:13] windproof and didn't have running water
[2:07:15] they didn't have a bathroom inside if if
[2:07:17] a little old can access that kind of
[2:07:20] anointing by saying the message ain't
[2:07:22] nothing but the truth then how about you
[2:07:25] this morning how about you who know the
[2:07:27] book from front to back how about you
[2:07:29] that know every promise in here that's
[2:07:31] available to you how about you that have
[2:07:33] no excuse of why we are walking in
[2:07:35] defeat this morning when we've been
[2:07:37] given total
[2:07:38] Victory it ain't nothing but the truth
[2:07:41] oh but you don't know how far my kids
[2:07:43] are gone hady right didn't think about
[2:07:46] it that's right he said that anointing
[2:07:48] that dropped in there I can imagine I've
[2:07:50] been in some anointings in my life I
[2:07:52] don't even know how she got the words
[2:07:55] out wow
[2:07:57] anything your heart desires will be
[2:08:00] given unto you oh my she didn't say well
[2:08:04] if my kids have a
[2:08:07] seed Hallelujah This Promise is unto you
[2:08:12] and unto your children and unto your
[2:08:14] children's children and to as many as
[2:08:17] our Lord God shall call PA This Promise
[2:08:19] is yours and she activated the promise
[2:08:22] of Acts 2 in that little cabin and said
[2:08:25] I claim the life of my two boys Amen
[2:08:29] brother amamos I don't know how it works
[2:08:31] we say you can't take out you can't take
[2:08:33] out uh uh uh uh self-will but what about
[2:08:36] that right something in them was greater
[2:08:39] than their own self-will something in
[2:08:41] them was greater than their own desires
[2:08:43] or what they had focused on something in
[2:08:45] them was greater and that light struck
[2:08:47] the lens of that seed with inside them
[2:08:50] and it'll do the same thing for you and
[2:08:52] for your children and to as many as our
[2:08:55] Lord God shall call I think it's time we
[2:08:57] activate the promise hallelujah
[2:09:01] amen hallelujah amen to God from my
[2:09:05] mother's
