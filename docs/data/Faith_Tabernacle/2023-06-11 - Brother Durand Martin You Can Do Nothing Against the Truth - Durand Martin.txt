your voice it's all by our hands father we love you we thank you it's time together this morning he's certainly an honor and a privilege and a blessing come together with people of black precious face we're living in trying times the Lord You've ordained we be together to draw from one another strength that you've placed in your body we're asking that you would give me strength this morning it's uh Minister Thy Word we asked Lord that you would make Thy word to be a blessing to hear people in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth and I create a verse out of second Corinthians 13 and 8. just one verse and we'll turn to Second Peter 1 and 12. for we can do nothing against the truth but for the truth one more time we can do nothing against the truth but for the truth and in second Peter 1 and 12 wherefore I will not be negligent but you always remembers of these things though you know them and be established present truth brother Brandon preached the message and absolute 1963. in his head lives now we when I was looking this text up I went to the dictionary I thought what somebody keeps saying that's absolute the truth absolutely this is it about what is that word what does it mean absolute I went to the dictionary to find out what it meant Webster says it is perfect in itself Unlimited in his power primarily an ultimate see a limited in his power perfect in himself and it really is an Ultima the word absolute in the day that we're living in now and everything is so breaking up so fragile and carried away I think that this message will be a very appropriate appropriate thing especially to Christians when they're going through their deep Waters now the Christian church is passing through the deepest water it's had for the last two thousand years because we're coming to a spot to where there is something presented to Christianity something they have to make a decision on I think that the Christian Church ought to have something that they know they are tied to instead of just floating about like a leaf up on the water the wind the Bible said cared about the devil went to the doctor the winds come and roll the little length this way and then another win Comes The North Wind the South wind East Wind the West when you never get anywhere you're not stable the Christian Life should be a stable to act it should be something that's a principle that you're a time to that is more than life itself amen you've received it foreign time we need to know where we stand and I know the things that I'm going to talk about this morning you've heard before but as Peter said though you know these things and be established I want to put you up your minds and we're going to remember this again you know you'll be establishing the present truth and Truth the word of God is ever present so is the truth it's not something that just slips upon us it's not something that slipped upon God but God is truth I was talking with Sean and just kind of rehearsing some things that I've experienced in my life and um he looked at him and said dad said you really need to write these things down I need to get them recorded and I told him as well what if I would just give a short testimony Sunday morning concerning these things it's not nothing to be wonderful so I'm going to speak of you on a few things that happened to me that prepared me for this message the Lord is certainly certainly been gracious to me and the fact when I look at how far we've come and the way we've come it's nothing more than God's Sovereign race but my story action begins when I was 15. I was going with my dad and my brother to a place in Oklahoma Miami Oklahoma my dad had bought a piano and so we were coming back from Miami and passing through a town called Claremore and I was in the front seat looking out the window to the West and suddenly I was impressed that I live in Claremore one day and I kind of shook myself and I thought what was that you live in Clermont one day and so about four years later three years later my wife and I married at 18 years old I was 15 when that impression come upon me three years later we married at 18. a month after we'd been married I told her I said listen let's move to living in Tulsa Oklahoma and she said move and she said where to and I thought a little bit I said Claremore let's move to Claremore and we moved to Claremore I was unaware at the time that I had was fulfilling that impression three years earlier because I forgot all about it and so moving to Claremore um the rest of our folks her dad and mom and family and my brother and his wife they all Fallen just to Claremore one day when I was 19 my dad and father-in-law was Standing Outside they were talking and as they were talking one of them brought up the name of William Branham and uh I said who's William Branham and he said he's an advantage the mighty man of God properly used of the Lord and that's all that said it's all the reader news and so I didn't think anything more about it but about the same time I guess that's about 20. this we had a a church her father my her father my father-in-law pastored a small Church and it was an open assembly time Church where anybody that felt a legend saying a song or give a testimony or preach the message the pulpit was open and so one nine there was a man and his wife had come to church and she played the accordion they sang and so he wound up preaching and at the end of his message he looked out there at me and said Son he said God has showed me that you've been taught in the error and God's going to send you through the fire and going to purge you and bring you forth this pure gold and God is going to teach you and so of course that you can imagine how that went over and nothing was said during the service but after the service I got cornered and boy they climb to one side of me and down the other and some of the brothers and of course I didn't do any better and they said it was a false prophet and I I agree this yes sir and uh his own option to hand you know any better and so there was a young couple that that started attending church and and they about a year older than my wife and I and then one night they invited us over for supper so after the supper of the women were cleaning up the kitchen dining area and the man looked at me and said what do you know about the seven Church ages and I said nothing because once the seven Church ages and so he began to explain to me or little he knew and it was just a little now that I'm familiar with the church ages but nevertheless it was enough to get me curious and to make me hungry hungry and so anyway the Church folded up I wound up with my brother and his wife my wife going to church in Tulsa had brother Angelo's and so they had an open Pulpit to happen format and uh but while I was there I'm just so discontent so unhappy they were a good group of people had three people and they took me in and played guitar and just had a good time with him but I was dissatisfied and the Lord spoke to me fought in prayer he said go back Claremore I've got to work that you'll be a part of and so not knowing where to go I told my wife said we're going to go to church in Claremore and we looked around and found a little church called The Lighthouse of Ronaldo and we started Church there and of course they found out I played guitar and a little guitar playing and uh we played guitars sang and preached but they were not had a man a brother a black brother come and preach and he preached after the message he called my wife out and told her I said sister I see you working with young children teaching them well four years later had come to pass she taught kindergarten in first grade in a Christian School and so right after that he called me up and he said brother God has showed me that you've been taught in error and God's going to send you through the fire it's going to purge you and bring you forth as pure gold and God is going to teach you there's the second time that happened this time there was no one there to warn me or to chastise me and even if there were I wouldn't have received it because this is more the coincidence so we wound up leaving that church at church was an organization and they had brought a set of bylaws on a piece of paper eight and a half but seven and a half and asked me to read it and then sign it in order to have further participation in the services and so I read it things under I couldn't agree with and above all I couldn't agree that God would be confined to an eight and a half or eleven a half piece of paper he's bigger than that and so I left that church to know where it goes I drift again and my mother-in-law she said I know of a church I heard of a church across the tracks and let's go check that out so when we went over and I sat down the back row and looked up and there was a young man on the platform and immediately my heart was drawn to him and he got up and he walked back we introduced himself to each other his brother David Burris and he said you're a preacher I said yes sir he just wanted to preach tonight and so I preached to the guitar and I sang preached and I was there for almost 30 years but he had told me later on he said brother Durham he sighed we've been praying he was a young Christian about two years old Christian never Pastor never just preached one message really but it had a burden while living in Georgia it was converted to come back to Oklahoma and witnessed to his friends as House Church started and so he said but I I've been praying and I I thought I told the Lord I said Lord if you would send me a man that would stand with me and stand beside me he said I think I can do this he said you're that man and I feel the widows also but later about six months later he told me that I'm at my pastor from Atlanta Georgia from Stone Mountain Georgia to come and hold a Revival and so I happened to be there when brother Abernathy pulled up in front of the name of his home and the Lord spoke to me he said I've given this man something to tell you receive it and so that night in that service first thing he said I was mouth he said William Branham there was never a greater man walking shoe leather than William Branham and there's that name again and so after service that night I was so sure that God has spoke to him to me that I went to where he was saying and I said brother Abernathy I said that God has God shown you anything to tell me and says yes he has that's what is it he's not telling you for the survive is over but I don't feel to tell you now and so he snives on pins and he was with us be the night with this be the night five nights later the last night of the meeting he called me up he said brother Dern he said God showed me that you've been taught an error and gospel singing through the fire God's going to teach you or bring you forth the pure gold and God's going to teach you same thing three different times that time I can't explain it but my mind went blank everything that I had hung on to everything I had believed everything I thought to be the truth was gone my mind was a total blank I could I couldn't tell you scriptures to quote I couldn't do anything and it is bewildering and so it was a journey for me the beginning of a journey in which God taught me the very first thing that he taught me was is that God is his own interpreter that he doesn't need man to interpret for him God is his own interpreter and we had been taught that one of the things that I've been taught was that Israel God had for cast the Israel off giving her a bill of divorce I would never deal with her as a nation again and so I had believed that right along I was taught that but in 1974 when the Yom Kippur War broke out and he caught my attention it was got my attention and I began to thank him about that about the war that won and I thought that can't be but the Lord spoke to me said I asked your advice harassed your counsel have asked you how to do things not to do things and if you stop it at my tracks and I just talked to the Lord I said no I said you have it he's not my own counselor he said I root of the kingdom of man turned the hearts of the Kings has Rivers and so they begin to change my way of thinking so I began to realize that all I had to do was set back and watch God's word unfold so Brother David called me one even if I'm going to Prior Oklahoma to visit his brother Everett Thornton would you not with me and so I went with him after Services over Brother David brother Thornton were visiting and I glanced around and looked there's two books on the table and as brother Torres one of those books there and he said there's the book two books the seven Church ages and the seals and he said the Revelation given to God's Prophet William Brad him and that's he would like to have him I said yes so I took the books and he also gave us four real real tapes it's important we had possessed folks Mercedes real real tapes he was four of them I took one of them uh emergency divorce and I took that got my little pentaton the quarter out and strung her up listen to it shook my ass is my style stuff turn it off put the tape up a couple days later I was thinking you know that man sure sounded sincere and humble I thought now let's do it some more it took me two weeks to get that message but at the end of two weeks I said hey man's every word choosing law for Grace and listen to that and that message so moved me we had a little lateral broadcast at the time and so I preached on that message if he was knew me saw me on the street that message it sounds really powerful and that's William Bradham oh and so I've listed all four tapes and that was all we had for for many years just in four tapes but that is the way part of the testimony that I come in to this message it would be 10 years later that I got the book a man sent from God by Gordon Lindsay when I read that book I just cried and I cried to cry I thought I've never seen anything like this and uh in earlier teenage years I had listen to the man the name of Kenneth Hagin and Kenneth Hagin was really quite a teacher on faith and uh I used to attend his service every time I was in Tulsa and so I heard brother Bradham has got a red red medicine from God and the rest listen to some other things and I realized here's where everybody's getting their messages why should I listen to them I get it straight from the author and so that's what changed my life in my heart now we come into this message and as I said it's just nothing but sorry God Sovereign Grace that led us to what he letters and it caused the Great separation between my brother and his wife my wife we had been very close we had my brother and I married sisters we had a double wedding we took our hormones together we went to church together he wouldn't answer the woman without the other but I come into this message begin to see things differently although I I was in full pleasure of the message yet but I I knew there was more than what we've been taught and it caused a rift between us a big ribs and there's something we couldn't help I couldn't help and I tried to explain to him where I was going they didn't understand that and they stated where they're at but I want to pick up this message now I mean I want to quote brother Branham in the absolute again that was a little bit of a laugh story My Testimony there's a lot more but I want to give you this message but that that's enough time if we understand three different times men prophesied over me a word for word none of them know each other here's God speaking directly to me at this from an evening so brother rather than again the absolute definition he said it's perfect it is perfect in itself are named it in his power primarily in Ultimate it's Unlimited in his power perfect in itself and it really is an absolute penultimate now in Psalms 119 and 89 and 90. the psalmist wrote saying forever O Lord Thy word is settled in heaven and thy faith faithfulness is unto all generations God has established the Earth and anybody forever O Lord Is Thy word settled in heaven and I can remember a time uh you know by Nature I'm kind of Miller caller caller and then have it used to be up and down up and down up and down and that spilled over my spiritual life one man God loved me the next minute God didn't love me one way I was called to preach next minute wasn't called to preach and just everywhere and one day God spoke to me said forever because my word settled in heaven said the problem is not my word the problem is with you you've got to get it settled in your heart it's not my word but the fault is you and so I I thought about that I thought you know that's right and so I begin to wean myself from feelings and based my walks strictly upon God's word for Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word so I I took that as my absolute My ultimate and from then on my life just plained out I settled down I was nothing down up and down all around I'm just set it out but I was thinking that if God's word is forever settled in heaven then he's got to get that word here on Earth among the people because it's not going to do no good for me it's heaven in heaven if he can't get it down here so Psalms or Isaiah 55 verses 7 to 11. so let the wicked forsake his way in the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and he will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts or not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the Lord because the heavens are higher than the Earth is higher than your ways and my thoughts and your thoughts for as the rain coming down and the snow from heaven and returneth not through there but water of the Earth and make it bring forth and Bud that it may give seed to the sore and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it should not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and you shall prosper in the thing we're too I sent it now I'm going to take this the remainder of this message and explain why that I believe God sent a prophet by the name of William Branham I would ask you to go on record did I believe this message is one thousand percent there's no cutting Corners with it there's no evidence and buts I believe this message to be divinely inspired of the Lord and I'm going to explain why now God had thoughts and he had ways we just read in the scripture they were far above us they were in the heavens so God had to have a way to convey his thoughts and make known as ways here on the Earth now you can't see God I've explained this before but God is a spirit they worship he must worship Him in spirit and in truth but you can't see God so God in order to communicate with man in order to make his ways known as the man and his thoughts in order to man he ordained men called Prophets they called also called Sears the reason we're called Sears is because the spirit of God would Elevate them up above Humanity would anoint them and show them things that no one knew I think they were to come and sort of created a hardship because men brother one time said that the hardest thing that God ever had to do was to get one mortal to believe another and I think this is so among preachers because preachers are are really quite jealous I'm going to be honest they're jealous on their territory they don't want anybody infringing on their Glory we're called you're called that's good but I'm called too and so they they lack the respect they lack the reverence they lack all of these things and this is what separated brother Branham brother Branham was not seeking his own Glory brother Bradham was the humble man brother Madam depended solely upon the leadership of the Holy Ghost he was sat there having this gift of healing and discernment but he was standing there and say you're probably wondering why I'm standing here he's I'm waiting on him brother Brandon would not venture force that authority to preach the message presuming he would not mention four without Authority but he would wait upon the Lord then he would say he's here every time I hear him saying that you've seen his shoes done my spine because you know that it's not a man no more it's God can you say Amen working through a man and he would sit there and say brother or sister so and so and so and so and so and so he would look out at the crowds and say sin brother so and so call him a name read him off like a book man couldn't do that and so these Prophets were the same way brother Branham said in God keeps his word he said God always always from Genesis to revelation God has always had at least one man that he can put his hand on he's never been without a witness now God had to have a mouth please so he chose man he ordained them to be prophets to be seers and Amos 3 verses 7 and 8 the scripture says surely the Lord God will do nothing but he reveated his secret unto his servants the prophets God would do nothing except he revealed his Secrets first reveal the secrets unto his servants and Prophets the lion at the roared who will not fear the Lord God the Lord God hath spoken who can but prophesied now in second Peter 1 verses 20 and 21 Peter said knowing this first that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for prophecy came knocked in Old Time by the will of man but holy men of God spank as they were moved by the Holy Ghost now you've got to put first things first before you can have confidence and submit yourself to God's word you first got to acknowledge his author in acknowledging then you must also agree that he and he alone is Sovereign in his interpretation brother Brandon preached the message the testimony of a true Witness he said this what struck those Prophets what inspired them that perfect accuracy not only that but the prophets told what he would do the prophecyman saw him born where he'd be born how he'd be born not an ordinary baby just a baby born to some woman is said he would be born in a mysterious way he would be born of a virgin a virgin shall conceive what would strike a mortal man to make him see that hundreds of years before it happened perfectly accurate exactly on the line talk about testimony of a supreme Supreme Being a living God not only that but told where to be born how he would be born told what the world would say about him told the various signs and things that would follow him to prove he was a messiah proved that he'd be rejected and even in the spirit grown his words from the cross hundreds of years before he before he was born now brother random said prophets were born a messenger for the age who God by foreknowledge knows the age and has his agent there to call out sin one of my favorite scriptures and I know I'm I'm reading some things that I've read here before but I've just got to read it again but in Jeremiah Verses 4 through 10 then and I want y'all to really notice these scriptures then the word of the Lord came unto me now can you imagine standing there before a group of people and saying the word of the Lord came unto me that's going to raise Flags automatically in people's minds who are you that's going to be the response who are you what do you mean the word of the Lord came unto you gets worse and before that came his forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee I ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations then said I oh Lord God behold I cannot speak for I Am a Child but the Lord said unto me say not I am a child for Thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee and whatsoever I command thee Thou shalt speak be not afraid of their faces for I am with thee to to deliver thee saith the Lord then the Lord put forth his hand and touched my mouth and the Lord said unto me behold I have put my words in thy mouth I have set thee over the Nations over the kingdoms to root out to pull down to destroy to throw down to build and to plant no wonder the prophets were slain that's why they treated the prophets they stoned them they saw them asunder because they stood with boldness and said the word of the Lord came to me now when God sent them Prophets they had the word of the Lord God always sent a prophet when things were starting to deteriorate the spirituality of the nation they were getting into idolatry such as Ahab American Jezebel and Marion the spiritual with the natural of political marriage doing all of this and started going to idolatry God raised up a Prophet by the name of Elijah we know the story and so God always had a prophet on hand to pronounce God's blessings upon Israel he also had a prophet on hand the same prophet Amen to rebuke Israel so that Prophet was important Israel but again that could not receive the prophets so here's what Amy said in the name is eight eight eleven through twelve behold the days come saith the Lord God that I will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor thirst for water but of hearing the words of the Lord and they shall Wander from sea to Sea and from the north even to the east they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it how come because they had killed off the prophets and that's the way the word of the Lord come the Lord God knew nothing except he personally been a Secrets unto servants the prophets so the secrets were God's thoughts and his ways above us being brought down to man and God and people rejected the prophet the voice of the Lord that God ordained and anoint rejected him and so as a result of that there was a famine for the hearing of the word the reason why there was orange to speak it was gone they killed them all Malachi was the last prophet and so you're going to wonder from CDC you're going to go from the north to the West the East you're going to want to look everywhere and not be able to find the word of the Lord you're in trouble so 400 years passed from Malachi unto John the Baptist there was no word so man was left up to his own devices his own thoughts his own way and what a mess that man made out of it interpreting the word applying his own interpretation to it may have done that totally messed up the scripture said in Isaiah 59 14. and judgment is turned away backwards and Justice standeth the far off for truth is fallen in the street and Equity cannot enter now starting the scripture was you can do nothing against the truth but only for the truth and so here truth is fallen in the streets what's happened man casted away from him kill the prophets shut off the mouthpiece and so there's no more truth and lay dormant is falling in the streets the problems have been slain to whom the word of the Lord came true came true truth is now fallen in the streets it would be 400 years before a prophet would come on the scene they sought for the word of the Lord but could not find it for The Messengers to whom the word of the Lord came they silent beneath the sod but they could do nothing against the truth only for it for what drives again in his season Isaiah 40 verses 3 and 5. the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make straight in the desert a highway for our God every Valley should be exalted Every Mountain and huge shall be made low and the Crooked should be made straight and the rough place is plain and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed listen to this and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and All Flesh you'll see it now they may see it but not all flesh is going to accept it All Flesh you see it together for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it is identifying himself as the mouth of the Lord has spoken it Malachi 3 and 1. behold I will send my messenger he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord whom he seeks should suddenly come to this Temple even the messenger of the Covenant whom he Delight in behold he shall come saith the Lord Malachi Verses 4 verse chapter verse chapter 4 verse 5-6 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he should turn the heart of the fathers to the children and there are the children of the fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse now the great and Dreadful day we all know that there's two days mentioned there the great day was before the first coming of Christ as the great day the Dreadful day before the Great Tribulation Luke 1 and 17 said he should go before him in his spirit and power of Elias to turn the hearts of the father to the children so you can't do nothing against the truth only for the truth so here's John the Baptist now in the distance he should turn the going before him in the spirit and power power of Elias to turn the hearts of the father to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready people prepared for the Lord Mark 1 verses 1-4 the beginning of the Gospel Jesus Christ the son of God as it is written in the as it is written in the prophets behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee divorce the one crying in the wilderness prepare you the way of the Lord make his path straight now I want to look at this preparation because after all it had been 400 years since the prophet as I said earlier that they had got everything all twisted up it's all messed up to throw an interpretation their own thoughts you know when I think about that this is why in The Book of Revelation he said If any man take anything or add anything to this book any word so John the Baptist was the word originally came to the prophet whom God ordained to be his mouthpiece therefore would take a prophet to give the proper interpretation thereby place and placing it as present day truth can you say Amen John the Baptist was that Prophet sent to prepare the way of the messenger of the Covenants it was a son of man it was a son of man revealing the son of man just like we're seeing in our day right here fulfilling Luke 17 and 30. when the in the day when the son of man is revealed it was a son of man brother Bradham revealing these son of man Christ the word you remember that's what John was revealing the word was made flesh so it was John the Baptist a son of man revealing these son of man while John the Baptist done and she took all them loose sins all them prophecies and brought him right on down amen resurrected him out of the street say here's the truth here's the proper interpretation repent bring forth made me approved meat for repentance can you say man repent see and so John said there's one among you whom ye know not now I love this in John 1 22-27 then said they unto him who aren't thou that we may give an answer to them that sent us what says Thou of thyself he said I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight to where the Lord has said the prophet Isaiah and they which were sent were the Pharisees and they asked him and said unto him why baptizes thou then if thou be not that Christ nor Elias nor that Prophet John answered them saying I baptized with water but their standeth one among you who mean or not here it is he it is Who coming after me is preferred before me whose shoe latches I am not worthy to lose these things were done in myths bethabara behind Jordan where John was baptizing the next day John would see if Jesus coming unto him and saith Behold the Lamb of God was taken away the sin of the world this is he whom I said after me cometh a man which is referred before me for he was before me and I knew him not and I noticed what John said here I'm just like the rest of you I knew him not but there's one thing that was revealed unto me that when I see this the spirit of the Lord descending on him in the form of a dove that would be the one now no one else had that revelation God never told anyone else describes the Pharisees everybody standing there questioning John he never told him anything but it was revealed unto John divorce one crying in the wilderness a prophet can you say Amen that was the only way that they could identify who Christ was he says Christ is in your midst and you know I'm not I don't either but it's been revealed unto me I knew him not but that he should be made manifest to Israel therefore him I come baptize them with water and John bear records saying I saw the Spirit descended from heaven like a dove and did Abode upon him and I knew him not but that he sent me to baptize the water the same said unto me upon whom thou shall see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he was baptized with the Holy Ghost and I saw and bear record that this is the son of God amen amen now not what I'm saying that dove on a Job saying the spirit of the Lord descendants the others had no choice but to believe what John said but did they believe it they did not believe it why because truth you can do nothing against the truth only for the truth Isaiah prophesizing you got ears but you can't hear them eyes but you can't see can you say Amen you can do nothing against the truth if they said that wasn't the Christ which they they come against Christ that didn't make no difference he was still Christ if they rejected John the Baptist then there and make a difference he was still divorce the one crying in the wilderness so I had the reason I'm saying these things is you and I testifying that we believe in William Bradham to be the messenger for this age with all the world denying it the church coming against it does it make any difference no you can do nothing against the truth only for the truth [Applause] seen I don't know 100 years ago when I was a kid just a new convert I I would witness everybody just witnessed witness witness love to witness love to talk to people about the Lord I got into his hornet's nest I mean I come across men that were intellectuals that were smart they were brilliant they were intelligent they'd take this Bible and turn their voy but Loose me with it leave me rattled Northern thing I had to come back to is what I had personally experienced I may not be a scholar I may not understand every word but I understood this one thing whereas once I was lost and I'm found once I was blind but now I see if God is dead who's just living in my heart can you say I knew that and I stayed with that then do whatever they want to do it's like I heard one time you know I was pretty good on guitar kind of trying to keep up with me and he said he said you know somebody asked me one time said how come you don't run all over that neck like Chet Atkins he's because I already found what he's looking for and that's what agnostics you go ahead and run on to go through the south Florida the bushes the bars and everything I'm standing right here farming in this cast or what I know to be the truth I bear record that this is the Son of God in John 3 29 and I I really want you to catch this John said he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom would stand up and heareth him rejoiceth greatly because of the Bride groom's voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled now I'm gonna bring in this scripture real quick in Psalms 19 verses 5 and 6. which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoices as a strong man to run a race have taught the scripture before what a wonderful scripture so here's the bridegroom fulfilling this prophecy the feeling of Truth come out of his chamber and as a strong man to run a race so John says here's the bridegroom he that hath the bride is the bridegroom so this is he now the truth manifested in Luke 19 41 and 20 and 40 41 and 42. Luke 19 41 and 42. oh I'm not dragging this out too much and when it was come near he beheld the city and he wept over saying if thou Hast known even thou at least in this thy day the things which belong unto thy peace but now they hid from thine eyes in Luke in Isaiah 40 and verse 5 and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and All Flesh will see it together for the mouth of the Lord unspoken we read that earlier so John and John Saint John 4 1 and 14. and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and we beheld his glory the glories of the only god of the father full of grace and truth so truth that lame foreign years in the streets was now standing before him John wrote and said we've been held as his glory full of grace and truth amen John 14 and 6. Jesus said unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto me unto the father but by me I am the way the truth and the life now in John 18th chapter verses 37-38 Jesus had already just if I come to the end of his ministry he told one point he said look if you can't believe me for the works for the words that I speak then believe me for the very work's sake for there they was due testify of me so I told him I am the way the truth and the life now he's standing before a pilot pilate said unto him or thy King then Jesus answered thou says that I am a king to this sin to this end was I born and for this cause came out into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth I didn't bear witness to the works that he done everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice pilate said unto him what is truth and he's sitting there standing there looking right at it what is truth and when he said this he went out again under the Jews and said unto them I find no fault in him at all what is truth so amazing that Pilate was fulfilling truth right then he took a lamb just like the Jews were doing at the same time the Jews were taking a lamb keeping it up putting it up try it check it out make sure there's no spot there's no blemish on it Christ has been examined they've been beaten have been scorched truth is being fulfilled the priests high priest says there's no fault that I am that's a good lamb taken for the slaughter Ed anything Justice had Christ examined crisis standing for a pilate pilot says I find no fault he's without blemish that spot amen perfect lamb I find no fault I said the other day songs talking and I said at that moment s a little more spiritual than the priest because they think say I find no fault the Jews said crucify him but they were all fulfilling truth couldn't do nothing against truth on fulfill it in the voice of the sign brother random said we noticed now that Jesus when he came on the scene he was the prophesied word he had a Ministry to fulfill do you believe that he asked sure he had a Ministry notice to be fulfilled what was written of him old fools slow of heart to believe the word of God don't you know that Christ has suffer these things didn't all the prophets speak that he should do this and then enter into his glory he has to fulfill everything that he come he come to heal that it might be fulfilled he did this that it might be fulfilled everything he done was to be fulfilling because he had to be the voice of that scripture but before he done it he went forth to The Healing Ministry he in the sick everybody wanted to see the sign sure they believed the healing but the voice changed it one day when he said I and the father are one that was too much for them you make yourself God being a man when the sign they believed it but when they heard a voice behind it a Ministry that followed that sign they didn't get it that's when trouble set in he told the disciples and told the crowd said the multitude said accepted my flesh drink my blood you have no life in you and from that moment they turned away from him no longer followed him he turned to the twelve said will you leave me off soon but they heard the voice to whom shall return for thou Hast the words of eternal life can you say Amen I promise I'll hurry but in Saint John 10 24-30 then came the Jews around about him and said unto him how long does thou make us to doubt if thou me to Christ tell us plainly Christ had already fulfilled his ministry had told them The Works bear with us who I am tell us plainly don't make this doubt well if you knew the word if you knew the scripture if you'd heard if you had done what John said to do repent and catch his message then you'd understand who I am that's the truth but they didn't do that so there's two wondering how long does thou make us doubt he fulfills every scripture how long does thou make us doubt tell us plainly it's just as plain as the nose in your face just as plain as that word that you read every Sabbath I told you you believe not The Works that I do in my father's name they bear witness of me but you believe not because you're not of my sheep as I said unto you my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life they shall never perish he said any man plug them out of my hand My Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand now I'm gonna preach through this but in Saint John 14 15. John Torres Christ told him the disciples he said I'm not going to leave you comfortless I will send unto you the comforter even the spirit of Truth he dwelt with you and shall be in you now I won't say this that the disciples when we're talking about a voice and we're talking about a prophet and God ordaining a man for specific office for setting up a specific part most people can't receive that because they think we're exalting a man they think the man is being exalted himself it's the hardest brother Bradham said it's the hardest thing to get one mortal to believe in others but the disciples were not given the Mysteries they were promised unto you it is given to know the Mysteries but it was the Mysteries were not given unto them they all bear with me II Peter 1 16-18 they bore Witness what they had seen what they'd heard until protect them but as yet did not understand the Mysteries for example second Peter 1 16-18 for we have not followed cunningly divised Fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but where I Witnesses of his majesty for he received from God the Father honor and Glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent Glory this is my beloved Son whom I'm well pleased and this voice which came from the heaven from heaven we heard when we were with him in the Holy Mountain first John 1 verses 1-3 that which was from the beginning which we have heard we have seen with our eyes we have looked Upon Our Hands have handled the word of life for the life was manifested we have seen it and bear witness and shown you that eternal life which is with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that you may also have fellowship with us and truly our fellowships with the father and with his son Jesus Christ now I was not until the Paul and the Apostle Paul's conversion that these Mysteries were made known the other just sent me testified what they had seen witnessed handled the word of life these things but it was the misses were not revealed unto them Jesus simply said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven so in Acts 26 13-16 amid day O King I saw in the way alive from heaven about the brightness of the sun shining round about me and then was journeyed with me and when we were all Fallen to the earth I heard a voice speaking unto me and sang in Hebrew tongue saw Saul why persecuted thou mean it is hard for thee to kick against the Pricks and I said who art thou Lord he said I am Jesus who now persecuted us but rise and stand upon thy feet for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou has seen and if those things in the witch are will appear unto thee and the voice of the son brother said this he couldn't understand how the pillar of fire was this was the one that had led his people out of Egypt that was the one who remember the Hebrews all through the age and here he is he's seen him he said Lord what is it that you wanted with me he said I am Jesus he's saying that this one that had led his people that he knowed all the time that Moses meant the I am ever present same yesterday today and forever was manifested in the flesh it was his revelation he had it above any of the rest of them so what did that seven do they get jealous did they quit inviting Paul to their camp meetings did they put him aside what do they do they feel him a threat did they compete with him come on what did he do brother Brown continues what did Paul do his Revelation was prophecy for today it was the voice coming forth wrote in the Bible to be Vindicated today again Hallelujah says it's the voice being Vindicated again what he wrote because he was God's prophet revealing the sign was speaking of something remember he chose 12 he said he chose them from before the foundation of the world he said I have chose 12 and one of them is the devil Paul had to take that place to be the chosen one now there was no hesitation on the part of the disciple was in jealousy there was no competition there was nothing they embraced Paul in Galatians 1 21-24 afterwards I came to the regions of Syria and Celestia and it was Unknown by faith under the churches of Judea which were in Christ but they had heard only that he was persecuted Us in times past now preaches the faith which he once destroyed and they glorified God in Me just talked my heart I swear you through Paul being a prophet one place Peter wrote and he said you know Paul spoke things that were hard to be understood how come because he was caught up to the third heaven he's seen things that were not often to be uttered he was the abundance of Revelation that was given to him God gave him a thorn in the flesh a measure of Satan Buffet to him that's how great that Revelation was I mean he as a prophet he was able to discern the spirit of antichrist already it worked he's seen all these things and warned the Church of it says as a prophet he was the first church age messenger in that right and he fought and he fought against the Beast of Ephesus he fought against the spirit of the Antichrist he warned but told him he told the church you no longer Children of the Night your children of the day that these things should not creep upon you a real prophet now we find that truth Jesus had said I will never leave you nor forsake you he told them said men are gonna Cast Your Way for their presence they're going to treat you all the men of things unto you but I will never leave nor forsake you I'm going to come unto you I'm going to dwell in you I'm going to send you the spirit of Truth so you know brother Brandon in the Smyrna Church age he said that when they went through horrendous things that they went through he said you with them because God is the god of love daddy would take all the suffering away from me would not allow them to go through the Temptations they went through but he said God's love is not a Panzer so to speak a panda love but it's love that it's able to keep you and to carry you through all the dark hours so just like he was with it Hebrew children in the fire furnace the king looked up and now we cast in three how did I see four Christ they're all alone and so Christ in his church he told them I will never leave you nor forsake you he come to them as the word of God made flesh he was truth revealed in every age now the masses tried to destroy truth but they wrote a fulfilling truth because you knew nothing against the truth only for the truth and so when we had read the scripture earlier about he that had to Bryden is the bridegroom Paul said it in second Corinthians 11. I would that you would bear with me my father didn't need to bear with me they were attacked and criticizing the messenger he told us that may be rude in speech he was a stutterer but I'm not rude knowledge he told me he said our fearless by any means his serpent but God lean he's also corrupt your Minds from Simplicity as in Christ so The Voice that Christ was was not as Church Paul knew the responsibility committed unto him because the bride had been placed in his hands so understand that so we find through each successive Church age that that bride is like Eliezer carried the bride Rebecca all the way to Isaac she had there was marauding bands there's all kinds of dangers all kinds of things the L Israel was responsible for her to get her from point A to point B we find it all the way through the next thing you read it's in the evening time when Isaac comes out the tent and she joined with Isaac isn't that right and so the spirit of God said I'll never leave you nor forsake you scared this by through each successive Church age and it looked like the truth was buried Lion's tree once again the masses reject the truth and cast it away but the bride because she's kept by the spirit fulfilling Truth for in the word this the spirit of God is always carried right on through to where we're at today and so we find what I'm going to use a couple of scriptures and find them turn over to Psalms say I think Psalms 19. I'm sorry let's turn to Joel turn the jaw the second chapter and the 16th verse in Psalms 19 I think we did that earlier who talks about the bride's room coming forth out of his chamber has a strong man to run the race remember that we read that scripture the soul man's running right side I love these scriptures because Paul said look the whole book of Hebrews if he you understand it was Paul's defense of the Gospel because there have been men that come in trying to subvert to hear and bring them back under Judaism unsacrifices of Moses and this is why the Paul started that first chapter of Hebrews and he said God who spoke to us nine just hundred times diverse manners hath not spoke to us this last day bye to his son Jesus Christ the last day he's spoken of his last days of Israel so what he done she explained in that first chapter about Christ's been there of all things he goes to the second third and fourth chapter warning them she looks at your forefathers back under Moses they say my Works probably for 40 years but didn't blame me sorry he's trying to get the horse smacked focused and it starts in the fifth chapter and begins to teach who Christ was so it comes all the way down to the 12th chapter and he said after going through the 11th chapter the chapter of Faith he rose the faith how they all died looking I'd ever seen the promise or received the promise but haven't seen it afar off embraced it they all died for that so it starts with 12 1 of Hebrews and it says sing therefore we're capacity Baptist the word cloud of witnesses let his left side every way to the sin the unbelief was thus so easily beset us let us run this race with patience looking under Jesus Christ the author and the picture of our faith so in Joel here we read this or you know Psalms 19 we read about so many run the race so Christ run that race right along the church all we went through you know when they run a marathon the Baton start off at the same baton but the appetite takes on greater meaning The Closer You Reach get to the end them Runners are timed perfectly they don't get out of Step how many of them they struggle with a strong leg for the strong beginning and then whatever the second runner sees them coming he already starts build a speed up to that Runner that holds the head up behind never leaves in his eyes off that track straight ahead and that Runner coming up it's being built up ladies right in that Palm yeah not stretched he takes that button he runs and come up the next Runner and run season coming he starts to build up a speed yeah and he gets up to the same pace the hand stretched back the same baton Jesus Christ same yesterday today and forever the seven Church ages but that baton took on new meaning because now we're at the end so I'm just strong man I would never leave you nor forsake you a strong man come forth as a strong man to run the race with Adam with his bride so enjoy two and 16 gather the people together sanctify the congregation assemble the elders gather the children and those who suck the breast let the bridegroom go forth out of his chamber and their bride out of her closet so the Mysteries Jesus said when you prayed don't pray open us like hypocrisy enter your closet and the father sent me a secret sure wore the opening so the bride come in that closet the bride room was with her and then her she deserves to the mystery for her age the message for her age you come down through each successive Church age but the scripture said about how we all know scripture in Malachi 4 verses 5 and 6. that Elijah the prophet would come in their right for the great and dredgey of the Lord and so we find in Luke 17 30. and other scriptures that are being fulfilled truth being fulfilled in this day but people have not been able to recognize the vindication they rejoice in the first and second pool my brother got his ministry but in the third pool that was a secret there was no sign to that it was a voice just a voice Sciences had a voice but we find that at last for his third pool had no sign it was a mystery president said whatever that tent said said God never tell right this will not be impersonated this is the bride's Revival so we find it together people together the bride the inner closet and God kept her through these Mysteries oh Atlanta Church age but now we read over name is the line of the Lord who can never prophesy you got to understand the verb above verses he talked about the lion would not Roar except he was taken meat the young lives did not answer can say the young wolves they would not answer the the lines were substitute of praise and they hunkered down and saw the Dead would make our noise anyone who found out that was sealed away but when that line roared everything quieted down everything pulled back then the young webs recognized that voice and they answered back because they knew now that it was a spiritual meeting new season so people fall into the practice Ministry I mean they together they're about hundreds of thousands but when he begins the third pool they forsook him but the Bride come out of the closest can you say Amen why because it was so Vindicated cloud in the heavens accostation angels Christ or the head of we brought him Harrisons such a vindication that we knew we knew according to the scripture that was being fulfilled this is our day they had tried to step out Truth All Through the Dark Ages to the days of the modern the Dark Ages they tried stuff out truth but all they did was fulfill truth they tried to criticize us and there have been men that have come against this message starting this message become against this message but they're doing nothing more than fulfilling truth their part called Scripps said it must need to be heresies among you if they which are approved to Christ they may manifest y'all hear me okay so here we are and I really have said it's concerned the absolute then this day right here the things that Paul prophesied are now unfortunately some of the things said we're living at a time I tell you I'm 72 years old I've never seen anything like this in my life but Paul said God has not given us a spirit of fear but a power and of love and sound a sound mind stabilized mind stabilized by an absolute truth the Lion's roared 10-3 who can have Revelation 10 and 3. who can never prophesy somebody pulled back in the line in the prophet stood up since thus said the Lord 1963 Sears are open and brother the bride flock to him because he recognized that voice I'm glad for that I'm sorry took so long I hope I'm here for your minds a little bit this morning to stay with it don't turn away from that you stay with the truth people cast truth in the street and trample over it they'll Mark the man of God to criticize the message they'll do everything like that they can they just help people for them really feel for him but based on my own personal experience what I went through how God led me told me three different times he's been taught in there that third time everything that I've been taught everything I believe left me and just totally left me it was a great board in my life but God filled that void he gave me spiritual meat and due season I can't deny him no more no one knew that and so I encourage you all just keep pressing the word we're at the threshold of going home Fred we just don't realize how close we are we sometimes wonder why to all these there are things that happen in our lives that serves as distractions to turn our hearts and our minds away from these really crucial but this is why Paul taught us in First Corinthians 13. concerning charity he said look here if I have all the knowledge so I understand all Mysteries and I have all faithful I have to move mountains I get my body to be burned I mean he bases he's lying out what's going to happen in seven Church ages and have not charity it probably nothing and so we go through so many things you don't go through it and physically I go through sometimes because my physical I go through sometimes mentally and it's just a battle but I can't let myself be distracted though God slay me yet will I serve him God allows me to stay on Earth his condition it's got to be for a reason because God knows all things these Sovereign judgments Sovereign in his actions but I want to encourage y'all just to
