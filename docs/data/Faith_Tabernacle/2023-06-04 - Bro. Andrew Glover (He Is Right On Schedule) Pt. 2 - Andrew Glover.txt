the Ark of Safety o God glory may you revive us this morning and we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray and all the believer says amen and amen and God bless you this morning if you have your Bibles while you're standing with us we'll statue of The Book of Matthew 11th chapter The Book of Matthew the 11th chapter we want to look there in the first verse and also we'll be looking at the book of Psalms the 27th chapter and we want to say it's a real honor and a privilege to be here this morning to speak to you amen and we sure sure enjoyed that wonderful song service this morning in worship and amen sure I appreciate our brother Daniel for getting himself out of the way and ushering in the presence of God Amen we sure appreciate these musicians and gifts that God's placed Among Us amen and all the all the specials and amen just good to see everyone in the house of God this morning and we sure sure love and appreciate each and every one of you here today and we want to look here in the Book of Matthew the 11th chapter and in the first verse Matthew 11 I want to continue maybe speaking a little bit on what we spoke to you last time about he's right on schedule and here in Matthew 11 and verse 1. Bible says it came to pass when Jesus had made an end of commanding his 12 disciples that he departed fence to teach and to preach in their cities now when John had heard in the prison The Works of Christ he sent two of his disciples and said unto him art thou he that should come or do he look for another and Jesus answered and said unto them go and show John again these things which you do hear and see the blind receive their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the death here the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me now John is in a very good place to be offended he's in prison but Jesus speaks what brother Brahm called The Forgotten be attitude and said but blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me now let's turn back to the Book of Psalms the 27th chapter in Psalms 27 I want to look in two verses there I know you'll be very familiar with these scriptures being that brother Branham uses this for his text in the rapture in Psalms 27 and verse number five David here writing he says for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up on a rock now we know that Iraq is a revelation so he shall set me upon a revelation upon a rock and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me and therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing yea I will sing praises unto the Lord amen I believe that's what we've been doing this morning amen is offering sacrifices of Joy unto him as the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word is you can have your seats here this morning I want to by the help of the Lord for just a few moments I want to if I can to speak to you here and if I tell this sermon this morning again I want to speak to you on he is right on schedule but I want to pull a little thought out of that of he's here uh he is here he's right on schedule amen he's here now we found that a schedule is in a range or plan an event to take place at a particular time so if you got a schedule then you're working for a particular time you're trying to achieve something at a particular time and we found that God is our God who is Jehovah and that he is an on time God he is an end time God every time amen he's on time in time every time I how many witnesses have we got here this morning he's on time he's in time every time there's not one time that God is late he's on time in time every time and we found the product of God said there in the junction God is always on time sometimes we're a little bit later thinking a little different but that's always done for a purpose see but God is always on time with his message and so today I believe that we're facing a great something that the church should know and understand and we ought to know all this is about we find it in God's word he said for I believe that if it isn't in the word then I'm just a little bit doubtful of it if it isn't in the word I'm just a little bit doubtful of it now why would a prophet be doubtful of it if it isn't in the word because the word is God's schedule God's schedule is his word his word is his schedule so if it's not in his schedule then I'm a little bit doubtful of it but if God's word speaks of it then no matter how indifferent it might seem to our custom of teaching it's God working out his word it's God working out his schedule many times it's contrary to our way of thinking or maybe the way we've been taught to think amen but we have to recognize the omnipotence of God when it is performed before us amen it does not matter what you've been taught it does not matter the way you think things ought to be or the custom that you think they ought to be done in if it's contrary to God's word then we are as children of the word under obligation Amen to deny our thoughts and to believe the report of the Lord and to recognize the omnipotence of God when it is performed before us again in the meanest man I know I'm so glad that there is one on time and that's God and his message it's always on time amen do you realize you're living in a day and time where you're listening to tapes amen that we're preached 50 and 60 years ago but you hear him today and it is as if they're being preached right here right now in the season you're living do you know why amen because our God is a god who's always on time in time every time amen when he spoke about Asylum law amen there was no such thing then but go today unto your Courthouse books and the sodomites are now protected by Allah see because this is not a message of happenstance it's not a message of chance it is a message of precision it is a message of Direction it is a message of God being on time end time every time now Matthew 11. amen we found there that John amen had found himself in the prison and the reason he was in the prison amen was because of his ministry So what had happened was he went from the Wilderness amen eating his meat with the locusts and the Honey to the jail and the problem of God said his eagle or prophetic eye had got filmed over and the reason it got filmed over amen was because of his habitation change so when he was in the wilderness there was no film over his eye when he was running the woods and enjoying the things of nature there was no film in that prophetic eye but the minute he was put in prison amen the prophetic eye become filmed over and when John got his prophetic eye filmed over he got offended and he sent two disciples to ask Jesus two questions are you he that should come or do we look for another and what he was doing he was doing that out of a spirit of offense right he was offended that God hadn't kept his word amen and when John said the worst thing he could say about Jesus amen that's where we closed last time Jesus turned around concept the greatest thing about John I I don't know about you here this morning but that just Thrills my heart amen that when John said the worst thing brother Bob that he could ever say about Jesus Jesus turned around and set the greatest thing about John it struck me of the day that Jesus did not wait till he got report back amen that John had apologized that John had thought well I'm wrong I'm sorry amen but because he is a sovereign God Amen who loves you regardless of the things you're going through he did not wait for John to apologize he did not wait for John to send two disciples back and say I still believe amen but he turned around and displayed a Divine attribute and I believe that there's a bride on the Earth today who has been offended she's been hurt she's been ridiculed she's been criticized everything she's done everything she's tried to do amen there's always a critical devil Amen to criticize her but she has not let her offenses amen film her eyes over to the point she's quit believing the timely message amen that God is centered I want to put that devil on notice you can offend us you can criticize this you can ridicule us you can persecute us but you'll never stop us amen amen you can say things about us you can tell lies on us amen but shall never back us off with the promises of God Amen because we're not here amen moving by the feelings and The Sensation and the way things are going but we're moving by let's saith the Lord and thus saith the Lord is there's a messiah amen there's an invincible Army there's a bride on the earth who is moving by the grace of God listen I'm not offended this morning amen I want to say thank you Lord I want to say thank you for working things out when I did not see a way out you made a way amen when I didn't see the way amen you was away when I couldn't lift my hands you was a lifter up in my hands when my head was sunk down between my legs and I couldn't even look at the promises you were the lifter of my hand but you love me when I'm bad you love me when things are going good you love me when things are going bad amen because he's God well I feel like I preaching this morning he's God and he's not controlled by the way you're feeling I'm on Church there's been times since you've come in here and didn't feel like God loved you and it was the greatest blessing you ever got there was times you come in here and felt like the spirit of God was a million miles away from you and you felt the greatest anointing amen you'd ever felt you know why amen because you're not being accepted amen based upon what you've done you're not being accepted based on how many books you've read how many prayers you prayed how many songs you sung how many sermons you preached you're being accepted upon the provision of the shed blood of Jesus Christ and if the blood work by sin amen the blood works this morning amen and if your life is under the blood you got a right to raise your hands if your life is under the blood you got a right to say Amen if your life is under the blood when the Holy Ghost comes in the building and you begin to feel the refreshing from the presence of God you got a right to stand and say devil get out of my way you'll try to stop me try to block me but here I am amen because the blood has covered my life oh yeah amen when you've said the worst things when you felt the worst when it's been the worst days sometimes that's when you get the greatest blessings here I don't know about you but that makes me want to shout amen that when John said the worst thing about Jesus Jesus turned around and said the greatest thing about John now in that message the forgotten the attitude brother remember says here in this row I want to pull our thought from this morning he said but when trouble set in can we say that together when trouble set in when trouble set in amen Jesus come and showed the Messiah that he was the Messiah amen but then something went wrong amen John had introduced the Messiah with the fan in his hand Amen to burn up the chath but he found out the works of Jesus that he was Meek and he was lowly amen so it worried him he didn't know what to say he thought now there's something wrong here somewhere now watch this John thoughts there was something wrong somewhere it seemed he had believed the wrong thing it seemed like it wasn't working right and there's many times that we think too that it isn't working right amen but it's working right there's many times that we think it isn't working right amen but it's working around listen I don't have nothing fancy to give you this morning I just got a little thought on my heart okay amen I want you to catch something amen I know amen you might not be seeing lights and you might not be seeing fire but listen to the words of a prophet when it doesn't seem like it's working right it is working right when and it doesn't seem like it's going the way it should go it is going the way amen because as long as we know that he's here amen then what difference does it make as long as we know he's here then what difference does it make as long as we know that he Jesus Christ the son of God is here then what difference does it mean well brother Andrew there's not a hundred well as long as we know he's here then what difference does it make well brother Andrew there's some sicknesses in the but as long as we know he's here and what difference does she make well but then do so and so don't like so and so amen but as long as he is here amen then what difference does it make well brother and you don't know about my finances amen as long as he is here what difference does it make what you don't know what the doctor told me last week amen but as long as he is here amen what difference does it make amen because if he is here then there's a possibility for a change amen if he is here there's a possibility for the situation a man that is plaguing your spirit to change come on church I've been in meetings and seen people sitting there depressed and discouraged amen but just start preaching on the never failing presence of Jesus Christ and watch a liberty drop upon their lives amen because I couldn't change it brother Sean can change it amen but the changer the Waymaker The Miracle Worker amen the life Giver they've been coming to the building and somebody recognized that he's here and as long as he's here then what difference does it make it's working right well Glory somebody out of shout he's here as long as he's here it's working right maybe it ain't working according the way we think it ought to work but it's working according to the way God wants it to work there's a big difference brother Terry in the way we want it to work and the way God wants it to work if it's not working according to the way we want it to work we'll get discouraged if it's not working according to the way we want it to work we'll get depressed amen but if he's here rather Shalom what difference does it make amen if he's here it's working out all right now you all know as well as I know that when trouble sets in is when people seem to forget amen as long as John was in the wilderness no trouble everything was okay this but the very minute amen that John got put in jail and trouble set in he forgot the identification of the Messiah he forgot all those good times he forgot all those blessings and anointings amen and the proud of God said oh just let the church start to rest a little bit and then trouble sets in amen listen if you're waiting for trouble to go away it's not going to happen if you're waiting for disappointments and the little in little situations to go away it's not going to happen amen the very now listen amen if you won't rest you're going to have trouble because the minute you come to arrest is the very minute trouble sets in because that old low down scoundrel devil is not going to let nothing work the way it should he's not going to let peace and enjoy he's going to do everything he can to stop it amen but has he forgot who we are as he forgot amen that we're not sissies as he forgot they were not cowards amen were warriors here and though we may be few in number though we may be weak in spirit amen there is a strength of the ability of God that has come upon the church we will not back there and we will fight for our church we will fight for our ministry we will fight for our families we will fight for our babies come on church we will fight for the liberty of the Holy Ghost to come in the church and to bless the people of God we will fight for the Liberty to come into service shake the shingles offered the glory of God rang out in the building we will not back up and turn around but cause a little bit of trouble comes in we have not been trained under a coward we have been trained under General Jesus and we don't know the word Retreat and we don't know the word quit and we don't know the word go back we only know one word and One Direction and that's forward and onward among Onward Christian we gotta March through some trouble we gotta March through some bad days but as long as he is here he'll give us the strength to do it as long as he is here he'll give us the grace to persevere amen amen when Jesus comes amen when Jesus comes amen The Tempest power is broken when Jesus comes amen the darkness is turned into light when Jesus comes amen the sadness is turned into Joy when Jesus comes amen the defeat is turned into Victory amen why because Jesus has come my amen when trouble set in John started questioning or thou he should come or do we look for another now the proud of God said something very powerful in the Seal of the Antichrist he said 1955 he said the day we're living in is the question mark over the entire world the day we're living in there is a question mark over the entire world now come on there's a question mark right now amen over the future of the politics there's a question mark over the economy there's a question mark over education there's a question mark over the budget there's a question mark over the debts here I mean amen amen it ain't gonna I don't have time to tell you how many question marks are over the things of the world there's question marks over everything do you realize right now there's even question marks over religion right now there's a big old question mark amen hanging over religion now can I preach amen you know why that is amen because trouble sets in they identity when 's her way they forget who they're serving and the father God said see what it is is it's actually Satan has a gospel did you all know that Satan has a gospel he said and Satan's gospel is the gospel of science Amen in progress he said he preached it in Eden not God Satan did amen the science of progress he said now he preached in the who to Adam's bride and she fell for it see he deceived her into questioning one of God's words she should have never stopped Amen to question the word of God but when trouble set in amen it moved her back from her identity and she began to question well maybe God maybe it is okay if we partake of that fruit amen maybe it is okay but you see what happened when trouble set in amen she forgot who is there with her when trouble set in she forgot her headship when trouble set in she forgot that as long as she stayed underneath the word she was fortified amen from the power of the enemy but the men in trouble set in and she began to question this and question that hey question this amen now watch what happened here through the entire human race into chaos because she questioned God's word you know what I want to tell you tonight or this morning don't you ever question amen the word of God and the place that God has taught you amen come on now I'm going to preach to you because as long as nothing is going wrong we're too blessed to be stressed we're too anointed to be disappointed we're too pleased to be out of place I mean we're shouting and dancing we're eating breakfast with the angels having lunch with Gabriel and drinking coffee with wormwood I mean everything is so Heavenly but the minute trouble comes in we'll start saying well maybe I'm out of the will of God and maybe I shouldn't be but let me tell you what that is that's a devil that's trying to move you from a place of assurance amen into a place of question because if he can get your foot off of the rock of the Revelation and get it on some slippery Stone of some situation amen you will lose your identity as a warrior amen but I come here this morning to declare war on hate and say we will not lose her identity sure you want to and When the Smoke Clears and the best sandals we will still be the Victorious bride of Jesus Christ troubles not going to change it disappointment's just not going to change it we know who we are therefore we refuse to give in to the devil's questioning on who we are amen you know what Satan does he tries to move people he tries to move people from belief to disbelief and the way he does it is by questioning we find out here that the devil tries to make the people disbelieved he said he was trying to get John to disbelieve he was the Messiah amen now when John was in jail you know the prophet said amen Jesus never sent him literature on how to be happy in jail you know what he said just stay until this afternoon's meeting stay till it's over then you can leave after that amen and just watch this afternoon's meeting he said and all of a sudden they begin to see and Jesus said go tell the disciples or go tell John rather that the lame walk the blind see the death here and all that comes to the meeting is poor the Poor People's got the gospel preach them and tell John not to be scared he's in trouble but go tell him not to be scared amen and not to think anything different are you hearing me amen and I'm right on schedule you go tell John I don't care how moldy the bread is I don't care how dark so damn I don't care how dark but damn wet prison is don't think nothing else amen I'm right on schedule everything's running right everything's all right amen go tell him there's a healing service going on Amen go tell him the power of God is moving among them amen and tell him I'm right on schedule and don't pay attention to anything else so what was Jesus saying I'm here and tell him to focus on my presence amen don't pay attention to anything don't pay attention to the cards don't pay attention to the moldy prayer come on I'm preaching to you amen don't pay attention to what the other prisoners are saying you just remember I'm right on schedule you just remember amen and get out of that jail time amen the lame Walk The Barn see the death here and the gospel is preached to the poor amen now what I want to say to you this morning is amen is there's different types of prisons and then but this prison that John was in amen it was a prison of offense amen and you see he was offended amen because things did not turn out amen the way he thought or we get offended when it don't turn out the way we think it all to go amen but remember this our thoughts are not God's thoughts Isaiah said my thoughts amen are not your faults and neither are your ways my ways saith the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts are higher than your thoughts remember said John Paul well now I introduced him as a messiah amen and here he is meek and lowly amen but I wanna I wanna say thank God for a prophet amen who could tell us why that John was offended he said John was looking for something that it wasn't time for yet amen it did not mean it wasn't going to happen it just meant it wasn't the time or the season for it yet but remember said in modern Adventure made clear about prophecy he said see John said all his fans in his hand he'll thoroughly Purge his floor he said now he fought the Millennium would start right then he thought the grain was ready but it had to die and go into the stalk amen and come up again to make the true ride so then there is a connection Brother Sam amen between John and prison and offended amen and the Bride of Jesus Christ amen John was looking for something amen that you was going to be a part of the Fulfillment of he was looking amen for the full grain for the full week for the full time but in the end time was when that was prophesied to take place amen so what happened John got dismayed just like we get dismayed he said here the other day I see so many people they come in and say well brother Branham I was prayed for I really didn't get any different well there's something wrong no there's not can I preach to you this morning there's nothing wrong with the system there's nothing wrong with God there's nothing wrong with the Bible there's nothing wrong with the Holy the thing of it is something is wrong with you oh well now we're getting down to preaching material are we amen there's nothing wrong with the Bible nothing wrong with the spirit nothing wrong with God's word the thing that's wrong is there's something wrong with us but it's a whole lot easier to blame the Bible it's a whole lot easier to blame the spirit it's a whole lot easier to blame the pastor it's a whole lot easier sister chain Amen to blame our friends and to blame amen but when the rubber hits the road amen what's wrong is something with hush now John we know amen the product God said he was more brother said he was more offended at Jesus and Jesus has been more off into death than any person ever lived on earth he said now watch don't be offended no matter what takes place everything's working right on schedule so you just go ahead and believe it so Jesus's instructions to John was you just go ahead and believe everything's all right now amen as I'm moving into this time of trouble you know that the Bible says in Daniel 12 amen that there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time in the sixth seagull brother man picks it up and says now compare exactly amen what Jesus said in Matthew 24 with Daniel 12 and see there shall be a time of trouble that's never been since there was a nation see look at the six seal the same thing it's a time of trouble how many can agree that we're living in a time of trouble and in the time of trouble is when questions begin to arise amen in Psalms 27 verse 5 David said for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock look at this word trouble it means bad evil disagreeable malignant unpleasant evil given pain unhappiness and misery in general it is of persons of thought amen so in the time of painful misery amen displeasant thoughts amen he shall hide me in the secret of his Pavilion in the secret of this Tabernacle David says in Psalms 37 39 amen but the salvation of the righteousness is of the Lord amen he is their strength in the time of trouble amen I want to say this to your friends the time of trouble does not separate you from the presence of God Amen trouble does not separate you amen from the strength of God Amen disappointments and bad days and evil days and evil faults amen does not separate you from the strength of God to bring you through the evil days Amen in the church age book he said it is in the midst of a time of great trouble that Jesus comes don't you love that Sister Kim it's in the midst of a time of great trouble that Jesus comes in the message expectation he said the peoples of all religion seems to have something within them that calls for someone who has created them to help him in a time of trouble now that's a mouthful it seems that people have something within them that calls for someone who has created them to help them in a time of trouble when a baby gets in trouble who is he looking for he's looking for Mama come on church amen and when this church gets in trouble we're not looking for the Baptist to help us we're not looking for the Pentecostal to help we're looking for our creator who is God to come on the scene and to help us in the time of trouble now I want to say this to you you may not like this but let me preach it to you the time of trouble is a special time the time of trouble is a special time it's a preacher how can you put trouble time and special time together what David said in Psalms 46 verse 1 God is our refuge and our strength he is a very present help in trouble amen he is a very present help in trouble he said therefore will not we fear will the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof Roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof amen can I can I drop something to you the time of trouble is the time of his presence the time of trouble is the time of his presence amen without the trouble you would not know he's a very present help in the time of trouble amen but because there's trouble it means there's the presence of God well glory to God Amen can I prove it to you the part of God said the other day he said brother brother Richard Blair sitting here he said he work and helping a man wire a trailer or something he said they reverse something and however it run the current and they're working on this trailer and it runs the current into the water where a little boy was he said the man that the trailer belonged to his little boy and just a little lad and it killed the boy so they're working on the trailer crossed the wires the boy in the water feels the current and it kills him he said now watch that's what happens he said the electrical shock he said his little eyes set out and his teeth went together it alarmed them so bad he said but Brother Bear remembered wherever two or three are gathered in my name there I am in their midst amen the father skinned his fingers trying to get his fingers in the little boy's mouth to break it open they knelt down and started praying over little boy and he come back to life again amen make meltdown started praying for him and he come back to life again he said was that true brother Blair oh yeah he said now what happened he said we are living in the divine presence of the great glorious Heavenly Father it was a time of trouble brother Terry amen I was there that were ever two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in their midst and when they remember that they prayed for the boy and the dead boy come back to life and the brother said yes when anything happens remember you are children of the Living God when anything happens you remember you are the children of the Living God and wherever two or three are gathered in my name there I am and again it is written he is a very present help in time of trouble and if there ever was a trouble was that little boy laying their dad on the ground from a shark that went through him so we're thanking God this morning with all of our hearts amen for all these things he's done for us now listen at this in a time of emergency that's the time to look to God in the time of an emergency that's the time to look to God Amen it ain't when everything's going good amen the real time to look to God the real strength and test of being able to look to God is in the time of trouble in the time of an emergency he said Look to Him and be on friendship with him before the emergency arrives so when the time of trouble comes and the emergency comes you don't go try to make friends with God Amen but your friends with God before the trouble you're friends with God before them come on church when that man's boy was laying there in the water dead they weren't trying to get saved they weren't trying to find out if there was a god they was already on speaking terms with him so when they was in trouble they remembered the God who was their God who was their friend was a very present help in the time of trouble and they laid their hand on the dead boy and he come back to life well I want to announce to you this morning that's the same God that was with Richard Blair is the same God with every believer here this morning I don't care what the situation is I don't care what the trouble is if you can just remember that you're the children of the Living God and he's a very present help in the time of trouble it'll cause you to look to God it'll cause you to look above the situation I'm on Church you all know I'm not crazy are you hearing me amen you gotta look to God sometimes sometimes you got to remember amen that hell come on sometimes you got to remember that the doctors can't fix it and the banker can't fix it I'm gonna and the specialist can't fix it and the lawyer can't fix it amen but there's a God and he's a fixer well will you sing a song Amen Jesus will fix it and I got a witness here this morning that he'll come out in 24 hours although he don't have closing hours he's a 24-hour God he shows up in the church and he shows up in your home he shows up on your job and he shows up in the school he shows up in the hospital and he shows up in the doctor's room you know why because he's God and he's very present help if he's here then everything's okay if he's not here we ought to be worried if he's not here we ought to be looking for an alternative plan to overcome but because he's here we ought to lift up our hands because he's here we ought to sing a sacrifice of Joy because he's here we ought to get our hearts off of the Ala trees and start praising The God Who Never Fails Us in the midst of trouble we know this if we have faith with God we can ask him anything like you with any other friend he is a very present help in the time of trouble you ain't got nobody to ask you got Jesus well I ain't got nobody to call you got Jesus well I ain't got nobody to talk to you got Jesus come on church this message was the reintroducing of the rock that was with Israel it's back with the church come up the rock remember said that rock was Christ he said the rock didn't get away from them they got away from the rock I'm getting in the Sherman right now hey rub them like this he said but you got to be on sin distance with the rock you've got to be in hearing this into the Rock and you've got to be within speaking this into the Rock if you can see the rock you can use to the rock you can hear it if you can hear the rock you can hear it speak back to you come on church we are not on speaking terms with the government we are not on speaking terms with some special idea about this message but we are on speaking terms with a rock Christ Jesus and he is an ever-present help in the time of trouble can I show you how really he is they was in a desert and needed water and The Rock had the water a rock in a desert had water in it but because it was not just a rock it was a timely Supernatural rock it was a present help in the time of their thirst so what they needed they spoke and got it from The Rock but I don't know about you but this message is your rock and whatever you need you can speak to this message and you can draw from it if you need Joy speak to the Rock if you need happiness speak to the Rock if you need an answer speak to the Rock if you need strength speak come on church it's time to start talking to the Rock again and we forgot there's a God who sits high and looks low and he can still speak back to his children when they call on his name yeah he's a prison help in the time of trouble you say preacher you don't know what you're talking about I do know what I'm talking about hey man I'm not preaching the empty sermon I'm preaching from my heart it's had to preach through trouble but I'm a witness for rock will help you I've had to preach to let downs and disappointments and people lying to you and saying all kinds of things about you amen but I never got my eyes on them I kept my eyes on the Rock who was a very present help in the time of trouble and he never failed me he never left me he never forsook me he never forgot me so for him I will give him praise for him I will bless his name brother Bill when he comes Among Us I'm gonna recognize him as The Rock because it's his presence with us in the time of trouble yes sir you say preacher it's a time of trouble it is but it's also a time of full restoration it's a time of trouble but it's also a time of the full restoration can somebody say fourth fourth it's not two it's not three it's four we've come through justification we've come through sanctification we've come to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we have now come to the fourth light we've now come to the fourth stage the Holy Ghost itself remember said remember Christ is risen from the dead and is Among Us the very present help in the time of trouble has risen from the dead and is Among Us get that in your mind see Christ has raised from the dead and seen all kinds of great moves shouting praising God and that's all fine he said we spoke in tongues prophesied we've seen all that that's fine comes right along with it but remember the last thing is his divine presence the word itself he is the word and the head the word it's coming to the body I'm on Church why is the head coming to the body because the body is going to find itself in the time of trouble but the only thing that can get it out is the headship of the word which is God himself the word in Hebrews 4 is a Sharps more powerful than a two-edged sword it is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart he said now run that through the scriptures and you will see he's known as the Messiah it's not some man here is the Messiah it's the holy spirit it's the Messiah amen Christ and the Holy Spirit is the same thing so here it is now just working in the flesh getting the body ready for Rapture and Grace amen believe it friends amen amen the very presence of God the divine presence has returned to the church amen in a season of rapture now as I said to you brother REM takes his text from psalms 27 and calls it the background for the Rapture and what this background mean brother Sean it means a setting in which an event takes place what is a schedule a schedule is a plan or a calendar to arrange an event to take place at a specific time hell glory to God I feel like preaching right now amen amen God's schedule had it right on time when a prophet stood and preached the Rapture in Yuma Arizona and you know what he said he called The Rapture the greatest event among church amen the schedule is about an event amen ascending is about an event and what is that event it's the second coming of the lord it's the change of your body brother during we are not looking behind us we're looking in front of us amen the best is not behind us church amen the best is in front of us he said I truly believe we're now near the great event the greatest event that ever did happen or Ever Could Happen is just near it's being made manifest now that is his coming amen his coming is the greatest event and it's just near being made manifest now I love this and the gospel by the way he said Jesus in the light of Calvary just a few hours before he was crucified he spoke more of his second coming that he did in his crucifixion so it must be a great thing that lies just ahead in the prophet like unto Moses he said my purpose to fulfill amen is to is to unite the body of Jesus Christ together what was he uniting the body together for for the last thing which was the divine presence the word itself to come to the body he said that's what's in my heart is to see all of God's children in one Accord with one heart moving on then I believe when that takes place that the work will be about over amen the millennium setting him the Rapture will come we're certainly praying and watching and waiting for that time he said we're looking forward to the greatest events I'm going to say the greatest event the greatest event ever happened in all human history or every wheel is the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ the son of God Amen to take amen her him her to himself he said see even nature itself is calling for that day it's all waiting and grown him for that day of perfection when our lord Jesus shall come and perfect everything that's imperfected amen watch his friends when he comes amen The Tempest power is broken when he comes death has lost its power well I'm preaching to you this morning amen those that have died along the road down to the Third Watch first second third fourth fifth sixth Amen to the seventh watch died they were waiting for this come on Church they were away amen John was in prison because he was looking for this I'm preaching to you amen John was in prison cause he was looking for what was he looking for he was looking for the week to come to maturity he was looking for the Lord to take the fan in his hand and thoroughly Purge the floor he was believing the Millennium was coming he was believing that the Christ would set up on the throne but it was in the future but come on Church you're in line for it this morning amen you're not as far away from it as John was amen come on church between John and now there were seven Gentile dispensational ages amen but right here this morning your next step could be the Millennium right here this morning your next step could be a theophany right here this morning your next step could be a glorified body you know why amen because the head has come to the word and the word body has received the presence of God Alone church we might be in trouble but we're in position to change our bodies we might have situations and disappointments and trouble might be sitting in on every hand but lift up your head he is a very present hell in the time of trouble when Trouble Comes is when Jesus comes when trouble Falls is when Jesus ascends because he's a God who will take the word to himself foreign I feel like praising him this morning we may be in trouble but we're on our way out of here Sean that's shouting ground right there we may have all kinds of trouble but we're on our way out of here our next step our next step could be out of time into eternity what are you saying preacher I'm saying death cannot hinder them from enjoying it come on Church death cannot hinder them from enjoyment because the Trump of God shall sound and it will and the dead in Christ shall rise first oh what a glorious time we're living come on church I'm talking to you about God's schedule three things on the schedule a shout a voice and a trumpet do you realize this shout has already taken place if you're looking for the shout you're in the prison this morning saying is this it or do we look for another but if you recognize this is the shout then you can say this day this scripture is fulfilled if you can recognize it the voice of Resurrection is in the bride you can say this day this scripture is fulfilled and if you can recognize that just as the trumpet gathers Israel there will be a trumpet that will give this ride you can lift up your hands in the middle of trouble and say Church he's here he's here the shot is here the voice is here the headship is here the power is here the anointing is here the ability is here the strength is here I know troubles here but he is here so what difference does it make as long as he's here as long as he's here I say come on trouble but he's here already I say come on disappointments but you got here too late because before trouble got here he was already here before sickness got here he was already here and when there is no more sickness and there is no more trouble he will still be [Music] he's here he's here somebody shouted he's here [Applause] [Music] he's here I know troubles here but so is he he's here and I feel like dancing for a minute y'all give me some he's here hello you're looking for him but he's here you say preacher you're getting too carried away why should I not be excited he's here my ride is here your Uber's here your lift is here brother Daniel your Taxi's here brother Andrew I know but trouble's here I know but so is your way out of it here [Music] y'all know what that boot wraps are don't you amen you order you an Uber and you sit there and you watch it and you watch it for five and then you may get somewhere and they won't even come pick you up are you hearing me you know what and you watch that Uber you know what sometimes I'll call you and you know what they'll say where are you I don't see you where you at you know why because they've got an ability but they don't have an intelligence they don't have a supreme intelligence amen but they're super I'm on church he don't have to call you and say where are you I need to come get you he knows exactly where come on church he did not call Daniel in the Lion's Den and say your Uber's on the way but where are you he knew where Daniel was he was in the Lion's Den with his head up on a pillar but Daniel was watching amen and all of a sudden he received a word amen your Uber is here Shadrach Meshach and Abednego amen they weren't in the fiery furnace and Jesus have to call him amen the Fourth Man and say now tell me boys where you at amen what's going on I'm on church he knew exactly where they were he knew exactly what time to show up he knew exactly what hour to be there and that same God brother Kevin is higher God and he knows what we're going through let me preach a Mannix he knows what we're facing he knows the depression he knows the nervousness he knows the anxiety but he also knows if you'll just lift up your head you will see your ride and it'll ride you out of the trouble it'll ride you out of the sickness it'll ride you out of this situation I can say this morning I'm riding on it his presence is my ride I'm gonna ride on his presence I'm like it's the only thing that's going to get us through come on Church you know I'm telling you the truth the only thing going to get us through some of these situations is his presence they may say well Don't Preach his presence well what am I going to preach it's the hour to preach his presence it's the divine presence amen it's the coming of the lord it's the catching away it's the Rapture it's the church's future now I know the question that comes on your mind is but when when well he's coming but when you you said my ride's here so when do we leave Matthew 24 may ask Jesus upon the Mount of Olives the disciples said tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world drop down the 44th verse Matthew 24 therefore be I'm going to preach this devil she might as well back up therefore if you ever hear me say that I'm talking to the devil therefore be also ready for in such an hour as you think not the son of man cometh so I have just told you when he's coming now wait a second Orlando the hour you think not somebody asked you when she's coming somebody they said Well when the Lord come and I said I know they said really Nobody Does the city I do they say when I said I pay you this much I can tell you right down to the hour they started laughing in the coffee shop they said Tennessee they started laughing at me there's no a Baptist friend of mine he started laughing he said you know the hour I said yeah he said how do you know that I said the Bible told me he said no it didn't I said yeah I did go read it he said what do you mean I said go read Matthew 24 44 the hour you think not he said well that don't mean nothing I said yet this because the hour you think he's not coming is the very hour he'll appear I'm just a country boy so I got to preach a team country boy in terms I remember when I first started when I first started deer hunting he met my Uncle Andy God bless his heart we'd go hunting and he had this saying I mean it actually become comical he'd always say keep your eyes peeled because when you least expect him when they'll be there I remember we'll be going in the woods brother Sean walking up the mountain up the Ridge and he had turned around we getting ready to split and go to our different areas he'd turn around and say now keep your eyes peeled because when you don't think they're theirs when they'll appear you know well come on let's bring it over to the spiritual this morning amen you know why a lot of people's not looking for him it's because their eyes are filmed over they've let the troubles in the situations in the tree they let it film up and it's been 20 years since they peeled their eyes back and looked for his coming they look for the power of the of the second coming of Jesus Christ but the hour you think not when it's going to come so you better get your eyes open get your eyes off of trouble he's here Albert Andrew you you're an old just give me some Grace Matthew 24 48 if the evil servant shall say in his heart my Lord delayeth is coming and shall begin to Smite his fellow servants and to eat and drink with the drunken the Lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him so we know the hour is the hour you think not we know the day is the day you look not and an hour that he is not aware of hour you think not and how you're not aware of and a day you look not see the prophet said now the future he holds it how many agrees he holds the future he holds it how do I know when he's coming when is he coming Shalom 64. I don't know but he'll be here what are you saying I'm saying he's here but again I'm going somewhere amen what will he do when will he do this and this when will the curse go off the earth when will these blessed reflections of God's love of trees standing here and Shining out in the Flowers and Things when will they Immortal grow I don't know but they will when will all the reflection of men's hearts desire to live and hospitals and doctors and operations and crying and grief when will it all cease to a glorious reign with Jesus of a thousand years of Shalom when will it I don't know he said it would be there I don't know how he's going to do it but he's spoken word will be authenticated when the son of righteousness shall arise with healing in his wings and the healing part there will not be a physical healing as you think is saying somebody's got a sickness and it'll be taken away from them that's what he's doing now in type see but the whole creature amen will be changed and the Mortal will take on immortality are you ready for this and this old age will jump into youth well some of y'all ought to put your jumping shoes on Amen cause that old devil trying to tell you that you're getting too old and you're getting too useless and you're getting too feeble but you know what I say I say that Devil's a liar and I say there's some members here we got some elders and fake Tabernacle that's got their jumping shoes home this morning you know what they're going to jump even they're going to jump from old age to youth they're going to jump from gray hair back to black again I'm on track they say preacher why do you jump amen because I want to practice my jump every now and again I want to practice what it's going to feel like Simona when I jump from an old body that's decaying into a theophany somebody say well you shouldn't be jumping I say we ought to jump up every morning come you know what they say they say when you get out of bed jump out of bed you know what that's a really good saying amen when you get up you ought to just jump out of bed because you may jump up and think you're going to put your false teeth in but when you get there you don't need them because your real teeth has come back you may be thinking you're going to comb your gray hair but it's not fair it's turned back back again I'm talking about a jump I'm not talking about a feeling jump I'm not talking about an emotional jump I'm talking about a jump amen of the presence of Jesus Christ and it's going to release us amen from the reflection of death into the perfect image of life eternal and will be with him forevermore when will it happen I don't know but it's going to happen brother Bob I don't know but it's going to happen amen someday brother Bob me and you may be somewhere stand there talking and you tell me what's the doctor's saying and about a pain in your leg and all of a sudden buddy a cold sweet come across your body and you throw that King down and you jump from an old man into an 18 year old party and we change to mentions I'm not a crazy man it's the hour of the blending of Dimensions it's the hour of the season of change the Rapture is upon us the body changes upon us we got to get out of here friends I know troubles on us but his presence is wholeness too [Music] brother Matthew I feel like I feel like running right now I know troubles all around this but his presence is here too and if he's here it's all right oh yeah if he's here it's all right does God keep his word God always keeps his word I was listening to a tape this morning brother y'all forgive me sometimes you get downstairs you listen to tape I forgot to take my everybody out this morning but I tell you this Herbert didn't say this morning he said listen he said you're wondering how this ain't gonna happen he said how's that black hair going to come back he said How's him loved one's going to appear he said he will see to it you know when I said Amen brother Branham he will seek to that I don't have to figure it out I don't have to work it out I just have to put my faith and confidence in the presence of God now what are you saying I'm saying this amen that the ministry I know I've been all over the place forgive me that I pray something's coming to you amen I say this the ministry of John the Baptist and the ministry William ran them but we're both ministries of introducing and Forerunner which actually what happens is when you have those kind of powerful Ministries there's more room for offenses when you have such a powerful commission there's more room for misunderstandings like like if somebody gets up and they say God's called me to pray for the sick okay God bless you go on your way we'll be with you we pray for you God there's no but somebody get him to say now God has told me that there will be a sign in my hand and I'll take the person's hand and I'll be able to tell them the type of disease they have and then it'll come I'll know the secrets of their heart and then they'll be a greater Ministry than that now There Brother Sam has just come the room for all kinds of misunderstandings and what happens is is when misunderstandings take place it puts people in prisons now you all know it's in the message but everyone said like this he said there I was had that dream they come to me tell me about that dream he said and in the dream all these people was behind bars right he said Behind These Bars now we know the quote by heart brother Branson House of Hell give way to the name of Jesus we know it we quoted we preach it it's a powerful quote but if you actually look at what led up to that it actually makes it more powerful then people wasn't was behind bars and the pawn to God so they were asking him open the bars let us out of here he said now brother by Adam he said come help us deliver these people he said when I got to hold the bars he said they were too thick for me I couldn't break them he said and I asked him I said what's going on and the Lord spoke back and said brother Branham these people are in these jails because they misunderstood you oh so now they're in the jail because they misunderstood a prophet and that's when they said he speaks and says House of Hell give way to the name of Jesus so actually what misunderstandings can do is they can turn situations into houses of hell now if I can have some Liberty I'll preach it to you a misunderstanding will actually turn a situation into a house of hell and it'll put the people in prayer oh come on Amen it's it's now now we're humans and there's going to be misunderstandings but the difference is how do you handle the misunderstanding come on now come on Church there's going to be times that somebody's going to do something and you misunderstand them uh and as the battery's going dead is it still working and we got an amen tape back there Judah we're humans so there's going to be misunderstandings you're not perfect I'm not perfect I'm going to say things sometimes and you're going to miss and brother Sean's going to act a certain way and you're going to misunderstand sister Jane she make walk by you and she didn't mean it amen but maybe she just didn't see yourself and she walked on well sister Jane don't like me and maybe brother Kevin got up to play the guitar and while he was playing he looked right at you and then he looked over at brother Jr well brother Kevin and brother Jr got something against me come on now y'all know I'm preaching amen amen it's true misunderstandings and how do we handle them how come I've been in meetings before and I've seen people wear their offenses on their face I've seen people get up amen certain song Be Sung they didn't like it so they I was in a church one time they held a silent protest to the whole service I thought that don't make you look spiritual it makes you look dumb because I've been in meetings and I didn't like certain songs but you know what nobody else knew I did you didn't know I didn't like it till just now you know why because I didn't wear the offense well preach somebody think I believe I will amen amen I've been in situations and been offended and nobody knew I was offended you know why because I've learned how to get through it without letting it get in me come on Church well we might as well preach so they misunderstood a prophet and the only one that could help him was the one they misunderstood now there's the key the only one that could break the bars was they go to the one they misunderstood if I've offended you and you misunderstood me Brother Sam ain't gonna help you out of the prison if brother Doug is offending me amen going there brother Terry it's not going to help him out of the prison we gotta go to the source of the misunderstanding and let the power of the Holy Ghost amen breaks the bars before it turns into a house of hell but in case there is any houses of hell here I come here to speak the name of Jesus against him and say a house of Hell give way to the name of Jesus let every misunderstanding come subject to the name of Jesus Christ now when there's a little commission there's not much room for misunderstanding when there's a big commission there's a lot of room and a prophet received a big commission when he said as John the Baptist was sent to Forum the first coming of Christ you'll have a message that'll forerun the second coming across do you realize that was in 1933 Brother Sam a hundred what is this 100 years later how long somebody help me 1933 2003 no how many 93 years and people still confused over that voice is this okay brother Sean 93 years and they're still confused over the voice of the Ohio River you know why because some misunderstood it program said what happened he said when that light appeared he said some ran he said but those that stayed hurt I'm preaching he said when the light appeared some ran and those that ran never heard but those who stayed amen they heard the voice so there were two reports of what's happening there were those who stayed and there were those who ran and those who ran tried to act like they knew more than those who stayed but the ones who stayed didn't get it second-handed they got it firsthand and there is a bride in the last days who is not running from the presence of God she is running into the presence of God so if there's any question about something that happens in the presence quit Consulting a psychologist or an intellectual educated preacher to explain what took place in the presence of God you go to the presence itself hi is that okay I know we may be bottoming out here but we'll bottom out and get through it ain't the first time are you hearing me there's going to be misunderstandings there's going to be offenses there's going to be things happen but you got to remember your mission you've got to remember your commission program should my mission I believe to the Earth is to what is to forerun the coming word see the coming word which is Christ and Christ has the Millennium in him now I'm gonna I'm gonna tie this together real quick because we're on the verge of the second coming of Christ and people right now are allowing questions amen criticisms to take the preem and it's in their thinking now come on we're all guilty but it's not actually something the Bible didn't speak of the Bible said no in this verse there shall come somebody said there shall come there shall come in the last days scoffers which are walking after their own lust and what are they saying they're not saying an exclamation this is the promise of his coming they're saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation so they're actually saying amen where is the promise of his coming in other words you know what scoffers are whether Terry scoffers are mockers and the part of God said Spirits don't die he said Spirits only change bodies so it's the same Spirit but it's a different body amen and the spirit of the scoffers will come and here's what they'll say brother Matthew they'll say nothing is happening but can I say this just because you don't see something don't mean something's not happening now if you're building a house and you drive by that house brother Jr every day you look over one day they're pouring Footers one day they're raising walls one day they're putting a roof amen you can see stuff outside and you can say man alive they're making progress over there buddy I mean they're working away amen they're getting something done well I'm preaching myself right into something I'll get out of it amen I'm not a crazy man amen they're getting something done over there man I'll tell you what amen every day something happened amen but then all of a sudden they get all the brick mate laid they get everything and the work moves from the outside to the inside and so now brother Junior you drive by that same house every day and there's no more walls going up there's no more physical outward signs Amen to say man something's getting done but what's happened is the work has changed it has moved from the outside to the inside come on church it's so so it's not that something is not getting done it's just change where it's getting done before you can see it outside but now to see it you got to get out and come in okay if you want to see where the works happening you got to get out of your truck and you're gonna come inside and you've got to see that the work is not outside it's Luke 24. it's a little room where they're breaking bread and the shine of the resurrected Christ is back I want to say this to your friends I know sometimes right now it may not look like every service we're shouting and every service we're running but I want to put a declaration upon that statement that does not mean that something is not happening in the house of God come on I've seen people shouting dancing running speaking in tongues and carrying on and ain't got no work going on they've been there sometimes I was talking Josh Bennett till today hey Splendor he said sometimes he said somebody asked me the ongoing they said brother Josh He said how do you feel when you preach seven services and only eight service amen somebody comes in and the meeting blows up he said well I shout right with you they said you mean I should shout he said yeah he said it took those seven services to build up to that age service he said see we're all working together and it don't matter when it explodes and you know why we got a bunch of jealousy among preachers it's cause if every service everybody ain't swinging from Chandelier to Chandelier and they're not anointed amen but sometimes you got to take your Bible and you got to take some tapes and you gotta lay in the word and you've got to lay some thoughts together come on Faith Tabernacle do you think those meetings happen amen just because six preachers show up they happen because there's people working together under a burden there's a pastor with a vision they say Sir come on Amen we have we have we have what 11 months of services and one month of astronaut that's a tremendous meeting you say well preacher what are you getting at I'm saying it takes little things to get to the big things y'all May disagree if it's me but we'll talk about it later your win sinach contribute to those spring meetings well I got about four of you said amen amen amen your wins tonight attendance amen contributes to those Supreme men amen those prayer meetings we hold they contribute brother Sean those sermons that you preach and you labor in your mind amen they're contributing come on church this ain't about a big eye showing up it's about all of us working together behind the vision to see a change I know they're scoffers I know there's critics I know there's people saying well nothing's happening but I challenge that statement and I resent that statement in the name of Jesus Christ as a member of the Bride of Jesus Christ I say Satan you are a liar I will not judge what God is doing in the lives of the People by the outward appearance but I will judge it by the change that's taken place in their lives and I see some of y'all right now amen some of y'all a few weeks ago you couldn't raise your hands because you was going through something but you didn't give up you kept on coming and today you got your hands in there amen some of you preachers I'm looking at you and I know there's been times that you've slim this poop in and you didn't feel like preaching but you stood here anyhow and you preached anyhow you know why because you was here in a time of trouble but you remembered it was a time of this presence and his presence is greater than the scoffers his presence is greater than the critics his presence is greater than all the game shares I put my voice with the voice of Sean Martin and Faith Tabernacle and the Bride of Jesus Christ there is something happening it's called the bright Revival and little by little by little changes are taking place come on Church the walls didn't come down on the first day because they kept on marching and they didn't come down on the second day but they kept on marching what if brother Durham they had gone around the fifth day and said ain't nothing happening let's just go back home the walls would have never come down but on the seventh time on the seventh time around those walls sister Faith they let out a shout and the walls come down tell the scoffers then nothing's happening the walls are laying on the ground preacher I'm saying let the scoffer scarf we will work together we will pray together we will sing together we will worship together we will preach together we will believe together we will fight the devil together we will love each other together and one day brother Doug we'll take each other's hand and we'll change our bodies together Bill and Brother Sam there may not be much corn on the outside well there's a lot going on the inside say well there ain't nothing happening I refute that statement somebody told me one time I said ain't nothing happening in our message meetings I said oh really he said yeah they said ain't nothing happening they said ain't no screaming hollering rolling around the floor and I believe in those things I said oh really I said yeah that'd happen I saw this stuff to UPC Church why don't you go down there quit judging our meetings by your Pentecostal idea of how I'm eating all to go yeah different to me a lot of my politicians I'm a preacher quit judging our meetings by the way you're a Pentecostal definition come right you say well Wednesday night well it was just Wednesday night brother Sean preach Here We Go part 25 Lord is my shepherd no get rid of that sorry attitude [Applause] yeah I'm leaving town tomorrow attitude it shouldn't be well here we go let's go to church it's the Lord is my no it ought to be lord I can't wait to hear rather than do what nobody shouting since when did somebody have to shout for us to have a good service well but then there ain't nobody come on I say thank God for these men who will stand in this pulpit and lay the word out there because the word is doing something in you come on brother right now that word is connected in your soul and something's taken place you know what brother Sean it might look like another wins tonight amen but I say buddy if you preach 225 Parts on the Lord is my shepherd I'm going to ask you to preach 26. you know why because I've learned that the Lord is my shepherd I've learned that I shall not want I've learned that he leads me to green power come on Church you say preacher you're building up a man no I'm not I'm building up the presence of the word that's being preached I say thank God for a pastor that ain't out running around all week ain't out running around all day with this mind and everything and then come the puppet and say well I heard of tapes I'm just going to say a little something to you I say thank God for a man it'll study till his eyes cross to lay some word in here it'll put some strength on your bones to defeat the Devil when he shows up in the we say brother Sean thank you buddy thank you for preaching this message thank you for preaching the streets of the message now until power comes from the church and Dynamics comes in brother Sean we thank you amen for preaching when you didn't feel like preaching because it was those services that got us through because it's a body coming together under the headship of the word what are you saying Faith Tabernacle I'm saying we're going to make it let's stand on our feet and rejoice we're going to make it the word on the inside of the church is changing the outcome and we say thank you we say thank you men of God we say thank you musicians come on musicians we say Thank You song leaders thank you deacons thank you Elders there may not be a lot going on the outside but brother Darren there's a lot going on on the inside we're getting stronger buddy brother Sean we're getting stronger we're getting stronger I know it may look like things are getting bad but we're actually getting stronger I'll say this on record and you can have my phone number if you want to challenge me on it we're stronger today than we were five months ago we're stronger right now than we were two years ago we're stronger right now than we were when we first believed you know why because the strength of the presence of God has become the lifter they say there ain't much happening the prophet of God said there is something happening now now I know I got way out there but I just learned to follow the lord when he leads me there there's a strength in this word we need to change her attitudes it ain't just Wednesday night well it's Sunday afternoon let's go back to church no it ought to be praying right there you might need to teach us that up here you know we get to go to church I've been hearing military say that since I was a little boy's toes leave we get to go to church [Music] no that's a good time to go to church that means his presence is there [Music] gotta tell you what a prophet said boy y'all forgive me I didn't get nowhere this morning he said now tonight the holy spirit is in his church to fulfill what the New Testament said would come to pass in the last days and you see the people on the street around who criticize and say those things are not right just feel sorry for them there's got to be somebody on that side are you ready for this and remember there'll be more than you are than we are see in the last day scoffers will come the Bible said they would come in the last day and be religious people they'd be heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God and continent despisers those that are good they call you a Holy Roller anything you could just to make fun of you Holy Roller despisers of those that are good having a form of godliness they go to church to Sunday school but with deny the power thereof now that wasn't to be in that day he said that's to be in this day brother shalom I read that the other day I about I about ran all over the place he'll be more scoffers there will be believers there'll be more critics of this end time message than there will be followers there'll be more on that side against it there'll be more saying nothing's happening then there will be those saying it is happening Dr Jane it don't shake me one bit [Music] you know why because sister Alice's presence is on this side [Music] brother during his presence is on this side presence is with those that are saying this isn't this is the ride's Revival something is happening we're not judging things by the way things appear we're judging them by the standard of the word I come on Church as I talk about that building that house brother well Junior you're building that house and you got an excavator and a dozer in a dump truck all kinds of stuff outside crane looks like something getting done did you get everything done outside move inside you ain't running around that house with an excavator and you ain't running out with a dozer but you got a drill or coping saw [Music] and there's a lot

really even happening in the among the young people what's going on there there's a oh God I pray you would you would drive that spirit so far away from us this morning Lord that we can see your God that Lord you've changed Lord You've not changed in your nature you've changed in the form that you're working in right now Lord same nature different form and Lord the change is moved this Lord from the public because that third pull would not be revealed to the public it would not be a public show Lord you've moved this ride in that little room underneath the headship of the third pool Lord sometimes we come to church and man it's like we can't sit down we're on our feet Lord other times we come seems like we can't even hardly stand up because that word is just correctness and chipping this away and cutting that out fixing this and readjusting her attitude dealing with this in our life and it'll only go two or three services see my camera service is just correction correction then come to church and all of a sudden that word has changed forms and now to to deliver its message Lord we're not Pentecostal babies we're not denominationally controlled Christians father we're
