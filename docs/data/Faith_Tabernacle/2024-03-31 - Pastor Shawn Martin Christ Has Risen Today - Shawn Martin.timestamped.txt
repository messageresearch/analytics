[47:58] that y'all was invited amen so um uh
[48:03] Mark the 16th
[48:05] chapter and the
[48:08] uh first verse we will start there and
[48:13] says and when the Sabbath was
[48:16] passed Mary Magdalene and Mary the
[48:19] mother of James and
[48:22] salom had bought uh sweet spices that
[48:26] they might come and anoint him and very
[48:29] early in the morning the first day of
[48:30] the week they came unto the seure at the
[48:35] rising of the
[48:36] Sun and they said among themselves who
[48:40] shall roll us away the
[48:42] stone uh from the door of the scepter
[48:45] and when they looked they saw that the
[48:48] stone was roded away for it was a very
[48:51] uh it was very great and entering into
[48:55] the seure they saw a young man sitting
[48:57] on the right side clothed in a long
[49:00] white garment and they were
[49:03] arried and he saith unto them Be not
[49:06] afed
[49:08] Afraid ye seek Jesus of Nazareth which
[49:11] was crucified he is risen he is not here
[49:15] behold the place where they laid him but
[49:18] go your way tell his disciples and Peter
[49:21] that he goeth before you into
[49:24] Galilee and there shall you see him as
[49:28] he said unto you amen then if you'll
[49:33] turn with me uh the book of
[49:37] Psalms
[49:47] 102 Book of
[49:49] Psalms
[49:52] 102 and
[49:55] um
[49:59] we're going to read um the 16th verse
[50:03] and when the Lord shall build up
[50:05] Zion he shall appear in his glory amen
[50:11] let's just bow our heads in a word of
[50:14] prayer and just ask the Lord to be with
[50:16] us today
[50:18] Father truly we're so
[50:20] thankful for the meaning of this day and
[50:25] what this day is been set aside
[50:28] for and Lord we know that you're alive
[50:31] and that you're well and because of that
[50:34] we ask that you would just come Among Us
[50:37] Lord and anoint my lips father Lord let
[50:42] it be Words of Life help me just to get
[50:45] myself out of the way father and that
[50:48] you would take over and speak to your
[50:50] people I pray that you would anoint the
[50:52] ears and the hearts to hear and receive
[50:54] of you father Lord if there's any sins
[50:58] that are not under the blood we'd pray
[51:00] that you'd forgive us of them oh Father
[51:03] you're are uh our intercessor here and
[51:07] father we just rely upon you today we
[51:10] ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the
[51:13] church says amen amen and amen you can
[51:17] have your seats
[51:21] today today has of course been set aside
[51:24] to um
[51:27] celebrate the
[51:28] resurrection of our Lord
[51:31] Jesus and so of course it would behoove
[51:34] us to maybe speak about the
[51:39] resurrection and um there there is so
[51:43] much that could be said and that has
[51:45] been said and so I don't think that it'
[51:48] be anything new that we say but just to
[51:52] um uh refresh bring to remembrance
[51:57] uh what it really means to us and um of
[52:02] course Easter is uh more than just
[52:06] buying a new dress or wearing a new hat
[52:10] uh which is all right uh you know uh
[52:13] Easter is some is is it's about
[52:15] something that is
[52:16] new and you know God did something new
[52:20] that day and the prophet said that
[52:22] Easter is a
[52:24] Triumph Easter it it's say it's a
[52:27] victory that God Gave Over the Earth
[52:31] amen so when we look at Easter it's more
[52:34] than just a a church Gathering or a
[52:37] family gathering after service and
[52:39] hunting uh eggs uh but it's a it's
[52:43] victory and and uh it's it's Triumph uh
[52:47] for God raised his own son from the dead
[52:51] that whosoever would believe upon Him
[52:54] should have eternal life and so today
[52:57] when we think of it we wouldn't be here
[52:59] today if he had not risen ain't that
[53:02] right and uh just a a couple scriptures
[53:06] as we go but 1 Corinthians 15:15 says if
[53:10] Christ be not raised then your faith is
[53:14] in vain and you are yet in your sins so
[53:18] if there is no Resurrection then we're
[53:20] gathered here in vain and we we have no
[53:25] right to sing amazing raised we have no
[53:27] right to say that we're Justified if he
[53:30] had not raised everything hinged on the
[53:34] resurrection in the 20th verse but now
[53:37] is Christ risen from the dead and become
[53:39] the first fruits of them that slept uh
[53:42] for Since By Man Came Death by man came
[53:46] also the resurrection of the Dead for as
[53:50] in Adam all die even so in Christ shall
[53:54] all be made alive
[53:57] so we know that there for the believer
[53:59] there is a physical
[54:00] resurrection and uh uh for all those
[54:04] that are asleep in Christ and and there
[54:06] is also a spiritual Resurrection uh for
[54:10] the church all those that are in the
[54:12] body of Christ and and uh so which means
[54:16] that that death is under our feet death
[54:20] is in our in our control ain't that
[54:23] right amen and that is all because of
[54:27] the resurrection of Jesus Christ we know
[54:31] that the spiritual Resurrection takes
[54:33] place now and Ephesians 2 and 1 Paul
[54:36] would tell us that you and you ha he
[54:39] quickened who were dead who were dead
[54:43] Amen in trespasses and sins and so
[54:47] everyone of us that have the Holy Ghost
[54:50] that's that's God's proof amen that you
[54:53] have passed from Death un life ain't
[54:56] that right amen and I think this is why
[54:59] Satan fights so hard against the real
[55:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen because
[55:06] that is God's proof of
[55:09] Resurrection God's proof amen the old
[55:12] things have passed away and behold all
[55:15] things have become new ain't that right
[55:18] so so the prophet says you're not like
[55:20] you used to be you are changed where you
[55:24] used to doubt God's word now every word
[55:27] that God speaks you say Amen because
[55:31] something has happened to you ain't that
[55:34] right amen and he says that's just the
[55:37] form the first form of the Resurrection
[55:41] uh uh the spirit on the inside and so so
[55:44] we we certainly believe in Resurrection
[55:47] I I I don't believe that Jesus intended
[55:50] for us to build a memorial around the
[55:54] resurrection of of his own resurrection
[55:57] of 2,000 years ago I I think that that's
[56:01] you know uh there's a lot of Easter
[56:03] Plays and which is is just fine and
[56:06] there's a lot of uh uh talk about what
[56:09] happened 2,000 years ago which is is
[56:11] fine we're thankful for that that's the
[56:14] that's the foundation of Christianity is
[56:18] is the
[56:18] resurrection but but we find that that
[56:22] Hebrews 138 Paul would tell us that he's
[56:25] the same yesterday
[56:27] today and forever can you say Amen he's
[56:30] the same yesterday and that was the as
[56:32] we know the theme of brother bram's uh
[56:35] uh uh Ministry he's the same yesterday
[56:38] today and forever and we cannot prove
[56:41] that he is the same yesterday today and
[56:44] forever amen just by talking about what
[56:48] happened 2,000 years ago amen uh to
[56:52] Simply say that he is alive doesn't
[56:55] prove anything Amen to Simply say that
[56:58] he is the same today as he was back then
[57:01] doesn't prove a thing so God doesn't
[57:03] want us just talking about him and and
[57:07] uh in a history lesson or uh uh a
[57:11] theology or or whatever but see God has
[57:14] to prove amen what we are saying ain't
[57:18] that right amen God has to prove by what
[57:21] we are saying by manifesting himself
[57:24] today Amen to show that he is the same
[57:28] yesterday today and forever we can draw
[57:31] a picture of him and say he's the same
[57:33] see he's the same yesterday but that
[57:35] doesn't make him the same yesterday
[57:37] today and forever but when he the person
[57:40] comes the same God that was back then
[57:43] comes in today and does the same works
[57:46] that he done back then then you can know
[57:48] that he's the same yesterday today and
[57:50] forever ain't that right and so it's up
[57:53] to us to prove this it's up to us to to
[57:57] to to uh uh that God could could prove
[58:00] himself now if you will notice in our
[58:02] scripture reading uh there it says that
[58:06] they were at the place amen they they
[58:08] were at the place that they thought he
[58:11] would be at the rising of the sun they
[58:14] thought the last time they saw him he
[58:17] was in a tomb and and so they they went
[58:20] there thinking that's the place he's
[58:22] going to be at at the rising of the Sun
[58:26] amen and and and if you notice they went
[58:28] there not looking for a living Christ
[58:31] amen but they were simply going to pay
[58:34] their respects amen of what they knew of
[58:38] him to be amen of their memory of him
[58:42] what he was to them and and and and so
[58:45] and they done it honestly amen because
[58:48] they didn't know that he had risen amen
[58:51] so everything that they were doing was
[58:54] based upon what he was in the past but
[58:57] they didn't expect him Amen to be alive
[59:01] that that day can you say amen amen so
[59:03] they had come see so then he had become
[59:06] a thing of the past to them a historical
[59:10] figure amen but it was at that place a
[59:14] man that the angel told them he's not
[59:16] here but he is uh risen he is alive
[59:21] ain't that right and then the question
[59:23] was asked them why seek ye the living
[59:26] among the dead ain't that right amen you
[59:30] you you ain't going to find him at a
[59:32] tomb anymore amen because he is alive
[59:36] ain't that right so then we find that he
[59:39] appeared to them Jesus himself appeared
[59:42] to them outside the tomb amen not in the
[59:46] Tomb outside the tomb ain't that right
[59:49] amen outside the place amen and and that
[59:52] word appeared is is to manifest he
[59:55] manifested
[59:56] himself so he showed himself visible to
[1:00:02] the early risers at the rising of the
[1:00:05] sun ain't that right I thought uh uh as
[1:00:08] as you look uh he never showed himself
[1:00:11] anymore throughout that day amen uh all
[1:00:14] day long uh through the span he didn't
[1:00:17] show himself Amen to be alive until the
[1:00:20] evening time amen but I tell you when
[1:00:23] they left that tomb they knew that he
[1:00:26] was alive can you say amen amen they
[1:00:29] they weren't looking anymore for some
[1:00:31] Dead uh uh God some historical thing but
[1:00:36] they knew he was alive and and they were
[1:00:39] told now go tell go tell them go tell
[1:00:43] others that I'm alive and that I am
[1:00:45] risen ain't that right amen see so then
[1:00:49] then they realized that once they they
[1:00:51] knew that he was alive then they no
[1:00:54] longer hung around the tomb
[1:00:56] amen of of the Dead ain't that right
[1:00:59] amen that's right and the angel of the
[1:01:01] Lord never told them to hang around the
[1:01:03] the tomb amen but told them where to
[1:01:06] meet him amen where they would see him
[1:01:09] ain't that right amen you see the angel
[1:01:12] of the Lord today has never told us to
[1:01:14] hang around the tombs amen of something
[1:01:17] that is dead amen that's right you know
[1:01:21] uh uh the prophet said only the devil
[1:01:23] hangs around the tombs amen and he d
[1:01:25] drives people to the tombs a ain't that
[1:01:28] right amen and and one example is the
[1:01:31] man of gatera Amen that that when he
[1:01:34] become possessed of of what 2,000 demons
[1:01:38] and and things but but it his Dwelling
[1:01:41] Place become in the tombs ain't that
[1:01:44] right amen see and and that's where the
[1:01:47] devil made him hang out and and and so
[1:01:49] the prophet says see Satan likes to
[1:01:51] dwell in tombs and hangs around old dead
[1:01:55] places ain't that right and he says and
[1:01:58] that don't exclude churches either see
[1:02:01] he says when they get colder it's a
[1:02:04] devil's hangout yeah amen and that's why
[1:02:07] we must never let our church let never
[1:02:09] let our lives get cold never let our
[1:02:11] experience get cold amen because that's
[1:02:14] where the devil loves to hang out can
[1:02:15] you say amen that's right see amen so
[1:02:19] dead places are are where he likes to
[1:02:22] dwell amen so you take a person the
[1:02:25] Prophet said that does that's dead in
[1:02:28] sins and trespasses and don't believe in
[1:02:31] the power of the resurrection of the
[1:02:33] Lord that's where the devil likes to
[1:02:36] live amen but how many believes in the
[1:02:39] in the power of the Resurrection amen
[1:02:42] see amen you can be tempted and you can
[1:02:45] be you can have your mind battles and
[1:02:47] you can go through trials amen but a man
[1:02:50] that that that has been quickened a man
[1:02:54] that is no longer dead in trespasses and
[1:02:57] sins and and truly believes in the power
[1:03:01] of the resurrection of the Lord amen the
[1:03:03] devil cannot hang out there can you say
[1:03:06] Amen I'm so glad for that so brother BR
[1:03:09] says if you truly want to know amen some
[1:03:12] of these old cold formal churches that
[1:03:15] has the form of godliness and denies the
[1:03:19] power thereof are the real hangout for
[1:03:22] Devils can you say amen that's right see
[1:03:25] a place where they say oh that's all
[1:03:27] work up that's that's all mental that's
[1:03:30] psychology see he says oh my and some of
[1:03:33] those Devils don't make you cut yourself
[1:03:36] they ain't going to make you commit
[1:03:37] suicide they ain't going to make you
[1:03:39] drive you to drink and and smoke and and
[1:03:42] all these things he say some of them is
[1:03:44] just as shrewd and Polished as they can
[1:03:46] be they're Scholars see he said and
[1:03:50] don't think that they're not ain't that
[1:03:51] right see so so we we look at these
[1:03:55] things and and and and you could just
[1:03:57] imagine the people that that were in
[1:04:00] shock amen when they realized that the
[1:04:03] one that they thought was dead they had
[1:04:06] come to build a memorial around and and
[1:04:09] and cry over and talk about the past and
[1:04:12] and all these things and find out that
[1:04:14] he ain't dead after all amen I think
[1:04:17] that's awesome can you say amen amen see
[1:04:20] the ones that had killed him and put him
[1:04:23] in the Tomb notice they were guarding it
[1:04:26] making sure that he couldn't leave that
[1:04:28] tomb amen they were making sure that he
[1:04:30] was dead they were making sure amen that
[1:04:33] they could have no contact with that
[1:04:35] body amen and so they were sitting there
[1:04:37] but God would go past the guards amen
[1:04:40] God would go past everything Amen to
[1:04:43] prove his resurrection can you say amen
[1:04:46] amen he couldn't stay in the Tomb amen
[1:04:49] see and the prophet would tell us the
[1:04:51] world put him in a tomb and sealed him
[1:04:54] up in that tomb and so they were making
[1:04:58] him a thing of the past amen see amen
[1:05:02] but then the prophet would tell us that
[1:05:04] Easter morning ruined all of their
[1:05:07] theology ruined all of their plans
[1:05:10] ruined all of their thinking ruined the
[1:05:14] devil's party amen ruined every skeptic
[1:05:18] that was saying see he he was just just
[1:05:21] a normal crazy guy he was just the
[1:05:23] average guy that was taken just like
[1:05:25] everybody else does Amen see ruined it
[1:05:28] all ruined the church's theology ruined
[1:05:31] the world's theology can you say amen
[1:05:34] and whatever power they thought they had
[1:05:38] the
[1:05:39] resurrection defied every bit of the
[1:05:42] government's power every bit of the
[1:05:44] church's power every bit of The Bishop's
[1:05:47] power the resurrection can you say amen
[1:05:51] that's right see so as we know amen and
[1:05:54] it's just by the grace of God that we
[1:05:57] know by the message of the hour that the
[1:06:00] world today has been trying to put
[1:06:02] Christ in a tomb Amen to think of that
[1:06:06] now they've been trying to keep him amen
[1:06:08] and and the prophet would call it a
[1:06:10] Methodist tomb or a Baptist tomb or you
[1:06:13] know Pentecostal or we'd say even
[1:06:15] Apostolic and all of these tombs amen
[1:06:19] and and to think of this that we were
[1:06:22] once in a tomb as well ain't that right
[1:06:25] man brother BR says I I was out of a
[1:06:27] Baptist tomb and and you might have been
[1:06:30] in some other tomb and I was in a
[1:06:32] Pentecostal tomb and and all of that but
[1:06:34] then we find out that he has risen can
[1:06:37] you say Amen he's risen and so the only
[1:06:41] thing that hangs around those type of
[1:06:43] tombs is the devil and you have to say
[1:06:46] it just that way ain't that right and
[1:06:48] he's driving the people to those places
[1:06:52] can you say amen amen that's right see
[1:06:55] and only worshiping a god of history and
[1:06:57] the prophet says they're actually
[1:06:59] worshiping the God of this world which
[1:07:01] is Satan and they don't even know it
[1:07:04] ain't that right amen so the question is
[1:07:06] is why why would we seek the living
[1:07:09] among the dead why would we tell the
[1:07:11] people to go back to their to a
[1:07:13] denomination why would we tell them oh
[1:07:16] you know just go soft and easy with it
[1:07:19] and and well we don't want to offend
[1:07:20] them and we don't want to there so it's
[1:07:22] okay you know they may be whatever amen
[1:07:24] but we really realized by the message of
[1:07:26] the hour that that's a tomb amen that
[1:07:29] only holds the dead can you say Amen but
[1:07:32] if we really believe that Christ is a
[1:07:35] living we want to point people to a
[1:07:38] living
[1:07:39] Messiah do you believe then amen see and
[1:07:43] so as he proved him
[1:07:46] Resurrection in the evening time so is
[1:07:50] he doing it today amen Zechariah 14:6
[1:07:54] and it shall come to pass in that day
[1:07:57] that the light shall not be clear nor
[1:07:59] dark but it shall be one day which shall
[1:08:01] be known to the Lord not day nor night
[1:08:03] but it shall come to pass that evening
[1:08:05] time it shall be light can you say amen
[1:08:10] and the prophet says he takes that
[1:08:11] scripture he says see God was promising
[1:08:14] a
[1:08:15] resurrection God was promising a
[1:08:17] resurrection see and John 14:19 Jesus
[1:08:21] says because I live you shall live also
[1:08:25] Amen to think of that thou amen that I
[1:08:29] live you shall live also no wonder Jesus
[1:08:32] doesn't want us just just dwelling Upon
[1:08:35] A a resurrection of 2,000 years ago what
[1:08:38] about your Resurrection what about the
[1:08:40] resurrection of today that we can talk
[1:08:43] about and and and not talk about from
[1:08:46] from a history amen or or about what
[1:08:49] somebody else experience but I have
[1:08:51] received that same experience that same
[1:08:54] power of the
[1:08:56] Resurrection can you say Amen see so the
[1:09:00] this evening light if if you think of it
[1:09:03] he said it speaking of a promising a
[1:09:06] resurrection well this this evening
[1:09:08] light the prophet would call Messiah
[1:09:11] light amen so when there would be light
[1:09:14] would mean that there would be a messiah
[1:09:17] amen a messiah that would would come
[1:09:20] forth and and and be revealed ain't that
[1:09:23] right now and it would be in the evening
[1:09:25] time and if you just bear with me now
[1:09:28] amen I want to read there in Luke
[1:09:31] 24:13 starting there and behold two of
[1:09:34] them went that same day to a village
[1:09:36] called emus which was from Jerusalem
[1:09:39] about three score fur Longs and they
[1:09:41] talked together of all these things
[1:09:44] which had happened and it came to pass
[1:09:47] while they communed together and reason
[1:09:50] now Jesus had just died they had just
[1:09:53] buried him and so they're they're sad
[1:09:55] and they're talking again they're
[1:09:57] talking of him in the past it was a past
[1:10:00] tense God oh I remember when and oh yes
[1:10:03] I've I remember the stories and I've oh
[1:10:05] this and oh he was just such a good guy
[1:10:08] and and they were crying see they they
[1:10:10] were in despondent they they were
[1:10:12] discouraged their hope had been been
[1:10:14] dashed see amen so so they're they're
[1:10:18] they're talking in that way amen see and
[1:10:21] he says and as they communed together
[1:10:23] and reasoned Jesus himself Drew near and
[1:10:26] went with him but their eyes everybody
[1:10:29] say Their Eyes Were withholden Their
[1:10:33] Eyes Were Holden that they should not
[1:10:36] know him and he said unto them what
[1:10:39] manner of communications are these that
[1:10:41] you have one to another as you walk and
[1:10:44] are sad see amen so so many people are
[1:10:48] sad today amen when religion should uh
[1:10:52] uh Christianity should be joyful man see
[1:10:56] and he says and one of them uh uh whose
[1:10:58] name was Copus and answering and unto
[1:11:02] said unto him art thou only a stranger
[1:11:05] in Jerusalem see and hast thou not known
[1:11:08] the things which are come to pass there
[1:11:10] in these days and he said unto them one
[1:11:12] things and they said unto him concerning
[1:11:14] Jesus of Nazareth which was a mighty
[1:11:16] Prophet indeed and word before God and
[1:11:19] all the people and they go in to
[1:11:22] describe all of the things that and and
[1:11:24] they begin to talk but in the 25th verse
[1:11:26] he says oh he says oh oh fool slow of
[1:11:30] heart to believe all that the prophets
[1:11:31] have spoken ought not Christ to have
[1:11:34] suffered these things and to enter into
[1:11:36] his glory and beginning at Moses and all
[1:11:39] the prophets he expounded unto them in
[1:11:42] all the scriptures con the things
[1:11:44] concerning himself and yet while he's
[1:11:47] doing this their eyes are closed they
[1:11:49] they don't know who he is and they drew
[1:11:51] nigh unto a village whether they went
[1:11:54] and he made as though he would have gone
[1:11:56] farther amen but they constrained him
[1:12:00] saying abide with us for it is toward
[1:12:02] evening and the day is far spent and he
[1:12:06] went in to ter with him and and and it
[1:12:10] came to pass he sat at meat with them he
[1:12:12] took bread and blessed it and break and
[1:12:15] gave to them and their eyes were open
[1:12:19] and they knew him and he vanished out of
[1:12:22] their sight can you say Amen so see the
[1:12:25] prophet would say all through that day
[1:12:27] he had been he he had been bringing the
[1:12:30] word to them with no signs see there's
[1:12:33] no signs and so while he was bringing
[1:12:35] the word to them scripture upon
[1:12:37] scripture upon scripture yet they had no
[1:12:40] idea that he was the one that was
[1:12:42] walking with them can you say Amen they
[1:12:45] didn't know that he had reason or risen
[1:12:48] he says they loved him they believed him
[1:12:50] but they didn't know he had raised from
[1:12:52] the dead and they had even argued
[1:12:54] against see amen arguing the fact that
[1:12:58] he had not risen he's in the grave and
[1:13:00] all these things see but he says when he
[1:13:02] got them inside amen AB by by themselves
[1:13:07] and sat down in the evening time that's
[1:13:10] when he revealed his resurrection do you
[1:13:15] understand why the prophet's Ministry is
[1:13:17] so different from that of of every other
[1:13:19] minister throughout the ages a man is
[1:13:22] because it was more than just a man
[1:13:25] preaching a theology to us and teaching
[1:13:28] us about a God that could and a God that
[1:13:31] would and a God that whatever it was
[1:13:34] revealing the
[1:13:36] resurrection of Jesus Christ to our
[1:13:41] day yes sir that's right he says see he
[1:13:45] never did one thing that he did in life
[1:13:48] only just the word but notice at the
[1:13:51] evening time at the evening time that's
[1:13:54] when he proved D his resurrection am so
[1:13:57] notice he says we've gone through a
[1:13:59] dismal day A Dark Day neither light nor
[1:14:02] dark see and we've been hearing the word
[1:14:05] with no
[1:14:06] manifestation see just a gloomy foggy
[1:14:09] day but in the evening light sir in the
[1:14:13] evening time the light that evening
[1:14:15] light is shining again can you say man
[1:14:19] aren't you glad for that it's shining he
[1:14:22] said see down through the years we've
[1:14:24] had all these scripture teachings but
[1:14:27] it's this day for the manifestation the
[1:14:32] manifestations of the
[1:14:35] Resurrection amen so we read there where
[1:14:38] Paul where where it says that he done
[1:14:40] something and he quickly vanished out of
[1:14:43] their midst he he had vanished and the
[1:14:45] prophet said see notice it was a short
[1:14:47] message it wasn't very long can you say
[1:14:50] amen he didn't stay long with him he
[1:14:53] just manifested him himself and vanished
[1:14:56] out of their sight and their eyes were
[1:14:59] open and they knew that was him and they
[1:15:02] said did not our hearts burn within us
[1:15:04] as he talked to us along the road now
[1:15:07] Christianity is is not based on
[1:15:11] replacement it's based on Resurrection
[1:15:14] Resurrection is not replacement can you
[1:15:16] say amen and and while many people again
[1:15:21] and and I'm not bashing it's just the
[1:15:24] facts and we could being there but but
[1:15:26] most while they're talking about a
[1:15:28] resurrection of 2,000 years ago they're
[1:15:32] replacing amen Christ today Amen to say
[1:15:36] he's alive but it's all historic amen
[1:15:39] while they're replacing him with
[1:15:42] programs with Bishops with Creeds and
[1:15:45] dogmas and and and all kinds of things
[1:15:48] can you say amen amen see it's
[1:15:50] replacement so the resurrection is not
[1:15:54] really a amen uh meaningful to them amen
[1:15:58] because Resurrection is not replacement
[1:16:00] the same Jesus that went down is the
[1:16:02] same Jesus that came up can you say Amen
[1:16:06] not replaced but resurrected now we know
[1:16:09] that Abel was a type of Christ and how
[1:16:11] that he was killed amen and and and then
[1:16:16] here God would raise up Seth to take his
[1:16:19] place amen and and that was a
[1:16:22] replacement but the prophet said what
[1:16:24] that was was nothing but a preaster amen
[1:16:28] see amen God showing that another
[1:16:31] righteous seed would come amen but it
[1:16:33] was only a replacement but when the they
[1:16:37] killed Christ amen the Royal Seed of
[1:16:41] Abraham amen not was he replaced but he
[1:16:45] resurrected he didn't need a replacement
[1:16:49] he was that resurrection and life can
[1:16:54] you say Amen
[1:16:55] so Christ is not replaced he's
[1:16:58] resurrected amen now we all know the
[1:17:01] scripture very well Luke
[1:17:03] 1728 likewise also as it was in the days
[1:17:07] of lot they did eat they drank amen they
[1:17:11] bought they sold they planted they
[1:17:12] builded see but the same day that lot
[1:17:15] went out of Sodom it rained fire and
[1:17:17] brimstone from heaven and destroyed them
[1:17:20] all even thus shall it be in the day
[1:17:24] when the of man is revealed can you say
[1:17:27] Amen see so what is this it's proving
[1:17:31] that he is alive this son of man
[1:17:34] revealing himself is the evening light
[1:17:37] that was promised in Zechariah it's the
[1:17:41] Messiah like ain't that right so as we
[1:17:44] know and and again thank God for the
[1:17:46] message cuz we wouldn't have got it amen
[1:17:49] and it just by Revelation amen uh can we
[1:17:52] still really understand it and Perce
[1:17:54] receive it but but how did amen God
[1:17:58] appear to Abraham in the days of lot
[1:18:02] amen everybody talks about the days of
[1:18:03] lot Sodom and gorah but they really
[1:18:05] missed the secret of it is that God
[1:18:08] manifested himself in that day to the
[1:18:12] elect can you say amen amen and he
[1:18:16] manifested himself not in spirit form
[1:18:20] but in man form in human form form ain't
[1:18:25] that right amen see down through the
[1:18:27] seven Church ages we've gone through the
[1:18:29] spirit of God spirit of God Amen but in
[1:18:33] this day it's come back to the son of
[1:18:36] man amen amen Son of God Son of Man see
[1:18:41] so he appeared to Abraham Amen in the
[1:18:44] days of lot amen as a form of a man in
[1:18:48] the form of a man the prophet said
[1:18:51] Abraham had seen God in many different
[1:18:53] forms in a light in Visions but here was
[1:18:58] God in a man just before the weighted
[1:19:02] and promised son appeared he said see
[1:19:05] God had appeared in many forms as he has
[1:19:08] through the church ages in lights and so
[1:19:11] forth as he spoke to Abraham and by
[1:19:14] Voices but just before the coming son
[1:19:17] arrived he changed the body of Abraham
[1:19:21] and Sarah immediately after this so they
[1:19:24] could received the son and notice the
[1:19:27] last sign that they got before the son
[1:19:29] arrived was Jehovah talking to them in
[1:19:32] the form of a man oh aren't you glad for
[1:19:35] that amen see amen and how they know
[1:19:39] this was Jehovah was because he said
[1:19:41] Abraham not Abram just a few days before
[1:19:44] God changed his name where is thy wife
[1:19:47] Sarah not Sarah but Sarah princess see
[1:19:51] and Abraham said but she's in the tent
[1:19:53] behind you and he said I I personal
[1:19:57] pronoun I will visit you according to my
[1:20:00] promise at the time of life the next 28
[1:20:03] days something is going to happen to
[1:20:05] Sarah see and Sarah in the tent smiled
[1:20:08] in herself and said in her heart how
[1:20:11] could this be saying I'm old and have
[1:20:14] pleasure with my Lord who is also old uh
[1:20:17] uh Abraham see and and the angel or the
[1:20:21] man said why did Sarah say in her heart
[1:20:24] see in the tent behind him why did she
[1:20:27] say these things cannot be see it was a
[1:20:30] man in human flesh like a prophet yet it
[1:20:34] was Elohim Discerning the thought that
[1:20:37] was in Sarah's heart behind him and so
[1:20:40] Jesus would tell us as it was in the
[1:20:42] days of lot so shall it be at the coming
[1:20:45] of the end of the world when the son of
[1:20:47] man not Son of God the son of man would
[1:20:51] be revealed
[1:20:53] again amen can you say Amen what a
[1:20:58] resurrection now we we find there in
[1:21:01] Matthew uh 12 and 38 Jesus uh here well
[1:21:06] it says and then certain of the scribes
[1:21:08] and of the Pharisees answered saying
[1:21:10] Master we would see a sign from thee so
[1:21:14] they were sign Seekers just like the
[1:21:16] Pentecostal sign Seekers they got to
[1:21:19] have a goosebump before they really
[1:21:20] think they're saved you know they got to
[1:21:22] have someone prophesy they got to have
[1:21:24] someone to have a vision they got to
[1:21:25] have someone to have a dream they got to
[1:21:27] have someone to you know uh uh uh say
[1:21:30] something good it it they they're sign
[1:21:32] Seekers ain't that right and so Jesus
[1:21:35] would tell them and say now an evil and
[1:21:39] adulterous generation seeketh after a
[1:21:42] sign and there shall no sign be given it
[1:21:46] uh but the sign of the Prophet Jonas now
[1:21:49] notice for as Jonas was in three days
[1:21:52] and three nights in the Well's belly so
[1:21:55] shall the son of man be three days and
[1:21:57] three nights in the heart of the earth
[1:22:00] ain't that right now Jonah Jonah was as
[1:22:03] good as dead amen L being in that uh the
[1:22:07] the the the the belly of that well amen
[1:22:11] see but then he come forth as one risen
[1:22:15] from the dead ain't that right so God
[1:22:17] would tell them now you you know the
[1:22:20] prophet told us that Jesus was actually
[1:22:22] prophesying he wasn't just speaking of
[1:22:25] that day which they that in one sense he
[1:22:27] was but yet this is the worst age ever
[1:22:31] it we are living in this prophecy of of
[1:22:35] where the it's an adulterous evil Wicked
[1:22:38] generation amen and there would be a
[1:22:41] sign now you think of that I don't know
[1:22:43] about you but I I I as me personally I
[1:22:46] never was able to uh uh put that App
[1:22:50] apply that to our day amen and to really
[1:22:53] understand that until I come into the
[1:22:55] message of the hour amen and and and see
[1:22:59] so so having a prophet as as we said
[1:23:02] before God sending a prophet to us is
[1:23:05] Grace To Us amen that we could
[1:23:08] understand amen what God was really
[1:23:10] saying for us in our day amen see so
[1:23:15] we're living in the generation that was
[1:23:18] receive the sign and brother brandom
[1:23:20] said it is the resurrection sign it's
[1:23:23] not just a a sign of people just
[1:23:26] laughing in the spirit it's not the sign
[1:23:28] of everybody speaking in tongues and
[1:23:30] prophesying and and rolling on the floor
[1:23:33] I've been there seeing all that done and
[1:23:35] and and and doing flipflops and
[1:23:37] cartwheels in the church and and you
[1:23:39] know we get so excited that you know the
[1:23:41] preacher could be preaching and someone
[1:23:43] stand up and start prophesying and and
[1:23:46] the preacher get done you know would
[1:23:47] stop preaching everybody get quiet and
[1:23:49] before you know preacher wouldn't even
[1:23:51] he wouldn't even finish his text you
[1:23:53] know and everybody start dancing and
[1:23:55] shouting and the preacher say well the
[1:23:56] Lord's had his way here tonight and and
[1:23:59] uh we we called that being the presence
[1:24:01] of the Lord well brother Rand called
[1:24:04] back blessings and he told us that
[1:24:06] you're not supposed to interrupt the
[1:24:07] preacher when he's standing there
[1:24:08] preaching the gospel didn't you say Amen
[1:24:11] see and so he put things in order but
[1:24:13] that still wasn't the sign that we were
[1:24:15] looking for amen it would be a
[1:24:19] resurrection
[1:24:21] sign amen ain't that right Hallelujah so
[1:24:24] the son of man being revealed Alive Now
[1:24:28] how did Jesus show that he was the
[1:24:30] Messiah we can take that scripture there
[1:24:33] in John 4:1 16- 26 where Jesus goes and
[1:24:38] talking to this Samaritan woman and as
[1:24:41] they're talking he's trying to catch
[1:24:42] your spirit ain't that right it's what
[1:24:44] the prophet told us and and then he
[1:24:46] tells her go get your husband she says I
[1:24:48] have none and and and so he says yep
[1:24:52] yeah uh you you spoke right for thou has
[1:24:54] had five husbands and and the one that
[1:24:56] you're living with now is not thy
[1:24:58] husband and and the woman just by him
[1:25:00] saying that said sir I perceive that thy
[1:25:03] heart a prophet amen why he's doing the
[1:25:06] very same thing that mzc did mzc did to
[1:25:10] Abraham and now he's showing that same
[1:25:13] sign can you say amen amen and by that
[1:25:17] sign she realized that he was the
[1:25:19] Messiah amen and as he goes down she she
[1:25:23] says well our fathers worshiped in this
[1:25:25] mountain and you say that Jerusalem is
[1:25:26] the place where men ought to worship and
[1:25:29] and and so he's starting to talk to her
[1:25:31] and all these things and and in the 25th
[1:25:33] verse amen of of John uhh 16 I believe
[1:25:38] it is um it it says uh uh the woman SI
[1:25:42] unto him I know that Messiah cometh I
[1:25:45] know messiah's coming which is called
[1:25:48] the Christ and when he comes he will
[1:25:51] tell us all things in other words he
[1:25:53] will do the things that you just did
[1:25:56] ain't that right and Jesus said unto her
[1:25:59] I am he that speaks unto
[1:26:04] thee think of it he knew she knew that
[1:26:08] he was Messiah by the messic sign it was
[1:26:12] sign of the Messiah amen that sign as
[1:26:15] the prophet told us was given to the Jew
[1:26:17] and to the Samaritan but it was now in
[1:26:20] this day amen the son of man would be
[1:26:23] revealed again
[1:26:25] and it would be to the Gentiles a
[1:26:28] resurrection sign a resurrection sign
[1:26:31] can you say Amen that you would not have
[1:26:33] to talk about God in the past but you
[1:26:36] could know that he's alive today by the
[1:26:39] sign that he would perform in this age
[1:26:42] can you say Amen what would he do he
[1:26:45] would prove that he's not a corpse in
[1:26:47] some denominational tomb can you say
[1:26:50] Amen now notice brother Brown says I'm
[1:26:52] fully persuaded that people are are not
[1:26:54] getting to Christ amen I believe that
[1:26:57] it's the enemy that's throw this
[1:26:58] entrance amen because the reason I
[1:27:01] believe this he's not the object that
[1:27:03] they have been pointing to see the
[1:27:05] people's been pointed to they have
[1:27:06] either been pointed to a Dogma a
[1:27:08] Doctrine a party or experience or a
[1:27:12] sensation or something like that instead
[1:27:14] of being pointed to Christ the word can
[1:27:17] you say Amen another place says now
[1:27:19] there's many people who love him who
[1:27:21] doesn't yet realize that he is alive and
[1:27:24] they it's some kind of a history that
[1:27:27] they have learned in some school it's
[1:27:30] some book of theology some ethics code
[1:27:33] of ethics that they have studied
[1:27:35] somewhere and Jesus is a historical
[1:27:39] figure to them and yet in the history
[1:27:43] they love
[1:27:44] him they're hearing the history of him
[1:27:48] and they love him can you say Amen yet
[1:27:52] they don't realize that he is alive with
[1:27:56] us walking around with us just as he
[1:27:59] always did he is here the same as he
[1:28:03] ever
[1:28:04] was what a blessed people to know that
[1:28:08] he's
[1:28:11] alive sir not knowing it because you
[1:28:14] went to some Easter
[1:28:16] play and what some guy come out of the
[1:28:19] Tomb and everybody gets
[1:28:21] excited and you say well he's alive cuz
[1:28:24] they said it but you've seen his
[1:28:28] sign of
[1:28:30] messiah messiah light right God sent
[1:28:35] John the Baptist to point out to the
[1:28:37] people the Lamb of God among them
[1:28:41] everyone would have missed it they would
[1:28:44] have missed that he was the
[1:28:47] Messiah the prophet said John would have
[1:28:49] missed it had it not been revealed to
[1:28:52] him reation amen but see after John
[1:28:56] pointed him out to the
[1:28:58] people what did John say I must decrease
[1:29:03] that he may increase amen his ministry
[1:29:07] was finished he introduced Messiah on
[1:29:11] earth now the prophet said God sent his
[1:29:13] prophet and as soon as the prophet got
[1:29:15] through with his message the Lord
[1:29:17] followed the prophet's message for
[1:29:19] deliverance oh we are living in a grand
[1:29:22] time immediately when the prophet went
[1:29:24] off the scene what happened the Lord
[1:29:26] came on the scene as soon as John went
[1:29:29] off the scene the Lord came on the scene
[1:29:31] very strange how God works but he does
[1:29:33] it he works in mysterious way ain't that
[1:29:36] right another place he was the word he
[1:29:39] was the word made light who was Messiah
[1:29:42] ain't that right he was the word made
[1:29:45] light amen see he was the word
[1:29:48] manifested then when he come on the
[1:29:50] scene John says I must decrease he must
[1:29:54] increase see two of them couldn't stay
[1:29:57] at the same time John had to go but
[1:30:01] Jesus remained Jesus didn't leave when
[1:30:04] the prophet
[1:30:06] left can you say Amen the prophet left
[1:30:09] and Jesus remained and so is it
[1:30:15] today brother Brandon may not be on the
[1:30:17] scene but he doesn't need to be on the
[1:30:19] scene the very one he introduced to us
[1:30:22] is on the scene
[1:30:26] Lord do you believe it amen to God we
[1:30:29] find that brother bram's Ministry was
[1:30:31] the
[1:30:32] forrun of the second
[1:30:36] coming and he introduced Messiah do you
[1:30:39] believe that we we could spend some time
[1:30:42] on that brother Bram says my Ministry is
[1:30:45] to declare he is here amen he is here
[1:30:49] and did he not do that he could take
[1:30:51] that scripture he's the same yesterday
[1:30:53] today and forever and make it so real to
[1:30:55] us ain't that right that even the
[1:30:58] Skeptics that were in that day thought
[1:31:00] that he I've read a lot of a lot of them
[1:31:03] from from uh uh uh lot lot of the
[1:31:07] preachers in that day Jack Moore and and
[1:31:10] uh uh man or Roberts and and uh just so
[1:31:15] many more amen where they said there
[1:31:17] there's one thing about till Osburn it
[1:31:19] reminded us of Bible days again one one
[1:31:23] preacher said said we had preached about
[1:31:24] it we were talking about it that God
[1:31:26] would do this and God did this he said
[1:31:28] but it was all in history we talked
[1:31:30] about it but it was all in history he
[1:31:32] said but then when we come he said when
[1:31:34] I first come into that in into a meeting
[1:31:37] of of of of of William brandom he says I
[1:31:40] I thought it all everything that I had
[1:31:43] been saying everything I'd been talking
[1:31:44] about as a history was standing right
[1:31:47] there before me it brought Jesus Christ
[1:31:50] on the scene can you say Amen see that
[1:31:54] was what his ministry was and so now
[1:31:56] brother brandham has gone off the scene
[1:31:59] but that same Jesus Christ is here among
[1:32:02] us we must never let that foret fail us
[1:32:06] don't you forget that Christ is here
[1:32:09] Among Us that's right yes sir true where
[1:32:15] is he today that we may know him amen
[1:32:19] Ephesians 1:22 Paul tells us that the
[1:32:23] church is the body body of Jesus Christ
[1:32:26] and haveth put all things under his feet
[1:32:27] and gave him to be head the head over
[1:32:30] all things to the church which is his
[1:32:32] body amen can you say amen amen now you
[1:32:36] know a body if it don't have life in it
[1:32:39] it's nothing but a
[1:32:41] corpse that's what makes the churches a
[1:32:43] corpse is they have no life no but there
[1:32:46] is a body of Jesus Christ on the Earth
[1:32:49] today it's not a physical body it is the
[1:32:53] mystical body body of Jesus Christ and
[1:32:55] the Very life that was in that physical
[1:32:58] body is here today the very power that
[1:33:01] was in that physical body is in the body
[1:33:03] of Jesus Christ today the
[1:33:06] church do you believe that amen
[1:33:08] Ephesians 5:29 for we are members of his
[1:33:11] body of his flesh and of his bones amen
[1:33:16] see making it very personal to us today
[1:33:19] amen John 14:16 and I will pray Jesus
[1:33:22] says I will pray the father and he will
[1:33:24] give you another comforter that he may
[1:33:26] abide with you forever even the spirit
[1:33:29] of Truth whom the world cannot receive
[1:33:31] because it seeth him not neither knoweth

[1:34:30] know the church is going to know his
[1:34:32] body is going to know amen while they're
[1:34:34] all talking about Christ as a historical
[1:34:38] God there is a people that is his body
[1:34:42] that knows where he's at they know where
[1:34:45] he's at he's
[1:34:48] alive can you say Amen am oh Messiah
[1:34:52] light now notice
[1:34:54] uh uh uh Isaiah 60 And1 arise Shine for
[1:34:58] thy light is come and the glory of the
[1:35:02] Lord is risen upon thee now the prophet
[1:35:05] used this scripture so many times as for
[1:35:07] this age thy light is the evening light
[1:35:11] can you say amen amen for Behold The
[1:35:14] Darkness shall cover the Earth gross
[1:35:15] Darkness the people but the Lord shall

[1:35:27] resurrection shall arise upon thee and
[1:35:30] His glory shall be seen upon thee not
[1:35:34] somewhere else but upon
[1:35:36] you not in the heavens but upon
[1:35:40] you deity is not in
[1:35:43] heaven it's in you that's what a prophet
[1:35:46] said can you say Amen believe so what is
[1:35:48] it the son of man is being
[1:35:50] revealed being revealed do you still
[1:35:52] believe he's been revealed I believe the
[1:35:55] prophet performed that Messiah sign the
[1:35:59] son of man was revealed let us know that
[1:36:01] he's alive and well that he's on the
[1:36:03] earth now but I believe he's still in a
[1:36:06] body being revealed as son of
[1:36:10] man believe I know one had told me years
[1:36:13] ago said well we we we we we we're back
[1:36:16] in the Son of God age only brother
[1:36:18] Brandon's Ministry was son of man I said
[1:36:20] oh no no no I didn't understand
[1:36:22] everything about it but I said no I do
[1:36:23] don't believe that at all I believe that
[1:36:25] if he revealed himself as son of man
[1:36:28] there is a church that he has taken
[1:36:30] flesh upon amen he's taken up on my
[1:36:33] flesh he's taken up on your flesh and
[1:36:35] his very character is being shaped and
[1:36:38] molded in the Church of the Living God
[1:36:40] his very power his very essence is in
[1:36:43] the Church of the Living God can you say
[1:36:47] Amen he's alive and well amen the Bible
[1:36:52] says that wise shall know their God Amen
[1:36:55] think of that now the wise shall know
[1:36:57] their God true and they will be the ones
[1:37:00] that will do great exploits you know
[1:37:03] brother brandom applied that to this age
[1:37:05] here at the revealing of the son of man
[1:37:08] when he would reveal the resurrection
[1:37:11] sign would be performed amen there would
[1:37:13] be a wise people that wouldn't just
[1:37:15] shuck it off say well that's just beenal
[1:37:17] telepathy that's just psychology that's
[1:37:19] just Ah that's just whatever oh no they
[1:37:22] become wise
[1:37:24] amen they start to look and they start
[1:37:25] to ponder and they start understanding
[1:37:28] and they realize that's my God not that
[1:37:30] body not not brother Brandon being God
[1:37:33] now can you say Amen but there was a God
[1:37:36] Amen in that
[1:37:37] [Applause]
[1:37:38] body revealing but notice the wicked
[1:37:41] will not know the god of Heaven no sir
[1:37:45] so what will they know him they'll know
[1:37:46] him in a form they'll know him in ritual
[1:37:50] but the prophet said they don't know him
[1:37:52] by the way of
[1:37:55] perfection ain't that right am see God
[1:37:58] can only work through Perfection for he
[1:38:00] is perfect ain't that right so therefore
[1:38:03] it has to be a perfect Channel amen that
[1:38:06] God works through see amen because the
[1:38:09] prophet said he cannot stain himself in
[1:38:12] any way he can't come and work through
[1:38:16] sin it stain his Holiness it would stain
[1:38:19] him see he doesn't work through human
[1:38:22] Ambitions he doesn't work through some
[1:38:24] sinful uh filthy whatever you know amen
[1:38:28] no he's got to have Perfection he's got
[1:38:31] to have a perfect channel to work
[1:38:33] through can you say Amen cuz he's not
[1:38:35] going to stain himself see and notice
[1:38:38] what the prophet said that's why Jesus
[1:38:40] come to take away our sins amen that we
[1:38:45] might be perfected that God could work
[1:38:48] through his church and there is where
[1:38:51] the secret lays can you say amen how
[1:38:54] that God could work through US amen the
[1:38:57] secret is is he took me and he washed me
[1:39:01] he cleansed me he perfected me to where
[1:39:04] he can't even see my sins Hallelujah
[1:39:07] can't even see you as a sinner can you
[1:39:09] say amen amen he can't see you because
[1:39:12] there's a blood and it was his own
[1:39:14] created blood amen so was the blood of
[1:39:18] Jesus Christ that he could loose you
[1:39:21] from all sins Hallelujah
[1:39:24] amen now he's got a church that he can
[1:39:26] work through a perfect
[1:39:29] Channel amen they've died to themselves
[1:39:33] it's his character being molded in them
[1:39:35] now it's his ways being being worked
[1:39:38] through them now it's his voice it's his
[1:39:41] thoughts it's it's everything has to do
[1:39:43] with him we have become his hands we
[1:39:46] become his feet we become everything
[1:39:48] that he
[1:39:49] is that's what he said Do you believe it
[1:39:54] amen Jesus told the disciples he said
[1:39:56] tear ye into the in the city of
[1:39:58] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[1:40:01] from on high
[1:40:03] amen amen don't do nothing till you
[1:40:06] become
[1:40:06] indued we understand that now that that
[1:40:09] power is resurrection power ain't that
[1:40:12] right so for two for nearly 2,000 years
[1:40:16] we've had had a dark world of theology
[1:40:21] amen and the prophet says the Holy
[1:40:23] Spirit Spirit has been bound by these
[1:40:24] denominational Rivers for almost 2,000
[1:40:26] years but is everybody say it is to be
[1:40:30] loosed in the evening time evening time
[1:40:34] what is going to be loose Messiah light
[1:40:37] can you say Amen Messiah light Amen to
[1:40:40] fulfill Zachariah Amen in the evening
[1:40:43] time it shall be light can you say Amen
[1:40:46] to fulfill amen the prophet Isaiah arise
[1:40:49] Shine for thy light is come God would
[1:40:52] send a message in this time an evening
[1:40:55] time message Amen to loose the holy
[1:40:58] spirit in the evening time by the
[1:41:00] evening time message brother Bram said
[1:41:02] what is it it's the Holy Spirit back in
[1:41:05] the church again Christ himself revealed
[1:41:09] in human flesh in the evening
[1:41:12] time evening time God praise the
[1:41:18] Lord
[1:41:20] that's Galatians
[1:41:22] 2:20
[1:41:23] Paul would tell us I'm crucified with
[1:41:25] Christ and this is all of our life here
[1:41:28] this is our story I'm crucified with
[1:41:31] Christ nevertheless I live what you died
[1:41:35] to your old self died to your old ways
[1:41:38] died to your nature died to your past
[1:41:42] died to your habits died to sin died to
[1:41:46] hate died to bitterness died to to lust
[1:41:49] died to what you
[1:41:51] died but never unless I live praise the
[1:41:55] Lord praise the Lord yet not I but
[1:41:58] Christ liveth in me can you say amen and
[1:42:03] the life which I now live in the flesh I
[1:42:07] live by the faith of the Son of God who
[1:42:09] loved me and gave himself for me so
[1:42:12] notice what the prophet said his
[1:42:14] standing light is the light of Messiah
[1:42:18] his standing light is the light of
[1:42:20] Messiah risen Christ in his
[1:42:25] people the anointed ones carrying forth
[1:42:28] his light into all the church ages can
[1:42:31] you say Amen now notice Romans 8:11 very
[1:42:35] uh uh uh common scripture to us for it
[1:42:39] speaks for us amen but if the spirit of
[1:42:43] him that raised up Jesus from the dead
[1:42:44] dwell in you he that raised up Christ
[1:42:47] from the dead shall also Quicken your
[1:42:49] mortal bodies you get it that's why we
[1:42:52] couldn't stay in do amen
[1:42:55] amen can you say amen that's why sons of
[1:42:59] God Daughters of God couldn't stay in a
[1:43:01] in in
[1:43:02] denomination we have been gathered by a
[1:43:05] supernatural power a supernatural
[1:43:07] happening it was the quickening power
[1:43:10] that took us out we couldn't be
[1:43:12] satisfied there can you say amen God
[1:43:15] could not reveal to him to the world a
[1:43:18] Living Church his living body in some
[1:43:20] old dead tomb and we will not not let
[1:43:23] some old dead carcass corse amen bring
[1:43:26] us back to dead religion just ain't
[1:43:28] going to do it Christ is living can you
[1:43:31] sayen Christ lives God he that raised up
[1:43:35] Christ from the dead shall also Quicken
[1:43:37] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[1:43:39] dwelleth in you and we know what Quicken
[1:43:41] is is to make Alive Now notice amen and
[1:43:44] I saw another Mighty Angel all right
[1:43:48] come down from heaven Glory oh god with
[1:43:52] an open book Thank God Amen Hallelujah
[1:43:56] you know what it was it was the
[1:43:57] quickening power yes it was that spirit
[1:44:00] that quickened Christ from the dead here
[1:44:02] he comes and every name written on the
[1:44:05] Lamb's Book of Life you see because the
[1:44:08] prophet was saying I was listening to
[1:44:09] him today and I think it was in the
[1:44:11] Easter uh uh rising of the Sun the
[1:44:14] rising of the Sun and and he said see
[1:44:17] the spirit could only what it does it
[1:44:19] only quickens the word do you understand
[1:44:22] that they've made such Frolic out of and
[1:44:24] such a a a misuse of the spirit of God
[1:44:27] and misinterpreted what the spirit of
[1:44:29] God is I've seen him danc and shouting
[1:44:32] and all that and still live like a devil
[1:44:34] outside the church and all of that see
[1:44:37] and and having all this baggage and most
[1:44:39] people are now claiming to have the Holy
[1:44:41] Ghost and yet smoking their cigarettes
[1:44:43] and and and doing all kinds of vile
[1:44:46] things and and and and and and all these
[1:44:48] things but here's what the prophet said
[1:44:51] see the spirit comes to Quicken the word
[1:44:54] can you say Amen the spirit comes to
[1:44:57] Quicken the word it doesn't just come
[1:44:59] amen and just suit your fancy and give
[1:45:01] you chill bums but it quickens the word
[1:45:04] that's been predestinated before the
[1:45:07] foundation of the world can you say amen
[1:45:10] amen there is a destiny for you God had
[1:45:13] a destiny he says I've given you an
[1:45:16] expected end now that Spirit The Same
[1:45:20] Spirit that quicked Christ has come in
[1:45:23] this day with an open book to Quicken

[1:45:29] the foundation of the
[1:45:31] world come on now it's not a literal

[1:45:42] hallelujah notice notice see he said
[1:45:46] it's the Holy Spirit coming down to
[1:45:47] Quicken make alive those people that's
[1:45:50] been foreordained to be in the rapture
[1:45:53] yeah what how then then we we must not
[1:45:56] be afraid that we're going to miss the
[1:45:58] Rapture that's what he's come for is the

[1:46:10] through the
[1:46:11] tribulation how can you be bride it's
[1:46:14] already predestinated for you to go and
[1:46:17] he has come in this day to Quicken the
[1:46:21] seed that's

[1:46:35] power in that
[1:46:37] light I think I've told you
[1:46:39] before but uh at our church back in
[1:46:43] Oklahoma the old
[1:46:47] church it was you know it had uh it it
[1:46:51] had little little uh Windows you know
[1:46:55] about like that and I think it had three
[1:46:57] of them but uh we had concrete floor
[1:47:02] which it was
[1:47:04] carpeted then we had a stone
[1:47:08] Altar and and then the top of it was
[1:47:11] concrete and uh anyway they laid the
[1:47:14] rock and all that so it was you know and
[1:47:16] I'm sure the con the the foundation of
[1:47:18] it was pretty thick I I would assume and
[1:47:23] but you know we we had that I we had
[1:47:26] bought the church from another church
[1:47:29] that uh Nazarene church and and we had
[1:47:32] been in there for you know I don't know
[1:47:36] 10 years or so and but one day we come
[1:47:39] in and noticed that there was a blade of
[1:47:44] grass that had come between the car
[1:47:48] carpet or between the Altar and the
[1:47:51] floor and right there was a blade of
[1:47:53] grass and the window was sitting you
[1:47:56] know a little ways over from that right
[1:47:59] and I thought well how in the world
[1:48:00] could that grass get there and look and
[1:48:03] and there was a crack right along that
[1:48:06] seam and the power of that
[1:48:10] sun even though it wasn't shining
[1:48:13] directly on it cuz there was a roof and
[1:48:16] all that but the
[1:48:18] light from that wind the window gave it
[1:48:21] some power allowed the strength of that
[1:48:24] sun to call that seed just just because
[1:48:27] there was concrete there didn't mean
[1:48:29] that there wasn't seed it just was
[1:48:32] needing light to call
[1:48:35] it can you say amen and I I thought of
[1:48:39] that because you know here Jesus you
[1:48:41] know when you're looking at like Mary
[1:48:43] Magdalene that was her life was a wretch
[1:48:46] but all the way through even through the
[1:48:48] Bible look at Rahab the Harlot and and
[1:48:51] uh well just just all through and but
[1:48:53] Mary Magdalene and uh uh had Seven
[1:48:57] Devils cast out of her look at the woman
[1:48:59] and it may be the same I can't remember
[1:49:01] right off but here the Pharisees the
[1:49:03] Pharisees was going to kill this lady
[1:49:06] cuz they caught her in adultery right
[1:49:08] and they bring her to Jesus as they were
[1:49:10] passing they already had the Rocks they
[1:49:12] already had it all the ammunition and
[1:49:14] and so but so they were already on their
[1:49:15] way but they passed Jesus and they
[1:49:17] thought you know what let's stop for
[1:49:18] just a moment before we do this thing
[1:49:20] and find out what he has to say about it
[1:49:23] you know and and no doubt they thought
[1:49:25] well you know he's going to really Rain
[1:49:27] judgment down and Jesus says ye without
[1:49:32] sin cast the first stone I don't know
[1:49:35] what he was doing when he was writing on
[1:49:36] the ground you know all these things but
[1:49:39] whatever happened in that moment it
[1:49:41] changed their mind and they began to C
[1:49:44] drop the stones and they walked away and
[1:49:47] he looked at that lady and says where
[1:49:49] are thine accusers and he she says I
[1:49:51] have none it was the power that he had
[1:49:56] and and and you can look at the man of
[1:49:57] gathering that that no one could help
[1:49:59] him but here he come the word made flesh
[1:50:03] amen and he set that man free and all
[1:50:05] the way through and here we are in this
[1:50:07] age where where where the mighty Angel
[1:50:11] has come with an open book and and the
[1:50:14] prophet said why did he do it why has he
[1:50:16] come to claim those he had
[1:50:20] redeemed to claim he's got the power no
[1:50:23] matter how much concrete is over your
[1:50:25] life he's got the power can you say Amen
[1:50:28] no matter how bad it seems and how
[1:50:30] impossible it seem he has the power and
[1:50:34] that's what it's all about it's his
[1:50:36] resurrection power amen loose her and
[1:50:40] let her
[1:50:43] go is that not what was said House of
[1:50:46] Hell give way in the name of
[1:50:48] Jesus Amen you love
[1:50:51] him so how how did God make Jesus known
[1:50:58] back there brother Brown said by sending
[1:51:00] him and anointing him with his own
[1:51:02] spirit and Jesus said if I do not the
[1:51:04] works of my father then believe me not
[1:51:07] is that right if I do the works then you
[1:51:10] believe the works because why he didn't
[1:51:13] hook up with their organizations and
[1:51:14] their denominations he stood out from
[1:51:17] all of them bald them out and they say
[1:51:20] he tore up churches and everything
[1:51:23] well see could you expect his Spirit to
[1:51:25] do anything less when he comes again see
[1:51:29] he will do the same thing because he
[1:51:31] can't change it's God see we can change
[1:51:35] our human selves can change but God
[1:51:37] cannot change he has to be the same he's
[1:51:40] infinite we're in we're finite so he
[1:51:42] cannot change so when he comes upon the
[1:51:45] church his church in the last days what
[1:51:48] will it be a pulled out group amen of
[1:51:52] people people Anointed with the spirit
[1:51:54] of God they will be
[1:51:59] [Applause]
[1:52:00] Messiahs can you say that with me they
[1:52:02] will be
[1:52:05] Messiah why it's evening time it's
[1:52:08] evening time and the world thinks that
[1:52:11] he will reveal himself in his Corporal
[1:52:14] body yet when he comes the world will
[1:52:17] not see his Corporal body the when the
[1:52:19] Rapture takes place they won't see him
[1:52:21] he'll come as a thief in the night hello
[1:52:24] amen but he's revealing himself in his
[1:52:28] mesical body his bride
[1:52:30] body Messiah I love it am I love the
[1:52:34] Lord amen they'll be anointed ones and
[1:52:38] if his spirit is in them they'll do the
[1:52:40] things that he did just exactly can you
[1:52:43] say amen amen oh he's wonderful amen now
[1:52:48] notice what he says
[1:52:50] now if we are born of the spirit again
[1:52:53] of the spirit of God God don't have
[1:52:56] little weak parts and big strong parts
[1:53:00] now think of
[1:53:01] that you may be in your own place
[1:53:06] position and you may seem like a
[1:53:09] nobody you may just be the one that
[1:53:13] greets people as they come in you may be
[1:53:16] the a manner you may be just a musician
[1:53:20] you may be the one that sweeps the floor
[1:53:23] you may be the one that that that talks
[1:53:25] to people out out you know whatever
[1:53:28] whatever God has got you to do that is
[1:53:32] position you know some some people are
[1:53:36] evangelists and go world over some some
[1:53:38] are just just you know helps in the
[1:53:41] church some just stay home and they do
[1:53:44] work for God in the local community it
[1:53:47] it it just all that but no matter what
[1:53:50] what the position that you have God has
[1:53:53] no weak
[1:53:57] Parts in other words the God is Not
[1:54:00] stronger in somebody else than he is in
[1:54:03] you that's good way to put it ain't that
[1:54:05] right you've got the same Authority the
[1:54:08] same
[1:54:10] power that's what brother Bram tried to
[1:54:12] get us to I believe with all my heart
[1:54:15] that he tried to get us to understand
[1:54:17] the God that was within us and to
[1:54:19] recognize how powerful he is in US
[1:54:22] remember how many times that he'd have
[1:54:24] everybody just lay your hands upon each
[1:54:26] other and people would start rising out
[1:54:29] of the Wheelchairs and and pandemonium
[1:54:32] would take place
[1:54:34] right he didn't have to lay hands on
[1:54:37] everybody he was just trying to get
[1:54:39] their
[1:54:40] faith
[1:54:41] amen so God has no weak parts and big
[1:54:45] strong Parts he's altogether God and if
[1:54:48] you had enough God in you till it was
[1:54:50] just a barely a shadow that's enough
[1:54:53] power to make a new Earth that's enough
[1:54:56] power to make a new moon and a new
[1:54:59] system it's God and it's
[1:55:02] strong see and right now and every
[1:55:05] believer in here has eternal
[1:55:08] life which is God's spirit in you enough
[1:55:12] power that'll raise up the dead that'll
[1:55:16] heal the sick that'll set orbits in
[1:55:19] Condition it's controlled by law that
[1:55:23] Spirit that's in you can you say Amen
[1:55:25] now notice you are Sons and Daughters of
[1:55:28] God Amen that same spirit that you've
[1:55:31] got in you will raise yourself up at the
[1:55:35] day of Resurrection hallu amen amen can
[1:55:39] you say amen
[1:55:40] amen in another place he says Jesus is
[1:55:43] so close to coming to the earth now
[1:55:45] until his power has began to catch the
[1:55:48] people and winding them up getting them
[1:55:51] ready for the bride getting ready to be
[1:55:54] caught up in the Rapture a church
[1:55:57] that'll just fit exactly see to be taken
[1:56:01] up through its power will draw all the
[1:56:05] rest of them that's born again out of
[1:56:07] the earth that's right oh do you love
[1:56:10] him is the Lord
[1:56:12] wonderful amen amen amen we could go on
[1:56:15] and on but I'll hope we've helped you
[1:56:18] amen I'm so glad for the resurrection of
[1:56:20] today wonderful
[1:56:22] brother BR said what did Jesus had he
[1:56:24] had the quickening
[1:56:26] power and it made it quickened every
[1:56:29] promised word for him that spoke of him
[1:56:32] for his day to where he made it
[1:56:35] live and brother BR said and that's the
[1:56:37] same thing what this quickening power is
[1:56:41] doing for us amen it's quickening every
[1:56:44] promised word for our day that speaks of
[1:56:49] this bride prise the Lord can you sayen
[1:56:53] oh he
[1:56:54] lives he
[1:56:56] lives amen if the musicians will
[1:56:59] come thank God he
[1:57:01] lives the Lord is so wonderful to
[1:57:06] us amen hallelujah I
[1:57:11] believe now what kind of a
[1:57:14] church is Christ being revealed
[1:57:18] in it's the same kind of a church that
[1:57:21] he started on the day of
[1:57:23] Pentecost it's a Pentecostal
[1:57:27] church and it's made up of people who
[1:57:30] have received the Pentecostal blessing
[1:57:34] praise the Lord that's what the prophet
[1:57:36] said and he said what is what is this
[1:57:40] Pentecostal blessing it's the
[1:57:42] confirmation of the Resurrection
[1:57:44] absolutely can you say Amen so the only
[1:57:47] way that a man can be Pentecostal I know
[1:57:49] Pentecostal seems to be a curse word
[1:57:51] among the message folks
[1:57:53] pentec if the Devil Makes that that bad
[1:57:55] to you of a Pentecostal the word
[1:57:57] Pentecostal something wrong yes amen
[1:58:00] it's not God that made Pentecostal
[1:58:03] Pentecostal comes from God not the
[1:58:06] devil the only way a man can be
[1:58:09] Pentecostal is to have the Pentecostal
[1:58:12] blessing which is the confirmation of
[1:58:15] the Resurrection that's right can you
[1:58:17] say Amen so we know Pentecost is not a
[1:58:19] denomination it's it's not just a church
[1:58:22] Church name it's it's not just whatever
[1:58:24] Pentecost is an
[1:58:26] experience so then God's church is a
[1:58:29] church that is full of quickening power
[1:58:32] for that's what they received on the day
[1:58:34] of
[1:58:35] Pentecost can you say amen amen that's
[1:58:38] what come in the upper room brother BR
[1:58:41] says and then that quickening power so
[1:58:43] changed them they were scared and it
[1:58:45] turned them into brave people they were
[1:58:48] scared of what the Jews would do and
[1:58:49] they were trembling right but when that
[1:58:52] quickening power came had so quickened
[1:58:55] them changed them yes sir that they
[1:58:58] would tell anyone about the message of
[1:59:00] the hour they tell anyone about it cuz
[1:59:04] something happened in them amen can you
[1:59:06] say amen amen that's right
[1:59:10] see I like this
[1:59:13] because he says see the holy go Holy
[1:59:16] Spirit came and confirmed to them that
[1:59:18] they would be raised up because they
[1:59:20] were potentially raised then from
[1:59:22] cowards to brave men see they were
[1:59:24] afraid of the very word that they they
[1:59:26] had thought don't let this pass over you
[1:59:28] they were afraid they know that he was
[1:59:31] the word even the Jews had to admit it
[1:59:33] Nicodemus said Rabbi we know that you're
[1:59:35] a teacher come from God see no man can
[1:59:38] do these things except God be with him
[1:59:40] see we know that we recognize that well
[1:59:43] so did the disciples Peter even swore in
[1:59:46] his presence see and all them had
[1:59:49] forsaken him at his crucifixion but here
[1:59:52] they are now in this Upper Room in the
[1:59:54] presence of God and all of a sudden here
[1:59:56] come this Holy Spirit down from heaven
[1:59:58] and it quickened them and the quickening
[2:00:00] took place and they wasn't afraid to
[2:00:02] make a witness of the message that they
[2:00:04] believed and know to be the truth amen
[2:00:06] can you say Amen how many knows that
[2:00:08] this message is the truth do you know
[2:00:11] it's the truth amen we must not be
[2:00:16] afraid to be a witness of
[2:00:18] it cuz we realize this message is proof
[2:00:22] it's the revealing of the son of man
[2:00:24] amen it's Christ himself can you say
[2:00:27] Amen oh praise the Lord what song He's
[2:00:33] Alive and
[2:00:35] Well living in
[2:00:38] me

[2:01:37] forever Jesus is
[2:01:40] [Music]
[2:01:43] Alive as they just play softly brother
[2:01:46] BR said there's a lot of mockery that
[2:01:48] goes with this quickening power or it's
[2:01:51] a lot of of mockery of this quickening
[2:01:53] power people thinking they got it when
[2:01:56] they don't he a lot of people do it
[2:01:59] because they've got some false
[2:02:00] impression of what they've seen other
[2:02:02] Christians do but he said Satan can't
[2:02:05] impersonate any of that we know that as
[2:02:08] missionaries you can see it impersonated
[2:02:10] shouting dancing speaking in tongues and
[2:02:12] all these things you can see it
[2:02:15] impersonated anywhere absolutely among
[2:02:17] the heathens and people who deny there
[2:02:20] is such a thing as Jesus Christ Christ
[2:02:22] being the Son of God and they do all
[2:02:24] those things themselves but notice but
[2:02:27] the real true quickening spirit that
[2:02:29] comes to a Believer quickens him to
[2:02:32] God's
[2:02:33] word that's back to Eagle food again it
[2:02:36] quickens us back to Eagle
[2:02:39] food right back to where he lives man
[2:02:43] shall not live by bread alone but by
[2:02:46] every word that proceedeth out of the
[2:02:48] mouth of God can you
[2:02:50] sayen he said see if it's the real holy
[2:02:54] spirit that a man has and not a m moery
[2:02:57] Holy Spirit it will manifest the promise
[2:03:00] of this hour that's right can you say
[2:03:03] amen amen see do we believe in dancing
[2:03:08] you bet we do do we believe in shouting
[2:03:10] you bet we
[2:03:11] do do we believe in the gifts you bet we
[2:03:16] do but when the quickening power came to
[2:03:19] us it quickened us to that word the
[2:03:24] word to where we know how the gifts work
[2:03:26] we know what we to look for we know what
[2:03:29] to you understand what I'm saying it

[2:03:37] glad for that amen you see a perfect
[2:03:40] Church operating perfect gifts not that
[2:03:43] that there ain't no problems in a church
[2:03:45] every church will have its
[2:03:47] problems Satan's all the time working in
[2:03:49] in one way and if people ain't matured
[2:03:53] enough they allow the devil to use them
[2:03:55] and this and this and this but when
[2:03:57] you're coming into
[2:03:59] [Music]

[2:04:21] don't have to go back back to
[2:04:22] Pentecostal age and work the gifts the
[2:04:24] way they used to work we don't have to
