just just blessed amen by their Ministry amen and they got a just fixed that Sanctuary up nice amen and just pray the Lord will just bless them abundantly brother Mark and his church and God will just pour out his blessings amen praise the Lord and before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to our Lord father as we approach the word father we realize how sacred it is and Lord we just come humbly before you asking for your help your inspiration Lord for without you we're nothing but if you would just come and anoint Lord and I pray not just anoint me but anoint the people Lord that we could be lifted up in Heavenly places and that your word could be effective at our heart father know how matter how simple no matter what it would be father your word could always have that effect if if it has its way and I pray Lord that it would be so today that you would meet the needs of your people the Believers father we just love you and we committed into your hands in Jesus Christ's name a man praise the Lord and it's good to have Dad and Mom here with us and we've certainly enjoyed their time haven't got to spend just a lot of time amen with them there but we've enjoyed the time we've had amen First Corinthians the fourth chapter says let a man so account of us as of the Ministers of Christ and stewards of the mystery of God amen you can have your seeds and um my subject today again is just Ministry and uh looking throughout history of the world time up to this day we see that there's all different kinds of Ministries within within Christendom itself we talked about how that Nations have their Ministries kingdoms and things but within Christendom uh there's different kinds of Ministries and and there's many reasons as to why they they exist different agendas different motives and and things but when we trace it all back uh to the the beginning we see that that there are only two sources that Ministry comes from and and you know usually when we think of ministry we think of the faithful Ministry but um I I think all of us are part of the ministry we we all have a Ministry and but there's only two sources that that Ministry comes from and that's either God or or Satan and so Ministry comes from these two sources and we know that not all Ministry comes from God um um we we look here at uh Second Corinthians 11 and 13 it says for such are false Apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ and no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of Light therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the Ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works so then this tells us that Satan has his ministers which are demons they and they're they're working for Satan's kingdom and uh we we've looked at it that you know Minister uh uh means it's it's one who gives Aid or service to that's what a minister is it's a representative of something an ambassador a spokesperson and so a minister is an agent that's what a minister would be uh just looking up the the different uh things that a minister is and ministers one that acts or exerts power that produces or is capable of producing an effect uh a means or instrument by which a guiding intelligence achieves a result a minister one who is authorized to act four or in the place of another so that this is what a minister is or an agent or or whatever it's one that acts or exerts power that produces or is capable of producing an effect a means or instrument by which a guiding intelligence achieves a result one who is authorized to act four or in the place of another and so when you look at it Paul the Apostle says that he was an ambassador and and I think all of us are ambassadors uh uh but he said that he was an ambassador of Christ and and and so uh everyone uh who is a minister um is an authorized uh uh representative or messenger I and I I think that's um uh we we we're part of something bigger than ourselves uh every father every mother every preacher singer musician every young person uh that is part of the body you you are a minister and so therefore you're a representative of of uh or a messenger uh because you are a minister and so uh uh Satan has his representative uh who they are anointed to carry out his plan and agenda uh thinking just of a scripture that Paul uh said there in Acts 13 and 7 and he's talking to this Sorcerer And he says you know um oh full of all subtleity and all Mischief thou child of the devil thou enemy of all righteousness without not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord and so this this man uh uh Jesus called or Paul would call him the child of the devil and he was an anointed to to to pervert the ways of the Lord and here Paul was an ambassador of Christ and and and and then this man comes and opposes uh uh the the the Ambassador for Christ and Paul just called it out and said you're working for the devil you you are trying to pervert the ways of God and so so this is what his anointing was was to pervert the right ways of the Lord you look at Paul in Galatians 1 and 6 saying to the Galatians there I Marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ and so this battle of of right and wrong it's it's always been there and and it and it comes through the ministry it comes through Ministry it it Satan wouldn't have any effect if if he didn't have his agents if he didn't have if he didn't have his ministry well God wouldn't be effective uh and and we'll go more into that but he he wouldn't be effective without his ministry amen uh he chose Ministry and so therefore uh Before Time began we all know it but there was a battle that raged a war and that was between God and Satan God established his his kingdom he he created his angels and and these things and and we know that that uh uh the Angels they have levels of positions and well as Satan was next to God as Lucifer he was the above all the angels all the Angels were under his command and and uh uh so he was he was in the position he was next to God and and of course he he wasn't happy being next to God in position and and he wasn't happy with what he he had he wanted to be God and he wanted to be worshiped as God all these other angels are worshiping God and and no one was there to worship him and he wanted he wanted worship he wanted a better Kingdom and so uh uh so he he he takes the reality of God's kingdom away uh uh from from the people uh he was jealous of Michael the prophet said the Archangel and so in his pride he rebelled and and uh he calls the third of the angels to join him and we know them as Fallen Angels or demons and and they are his ministers working to fulfill his purpose ain't that right amen so what is his purpose we know the scriptures very well that Isaiah 14 12 it says how art thou fallen from Heaven o Lucifer uh son of the morning and we know that that God kicked him out of heaven and and his place was upon the Earth he no longer had his position next to God and he was a fallen angel but he was a beautiful angel and and and so Thou Art fallen from Heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut to the ground which did US weak in the Nations for thou Hast said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God or sons of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high so so he just doesn't start out to set establish his own kingdom but he wants to be God he he so he's he's he sets out to be an impersonator is is really what he does and so we know now here on Earth that Paul would the the Ambassador for God uh uh he a representative there in second Thessalonians two and three he says let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that men of men of sin be revealed the son of perdition who upholdsth and exalteth himself above all that is called God ain't that right so so he's he's opposing and exalting himself above the very word of God for God is the word ain't that right and and so uh he opposes the exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God ain't that right I don't think that any any part of of ministry uh uh especially in this day when the the uncovering has has been uh the the veil has been lifted off that that we we do not recognize or cannot uh recognize the the power or the agenda of Satan uh uh I think every Minister uh uh should be capable and I believe God has has enabled Us in this age to recognize the power of Satan the agenda of Satan the working and and what what he is after ain't that rhyme so he is he he has sought all the way from you know before creation of man he has sought to establish himself as God to have a kingdom as God to be God to be worshiped as God and so and then his ministers uh uh uh they're they're working for this purpose and so Satan is able to establish his goal his agenda through perversion by perverting ain't that rhyme and and we know that his kingdom is established uh through perverting God's word he has perverted God's creation he has perverted the family that God God intended for family to be he has perverted the church the way God intended for the church to operate and to be he has perverted the minds of the people amen uh totally different than the way God has wanted man to be he has perverted the relationship between God and his people ain't that right it's all been a perversion of of Satan and and we know as the prophet said the lids come off of Hell in this age and and of course Satan has been able to to uh come to a Perfection of his his he not God's Eden his Eden and and we are living in Satan's Eden do you believe that amen we're living in his eating Eden and and we are the only ones as the people of God the ambassadors of God uh uh the ministry of God that that is stopping and hindering from from him coming into his completion uh complete thoughts and agenda and and these things we are the one and and so here's the struggle because he's he's almost come to a finale in in what he wants he's got the majority of the people worshiping him he's he's got it all he's in control of churches he's in control of homes he's in control of politics he's in control of Nations he's in control of people's lives people's minds and he's in control of the children he's in control of the wife the the husband he's in control of the ministers he's in control of just about any everything and there's a sliver of people that he cannot control and and so so the war is really raging because girls he has set out to do to defeat all of God's kingdom he is set out to destroy everything the purpose of God and so here we're standing in his way you understand what I'm saying so now the the prophet said the lived the lids come off of hell and I believe we can all say Amen to that right the streams of demon power is pouring from everywhere he said it's conquered the Nations it's conquered politics still it's rotten to the core it's conquered the churches until they know nothing but denomination so Satan has actually taken the worship from God and has put it upon himself now has he done that well materialistic things everybody say materialistic things have now become the object of worship they're inspired of the devil scientific things are now become the object of worship and it's nothing but an inspiration of the devil education is now the object of worship and it too is inspired of the devil ain't that right we've even gotten a perversion in in Christmas to where Santa Claus has taken the worship from Jesus Christ it's inspired of the devil ain't that right you see anything that takes the people's Faith away from God is of the devil anything that takes the people's dependency away from God is of the devil anything that takes the people's attention away from God and His word is of the devil anything that causes people not to understand or to not to hear God's word is of the devil ain't that right so actually through these things Satan has achieved his purpose and he has become the the object of worship through his achievements ain't that right amen that that's right amen people depend upon science uh more than they do God's word they depend upon medicine more than they do God's word ain't that right Amen brother Brown said it'll be a day that faith will be very slow faith will be more slow because we've got more hospitals we've got more uh uh uh achievements of man than than ever before to where God's word it seems to be dinosaur it's it's historic we've got all these modern days inventions of today you understand what I'm saying that it's hard for people just to take God at his word so then we can say that Satan has achieved his purpose he is behind education he is behind science he is behind a man the denominations he is behind all of these things I I say he's behind the sports I'd say he's behind the entertainment I say he's behind everything to where the people are finding more joy in in them things than they are the house of God the word of God the uh uh all of these things people become more loyal Amen to the worldly things and they do God and His word it's just that way look at more people that are tied tied down by materialistic things whether it be money pleasure uh uh jobs or or whatever they're more tied down to that and more and they trust that more for their future and security than they do the word of God so then we can understand that that that that that that Satan has actually become the object of worship through his achievements ain't that right yes sir so so brother Branham said his works are exalted above God's word and manifested work so God's word has come he has manifested his works but Satan's works are exalted above these Works ain't that right denominations that have been established amen by by the devil have become more uh exalted than God's word creed from the devil uh darkmas and traditions of men are inspired of the devil and they have become more exalted than God's Vindicated word ain't that right so brother Branham said see the wisdom of Satan is exalted to the throne of worship in man above the Vindicated word of God for the hour our churches prove that by their seminaries schools of learning that's learned more than God's word knows about it they think see see there Dr so and so and teacher so and so and Professor so and so has exalted their own knowledge so-called from Satan truth see above the Vindicated promise of God made clear right before them and men fall for it see his scientific achievements trying to prove God's word wrong just think of that it's just like like a one man claiming to be in the message still and and yet he is he has taken he is he has uh taken the um the picture of the seven angels and he has sent it off to the science uh scientific whatever for them to prove that that it was right to prove that what brother Branham said was was was true and and was right and he was telling you know brother Andrew and he says we need we need science to prove that it's right be so so we can convince the world that it's right well I don't need science to prove it Noah didn't have have proof a man by science that there was going to be a rain but it rained anyways amen and he ain't going to be guilty before God to say well I didn't have science proof you know I should have maybe had scientific proof to get more souls into the ark God didn't need scientific proof it wasn't up to Noah to Amen to have scientific proof it was just Noah up to Noah to be a minister of the word of God and priest that it's going to rain can you say amen amen proof we don't need proof amen but yet God would give us proof God gave us Vindication as to as to these things ain't that right amen but a Believer don't need proof amen he just believes ain't that right amen see so so we men fall for this and and and so uh Satan's scientific achievements trying to prove God's word wrong just think of that he his and that is the man's theology explains God's word to the people and makes it of no effect again so that's the kind of ministry that Satan has to make the word of God of no effect ain't that right see uh to the people see and like he had in the denominational age when Jesus appeared on the earth Jesus said you Hypocrites you by your tradition that's their interpretation has taken the word of God and made it of no effect to the people that's the same thing they've done today it doesn't have the effect ain't that right a man doing a lot of quote reading quote but he says they the people exalt him Satan above all that's called God he said doesn't uh second Thessalonians say they would do that the authority of a denominator National Church the people believing that denomination more than they believe God and God is the word ain't that right say believing these things more than we would believe God's word and then you know it's it's inspired of of of the the devil amen they'll believe their denominational Creed above the word which exalts him above all that's called God and there's only one God and that's the word see all that's called God so he as God sits in the Church of the god uh proven that he is God because he's got the people worshiping him God is the word and he exalts himself above all that's called God and there's only one God and that God is the word ain't that right and all that's called God is the God of this age has exalted himself above the true Vindicator word of God see above all that's called God so that he as God sits in the temple of God with authority notice what he says and look he is praised for it Satan is praised for it see through all of these things he's caused the people to look at something else instead of the word of God God help us ain't that right to uh uh to stay with that word of God to look at the word of God instead of looking the word of God is our comfort ain't that right the word of God is our comforter not not not not not not fishing trips not vacations not the preacher not your wife not your husband not your children not your parents the word of God is the comforter ain't that right and to find the Comfort outside of that is an inspiration that is coming from the Devil ain't that right so he's praised for it oh let the people God see that deception he has praised for it and solemnly believed by the people of this age now do you see the god in his servants of this evil age see so what's he doing he's making a better world a man for the people and this is what he's saying we're making a better world for the people see and totally ignoring the word of God that there is no better world except the Millennium there can be no better World there cannot be a perfect world as long as there's politics involved in this as long as there's sin and Corruption and and education is at the at the at its peak and and all of these things see so he said see he's lit he says he is making a better world for the people to live in by his knowledge apart from the never failing word of God so he says by his coming together denominational Creeds intellectual and scientific and so forth he is making a better world for Mandalay event and ignoring the promise of God ain't that right and what is that promise a millennium what is that promise a time of Peace what is that promise that Satan would be bound for a thousand years and we would be on a honeymoon can you imagine that there are people so gullible to to teach that we are living in a millennium right now it's inspired of the devil can you say that God never promised that amen politics would be in the millennium the Bible promised that we'd walk on the ashes of the wicked ain't that right and Satan would be bound by a chain of circumstance he'll have no power over you he can do nothing anymore it'll be on a honeymoon with our beloved ain't that right but it's an inspired of the devil to get people to believe look at it they're wanting a resurrection of America ain't that right it's an inspired their thoughts are inspired of the devil their prayers are inspired of the devil the Prophecies of America coming back is inspired of the devil amen what's he gotten he's got them looking for a better world a better future here right here in America when the people of God ought to be looking up Jesus said when you see these things begin to happen lift up your head your Redemption draweth now can you say Amen that's right see so so we find brother Brown said the people are ignorant of worshiping Satan but it's Satan impersonating himself as the church they worship Satan thinking they're worshiping God through the church but it's the way Satan has done it so Satan has been able to achieve his purpose through deception and and we know that he quotes scriptures but they are misplaced and misleading and that's exactly what he did to Eve and he fell for it ain't that right Amen brother Brown said see he quoted he quoted what God Said but he put a question mark to it now and I want to say this we as ministers I don't care if we're standing behind the pulpit or if we're ministering to our children or if we're fathers a man ruling and a headship over our homes you should never put a question to the word of God we're not sent to minister questions we are sent to give the answers to the people give answers I don't want you leaving with more questions I want you to leave with the answers and only God can give the answers ain't that right amen see so we want the answers not questions ain't that right that's the only way you'll be established in the faith a man is is to be established by the Revelation or the answer Amen to the questions that Satan throws at us ain't that right so so we find that he done the same thing to Jesus amen he put the question mark and he said it is written man shall not live by bread alone see right with the word quoting that word but taking him up then he tried to whitewash the word and make it some other way ain't that right but he fell for it but Jesus didn't fall for it and that's the saying today that there is a people that will not fall for it she never failed from the beginning you realize that you never fail in the beginning now brother Brown said it's that misconstruing that part of the scripture that applies to the day he'll let you know that all that Jesus did was perfectly well he'll let you know all that Moses did was perfectly well but when you take the promises that they gave for this day and then say that's applied to another age that's all he just has to do see is to get the people to believe it that way ain't that right so Satan has been able to accomplish these things uh uh through his ministry and I'd say his ministry amen now notice Acts 20 and 28 take heed therefore unto yourselves and do all the flock over uh the witch the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers talking to that that faithful Ministry to feed the Church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood for I know this that after my departing shall Grievous Woods enter in among you not sparing the flock also of your own cells shall men arrive I speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years I cease not to warn everyone night and day with tears ain't that right so this is the ministry uh that Satan had he started it amen in the beginning uh before the world uh before Man created or the creation of the the world I guess if you could say it that way but but he started to draw away from God draw the attention away from God get everything away from God unto himself and notice how it's carried out through all the ages God would send his agent in an age and and Satan would send his agent and and and and and and the word of God would be made known and and there would be uh uh uh Satan's Minister amen God's Minister would proclaim the word Satan's Minister would try to draw the people unto himself away see under perverse things ain't that right but there is a God ordained Ministry do you believe that there is a god-ordained Ministry it was established by God it it's the ministry of God Amen and that's what we are a part of I believe is that that it's the ministry of God and as I said last Sunday it was first implemented by God uh uh and in the beginning God laid the foundation for Ministry amen and and uh he established the direction for it and established its purpose and and the thing that God did establish a man for his ministry is that it would be a Supernatural Ministry it wouldn't be a carnal Ministry it would be a Supernatural Ministry it would be a Ministry of power a Ministry of Deliverance a Ministry of redemption a Ministry of Salvation a Ministry of healing a Ministry of reconciliation ain't that right and God would provide a man uh what was needed by the ministry ain't that right A Man by the way of ministry it's it's again the ministry of God why is it the ministry of God it's God moving it's God acting it's God working it's God's supplying it's a Supernatural Ministry ain't that right amen this is God's Ministry now a man see and so again Ministry is an agent or instrument a personal thing through which something is accomplished ain't that right so we could look at the first Ministry of uh of God and that would be the Holy Spirit ain't that right amen that's God's agent amen and and that brother Brandon says that many times that the holy spirit is God's agent ain't that right the Holy Spirit does not come to give uh funny feelings it's God's agent and when the Holy Spirit comes to you brother shalom it's for a purpose ain't that right well see so it's God's agent and and I I'm just giving you some definitions here but agent or agency means the capacity condition or state of acting uh or of exerting power ain't that right amen uh uh agent is is or agency is Operation amen a person or thing which through which power is exerted or an end is achieved ain't that right so oh my see so it's the capacity condition or state of acting or exerting power so we can see this this agent uh uh in the beginning a man Genesis 1 2 it says that the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep ain't that right so it was an impossible situation it was Bleak it was hopeless it was all these things but it says and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and what did it do as God's agent it it changed the situation as God's agent it transformed picture of bleakness to Beauty ain't that right yes sir see and then you find right after that and God said let there be light and there was what light how did he do that how did the light come through the agency of God and God's agent ain't that right amen see the Holy Spirit went into action to make sure God's word God's will was carried out amen God said let there be trees amen and the Holy Spirit began to brood over the Earth and here come the trees and God said let there be the the flowers and the Holy Spirit was sent and as God's agent now as in the ministry of God now we're talking about Ministry and he began to brood over the Earth and and up come the flowers and up come the bushes and up come uh the azaleas and and all of that and and then God wanted uh animal life an upcome of the birds and upcome this and that and and and and and all of these things and the prophet said it was because the Holy Spirit the anointed Christ a man was brooding over the Earth ain't that right amen see God's agent he's got an agency ain't that right so whatever God decreed the Holy Spirit brought it to pass amen that's why God's word will never fall to the ground he's got the right agency ain't that right amen and it's it's it's his own Spirit ain't that right so we can say and know beyond a shout of a doubt that God's word is effective do you believe that God's word is effective do you realize we've been amen we're looking at prophecy being fulfilled today that was spoken thousands and thousands of years amen and now it's being fulfilled why because God still has his agent on the scene amen and everything that God has said for this day is coming to pass it's the ministry that's right see so God said in in Zechariah 4 and 6 not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord I think we ought to depend more on the spirit of God than we have ever before ain't that right amen it's God's agent amen second Peter 1 25 or 121 for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but holy men of old amen spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost ain't that right amen see Jesus also promised amen that the spirit of Truth would come in this day he would come and he would lead us and guide us into all truth God still God is that same agent today the Holy Ghost is nothing old-fashioned it's not outdated and you say Amen now Satan's ministry will take us away from the Holy Ghost he'll get people to think and they got the Holy Ghost when they ain't really got it you ain't that right amen and so what he's doing he's doing it through Sensations he's doing it through feelings he's doing it through all of these things because I spoke in tongues I got the holy ghost that has nothing to do with Heaven the Holy Ghost ain't that right see but he's made way for him to come into the people and speak in tongues and they think they got God in all reality they're still living like a devil still acting like Hypocrites ain't that right can't follow the truth of God and all this so all the while claiming they got the Holy Ghost if Satan has become god of the age but see God established Ministry for the sole purpose that his will be accomplished now Church no other will is going to be accomplished hello every other will is going to be thwarted by God ain't that right amen but but and and and when I say that uh no no other will will be accomplished by the ministry of God the ministry of God is sent to accomplish the will of God ain't that right the will of man will be disappointed the will of Satan will be thwarted ain't that right amen but the will of God is going to be established by Ministry it's true and we know what the will of God is is the purpose of God and the will of God is the word of God so the purpose of God is right here in the word in written word ain't that right now this word purpose is setting something set up as an object or end to be obtained so God just didn't create the world and say look what I've done he created with purpose ain't that right he created the world he created this Earth then the prophet said he took you from the Earth ain't that right he made this Earth for your purpose he he made it all for you amen see at a greater purpose and so his whole purpose there's an end to his purpose there's a goal there there's an end and through his ministry he's going to obtain it Drew now according to Ephesians 3 and 11 it's an eternal purpose that's what Paul calls it an eternal purpose so it's a purpose that will not be defeated a purpose that will not be obtained it's an eternal purpose in order for this purpose to be implemented then there had to be a decree to go forth ain't that right amen it just didn't set in the mind of God Amen but now it was decreed a man and a word decree is an order usually having the force of law a fort ordaining wheel ain't that right so it was a decree God decreed his purpose amen and when when he decreed it it set it in motion because there's a force of law behind it man now the Bible tells us what this purpose is and we know it but there there was a a group of people select group of people that he put their names in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world now this means something because they everybody say they cannot be lost they cannot be left behind they cannot be or come up short they cannot be snatched from God's purpose and will ain't that right this group of people they were saved then when God put their name on the Lamb's Book of Life they were saved ain't that right they were called then they were glorified then when he put their name in the Lamb's Book of Life he completed their story he already wrote out their destiny ain't that right amen he put it all there yes sir see and it was all in God's thoughts they are secure ain't that right there's no way for them to be lost and if your part if your name is in the Lamb's Book of Life you cannot be lost I don't care how dark your trial is you cannot be lost I don't care how big your failure is you cannot be lost I don't care how bad of a person you were out in the world you can't be lost can you say Amen God's grace is greater than the sin God's grace is greater than the than the in in in capabilities God's grace God's strength God's Mercy is far outreaches amen the devil's grasp upon your life his grace is far stronger than Satan's hold upon you ain't that right see all in God's thoughts they are secure and they are the ones and the only ones who receive the Holy Ghost do you believe that amen now I know brother Brown said you can have the Holy Ghost upon your uh your cell your spirit amen but that's not receiving the Holy Ghost that's just something falling upon you the rain falls upon the just and the unjust anointed ain't that right but to receive the Holy Ghost Inside of You amen is to is to receive it in your soul and then the Holy Ghost will never leave you what God's agent will never leave you ain't ain't that right the ministry of God will never leave you that Ministry of God goes to work for you ain't that right and it can never be I see hearing you know uh uh a ministers uh the other the other day talking about his boys and said what he said one of my boys you know when his kid got the Holy Ghost and of course the the there's a really strange relationship right now between them and he says but he's you know uh he may have gotten the Holy Ghost but yeah uh yeah he's lost it you know he said you can have the Holy Ghost and lose it you know and he says the whole I mean then he says the Holy Ghost could be in you but you've still got to be in Christ and you know in other words you you can you can have the Holy Ghost and be lost you know and and I got thinking I thought no no no God take it back to the word ain't that right the Holy Ghost is our rest it's a security you'll never know that your name is on the Lamb's Book of Life till you get the Holy Ghost for the spirit itself Bears witness that we are the sons of God God's agent comes inside of you and begins to speak to your heart go on you are a son of God and it's God's Ministry ain't that right it's it's a resting place it's a seal and brother Brown said woe unto him that would try to break that seal can't do it and look at the Judgment that Satan's going to be come under that he's under that he's going to face a judgment trying to break that seal off of you now Ephesians 1 4 according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world brother Brown said that means that we were we were right there with him Christ in the mind and thoughts of God before the foundation of the world that gives an eternal quality to the elect can you say Amen God's choosing us in Christ before the foundation of the world gives an eternal quality to the elect [Music] there's a lot of things about us that are full of corruption that are temporary and and it comes and it goes Trials come they go uh uh Storms Come they go mind battles come they call health comes and goes and and all of these things but there is an eternal quality to those who have their name written in that Lamb's Book of Life and he says you can't get away from that you how many tried to run from it that you can't run from it how many thought it was the end but it ain't the end ain't that right you thought I'm going down for the last time but you're still here lifting up hands praising God saying Amen to the word of God and Satan had you out he is already counting the countdown amen it was on nine amen just another word 10 that something brought you back up it's an eternal quality that you yourself can't get away from Hallelujah that's right goes on he chose us with Christ that we should be holy Without Blame before him in love having predestinated unto us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will look at that he predestinated us unto the adoption this is the age of adoption you believe that everyone's looked for this time Joshua lived it out typed it out the Israel coming into the promised land typed it out amen but here we are the very thing that we have been predestinated for we are it this is the age according to the good pleasure of his will Jesus said in John 15 16 you've not chosen me but I have chosen you if you chose yourself then it's up to you to make it but if he chose us then he's got a Ministry that he's established an agent that he has established to take us through do you believe that he eternally secured you so the Bible says God knew the end from the beginning known unto God are all of his works from the beginning so he decreed the end from the beginning so it has to be everybody say it has to be it has to be it has to be God will not lose one of his own Jesus said all that the father has given me will will come aren't you glad it's written that way he didn't say all that the father have given me I'm praying will come all that the father have given me I hope will come he just said we'll come we'll come and he didn't give a certain situation or a criteria he just said they will come he showed it by a prostitute she was one of his and now I matter how low and degraded she was she came and no matter how holy and righteous that Pharisee was there was nothing there to pull him in look at that woman that had the seven demons but she was one of his and he showed that no matter what condition you're in you're going to come everyone that has had their name written in the Lamb's Book of Life Will Come is that right John 6 39 Jesus said and this is the Father's will which hath sent me that of all which he have given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last days now we we know through in the message uh who is this Melchizedek brother Brown gives the comparison of of of course he lets us know that Melchizedek was Jesus before he became flesh he was the word body ain't that right but he also gives a comparison of us in Melchizedek us and Jesus ain't that right thank God for a prophet he gives us the comparison and we were both predestinated Jesus was predestinated you're predestinated ain't that right but we find that that he was Melchizedek in a word body before he become flesh then you never brother Brown said you never hear of Melchizedek anymore because it was Jesus in flesh but after he went uh died what did he do he went to hell he returned in a theophany a word body ain't that right now notice what brother Brown says uh he says now if this Earthly body be dissolved this this Earthly body we have another one now notice how he says this we have bypassed that what did we bypass the word body ain't that right it doesn't mean that the word that he ordained us for would never come to pass [Music] it just meant we bypassed it hello we took on a body of sin we took up on a body that's frail we took on a body that's subject to the enemy subject to discouragement subject to to whatever we come into this world speaking lies we were condemned to begin with didn't have a chance in this body ain't that right so he said see we bypassed that to come straight from God the attribute to be flesh why to be tempted everybody say to be tempted and tested by sin like Adam did seeing that too often he bought him melchized it couldn't be tempted he couldn't be tried hello God had a take on a body like you and I that word body couldn't die well we didn't come into that word body we came from Straight From God from the attribute to flesh to be tempted and tested by sin like Adam did but when testing of his word is over oh then we are taken up to this body word body theophany we that was prepared for us before the foundation of the world you realize that God didn't they are crying trying to create a body for you it has been prepared before the foundation of the world why you was already finished in God's mind he saved you he called you he ordained you he justified you he already glorified you in his mind ain't that right but when you come into this old body you didn't reflect to anything of that word hello you reflected The Works of the devil perversion ain't that right that's why Prophet said teach it you don't have to teach a child to go right or wrong if you don't even teach that child right or wrong he'll go wrong he'll just automatically go wrong amen so he says see we are taken up to this body that was prepared for us before the foundation of the world it is the word there that we skipped to come right around down here to be tempted and tested if we'd have come to that if we would have come the way through through the the word body we wouldn't have had to be tempted we would have known Temptations we wouldn't have known all these things we had known all things can you say Amen see so that's the reason Jesus knowed all things because he was the word before he was flesh then we become the word I hope you understand you're becoming the word every day you're becoming the word you're becoming the word what do you mean word every thought that God had of you is now becoming made manifest in this whole body can you say amen that's right see hear hear everybody say here we are formed to the word image that's why man when God does a job he does it right that's why there's no such thing as you keep being a sinner a sinner sinner sinner in God's eyes when he saved you he called you he sealed you in in this time you'll no longer be a sinner again he never looks at you the same way brother Brown said he doesn't look at me as a sinner he sees me through his blood he can't see me he sees he hears my voice but he sees the blood when he looks at me he sees the blood can you say Amen isn't that wonderful amen see so here we are formed to the word image that's why brother Bram said you never did it in the first place a real justification takes place you never did it in the first place and you're coming back to what you were in the first place ain't that right see so he says see we are here we are formed here we are formed to the word image to be partaker of the word no longer I was looking at the word amen but now we're being partaker of the word the word is in US we become the word ain't that right see uh be partaker of the word feed on the word by being predestinated since the beginning you see that little spark of life that you had in you from the beginning when you started your journey many of you can remember it you join this church you join that church you try this that and nothing satisfied but one day you just recognized it can you say Amen what is it it's God's Ministry [Applause] oh my you see God is established a Ministry that you don't that that his purpose isn't doesn't go unfulfilled he established a Ministry to ensure that he doesn't lose one of his own amen now we'll go on here we I believe and we talked about a little bit of it last Sunday but I believe that the angels of God are part of the ministry of God they're ministering angels as I said last Sunday they're here to encourage you they're here to help you to protect you they're here to help you believe they're here to inspire you they're here to prepare your heart what would we do without such a Ministry Abraham goes and tells Eliezer go get a wife for my son Isaac tells him don't go outside of my Kinfolk don't go anywhere you go back where I come from back where I originated from and you find a wife and get her gorselleser knew how important that was he didn't know what to do you could imagine the responsibility that he had finding that right one now we know he found the right one right and we find out that Rebecca come to the well first of all Eliezer made that prayer let the damsel that comes and offers me a drink but not only me a drink but my camels let her be the one what a prayer but now brother Brown lets us know what really happened he says it must have been the angel of God that spoke to Rebecca's heart right he said now he told us that he must have got there a half hour earlier before Ellie's or got there and spoke to Rebecca's heart and said go get the water and Rebecca came to the Water of Life at the evening time you get the picture it's the church in these last days the evening time the evening lights are here it's time that the angel of the Lord in a Supernatural is revealing himself to the Rebecca of the Bride of Isaac and somehow or another she's moved to go to the Waters of life and you say Amen see so we we find a man that that that's how Rebecca got there it was the angel of the Lord that prodded her that spoke to her and told her to go God knew who she was Eliza didn't know but God knew just like brother Branham didn't know who was bride but God knows who's bride can you say Amen now the you you know good and well that the angel of the Lord showed brother Branham that his ministry was the type of Elysia um and how would we know what was really going on how could we understand brother branham's purpose how could we understand the purpose of the message of the hour how could we understand the real intent of what is really God's purpose except the angel of God came to us and told us to go come on now amen see he says see oh my my heart is turning for Joy she's moved to go to the Waters of life he said I can hardly preach when I think of that the evening time has come the angel of the Lord is in the message Goes Forth and Woos the Rebecca to come to the Waters of life it's the moving of the supernatural ain't that right we also look it was the angels of God that showed light upon the heel to God the Shepherds to the Eternal Light the prophet said here it was the King of Kings the Lord of glories was born in a manger as a little baby and you would have thought all the Christian world Amen would have recognized it and come talking to sing and rejoice about the their coming Messiah but not one person knew that they had that that he was on the earth at that time it took the angels of God hello Prophet said he was so secretly born that no one would have known that he was on the Earth but the Angels Came to the Shepherds bring in the announcement he is on the Earth ain't that right he says the Angels themselves were lights that showed with the word of God they had the word of God and told them today in the city of David in Bethlehem is born Christ the Savior the Angels had the word amen and the the word came by light to guide them and they followed the word of the angels to Eternal Light and they found the baby there wrapped in swaddling cloth as they the Angels had said can you say Amen see so there is a Ministry of angels how many times we would miss God and what he is doing on the earth if it hadn't been for the angels of God to bring an awareness of his presence different times the prophet of God would pray for God to send the angels in the service one place said may your angels of God take their position and place this positionally Out Among the People speaking to their hearts getting them to believe take away all unbelief another place made the great angels that roll away the stone on Easter morning may they stand present today to roll away every stone of Doubt every fear and every Discord another place let the Holy Spirit that's present the spirit of the word of God that made the promise may it Sanctified these efforts that we're putting forth that when these cloths are laid upon the people or the anointing all dropped upon the sick May immediately the angels of God stand near to minister them to them the blessings of the Covenant that Jesus Christ made with the sick the Holy Spirit another place he says takes the word of God right into every heart feed Every Soul on the Manna and while these people sitting there and the angels of God and can't about them notice Satan is sitting near them saying don't you do it don't you do it see and the angel is saying but this is your time father they had to make it a decision amen he had already made the altar call him people had raised their hands amen but he saw the battle that was raging in the in the audience there was the Demons of Satan the Ministers of Satan standing there telling the people don't raise your hand amen don't you give your heart to God you've got plenty of time young people amen don't you give away amen from your walk away from your denomination but then there was another Minister a angel of God that would stand there and say but it's your time it's your time raise your hand the mercy of God is with you can you say amen amen a minister can preach the word of God and I thank God that there's Angels Amen in this building today amen that'll sit here and minister to your heart and encourage you and tell you you can make it okay please amen the angel of God saying this is your time father they had to make a decision they had to do something about it they had to say yes Satan I'll go with you or God I'll take you that decision Still Remains with us can you say Amen and every one of us fights that's where the battles of our mind goes every one of us fights it every every negative Spirit every negative thought every negative thing comes from the Devil ain't that right and his his imps his ministers and they stand beside us and they try to get us to do wrong they try to get us to do whatever they try to just get us to disbelieve the word of God they try to get us to do what everybody else is doing and put exalt science and exalt achievements and exalt everything else above the word of God but there's also an angels of God that are encamped around every believer amen that'll tell you keep believing the word don't you listen to that negative amen you ain't going down you're going up amen you're not lost you are the bride of Christ amen there's something there that God ministers To Us by his angels notice Bill Graham says we realize that all positions stands close it's close isn't it Satan is Raging unbelief is trying to settle in on the people yet the angels are at their position they're standing ready even the either the black flags will wave or the white flags of heaven will wave in Victory can you say man either the black flags will wave over your life or the white flags of heaven will wave over your life in Victory can you say amen and what it is that you are your mind is the Battleground ain't that right amen you're the one that has the free moral agency to choose what you're going to listen to foreign amen you'll either listen to the devil you'll listen all that negative you'll give in to that devil act like it amen and he'll all he's doing is leading you away from the word of God oh yeah you can you can raise your hand say I go to church and oh bless God all that but if you ain't following the word of God what does it do if the word is no longer inspired to you amen what is he going to do amen you're following something that may be angels of God stand by every one of us to inspire that word and to keep it inspired in our hearts [Music] listen to the message today early this morning I couldn't go sleep I woke up about two couldn't sleep I find just decide to listen to a message and I Graham at the closing of the sermon he told him he says see as many of you thinking you're lost paraphrasing he asked him he said how many wants to go in a rapture apparently the people raise their hand he says see that just tells you right there you're not lost you're not Eternal lost because there's something in you still calling for you come up the moment you say you quit it's over it's done and there's nothing there to draw you anymore that's when you're in bad shape but May the angels of God keep ministering the word to us can you say man amen see the Bible tells us that the angels of God are with the believer they are always there the prophet said and they never leave they are always there they never leave ain't that right Amen in speaking of Moses going down to Egypt brother Branham said he didn't have any Warriors any no chariots to back him up as far as the world knew amen see he was alone God's asking him to do a a job that was totally impossible and he asked every one of us to do that same thing amen many times you're doing the will of God as his Minister and you're standing alone how many's ever felt that where you're just standing alone we hear God Amen he didn't give him a supply him with an Army in the natural he didn't Supply him with Brothers to say Moses you can do it let's go I got you back he didn't Supply him with nothing he was there with a crooked stick his wife and child on the cow on the on the mule and he was there a one-man Invasion amen but the prophet said see he didn't have any Warriors No chariots to back him up as far as the world knew see but he had come face to face with god with an experience who had the armored of Angels the armored angels of all the eternities to stand by so then then Moses was not alone was he Amen to the Natural he looked alone Amen in the natural he looked like he was standing and it was out by himself and it was hopeless it was a hopeless case amen but he knew by a supernatural experience with God that God would have him Ministry of angels amen and they were all around him amen how else did the plagues come it was angels that made that happen how else was the water turned to blood there was an angel that made that happen it wasn't now Moses a man standing there it was God's Ministry of angels making every word of Moses come to pass Hallelujah that's right he said as Moses went down with his wife straddled on a little mule along Whiskers Whiskers hanging down he said I believe that Ten Thousand Times Ten thousands of angels rode along down those dusted robes with him Hallelujah you know they're in Acts 7 35 it tells us that God sent Moses to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush can you say Amen now there are people that don't believe in angels they don't believe in the ministry of angels especially since the Holy Ghost has come ain't that right but angels are real and they are everyone at God's command do you believe that they are at God's command what was it then that caused the flood Amen brother Branham asked the question what was it that broke up The Fountains of the deep he said it was the angel of God called wormwood amen he's the one that angel has control of all of all the Waters of all the fountains and God would put that angel as a minister here was his servant preaching with no Vindication Amen to a proof to the people but he was preaching what had been a revelation to him that God was going to send a flood it was impossible amen for Noah to bring on a flood but he preached it anyways he was dependent upon the Supernatural and God Amen would send the ministry of an angel that would come in a supernatural way amen and break up The Fountains of the diva and sin the flood just as Moses or Noah had declared it would happen there's a lot of things that's been declared by the church that's we've declared it's going to happen how is the rapture going to take place how's the changing of our bodies going to happen how are we going to be caught up we preached it we've ministered we've labored but you know what brother Raymond talked about them UFOs that'd keep appearing one appeared the other day and caught on the news the real brand and the world don't know what they are they said they'll be there and disappear just like that how the clear blue and it's been a a phenomenon they it's a mystery to them that they they don't know and it's got the world scared but God would send a prophet that would tell us don't you worry about them them are angels they're investigating angels and he said one of these days they're coming to take us home amen I know how the Rapture is coming I know how it's going to be there's a Ministry of angels there is a supernatural power them angels that are with us today amen that are watching over you that are watching looking at the sin and the filth of this world they've got the power Amen to raise you up amen and you say man you love him so I thank God for the ministry of angels some teach that we because we have the Holy Ghost God doesn't use them but we find out after the day of Pentecost that Angels appeared to people it was the angel of the Lord that loosed the shackles off of Peter while he was in prison and open the door so he could walk out of prison is the Angel of the Lord that that that made them guard sleep so well that they couldn't hear what was going on can you say man it was the angel of the Lord that spake unto Philip amen and told him to arise and go a certain place or go a certain direction as he went he met the the the uh Ethiopian amen and and talk to him about the Lord baptized him it was the angel of the Lord that done that why it was a Ministry of angels Philip didn't know about that Ethiopian but God knew about that Ethiopian can you say man it was the angel of the Lord that told Peter of Cornelius ain't that right amen the Bible tells us that Cornelius received a warning from God by an Holy Angel to send for Peter amen so is the Angel of the Lord that got him together Peter would have never accepted Cornelius or anything him being a gentile but God would send an angel to forewarn him that that man needed his his ministry that he was not to reject Cornelius but he would follow was to follow and preach the gospel to him and as he preached the gospel every one of them were filled with the Holy Ghost it was the ministry of an Angel in Acts 27 22 Paul there he was said I go Bound in Jerusalem or go bound uh well he was being taken to Rome I think it was to be tried there they were on the ship you all know the story then the Storm come they've been there for many days the ship are rocking it was starting to sink they were throwing things out of the ship that wasn't helping ain't that right amen the dark clouds could you imagine being in the in the ocean in all them waves huge ways and it was collapsing the ship amen but here in Acts 27 22 Paul says I exhort you he's talking about every seller he wasn't even a sailor but he was talking to the captain he was talking to him all I exhort you to be of good cheer in the middle of the storm when it was all Bleak Bros Sam and no no no chance of hope they were all going to drown but here was a man standing there and saying but be of good cheer amen for there shall not be no loss of any man's life among you but of this ship for there stood by me this night the angel of God oh my I'm so glad that the angels of God still come to us Amen in the very trials when we look like it ain't going to happen and it looks like we're going to be destroyed it looks like Satan's going to have his way and be able to carry out his thread the angel of God begins to tell us it ain't going to happen Don't Be Afraid don't be a feared amen don't worry be at rest for you're going to make it can you say man amen have you heard that speak to your heart amen as as in and it may be days and it may be months it may be years of long trial amen but there's something that's inside of you that says it's going to be all right something's going to happen amen George coming in the morning well this is where Paul was he could stand there and declare the word of the Lord by an Angel thank you that is true for there stood by me this night the angel of God whose I am and whom I serve saying fear not Paul thou must be brought before Caesar and lo God hath given thee all them that sell with thee can you say Amen so see it's the ministry of angels that come to make sure that God's word don't fail he says and remember with the Bible here before me is it true that this power is given only for healing see I pray for the people they go away and if they believe they get well if that faith that prayer is said for that person and if they believe it watch if that if if that if that faith that prayer is said for that person and if they believe it the angels of God will watch over that person they have to get well maybe not that hour maybe not that week maybe not that month it may be six weeks before they get well or what before their well but they will get well they've got to get well can you say man why there's a Ministry of angels you're not alone think of that now when you come to a prayer line and when you get prayed for amen and it's a prayer Faith it's a faith that has responded to that prayer and you begin to thank God Amen all of a sudden the Angels stand to attention and they are given charge over you hello they're given charge by God to watch over you and they're with you every day of your life they are with you to make sure you get your healing [Applause] and we don't believe in the worship of angels but we believe in the ministry of angels brother Brown said if you don't believe angels are ministering Spirits sent from the presence of God then you don't know your Bible God has actually got angels of healing brother Graham said that he has commissioned can you say man God has angels of healing Commission you say the what was that on the brass serpent amen that the people could look and live it was the angel of God upon that serpent that brass serpent what was what was upon that water that caused them water that the people that got in them Waters when they were troubled amen received their healing he said it wasn't the waters that was just something natural amen it was the angel of God that would come upon the Water can you say Amen oh church amen the angel of the Lord and it was the supernatural moving upon the natural amen and I'm so glad it still works today brother Brown said I'm not God's Gift the angel is God's gift it come out of Heaven I came from the earth he came down from heaven to enshroud or to enclose an Earthly vessel to speak to Earthly people amen that you would believe on him not on me can you say Amen we're not worshiping the seventh angel we're not worshiping a man we're not feeding off of a man we're feeding off the unfailing body where word of the son of man that was sent to us by an Angel amen you're not believing on a man but he said believe on him not on me but on him what I'm talking of and by doing so God will heal you oh do you love him amen if the musicians will come Hallelujah I'm so glad for the ministry that God has set and established to carry out his purpose his will amen isn't the Lord wonderful to think what's holding back the powers the winds what's holding back the Four Winds the Bible talks about the Four Winds brother Brandon said wins mean War and what was it the second World War first World War it almost become a whole destruction of the world everything was going on so strong but there was a promise in the word that said to the Four Winds holds them Angels hold them back ain't that right Brahm so that was fulfilled in the first World War no one knows what stopped it no one knows what happened but he told us what was happening there was angels that was holding him back now you think of that why because there's some people that had to be sealed [Music] there was a message that had to come to give rapturing Faith to a people ain't that right I love the Lord power in the name of Jesus we've got the power in the name of the Lord though Satan rages we will not be defeated we've got the power
