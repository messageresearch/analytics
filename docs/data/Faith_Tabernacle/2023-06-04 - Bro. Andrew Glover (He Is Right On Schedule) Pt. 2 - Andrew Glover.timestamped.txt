[48:27] The Book of Matthew the 11th chapter we

[48:32] and also we'll be looking at the book of
[48:34] Psalms the 27th chapter and we want to

[49:01] morning and we sure sure love and
[49:03] appreciate each and every one of you
[49:05] here today
[49:06] and we want to look here in the Book of
[49:07] Matthew the 11th chapter
[49:09] and in the first verse Matthew 11
[49:13] I want to continue maybe speaking a
[49:15] little bit on what we spoke to you last
[49:16] time about he's right on schedule
[49:18] and here in Matthew 11 and verse 1.
[49:22] Bible says it came to pass
[49:24] when Jesus had made an end of commanding
[49:26] his 12 disciples that he departed fence
[49:29] to teach and to preach in their cities
[49:31] now when John had heard in the prison
[49:33] The Works of Christ he sent two of his
[49:36] disciples and said unto him art thou he
[49:39] that should come or do he look for
[49:41] another
[49:42] and Jesus answered and said unto them go
[49:46] and show John again these things which
[49:47] you do hear and see the blind receive
[49:50] their sight the lame walk the lepers are
[49:53] cleansed the death here the dead are
[49:55] raised up and the poor have the gospel
[49:58] preached to them
[49:59] and blessed is he
[50:01] whosoever shall not be offended in me
[50:05] now John is in a very good place to be
[50:09] offended he's in prison but Jesus speaks
[50:12] what brother Brahm called The Forgotten
[50:13] be attitude and said but blessed is he
[50:16] whosoever shall not be offended in me
[50:19] now let's turn back to the Book of
[50:21] Psalms the 27th chapter
[50:23] in Psalms 27
[50:26] I want to look in two verses there I
[50:29] know you'll be very familiar with these
[50:31] scriptures being that brother Branham
[50:33] uses this for his text in the rapture
[50:36] in Psalms 27
[50:39] and verse
[50:41] number five David here writing he says
[50:45] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[50:49] me in his Pavilion
[50:50] in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he
[50:54] hide me he shall set me up on a rock now
[50:57] we know that Iraq is a revelation so he
[51:00] shall set me upon a revelation upon a
[51:03] rock and now shall my head be lifted up
[51:06] above my enemies round about me and
[51:08] therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle
[51:11] sacrifices of Joy I will sing yea I will
[51:15] sing praises unto the Lord amen I
[51:18] believe that's what we've been doing
[51:19] this morning amen is offering sacrifices
[51:22] of Joy unto him as the Lord add the
[51:24] blessing to the reading of his word is
[51:25] you can have your seats here this
[51:27] morning
[51:28] I want to by the help of the Lord for
[51:30] just a few moments I want to if I can to
[51:33] speak to you here and if I tell this
[51:34] sermon this morning again I want to
[51:36] speak to you on he is right on schedule
[51:38] but I want to pull a little thought out
[51:41] of that of he's here uh he is here he's
[51:44] right on schedule amen he's here now we
[51:47] found that a schedule is in a range or
[51:50] plan an event to take place at a
[51:52] particular time so if you got a schedule
[51:54] then you're working for a particular
[51:56] time you're trying to achieve something
[51:58] at a particular time and we found that
[52:00] God is our God who is Jehovah and that
[52:03] he is an on time God he is an end time
[52:06] God every time amen he's on time in time
[52:10] every time I how many witnesses have we
[52:12] got here this morning he's on time he's
[52:14] in time every time there's not one time
[52:17] that God is late he's on time in time
[52:19] every time and we found the product of
[52:22] God said there in the junction God is
[52:23] always on time sometimes we're a little
[52:25] bit later thinking a little different
[52:27] but that's always done for a purpose see
[52:29] but God is always on time with his
[52:32] message and so today I believe that
[52:34] we're facing a great something that the
[52:36] church should know and understand and we
[52:38] ought to know all this is about we find
[52:40] it in God's word
[52:42] he said for I believe that if it isn't
[52:44] in the word then I'm just a little bit
[52:46] doubtful of it if it isn't in the word
[52:48] I'm just a little bit doubtful of it now
[52:51] why would a prophet be doubtful of it if
[52:53] it isn't in the word because the word is
[52:55] God's schedule God's schedule is his
[52:58] word his word is his schedule so if it's
[53:00] not in his schedule then I'm a little
[53:02] bit doubtful of it but if God's word
[53:04] speaks of it then no matter how
[53:06] indifferent it might seem to our custom
[53:07] of teaching it's God working out his
[53:10] word it's God working out his schedule
[53:12] many times it's contrary to our way of
[53:15] thinking or maybe the way we've been
[53:17] taught to think amen but we have to
[53:19] recognize the omnipotence of God when it
[53:23] is performed before us amen it does not
[53:25] matter what you've been taught it does
[53:27] not matter the way you think things
[53:29] ought to be or the custom that you think
[53:31] they ought to be done in if it's
[53:32] contrary to God's word then we are as
[53:35] children of the word under obligation
[53:37] Amen to deny our thoughts and to believe
[53:40] the report of the Lord and to recognize
[53:42] the omnipotence of God when it is
[53:45] performed before us again in the meanest
[53:47] man I know I'm so glad that there is one
[53:49] on time and that's God and his message
[53:52] it's always on time amen do you realize
[53:55] you're living in a day and time where
[53:57] you're listening to tapes amen that
[53:59] we're preached 50 and 60 years ago but
[54:02] you hear him today and it is as if
[54:04] they're being preached right here right
[54:06] now in the season you're living do you
[54:08] know why amen because our God is a god
[54:11] who's always on time in time every time
[54:14] amen when he spoke about Asylum law amen
[54:17] there was no such thing then but go
[54:18] today unto your Courthouse books and the
[54:21] sodomites are now protected by Allah see
[54:23] because this is not a message of
[54:25] happenstance it's not a message of
[54:28] chance it is a message of precision it
[54:31] is a message of Direction it is a
[54:33] message of God being on time end time
[54:35] every time now
[54:36] Matthew 11. amen we found there that
[54:39] John amen had found himself in the
[54:41] prison and the reason he was in the
[54:43] prison amen was because of his ministry
[54:45] So what had happened was he went from
[54:47] the Wilderness amen eating his meat with
[54:49] the locusts and the Honey to the jail
[54:50] and the problem of God said his eagle or
[54:53] prophetic eye had got filmed over and
[54:55] the reason it got filmed over amen was
[54:57] because of his habitation change so when
[55:00] he was in the wilderness there was no
[55:02] film over his eye when he was running
[55:03] the woods and enjoying the things of
[55:06] nature there was no film in that
[55:07] prophetic eye but the minute he was put
[55:09] in prison amen the prophetic eye become
[55:12] filmed over and when John got his
[55:14] prophetic eye filmed over he got
[55:16] offended and he sent two disciples to
[55:18] ask Jesus two questions are you he that
[55:21] should come or do we look for another
[55:23] and what he was doing he was doing that
[55:25] out of a spirit of offense right he was
[55:27] offended that God hadn't kept his word
[55:29] amen and when John said the worst thing
[55:32] he could say about Jesus amen that's
[55:34] where we closed last time Jesus turned
[55:36] around concept the greatest thing about
[55:38] John I I don't know about you here this
[55:40] morning but that just Thrills my heart
[55:42] amen that when John said the worst thing
[55:44] brother Bob that he could ever say about
[55:46] Jesus Jesus turned around and set the
[55:49] greatest thing about John it struck me
[55:51] of the day that Jesus did not wait till
[55:54] he got report back amen that John had
[55:57] apologized that John had thought well
[55:59] I'm wrong I'm sorry amen but because he
[56:02] is a sovereign God Amen who loves you
[56:04] regardless of the things you're going
[56:06] through he did not wait for John to
[56:08] apologize he did not wait for John to
[56:11] send two disciples back and say I still
[56:13] believe amen but he turned around and
[56:15] displayed a Divine attribute and I
[56:18] believe that there's a bride on the
[56:19] Earth today who has been offended she's
[56:22] been hurt she's been ridiculed she's
[56:24] been criticized everything she's done
[56:26] everything she's tried to do amen
[56:28] there's always a critical devil Amen to
[56:31] criticize her but she has not let her
[56:33] offenses amen film her eyes over to the
[56:36] point she's quit believing the timely
[56:39] message amen that God is centered I want
[56:41] to put that devil on notice you can
[56:43] offend us you can criticize this you can
[56:45] ridicule us you can persecute us but
[56:48] you'll never stop us amen amen you can
[56:50] say things about us you can tell lies on
[56:52] us amen but shall never back us off with
[56:54] the promises of God Amen because we're
[56:57] not here amen moving by the feelings and
[56:59] The Sensation and the way things are
[57:01] going but we're moving by let's saith
[57:03] the Lord and thus saith the Lord is
[57:05] there's a messiah amen there's an
[57:07] invincible Army there's a bride on the
[57:09] earth who is moving by the grace of God
[57:11] listen I'm not offended this morning
[57:14] amen I want to say thank you Lord I want
[57:16] to say thank you for working things out
[57:18] when I did not see a way out you made a
[57:21] way amen when I didn't see the way amen
[57:24] you was away when I couldn't lift my
[57:26] hands you was a lifter up in my hands
[57:29] when my head was sunk down between my
[57:31] legs and I couldn't even look at the
[57:33] promises you were the lifter of my hand
[57:35] but
[57:39] you love me when I'm bad you love me
[57:41] when things are going good you love me
[57:43] when things are going bad amen because
[57:45] he's God
[57:47] well I feel like I preaching this
[57:49] morning he's God and he's not controlled
[57:52] by the way you're feeling I'm on Church
[57:54] there's been times since you've come in
[57:56] here and didn't feel like God loved you
[57:58] and it was the greatest blessing you
[58:00] ever got there was times you come in
[58:02] here and felt like the spirit of God was
[58:04] a million miles away from you and you
[58:07] felt the greatest anointing amen you'd
[58:09] ever felt you know why amen because
[58:11] you're not being accepted amen based
[58:14] upon what you've done you're not being
[58:15] accepted based on how many books you've
[58:17] read how many prayers you prayed how
[58:19] many songs you sung how many sermons you
[58:22] preached you're being accepted upon the
[58:24] provision of the shed blood of Jesus
[58:26] Christ and if the blood work by sin amen
[58:29] the blood works this morning amen and if
[58:32] your life is under the blood you got a
[58:34] right to raise your hands if your life
[58:36] is under the blood you got a right to
[58:38] say Amen if your life is under the blood
[58:41] when the Holy Ghost comes in the
[58:43] building and you begin to feel the
[58:44] refreshing from the presence of God you
[58:47] got a right to stand and say devil get
[58:49] out of my way you'll try to stop me try
[58:52] to block me but here I am amen because
[58:55] the blood has covered my life
[58:57] oh yeah amen when you've said the worst
[59:00] things when you felt the worst when it's
[59:02] been the worst days sometimes that's
[59:04] when you get the greatest blessings
[59:06] here
[59:07] I don't know about you but that makes me
[59:09] want to shout amen that when John said
[59:12] the worst thing about Jesus Jesus turned
[59:15] around and said the greatest thing about
[59:16] John now in that message the forgotten
[59:18] the attitude brother remember says here
[59:20] in this row I want to pull our thought
[59:21] from this morning he said but when
[59:23] trouble set in can we say that together
[59:24] when trouble set in
[59:26] when trouble set in amen Jesus come and
[59:29] showed the Messiah that he was the
[59:31] Messiah amen but then something went
[59:33] wrong amen John had introduced the
[59:36] Messiah with the fan in his hand Amen to
[59:39] burn up the chath but he found out the
[59:41] works of Jesus that he was Meek and he
[59:43] was lowly amen so it worried him he
[59:46] didn't know what to say he thought now
[59:48] there's something wrong here somewhere
[59:50] now watch this John thoughts there was
[59:53] something wrong somewhere it seemed he
[59:56] had believed the wrong thing it seemed
[59:58] like it wasn't working right and there's
[1:00:00] many times that we think too that it
[1:00:02] isn't working right amen but it's
[1:00:04] working right there's many times that we
[1:00:07] think it isn't working right amen but
[1:00:09] it's working around listen I don't have
[1:00:11] nothing fancy to give you this morning I
[1:00:12] just got a little thought on my heart

[1:00:16] amen I know amen you might not be seeing
[1:00:18] lights and you might not be seeing fire
[1:00:20] but listen to the words of a prophet
[1:00:22] when it doesn't seem like it's working
[1:00:24] right it is working right when and it
[1:00:27] doesn't seem like it's going the way it
[1:00:29] should go it is going the way amen
[1:00:31] because as long as we know that he's
[1:00:34] here amen then what difference does it
[1:00:36] make as long as we know he's here then
[1:00:39] what difference does it make as long as
[1:00:42] we know that he Jesus Christ the son of

[1:01:11] last week amen but as long as he is here
[1:01:14] amen what difference does it make amen
[1:01:16] because if he is here then there's a
[1:01:18] possibility for a change amen if he is
[1:01:21] here there's a possibility for the
[1:01:23] situation a man that is plaguing your
[1:01:25] spirit to change come on church I've
[1:01:27] been in meetings and seen people sitting
[1:01:29] there depressed and discouraged amen but
[1:01:31] just start preaching on the never
[1:01:33] failing presence of Jesus Christ and
[1:01:35] watch a liberty drop upon their lives

[1:01:54] working right well Glory somebody out of
[1:01:57] shout he's here as long as he's here
[1:02:00] it's working right maybe it ain't
[1:02:02] working according the way we think it
[1:02:04] ought to work but it's working according
[1:02:06] to the way God wants it to work there's
[1:02:09] a big difference brother Terry in the
[1:02:11] way we want it to work and the way God
[1:02:13] wants it to work if it's not working
[1:02:15] according to the way we want it to work
[1:02:17] we'll get discouraged
[1:02:19] if it's not working according to the way

[1:02:27] difference does it make amen if he's

[1:02:36] forget amen as long as John was in the

[1:03:10] happen amen the very now listen amen if

[1:05:33] question mark over the budget there's a
[1:05:35] question mark over the debts here I mean

[1:05:51] mark amen hanging over religion now can
[1:05:53] I preach amen you know why that is amen
[1:05:56] because trouble sets in they
[1:05:59] identity when
[1:06:00] 's her way they forget who they're
[1:06:02] serving and the father God said see what
[1:06:04] it is is it's actually Satan has a
[1:06:07] gospel did you all know that Satan has a
[1:06:09] gospel he said and Satan's gospel is the
[1:06:12] gospel of science Amen in progress he
[1:06:15] said he preached it in Eden not God
[1:06:17] Satan did amen the science of progress
[1:06:20] he said now he preached in the who to
[1:06:22] Adam's bride and she fell for it see he
[1:06:25] deceived her into questioning one of
[1:06:28] God's words she should have never
[1:06:30] stopped Amen to question the word of God
[1:06:32] but when trouble set in amen it moved
[1:06:35] her back from her identity and she began
[1:06:37] to question well maybe God maybe it is
[1:06:40] okay if we partake of that fruit amen
[1:06:42] maybe it is okay but you see what
[1:06:44] happened when trouble set in amen she
[1:06:46] forgot who is there with her when
[1:06:48] trouble set in she forgot her headship
[1:06:50] when trouble set in she forgot that as
[1:06:53] long as she stayed underneath the word
[1:06:55] she was fortified amen from the power of
[1:06:57] the enemy but the men in trouble set in
[1:07:00] and she began to question this and
[1:07:02] question that hey question this amen now
[1:07:04] watch what happened here through the
[1:07:05] entire human race into chaos because she
[1:07:08] questioned God's word you know what I
[1:07:10] want to tell you tonight or this morning
[1:07:12] don't you ever question amen the word of
[1:07:14] God and the place that God has taught
[1:07:16] you amen come on now I'm going to preach
[1:07:19] to you because as long as nothing is
[1:07:22] going wrong we're too blessed to be
[1:07:23] stressed we're too anointed to be
[1:07:25] disappointed we're too pleased to be out
[1:07:28] of place I mean we're shouting and
[1:07:29] dancing we're eating breakfast with the
[1:07:31] angels having lunch with Gabriel and
[1:07:33] drinking coffee with wormwood I mean
[1:07:35] everything is so Heavenly but the minute
[1:07:37] trouble comes in we'll start saying well
[1:07:40] maybe I'm out of the will of God and
[1:07:41] maybe I shouldn't be but let me tell you
[1:07:44] what that is that's a devil that's
[1:07:45] trying to move you from a place of
[1:07:47] assurance amen into a place of question
[1:07:49] because if he can get your foot off of
[1:07:52] the rock of the Revelation and get it on
[1:07:54] some slippery Stone of some situation
[1:07:56] amen you will lose your identity as a
[1:07:59] warrior amen but I come here this
[1:08:01] morning to declare war on
[1:08:03] hate and say we will not lose her
[1:08:05] identity
[1:08:07] sure you want to and When the Smoke
[1:08:10] Clears and the best sandals we will
[1:08:12] still be the Victorious bride of Jesus
[1:08:15] Christ troubles not going to change it
[1:08:17] disappointment's just not going to
[1:08:19] change it we know who we are
[1:08:23] therefore we refuse to give in to the
[1:08:26] devil's questioning on who we are amen
[1:08:28] you know what Satan does he tries to
[1:08:29] move people he tries to move people from
[1:08:32] belief to disbelief and the way he does
[1:08:34] it is by questioning we find out here
[1:08:36] that the devil tries to make the people
[1:08:38] disbelieved he said he was trying to get
[1:08:40] John to disbelieve he was the Messiah
[1:08:43] amen now when John was in jail you know
[1:08:45] the prophet said amen Jesus never sent
[1:08:47] him literature on how to be happy in
[1:08:49] jail you know what he said just stay
[1:08:51] until this afternoon's meeting stay till
[1:08:54] it's over then you can leave after that
[1:08:56] amen and just watch this afternoon's
[1:08:58] meeting he said and all of a sudden they
[1:09:00] begin to see and Jesus said go tell the
[1:09:03] disciples or go tell John rather that
[1:09:05] the lame walk the blind see the death
[1:09:07] here and all that comes to the meeting
[1:09:09] is poor the Poor People's got the gospel
[1:09:12] preach them and tell John not to be
[1:09:15] scared he's in trouble but go tell him
[1:09:17] not to be scared amen and not to think
[1:09:20] anything different are you hearing me
[1:09:22] amen and I'm right on schedule you go
[1:09:25] tell John I don't care how moldy the
[1:09:27] bread is I don't care how dark so damn I
[1:09:30] don't care how dark but damn wet prison
[1:09:32] is don't
[1:09:35] think nothing else amen I'm right on
[1:09:37] schedule everything's running right
[1:09:39] everything's all right amen go tell him
[1:09:41] there's a healing service going on Amen
[1:09:43] go tell him the power of God is moving
[1:09:45] among them amen and tell him I'm right
[1:09:47] on schedule and don't pay attention to
[1:09:50] anything else so what was Jesus saying
[1:09:53] I'm here and tell him to focus on my
[1:09:56] presence amen don't pay attention to
[1:09:59] anything don't pay attention to the
[1:10:00] cards don't pay attention to the moldy
[1:10:02] prayer come on I'm preaching to you amen
[1:10:05] don't pay attention to what the other
[1:10:06] prisoners are saying you just remember
[1:10:09] I'm right on schedule you just remember
[1:10:11] amen and get out of that jail time amen
[1:10:14] the lame Walk The Barn see the death
[1:10:16] here and the gospel is preached to the
[1:10:18] poor amen now what I want to say to you
[1:10:20] this morning is amen is there's
[1:10:22] different types of prisons and then but
[1:10:24] this prison that John was in amen it was
[1:10:27] a prison of offense amen and you see he
[1:10:29] was offended amen because things did not
[1:10:32] turn out amen the way he thought or we
[1:10:34] get offended when it don't turn out the
[1:10:36] way we think it all to go amen but
[1:10:38] remember this our thoughts are not God's
[1:10:40] thoughts Isaiah said my thoughts amen
[1:10:43] are not your faults and neither are your
[1:10:45] ways my ways saith the Lord for as the
[1:10:48] heavens are higher than the earth so are
[1:10:50] my ways higher than your ways
[1:10:53] and my thoughts are higher than your
[1:10:56] thoughts remember said John Paul well
[1:10:58] now I introduced him as a messiah amen
[1:11:00] and here he is meek and lowly amen but I
[1:11:02] wanna I wanna say thank God for a
[1:11:04] prophet amen who could tell us why that
[1:11:06] John was offended he said John was
[1:11:08] looking for something that it wasn't
[1:11:10] time for yet amen it did not mean it
[1:11:13] wasn't going to happen it just meant it
[1:11:16] wasn't the time or the season for it yet
[1:11:19] but remember said in modern Adventure
[1:11:20] made clear about prophecy he said see
[1:11:22] John said all his fans in his hand he'll
[1:11:25] thoroughly Purge his floor he said now
[1:11:27] he fought the Millennium would start
[1:11:29] right then he thought the grain was
[1:11:31] ready but it had to die and go into the
[1:11:34] stalk amen and come up again to make the
[1:11:36] true ride so then there is a connection
[1:11:38] Brother Sam amen between John and prison
[1:11:41] and offended amen and the Bride of Jesus
[1:11:44] Christ amen John was looking for
[1:11:46] something amen that you was going to be
[1:11:48] a part of the Fulfillment of he was
[1:11:50] looking amen for the full grain for the
[1:11:53] full week for the full time but in the
[1:11:55] end time was when that was prophesied to
[1:11:57] take place amen so what happened John
[1:11:59] got dismayed just like we get dismayed
[1:12:01] he said here the other day I see so many
[1:12:03] people they come in and say well brother
[1:12:05] Branham I was prayed for I really didn't
[1:12:07] get any different well there's something
[1:12:08] wrong no there's not can I preach to you
[1:12:11] this morning there's nothing wrong with
[1:12:13] the system there's nothing wrong with
[1:12:15] God there's nothing wrong with the Bible
[1:12:17] there's nothing wrong with the Holy
[1:12:19] the thing of it is something is wrong
[1:12:21] with you oh well now we're getting down
[1:12:25] to preaching material are we amen
[1:12:26] there's nothing wrong with the Bible
[1:12:28] nothing wrong with the spirit nothing
[1:12:30] wrong with God's word the thing that's
[1:12:32] wrong is there's something wrong with us
[1:12:34] but it's a whole lot easier to blame the
[1:12:37] Bible it's a whole lot easier to blame
[1:12:39] the spirit it's a whole lot easier to
[1:12:41] blame the pastor it's a whole lot easier
[1:12:43] sister chain Amen to blame our friends
[1:12:45] and to blame amen but when the rubber
[1:12:47] hits the road amen what's wrong is
[1:12:50] something with hush
[1:12:51] now John we know amen the product God
[1:12:54] said he was more brother said he was
[1:12:56] more offended at Jesus and Jesus has
[1:12:58] been more off into death than any person
[1:12:59] ever lived on earth he said now watch
[1:13:01] don't be offended no matter what takes
[1:13:03] place everything's working right on
[1:13:05] schedule so you just go ahead and
[1:13:07] believe it so Jesus's instructions to
[1:13:10] John was you just go ahead and believe
[1:13:13] everything's all right now amen as I'm
[1:13:15] moving into this time of trouble you
[1:13:17] know that the Bible says in Daniel 12
[1:13:19] amen that there shall be a time of
[1:13:21] trouble such as never was since there
[1:13:23] was a nation even to that same time in
[1:13:26] the sixth seagull brother man picks it
[1:13:27] up and says now compare exactly amen
[1:13:31] what Jesus said in Matthew 24 with
[1:13:33] Daniel 12 and see there shall be a time
[1:13:36] of trouble that's never been since there
[1:13:38] was a nation see look at the six seal
[1:13:41] the same thing it's a time of trouble
[1:13:43] how many can agree that we're living in
[1:13:46] a time of trouble and in the time of
[1:13:48] trouble is when questions begin to arise
[1:13:51] amen in Psalms 27 verse 5 David said for
[1:13:54] in the time of trouble he shall hide me
[1:13:57] in his Pavilion in the secret of his
[1:13:59] Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set
[1:14:02] me upon a rock look at this word trouble
[1:14:04] it means bad evil disagreeable malignant
[1:14:07] unpleasant evil given pain unhappiness
[1:14:10] and misery in general it is of persons
[1:14:13] of thought amen so in the time of
[1:14:16] painful misery amen displeasant thoughts
[1:14:19] amen he shall hide me in the secret of
[1:14:22] his Pavilion in the secret of this
[1:14:24] Tabernacle David says in Psalms 37 39
[1:14:27] amen but the salvation of the
[1:14:29] righteousness is of the Lord amen he is
[1:14:32] their strength in the time of trouble
[1:14:34] amen I want to say this to your friends
[1:14:36] the time of trouble does not separate
[1:14:39] you from the presence of God Amen
[1:14:41] trouble does not separate you amen from
[1:14:44] the strength of God Amen disappointments
[1:14:46] and bad days and evil days and evil
[1:14:48] faults amen does not separate you from
[1:14:51] the strength of God to bring you through
[1:14:53] the evil days Amen in the church age
[1:14:55] book he said it is in the midst of a
[1:14:58] time of great trouble that Jesus comes
[1:15:00] don't you love that Sister Kim it's in
[1:15:02] the midst of a time of great trouble
[1:15:04] that Jesus comes in the message
[1:15:06] expectation he said the peoples of all
[1:15:09] religion seems to have something within
[1:15:11] them that calls for someone who has
[1:15:14] created them to help him in a time of
[1:15:17] trouble
[1:15:18] now that's a mouthful it seems that
[1:15:21] people have something within them that
[1:15:23] calls for someone who has created them
[1:15:26] to help them in a time of trouble when a
[1:15:29] baby gets in trouble who is he looking
[1:15:31] for he's looking for Mama come on church
[1:15:34] amen and when this church gets in
[1:15:36] trouble we're not looking for the
[1:15:38] Baptist to help us we're not looking for
[1:15:40] the Pentecostal to help we're looking
[1:15:42] for our creator who is God to come on
[1:15:45] the scene and to help us in the time of
[1:15:47] trouble now I want to say this to you
[1:15:49] you may not like this but let me preach
[1:15:51] it to you the time of trouble is a
[1:15:53] special time
[1:15:55] the time of trouble is a special time
[1:15:58] it's a preacher how can you put trouble
[1:15:59] time and special time together what
[1:16:02] David said in Psalms 46 verse 1 God is
[1:16:05] our refuge and our strength he is a very
[1:16:07] present help in trouble amen he is a
[1:16:11] very present help in trouble he said
[1:16:13] therefore will not we fear will the
[1:16:16] earth be removed and though the
[1:16:17] mountains be carried into the midst of
[1:16:19] the sea though the waters thereof Roar
[1:16:22] and be troubled though the mountains
[1:16:24] shake with the swelling thereof amen can
[1:16:26] I can I drop something to you the time
[1:16:29] of trouble is the time of his presence
[1:16:31] the time of trouble is the time of his
[1:16:35] presence amen without the trouble you
[1:16:38] would not know he's a very present help
[1:16:40] in the time of trouble amen but because
[1:16:42] there's trouble it means there's the
[1:16:44] presence of God well glory to God Amen
[1:16:47] can I prove it to you the part of God
[1:16:49] said the other day he said brother
[1:16:50] brother Richard Blair sitting here he
[1:16:52] said he work and helping a man wire a
[1:16:55] trailer or something he said they
[1:16:56] reverse something and however it run the
[1:16:58] current and they're working on this
[1:17:00] trailer and it runs the current into the
[1:17:02] water where a little boy was he said the
[1:17:04] man that the trailer belonged to his
[1:17:06] little boy and just a little lad and it
[1:17:08] killed the boy so they're working on the
[1:17:09] trailer crossed the wires the boy in the
[1:17:12] water feels the current and it kills him
[1:17:13] he said now watch that's what happens he
[1:17:16] said the electrical shock he said his
[1:17:18] little eyes set out and his teeth went
[1:17:19] together it alarmed them so bad he said
[1:17:22] but Brother Bear remembered wherever two
[1:17:25] or three are gathered in my name there I
[1:17:27] am in their midst amen the father
[1:17:29] skinned his fingers trying to get his
[1:17:31] fingers in the little boy's mouth to
[1:17:33] break it open they knelt down and
[1:17:35] started praying over little boy and he
[1:17:36] come back to life again amen make
[1:17:39] meltdown started praying for him and he
[1:17:42] come back to life again he said was that
[1:17:44] true brother Blair oh yeah he said now
[1:17:46] what happened he said we are living in
[1:17:48] the divine presence of the great
[1:17:50] glorious Heavenly Father it was a time
[1:17:53] of trouble brother Terry amen I was
[1:18:00] there that were ever two or three are
[1:18:01] gathered together in my name there am I
[1:18:04] in their midst and when they remember
[1:18:05] that they prayed for the boy and the
[1:18:08] dead boy come back to life and the
[1:18:10] brother said yes when anything happens
[1:18:12] remember you are children of the Living
[1:18:14] God
[1:18:16] when anything happens you remember you
[1:18:19] are the children of the Living God and
[1:18:22] wherever two or three are gathered in my
[1:18:23] name there I am and again it is written
[1:18:26] he is a very present help in time of
[1:18:29] trouble and if there ever was a trouble
[1:18:31] was that little boy laying their dad on
[1:18:33] the ground from a shark that went
[1:18:35] through him so we're thanking God this

[1:20:54] present help
[1:20:57] if he's here then everything's okay if
[1:21:00] he's not here we ought to be worried if
[1:21:02] he's not here we ought to be looking for
[1:21:04] an alternative plan to overcome but
[1:21:06] because he's here we ought to lift up
[1:21:08] our hands because he's here we ought to
[1:21:11] sing a sacrifice of Joy because he's
[1:21:13] here we ought to get our hearts off of
[1:21:16] the Ala trees and start praising The God
[1:21:19] Who Never Fails Us in the midst of

[1:23:16] low and he can still speak back to his
[1:23:19] children when they call on his name
[1:23:21] yeah he's a prison help in the time of
[1:23:24] trouble you say preacher you don't know
[1:23:26] what you're talking about I do know what
[1:23:27] I'm talking about hey man I'm not
[1:23:29] preaching the empty sermon I'm preaching
[1:23:31] from my heart it's had to preach through
[1:23:33] trouble but I'm a witness for rock will
[1:23:35] help you I've had to preach to let downs
[1:23:37] and disappointments and people lying to
[1:23:39] you and saying all kinds of things about
[1:23:41] you amen but I never got my eyes on them
[1:23:44] I kept my eyes on the Rock who was a
[1:23:47] very present help in the time of trouble
[1:23:49] and he never failed me he never left me
[1:23:52] he never forsook me he never forgot me
[1:23:55] so for him I will give him praise for
[1:23:57] him I will bless his name
[1:24:00] brother Bill when he comes Among Us I'm
[1:24:03] gonna recognize him as The Rock because
[1:24:06] it's his presence with us in the time of
[1:24:09] trouble yes sir you say preacher it's a
[1:24:11] time of trouble it is but it's also a
[1:24:13] time of full restoration
[1:24:15] it's a time of trouble but it's also a
[1:24:18] time of the full restoration can
[1:24:21] somebody say fourth
[1:24:23] fourth it's not two it's not three it's
[1:24:25] four we've come through justification
[1:24:28] we've come through sanctification we've
[1:24:30] come to the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:32] and we have now come to the fourth light
[1:24:34] we've now come to the fourth stage the
[1:24:37] Holy Ghost itself remember said remember
[1:24:39] Christ is risen from the dead and is
[1:24:41] Among Us
[1:24:43] the very present help in the time of
[1:24:46] trouble has risen from the dead and is
[1:24:49] Among Us get that in your mind see
[1:24:51] Christ has raised from the dead and
[1:24:54] seen all kinds of great moves shouting
[1:24:57] praising God and that's all fine he said
[1:24:59] we spoke in tongues prophesied we've
[1:25:01] seen all that that's fine comes right
[1:25:02] along with it but remember the last
[1:25:04] thing is his divine presence the word
[1:25:07] itself he is the word and the head the
[1:25:12] word it's coming to the body I'm on
[1:25:14] Church why is the head coming to the
[1:25:16] body because the body is going to find
[1:25:18] itself in the time of trouble but the
[1:25:21] only thing that can get it out is the
[1:25:23] headship of the word which is God
[1:25:25] himself the word in Hebrews 4 is a
[1:25:28] Sharps more powerful than a two-edged
[1:25:30] sword it is a discerner of the thoughts
[1:25:33] and intents of the heart he said now run
[1:25:35] that through the scriptures and you will
[1:25:37] see he's known as the Messiah it's not
[1:25:39] some man here is the Messiah it's the
[1:25:42] holy spirit it's the Messiah amen Christ
[1:25:44] and the Holy Spirit is the same thing so
[1:25:47] here it is now just working in the flesh
[1:25:50] getting the body ready for Rapture and
[1:25:52] Grace amen believe it friends amen amen
[1:25:56] the very presence of God the divine
[1:25:58] presence has returned to the church amen
[1:26:01] in a season of rapture now as I said to
[1:26:03] you brother REM takes his text from
[1:26:05] psalms 27 and calls it the background
[1:26:08] for the Rapture and what this background
[1:26:10] mean brother Sean it means a setting in
[1:26:13] which an event takes place what is a
[1:26:15] schedule a schedule is a plan or a
[1:26:18] calendar to arrange an event to take
[1:26:20] place at a specific time hell glory to
[1:26:23] God I feel like preaching right now amen
[1:26:25] amen God's schedule had it right on time
[1:26:28] when a prophet stood and preached the
[1:26:30] Rapture in Yuma Arizona and you know
[1:26:32] what he said he called The Rapture the
[1:26:35] greatest event among church amen the
[1:26:38] schedule is about an event amen
[1:26:40] ascending is about an event and what is
[1:26:42] that event it's the second coming of the
[1:26:44] lord it's the change of your body
[1:26:46] brother during we are not looking behind
[1:26:49] us we're looking in front of us amen the
[1:26:52] best is not behind us church amen the
[1:26:54] best is in front of us
[1:26:57] he said I truly believe we're now near
[1:26:59] the great event the greatest event that
[1:27:01] ever did happen or Ever Could Happen is
[1:27:03] just near it's being made manifest now
[1:27:06] that is his coming amen his coming is
[1:27:09] the greatest event and it's just near
[1:27:11] being made manifest now I love this and
[1:27:14] the gospel by the way he said Jesus in
[1:27:16] the light of Calvary just a few hours
[1:27:18] before he was crucified he spoke more of
[1:27:21] his second coming that he did in his
[1:27:23] crucifixion so it must be a great thing
[1:27:26] that lies just ahead in the prophet like
[1:27:29] unto Moses he said my purpose to fulfill
[1:27:31] amen is to is to unite the body of Jesus
[1:27:35] Christ together what was he uniting the
[1:27:37] body together for for the last thing
[1:27:40] which was the divine presence the word
[1:27:42] itself to come to the body he said
[1:27:45] that's what's in my heart is to see all
[1:27:48] of God's children in one Accord with one
[1:27:50] heart moving on then I believe when that
[1:27:52] takes place that the work will be about
[1:27:55] over amen the millennium setting him the
[1:27:58] Rapture will come we're certainly
[1:27:59] praying and watching and waiting for
[1:28:01] that time he said we're looking forward
[1:28:03] to the greatest events I'm going to say
[1:28:05] the greatest event
[1:28:06] the greatest event
[1:28:08] ever happened in all human history or
[1:28:11] every wheel is the second coming of our
[1:28:14] Lord Jesus Christ the son of God Amen to
[1:28:17] take amen her him her to himself he said
[1:28:20] see even nature itself is calling for
[1:28:23] that day it's all waiting and grown him
[1:28:25] for that day of perfection when our lord
[1:28:28] Jesus shall come and perfect everything
[1:28:30] that's imperfected amen watch his
[1:28:33] friends when he comes amen The Tempest
[1:28:35] power is broken when he comes death has
[1:28:38] lost its power well I'm preaching to you
[1:28:40] this morning amen those that have died
[1:28:42] along the road down to the Third Watch
[1:28:44] first second third fourth fifth sixth
[1:28:46] Amen to the seventh watch died they were
[1:28:48] waiting for this come on Church they
[1:28:50] were away amen John was in prison
[1:28:52] because he was looking for this
[1:28:55] I'm preaching to you amen John was in
[1:28:58] prison cause he was looking for what was
[1:29:00] he looking for he was looking for the
[1:29:02] week to come to maturity he was looking
[1:29:04] for the Lord to take the fan in his hand
[1:29:06] and thoroughly Purge the floor he was
[1:29:08] believing the Millennium was coming he
[1:29:10] was believing that the Christ would set
[1:29:12] up on the throne but it was in the
[1:29:13] future but come on Church you're in line
[1:29:16] for it this morning amen you're not as
[1:29:18] far away from it as John was amen come
[1:29:21] on church between John and now there
[1:29:23] were seven Gentile dispensational ages
[1:29:25] amen but right here this morning your
[1:29:27] next step could be the Millennium right
[1:29:29] here this morning your next step could
[1:29:32] be a theophany right here this morning
[1:29:34] your next step could be a glorified body
[1:29:36] you know why amen because the head has
[1:29:39] come to the word and the word body has
[1:29:42] received the presence of God Alone
[1:29:44] church we might be in trouble but we're
[1:29:46] in position to change our bodies we
[1:29:49] might have situations and
[1:29:50] disappointments and trouble might be
[1:29:52] sitting in on every hand but lift up
[1:29:54] your head he is a very present hell in
[1:29:57] the time of trouble when Trouble Comes
[1:30:00] is when Jesus comes when trouble Falls
[1:30:02] is when Jesus ascends because he's a God
[1:30:05] who will take the word to himself
[1:30:08] foreign
[1:30:09] I feel like praising him this morning we
[1:30:12] may be in trouble but we're on our way
[1:30:14] out of here
[1:30:16] Sean that's shouting ground right there
[1:30:18] we may have all kinds of trouble but
[1:30:21] we're on our way out of here
[1:30:24] our next step our next step
[1:30:28] could be out of time into eternity what
[1:30:32] are you saying preacher I'm saying death
[1:30:34] cannot hinder them from enjoying it come
[1:30:36] on Church death cannot hinder them from
[1:30:39] enjoyment because the Trump of God shall
[1:30:41] sound and it will and the dead in Christ
[1:30:44] shall rise first oh what a glorious time
[1:30:47] we're living come on church I'm talking
[1:30:50] to you about God's schedule three things
[1:30:52] on the schedule a shout a voice and a
[1:30:55] trumpet do you realize this shout has
[1:30:58] already taken place if you're looking
[1:31:01] for the shout you're in the prison this
[1:31:03] morning saying is this it or do we look
[1:31:05] for another but if you recognize this is
[1:31:07] the shout then you can say this day this
[1:31:10] scripture is fulfilled if you can
[1:31:12] recognize it the voice of Resurrection
[1:31:14] is in the bride you can say this day
[1:31:16] this scripture is fulfilled and if you
[1:31:19] can recognize that just as the trumpet
[1:31:21] gathers Israel there will be a trumpet
[1:31:23] that will give this ride you can lift up
[1:31:25] your hands in the middle of trouble and
[1:31:28] say Church he's here he's here the shot
[1:31:32] is here the voice is here the headship
[1:31:35] is here the power is here the anointing
[1:31:38] is here the ability is here the strength
[1:31:40] is here I know troubles here but he is
[1:31:43] here so what difference does it make as
[1:31:46] long as he's here
[1:31:47] as long as he's here I say come on
[1:31:50] trouble but he's here already I say come
[1:31:53] on disappointments but you got here too
[1:31:55] late
[1:31:56] because before trouble got here he was
[1:31:59] already here before sickness got here he
[1:32:02] was already here and when there is no
[1:32:04] more sickness and there is no more
[1:32:06] trouble he will still be
[1:32:08] [Music]
[1:32:09] he's here he's here somebody shouted

[1:34:55] presence well what am I going to preach

[1:40:51] Dimensions it's the hour of the season
[1:40:53] of change the Rapture is upon us the
[1:40:56] body changes upon us we got to get out
[1:40:58] of here friends I know troubles on us
[1:41:01] but his presence is wholeness too
[1:41:03] [Music]
[1:41:05] brother Matthew I feel like I feel like
[1:41:07] running right now I know troubles all
[1:41:09] around this but his presence is here too
[1:41:11] and if he's here it's all right
[1:41:15] oh yeah
[1:41:17] if he's here it's all right does God
[1:41:20] keep his word God always keeps his word
[1:41:24] I was listening to a tape this morning
[1:41:25] brother y'all forgive me sometimes you
[1:41:28] get downstairs you listen to tape I
[1:41:31] forgot to take my everybody out this
[1:41:32] morning but I tell you this Herbert
[1:41:34] didn't say this morning he said listen
[1:41:35] he said you're wondering how this ain't
[1:41:37] gonna happen he said how's that black
[1:41:39] hair going to come back he said How's
[1:41:41] him loved one's going to appear he said
[1:41:43] he will see to it
[1:41:45] you know when I said Amen brother
[1:41:48] Branham he will seek to that I don't
[1:41:51] have to figure it out I don't have to
[1:41:53] work it out I just have to put my faith
[1:41:55] and confidence in the presence of God
[1:41:57] now what are you saying I'm saying this
[1:41:59] amen that the ministry I know I've been
[1:42:01] all over the place forgive me that I
[1:42:03] pray something's coming to you amen I
[1:42:05] say this the ministry of John the
[1:42:07] Baptist and the ministry William ran
[1:42:09] them but we're both ministries of
[1:42:11] introducing and Forerunner which
[1:42:12] actually what happens is when you have
[1:42:15] those kind of powerful Ministries
[1:42:16] there's more room for offenses
[1:42:19] when you have such a powerful commission
[1:42:22] there's more room for misunderstandings
[1:42:24] like like if somebody gets up and they
[1:42:26] say God's called me to pray for the sick
[1:42:28] okay God bless you go on your way we'll
[1:42:30] be with you we pray for you God there's
[1:42:32] no but somebody get him to say now God
[1:42:34] has told me that there will be a sign in
[1:42:35] my hand
[1:42:38] and I'll take the person's hand and I'll
[1:42:40] be able to tell them the type of disease
[1:42:42] they have
[1:42:43] and then it'll come I'll know the
[1:42:44] secrets of their heart and then they'll
[1:42:46] be a greater Ministry than that now
[1:42:48] There Brother Sam has just come the room
[1:42:51] for all kinds of misunderstandings and
[1:42:54] what happens is is when
[1:42:55] misunderstandings take place it puts
[1:42:58] people in prisons now you all know it's
[1:43:00] in the message but everyone said like
[1:43:01] this he said there I was had that dream
[1:43:03] they come to me tell me about that dream
[1:43:04] he said and in the dream all these
[1:43:06] people was behind bars right he said
[1:43:08] Behind These Bars now we know the quote
[1:43:10] by heart brother Branson House of Hell
[1:43:13] give way to the name of Jesus we know it
[1:43:14] we quoted we preach it it's a powerful
[1:43:16] quote but if you actually look at what
[1:43:18] led up to that it actually makes it more
[1:43:20] powerful then people wasn't was behind
[1:43:22] bars and the pawn to God so they were
[1:43:24] asking him open the bars let us out of
[1:43:27] here he said now brother by Adam he said
[1:43:29] come help us deliver these people he
[1:43:31] said when I got to hold the bars he said
[1:43:33] they were too thick for me I couldn't
[1:43:35] break them he said and I asked him I
[1:43:37] said what's going on and the Lord spoke
[1:43:39] back and said brother Branham these
[1:43:41] people are in these jails because they
[1:43:43] misunderstood you
[1:43:45] oh so now they're in the jail because
[1:43:48] they misunderstood a prophet and that's
[1:43:50] when they said he speaks and says House
[1:43:52] of Hell give way to the name of Jesus so
[1:43:55] actually what misunderstandings can do
[1:43:57] is they can turn situations into houses
[1:44:00] of hell
[1:44:02] now if I can have some Liberty I'll
[1:44:04] preach it to you a misunderstanding will
[1:44:07] actually turn a situation into a house
[1:44:09] of hell and it'll put the people in
[1:44:11] prayer oh come on Amen it's it's now now
[1:44:13] we're humans and there's going to be
[1:44:15] misunderstandings but the difference is
[1:44:17] how do you handle the misunderstanding
[1:44:20] come on now come on Church there's going
[1:44:23] to be times that somebody's going to do
[1:44:25] something and you misunderstand them
[1:44:29] uh and as the battery's going dead is it
[1:44:31] still working
[1:44:32] and we got an amen tape back there Judah
[1:44:36] we're humans so there's going to be
[1:44:39] misunderstandings
[1:44:41] you're not perfect I'm not perfect I'm
[1:44:43] going to say things sometimes and you're
[1:44:45] going to miss and brother Sean's going
[1:44:47] to act a certain way and you're going to
[1:44:49] misunderstand sister Jane she make walk
[1:44:51] by you and she didn't mean it amen but
[1:44:54] maybe she just didn't see yourself and
[1:44:55] she walked on well sister Jane don't
[1:44:57] like me and maybe brother Kevin got up
[1:44:59] to play the guitar and while he was
[1:45:01] playing he looked right at you and then
[1:45:02] he looked over at brother Jr well
[1:45:04] brother Kevin and brother Jr got
[1:45:05] something against me
[1:45:07] come on now y'all know I'm preaching
[1:45:09] amen amen it's true misunderstandings
[1:45:12] and how do we handle them how come I've
[1:45:14] been in meetings before and I've seen
[1:45:16] people wear their offenses on their face
[1:45:18] I've seen people get up amen certain
[1:45:21] song Be Sung they didn't like it so they
[1:45:23] I was in a church one time they held a
[1:45:25] silent protest to the whole service I
[1:45:26] thought that don't make you look
[1:45:28] spiritual it makes you look dumb because
[1:45:31] I've been in meetings and I didn't like
[1:45:32] certain songs but you know what nobody
[1:45:34] else knew I did you didn't know I didn't
[1:45:36] like it till just now you know why
[1:45:38] because I didn't wear the offense
[1:45:41] well preach somebody think I believe I
[1:45:43] will amen amen I've been in situations
[1:45:46] and been offended and nobody knew I was
[1:45:48] offended you know why because I've
[1:45:50] learned how to get through it without
[1:45:51] letting it get in me
[1:45:53] come on Church well we might as well
[1:45:57] preach so they misunderstood a prophet
[1:45:59] and the only one that could help him was
[1:46:02] the one they misunderstood now there's
[1:46:04] the key the only one that could break
[1:46:07] the bars was they go to the one they
[1:46:09] misunderstood if I've offended you and
[1:46:12] you misunderstood me Brother Sam ain't
[1:46:14] gonna help you out of the prison if
[1:46:16] brother Doug is offending me amen going
[1:46:18] there brother Terry it's not going to
[1:46:20] help him out of the prison we gotta go
[1:46:22] to the source of the misunderstanding
[1:46:24] and let the power of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:46:26] breaks the bars before it turns into a
[1:46:28] house of hell but in case there is any
[1:46:31] houses of hell here I come here to speak
[1:46:33] the name of Jesus against him and say a
[1:46:35] house of Hell give way to the name of
[1:46:38] Jesus let every misunderstanding come
[1:46:41] subject to the name of Jesus Christ
[1:46:44] now when there's a little commission
[1:46:46] there's not much room for
[1:46:47] misunderstanding when there's a big
[1:46:49] commission there's a lot of room and a
[1:46:51] prophet received a big commission when
[1:46:53] he said as John the Baptist was sent to
[1:46:56] Forum the first coming of Christ you'll
[1:46:58] have a message that'll forerun the
[1:47:00] second coming across do you realize that
[1:47:02] was in 1933 Brother Sam a hundred what
[1:47:05] is this 100 years later how long
[1:47:07] somebody help me 1933 2003 no how many
[1:47:12] 93 years and people still confused over
[1:47:15] that voice
[1:47:18] is this okay brother Sean 93 years and
[1:47:22] they're still confused over the voice of
[1:47:24] the Ohio River you know why because some
[1:47:26] misunderstood it program said what
[1:47:28] happened he said when that light
[1:47:30] appeared he said some ran he said but
[1:47:33] those that stayed hurt I'm preaching he
[1:47:36] said when the light appeared some ran
[1:47:38] and those that ran never heard but those
[1:47:41] who stayed amen they heard the voice so
[1:47:44] there were two reports of what's
[1:47:45] happening there were those who stayed
[1:47:48] and there were those who ran and those
[1:47:50] who ran tried to act like they knew more
[1:47:52] than those who stayed but the ones who
[1:47:54] stayed didn't get it second-handed they
[1:47:56] got it firsthand and there is a bride in
[1:47:59] the last days who is not running from
[1:48:02] the presence of God she is running into
[1:48:04] the presence of God so if there's any
[1:48:06] question about something that happens in
[1:48:08] the presence quit Consulting a
[1:48:10] psychologist or an intellectual educated
[1:48:13] preacher to explain what took place in
[1:48:15] the presence of God you go to the
[1:48:17] presence itself hi
[1:48:19] is that okay I know we may be bottoming
[1:48:23] out here but we'll bottom out and get
[1:48:24] through it ain't the first time are you
[1:48:26] hearing me there's going to be
[1:48:27] misunderstandings there's going to be
[1:48:29] offenses there's going to be things
[1:48:31] happen but you got to remember your
[1:48:33] mission you've got to remember your
[1:48:35] commission program should my mission I
[1:48:37] believe to the Earth is to what is to
[1:48:39] forerun the coming word see the coming
[1:48:42] word which is Christ and Christ has the
[1:48:44] Millennium in him now I'm gonna I'm
[1:48:46] gonna tie this together real quick
[1:48:47] because we're on the verge of the second
[1:48:50] coming of Christ and people right now
[1:48:52] are allowing questions amen criticisms
[1:48:55] to take the preem and it's in their
[1:48:57] thinking
[1:48:58] now come on we're all guilty but it's
[1:49:02] not actually something the Bible didn't
[1:49:03] speak of the Bible said no in this verse
[1:49:06] there shall come somebody said there
[1:49:07] shall come there shall come in the last
[1:49:10] days scoffers which are walking after
[1:49:13] their own lust and what are they saying
[1:49:15] they're not saying an exclamation this
[1:49:19] is the promise of his coming they're
[1:49:20] saying where is the promise of his
[1:49:22] coming for since the fathers fell asleep
[1:49:25] all things continue as they were from
[1:49:28] the beginning of the creation so they're
[1:49:30] actually saying amen where is the
[1:49:32] promise of his coming in other words you
[1:49:34] know what scoffers are whether Terry
[1:49:36] scoffers are mockers and the part of God
[1:49:38] said Spirits don't die he said Spirits
[1:49:41] only change bodies so it's the same
[1:49:44] Spirit but it's a different body amen
[1:49:46] and the spirit of the scoffers will come
[1:49:48] and here's what they'll say brother
[1:49:50] Matthew they'll say nothing is happening
[1:49:53] but can I say this just because you
[1:49:56] don't see something don't mean
[1:49:58] something's not happening
[1:50:00] now if you're building a house and you
[1:50:02] drive by that house brother Jr every day
[1:50:04] you look over one day they're pouring
[1:50:06] Footers one day they're raising walls
[1:50:07] one day they're putting a roof amen you
[1:50:09] can see stuff outside and you can say
[1:50:11] man alive they're making progress over
[1:50:14] there buddy I mean they're working away
[1:50:16] amen they're getting something done
[1:50:18] well I'm preaching myself right into
[1:50:20] something I'll get out of it amen I'm
[1:50:22] not a crazy man amen they're getting
[1:50:24] something done over there man I'll tell
[1:50:25] you what amen every day something
[1:50:27] happened amen but then all of a sudden
[1:50:28] they get all the brick mate laid they
[1:50:30] get everything and the work moves from
[1:50:32] the outside to the inside and so now
[1:50:34] brother Junior you drive by that same
[1:50:35] house every day and there's no more
[1:50:37] walls going up there's no more physical
[1:50:39] outward signs Amen to say man
[1:50:42] something's getting done but what's
[1:50:44] happened is the work has changed it has
[1:50:47] moved from the outside to the inside
[1:50:49] come on church it's so so it's not that
[1:50:52] something is not getting done it's just
[1:50:55] change where it's getting done before
[1:50:57] you can see it outside but now to see it
[1:50:59] you got to get out and come in okay if
[1:51:03] you want to see where the works
[1:51:04] happening you got to get out of your
[1:51:06] truck and you're gonna come inside and
[1:51:08] you've got to see that the work is not
[1:51:10] outside it's Luke 24. it's a little room
[1:51:13] where they're breaking bread and the
[1:51:15] shine of the resurrected Christ is back
[1:51:18] I want to say this to your friends I
[1:51:21] know sometimes right now it may not look
[1:51:24] like every service we're shouting and
[1:51:26] every service we're running but I want
[1:51:27] to put a declaration upon that statement
[1:51:29] that does not mean that something is not
[1:51:32] happening in the house of God come on
[1:51:35] I've seen people shouting dancing
[1:51:36] running speaking in tongues and carrying
[1:51:38] on and ain't got no work going on
[1:51:40] they've been there sometimes I was
[1:51:42] talking Josh Bennett till today hey
[1:51:43] Splendor he said sometimes he said
[1:51:46] somebody asked me the ongoing they said
[1:51:47] brother Josh He said how do you feel
[1:51:49] when you preach seven services and only
[1:51:52] eight service amen somebody comes in and
[1:51:54] the meeting blows up he said well I
[1:51:56] shout right with you they said you mean
[1:51:58] I should shout he said yeah he said it
[1:52:01] took those seven services to build up to
[1:52:03] that age service he said see we're all
[1:52:05] working together and it don't matter
[1:52:07] when it explodes and you know why we got
[1:52:09] a bunch of jealousy among preachers it's
[1:52:11] cause if every service everybody ain't
[1:52:13] swinging from Chandelier to Chandelier
[1:52:15] and they're not anointed amen but
[1:52:17] sometimes you got to take your Bible and
[1:52:19] you got to take some tapes and you gotta
[1:52:21] lay in the word and you've got to lay
[1:52:22] some thoughts together come on Faith
[1:52:24] Tabernacle do you think those meetings
[1:52:26] happen amen just because six preachers
[1:52:28] show up they happen because there's
[1:52:31] people working together under a burden
[1:52:33] there's a pastor with a vision they say
[1:52:35] Sir come on Amen we have we have we have
[1:52:38] what 11 months of services and one month
[1:52:41] of astronaut that's a tremendous meeting

[1:53:10] mind amen they're contributing come on
[1:53:13] church this ain't about a big eye
[1:53:14] showing up it's about all of us working
[1:53:16] together behind the vision to see a
[1:53:20] change
[1:53:21] I know they're scoffers I know there's
[1:53:24] critics I know there's people saying
[1:53:26] well nothing's happening but I challenge
[1:53:28] that statement and I resent that
[1:53:30] statement in the name of Jesus Christ as
[1:53:33] a member of the Bride of Jesus Christ I
[1:53:35] say Satan you are a liar I will not
[1:53:38] judge what God is doing in the lives of
[1:53:40] the People by the outward appearance but
[1:53:42] I will judge it by the change that's
[1:53:44] taken place in their lives and I see
[1:53:46] some of y'all right now amen some of
[1:53:48] y'all a few weeks ago you couldn't raise
[1:53:50] your hands because you was going through
[1:53:51] something but you didn't give up you
[1:53:53] kept on coming and today you got your
[1:53:55] hands in there amen some of you
[1:53:57] preachers I'm looking at you and I know
[1:53:59] there's been times that you've slim this
[1:54:01] poop in and you didn't feel like
[1:54:02] preaching but you stood here anyhow and
[1:54:05] you preached anyhow you know why because
[1:54:07] you was here in a time of trouble but
[1:54:09] you remembered it was a time of this
[1:54:11] presence and his presence is greater
[1:54:14] than the scoffers his presence is
[1:54:16] greater than the critics his presence is
[1:54:18] greater than all the game shares I put
[1:54:21] my voice with the voice of Sean Martin
[1:54:23] and Faith Tabernacle and the Bride of
[1:54:25] Jesus Christ there is something
[1:54:27] happening it's called the bright Revival
[1:54:29] and little by little by little changes
[1:54:32] are taking place
[1:54:34] come on Church the walls didn't come
[1:54:37] down on the first day because they kept
[1:54:39] on marching and they didn't come down on
[1:54:40] the second day but they kept on marching
[1:54:42] what if brother Durham they had gone
[1:54:44] around the fifth day and said ain't
[1:54:45] nothing happening let's just go back
[1:54:47] home the walls would have never come
[1:54:49] down but on the seventh time
[1:54:52] on the seventh time around those walls
[1:54:54] sister Faith they let out a shout and
[1:54:57] the walls come down tell the scoffers
[1:54:59] then nothing's happening the walls are
[1:55:02] laying on the ground

[1:58:58] believed you know why because the
[1:59:00] strength of the presence of God has
[1:59:03] become the lifter
[1:59:06] they say there ain't much happening the
[1:59:09] prophet of God said there is something
[1:59:10] happening
[1:59:11] now now I know I got way out there but I
[1:59:15] just learned to follow the lord when he
[1:59:16] leads me there
[1:59:18] there's a strength in this word
[1:59:20] we need to change her attitudes
[1:59:22] it ain't just Wednesday night

[1:59:42] [Music]
[1:59:47] no that's a good time to go to church
[1:59:49] that means his presence is there
[1:59:52] [Music]
[2:00:00] gotta tell you what a prophet said boy
[2:00:03] y'all forgive me I didn't get nowhere
[2:00:05] this morning
[2:00:07] he said now tonight the holy spirit is
[2:00:09] in his church to fulfill what the New
[2:00:11] Testament said would come to pass in the
[2:00:12] last days and you see the people on the
[2:00:14] street around who criticize and say
[2:00:16] those things are not right just feel
[2:00:18] sorry for them
[2:00:20] there's got to be somebody on that side
[2:00:22] are you ready for this
[2:00:24] and remember there'll be more than you
[2:00:26] are than we are
[2:00:29] see in the last day scoffers will come
[2:00:31] the Bible said they would come in the
[2:00:33] last day and be religious people they'd
[2:00:35] be heady high-minded lovers of pleasure
[2:00:36] more than lovers of God and continent
[2:00:38] despisers those that are good they call
[2:00:39] you a Holy Roller anything you could
[2:00:41] just to make fun of you Holy Roller
[2:00:43] despisers of those that are good having
[2:00:46] a form of godliness they go to church to
[2:00:49] Sunday school
[2:00:50] but with deny the power thereof
[2:00:55] now that wasn't to be in that day
[2:00:57] he said that's to be
[2:00:59] in this day
[2:01:02] brother shalom I read that the other day
[2:01:04] I about I about ran all over the place
[2:01:06] he'll be more scoffers
[2:01:10] there will be believers
[2:01:13] there'll be more critics of this end
[2:01:15] time message
[2:01:17] than there will be followers
[2:01:20] there'll be more on that side against it
[2:01:23] there'll be more saying nothing's
[2:01:25] happening
