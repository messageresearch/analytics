[18:26] Amen. Let's all look to the Lord as we
[18:29] pray.
[18:29] [Music]
[18:32] Lord, we ask a simple question sometimes
[18:34] in oursel. We might ought to ask the
[18:37] question, where did we get that desire
[18:39] to serve you, Lord? Thinking about
[18:41] coming to church. One school they were
[18:44] playing soccer, had soccer practice.
[18:46] Another school had baseball practice and
[18:49] so forth. Why don't they have a desire
[18:51] to go to church? Lord, why did you why
[18:54] did you give us a desire? There's
[18:56] nothing in a human being to really
[18:58] desire God, but you put something in
[19:00] there. There's nothing in a a hog to be
[19:02] a sheep, but you you had to place a
[19:04] nature change in there for we had a
[19:06] desire to serve you. Thank you, Lord,
[19:08] for that. I just got to think about
[19:10] that. You gave us that desire to serve
[19:13] you, and we so appreciate that. Thank
[19:15] you for sending us Malachi 4, for
[19:17] sending us this message. We ask Lord for
[19:19] these prayer requests. You know, Sister
[19:21] Brennon going in for that cataract
[19:22] surgery. I pray that you'll just guide
[19:24] the doctor's hand. Lord, uh he's been to
[19:28] school, Lord. He's had much experience,
[19:31] no doubt. But Lord, I pray that your
[19:33] hand of God would just guide uh him
[19:35] smoothly as he performs that operation
[19:37] as you give her grace this week and next
[19:40] week also with those three or four
[19:43] requests for sickness. I pray that
[19:45] you'll be with each one of them. you
[19:46] know the needs and sister um uh Kimberly
[19:50] and you know her condition and what she
[19:52] has need of. We just pray for her also.
[19:55] Lord, we're needy people, but we have a
[19:57] one that's an everpresent help in a time
[19:59] of need. And I pray for brother Sean as
[20:01] you he brings the evening message
[20:03] tonight. Lord, let it be spiritual food
[20:05] in due season. and what you've laid upon
[20:06] his heart to bring to us, Lord, and just
[20:08] be fresh Vanna that will just give us
[20:10] insight, give us understanding, Lord,
[20:13] that more ammunition to be an overcomer
[20:15] in this last few days of what we got
[20:18] left on this uh bride age that we're
[20:21] living in. Leot closed out as far as
[20:23] we're concerned in the bride age, but
[20:25] how thankful we are for where we are,
[20:28] where you're taking us to, and the
[20:29] promise of that full adoption. Oh God,
[20:32] how we thank you. Bless all that's done
[20:34] and said tonight we pray all the
[20:36] unspoken requests raise hands. You know
[20:38] what's upon their hearts. Bless our
[20:40] visitors. We just pray for each request
[20:41] in Jesus name.
[20:45] [Music]
[20:48] Amen. You can be
[20:50] seated. And throughout
[20:56] eternity I'm going to praise him.
[21:03] And
[21:05] forever
[21:06] more I will reign with
[21:11] [Music]
[21:13] him.
[21:14] Oh hell king
[21:20] Jesus. Oh hell I
[21:26] manel. He's the king of kings. His Lord
[21:32] applaudes the bright morning star.
[21:36] [Music]
[21:39] Oh, and throughout
[21:45] eternity I'm going to praise
[21:50] him and
[21:53] forever
[21:55] more I will reign with him as Judah gets
[22:01] ready to come. Oh hail King Jesus.

[22:26] star. Oh, and throughout
[22:33] eternity I'm going to praise him.
[22:40] and
[22:41] forever
[22:43] more I will reign with
[22:50] him.
[22:56] Amen. Grew
[22:58] still as she made her way to Jesus.
[23:03] She stumbles through the tears that made
[23:08] her
[23:11] blind. She felt such
[23:15] pain. Some spoken anger. Heard folks
[23:20] whisper, "There's no place here for her
[23:25] kind." Oh, still on. She came through
[23:30] the shame that flushed her face until at
[23:35] last she knelled before his
[23:41] feet. Though she spoke no
[23:44] words, everything she said was
[23:47] heard as she poured her love for the
[23:51] master from her box of alabaster.
[23:57] And I've come to pour my praise on him
[24:03] like
[24:05] boy from
[24:07] Mary's alabaster b.
[24:11] [Music]
[24:13] So don't be angry if I wash his feet
[24:17] with my tears and dried them with my
[24:25] hair. Cuz you weren't
[24:29] there that night. He found
[24:33] me. You did not feel what I felt when he
[24:38] wrapped his loving arms around me. And
[24:42] you don't know the cause of the soil in
[24:47] my
[24:49] alabaster
[24:50] [Music]
[24:55] box. I can't
[24:59] forget the way life used to be. I was a
[25:03] prisoner to the sin that had me bound.
[25:10] I spend my
[25:12] days pouring my life without measure
[25:16] into a little treasure box I thought I
[25:22] found.
[25:23] Oh, until the day when Jesus came to me
[25:29] and healed my soul with the wonder of
[25:34] his touch.
[25:36] So now I'm giving back to him all the
[25:41] praise he's worthy of. I've been forgi.
[25:45] And that's why I love him so much.
[25:53] And I've come to pour my praise on him
[25:59] like
[26:00] oil from Mary's
[26:07] alabaster. So don't be angry if I wash
[26:11] his feet with my tears and I dry them
[26:15] with my hair.
[26:18] [Music]
[26:19] Oh, cuz you weren't
[26:23] there the night Jesus found me. You did
[26:28] not feel what I felt when he wrapped his
[26:32] loving arms around
[26:35] me. You don't know the cause, not of
[26:39] this oil.
[26:41] Oh, you don't know the cause of my
[26:46] praise.
[26:47] [Music]
[26:49] And you don't know the
[26:51] cause of the soil in my
[26:55] alabaster box.
[27:03] [Applause]
[27:15] Amen. Did you come to pour your praise
[27:17] on him tonight? Amen. Um, Brother
[27:21] Brandon and Sister Amy, do y'all have a
[27:23] song for us tonight? Sure. Okay. All
[27:26] right. Uh, can we sing that song?
[27:32] Um, I'll praise you morning and night.
[27:45] My mind's gone
[27:49] blank. I sing that
[27:54] song. Oh, I
[27:57] worship
[27:59] you
[28:02] almighty God.

[29:01] believe that
[29:01] [Music]
[29:03] tonight? No one else can touch my heart
[29:07] like you
[29:10] do. Oh, I could search for all
[29:14] eternity long and

[29:23] more
[29:24] time. Oh, there is none like

[29:57] Amen. Can we just stand to our feet as
[30:00] we invite our pastor to
[30:02] come? Amen. Can we sing that song?
[30:04] Little girl was lying
[30:12] there. Little girl was lying
[30:15] there. People are weeping.
[30:20] They just laugh at
[30:22] Jesus when he said she's only
[30:26] sleeping. But as he took her by the
[30:30] hand, she began to live
[30:34] again. Some began to praise the Lord and
[30:38] some began to
[30:43] say, "He's in the house." Oh, and death
[30:48] has to flee.
[30:50] Oh, now there is

[31:17] were dead in all our
[31:20] sins. But Jesus touched this heart of
[31:23] mine and he gave me life
[31:27] again. Now I am just a house of clay.

[35:53] the Lord and and um just good to see
[35:57] them blessed.
[35:58] Amen. Uh before we go into the word, may
[36:01] we just bow our heads and just talk to
[36:03] our Lord for a moment.
[36:06] Father, Lord, we come to you needy Lord
[36:10] and
[36:11] our soul desiring more of
[36:15] you, Father. And we realize that we
[36:18] couldn't have that desire unless you
[36:20] created it within us. And Father, you
[36:23] created it within us because you want to
[36:26] meet with us. You desire, Lord, to have
[36:28] fellowship with us. And Father, it's the
[36:31] deep calling unto the deep. And we're so
[36:35] glad that we're able to respond to that
[36:38] call. Yes, sir. And Lord, we're just
[36:41] asking now that you would just move
[36:43] among us this evening. That you'd
[36:46] forgive us of all of our sins and our
[36:48] failures. And Father, may we just uh
[36:52] just yield ourselves to you, Father. And
[36:55] may you speak through me. And Father,
[36:59] may you just speak to your people. And
[37:02] may we all have a heart to receive and
[37:05] to understand.
[37:07] We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. And
[37:10] the church says, "Amen." Amen. And amen.
[37:15] Uh 2 Corinthians the 4th
[37:18] chapter, and we're going to start at the
[37:22] the 15th
[37:25] verse. But it says, "For all these
[37:27] things are for your sakes, that the
[37:30] abundant grace might through the
[37:33] thanksgiving of many redown to the glory
[37:36] of
[37:37] God. For which cause we thank not, but
[37:40] though our outward man perish, yet the
[37:43] inward man is renewed day by day.
[37:47] For our light affliction, which is but
[37:50] for a moment, workketh for us a far more
[37:54] exceeding and eternal weight of
[37:56] glory. While we look not at the things
[38:00] which are seen, but at things the things
[38:04] which are not seen, for the things which
[38:07] are seen are temporal, but the things
[38:10] which are not seen are eternal. Amen.
[38:15] Amen. And you can have your seats this
[38:18] evening. And um I guess if I would have
[38:22] a a title, it'd be seeing the unseen
[38:26] from the heart.
[38:29] Amen. And you know, we realize that
[38:34] there is an unseen
[38:36] world that the average person knows
[38:39] nothing about.
[38:42] And
[38:43] um and and so Paul tells us that we we
[38:49] look the believer. Uh that's that's who
[38:52] he's talking about. We the believer look
[38:56] uh to the unseen.
[39:00] We're not crazy. We're not
[39:04] um you know looking
[39:08] uh I guess you know the world would
[39:10] think we're crazy. Uh this is not a
[39:13] figment of our imagination.
[39:15] It's just something that we see that the
[39:20] world cannot see. Amen. And so they they
[39:25] might think that we're imagining things
[39:27] or hallucinating or uh just just in a
[39:32] hype, but we are actually seeing things
[39:35] that are real. Amen. And yet they're
[39:39] unseen. Things are real that we are
[39:43] looking at and yet they're unseen. So
[39:45] can someone see something and yet
[39:47] another person not see it? Well, the
[39:50] Bible says we can, and we we've seen
[39:53] that experience u uh with Elisha and his
[39:58] servant as the the the uh second Kings 6
[40:03] and 15. It talks about when the servant
[40:06] uh of the man of God was risen early and
[40:10] gone forth, behold, and host compass the
[40:13] city both with horses and chariots. And
[40:17] his servant said unto him, "Alas, my
[40:19] master, how shall we do?" And he,
[40:22] Elisha, answered, "Fear not, for they
[40:25] that be with us are more than they that
[40:27] be with them." Amen. So Elisha is
[40:30] actually seeing something that that the
[40:33] servant is not seeing. And Elisha prayed
[40:36] and said, "Lord, I pray thee, open his
[40:39] eyes that he may see." Not that he was
[40:43] blind. He just couldn't see the unseen.
[40:45] Amen. Yet the unseen was obvious to
[40:49] Elisha. So he says, "Lord, open his eyes
[40:53] that he may see." And the Lord opened
[40:56] the eyes of the young man, and he saw,
[40:59] and behold, the mountain was full of
[41:01] horses and chariots of fire round about
[41:04] Elisha. Amen. So we find that that you
[41:09] can see something and yet someone else
[41:12] cannot see it.
[41:14] Jesus would talk to his disciples and he
[41:17] would say this in John
[41:20] 14:19 yet a little while and the world
[41:23] seeth me no more but you see me. So
[41:27] there will be the the now brother
[41:30] Brandham talks about the world that
[41:32] cannot see him would be that unbeliever.
[41:35] The unbeliever will not see me he says
[41:38] but you shall see me. The believer shall
[41:41] see me. See? And so then then we ask,
[41:45] well, why is it that the unbeliever
[41:48] cannot see him and yet the believer can
[41:51] see him? And brother Brandham of course
[41:54] gives gives many answers as well as the
[41:56] Bible. But brother Brandham says this,
[41:58] angelic beings associate together. He
[42:02] said, I hope you get that that just
[42:04] dropped down right down free. He said,
[42:08] "Look," he said, "if you got the Holy
[42:10] Spirit in you, then you're a candidate
[42:13] for association with the unseen world
[42:17] and the supernatural." Aren't you glad
[42:19] for the Holy Ghost? Amen. Because if
[42:22] you've got the Holy Ghost, then you're a
[42:24] candidate, Brother Bill, of the unseen
[42:28] uh for association with the unseen world
[42:30] and the supernatural. No wonder people
[42:33] can't believe in those things. They've
[42:36] never come in contact. That's that's why
[42:38] they can't believe in God. They and and
[42:41] the world is becoming more and more uh
[42:44] uh uh uh sure of themselves that there
[42:48] is no God. There is no creator. There
[42:51] there are no such things as as the
[42:53] supernatural. Amen. But but it's it
[42:56] shows that they they've never come in
[42:59] contact with God and they're not an
[43:01] assoc they're not association with the
[43:04] unseen. He said, "So, no wonder people
[43:06] can't believe in those things. They've
[43:08] never come in contact. They've got
[43:10] nothing in here to believe with. But
[43:13] when the Holy Spirit comes into the
[43:15] heart, quickly, he becomes a a a
[43:18] two-fold being. One of earth to die and
[43:22] one of heaven to live." So, notice he
[43:25] says in his body, he's still subject to
[43:28] death, but in his soul, he's passed from
[43:32] death unto life. In his body, he has his
[43:36] earthly contact with his five senses. In
[43:40] his spirit, he has a contact with God
[43:42] through the Holy Ghost. And the angels
[43:45] of God visit them and speaks with them.
[43:49] And they are messengers sent from God to
[43:53] reveal and to bring messages from God to
[43:56] the individual. Can you say amen? So, so
[44:00] then then we find to see the unseen uh
[44:05] uh then it takes the Holy Ghost, amen,
[44:08] in to come into a person's heart, amen,
[44:11] and show him things that cannot be seen
[44:15] with the natural eye or with cannot be
[44:18] discovered with the natural senses. I I
[44:20] believe the angels of God are here right
[44:22] now. I I just believe that every promise
[44:26] of God is true. I I I believe there's a
[44:29] heaven. I I believe there's a
[44:30] millennium. I I believe the new earth is
[44:33] there. I believe the theophony. Amen.
[44:36] That I have a theophony. Amen. And and
[44:39] yet it would take the Holy Spirit to
[44:42] come into us. Amen. To see those things
[44:45] which the natural eye cannot see. Amen.
[44:49] See, now we we look in and in in uh
[44:52] Romans uh 8:16, Paul tells us the spirit
[44:57] itself beareth witness with our spirit
[45:00] that we are the children of God. So this
[45:03] is an example of why we need amen. The
[45:07] Holy Ghost, amen, in order for us to see
[45:10] the unseen. Amen. Because we were born
[45:14] defeated. We were we were born uh uh in
[45:18] sin having this carnal nature that was
[45:21] totally against God. It's an enemy
[45:24] against God. It cannot be subject to
[45:26] God. Amen. Or to his word and and all
[45:30] these things. And by all rights, amen.
[45:33] We should be believing that we're we're
[45:35] we're going to die. We're going to rot.
[45:38] We're going to hail. And because we're
[45:40] undeserving of of any of God's mercy, we
[45:44] all deserve hail. How many believes that
[45:47] we all uh uh deserve these things. We
[45:50] all deserve to go in the in the great
[45:53] tribulation. We all deserve to be able
[45:56] to or to stand before God's uh the the
[45:59] white throne judgment and to be judged
[46:02] by a righteous God. But you know what? I
[46:04] don't see myself standing Amen. at the
[46:07] white throne judgment. I I uh being
[46:10] judged by God. I don't see myself going
[46:13] through the great tribulation. I I don't
[46:15] see myself, Amen, going to hell. I I
[46:18] don't see myself as being defeated and
[46:21] and and and being helpless and and all
[46:24] of these things. Can you say amen? See,
[46:28] because the spirit has revealed to us,
[46:31] Amen. that that we're not hellbound.
[46:34] Amen. We're not vagabonds. We're we're
[46:37] no longer sinners, but we are the
[46:40] children of God. Amen. We are See, so
[46:43] then we are sons and daughters of God.
[46:47] Amen. And and we can only believe that
[46:50] because the Holy Spirit has come into us
[46:53] and bears witness with our spirit that
[46:56] we are sons of God. Can you say amen?
[46:59] This is what gives us a hope. Amen.
[47:01] Because now we're we're looking at the
[47:04] unseen. We're looking at what our senses
[47:07] doesn't declare. We're looking at things
[47:09] and believing in things that our own
[47:11] bodies doesn't even declare. Amen. But
[47:14] yet, we know it to be true because the
[47:17] spirit of God bears witness with our
[47:20] spirit. Amen. That we are sons and
[47:23] daughters of God. Amen. See, so the
[47:26] spirit of God shows, amen, the believer,
[47:29] what is unseen, what cannot be seen.
[47:33] Amen. with the five senses. Brother Bram
[47:36] says being a believer, amen, is what
[47:39] makes you a Christian. It's not going to
[47:41] church that makes you a Christian. It's
[47:43] not being talented or gifted, amen, uh
[47:46] uh or smart or uh uh wealthy or or
[47:49] whatever. Amen. Or having a position in
[47:53] life. What makes us a a Christian is
[47:57] being a believer. And brother Brown
[47:59] said, "What is a believer?" One that
[48:01] believes the word of God. How many
[48:04] believes that? Amen. One that believes
[48:06] the word of God. A Amen. Going against
[48:09] all reasoning, going against all things.
[48:12] We're not believing. The believer does
[48:15] not believe in what his five senses
[48:17] tells him. It it does not believe by
[48:20] what he sees or how he feels or uh uh
[48:23] all of these things, but he simply
[48:26] believes in the word of God. Amen.
[48:30] unseen and and so then we find that the
[48:33] unseen is really found in the word of
[48:36] God. Amen. The unseen are the promises
[48:40] of God. How many believes that God
[48:42] promised that there is a new heaven and
[48:44] a new earth? God promised that there
[48:47] would be a bride without spot, wrinkle,
[48:49] or blemish. God promised that we would
[48:52] never have to go, amen, into judgment,
[48:55] but we pass from death unto life. God's
[48:58] promise the rapture. God's promised a
[49:00] body change. God's promised, Amen. Amen.
[49:04] A theophony. Can you say amen? God's
[49:07] promised a place where there's no tears
[49:09] and no sorrow and heartbreak and no
[49:11] trials and troubles. Amen. God's
[49:14] promised that we will live in a place
[49:16] where Satan is no longer there and and
[49:19] no longer can trouble us. And God's
[49:22] promised these things. And that is what
[49:25] is unseen. We're living in a world of
[49:28] trouble. We're living in a world of
[49:30] corruption. We're living in in a world,
[49:32] a time that people don't know what to
[49:34] do. And because they're looking at what
[49:36] they can see. Amen. But you cannot look
[49:39] at what you see. You must look at the
[49:42] unseen of what God has promised in his
[49:46] word. Amen. Brother Bram said, he said,
[49:50] "You can't read the Bible like a
[49:51] newspaper." Amen. And you know, he says,
[49:53] "See, and and they had an explosion the
[49:56] other day, and now I don't know whether
[49:58] it's true or not." See, they tell us so
[50:00] many things that's wrong. You just can't
[50:03] pay no attention to it. See, but when
[50:05] you read the Bible, it's a love letter
[50:08] to the church. If you read the Bible in
[50:11] any other way, then you're reading the
[50:12] Bible wrong. Because this Bible is a
[50:15] love letter to the church. It's not a
[50:18] it's not a book of of wrath or of
[50:20] judgment to the bride, but it is a love
[50:24] letter. And and in that love letter,
[50:26] Brother Brown says you have to look and
[50:28] read between the lines. You the the
[50:31] unseen is there. Amen. But it's between
[50:34] the lines. Can you say amen? That's
[50:37] right. It's a love letter. So he says,
[50:40] you know, the Bible said Jesus thanked
[50:42] God for hiding it from the eyes of the
[50:44] wise and prudent and and revealed it to
[50:47] babes such as would learn. He goes in
[50:51] another place, when I go overseas, my
[50:53] sweet little wife will write me a
[50:54] letter. Dear Billy, I'm sitting here
[50:57] tonight with the children. We just put
[50:59] them to bed. Little Joseph cried a
[51:00] little tonight for you and uh before I
[51:03] went to bed. See, I know what she's
[51:05] writing. See, but I love her so much
[51:08] that I can read between the lines. And I
[51:11] know what she's talking about. That's
[51:13] the way you have to read God's word is
[51:16] between the lines. Can you say amen? If
[51:19] you love him, he just reveals it to you.
[51:22] That That's what we want. We want God to
[51:24] reveal it to us. We don't want to just
[51:26] sit in this world of doom and gloom and
[51:29] not be able to look at a a a a promise.
[51:32] Amen. But God has revealed them or God
[51:35] will reveal them. So he says if you love
[51:37] him, he will reveals it to you. He said
[51:40] you start there and you just why just
[51:43] here it is. See why I say here it is.
[51:46] Yes sir. So it it begins to unfold to us
[51:50] of the unseen things. Amen. No wonder we
[51:54] get happy. No wonder we're at peace. No
[51:57] wonder we're full of joy in a time of
[52:00] trouble. in a time of desolation, in a
[52:02] time, amen, when we have no reason uh uh
[52:06] naturally to be happy about. Amen. But
[52:09] yet we know we're looking at something
[52:11] that the world cannot see. Amen. See,
[52:15] now we find that no man can know it. No
[52:18] man can know it. We've had theologians
[52:20] and and and and they've got seminaries
[52:23] and great teachers of the word and has
[52:26] been teachers for years. Amen. of trying
[52:29] to figure out, amen, this this Bible to
[52:32] try to see the unseen and yet they've
[52:36] not been able to discover it. Amen.
[52:39] Because no man can know it unless it is
[52:42] revealed of God. Amen. By the spirit of
[52:45] God. No man can reveal it to you. No
[52:48] pope, no no preacher, no no nothing can
[52:51] reveal, amen, the unseen to us. Amen.
[52:54] This is what Paul would tell us. Uh 1
[52:57] Corinthians 2:9. But as it is written, I
[53:00] hath not seen nor ear heard, neither has
[53:04] it entered into the heart of man the
[53:06] things which God hath prepared for them
[53:09] that love him. But God, everybody say,
[53:12] but God. But God hath revealed them unto
[53:16] us by his spirit. For the Spirit
[53:20] searchth all things, yay, the deep
[53:23] things of God. So for what man knoweth
[53:26] the things of a man, save the spirit of
[53:28] man which is in him? Even so the things
[53:31] of God knoweth no man, but the spirit of
[53:33] God. Now notice what he says in the 12th
[53:36] verse. Now we have received not the
[53:39] spirit of the world. Can you say amen?
[53:43] We're not caught up in the spirit of the
[53:45] age. We're not caught up in the spirit
[53:48] of Leosa, the spirit of the world. Can
[53:50] you say amen? But see, he says, "But the
[53:54] spirit which is of God," that's what we
[53:57] have received in this day. Amen. "That
[54:00] we might know the things that are freely
[54:04] given to us of God." Can you say amen?
[54:08] Well, those things that are freely given
[54:10] to us is the unseen things that have
[54:14] been revealed to us. Amen. those unseen
[54:17] things that have been revealed to us.
[54:22] Amen. Deuteronomy 29 and 29, Amen, says,
[54:26] "The secret things belong unto the Lord
[54:29] our God, but those things which are
[54:34] revealed belong to us." Can you say
[54:37] amen? No wonder the spirit of revelation
[54:40] revelation is so important to us. It's
[54:43] it's more than knowing your ABCs. It's
[54:46] more than than knowing all about the
[54:48] stock market. It's it's more than
[54:50] knowing how to invest your money in and
[54:53] all of these things. Them are fine.
[54:55] Amen. Whatever you want to do. But the
[54:57] greatest thing is when the spirit of God
[55:01] reveals those things to us that are
[55:04] hidden. Can you say amen? Because when
[55:07] they're revealed, then that means they
[55:09] belong to you. Amen. This why we know
[55:12] heaven belongs to us. Amen. and a body
[55:15] change. The rapture belongs to us. Amen.
[55:18] They have been revealed. Amen. And this
[55:22] word revealed. Amen. Uh uh it it it
[55:26] means to make known through divine
[55:29] inspiration. To make something that is
[55:32] secret or hidden known to open up to
[55:36] view. Amen. So those things, Amen. The
[55:40] hidden things belong to God. But those
[55:43] things that have been opened up for us
[55:45] to view and to see and to personally uh
[55:50] uh uh uh see. Amen. Uh uh belong to us
[55:54] and to our children forever. Can you say
[55:58] amen? So the unseen is is revealed to
[56:02] the believer. Amen. The Bible speaks of
[56:06] the Old Testament saints and and how the
[56:09] promises were revealed to them, but yet
[56:12] it says they saw them aar off. Amen.
[56:15] That's what Paul says in the book of
[56:17] Hebrews the 11th chapter is that they
[56:19] saw the promises, but they saw them a
[56:22] far off. But notice how they saw them.
[56:25] They were only seeing the promises
[56:27] through types and shadows. That's that's
[56:30] all they could see. The promises were so
[56:32] far off that they could only see the
[56:34] shadow. Amen. Of what that shadow was
[56:37] reflecting, a man see. So they they saw
[56:41] the promises and yet not everybody could
[56:44] see what they saw. Amen. Therefore, they
[56:47] were not persuaded as the saints were
[56:51] that saw them. Those that saw them saw
[56:54] the promises. Even though they saw them
[56:56] a far off, the Bible says they were
[56:59] persuaded of them. Amen. And not only
[57:02] did were they persuaded, but they
[57:05] embraced them. Can you say amen? Now,
[57:08] not everybody saw them promises. So, not
[57:11] everybody embraced them. Not everybody
[57:13] was persuaded of them. But everyone that
[57:16] saw them promises, Amen, a far off. Even
[57:20] though they were seeing them in a in a
[57:22] type, in a shadow, they embraced them.
[57:26] They were persuaded because they were
[57:29] looking at the unseen. Amen. And they
[57:32] acted like insane people. They acted
[57:35] like, Amen. strange people. Amen. But
[57:38] they saw something that would persuade
[57:41] them that they were pilgrims and
[57:43] strangers upon the earth. This world was
[57:46] not their home. Amen. what they saw.
[57:50] Amen. Persuaded them that they were
[57:53] going to another country. They were
[57:55] going to another land. Amen. That Oh,
[57:58] weren't you glad for that? Amen. See, so
[58:01] the unbeliever, See, now the unbeliever,
[58:04] all they saw in the back in the in the
[58:06] Old Testament, all they saw was a
[58:08] natural lamb. Amen. But see, the
[58:11] believer saw something beyond just that
[58:13] natural lamb. They saw the true lamb.
[58:16] Amen. in the type of the natural lamb.
[58:19] Amen. The unbeliever could only see a
[58:21] natural blood of an animal. They they
[58:24] could only see a natural altar. They
[58:26] could only see a natural priest and and
[58:29] and and all of these things. But see, so
[58:33] so it tells us that the unbeliever can
[58:36] cannot see beyond the natural things.
[58:39] They they they it uh to where they can
[58:42] look at the unseen. Amen. They just see
[58:45] the natural things, the natural ability,
[58:48] the natural uh uh things that we do, you
[58:51] know, and and uh uh uh but yet the
[58:54] believer looks to the unseen. I'm sure
[58:57] Abel by revelation. He he slew that
[59:00] natural lamb, but he wasn't looking at
[59:02] that natural lamb. He was looking at the
[59:05] unseen. He saw the true lamb coming. He
[59:08] saw the true atonement, the true
[59:11] sacrifice coming. Amen. and was
[59:14] persuaded in it. The Bible says they all
[59:16] died in faith. Can you say amen? Not
[59:18] having received the promises, but saw
[59:20] them a far off. Amen. So they were
[59:23] looking at the unseen. Amen. But today,
[59:26] we're not looking at a type. Amen. But
[59:29] we're looking at the very substance that
[59:31] the types Amen. the shadow was
[59:34] reflecting. Amen. The you know, it's
[59:36] it's the shadow. You you know, brother
[59:38] Ram talked about that. You know, there's
[59:40] a you you can have a shadow of of a
[59:43] hand, amen, on the wall. And the further
[59:46] it gets, you just see a little shadow.
[59:49] It doesn't even reflect a hand. But the
[59:52] closer it gets to that shadow and the
[59:54] wall, Amen. the more the shadow begins
[59:56] to take form. Amen. But we're not
[59:59] looking at the shadow. We're looking at
[1:00:01] the very substance. We are the
[1:00:04] substance. We are the thing that the
[1:00:06] shadow was speaking of. Amen. Ruth was
[1:00:09] the shadow. Here we are what she typed
[1:00:12] out. Can you say amen? Amen. We look at
[1:00:15] all of these things that the Old
[1:00:16] Testament was just types and shadows.
[1:00:19] But we're living in the age of
[1:00:22] revelation. That's what a prophet said.
[1:00:24] He called it the age of revelation.
[1:00:26] That's what we're living in. This is why
[1:00:29] Revelations 10:1. We all know it. Amen.
[1:00:32] And I saw another mighty angel come down
[1:00:34] from heaven clothed with the cloud and a
[1:00:37] rainbow was upon his head. This is not a
[1:00:40] shadow. This is the reality of it. Amen.
[1:00:44] See that's happened in this age. And his
[1:00:46] face was as it were the sun and his feet
[1:00:49] as pillars of fire. And he had in his
[1:00:51] hand a little open book. He set his
[1:00:53] right foot upon the sea and his left
[1:00:56] foot upon the earth. And he cried with a
[1:00:58] loud voice as when a lion roar. And when
[1:01:00] he had cried, seven thunders uttered
[1:01:02] their voice. Can you say amen? See, so
[1:01:05] now we're looking and we're seeing and
[1:01:07] understanding the things that were once
[1:01:09] hid are now being revealed because it's
[1:01:14] no longer a closed book. It's an open
[1:01:18] book and the unseen is now being made
[1:01:22] known. Can you say amen? One beautiful
[1:01:25] thing is is the prophet says that John
[1:01:28] shouted. John says that he shouted and
[1:01:30] and all heaven and every creature in
[1:01:32] earth and under in the sea and and
[1:01:34] everywhere heard I John crying out glory
[1:01:38] and honor and praise under and the
[1:01:40] prophet said he must have saw his name.
[1:01:43] He must have saw his name that which was
[1:01:47] hidden from him. Amen. To where he
[1:01:49] couldn't see now that the book was open.
[1:01:53] He could see something just beyond a
[1:01:55] prophecy. He he saw something just
[1:01:58] beyond amen promises but he saw his name
[1:02:02] associated with every promise of God.
[1:02:06] Amen. Amen. See it it become the unseen
[1:02:11] become revealed to him. See we're we're
[1:02:14] preaching from an open book now. Aren't
[1:02:17] you glad for that? Not a closed book.
[1:02:19] It's it's not preachers guessing at the
[1:02:21] book and probing as it's been through
[1:02:24] all these years. Amen. No. no uh
[1:02:27] education, no doctorate of degrees,
[1:02:30] amen, could bring the revelation, amen,
[1:02:33] of what was written in the book. But now
[1:02:36] that the book is open, the lamb hath
[1:02:38] come forth, amen, now we're able to see
[1:02:42] the the unseen. Amen. Now, we notice uh
[1:02:47] the book was open, Revelations 10:7. But
[1:02:49] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:02:51] angel, when he shall begin to sound, the
[1:02:54] mystery of God should be finished,
[1:02:58] should be revealed. Ain't that right?
[1:03:00] Should be completed. Amen. As he hath
[1:03:03] declared to his servants, the prophets.
[1:03:06] So then we know there's only one way of
[1:03:09] revelation, amen, that comes to the
[1:03:12] channel of a prophet, and that is the
[1:03:14] seventh angel. Can you say amen? There's
[1:03:16] not many seventh angel prophets. There
[1:03:18] ain't many prophets out there that's got
[1:03:20] a revelation. It would be the seventh
[1:03:22] angel. And the prophet told us just how
[1:03:25] he got this revelation. The lamb came
[1:03:29] down. The mighty angel which was Christ
[1:03:32] only had that book and he gave it to the
[1:03:35] seventh angel. For he said the seventh
[1:03:38] angel must have been on earth has to be
[1:03:40] on earth at the time of this coming.
[1:03:43] Amen. And the angel gave it to that
[1:03:45] seventh angel. The mighty angel Christ
[1:03:48] gave it to that seventh angel to reveal
[1:03:51] the book to reveal the mystery unto his
[1:03:54] people. Can you say amen? So the hidden
[1:03:58] things are now being revealed. Amen. The
[1:04:02] revelation is now being made known. Let
[1:04:05] me ask you, what is the revelation?
[1:04:08] Well, it's Christ. Christ is the
[1:04:11] revelation. Amen. If you look at it,
[1:04:13] amen, the prophet priest that Christ is
[1:04:15] the mystery of God revealed. It's
[1:04:18] Christ. Amen. Every part of this book is
[1:04:21] Christ. How many believes that? He's the
[1:04:24] theme of the book. He's the theme of the
[1:04:26] story. It's a love story. Christ and his
[1:04:29] bride. Amen. See, so the revelation is
[1:04:33] Christ. Now, we find Luke
[1:04:36] 21:25. And there shall be signs in the
[1:04:39] sun and in the moon and in the stars and
[1:04:42] upon the earth distress of nations with
[1:04:45] perplexity. The sea and the waves are
[1:04:47] roaring. The prophet said that's our
[1:04:49] day. Tidal waves and earthquakes and and
[1:04:52] the things that are happening nation
[1:04:53] against nation and and all of these
[1:04:55] things, men's hearts failing them for
[1:04:58] fear and for looking after those things
[1:05:01] which are coming upon the earth in the
[1:05:03] tribulation. Amen. And that's why the
[1:05:05] fear is coming upon the earth and
[1:05:07] striking the people for the powers of
[1:05:10] heaven shall be shaken. But notice, and
[1:05:13] then shall they see the son of man
[1:05:15] coming in a cloud with power and great
[1:05:18] glory. Can you say amen? So the
[1:05:21] revelation that is made known to us is
[1:05:24] Christ. Everybody say it's Christ. The
[1:05:27] revelation is Christ. Amen. Christ
[1:05:30] revealed. Amen. the son of man coming in
[1:05:34] a cloud. Now, we know it's not a
[1:05:36] thunderhead cloud, but it's a cloud of
[1:05:39] angels. And notice now, Jesus already
[1:05:42] said, "The world will no longer see me."
[1:05:45] Ain't that right? The unbeliever will no
[1:05:47] longer see me, but you, the believer,
[1:05:50] will see me, for I will be in you.
[1:05:55] Amen. Can you say amen? Amen. See? Amen.
[1:06:00] So according to Luke 17, the son of man
[1:06:04] would be revealed. So it's a revelation
[1:06:08] of Christ. The son of man was not
[1:06:10] brother Brandham. The son of man wasn't
[1:06:12] even the angel. The son of man is
[1:06:14] Christ. Amen. Do you believe it? But
[1:06:19] where is he? Where what what is the
[1:06:21] revealing? Is it is it Christ revealed
[1:06:24] in his physical body? No, it's Christ
[1:06:27] revealed in his church.
[1:06:31] Praise the Lord.
[1:06:33] Can you say amen? Brother Bram says God
[1:06:36] was revealed in Christ. Jehovah revealed
[1:06:40] in Christ. He said, now where's God to
[1:06:42] be revealed? In his church with his
[1:06:46] people in us. Everybody say in us. Yes,
[1:06:50] sir. See the same spirit, the same
[1:06:54] works, the same manifestation, the same
[1:06:57] love, the same forgiveness, the same
[1:07:00] longsuffering, gentleness, patience,
[1:07:02] peace, mercy. All that was in Christ is
[1:07:07] in the church.
[1:07:09] Every attribute that was in Christ is
[1:07:12] now in the church.
[1:07:15] Same ministry, same power, same
[1:07:19] attitude. Ain't that right? Christ
[1:07:23] revealed in the church.
[1:07:26] What a revelation.
[1:07:29] Can you say amen? So he says, remember,
[1:07:31] keep this in mind. All that God was, he
[1:07:35] poured into Christ. He was the fullness
[1:07:37] of the Godhead bodily. And all that
[1:07:40] Christ was, he poured into the church.
[1:07:44] There you go. Now, why why is he here?
[1:07:47] Christ is here to fulfill or to
[1:07:50] vindicate his own word. He's come to
[1:07:55] claim what he has redeemed.
[1:07:58] Can you say amen? We are his victory.
[1:08:02] How many believes that he couldn't come
[1:08:05] into us as he did in Christ before the
[1:08:08] before the blood was shed, before the
[1:08:11] the the the uh ransom price was paid. He
[1:08:15] couldn't come unto us while we were yet
[1:08:17] sinners.
[1:08:19] Ain't that right? But now he's come in
[1:08:22] fullness in his church. Not one man, his
[1:08:27] church.
[1:08:30] Can you say amen? And the problem said,
[1:08:32] we are his victory. He died for this
[1:08:35] purpose. Oh, if we could see that. Amen,
[1:08:39] young people. He died for this purpose
[1:08:41] that he may come into you and every
[1:08:44] attribute of God may be displayed
[1:08:48] in you.
[1:08:51] Now the world is looking to see him with
[1:08:53] their natural eye. Right? Amen. That's
[1:08:56] what they expect is to see amen him
[1:08:59] coming in a cloud and they're looking
[1:09:02] for a thunderhead cloud. They don't even
[1:09:04] know what cloud to look for. That's
[1:09:06] right. and and they're expecting to see
[1:09:08] him in his physical coming. But the
[1:09:10] Bible says he never promised to come
[1:09:12] that way. Prophet said he never come
[1:09:14] promised that we he would never set his
[1:09:17] feet upon the earth. Amen. Before the
[1:09:20] rapture takes place in his corporal
[1:09:22] body. Can you say amen? The Bible says
[1:09:25] we'll meet the Lord in the air. But he
[1:09:28] is here not in his corporal body, but in
[1:09:32] his mystical body, his his church body.
[1:09:35] and he is the head. Can you say amen? So
[1:09:40] Jesus Christ has come as the son of man.
[1:09:43] He came as the son of man when he come
[1:09:45] to the earth the first time. He was the
[1:09:47] son of man but he wasn't recognized. And
[1:09:50] the prophet said why wasn't he
[1:09:52] recognized as son of man? He said
[1:09:55] because the son of man was the spiritual
[1:09:57] revelation a prophet. Son of man means
[1:10:00] prophet. Ain't that right? See, so Jesus
[1:10:03] was up on earth and the natural eye
[1:10:05] could see a physical body, but there was
[1:10:08] something about him that was unseen,
[1:10:10] that wasn't recognized. Amen. See? Amen.
[1:10:14] Now, the prophet said this. He says,
[1:10:16] "Now, he was son of man because he had
[1:10:20] come to reveal himself to Israel as a
[1:10:22] prophet, and they rejected it. And that
[1:10:25] was the prophecy that they should
[1:10:27] receive him in the name of the son of
[1:10:29] man, a prophet because it was according
[1:10:31] to the word. Deuteronomy 18:15, the Lord
[1:10:34] shall raise, your God shall raise up a
[1:10:36] prophet like an unto me. And when he
[1:10:39] come, he identified himself in his
[1:10:41] ministry as a man, not a son of God.
[1:10:46] Spirit, son of man. See, God is a
[1:10:49] spirit. and he revealed himself as son
[1:10:52] of man what he claimed to be and they
[1:10:55] was blinded and couldn't see it. Can you
[1:10:57] say amen? Amen. Well then so is it today
[1:11:00] the revelation of the son of man to be
[1:11:02] revealed. First of all the revealing has
[1:11:05] to come by way of a prophet. Can you say
[1:11:08] amen? Amos 3:7. Surely the Lord God will
[1:11:11] do nothing but he revealth his secret
[1:11:14] unto his servants the prophets. Ain't
[1:11:17] that right? And then God promised to
[1:11:20] send us a prophet in Malachi 4. Behold,
[1:11:22] I send unto you, Elijah the prophet
[1:11:24] before the great and dreadful day of the
[1:11:26] Lord. Brother Bram said, it'll have to
[1:11:29] be a divine-led prophet for the word of
[1:11:32] God to come to with the true
[1:11:35] interpretation of the revelation of
[1:11:38] Jesus Christ. There would be only one
[1:11:42] man, one uh uh a prophet that would have
[1:11:46] the revelation, the true
[1:11:49] interpretation of the revelation of
[1:11:52] Jesus Christ. See, so we're not looking
[1:11:55] at mystical things. We're not looking at
[1:11:57] things, amen, that doesn't have a true
[1:12:00] interpretation to it.
[1:12:03] We're not looking at symbols. We're not
[1:12:05] looking at something that's outside the
[1:12:07] Bible. Amen. That's not the unseen that
[1:12:10] we're looking at. We're looking at
[1:12:13] something that is found in the Bible,
[1:12:15] but yet is only come by revelation.
[1:12:19] Well, do you love him?
[1:12:22] Now, if you look Matthew
[1:12:25] 23:39, he says, I Jesus said, I say unto
[1:12:28] you, you shall not see me henceforth,
[1:12:31] till you shall say, blessed is he that
[1:12:34] cometh in the name of the Lord.
[1:12:37] So to see
[1:12:38] him, Amen. You you have to say, "Blessed
[1:12:42] is
[1:12:42] he that cometh in the name of the
[1:12:46] Lord." Can you say amen? Amen. To see
[1:12:50] the one that God sent, you have to
[1:12:52] recognize the one that God sent in order
[1:12:54] to see Christ.
[1:12:56] Ain't that right? now and and getting
[1:12:59] somewhere here that Brother Bram said,
[1:13:01] "The only way that you'll ever know is
[1:13:04] God has got to personally reveal himself
[1:13:07] to you in the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:11] before you'll ever know it."
[1:13:14] That's why we need the Holy Ghost. Do
[1:13:16] you believe that? That's why we need the
[1:13:18] spirit of God. We don't need to dry up
[1:13:20] and get all formal and and and say,
[1:13:23] "Well," and and and look to the prophet
[1:13:25] as though he was the only one that had
[1:13:27] God and and had the supernatural
[1:13:29] manifestations and and and a move of
[1:13:32] God. But I believe that God is still
[1:13:34] here among us. And we need him. Praise
[1:13:38] the Lord. Because that's the way you'll
[1:13:39] ever know. See, is God has to personally
[1:13:42] reveal himself to you in the power of
[1:13:45] the Holy Ghost before you'll ever know
[1:13:47] it. Jesus said himself, the scripture
[1:13:50] teaches, no man can say Jesus is the
[1:13:52] Christ only by the Holy Ghost. And
[1:13:55] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:13:57] you're only guessing at it. You're
[1:13:59] saying what the word said. You're saying
[1:14:01] what the pastor said. You're saying what
[1:14:03] mother said. But when the Holy Spirit
[1:14:05] comes in and baptizes you into the
[1:14:08] person of the uh of the Christ Jesus,
[1:14:11] then you know by personal experience
[1:14:13] that Jesus Christ is the son of God
[1:14:16] raised from the dead living in you the
[1:14:19] hope of glory. Amen. That's good. We're
[1:14:23] looking at the unseen. Something that is
[1:14:25] revealed
[1:14:26] to us.
[1:14:29] Now if you look, Brother Bram says
[1:14:31] another place. Now the Christ in the
[1:14:33] church, Christ in the church is just now
[1:14:36] being made known. Is just being made
[1:14:39] known. The whole thing is the revelation
[1:14:41] of God. How many believes that the whole
[1:14:44] thing is a revelation of God. We're not
[1:14:48] looking not not seeing uh uh
[1:14:51] denomination. We're not seeing some
[1:14:54] archbishop or some hierarchy. That's not
[1:14:57] what we're looking at in the unseen.
[1:15:00] We're seeing God. The whole revelation
[1:15:03] is God to take Eve back to her right
[1:15:08] position again with her husband. How
[1:15:11] many's going back to that position?
[1:15:13] Amen. If you're part of this bride,
[1:15:15] that's what you're going back to. Amen.
[1:15:18] See, looking at the unseen, notice, and
[1:15:22] God is the husband of the church, and
[1:15:25] the church is his bride. So the mystery
[1:15:29] that is being made known is Christ in
[1:15:31] you, the hope of glory. Can you say
[1:15:35] amen? Now the prophet says Satan takes
[1:15:39] people away from revelation because it
[1:15:43] reveals Jesus as being God and him uh
[1:15:48] Satan being the devil and he's doomed.
[1:15:50] How many believes that? Now now church,
[1:15:53] this is the revelation. Now see the
[1:15:56] revelation reveals Jesus as being God.
[1:15:59] How many believes he's God? Amen. Not
[1:16:02] because the pastor says it, preacher
[1:16:04] says it, prophet, whatever. That it's a
[1:16:07] re revelation. Jesus is God. He's He's
[1:16:11] Lord of Lord, King of Kings. Amen. Not
[1:16:14] the second person in the Godhead. Can
[1:16:16] you say amen? But it also reveals, Amen.
[1:16:21] Satan as to who he is. He's doomed. How
[1:16:26] many believes
[1:16:27] that? I don't care what your situation
[1:16:30] is. Satan is doomed. Amen. Think of it.
[1:16:34] Looking at the unseen. He may be in
[1:16:37] control of the world. And the world is
[1:16:39] getting wicked and wicked. You may look
[1:16:41] at yourself and see all your hang-ups
[1:16:43] and your faults and your failures. But
[1:16:45] I'm telling you, if you look at the
[1:16:47] unseen, the revelation shows us that
[1:16:50] Satan is doomed. Christ is not defeated.
[1:16:54] Christ is God, supreme Lord of Lord.
[1:16:59] Amen. This revelation, see, he takes the
[1:17:02] people from
[1:17:04] revelation. Amen. Because it reveals the
[1:17:07] glory of the sanctified church going
[1:17:11] home to God. How many's going home?
[1:17:15] We're going home. We're not being left
[1:17:18] in this world. Amen. He didn't just
[1:17:20] bring us this far to leave us, but we're
[1:17:23] looking at the unseen. I'm going home.
[1:17:27] I've got a home beyond the beyond the
[1:17:29] river. I've I've I've got an eternal
[1:17:32] kingdom. I'm going to Can you say amen?
[1:17:36] It re also reveals the doom of the false
[1:17:39] prophet. And all them that lie and do
[1:17:42] everything is going to be cast into the
[1:17:44] lake of fire. No wonder Satan keeps them
[1:17:48] away from it. No wonder he doesn't want
[1:17:51] you to get a revelation. Doesn't want me
[1:17:52] to get a revelation. There's one thing
[1:17:55] to say when you're on the mountaintop.
[1:17:57] Oh, God is good. I'm saved. I'm going to
[1:17:59] heaven. But it's down in the valleys
[1:18:01] when when you don't feel God, when you
[1:18:04] don't see God, then and and and your
[1:18:06] flesh is telling you, "Amen. Uh uh there
[1:18:09] ain't no way you're going to make it,
[1:18:11] you know, and and your flesh is acting
[1:18:13] like it's a heathen. and you just don't
[1:18:15] feel amen uh uh altogether, you know,
[1:18:19] there or right or whatever. Beck, that's
[1:18:21] when that revelation strikes your heart
[1:18:24] and you still look at the
[1:18:27] unseen instead of what you see, instead
[1:18:30] of what you feel, instead of what your
[1:18:32] senses say. Amen. You're looking at the
[1:18:35] unseen and declaring, "But I am a
[1:18:37] Christian. I will make it. I am
[1:18:40] prevailing. I am forgiven. I am a son
[1:18:43] and daughter of God. Amen. Well, but
[1:18:46] what about you feel it? Amen. It doesn't
[1:18:48] matter what I feel. I'm looking at
[1:18:50] something that is unseen and it's been
[1:18:53] opened up to me by revelation.
[1:18:59] Hallelujah. Oh yeah. He wants to get you
[1:19:01] away from revelation. Get the people
[1:19:03] away from revelation. Get them to where
[1:19:05] they're just looking at the natural
[1:19:06] things, looking at their abilities,
[1:19:09] looking at their talents, looking at the
[1:19:11] personality, looking at everything in
[1:19:13] the
[1:19:14] natural. He'll get you looking at your
[1:19:17] faults and your failures. Get you
[1:19:18] looking at your weakness. Get you
[1:19:19] looking to the church or some preacher.
[1:19:23] Get you looking at something else
[1:19:25] outside of God's word.
[1:19:31] Amen. But here's the key. Deity is not
[1:19:34] in heaven.
[1:19:36] It's in you.
[1:19:38] Can you say amen?
[1:19:40] Now, when you go and look in that
[1:19:42] mirror and you're looking at your flesh
[1:19:45] and you're seeing the decay and you're
[1:19:46] looking at that old man, Amen. But the
[1:19:50] revelation calls you to look beyond the
[1:19:52] natural and see something that's eternal
[1:19:55] inside.
[1:19:57] Deity is in this old body. Deity is in
[1:20:01] me. Can you say amen? Yes, sir. That's
[1:20:04] right. See, so we're looking at what
[1:20:07] cannot be seen with the natural senses.
[1:20:11] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. It's why
[1:20:13] the this word of God is so important for
[1:20:16] us to read. And not just to read, but
[1:20:19] God just to open it up to us. See, now
[1:20:23] brother Bram says, notice what he says.
[1:20:25] If we'll just live close to him, that's
[1:20:28] it.
[1:20:30] He'll provide something else for us.
[1:20:33] See, there's an insight that we can see
[1:20:38] what the ordinary person never
[1:20:41] sees. When we're born again, we see him.
[1:20:46] Amen. I see him in the message. Amen.
[1:20:50] People say, "Well, we got to get the
[1:20:52] people to Christ before we get them to
[1:20:53] the message." I see Christ is the
[1:20:55] message. Amen. I'm seeing what the the
[1:20:58] world cannot see with their natural
[1:21:00] senses.
[1:21:02] I'm looking at the unseen. Can you say
[1:21:04] amen? But not only do I see Christ in in
[1:21:08] the message, I'm seeing the message is
[1:21:10] in me. Christ in me, the hope of glory.
[1:21:15] Amen. Now notice, so if we live close to
[1:21:19] him, now that's what we want to do. We
[1:21:21] want to live close to him. Amen.
[1:21:24] God help us. He'll provide something
[1:21:27] else for us. There's an insight that we
[1:21:30] can see what the ordinary person never
[1:21:33] sees. When we're born again, we see him.
[1:21:37] You know him. You have seen him. He will
[1:21:40] abide with you forever.
[1:21:43] Another place he says, "Now, when you
[1:21:45] receive the inspiration that Jesus
[1:21:47] Christ died for your sickness, it's that
[1:21:50] very hour that your healing has come.
[1:21:53] Hallelujah.
[1:21:55] See, so you're looking at the unseen by
[1:21:58] inspiration,
[1:22:00] not by feeling. You don't have to feel
[1:22:02] good.
[1:22:04] You don't You don't have to have the
[1:22:05] symptoms to tell you that you're well.
[1:22:08] You could have every symptom that tells
[1:22:09] you you're going to die. The doctor can
[1:22:12] say you're going to die. You feel like
[1:22:14] you're going to die.
[1:22:17] Your body's telling you you ain't going
[1:22:19] to live any longer. Amen. But when you
[1:22:22] receive the inspiration that Christ died
[1:22:25] for your sickness, that very hour, your
[1:22:29] healing has come. That's right. When you
[1:22:32] receive from heaven that Christ died for
[1:22:35] your sins and you have accepted it, you
[1:22:38] don't need any prayer for you, then
[1:22:40] you've already accepted it. It's
[1:22:43] settled.
[1:22:44] Why? You're looking at the unseen.
[1:22:47] Praise the Lord. Can you say amen?
[1:22:49] Hallelujah. Oh yeah. Christ died. Now
[1:22:52] Christ died to make the unseen a
[1:22:54] reality.
[1:22:56] Do you believe that? Amen. He died to
[1:22:59] make the unseen a reality. You don't
[1:23:02] have to be in heaven to believe in
[1:23:04] heaven. I believe in heaven before I get
[1:23:06] there. You don't have to receive a body
[1:23:08] change to believe in a body change. I
[1:23:10] believe the body change is coming.
[1:23:14] It's a reality. The unseen has become a
[1:23:17] reality to me. Praise God. It's It's
[1:23:21] more real than you sitting right here.
[1:23:22] It's more real than this pulpit. Amen.
[1:23:25] The unseen is more real than what I'm
[1:23:27] feeling right now. The unseen is more
[1:23:30] real. Amen. Than what I'm I'm I'm
[1:23:32] seeing.
[1:23:35] What this old body is telling me. Amen.
[1:23:38] You understand what I'm saying? The
[1:23:39] unseen is greater than your sins. The
[1:23:42] unseen is greater than your failures.
[1:23:45] Praise the Lord. That's right. Yes, sir.
[1:23:48] See, so you've already accepted it. Now
[1:23:50] he says, "Now we can preach the word,
[1:23:52] explain the word, but you have to
[1:23:55] receive the word." So here the mighty
[1:23:59] angel has come down with an open book.
[1:24:01] The seventh angel has revealed the the
[1:24:03] mysteries of the book.
[1:24:06] Can you say amen? But now we have to
[1:24:09] accept it.
[1:24:11] True. Yes, sir. We have to accept the uh
[1:24:16] accept the receive the word. Oh,
[1:24:19] hallelujah. That's what sets it a fire,
[1:24:21] brother. When you receive it, the
[1:24:24] revelation, something slips out of the
[1:24:27] unseen world yonder comes rolling down
[1:24:30] through a mystical channel somewhere
[1:24:32] into your soul that says, "I see it."
[1:24:39] That's what has to happen is when now
[1:24:41] now the prophet preached and uh what is
[1:24:43] it the uh the the future home of the
[1:24:46] heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[1:24:47] bride. He priested and there's somebody
[1:24:51] that's going to receive it. Somebody
[1:24:53] that receives that word and something
[1:24:56] wrong comes rolling from the unseen down
[1:24:58] in a mystical channel down into that
[1:25:01] soul that says I see it.
[1:25:05] I see it. How many sees it? I see it.
[1:25:08] Don't have to wonder about it no more. I
[1:25:10] see it. I don't have to guess that. I
[1:25:12] don't have to say, "Well, I sure wished
[1:25:14] I could get there. I sure hope I'm
[1:25:15] there." No, I see myself.
[1:25:21] That's right. Amen. He said, "Your eyes
[1:25:24] brighten, your lips that hung down,
[1:25:26] straighten up, and smile. Every muscle
[1:25:29] in your body seems to rejoice.
[1:25:31] Something's going to happen." Yeah. He
[1:25:34] said, "You don't need to be in a prayer
[1:25:35] line." Then you've already got it. You
[1:25:38] got it then. Can you say amen? So now,
[1:25:43] as we look and and not to keep you much
[1:25:45] longer, but in our opening scripture,
[1:25:48] Paul tells us that there are things that
[1:25:50] can be seen and there are things that
[1:25:53] cannot be seen. Some the things that are
[1:25:57] seen, he says, are temporal and the
[1:26:00] things that are unseen are eternal.
[1:26:05] Ain't that right? The things that are
[1:26:08] temporal, well, it it it that that means
[1:26:11] they they have only a set time. They
[1:26:14] have a limited time. They're here today,
[1:26:17] gone tomorrow. They have no lasting
[1:26:20] value.
[1:26:23] Ain't that right? But yet the things
[1:26:26] that cannot be seen are eternal, which
[1:26:29] means they will never leave. They will
[1:26:31] never be taken away.
[1:26:35] The Bible says, "Forever, oh Lord, thy
[1:26:37] word is settled in the heavens." Then
[1:26:40] that must be that that's what cannot be
[1:26:43] seen. That's the eternal things.
[1:26:45] Everything else that can be seen with
[1:26:47] this natural senses, natural eye, and
[1:26:50] all of these things are just temporal.
[1:26:53] Money, it's temporal. Politics is
[1:26:56] temporal.
[1:27:00] Are you with me now? Amen. Your your
[1:27:02] your your sickness is temporal.
[1:27:06] Oh yes, sir. I've said it before. Say it
[1:27:08] again. There's things about you, Amen,
[1:27:10] that are temporal.
[1:27:14] Amen. There's things about you that are
[1:27:16] just temporal. They're not meant to
[1:27:17] last. They're not meant to remain.
[1:27:20] If it was meant to remain, then God
[1:27:21] would have never provided an atonement
[1:27:24] to take away your sins.
[1:27:29] If if God meant for you to remain a
[1:27:31] sinner, then he would have never done
[1:27:33] nothing to change you. But if he changed
[1:27:36] you, if he filled you with the Holy
[1:27:38] Ghost, it's because there's something
[1:27:40] that is eternal
[1:27:42] and and and being a sinner is not
[1:27:45] eternal.
[1:27:46] Right? Are you with me now? Amen. Yes,
[1:27:49] sir. If his blood ever got got you, if
[1:27:53] he's ever loosed you. Now, that's what
[1:27:55] the blood is. It's not just washing you
[1:27:57] as just erasing your sins, you know, a
[1:28:00] little black spot, but he's loosed you.
[1:28:04] You're loosed from them sins. Can you
[1:28:07] say amen? See, so then the believers
[1:28:11] only look at the things that cannot be
[1:28:13] seen. Right?
[1:28:15] We confess, put our confession in those
[1:28:19] that things that cannot be seen. They're
[1:28:22] eternal.
[1:28:26] All of us have an outward man and an
[1:28:28] inward man. You know, the the prophet
[1:28:32] talked about it. The outward man is our
[1:28:33] physical body. It's the thing that
[1:28:37] backslides. It's it's the it's the thing
[1:28:40] that always has its ups and downs.
[1:28:45] Hello.
[1:28:47] Now, we have to fight that old flesh. We
[1:28:49] have to deal with it every day. Amen.
[1:28:51] It's a thorn.
[1:28:54] That old sticky nature
[1:28:57] always remains with us. It's what it it
[1:29:00] it you know, sometimes it feels good,
[1:29:02] other times it don't. Most of the time
[1:29:04] it don't.
[1:29:07] Sometimes it feel like praising God, but
[1:29:10] most of the time it doesn't. True. For
[1:29:13] one reason, every reason or another, it
[1:29:15] just doesn't feel like going to church.
[1:29:19] That's why most people don't go to
[1:29:21] church these days. Amen.
[1:29:24] It's that old flesh. Brother Bram even
[1:29:27] talked about it. The old flesh. He said,
[1:29:29] "I didn't want to come to church
[1:29:30] tonight." And one one one service that
[1:29:33] he was talking about, he said, "I didn't
[1:29:34] I didn't want to come to church. My old
[1:29:36] flesh was telling me, you're too tired.
[1:29:37] You're not feeling good. You're this."
[1:29:39] He said, "Right now," he said, "I'm I'm
[1:29:40] standing here, you know, gripping the
[1:29:42] pulpit and and my toes squeezed in my
[1:29:44] shoes." He said, "I I'm feeling I'm
[1:29:47] feeling horrible." But but he said, "My
[1:29:49] flesh just didn't want to." I said, "But
[1:29:50] old flesh, we we going to go to church."
[1:29:53] We're just going to go church. Can you
[1:29:56] say amen? See, old flesh, it just want
[1:29:58] it just it's just carnal.
[1:30:02] Ain't that right? That old flesh, that
[1:30:04] outward man, it's affected by everything
[1:30:05] that's out here.
[1:30:09] True.
[1:30:12] Because it's operated by the five kernel
[1:30:14] senses. Taste, feel, hear, smell, sight.
[1:30:18] Sometimes your five senses agree with
[1:30:20] the word, but most often it
[1:30:23] doesn't. But the prophet said when they
[1:30:25] disagree with the word, you have to
[1:30:28] ignore it. So you have to ignore what
[1:30:31] this old flesh is telling you. Amen.
[1:30:34] Sometimes it'll it'll lead you to feel
[1:30:36] like you're saved. Other times it'll
[1:30:38] lead you to feel like you're not. Yeah.
[1:30:42] Right. That old outward man, see that
[1:30:46] old outward man, it always reasons with
[1:30:48] the word of God. The prophet said it's
[1:30:51] the inward man is what counts.
[1:30:54] See, the outward man is carnal. It's
[1:30:57] looking with its eyes, the natural eyes,
[1:31:00] hearing with what the natural says.
[1:31:04] You know, someone talks about Yeah. You
[1:31:06] know, oh y'all flesh wants to rise up
[1:31:12] and but see the inward man is
[1:31:16] spiritual and it looks through the eyes
[1:31:19] of faith.
[1:31:21] That's the super
[1:31:23] sense. The eye of faith.
[1:31:26] Through the eye of faith, we're looking
[1:31:28] at the unseen.
[1:31:32] Ain't that right now? We're going to be
[1:31:35] led by one of these two
[1:31:37] persons. Either by the outward man or
[1:31:39] the inward man. You're going to be led
[1:31:42] all your life. You're going to be led.
[1:31:45] You'll either be led by your flesh, that
[1:31:47] outward man that that that reasons the
[1:31:49] word of God that explains to why you
[1:31:51] don't need to come to church and why you
[1:31:53] don't need to pray and why you're a
[1:31:56] failure. And it explains away the
[1:31:58] promises of God to to to where you know
[1:32:01] you you you might as well not even
[1:32:03] expect anything from God because look at
[1:32:06] you.
[1:32:08] Can you say amen?
[1:32:10] If we listen to that outward man, it
[1:32:12] will talk us out of a
[1:32:14] rapture. It'll explain why we can't make
[1:32:16] it in a rapture and why heaven isn't for
[1:32:19] us and and why we're just we might as
[1:32:21] well just go out and be like everybody
[1:32:23] else. But that inward man says, "No, no,
[1:32:26] no, no. We we we're not like that. We
[1:32:30] it." That inward man is what is born of
[1:32:33] God.
[1:32:35] Can you say amen? Now, Brother Brandham
[1:32:38] says, "The outward man is
[1:32:40] self." Oh,
[1:32:42] self. Man, it's so easy to pet self,
[1:32:45] right?
[1:32:46] Amen. So, not only is there five senses,
[1:32:50] you know, of the body, then there's five
[1:32:52] senses of of the inward spirit,
[1:32:56] imagination, conscience, memory,
[1:32:58] affection, reasoning. Ain't that right?
[1:33:01] We all know these things, but get down
[1:33:03] to our hearts. And these five senses are
[1:33:07] are affected by the five senses of the
[1:33:09] flesh. You know, what you hear, it may
[1:33:12] trigger your memory of something that
[1:33:15] you've heard before.
[1:33:18] Right?
[1:33:19] It may trigger your imagination just by
[1:33:22] hearing something. Maybe you hear hear
[1:33:25] what someone said and and you thought
[1:33:27] you was over it and you thought maybe
[1:33:30] you know you you overcome you testified.
[1:33:33] I've overcome that bitterness. I've
[1:33:34] overcome and all of a sudden what you
[1:33:37] hear maybe from that person or so and so
[1:33:39] says and and all that all of a sudden it
[1:33:41] tries to that memory starts working and
[1:33:44] that bitterness tries to swell up again
[1:33:46] in your heart. Yeah,
[1:33:49] it may trigger reasoning. Well, you know
[1:33:52] that guy, you know, it may trigger
[1:33:54] whatever the things you look at. Sure.
[1:33:58] It it it'll trigger your affections.
[1:34:04] Some half-negged woman walk by by and
[1:34:08] you look at that, all of a sudden
[1:34:11] it'll start triggering affections.
[1:34:15] People think they're in love with half
[1:34:16] these women. They ain't in love. Amen.
[1:34:19] It's their affections.
[1:34:23] Come on now.
[1:34:26] So the things you look at, it may
[1:34:28] trigger reasoning or memory. The you
[1:34:30] know what you feel. It may trigger your
[1:34:33] affections and your your your
[1:34:36] imagination or your conscience or
[1:34:38] whatever. See, but that's the senses of
[1:34:40] this outward man.
[1:34:42] But the inward man is the soul of man.
[1:34:46] And the prophet said in there is either
[1:34:48] faith or doubt. That's right. And you
[1:34:51] will be controlled by either faith or
[1:34:53] doubt.
[1:34:54] Amen.
[1:34:56] The prophet said the soul is where the
[1:34:58] control tower is. Ain't that
[1:35:01] right? So then if faith is there, then
[1:35:04] what does it do? It controls your entire
[1:35:07] being. Amen. It it it'll be the one that
[1:35:10] controls it. If doubt is in there, it'll
[1:35:12] be the one to control your whole being.
[1:35:15] But notice 2 Corinthians 5:7, we walk by
[1:35:18] faith. Everybody say, "We walk by
[1:35:21] faith." We walk by faith and not by
[1:35:25] sight. We don't walk by memory. We don't
[1:35:28] walk by feeling. We don't walk by
[1:35:30] affection. We only walk by faith.
[1:35:35] Amen.
[1:35:38] Hebrews 10:38. Now the just shall live
[1:35:40] by faith. Everybody say it with me. The
[1:35:42] just shall live by faith. The just shall
[1:35:46] live by faith. But if any man draw back,
[1:35:48] my soul shall not have any pleasure in
[1:35:50] him. But we are not of them who draw
[1:35:53] back unto predition, but of them that
[1:35:57] believe to the saving of the soul.
[1:36:01] Now, as I get ready to
[1:36:04] close, we know that faith doesn't just
[1:36:08] happen to exist inside of you. And and
[1:36:12] I'm talking about the type of faith I'm
[1:36:14] talking about is a different faith than
[1:36:17] just believing in going to the store and
[1:36:19] getting an ice cream cone or you know it
[1:36:21] it's a faith but it's a different faith.
[1:36:24] It's a divine faith. Now now notice
[1:36:26] brother Brown said you got to get the
[1:36:28] man right in his heart first before he
[1:36:31] can believe cuz he ain't got nothing to
[1:36:33] believe on. He ain't got nothing to
[1:36:34] believe with. Another place a person has
[1:36:37] to be ordained of God to believe or
[1:36:39] they'll never believe anyhow. Amen. No
[1:36:41] matter what the word says, no matter how
[1:36:43] much preaching goes forth, it will never
[1:36:46] affect that person if there's nothing in
[1:36:48] there to believe. True, brother. Can you
[1:36:51] say amen? See, we preach the promises of
[1:36:53] God not not to get you
[1:36:55] excited. That's good. But it's not
[1:36:58] there. It's for you to look at the
[1:37:01] unseen. The promises are the eternal
[1:37:04] things. It it it has more dominance.
[1:37:07] It's greater than your feelings and your
[1:37:09] your sensation. It it's just it's
[1:37:11] greater than everything about you.
[1:37:15] Amen. The promises of God. Ain't that
[1:37:18] right? Amen. So he says, see, a person
[1:37:21] has to be ordained of God to believe or
[1:37:23] they'll never believe. They have nothing
[1:37:24] to believe with. They just don't know
[1:37:25] the depths of their soul. They don't
[1:37:28] have no depths of their soul. Acts 13:48
[1:37:32] says, "As many as were ordained believed
[1:37:35] or uh ordained to eternal life
[1:37:38] believed." Brother Brandham said, "I'm
[1:37:39] not one of these persons to persuade. If
[1:37:42] the word can't move it, see if the word
[1:37:45] can't do it, there's no point in
[1:37:47] persuading, trying to persuade. You can
[1:37:50] only do it as you're pred predestinated
[1:37:52] to believe it." And you remember,
[1:37:54] although Jesus done so many miracles,
[1:37:56] the Pharisees couldn't believe it. They
[1:37:58] couldn't get it in their head because
[1:38:00] that they wasn't to be that way. Ain't
[1:38:03] that right? Again, another place. Your
[1:38:06] physical contacts the physical. Your
[1:38:09] spiritual contacts the spiritual. But
[1:38:11] inside of that, you got a soul. And that
[1:38:14] soul is that gene that come from God.
[1:38:19] So, can I say it here? You are what you
[1:38:22] are. Not by your flesh, but by what's in
[1:38:26] your soul. Amen. You are what you are by
[1:38:28] what's in your soul. Can you say amen?
[1:38:32] So the Bible says as a man thinkketh in
[1:38:35] his heart so is he.
[1:38:38] Ain't that right, brother Brown? You
[1:38:41] know, talking about that scripture, he
[1:38:42] says, you know, the critics used to say
[1:38:44] that man doesn't have any mental faculty
[1:38:47] in his heart and they said the scripture
[1:38:49] was wrong. Amen. you know, and and all
[1:38:52] that. But then they found out that man
[1:38:54] does have a little compartment in his
[1:38:56] heart that's empty. Doesn't have a blood
[1:38:58] cell in it. See, it doesn't have a cell
[1:39:00] in it. Brother Brandham said that is the
[1:39:02] soul. It's of man. It's it's not found
[1:39:05] in animal life. It's it's only found in
[1:39:08] the human body. And the prophet said God
[1:39:10] made this compartment in the heart of
[1:39:12] man so that he could lead man.
[1:39:17] Can you say amen? Amen. You you're going
[1:39:19] to have your five senses that's going to
[1:39:21] try to lead you. You're and and you're
[1:39:23] going to have your flesh that's going to
[1:39:24] try to lead you. That God rich in mercy
[1:39:27] created something down in your soul that
[1:39:31] he could come in and direct you by his
[1:39:35] word. Can you say amen? By his word.
[1:39:39] That's good. Amen.
[1:39:42] Now notice if God is in the soul then as
[1:39:46] we know God believes his own word
[1:39:49] right he never doubts his own word. He
[1:39:52] believed in it. He believed it in the
[1:39:55] beginning. He believed that when he said
[1:39:57] let there be light there would be light.
[1:39:59] He believed in it. He's always believed
[1:40:02] his word.
[1:40:04] Amen.
[1:40:06] Well, same is it if God comes in you,
[1:40:09] then he takes that word and he believes
[1:40:11] in it. So therefore, the just shall live
[1:40:14] by faith. The faith that we live by is
[1:40:16] God's own faith. God in you believing
[1:40:20] his own word. Christ revealed the faith
[1:40:23] of God living in that soul. He's having
[1:40:27] preeminence over our body. He's having
[1:40:29] the preeminence over our mind. He's
[1:40:31] having preeminence over our home. He's
[1:40:34] having preeminence over everything.
[1:40:36] Amen. Therefore, Satan cannot talk us
[1:40:38] out of the promise of God. We believe in
[1:40:41] the promise. No matter how hard, how
[1:40:44] difficult, how impossible, God says it.
[1:40:47] I believe it. That settles it.
[1:40:51] Can you say amen? We're looking at the
[1:40:55] unseen.
[1:40:57] God doesn't just anoint you with his
[1:40:59] Holy
[1:41:00] Spirit. Amen.
[1:41:04] But he comes and lives in that
[1:41:05] compartment.
[1:41:07] Can you say amen? Now notice he says
[1:41:11] when your faith comes from out of the
[1:41:13] intellectual realm and the Holy Spirit
[1:41:16] puts in the soul and the heart, you
[1:41:18] won't even think about these things. You
[1:41:21] won't even think about the world. You
[1:41:23] won't even think about impossibilities.
[1:41:24] You just won't think about it, church.
[1:41:27] And that's where God's trying to get us
[1:41:28] to.
[1:41:30] Are you with me? That's where God's
[1:41:33] trying to get us to. Quit looking at the
[1:41:35] negative.
[1:41:39] Don't worry about the things you can't
[1:41:41] change. Look at the word, the promise,
[1:41:44] the unseen things.
[1:41:49] He said, see, you won't even think about
[1:41:50] these things. In other words, in other
[1:41:52] words, you ain't going to reason these
[1:41:53] things
[1:41:54] out. Well, now let's see. You know, it
[1:41:57] said the doctor said this, mother said
[1:41:59] this, and dad said this, the pastor said
[1:42:01] this. See, you you you ain't reasoning
[1:42:03] about all
[1:42:05] that. You don't care about all that.
[1:42:07] You're looking at what God said
[1:42:10] because God now has the preeminence and
[1:42:13] he's revealing to you what is unseen.
[1:42:16] Divine healing is a revelation. The
[1:42:19] rapture is a revelation to the bride.
[1:42:21] Everything is a revelation.
[1:42:23] your own victory in your life is a
[1:42:25] revelation. If you could get a
[1:42:27] revelation, that victory is yours. Then
[1:42:30] you won't worry about your failures.
[1:42:32] You'll look at the unseen and say, "But
[1:42:34] I am victorious."
[1:42:36] God's word says so. And God in you
[1:42:39] believes his own word.
[1:42:42] That's good.
[1:42:44] So he says, "You won't try to see
[1:42:46] nothing. Only thing you know that it's
[1:42:48] going to happen regardless of who says
[1:42:50] it's not." That's it. See, it's in the
[1:42:53] heart. God puts it in there. There it
[1:42:55] is. When God puts it in there, all the
[1:42:58] devils out of torment will never move
[1:43:00] it. If you were laying, dying, grasping,
[1:43:05] or gasping your breath, the death
[1:43:07] rattles in your throat, 50 doctors
[1:43:09] standing around saying, "He's going out
[1:43:12] to God in the next 5 minutes. He's
[1:43:14] leaving now." And down in your heart,
[1:43:18] you believe Jesus Christ has healed you.
[1:43:20] that wouldn't bother you a bit. Just as
[1:43:24] sure as there's a God in heaven, you
[1:43:26] would come out of it. Hallelujah.
[1:43:31] Why? You're looking at something that's
[1:43:34] unseen. The doctors can't see it. The
[1:43:36] doctor's looking at the machines.
[1:43:38] They're looking at what they know, but
[1:43:40] you're looking at the unseen. God said
[1:43:43] so. Bless the Lord. Praise the Lord. You
[1:43:47] love him. Amen.
[1:43:54] He said, see, he says now, he said, 'You
[1:43:56] had come out of it. Yes, sir. Cuz God's
[1:43:58] duty bound. God's got to keep his word.
[1:44:01] And you'll never know what is Christ or
[1:44:03] what is the word until first the Holy
[1:44:05] Spirit has personally revealed it to you
[1:44:07] in your heart. Then you know that Jesus
[1:44:10] is Lord when your heart says so. Not
[1:44:13] when your knowledge says so, but when
[1:44:15] your heart says so. That's when you know
[1:44:17] it. Can you say amen?
[1:44:19] You love him.
[1:44:21] I love him.
[1:44:24] You know, I think of my my dad
[1:44:30] and he's fought this Parkinson's
[1:44:33] and got to the point where he couldn't
[1:44:36] walk just, you know, it was well, he was
[1:44:39] in his chair having happened to have his
[1:44:41] chair around. He's fallen so many
[1:44:44] times and
[1:44:46] uh you know now he's been on oxygen
[1:44:50] uh his oxygen being in the 70s I think
[1:44:53] or 60s and supposed to be 95 or 97 and
[1:44:58] up and
[1:45:01] so you know but dad's always been this
[1:45:03] man of faith
[1:45:04] and he was you know uh telling today you
[1:45:09] know that Wendle had called him And he
[1:45:12] well first of all he said the Lord's
[1:45:14] just been dealing with him that he needs
[1:45:15] to just stretch his faith out
[1:45:18] more.
[1:45:21] And and Wendell called him up and said,
[1:45:24] "Dad, I'm believing for your healing."
[1:45:27] He said, "Uh, I want you to sing tonight
[1:45:30] in service." Now, Dad says, "I didn't
[1:45:33] feel like singing. Didn't want to
[1:45:35] sing. I was too weak to sing."
[1:45:40] They said, 'I knew the Lord had been
[1:45:41] dealing with me to stretch your faith
[1:45:43] out. And so he says, I I I told him I'll
[1:45:46] do it. I didn't didn't even know how he
[1:45:48] was going to do it. I mean, he's got
[1:45:50] he's on oxygen and he's, you know, and
[1:45:55] but he done it. He he he gave it his
[1:45:58] all. Gave it his best
[1:46:01] singing. And we saw him down there and
[1:46:05] uh we stayed at an Airbnb with him and
[1:46:08] mom
[1:46:09] and walking without a
[1:46:12] cane, talking clearly.
[1:46:17] Energy like he hadn't had in years.
[1:46:21] Praise the Lord. No oxygen. Praise the
[1:46:24] Lord. He said, "My heart or my oxygen is
[1:46:28] 97." It's it's staying at 97. He said he
[1:46:32] just went from Oklahoma to Ohio. He's in
[1:46:35] Ohio right
[1:46:36] now and uh said, "I'm feeling great." He
[1:46:41] says, "I'm believing God's going to just
[1:46:44] take me all the way." You know, but what
[1:46:47] we see is miracles. What we're seeing is
[1:46:49] progress. What we're seeing is faith.
[1:46:51] He's looking at the unseen.
[1:46:54] The doctors have told him, "You've got
[1:46:55] the worst case of Parkinson's. The first
[1:46:58] thing that's going to go is your humor."
[1:47:00] He ain't lost his
[1:47:02] humor. And everything that they tell him
[1:47:04] that he's going to
[1:47:06] lose, he still has.
[1:47:10] But that's see that that it has nothing
[1:47:13] to do with feelings. It has nothing to
[1:47:15] do with, you know, where we're at. He's
[1:47:17] not looking at the condition,
[1:47:20] not looking at the impossibility, not
[1:47:23] looking at the fact that other people
[1:47:24] have died and and the doctors are
[1:47:26] probably 100 or 99% right and never been
[1:47:29] wrong. But but see, God can make them
[1:47:31] wrong. By that one case, by his own
[1:47:35] faith. Amen. Can you say amen? 50
[1:47:39] musicians will come.
[1:47:41] I think it's of that story of that uh
[1:47:44] sister that uh I can't remember it Beth
[1:47:47] something but she had uh bone
[1:47:50] cancer and she gives her testimony at
[1:47:53] brother Biscos
[1:47:55] and all the suffering and all the pain
[1:47:58] all the things that she had to go
[1:48:00] through and it it was
[1:48:03] horrible and there she is so weak and so
[1:48:06] but she just kept confessing God's my
[1:48:08] healer God's my healer
[1:48:10] Yes. And when it come all down to it,
[1:48:13] her final test, the doctor told her,
[1:48:15] "You're you're you're you're
[1:48:17] cancer-free." And they told her, "There
[1:48:19] is only a
[1:48:21] 0.0000 whatever 1% chance." Says, "Every
[1:48:27] person that has had your disease have
[1:48:30] died." He said, "But now we have to make
[1:48:33] an exception for you." Hallelujah to
[1:48:35] God. And I thought, "That's right." When
[1:48:37] you're looking at the unseen,
[1:48:39] You're not looking at what you're
[1:48:40] feeling. You're not looking at the
[1:48:41] circumstance. You're not looking at the
[1:48:43] symptoms. We are looking at the
[1:48:46] unseen. Oh God, reveal it to us tonight.
[1:48:50] Can you say amen? Praise the Lord. Do
[1:48:53] you love him? Can you lift your hands
[1:48:54] unto the Lord and just worship him?
[1:48:57] Thank you, Lord. Bless the name of the
[1:48:59] Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[1:49:02] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:49:05] Oh, if you young people could see the
[1:49:09] unseen, could see what you are in God,
[1:49:13] could see
[1:49:15] that, oh, heaven is for you, the rapture
[1:49:18] is for
[1:49:20] you. I know Satan makes us all feel like
[1:49:23] we're failures. And Satan makes us feel
[1:49:25] like we're all just doing this in vain.
[1:49:28] And if he could talk us out of it, we
[1:49:31] wouldn't believe in a God. We wouldn't
[1:49:33] believe in nothing. But we've already
[1:49:35] got a glimpse of the unseen. We're
[1:49:37] looking at the unseen. And we see that
[1:49:39] God is alive. We see that God is real.
[1:49:42] We see that God is moving. We see that
[1:49:46] God is powerful. That he reigns on high.
[1:49:49] We see ourselves in him. Hallelujah.
[1:49:52] We're as that boy looking in the mirror.
[1:49:54] Mama, that's me. We're looking at
[1:49:57] something that cannot be seen with the
[1:49:59] natural eye, but we know. We know we're
[1:50:02] part of it. We're in the promise. We're
[1:50:04] in the book. We're our name is written
[1:50:06] in the book. We're not guessing. We're
[1:50:09] not probing at it anymore. It's
[1:50:11] something that belongs to us. Every
[1:50:14] promise is in him is yay and
[1:50:17] amen. It belongs to us. Hallelujah. What
[1:50:21] song?
[1:50:23] the
[1:50:26] glory and the
[1:50:30] honor. Lord, we lift up holy
[1:50:35] hands in reverence to your
[1:50:39] name. You are
[1:50:42] great. Your miracles so
[1:50:46] great. There is no one else like
[1:50:50] you. Hallelujah.
[1:50:53] There is no one else like you. For you
[1:50:57] are
[1:50:59] great. You do miracles so
[1:51:03] great. There is no one else like
[1:51:09] you. There is no one
[1:51:14] else like you.
[1:51:18] Oh, you deserve the
[1:51:22] glory and the
[1:51:26] honor, Lord. We lift up. How can we lift
[1:51:31] up holy
[1:51:32] hands? He's made us
[1:51:35] worthy. He deserves the
[1:51:39] glory and the honor.
[1:51:44] Lord, we bow our hearts before
[1:51:48] you and magnify your name. For you are
[1:51:54] great. You do miracles so
[1:51:58] great. There is no one else like you. Do
[1:52:02] you believe
[1:52:04] it? There is no one else like you. For
[1:52:09] you are great.
[1:52:12] You do miracles so
[1:52:15] great. There is no one else like
[1:52:21] you. There is no one else like you. Of
[1:52:28] course, oh you are
[1:52:32] great manifested in this age.
[1:52:37] There is no one else like
[1:52:41] you. There is no one else like you. For
[1:52:46] you're the
[1:52:48] lamb that was slain before the
[1:52:53] world. Worthy to
[1:52:58] redeem. Oh, you're
[1:53:01] worthy
[1:53:02] to redeem.
[1:53:06] Oh, you are the
[1:53:09] word revealed in this
[1:53:13] age. Oh, you're changing us
[1:53:18] into oh the image of your son. You are
[1:53:24] the
[1:53:25] light that has opened up our
[1:53:29] eyes. Now we see ourselves in you.
[1:53:35] Do you see
[1:53:37] yourself? Don't look at your failure.
[1:53:39] Don't look at your mistake. Don't look
[1:53:41] at what you
[1:53:42] feel. Look at what you are in
[1:53:45] him. Hallelujah. Look at the unseen
[1:53:50] tonight. Oh my. Yes, you may be in a
[1:53:53] situation of
[1:53:55] impossibilities. The family may be
[1:53:57] falling apart. Everything might be going
[1:54:00] wrong. But if you just look to
[1:54:02] him, there's
[1:54:05] promises.
[1:54:07] Hallelujah. Elves in
[1:54:11] you. Oh, we see
[1:54:15] ourselves in
[1:54:21] you. Oh, isn't he
[1:54:24] wonderful? Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:54:27] Hallelujah.
[1:54:30] Amen. Amen. Amen. There's that little
[1:54:34] song. Uh, and we
[1:54:37] all
[1:54:39] bow down. I don't know whatever key we
[1:54:45] see and we
[1:54:48] all
[1:54:50] bow down.
[1:54:54] [Music]
[1:54:58] their
[1:55:01] crowns and
[1:55:06] worship
[1:55:09] Jesus. For he is the
[1:55:13] love, the unfailing
[1:55:18] love. He is the love of God.
[1:55:25] All now princes and
[1:55:29] poppers, sons and
[1:55:33] daughters, kneel at the throne of
[1:55:40] grace. Oh winners and
[1:55:45] losers, the saints and
[1:55:48] sinners. Oh, one day we'll see his face.
[1:55:56] And we
[1:55:58] all bow
[1:56:02] [Music]
[1:56:03] down. Yes, kings will
[1:56:07] surrender their
[1:56:09] [Applause]
[1:56:11] crown and

[1:56:23] worship
[1:56:27] Jesus for he is the
[1:56:31] love unfailing
[1:56:35] love. He is the
[1:56:38] love. Second
[1:56:41] verse. Oh yes. Summer and
[1:56:46] winter. The mountains and
[1:56:50] rivers whisper our
[1:56:54] Savior's
[1:56:57] name. Oh, he's awesome and
[1:57:01] holy, a friend to the
[1:57:05] lowly. Forever his love will
[1:57:12] rain and we
[1:57:15] all bow.
[1:57:19] Yes, we
[1:57:22] do.
[1:57:24] Hold their
[1:57:28] crown and
[1:57:32] worship
[1:57:33] Jesus. Sing that again. Oh, we
[1:57:39] worship Jes. Sing it one more time. We
[1:57:47] worship
[1:57:50] Jesus for he is the
[1:57:55] love unfailing
[1:57:58] love. He is the
[1:58:02] love of
[1:58:05] God. God bless you saints is our prayer.
[1:58:10] Remember to look to the
[1:58:12] unseen. No matter what the day holds, no
[1:58:17] matter what you go through, God's word
[1:58:19] is right. God's word is
[1:58:23] true. And may God just keep revealing it
[1:58:26] to us more and more to where the unseen
[1:58:30] becomes more real to us than what is
[1:58:32] seen. For that's the only thing that is
[1:58:36] eternal. Amen. and may God be with you.
[1:58:40] We want to remember um of course service
[1:58:43] Sunday at
[1:58:44] 11:00, but uh also we're going to be
[1:58:47] setting up the
[1:58:49] tent. Um as we have announced it, it uh
[1:58:54] they're going to let us set it up on
[1:58:56] Sunday. I think it's April
[1:58:58] [Music]
[1:59:00] 13th, if I got that right. Is it April
[1:59:03] 13th?
[1:59:07] um Sunday after church. So, it'll be a
[1:59:10] week from this coming
[1:59:13] Sunday and um so any of you brothers
[1:59:16] that would love to help and uh we we
[1:59:21] would sure appreciate the help and um I
[1:59:25] know the first time we set that thing
[1:59:27] up, it was it was uh it it was a chore,
[1:59:31] but last year, our second time setting
[1:59:33] it up, man, it just went really well.
[1:59:37] and uh brother Tim uh he just he got us
[1:59:41] all lined up and I mean it was just
[1:59:43] really wonderful. So I know he's been
[1:59:45] studying it and um so he will he'll be
[1:59:49] ready to get put us to work and and and
[1:59:53] so I think I believe it'll go a lot
[1:59:55] easier than than the first time or the
[1:59:58] last time. So but looking forward to it.
[2:00:01] got a lot of uh folks that are planning
[2:00:04] to come and uh just really looking for a
[2:00:08] move of God and you know as well as I
[2:00:11] know it's nothing that we've had to do.
[2:00:14] It's it's not our it's nothing that we
[2:00:18] could have made it successful. It's God
[2:00:20] that has done the work and and I really
[2:00:24] thank the Lord for it and he has just
[2:00:27] moved in every year uh filling with the
[2:00:31] Holy Ghost bringing
[2:00:33] deliverances setting the people free and
[2:00:36] captive free. And we've gotten so many
[2:00:39] testimonies supernatural from our
[2:00:42] meetings. And of course this year for
[2:00:45] some reason, Satan has just been
[2:00:47] fighting on every hand.
[2:00:50] Uh places that we've things that we've
[2:00:54] used depended upon in certain areas.
[2:00:57] They're cutting us off. And so we've
[2:01:00] been having to scrge, you know, uh,
[2:01:04] however that word is, rush around and
[2:01:07] trying to
[2:01:09] find places and, uh, where we usually
[2:01:13] put, you know, take ministers to eat or,
[2:01:17] uh, just just so different things. For
[2:01:19] some reason, this year,
[2:01:21] uh, it's been a challenge, but God's
[2:01:24] working it out. Now we got Sister Kim,
[2:01:28] you know, she's u been in charge of the
[2:01:32] cooking and all and uh I got to talk to
[2:01:35] her if she's even going to be able to to
[2:01:37] be able to do it with her knees the way
[2:01:40] they are. We want to really keep her in
[2:01:42] our prayer. She's, you know, it's bone
[2:01:44] on bone and um they won't give her
[2:01:47] another shot.
[2:01:49] Um, so she she has to wait till after
[2:01:53] April to have surgery and uh so you know
[2:01:57] she's got a lot of challenges in her
[2:01:59] life and I know her heart's there and
[2:02:02] you know uh but I sure don't want to put
[2:02:05] her in
[2:02:07] in more pain than where she's at. So
[2:02:10] y'all just pray with us. We just need a
[2:02:13] lot of prayer. Uh, I believe the meeting
[2:02:15] is going to be great and um that's just
[2:02:19] why Satan is fighting. And you never
[2:02:21] know, this might be our last meeting
[2:02:23] that we have before the rapture. If so,
[2:02:25] that's great. I'm ready. I'm wanting to
[2:02:27] go and uh leave this whole world
[2:02:31] behind. Amen. So, God bless you. May you
[2:02:35] have a safe trip back home and keep
[2:02:38] those that are sick in prayer that the
[2:02:41] Lord will help. Amen. Brother Bill, do
[2:02:43] you want to dismiss us in prayer?
