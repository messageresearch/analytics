with that one but they've been working on it so amen because because of who you are I give you glory because of who you are I give you praise because of who you are I will lift my voice and say Lord I

and I worship you because of who you are sing that again Lord I worship you because of who you are aren't you glad that you can worship a god that is real so many people putting their Worship in many things that are corrupt and doesn't give them the true satisfaction in life amen but God has made himself so known to us and that we're not worshiping a figment of our imagination or really we're not worshiping the God of this age amen but we're worshiping the true and living God the musicians can be dismissed and it's good to have brother Steve sister Elizabeth here and uh just everyone I um really enjoyed the uh the songs the special brother Christian you got a good voice good guitar playing and and uh uh we appreciate brother Christian and uh getting to know him more and just a very uh respectful young man and uh you don't find that too too much these days but uh we appreciate brother Christian amen your parents raised you right and uh uh appreciate sister Brook's song as well and and uh but if you have your Bibles we're going to uh look at Psalms 91 and one praise the Lord Psalms 91 and one and we'll start at the first verse yeah he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my refuge in my Fortress my God in him will I trust surely he shall deliver thee From The Snare of the Fowler and from the noisome pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler amen let's just uh bow our heads in a word of prayer father we're so thankful for the opportunity to come once again into this place that we have set aside for your presence and Lord we're asking now that you would just come and speak to us Lord how we need you we need you more today than we ever have before and pray Lord that you help us to be more sincere and Lord toward you and your uh the things Lord of that you have father and pray that you would forgive us of all of our sins our failures Lord and bless the ministering of your word as well as the hearing now in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen and amen you can have your seats I don't really have a uh just a whole lot just a simple subject tonight and and um really didn't know how to title it I just put alone with God and um I guess just been uh just for me uh uh thinking here this week and but you know as um as Christians and uh we we we go through many things in life and and especially in this the age that we're living in it just seems like there's just uh everything uh that is uh there to challenge our faith challenge Our Testimony there to challenge our experience in God and um and you know just it's just a constant challenge of of of everything everywhere we turn there's always a challenge and and I'm sure you young people as well experien these things whether it be at school or um at at the job or whatever um there there are just so many spirits that are out there today and uh we are we are the uh minority a lot of people speak of minority well we we really truly are the minority and and uh um you know thinking of the preservation of how um you know that man has tried to preserve whether it be animals and because they've come close to extinction or trees you know thinking of uh you know uh Heather and I had uh years ago went uh up there to where them big old trees are redwood trees I guess what they call them huge trees and they they said you know that there were uh uh thousands of Acres of them and and uh the woodsmen started just cutting them down just left and right cutting them down you know and so someone went to the government and there was them you know the uh Tree Huggers or whatever and uh you know but they they fought for preservation of these trees which in one sense I'm glad they did so we got to see a tree that I you know huge and uh but uh uh there's there's lot of things that we're trying to preserve in this life but if if there's anything that preservation really means uh much in to us and that is Christian preservation that God uh uh didn't bring us this far to L us he didn't he didn't save us just to uh for us to go extinct but but God has a way of preserving and you know we we uh we Face challenges in our experience of being saved and and having the Holy Ghost and I think most of us probably go through certain things I know even brother Bram talks about how that he didn't at one point he felt like he just wasn't called to preach you know and he was going through a dry time a a testing time and or whatever you would want to call it but we all go through them and and uh even you know having the the holy Holy Ghost and it it doesn't you know we talk about being an invincible Army and and that's true but to prove that we we still go through challenges and we we just go through it doesn't take away our human Humanity so we have our ups and downs and a a man a person not realizing it can go through so much in life and in in different ways uh that he actually becomes hard he can become callous in his spirit and uh he can become numb to the things that uh uh uh that he goes through also we we have we're living in an age where there's just it's just hustle and bustle I think that's the right phrase that they would use just go go go go do do do do and it just seems like the moment we hit our feet Hit the Floor go go go you know went not enough hours in the day even though they're still the same 24 hours that it was when you know we didn't have the cars and the electric and all that but somehow it has made our world faster in our our just our lives uh faster and um and it's really just hard to catch up we just go go go go go and with that then we we have a uh a tendency to uh uh leave uh fellowship with God behind and um say a little prayer as we're eating a biscuit on the road you know or uh saying prayer you know as we're driving down the road getting to where we're going and it it's just you know it's it's it's a uh but unintentionally uh we leave off the true the true thing and that is fellowship with God we can even go to church we can we we can be a pastor preacher we can be musicians we can be diligent in the things of God and still leave off the main thing and that is fellowship with God and uh brother brandham even tells us that even as a pastor he said you pastors don't get too busy to where you can't take time for God and fellowship but we we we have these dry spells and um I think we all go through seasons in our life and um sometimes these seasons can can be long uh but uh church church each every Church goes through them uh families individuals Ministries uh we all go through our seasons of of droughts of seasons of of things but it's in these times that we really need the Lord and and we need to to to know that we have access to God in in these times and uh um it's it's not that we're lost even though Satan tries his best to convince us that we are or that we the experience that we've claimed to have isn't really wasn't really real and and so uh which he's he's he's he's just a liar but but we all we all need a renewing do you believe that we we all need a time a place of of renewing and this this word renew uh according to Webster is to make like new to restore to freshness and even though we we've got the message of the hour uh uh we still have times that we've got to just we just need that renewing uh with God and sometimes uh we can run out of steam if you want to say it that way I don't call it burnt out but I do I I think it's just seasons in our life that that you know uh uh sometimes you're on the mountain sometimes you're in the valley sometimes you're uh feel like you know your prayers are getting through sometimes you feel like your prayers are bouncing to the ceiling you know and and uh uh it it it's just all of these times but but a renewing and I I you know I I think as a church as just all of us as an individual we must not fail to to real realiz that that it's not that God has left us it's not that God is is done it's not that we've we've wored up in in you know on the bank so to speak but it's just that we need to take time to be renewed with God and we cannot life life daily situations must not control us because we are a different breed of people life will kill you the demands of life will kill you people will get so stressed out that they don't know what to do we we've got them taking nerve pills and taking all kinds of things and and it's because is is is life has put demands upon us that really shouldn't be and and I think it's just the condition of the world a lot of these things is coming from unregenerated people whether it be our boss that is demanding overtime constantly or whether it's just uh uh whether it's government or they're raising you know it's just seems like you can't get you can't get bills paid and and uh make ends meat seems and and I I think it's a I think there I think it's all whether whether they realize it or not I know that I believe it's the devil uh that is getting all this up uh trying to make where to where there's no home life anymore uh to where the woman has to get out and work can't have time for the children the children don't know what a home life is cuz Mom and Dad are just too busy and and and yet it seemed like the more people work uh the more stressful it gets and and which tells that money is not the answer uh vacations are not the answer uh nothing against any of that it's just not the answer uh not for a Christian because what what we're trying to do is preserve we're trying to preserve something we're trying to preserve that life that's within us just as much as as as you know uh so so uh uh the this thing of the world I I thought like brother brand I'm talking of uh very at at the time of Exodus for Moses well well Pharaoh started attacking the children we know that the little children then he put women to work and and it was just constantly he was attacking the people of God and and to where they were just so busy with things and church we're not of this world and and I I might not be too popular in what I'm saying tonight but uh I I still believe it I still believe that there's got to be family values I I still believe that there's Mar marriage values I I still believe that we've got to have time for one another I believe that we've got to be what God has called us to be do you believe that and and and uh but but when when when we're so stretched out again because we're trying to meet the demands of life then what do we do but more than anything it affects our Christian walk um you can you can go to church out of Duty and all of us have gone through these phases yes sir preach just because it's a duty play the music because it's just a duty we go through life sometimes and not even realizing what we're doing but then we find out that we're just needing something well it's not not that that again it's not that you're lost it's nothing there it's just we need that a renewing it's just a time that we need to get with God can you say man because this renewing comes comes by getting alone with God and and and it's it's a place of life that's what it is it's a place where where you know this this place that David was talking about it's a place where where corruption can't set in and take over I know these bodies are getting older but I'm talking about that Soul I'm I'm talking about a joy that can be sustained I'm I'm talking about a peace that can be sustained I'm I'm talking about that inner man that can actually just stay sustained through everything that we're going through yes amen this place that David uh uh spoke of is a sacred place it's a place where God God is and and brother brandom called called it a a hallow place a sacred place but it's also as I believe we read where David called it a secret place which means it's a hidden place and uh which tells us that nobody knows about this place unless they've been there whatever is in that place no one knows no one can uh uh can tell by experience unless they were in there to experience it and so and and no one can find it by itself themselves because it's a secret place that's exactly what David said it's a secret place ain't that right and so how many people have tried to find this place throughout the ages uh and and they sought and they've longed to have this place uh uh uh where God dwells this is the place where God dwells and and yet many many many people no matter how religious no matter how many schools and learning and and titles and all these things that they have and and yet no one no one can find this place it actually takes God bidding us to come now in in Psalm 65 and4 uh uh it says blessed is the man whom thou choosest now I did not give them scriptures ahead of time so they'll have to type it in but blessed is the man whom thou choosest and caus us to approach unto thee so now think of that God has to give the choosing God has to choose and he has to allow that man we we say pull that man uh put something in his heart or bid that man uh uh woo that man to come to him amen that's the only way that we'll find it sir that's the only people conf find it is when God chooses that individual and causes them to approach unto him that he may dwell in thy courts we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house that place even of thy Temple so those who are chosen have the opportunity to come into this secret place and dwell there dwell there now Old Testament uh the Old Testament was was types and shadows as as we know and uh so this the mo the Tabernacle of Moses comes to mind when I'm thinking of the secret place and uh uh you know he made this Tabernacle and it had three three sections it was the outer Court where all the congregation could dwell in and and there there were certain things that that was in in in that in that outer court but the light was the sunlight that came right brother Ram talks about it and how that uh uh you know some days were cloudy days some some days sunny days rainy days you know the weather fluctuated in the outer courts you know and and that was the where the majority of the people stayed was in the outer Court you know and they could not go in into this other section but then there was the Holy place where the priests were able to go into that Holy place and and there was the candles and there was certain things in there that they had to officiate and do but that light uh was candle light as as you know as we know and and and that place would get Smoky at times you know and and smoke up and and all that you probably you know as they're trying to officiate their their their their their jobs and their duties and things like that but then but then there was the Veil and then beyond that veil was the the holiest of holies and and that was only a certain person a chosen person could go be in that place and the only light that was there in that place uh was the shanic glory amen where God would come down in a pillar of fire and light the room ain't that right and and that was the hidden Place amen that no man no man could go unless they were chosen to go into that place and and uh uh in that place there was The Mercy Seat and uh I you know uh to think of what God was showing uh foretelling of of this day in my opinion and I know we could go deep in more into all these things and uh but just to maybe just to say stay simple but it was a place that God he would have Moses to build knowing looking for a future you know a future people and and he would like call Aron and he'd tell Aaron you you can go into this place hidden to everybody else nobody else knew but then there there was this this this mercy seat and and you if you can put it up on the screen uh The Mercy Seat I I wanted them to put up a picture that was The Mercy Seat it was a box there and and uh that's what it was like and in that box there was uh certain contents uh the the the law was in that box I believe uh if I'm not mistaken the hidden Mana was in that box was it in the box or there was Aaron's Rod uh but there were certain things that was in that uh in that box there but then there was The Mercy Seat which was the lid to the box and that was the Ark of the Covenant that we hear about uh throughout the Bible and so but but I I thought of that uh there was the wings there was the cherubims that was and you see their wings and and uh uh there and and it covered The Mercy Seat it it was there and uh second or or Exodus 37 and9 it says and the cherubim spread out their wings on high and covered their uh and covered with their wings Over The Mercy Seat with their faces one to another even to The Mercy Seat were uh were the the faces of the cherubims now Paul talks about it in in uh Hebrews 93 he says after the second veil of the Tabernacle which is called the holiest of all and he said which had the golden sensor the Ark of the Covenant overlaid round about with gold wherein was the golden pot that had mana and Aaron's Rod that budded and the tables of the Covenant the word of God that's so them them three that was in that box and then The Mercy Seat laid was the lid and the cherubims he says and over it the cherubims of Glory overshadowing or uh or shadowing The Mercy Seat and and so that Mercy Seat was was something that that and blood would be on that Mercy Seat ain't that right uh the the the priest would sprinkle blood on that mercy seat and uh uh and I thank God for Mercy I I thank God that he would provide a place that we could know his mercy and and and so but then in 1 Samuel 4 and4 uh it tells us that the Lord of hosts dwelt between them cherubims that he would come down and and he he would come into that little room and he would abide in in in in between them cherubims even 2 Kings 19:15 declares the same thing Hezekiah prayed before the Lord and said oh Lord God of Israel which dwellest between the cherubims uh uh Psalms 99 And1 he sth between the cherubims and and many scriptures uh uh tell us uh where where God was when he'd come into that room it was there on The Mercy Seat between the cherubims and and so uh brother Bri said see down in between the Arc of the wing arch of the wings of these cherubims was a supernatural light hanging in there which was a Halo of God that Lit the whole room it was a supernatural light well others were getting their light from the sun and others were getting their light from the candles but there was one that was chosen to walk into the place where God would dwell and remember they put Aaron's rod in that place and it budded in the presence of God that Rod come to life it budded and and and not but but also the very God that made that Rod knew where that Rod come from it knew exactly what what what the origin of that Rod was so so it wouldn't in other words it wasn't a what an arm or a a what what I can't remember right away of what kind of a uh uh uh uh uh Rod it was but it sure didn't bear oranges it didn't bear apples it didn't bear whatever because almonds amen and and see because God knew what it what the origin was God knew and God was going to vindicate see and and and it's also in in that room that that remember you know when the the the Mana fell from heaven that bread and God told him now don't you don't you save this bread up for tomorrow you know you just eat what you can today but don't you save it up and and of course you know everybody some people do and uh cuz they thought it was just Moses doing that we're going to try it you know and it's just a man so they just going to do it and then it got what maggots and worm and all kinds of just filth well God didn't it couldn't last but in that holiest of holies where the presence of kind of Glory dwelt well that man aasted for every generation showing that in that room you can you can know that he's the same yesterday today and forever the man that was able to go past all them rooms and he was ch Chen to come into this place alone with God Amen he didn't see God as of yesterday he didn't just see God as what he could do then and what he was experiencing what God was today because God would preserve it for him than you Lord amen God preserved it for him amen this was the place where man had that opportunity to get alone with God and exodus 25 and 21 God God speaks here and says and thou shalt Put The Mercy Seat above the above up on the ark and in the ark Thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee and there everybody say there there where where the word was amen you see wherever the word is there's that Mercy Seat brother Brown said it's a bloody bleeding word [Applause] you realize that we are a tabernacle and that Bloody bleeding word is in our [Applause] heart it is it's on our heart and and so but but here God God would have this and and and where he says and there there not anywhere else but there will I meet with thee and I will commune with thee from above the Mercy Seat praise the Lord can you say Amen so here that that individual that had the opportunity that was chosen to go behind the veil in this secret place he had the opportunity to commune with God in the presence of God Amen so I will commune with thee from Above The Mercy Seat from between the two cherubims which are upon the Ark of the test Tony of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel now brother randam said a man once entered into that that shakana Glory that moves back there in the presence of almighty God the dimness of this world any artificial organizations and all manmade Creeds has passed away the Lord and he's living in the kind of Glory of almighty God now do you realize what that means for us because we've heard the message come out of her my people get away from all man-made ideas what was God doing calling us to come into this place alone with him the world is so in a mess right now so many voices that are uttering yes that is drowning out the voice of God that no one can really hear the voice of God anymore but where is he communing in that secret place where the mercy seat is where the word is and he's communing with those that he's called to come in amen he's called us away from the world he's called us away from the man-made lights and man-made ideas and man-made dogmas and man-made revivals even can you say man this bride Revival is not a man-made Revival she's living in the shakina light it's a Revival that has preservation in it can you say Amen now how are we going to make it how how's this world how are we do it when the world is so dark and and all this is because you've been able to come and get alone with God sure you're going to have your trials sure you're going to have your your mistakes sure you're going to have your challenges but what keeps you alive is you're living In The Presence of Jehovah now Church take advantage amen get alone with God hallelujah if there's ever a people that have the grace to keep their Spirit quietened just to get it quietened just to just to spend time with God it's you and I have you ever just had them times where God just puts it on your heart heart to spend time in prayer just to get alone with him Lord you ever just had that not just for 5 minutes but just just just to get alone that's God calling you amen you you you're you're at a you're at the place you've been called to the word you've been called to we we realize that it's a shik of Glory that's lit lit our lives up it's it's it's not man-made stuff our joy is not man-made there's something really Supernatural about this our faith ain't man-made there's something there's something Supernatural can you say Amen but there there it but God has called us for Fellowship God's called us to commune with him to where we can hear his voice get away from the world Amen get away from all the voices can you say Amen Lord do you love him amen amen others had to stand a far off and just look as the the shakana glory settled down and they they they had the long brother brand said they longed could you imagine they longed to go in that place couldn't go cuz they weren't called to go in right but they all just stood there and watched and looked could never enter into that experience with God like that priest was amen and another thing them cherubims they were they stood for a a purpose God would have them to make cherubims you realize cherubims the prophet said were guards that's what they are when God drove Adam and Eve out of the garden he set cherubims yes that guard to guard that tree of life right to where Adam or man could not go back in there and partake of it because there was cherubims Garden them away from it ain't that right and and and so but here's now these these cherubims that are upon The Mercy Seat come on and brother Braham said they guard that shanic glory the lord God putting them there as a sign that they're guarding this sh kind of Glory they're guarding the where the word is they're guarding that mercy seat right and he says then it it goes to show you that that not that every scalliwag can't come there and take of that what you have should be precious to you amen yes sir Hallelujah the opportunity that we have should be precious sometime we wonder well why can't they see it why can't others see it why can't others get get what they're needing what why why are they looking for everything else is because there's guards they're guarding that amen that's very true guarding and and yet you've been called to come in and partake of him to know that he's the same yesterday today and forever and yet there's so many people out there in religion that don't know that he's the same yesterday today and forever because they've never partook of it but God has chose you and so it it's not every scall Wag that can come in there and partake of it you he said you've got to pre be prepared everybody say be prepared you've got to be prepared to come into His presence amen you say Amen you've got to be prepared before you come into the presence of it see so then the one that was chosen had to be prepared in order to go into this the in into this prescy brother Bram said see remember the congregation in the days couldn't even approach in in couldn't approach it in no manner no way see but when Aaron he said how many times did he get to go into it once a year here now you think of that that man even though he was chosen to go in once a year could he only go in amen right come on I say that you don't have to wait once a year you you don't because Paul would tell us let us come before before the throne of grace to find help in time of need ain't that right come boldly before the throne of grace and and the throne of grace is The Mercy Seat so this has been open to the believer those that have been chosen that's why you don't look to politics good grief that's right why would you look to Trump Republican Democrat wh why would you look to that for your answers if you've been bidden to come before the throne of grace to find help in time of need it doesn't matter if they take away all of our food is not God the one that can provide the food and are you not the one to experience that he is the same yesterday today and forever then why would we doubt it why would we look and see that he could cause the Mana to come he could he could have the Ravens to feed his servant but why can't he do it for us but you've been bid to come into the this holiest secret place that you you may see that he's the same yesterday today and forever that you can partake of every promise of God if they partook of it you can too it's yours see so you you you come before this throne of grace not once a year not just in your good times but in time of need amen now he says how many times he get to go into it he said one once a year and he had to have on certain clothes yes sir right and it was made with certain hands A A peculiar type of clothes so he couldn't just be dressed any old way and he and he couldn't be take on a garment that was made just any old way come on now he had to be dressed in such a way he had a pomegranate and a bell that every time he played or walked it played holy holy holy unto the Lord ain't that right oh giving him reverence giving him a sacredness giving him the place that he's is do holy holy holy unto the Lord ain't that right he said why he was approaching the mercy seat with the blood ain't that right so he had to be Anointed with a certain oil which is a type of the Holy Ghost right when God gives you the Holy Ghost you're anointed right see with and a perfume with a certain perfume made out of the Rose of Sharon see Jesus was that Rose of Sharon see a rose is the most beautiful thing it has perfume in it but before the perfume can come out the rose has to be crushed then the perfume is squeezed from the rose see Jesus in his life was the most beautiful life ever lived but he couldn't remain that way because he had to anoint his church to approach his Holiness so his life was squeezed out and the same Holy Ghost was upon Him is put upon the church and he makes him the same yesterday today and forever the rose of Sharon the pr perfume thereof see the person that's approaching into this holiest of holy has to be Anointed with the same Holy Spirit and as he walk walks holy holy holy unto the Lord not with a cigar in his mouth but holy not with his colar turned around but holy holy holy not a beard juggling uh gzen guy but holy holy the Holy Ghost does something to you does it not the Holy Ghost does something to you it separates you from everybody else sure they may be religious sure they may be having uh their Church programs and all that but you're set aside to go into the holy place the holiest of holy can you sayen you you you you don't need Psychology you don't need the theology you don't need all of this stuff what you need to be is Anointed with the Holy Ghost and let your life cry out holy holy holy praise the Lord that's right young people don't don't think you're missing out on life cuz you don't get to go to the movies thank you amen that you ain't got these sexy dressed women for your girlfriends don't think you're not missing out on life one oce cuz you're not invited to go to parties and you're not invited to hoop and holler like everybody else you're not missing out on life God has called you and anointed you for another purpose but your purpose is greater because now you can have that opportunity to know the power of God and when you're in trouble you don't have to go to president you don't have to go to some King you don't have to look at the laws and go to government welfare and all these things look to God you've been anointed to approach The Mercy Seat and find help in time of need God has anointed you God has anointed you can you say Amen when you're feeling low you don't have to look to movies to find your joy when you're feeling low you don't have to get into sports can you say Amen there ain't no there ain't no guarantee that your sports team is going to win anyways but when you come before the throne of grace you've got every right every guarantee that your prayer will be answered talking about a preservation God has given us a way to preserve what we have amen holy holy holy dressed in the Holiness of Jesus Christ can you say amen amen as I get ready to close you realize that the bride is the only one that's dressed right that's right yes sir yes sir amen the bride is the only one that's dressed right that's yes sir it's not just anyone that's dressing her it's not just anything that she's dressed with she's got a special garment amen now brother Braham said now God fortified his army with what himself in the form of prophets Apostles Apostles teachers and pastors what did he do what was God doing did you ever think what them offices of the church is it's God's dress inside dress an Apostle Prophet a Seer see foreseeing it before Satan ever gets to it done to it what is it God dressed up in his church these offices is God's dress wear see and when you see those offices uh pastors teachers evangelists what is it that's God's dress wear God's presence God's spirit working through man can you say amen and God is taking that and he's dressing his his bride he's taking this message can you say Amen brother brandom I think in one place he said Lord let me let me take the this basically the garments of this word to dress the bride with can you say Amen see why because why would God spend so much time to check you and and choose you and bring you into the message of the hour that's right have you ever just thought of that how privileged you are that you did not just wander into this thing that God preserved you for this age he you're the people that he looked in the vision so you could come into the presence of God not be dressed with theology garments not be dressed with Baptist garments and Pentecostal garments and and the filthy rags of this world but God would take you separate you and dress you with this message of the hour because he wants fellowship with you he wants fellowship with you can you say Amen that you can know God in his power he is supreme he is Almighty and he still Reigns and he wants you to know that he wants you to experience that same God hallu if he can deliver the fiery you know uh uh the Hebrew boys with in in the fiery furnace why can't he do you well he's called you he's called you into a place that you can partake of that same God do you believe it same promises don't ever look at this Bible and read them and then say well that's just God for brother brandham that's just God for for whoever that's just well that was just David no you're to partake of it too amen amen that's right God wants fellowship with us spend time with God get alone with God let him come and let the as the prophet would call it the the the sweetness of his presence just saturate your soul praise the Lord yes Lord can you say amen amen amen Psalm 17 and8 David said keep me as the appal as of thy eye of the eye hide me everybody say hide me where under the shadow of thy Wings than from the wicked that oppress me see there's a preservation from my deadly enemies who Compass me about Psalms 57 And1 it it says to the chief musician uh whatever he says when he at Mitchum of David when he fled from Saul in the cave be merciful unto me oh God be merciful unto me for my soul trusteth in thee yay in the shadow of thy Wings will I make my refuge until these calamities be overpassed can you say Amen oh do you love the Lord so I believe that the spirit of God upon David that was upon David was calling out for this day prophesying as he foresaw a people in this day that would be closed that would be separated and anointed to where they could come into that presence and partake of him that's right this is what the theme of brother branham's message was in his meeting was Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen can you say Amen if the musicians will come that's good prise the Lord so the prophet said here he was anointed went in behind that place and they could just listen hear them Bells all those that were outside all they could do is just listen hear the bells such and such but Aaron standing in the GL shik of Glory by The Mercy Seat where the cherubims had their wings tipped over it the guards of the mercy seat oh they could listen in there how their hearts long to go in there holy holy holy unto the Lord and know that what it did to Aaron he lived from year to year to go in he lived to go in that place once a year man just longing for that place see and how the regular congregation couldn't go in yet they were Liv living under the blood but yet they uh yet not into the shik glory but when the True Blood came the blood of Jesus Christ God's son he broke down the middle wall of partition he tore down the curtain from top to bottom and now the believer whosoever will let him come into the shik kind of glory and a man through justification believe in the word sanctification clean him from his sins he's subject to enter into the Pentecostal shikina God did the same thing on the day of Pentecost when he saved the church through such justification Romans 51 sanctification it says uh you know uh St John 1717 Jesus said sanctify them Father through the truth for Thy word is truth but on the day of Pentecost the middle wall of partition had been torn down the curtain was rent from bottom to top or from top to bottom at Calvary and the believer entered into that shik glory and the power of God fell upon them holy holy holy unto the Lord went the Praises and glories in unknown tongues and out of there they come shouting and rejoicing and notice he says and that's the only place of Fellowship coming into the presence of God the shik glory that's the only place for Fellowship Lord aren't you glad that you can come into a personal relationship with God not just when you got saved filled with the Holy Ghost but keep into that personal relationship with God if you're weary tonight if you're tired of the struggles if you're just needing that renewing just remember get along with him you don't have to stand on the the outer court and look in but God has if there's any in You to Want More Of God that's God wooing you come come he did not bring you to this message so you can sit there without experience and relationship he did not bring us into this message to get so busy in life oh we believe God sent a prophet he brought you into this so you can be anointed you could be dressed to come into His presence amen I'm so glad for that amen if you need that renewing he can give it to you amen
