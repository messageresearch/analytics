his Zeal for God's people amen and amen in this in this age and time you it's just uh it's got to be a god-given gift for to have a passion for Souls you see so many that just let souls go by and don't really have a care for them but then God plants gifts and you see those gifts operating just to do anything they can to win souls for the kingdom amen amen turn to the book of Deuteronomy with me the second chapter we're just going to read two verses from here Deuteronomy the 2 chapter start at the second verse and the Lord spake unto me saying ye have compassed this mountain long enough turn you northward you have compassed this mountain long enough turn you northward amen maybe while your bbl's open this morning if you just ask the Lord to come by your way and take something off those pages and make it real to you this morning Father we thank you Lord for your grace and yes Jesus your mercy father that's brought us here to this morning Father Lord we're well aware of your presence in the room and we're aware that the scripture is open to your word and father that's where all life comes from Lord is Lord out of your word and from you Lord and father we ask that it would be more than just ink on pages Lord or quotes being read but father it would be life Lord poured out upon us this morning Father Lord I pray that you'd bring restoration Lord I pray that you'd increase Faith Lord I pray that you'd bring healing father Lord I pray that you'd bring your spirit father we believe that you're still a filling God that fills every heart and soul that's hungering for you oh god father I pray that you would just anoint this word in a way that it would become such a reality to us this morning Father that Lord you'd allow me just to move out of the way father and you'd use my lips and voice father but Lord you use the audience and and you'd open their hearts father Lord and you'd move into them and be indwelling father this morning and God I ask that you just anoint your word to us Lord As We Lift Your Name father Lord we know that you promised you'd be here and father we we're aware that you're here father and Lord we know when you come in the room that you're here to do a purpose father you're here to perform your father 's business and Lord we thank you ask you bless us now in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated this morning there in that Deuteronomy we read about uh the children of Israel walking around the mountain and if we could just call this mountain brother Brandon would call this mountain the mountain of unbelief and they would be walking around this mountain of unbelief and they would walk around this same Mountain for 40 years they would be stuck in a rut just walking around this same mountain of unbelief so this morning just for a few minutes in time wanted to talk about enough is enough we walked around this mountain long enough and enough is enough I I believe as children of God we're given rights and we're given inheritance and we're given laws that apply to us and we're given Authority in the land but we've got to recognize the authority that we've been given and we've got to have the courage to stand up and say enough is enough and I believe we're a Joshua generation in this age that we're not we're not looking for somebody else to come and to take the Reigns but we are the Joshua of this generation that will take the Reigns of this word and we will cross over into another land and you got to think that during this time that they were walking around the mountains and they they were they were compassing and brother Amos you got to know that they probably stepped in the same place that they stepped in the year before and they saw the same footprint that they were in the year before and they saw their same the dead their dead horse on the side of the road that was there the year before and they circle around and they circle around and you think about this for 40 years they circled around imagine if somebody were to come to the Altar for 40 years with the same burden on their heart or the same need and they'd have to come back to the same Revelation for 40 years in a row and never actually crossing over into a Promised Land but I say we're living in a time and an age where we are saying enough is enough I've had enough of seeing the same the same Egyptians I've had enough of seeing the same fears the same complexes I've had enough of dealing with the same situations I've I've had enough of only reaching it to this plateau and never going further into the word I've had enough of of compassing this mountain of unbelief and I'm going to rise today and use my authority to say enough is enough I'm not going to settle for just what I've been given in this life but I've been given another inheritance and I've got to rise to the occasion and say enough is enough we don't get anything else out this morning just take that phrase enough's enough when the Devil comes back to you this week and he hits you tomorrow morning morning you say enough is enough I'm not going to I'm not going to go around this mountain of argument again I'm not going to reason out if this is the truth in my mind again I'm not going to go back to a place where I wonder where I'm at or the position I've been given or or the authority I've been given in this age or I want that seat in the church or I want this position in the church and I'm not going to go back to that place of Reason in my mind but enough is enough I'm going to go on in Perfection as a Joshua generation is commissioned to do to cross over into a place where nobody else had been before they'd heard of a land of a Holy Ghost Land but nobody had crossed over that land before so Joshua had a vision to know that I've got I've got a place over there I've got a home over there I've got I've got authority over there in that land over there I I'm free from Harm's Way yes there's going to be battles yes there's going to be fights but I am protected by the Covenant God gave that if we're in that land then we are under his protection if we're under his protection then there is no weapon for against us that shall prosper we're under the protection of the message of the hour no more reasoning about it no more wondering about it we've Compass the mountain long enough we've got to enter into the authority of the land and if we're not in that land then we don't have rights to the authority right under the Judean law they were they were blessed people right the children of Israel were blessed people in Egypt but they were still in they were still in slavery they were still blessed but they were not fully blessed cuz they were not living where they were supposed to live live and as children of God in this age we can be blessed outside here but we'll always have a mediocre life short of Victory and short of walking in the fullness until we come fully into the promised land where we belong that is where our rights come into effect so why would we wait outside in the Border land when we can cross all the way in and enjoy the benefits the benefits of a body prepared amen the benefits of a holy ghost land where God has already made a way for us but we've got to say enough's enough and you got to think Joshua walked in these same circles and these same ruts and stepped in the same Footprints and every time they would get to the entrance to the promised land he would feel a pull within him you know he looked over there and he said it's just that way if we could just go that way and trying to get two million people to to see what he saw if we could just come this way we could just move this direction and and and the people just so strong in their mind and say no we're going to go back in the same Circle that we've gone in before it reminds me of a prophet that came in this age and was talking to the denominations he said if you could just pull this way and yet so headstrong in their denominational thought they went back in the same Circle in the same rut and came back into the same falling of an age and Pentecost failed and Pentecost went away even though the prophet was trying to say this is the direction this is the way to go and yet they found themselves walking in the same rut that Wesley did and that Luther did and walking back in another cycle but I think it's time we break the cycle this message will not denominate we will break the cycle we're going to get free from this circle of unbelief this mountain I don't know about you friends but I've Compass this mountain long enough I I was born in a message home I've been in a message church so you can say I've been walking around almost 40 years hearing the same promises and the same the same preaching and the same Revelations but there's coming a time when we're saying enough is enough I'm taking this word and I'm crossing over into my land enough's enough you can go back in a circle if you want to but as for me in my house we will cross over we have seen a Promised Land we've tasted of a land we witnessed of the land we we've prepared for it to make it over there if we're not prepared to go there why are we here this morning but our entire life has been coming into a house of God preparing Our Lives preparing our hearts for what to go back in the same Circle no to cross over into somewhere that we've never been before to place our foot on Authority amen that is where the third pole lies is in that land and we'll never have access to that Authority tell we we're living in that land and that land is the holy ghost in the message of the hour we can't stop short of that and that's why we have fights and that's why we have bickering and that's why we have so and so did this and so and so did that and that's why we have divisions and we have leavings and we have bad feelings and because we're not living in the land where we're supposed to live but as for me in my house I say it's time to move into the land where we're supposed to live where we don't let the divisions conquer us we don't let the bad feelings conquer us we don't let the Mind battles conquer us cuz we're living in our Authority that's what we're crossing over into now we say a Holy Ghost Land is that is that a land of dancing and jumping and shouting yeah maybe there's a lot of Victories there but that's not all that's in that land that land is a land of spoken word Authority where you have the same rights that that join HS join HS with Jesus Christ right so you have the same rights that he had you have the same rights that the prophet had I don't believe that this message came in this time and this age just to tell one man that he could have spoken word Authority I believe he said you can too I believe he said this that I've done you will also do these works that I do shall you do and greater because there's more of you if the church could all move into the land of authority then they would all have the same rights they would all have the same vision they would all have the same word of Prophecy in their mouth no we don't have a messiah sign no we don't have that great gift of discernment no we don't have that same the same life pattern that brother bandam had but we are given the same Authority to me that's a more miraculous thing I was not protected from Harm's Way I was not protected from from from defiling my body I was not I didn't have an angel of the Lord hovering over Me Knocking away cigarettes and knocking away bottles so I think it's a greater miracle that you're sitting here this morning and even through all the trials that you've been through and all the mistakes that you've had you've been given the same the same benefits if you cross into that Holy Land so I think we've had enough of walk in ruts amen I don't know about you but I've had enough sir of just catching glimpses of a Promised Land we've had an exodus right we've come out of denomination some of us in some of us have not still but we've come out of denomination and we've come into what we call a message realm right but then but then other people have denominated that same realm because they failed to cross over so would bring out there's two parts to an exodus right there's two parts to Redemption there's a coming out of and there's a going into so here's where we're at stuck in this Valley between the the coming out of and the going into but I think it's time we settle it this morning and we take what we know and we go into let what's been said been said and been done been done lay it behind you and cross over into the land of authority you're never going to have true Joy or true happiness or true peace until you're living in that land and yes there's battles in that land there's there's opposition in that land there's Giants in that land there's enemies in that land but you are different in your in your faith because you're standing in a position of authority and you think you look at somebody well they're still fighting but they're in a position of authority what what what what what battle are you going to win not knowing who you are the devil's going to come right to that point every time you you try to attack him back and every time time you try to take back what's yours you're going to end up right at that crossroads do you know who you are if you're living in the land of Authority the only way you got there is by the blood and the blood has tagged you that you know who you are you know that you didn't access that just by by you didn't slip in under the radar but God allowed you to be in the promised land of Victory because you are tagged with the blood tag you know who you are that land is only for the Sons and Daughters of God with that seed that can have that have that Authority in this life nobody else has that same Authority they can have faith and they can have the miraculous done but to know who you are and to know where you're going and to know that your name now we know why we're rejoicing right if you're not in the land you don't really know why you're rejoicing you're rejoicing the spirits are subject unto you you're rejoicing that the anointing and an emotion came in the room and all those things are great reasons to Rejoice but when you're living in the land you have seen your name on the Lamb's Book of Life and you know why you're rejoicing because no matter what this life brings you you're going to make it and I think we say enough is enough of not knowing if our name is on the book and I think we settle it this morning and we say I want to see my name if John could see his name then I can see my name too if it could be revealed to Paul that he would know that he would know that he would know then I can too I believe we've got to step into a position where we know who we are but it's something that's slipped into the church and we're even unaware of it brother man was say he's speaking of a meeting there in Europe he say sitting there in the lap land where I couldn't even speak one word and half the fins couldn't their sweds and there the Holy Spirit was set in and tell the people things all down and they were just in one Accord everybody just pleading out for God and just great signs and wonders there was no friction they didn't even speak the same language she can't tell me he worked him up into some kind of emotion they didn't understand what he was saying but when the feeling came in the room they recognized it he said there was no friction there sometimes you get in such a rut Till There is no really setting right to a man is that right you just get to a place till subconsciously you're disbelieving when you don't want to do that you don't want to do that see the thing is to do is lay down everything and believe with all your heart so the prophet's telling us here that we can get into a rut in our life where we're subconsciously disbelieving the word not even knowing it because we're afraid to cross over into the land that God's already said was ours and he said the thing to do is to lay down all the isms and schisms and doubts and wonderings and hard feelings and you see that's a hard thing for for for for us to do because we we've been hurt and when you've been hurt you're not just easily going to give that up you're not going to easily if you've ever been if you've ever been jabbed here you're always going to cover that with your arm right and it's going to be hard to let that go because there's a wound there and and but what the prophet's telling us is subconsciously you're protecting yourself from the Holy Spirit entering into that place so he can bring a bomb so he can bring a healing and you've got it covered and you've got it protected but the prophet's telling us the thing to do is to let it go and let the Holy Ghost come in and bring a healing to that to that issue bring a healing to that battle in your mind he says what happened with Joshua one day little Joshua he believed every word that God said every word somebody say every word every word God took care of us and he kept his promise he said he Supply our needs while we're out here but that's not all of it come on now there lays a Promised Land let's go to it he says you've been on this mountain 40 years turn now turn northward and upward and cross over I think the prophet's giv us some powerful Direction here turn now turn turn upward and turn northward so if you hold a compass like this brother Kevin the compass is always going to press North right it's always going to have that red arrow pointing North I don't know what direction North is from here maybe somebody does Brother Sam you know what North is from here this way okay so if I was holding the compass the arrow will be pointing that way right sure that direction is but what brother Braham was saying not to just turn it northward but to turn it upward glory and if you look on a map the direction of North is always on the top of the map right well he's saying don't just turn your direction to a geographical North here but turn your eyes upward turn your turn your sights upward stop looking to the left or the right or the person in front of you or thinking this is for the person behind you but turn your vision upward and move on and move past it move past all the friction move past all the all the all the grinding and the attitudes and the waves that you feel you know how sometimes you get into a conversation with somebody you feel that there's some resistance there and you're not sure why and there's this friction that happened and they didn't shake your hand just right or they didn't look at you the right way or you know and then you leave with this thought well they don't like me or they don't you know and in reality they're thinking the same thing about you and you see the devil moves right in there in the middle of that and he says yeah they don't like you you should just go yeah they don't like you either you should just leave and you know the best way to settle this is to go find a new church or to move on to somebody else so you don't have to come face them again you know I know what I'm talking about I've grown up in church i' I've dealt with all this and I've had to battle through all this myself and I know where I'm what I'm talking about and that's how the devil moves into our our our midst and he tries to divide and he tries to conquer and he tries to steal kill and Destroy and if he can get into the middle of our of our fellowship then he can he can cut off that blood supply he can cut off that flow of unity right there was no friction among them and that's when the Holy Spirit fell I wonder if we could say that in the Church of God this morning there is no friction among them oh well I sit on this side of the church cuz that brother sits on that side of the church and I want to be as far away from him as I can be and you see how how how church goes on this is nothing new it's been a cycle the battle that you're fighting is a cycle I'd like to tell you that your that your issue with people is new but it's not it's a cycle it's the same mountain of unbelief that we've compassing we've been compassing and the church has been compassing but there's got to come of people that are willing to rise up and say enough is enough I don't care what they've said I don't care what they've done I don't care what attitude I imagine I don't care enough is enough Joshua didn't just say all my friends are going to come with me and all the people that I hang out with are going to come with me he said we've got a land people we've got a land that's ours and we've got to move to that land we're going to die out here in the wilderness and they were busy well Joshua we can't go over there because this brother believes that way Joshua is thinking wow there's a Promised Land over there there's a Holy Ghost Land over there if we could just get there it'll take care of the division it'll take care of all that and they're saying no we can't enter into that because this brother said this and no we can't enter into that because we get too fanatical or we can't go that way because we get too dried up and we can't go that way and you see Josh is trying to say if we could just cross over there it would take care of all this it would take care of all the bickering and all the fighting and all the all the hard feelings and the sore feelings and we can't fellowship and we can't shake hands and we can't brother bam said you could bitterly disagree with me come on and I'll shake your hand and say I love you now we say that's easy to do until we come in contact with somebody that we can't do that anymore and we have a hard time reaching that hand out in love with a genuine love in us to say brother I know you're wrong and I know you're in error but I love you anyway that's a hard thing to do it's a hard thing for us to get past our own emotion because we just we want to fix everybody right we want everybody to be in the pattern the way that we see it but not everybody fits in the same pattern that we fit in some will go this way and some will go that way but as for this for this message bride she will only stay with the word and the word says that you've got to have a hand of Fellowship out and say I love you anyway I love you no matter how you treated me you you might have stabbed me in the back but I love you anyway you see that only can come by walking in the land of authority amen you can't have that just in your flesh you can try but on the inside it won't be the real thing the real thing only comes by living in the land of authority living where where where the Holy Ghost is supreme ruler he says turn now turn northward and upward he said don't you want to cross over Jordan now ain't it long enough in the wilderness ain't it long enough friends I don't know about you but I think it's enough I've had enough of wondering what's the truth or wondering what's the reality or who should we listen to or whose opinions right enough enough and the devil come enough no enough I've I've had enough I'm just going to push away from the table I've had enough of this negative conversation but I see a Promised Land over there I'm not going to walk in the same rut I'm not going to walk in the same cycle oh they tried it and then they found themselves right back in the same cycle just walking in circles just walking in circles and that's how the devil has stopped this church from entering into into this Rapture and fullness is he's got it walking in circles brother going back to the same Cycles going back to the same circle of unbelief and wondering and wandering and wondering not sure of the direction to head but if we could get under the Joshua commission through the message of the hour it has made a way my word is a lamp unto thy feet and a light unto thy path it is the way that is right it is the it is the narrow way and we've got to walk on that way and without that we will just be wandering in cycles and some wander in wider patterns and some wandering closer patterns but they're all wandering in circles but there's going to be a bride there's going to be a Joshua Church in this age that has had enough of wandering the same mountain and they're going to be willing to take the step into Liberty and say I've had enough I'm not settling to go back I'm not going back where I was last year I'm not going back for the same thing that I came in here with I'm not going back to the same addiction I'm not going back to the same fear I've had enough and I'm walking into victory that is the commission of the church in this age not to go in C anybody can walk in circles but we've been given a commission to go forward and speak the word there's only one direction of the Holy Ghost brother bam said it's forward not in circles but forward not back around the bend but forward I couldn't even count so many u-turns we've made I there's too many to count but there's only one direction of the true Holy Ghost it's forward in the word we're not going backwards to restore the church we're going forwards to restore the church we're not going back to a Pentecostal pattern like we think backwards we'd be have to go all the way through the ages to go back to there but we're going forward to a Pentecost the pattern of the church that's where we're headed we're not trying to go back nobody's trying to take us back well if they are they're off the word but we're not trying to go back to isusa Street why do we want to go back to isusa Street where they were off the word they didn't know how to baptize they didn't know the authority they had they didn't they didn't know anything it was the breaking of an age and the anointing came down well I don't want to go back to that we've come way too far to go back to that but we've got to get back to the original pattern of the church which was the Pentecostal 120 in the upper room church and the only way to get there is to go forward in the word is that all right I got quotes for all this I just paraphrase them so I'll send them to you if you want goad brother that's all right you're doing good but I know brother Sean preached the message you guys have probably heard these quotes praise the Lord he says I believe your word speaking of Samson Revenge my eyes that I that has been put out let me die let me die out to my own self I don't care what they say about me I may be Bishop I may be this that or the other I don't care what they say bring back the power of the holy ghost in my life I've been blinded long enough Samson saying I've been blinded long enough bring back the power you see he's saying restore the power of once I once had I I had once tasted that power bring it back I've been blinded long enough and when's the last time church that we had a clear Direction on what we were doing in this life a clear direction of how we we knew where we were going we know the position we held we knew the direction of the of the hour and we were walking steadfastly and I say there's people in the room that know there's people in the room that know what we're doing here there's people in the room that know the direction we're heading and we're not looking to the left or the right so we're just trying to get everybody to come on board with us it's so much easier brother Terry when you're not looking to the left or the right just like brother B would talk about that boy on the balance beam right how did you do well I didn't look down I didn't look left I just looked to the end point and when you're looking to the end point you're not looking at brother so and so or sister so and so you're only looking at the end of the line and it doesn't really matter what they're doing you're just trying to get them to get to the end of the line with you prise the Lord is that all right Hallelujah the man would say now I believe that we're living in the days or the days that we're living in should cause the church to go completely into desperation I believe since the message this morning from God not me I believe it ought to throw this entire congregation into desperation that we have played long enough we've went to church long enough we've got to do something how is it that we can see other great signs and wonders done on others and what about us it should cause in a state of desperation that we are determined before God Lord so let's bring this down to individual now we've seen Miracle after Miracle take place under the authority of this message I we'd lose count to say that the message is lost power would be the most ignorant statement I've ever heard we lose count of the amount of Miracles and testimonies and and and deliverances and fillings and we'd lose count yeah if we would just took the last if we took the last five years we'd lose count think about what's happening just in our midst here but then magnify that all over the world and think about churches in Africa and churches in Australia and churches in Europe and all the Miracles that God's working through this message of the hour we would lose count amen we would run out of ink in just a short amount of time if we started recording all the different ones you think about you have a testimony service and everybody here say well God's met me sometime in the last year praise God he should have yeah and we'd have we'd have just in this church we'd have pages over the last couple years of Miracles right and we can say well this happened and this happened and this happened and the message hasn't lost power to say that would just you'd have to literally have blinders on and just have your head buried in the sand to not know that the power and authority is in the Church of of the Living God Amen but brother brandom is saying here after seeing all that what about us come on now now I've been to this temp meeting here that you guys have every year since you've had it and I've seen more miracles come out of that prayer line Hallelujah I couldn't even count them I wouldn't even know them all this one would maybe wouldn't say what was really fixed on the inside of them or this one and some are physical manifestations you could see and some are fillings of the Holy Ghost and some are and you watch Miracle after Miracle after miracle happened and the water's being troubled and the people are walking into the troubled water and you're seeing the results of that Troubled Water but then you look out and you still see some sitting there in the chair and you got to wonder what they're thinking yeah what are they thinking sitting sitting 15 ft away from this miraculous thing going by and they're just watching it Go by spectating it spectating Miracle after miracle and the prophet of God is saying after seeing all these signs and wonders take place in our midst what about you where's your Miracle where's where's your deliverance and you you watch this sit by and go by and you think oh that's wonderful God did this and God did that and God did this but what about our individual testimony maybe this doesn't apply to everybody in the room but if it applies to pay attention and you watch and you watch this this this this flood of the anointing come through the service and you'll see it affect this one and this one and this one and you know sometimes you just sit in the back of the church and as as a as a deacon you really get to enjoy that because you can literally watch the anointing come like a wave and you can just see it affect the people in different ways or front to back or back to front you can literally tell the direction of the anointing moving across the church as it changes the countenance of the people and people are entering in but yet some people will sit there and they'll go right by them and they'll never enter into that anointing it reminds me of that man at the pool of Bethesda right where he was just just from here to the door to the Fountain and there would be there'd be so many people healed and he watched healing brother Amos come out he'd watch a guy walk down on crutches they carry him down on the bed and he'd go down there and he'd watch that same man walk out on his own two legs because of the authority of that was happening inside that inside that well and we watch many miracles take place in our midst we watched one walking in the prayer line that was ready to to to kill themselves in a spirit of suicide and walk out on the other side totally delivered ready to to to live their life for God we've seen the miraculous happen but what about our Miracle what about us come on now hallelujah what about your need well I would do that but this I would do that but this I I would do that but this you see how the the man is making these excuses for not being able to get to the Fountain and he wants to within himself but he's not able to stop going through the same cycle that he's been going through for 35 years of not being able to enter into that Troubled Water and so you know what happens there's an interruption that happens in his life he doesn't have the faith to get there so the word comes to him he doesn't have the faith to get to the troubled water himself brother Brown said right now the waters are troubled and the word has come to us so the word will come right to where you're at and you might have not have the faith or the ability to get to the troubled water but the troubled water will come to you and you've got to recognize the anointing has come through the room it's cycling through this building right now and you've got to be willing to say I've had enough I've had enough of what I've been dealing with I've had enough of the pressure I've had enough of the Mind battle I've had enough not knowing I've had enough of of being dried out I've had enough of just wondering if I'm the next one to leave I've had enough of this of this battle going on enough is enough rise into the anointing and say I take it I move into the troubled water I'm moov into the opening of the word I'm move into the authority of the land I've had enough of this mountain Hallelujah church until we move into the anointing of God we'll always be struggling it's hard to kick against the Pricks it's hard to fight against the anointing but if we just move into it if we just let go of our own abilities if we let go of our own mind if we let go of our own wants and desires and let the anointing come and lead us hallelujah praise His holy name thank you Jesus we are not sheep without a Shepherd the anointing of the age is The Shepherd of the sheep and we've got to be led by the anointing to just let go and and be led and we sing the songs and we sing the Praises of it but when does it become a reality to us that we actually let go of what's going on in here and we let the anointing lead here and take us on into a higher Place [Music] hallelujah it's our commission in this age turn with me to Revelations 21 or they can pull it up on the screen just uh I just want to point out here some areas of why we would continue to go in the same cycle come on brother that's right Revelations 21 and the sixth chapter and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I will give unto him that is the thirst of the Fountain of the Water of Life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things somebody say all things he that overcometh shall inherit all things where do you get your inheritance in the promised land in the land of authority in the land of the Holy Ghost that's where you inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my sonallah but the fearful and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and hor mongers and Sorcerers and idolators and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burth with fire and brimstone which is the second death and there came into me one of the Seven Angels which had seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked to me saying come hither and I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife amen so the bride is not in this picture here of these lists of people that will be cast into the Lake of Fire there's another place where she's resting well shemaya when I read this I thought maybe maybe this is Sunday school stuff and and that's usually I'm pretty simple guy but I thought it was really weird that the first first thing on that list is fearful oh my now we would expect the sorcerers and the liars and the murderers and the and and and all the criminals and all the you know all these people that have done wrong and knew to do better and they did wrong and all the iniquity workers right we'd expect all them to be cast into the Lake of Fire but the first one on the list is the fearful all right church so what would keep us from walking out of this circle walking out of this cycle and walking into a place that we've never never been before it's fear it's fear upon the church that we will be called this or we would be called that or we would we would almost get there we'd fall short or I think brother Bram said this this is several quotes the greatest problem in the church is fear of failure the greatest issue in the Church of God today is a fear of failure that you would give it your all and you would still fail that you would give it your everything and you would still come short that you would you would try to cross over but you would still fall short it's a fear of failure and I think it's time that we say enough is enough enough's enough I'm not going to struggle with this fear anymore I'm not going to struggle with this anxiety over whether I'm going to make it or not anymore enough's enough I know who I am and I know where I'm going think about this friends you would never murder somebody you would never perform sorcery or witchcraft over somebody or conjure up spirits to cast Over somebody's household you think about that man that person belongs in the Lake of Fire so do the fearful and they're fearful to enter into the Promises of God and I'm not dealing with a spirit of fear where you think you're afraid to leave your house you're afraid of this you're afraid of that I'm talking about the fear of entering into the word of God come on the fear of taking God at his word to say I know he said it I know he'll perform it I know he'll see me through I know he'll bring Deliverance I know he'll bring restoration I know he'll set back it on the straight way I know that he'll bring correction when I need it I know that he'll do it because he said he would do it and I'm not fearful about whether I'm walking in the perfect will of God I know that I'm walking in the perfect will of God because I'm lining up with the word upon word upon word upon word upon word this is not a message of cans I don't know where this came from and that we have to deal with all this you can't do this and you can't do that and you can't do this when did brother bandom ever say any of that come on brother it's denominational you know it is for a man to stand up here and say you can't do this and you can't do do that and you can't do this and you can't do that and and then not have any word to back it up but it's just his own opinion being projected from the pulpit his own conviction being projected from the pulpit if the prophet didn't say it then it doesn't apply to me amen if the prophet didn't say it like that then I'm not going to eat that it's my own personal conviction that's fine but I'll never preach my own personal conviction over a Pulpit because it's my personal conviction come on but what's happened is man has gotten involved in this and they've got in between the message you see back in the day not everybody had the table app right how many people remember before before amen I remember just being a kid and and my dad had all the books and all the things laid out and and he would just study and go through and read and read and read and he would he would be up all night brother am was trying to find a quote and now I can just type in a quick search and I have that quote right in my hand right but you see it used to be that the church had to come to the man to get the word yeah they didn't have their own tapes they were real to real and they were you had to know somebody who knew somebody and you had to mail in that tape to get another tape back and you had to I was just having lunch with some people that that where you went to Brother Brand's meeting several times one of them was dedicated by brother brandom and they were telling us yeah they remember you had to send out the tape and this is pretty funny she sent out one of their tapes she was like a 15-year-old girl she sent out their real toore to come back and the real toore came back with a man's name and address on it and she remembered that name I can't remember the brother's name but it was a pretty unique name and so she remembered that name will come to find out 5 years later she'd be married to that man wow do you see how it used to work you used to send it in and have to wait for it to come back and they were doing the best they could but that was the age that they were in yes we're not in that age anymore that's right that's right brother I I don't have to wait and hear hear the filtered down word skipping over this part of this quote and skipping over this part of this quote cuz it doesn't quite Dov tail so I'm just going to cut this part out and you see how the church ended up in denomination and they ended up scattered and wondering and confused and walking in circles because the man of God back then felt that the right thing to do was to just to preach the agenda that he was given I'm not saying it was a bad man or they were bad that was just the age they were living in that was the direction they wanted the church to go in but we're not in that direction anymore we're coming out to the exit to the promised land again and now we're not just relying on what the man has to say behind the pulpit or what he might read to us or the part of the quote that he wants us to catch we are we have the full word that's why I I I don't know how you could believe that we're not in the age of the open word you have it literally in the palm of your hand you could search any time anywhere any place you could search exactly what the prophet said about it you could hear the The Voice come through your phone you anywhere you're at you can hear the prophet speak we did not have that 20 years ago we did not have that 30 years ago and you see how how it's not the fault of these men but they just weren't given the authority that we're given they were only given maybe 600 books right brother Terry you remember just a few tapes a handful my dad came in the message on five tapes and he had those five tapes I think for the first five years and that's all he had but we're not in that age we're not there anymore we're not back in that in the in the buggy age we're in another age the word is open unto us it's in the of your hand let me say it like this friend you've got no excuse you've got no excuse that you're not walking in the perfect word you can't blame it on the pastor anymore you can't blame it on soand so anymore you've got the same access to the word that they have you've got the same access to the word that anybody has you can you can read every quote that I'm reading this morning the pal me I know in our church there's a there's guys that read the same quote at the same time the preachers reaching in they searching in there it Marvels me Brother Sam that would never have been possible 10 or 15 years ago of course the devil's going to try to use that to bring correction and to fact check and to do that let the devil do what he's going to do but what the reality of it is is it has opened a source to us it's opened a fountain in the church that we can draw from this word we can draw from this message any place any time anywhere under any condition we can draw from the word and that is how we break free from that cycle we're not stuck in a rut we're not stuck in a cycle if we are it's our own fault when you have the word he sent his word in this age that we could use it as a weapon to break free from the cycle I think that we have enough is enough of what we say about ourselves of what so and so says about ourselves I think it's time brother Amos that we say what God said about us and God said that I will have a church without spot without wrinkle I will have a perfect bride I will have a perfect believer she will walk step and step with my word she will not go to the left or the right but she will continue on in everything every line every dot every title everything will be lined up with according to how I have presented it to her I think we we talk about us like God talks about us let's say what God said about us God said that we would be [Applause] victorious we ask us we say well I'm fearful God said you're Victorious yes You' got to change your mentality of who you are I'm not I'm not down I'm not a slave I'm not in bondage I'm not in fear I'm not just barely going to make it I'm not just squeaking in here God has elected me before the foundation of the world and he deposited with me a seed and at the appointed time Abraham was just a regular old guy right worked a regular old job worship the same Idols that everybody else worshiped there was nothing special about him to anybody else said there but God knew God knew on the inside of Abram there was a seed in there and at that time God would would wake up that Jean seed is this all right this morning amen he'd wake it up and Abram would become Abraham and there would be a name change happened there and nothing on the outside looked any different Branson he looked exactly the same to everybody else but everything about his his disposition changed that's true oh the wrinkles didn't just fall off right away he didn't just stand up straight right away but he got a revelation and then he continued in that Revelation to know that he was an elected Son of God and think about this Abraham didn't have anybody else that believed like him come on brother that's right all right come on now nobody come on nobody believed like Abraham believed he went out on his own and under the his countenance changed people came to him his nephew said what's different about you H there's something changed about you he said God came to visit me God which Idol was it no God came to me the original God came to me oh my you can think how many people thought Abraham had lost his mind that's right come on oh you yeah you're real special guy you're just a regular brick layer like everybody else I saw you worshiping Idols last Sunday said but it's different come on Brother come on and Abraham didn't just walk out and complete Victory that's right it was the trial of Abraham's Faith to maintain the promise you know Abraham doubted and laughed at the promise of God before Sarah did before Sarah ever laughed Abraham laughed the scripture says it that's why I know the Bible is true because it writes the truth of the matter whether it's bad or whether it's good it writes the truth of the matter and Abraham doubted the promise of God before Sarah ever doubted the promise of God it's recorded in the scripture right that's the beginning of Abraham's life but I like it in Romans 4 where it says Abraham staggered not at the promise of God but was strong in faith shiah how does that work how does a guy that records the first half of his life and he staggered all over he didn't even know what direction to go he had lot pick the direction cuz he didn't know where to go and he said you choose and I'll go the other way didn't know where he was going but yet when it's written about him and Paul was a man who would tell you the truth no matter how it seemed but when Paul wrote about Abraham's life he said Abraham staggered not staggered not Glory you know what that tells me Josiah it's not how you start out it's how you finish it's not it's not how you were born into this or you were born into that or you had this inability or you had a you you got a quick short work to come into it's how you finish it's how you finish Church we've all come in and we've been in corrupt we were in closed Ministry we I grew up I I wasn't allowed to fellowship with anybody I didn't know there was youth camps I didn't know there was you I didn't know there was this brother or that brother I never heard anybody's name in the message except for our church wow and now I've got friends all over the world by the grace of God and this message of unity it's not how you start it's how you finish many of you started out in a bar stool somewhere smoking cigarettes before you're old enough to buy them drink it before you're old enough to buy it it doesn't matter how you start out it matters how you finish and if you still have breath in your lung this morning then you're in the Finish hour he's not giving up on you yet you're still here this morning and you think that that's not a thing you think how many times the devil tried to stop you from being here this morning how many times he's tried to kill you and cause sickness and cause car accidents spirits of suicide they didn't win you're still here spirits of suicide that try to take your life you're still here this morning why because he lost because God had a purpose for you and you're still here this morning because it's not how you start it's how you finish I think it's time that we say enough is enough it's time to finish this I'm crossing over I'm laying it down I'm running the race I'm giving up everything why would we give up so much and then and fall short of giving up everything Amen brother Brandon would say it like this you got just enough religion to be miserable yeah because you're giving up so much but you haven't give up everything and as soon as you give up everything it doesn't matter what you give up I'm not I'm not I don't do those things because I don't want to do them it's not something I gave up I just didn't want to do it I don't want to be that I don't want to be identified with that why because I've given up everything and let his holy spirit tell me and dictate to me what I should and should not do so then I don't have to wonder about it I don't have to question about it I don't have to get down and say I wonder if I should do this brother said if there's a question about it don't do it amen praise the Lord hallelujah too fearful preach to enter in he says that's where the church is you're always scared it's not going to happen wow that's the reason it don't happen when that when love casts out fear when you've got love fear is gone Lord but as long as you got fear love cannot operate it right Hallelujah what's the Capstone Amos as long as you've got fear love cannot operate the Capstone cannot operate in your life the Capone Authority cannot come down and Crown you because you've got fear in there and fear and love cannot abide together death and life cannot abide together Darkness and Light cannot abide together fear and love cannot abide together wow so as long as there's fear in there love will never crown that I think enough is enough I don't want to have fear I don't want to have fear of of this or what might happen or I might fail or I might give up or I might be washed to the side or I might be a shipwreck one of those Believers that makes it 30 years down the road or 50 years down the road and then they end up just walking away at the end I don't want it that's a fear that's not going to be you that's not your testimony cuz that's not your role in this thing you've got to see seed within you Eve is not your type you've got another seed within you that will finish this that will make it all the way God didn't bring you this far to leave you now but he brought you this far cuz he knew you would have the goods to finish the race cuz he put him in there you didn't come by yourself brother but God put a seed within you that he could hook his anchor and he could pull you into the house of God this morning it's by his word that he's doing this it's it's not by your strength it's by his strength all we've got to do is let go and be led say Lord enough's enough I'm being led by the spirit of God haven't we had enough of trying to turn the car ourself on where would we be amen Shipwrecked on the side of the road but there's something else within us thank you Jesus Oh my Hallelujah come on now how many times have you said in yourself I'm done Brother Sam how many times you said I'm giving up I'm just going to go do my own thing going my own way too many to count amen buddy too many to count come on I know cuz I've done it I'm not come on Brother come on all right nobody's real nobody's the real deal I'm just going to go go off by myself somewhere and this guy offended me and this guy offended me and this doesn't seem right and this didn't end up right and this was mis mishandled and this was mistreated and I didn't like the way that this was done and before you know it you've got yourself talked into a cycle in your mind and you'll end up giving up but I want to tell you you've all been in that cycle this morning but you ain't give up you're still here this morning somebody just tap yourself on the chest and say I'm here I'm here why are you here because God has put something within you that has brought you back to the house of God this morning that even though when you would have given up you're still here this morning even when you would have walked away you're still here this morning we've got reason after reason after reason why nobody would be in this room but we're here this morning because God rich and mercy has put a seed within us that we couldn't even give up when we wanted to give up but he pulled us all the way into the finish line here we are at the Finish Line friends I say enough is enough lay down every weight lay down every care and run run into the land of promise run into the land of the Holy Ghost run into the land of the message of authority that's where we've been given in this age it's our commission not to lay down and fight and back bite no our commission is to run amen finish it you would have given up if it was up to you that's right but you didn't oh my you might have wandered you might have left church for years but you're here what was it Sister Kim it was the gene seed of God with inside you that even though you were wandering around he hadn't lost you he hadn't lost track of you he didn't he didn't lose place of where you were at but he had his eye on you the whole time and at that time you would be resurrected and that seed would be activated and it would be Quicken to the word and there is nothing that would stop you now from being inside the doors when they're open what was it it was a miraculous thing that happened in your life the supernatural God came down and quickened a seed within you amen you can't explain it you can't put your finger on it you don't know but it's there it's there there's a deposit within you that Christ made before the foundation of the world it's there and at the time he'll activate it why do we have to fear I've got quotes for days on this for fear fear fear fear fear we've got no reason to fear yes amen no reason that's right if we could conquer fear anything is possible fear is the anti to belief if we could conquer fear only believe which means no fear all things somebody say all things and they shall inherit all things because there's no fear within them Hallelujah I love him he says I want you to love him I want you to believe him perfect love cast out all fear and if you love him with the right kind of a heart you won't have one Speck of fear whether you can keep his word or not that's had a power of the devil I just feel to give that to you go search it on your own time you won't have one Speck of fear whether you will keep his word or not Glory because you love him like brother said I don't have to to go talk to my wife and say no you're not going to talk to so and so while I'm out of town you're not going to go out on this Ro you're not going to go over here and she doesn't do the same thing to me why because there's a love Hallelujah so God doesn't have to come to his church and say well you're not going to go listen to this you're not going to go listen to that you're not going to no we wouldn't do it anyway cuz we love him and if we love him we take him at his word and his word says that he already has defeated every enemy his word says that he resurrected and gave gifts unto men and those gifts well what were they they were joy peace longsuffering patience kindness Joy you mean he resurrected and he gave Gifts of Joy Jesus hallelujah hallelujah we've got a we've got a reason to be joyful amen we've got a reason to have a smile on our face we've got to change our our our our idea of what we're doing here if we're down and S and out we don't have the right direction we are purposed and called and chosen and elected we're soldiers woman child man we're soldiers in this walk yeah we go through struggles yeah we get beat up yeah we get H hard but we're still here why are we still here because we're soldiers in this every child Every Woman every sister every Sunday school teacher every audio guy don't matter if you hold a microphone or not you are a warrior you are a warrior in this Faith young or old don't matter you're still here that's right and if you're still here it's because you've got something greater than your own strength within you and he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world you've got more you might not think so but you've got more I use this illustration I hope this is okay I used this a while back with some young people brother R would say and so let your light shine before men he said Christ came in this age to sponsor you all right you're sponsored by Christ now you know what that means to me Branson it means that there's a sponsorship there there's a contract yeah LeBron James is sponsored by Nike right Michael Jordan sponsored by Nike Tiger Woods Nike Cristiano Ronaldo maybe you're a soccer fan Nike now Nike doesn't just give this sponsorship to anybody come on come on you know what Nike means Victory it's the Greek symbol for victory they don't just give that out to anybody brother Amos but they only give it to those that will represent the brand think about that wow and so when they come with when Nike comes to LeBron James and they say we want we want to sponsor you we want you to wear the Nike logo every game every public outing everywhere you go we want you to represent Nike they are they are doing that because they know he's going to be victorious they know this guy's a superstar he's going to win games and the only thing LeBron's got to do is win ball games and not only does Nike give him shirts clothes shoes socks everything he has need of they give him $200 million for anything he might need in the future wow oh and all he has to do is sign a contract but you know there's details in that contract he's not allowed to wear anybody else's brand he's not allowed to wear Reebok he's not allowed to wear Adidas he's not allowed to wear an1 he's not allowed to wear defeat he's only allowed to wear the brand of which he signed up for but when I read that Christ came in this age to sponsor this church I said sign me up he gave me clothes he gave me shirt on my back he gave me he gave me my pants and my shoes he gave me Provisions for the future he gave me everything that I have need of and the only thing that I have to do is walk victoriously and wear nobody else's brand I cannot come in here wearing defeat wearing sorrow wearing wearing suffering wearing regret wearing sickness wearing my head down and wowy Woos I've been sponsored I've been sponsored by Christ almighty and he only wears Victory he's victorious in every battle he's never lost he's never retreated he's never backed up he's never walked away he's never walked with his head down he's victorious in every battle and he has come to sponsor this church this morning G that's good brother God have you signed the contract if you signed the contract then you are obligated you're obligated to only wear what he says about you awesome that is awesome you might come in here and P over your your your label might say I'm I'm barely going to make it or I'm weak in faith or I'm just I'm just pulling myself through this or I don't really know you can only wear what he said you can [Music] wear and to them that overcome amen will I give all all things so instead of wearing defeat we've got to rip that badge off and we've got to put Overcomer right there we've got to rip the badge of sorrow and regret off and we've got to put Victory right there we've got to rip the the badge of wowy woo off our face notify our smile that it still works and say we're walking in Victory we are going to make it we are promised we are promised a victory at this you know they go into battle after battle after battle with no promise that they'll ever win but we have been given a promise of victory in this age we've got no reason to fear amen glory to God we've got no reason to retreat we've got nothing to be ashamed of praise God Amen Hallelujah praise God well you shouldn't quote the prophet and you shouldn't do this I've got nothing to be ashamed of without this there is no Ministry thank you Jesus I don't a Ministry without these quotes and neither do they amen this is the ministry of the hour I'm not ashamed to to declare it to the world I'm not ashamed to say that this is the message of the hour I know where I've been think about this friends that of all the millions of people you are truly one in a million and you might think well my dad was born in this or my mom was born in this and that's why I'm here this but what caused that to happen One in a Million there's no there's no there's no just uh happen stance here you didn't just wander into this but God has set it up that you would come into an intersection where you would bump into him brother Braham says he'll put himself in front of you that you bump into Him Glory Hallelujah Abram was just going through life and he bumped into him Hallelujah glory and the one that knew his name came to his tent and when he spoke his name out it identified that he was the one who gave him the name change and by one Messiah sign Abraham knew this is God this is him he's the one who changed my name I'm not looking for another I'm not looking he immediately said Lord he knew who he was talking to amen when the woman at the well bumped into Jesus it was one Messiah sign and he called her by name and she knew Glory name she knew it was him said we've we've been looking for a prophet like this to come said I am he wow she he didn't have to persuade her into it he didn't have to say look at all these vindications look at all these signs look at all these wonders look at my resume he said I'm he and she said I I knew you'd come I've been waiting for you to come I knew that there would be a promise in this hour that would come wow brother Amos on tape somebody took the time one time there's over 8,6 30 times on recorded tape of the Messiah sign in operation wow praise the Lord calling people by name address phone number detail you were thinking this the doctor put this many vials of blood I think somebody took the time one time 21 21 discernments in one prayer for one individual 21 individual discernments of detail all right brother you could guess you can guess at a lot of things human nature if you grew up on the streets you understand human nature pretty well I grew up in a little rough neighborhood I understand how human nature Works a little bit and you can guess at a lot of stuff people are all kind of the same you're right you can guess right this was not a guess Daniel that's right this Prophet was not guessing amen this was not a 21 individual discernments in one person's life now You' come talk to me and you tell me 21 things about me all right you probably couldn't even tell 21 things about your wife sorry husbands and you know her Josiah give five no they they'd change anyway they'd be different anyways he was not guessing this was not just a stab in the dark say I hope this lands come on Brother come on come on but you see the gift of discernment operates like this when go when Jesus was having that interaction with the woman of the well he wasn't reading your thoughts he was reading her heart and he was looking into her heart and she he was pulling out what was on the inside of her heart and delivering it back to her and no doubt the word has done that many times to you through the operation of Hebrews 4:12 in operation discernment pulling out of what's in your heart and pulling it out to to some of you thought nobody would ever know that but that man spoke exactly well that man had no idea what he was saying but it was the word in operation that is still a discerner of the thoughts and intents of our heart and it's still active today it did not stop in 1965 but Hebrews 4:12 and Hebrews 138 are still the same word today that they were back then amen amen praise the Lord he was not guessing amen but he knew what was on the inside of the heart that's the way a gift of discernment works but this was not just a regular gift of discernment this was the Messiah sign now this was not in my notes and I didn't have this in my mind so we're just going to trust the Lord to go here this morning it was the Messiah sign in operation amen he opened the heart of the woman at the well he opened the heart of Abraham he opened the heart of Sarah and he spoke back to them what was on the inside of their heart and by that they knew this is Supernatural this is God this is Elohim Abraham called him Elohim the highest name in the land Elohim has come MDC has come by just one one one miracle coming out of his heart and in this age Christ has come amen and I'm not just talking about the people on the prayer line think about this that that that the the gift of discernment that fell in this age through the prophet William Brandon will never be matched come on brother now I believe in individual Gifts of discernment in the body where God might give this sister or this brother we've got sisters in our church that have wrote out exact dreams of conversations that happened in the back room of the pastor 's office exactly to detail it's still in operation sure God uses men to tell you what's on the inside of your heart what you were praying about what you were thinking about the the the gift of discernment is in the body but it's not like this gift that was in brother brandom this was the Messiah sign it is the true sign of discernment of the word not not there will not be another we're not waiting for another gift of discernment like that there's only one Prophet to an age and he had the gift of the word in his life now think about this he was able to 8,000 something people and how many people of tape did that gift operate on and he was able to tell them where they were from their name their address their what they were thinking what their brother-in-law said to them the day before and that wasn't a man he wasn't guessing at that it was God it was the operation of discernment opening Hearts amen but something changed in the man's Ministry come on now and that gift of discernment got greater and he got stronger and he began to go into another pole of his ministry so he wasn't just opening the hearts of the people yeah go ahead he was opening and Discerning the heart of God and he was opening the heart of God brother Amos and he was portraying what was inside of the heart of God and he was putting it on display this was not just some gift of discernment but this was a messic sign in our age that would be able to access the very heart of God and bring it back down to us to tell you this is what God thinks about you in his heart that does something to me I don't hear the message of the hour in here I'm not going to make it I don't listen to The Prophet's voice and hear that I'm just not going to have enough faith I don't put on the tape and I feel down and out I'm never going to make it when I put on a message when I put on a tape I hear I'm going to make it I've already made it I've seen you I've seen you on the other side I've seen you in the heart of God I see that you are the The Works of God expressed in this age you're his thoughts cast out you're his you're the back part of his mind on display I've seen it in his heart and that gift of the Messiah sign working and telling me where I am in the heart of God Amen yes oh my I see that brother Bram said this in the church AG book the thoughts of God are Eternal and they are real he says if you can see this you shall see many things let me say church if you could grasp that last statement not because I'm powerful and wise but because it's the truth of the message if you could grasp it you will see many victories in your life this message didn't come to confuse it didn't come to divide or cause doctrinal disputes or who's bigger or who's better or whose church is is nicer it didn't come for any of that it came to open the heart of God into this age it's Way Beyond individual discernments of you came from this town and you came from this there's a water tower and it's blue your house is such and such such it's way bigger than that now there was a turn in the ministry and his ministry began to open up the heart of God and to discern what was on the inside of God's heart and repeat it back to the people and this is what God Said and this is what God thinks that's why he was not guessing brother Kevin but he knew the heart of God don't ever ask me why I'm a message believer you're going to get an earful why do you follow that man what man on why are you worshiping that man what man are you talking about are you talking about the man William Brandon that God so loved that he allowed to be in his picture come on I love that man I've never worshiped him a day of my life that's right I've never bowed down to him I've never baptized in his name I've never ended a prayer in his name I've never let a tape perform my wedding I've never let any of these things I don't worship a man but I worship the light that's hanging over him and if that light would be willing to take a picture with him then I think we ought to give him due credit and we ought to protect him and we ought to stand up for his name and not let it be slandered in the street like it's just some other preacher or he was just some other reformer or he was just some other guy with the microphone no God was so pleased to dwell in that man that he gave him the gift of the Messiah sign that he could open up God chose brother brandom to to be the mouthpiece of his own heart Hallelujah that's why I'm a message believer and that's why I will stay in a message taught church that preaches the message without fear or favor not to cater to this or to pull to that but preach the message preach the message of the hour and it'll set the captive free I don't have to work you up I don't have to psychologize you I don't have to talk you into it just preach the message and the the seed will respond oh I don't like this I don't like that I like the message Hallelujah my appetite is only for the message glory to God blessed is he who hunger and thirsteth after righteousness for he shall somebody say shall he shall be filled Hallelujah promise it's a promise amen shall be filled Hallelujah I can't wait for the church doors to open Sister Kim cuz I am [Music] hungering I am hungering I am thirsting after righteousness and if I know I can come to a place where the word is exalted above a man's opinion where the word is exalted above a theory or a thought or a good idea or a good homedical thought I believe that if we come into the presence of where that word is exalted above all else we shall be filled glory amen glory I think it's enough is enough of coming to church and leaving with empty vessels the message is doing its job are we allowing it to work in our life amen hallu it's come to do what it promised am yes sure it did you can't find a mistake bless the Lord brother Brandon begged brother Terry begged for 30 something years behind a Pulpit please come and tell me where I'm wrong anybody anybody thousands millions of people millions of people got that invitation anybody I'll give you a moment nobody amen crickets Men actually exited the building yeah they did you cannot find a flaw if you take the Bible as your absolute you will not find a flaw in this teaching the man sure as soon as you make it about a man you're off anyways it was never about a man it was about the pillar of fire that came in this age and open the word unto us and if you recognize that it was that light that came in this age and it was that light that struck the lens of that camera and it was that light that struck the lens of your life if you recognize that it was that light you'll never look to the left to the right you'll never try to find a flaw because that light has activated the sea with inside you and by a supernatural light something came awake inside you the same Pillar of Fire the same anointing this the the the same Holy Ghost came into our life and woke us up that's why I'm not looking for another I'm not looking to go somewhere else or to to think about another theology I'm not looking we can quote these men of God spurgeon's a good man and and no doubt pink was a good man and all but they were not the Messiah sign in this age and we can we can share some quotes and some thoughts and they had some good ideas but Spurgeon was a trinitarian why are we going to compare him to the Vindicated word of God I'm not preaching against sharing quotes from Spurgeon I think some of them are really good but don't compare them brother Brandon was not just another preacher he was not just another man with a Pulpit he was not another Billy Graham or an oral Roberts or a Charles Spurgeon he was the Vindicated word mouthpiece of this age and we will not look for another but we will stay only with the word hallelujah hallelujah and when we stay only in the word all fear Glory all fear is gone because I know I Know Who Holds my future every bit of it yes all fear Hallelujah imagine what it's like to wake up and all fear is gone oh oh my not what's going to happen today and it's Monday again Josiah what clients am I going to have to deal with this week but imagine waking up on a morning come on now I'm free praise the Lord I'm free no longer bound yes sir amen no more fear hold in me Glory my if we could wake up that that way every morning thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you Jesus hallelujah thank you Jesus every devil in hell we don't know what to do with them Hallelujah we don't know what to do with them we don't know how to handle them and I'm trying to close here but brother B said there's a place you can go in this word where the devil cannot follow youen he's not free glory to God I'm going say it again the devil ain't free so there's a place you can go where he can't go and it's not great Revelation it's not studying the seal book so hard that you understand every period of it it's a place of Freedom if you have a feeling of disparity in your life that anointing is from a demon come on they were cast out of heaven in despair having no hope for a future and if that's how you feel or that's what you deal with in your life it's an anointing of a devil and it needs to be removed off of your life amen we have a future our Future's clear we know where we're going we know that he's coming back for us we know his future his future is to be cast into the Lake of Fire to have no more trouble to not ever plague another life to not ever come against another believer to not ever bring another accusation he has spent his entire existence accusing you Branson day and night the accuser of the Brethren has accused you day and night but there's coming a day glory and now is Glory when he will be shut up in the Lake of Fire and where will we be walking in Freedom I think it's time we say enough's enough playing around with this devil thank you Jesus stop dwelling where he can access stop dwelling in places where he can get to you he cannot go into Freedom that's right he's not free he's Bound by a chain of circumstance these are all scriptures friends use the word against him he's bound he can't go where you can go Jes if the music players would come we lived in a in a in a community brother Junior knows too much about it uh we driving down the road and they'll be horse and buggies in the middle of the road yeah going maybe 10 miles an hour and you're going 70 come over a hill and there's a horse and buggy in the road and you're slamming on the brakes and watch out and but they do that by choice they do right but 120 years ago that was itm sure that was the climax a horse and buggy right fast as you can get shemaya you got got you got a four team horse man you were on the roll that's as fast as you could go then came the car slow at first little model T P maybe get three four miles faster than a horse harder to drive than a horse then a couple years down the road another car come out a little faster a little faster bigger engine brother bam said that they thought that they could reach the speed of 30 m an hour they lift off the Earth and be gone into atmosphere broke the sound barrier in 60s sometime maybe late 50s I don't remember when it was nobody thought that ever be possible come on then the plane came faster than any car could ever go a little rough at first they got it figured out they got it stabilized and now we can cross the globe and few [Music] minutes they thought that's the fastest they'd ever go but then came the rocket yes sir they thought there's a moon out there I'd like to go to that Moon little shaky at first couple mess ups couple mishaps yeah yeah come on but they got it yeah they got it and now that rocket is open where anybody with enough money but you see what I find interesting junior is in the same age where Tesla is sending people up in Rockets I can come over a hill in Ohio and there's a person in a buggy that's as much as they want to access you can stay in some old cold formal religion you can stay in the light of another age you can stay back having to having to deal with what what the man with the books once told you or you can actually look at the word for yourself and you can enter into a place of Liberty where the devil cannot go he's not built to go where you can go he's not built to climb where you can CL CL he physically is incapable of getting to where you can get in the word I think enough is enough of of dwelling down here in this realm where he can access us and he can pick on us and he can kick us around and he's got authority over us we're still in his land I think it's time we cross there's a land just across there I think it's time I think it's time we take a step H I'm done enough's enough amen instead of throwing in the towel on this belief why don't you throw in the towel of dealing with the devil and say enough's enough I'm pulling the gloves off I'm going higher than you can go I'm going deeper than you can go I'm getting to such a place of Liberty and freedom in my spirit that you'll never know you'll never taste of it you'll never be able to set foot in that land you'll never have a freedom in your mind like I'm going to have you'll never have an authority in your voice like I'm going to have I am the Bride of Jesus Christ I am the one fulfilling the word in this age she has become him bone of his bone flesh of his flesh the alpha has become the Omega it's time we enter into a place where he cannot go Glory he doesn't have access to it but you do that's good brother that's good I'm no longer Slave To [Applause] Fear I am a child God oh how no father me oh [Music] I oh you unravel me with the me you suround me with a s from my enemies till all my fears are G I'm no longer a slave [Music] to yes I a child of [Music] God you have chosen me your love [Applause] [Music] has morning [Music] Hallelujah are you free this morning I am a child of God oh I'm no longer chained down by [Music] fear I am a child of God you split the sea so I could walk right through it my fears are drown in perfect love you rescue me so I can stand and say I am a child of God oh you split the sea so I could walk right through it my fears are drowned in perfect love you rescue me so I can stand and sing I am a child of God oh yes I am a child child of God yes I am a child of God hallelujah hallelujah something he will never be able to say I am a child of God I've been bought with a price washed in the blood I've got a future I've got an eternity I know where I came from I know where I'm going something the devil will never be able to say he doesn't have access to that he doesn't have access to This Promise you've been given and This Promise is to you thank you Jesus it's to you it's not to your neighbor it's not just for your daddy or your mom or your sister or so and so or the pastor or the preacher This Promise men and Brethren This Promise is to you and to your children and to as many as are far off as many as the Lord Our God shall call God to our children yep why do you think Peter worded it like that it's your promise but it's also the promise for your children amen and your children's children praise the Lord you don't think God's able to wake up the seed within them some come off church pews some are just Hypocrites workers of iniquity but one day the seed woke up maybe they didn't have that night and day transformation cuz they played the part well but something woke up inside them amen for others maybe they're out in drugs alcohol and women maybe just the life that they don't care about church they don't care about this they think you're in a wrong thing or they think about this or that but the seed Glory that's right prevails over every Circumstance the seed prevails over every inability Abraham was just a regular Idol worshiper yes sir but the [Music] seed and the only thing that wakes that seed up is the quickened word the same pillar of the fire one moment thank you Jesus one moment that gift of discernment would go to work in a little cabin one time that Messiah sign and he would access the heart of God and God would tell him what do you need he'd say I need a squirrel that squirrel would come and he would take that witness back to a little cabin brother Amos it she didn't have an LL she didn't have a PhD she didn't have a dictionary that's right it wasn't even good English brother Terry but she believed the message that came forth so much with everything that was in her she said that ain't nothing but the truth Glory thank you Jes Brother Sam it wasn't a worked up emotion there wasn't some glorious thing that came down he said that ain't nothing but the truth but when she said that he said that the anointing in that room was greater than the anointing at the dawn of creation Now you think about that if a daughter of God who don't have two cents to her name in a little old cabin that leaked and was and was not windproof and didn't have running water they didn't have a bathroom inside if if a little old can access that kind of anointing by saying the message ain't nothing but the truth then how about you this morning how about you who know the book from front to back how about you that know every promise in here that's available to you how about you that have no excuse of why we are walking in defeat this morning when we've been given total Victory it ain't nothing but the truth oh but you don't know how far my kids are gone hady right didn't think about it that's right he said that anointing that dropped in there I can imagine I've been in some anointings in my life I don't even know how she got the words out wow anything your heart desires will be given unto you oh my she didn't say well if my kids have a seed Hallelujah This Promise is unto you and unto your children and unto your children's children and to as many as our Lord God shall call PA This Promise is yours and she activated the promise of Acts 2 in that little cabin and said I claim the life of my two boys Amen brother amamos I don't know how it works we say you can't take out you can't take out uh uh uh uh self-will but what about that right something in them was greater than their own self-will something in them was greater than their own desires or what they had focused on something in them was greater and that light struck the lens of that seed with inside them and it'll do the same thing for you and for your children and to as many as our Lord God shall call I think it's time we activate the promise hallelujah amen hallelujah amen to God from my mother's womb you have chosen me your love has called my name I been Born Again into your family oh your blood flows through my veins I'm no longer as Slave To [Music] Fear I am a child of God yes I'm no longer a Slave To Fear oh I am a child of God Heavenly Father Lord for this assembly here this morning Lord oh God I pray that a revelation would strike a freedom in the building father Lord to know that they don't have to be under the bondage of the spirit of fear again but they can walk free as children of the of of the Kingdom that cannot be shaken a kingdom that will not lose a kingdom that will not fail but Lord we've been given access to enter into a promised land and Lord we can we can choose to lay down here in this Valley and ride a buggy and a horse or Lord we can choose to enter into another vehicle a vehicle where the devil can't reach us a place where he cannot go somewhere in the word where he can't access us and Lord I pray that you'd open our eyes father as your Prophet said oh Samson said my eyes have been blinded long enough Lord enough is enough Lord I pray that you'd Open Eyes Lord to recogniz ize that we're not we don't have to just take what we've been given we don't have to take the Mind battles that we deal with we don't have to take the nervousness and the neurotics and the an anxiousness and we don't have to just take it but Lord there's a place we can go in perfect healing where the devil cannot reach us we don't have to just take the cancer and the diabetes and the and the upsets we don't have to take the ulcers and the acid stomachs we don't have to take these things but there's a place we can go in the word where the devil cannot reach us and he battle against us it doesn't shake our faith though he though he war and War and rage against us as a roaring lion it cannot shake our faith CU we are planted on a ground that cannot be moved a kingdom that cannot be shaken oh Lord God I thank you for your people this morning Lord I pray you bless them in a mighty way Lord father I pray that Lord if there's one that's still in shackles or chains Lord they take a step into Liberty this morning take a step into into a realm of worship an atmosphere of Praise Lord take a step into an atmosphere of thankfulness Lord that's the source of our worship Lord It's a heart crying out thank you Lord thank you God for me for choosing me thank you for putting a seed in me I who was unworthy and Lord I wasn't looking for you but
