be the right Refuge Amen in this hour that we're living in and it's good to be in the house Lord and uh good to just see everyone sister Pats it's good to see you amen and the musicians can be dismissed if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the Book of Psalms the 23rd chapter and we want to remember brother Mark Spencer is going to be having his meeting on Memorial Day weekend which would be May 26th I think it's just Friday and Saturday I it may be Sunday too but I believe brother Ron and brother Barry will be speaking and those nights I think brother Ron Friday and brother Berry Saturday I think that's how it went but so if you're able to go I'm sure you will be blessed and will be a blessing to them praise the Lord let's just bow our heads before we read the word and just ask the Lord to help us tonight precious Lord we thank you that you are our refuge in times of trouble and Lord we see trouble all throughout the land and Lord we're just thankful father that we're hit in you have that token applied and Lord just asking now that you would come and you administer to every need tonight father a novel speaker and hearer prayed Lord that you would cover us with your blood father if there's anything that we have done said Lord we pray that you would forgive us of it father Lord I pray that you would just draw us all closer to thee we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord let's say it's good to have Mom with us amen always good to have them we've just enjoyed having her dad dad is feeling pretty weak today and so if you want to just keep him in prayer I know he would appreciate that but the book of Psalms the 23rd chapter it says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want. he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me amen you can have your seats this evening beautiful day to serve the Lord and trust everyone just had a good day amen but we've been looking at this chapter in verses for for a while now and of course David says the Lord is my shepherd and and we know him to be our guide and I I think that is the true uh well the Bible says they that are the sons of God are led by the spirit of God and so it's it's important that he be our guide and that we be his sheep and he considers us as sheep because sheep are lead sheep can't find their way and we know that we are led by his voice which is the word of God and I'm so glad that we have had the word of God the word of God not being a theology it's not some Seminary teaching but the word of God come to a prophet in this age to restore us back to the word and so I'm glad that we can accept the the message of the hour uh as our headship amen it's more than just a teaching it's it's the headship that has come to lead and guide us and then David would tell us that he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures and we talked about these things but you know uh uh uh lying down it's he maketh me to rest in Green Pastures and Green Pastures is where the food is it's it's it's Green Pastures which speaks of life amen it's fresh it's life and and so that's that's where amen Our Shepherd leads us to in this age and he leadeth me beside the Steel Waters and of course Waters also speaks of life and and it's a place of of rest a quiet place for their Still Waters and and if there's ever a time that the people of God needed to stay quiet it's it's in this age a lot of turmoil a lot of upheaval a lot of things that are going on a lot of voices in the land and and but yet the shepherd uh by his voice and I say by the message of the hour leads us to a quiet place it's and that's where the life is a man and and of course first uh chapter of Psalms David talks about the rivers of water and and how that there's a the man that is is planted we're planted by the rivers of water and and the prophets that planted means predestinated you're you didn't come there by chance you're not just stuck out and transplanted but you were predestinated to be there amen that's your position in Christ Is by The Still Waters in in Green Pastures and and I'm so glad that we have a a we're finding our purpose we're not just accidentally come to this message but this is what we were predestinated for it it it it it fits us ain't that right and so then then in that third verse is what we've been talking for about for for a few services and that is he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness and and and of course this is the same path that proverbs 4 18 speaks of where it says the path of the just is as a Shining Light that shineth more and more unto a a perfect day it and so it's uh uh getting brighter in other words and this is the path of the righteous and and church if there's any time ever a time that the the the revelation of the Bible is more clear it's now amen the mysteries of God being made known is now and it wasn't just made known by a prophet but it's now being made known by You and I by Our Lives because we have become a living voice amen the word of God taking uh having the preeminence in our lives and and so it's the path of righteousness and this word righteousness of course brother Branham said is his word a man so he's leading Us in the paths of his word and and and we we've used that scripture uh where Jesus said it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness to fulfill all word we are to fulfill all the word that was spoken of the bride of Christ do you believe that it could not be fulfilled until this time others have talked about it they've lived for it they've they've sung about it they preached about it and and wrote about it but here we are in this day we are the the the finale we are the the people where God is able to fulfill his word in us and and and what a great responsibility that is for you and I that it's not it's more than just going to church it's more than just claiming a religion it's more than even just believing in a prophet because we there there's others that believe in prophets and and and these things and others have claimed to be prophets and they still claim to be prophets and and all of that but but we find that God would send us a prophet and we saw it Vindicated of God and and and his message is actually taking form in our lives amen and so brother Branham said we are called to walk straight down that line of scripture to fulfill all God's righteousness of today amen so that's what we're here for amen and we couldn't fulfill all righteousness if this word hadn't been opened up to us but this word now is is is is is opened up to us it's no longer a mystery it's not us just proven and and trying to figure it all out but actually it's become a mirror to us can you say man we're finding ourselves more and more that that God was writing about us all throughout the Bible he was writing about us and and you say well the the theme is Jesus Christ Cincinnati is true but it's Christ in you amen it's Christ in you so you're part of the book you're you're part of the mystery for that's what the Bible says the mystery is Christ in you the hope of glory amen and and so we we're finding a man that we're walking this is what we're called to do he leadeth Us in the paths of his word in the paths of righteousness and and and in other words we have been commissioned do you believe that we have been commissioned we're not just here floating around we're we're not just here by abiding our time of these things but we have been commissioned to this word amen right right here and and the word commission is an authorization or command to act in a prescribed manner or to perform a prescribed acts amen it's a charge unto us the church has been given a charge the church has been given a a commission amen the authority to act in a subscribed way the churches have tried to do it denominations have tried to reform the people into doing uh uh to live in this word and to making this word live legalists have come and tried to make the people uh live this word and they have all failed but God would open the word to us in this age and by his voice he would lead us in the very Paths of righteousness that people have tried to do for years and years and years so we find that that we as the bride of Christ are commissioned and the commission is the predestinated will of God Amen it's the predestinated will of God you're not here by accident amen but you're here and and we we know we read about it uh talked about it uh uh last time uh but Jesus was predestinated to be what he was ain't that right he was predestinated every part of the scripture was predestinated that spoke of the Messiah amen was predestinated for him and he was predestinated for that scriptures for he he told them he said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but they testify of who I am and so is it that the scriptures testify of who this bride is because it's a predestinated plan of God God it's it's a predestinated will of God and so Jesus knew his position in the word and we've read this but brother Branham said Jesus Christ no matter if he was in a storm and The gales knocking the boat from one side to the other or he was standing in the face of demons if he was hanging anywhere it never moved him he walked right along just as calm and quiet as he could be why he was simply unconscious of fear or anything around him that's right whether it was going to happen or whether it wasn't going to happen he knowed it was going to happen because God said so he didn't say well I wonder if I prayed through wonder if I fasted long enough wonder if I did this he just walked right on unconscious that's right he believed what God Said was truth the words must be fulfilled he knew what his life was to fulfill them so he knew that his life was to to fulfill the very words amen he said and you're here to fulfill it too so just walk unconscious of fear walk unconscious of criticism walk unconscious of the world walk as you walk in Christ walk with him not paying any attention to the right to the left hand just keep moving on something comes up in the church walk with God hallelujah sickness strikes you walk with God if the neighbor don't like you walk with God just keep on Walking with God can you say amen amen why because we were predestinated for a certain thing and it must be fulfilled and he's leading us amen he's leading us uh uh God ain't gonna Lead You amen uh uh in in a trash sheep somewhere amen that's not God leading amen God's God's going to lead you in his word ain't that right there ain't no such thing as burnt out amen not when you're walking with God not when you're you're in the past of God Amen uh uh sure you get discouraged sure yet all of these things as we talked about Sunday their seasons in our life but but regardless of of what takes place we're called it never changes God's predestinated will for us you believe that it just doesn't change amen and so now Noah amen the prophet said Noah and all the prophets they they that the Saints of old they knew their position amen for their day and was willing to stand criticism or anything else that the word of God might be fulfilled amen uh God never gave me Noah a man an e a bed of ease he didn't give them a life of these amen he didn't give it amen the promise when Noah wanted that promise he gave Noah the promise and told him to preach that promise amen and act upon that promise live upon that promise promise and and know it was so persuaded of that promise a man he didn't care how long it would take he knew it was common to Reign and he would prepare for it and the Bible says that he prayed for the prepared for the saving of his household amen he didn't care who would stand with him he knew that he was doing it amen for his household can you say amen and we're doing it for our household amen saved you may not be popular in this world but it doesn't matter amen you may not be whatever it doesn't matter you've got to be persuaded of your position in the word of God to where you can stand amen Against All Odds amen so that the word of God might be fulfilled brother random said you cannot do anything unless you know what you're doing amen so so don't try to serve God if you don't know what you're doing you got to know what you're doing amen I just don't believe that God doesn't bear witness where the Bible says his Spirit bearth witness with our spirit that we are sons of God Amen that ain't going to be when we get into heaven that ain't going to be when we receive a body change I believe that spirit is with us I believe that spirit is confirming to us that we are the sons of God whether we feel God or not we are the sons of God whether it looks like the sun is shining or it's just stormy all over we are the sons of God Amen and we're willing to stand though that the word can be fulfilled and he said you must know that it is the will of God Amen you must know amen don't don't just you know don't we're not playing the Patty Cake don't try to play patty cake with the devil amen don't try to venture without Authority in pursuing you've got to know that it's the will of God for your life you got to know that the Rapture is the will of God you got to know amen that salvation is the will of God for you you got to know that this message is the will of God for you you got to know that every promise in this Bible is the will of God God for you can you say amen that's the only way you're going to stand that's the only way that you're gonna amen with stand the devil in this hour amen is to know the will of God see he said you must know that it is his plan and his desire and it's revealed to you then there's nothing going to stop it so see Noah built the ark not on presuming not upon a good idea not because he ate a bowl of cereal and felt good from him and decides to build an ark that it was revealed to him that he was the one to build the ark amen and he acted upon that revelation now if he'd done that and he waited for 120 years so withstood the criticism and the making fun and and all that unbelief amen then we can't expect anything less Amen in this age can you say amen amen that's right so now the prophet said after Noah had met God and had no God's plan for the day it was becoming to him that he fulfilled all that he was commissioned to do amen it was becoming Noah to Noah amen he it had been revealed to him God had called him God had bore witness to him amen that it was going to rain amen and that he was the one to build the ark amen and so is it in in this age amen if you get nothing out of the message of the hour but a confirmation that you're the one amen now that that's what the message of the hour is you understand amen is that when you hear the message there's something that strikes your heart and say is that's me that's right that's the one I'm the one I'm the one for a Rapture I'm the one for a body change I am what John lived out I am the one amen that all the tell Testament prophets and and sages talked about I'm that one it's a confirmation you're not always going to feel that confirmation you're not always going to feel amen like they're running through a man you're not always going to feel like you're in Revival but the Revelation must stay and you must stay true to the revelation you got to stay true he leads me in the paths of righteousness ain't that right so so after Moses even a man had met with God at the burning bush amen see he then knew his position and he was willing to face all criticism he was willing to face All Odds amen because he had received a revelation from God that he was the one he'd received the revelation of his day ain't that right more than just intellect amen it was a divine revelation now David tells us that it's not going to be easy walking the paths of righteousness amen oh it sounds glorious he leadeth me in these Paths of righteousness amen but but it's not going to be easy amen and and uh uh even though we we know that we have been commissioned to fulfill the word of God and we know our position in the word yet it's not going to be easy we talked about it Sunday amen don't expect it to be easy the Bible says the just shall live by faith do you believe that the just shall live by faith you know what that means then faith will deny every sense amen it'll deny all your five senses when when you can't see it faith says it's there when you can't feel it faith says it's real can you say Amen so you cannot live by what you see you can't live by what you feel you can't live by any other sins you've got to live by faith and faith is a revelation faith comes by Revelation that's right same God reveals it to us so it doesn't take Faith when everything is going easy it doesn't take endurance amen when there's no troubles ain't that right amen when when you're going down the hill it doesn't take endurance hey Vance when you going up that mountain and you're breathing hard and you're barely making it your legs are burning yeah I have that old time and and and you you know yeah you know you just don't know if you can make it and and and and your mind is already back in the vehicle but but you got to make it right well that's the Christian way ain't that right it's the Christian way amen that's why Jesus said he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved amen he didn't tell you how life it was going to be he didn't give us all the answers to the questions amen that come our way but he said just endure to the End Amen and you'll never be able to endure it without faith ain't that right amen yes sir see so you don't have to make a stand if there is an opposition but it's in the opposition time of opposition that you have to make a stand ain't that right so it's not going to be easy walking amen uh uh uh uh these Paths of righteousness for the next thing David says is for though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death now you know see while God is leading Us in the paths of righteousness we're walking through the valley of the shadow of death now the prophet said that people say well it's a dark Valley he said no it cannot be dark it can't be a dark Valley yeah uh if there's a shadow ain't that right he said it takes so much light and we know it it takes so much light and so much Darkness to make a Shadow Amen in other words there has to be truth and there ain't that right sickness and healing faith and unbelief love and hate God and Satan see light and darkness causes a shadow in the valley ain't that right amen so in other words he's not leading Us in the paths of righteousness when we get to heaven amen he's leading Us in the paths of righteousness in the Valley of the shadow of death now Paul you know in speaking of the Old Testament said that it was a shadow of good things to come the law was the shadow of good things to come in other words it wasn't all dark there amen but there was some light that was there ain't that right light in the Old Testament yes we see the fall of Adam and Eve but then we see Redemption amen the act of redemption The Plan of Redemption there was sin but yet there was an atonement there was the law of condemnation but there was the grace of God Amen that abounded see it it brought forth a shadow ain't that right now if you want to look at it look at us amen see we are both natural and Supernatural this body is subject to death amen we come born of a home and see amen We Are The Offspring of Adam and Eve amen so that makes our body born in sin shaping and iniquity come into this world speaking lies see and every one of us the prophet said are damned and condemned at the beginning of our life without a chance ain't that right see he says see because the spirit that you have uh come to you by nature and by Nature coming from sexual intercourse by Desire by man and woman produces an Earthly child let that child alone and don't teach him nothing right he'll go wrong don't teach him neither right or wrong he'll take wrong because it's his nature to do such ain't that right amen watch a little infant child out get mad and kick and hold its breath and turn red you know and and uh throw that temper tantrum well he got it he had that child either got it from mama or daddy or or yeah Mama or daddy and the prophet said if he didn't get it from them he got it from the grandparents but somewhere in that nature that family tree comes to Nature ain't that right see amen so so he said you come by a nature and your whole body or your whole being is black and smutty and Damned and cursed and going to hell ain't that right amen see that's the Dark Side of us amen but then the prophet says but when a man is Born Again seek them the light of God shines down into that soul and it's no more a dark Valley but it's a valley with a shadow in it ain't that right see it's it's a shadow see amen there's both light and darkness amen reflected see amen we we've got corruption yet we're we're we're full of interruption amen we got death amen within us yet we've got life within us ain't that right we're dying individuals but we know there's a life that's in us and we're Eternal beings that we cannot die amen see it's a shadow we are the Shadows so it's no more a dark Valley but it's a valley with a shadow in him he said you may be veiled here with the Flesh and with things known by faith but there's enough light that's in there ain't that right amen see so one of these days and this is what we're looking for amen that light and darkness won't be mixed together amen but they will actually separate oh I'm so looking forward to that amen the spirit of Darkness won't be there anymore or amen sickness won't be there anymore crying and the tears and the broken heart and the loneliness and the despair won't be there anymore the suffering and the pain and the agony won't be any there we'll be in light forever and the Darkness will flee but until then amen were in a shadow where there's light and darkness ain't that right amen that's why you can have the Holy Ghost to still go through your trials amen that's why you can have and be sealed with the Holy Ghost and Satan will put in your mind that you're lost and you're not going to make it and all of these things it's a shadow amen here we're walking in a shadow where there's light and darkness now notice Isaiah 60 and 1 rise Shine for thy lightest come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee that sounds wonderful ain't that right but that's not done in heaven that's not done it's done right here in Earth where there's Darkness because watch for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness to people but the Lord shall rise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee can you say amen amen but it doesn't take away the Mind battles it doesn't take away the pressure it doesn't take away that our sub bodies will get sick it doesn't take away the fact that you got to persevere it doesn't take away the fact that you got to keep a pressing on and you got to look to Christ amen and don't look to left to right you're in a valley a shadow of death yes sir that's right seeing the prophet said see if we're coping with the light of the day right the light of the day if you're walking in them lights Amen in in the paths of righteousness he said then we are shadows of light we're Shadows of light aren't you glad for that in a dark World we're Shadows amen and and I want to sit this way we're the what's making the shadow amen if it hadn't been for the people of God the children of line this world would be dark but there are shadows or there's lights Amen in this world that's making the shadow can you say man amen so now the prophet says you can look out and say well I I see the sun you know you see well you're not looking at the summit you're seeing the daylight amen you say well I see the sun well no in all reality you're seeing a reflection of the Sun ain't that right he said you see the shadow of the sun it's a reflection of the sun it isn't the sun itself but it proves that there is a sun it proves there is a son ain't that right well tonight we're moving tonight we you saying amen tonight we are clapping our hands raising our hands tonight all of these things which tells us that we're living ain't that right we're not dead we're not corpse we're living ain't that right seed but does the prophet said it can't be real life because it's got death in it we're living but it can't be real life because it's got death in it but notice what he says you're reflecting a lie from somewheres if you are a Christian this being a shadow it only proves that there is a life where you cannot die because this life has death in it but it's a shadow because you're living moving creature with abilities to see think move talk with the five senses of the body but yet you know they're dying ain't that right we're alive but our our hair is turning gray amen we're getting more wrinkled we're getting more feeble amen we're not as young brother Tim as we used to be amen see what is it we're alive but it's not the real life because there's death that is setting in so we're just a reflection see you know they're dying there's so much trouble you know see it's a reflection amen there's life and death that is mixed together he says in another place the physical has to die but if you are reflecting by your mortal life the light of heaven then you reflect in eternal life God ain't that right then when you die you can no more go to that line because that's what you've reflected if you're of the Dark World you reflect that and you and you can do or go no other way but to Darkness so we are in a reflection so we're walking through the valley of the shadow of death we're in a reflection see amen uh uh uh he said we so we see that and sure is the holy spirit Spirit reflects light and life so does death reflect Darkness ain't that right see so so he says see if I see a man walking fine looking young man in a few years watch his hair turn gray and slip out his shoulders droop down a beautiful young girl standing with a sainted Godly face on her and standing praising God I come back in a few years and find her Stoops shouldered packing two or three children well my see there it shows that in that body there is death he said no matter how well it is and how lovely it looks it's still got death in it he said now I watch which way that spirit in their leans if it's always representing the light speaking of the light talking of the light it'll go with the light oh Shadows ain't that right but if it's always on the other side of the world the things of the world influenced by the world there's nothing but it to turn into darkness when it dies into outer Darkness ain't that right so we are reflecting we are in a shadow here and and whatever you're reflecting amen uh or what your your your reflection of either light or Darkness see amen this why amen I look at the Christians and I see Death setting in I see the sickness and I see what the doctor says amen there's no hope and there's no this and there's no that and and and mortally uh uh humanly speaking there is no hope amen but they don't reflect that oh yeah their body speaks of it amen you see signs of of uh deterioration you see signs of whatever amen but then down inside they're reflecting an eternity and that's what every one of us is doing I hope I'm making sense to you I know it's simple but but hopefully it'll encourage you we are reflecting something that's right it'd be wonderful to stay in the atmosphere of Revival and when I say that I mean the meetings that we just had and and and everybody going to join together and and and and and such an atmosphere and all these things but but we know good and well that that that that's only temporary then we all go home and we all face our battles we all go back to the same humdrum of life ain't that right amen we Face the oppositions we Face the uh uh the daily tasks of life and in all of these things amen but still we are a reflection we are reflection now see so now if you're looking at nothing but a shadow and you've never seen the object but you just see the shadow then but yet we see that the object is making the shadow then you can still get the idea of what the object is and what it will be in reality by looking at the shadow for the shadow is only reflecting the object do you believe that I can look at you and see that there's a heaven I can look at you and see that there's a God I can look at you and see in your troubles and in your trials and know that there is a living reality to the things that we preach about and you say Amen amen he says now we know what Christ was as a shadow the way he manifested himself so isn't that something he's putting Christ as a shadow Christ being the Shadow and we're looking at Christ as the Shadow the way he manifested himself as a shadow he says now we know back there what he done now it must be reflected in US you understand what I'm saying he said it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness and we can look at that and then see a man that we are to do the same thing the gospel Christ the way he reflected it there the way he reflects it today ain't that right the way you reflected the gospel back then is the same way he reflects the gospel today not defeated not powerless but this gospel is nothing but Power this gospel is Victorious this gospel is an overcoming this gospel Reigns this gospel saves this Gospel Hill this gospel delivers there's power in the gospel he proved it and he's still proven it in US you believe it that makes him the same yesterday today and forever so God has commissioned us to fulfill all the word everybody say all the word eliteth me in the paths of righteousness no don't pick what path you take you're a sheep he's the shepherd he's doing the leading and sometimes we may look at it and say there's no way I can do it but if your sheep you'll follow and notice he leads us he's commissioned us to fulfill all the word for this day while we walk through this Valley of shadow of death but if you notice David said I will fear no evil for thou art with me I'll fear no evil are you with me walking through the valley of the shadow of death being led to these Paths of righteousness yet it tells us that there's going to be evil that tries to come upon you Satan gonna try to take you out he tried to take Jesus out every day ain't that right see but you know what when you're walking in the in the paths of righteousness do you realize you're in the line of duty you're in the line of duty fulfilling God's word is the line of duty for the believer right fulfilling see we we put all the sometime we put all of our energy and other things that you weren't called for other things yes you got to work but that's not what you're called for God didn't put you on on this Earth to be the electrician hello God didn't put you on this Earth to be the the world's billionaire God didn't put you on this Earth to do whatever he put you on this Earth if you're part of this bride you are predestinated to fulfill all the word ain't that right and he'll take you through whatever he wants to take you through to fulfill it that's his prerogative he took Jesus led him up on the mountain to be tempted that was part of the the plan ain't that right let him to the temple where Jesus could take the scriptures and say this day this scripture is fulfilled and leave all the priests perplexed but that was part of the plan he was led to Samara the Samaria amen for that little woman at the well but that was part of the plan he had a thousands of the five thousand not encounting children and and women and and and and he multiplied amen the fishes and Loaves that was part of the plan but he did not forsake the plan he wasn't looking for popularity that's why I was willing to leave them five thousand and go down or the fifteen thousand or whatever the thousands it was Amen to go down to that little woman at the well that's why he was willing Amen to go down to to Simon's house amen no one amen they didn't believe in him no and they were going to ridicule him but there was a lady there that was going to come to him it was part of the plan right part of the plan Golgotha was part of the plan Gethsemane was part of the plan being rejected was part of the plan and all that time he was in the line of duty you believe it you're in the line of duty when you're in Revival you're in the line of duty when you're not in Revival when you're fulfilling this word you're in the line of duty sometimes we think God changes his mind on things and we begin to think that when everything is not going as well I don't know if you've ever had problems with things going well Money in the Bank driving the nice new car and everything just hunky-dory ever you're receiving the applauds of men your boss is just you know giving you a raise giving you a new position and I don't know if you've ever had that problem when all that's going on to say I wonder I just don't know if this is the will of God usually we always attach these things to God blessing God approving God God uh God's with us God's sign of love and it's usually when we're struggling when the money dwindles when the boss ain't just so favorable when everybody's not packing us on the back and we're struggling in life it's usually then that we start questioning can you say Amen but see if he's the shepherd and you're the Sheep he's going to lead you wherever he wants to because it's the paths of right this word must be fulfilled the word must be fulfilled it takes the struggles it takes the battles for victories ain't that right so as long as as Moses was fulfilling the commission that God gave him then he was in the line of duty the prophet said see he was in the line of duty because he was trying to achieve something for the glory of God now remember he tried to do it he tried to achieve something without the will of God without a revelation but he had gotten the revelation he had received his Commission now I put him in the line of duty is that right brother Brown said no matter how bad it was how evil it looked and how much it was talked about the spirit in Moses directed him straight to the line of duty it was the spirit in Moses that directed him straight to that line of duty that's true and the Holy Spirit Will direct you got the Holy Ghost it'll direct you do the line of duty ain't that right yes sir brother Brown said if you see a person with a great gift trying to do something to glorify themselves your own discernment of the spirit tells you that's wrong and see and that that's how you discern spirits you don't judge the man you judge the spirit that's in that man no matter what gift they've got no matter how anointed they are no matter what if they're trying to glorify themselves with that gift that's the wrong thing for the spirit of God will lead you straight in the line of duty Amen to walk the paths of righteousness to fulfill the word of God can you say Amen and remember when Moses received his commission it didn't take the enemy away from him it didn't take away the fact that there was a threat on Moses's life you didn't take away the obstacles from Moses can you say Amen and so is it today Church you're called to reflect Jesus Christ on this on this Earth not in heaven not when the devil's chained up by a chains of circumstance but while you're walking in this Valley of shadow of death can you say Amen you're called to reflect so it doesn't take away the obstacles we Face your faith is going to be challenged your your jaw is going to be challenged your your stand is going to be challenged you want me tested and try it let's look at it Exodus 14 and 1. is this all right and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel that they turn and encamped before uh that word it's a certain place between mcdole and the Sea over against Bale zephon before it you shall shall you encamp by the sea for Pharaoh now notice for Pharaoh will save the children of Israel they are entangled in the land the Wilderness hath shut them in now God's leading them on the paths of righteousness Moses was commissioned he received the revelation of god of what he was going to do but God was still in charge ain't that right God doesn't give you a commission and then he just leaves you up to figure it out he's still in charge and he's leading that notice where he's leading them and he already knows that when they get there Pharaoh is going to respond to this and he'll say of the children of Israel they're entangled in the land the Wilderness has shut them in and I will harden Pharaoh's heart that he shall follow after them and I will be honored upon pharaoh and upon all his hosts that the Egyptians may know that I am the Lord and they did so and it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled and the Heart of pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people and they said why have we done this that we have let Israel go from serving us God Harden the heart and he made ready his Chariot and took his people with him and he took 600 chosen chariots and all the Chariots of Egypt and captains over every one of them and the Lord hardened the heart of pharaoh king of Egypt and he pursued after the children of Israel and the children of Israel went out with an high hand but the Egyptians pursued after them all the horses and Chariots of pharaoh and the horsemen and his army overtook them in camping by the Sea besides uh beside that place before belzephon so see when a Believer is in the line of duty mark it down all hell comes after him all hell is against him take your stand upon the mess of the hour and you watch all hell will come against you start for what start not just Amen in the message of the hour but start applying it to your life start confessing what God says about it today start believing in it start acting upon it and watch all hell come against you see we then become a target for the enemy for you young sisters any of you ladies but brother Brian said young ladies he said these little girls here beautiful little things see you brought up you're brought up to here to have long hair and dress right but you will be a target for Satan is that right just just teaching our children the the right way makes them a Target for the devil sure does then he tells you keep the power of God over you all the time don't never let it leave this great precious Jewel that God has come into your hearts by the baptism of the Holy Ghost given this happy enjoying another place brother Brown says he talks about brother Carlson he says he just made a statement that these ministers Ministries what they've had to go through to make them Ministries and how true Brother Joseph standing by me he said well he said if you're not a soldier then you're not shot at if you're just playing Church you're not shot at if you're just going along with the popular vote and opinions you're not shot at you're just going the way that everybody goes you're not shot at and you say Amen he said I thought that was pretty well placed for that's right and as the battles rage why you become a real Target see As Time and Eternity come together you're becoming the target brother Bill hope you understand because Satan is doing his best to defeat God's purpose now we already know that he ain't going to be able to do it but what did the prophet say he'll get you to doubt your weapon which is the word of God he'll get you to doubt these promises and you know how good and well he does it he gets you to doubt the fact that them belong to you I know God is real I know God Saves I know God's going to have a bride but where he comes down to is you to where you begin to question but is it for me how many's ever had that happen you've had it happen what is it you become a Target he says see there's only one thing to do only one thing to do put on the whole armor of faith stand true to God and March forward ain't that right that's all God's Army does not retreat it goes on many of them drop off to the side and start this that or the other but the army of God marches forward we're going right on and on how many is going on by the grace of God we're going on see you're walking you're walking through this Valley of shadow of death but yet he's leading you in these Paths of righteousness you realize the bride you're a people on the Earth the only ones on the earth and when I say you I'm talking about worldwide bride of Christ the only people and very few they are that has actually been able to fulfill the word for this age you're the completion of the book you're the completion of God's mind you're the finale you're the Final Touch they try to do it that churches have tried to try to manufacture it it couldn't happen but Satan can't take you and that's what makes you the biggest target someone asked brother Brown said is it possible for a holy ghost-filled person to be driven by or to do minor things influenced to do minor things that he doesn't want to do oh yes everybody say oh yes oh yes you mean a holy ghost-filled person sealed up can can do minor things that he he doesn't want to do oh yeah yes sir y'all Holy Ghost filled person you're right in the place to be droved by these things you just put yourself up a Target right when you were when you're down there serving the devil he just lets you slouch around any old way you want to if you're looking to slouch around if you're looking for an easy life if you're looking for a way of just to relax everybody wants to go Bahamas everybody wants to go somewhere is to relax you ain't going to relax if you're a Christian our peace is on the other side our rest is in that Millennium God promised a millennium that this world knows nothing of the prophet said they're trying to make a millennium without repentance they'll never make it they're trying to come up with World Peace it'll never happen they're trying to bring a piece that they're searching for something it'll never be it belongs to you but it's not until we get on that other side right now you're in the valley of shadow of death when you're down there serving the deli just let you slouch any old way you want to but once you take a stand for Christ you've got on the other side then and he trains every gun right around on you every Temptation everything that could be thrown to you then you got it but what have you got greater is he that is in you I will fear no evil for thou art with me can you say Amen greater is he that's in you than he that is in this world see you wasn't in no battle over there you was just slopping right along but now you've cleaned up you've dressed up you shaved you've calmed your hair you put on a uniform you've got a gun in your hand let's go you're in a battle not to show off but to fight [Music] people make their Ministries about crowds that's not what God calls us for we make it all about you know the the applauds of men that's not what he's called us for he said see you're in a battle not to show off but to fight fight sure when The Temptations rise with the spirit and the shield of Faith Buckle off and move on everybody say move on don't stop move on ain't got time to stop keep moving keep moving he said that's right oh put all the harmor of God why do you put on the armor if you're not going to fight all soldiers are dressed to fight not to show off walk out and say see I'm so and so now I'm a Christian see so who who I am see I belong to so and so Hallelujah I got the Holy Ghost the other night nothing bothers me anymore huh see old brother I believe you better go back and try again right he said oh I'm telling you when as soon as you say you got the Holy Ghost Satan's got every gun right on you shooting you then you got the whole armor on see then take the shield of Faith the sword of the spirit of the word and take uh the Buckle uh uh shod your self with the gospel and take on uh take the old middle piece the breastplate pull it up uh pull up the kinch on it tighten yourself up a little bit and get ready for it cause it's coming what's coming the battle's coming the pressure's coming the testing's coming The Temptations are coming you know I fight you he may fight me or in a different way than he fights you but it's coming that's right see he said but don't you worry yes sir see you're going to have plenty of trouble you want to say that with me hi I will have plenty of trouble yeah I will have plenty of trouble I'm a Christian I will have plenty of trouble I'm the bride of Christ for this day I will have plenty of trouble and if you think any other wise you're lying to yourself I will have plenty of trouble I will have plenty of trouble come on Church you want to wake up tomorrow you're gonna fight face the enemy but don't despair keep walking the paths of righteousness ain't that right it's true you know it's kind of funny there's times you know there's Seasons that we you know you can have seasons of prayer how many just has seasons of Prayer and when you pray you just feel the spirit of God there it's awesome it's in the times then you have them Seasons that prayer becomes a challenge becomes difficult you don't feel God there it's almost as if the prayers yours the words you're saying just hit in the ceiling if it even hits the ceiling but it's in them times that you start questioning now what did I do wrong what do I need to do has the Lord left me you know am I getting anywhere you are getting somewheres right yeah but what is it it's Satan coming to attack that you pray as a soldier you read your Bible as a soldier you come and you worship as a soldier you come and sing songs as a soldier you come and even a man the word as a soldier I didn't feel like coming tonight but I came as a soldier I didn't want to stand here tonight but I stand in here as a soldier I didn't know what to preach but here I am preaching as a soldier didn't you say Amen we get discouraged a lot many times because the devil is on our tail but that shows that there's something you know isn't it I don't know if the prophet said or someone said it the devil ain't bad news because he's already got you if he's fighting you it shows He Ain't Got You Yet ain't that right so you go back to Exodus the 14th chapter the 10th verse and when Pharaoh drew nighth the children of Israel lifted up their eyes and behold the Egyptians marched after them and they were sore afraid see and the children of Israel Cried Out unto the Lord and they said unto Moses because there were no graves in Egypt has thou taken his way to die in the wilderness wherefore hast thou dealt with us uh uh thus with us to carry us forth out of Egypt is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians see people fall apart in the trials they were all rejoicing when they when the enemy wasn't chasing them people get discomforted they get dis you know they get uh disoriented you can't get disoriented when the battle's hot so he says is this not is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians it had been better for us to serve the Egyptian than the way we sh then then that we should die in the wilderness and how many people look back and say it would have been better for us to stay out in the world than to be what we are us miserable riches if you consider being a miserable wretch and doing the will of God something's wrong but we get so used to the battle and we're looking at the Battle we're looking at the enemy and we begin to look back and say that's better than where we're at today you'll never be better back there people look back and say well you know I I never had trouble in denominations I never had this much but here I am I'm miserable I've lost everything I'm going through this battle in this battle in that battle in that battle you know it would have been better would it and here they are looking at the message of the hours and it had been better for us to stay back there but you brought us here but notice what the prophet said about Moses he was exactly in the line of duty leading the children across to the Red Sea and was taken them to the promised land as God had promised he heard from God the Holy Spirit was upon him he led them out done Miracles and signs of God and here they was right in the line of duty and there was every that could be shove it off it seemed as nature would even itself cry out all Moses and Israel I feel sorry for you because Doom just Waits you they were an awful fix but notice as I close 13th verse and Moses said unto the people fear ye not can you say that with me fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show you today for the Egyptians whom you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever the Lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore Christ thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward can you say Amen and the prophet said when the children of Israel was following their commission going straight in the line of duty that red the Red Sea got in the way of the line of duty of the children of Israel going to a promised land and God looked down through the pillar of fire and the Sea got scared and opened up away and they crossed over as on dry land church do you believe God's still with us he's still the same God he is with those who are following in the line of duty God is with you God Is With Us God's with this church if the musicians will come why does the supernatural stay with the people of God because they're in the line of duty and again the line of duty ain't there ain't fulfilling the lust of their flesh they ain't fulfilling what they want to do they're fulfilling the predestinated word of God for their lives and Satan hates it you think of all the people you think of all the churches you think of all all through history Satan's been able to get get every one of them I thought like you sisters you know brother Brown said the sisters a woman has been the main target since History of Time he got eve and he's been getting them in every age brother Brown said he's been getting every woman getting the women in every age but you know what in this age there's a group of sisters that ain't going to bow there's a group of sisters that the devil can't touch there's a group of sisters that is is coming to the completion of God's thoughts and Satan hates it well that's with the people of God you realize he's been able to pervert every Revival and he ain't able to pervert this one the bride Revival it's a word Revival and he hates it and Satan hates it and he's doing everything I mean believe me this if I may not be able to word it right but brother Brown said this is the age we're all hell all hell is emptied out it's here every demon of hell is here on Earth this is the age and you're fighting them you're you're the target but it's already been written you will overcome you will complete it you will finish this race and Satan ain't got no say so because he's the one God is the one that leadeth me in these Paths of righteousness it was ordained for me to walk him it'd been laying in scripture forever but here in this day I'm here to fulfill it you love him Hallelujah one song Greater is he that is in Me Greater is he that is in me [Music] greater is he that is in me oh sing it now greater is that is [Music] in me than he that
