[40:57] let's just bow our
[40:59] heads Lord
[41:01] Jesus we are your people Lord and
[41:06] realizing that we need you more than
[41:10] ever before and our desire is that we
[41:15] would have you more than ever
[41:17] before father as we see the turmoil
[41:21] that's in the world and just such a
[41:25] chaos Lord we're thankful that we could
[41:28] gather here this
[41:29] morning Lord under the protection of
[41:33] your word that you would just um speak
[41:36] to our hearts Lord and bring a comfort
[41:40] remove all fear and frustrations and
[41:44] doubts Lord that father people are
[41:47] looking for answers all around and yet
[41:50] we sit here as blessed people that you
[41:53] have given us the answers Lord and
[41:56] father we don't take it lightly Lord but
[41:58] we we do thank you for sending us a
[42:02] prophet Lord and opening the word father
[42:05] to us and Lord now we just ask that you
[42:09] would just speak to our hearts once
[42:12] again Lord in opening the word to us our
[42:16] understanding is our prayer father if
[42:19] there's any sins that have been
[42:20] committed Lord that is not under the
[42:23] blood we pray that you'd forgive us all
[42:26] father may you be pleased to dwell Among
[42:28] Us here today in Jesus Christ's name and
[42:32] the church says amen amen amen you can
[42:37] be
[42:39] seated and
[42:42] um as we we
[42:47] know um this this life is changing the
[42:51] world is changing everything is just
[42:55] changing
[42:57] history tells us and shows us that
[43:00] change is a very common
[43:03] thing and U if there's anything that we
[43:06] could expect in life and that is our
[43:10] change but the real Christian life is
[43:12] all about change as well and um the
[43:19] Bible speaks of change there right at
[43:22] the beginning when man
[43:24] fell and uh there in Genesis uh
[43:29] 3:15 when God told the serpent I will
[43:32] put enity between thee and uh the woman
[43:36] in between thy seed and her seed and it
[43:38] shall bruise thy head and thou shal
[43:40] bruise his
[43:42] heel and it was at that time that God
[43:44] was promising a deliverer a a
[43:48] redeemer and letting man
[43:51] know that that the condition of man man
[43:56] that man had fallen into would not
[43:59] always be but there would be a
[44:03] change and Prophets have come and have
[44:07] revealed the the kind of change that was
[44:13] to come God has showed it through the
[44:15] scriptures as to what kind of a
[44:18] change
[44:20] um Abraham and Sarah for example being
[44:24] changed from old to young again their
[44:27] condition of
[44:29] impossibility changed to where they
[44:32] could have a
[44:33] son and that's just one of the changes
[44:36] but but job talked about it in job 14:14
[44:41] if a man die shall he live again all the
[44:45] days of my appointed time will I wait
[44:47] till my change come amen Thou shalt call
[44:52] and I will answer thee for thou wil have
[44:56] the desire to the work of thine hands
[44:59] Zechariah 3:3 it talks about it Joshua
[45:03] was clothed with filthy garments and
[45:06] stood before the angel and he answered
[45:09] and spake unto those that stood before
[45:11] him saying take away these filthy
[45:13] garments from him and unto him he said
[45:17] behold I have caused thine iniquity to
[45:20] pass from thee and I will clothe thee
[45:22] with change of reignment
[45:26] Paul talks about change there in
[45:29] Philippians 3 uh 20 for our conversation
[45:33] is in heaven from whence also we look
[45:36] for the Savior and the Lord Jesus Christ
[45:39] who shall change our vow body that it
[45:43] may be fashioned liken to his glorious
[45:46] body according to the working whereby he
[45:48] is able to even even to subdue all
[45:51] things un himself Romans 12:2 and be ye
[45:55] not conf formed to this world but be ye
[45:57] transformed or be changed by the
[46:01] renewing of your mind 2 Corinthians 3:18
[46:05] but we all with open face as in a glass
[46:08] the glory beholding as in the glass the
[46:12] glory of the Lord or a mirror are
[46:15] changed into the same image from glory
[46:18] to glory even as by the spirit of the
[46:21] Lord 1 Corinthians 15:51 behold I show
[46:25] you a mystery we shall not all sleep but
[46:27] we shall all be
[46:29] changed in a moment in twinkling of an
[46:32] eye at the last Trump for the trumpet
[46:34] shall sound and the dead shall be raised
[46:36] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[46:40] for this corruptible must put on
[46:41] incorruption and this Mortal must put on
[46:44] immortality so when this corruptible
[46:47] shall have put on
[46:49] incorruption in other words the change
[46:51] and this Mortal shall have put on
[46:53] immortality then shall be brought to
[46:55] pass say
[46:56] uh the saying that is written death is
[46:58] swallowed up in
[47:00] Victory of course we don't have to wait
[47:02] for that change uh uh to feel the
[47:06] effects of change for the Bible says if
[47:09] any man be in Christ he is a new
[47:12] creation he has changed old things are
[47:15] passed away behold all things are become
[47:19] new the Bible talks of the new Heaven
[47:22] and a new Earth things are changing it's
[47:26] all about change God saved you to change
[47:30] you uh uh and so why why must the change
[47:35] and how how can we be sure of the change
[47:39] is is because the infinite God took a
[47:42] picture of you in your
[47:45] Perfection amen and he he took a picture
[47:48] of what you are were to be to look like
[47:52] uh in your physical
[47:54] stature um and and when you were in your
[47:57] Prime uh think the prophet said around
[48:00] you know 2021 or so he he took a picture
[48:03] of you and and and um you you you may
[48:08] have come into this Earth deformed or
[48:11] sick and so many babies even uh uh have
[48:16] fighting sickness diseases or whatever
[48:19] or you may even get crippled up in Life
[48:22] or or you may even get old uh to where
[48:25] you know you lose your hair or uh you
[48:28] ain't got that um you know that youth
[48:30] anymore or whatever but uh uh but God
[48:35] took a picture amen uh in your Prime and
[48:39] and as we know that this is the negative
[48:43] um uh and and and um and you know I I
[48:47] kind of I brother Wayne had brought up a
[48:50] uh illustration uh the other day uh uh
[48:54] there in Ohio where talking of um about
[48:58] that negative you know and and he he he
[49:00] pointed out a brother and he says see
[49:02] now now you you all can see that brother
[49:05] there sitting there he said but now if
[49:07] I'm going to take a negative of that
[49:10] brother take a picture of that brother
[49:12] and he I put it over here he said well I
[49:14] can change anything I want about that
[49:16] brother I can I can I can design him any
[49:20] and all that but no matter what I do
[49:21] about the negative the positive is still
[49:24] there and and and the positive is
[49:27] greater than than what would the
[49:29] negative would be I can distort it all I
[49:32] want to but I can't distort the positive
[49:36] and so so so Satan can take the negative
[49:40] and and and distort Us in any way but
[49:43] but God has the positive and and that's
[49:47] that's what he's kept is the
[49:49] positive and he can never distort the
[49:52] positive he can't touch that so the
[49:55] Prophet said the picture is the main
[49:57] thing ain't that right the the the
[49:59] picture is the name main thing he says
[50:01] now the negative part of life is where
[50:04] you're living now and anything if if
[50:08] there is a negative then there's got to
[50:10] be a positive before there can be a
[50:12] negative therefore if this is a negative
[50:15] there's got to be a positive somewhere
[50:17] and this everybody say this ain't the
[50:20] real thing the negative isn't the real
[50:23] thing see see uh uh it's only a
[50:27] foreshadow of the real thing that is to
[50:29] come he said now you got it I don't care
[50:32] what they would do with you they cannot
[50:35] destroy that profile that picture in
[50:38] God's Great Gallery up there it cannot
[50:41] destroy it it's in heaven you can burn
[50:44] it up uh uh and he's talking about your
[50:46] your physical uh uh uh uh stature and
[50:50] these things you can burn it up your
[50:52] body feed it to the Lions do any way you
[50:55] want to but it'll come forth again just
[50:58] as sure as 2 two uh two tws is four just
[51:02] as sure God spoke it it'll come forth so
[51:05] no matter where you are ain't that right
[51:07] but not only did God take a picture of
[51:10] your physical stature uh uh there and
[51:13] your physical being and and and not only
[51:15] did he know your height and your hair
[51:17] color the color of your eyes and and uh
[51:21] everything about you but he also had a
[51:24] picture of us as to what we are to be as
[51:28] sons of God and and and as we said so
[51:31] many times he wrote our name on the
[51:33] Lamb's Book of Life and he gave us an
[51:37] expected end and and that expected end
[51:40] is the picture ain't that right that he
[51:42] took of us as sons of God and so Romans
[51:47] 8:28 Paul tells us what this picture is
[51:50] and we've read it but we know all things
[51:53] work together for good to them that love
[51:55] God to them who are called according to
[51:57] his purpose for whom he did for know he
[52:00] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[52:03] image of his son he took that picture
[52:05] right amen and that he might be the
[52:08] firstborn among many Brethren and whom
[52:10] he did predestinate them he also called
[52:12] and whom he called he also Justified and
[52:15] whom he justified he also glorified and
[52:18] so what shall we say to these things if
[52:20] God before us who can be against us so
[52:23] so we we see the expected end the
[52:26] picture Ephesians 1 and4 according as he
[52:29] has chosen Us in him before the
[52:31] foundation of the world that we should
[52:32] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[52:35] love the picture right amen see and
[52:38] having predestinated us unto the
[52:40] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[52:42] himself according to the good pleasure
[52:44] of his will amen uh second Peter 3:14
[52:48] wherefore beloved seeing that we you
[52:51] look for such things be diligent that
[52:54] you may be found of him in peace without
[52:57] spot and blemish or blameless ain't that
[53:01] right so that's his picture that's his
[53:04] vision of what we are to be amen
[53:08] Ephesians 5:25 husbands love your wives
[53:11] even as Christ also loved the church and
[53:14] gave himself for it that he might
[53:16] sanctify it cleanse it with the washing
[53:18] of Water by the word that he might
[53:21] present it to himself a glorious picture
[53:25] a glorious Church ain't that right not
[53:28] having spot or wrinkle or any such thing
[53:31] that it should be holy and without
[53:35] blemish so so the the the Bible actually
[53:39] has amen God's wrote down the the
[53:43] description of the picture that he has
[53:46] for you and I as as Believers ain't that
[53:49] right you you you may not know and and
[53:53] and I may have not known what God 's
[53:55] purpose was but it was in in in this
[53:58] time that we began to understand that
[54:00] God took a picture of us uh before the
[54:03] foundation of the world and he's able to
[54:05] bring us back to what he had the picture
[54:07] that he has taken in his mind so the
[54:11] vision uh uh picture the vision is what
[54:14] God had in the beginning you see way
[54:17] back before this world started in them
[54:20] Adams back Yonder when God seen what was
[54:24] going to take place right there he saw
[54:28] you and he saw me he saw every flea
[54:33] every frog every net everything that
[54:35] would be upon the Earth he saw it right
[54:38] then see another place God before the
[54:41] foundation of the world saw you you
[54:44] wasn't there but you was in his mind he
[54:49] saw it ain't that right so this is not
[54:52] an imagination th this is in just is
[54:55] something that God was just trying to he
[54:57] literally saw us there and and what he
[55:02] saw us as a man is is forever remaining
[55:06] the same I mean it's that the picture is
[55:09] what matters the picture is what counts
[55:13] amen so before the foundation of the
[55:15] world our names when the lamb was slain
[55:18] our names were put on the book when in
[55:21] God's own mind he foresaw us and pred
[55:25] destinated Us by his for knowledge
[55:27] before the foundation of the world as we
[55:30] know we didn't come into this world
[55:32] reflecting that Vision that God saw of
[55:35] us and and what he predestinated us to
[55:38] be look at all of our hangups and look
[55:41] at all of our failures and look at all
[55:43] the scars that we have and look what a
[55:46] Satan was able to do to us not only in
[55:49] our physical uh uh uh body but but
[55:53] spiritually and mentally and and we we
[55:56] we were a basket case I know I was and
[55:59] and uh a basket case and look at the
[56:03] complexes uh that he has been able to
[56:06] put Upon Us amen so to try to hinder our
[56:10] walk in God and and and and and and you
[56:14] know we we had so much baggage on us
[56:17] when we become a Christian and uh uh uh
[56:21] to deal with and and and a lot of us are
[56:23] still dealing with the baggage you know
[56:25] a lot of the baggage that that that came
[56:27] with just being humans and a fallen
[56:30] nature and and all of these things but
[56:33] as Paul said thanks be to God who give
[56:37] us the victory through our Lord Jesus
[56:40] Christ ain't that right so there is a
[56:43] victory there is a victory amen and and
[56:47] and you know the prophet said God will
[56:49] not be defeated no matter what takes
[56:52] place amen he will not be and he will
[56:55] never be defeated ain't that right amen
[56:59] Jesus even said uh the heavens and earth
[57:02] will pass away but my word will never
[57:05] pass away and we know what his word is
[57:08] it's the vision that he had before the
[57:11] foundation of the world and so the word
[57:15] is eternal and uh the Earth that we're
[57:17] setting on today uh uh um uh is is the
[57:22] manifestation of God's word the world
[57:25] was framed together by the word of God
[57:29] and and it's it's by things that do not
[57:32] appear uh uh there was nothing that God
[57:35] could use to uh as we would uh we took
[57:39] things to invent things amen but it were
[57:42] already here but God would take nothing
[57:44] and there was nothing there and yet the
[57:47] worlds are framed amen and so God just
[57:50] said let there be and there was and so
[57:53] the prophet said how how easy it is for
[57:56] that God could uh to heal a sick body
[57:59] then if he can build a creation by just
[58:01] speaking it his word if we could only
[58:05] get Faith to see what his word is amen
[58:09] and I that's why Satan is so trying so
[58:12] hard to discourage us from the word of
[58:15] God Amen is because the word of God has
[58:19] so much power in it amen to bring forth
[58:24] the change ain't that right we are so
[58:26] Earthbound and our minds uh we're just
[58:29] so uh uh conglomerated uh in our minds
[58:33] and things and brother brandom said
[58:35] we've had so many
[58:37] indoc a shot from this one and a shot
[58:40] from that one and it's just got us to a
[58:44] place she's just all twisted up but if
[58:48] you could ever shake the whole thing
[58:50] loose and come back to know what that he
[58:53] is God and his word can no more fail
[58:56] than he can fail ain't that right amen
[58:59] so so it it causes people being so
[59:02] indument with doctrines and ideas of men
[59:06] and and and the world that is around it
[59:09] literally causes Faith to become slow to
[59:13] where people can't just take God at his
[59:16] word but but the word of God is still
[59:19] powerful today as it has always been
[59:23] ain't that right and and and and and God
[59:26] doesn't ask us to change ourselves amen
[59:29] amen he only asks us to believe to
[59:34] believe and we're not believing a myth
[59:37] we're not believing a man uh uh with
[59:40] blind faith God has so Vindicated his
[59:44] word today and showed us that he is the
[59:47] same yesterday today and forever and he
[59:50] showed us that the power that created
[59:53] the worlds out there was the the same
[59:55] power that created squirrels that that
[59:57] that that that uh uh uh uh brought that
[1:00:00] fish back to life and all of these
[1:00:02] things to where we could just simply be
[1:00:05] at rest and
[1:00:07] believe ain't that right amen and so um
[1:00:11] you know brother Bram says you know it
[1:00:13] says brother a long time ago before the
[1:00:15] found before the world was ever had a
[1:00:17] foundation God through his eternal Grace
[1:00:20] looked down and by for knowledge he seen
[1:00:22] you and I he knew what age we'd live in
[1:00:25] and he knew what we would be therefore
[1:00:28] by election he chose us before the
[1:00:31] foundation of the world to be with him
[1:00:34] without spot now that word is going to
[1:00:37] happen without spot it's happening right
[1:00:39] now do you believe that amen a people
[1:00:42] that that that Satan was able to distort
[1:00:45] and and change the picture and all of
[1:00:48] that but God Amen the picture has
[1:00:50] forever uh stayed with God in his mind
[1:00:54] and so so something has got to change us
[1:00:57] from being spotted to being spotless a
[1:01:01] ain't that right and and we know that
[1:01:03] God himself provided the remedy and that
[1:01:06] is John 3:16 for God so loved the world
[1:01:09] that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:01:12] who should ever uh believeth in him
[1:01:15] should not perish and but have
[1:01:17] everlasting life ain't that right so so
[1:01:20] through the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:01:23] amen God has has been able to change
[1:01:26] amen uh us from being spotted to
[1:01:29] spotless uh uh uh with changes from from
[1:01:33] being blemished Amen to without blemish
[1:01:36] amen of Hebrews 9:13 if the blood of
[1:01:39] bulls and goats and the ashes of an
[1:01:42] hepher sprinkling the unclean sanctify
[1:01:45] the puring of the uh uh purifying of the
[1:01:48] flesh how much more shall the blood of
[1:01:51] Christ who through the eternal spirit
[1:01:54] off offer himself without spot to God
[1:01:56] Purge you purge you see Purge your
[1:02:00] conscience from dead Works to serve the
[1:02:03] Living God ain't that right so the
[1:02:06] prophet would say when Jesus come
[1:02:08] dealing with sin at Calvary he killed
[1:02:11] sin and he killed every attribute that
[1:02:15] goes with it and completely everybody
[1:02:18] say completely completely redeemed us
[1:02:22] back to God and to we are Sons and
[1:02:25] Daughters of God perfectly Redeemed by A
[1:02:29] Perfect Redeemer the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:33] ain't that right amen now you say well
[1:02:35] I'm still got sickness well you know the
[1:02:37] problem that we don't have it in full
[1:02:39] amen but we're being changed it's it's a
[1:02:42] change it's a progress but but one thing
[1:02:45] we do have we have the earnest we have
[1:02:48] the earnest of our of our Salvation so
[1:02:52] the prophet said we are not p Temptation
[1:02:55] neither are we above sin but Jesus will
[1:02:59] help us in every Temptation now when I
[1:03:02] do wrong I'm ready to repent and anyone
[1:03:05] else that wants to live right with God
[1:03:07] see amen he says you you uh you don't
[1:03:10] desire to do wrong but when Satan upsets
[1:03:13] you somewhere because there is an
[1:03:14] atonement that is waiting for me if I
[1:03:18] confess my wrongs God is just to forgive
[1:03:21] it can you say Amen so it's not about us
[1:03:24] trying to be a Christian God's provided
[1:03:27] it amen the God has already provided a
[1:03:29] way for the change to happen amen you
[1:03:32] don't have to worry about we just have
[1:03:34] to rest in him knowing that God has
[1:03:36] already made a way for the change can
[1:03:39] you say amen amen think of it now the 2
[1:03:43] Corinthians
[1:03:44] 5:19 uh uh break it in God was in Christ
[1:03:47] reconciling the world unto himself not
[1:03:51] imputing their trans presses uh trans uh
[1:03:55] trespasses unto them ain't that right
[1:03:58] brother brah says a real Christian
[1:04:00] doesn't have any sins imputed to him at
[1:04:03] all see he says when you're washed in
[1:04:06] the blood of the Lamb not by make belief
[1:04:09] but really the blood of the Lamb God
[1:04:12] does not impute to you anything that's
[1:04:15] done because you're under the blood and
[1:04:18] he does not see it Lord amen see he had
[1:04:22] to do that in order to bring a change in
[1:04:25] your life amen see there's a blood
[1:04:28] sacrifice the only thing he can see uh
[1:04:31] uh the only thing he can see you in is
[1:04:33] the way he saw you before the foundation
[1:04:38] of the world when he put your name in
[1:04:40] the Lamb's Book of Life well how did he
[1:04:42] see you blameless
[1:04:44] spotless can you say amen that's the way
[1:04:48] he done it see and now that he provided
[1:04:50] a remedy that's the only way he can see
[1:04:53] you is without spot wrinkle or
[1:04:57] blemish ain't that right see and and so
[1:05:00] he says because you are redeemed from
[1:05:02] everything that was ever done you're
[1:05:04] washed in the lamb the blood of the Lamb
[1:05:07] therefore there's no gal in you there's
[1:05:09] no unclean Habit in you because that the
[1:05:12] blood of the Lamb has did this and God
[1:05:15] cannot impute sin to you after you've
[1:05:17] got a sin offering laying there waiting
[1:05:20] for you he says well you say that gives
[1:05:23] me plenty of room brother brandom I can
[1:05:25] do what I want to he says I always do
[1:05:27] always but when a man can really see
[1:05:31] what Jesus done for him and turn around
[1:05:33] and do something contrary to him it
[1:05:35] shows he never received Christ can you
[1:05:37] say amen amen Ephesians 2 and8 amen Paul
[1:05:41] would tell us for it by grace are you
[1:05:44] saved through faith and that not of
[1:05:46] yourselves it is a gift of God ain't
[1:05:50] that right amen so then we we uh Brother
[1:05:54] Brad would tell us we come to him or we
[1:05:57] come in him by by faith through Grace we
[1:06:01] are saved by the Holy Spirit calling to
[1:06:05] us amen see he's already redeemed us
[1:06:08] he's already provided the sacrifice he's
[1:06:10] already provided a way to to to to wipe
[1:06:13] your slate clean ain't that right amen
[1:06:17] but now he's coming to call us calling
[1:06:20] to woo us amen aren't you glad for that
[1:06:23] wooing
[1:06:24] amen see so so we we find that he come
[1:06:28] to redeem that predestinated that people
[1:06:31] that he saw before the foundation of the
[1:06:33] world it isn't just a random thing it's
[1:06:36] not just that he died and now he's
[1:06:38] disappointed because of the millions and
[1:06:40] the millions have rejected him amen no
[1:06:43] he foresaw a people and now he's wooing
[1:06:48] that people amen he's wooing that people
[1:06:52] to himself amen so he says seek God
[1:06:54] through Eternal Grace seen who would be
[1:06:56] saved and he called you no man can come
[1:07:00] to me except my father calls him first
[1:07:02] not him that willth or him that
[1:07:05] runthe Mercy you say well I sought God I
[1:07:08] sought God he said no you never did God
[1:07:11] sought you and that's the way it it was
[1:07:13] in the beginning it wasn't Adam saying
[1:07:16] oh Father father I've sinned where are
[1:07:18] you it was father saying oh Adam Adam
[1:07:20] where are you see that's the nature of
[1:07:23] man is to hide that's the strain see
[1:07:26] that's what he's made of amen that's
[1:07:28] right but it's the only way we could
[1:07:30] come is God pulling God calling God
[1:07:36] bringing us unto himself aren't you glad
[1:07:39] for that amen see we we the the the work
[1:07:42] of redemption is so great it's a mystery
[1:07:46] and it's so great that we can't even
[1:07:48] fathom with our men with our minds our
[1:07:52] understanding uh can't even be begin to
[1:07:54] grasp amen what God has really done for
[1:07:57] us but all we know is we feel the pull
[1:08:01] all all we know is that there's
[1:08:03] something that is pulling us amen and
[1:08:07] it's causing a change aren't you glad
[1:08:09] for that see it's in this day amen that
[1:08:13] God promised to call out a people amen
[1:08:16] for his name out of the Gentile calling
[1:08:19] people out of the Gentile for for his
[1:08:21] name and that group of people is to
[1:08:24] manifest every promise amen and manifest
[1:08:28] his eternal purpose God saw a bride God
[1:08:32] saw the manifestation of sons and
[1:08:34] daughters God saw amen a a a people and
[1:08:39] and uh that would be conformed into the
[1:08:42] image of his son and he predestinated
[1:08:45] them to be conformed ain't that right
[1:08:48] amen and what is the image of his son
[1:08:51] well the the Bible says he's the image
[1:08:53] of God he's the expressed image Amen
[1:08:56] brother BR called it the expressed image
[1:08:58] of God ain't that right in other words
[1:09:01] what what this image was is what Jehovah
[1:09:03] was Jesus was amen he was the expressed
[1:09:07] image of him he was God shaped out in
[1:09:11] human form see and all the powers of God
[1:09:16] formed into and put in a human body
[1:09:20] that's the image of God ain't that right
[1:09:22] amen and God would predestinate a people
[1:09:26] to be transformed into that same image
[1:09:30] and that's the same that's the image
[1:09:32] that sons of God Amen are being changed
[1:09:35] into today the bride of Christ ain't
[1:09:38] that right Matthew 25 it it talks about
[1:09:42] the 10 virgins amen the five wise and
[1:09:45] five foolish and yet we we know that
[1:09:48] they're all they're all virgins amen and
[1:09:52] and showing that they all come from the
[1:09:54] same pattern uh uh or material amen but
[1:09:59] but we know as the prophet described it
[1:10:01] the the wise virgin is being cut out
[1:10:05] amen all that material laying there and
[1:10:08] he Likens it to a woman that a
[1:10:10] seamstress or whatever but she's wanting
[1:10:12] to make a dress or uh after wanting to
[1:10:15] make something and so she she goes and
[1:10:18] gets the material and there's a lot of
[1:10:19] material that is there amen but but she
[1:10:22] ain't going to use all that material
[1:10:24] right away uh uh uh she wants to make a
[1:10:27] a a dress so she takes a part of that
[1:10:29] material and and in order to do that
[1:10:32] I've seen my mom do it uh uh many times
[1:10:34] and and that is to lay a pattern She
[1:10:36] lays a pattern out in that material and
[1:10:39] and you know any way she wants to lay it
[1:10:42] that's her prerogative amen she she
[1:10:45] whatever she wants to do with that
[1:10:46] material see amen and and so uh uh she
[1:10:50] begins to cut amen that that that piece
[1:10:54] of material out to fit the pattern a
[1:10:57] ain't that right amen and and so she's
[1:11:00] got an idea of what she wants and so she
[1:11:02] begins to cut it well the prophet said
[1:11:04] that's the way it is amen see uh uh
[1:11:07] brother Brown said what is the pattern
[1:11:09] it's the place that the lady elected to
[1:11:12] cut it from that's the pattern ain't
[1:11:15] that right and and so so she she cuts
[1:11:18] this pattern out and she puts the rest
[1:11:21] of the material lays it aside for
[1:11:23] another day another time but now she's
[1:11:26] going to work on that that material to
[1:11:28] make what she's after ain't that right
[1:11:30] so the prophet said seek God before the
[1:11:32] foundation of the world he knew the end
[1:11:35] from the beginning by for knowledge he
[1:11:38] elected where to cut aren't you glad he
[1:11:41] elected you Hallelujah he elected the
[1:11:44] place the the on the material of where
[1:11:47] to cut for his pattern see he know the
[1:11:50] difference between Esau and Jacob he
[1:11:53] know the the difference between Sinner
[1:11:54] and Saint he know the difference he
[1:11:57] knows the motive of every heart so he
[1:11:59] elected us before the foundation of the
[1:12:01] world and put our names on the Lamb's
[1:12:03] Book of Life and also the lamb that was
[1:12:06] to be slain put our names on before he
[1:12:09] was slain and the Bible says that Christ
[1:12:11] was slain was the lamb slain before the
[1:12:14] foundation of the world and our names
[1:12:15] were put on the book when he was elected
[1:12:18] back there to be the lamb to be slain we
[1:12:21] were elected to be the one that was he
[1:12:24] was slain for can you say Amen see God
[1:12:28] knew oh if we could understand that I
[1:12:32] think it would make us happy Amen to
[1:12:34] know that God precisely when he ordained
[1:12:39] that lamb to be slain he had you
[1:12:43] specifically in mind and he that blood
[1:12:46] would speak fre all your life that blood
[1:12:49] would speak for you all of your life the
[1:12:52] whole journey of your living here on
[1:12:54] this Earth that blood would speak for
[1:12:56] you brother Bill amen why because you
[1:12:59] were the one elected for that lamb to be
[1:13:02] slain for could you imagine to be
[1:13:05] walking through life and the blood not
[1:13:06] speaking for you in your behalf amen now
[1:13:09] we're not any better than anybody else
[1:13:11] we've had our faults we've got our
[1:13:13] failures we've got our you know we've
[1:13:15] got our hangups we've got our complexes
[1:13:17] we've got all kinds of things amen that
[1:13:20] we deal with every day of our life and
[1:13:23] you can't even say that we've got even
[1:13:25] unbelief that we have dealt with and and
[1:13:27] and wondering and questioning and and
[1:13:30] all of these things of wondering how and
[1:13:33] wondering where and wondering when oh
[1:13:35] God do you love me oh God is you know am
[1:13:37] I really going to make it how many's
[1:13:40] ever done that before amen well we we've
[1:13:43] have them but the difference is is the
[1:13:45] blood is speaking for you amen the blood
[1:13:50] is speaking he knew where to lay the
[1:13:52] pattern Amen on that material and you've
[1:13:55] been included into that amen see and so
[1:13:59] we were elected to be the one that he
[1:14:03] was slain for see and so so we find that
[1:14:07] it's all the same material amen but one
[1:14:11] is cut according to the pattern and the
[1:14:14] other is the remnant of what is left
[1:14:16] over can you say Amen so see God by
[1:14:19] election chose his bride before the
[1:14:21] foundation of the world and he brother
[1:14:23] brandom identified the bride as being
[1:14:27] that wise
[1:14:28] virgin don't let anyone tell you that
[1:14:31] the the wise virgin ain't the bride amen
[1:14:34] that's contrary to what brother brandham
[1:14:35] taught can you say Amen the he
[1:14:38] identified the bride as being the wise
[1:14:40] virgin and the remnant is left amen is
[1:14:44] is the foolish virgin ain't that right
[1:14:47] so so this is what God is doing amen is
[1:14:50] is you say Well they're good people that
[1:14:52] that's not the point
[1:14:55] well well you know their church goers
[1:14:57] they really love God that's not the
[1:14:58] point the point is is God predestinated
[1:15:01] you for a reason amen and that's why the
[1:15:05] change is
[1:15:08] happening can you say amen amen yeah I
[1:15:11] believe that anyways and any True
[1:15:14] Believer knows that the wise virgin is
[1:15:16] the bride of Christ see so as God
[1:15:19] brought a nation out of a nation in
[1:15:22] Egypt he is bringing a church out of a
[1:15:24] church or a bride out of a church church
[1:15:26] out of church amen what the prophet said
[1:15:28] see amen and that's that wise virgin
[1:15:31] amen that he's working on today amen
[1:15:35] Revelations 9 197 let us be glad and
[1:15:39] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[1:15:41] marriage of the Lamb has come and his
[1:15:43] wife everybody say his wife hath made
[1:15:46] herself ready amen ain't that right
[1:15:48] she's made herself ready what's happened
[1:15:50] there's been a
[1:15:51] change something have changed you you
[1:15:54] you can't tell me that this bride's
[1:15:56] going to be halfway uh uh there amen
[1:15:59] halfway ready when the Rapture comes it
[1:16:01] ain't going to happen she's made herself
[1:16:03] ready she's endeavored she's endured
[1:16:06] there was a blood speaking on her behalf
[1:16:09] ain't that right she didn't make Grace a
[1:16:11] disgrace that's
[1:16:13] right amen that's right she made herself
[1:16:16] ready and to her was granted that she
[1:16:19] should be arrayed in fine linen clean
[1:16:21] and white for the fine linen is the
[1:16:23] righteousness of the Saints well that
[1:16:25] tells us that your end is better than
[1:16:27] your
[1:16:30] beginning amen so that's the wise virgin
[1:16:34] who kept oil in her lamp Amen brother
[1:16:37] Brown said see it's all virgin now
[1:16:39] here's the little Remnant not throw it
[1:16:41] away no no she keeps it but lays it back
[1:16:44] she can use it for something else but
[1:16:46] it's not going to be used there that's
[1:16:48] the church that's cut
[1:16:50] out ain't that right am man the the the
[1:16:53] remnant man is going to have to stand
[1:16:55] judgment see because they go through the
[1:16:59] tribulation that is the remnant but
[1:17:01] thank God that God elected you not to go
[1:17:04] through that
[1:17:05] tribulation God elected you not to stand
[1:17:08] before the white thrown
[1:17:11] judgment think of that church not
[1:17:14] anything that you had to do it was God
[1:17:17] by Grace elected
[1:17:22] you
[1:17:23] it's a
[1:17:25] change now Revelations 12:17 tells us
[1:17:29] says and the dragon was wroth with a
[1:17:31] woman and went to make war with the
[1:17:33] remnant of her seed which keeps the
[1:17:35] Commandments of God and have the
[1:17:37] testimony of Jesus Christ see brother
[1:17:40] Brown said see the remnant of the
[1:17:41] woman's seed that's what was left over
[1:17:44] ain't that right and there is weeping
[1:17:47] and Howling and nashing of teeth cuz
[1:17:49] they didn't have oil in their lamps the
[1:17:52] Holy Spirit see and there they are
[1:17:53] they're the ones that's going through
[1:17:54] the
[1:17:55] tribulation amen they're the ones ain't
[1:17:58] that right amen see why because she
[1:18:00] didn't have the atonement in its
[1:18:03] fullness amen virgin yes Church going
[1:18:06] yes you know in her own way having an
[1:18:09] understanding in her own way of of
[1:18:11] scriptures and standing true to what she
[1:18:13] knew ain't that right that God has
[1:18:16] opened your eyes of understanding God
[1:18:19] has enlightened you can you say Amen
[1:18:22] that you would to sit in the church and
[1:18:24] believe halfway truth wondering what's
[1:18:26] truth but you could stand there with
[1:18:29] thus said the Lord and believe all the
[1:18:31] truth and the washing of the water of
[1:18:34] the word is washing you from all of your
[1:18:36] sins and it's bringing a change the word
[1:18:41] is bringing a
[1:18:43] change amen
[1:18:46] amen the bride doesn't have to stand at
[1:18:48] the white Throne judgment the Lord the
[1:18:50] bride doesn't have to go through
[1:18:52] tribulation amen cuz she's redeemed
[1:18:55] brother BR said she's already pure the
[1:18:58] Holy Spirit has come into her and
[1:19:00] purified her and took all away all the
[1:19:03] filth and gum of the world and she
[1:19:05] believes that word and becomes part of
[1:19:08] iten aren't you glad for
[1:19:11] that now the scripture we all know is
[1:19:14] Malachi 4:5 behold I will send you
[1:19:16] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[1:19:18] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[1:19:20] which we know it to be this day and he
[1:19:23] the spirit of Elijah the Holy
[1:19:26] Spirit Will shall turn the the heart of
[1:19:29] the fathers to the children which was
[1:19:32] the ministry that John the Baptist had
[1:19:35] amen ain't that right the spirit of
[1:19:37] Elijah the Holy Spirit came upon John
[1:19:40] that's right uh Luke 1:13 but the angel
[1:19:42] said unto him fear not Zachariah John's
[1:19:45] father for thy prayer is heard and thy
[1:19:48] wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son and
[1:19:50] thou shalt call his name John and go
[1:19:53] into the 17th verse and he shall go
[1:19:55] before him in the spirit and power of
[1:19:57] Elias to turn the hearts of the father
[1:20:00] to the children fathers to the children
[1:20:02] ain't that right Amen in Matthew 11:11
[1:20:05] Jesus said verily I say unto you among
[1:20:08] them that are born of women there hath
[1:20:10] not risen a greater than John the
[1:20:12] Baptist notwithstanding he that is least
[1:20:14] in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than
[1:20:16] he and from the days of John the Baptist
[1:20:19] until now the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:20:21] suffereth violence and the violent take
[1:20:23] it by force for all the prophets and the
[1:20:26] law prophesied until John and if you
[1:20:29] will receive it this is
[1:20:31] Elias which was for to come ain't that
[1:20:34] right so so we we see that that John the
[1:20:37] Baptist is was the Elias there that was
[1:20:40] to turn amen the hearts of the fathers
[1:20:43] to the children amen that that the the
[1:20:47] law uh that those that kept that law and
[1:20:50] and traditions to turn them to to the
[1:20:52] children hearts of the children the
[1:20:55] faith to where they could accept
[1:20:57] Christ amen in Matthew 1710 the
[1:21:01] disciples asked of Jesus why why does
[1:21:04] the scrib say that Elias must first come
[1:21:08] and then you go in the 12th verse Jesus
[1:21:10] said I say unto you that Elias is come
[1:21:14] already and they knew him not but have
[1:21:16] done unto him whatsoever they listed
[1:21:18] ain't that right 13th verse the
[1:21:20] disciples understood that he spake of
[1:21:22] John the Baptist ain't that right but
[1:21:25] then in that 11th verse Jesus sayth unto
[1:21:28] him Elias truly shall come and restore
[1:21:32] all things well then then John the
[1:21:35] Baptist did not restore all things but
[1:21:38] this Elias that is to come he shall
[1:21:41] restore all things restore all things
[1:21:44] all things are going to
[1:21:46] change amen that's a oh my and to think
[1:21:50] of that what a greater what a greater
[1:21:53] Ministry you sit under today than to sit
[1:21:56] under John the
[1:21:57] Baptist and to be introduced to Jesus in
[1:22:00] his physical form uh uh it's greater to
[1:22:03] set under this ministry Amen to be
[1:22:06] introduced in to Jesus in a bride form
[1:22:10] Christ in
[1:22:12] you amen Christ in you can you say
[1:22:16] amen amen and so and and and now this
[1:22:21] Elias that is to come to this Prophet
[1:22:24] amen he's going to restore the last part
[1:22:27] or fulfill the last part of Malachi 4
[1:22:29] and he shall turn the heart of the
[1:22:30] children to their fathers the apostolic
[1:22:33] fathers lest I come and smite the Earth
[1:22:36] with a curse ain't that right so th this
[1:22:39] is the prophet that God promised to sin
[1:22:41] before the great and Dreadful day of the
[1:22:43] Lord and it's this day and as we said
[1:22:45] brother Bram said he shall change
[1:22:48] everybody say change the thoughts of the
[1:22:51] people
[1:22:53] he shall change the thoughts of the
[1:22:56] people praise the Lord we've got an idea
[1:22:59] of the blood of Jesus Christ that has
[1:23:00] been taught us through Traditions yeah
[1:23:04] it's a blood that is So Weak and
[1:23:05] Powerless and helpless and the churches
[1:23:08] have become powerless and weak and can
[1:23:10] you say amen amen but this Prophet would
[1:23:13] come and change our thoughts change our
[1:23:17] thinking amen amen change your thinking
[1:23:23] amen yes sir We've Come to an idea of
[1:23:25] what church ought to be what Christian
[1:23:27] ought to be and what religious ought to
[1:23:28] be and it it's so messed up than what
[1:23:31] God has for his the picture that God
[1:23:33] took of
[1:23:34] us church instead of becoming conformed
[1:23:37] to the image of Christ come be formed to
[1:23:40] the image of the
[1:23:42] world
[1:23:43] religion can you say Amen but this
[1:23:47] Prophet this Prophet would come and have
[1:23:49] the vision of God he would have the
[1:23:52] vision of God and know what God is
[1:23:54] looking for and as I said you know
[1:23:57] before the Bible says it amen the
[1:23:59] prophet says it uh that God has always
[1:24:02] used the prophets to to chop his people
[1:24:04] out ain't that right chop his people out
[1:24:08] to think of that pattern being cut today
[1:24:11] chopping the people out amen and why
[1:24:15] because the word comes to the prophet
[1:24:17] and and Hebrews 4 and12 it it says the
[1:24:20] word of God is quick and powerful and
[1:24:24] sharper than any two-edged forward
[1:24:27] piercing even to the dividing of of Soul
[1:24:31] and Spirit and of the joints in Mara and
[1:24:34] is a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:24:35] intents of the heart can you say Amen so
[1:24:39] the prophet is the voice of God for he
[1:24:41] has thus saith the
[1:24:45] Lord he has the mind of God and he
[1:24:48] reveals it to his people the people of
[1:24:52] God that wise virgin who has the spirit
[1:24:54] of God now God has promised to speak in
[1:24:57] this last day again amen and we've read
[1:25:01] these quotes but read it again the
[1:25:03] coming of a prophet was the sign that
[1:25:05] God is ready to speak because if God
[1:25:08] ain't going to speak the prophet
[1:25:10] wouldn't be on earth ain't that right
[1:25:13] amen you see this ministry that is
[1:25:16] today is is is can happen because of the
[1:25:21] blood right yes being shed and you say
[1:25:26] Amen because this isn't just your
[1:25:28] average Ministry amen this isn't just a
[1:25:30] theologian coming and changing our our
[1:25:33] our minds from one thought to another
[1:25:35] thought from the Baptist thought to the
[1:25:38] Methodist thought or from the Methodist
[1:25:40] to the Pentecostal thought and this
[1:25:42] isn't about reformation can you say man
[1:25:45] this is a changing that's going to a
[1:25:47] Ministry that will change the people
[1:25:49] change them to where they're different
[1:25:51] different
[1:25:53] different from churchianity different
[1:25:55] from Religion
[1:25:57] different it it's a Ministry that makes
[1:26:00] us odd but it's a Ministry that prepares
[1:26:03] us for a
[1:26:06] Rapture and you say Amen so if God ain't
[1:26:10] going to speak a prophet wouldn't be on
[1:26:11] earth he said remember that he wouldn't
[1:26:13] be on earth unless God was ready to
[1:26:15] speak and that's the way he speaks is
[1:26:17] through those channels the unchanging
[1:26:20] God never did do it any other way
[1:26:23] this is always God's way of making his
[1:26:25] voice known to his people he sends his
[1:26:27] prophet and gives a sign and then takes
[1:26:29] his voice that's been spoken before on
[1:26:32] his word and vindicates it by this man
[1:26:35] and they know that it's his voice
[1:26:36] because it's the promised word of this
[1:26:39] day ain't that right so then this this
[1:26:43] scripture is is is is uh fulfillment of
[1:26:47] the message of the hour and and we've
[1:26:50] read it Hebrews 12:25 see that you
[1:26:53] refuse him not that
[1:26:55] speaketh amen don't don't don't separate
[1:26:58] the voice from the
[1:27:00] messenger because the prophet says the
[1:27:02] messenger and his message is
[1:27:04] one see that you refuse him not that
[1:27:07] speaketh for if they escape not who
[1:27:09] refused him that spake on Earth how much
[1:27:12] more shall we not Escape if we turn away
[1:27:15] from him that speaketh from Heaven see
[1:27:18] whose voice then shook the Earth so what
[1:27:21] we have been hearing uh on uh the the
[1:27:25] prophets it's not it's not an Earthly
[1:27:28] voice it it's the voice of God it's it's
[1:27:31] a Heavenly Voice Hallelujah can you say
[1:27:34] Amen Lord so he said see whose voice
[1:27:38] then shook the Earth but now he has
[1:27:40] promised saying yet once more if I shake
[1:27:43] not the Earth only but also the
[1:27:46] heaven and this word yet once more
[1:27:49] signifieth the remove everybody say the
[1:27:53] removing how can he restore all things
[1:27:58] without there be a
[1:28:01] removing and you say Amen of those
[1:28:03] things that are shaken see as of things
[1:28:06] that are made that those things which
[1:28:09] cannot be shaken May remain those things
[1:28:12] that cannot be shaken are the Eternal
[1:28:16] things can you say Amen things that the
[1:28:19] devil put on you has got to be shaken am
[1:28:22] amen
[1:28:24] amen wherefore we receive a kingdom
[1:28:26] which cannot be moved let us have Grace
[1:28:29] whereby we may serve God acceptably with
[1:28:31] reverence and godly Fear Can you say
[1:28:33] amen amen in this day what a change that
[1:28:37] has taken place a people that is no
[1:28:40] longer serving God by their own
[1:28:43] intellect a people that is now move been
[1:28:46] able to change from Human Faith to a
[1:28:49] perfect Faith Godly faith
[1:28:52] a people that is that has been moved and
[1:28:55] redirected from Human element Amen to
[1:28:58] Supernatural element there's been a
[1:29:01] change can you say Amen see it's the
[1:29:04] voice is what is bringing a
[1:29:08] transformation oh
[1:29:10] my this this message is the
[1:29:13] key to getting us back to the picture
[1:29:16] that God thought of
[1:29:19] us can you say amen that's why you ain't
[1:29:22] going home you ain't going to heaven you
[1:29:23] ain't going in the Rapture you ain't
[1:29:25] having a changing of your body without
[1:29:27] this message there's got to be something
[1:29:30] that
[1:29:32] changes they ain't going to be sitting
[1:29:34] us just sitting there watching
[1:29:36] television then all of a sudden Rapture
[1:29:38] takes place that ain't happening us so
[1:29:41] wrapped up in the politics and all the
[1:29:43] the the corruption of the world and then
[1:29:45] all of a sudden Rapture takes
[1:29:47] place that ain't going to happen it
[1:29:49] ain't going to be a bunch of people
[1:29:51] swearing and cussing and and and and
[1:29:54] drinking and looking at all this
[1:29:56] pornography and and just indulging
[1:29:58] themselves in the world that ain't going
[1:30:01] to
[1:30:02] happen
[1:30:05] amen that which can be shaken will be
[1:30:08] removed done away with
[1:30:12] annihilated and you say amen and that
[1:30:15] which cannot be shaken shall remain I
[1:30:19] understand we're creatures of habit
[1:30:21] we're preaches a
[1:30:23] routine you get it in in doing it so
[1:30:25] long long enough you think that's just
[1:30:28] Norm it's not norm and that's why this
[1:30:31] message is so
[1:30:33] different because it's not according to
[1:30:36] the
[1:30:37] norm it's not according to the routine
[1:30:40] of
[1:30:41] man hello it's not according to the same
[1:30:45] old school of thought there had to be a
[1:30:48] message that would be totally different
[1:30:52] amen and it's not different according to
[1:30:54] what God thought of us it's different
[1:30:56] from what the world has tried to make us
[1:31:00] amen can you say Amen all
[1:31:03] right yes it's the word of God Amen that
[1:31:06] shall remain the word of God shall
[1:31:09] remain I believe 1 Peter 2:5 tells us
[1:31:13] that we are Lively stones and they're
[1:31:16] built up a spiritual
[1:31:18] house but notice what a prophet says God
[1:31:21] doesn't just want want us being
[1:31:23] Stones he said stones are
[1:31:26] confession
[1:31:28] millions millions have confessed Jesus
[1:31:30] to be their
[1:31:32] savior confess to be Christians confess
[1:31:35] to believe the Bible
[1:31:37] confess going in a Rapture confess that
[1:31:40] they're the bride of
[1:31:42] Christ but it's just church members
[1:31:44] making a
[1:31:47] confession that's as far as they go the
[1:31:49] prophet said see the church is today
[1:31:52] they just want members in their church
[1:31:54] so it's all about making a
[1:31:56] decision come on joining the church you
[1:31:59] leave the Baptist Church come join us
[1:32:01] the Baptist or the Methodist come join
[1:32:03] us the Baptist you leave the Baptist
[1:32:05] come on and join us the Methodist
[1:32:06] Presbyterian Lutheran and then the
[1:32:08] Catholic taking all remember remember
[1:32:10] remember remember remember decisions
[1:32:13] decisions but then the prophet says what
[1:32:16] good is a
[1:32:18] stone confession what good is a stone if
[1:32:22] there isn't a stonemason to shape him
[1:32:24] into a Son of God that's right he said
[1:32:26] see you're just piling a bunch of rocks
[1:32:29] it isn't doing any good that's right you
[1:32:32] have a thousand members but it ain't
[1:32:34] doing any good you're just you're just
[1:32:36] piling in a bunch of rocks same old
[1:32:39] school of thought just a little bit
[1:32:43] different ain't that right the people
[1:32:46] ain't coming to a place of discernment
[1:32:48] that's why they're all going into the
[1:32:50] World Council of churches confessing
[1:32:52] Jesus Christ and yet worshiping Satan
[1:32:55] amen the God of this world CU there
[1:32:58] ain't something there a stonemason to
[1:33:00] start shaping them stones into sons of
[1:33:03] God to bring them spiritual discernment
[1:33:06] of what's going
[1:33:08] on praise the Lord
[1:33:12] Jesus Hallelujah to God BR says you're
[1:33:14] just piling a bunch of rocks it isn't
[1:33:16] doing a bit of good see he says the the
[1:33:19] water wearth away the stone that's right
[1:33:21] that's the people see God what good is
[1:33:24] Stones if you haven't got a true Mason
[1:33:26] Stone Mason with a good sharp tool to
[1:33:29] shape him into The Fitting Place in the
[1:33:31] house of God just want to ask you what's
[1:33:34] what goods the decisions what good is it
[1:33:37] putting your name on the book what good
[1:33:39] is it to come join the church if the
[1:33:42] stone Mason isn't there that'll shape
[1:33:44] that and make them quit this and that
[1:33:47] and cut them and make them over this way
[1:33:50] and square them and make them like
[1:33:52] Christians that sits in the house of God
[1:33:55] with signs following the
[1:33:57] believer praise the
[1:34:00] Lord
[1:34:02] amen got to have a stone Mason yes sir
[1:34:05] cut shape aren't you glad that God's not
[1:34:09] just leaving you set in a
[1:34:11] church what good does it do to have a
[1:34:14] big denominations built up by the
[1:34:16] thousands if somebody isn't there with
[1:34:18] the sharp two-edged sword of God to
[1:34:20] shape the them out into real children of
[1:34:23] God might as well leave them out where
[1:34:25] they
[1:34:28] are God has provided himself a knife
[1:34:33] it's not the Methodist Pentecostals
[1:34:35] Baptist
[1:34:36] Catholics it's not denominations it's
[1:34:38] not theologians psychologists or
[1:34:41] whatever can you say amen God has
[1:34:44] provided himself a knife to shape out
[1:34:46] children of God sons of God and it isn't
[1:34:50] just by chance
[1:34:52] that the prophet said he was there in in
[1:34:55] Arizona in Tucson in the backside of the
[1:34:58] desert on a mountain lifted his hands
[1:35:01] and a sword drops in his
[1:35:04] hands can you say Amen we know what that
[1:35:07] word was it's the word of God it was
[1:35:10] symbolic of the word of God that that
[1:35:11] Prophet would have the mind of God that
[1:35:13] Prophet would have the word of God would
[1:35:16] have the power amen not to waste his
[1:35:20] time didn't waste his
[1:35:24] time you've had great healing
[1:35:28] Ministries great healing Ministries that
[1:35:30] have taken place and we thought wow them
[1:35:32] are good a Allen for CH for one or
[1:35:36] Roberts till
[1:35:38] Osburn Kenneth Hagen healing I mean
[1:35:41] they've all dealt with healing in the
[1:35:43] Physical Realm ain't that right and you
[1:35:46] still got some of them doing it not too
[1:35:48] many anymore but some are
[1:35:52] healing healing healing but then here
[1:35:53] come a prophet tell us there's something
[1:35:56] greater than healing in the physical Rim
[1:35:58] it's the healing of the
[1:36:00] Soul no one could bring the healing of
[1:36:02] the soul but a Prophet come to bring
[1:36:05] healing to the soul can you say amen
[1:36:09] amen healing campaign was fine but but
[1:36:11] it wasn't enough that's right it was
[1:36:13] wasn't enough to shape us into Sons and
[1:36:15] Daughters of God ain't that right amen
[1:36:18] the ministry of of Billy Graham was fine
[1:36:20] but it wasn't enough to shape them into
[1:36:22] sons of God Amen the Ministries that
[1:36:24] we've had throughout the world they
[1:36:26] they're they're great they're fine look
[1:36:27] at them they're drawing the millions but
[1:36:29] it's not enough to make a bride to make
[1:36:33] a word bride in this day to cut sons of
[1:36:36] God cut them stones into sons of God to
[1:36:40] place them into the house of God praise
[1:36:43] the Lord can you say Amen so not one
[1:36:45] denomination has what it takes to shape
[1:36:49] a real son of God amen amen we we talked
[1:36:53] about it but the prophet said the church
[1:36:55] is no longer the mouthpiece of God it's
[1:36:58] its own
[1:36:59] mouthpiece it's its own mouthpiece takes
[1:37:02] the word of God and twists it any way it
[1:37:05] wants it's its own mouthpiece and they
[1:37:08] tried it they tried to cut us into sons
[1:37:11] of God have they not they've only
[1:37:13] butchered us
[1:37:15] up butchered our faith to where we
[1:37:18] didn't know what to believe in butchered
[1:37:20] our our joy to where we had no joy
[1:37:24] butcher butchered our our our uh
[1:37:28] Salvation and our Thanksgiving to where
[1:37:31] we sit there just like not on a
[1:37:34] log butchered our experience with God
[1:37:37] butcher it so much that our young people
[1:37:39] don't want it no
[1:37:42] more butcher
[1:37:44] it can you say
[1:37:47] Amen the calvinist don't have what it
[1:37:50] takes
[1:37:52] to make us into real sons of God
[1:37:56] Amen and and the legalists don't have
[1:37:59] what it takes to make us into sons of
[1:38:02] God I've said under that never do that
[1:38:05] again
[1:38:09] amen well maybe you want to that I won't
[1:38:14] no
[1:38:15] no but Jesus told us by the tradition by
[1:38:19] their Traditions their teaching the the
[1:38:22] the Commandments of men right they make
[1:38:26] the word of God of no effect so what
[1:38:29] little truth they may have you say well
[1:38:31] they got some truth what little truth
[1:38:34] they may have they kill it that is by
[1:38:37] teaching for Doctrine the tra the
[1:38:39] traditions and Commandments of men and
[1:38:42] the prophet said They Crucified the
[1:38:44] effects of the word to the people that's
[1:38:47] right can you say amen
[1:38:49] amen so what what what truth they have
[1:38:52] may have they crucify it they kill it so
[1:38:56] they ain't they ain't the mouthpiece of
[1:38:58] God they ain't got nothing what it takes
[1:39:00] Amen to make real sons of God so what is
[1:39:03] it they're blind leaders of the blind
[1:39:05] amen blind leaders of the blind can you
[1:39:08] say amen and and and this is what Jesus
[1:39:12] called the religious leaders of of his
[1:39:14] day Matthew
[1:39:15] 23:16 woe unto you blind
[1:39:19] guides ain't that right called them
[1:39:21] blind guides see brother Brandman said
[1:39:23] they were supposed to be guides guides
[1:39:24] to the people guiding the people to
[1:39:26] salvation but Jesus says you're blind
[1:39:29] and he said let them alone for if the
[1:39:31] blind lead the blind won't they both
[1:39:33] fall in the ditch blind guides how the
[1:39:36] world has been contaminated with blind
[1:39:40] guiding he doesn't want you to rely on
[1:39:42] your own understanding God doesn't want
[1:39:44] you to rely on your own understanding or
[1:39:47] your thoughts or any man-made thoughts
[1:39:49] can you say amen and then he said says
[1:39:51] what were they they were blind to the
[1:39:53] spiritual
[1:39:56] things blind blind to the pattern blind
[1:40:00] to the pattern that God is using to cut
[1:40:02] his church out they didn't know God's
[1:40:05] thoughts they didn't have his idea of
[1:40:08] what God wants his church to be see
[1:40:10] they're blind
[1:40:12] guides amen see so they haven't caught
[1:40:15] God's vision of the church today so then
[1:40:18] what are they doing then blind guides
[1:40:21] the blind they're making the people
[1:40:23] totally different than what God wanted
[1:40:25] them to be in this day they they they
[1:40:27] they they they want the church to be
[1:40:30] totally different they're making the
[1:40:31] church totally different than what God
[1:40:34] has called you and I to
[1:40:37] be right that's right John 17 and
[1:40:42] 19 Jesus said and for their sakes I
[1:40:44] sanctify myself that they also might be
[1:40:47] Sanctified through the truth neither
[1:40:49] pray I for these Al alone but for them
[1:40:52] also which Shall Believe on me through
[1:40:54] their word notice that they all may be
[1:41:00] one is't that the vision that they all
[1:41:03] may be one father as thou father art in
[1:41:07] me and I in thee that and that they all
[1:41:11] may be one in us that the world may
[1:41:15] believe that thou has sent me and the
[1:41:17] glory which thou gavest me I have given
[1:41:19] them that they may be one even as we are
[1:41:24] one i in them thou in me that they may
[1:41:27] be made perfect in one and that the
[1:41:31] world may know that thou has sent me and
[1:41:33] has loved them and thou has loved me can
[1:41:37] you say Amen so now the denominations
[1:41:39] you know go listen to Oneness they there
[1:41:42] and and well a lot of other Jezebel
[1:41:44] religion and things the denominations
[1:41:47] are getting the people to a Oneness
[1:41:49] they're getting them to a Oneness and
[1:41:51] and and all the churches now are crying
[1:41:54] for Oneness see and and are compromising
[1:41:57] for the Oneness and and and all of these
[1:42:00] things but what are they doing they're
[1:42:02] bringing a Oneness to the World Council
[1:42:04] of churches because they think that this
[1:42:07] is the Oneness of God right can you say
[1:42:11] amen and the prophet said the reason why
[1:42:13] they're doing that is because they lack
[1:42:14] knowledge of the word of God they they
[1:42:16] don't know the vision of God ain't that
[1:42:19] right amen see so the Bible promised has
[1:42:22] already promised that they would make an
[1:42:23] image unto the Beast and that it would
[1:42:26] be given power to speak amen ain't that
[1:42:29] right but that is
[1:42:31] not the Oneness that Jesus was praying
[1:42:34] for because when it speaks it speaks
[1:42:37] Blasphemous
[1:42:38] things teaching things contrary to the
[1:42:42] word of God so then God would send to us
[1:42:45] a prophet ain't that right amen and why
[1:42:48] would he send the prophet to fulfill the
[1:42:51] promise he made in Psalms 32 and8 I will
[1:42:54] instruct thee God saying this and teach
[1:42:57] thee in the way that thou shalt go I
[1:43:00] will guide thee with mine
[1:43:03] eye Lord hallelujah you're not going to
[1:43:06] be led by a blind
[1:43:09] guide for this will be God's own
[1:43:14] eye that he will lead you amen can you
[1:43:17] say amen amen and and brother Bram tells
[1:43:20] us that God always sent the prophets to
[1:43:23] be the guides to his people yeah ain't
[1:43:26] that right for the word of the Lord came
[1:43:29] to them that's why Prophet is a sear
[1:43:30] he's like an eagle he can far see far
[1:43:33] above anything of this world sure he
[1:43:36] sees beyond anything why because he's
[1:43:40] he's a sear it's God's
[1:43:43] eye amen and he catches the vision that
[1:43:46] God has and so God sends a Vindicated
[1:43:50] prophet to us and has showed us things
[1:43:52] to come and it gives us the assurance
[1:43:56] that it's been the holy spirit that has
[1:43:58] come to us for here John 16:13 how be it
[1:44:03] when he the spirit of Truth is come he
[1:44:06] will guide you into all truth right for
[1:44:11] he shall not speak of himself but
[1:44:12] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[1:44:14] speak and he will show you things to
[1:44:16] come he shall glorify me he for he shall
[1:44:18] receive of mine and shall show it to you
[1:44:22] all things that the father hath are mine
[1:44:24] therefore said I that he shall take of
[1:44:26] mine and shall show it to you can you
[1:44:29] say
[1:44:30] amen amen we're not a people that's
[1:44:33] wondering what God wants us to be we are
[1:44:36] a people that have a
[1:44:38] vision it's been revealed to us of
[1:44:42] what's to
[1:44:45] come we don't have to wonder what
[1:44:47] heaven's going to be like we don't have
[1:44:48] to wonder about what the new City's
[1:44:50] going to be be like we don't have to
[1:44:52] wonder about what a body or what it's
[1:44:54] going to be like when we leave this old
[1:44:56] world it's been shown to us prise the
[1:44:59] Lord can you say
[1:45:02] amen Amen brother BR say see now every
[1:45:05] true God sent sign has a voice and that
[1:45:07] voice must speak according to the word
[1:45:09] that's given for that day just exactly
[1:45:12] if the voice comes the same old voice of
[1:45:15] the same old he said see you see a sign
[1:45:17] rather and the sign that the man is
[1:45:19] doing is the same
[1:45:21] old school of thought then you can say
[1:45:23] right then that that didn't come from
[1:45:25] God that's right if it keeps identifying
[1:45:27] the same old school of thought it never
[1:45:28] did and never has it would be against
[1:45:31] God's program amen can you say amen
[1:45:34] that's right if a man came and said he's
[1:45:36] a prophet and and and kept pointing to
[1:45:41] himself it it it it it' be wrong we'd
[1:45:44] say it wasn't of God listen to The
[1:45:46] Prophet today in in God proving his word
[1:45:49] and and it just it just struck me you
[1:45:52] know as he's he's he's he preached and
[1:45:56] he was uh starting to call people out
[1:45:58] and then he' turn around and say now
[1:46:00] people don't look at me don't look at me
[1:46:04] amen this is God Amen I'm just your
[1:46:08] brother and I thought how many men have
[1:46:11] fallen because they got lifted up in
[1:46:13] some little gift not even half the gift
[1:46:17] that brother brandham
[1:46:19] had that because of popularity because
[1:46:21] they had a little following they draw
[1:46:23] the people to themselves but brother
[1:46:26] Bram never done that why because it
[1:46:29] wasn't him it was the Holy Spirit can
[1:46:32] you say amen and I thought oh my how how
[1:46:35] how marvelous what a miracle it it it it
[1:46:39] it it is that God could actually do what
[1:46:41] he done through that man and that man
[1:46:44] never ever ever tried to draw people to
[1:46:48] himself he tried to take him to Christ
[1:46:52] it's Christ it's Christ it's Christ and
[1:46:55] he never he never said he he he never
[1:46:57] always he you know he did let us know
[1:47:00] that it was Christ in him working the
[1:47:02] ministry but notice how he does it
[1:47:04] Christ in you Christ in you Christ in
[1:47:06] you why because he had the vision it
[1:47:10] wasn't his own Vision look at me see I'm
[1:47:13] just a good guy look I'm special because
[1:47:15] God is doing this all in
[1:47:18] me but he began to let us know that that
[1:47:21] same God that was in him working these
[1:47:23] things is now in the church
[1:47:26] amen praise the Lord can you say Amen
[1:47:30] see it's got to be something new it's
[1:47:32] got to be something that the people
[1:47:33] don't understand or it wouldn't be sent
[1:47:35] it don't need to be sent if it's the
[1:47:37] same old School of Theology it's got to
[1:47:39] be something different yet it's got to
[1:47:41] be identified in the word for that it is
[1:47:43] for that day see the positive of God's
[1:47:46] word it has to be that there's no slips
[1:47:49] up to it there there got to be the truth
[1:47:51] got to be Vindicated by God the truth
[1:47:54] and the man who speaks it has to be
[1:47:55] Vindicated of God to be a Seer from God
[1:47:58] am or it's wrong that's right can you
[1:48:01] say Amen well do you love the Lord amen
[1:48:06] so he says the end time message should
[1:48:08] meet end time conditions where they've
[1:48:11] got off the message ought to bring it
[1:48:14] back all the way through the scripture
[1:48:16] it'll have to do it this time a call
[1:48:19] back to the original
[1:48:21] word like the other Messengers in the
[1:48:23] day see did in that in the day this
[1:48:26] message will have to be the same we are
[1:48:29] promised that God promised it in his
[1:48:31] word Malachi 4 said it would happen and
[1:48:34] restore the faith of the children back
[1:48:36] to the fathers promised it and were
[1:48:38] living in that day amen he said it's
[1:48:42] always been each time a group of leaders
[1:48:44] that gets the people all mixed up that's
[1:48:47] right it's not so much the people it's
[1:48:49] the leaders that gets them mixed up
[1:48:52] that's right oh you say oh brother
[1:48:54] brandom he said well now let's just wait
[1:48:55] a minute we got to make it this
[1:48:57] scriptural if it isn't scripture then it
[1:48:59] is no good see by their words of wisdom
[1:49:02] in their uninspired leadership words of
[1:49:06] worldly wisdom why there's some of those
[1:49:09] genius that can set together and but but
[1:49:12] you think that Satan isn't a genius at
[1:49:15] it too they can sit that word together
[1:49:19] and he said but you think Satan isn't a
[1:49:21] genius at it tooo did he not uh uh
[1:49:24] approach Jesus Christ and give him a
[1:49:26] reason and even quoted the scripture to
[1:49:29] him he did it he's a genius at it but
[1:49:32] Jesus never argued with him he said it
[1:49:34] is written also get thee behind me Satan
[1:49:37] see it's uninspired leadership
[1:49:41] leaders they are but blind leaders of
[1:49:45] the
[1:49:46] blind can you say amen amen you love
[1:49:50] love the Lord amen that's good isn't the
[1:49:52] Lord wonderful Lord amen so you can see
[1:49:55] why we're happy amen because we've
[1:49:58] accepted the word of the
[1:50:00] Lord ain't that
[1:50:02] right amen now notice as we get to wind
[1:50:08] down here
[1:50:10] amen the the
[1:50:13] prophecy uh uh told
[1:50:16] us am man he says now the he looking for
[1:50:20] the character he said God isn't after
[1:50:22] members he counts character ain't that
[1:50:26] right the character of his word so only
[1:50:31] a prophet can make this type of a
[1:50:35] cut amen because he has the ability to
[1:50:40] cut according to the pattern not
[1:50:42] according to his own liking not
[1:50:44] according to what he his ideas of it but
[1:50:47] him having the the
[1:50:50] character of Christ him having the plan
[1:50:54] the vision he begins to cut out a
[1:50:58] people according to the character of
[1:51:01] Jesus Christ amen can you say Amen so he
[1:51:06] knows what the Church of God should
[1:51:08] be according to what God saw so he has
[1:51:12] the ability to chop out a
[1:51:17] bride to make them a word right
[1:51:21] amen not members of Faith Tabernacle or
[1:51:25] any other church but to make them a word
[1:51:29] bride word
[1:51:31] bride so what is this message what does
[1:51:34] it do to
[1:51:35] us it gives us the
[1:51:39] freedom to be what God ordained us to
[1:51:44] be it cuts us
[1:51:48] out away from all
[1:51:51] bondage yes sir religious bondage
[1:51:55] worldly bondage bondage of
[1:51:59] complex bondage that preachers have
[1:52:02] tried to put us
[1:52:05] under bondages that Traditions have
[1:52:07] tried to make us
[1:52:09] under bondage that even our own
[1:52:13] ideas have tried to put ourselves
[1:52:16] under to where we can be free to be what
[1:52:20] God ordained us to be aren't you glad
[1:52:23] for
[1:52:25] that amen the message of the hour has
[1:52:28] done thaten to be
[1:52:33] free my pastor when I come into the
[1:52:36] message you know and I was so excited
[1:52:38] man I didn't understand a lot of what I
[1:52:41] was talking about but man I'd tell
[1:52:42] everybody about this message and um you
[1:52:47] know uh especially those that I was went
[1:52:49] to church with and things you know I got
[1:52:52] just talking about it and get so excited
[1:52:54] and but my pastor asked me you know one
[1:52:58] time says what what has this all done to
[1:53:00] for you I said well I'm going to tell
[1:53:01] you what is done for me it has Set Me
[1:53:05] Free praise the Lord let me free thank
[1:53:07] you Lord I used to wonder what he
[1:53:09] thought of me used to wonder you know
[1:53:11] well what does he accept me as a
[1:53:13] preacher does he this and does he that I
[1:53:15] always looked up to him nothing wrong
[1:53:17] with looking up to a man respecting him
[1:53:19] but when it comes to where you you are
[1:53:22] under his the
[1:53:23] control of that man something
[1:53:28] wrong and so I was free I I just like a
[1:53:33] bird that was set free out of the cage
[1:53:36] prise the Lord and you know it gives us
[1:53:40] the freedom and that's what this message
[1:53:42] does it gives us the freedom and this is
[1:53:44] this is the vision that g that brother
[1:53:47] brandham had is House of Hell give way
[1:53:50] to the name of the Lord and it wasn't
[1:53:53] just a vision that's the
[1:53:57] the scope of his message if if you could
[1:54:00] say it that way we are becoming The
[1:54:02] Vision by the ministry of the Prophet
[1:54:04] praise the lord we are the word the
[1:54:07] prophecy the vision manifested in this
[1:54:10] day amen that's why we didn't have to
[1:54:13] have brother
[1:54:14] brandom stay with us throughout you know
[1:54:18] everybody's got their own ideas why
[1:54:20] brother brandham left the scene most of
[1:54:22] them say he got off the word and that's
[1:54:24] why he left the
[1:54:25] scene and but that's not true it's
[1:54:28] actually scripture for John the Baptist
[1:54:31] even said I must decrease that he may
[1:54:34] increase and it's turned from the
[1:54:36] prophet to the
[1:54:37] prophecy it's turned from the prophet to
[1:54:39] the
[1:54:40] vision can you say amen amen we are the
[1:54:43] prophecy we are the vision that's right
[1:54:46] whether we realize it or not we are the
[1:54:48] vision if the musicians will come I uh
[1:54:53] you know as I guess most every one of us
[1:54:56] probably have and
[1:54:58] do driving to church I thought man it
[1:55:00] just be nice if if if brother bran was
[1:55:03] here just to ask him questions I love
[1:55:05] just to have a private interview with
[1:55:07] him and ask him some
[1:55:11] questions and you know but then it come
[1:55:14] to me you know as as much as we would
[1:55:16] desire that and like that
[1:55:20] that's not way God established it we
[1:55:22] have to
[1:55:24] believe we just have to
[1:55:26] believe in what God has said we are yeah
[1:55:30] right the prophet what whatever the
[1:55:33] prophet brought this message is good
[1:55:35] enough for every situation yes
[1:55:38] sir it's good enough to take us out of
[1:55:41] everything that we have yes sir problems
[1:55:44] with complexes with what whatever
[1:55:47] whatever you're dealing with this
[1:55:48] message is has enough power to take us
[1:55:51] from this to here amen can you say Amen
[1:55:54] yes he does and and so what we've got to
[1:55:57] do is to believe
[1:56:00] now brother brandom said God intended
[1:56:03] this church to be a powerful Church a
[1:56:06] glorious church that's what he's
[1:56:08] intended that's the vision of his church
[1:56:11] fact before the foundation of the world
[1:56:12] it was a a vision of a powerful Church a
[1:56:16] glorious Church in this age
[1:56:21] so then the prophet can you imagine the
[1:56:24] prophet has the ability to make make us
[1:56:28] make the church a powerful Church a
[1:56:31] glorious
[1:56:35] church and he said see a church that the
[1:56:37] whole world could look upon as the bride
[1:56:39] of Christ well expected and dis spoused
[1:56:43] to live in such an atmosphere and
[1:56:44] conduct itself in such a way that God
[1:56:47] would be proud of this church to present
[1:56:49] it to Christ at the coming of the Lord
[1:56:52] it should live in that characteristic in
[1:56:54] the church and it should be living that
[1:56:57] way can you say
[1:56:59] Amen so how could we be that how could
[1:57:02] we be a glorious Church a powerful
[1:57:04] Church without the message of the hour
[1:57:06] to chop us out to make us that
[1:57:13] right brah said the Gentiles are
[1:57:15] rejecting Christ they're rejecting their
[1:57:17] signs they're rejecting everything
[1:57:19] that's called Godly and branded as some
[1:57:22] kind of telepathy or devil
[1:57:24] power and they're blaspheming the Holy
[1:57:27] Ghost and sealing themselves away from
[1:57:29] God and God will take that Minority
[1:57:33] after a while and raise it up into a
[1:57:36] powerful church and then turn the spirit
[1:57:39] to the Jews and take the Gentile Church
[1:57:41] home amen can you say
[1:57:45] Amen is that not what he's
[1:57:47] doing this church has
[1:57:50] risen I for you maybe young people that
[1:57:54] have never been caught up in Traditions
[1:57:57] of men and church anity and all these
[1:58:01] [Music]
[1:58:04] things you're blessed but if you could
[1:58:07] only
[1:58:09] realize where we've come from and where
[1:58:13] we are
[1:58:14] today we can truly say there's been a
[1:58:16] change in our lives amen we have risen
[1:58:20] into a powerful
[1:58:22] Church a mighty
[1:58:27] church and I hope today that you can see
[1:58:30] that Lord you say well I ain't walked on
[1:58:34] the
[1:58:38] water I ain't raised the
[1:58:41] dead but you know the dead is been
[1:58:44] raised and I'm part of that church
[1:58:48] amen but more than anything there's a
[1:58:51] people that is
[1:58:53] standing their salvation intact their
[1:58:56] Joy intact their faith
[1:58:59] intact their fellowship with God intact
[1:59:03] relationship intact no matter what they
[1:59:07] go through the
[1:59:09] struggles you we we ain't just talking
[1:59:11] about just average people we're talking
[1:59:15] about a people that God has redeemed and
[1:59:17] God has surrounded them him himself his
[1:59:20] presence among them and has cut them out
[1:59:24] to where the church is standing out
[1:59:29] confused by the by the things that are
[1:59:31] going in the
[1:59:33] world and yet there's a bride that's not
[1:59:37] confused she's a powerful
[1:59:41] Church prise the
[1:59:43] Lord she's a powerful
[1:59:46] Church why the power of God is holding
[1:59:49] her
[1:59:49] yes keeping
[1:59:51] her she's
[1:59:53] enduring and she's going to make it you
