[49:11] it says then spake Jesus again unto them
[49:14] saying I am the light of the world and
[49:17] he that followeth me shall not walk in
[49:20] darkness but shall have the light of
[49:23] life and if we could also turn over to
[49:26] uh um
[49:27] Zechariah Chapter
[49:33] 14 man he says I am the light of the
[49:37] world
[49:41] Amen Zechariah
[49:45] 14:7 it says but it shall be one day
[49:48] which shall be known to the Lord not day
[49:51] nor night but it shall come to pass that
[49:55] the evening time it shall be light amen
[49:59] you can have your seats
[50:01] tonight amen I've got a real simple
[50:04] thought I um it's a vast subject um and
[50:08] I am not going to uh but maybe just take
[50:13] the very very very teeny tip of it
[50:16] tonight and I'd like to uh study more of
[50:19] it myself but if I would give a title
[50:21] tonight I would like to title it maybe
[50:24] walking in the light of his word and um
[50:28] I'd like to maybe start off with a
[50:30] illustration and and you know a lot of
[50:32] times we uh uh a lot of our hunting
[50:35] friends know that um you know we like to
[50:38] try to go hunting in the mornings and we
[50:40] uh I like to try to get to my to my
[50:43] stand a little before daylight to try
[50:46] not and spook anything and and a lot of
[50:49] times when you're sitting there and
[50:51] waiting for the sun to come up um and as
[50:54] the sun Sly starts to slowly come rise
[50:58] your your eyes will begin to play tricks
[51:01] on you a lot of times and and and and uh
[51:04] you know I'm not going to lie sometimes
[51:06] it can be a little little creepy sitting
[51:08] there in the dark in the woods and uh
[51:11] but sometimes you just begin to wander
[51:13] as the sun comes up you you start to see
[51:15] things and you wonder if that is a deer
[51:18] or or uh that over there looks like a
[51:20] bear or over there looks like someone
[51:23] standing there looking at me you know
[51:25] and and sometimes it can be be a little
[51:28] little little creepy but as the Sun
[51:31] starts to rise and and as the Shadows
[51:33] begin to fade away and and you begin to
[51:38] see the area for what it really is and
[51:42] and and that deer that that you thought
[51:45] was actually a bush and that bear was
[51:47] actually a log and that person that you
[51:49] thought was standing there was only a
[51:51] tree and when the sun begins to shine in
[51:54] its power my my fear begin to flee my my
[51:58] my my Superstition begins to go away
[52:01] because there was something greater than
[52:03] darkness that was in that was there amen
[52:07] and that's the same thing with the word
[52:08] of God when the light of God uh God's
[52:11] word Rises all superstitions all fears
[52:14] denominational ideas and things spread
[52:17] away and it shows it just exactly what
[52:20] it is amen God in the beginning said let
[52:23] there be
[52:24] light and there had to come come forth
[52:27] light amen there didn't come when he
[52:29] said let there be light there didn't
[52:30] come some artificial light or or
[52:33] anything like that but when but but
[52:35] there had to come A True Light and the
[52:37] and the King light and it only comes
[52:40] that that true light only comes by the
[52:43] word of God Amen and God separated the
[52:46] light from darkness in the beginning and
[52:49] the word of God made manifest always
[52:52] separates the light from the darkness
[52:54] amen people can rise up with this people
[52:57] can rise up with that Superstition they
[52:59] can rise up with that fear they can rise
[53:01] up with that idea
[53:04] and and many man's ideas have risen up
[53:08] in this age but when the king light
[53:10] raises up and vindicates its word and
[53:13] proves its light it shuts all other
[53:16] lights out amen and Jesus said let every
[53:19] man's word be a lie and mine be truth
[53:22] amen his word is light amen do you
[53:25] believe that his word is light and when
[53:28] the light of his word begins to shine
[53:31] all superstitions and all man's made
[53:33] ideas just slowly Fade Away amen because
[53:37] his word is superior over all man's
[53:40] words amen now when uh we know that in
[53:43] the beginning God planted his seed upon
[53:46] the Earth and if you go read in the Book
[53:48] of
[53:49] Genesis uh it talks about it there and
[53:53] the Earth was full of darkness and in
[53:54] order for that seed to come forth in
[53:57] order for that seed to have life it
[54:00] needed light amen and it's been the same
[54:03] throughout the ages brother brandom said
[54:04] God has foretold us that what would take
[54:07] place in each age and the only thing he
[54:10] needs is the manifestation of the light
[54:12] of God upon that scripture to make it
[54:15] live for that age and it will do it as
[54:18] long as the light can get to the word
[54:20] amen when that light can get to the word
[54:23] then something's got to uh uh spring
[54:25] forth amen if the word is gerti it'll
[54:28] make it live it's it's a it's a promise
[54:31] for that day Amen brother brandham says
[54:33] you might plant wheat at one time or a
[54:37] grain at another time depending on the
[54:39] season God's word comes in season the
[54:41] law and the grace and so forth as we
[54:44] went down Through the Ages and each time
[54:46] it's lit up by the manifestation of the
[54:49] light spreading forth the life that's in
[54:52] the seed amen and so we find out that
[54:56] the Sun that we are now enjoying the Sun
[54:59] that when when the Su in when God said
[55:01] let there be light that that sun that we
[55:03] we go outside and we we we accept its
[55:06] its raise and we enjoy its Sunshine is
[55:09] the manifestation of God's word spoken
[55:12] in Genesis amen God spoke and said let
[55:15] there be light and anytime God says Let
[55:18] There be something has to come forth
[55:21] amen and and if God had said let there
[55:24] be light and and a rabbit came forth
[55:26] forth then God's word would be a lie
[55:28] amen but God's word cannot lie and when
[55:31] God said let there be light something
[55:33] had to take place Darkness had to fade
[55:35] away because light had to come forth
[55:39] amen but whatever God spoke had to come
[55:42] according to his word amen and we
[55:44] realize that God's light of the day is
[55:47] his sign the s o n amen God's light for
[55:50] this day is his son in the beginning was
[55:53] the word and the Word was with God and
[55:55] the word was God and the full
[55:58] manifestation of God's word was made
[56:00] known through his son the s o n Jesus
[56:04] Christ amen now we can
[56:06] be there can be no life outside of light
[56:10] brother brandham says a natural or
[56:13] spiritual life produ or light produces
[56:16] life amen can you say that with me light
[56:19] produces life amen now you take a plant
[56:23] if you keep it in a dark room or or a
[56:25] place where it doesn't get much sun
[56:28] eventually it's going to die amen that
[56:30] that uh uh that sun that that that light
[56:34] amen that light produces the life and
[56:36] it's the same thing with the human body
[56:39] if your body doesn't get enough sunlight
[56:41] it would lead to a number of health
[56:43] issues amen uh uh uh when if your body
[56:48] doesn't get that light amen
[56:54] [Music]
[56:56] we lost our sound guy amen amen so so if
[57:00] your body doesn't get enough sunlight it
[57:03] would lead to a number of issues health
[57:05] issues and only light can come by the
[57:08] word of God Amen God's word is the light
[57:11] when it's manifest manifested amen just
[57:15] mute
[57:18] [Music]
[57:22] the
[57:24] amen do you love the Lord
[57:27] amen only light can come by the word of
[57:29] God God's word is the light when it's
[57:32] manifested and each AE God has lotted so
[57:36] much of his word for each age and he
[57:38] always sends somebody to manifest his
[57:41] word amen to manifest that word Luther
[57:44] had a portion and then the people
[57:46] denominated it amen Wesley had a portion
[57:49] of light for his age and then it went
[57:51] off and they denominated and they failed
[57:54] to get back to the word and then he come
[57:56] down to the age that we're in now where
[57:59] God said that I will restore all that
[58:03] was lost amen and all that he was he
[58:05] poured into the church manifesting
[58:08] himself in his people amen not just a
[58:11] portion but all that God was he poured
[58:14] in this last day amen when he sends his
[58:17] light and makes it known to the people
[58:19] the world rejects it amen if you go look
[58:22] through all out the Bible throughout the
[58:23] ages anytime God sends forth his light
[58:26] there's always a people that will reject
[58:29] that light amen and the first church was
[58:32] cut down through Ro Roman paganism and
[58:35] but in the evening time amen that same
[58:38] light not a different light but it was
[58:41] that same light uh that was brought
[58:43] forth through the first church and was
[58:45] cut down is the same light that has come
[58:48] in this evening time Amen to restore the
[58:52] whole word of God the full manifestation
[58:55] of Christ in his church amen the world
[58:58] rejected it the world calls it crazy the
[59:00] the world calls it make belief but it's
[59:02] life to the believer amen this this this
[59:06] light in this day is life to the
[59:08] believer and God has an elected little
[59:11] group who is walking in the light of his
[59:14] word amen now Jesus had been prophesied
[59:18] for thousands of years or for 4,000
[59:20] years that he would come as Messiah and
[59:24] when he came he manifest manifested
[59:27] every promise of
[59:29] Messiah but yet the people of the world
[59:31] the churches and so forth know nothing
[59:33] about him because they got in some other
[59:36] thing that kept them away from knowing
[59:39] this brother brandham says if you take a
[59:41] man who was meant to dwell under the
[59:43] natural
[59:44] Sun excuse me and he went and put
[59:47] himself into a basement and closed all
[59:48] the blinds and blocked every ray of
[59:51] light and just refused to recognize that
[59:53] the sun is shining he denied denies its
[59:56] lifegiving resources he denies the very
[1:00:00] light that would show him where he is
[1:00:02] going he denies the very light that
[1:00:05] shows him where he come from amen and
[1:00:08] it's the same thing today there are many
[1:00:10] people who has refus to recognize that
[1:00:13] the so wind is shining today amen
[1:00:17] they've locked themselves up in man's
[1:00:19] ideas they've locked themselves up in
[1:00:21] man's Creeds they've locked themselves
[1:00:23] up in some denominational idea and the
[1:00:26] and there are traditions and they are
[1:00:28] denying the power thereof amen now we
[1:00:32] all know that Jesus lit up every candle
[1:00:34] of word that was in the Bible that was
[1:00:37] prophesied of him a virgin shall
[1:00:39] conceive and she did amen his name Shall
[1:00:42] be Called counselor Prince of Peace
[1:00:44] Mighty
[1:00:50] God was prophesied of him happened when
[1:00:54] he come on the earth and the World
[1:00:56] missed it oh my that's the saddest part
[1:00:59] the world missed it and why the people
[1:01:01] could not see that was because they were
[1:01:04] living in a glare of another light amen
[1:01:08] they were living in the glare of another
[1:01:10] day amen a glare is a false light and
[1:01:14] and that's what's the matter with the
[1:01:15] world today they are trying to live in a
[1:01:18] glare of light that Shin in another day
[1:01:21] amen and you can't live under this
[1:01:23] evening light you can't live under the
[1:01:25] life for this this day H and Luther's
[1:01:28] day you can't you can't be living under
[1:01:30] the evening light and still live under
[1:01:32] Luther's day and Wesley's day you can't
[1:01:35] H you have to live under the light that
[1:01:38] was meant for this day for this hour
[1:01:42] amen I remember as a kid we would we
[1:01:44] would travel to Arizona to go see my
[1:01:47] grandparents and and I remember when
[1:01:49] when I was real little Arizona on the
[1:01:52] roads it would become so hot and and
[1:01:54] that it would cause them Gage and I
[1:01:57] would ask Dad when we going down the
[1:01:58] road go is that water right there in the
[1:02:00] middle of the road man that it looks
[1:02:01] like a huge just a pond of water in the
[1:02:03] road and he would say no son that's just
[1:02:05] a mirage and Mirage is a false
[1:02:09] conception of the son and when you get
[1:02:12] there it has it hasn't produced a thing
[1:02:15] but something false and brother bam says
[1:02:17] and you can't walk in the glare of the
[1:02:19] sun because it's a mirage always showing
[1:02:22] you something that that isn't there amen
[1:02:26] and when people try to tell you that
[1:02:27] Jesus Christ isn't the same yesterday
[1:02:30] today and forever they're living under a
[1:02:32] mirage they're living under another
[1:02:35] light amen his word says He is the same
[1:02:39] yesterday today and forever amen walk in
[1:02:43] the light of his word and the world is
[1:02:45] living under a mirage of just joining
[1:02:47] Church a mirage of saying some Creed
[1:02:50] there there is nothing there living
[1:02:53] under a mirage of justification they're
[1:02:55] living under a mirage of sanctification
[1:02:58] but when you start living under the
[1:03:00] light of the Gospel of Jesus Christ it
[1:03:03] will shine its warming rise of the Holy
[1:03:05] Ghost amen upon you amen it will make
[1:03:09] you a new creation oh my amen in Christ
[1:03:13] Jesus don't walk in some glare of
[1:03:15] another age amen that's what the world
[1:03:18] does the world is walking in in a glare
[1:03:20] of another age am man now the glare was
[1:03:23] all right in in the other age it was all
[1:03:25] right for them Christ was the uh uh the
[1:03:28] scriptural light for that day he was the
[1:03:30] light he he wasn't the light until he
[1:03:33] come on the earth to vindicate the
[1:03:35] promised word Amen brother BR says you
[1:03:38] know he said there John was a bright and
[1:03:40] Shining Light and you love to walk in
[1:03:43] his light for a season amen and Jesus
[1:03:45] said that John had been prophesied by
[1:03:48] Isaiah for 72 years before the birth
[1:03:51] that a voice of one would be crying in
[1:03:53] the wilderness and then also Malachi the
[1:03:56] last of the prophets 400 years before
[1:03:59] his coming in the third chapter of
[1:04:01] Malachi he says behold I will send my
[1:04:04] messenger before my face to prepare the
[1:04:06] way and here was John on the earth
[1:04:09] making that written word live amen and
[1:04:13] he was the voice of one crying in the
[1:04:15] wilderness and he was also preparing the
[1:04:18] way for the Messiah amen before the
[1:04:21] Messiah and Jesus said you love to walk
[1:04:24] in his light because because he was that
[1:04:27] light that bright and Shining Light and
[1:04:29] John said now I must
[1:04:31] decrease I must decrease and my light
[1:04:35] must go out I have served my time that
[1:04:38] prophesied of me now hear ye him he is
[1:04:42] the one follow him he is the light of
[1:04:45] the world Amen now the Jews thought they
[1:04:48] were worshiping in the True Light they
[1:04:51] thought they were worshiping the same
[1:04:53] God that they turned down the very one
[1:04:56] that they thought that they were
[1:04:57] worshiping they were crucifying amen
[1:05:00] they were making fun of the very God
[1:05:02] they were mocking and made him a
[1:05:04] laughing stock they were crucified uh
[1:05:07] God the very God that brought them amen
[1:05:11] H that thought they were worshiping now
[1:05:13] we know that something is getting ready
[1:05:15] to take place in the end time do you
[1:05:17] believe that we know that that that
[1:05:19] we're here at the end time and we see
[1:05:21] that what the world is doing and we see
[1:05:23] the signs of the end time and it's
[1:05:26] become later than we think amen we're
[1:05:29] coming to the end but the hour is at
[1:05:31] hand when the light is shining the
[1:05:34] gospel light is shining its power of
[1:05:36] resurrection of Jesus Christ manifesting
[1:05:39] himself that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:05:43] yesterday today and forever amen he laed
[1:05:46] that for this day amen the world can't
[1:05:49] accept it but God has a a people who has
[1:05:53] accepted that amen and he He he'll get
[1:05:56] his message over because he always done
[1:05:59] it he will always do it God will always

[1:07:48] history now we know nothing about it you
[1:07:50] can't get warmed by the sign that shines
[1:07:53] yesterday and that's what's the matter
[1:07:55] with the church today that the that's
[1:07:58] what's the matter with the people

[1:08:55] on under a mirage we're not walking
[1:08:56] under a light of yesterday amen
[1:08:59] yesterday is history but we are walking
[1:09:01] under the present light amen that was
[1:09:04] sent for this day the True Light for
[1:09:06] this hour amen the natural sunlight is
[1:09:09] sent to the Earth to ripen the grain for
[1:09:12] the advancing
[1:09:13] Harvest amen there is time in a season
[1:09:16] to plant the seed and there is a time in
[1:09:19] a season for that seed to be ripened
[1:09:22] amen I'm sure we've all planted
[1:09:24] something at some point so we know that
[1:09:26] what I'm talking about you can't go and
[1:09:28] plant corn in the middle of November
[1:09:32] because it is not the time nor the
[1:09:34] season for the corn to be planted in
[1:09:37] November amen sure the the seed you can
[1:09:41] put the seed in the ground and sure the
[1:09:44] sun shines down on that seed but it is
[1:09:46] not to season it won't rip it because
[1:09:49] the season isn't ready amen and when you
[1:09:52] plant the seed and it's due season when
[1:09:55] you begin to plant that that corn when
[1:09:58] it when it's supposed to be planted then
[1:10:00] you can watch that seed take its root
[1:10:04] amen and bring forth uh fruit
[1:10:07] amen and so must God's wheat and grain
[1:10:10] ripen in the season it's in amen the
[1:10:13] grain has to mature with the light but
[1:10:16] the thing of it today brother Bram says
[1:10:18] the church grain doesn't want to mature
[1:10:22] oh my it wants to stay like it was back
[1:10:26] in ausa Street it wants to stay back in
[1:10:29] the healing Revival they they they they
[1:10:31] seen what it what what happened over
[1:10:33] there and they're fine with that they're
[1:10:35] relaxed with that amen that's what they
[1:10:37] want they want to bring the life from
[1:10:39] Luther's day and China in this day they
[1:10:42] want to bring the light from Wesley's
[1:10:43] day and shine it in this day they were
[1:10:46] all right they were the light of that
[1:10:48] hour but this is another hour this is
[1:10:51] another day amen and we have another
[1:10:54] light am amen shine and this is the
[1:10:56] advancement of the Gospel amen and it's
[1:10:59] come to its maturity do you believe that
[1:11:02] amen and it can't come to its maturity
[1:11:04] under Luther's Luther's light it can't
[1:11:06] come under its maturity under
[1:11:09] Pentecostal light amen it can't come
[1:11:11] under what Luther said and and what
[1:11:14] Wesley said and what the rest of them
[1:11:15] says we're living in the light that's
[1:11:18] predicted for this day amen we're in the
[1:11:22] seventh Church age not the Third not the
[1:11:25] fourth we're in the seventh Church age
[1:11:28] amen the grain should be able to receive
[1:11:31] it if it doesn't it falls and it means
[1:11:35] nothing to it the grain is matured when
[1:11:38] the light if it goes ahead with the
[1:11:40] light amen but you see today we find
[1:11:43] people like they like what it was in
[1:11:46] that day and they're trying to live back
[1:11:49] in that glare amen the church should
[1:11:51] ripen as the wheat ripens amen and the
[1:11:54] church should bring forth the bread of
[1:11:58] each age that Jesus Christ commanded man
[1:12:01] shall live by every word that proceeds
[1:12:04] out of the mouth of God Amen not just
[1:12:07] part of God's word not just the portion
[1:12:09] of the word but every word of God Amen
[1:12:13] every age amen the bread that we need is
[1:12:16] in the Bible brother Bram says the bread
[1:12:19] that we need is in the book and it's the
[1:12:21] complete revelation of God's plan it's
[1:12:24] the complete revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:12:26] anden we can't add anything to his word
[1:12:29] we can't take anything away from his
[1:12:31] word and if you do then your name is
[1:12:33] being blotted out of the book of life
[1:12:36] amen amen we've got to preach it just
[1:12:39] the way that the word says amen we've
[1:12:41] got to sing it the way that the word
[1:12:43] says and God will manifest it amen every
[1:12:48] promise that he promised he will
[1:12:50] manifest it just the same we're not
[1:12:54] supposed to take or
[1:12:55] just leave it the way it is and God will
[1:12:59] take care of the rest
[1:13:02] amen Luther turned on the light for his
[1:13:07] age brother Bram says Luther turned on
[1:13:10] the light for his
[1:13:12] age and when the light moved
[1:13:16] on they stayed there come on and they
[1:13:20] built an
[1:13:21] organization and they said oh but this
[1:13:23] is the light amen
[1:13:25] brother Bram says amen and Wesley did
[1:13:28] the same thing Wesley turned on his
[1:13:31] light amen and when the light moved on
[1:13:34] they stayed there and they organized
[1:13:37] amen and said oh but this is the light
[1:13:39] and brother brandham says that then come
[1:13:42] along the Pentecostals and show them up
[1:13:45] that God still sends down the baptism of
[1:13:47] the Holy Ghost he still brings down his
[1:13:50] power of healing which they've denied
[1:13:53] what do they do walked right away from
[1:13:55] it then because it was another light and
[1:13:58] as the light moved on the Pentecostals
[1:14:01] decided they they wanted to stay instead
[1:14:04] of moving on with the light amen and
[1:14:06] they built an organization amen and said
[1:14:10] but we have the light and God has walked
[1:14:13] away from it and it's bringing forth a
[1:14:15] bride and elect out of that group oh my
[1:14:20] move with the light walk in the light of
[1:14:23] his word amise amen we are in bright
[1:14:28] time this is bright time this is
[1:14:31] selecting time do you believe that all
[1:14:34] that the caterpillar left said Joel in
[1:14:37] 2:28 all that the caterpillar left the
[1:14:39] pmer worm eating and all the pmer wor
[1:14:42] left the locust did eat and then when
[1:14:45] they did that uh then what did they do
[1:14:48] after the reformers over the light begin
[1:14:50] to dim out instead of walking on and
[1:14:53] further into the light they organized it
[1:14:57] amen the Catholic Church rejected Luther
[1:15:01] Right Wesley rejected Luther and so also
[1:15:07] uh uh the Pentecostal rejected Wesley
[1:15:11] and the Holy Spirit today has rejected
[1:15:14] the
[1:15:15] Pentecostals but there came another
[1:15:19] messenger Amen to point us not to gifts
[1:15:22] to not point us to speaking in tongues
[1:15:26] amen but Jesus Christ manifested in the
[1:15:29] light of his word amen God sent another

[1:16:15] God promised to do it again in these
[1:16:18] last days what God has promised that he
[1:16:21] will do to turn on a light that can

[1:27:54] and uh this is just a mirage this is
[1:27:58] just something that seems to be good
[1:28:00] that I promise you it's it's not amen

[1:28:30] passing through amen but if God had not
[1:28:33] sent the light where would we be today

[1:28:40] be walking without understanding but not
[1:28:43] only that we would be reflecting the age
[1:28:45] of the This Modern Age but but we're not

[1:33:32] couple months already and uh so looking
[1:33:35] forward to that and uh going to try to
[1:33:39] have a meeting um and and I'll send out
[1:33:43] a text for those that are uh kind of
[1:33:47] a head of
[1:33:49] things uh leading in their department
[1:33:52] and uh so we can and kind of discuss
[1:33:55] these things um uh the upcoming meeting
[1:33:59] and so we're going to be nice to be able
[1:34:02] to do it um this Sunday if we can uh but
[1:34:08] if it's not going to work out then we
[1:34:10] can do it planned for next Sunday but we
[1:34:12] need to start having U kind of getting
[1:34:15] together and getting
[1:34:17] things uh planned out figured out and um
[1:34:21] and also I just pray for some reason uh
[1:34:25] Camp Christie
[1:34:27] has
[1:34:28] um uh is allowing
[1:34:32] or allowing someone to use the
[1:34:37] camp right before our
[1:34:40] meeting and um or they're working out a
[1:34:45] deal with
[1:34:47] someone which means we can't set up the
[1:34:50] tent uh they don't want us setting up a
[1:34:52] tent until a week before for the
[1:34:54] meeting and um I don't know you know
[1:34:58] we're going to talk and find out if
[1:35:00] they're trying to push us out or what I
[1:35:02] don't know but um just asking y'all to
[1:35:06] pray that uh we can we can have
[1:35:12] availability uh we usually set up the
[1:35:14] tent at least two weeks or a little bit
[1:35:17] before that uh so we can have plenty of
[1:35:21] time being a small Church um and we're
[1:35:25] putting on such a big meeting we we need
[1:35:27] time and uh to be able to do everything
[1:35:31] and why they done that I don't know uh
[1:35:34] but the Lord knows and so we just we
[1:35:38] just need to pray and ask God to make a
[1:35:41] way where we can and um uh be able to
[1:35:45] set up uh uh the way we normally do and
[1:35:50] it just be a real help for us and so so
[1:35:54] uh anyways I'll keep you updated on that
[1:35:57] but um um again God bless you uh stay
[1:36:01] warm and um keep everyone in your prayer
[1:36:06] one another and um uh keep brother
