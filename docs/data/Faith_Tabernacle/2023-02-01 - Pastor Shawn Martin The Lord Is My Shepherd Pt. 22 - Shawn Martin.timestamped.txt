[46:43] but in the past I have talked about the
[46:46] two paths that Jesus spoke of of course
[46:50] one is the broad path which leads to
[46:54] destruction and Jesus said that many
[46:58] there be that that that walk in this
[47:02] path
[47:03] and the other one is the Narrow Path
[47:06] which leads to life
[47:09] which Jesus said few there be that find
[47:14] it
[47:15] and so I want to more talk on this
[47:19] um I believe that the the the Narrow
[47:22] Path
[47:23] is the paths of righteousness that David
[47:26] is speaking of and and so uh maybe just
[47:31] to talk about that a little bit because
[47:34] the paths of righteousness this is the
[47:36] path that God's elect walks in
[47:40] a man he leads me in the paths of
[47:44] righteousness and so they find this path
[47:47] uh now if you be there that find it but
[47:50] they're they they're able to find it
[47:52] because the Lord is their Shepherd and
[47:55] that's what David clearly makes in in
[47:59] the the first verse is the Lord is my
[48:02] shepherd and so he is the one that is
[48:05] leading in these Paths of righteousness
[48:08] I believe that the shepherd the Lord is
[48:12] the spirit of truth that Jesus promised
[48:15] to to come in this age and that is to
[48:20] lead us and to guide us into all truth
[48:23] not just some truth but he is to guide
[48:26] us into all truth which tells us again
[48:30] that it would be at the time of an open
[48:32] book that there there would uh uh be a
[48:36] time that all truth would be made known
[48:40] and and this is the paths of
[48:45] righteousness a man and so uh uh in
[48:49] speaking of the spirit of Truth coming
[48:51] in this day I want to read uh there in
[48:55] in Ephesians 1 starting at the third
[48:58] verse Paul says blessed be the God and
[49:02] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath
[49:05] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[49:08] in Heavenly places in Christ ain't that
[49:12] right now that's that's the position of
[49:14] the believer according as he hath chosen
[49:18] Us in him before the foundation of the
[49:20] world that we should be holy and Without
[49:23] Blame before him in love having
[49:26] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[49:29] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[49:32] according to the good pleasure of his
[49:36] will ain't that right and to the praise
[49:39] of the glory of his grace wherein he
[49:42] hath made us accepted in the Beloved in
[49:47] whom we have Redemption through his
[49:50] blood the Forgiveness of sins according
[49:54] to the riches of his grace now this
[49:58] means a lot to us and I want to go on
[50:00] wherein he hath abounded toward us in
[50:04] all wisdom and prudence and and that
[50:07] that he that hath abounded is the spirit
[50:10] of truth that has come in this day he
[50:13] hath abounded toward us in all wisdom
[50:16] and Prudence having made known unto us
[50:19] the mystery of his will so his will has
[50:23] been a mystery and now it's it's been
[50:26] made known uh according to his good
[50:29] pleasure which he hath purposed in
[50:31] himself that in the Dead dispensation of
[50:35] the fullness of times he might gather
[50:38] together in one all things in Christ
[50:41] both which are in heaven which are on
[50:43] earth even in him in whom also we have
[50:49] obtained an inheritance being
[50:53] predestinated according to the purpose
[50:55] of him who worketh all things after the
[50:58] counsel of his own will that we should
[51:01] be to the praise of his glory who first
[51:04] trusted in Christ ain't that right now I
[51:07] the reason I read this in in in uh
[51:10] Ephesians is because I believe that that
[51:14] the uh Ephesians uh is is is is
[51:18] connected with the spirit of truth that
[51:22] uh uh has come and is showing us all
[51:26] truth amen and being made known unto us
[51:30] ain't that right he has abounded toward
[51:33] us and having made known unto us the
[51:37] mystery of his will so there there is a
[51:40] truth and that is the mystery that has
[51:44] been hid before the foundation of the
[51:46] world that has been hid in the mind of
[51:49] God do you believe that amen so so it's
[51:53] it's dealing with that which has been
[51:56] predestinated that which has been in the
[51:59] mind of God and now it's it's it's it's
[52:02] it's uh uh uh being made known and so uh
[52:07] uh if you remember the prophet tells us
[52:10] that there is a parallel between the
[52:14] book of Ephesians and the Book of Joshua
[52:17] ain't that rhyme amen uh there there's
[52:20] the parallel in other words they're
[52:22] connected they're they're speaking of or
[52:24] dealing with the same thing the same
[52:27] subject the uh uh these things and so
[52:30] the the the the the Book of Joshua
[52:33] brother Branham said it should be called
[52:35] the the book of Ephesians of the Old
[52:38] Testament amen because the the uh Joshua
[52:42] and the Ephesians go hand in hand so
[52:45] what does the Book of Joshua deal with
[52:48] then well it deals with Israel coming
[52:52] into their inheritance it it deals with
[52:55] him coming uh into the land of promise
[52:58] ain't that right and and this wasn't
[53:01] just any old land this was a land that
[53:03] was predestinated for the children of
[53:06] Israel it it was predestinated it was a
[53:10] lamb that was prepared for them and it
[53:13] was in that land that they won their
[53:15] battles it was in that land that they
[53:18] had a right to lay claim to it and and
[53:21] move the Giants move the enemy off and
[53:24] say yeah you got to go this is our land
[53:27] ain't that right they could not do it on
[53:29] the other side of of Jordan they could
[53:31] not do it in in in Esau's land they
[53:35] couldn't do it in the land of of the
[53:37] moabites uh they they couldn't do it in
[53:39] any of the land but the land that was
[53:42] prepared for them amen that was an
[53:46] inheritance Amen to the people ain't
[53:49] that right a man so the and and and the
[53:52] people the land was not only
[53:54] predestinated for them but they were
[53:57] predestinated for that land amen they
[54:01] were predestinated for that land and we
[54:03] know that there there are 12 tribes of
[54:06] Israel and and brother Graham talks
[54:09] about it in the adoption series of how
[54:12] that that got new years and years and
[54:17] years uh uh before uh Israel ever
[54:21] crossed over under Joshua's Ministry
[54:24] that uh that they would go there and he
[54:27] knew exactly where every tribe belonged
[54:30] ain't that right amen and so uh brother
[54:34] Brown says each one of those Hebrew
[54:36] mothers giving birth to those children
[54:39] see she spoke the very place in her
[54:43] labor pain where they would be
[54:45] positioned in the promised land now
[54:47] you're talking about inspiration amen
[54:50] they didn't know it and I know they
[54:52] weren't thinking at that time of
[54:54] delivery that they weren't thinking this
[54:56] this little guy is going to a Promised
[54:58] Land I don't think they were thinking
[55:00] that they were just thinking let's get
[55:01] this thing over with right and yet as
[55:04] they as in their travail amen they were
[55:08] naming the place that they would be
[55:11] years and years and years down the road
[55:14] ain't that right and so it was it was
[55:16] God that was directing everything amen
[55:20] uh brother Brown said Joshua after
[55:22] crossing over the land and taking the
[55:25] land then he divided the lamb he from
[55:28] here manessa here this one over here God
[55:32] over here Benjamin you know there's got
[55:34] to be over here and and and uh see he
[55:38] divided the lamb and he says watch when
[55:41] each of those mothers when she called
[55:42] out Ephraim say she was in labor
[55:45] positionally placing him where his feet
[55:49] was setting in oil just exactly every
[55:52] one of them where they were at and
[55:56] Joshua not even knowing this amen not
[56:01] not knowing what the name meant not
[56:03] knowing amen their position at at that
[56:07] time but by inspiration LED of the Holy
[56:12] Spirit after being into the promised
[56:15] land gave each man his promise amen his
[56:20] name was telling him where his promise
[56:23] was and and Joshua under inspiration of
[56:28] the Holy Spirit gave him the promise
[56:30] exactly what the Holy Spirit Spirit
[56:34] promised through the birth back there
[56:36] amen I I think that's awesome Amen sold
[56:40] the land a man when they crossed over
[56:43] into the land the promised land then
[56:46] come the revelation of who they were
[56:48] amen then come the meaning of their name
[56:51] then become a man a placing everything
[56:55] that God had promised years ago and and
[56:58] and the plan began to become known to
[57:01] them a man as as when they stepped over
[57:04] into the promised land ain't that right
[57:07] well I believe that we're we're here in
[57:10] our Promised Land amen I believe that
[57:13] we've stepped over Jordan I believe that
[57:15] that third pool it has to do with the
[57:18] promised land of our age ain't that
[57:20] right and so here we're finding that the
[57:24] spirit of truth I believe it was the
[57:26] same Spirit of truth that was back there
[57:28] with Joshua amen here he didn't know
[57:31] what to do but God already ordained him
[57:33] to be the leader and he told him I will
[57:36] not fail thee I'll not leave thee I'll
[57:39] be with thee you just go cross and I'll
[57:41] I'll show you what to do and the spirit
[57:44] of Truth uh uh uh unctioned him amen and
[57:48] gave him the revelation of where every
[57:51] tribe needed to go ain't that right well
[57:54] I believe the spirit of Truth is here
[57:56] today that is revealing the hidden
[57:59] mysteries of who we are I I can't help
[58:04] but to believe that when the mind of God
[58:06] becomes revealed our position becomes
[58:09] revealed amen when the mind of God
[58:12] becomes Maine known amen we become made
[58:15] known because we were the thoughts of
[58:17] God before the foundation of the world
[58:19] can you say amen amen so we find that
[58:23] the things that had been predetermined
[58:26] predestinated by God a man for Israel
[58:30] amen at that time amen and become made
[58:35] known that we find that Moses's Ministry
[58:38] couldn't do that amen he had a different
[58:41] Ministry than what Joshua had amen uh uh
[58:45] we we find that uh uh Moses Ministry was
[58:49] the ministry of law uh which we know to
[58:53] be the ministry of condemnation a man
[58:56] whereas Joshua's Ministry was the
[58:59] ministry of Grace ain't that right and I
[59:02] say this the only the ministry of Grace
[59:05] a man has the ability to reveal the
[59:08] hidden things of God Amen see because uh
[59:13] it deals with predestination amen when
[59:16] you open the mind of God you begin to
[59:19] understand what was predestinated Amen
[59:22] in this age ain't that right amen God
[59:25] just ain't doing things as as as time
[59:28] goes along but it was all set it was all
[59:31] predetermined it was all or
[59:33] amen but yet it was a mystery God's will
[59:37] God's purpose was a mystery Amen to all
[59:40] of us ain't that right but then when the
[59:43] spirit of Truth came amen and began to
[59:46] open up and lead us into truth we found
[59:49] out that the truth was it was hidden in
[59:52] the mind of God and he began to reveal
[59:55] what was there and we found all along
[59:58] we're not here by accident our lies
[1:00:00] ain't by accident everything that is
[1:00:03] going on isn't by accident it was all
[1:00:05] predetermined before the foundation of
[1:00:08] the world that is the gospel truth can
[1:00:10] you say Amen you're not an accident
[1:00:12] that's a lie amen you were predestinated
[1:00:15] of God that's the truth can you say man
[1:00:19] so we we find that the ministry of Grace
[1:00:23] is the only way that the hidden things
[1:00:25] of God could be made known because it
[1:00:28] deals with predestination now Moses
[1:00:32] ministry again was the ministry of
[1:00:35] condemnation it was the ministry under
[1:00:37] the law which dealt with the The Works
[1:00:40] of man it it it uh you know the the law
[1:00:44] required man to be righteous and yet uh
[1:00:48] uh without there being an atonement amen
[1:00:51] it told you what it need what needed to
[1:00:53] be it demanded it required you to be a
[1:00:57] certain way but it didn't have no remedy
[1:00:59] for you to get there you understand that
[1:01:02] see no remedy and so law does not and
[1:01:06] cannot uh uh provide an atonement
[1:01:10] because for one man doesn't deserve an
[1:01:13] atonement amen the law only deals with
[1:01:16] what you deserve amen Grace doesn't deal
[1:01:19] with what you deserve Grace deals is is
[1:01:22] solely an act from God Amen whether you
[1:01:25] deserved it or not and none of us
[1:01:27] deserved it but yet God by Grace amen
[1:01:30] provided the atonement so the atonement
[1:01:33] comes by grace and not by law ain't that
[1:01:37] right and and so uh law cannot he could
[1:01:42] not did not provide the atonement
[1:01:44] because we did not uh deserve it amen so
[1:01:48] so we find the the law just requires you
[1:01:52] to be perfect sinless but has no remedy
[1:01:55] to make you in that way amen all it does
[1:02:00] is just demand a man you to be such and
[1:02:03] yet you have no uh uh uh uh uh remedy uh
[1:02:09] no way to get there and so it just deals
[1:02:12] with the flesh it deals with the carnal
[1:02:14] man amen the nature of man ain't that
[1:02:17] right and the moment you break God's
[1:02:20] Commandments the moment you break the
[1:02:22] law then there stands the law to condemn
[1:02:25] you now church we were condemned in the
[1:02:28] beginning we were condemned before we
[1:02:30] ever got started because we were sinners
[1:02:33] by birth ain't that right there is no
[1:02:35] way that you could serve God by carnal
[1:02:38] nature there is absolutely no way a man
[1:02:41] that you could please God In the Flesh
[1:02:43] for even the Bible says they that walk
[1:02:45] after the flesh cannot please God ain't
[1:02:49] that right so then we find that the law
[1:02:52] Works death and that was what the
[1:02:54] ministry of of condemnation it was death
[1:02:57] amen to anybody that that lived under
[1:03:01] the law a man see and and to think of
[1:03:04] that if you're under the law you're
[1:03:06] already condemned there is no remedy
[1:03:09] there how do you see light at the end of
[1:03:11] the tunnel then how can you ever hope a
[1:03:15] man to get any better if you're under
[1:03:17] the law of of condemnation that Ministry
[1:03:21] of uh that is administering death and
[1:03:24] administering amen defeat and
[1:03:26] ministering something that makes you so
[1:03:29] helpless and and a sinner before God see
[1:03:33] but we find a man that Psalm says he
[1:03:37] leadeth me in the paths of righteousness
[1:03:42] you know as I got to thinking of that
[1:03:45] that's uh I just got excited about that
[1:03:48] he leads me in the paths of
[1:03:52] righteousness and it is not Paths of
[1:03:54] death it's not the paths of desolation
[1:03:58] it's a path of life
[1:04:00] can you say man it's a path of Life
[1:04:03] Psalm 16 11 says Thou will show me the
[1:04:08] path of life oh that's Grace right there
[1:04:11] ain't that right thou will show me the
[1:04:14] path of life and in thy presence is
[1:04:17] fullness of joy at thy right hand are
[1:04:20] there are Pleasures
[1:04:23] forevermore ain't that right so we we
[1:04:26] look and and and the law it it it puts
[1:04:30] you in jail the prophet said and it does
[1:04:33] not provide an advocate for you there
[1:04:36] there's no advocate so so how how can
[1:04:39] the law deal with predestination then if
[1:04:42] it's dealing with what you are as an
[1:04:45] individual whether you're worthy or not
[1:04:47] the way you know you're not worthy so
[1:04:49] it's it's it's locked you up in jail and
[1:04:52] it doesn't give you any Advocate
[1:04:54] whatsoever now can you imagine being in
[1:04:57] prison a man with no Advocate there I uh
[1:05:01] you know we we needed an advocate ain't
[1:05:04] that right now I I think David is is
[1:05:07] pleading for an advocate here in Psalm
[1:05:10] 17 3 says hold up my goings in thy paths
[1:05:15] not my paths thy paths and that my
[1:05:19] footsteps slip knot ain't that right now
[1:05:22] we know that David Fell and fell and
[1:05:24] fell he was a man of failure but here he
[1:05:28] is he's looking to the Lord and he's
[1:05:30] saying hold up my goings in thy paths
[1:05:34] ain't that right that my footsteps slip
[1:05:38] knot and I I thought that was pretty
[1:05:40] profound amen so how could David plead
[1:05:44] for such a thing as this when he was
[1:05:47] condemned to die by by the law
[1:05:51] amen how is that well I I thought Paul
[1:05:56] gives us the answer to that in Romans 5
[1:05:59] 20 where he says moreover the law
[1:06:01] entered that the offense might abound
[1:06:04] amen the law was there that your offense
[1:06:07] may may abound in other words there
[1:06:10] ain't no getting rid of your your
[1:06:11] offense through the law amen it's just
[1:06:14] there ain't that right but notice he
[1:06:16] says but where sin abounded Grace did
[1:06:20] much more abound so even though the
[1:06:24] people chose law amen you know why they
[1:06:27] chose the law they chose law so they
[1:06:29] could have something to do with it they
[1:06:31] wanted to serve God they didn't want God
[1:06:33] doing what amen uh well see he called
[1:06:36] Abraham by Grace Abraham just an
[1:06:39] ordinary man just uh and uh uh but he
[1:06:42] called him out by grace and yet there
[1:06:45] was everyone else there but he by Grace
[1:06:47] God had had uh uh called Abraham out and
[1:06:51] prayed every destined him to a promise
[1:06:54] ain't that right he gave Abraham the
[1:06:56] promise ain't that right and it was all
[1:06:59] by Grace Abraham didn't know law it was
[1:07:02] by Grace so it was the people of Israel
[1:07:06] that chose the law but even though they
[1:07:09] chose law Grace did much more abound and
[1:07:14] if it hadn't been for the grace of God
[1:07:16] God would have wiped them off the face
[1:07:18] of the Earth amen but there was
[1:07:20] something in the mind of God that he
[1:07:23] could not wipe them off because he had
[1:07:25] already predestinated for them amen
[1:07:29] a destination ain't that right so Grace
[1:07:32] did much more abound sin abounded but
[1:07:36] Grace did much more abound ain't that
[1:07:38] right amen so we find that the law could
[1:07:41] not give the advocate and and to be
[1:07:43] honest we didn't deserve it advocate we
[1:07:46] didn't ask for an advocate amen we
[1:07:48] didn't think we had any chance for an
[1:07:50] advocate who could be our Advocate who
[1:07:53] who one of us amen one of you a man
[1:07:57] could could get me out of uh uh and and
[1:08:00] justly get me out of the things that I
[1:08:04] owe God Amen not one of you could I
[1:08:06] couldn't even do it amen for you amen we
[1:08:09] find that that that that that when the
[1:08:11] when the cry went forth who is worthy to
[1:08:14] open the seals thereof there was nobody
[1:08:17] that was worthy the prophet said Abraham
[1:08:20] had to hang his head Moses had to hang
[1:08:23] his head Joseph that only had one little
[1:08:25] flaw had to hang his head there was no
[1:08:28] one even if you cried for an advocate
[1:08:31] who could be your Advocate can you say
[1:08:34] man now I've thought of that The
[1:08:36] Advocate is one who defends or pleads
[1:08:40] for another
[1:08:41] or to support or argue For A Cause
[1:08:44] policy and we and we will call it word
[1:08:48] predestinated word who's going to appeal
[1:08:50] for that Amen to plead in favor of can
[1:08:54] you say man see we needed that Advocate
[1:08:57] law is saying you're you're you're
[1:08:58] you're you're worthy of death you are
[1:09:00] going to die and we have to just hang
[1:09:02] our head down and say I deserve it I
[1:09:04] know I did it and I you know what else
[1:09:06] could I do amen and and and so therefore
[1:09:10] but here we find there is an advocate
[1:09:12] and and first John 2 and 1. my little
[1:09:16] children these things right I unto you
[1:09:18] that you sin not
[1:09:20] ain't that right that you sin not and if
[1:09:24] any man sin we have an advocate with the
[1:09:27] father Jesus Christ the righteous can
[1:09:29] you say Amen so God by Grace provided an
[1:09:33] advocate for you and I amen that would
[1:09:36] sit there and plead our calls and you
[1:09:38] know what he would plead not that you
[1:09:41] were not guilty because you are guilty
[1:09:43] amen he wouldn't say well amen I'll go
[1:09:47] I'll plead on their record no we had no
[1:09:49] record ain't that right that he would
[1:09:51] take the predestinated will of God and
[1:09:54] he would put him uh uh he he would
[1:09:57] Advocate on that father you can't
[1:09:59] destroy them because you ordained them
[1:10:02] amen to be a bride of yours you ordained
[1:10:06] them to the promises of God and you
[1:10:09] cannot destroy them amen and God would
[1:10:12] provide a Grace for you and I can you
[1:10:16] say Amen yes sir brother Brown said if
[1:10:18] it wasn't for that Advocate we'd all be
[1:10:21] gone wouldn't we but in there we're
[1:10:23] brought under the rich Royal Blood of
[1:10:28] the Son of God and before God we are
[1:10:31] pure and holy
[1:10:34] think of that now amen not by law amen
[1:10:38] that's why God sought to abolish the law
[1:10:40] and he did it he abolished the law when
[1:10:43] he produced an advocate for us ain't
[1:10:46] that right yes sir see so we find a man
[1:10:50] that now we are pure and holy Why by an
[1:10:54] advocate
[1:10:56] amen that's right there's no way that
[1:10:58] you could serve god without an advocate
[1:11:01] there's no way that you you could lift
[1:11:03] up hands tonight amen with joy in your
[1:11:06] heart without an advocate but I'm glad
[1:11:08] that we have an advocate and such
[1:11:10] powerful is that Advocate amen that we
[1:11:13] are pure and holy before who God who
[1:11:18] knows the hearts and the intent of the
[1:11:20] heart he knows the hidden thoughts he
[1:11:22] knows every ounce about you and yet you
[1:11:25] stand pure and holy before him that's
[1:11:28] how powerful your Advocate is
[1:11:30] yes sir so brother Branham in another
[1:11:34] place the worshiper once purged has no
[1:11:37] more desire or conscience of sin he
[1:11:40] doesn't even want to sin he will do
[1:11:43] things wrong everybody say he will do
[1:11:45] things wrong
[1:11:46] but as soon as he does it he will
[1:11:48] confess his sins right there and say God
[1:11:51] forgive me I didn't mean to do that you
[1:11:54] know it father God never sees it but he
[1:11:57] has an advocate he has a confession and
[1:12:01] he makes it can you say man now I want
[1:12:03] to make this very clear now Amen brother
[1:12:06] Brown said the man who goes ahead and
[1:12:09] sins and says well I belong to church it
[1:12:12] don't make any difference it shows right
[1:12:13] that right then in him proves that he
[1:12:17] hasn't got what he says see no sir you
[1:12:20] can't draw bitter in sweet water from
[1:12:22] the same Fountain ain't that right amen
[1:12:24] but I'm just believing here tonight that
[1:12:26] every one of us amen is looking at this
[1:12:29] and saying father I don't want to sin
[1:12:31] father amen I know I'm just trapped as
[1:12:34] the prophet said you're trapped you're
[1:12:36] in this body of Flesh and you're trapped
[1:12:39] amen into sins but then there's an
[1:12:41] advocate ain't that right amen that we
[1:12:44] don't have to hang our head down amen
[1:12:46] and the moment you confess your sin is
[1:12:49] dropped into the bleach of God's blood
[1:12:52] never to be remembered anymore can you
[1:12:55] say man now I can be remembered by you
[1:12:57] because Satan will bring it up before
[1:12:59] you amen and he works on that memory but
[1:13:02] I'm talking about the very God that has
[1:13:04] an infinite mind that knew the end from
[1:13:07] the beginning and yet the sin he can't
[1:13:10] remember because such an advocate that
[1:13:13] he provided for you and I
[1:13:16] yes sir I'm so blessed for that and you
[1:13:19] know what the prophet said Grace
[1:13:20] produced the person of Jesus Christ not
[1:13:25] the law it was Grace ain't that right
[1:13:28] you know why yeah you know how Grace
[1:13:30] done that and God so loved you he so
[1:13:33] loved you and when his love was
[1:13:35] expressed Grace produced an object amen
[1:13:39] windly God his love was expressed
[1:13:42] towards you oh I want to save that
[1:13:44] individual I I I I want to bring him to
[1:13:47] me amen he knew what the devil was going
[1:13:50] to do with you he knew what the devil
[1:13:52] was going to destroy you and make you a
[1:13:54] man a habitual liar or a drunk or or a a
[1:13:58] sex addict or a drug addict or or
[1:14:01] whatever amen back in God's mind he says
[1:14:05] that's the individual I want for my
[1:14:08] bride for he's a part of me ain't that
[1:14:10] right and love was projected to you and
[1:14:14] this is what John says behold what
[1:14:17] manner of love the father hath bestowed
[1:14:20] upon us that we should be called not
[1:14:23] drunks not not abusers not no Goods but
[1:14:27] we should be called the sons of God and
[1:14:31] when the love was projected Grace
[1:14:34] produced the object that love was
[1:14:36] looking for
[1:14:39] ain't that right
[1:14:42] so we we find that as long as a man
[1:14:46] lives under the law
[1:14:47] he will never know
[1:14:49] and neither will he understand
[1:14:51] predestination
[1:14:53] he will never understand the what the
[1:14:56] the mind of God really is oh yes sir you
[1:15:01] know Israel was worthy of death
[1:15:03] according to the law
[1:15:05] but see it never changed the fact that
[1:15:07] God had predestinated to them to that
[1:15:09] land
[1:15:10] ain't that right yes sir these people
[1:15:13] were Misfits but God had predestinated
[1:15:17] them to overcome in that land
[1:15:20] yes sir see amen they didn't deserve the
[1:15:23] promises of God but you know what it
[1:15:26] didn't matter whether they deserved it
[1:15:27] or not God predestinated it and they
[1:15:30] were the people that God was gonna use
[1:15:33] to take over ain't that right yes sir
[1:15:36] amen there was not one of them that
[1:15:38] could say well God see I knew you'd
[1:15:39] choose me I tell you what I'm a good guy
[1:15:41] he met no law condemned them amen they
[1:15:45] were condemned all together amen so they
[1:15:47] couldn't even hold their head up and say
[1:15:50] God okay yeah I'm worthy so I'll go on
[1:15:52] over no no they they didn't deserve it
[1:15:55] but God had already predestinated them
[1:15:57] before they become the Misfits
[1:16:01] ain't that right
[1:16:04] so they didn't deserve it and the law
[1:16:06] proved
[1:16:07] that they didn't deserve it
[1:16:10] but God predestinated them to it
[1:16:12] so it would take Grace not law to take
[1:16:16] them over into the land
[1:16:19] ain't that right
[1:16:20] and remember
[1:16:22] that false prophet Balaam looked upon
[1:16:25] the children of Israel and saw their
[1:16:28] hinder parts
[1:16:30] Amen brother Branham said see he thought
[1:16:33] looky here now listen he thought surely
[1:16:37] that a holy moral God would have to
[1:16:40] curse a people like that that done such
[1:16:42] things as that but when looking upon
[1:16:45] them he looked and he said now lookie
[1:16:47] they've done this and they've done that
[1:16:49] surely there's not a holy God in heaven
[1:16:52] can look upon that and absolutely have
[1:16:54] any blessing with that church because
[1:16:56] look at them they've done this and
[1:16:59] they've done that see he looked at it
[1:17:01] from the I standpoint from the moral
[1:17:04] standpoint trying to judge a people by
[1:17:07] immoral God holy God but he failed to
[1:17:12] see the smitten Rock before them the
[1:17:14] Brazen serpent that atonement that
[1:17:17] forgave their sins can you say Amen oh
[1:17:20] my and so is it today when a people
[1:17:23] laugh and say them Divine healers them
[1:17:25] Holy Rollers they've done this and that
[1:17:27] well I'll admit that but they failed to
[1:17:30] see the the blood of Jesus Christ the
[1:17:32] son of God moving on before the church
[1:17:35] that's right it atones
[1:17:39] aren't you glad for that remember young
[1:17:41] people there's a blood that atones
[1:17:45] Hallelujah amen I believe there's going
[1:17:48] to be young people that's going to make
[1:17:50] it and they and they stand today pure
[1:17:53] holy before God
[1:17:57] for the blood atones
[1:18:00] yes sir and and so brother Branham says
[1:18:03] see there's a sin atonement made for the
[1:18:06] church and people you who know God move
[1:18:10] on
[1:18:11] yeah don't stop move on
[1:18:15] don't sit there and have a pity party
[1:18:17] move on
[1:18:19] can you say Amen don't think about your
[1:18:22] past move on
[1:18:24] amen there's an atonement you can move
[1:18:27] on
[1:18:29] that's how he could lead us in these
[1:18:31] Paths of righteousness there is an
[1:18:33] atonement
[1:18:37] he says God is for you do you believe
[1:18:40] that everybody say it with me God is for
[1:18:44] me
[1:18:45] God is for me
[1:18:48] now I'm telling you this is the spirit
[1:18:50] of truth that is telling us God's for
[1:18:53] you
[1:18:55] hello now if it was just some Bishop
[1:18:58] telling us this then then we'd have
[1:19:00] something to argue about but this is a
[1:19:03] prophet of God that is Anointed with the
[1:19:06] spirit of truth that is being back in
[1:19:08] the mind of God and is it's telling us
[1:19:10] what the mind of God really is
[1:19:14] and he's telling you God's for you
[1:19:17] Satan tells you you can't make it God's
[1:19:19] for you Satan tells you you ain't gonna
[1:19:22] you ain't gonna become anything he's
[1:19:24] telling us God is for you move on
[1:19:29] ain't that right
[1:19:31] no matter how much they try to put a
[1:19:33] curse on it it can't be done you can't
[1:19:35] curse the church
[1:19:37] it can't be done
[1:19:38] the blood of Christ separates that
[1:19:42] God did not look upon any people as
[1:19:44] their own moral standards the only thing
[1:19:46] he looks at is the blood of his own son
[1:19:48] Jesus Christ and any persons that's
[1:19:51] under that blood is safely protected
[1:19:54] can you say man aren't you glad for that
[1:19:56] any person aren't you glad for the blood
[1:19:59] amen any person that is under that blood
[1:20:02] you're safely protected amen from who
[1:20:05] God himself ate that run amen and the
[1:20:09] only way the devil can harm you is is is
[1:20:12] is through the sins of unbelief but
[1:20:16] there is a blood barrier that is
[1:20:18] separating a man you from the devil and
[1:20:21] it's separating you from God in the
[1:20:24] sense that God can't look at you as a
[1:20:27] sinner he looks at you as his son
[1:20:30] man
[1:20:31] you're safely protected
[1:20:34] I'm safely protected
[1:20:38] just tell the devil I am safely
[1:20:40] protected
[1:20:42] you believe it
[1:20:44] yes sir see says oh my under the blood I
[1:20:48] don't care how much you haul or scream
[1:20:50] stay there until morning breaks they
[1:20:53] were under the blood the blood of the
[1:20:54] Lamb the smitten Rock Brazen serpent see
[1:20:57] look they were under the blood of the
[1:20:59] Lamb the blood was placed upon the door
[1:21:01] the lentil of the door they went out
[1:21:04] under the blood amen amen that's right
[1:21:07] this is a blood path bloody pass amen
[1:21:10] who's whose blood his blood
[1:21:13] amen see they went out under the blood
[1:21:16] they got out there and got hungry God
[1:21:19] fed them out of Heaven they got thirsty
[1:21:21] God gave them water from the rock they
[1:21:24] got sick he gave them power for healing
[1:21:26] and Balaam failed to see that
[1:21:29] ain't that right he thought because they
[1:21:32] were so radical in in this way and that
[1:21:35] way that God didn't have any honor for
[1:21:38] them boy he fought wrong ain't that
[1:21:39] right he thought a holy God wouldn't
[1:21:41] have honor to such a people as that but
[1:21:44] there was a blood
[1:21:47] Hallelujah you see he didn't he didn't
[1:21:50] have honor notice how the prophet says
[1:21:52] this he didn't have honor for them he
[1:21:54] did for his atonement
[1:21:57] he provided something that he could
[1:21:59] honor
[1:22:00] ain't that Ryan he don't honor our
[1:22:03] mistakes he doesn't honor our funky
[1:22:06] ideas he doesn't honor our weird ways
[1:22:08] sometimes sometimes we're just weird
[1:22:10] weird acting weird thinking weird
[1:22:13] whatever amen we're getting on an
[1:22:15] emotional rollercoaster amen and God
[1:22:17] there's so much things that God can't
[1:22:19] honor about us but one thing he can
[1:22:22] honor is the blood
[1:22:24] can you say amen he honors that blood
[1:22:28] and that blood will never lose its power
[1:22:30] I don't care if you're in the
[1:22:32] Mountaintop or in the valley or in the
[1:22:35] darkest pits of Hell the blood will
[1:22:37] never lose its power what an advocate
[1:22:46] he didn't have any honor for them
[1:22:49] but he did for his atonement
[1:22:51] amen
[1:22:52] God today no matter what the church has
[1:22:55] done
[1:22:56] you get that church
[1:22:58] no matter what the church has done
[1:23:02] the atonement
[1:23:04] the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:23:07] steal the tones
[1:23:08] for the sins
[1:23:10] aren't you glad for that
[1:23:12] now listen the atonement
[1:23:15] is the only way
[1:23:17] the predestinated will of God could be
[1:23:19] fulfilled
[1:23:20] is by the atonement couldn't fulfill it
[1:23:23] by the law
[1:23:24] you ain't even got to start by the law
[1:23:27] but if you'll look at the atonement
[1:23:29] remember they want a law so they can
[1:23:31] look at themselves say look what a guy I
[1:23:33] am God we're Partners right and God's
[1:23:35] looking out there ready to blow their
[1:23:37] you know blow fire upon them and consume
[1:23:39] them because of the Wrath and they're
[1:23:41] they're filthy and and their their own
[1:23:43] righteousness stuck before God is this
[1:23:45] filthy rags ain't that right amen
[1:23:47] there's nothing about them that God
[1:23:49] wanted a man that he could use of them
[1:23:51] amen all he needed was an atonement to
[1:23:55] where he could go down and live in them
[1:24:00] Hallelujah
[1:24:01] so the atonement is the only way that
[1:24:04] the predestinated will of God can be
[1:24:05] fulfilled
[1:24:07] it's part of the plan of God right
[1:24:14] God
[1:24:15] trusts his atonement
[1:24:19] better
[1:24:20] than he trusts that you will not make a
[1:24:23] mistake
[1:24:26] ain't that right
[1:24:28] he has so much confidence in his
[1:24:32] atonement
[1:24:34] that he seals his people
[1:24:37] way before they get to their destiny
[1:24:42] right
[1:24:44] now if God can trust the atonement you
[1:24:46] can too
[1:24:48] if God so trusts the atonement that he
[1:24:51] comes and lives in you a man woman boy
[1:24:54] girl full of mistakes and failures
[1:24:57] and yet he's living in you
[1:25:00] just because of the atonement that he
[1:25:02] provided
[1:25:03] can't we find a trust in that atonement
[1:25:06] too
[1:25:08] should not our songs be based up off the
[1:25:10] atonement should not our glory be based
[1:25:13] off the atonement should not our praise
[1:25:16] be based off the atonement should not
[1:25:18] our preaching our singing everything
[1:25:20] about us be based off the atonement I am
[1:25:23] what I am by the grace of God
[1:25:32] Ephesians 4 30 it says grieve not the
[1:25:35] holy spirit of God whereby you are
[1:25:37] sealed unto the day of redemption
[1:25:40] you're not sealed at the day
[1:25:43] you're sealed until the day
[1:25:46] right
[1:25:47] he doesn't wait for you to make it and
[1:25:49] then he seals you and says
[1:25:51] Paul that was a tough one I didn't think
[1:25:53] they'd do it but they did it now I can
[1:25:56] silly
[1:25:57] nope
[1:25:59] he called your son
[1:26:01] not because you deserved it but of his
[1:26:04] love
[1:26:06] now brother round says don't that just
[1:26:09] take the scare out of it now
[1:26:11] God's with us
[1:26:14] do you believe that
[1:26:15] maybe say that God's with us
[1:26:18] God's with me
[1:26:20] God's with this church
[1:26:22] God's with my family
[1:26:24] God's with us
[1:26:25] oh my
[1:26:27] not a take to scare out right although
[1:26:30] you sin you got an advocate tell God
[1:26:33] you're sorry come on back that's the way
[1:26:36] to do it don't think you're cast off
[1:26:38] forever
[1:26:38] [Laughter]
[1:26:40] as long as you still have enough desire
[1:26:43] to come to this church come on God's
[1:26:45] still with you
[1:26:46] and you say man as long as that desire
[1:26:49] is still lingering in your heart to
[1:26:50] serve God keep moving on God's still
[1:26:53] with you
[1:26:54] hmm yes sir sure he is yes he would just
[1:26:59] keep moving as long as he as he's called
[1:27:02] you he's still in the saving business to
[1:27:04] call you and all he's calling he's still
[1:27:07] wooing at your heart see come on no
[1:27:10] matter what you've done God still wants
[1:27:12] to forgive you and take you back love
[1:27:14] you a little bit hug you up to his bosom
[1:27:16] oh what a different picture Satan tells
[1:27:19] us
[1:27:20] that God doesn't love us God is just our
[1:27:22] he rejected us we're just Misfits but
[1:27:25] here is a prophet amen looking in the
[1:27:27] mind of God and spirit of Truth Now
[1:27:29] expressing to us all truth
[1:27:32] ain't that right
[1:27:34] expressing all that truth that God
[1:27:36] really just wants to give you a little
[1:27:38] hug and he wants to draw you up close to
[1:27:40] his bosom and just love on you a little
[1:27:42] bit
[1:27:45] give you a few spiritual vitamins put
[1:27:48] you back in the church in your position
[1:27:49] again he came to redeem to seek to save
[1:27:53] that which was lost
[1:27:55] notice another place brother Branham and
[1:27:58] speaking of the Holy Ghost says it makes
[1:27:59] intercession for our ignorance sometime
[1:28:03] we got the Holy Ghost we ignorantly
[1:28:04] stagger into something the holy spirit's
[1:28:07] there to make advocate for us he is our
[1:28:10] advocator he stands there he's our
[1:28:13] attorney aren't you glad you got the
[1:28:14] best attorney
[1:28:17] I thought many times what if I ever got
[1:28:19] in trouble
[1:28:20] you know and you need to you just needed
[1:28:22] the best attorney you might be facing
[1:28:23] death sentence or you might be facing
[1:28:25] life and and you've got to put your own
[1:28:26] life into the skills of an attorney
[1:28:29] and you don't know if he can be bought
[1:28:30] you don't know if he just really likes
[1:28:33] you or not
[1:28:34] he might just be taking the case just to
[1:28:36] get away from home
[1:28:38] I don't know you know and yet your life
[1:28:41] is hinging on what he does for you
[1:28:43] but oh my
[1:28:45] amen our life is dependent upon our
[1:28:47] attorney amen amen whether it's heaven
[1:28:50] or hell and I'm telling you right now
[1:28:51] we're Bound for heaven
[1:28:54] now the prophet already said you can't
[1:28:56] lose
[1:28:57] we've got the best Advocate we've got
[1:28:59] the best attorney there is and I didn't
[1:29:02] call for him God's the one that provided
[1:29:04] it
[1:29:05] hate that ride and I'm just be honest
[1:29:07] God became flesh himself that he could
[1:29:09] become my attorney God not only is my
[1:29:12] judge but he's my attorney
[1:29:14] and not only is my he is my attorney but
[1:29:16] he's already paid my Ransom
[1:29:19] he became My Sacrifice that way when he
[1:29:23] gets up on the throne and he looks at me
[1:29:25] he can't see me he hears my voice that
[1:29:27] he sees the blood and what blood is it
[1:29:30] it's his own blood his own blood is
[1:29:33] bleeding on my behalf
[1:29:36] how can you go wrong
[1:29:41] I hope it's all right
[1:29:44] this is truth you know
[1:29:47] see so we ignorantly stagger into
[1:29:50] something the holy spirit's there to
[1:29:52] make uh advocate for us
[1:29:55] he's our attorney he stands there and
[1:29:57] pleads for us
[1:29:58] we don't plead for ourself
[1:30:01] because the Holy Ghost in US pleads for
[1:30:04] us
[1:30:05] the Holy Spirit giving utterance
[1:30:07] sometimes with words you can't
[1:30:08] understand
[1:30:10] he makes intercessions for us and I
[1:30:12] believe this is why prayer is so
[1:30:14] important in our daily walk
[1:30:18] amen
[1:30:19] yes sir that's what the Holy Ghost is
[1:30:21] when I walk into anything I walk now
[1:30:24] notice how brother bran puts it I walk
[1:30:26] like a little kid
[1:30:27] you walk like a little fella we're
[1:30:30] walking in a dark world full of enemies
[1:30:32] full of sin full of traps full of
[1:30:34] everything you say well I'm afraid to
[1:30:37] take Christian Life I'm afraid to do
[1:30:39] this I'm afraid I will do this don't be
[1:30:42] afraid everybody say don't be afraid
[1:30:44] hey man don't don't be afraid don't be
[1:30:46] afraid to take this Christian Life and
[1:30:48] don't don't be afraid to say God I'm
[1:30:50] going to serve you don't look at the
[1:30:52] future and say well I might make
[1:30:53] mistakes and I might do this and I might
[1:30:55] do that what what if I just make a flub
[1:30:56] of myself don't be afraid to take God at
[1:30:59] his word don't be afraid to commit your
[1:31:01] life to him
[1:31:04] ain't that Ryan Don't Be Afraid we have
[1:31:07] an advocate a man always stands by us he
[1:31:10] is in us and he makes intercessions for
[1:31:12] us the Holy Spirit constantly and he
[1:31:15] repeats that constantly making advocate
[1:31:18] for us all the time
[1:31:22] hallelujah thank God that ought to make
[1:31:25] us excited
[1:31:27] then I'll take all the fear away
[1:31:29] he's making Advocate constantly
[1:31:32] constantly for us all the time when
[1:31:35] you're asleep he's making advocate
[1:31:39] you know the devil does he comes into
[1:31:40] you in bad dreams sometimes have you
[1:31:42] ever just had bad dreams and in bad
[1:31:45] dreams amen they begin to try to affect
[1:31:47] you
[1:31:48] yet the Holy Spirit even while you're
[1:31:50] asleep and even while Satan's trying to
[1:31:51] attack your mind I believe the holy
[1:31:53] spirit is there making advocate for you
[1:31:56] he said he's constantly making advocate
[1:31:59] for us
[1:32:00] he's advocating for us in our ignorance
[1:32:03] he's advocating
[1:32:11] oh my
[1:32:13] so it's the ministry of Grace that takes
[1:32:15] us over into the Promised Land
[1:32:18] into the promises ain't that right and
[1:32:21] you remember what the prophet said the
[1:32:23] promised land is the age of the
[1:32:25] overcomer
[1:32:26] and again that could only happen by
[1:32:29] grace
[1:32:30] you can't overcome by law
[1:32:32] now you're condemned
[1:32:33] now notice Joshua 1 and 2 Moses my
[1:32:37] servant is dead therefore arise now go
[1:32:40] over this Jordan thou and all this
[1:32:42] people under the land which I do give to
[1:32:45] them
[1:32:46] even to the children of Israel every
[1:32:48] place every place that the soul of your
[1:32:51] feet shall tread upon that I have given
[1:32:54] unto you
[1:32:55] every place don't be afraid to walk
[1:32:58] amen don't be afraid to possess
[1:33:01] these things are in the mind of God that
[1:33:03] has been in the mind of God now they've
[1:33:05] been made open to you
[1:33:07] don't be afraid to confess them
[1:33:10] I am the Son of God I am the Spotless
[1:33:12] virgin bride of Christ
[1:33:14] he ain't that right I am faultless
[1:33:17] ain't that right why because there's no
[1:33:20] fault in My Sacrifice there's no fault
[1:33:22] in my Advocate his advocation is perfect
[1:33:26] his blood is perfect
[1:33:29] and that blood has perfectly loosed me
[1:33:34] walk
[1:33:38] ah yes sir
[1:33:40] he leads me in the paths of
[1:33:42] righteousness
[1:33:44] every place your feet Treads upon I've
[1:33:48] given it done to you from the Wilderness
[1:33:50] in in this Lebanon even unto the Great
[1:33:53] River the river Euphrates all the land
[1:33:55] of the Hittites and unto the great sea
[1:33:57] toward the going down of the sun shall
[1:33:59] be your Coast
[1:34:00] there shall not any man
[1:34:03] be able to stand before thee all the
[1:34:05] days of our life as I was with Moses so
[1:34:08] I will be with thee I will not fail thee
[1:34:10] nor forsake thee and you know brother
[1:34:11] Brown takes that very scripture and
[1:34:13] applies it to his ministry
[1:34:15] ain't that right
[1:34:17] now and you you you got to know this you
[1:34:19] say well and the devil will say well
[1:34:21] that that was just for Joshua that was
[1:34:23] just for brother Branham absolutely not
[1:34:24] as long as the people follow Joshua it
[1:34:27] belonged to them
[1:34:30] ain't that right that's what Caleb
[1:34:34] believed anyways 80 years old am I but
[1:34:37] give me my mountain
[1:34:38] he didn't care about them Giants to
[1:34:40] promise that God gave Joshua belong to
[1:34:42] him just as well because he was
[1:34:44] following the message of the hour
[1:34:48] so he says I will not fail thee nor
[1:34:51] forsake thee be strong and of good
[1:34:53] courage For unto this people Thou shalt
[1:34:55] divide for an inheritance the land
[1:34:57] it wasn't meant for Joshua to take the
[1:35:00] inheritance it was meant for the people
[1:35:02] to take the inheritance
[1:35:05] are you with me
[1:35:07] and so is this message
[1:35:10] it's meant for you to take it
[1:35:13] not for you to squabble over it not for
[1:35:16] you to get it intellectually is for you
[1:35:18] to look at it and say that mine that
[1:35:20] promise is mine that's mine if you need
[1:35:22] healing take it if you need Deliverance
[1:35:24] take it if you need Rapture and Faith
[1:35:27] take it whatever you need take it
[1:35:31] amen
[1:35:34] be strong and of good courage
[1:35:37] For unto this people that shall divide
[1:35:39] for an inheritance land which I swear
[1:35:41] unto the fathers to give them only be
[1:35:44] thou strong and very courageous now
[1:35:47] George you understand that he's he he's
[1:35:49] applying this several times to Joshua be
[1:35:51] strong be courageous
[1:35:54] this is the part now Joshua had to be
[1:35:56] strong them people needed to be strong
[1:35:58] now and I have to tell you our Prophet
[1:36:01] was strong he was very courageous was he
[1:36:04] not he stood night after night after
[1:36:06] night facing every devil that came
[1:36:08] against him he was very strong in his
[1:36:11] faith he was very courageous and now
[1:36:13] you've got to be strong and very
[1:36:14] courageous as well this ain't the time
[1:36:16] to pity Patty with the devil this ain't
[1:36:18] the time to bargain with the devil we
[1:36:20] ain't here to sit down and talk and
[1:36:22] discuss and all of these things not one
[1:36:24] piece of my land am I given to the devil
[1:36:27] I'm not giving my family to the devil
[1:36:29] I'm not giving my mind to the devil I'm
[1:36:31] not giving my body to the devil I'm not
[1:36:33] giving my soul to the devil I'm not
[1:36:35] giving this church to the devil amen
[1:36:37] everything belongs to me and I'm going
[1:36:40] to be strong and courageous
[1:36:43] oh yeah there's Giants enough to make
[1:36:46] you fear if you look at it but you got
[1:36:48] to look at the promise
[1:36:56] so he says see be strong and very
[1:36:58] courageous thou that thou mayest observe
[1:37:01] to do according to all the law which
[1:37:03] Moses my servant commanded they turn not
[1:37:05] from it to the right hand or to the left
[1:37:07] that thou mayest prosper
[1:37:10] whether so ever thou goest
[1:37:13] no matter what part of the land you're
[1:37:15] going
[1:37:16] hey man don't don't look to the left or
[1:37:18] the right keep your eyes on that promise
[1:37:19] amen keep it there and be strong and
[1:37:22] very courageous that you may Prosper can
[1:37:26] you say Amen this church is not going to
[1:37:28] be defeated God never meant for Israel
[1:37:31] to enter that land and be defeated amen
[1:37:34] every giant look at what David David
[1:37:35] believed in that promise he knew he was
[1:37:37] a covenant person and when that giant
[1:37:40] was defying the very God that they
[1:37:42] served and the his Brethren his Grand
[1:37:46] his Kindred was standing there shaken he
[1:37:49] was the one to stand up and say but I'm
[1:37:50] a covenant one we are a covenant people
[1:37:53] and here a little boy could look at that
[1:37:55] giant and slay him
[1:37:59] amen thank you
[1:38:01] thank you
[1:38:02] good
[1:38:03] the commission was given to Joshua
[1:38:08] and for all the people
[1:38:10] that followed his message and his
[1:38:12] leadership
[1:38:14] and this is why this is not the hour
[1:38:18] does dissect brother Brandon's message
[1:38:21] and say well this is his opinion and
[1:38:22] that's opinion and this and that and all
[1:38:24] just believe the message
[1:38:27] you may not understand it I'll just
[1:38:28] bleed the message
[1:38:30] and what seems to be contradictory to
[1:38:32] the Bible just put it that you don't
[1:38:34] understand it
[1:38:35] then you say man
[1:38:37] that just put it to my ignorance
[1:38:40] that that that I don't understand
[1:38:43] ain't that right Middle Brother Brown
[1:38:45] said it then then there's got to be a
[1:38:47] reason for it
[1:38:51] so now Joshua's message of Grace
[1:38:54] couldn't exist at the same time that law
[1:38:56] was in existence
[1:38:58] and brother Brown said neither does any
[1:38:59] message that forwards the people on ever
[1:39:02] cons
[1:39:04] coincide with the past message it will
[1:39:07] not do it there's where you have trouble
[1:39:08] today Jesus said does any person put a
[1:39:12] new piece of garment and put it into an
[1:39:13] old or put new wine into Old bottles
[1:39:16] they perish it bursts them open they
[1:39:19] can't stand it and Joshua could not at
[1:39:22] all come into his ministry until after
[1:39:25] Moses was gone
[1:39:27] so you see the very first verse here
[1:39:29] Moses my servant is dead now arise and
[1:39:33] take this people to the promised land
[1:39:35] Moses representing the law had served
[1:39:37] its time
[1:39:39] see the law had served its time
[1:39:43] now Joshua could rise up into his
[1:39:45] position with the ministry of Grace
[1:39:48] and take the people over
[1:39:52] Hallelujah now you we know that Israel
[1:39:56] had grace before the law
[1:39:58] as we talked about the church started
[1:40:01] out in Greece ain't that right man
[1:40:04] always got to do something himself
[1:40:06] but see the Promise was not given unto
[1:40:09] the law and it cannot be fulfilled by
[1:40:11] law
[1:40:12] you just can't it came by grace and it
[1:40:15] will be fulfilled by grace
[1:40:17] so notice the spirit of Truth
[1:40:20] I believe is the spirit of Grace which
[1:40:24] Paul speaks of in Hebrews 10 29.
[1:40:27] here on the 28th verse he that despised
[1:40:30] Moses the law died without Mercy
[1:40:32] under two or three Witnesses how much
[1:40:35] sore of punishment spoji shall he be
[1:40:38] thought worthy who hath trodden under
[1:40:40] the foot of the underfoot the Son of God
[1:40:43] and hath counted the blood of the
[1:40:44] Covenant wherewith he was Sanctified and
[1:40:46] Unholy thing and had done despite unto
[1:40:49] the spirit of Grace
[1:40:50] now that's what's here in in in the land
[1:40:53] today with with this bride is the spirit
[1:40:55] of Grace
[1:40:56] ain't that right even Malachi or
[1:40:59] Zechariah spoke of that when he saw the
[1:41:02] headstone coming and what all did he cry
[1:41:04] Grace Grace Under The Headstone and and
[1:41:07] go go listen to the message of Grace and
[1:41:10] and you have to listen just listen and
[1:41:12] maybe re-listen and re-listen and
[1:41:14] re-listen but brother Brown sank a lot
[1:41:15] in that message amen but he's typing his
[1:41:18] ministry to that as The Headstone and
[1:41:21] it's Grace Grace and he says I've always
[1:41:23] been I've always been you know they've
[1:41:25] kind of blamed me for just being a one
[1:41:27] of Grace but he says I am one of Grace
[1:41:29] amen see and so so and he begins to talk
[1:41:32] to us but but brother Bradham said the
[1:41:34] spirit of Grace comes from the blood oh
[1:41:38] the spirit of Grace comes from the blood
[1:41:40] amen so Paul tells us now that Jesus is
[1:41:44] the mediator and I I'm hoping I'm making
[1:41:46] some sense a little bit uh but stick in
[1:41:49] mind the paths of righteousness amen and
[1:41:52] hopefully we'll get somewhere but Jesus
[1:41:54] Paul tells us that Jesus is the mediator
[1:41:57] of the New Covenant
[1:41:59] oh man
[1:42:00] so the New Covenant yeah now that that
[1:42:03] Covenant God made with you
[1:42:05] it's a covenant right
[1:42:08] did not Abraham make God make covenant
[1:42:11] with Abraham
[1:42:12] remember he tried to make a covenant
[1:42:14] with Adam and he put it on moral free
[1:42:17] moral agent you know it was a
[1:42:20] conditional he put it on conditional he
[1:42:23] says and Adam broke it and brother Brown
[1:42:26] says every time that God makes a
[1:42:28] covenant with man on condition man
[1:42:31] always breaks it but God was so
[1:42:34] determined that he what was in his mind
[1:42:36] be fulfilled
[1:42:38] that plan would be carried out that he
[1:42:41] would make a covenant with man but it
[1:42:43] would be unconditional
[1:42:44] oh man and he shows it through Abraham
[1:42:48] he puts Abraham to sleep right showing
[1:42:50] that Abraham had nothing to do with it
[1:42:53] and and the deeper a Darkness came over
[1:42:55] Abraham brother Brown said show him that
[1:42:57] he was worthy of hell
[1:42:59] ain't that right amen but then the Bible
[1:43:02] says there's a lot a little light Pillar
[1:43:05] of Fire a lake of fire a man that went
[1:43:07] between the sacrifices showing that
[1:43:09] while Abraham was asleep God was not
[1:43:11] only going to fulfill his part but he
[1:43:13] would step over and fulfill man's part
[1:43:15] as well amen and that would be called
[1:43:18] The Grace Covenant not by what you've
[1:43:20] done but what God has done and while you
[1:43:22] were so ignorant and I was so ignorant
[1:43:25] we didn't know what God was doing and
[1:43:27] yet we think God left us we think God
[1:43:29] had nothing to do with us anymore God's
[1:43:31] been with us all the time and he's
[1:43:33] making his word perfect in US
[1:43:37] for he said I'll never leave you I'll
[1:43:39] never forsake you I'll be with you and
[1:43:42] it's all because he honors the Covenant
[1:43:44] that he made with you
[1:43:48] it's a Grace Covenant
[1:43:50] ain't that right now Paul tells us Jesus
[1:43:53] our Advocate is the mediator of the New
[1:43:55] Covenant
[1:43:56] oh
[1:43:58] is the Covenant of Grace it's a blood
[1:44:01] Covenant
[1:44:02] ain't that right
[1:44:04] now notice Paul would tell us that
[1:44:08] here's blood the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:44:10] Our advocate
[1:44:12] speaks better things than did of Abel
[1:44:15] ain't that right
[1:44:17] well see so the blood speaks
[1:44:19] the blood has a voice
[1:44:22] and yet the blood of Christ speaks
[1:44:24] better things than Abel's blood did what
[1:44:26] was Abel's blood it was crying out
[1:44:28] against Cain
[1:44:30] no mercy for Cain
[1:44:32] could you imagine the blood speaking out
[1:44:34] and no mercy
[1:44:38] and and no matter wherever Cain went
[1:44:41] Abel's blood was still calling out
[1:44:43] against it crying out against him he was
[1:44:47] a condemned man
[1:44:49] and God didn't kill Cain but he just
[1:44:52] marked it and wherever he went he was
[1:44:55] marked
[1:44:56] man
[1:44:57] that'd be horrible
[1:45:00] ain't that right
[1:45:01] why because it was the voice of
[1:45:03] condemnation
[1:45:05] it would not wipe
[1:45:07] Cain's actions clean
[1:45:11] it would not take it away it was a voice
[1:45:14] against him of condemnation
[1:45:17] yeah
[1:45:18] ain't that right
[1:45:20] here's what the prophet says though the
[1:45:22] blood has got a voice
[1:45:24] and the voice of the blood is the word
[1:45:27] can you say Amen
[1:45:28] and that's what makes it whether it's
[1:45:30] right or wrong the word is identified by
[1:45:32] the voice of the blood the voice of the
[1:45:34] blood is the holy ghost that brings life
[1:45:36] it is life and it brings life to the
[1:45:39] word and quickens it
[1:45:41] ain't that right so I believe that the
[1:45:43] spirit of truth that is leading Us in
[1:45:45] guidedness are Shepherd
[1:45:47] right yeah
[1:45:49] it's the voice of the blood
[1:45:52] amen
[1:45:54] oh now notice brother Brown said it
[1:45:57] speaks better things the Old Testament
[1:45:59] the blood spoke of guilt in the New
[1:46:01] Testament it speaks of redemption in the
[1:46:04] Old Testament it spoke of death and
[1:46:06] sorrow in the New Testament it speaks of
[1:46:08] resurrection and life it speaks of
[1:46:10] healing it speaks of Joy it speaks of
[1:46:12] power it speaks of life it speaks of
[1:46:14] Heaven ain't that right right here in
[1:46:17] this word
[1:46:19] it speaks of it all
[1:46:23] and it comes from the voice of not law
[1:46:26] but the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:46:29] and that same blood that was shed upon
[1:46:30] the ground that called after his dead
[1:46:32] brother called out after his dead
[1:46:34] brother that killed him the blood of
[1:46:36] Jesus covers everybody say it covers all
[1:46:39] of our sins and speaks peace and
[1:46:42] resurrection and power and life and
[1:46:45] healing and all the Redemptive blessings
[1:46:47] that the blood was shed for it speaks
[1:46:50] for us
[1:46:52] that's what the spirit of Truth is in
[1:46:54] this last day is to lead us into the
[1:46:56] promises
[1:47:01] the blood made the way
[1:47:03] now you brother Graham goes on in
[1:47:06] another place said you say the churches
[1:47:07] has to go through the persecution for
[1:47:10] the Perfection of it know the blood of
[1:47:12] Jesus Christ perfects the bride
[1:47:14] a man who chooses a wife don't put her
[1:47:17] through a lot of punishment he's already
[1:47:18] found Grace to with her and she has
[1:47:21] found Grace with him he's engaged to her
[1:47:23] and if there's anything he'll keep her
[1:47:25] away keep her from every place to turn
[1:47:27] her hand his grace is so great up on
[1:47:31] them and so will it be upon the bride
[1:47:34] and so it is on the bride we unworthy
[1:47:38] creatures deserving of hell but his
[1:47:40] grace holds us through it look at how
[1:47:43] many lost and blind how many Sinners
[1:47:45] there was there in the world the hour I
[1:47:48] got saved but God saved me for a purpose
[1:47:50] and I'm determined by his will to do
[1:47:52] that purpose I don't care what anything
[1:47:54] else goes I want to do it and I believe
[1:47:57] that's all of us tonight I want to
[1:47:59] fulfill his purpose he had a purpose in
[1:48:01] calling me
[1:48:03] ain't that right
[1:48:05] all right so we're going to move on and
[1:48:08] then we'll get ready to close but the
[1:48:11] book of Ephesians is the Book of Joshua
[1:48:13] the New Testament the prophet says it's
[1:48:15] dividing up and setting in order the
[1:48:18] overcome ones
[1:48:25] another place that said the book of
[1:48:26] Ephesians is the Book of Joshua and
[1:48:29] Joshua placing the people where they
[1:48:30] belong
[1:48:32] so again
[1:48:33] the book of Ephesians positionally
[1:48:35] places the the church where it
[1:48:38] absolutely stands in Christ
[1:48:40] ain't that right
[1:48:41] Joshua in Hebrew means Savior and
[1:48:45] represents the promised end time leader
[1:48:47] to take the church over Caleb represents
[1:48:50] the True Believer who stayed with Joshua
[1:48:53] that's me
[1:48:54] right
[1:48:55] amen put yourself there too
[1:48:58] see Caleb represents the True Believer
[1:49:00] who stayed with Joshua another place he
[1:49:03] said Joshua was a god-sent prophet and
[1:49:06] he knew the promises of God so he waited
[1:49:09] for them he waited for a clear-cut
[1:49:12] decision from God and when the time came
[1:49:14] to move God placed the full leadership
[1:49:17] in Joshua's hands because he had stayed
[1:49:20] with the word God could trust Joshua but
[1:49:23] not the other so it will repeat in this
[1:49:26] end day the same problem the same
[1:49:30] pressures
[1:49:31] ain't that right so again notice
[1:49:35] under the ministry of Joshua the mystery
[1:49:39] was made known
[1:49:40] and we see that brother branham's
[1:49:42] Ministry perfectly is in line with
[1:49:46] Joshua's Ministry
[1:49:48] ain't that right
[1:49:50] so with this in mind this is what the
[1:49:53] ministry of of the message is doing it's
[1:49:56] opened up the lamb to us the land the
[1:49:59] book
[1:50:00] right
[1:50:02] it's in this day that we see there's a
[1:50:04] rapture for us
[1:50:06] it's in this day that we see that we're
[1:50:09] we're Enoch's type
[1:50:11] it's in this day where Ruth was our type
[1:50:14] Esther was our type it's in this day
[1:50:17] that the land has been open and now
[1:50:20] we're not just reading about David and
[1:50:22] Goliath we're actually seeing ourselves
[1:50:24] and saying hold it he was our type
[1:50:28] ain't that right there there's so many
[1:50:30] types in this Bible that that that
[1:50:32] applies to you and I that that it's
[1:50:35] incredible that this Bible amen this as
[1:50:38] it has been written as God is moving
[1:50:41] upon men and women's lives and and they
[1:50:43] don't even know it but God knows it he's
[1:50:45] speaking of us
[1:50:47] in this last day
[1:50:50] ain't that right and so it took a profit
[1:50:54] in this day to open the land up
[1:50:56] oh yes the spirit of Truth has come
[1:50:59] to lead us
[1:51:03] in the paths of righteousness
[1:51:08] see the paths of righteousness is the
[1:51:10] plan of God mapped out
[1:51:14] they are predestinated paths
[1:51:18] predestinated for certain people that's
[1:51:20] been predestinated to walk these paths
[1:51:24] Ephesians 2 10 for we are his
[1:51:26] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[1:51:28] good works
[1:51:30] which God hath before
[1:51:32] ordained that we should walk in them
[1:51:37] not you didn't stumble on it he's
[1:51:39] leading you
[1:51:40] in these paths
[1:51:43] can you say amen and these Paths of
[1:51:46] righteousness were already foretold in
[1:51:49] the scriptures
[1:51:50] they are prophetic paths for the age in
[1:51:54] which we live amen oh amen
[1:52:00] now that word predestinate means to
[1:52:02] predetermine to for ordain by a Divine
[1:52:06] decree
[1:52:08] and this all took place
[1:52:10] before the foundation of the world ain't
[1:52:13] that right
[1:52:14] now notice how this how this works
[1:52:16] Romans 8 30 moreover whom he did
[1:52:19] predestinate them he also called when
[1:52:22] was this before the foundation of the
[1:52:24] world and whom he called them he also
[1:52:27] Justified
[1:52:28] before the foundation of the world and
[1:52:31] whom he justified them he also glorified
[1:52:34] before the foundation of the world
[1:52:36] that's why the prophet said you've
[1:52:38] already got your glorified or your your
[1:52:40] theophany is already there waiting on
[1:52:42] you
[1:52:44] yes sir how can it be so how can I
[1:52:47] already brother Branson how can we
[1:52:48] already have is he off any waiting on us
[1:52:50] because God already predestinated it
[1:52:53] it's a path for you
[1:52:55] it's a path for me
[1:52:58] ain't that right there's a table that's
[1:53:00] already spread
[1:53:02] he ain't waiting to add chairs and take
[1:53:04] away chairs and they didn't see who
[1:53:07] makes it it's already a path
[1:53:09] that's ordained for me
[1:53:11] God already knows who's going to make it
[1:53:13] in a rapture it's a path that is
[1:53:15] ordained for me God already knows who's
[1:53:18] going to be in this part of the third
[1:53:20] pool Ministry in this age it's a path
[1:53:23] for me I couldn't come in Luther's age I
[1:53:26] couldn't come in Pentecost I couldn't
[1:53:28] come at the first church I had to be in
[1:53:30] this age it's a path all right
[1:53:34] predestinated
[1:53:39] amen
[1:53:41] so then we also Justified whom he
[1:53:44] justified them he also glorified what
[1:53:46] shall we say to these things if God be
[1:53:50] for us who can be against us
[1:53:52] amen
[1:53:55] you love the Lord
[1:53:57] I hope I'm making a little sense to you
[1:54:00] Paths of righteousness
[1:54:05] brother Brown said if God when I was an
[1:54:07] alien from him so loved me till he
[1:54:09] stooped down to get me and pick me up
[1:54:11] that gives me confidence that he wants
[1:54:12] to use me now he's got confidence that
[1:54:15] God wants to use you
[1:54:17] God wants to use me
[1:54:22] he's got a purpose in doing it now now
[1:54:25] you say but but the Greater Works
[1:54:29] he chose you in this age for that
[1:54:32] scripture
[1:54:33] that's a path
[1:54:34] that's been ordained for this bride
[1:54:40] you believe it
[1:54:43] what about the challenges you know where
[1:54:47] brother branham's you know and he takes
[1:54:49] it from the scripture in in a couple
[1:54:51] places like the Philippian Jailer where
[1:54:53] Paul said believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:54:55] Christ and be in thy house shall be
[1:54:57] saved
[1:54:58] then brother Branham comes right along
[1:55:00] taking that scripture and he says and
[1:55:02] you mothers
[1:55:03] you have a waivered boy or girl no
[1:55:06] matter how Wayward no matter how Wayward
[1:55:08] don't you look at that giant
[1:55:11] no matter how wayward if you've got
[1:55:13] enough faith for yourself then bleed for
[1:55:15] them also
[1:55:17] that is the Sith Lord from the from from
[1:55:19] a prophet's mouth
[1:55:21] why it's a path that's been ordained
[1:55:26] before the foundation of the world
[1:55:29] it's true
[1:55:31] why God been waiting for this bride to
[1:55:33] come up and to rise up in her position
[1:55:35] to come to adopted sons of God that even
[1:55:39] the devil when he takes our children we
[1:55:41] can lay claim to them and the devil has
[1:55:43] to give it up that's a path of
[1:55:45] righteousness
[1:55:47] that's a predestinated path that we all
[1:55:50] have
[1:55:53] and I'm telling you in the paths of
[1:55:55] righteousness no devil in hell can stand
[1:55:58] before you
[1:56:00] it's your promise
[1:56:02] this book is your promise can you say
[1:56:04] Amen
[1:56:10] so he's got a purpose in doing it he's
[1:56:12] seen something in me he's seen something
[1:56:13] in you he had a reason to save you look
[1:56:15] at the people that's unsaved today look
[1:56:17] at the millions he could have took
[1:56:18] beside you but he took you
[1:56:21] don't sit there and just sit around say
[1:56:23] well I just don't understand why
[1:56:24] everybody else just be thankful that God
[1:56:26] chose you
[1:56:29] I may not understand that part
[1:56:33] but all I know is God chose me and I'm
[1:56:35] thankful for it
[1:56:37] and all I can say I am what I am by the
[1:56:40] grace of God
[1:56:41] it ain't because I got a better head I
[1:56:43] think because I got better intellect it
[1:56:45] ain't because I got a better willpower
[1:56:47] than everybody else
[1:56:48] the times that I wanted to quit he
[1:56:51] wouldn't let me quit thank God
[1:56:55] it's our God
[1:56:58] but he took you
[1:57:00] and then notice he says amen
[1:57:03] no one can take your place
[1:57:08] amen again
[1:57:10] you're in God's economy
[1:57:13] no one can do it
[1:57:15] that's his love to you
[1:57:21] how thankful
[1:57:23] we ought to be
[1:57:26] that God would choose us
[1:57:29] now the millions of people that are
[1:57:30] trying to find answers
[1:57:32] we sit here with answers
[1:57:35] of the millions of people that don't
[1:57:37] know
[1:57:38] the love of God
[1:57:40] and they're trying to find joy in the
[1:57:42] beer bottles
[1:57:43] they're trying to find joy in in
[1:57:45] religion they're trying to find Joy but
[1:57:48] God chose us
[1:57:49] to open the Mysteries to us
[1:57:52] that we could walk in these Paths of
[1:57:54] righteousness
[1:57:55] he ordained for us to fulfill
[1:57:58] can you say man
[1:58:00] do you love him I got a lot more but I'm
[1:58:03] gonna close I I don't want to bore you
[1:58:05] but if the musicians will come
[1:58:09] the prophet said God in his great
[1:58:11] economy
[1:58:12] has so set the body of Christ in order
[1:58:14] till there is no one can take your place
[1:58:17] that's how important you are
[1:58:19] no one can take your place
[1:58:28] I could say it this way if you notice in
[1:58:30] the Bible
[1:58:32] we can see men and even women
[1:58:35] then had nothing to do
[1:58:39] with being what they were
[1:58:41] you can turn this down just a tad bit
[1:58:43] it's keeps trying to squeal
[1:58:46] God said to Jeremiah
[1:58:48] in in Jeremiah 1 4.
[1:58:52] before I formed thee now you think of
[1:58:54] this before I form thee in the belly I
[1:58:57] knew thee and before thou camest forth
[1:59:00] out of the womb I Sanctified thee and I
[1:59:03] ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations
[1:59:06] and the prophet said what did Jeremiah
[1:59:08] have to do with that nothing God did it
[1:59:11] so it's God's Sovereign Grace that he
[1:59:14] does things God has a church that's
[1:59:16] going to appear without spot wrinkle or
[1:59:19] blemish and he's already said that
[1:59:23] and then notice he says that church is
[1:59:27] foreordained
[1:59:29] the path is already set
[1:59:33] how can you fail
[1:59:36] how can you lose
[1:59:38] [Music]
[1:59:41] oh I just love the Lord
[1:59:43] I'll close them we'll start next time
[1:59:47] amen
[1:59:49] [Music]
