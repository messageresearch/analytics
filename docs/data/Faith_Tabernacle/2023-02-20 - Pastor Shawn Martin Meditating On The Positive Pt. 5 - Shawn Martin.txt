you know and I think we know that he took the book because we see our name written in the Lamb's Book of Life it's it's something that's becoming a part of us and we know that he's worthy amen and do you love him amen I certainly love the Lord and the musicians can be dismissed it's good to see everyone and brother Terry sister Alice we missed you this morning and sort of good to see you Sister Lisa as well and just everyone and I trust everyone is doing good amen and keeping the Victory and just beating the Devil up amen I guess that's what we're to do is devil Stompers and and praise the Lord but if you have your Bibles um the book of the Philippians the fourth chapter and um we just appreciate the Lord and all that he's done for us and um amen we see the things that are going out in the world today and I tell you what it just stirs your heart amen um want to draw closer to him and looking forward to his coming uh which is very soon hey man before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to our Lord precious father it is so good to be with your people father here tonight and just to know that you're among us father we we brought you with us Lord and it's just a thrill not only to us to meet with you but you to meet with us you're redeemed and father we just humbly ask that you would just have your way God we need you more today than we ever have and our hearts are yearning for more of you father and Lord may we not get slacked may we not take our salvation for granted and what you've done for us Lord but may it so forever burn within us Lord May the convictions May Lord your your spirit just just be overwhelming Lord and be more burning within us than it ever has for we see people getting slack we see the layout of sin age the spirit taking over that God may we are may we have the all in our lamps and our Lambs trimmed and burning bright Lord and father I pray that you would just take over the service now we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen we want to look at Philippians the fourth chapter and the eighth verse it says finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are on us whatsoever things are of good rep or adjust whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things and those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the God of Peace shall be with you amen you can have your seats this evening and not to to keep you long but I do want to continue with the the thought meditating on the positive and um is there such a thing where a person can control what they meditate on I I personally believe you can and because I think just just by that scripture alone it tells us that you can uh you you can control and um for the scripture here tells us what to meditate on and so if it tells us what to meditate on then it it it it then it shows that we have control we can choose as to what we um meditate and so now as we know the prophet said you cannot you cannot control the thoughts that come into your mind um and but you can control um well as as the example we use is that that you can't keep a bird from flying over your head but you can keep him from building a nest in your hair and so um then this word meditate according to Webster is to focus to focus one's thoughts on to reflect on or ponder over to plan or project in the mind intend purpose so with that in mind Paul tells us to think think on things and so not everything is of a good report not everything is honest not everything is just or pure not everything is lovely and and we find that there's more of that than there is the other uh just but yet God tells us to think on things that are just pure lovely honest of good report if there's any virtue if there's any praise uh think on these things we are living in an age where it seems as though people of the world have no control to stop anything they have no power to control or to stop and and you know we're not we're not out to try to control government that's that's fact it's it's going to be we're not out to control things that we are it's impossible for us to control but I think a lot of times we're so busy or and I say we the world people in general are so busy trying to control things that they cannot stop and yet failed to to look at the things that they can control and so uh but we find that people have no control uh over their minds uh they have no control over their passions and lusts they have no control or really over anything uh just to be honest and and I I think the Bible actually says that people would be incontinent and I've looked up that word incontinent and that is the lack of self-control they they have no control so they'll be incontinent and and with this thought people which the prophet Lord predicted it that people are going insane and and now you know I I want to say this for a moment that um just because that you know someone had had put out publicly that people in the message when it comes to mental issues that people don't in the message refuses or they don't understand or they cut you off and that's wrong because we we're finding that the battle is in the mind and there is a lot of mental pressure there's a lot of things that uh if if if we sing anything especially among our young people uh but I think with any uh with with uh any age is that is mental battles mental things that are are going on and and I think we could all raise our hand I guess unless you're you're different but uh that that there is a real mental fight that is going on today more than it ever has and it's and it's it's really is something that is trying to affect the mind and yeah I think and I believe it's because that the the world is going that direction they are going insane and uh and and so it's trying to affect uh the bride more people are just you know uh ending their lives ending their own family's lives ending we're finding more murders rapes and uh incest uh it's it's just oh on and on and on and and the prophet said no one in their right mind would ever do such a thing but it's mental people are literally loosened their their capability of thinking right and so uh and and because of this Satan is able to use uh uh people in whatever degree he wants and we're finding out it isn't it is it's it's it's whether you're rich it's whether you're POI it has no bearing whether you're rich or poor uh uh uh whatever is is the people's minds in whatever level you're you're in or raised in Blue Collar White Collar gold collar you know whatever but Satan is able to use people in whatever degree uh that that he wants to and this is because that people have given their mind over to things that are inspired of the devil and and whether they want to agree with that or not it's just the truth this is Satan's Eden it's his inventions it's and he's doing it for a purpose he all these inventions are for a purpose whether right it's it's just that way and and and so years ago people didn't think on things that people in this age think one but it's it's just it's out of control and and we know it's an anointing uh uh that that has come upon the people and so uh that the Bible even prophesied that it would be in this age that evil things uh would be invented uh Paul would say they would be inventors of evil things and and so uh uh but but I looked it up uh you know inventions it's something that starts in the mind it's something that is drawed up in the mind and and now now I I will say do people just intend to invent evil things I I'm not going to go there even though they are inventing horrible things but but it's it's it's an inspiration that they're under that that they're they're inventing things but Satan is taking them and using it to destroy us it to destroy homes to destroy family to destroy churches to destroy whatever he's just out to do that and I think I think we could all agree to that that the more inventions they come up with the more troubled our young people become the the more troubled that people are becoming and and and it's just it's uh brother Brandon and brother Branham calls it because we don't see them maybe as evil but brother Branham calls it enticing Spirits it's it's an invasion of the United States and so uh we look at it through television uh internet and things as such people have opened their mind up to where Satan has full access to them simply because of inventions I honestly don't think that a man had issues with with with the lusts the passions that men have today uh I don't think 200 300 years ago that men had that problem as they do today because it wasn't opened up to them I'm not saying that it didn't lay there because they're common-born men but it wasn't opened up to them as it is today I don't care what program you get on whether it's Instagram whether it's it's just YouTube or whether it's uh just plain old television or whatever Billboards uh or just go to call around the college or whatever things are becoming more open and more and and to where these boys are be introduced to things that it never was in it to begin you know years ago and and so uh uh and and so but now we we look at what brother Brown would say in his age that the comic books comic books uh that the children were reading were preparing their little Minds The Children's Minds for a blast that the devil was going to give them y'all remember the quote that brother Miranda talked about now look where we are today compared to what that was but it was seed sowing back then and and now and it was preparing the children's Minds and I I I have to say that I think our schools are preparing the children's Minds don't think that Hall I don't think homeless homosexuality just were not it started as seeds preparation that's why brother Brown screamed out against education and and and and Science and all that they have an agenda whether you believe it or not they just have agendas and and and and and they took away prayer out of the school they took away our Bible out of the school and whether the teachers realized it or not the devil knew it because that's ex it's his kingdom it's his world it's his his things and and and so now how does presidents get in the way they are today they wouldn't have got in back then but they're in today uh uh uh they get in so easily and and these things and they're just heathens he just won't say it that way but what is it it's just because we've got a generation that don't care about it anymore I don't care about values they don't care about principles they don't they don't care about it but what was it it was something that was preparing them now you know I I honestly believe then not only the people have given themselves over to these things but I believe we're living in a time where God has given the people over God has given it over it's one thing for a person to open up their mind to something but then it's another thing for God to give that person over and and so I I believe that a person can open their mind to something that's not right and but yeah I believe they can still be convicted uh of it and and something will tell them that they're doing wrong because I think maybe we're all guilty of opening up to something that we shouldn't have and the Lord convicts us and says you shouldn't do that but then it's another thing that God gives that person over now when God gives the person over then I wonder if if there's any more convictions about it honestly don't think there is about things and this is where we're at that people just don't have convictions anymore people don't think twice about doing it anymore people they just ain't got morals hang up principles they ain't got nothing anymore and and you wonder why is that but I believe before God would give a person over that they would have to actually reject the truth before God turns them over right and I'm going to read some scriptures concerning this like Psalms 81 and 10 through 12 I am the Lord thy God which brought thee out of the land of Egypt open thy mouth wide and I will fill it but my people would not hearken to my voice and Israel would none of me so I gave them up under their own Hearts lust and they walked in their own councils they had a prophet right there with the word of God that they walked in their own councils ain't that right acts 7 and 38 this is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake unto him which spake to him in the Mount Sinai and with our fathers who received the Lively oracles to give unto us to whom our fathers would not obey but thrust him from them think of that and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt saying unto Aaron make us Gods to go before us as for this uh Moses see which brought us out of the land of Egypt we want not what has become of him see and and they made a calf in those days and offered sacrifice unto the idol and rejoiced in the works of their own hands then God turned and gave them up to worship the host of Heaven as it is written in the book of the prophets oh ye House of Israel have you offered to me slang beasts and sacrifices by the space of 40 years in the wilderness yay you took up the Tabernacle of moloch and and the star of your God rimfum rimfum uh figures which you made to worship them and I'll carry you away Beyond Babylon see so before God will act in the wrong way or what we would you understand what I'm saying he don't act wrong but he something that would be detrimental uh there let's say it this way before the wrath of God can be poured out upon the people in this age they first had to turn the word down ain't that right and and so uh uh uh Romans 1 21 because when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was dark and professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the people did they changed the glory of The Incorruptible God into an image made like the corruptable man and to birds and four faded-footed beasts and creeping things wherefore God also gave them up this was the reaction of God to what they're doing God would give them up to uncleanness through the lust of their own Hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves ain't that right homosexuality transgenders and all of that this is the result of people forsaken the word right so they changed see who changed the truth of God into a lie see then worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever amen for this cause God gave them up to vile of undivile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature right see and and likewise also the men uh uh leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust uh one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was me and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient see being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetness maliciousness is full of Envy murder debate deceit malignity Whispers backbiters haters of God despiteful proud boasters inventor of evil sayings disobedient to Parents Without understanding Covenant Covenant Breakers that uh without natural affection implacable unmerciful ain't that right so this is what the people became so second Thessalonians 2 and 10 because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved see for this cause God shall send them strong delusions that they will believe a lie and that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness so so we see that that God gives the people over too they give themselves over to evil things they give themselves over and and because they give themselves over God gives them over to to fulfill what they've wanted what they've desired can you say man see this is not a cowboy rodeo brother shalom it's not have you ever been to a rodeo yeah well back in Oklahoma they have them rodeos you know and and I've been to a couple and but uh it and it's just gotten so nasty uh they're dirty jokes and stuff that they use I just decide not to go but but they get on them things you know and they get on that wild that wild Bronco or that Wild Bull you know and the bull the way they go they got eight sections to stay on right and uh my nephew before he gave his heart to the Lord he uh he joined one of these uh rodeos of uh uh you know when it come into town and and you you had to um you had to outlast that bull they put you in a ring and you had the last one standing got got so much money you know and uh so you know well he got you know he's a big old buff dude and but the bull won you know that bull took him out and but but sometimes we think that's the way church is and serving God is that way but that's not see we we don't argue with God we we we've got to come to God's way of doing things and and so when people doesn't want to give their life to God and when they just buck in the system then God eventually gives them over now so so with this thought in mind God always gives his word first first of all ain't that right what we do with his word determines our outcome ain't that right if we keep pushing it aside as though it is nothing to us then there's a certain outcome to that but then we find that David would say Thy word have I hid in my heart that I sin not against thee now so David made the choice to hide the word instead of pushing the word he took that word and hid it in his heart ain't that right so we've got um God tells his people think on the right things think on the right things ain't that right see now brother Bradham says you and I think I've read this last uh Sunday but he says you hear so much today about positive thinking you just put your mind on anything and think positive on it yeah it don't work see the devil can do that see there's only one thing that rules overall see and that's God's word ain't that right so there is a a a an authority when it comes to the word of God see and that's God's word if you're thinking contrary to the word he says then forget your thinking sank on the word ain't that right so there's going to be all kinds of thoughts that run through your mind but then we find out that there's only one thing positive there's only one thing that actually has the that control and that is the word of God Satan's coming in like a roaring lion Satan's coming in like a flood he's he's coming in as the prophet priest invasion of the United States and he's finding every Avenue through every invention a man that he can come through Amen to affect you he again he wants to destroy destroy your life he wants to take the spirituality away from you he wants to get you to where he don't mind you coming to church as long as you don't experience the the realities of God ain't that right amen as long as your mind is thinking on everything else while you're sitting in church and and and and remember when your mind is bogged down a man he he can he can nearly run you over just can I mean just any little old thing anymore that comes it nearly knocks people flat amen see it's just because we we've we've come to his way of thinking no wonder fear is gripping the land today old is all right but there are many many things in the world that tried to direct our mind and again it's it's just it's Satan's Eden it's Satan's kingdom so so what he's doing he's smarter than you and he studies you he's an opponent just as much as the boxer studies his opponent and you should you know he wants to know his weaknesses he wants to know all about him he wants to know if he fights more with the right hand or the left hand he wants to know if he's Southpaw he wants to know everything if he's going to win he's got to know his enemy well Satan gonna study you and he studies you individually ain't that right and we find out that he's he's perfecting his his inventions he's perfecting it to where it's not just Elders amen the elderly it's it's now he's dropped down into teams and now he's even affecting little ones he he knows how to captivate ain't that right but the point is is he wants to direct our minds there's so many things in the world today to direct our minds and the point is is to get us off the word to get us trained to something else get our minds and see and and so and and and the world wants our thoughts to come under their influence Hollywood has influenced Millions Hollywood has influenced the way millions of people think is that right the media controls the way millions of people think about things true the church controls the way millions of people perceive God they they control the thought process it's true when Jesus came to the Earth uh walking the Earth uh there were people that literally thought that the Messiah would be different than what the word said he would be and the prophet says they missed him because they thought different their thoughts their thoughts see the church had trained them through Creeds and teachings of darkness and all that had actually directed their thought process to seeking that the Messiah would be coming differently than what the word said so when the Messiah came according to the word they didn't believe it because their thinking process had been changed but if they would have come under the influence of the word and let their thoughts be directed by the word they would have saw him can you say man and and no matter what the Samaritan lady went through and all that she had been taught right by her mother first he said we know when the Messiah comes he'll do these things and all he had to say is I am he and it caught but somehow she knew the Messiah was going to do that first she said we know right now now I am of the beliefs that our children need to be started off in the right path by being careful as to what they read as to what they listen to as to what they take in can you say man that's why television should not be the babysitter phones should not be the babysitter now I'm telling you it'd be the easiest thing to do is to let your children have phones to where they can just sit there and listen to anything and and all that and they're just as quiet as they can be why we go do our own thing as long as they ain't getting in the in the pantry and as long as they ain't touching the fire and as long as they ain't getting in the medicine cabinet we're fine just give them something to where that satisfies but what we don't realize is they're imputing things that they shouldn't be imputing brother random talking about Abraham Lincoln said the only two things he had was the Bible and Fox's book of Martyrs and he said they were the things that molded the kind of character Abraham Lincoln was now if a comic book can prepare a little child's mind for a blast that the devil's going to give them then then that automatically we can reverse that and say that the right kind of material will prepare their minds to receive what God has for them ain't that right I believe God wants to give them the Holy Ghost you believe that and so if we prepare them for that um yeah well if if if they can receive things that the devil has then they can receive things God has surely right now brother Branham says this way you you keep your Bible laying close to your children he said that's right he said you keep your Bible in close for your children and then read it yourself so to be the example ain't that right so you teenagers and couples alike make sure you feed off the word of God make sure make sure you play them tapes to feed off that word of God play them tapes and don't just listen to video clips that someone's put up a brother Branham play the tape play the tape when you come to church listen to what what is being said ain't that right why because you've got to feed off the word of God come under the influence of the word of God there's nothing wrong with that coming off the influence of the word why because trouble is going to come to you um you're going to face challenges you will meet the enemy already taught us that and when you do make sure you remember the enemy will come you will meet him and when you do meet him you got to know you you can't be in a position to where the Satan Satan can have Heyday brochure on with your mind you can't be in the position that when you're out at work and and you're at the store and you're at at places and then Satan meets you in whatever form then he can have Heyday with your mind because you ain't been grounded ain't that right I mean people can get upset about the most ridiculous things and before you know it they got the gun pulled out why because there's no control they've watched so many murders they've watched so many filth it's just embedded in them so when it comes time that they meet Satan they ain't got none they ain't got no defense and you know the the prophet said the Holy Ghost always feeds off the word amen and so if if you've got the holy ghost that Holy Ghost feeds off the word more than anything else ain't that right so make sure you feed off the word see because you're gonna have to have roots you're going to have root you have to have roots to to keep you to hold you it's like the tree you know when the wind comes He's Got Roots if he's got roots then the wind ain't gonna be able to take him out it's those that ain't got real roots yeah now Satan wants to destroy you he wants to ruin you he wants to make you another statistic he wants to make you believe his lies ain't that right and and you're going to have to be rooted in the word of God you're going to have to have strength to fend off the enemy and I won't say this fun and games ain't going to help you in these times comedy ain't gonna help you in these times now now you know me I I want you young people to have a ball and and and and and you know I I think you should be able to have good times together and and that's that's you know so I'm I'm I'm a promoter of them things but at the same time you know and and your brother and forgive me because uh you know I wanted I want to join you in having a good time but at the same time these little toy guns ain't gonna help you in the back I'm just ain't gonna help you in the battles you know it's it's it's good to have laughter it's good but volleyball ain't gonna help you in the battles uh you know and and and again I I'm not against these things and I I hope you understand but now I you know as much as I promote that and I want my boys to have fun because I'd rather my boys doing that than out there uh partying uh you know with the rock and rollers and and all of these things so so it you know we can't take all the fun away you understand what I'm saying you know uh sure it's easy when I'm I'm an older man and and and I now I'm worrying about breaking my bones right brush my and and I'm worried about getting out there you know I used to skate too but you know what I get out there and skate and I'm thinking oh my Lord if I break a bone you know that's going to be rough but but so I'm in my age now but I can't look at my children being young so y'all can't do that you know uh uh now sure we want to apply wisdom right but and say think before you do them things but still you gotta enjoy life uh uh because so I was a teenager once and we had a good time right but so I'd rather you have a good time than again out there partying and running the streets and all that and I'm for the hunting and the fishing and the and and whatever so there is that balance but now we're talking about some real things there is a real enemy and and so you cannot be shallow when it comes to knowing the word of God you you cannot be shallow when when you when the enemy faces you you gotta know that it's your enemy and how to defeat that enemy is that all right you want to know where you stand in the word and so you want to have your mind and your thoughts in the word of God and and you want the word of God to be deposited in you ain't that right and and many of you have already been fighting the enemy and I I I want to say that you've done a great job at defeating him standing true uh uh but I also say don't you let up the battle gets hot the battle gets weary it it just you know and sometimes you don't see the light at the end of the tunnel and and you're there and Satan is just vehemently uh uh there but and it may seem that he's getting the upper hand but I want to tell you that's not true can you say man you're just in a Warfare but you you keep that word deposited in you yeah the times that you get under the pressure and the times that you don't feel the Lord sometime you know sometimes you just may not know what's up and down and and and and these things but but but but but but stand there upon that word don't give up now we you you Elders you know good and well how the word devil works he'll battle you and fight you and fight you maybe with temptation and maybe there's just a certain way that he he keeps hitting you out keeps hitting you and you you stand and you stand and maybe you fall then you get back up and you're standing and you're standing and it just keeps sitting there and he wants to make you think young people he wants to make you think that that's just the way you are because it comes at you so many times in them areas and I think the elders could actually testify to that that if you just keep standing you'll find your victory you'll find that you'll overcome but it's in that battles that Satan just keeps wearing you down and trying to wear you down and wear you down can you say man and before you know it if you're not careful you start thinking on other things you start thinking of other ways and and you think well maybe it's not working maybe I'm not where I'm supposed to be maybe and all it is is you're standing upon the word of God and every day that you're standing every day that you're confessing the word every day that you're lifting your hands and thanking God the devil Ain't Got You every time he's fighting you shows he ain't got you so keep standing upon this word you don't need Plan B you don't need plan C just stay with the word it'll work every time you believe that so we must deposit the word within us and I'm going to close here that I believe it starts by meditating on the word and I'm not speaking of just having an intellectual knowledge of it but I'm speaking upon meditating it on it from your heart the word has to get in your heart Psalms 19 14 David speaks of the meditation of my heart see the meditation of my heart and Psalms 49 3 my mouth shall speak of wisdom and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding amen so you're not meditating on confusion you're not getting this and this report and that report and that report you're standing right with one report and that's the word of God and your meditation is not meditation meditating of confusion but your meditation shall be of understanding ain't that right that's right see and and then you you look here uh and we all know it as the man thinketh in him as a man thinketh in his heart so is he ain't that right so I want to say it this way don't think on your problems and I'm not I'm not being a positive thinker here in that way but I do want you to repeat after me I shall not think on my problems I shall not think on what's wrong with me I shall not thank all my failures I'm going to think on God's word gonna think on God's word that's where your meditation should be I'm going to think on God's word and you say man don't dwell on what others do or say don't meditate on that as Jesus said what it is what is it to thee just follow thou me ain't that right don't think on this see don't think upon that you're losing your mind don't think on that ain't that right don't think about how sick you are don't think on that think on God's word and God's word says you're well God's word said you're healed God's word says it all ain't that right that's the only way you're going to defeat the Devil now is you got to stand on the ground you got to have some roots to defeat the enemy with now now Jesus never or Jesus never tells us as to what kind of Trials you're going to have he never tells you that he just says think it not strange concerning the fiery trials that come your way no don't think it's strange it's going to happen now brother Brown says this and this is how the this is not mental now this comes from the heart now this is what you're supposed to how you're supposed to respond you say well now brother Branham I don't know whether I can move my hand or not you'll never move it as long as you think like that you'll never move it as long as you think that believe that he has already done it then you say that he's already done it he's already done it now that's what you're supposed to think on that's the meditation that you should be thinking you realize that all the inventions and everything that the people are thinking people are so gloomy negative down dishearted because they think on nothing but negative media puts negativity that's all you hear on the news negative negative negative and so you anymore everything is just the reports of negative and it affects the people to where everything is so negative right troubles come in the home you know I've seen the parents scream at their children you idiot you dummy I just don't understand you why are you always troubling me people always have told me when I was kids when when my children were small oh you better be careful they're Angels now wait till they're teenagers I never accepted that never would why because I speaking negative sure teenagers go through challenges and my children's gone through them and we've gone through them challenges but by God's grace we've remained positive about it and you say man why because the word's positive yeah you love the Lord see the word helps us in every aspect every stage of our life so as parents as as we're getting older in life as a pastor I have to be positive because it's the word the positive is the word everything about you you're positive you you got to be the word is your absolute so when you young people you're going through your battles and and maybe maybe it involves with who do I marry who do I do this what job do I take what is my future where do I go have you ever just been there in in in the future just right here and you ain't got answers and that's rough when you're trying to live life go through through life without answers of the future but you really have the answers it may not be specific in the way that this is the one you're going to marry and this what the job you're going to take and this is what you're going to do but but but there is there's answers trust in the Lord with all thine heart and in all thy ways acknowledge me and he shall acknowledge the Lord and He Shall direct thy past that's an answer that's that's that's enough answer right there and there's more answers but there's that's enough answer to where you just don't give up it's enough answer for you to meditate on to where you just don't look at and and just think life and life is just gonna always be this way no he'll lead you and guide you into all truth he'll he'll take you if you just say Jesus hold my hand can you say man we could go more but if the musicians will come but brother Ram said you'll never move it as long as you think that believe that he's done it and go say everybody say go say he's done it so testify he's done it he's done it well how do you know he said it he's done it so so so you can apply that to anything well what if what if my child you know what if what if they're lost what if they died today in their loss why would you think them things you'll never get anywhere that way if you ain't gonna get anywhere by saying well what if I can't move my hand well I just can't move my hand said you'll never move it then so if you keep looking at the negative oh well they're doing this and well they're doing that well sure Satan's going to tell you all that but why meditate on it why let it go there don't let your mind go there don't meditate on them things think of what God Said think upon them promises because the the the ultimate the word of God has complete authority over every situation does it not so he says this way and this applies not only to healing but applies to anything that you want to look at but he says believe that he's done it and go say he's done it and act like he's done it act like it he said move it an inch and if you can't move it let's take it all move it a little bit further see the next day just say I'll move it a little further the next day say I'll move it a little further and Satan says well that's as far as you can go you say back because see he'll enter in your thought and say well see you can't do that you're well that's just the devil anything negative is of the devil right because there's nothing negative in Christianity so the devil will tell you well that's as far as you can go and that may just come as a thought but you say oh no I'm going on and keep on with it and stay with it great faith will bring you right now see a little faith will bring you on anyhow if you'll stay with it just when you see the ray of light follow it stay with it it'll bring you out and you say Amen do you love the Lord we could go on but we'll leave it there and start maybe next week or whenever but God bless
