we thank you Father God for every every answer to prayer Lord Jesus many times father God it's like the seasons the way you answer we don't notice the days getting shorter we don't notice them getting

this is the evening time praise the Lord an exciting time a wonderful time a dangerous time in the last days will be perilous times it's a wonderful time as we've said many times all the prophets and sages of all down Through the Ages have look forward to this time both all this is the closing out of all time the seventh seal is open the word thec of the Covenant Angel Revelations 10 oh mercy what a time what a Time easy not easy wonderful it's wonderful thank you thank you musicians greet you in the name of the Lord are you ready this morning Classen Joe you bring your pencil and paper no oh it's just so good to be a Christian I was thinking about the song that uh sister kimy sang about I never see the righteous forsaken or his seed begging bread you know brother Ram taught us that that of course the Bible has all scripture has a compound meaning but when you think about that really the application of that I've never seen a righteous which is God's seed forsaken or his seed of course is his seed or his seed begging bread really that's not really so much talking about the natural but that's talking about the spiritual seed because God's always had a witness he's always had his word on Earth for his seed his seed has never had to beg bread God provides his word his word is a seed and he provides his word for all of his seed so they never have to beg for it God provides it somehow it may not come on just when we want it but it come right on time his seed never has to beg for bread so I like that song has a real real meaning his seed never has to beg for bread amen I want to turn in your Bibles and um maybe a little disappointing uh today because probably going to let you out a little bit early won't be an hour and 10 minutes um because what I have this morning I have plenty I've got folders and notes and papers laid all around my office and no I want to just focus on this one little short thing I want to just lay this in there and then I'm going to try to quit okay fair enough all right John chapter 10 I like that who said that was that Alice amen I know her amen praise the lord it's it's really good to be a Christian we're just so happy we just love I love people love one another love the Believers Love The Fellowship of the Saints there no other place to be just hallelujah amen in John chapter 10 let start with verse 22 I'm just going to try to take my time and if I let you out in 10 minutes it just be 10 minutes but it won't be 10 minutes John 10:22 and it was at Jerusalem the Feast of the dedication and it was Winter and Jesus walked into the temple in Solomon's porch then came the Jews round about him he always got those Pharisees and make Believers those je Jews around about him and said unto him how long Dost thou make us to doubt if thou be the Christ tell us plainly now already we see they're already actually blaming Jesus how long does this make us to doubt Jesus never made them to doubt but he's actually saying how long you going to make us to doubt why didn't he just say well you know we don't understand can you can you exp maybe we're missing something but he said how long are you going to make us to doubt that thou be the Christ now just tell us plainly so let's just jop down to verse 30 Jesus said I and my father are one now he asked they asked tell us plainly so Jesus told him plainly you can't get any plainer than that I have my father a one so what did they do in verse 31 then then after he told him plainly the Jews took up stones again to Stone him now they said just tell us who you are he told him now they want to kill him verse 32 J Jesus answered them many good works have I showed you from my father for which of those Works do you Stone me the Jews answered him saying for good work we Stone thee not but for blasphemy and because thou being a man maketh thyself God because you're a man you make your you make yourself God uh after reading this scripture Jesus said I am my father one now I want to follow that up before I say anymore I want to follow up with this statement brother B made all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the bride now we just read this scripture Jesus said I am my father are one can can can you even begin to think maybe where we're going to if all that Christ was he reported to the bride the Pharisees didn't believe it why do you make us to doubt remember he just quoted the scripture uh does not the scripture say to you that the word of God comes to the uh to the prophets and they say they're Gods and how can you condemn me when I say I'm the Son of God that see that shows they really didn't even believe the Old Testament scriptures but you see Moses has already wrote that God said Moses you'll be a God to pharaoh and Aaron will be your Prophet so he's already said that this man Moses would be God to Pharaoh so he's already showed that that is a true scripture thou be a man makest th s God Moses was a God to Pharaoh but really when you think about it the the real mystery is not so much that that man could be God but that God become a man that's the real mystery amen so that's why we begin to see why we need Revelation revelation amen Revelation let's pray Lord Jesus thank you for the word of God it's a lamp into our feet it's a light into our path way Lord we thank you that you gave us ears to hear a heart to receive you put that seed in our heart a gene of your own person aart of your attribute of you part of you almighty God we're thankful that you gave us representation that so that we might have a a representative something to receive the word the Deep calling back to the Deep there's something something in there to respond and we're thankful for that Lord I pray that you just the notes that you've inspired me to say sitting in my office studying praying looking searching uh meditating Lord the inspiration you give me may I just deliver to the people may you do it may you deliver to the people in the inspiration you gave it to me and we'll be happy when we leave here and say did not our hearts burn within us as they talk to us along the way God may you grant it we love you thank you for this assembly in Jesus name and everybody says amen God bless each of you I want to speak if I could I'm going to title it living that word living that word and I'm going to read a quote in a minute and I'm going to show you where I actually I picked up that phrase from something brother R said it's really really outstanding now excuse me we know that brother Shawn has been you know preaching last oh three weeks or so out of uh on the subject of Revelations 18:4 come out of for my people and uh you know as he said coming brother man said there's you know two parts of redemption coming out of going into and you know that's a big statement when you think about it anybody can come out of anything and anybody can go into anything so when you really just Bol down what are you coming out of and what are you going into I mean so therefore I mean we could use all kinds of examples a Catholic could come out and be a a presbyterian you could come out of the world and be a whatever I mean just think about the young people in the message you know you you didn't come out of drugs you didn't come out of sin I mean those that really lived you know a pretty clean life it was raised in the message what did you come out of you you had to come out of something even though you was raised in the truth you had to come out of something because you was not born redeemed so what did you come out of so there had to be something I remember uh a a preacher in South uh Africa his father was a preacher I don't know I I know of the man I don't know him personally but uh when he actually came and give his heart to the Lord and truly truly uh gave his heart to the Lord and become born again he he asked his father he said you know really it's kind of like the the Rich Young Ruler you know he said I've never gone on the world I've never done this never done that he said dad he was a pastor dad what do I have to repent of and he was sincere he wasn't being arrogant he was what do I have to repent of I hadn't done anything but yes he has he born in sin shaped iniquity he had to come out of something even it was just coming out of his own personal ideas his own will his own desires his own carnality you got to come out of something and so we want to talk about a little bit to that coming out of and going into now I'm just going to what I'm going to do is just only scratch the surface but I want to kind of get to this one one point it's very very important what are we going into that's another big question there's a lots of lots of issues around the message around the message not in the message but there's a lot but we want to go on it through so I want to talk about my approach this living that word I want to talk about a word birth and you know being the word bride the token life the literal Life of Christ you know the Holy Ghost itself uh the token could only come in the evening time talking about a word birth the word being made flesh in that day uh I and you and you and he I mean all of these statements that we hear about uh what what what does some of this mean or how can we apply that or how can we achieve that or how do we need to understand what we're looking for or are we fulfilling that or are we just in our mind thinking we're fulfilling that so we want to look into that a little bit this morning so we'll read you a couple of quotes in just a moment to show you really the gravity of this subject and you know we we got to put a a lot of our denominational ey ideas you know in the in File 13 put them in the shredder or whatever because you know this message is all together different you know there's so many things that we by tradition we thought was true especially young people that you know was raised in the message you're not really aware of a lot of the issues back then and we we don't have to we're not going to go back and talk about any of that stuff because you know we're already way up the road but we want to talk about a couple of things here now in this this scripture here or this quote brother me says that why I had to be Shepherds he said I know ter he now listen this really outstanding kind of lay a foundation I know terminology of what born again is but let's just watch what happened in the Bible when they were born again Peter was a Believer the apostles were Believers but they wasn't born again till after the Holy Ghost fell on them at Pentecost remember Jesus told Peter after you're converted and strengthen Brethren he believed on Lord Jesus Christ he was Sanctified by the truth th word is truth he said now after you're converted now if he was born again he never would Deni the Lord when he got you know called on the carpet so to speak now they were wondering what happened and Peter said with the rest of them ye men of Israel this on day of Pentecost Acts 2 ye men of Israel be it known unto you Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you by signs and miracles and wonders which God did by him he who was for for known by determinate counsel you took and with Wicked hands and crucified who God raised up and were his Witnesses he shed forth this that you do see and hear now and this is according to the scriptures and then when they heard this brother man speaking and then when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said men and Brethren what can we do to be saved and Peter said unto them repent repent if we just stop right there you know and be baptized so but just repent I mean there's your there's your focus there's your fum there's the whole there's really the the foundation of the whole thing you've got to repent it's hard to believe today that Christianity being saved is either you know of course this I know this denomination but you you can kind of bring this around the message in just little different application you know that you either it's just join the church put your name on the church role just simply ask Jesus come to your heart you know or maybe you spoke in Tong once which is Nel evidence and Pentecostal church and you know we've been through all that but most Christian does not really understand the gravity of what it means to repent repent well just ask God to forgive me and and you know ask him to come in your heart and now you're saved well it's just a whole lot more than that amen so now I'm going to dramatize a little bit if I could so if if we go back to acts two and now they're coming out of the Upp room we know what happened up there and they received the Holy Ghost elix of fire the pillar fire broke itself up elix of fire rest on each of the 120 and so brother B said as the Bible says if you go back to the dialogue they spoke in other languages not just other tongues we think about tongues of what we know of the gifts of tongue but they actually spoke in other languages and we preach on I preach on it here so they were actually come out of the upper room 120 of all filled with the Holy Ghost and what were they doing they were they were coming out they were actually testifying they weren't preaching because there was women there with them marrying different ones but they were testifying what God had just done for them God had filled them wasn't anymore just God above them it's now God in them it's not God with them it's God in them so now this life this Pillar of Fire is now residing in their soul they've had a nature change they've had a desire change when they went into the upper room they were afraid when they came out of the upper room uh as brother man said one place that people was afraid of them uh it it was it was all together different something really happened in that upper room they they their their life was changed their focus was changed and then when they come out all 17 dialects that you know heard them and they were speaking Galilean but everybody heard them in their own language and it was you know uh you know all the different ones you know the parthians and mes and emites and and C cidonia and Libya and cre and Arabia and 17 I mean you we would say they the Spanish and French and German whatever they heard him in their own language what did they hear they were testifying of what happened in the other room the good works of God and so Peter stands up and then after they were listened they was amazed and some critic says you know these are drunk and they're full of new wine but Peter stands up now he was Peter was uh he was afraid before they went up there they locked the door they was afraid of the Jews but when he came out it was a different man allog together a different man and Peter stands up and he preaches that great scorching indictment to them it says therefore let all the house of Israel know ass surely that God ha made this same Jesus whom you have crucified both Lord and Christ why did he say both Lord and Christ first because in the Old Testament it was Lord God Elohim so Jesus is now the god of the Old Testament and Christ which is the anointed one be for the New Testament so God has made this Christ both Lord and Christ Jehovah of the old is Jesus of the new and we know that so that's what Peter trying to say look this man you crucified this is the Messiah this is a word this is deity this is God being made flesh he's the anointed Messiah and they and so after they heard that they screamed and they shouted out said you know what I believe I like to shake that preacher's hand I don't think that's exactly what they said you know just kind of doing a little drama there no not not at all but they said what sir what can we do to be saved there there was a there was a desperation something that something had happened something had happened to them now even even around the message you know sometimes you know we just kind of you know you you got to get baptized in Christian baptism and and in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the proper way to be baptized and you know you've got to receive the holy ghost but you know once you get baptized it you just kind of just let it go for a while but you've got to be born again being baptized and water is not being born again it's only believing unto so in verse 37 in Acts 2 in verse 37 let's follow this just a little bit and when they had heard this they were pricked in their heart they were pricked when they heard this indictment when they heard what these Upper Room people were saying they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest and Apostles men and breth what shall we do now I looked at the word pricked pricked means to pierce and it means to pain the Mind sharply so they really had a cedin headache I mean pain the Mind sharply they were pricked they weren't just like oh well this you know just no they were pricked amen and that and you know acts 9:5 say and it's notice how it's really let me just put it this way it's it's really how uh it's interesting let me put it this way when in acts 9:5 when Paul was saved and what his statements were it's really interesting how they recorded when Paul got saved and when he said who art th Lord and Jesus said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest it's hard for thee to kick against the well they were pricked in their heart and Jesus Is Telling Paul it's hard for you to kick against the Pricks wonder why he said that the same thing as they were pricked in their heart well something happened there was that there there had to be a piercing their their mind had to be sharply in pain and so their hearts were pricked and Jesus said to Paul it's really hard for you to kick against the that deep that's calling to the deep in your heart and you your heart's been pierced and your mind is is sharply in pain it's hard for you to kick against that Paul cuz you know you're you're chosen ask you know there's something happened and you know you you can't kick against that so in case you had noticed I'm already talking to you about the definition of repent well let's go through that okay now notice the very next thing what Paul said and Paul's replyed very interesting in verse six and and he listen in fact if you want to put it up on the board acts 9 and6 and he trembling and astonished said Lord what will thou have me to do the lord said it to him uh just fill out a membership card and give it to you know Gia or somebody no he didn't say that he said what he he he was trembling he was astonished Lord what will you have me to do and I looked at that word trembling triing means to fear is to be afraid and astonished means to be terrified and to be frightened I mean Paul was in a very critical desperate situation I mean he was the the Pharisee of all Pharisees I mean he was the most schooled and probably the of all Zeal he was on the top but after he saw that Pillar of Fire was struck down blinded him heard that voice and he wouldn't have called anything Lord he didn't know what he was Lord God Elohim and he said Paul said Saul Lord what can I do to be saved what must I do he was really really touched that has to do with repentance that's what we're talking about repentance somebody can say you know what I believe next week I'll just go to church get saved no you ain't going to get you uhuh no man can even call Jesus the Christ except the Holy Ghost draws him first you might want to and you might desire to you know said well but no unless God calls you first there's not going to be no true repentance until there's some Godly sorrow worketh repentance and he trembling and a ston he said Lord what would you have me to do oh I just I think that now let me ask you a question after what I've just said do do most people really understand what repentance is no no repentance really is the key to this process remember Godly sorrow worketh repentance it's essential it's mandatory there's no way around it it's it's really repentance is death might as well just say it it's absolutely just death whatever you've got to die out to whatever you got to come out of whether it be the world whether it be denomination whether it be self whether it be just your own own uh carnality or whatever it might be there's got to be a death there's got to be a dying out of your ideas yourself your motives your because we all have a carnal nature and we know that carnality is enity with God so you've got to die to your first way of life a't it strange if you just notice each of these two examples on the day of Pentecost and Paul's conversion after they heard the word preached even Saul he heard the voice of Jesus they both said what must I do and and in desperation they were willing to do anything God said just do anything and it's like brother B preached in the message doors in the door said you know some people a lot of people said now Lord I want you to come into my house but there's certain doors I just don't want you to go into I don't think Paul I don't think there's 120 other Pro I don't think they would say Lord now I I'm going to give you condition of what I'm going to get saved on what it no no no Lord what can we do to be saved I'll do anything I'll do anything and that's the way it's God to be and it's the same thing about receiving the the Holy Ghost you know people sometimes by their actions they're kind of telling God what they're willing to do that's why many don't receive the Holy Ghost when they get baptized even though they're seed they will sometime but when go God can look down to them and they're going to get the Holy Ghost at some point because said no you're not ready yet you're just not ready yet true yeah that's true now I was told you I was going to read you a couple of quotes this quote don't never let this go put this one on the refrigerator put it on your hat brim or whatever put it everywhere it's out of layout of sin Church AE Church age book brother B said now then there will not be one person who will sit in the Throne of the Lord Jesus Christ unless unless he has been living that word that's where I got my title for living that word there will not be one person who will sit in the Throne of the Lord Jesus Christ unless he has been living that word so we see the criteria already if we're going to be bride we're going to be in the new city we got to live that word no questions asked and then brother Ram goes on to say he say your prayers your fastings your repentances plural your repentances and it's strange the way he said that no matter what you present to God none of that will gain you the privilege of sitting in that Throne it will be granted to the word Bride As The Throne of the king is shared with the queen because she is United to him so only they that only they who are of that word the message are our present day truth of that word word even as he is of that word will share that Throne that's such a dynamic quote we're going to make it to heaven we got to be living that word no ex no exemptions but he said your prayers your fasting your repentances you're this you're that you're this you you you what you did what you give to God what you're say Lord I'll give you this but not that it's not about you it's about a total surrender you got to get you out of the way we got to get us out of the way that's what repentance is all about it's all about why he just said all your repentances well that can only mean one thing there too much insincerity if you got to make all these repentances there's some insincerity somewhere true true 2 Corinthians 710 for Godly sorrow worketh repentance Godly sorrow why do you why do we repent anyway why what is the purpose of repenting God I am sorry I this life that I'm living I am tired of this life I want to turn around I don't want this life anymore I'm I'm I'm finished with this it's it this it this is this is as far as I'm going kind of get tickle sometime when I think about losing weight people losing weight I mean I I I I I want I didn't want to get big you know and I I kept getting on the scales and I was going up this was a couple years ago and I got up to 180 185 190 195 196 197 198 199 I got on the scales one Sunday morning 200 that's it that's it no more that's it that's where I drew the line I mean you know you got to draw the line somewhere I don't want this life anymore I don't want to live this way anymore when you're in the center world that's where I'm drawing the line I drove it to 200 down to 184 but I have I ain't going up there just you know just an example there unless he has been living that word that's why he says your prayers your fasting your repentances all this nothing you can do you die when you repent you must die and when you die listen when you die in the natural what happens when you die in the natural The Undertaker takes over when you die in the spiritual the upt taker takes over got to be one or the other you know same the natural types of spiritual you got to die and let the let the upt taker which is Christ the word he's got to take over no other way now that's that's a sobering thought unless we have been living that word we're not going to share that throne with the Lord Jesus Christ that princip principle has got to be evident to really have the Holy Ghost amen I'm going to read again there will not be one person who will sit in the Throne of the Lord Jesus Christ unless he has been living that word he didn't say just I believe the message he didn't say just I believe God said a prophet he said living that word and there a reason he said that and this is a reason Satan can impersonate anything he can impersonate gifts he can mimic gifts he can you know he can impersonate shouting dancing speaking in tongu Sensations prophecy dreams uh even attending the message Church even preaching the message I mean we've seen preachers that believe that preach this message didn't have the Holy Ghost you can be a preacher and still not the Holy Ghost so sat can impersonate any of that but there's one thing Satan cannot do he cannot live that life he cannot live the life he cannot believe every word and it takes that and it takes Christ he cannot live that life so Satan cannot live the word he cannot truly receive the truth he truly cannot live that lifee he can't manifest that lie he can't obey the truth he just cannot do it he can't do it amen and that's just reason why we must receive the Holy Ghost and why we must have that token life why we must come out of whatever we come out of we got to come out Babylon World lukewarmness whatever but we got to come into present day truth the Holy Ghost himself now this this this uh quote that I'm going to read you next this is a stinger and it's question answer 1964 right down at the end somebody asked brother Rand a question brother brandom is it possible now listen to this is it possible for a person to be lost and end up in hell if he rejects the light of the word even though he has a genuine experience of justification and sanctification brother man said yes sir that's exactly right wow then you think about brother B said well you say I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother man said that don't mean you got saved you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day on your of your life on your spirit realm and die and be lost Peter was justified he was Sanctified but he did not have the Holy Ghost he did not get converted until he went to Pentecost and got the Holy Ghost that's why it's so essential mandatory absolute must you must be born again so it's a dangerous thing to to stay and linger in a long time in just a Justified and Sanctified State you've got to go all the way to the New Birth nature change true oh amen just remember there's two parts of redemption coming out of going into and think about it two million come out of Egypt two persons went into the promised land wow leaving Egypt was a great dis actually leaving Egypt was the greatest display of miracles in the entire Old Testament hands down of all the 10 plagues the Miracles the death of the firstborn the departing of the Red Sea that was the greatest display of Miracles anywhere recorded in the Old Testament and only two out of that two million made it and they saw all that they saw the hand of God fed him in the wilderness it's just it's just more that sometimes I can I can understand but it's still happened it's still true two two only two went in remember listen when Jesus was in it now I want to kind of do a little encourage here might dramatize a little bit on this but um it's not really drama but uh when Jesus in his greatest Temptation and we all have it and don't miss this Satan came to Jesus with the word with the word although it was a misplace word it was yet nonetheless it was the word Satan quoted Jesus the word but it was misplaced but it was the word so to me some of the greatest words in the Bible is when Jesus spoke was this it is also [Laughter] written I just I just love that Satan might quote the word but when he quotes the word most if he quotes it it's going to be misplaced because he's using it for some way to catch you but then it's also written so when Satan comes to you you just say Satan it's also written true and Satan comes to you and says you know what there's only two out of two million made it and then he might even quote you out of where it says you know in the days of Noah the long suffering so forth of there was only eight Souls saved now many millions only eight was made it so he might he might come to you and say those things said you know what there's there's going to be some Sav but you're not going to be one cuz there's just so few just two or three going to make it so ain't no need for you to try you know what I'm going to tell Satan it's also written and I might just say it this way I'll just take Satan Ephesians 1 and4 and I'll say Satan it's also written according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love did you get that devil I know he's listening to me right now and I say Satan is also written having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will and is also written having made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself and listen to this Satan is also written in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will I don't care if there's just one come out of Virginia that's me so you better move because I'm going to make it it's also written and I might just say also this when you're down or maybe partially down or maybe you're really down or maybe you're just going through a hard time just say Satan it's also written in whom ye also trust I just love this scripture Ephesians 1:13 in whom ye also trusted after because this scripture right here proves that you can be justified and Sanctified this Ephesians 1:13 Justified and Sanctified but you as as it was said in Acts 19 and5 have you received the Holy Ghost since you have believed not when you believe like Baptist but since you have believed here's another scripture that proves this in whom ye also trusted after you heard the word of truth that's a type of justification the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believe that's the type of sanctification after you believe ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise after you did this and after you did that then you were sealed and he didn't say you might be se you were sealed I say Satan I put that in your pipe and smoke it and it's also written which is the earnest of our inheritance unto the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory you can't give Satan an inch he'll try to take a mile sure he will then if you look at Romans 8 and 30 the first word there says moreover and I'm going to say Satan do you know what that word moreover means that means add to means also means yay it means plus it means added to so moreover it's also written moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he has Justified they've already entered into Glory potentially now what do you think about that devil when you get down just just say Satan it's also written we know where we [Music] are they said Jesus they said to Jesus tell us plainly are you the Christ or not s says tell us plainly are you bride tell us plainly who are you you think you believe you think you're one of them you think you're going in the Rapture you think you believe the only message is the rapture message that's that's me amen that's me I don't care what the devil say that's me I believe it I know it's true I like that more over then in Romans 8:31 what shall we say then to these things if God be for us who can be against it and IID say Satan that who is you who can be against it even you can be against me but who can lay anything to our charge if God be for us who could be against us who shall separate us from the love of Christ of tribulation distress persecution famin or nakedness or Peril or sword 37 it's also written nay and all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us look at look look at Romans 9:13 let's put that one up there Romans 9:13 Satan it's also written as it is written Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated now we're not a type of Esau we're a type of a type of Jacob now Mary was highly favored and because she was highly favored she also be the type of the Bride the bride is highly favored so Satan as it is written Jacob have I the bride have I loved and the unbelievers when you say hates God don't hate anybody but does he hat he does not love Satan's Children one one rendering was that he just loves less but uh Satan does have his children we know that God has his children amen for he said to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will mercy and I will have compassion on on whom I will have compassion wherefore remember that ye being in time past Gentiles In the Flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hand now these next two script this is one of my favorite scriptures in the Bible Ephesians 2 and2 and 2 and13 I just love this that at that time this is Gentiles what we were before Ephesians 2:12 that at that time Ye Ye number one you were without Christ Gentiles dogs no bodies if if I could take a about and I won't I won't take any time to say it but if you realize what Gentiles were in the two Testament in times of the Jews the Gentiles were nothing they could I mean they didn't have any place in the in the temple they could go into the outer Court they could do this but I mean Gentiles were just nothing outcast at from at that at that time ye were without Christ number one number two being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel number three strangers from the covenants of promise you're not even in the Covenant and like uh like U the Philistine Giant Goliath why why did David say you know why you know you you've come to us you know with a sword and the spirit I come to you in the name of the Lord and why had you let this uncircumcised Philistine defy the armies of the Living God why did he say uncircumcised Philistine because the Philistines were not in the Covenant only the Jewish race was in the Covenant so those that's in the Covenant God would fight for those that's in the Covenant so this guy's out of the covenant What Saul what are you guys worried about this guy's not even in the Covenant so even We Were Strangers from the Covenant of promise and number four having no hope and number five without God in this world we as Gentiles we was in sad shape we was in pitiful shape but the next scripture I like to I'd like to just let Satan read this Satan read that to me but now but now in Christ Jesus whom ye sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ made nigh by you were you were sometimes a far off but now you're made nigh by the blood of Christ the way you think about them apples marar you know way you think about that it's also written verse 19 now therefore you are no more strangers and foreign No More Strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints of the household of God oh my how how we ought to just love him but remember now all that I've said thus for all that I've said it takes faith it takes Faith to come out of true it takes Faith to go into and faith is a revelation it takes a revelation to come out of whatever you're coming out of doesn't matter if you was raised in the message you got to come out of something to be born again and you can only be brother man said you can only be saved by Revelation and as we said earlier Satan can impersonate or mimic any gift but he can't live that life you know what I can't live it either and you know what you can't live it either but there is one that is sufficient he can live it and that's why he must he must dwell in the human heart Christ has to take up residence in the human heart because that's the only way we can be Overcomers he must abide in Us by the new birth so obviously we must have that token Al we must have a word birth we must have met that Pillar of Fire we must meet the person of the word and it is now possible because of the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost himself he is here he is here he is here with us I'll never forget that time years ago when we was going up visit brother Spencer he Liv up on up on Pilot Road up there and it's you go across the the bridge there the the Church of Christ right as you across Interstate there of course I was raised Church of Christ brother man said they just modern Pharisees they don't believe nothing especially no moving of the spirit no days of Miracles has passed and we speak where the Bible speaks s what that's that's all Church of Christ Doctrine anyway so they had a sign up on Easter and it's the only thing only thing that I could really say Amen to that they said was right their sign said on Easter morning said he is not here he has risen I said amen he is not here you're right no he's not here I said a when I pass I said amen that's nothing but the truth he is not here he is risen and he's risen far out of that [Laughter] because you you you you know the days of Luther that's fine but it won't work today the days of of Wesley that's fine but it won't work today the days of Pentecost that's fine but it won't work today brother said in visible Union the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work today that was reper again in Pentecost he said we've got something newer amen we've got to come into the Promised word that's the only way we're going to be able to live that life amen it is possible now he's here so when the Holy Ghost comes into the human heart by the baptism of the Holy Ghost into your soul then you are as he said don't never let this get away from you you're tabernacling deity you are tabernacling deity Jesus was the fullness of the godhead bod he was deity he was Tabernacle and deity God in hand they could not see it they couldn't understand it they had no uh record of it where he went to school where did he come from it didn't look like a prophet he didn't look like a king he didn't look like anything great who is this man but he was God why did Brother Bram say the Capstone Revelation for this hour is the Supreme deity of the Lord Jesus Christ you must believe that so therefore you must believe that so therefore to me what is the Capstone Revelation current concerning you that deity now dwells in your flesh if the Capstone revation Revelation for the church is the Supreme deity of the Lord Jesus Christ then what would be the Capstone Revelation for you you've got to believe that that same deity is residing in your heart after you've been born again let me quote you a couple of tremendous quotes here brother man said and Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the at the coming of the son of man deity veiled again in human flesh now what do you think about that devil it's also [Music] written I I'm just from now on I'm gonna say Satan it's also written it's also written it's also written here's another one brother man says deity it fell on the day of pente because it's still falling another place brother B talking about you know dancing in the spirit Shou speaking the tongues all them sensation he says and he's praying he said oh God let the Holy Spirit bring it to our hearts of the people now to know that those things all them Sensations those things don't count they don't count they don't count for nothing those things don't count it's tabernacling deity God in our hearts another place he says there you are what is it deity being identified in man now the same thing is today that deity and not and notice what he said this is so tremendous notice the same thing is today that deity comma the promised word for this day comma can identify itself in you so he's so the word is Christ Christ is the word so he's even saying this promised word for the day this word is deity because the word is Christ and Christ is deity so that deity the promised word for this day can be identified itself in you that word is Christ and that is deity the promised word for this hour brother we've been given a tremendous thing what we've been given thisday it's it surpasses everything there's there's nothing to match it oh man I just love him couple comments here when you receive the Holy Ghost you will know your desires has changed your focus is going to change your attitude changed your life has changed you'll start living that word start living that word brother man says is your life worthy of the Gospel when this takes place the thing you'll do then you'll find out that the spirit that comes in you from the New Birth you will believe and do everything that God says in his word for you to do oh my you will believe and do amen will you do it the first day probably not but you will do it somehow God's going to bring you to it he's going to bring us to it CU we he is going to have a bride she's going to be without spot wrinkle BL is this flesh going to be perfect no sir no sir but your desire and your whole makeup and focus is I am going to live that word what he said for me to do whatever it takes what can I do to be saved whatever he said that's what I want to do that's got to be the attitude of the believer whatever what can I do and he told us what to do and everything that that Bible quotes for you to do you'll punctuate it with an amen and you'll not not stop day and night until you receive it that's right that's right and and in all this time you'll certainly above everything bear the fruit of the spirit I don't have it wrote down here but there's a tremendous quote I always go back to it all the time brother B said when you receive the Holy Ghost you may shout you may not you may dance you may not you may speak in tongues you may not but there's one thing it will you will do you will bear the Fruit of the Spirit and the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering Temperance patience Meeks Faith you will bear the fruit of the spirit why because that's the nature of Christ and what is the token the literal Life of Christ when you get the token you're taking on his nature his life his character his demeanor his Focus everything that's it it's the literal life of Jesus Christ that's why that's why it says broad is the way and few be that find it but Narrows a way I mean and many that find go that way but Narrows way that few be that find that it's just only for it's only for as he said in church age Book for a selected uh prophetic group that can believe the word for this hour oh it's just it's just it's just so wonderful remember again Satan cannot live that word neither can any human in itself but by that token in you that literal Life of Christ when that Life of Christ comes in you there will be a showing of life when the Life of Christ come to you there's going to be showing of Life remember Mary when she received that word was it long there was showing of Life in Her it became manifest I think about even Aaron and his Rod remember there was a dispute one time over the priesthood and all 12 PR tribes you know they wanted the priesthood so God said okay we'll settle this so each one of them had a rod each one of the leaders so you take your rods you take your rods and put him into a pres of the sh kind of Glory now in the outer Court nothing happened no showing of life in the inner Court nothing happened no showing of life but you put them rods in the Pres just kind of Glory the next day the mom Rod Aaron's Rod anyway was R Rod it buted and brought forth fruit in the presence of the sh of Glory so when you come into the presence of God there is going to be a showing of life because there been a nature change because the life that that that stick Aaron's robod was just an old Dead stick a dead stick but in the presence of that Shak Glory it became life and mded and bear bore almonds so there's going to be a showing of life so that's why I'm saying how how do we know well I believe the mess well what kind of Life have you living it's that's why brother B said living the life living that word only one's going to make it in living that word so that that chosen rod in the presence of sh kind of Glory that the next day that surely was a showing of life so we say well how do we accomplish this maturing of the word well let's just look at it this way I like that scripture I don't have in front of me it says uh be not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind I love that scripture scripture is very very powerful be you transformed by the renewing of your mind the word renewing actually means a renovation when you renovate a house what do you do you take out all the junk the old stuff you put in new stuff that's renovation your mind especially if he out in the world and so forth you got you list of this you got images you've got pictures you've got curse words You' got this you got that and even if you're not you still got to come out of something even if you raised in the message your own ideas your own thoughts your carnality whatever I don't care how good a person you were you still got to be born again so you still have to renew your mind how do you renew your mind what I thought about it the other day there's a good way good illustration I'm going to think I'm bring it to it's a gradual process it don't happen overnight but how do you do it well you take a paint brush you paint you get paint in the brush then you got to clean that brush you got paint in it everybody knows about cleaning a paintbrush don't we anybody never painted if you never painted if you've never painted you never painted raise your hand never painted okay okay we've all painted okay so how do you clean a prank brush you got to get that paint out and get it clean again well you got to take clean water the way I clean my paint brushes I'll take a MacDonald's cup and I'll let the hot water run into the cup and I'll dip it in dip it out and you keep bushing like that turn out the old water and then I'll have clean water in it keep it fill it up and I'll be just punching the brush up and down up and down dump it out and do that about 18 20 times like that and finally you start getting it pretty pretty clean then you take a wire brush you put it on the glass bowl turn upside down take that wire brush to scrape all the excess off of it get it cleaned up real good but how do you do it there got to be a process you got to get it at all the old paint out and get the fresh water in and the way that we get come to maturity is by the washing of the Water by the word there's got to be a washing effect even the the priesthood had to be washed by the prophet before they could come into the the sanctuary of the temple there's got to be a washing of the Water by the word we got to wash all the dirty paint out of the paintbrush we need to get all that stuff out of our mind and that's the only way to do by the washing of the Water by the word couple more quotes let you go brother man said what is attraction on the mountain talk about that cloud I just love it people don't sometimes people don't realize what has happened this generation first Exodus we had a pillar of fire pillar of cloud second Exodus there was a pillar of fire pillar of cloud Third Exodus this is our day Pillar of Fire pillar of cloud we had it it's here brother man says what is the attration on the mountain and the other day standing there turn the picture to the right and there is Jesus Jesus as he was in the seven Church ages that cloud there that's him the wig one he came down supernaturally picture taken they can't explain it we know what it is the white wig one showing Supreme deity Alpha and Omega he's the first and last he Supreme deity judge of all eternity standing there confirm the message of the hour there should be light in the evening time here's another quote token Bakersfield and when we can display the token of the Holy Spirit shows that we have been accepted in Christ you realize in the Old Testament why Abraham was given a seal of circumcision it was given he was given a seal of circumcision that God had accept had accepted his faith same thing they we don't have a natural circumcision but we have a spiritual circumcision and we're spiritually Born Into the kingdom of God God accepts our faith and gives us a spiritual seal of circumcision that he has accepted our faith so when we can display the token of the holy spirit that shows that uh that we have been accepted in Christ and that our token and that I that and that is our token that all that we have need of is already purchased by him we are identified with our token he goes on to say here's some the tremendous quote full obedience to the full word of God entitles you to the amen full obedience how important is this new birth how important if you have the new birth we're going to live that life we're going to be the The Living Word we are going to live the word full obedience to the word of God entitles you to the Token no other way is there that you could ever be entitled to the Token until you fully obey the word praise the Lord fully obey that's it's you know I I hate even say it because but it's the truth brother B said when in Acts 238 repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost theoretically you you you should be able to receive the Holy Ghost the the very minute you get baptized in water it is possible it most of the time it don't happen because most of the time people are just not ready to die even though they're sincere they've done all they know to do at that point but just not time yet amen just not time yet for whatever reason and we I preached the whole message on that but brother M explains why you know he's just not ready yet just not ready yet right full obedience to the full word of God entitles you to the Token no other way it is there you could that you could ever be entitled to the Token until you fully obey the word even the book of Acts says God gave the Holy Ghost to them that obey that's what it says in the book of Acts and I like this visible Union while the musicians are coming now this one I like this and I try to quote to Satan Satan it's written well the the prophet of God said that but that inspiration come from almighty God he said you are standing completely you never sin in the first place you ever ask yourself what was the first place what was the first place wasn't the first place when you were born the first place was like Adam Adam before the at the before the fall there was no sin at all you never Sinn in the first place like it was in the Garden of Eden you never sinned in the first place God don't even know it's in the sea of forgivness you never did it but Satan said you did but I said it's written he said I never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning from the beginning you were predestinated to be a Son of God and a daughter of God and you're standing there washed and your old book of divorcement is put away it's dead absolutely out of the existence even in the mind of God oh man I mean he's making a declaration what you are the prophet said it's more important to believe what the word says you are than what you think you are yourself you are The Virtuous bride of Christ washed in the blood of Christ precious virtuous sinless Son of God standing there with a pure unadulterated bride word that he Washed by the Water of his I don't know how I can make it any pler I mean you know I mean I don't know how I can make it any plainer that become flesh and manifested that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was that he might make you the same as he he was that he may might make you the same as he was Jesus told them tell us plainly who you are said I am the father of one then they took up stones and ston him but he told them plainly who I am I Ain the father one who are you I Ain the father one I and you you and me we got to have that Revelation it's not an arrogancy it's not a a uh holier than thou has nothing to do with it but friends we cannot Pastor say well you know I just I don't I I don't deserve it but I just don't know you better know claim it don't claim it if you're not worthy claim it when I mean worthy if you haven't met the requirements I'm not talking about your flesh I'm talking about meeting those requirements you met the requirements you claim it and it's all by faith when God called Abraham called him out of there CIS just an idolor told him where to go give him a land to go to and everything [Music] God gave him the faith to be able to do that then turned around and gave him credit for having that faith and God's the one that gave him the faith where does your faith come from come from almighty God by just isn't it beautiful it is beautiful where's Daniel at he's going to come sing us a song now I save this quote the best quotes for last we talk we have talked about coming out of going into and I found this quote I said this is a this is a Capstone quote for the even for the morning you want me to read it now you want me to bring it next week anybody want now you want it now you sure no I I just you sure things that are to be real out to 1965 this is
