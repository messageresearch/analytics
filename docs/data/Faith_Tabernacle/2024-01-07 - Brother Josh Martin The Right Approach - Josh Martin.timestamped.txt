[41:06] Josh had uh uh text me the other day
[41:10] saiding they're going to be here for the

[43:26] for us to pray for him and and his
[43:28] congregation and and so we want to we
[43:31] want to do that uh you know God's got a
[43:33] bride around the
[43:35] world uh and that believes this message
[43:38] and I you know just told him I saluted
[43:41] him for just standing true to the to the
[43:44] message of the hour and uh people need
[43:48] it no matter what language no matter
[43:50] what country and and uh we we still have
[43:53] our liberties to to Proclaim CL the
[43:56] gospel and uh without fear and uh but
[43:59] other countries don't have that
[44:01] privilege and U that we uh certainly uh
[44:05] want to keep him in our prayer and his
[44:08] church but uh before I called brother
[44:10] Josh uh out I I this quote was sent on a
[44:15] chat uh I think this morning and I I I
[44:19] thought it uh just I enjoyed it I
[44:22] thought I'd read it to you today but he
[44:24] said uh brother Brown said the reason re
[44:26] that you was saved so easier sometimes
[44:29] than you are healed he said is because
[44:32] you was elected before the foundation of
[44:34] the world and your name was put in the
[44:36] Lamb's Book of Life and that strain as a
[44:40] son and daughter of God still holds on
[44:45] you amen aren't you glad for that amen
[44:50] and and and so I I thought that was
[44:53] pretty just thank God for a prophet to
[44:56] to let us know these things and uh you
[44:59] may be struggling in your health but I'm
[45:02] so glad that we're not struggling in our
[45:05] soul amen that God drawed us to him and
[45:10] we're so thankful for that amen let's

[45:16] song it's an old song I guess was y'all

[49:26] day when all the trials are over with
[49:29] all the heartaches we'll step on the
[49:31] other side what a day that will be amen
[49:34] amen if you have your Bibles I got two
[49:37] portions of scripture Isaiah 53 And1 and
[49:40] Matthew 11 and 25 like to say it's an
[49:43] honor to be here this morning um I
[49:46] wasn't planning on preaching or wanting
[49:48] to preach I was hoping to hear Uncle
[49:49] Sean but here we are I pray something
[49:52] can be said to be a blessing amen do you
[49:54] love the Lord this morning morning
[49:57] amen Isaiah 53 And1 who hath believed
[50:01] our report and to whom is the arm of the
[50:04] Lord revealed and Matthew
[50:08] 11:25 Jesus would say at that time Jesus
[50:10] answered and said I thank thee oh Father
[50:13] Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou
[50:15] has hid these things from the wise and
[50:17] prudent and has revealed them unto babes
[50:20] even so father for so it seem good in
[50:23] thy sight amen you're thankful for that
[50:25] can we bow our heads this morning dear
[50:27] gracious Heavenly Father Lord what an
[50:29] honor and a privilege it is to come Lord
[50:32] before your throne and into your to your
[50:34] house Lord to worship your name father
[50:36] Lord as we've sang songs of worship
[50:38] father we've we've did our best Lord to
[50:41] create the atmosphere for you to feel
[50:42] welcome in Lord God we ask that you
[50:44] would walk the aisles this morning Lord
[50:46] only you can meet the needs and touch
[50:48] the hearts father Lord As I Lay myself
[50:51] aside I ask that you would speak through
[50:52] these lips of clay Lord God we lay their
[50:55] service into your hands in Jesus name
[50:57] amen you may be seated and if I had a a
[51:01] subject this morning it would be the
[51:03] right approach and um a lot of what I'm
[51:06] going to be ministering on is coming out
[51:09] of the the message God hiding himself in
[51:11] Simplicity and revealing himself the
[51:13] same he preached it twice once before
[51:15] the seals and once after the seals so
[51:17] those are powerful messages but brother
[51:19] brandham would say catch those two
[51:21] scriptures who hath believed our report
[51:24] and to whom is the army of the Lord
[51:26] revealed and even then Jesus thanked God
[51:28] that he hid the mysteries from the wise
[51:31] and The Prudent and would reveal them
[51:33] reveal it to babes such as would learn
[51:36] and so God hid the mysteries from one
[51:38] group but is going to reveal it to
[51:40] somebody that is willing to learn but
[51:42] brother Brandon would also say after he
[51:44] reads the Isaiah 53 And1 he would say if
[51:47] you believe the report then the arm of
[51:49] the Lord is revealed so the strength of
[51:52] the Lord or the power of the Lord is
[51:54] always operating by believing the report
[51:56] so by having faith in the report is
[51:59] going to open up the supernatural where
[52:01] we can see the impossibility but first
[52:04] we got to be willing to be taught we got
[52:06] to be willing to be to lay aside what we
[52:08] know and be willing to learn you see if
[52:10] somebody knows it all they're never
[52:12] going to be taught you know I'm an
[52:14] electrician and you have stages growing
[52:16] as you learn electricity uh you have an
[52:18] apprentice than a journalen than a than
[52:20] a contractor but you don't become a
[52:22] contractor right away without being
[52:24] first an apprentice and you can't become
[52:27] a gernan without being an apprentice so
[52:29] you start at the bottom level and you
[52:31] work your way up you got to be taught
[52:34] you got to come to a journ and say hey I
[52:36] don't know everything teach me the ways
[52:38] and as you're willing to be taught
[52:40] you're learning the power of electricity
[52:43] and I think that's the way it is with
[52:44] the word of God we don't know it all but
[52:46] we got to be willing to be taught and
[52:48] once we're taught by the word of God
[52:51] then the supernatural starts to open up
[52:53] or we can see the possibilities but
[52:56] brother Brandon would say then when we
[52:58] come sanely sound to God when we come
[53:00] without malice any Prejudice with an
[53:03] open heart willing to learn God's able
[53:06] to teach when we're willing to learn but
[53:08] we first must lay aside tradition lay
[53:11] aside ideas what we've been taught now I
[53:13] know mother taught you these things that
[53:15] was very good and so forth but sometimes
[53:18] mothers has things wrong and I think my
[53:21] sometimes parents might have things
[53:23] wrong the pastor sometimes might have
[53:25] things wrong but there's one thing
[53:27] that's never going to be wrong that is
[53:29] the word of God that is something we can
[53:31] anchor our life upon our belief system
[53:34] what we go on is the word of God you
[53:37] know I was listening to brother Brandon
[53:38] preached the message the voice of God in
[53:40] the last days and he goes through many
[53:43] voices he goes through Hollywood he goes
[53:45] through politics he goes through a wife
[53:47] he said Eve or Adam listen to the voice
[53:49] of Eve instead of the voice of God and
[53:51] he's going through those voices and then
[53:53] he says don't pattern your yourself
[53:55] after those voices listen to what the
[53:58] voice of God says and I thought my even
[54:01] though there's other opinions other
[54:03] influences we still got a voice that is
[54:06] the absolute we still got a voice that
[54:08] we can line our life up in every
[54:10] situation and every in everything we go
[54:13] through we still got a voice we can obey
[54:16] you see we're living in a day of
[54:17] information we have Google we have Siri
[54:20] we have YouTube we have everything if
[54:22] you want to learn something we have
[54:24] something that at our disposal where we
[54:26] can learn but Isaiah is telling us in
[54:29] order to see the results in order to see
[54:32] the supernatural you have to be taught
[54:34] by one thing Google's not going to teach
[54:36] you about it the YouTube ain't going to
[54:38] teach you about it but the report of the
[54:41] Lord will teach you the supernatural he
[54:43] will show you the Supernatural and Luke
[54:46] 1: 152 would say he put down the mighty
[54:49] from their seats and exalted them of low
[54:52] degree and I just love that scripture
[54:54] because I I'm not too very smart I'm not
[54:56] too very intelligent but this gives a
[54:58] promise you don't got to be smart to be
[55:01] exalted but if a man is trying to exalt
[55:03] himself he's going to be brought down by
[55:06] them of low degree it's not that God
[55:08] won't exalt smart people he won't exalt
[55:11] arrogant people he's looking for
[55:13] somebody that's humble because even dumb
[55:15] people can be arrogant you know they
[55:17] they they can be so dumb that they
[55:19] become arrogant but somebody that's
[55:21] humble enough to say Lord exalt me by
[55:24] your word that I can see the results I
[55:27] want to see the message come off the
[55:28] tapes and in my life I want to see the
[55:31] message in my church I want to see the
[55:33] message performing the signs in my life
[55:36] you see I I think too many times you
[55:39] know as I've grown up in the message I
[55:40] put things back in the past it was just
[55:42] for brother Brandon I remember being a
[55:44] teenager thinking if I got sick if I
[55:47] could just get in front of brother
[55:48] Brandon he could discern my life he he
[55:50] could proclaim a promise over my life
[55:52] but the same God the same superal
[55:55] natural is walking the AIS just like he
[55:57] did whenever he was with brother Brandon
[55:59] back in the 60s and 50s and 40s it's the
[56:02] same God today the same Supernatural if
[56:06] we're willing to Humble oursel to it you
[56:08] see Jesus would talk about the two that
[56:11] would go to pray one was a Pharisee and
[56:13] the other was a Publican and in Luke 18
[56:16] and11 the Pharisees stood and prayed
[56:19] thus with himself God I thank thee that
[56:22] I'm not as other men exorts unjust
[56:25] adulterers even as this Publican I fast
[56:28] twice a week I give tithe on all that I
[56:31] possess and then the and the 13th verse
[56:33] he says and the Publican standing of far
[56:36] off would not lift up his head would not
[56:38] lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven
[56:41] but smoted his breath saying God be
[56:44] merciful to me a sinner and I tell you
[56:47] this this man went down to his house
[56:49] Justified rather than the other for
[56:52] everyone that exalteth himself shall be
[56:55] abased but he that humble himself shall
[56:58] be exalted so God wouldn't even hear the
[57:01] man's prayer that was prideful but the
[57:04] man that had nothing to offer the man
[57:06] that had nothing to give the man that
[57:08] had had nothing to his name but he was
[57:11] willing to Humble himself and then God
[57:13] would hear his prayer God will exalt him
[57:15] and I say you don't have to know
[57:17] everything you don't got to know all the
[57:19] message if you're willing to humble
[57:21] yourself to it and say whatever this
[57:23] report says I believe whatever it says
[57:26] concerning my family my marriage my life
[57:28] I'm going to humble myself to it and
[57:31] watch God exalt a family watch God exalt
[57:34] a marriage watch God exalt a church like
[57:37] never before you see God is wanting a
[57:39] body on Earth that's exalted not in
[57:42] smarts not in education but exalted by
[57:44] the supernatural oh Hallelujah brother
[57:47] Brandon would say you know people want
[57:49] power and really don't know what power
[57:52] is they really don't know what goes with
[57:54] it the way up is always down if you want
[57:57] Power see how humble you can get just
[58:00] get away from all your worldly thinking
[58:02] and humble yourself before God and I
[58:05] think this is that that's what this
[58:07] message come to do is humble ourself so
[58:10] we can see what the word really is about
[58:12] you remember brother brandom tells the
[58:14] story of John spro he was a preacher and
[58:16] he was overseas and he seen he was
[58:18] walking through a garden I believe and
[58:20] he seen a statue of Christ he was on the
[58:23] cross and he was criticizing ing the
[58:25] statue because it showed no suffering it
[58:27] showed no pain it showed no Authority
[58:30] and there was a guide that was behind
[58:32] him and he says sir I'm assuming you're
[58:35] criticizing the statue he says yes sir I
[58:38] am I see no power I see no I see no
[58:41] suffering and the man says you're
[58:42] looking at up the wrong way you got to
[58:45] look at up the right way and what did
[58:47] that guy do it leted him to humility you
[58:50] see that guide wasn't there to talk
[58:52] about what he at for breakfast or talk
[58:54] about what he had achieved the guide had
[58:57] one responsibility and that was to lead
[59:00] them to humility and what happens that
[59:03] brother brandom says he led them to an
[59:04] altar it says if you kneel down and look
[59:07] up to it you will see the power of it
[59:10] and John spr knelt down at the altar and
[59:13] looked up to that statue and he seen so
[59:16] much suffering that he started to cry
[59:18] his heart started to break what was it
[59:21] he looked through humility and then seen
[59:23] the power of it oh Hallelujah this the
[59:26] message ain't ain't a dead letter it has
[59:28] a power behind it it has a supernatural
[59:31] behind it if you can just humble
[59:33] yourself to it oh Hallelujah and watch
[59:36] it exalt itself or watch it exalt
[59:38] yourself you see brother Brandon would
[59:40] say it's not you exalting yourself it's
[59:43] God himself exalting you oh Hallelujah
[59:47] brother brandom talks about Jesus he
[59:49] says God so so Elevate him till he he
[59:53] become the highest of the heights he
[59:55] says look at Jesus nothing but one
[59:58] bundle of Love see he was God manifested
[1:00:01] God expressing himself through him and
[1:00:04] catch this part no wonder Miracles and
[1:00:07] things happen his humble life and
[1:00:09] consecrated life to come from being God
[1:00:12] to be a man here on Earth to express God
[1:00:16] through himself he says no wonder
[1:00:18] miracles happen no wonder these things
[1:00:21] happen cuz he humbled himself so much to
[1:00:24] express God you know brother wend my
[1:00:27] pastor said a statement the other day he
[1:00:29] says God becomes so much a human that
[1:00:32] the humans didn't recognize him as God
[1:00:35] and I thought my that's a profound
[1:00:36] statement God becomes so humble becomes
[1:00:39] so low that nobody recognized him as God
[1:00:43] why he wanted to exalt a people that can
[1:00:46] sit in Heavenly places if they could
[1:00:49] humble themselves just like he has
[1:00:51] humbled himself you see brother Brandon
[1:00:54] would say show me a church that's humble
[1:00:56] real humble not arrogancy a church just
[1:00:59] sweet a humble church I'll show you a
[1:01:01] church that has the favor and power of
[1:01:04] God in it that's right that's the thing
[1:01:06] it takes humility humbling yourself
[1:01:09] before God and letting God just work
[1:01:12] through us oh my so like I said a few
[1:01:15] minutes earlier seeing the arm of the
[1:01:17] Lord comes down to believing the report
[1:01:20] and so the the approach of it has to be
[1:01:23] the right way you know brother brandom
[1:01:25] says you can't read the Bible like a
[1:01:26] newspaper he says it won't be learned
[1:01:28] like a newspaper brother brandom says
[1:01:30] you need to get down look up saying Lord
[1:01:33] Give Me Faith to believe your word and
[1:01:35] so brother brandom he would say this
[1:01:38] here uh but and I've seen great things
[1:01:41] that the Lord has done but I always
[1:01:43] notice that it takes people that will
[1:01:45] humble themselves lay aside their own
[1:01:48] thoughts of it and just take God's
[1:01:50] thought of it and work according to his
[1:01:52] plan which is Faith in what he said and
[1:01:56] so faith and humility work hand in hand
[1:01:59] so once you get down in humility then
[1:02:02] you're able to believe what God says you
[1:02:04] see if you're smarter than the word of
[1:02:06] God you're never going to believe it if
[1:02:08] you know more than the word of God
[1:02:10] you're never going to believe it that's
[1:02:11] where many people stand with the message
[1:02:13] of the hour they have their own
[1:02:15] Revelations they have their own ideas
[1:02:17] and since they have that they can't
[1:02:19] submit themselves to it but somebody
[1:02:22] that is willing to submit themselves to
[1:02:24] it humility and faith will work hand in
[1:02:27] hand because it's only through faith
[1:02:29] that we can see the power of God brother
[1:02:32] Brandon would say we are becoming a
[1:02:34] scientific age everything must be proven
[1:02:37] scientifically we're living in the age
[1:02:39] of science as was predicted by the Bible
[1:02:41] weaker and wiser are wiser and weaker as
[1:02:44] was predicted we're living in that age
[1:02:47] we're more probed to science the further
[1:02:49] we get away from God you'll never be
[1:02:52] able to scientifically prove God and the
[1:02:55] whole Christian armor is absolutely
[1:02:57] Supernatural there's nothing natural if
[1:03:00] you can prove God there's no more need
[1:03:02] of Faith but he that cometh to God must
[1:03:05] believe it's by faith the whole
[1:03:07] Christian armor is Faith and so that's
[1:03:10] the approach I'm want to talk about is
[1:03:12] faith in the word of God but you say why
[1:03:15] was you talking about humbling yourself
[1:03:17] because humb humility brings on a faith
[1:03:20] in the word of God you see the Bible
[1:03:22] would tell us that whenever Lazarus had
[1:03:24] died and and Jesus was coming to the
[1:03:26] house Martha ran out and said Lord if
[1:03:29] you would have been here my brother
[1:03:31] surely would not have died she her
[1:03:34] spirit was in an uproar but then
[1:03:36] something changed she said but even now
[1:03:39] if you speak the word my brother would
[1:03:41] live you see her spirit was in an uproar
[1:03:44] doubt was rising up she did not want to
[1:03:47] Humble herself at the time but something
[1:03:49] took place but even now I know I might
[1:03:52] not understand the situation
[1:03:54] I might not understand why my brother
[1:03:57] had to die I might not understand what's
[1:03:59] going to happen but I know if you will
[1:04:01] speak the word if you will speak the
[1:04:04] word my brother will live and oh my
[1:04:06] that's the confidence of a humble
[1:04:09] believer I might not know what's going
[1:04:11] to happen tomorrow I might not know how
[1:04:13] I'm going to make it through this
[1:04:14] circumstance but I'm humble enough to
[1:04:17] know whatever you say is going to happen
[1:04:20] whatever the promises in your word
[1:04:22] concerning my life is is going to happen
[1:04:25] oh my and John 11:25 and Jesus said unto
[1:04:30] her I am the resurrection and the life
[1:04:33] he that believeth in me though he were
[1:04:35] dead yet shall he live and whosoever
[1:04:38] liveth and believeth in me shall never
[1:04:41] die and then he says this believest thou
[1:04:44] this he's letting her know I am the word
[1:04:46] made flesh I'm standing in front of you
[1:04:49] I am the resurrection and the life but
[1:04:52] you have to believe it you got to
[1:04:54] approach it the right way you see
[1:04:57] brother BR remember brother brandom
[1:04:58] talks about the man who told him I don't
[1:05:00] care if you can show me 10,000 Miracles
[1:05:03] I still want to believe in Divine
[1:05:05] Healing and brother brandom says sure
[1:05:07] it's not for unbelievers it's for them
[1:05:10] that believe oh my it's them that
[1:05:13] believe brother Brandon would tell us
[1:05:15] here and who has believed or report I
[1:05:17] believe his mercies are unlimited I
[1:05:20] believe tonight his mercies to you is
[1:05:22] unlimited but it's your faith that
[1:05:25] limits God and now he says see now God
[1:05:27] may come and give his great work tonight
[1:05:30] to you all he says his mercies or the
[1:05:33] Bible tells us his mercies are new Every
[1:05:35] Morning the same God that woke you up
[1:05:38] yesterday is the same God that's going
[1:05:40] to wake you up today he don't run out of
[1:05:42] mercies he don't run out of power he
[1:05:45] don't run out of authority but brother
[1:05:47] brandom says it's our faith it's our
[1:05:49] approach that limits the mercies of God
[1:05:52] oh but I say this morning morning let's
[1:05:54] take the limits off of god let's take
[1:05:57] the limits off of god let's take the
[1:05:59] breaks off of God hey we got a meeting
[1:06:01] starting tomorrow I believe we can see
[1:06:03] the supernatural we can see God Mighty
[1:06:06] in battle we can see it today God can
[1:06:08] heal today but if we're expecting
[1:06:09] something tomorrow let's take the breaks
[1:06:12] off of God and say Lord I'm coming into
[1:06:14] this meeting with the right approach
[1:06:17] saying Lord if you promise to meet me
[1:06:19] there I'm going to meet you there if you
[1:06:21] promise to heal the sick I'm going to be
[1:06:23] healed if you promised to fill with the
[1:06:25] Holy Ghost I'm going to be filled if I
[1:06:27] need Deliverance I'm going to be
[1:06:29] delivered I'm going to approach the
[1:06:32] supernatural the right way so I can see
[1:06:35] the strength of the Lord oh my I'm sure
[1:06:38] that's all of our desires is the see the
[1:06:40] strength of the Lord not just read the
[1:06:42] report but I want to see the god of the
[1:06:44] report oh my you see brother Brandon
[1:06:47] would tell us and you only get things
[1:06:49] from God that you're expecting you only
[1:06:51] get from God the things that you're EXP
[1:06:54] in from God in the way you approach God
[1:06:57] he says you approach him with reverence
[1:07:00] with faith every word is
[1:07:03] true he's saying you only get from God
[1:07:06] what you expect and you only expect in
[1:07:09] the way you
[1:07:10] approach hope this is okay this morning
[1:07:13] you can only expect God to heal if
[1:07:15] you're approaching him in faith it all
[1:07:18] goes right back to the approach you
[1:07:20] can't expect God to meet us next week if
[1:07:22] you don't got faith in us word you're
[1:07:24] not going to you can't expect to make a
[1:07:27] Rapture if you don't got faith that
[1:07:29] there is a Rapture you can't expect to
[1:07:32] be in the Millennium if you don't got
[1:07:33] faith that there is a millennium but if
[1:07:36] there's an expectation or if your
[1:07:38] approach is the right way that creates
[1:07:41] an expectation that I am going to see
[1:07:44] the promises of God in my life fulfilled
[1:07:48] oh Hallelujah cuz brother Brandon would
[1:07:49] tell us he says now usually you get what
[1:07:52] you're expecting and then you come to a
[1:07:54] meeting tonight to criticize or to make
[1:07:56] fun or to stir up the devil will give
[1:07:58] you something to criticize oh my that
[1:08:02] I'm sure all of us has read this and
[1:08:04] heard this but that just stood out to me
[1:08:06] as I read that the other day the devil
[1:08:08] will give you something to criticized it
[1:08:10] ain't God giving you a criticizing
[1:08:12] Spirit come on now if you're critical of
[1:08:15] this one critical of that one critical
[1:08:17] of this one it's not God bringing that
[1:08:19] it's the devil giving it to you come on
[1:08:22] now that means our expectation is wrong
[1:08:25] oh my you see what happens when we come
[1:08:28] to church and they sing the wrong song
[1:08:30] and so now I'm going to cross my arms
[1:08:32] it's not you're not hindering this
[1:08:34] person you're hindering yourself too
[1:08:36] many people gets in their mind where a
[1:08:38] preacher stepped on my toes so I'm going
[1:08:40] to let him know I don't approve of it
[1:08:42] you're not hindering anybody but
[1:08:44] yourself well I'm preaching now our
[1:08:46] approach has to be the right way if we
[1:08:49] get so critical we're never going to see
[1:08:51] the supernatural if you become so
[1:08:53] critical you're never going to see God
[1:08:55] in your family you're never going to see
[1:08:57] God in your marriage you're never going
[1:08:59] to see God in your life but once we
[1:09:01] approach God the right way not with the
[1:09:04] critical spirit but Lord I'm coming
[1:09:06] today a Sunday morning a Wednesday night
[1:09:09] a Sunday night with the right attitude
[1:09:12] oh brother brandom says the right mental
[1:09:13] attitude towards any promise of God will
[1:09:16] bring it to pass oh when you say my
[1:09:18] attitude don't matter it does matter I'm
[1:09:21] preaching now it does matter if you come
[1:09:24] to church not wanting to be here you're
[1:09:26] never going to see the promises of God
[1:09:28] but I say let's take the limits of God
[1:09:31] and say Lord I'm coming with an
[1:09:33] expectation to see the
[1:09:35] supernatural oh Hallelujah I'm going to
[1:09:38] see the supernatural what what do the
[1:09:41] Bible tell us the report of the Lord
[1:09:43] brings the strength of the Lord so it
[1:09:45] don't matter who's preaching it don't
[1:09:46] matter for a convention it don't matter
[1:09:48] if we at a youth camp If the message is
[1:09:51] being preached the strength of the Lord
[1:09:53] is is being
[1:09:54] preached oh my you see I I I I'll just
[1:09:58] be honest tonight or this morning I
[1:10:00] remember after a youth youth camp this
[1:10:02] past year we had a powerful move of God
[1:10:05] in the Wednesday night service I
[1:10:07] remember thinking man I wish the same
[1:10:10] the same Supernatural that was there
[1:10:12] could be in Wednesday night service
[1:10:15] honestly thinking that and I was
[1:10:16] thinking that God can only move at a
[1:10:19] youth camp God can only move at a
[1:10:22] convention God can only move if a
[1:10:24] certain a certain preacher is preaching
[1:10:27] but that's not the way it works it don't
[1:10:29] matter who's preaching it don't matter
[1:10:32] what what what church you're at if it's
[1:10:33] a convention if it's the tent meeting if
[1:10:35] it's the super if it's the the message
[1:10:37] of God being preached the Supernatural
[1:10:40] is going to follow it oh my now as I was
[1:10:44] pondering on these things we we've sort
[1:10:46] of been in a little Revival back home it
[1:10:49] was uh the Sunday before Christmas and
[1:10:51] dad had a had a burden to do a pray pray
[1:10:53] line Sunday night and Sunday morning he
[1:10:55] got up and was teaching on faith
[1:10:58] teaching on faith teaching on faith and
[1:11:00] you know if you if you was looking
[1:11:01] through critical eyes you can say man
[1:11:03] nothing's happening all that's in vain
[1:11:06] nobody's crying no nobody come up for
[1:11:08] prayer nobody done this nobody done that
[1:11:11] but then Sunday night come around Sunday
[1:11:13] night come around we had a prayer line
[1:11:15] there was people getting healed there
[1:11:17] was some getting delivered they they
[1:11:18] were weeping out the altar you may say
[1:11:21] well the supernatural moved Sunday night
[1:11:24] but the supernatural wasn't there Sunday
[1:11:26] morning come on now that's a critical
[1:11:28] eye looking at it and saying well it
[1:11:30] takes the emotion for the supernatural
[1:11:33] to be in the church but it took Sunday
[1:11:35] morning for Sunday night to happen come
[1:11:38] on now it takes this it takes the
[1:11:40] teaching for there to be a breakthrough
[1:11:43] and you know Wednesday night come along
[1:11:44] it was the Wednesday before Christmas
[1:11:46] Dad was preaching a a Christmas message
[1:11:49] and was teaching on the son of man and
[1:11:51] the same Supernatural that was their son
[1:11:53] Sunday night was there Wednesday night
[1:11:55] was there people dancing no was there
[1:11:58] people coming to the altar no was there
[1:12:00] people crying no but that didn't matter
[1:12:03] the message was being preached and that
[1:12:06] was bringing the Supernatural and oh my
[1:12:09] you may come on a Wednesday night and it
[1:12:11] may feel dry it may feel dead but if the
[1:12:14] message is coming across you can say
[1:12:16] Lord let my expectation be different let
[1:12:20] my expectation be different if the
[1:12:22] message is coming forth the report is
[1:12:25] coming forth I'm going to receive it so
[1:12:27] I can see the
[1:12:29] results oh Hallelujah I want to see the
[1:12:33] results you see it's pressure that comes
[1:12:35] against your mind comes against your
[1:12:37] faith saying if my experiencing like
[1:12:40] this one I remember as a teenager I
[1:12:42] never went out into the world I never
[1:12:43] drank I never smoked I never got into
[1:12:45] the drugs and I remember thinking as a
[1:12:47] teenager God never did anything for me I
[1:12:50] I I me literally thinking that that this
[1:12:52] one was delivered from this that one was
[1:12:54] delivered from that this one over here
[1:12:56] that one over there and God's never did
[1:12:58] anything for me and brother Tim SCH was
[1:13:01] preaching at our church I think of
[1:13:02] Wednesday night and he was preaching and
[1:13:04] he says you know many young people think
[1:13:07] that since they never went out into the
[1:13:08] world they never drank they never smoked
[1:13:11] they never did these things that God
[1:13:13] never did anything for them and I'm
[1:13:14] sitting there on the front row thinking
[1:13:16] my goodness I was just thinking this and
[1:13:19] you know what he says he says not to
[1:13:21] take away from their testimony but you
[1:13:24] have a greater testimony than the ones
[1:13:26] that are out in the world because you're
[1:13:28] in the middle of Satan's Eden and yet
[1:13:31] you're not defiled it was a voice it was
[1:13:34] pressure coming and whispering in my ear
[1:13:37] since I'm not acting like this one God
[1:13:39] ain't doing nothing for me it was the
[1:13:41] devil trying to keep me from seeing the
[1:13:43] supernatural in my life oh my I'm
[1:13:46] preaching now when it's voices of the
[1:13:48] enemy that comes and Whispers in your
[1:13:50] ear that you're not doing acting like
[1:13:52] this one you're not acting like that one
[1:13:54] and you miss the supernatural that is in
[1:13:56] your life oh we can miss the
[1:13:58] supernatural that is in the church if
[1:14:01] we're expecting oh my we can be looking
[1:14:04] everywhere else and we can miss the
[1:14:06] supernatural that is happening right in
[1:14:09] front of us I'm challenging you this
[1:14:11] morning get our approach the right way
[1:14:14] we're not approaching the pastor we're
[1:14:16] not approaching the Evangelist we're
[1:14:17] approaching God we're approaching the
[1:14:20] supernatural we're approaching the god
[1:14:22] mighty in battle oh hallelujah oh we
[1:14:27] were approaching the god that can heal
[1:14:29] oh Hallelujah and so the Bible would
[1:14:32] tell us in Hebrews 11:6 but without
[1:14:35] faith it is impossible to please him for
[1:14:38] he that cometh to God must believe that
[1:14:40] he is and that he is a rewarder of them
[1:14:44] that diligently seek him so he that
[1:14:46] cometh to God or approaches God must
[1:14:49] believe so faith is more than just
[1:14:52] saying I believe God and when the doubt
[1:14:54] comes or the circumstances come I don't
[1:14:57] believe God no more but faith is an
[1:14:59] anchor faith is something that goes
[1:15:01] beyond the five senses and into the soul
[1:15:05] oh my the Bible would tell us in Matthew
[1:15:07] 15:8 this people drove up nigh unto me
[1:15:10] with their mouth and honth me with their
[1:15:12] lips but their heart is far from me so
[1:15:15] faith is more than just saying I believe
[1:15:18] and our heart is somewhere else but it's
[1:15:20] our heart saying I believe God no no
[1:15:23] matter the circumstance no matter the
[1:15:25] the situation there's an anchor on the
[1:15:28] inside the Bible would tell us in
[1:15:30] Hebrews 11 and one now Faith is the
[1:15:33] substance of things hoped for the
[1:15:35] evidence of Things Not Seen so faith has
[1:15:38] a reality faith has substance you might
[1:15:41] not see with your natural lie but the
[1:15:44] supernatural sense called Faith sees it
[1:15:47] before it ever takes place oh Hallelujah
[1:15:50] you see brother Brandon would say see
[1:15:52] meaning people have hope in their mental
[1:15:55] thinking and I'm sorry to say that
[1:15:58] that's the position of many Christians
[1:16:00] professing today is mental thinking they
[1:16:03] have a conception brother brandom says
[1:16:05] many people replace Faith with hope but
[1:16:08] there's no reality with hope or hope is
[1:16:11] I'm hoping that God is going to meet us
[1:16:13] today I'm hoping that God is going to be
[1:16:16] in our Revival next week I'm hoping that
[1:16:18] God will heal my body but there's no
[1:16:21] reality to Hope but faith says I know
[1:16:24] that God is going to be there tomorrow I
[1:16:27] know that God is going to be there
[1:16:29] Tuesday and once I show up with the
[1:16:31] right mental attitude I will see the
[1:16:34] results that I'm looking for oh brother
[1:16:37] brandom says you can't accept it by
[1:16:39] intellectual thought that's intellectual
[1:16:41] your mind will reason it but Faith does
[1:16:44] not reason if you got intellectual Faith
[1:16:47] then it's just a reasoning Faith oh my
[1:16:50] it's just a reasoning Faith but brother
[1:16:52] Brandon say in another place and they
[1:16:54] said it's the occupant of the Soul after
[1:16:57] all then a man does believe from his
[1:16:59] heart you think from your mind but you
[1:17:01] believe from your heart oh my your mind
[1:17:04] is never saved your body is never saved
[1:17:07] it's the Holy Ghost keeping it in the
[1:17:09] subjection but you still have other
[1:17:12] desires that you got to put into check
[1:17:14] your mind still wonders through doubt
[1:17:16] and unbelief but the heart that's been
[1:17:19] reborned oh the heart that's been sealed
[1:17:22] with the Holy Ghost there's a faith
[1:17:24] there's an anchor on the inside oh my
[1:17:27] you know another phrase from my from my
[1:17:30] pastor brother window he says the reason
[1:17:32] why I'm against psychology is because if
[1:17:35] your your psychology is in the mind you
[1:17:37] can believe God in the mind you can pray
[1:17:39] from the mind but once you're dying your
[1:17:41] your mind's dying with you once you go
[1:17:44] into the grave your mind is dead in the
[1:17:46] grave but the soul oh the soul that's
[1:17:50] been regenerated by the baptism of the
[1:17:52] Holy Ghost GH HD Ain dead it's still
[1:17:55] living there's an anchor oh Hallelujah
[1:17:58] and that's what the bride is believing
[1:18:00] from not the mind not with an
[1:18:02] intellectual conception but they're
[1:18:04] believing from the soul no matter what I
[1:18:07] go through there's an anchor no matter
[1:18:09] what tomorrow holds there's an anchor no
[1:18:11] matter what I go through this coming
[1:18:13] year there's an anchor on the inside oh
[1:18:17] Hallelujah God is sealed in and the
[1:18:19] devil is sealed out there's an anchor
[1:18:22] that is on the side of the Soul yes sir
[1:18:26] oh my and that's what we're believing
[1:18:28] from you see Faith unlocks the key to
[1:18:31] the supernatural it unlocks the
[1:18:33] supernatural so that we can see it you
[1:18:36] may stay with the Josh how does that
[1:18:38] work we can have the message opened up
[1:18:40] to us the hills can be open but if
[1:18:43] there's no faith to believe we're never
[1:18:45] going to see
[1:18:46] it hey I was raised on a message Pew I'm
[1:18:49] sure there's many in here that was too
[1:18:51] and I remember sitting there and didn't
[1:18:53] have a clue of what their what my dad
[1:18:56] was talking about I remember listening
[1:18:57] to the tapes and not having a clue made
[1:18:59] no sense but once I started to get a
[1:19:01] revelation for myself I started to get
[1:19:04] Faith for myself then it started to open
[1:19:06] up wow this is what he's talking about
[1:19:09] this is for me this ain't just a message
[1:19:12] this is my message you see it's a
[1:19:14] personal revelation you know brother
[1:19:16] brandom says that we can we can believe
[1:19:19] but once it comes to ourself we have a
[1:19:21] hard time believing it
[1:19:23] you know brother Brandon he talks about
[1:19:25] the the preacher that he was in front of
[1:19:27] his congregation and he picked up a log
[1:19:29] and he says do y'all think I can carry
[1:19:30] this log and they said yes sir you can
[1:19:32] carry it and he carried it then he got a
[1:19:35] wbel and he says do you think I can push
[1:19:37] this W barrel and they all said yes sir
[1:19:39] you can push the wheelbarrow and he
[1:19:41] started to push it and then he stopped
[1:19:43] and he says do you think I can push a
[1:19:45] person in this wheelbarrow and they all
[1:19:47] said yes sir we believe you can do it
[1:19:50] and he says okay get in and they all
[1:19:52] stop and they said well I don't know
[1:19:54] about that and he says we can say Amen
[1:19:56] to it but once it comes to us personally
[1:19:59] we have a hard time oh my that's what
[1:20:02] faith does it makes it a personal
[1:20:04] revelation it's my message this is my
[1:20:08] inheritance it's my authority this
[1:20:10] report is for me personally if there's
[1:20:13] only one person right here in Faith
[1:20:15] Tabernacle that's going to make a
[1:20:17] Rapture it's me if there's only one
[1:20:19] person in blackburg it's me if there's
[1:20:22] only one person in Virginia hits me it's
[1:20:25] Faith making it a personal
[1:20:29] revelation oh my a secondhand experience
[1:20:32] is never going to do it for you a
[1:20:34] secondhand Revelation is never going to
[1:20:36] do it for you but once it becomes your
[1:20:39] Revelation and anchors in the soul then
[1:20:41] it is your personal revindication your
[1:20:44] personal revelation you see I I've been
[1:20:47] to some new places and Sean can can
[1:20:49] vouch for it I'm sure as you travel
[1:20:51] around you come into new new churches
[1:20:53] and you don't have a clue where the
[1:20:54] office is where the bathrooms are and
[1:20:56] you you're sort of stumbling around
[1:20:58] you're looking around and you just wait
[1:21:00] for somebody to come out and say hey the
[1:21:03] office is this way and so as you
[1:21:05] approach the office you're just assuming
[1:21:08] but you're you're presuming that there's
[1:21:10] a desk in there you're presuming that
[1:21:12] there's a chair for you to sit in you
[1:21:14] know brother brandom says the word
[1:21:16] presume is the Venture without Authority
[1:21:19] and so I I have no authority to believe
[1:21:22] that there's a chair in behind that door
[1:21:24] even though there's one there but I
[1:21:26] haven't seen it yet for myself and so
[1:21:29] I'm just presuming that there's a chair
[1:21:31] there's a there's a there there's a desk
[1:21:33] back there but once the door comes open
[1:21:35] all the presuming is out the door cuz
[1:21:39] now I see it for myself oh Hallelujah
[1:21:43] and once we get a revelation of who we
[1:21:45] really are all the puming is out the
[1:21:48] door and then an actual Authority an
[1:21:51] actual Authority see the supernatural
[1:21:54] the arm of the Lord starts to manifest
[1:21:56] itself in your life oh Hallelujah this
[1:22:00] is the season for miracles this is the
[1:22:02] season for the supernatural to come in
[1:22:05] young people to come in young marriages
[1:22:07] to come in adults and manifest itself oh
[1:22:11] my it's God hiding himself in Simplicity
[1:22:14] and revealing himself the same but the
[1:22:16] brandom says he comes so humble that all
[1:22:19] the other ones rejected him they looked
[1:22:21] at him but the says whenever Christ was
[1:22:24] in the manger he says there was people
[1:22:26] from all over the place that was coming
[1:22:28] together to sacrifice and brother
[1:22:30] brandom says it was a stench in the no
[1:22:33] in the nostrils of God but then there
[1:22:35] come some Shepherds oh there come some
[1:22:38] Shepherds they wasn't smart they W
[1:22:40] wasn't intellectual but they were humble
[1:22:42] enough to follow the Angel's report and
[1:22:45] I said Lord I'm humble enough to follow
[1:22:49] the Angel's report to the supernatural
[1:22:52] you know I always thought I always had
[1:22:54] it in my mind that it was a bunch of
[1:22:56] angels that appeared to the Shepherds
[1:22:58] but if you go and read it the Bible says
[1:23:00] it was the angel of the Lord that
[1:23:02] appeared to the Shepherds and started to
[1:23:04] give them a message saying go over here
[1:23:07] and wrapping swaddling clothes here in a
[1:23:09] Manger is laying the promised Messiah
[1:23:12] and I think my we got an angel in this
[1:23:14] generation that come with the message
[1:23:17] saying the Lord is on earth now the
[1:23:20] Messiah ain't coming he's here now now
[1:23:22] the Supernatural is walking the Earth
[1:23:25] you know what brother brandham says
[1:23:26] brother brandham says the highest of
[1:23:28] Heavens come to the lowest of the Earth
[1:23:31] the Shepherds to let them know that the
[1:23:34] Messiah is on earth now oh that they
[1:23:37] didn't have to wait for something all
[1:23:39] they had to do was follow the report and
[1:23:42] they could see the promised Messiah and
[1:23:45] I say Lord we're here today looking for
[1:23:48] the supernatural if we can just follow
[1:23:50] the report we will see
[1:23:53] it oh Hallelujah hope this is okay this
[1:23:57] evening or this morning you see brother
[1:23:59] brandom says faith finds a source that
[1:24:01] other people don't know nothing about
[1:24:04] when a man has got faith in God he's got
[1:24:06] a hold of something he can't explain oh
[1:24:09] but something that he's got a hold of he
[1:24:11] can't push it shove it or pull it it
[1:24:13] takes him and that's the way faith is
[1:24:16] when a man really got faith in God it
[1:24:19] finds a source that others don't see
[1:24:22] oh it finds a source that others don't
[1:24:25] see that's why you're still here this
[1:24:26] morning that's why you haven't committed
[1:24:29] suicide or lost your mind or you're not
[1:24:31] in depression somewhere is because you
[1:24:33] found a source oh you found something
[1:24:36] that was an anchor in every circumstance
[1:24:39] you remember brother Brandon whenever he
[1:24:40] lost his wife and his daughter the man
[1:24:43] come up to him and was criticizing him
[1:24:45] and said Billy I've seen you work all
[1:24:47] day and come to the street corners and
[1:24:49] preach and then you preach all night
[1:24:51] then you go back to work and you do this
[1:24:53] over and over and over and he says now
[1:24:56] the Lord has taken your wife and your
[1:24:59] baby yeah he says why do you think of
[1:25:01] your God now he says I still think of
[1:25:03] him the same he is still worthy he and
[1:25:06] he says oh you kept your religion huh he
[1:25:09] says no My Religion kept me my religion
[1:25:12] kept me it wasn't an intellectual
[1:25:14] conception it was an anchor in the soul
[1:25:17] oh and this message has kept us through
[1:25:20] every situation this message has
[1:25:23] released an authority that we can't
[1:25:25] explain it's just a source that is
[1:25:28] carrying me this far oh Hallelujah
[1:25:31] brother Brandon would say now we found
[1:25:33] salvation we found salvation that will
[1:25:35] save us from sin that will take the
[1:25:38] viess women or man drunker or prostitute
[1:25:41] and make them a child of God he says
[1:25:43] well that same Faith the same power that
[1:25:46] will lift up a fallen man or a woman
[1:25:48] it'll work in many different ways it
[1:25:51] will heal our bodies if we can just find
[1:25:53] the right approach you got to find how
[1:25:56] to do it oh so it ain't God changing his
[1:25:59] approaches it ain't God saying okay in
[1:26:01] order for you to be saved you got to
[1:26:03] have faith but for for me to heal your
[1:26:05] body you got to do this in order for me
[1:26:07] to deliver you you got to do this but
[1:26:10] the same faith that saved our soul is
[1:26:13] the same faith that we used in every
[1:26:15] aspect of our life oh my every aspect of
[1:26:19] our life it's Faith it's Faith you see
[1:26:22] because because the five senses will
[1:26:25] always look at the negative but the but
[1:26:27] Faith looks at the positive you believe
[1:26:30] that this you believe that this morning
[1:26:31] the Bible would say in James 1:9 let the
[1:26:34] brother of low degree rejoice in that he
[1:26:38] is
[1:26:39] exalted and I think my that's what the
[1:26:41] devil is afraid of is God exalting
[1:26:44] somebody in Heavenly places where the
[1:26:47] devil can't do nothing with him brother
[1:26:49] brandom says that that a man can live so
[1:26:51] close to God that the devil don't know
[1:26:53] what to do with him that's exactly what
[1:26:55] the devil's afraid of but it's simple
[1:26:58] faith in
[1:26:59] Simplicity hope this is making sense
[1:27:01] this morning brother brandham tells a
[1:27:03] story of Mr dorsy he says he was an old
[1:27:06] man about 85 years old he was in the
[1:27:08] Civil War and he says there was a little
[1:27:10] girl that was heading to Sunday school
[1:27:12] and he says this man come up to her and
[1:27:14] says Miss where you going and she says
[1:27:16] well I'm going to Sunday school and he
[1:27:18] says why you going to Sunday school
[1:27:19] don't you know that that is an old fogy
[1:27:22] religion and she says no it ain't and he
[1:27:24] says how can you believe that and she
[1:27:27] said she stopped and she picked up a
[1:27:28] flower and he says sir where did this
[1:27:31] flower come from and brother brandom
[1:27:33] says he would say Well it come from the
[1:27:34] earth well who put the seed in the earth
[1:27:37] well well well well who who made the
[1:27:39] Earth brother brandom says it was
[1:27:41] through that Simplicity that Mr dorsy
[1:27:43] gave his life to Christ it was so simple
[1:27:47] that a little girl could believe it it
[1:27:49] was so simple that a little girl could
[1:27:51] understand God in my that's the way this
[1:27:54] message is it's so simple that even
[1:27:57] young people can understand it it's so
[1:27:59] simple that even children can understand
[1:28:01] it oh my brother Brandon will refer back
[1:28:04] to the scripture in Isaiah 3035 and8 and
[1:28:07] the highway shall there be and the way
[1:28:09] and it shall be called the way of
[1:28:11] Holiness and the unclean shall not pass
[1:28:14] over it but it shall be for those the
[1:28:16] way fearing men though fools should not
[1:28:19] air from it brother brandom says it's so
[1:28:21] simple that even fools can see it he
[1:28:24] says the unlearned can't see it but the
[1:28:26] ones with no education can't see it Oh
[1:28:30] my he talks about Moses and he says God
[1:28:32] took a simple family he says you don't
[1:28:34] even know where his mother came from you
[1:28:36] don't even know who where his father
[1:28:38] came from he says but God chose a simple
[1:28:41] family to reveal the strength and he
[1:28:43] says just to show that God works through
[1:28:46] Simplicity he allowed Moses to get
[1:28:49] exalted he went into education and but
[1:28:52] the random says he was a mighty
[1:28:53] conqueror he was conquering Nations
[1:28:55] around Egypt but God allowed him to
[1:28:58] Tumble so that he would prove that he
[1:29:00] only works through Simplicity and what
[1:29:03] happened through his education through
[1:29:05] his knowledge he got one dead Egyption
[1:29:08] but then once he humbled himself to the
[1:29:11] pillar of fire he didn't just get one
[1:29:13] dead Egyptian but Simplicity brought Li
[1:29:16] into existence Simplicity turned water
[1:29:19] into blood it was Simplicity the flip
[1:29:22] the Red Sea oh my but you notice that
[1:29:24] Moses had to approach the burning bush
[1:29:27] in humility the Bible would tell us in
[1:29:30] Exodus 3 and 4 and when the Lord saw
[1:29:32] that he turned aside to see God called
[1:29:35] unto him out of the midst of the Bush
[1:29:37] and so Moses Moses and he said here am I
[1:29:41] and he said draw not nigh hither but put
[1:29:43] off thy shoes from off thy feet for the
[1:29:46] place whereon thou standest is Holy
[1:29:49] Ground moreover he said I am the god of
[1:29:51] thy father you notice he wasn't going to
[1:29:54] reveal the message to him until he
[1:29:56] humbled
[1:29:57] himself he called him there was an
[1:30:00] attraction there was a pool he called
[1:30:02] unto Moses but before he could see the
[1:30:04] report understand it he had to Humble
[1:30:07] himself oh Hallelujah so before we the
[1:30:11] the message can call out to us there can
[1:30:13] be an attraction but before we can see
[1:30:16] it before we can understand it there has
[1:30:18] to be humility oh my you I can look you
[1:30:21] can think of the wise man and and I was
[1:30:23] listening to brother bradam and he just
[1:30:25] I love how he how he preaches that
[1:30:26] message we have seen a star and I've
[1:30:28] come to worship him he says the W the
[1:30:30] wise men were sitting around the fire
[1:30:32] and they seen a star and he says one of
[1:30:34] them looked to the other and says see
[1:30:37] what the Scrolls say about the star and
[1:30:39] as they went into the Scrolls they went
[1:30:41] to numbers and the numbers says the The
[1:30:43] Book of Numbers says out of Jacob shall
[1:30:45] arise a star and brother brandom says
[1:30:48] they left the fire they left the fire
[1:30:50] and follow the star and that D struck me
[1:30:53] they were around a man light they needed
[1:30:56] a fire to guide them but once they seen
[1:30:58] a scriptural star they didn't need that
[1:31:01] any longer they had a star leading them
[1:31:03] to the Supernatural and you notice
[1:31:05] brother brinham says that uh and he says
[1:31:08] here and they said we have seen his star
[1:31:10] in the east and have come to worship Him
[1:31:13] in other words we have seen his sign for
[1:31:16] this age that we're living in it was
[1:31:18] prophesied so they seem prophecy
[1:31:22] standing in front of them and they says
[1:31:24] this is the sign for this age I'm going
[1:31:27] to follow it and you notice what they
[1:31:29] did when they come to the city I just
[1:31:31] love they come to the city demanding
[1:31:33] where is he the king of the Jews for we
[1:31:37] have seen his star they wasn't coming in
[1:31:40] uh when saying can you please show us
[1:31:41] the king can you can you show us the
[1:31:43] king of the Jews they were coming
[1:31:45] demanding we've recognized the
[1:31:47] supernatural we've recognized his star
[1:31:50] this ain't just some star this is his
[1:31:53] star that was promised for this
[1:31:55] generation show us the king and oh my
[1:31:58] what's the Bible saying Revelations that
[1:32:00] there were seven stars in the right hand
[1:32:03] of God those stars were Messengers or
[1:32:05] Messengers those Messengers had messages
[1:32:08] and I say Lord we have seen your star in
[1:32:11] this generation we're following the star
[1:32:14] it's led us to the supernatural show us
[1:32:17] the King show us God Mighty in battle
[1:32:19] show us the supernatural show us the god
[1:32:23] that can still heal show us the god that
[1:32:26] can revive show us the god that keeps
[1:32:29] marriages together show us a God that
[1:32:32] can keep young people in the time of
[1:32:34] peer pressure if you follow the star you
[1:32:37] will find the king if you follow the
[1:32:40] star you will find the supernatural oh
[1:32:43] Hallelujah he's here walking the ows
[1:32:45] he's here walking the pews you just got
[1:32:48] to recognize the Supernatural is in your
[1:32:51] midst
[1:32:53] oh Hallelujah the Supernatural is in the
[1:32:57] midst if you're willing to follow the
[1:33:00] star Matthew 2:10 when they saw the star
[1:33:03] they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy
[1:33:07] oh could you just imagine they weren't
[1:33:09] the only stargazers there were
[1:33:11] stargazers everywhere how come they
[1:33:14] Rejoice brother Josh because there was
[1:33:16] something
[1:33:18] attracted where the carcass is there the
[1:33:20] Eagles will be
[1:33:23] gathered be gathered before the Eagles
[1:33:25] can be gathered to it there has to be an
[1:33:27] attraction to it oh the crows they don't
[1:33:30] care about it they're happy with this
[1:33:31] over here the buzzards or happy with
[1:33:33] that over there but the Eagles have an
[1:33:35] attraction and oh my they looked up and
[1:33:38] seen the star and there was an
[1:33:40] scriptural expectation and they said my
[1:33:43] she see what scripture says about this
[1:33:45] see what the Scrolls says about this
[1:33:48] there's something attracting me to this
[1:33:50] star oh there's something attracting me
[1:33:53] to this star but I'm not just happy with
[1:33:55] the attraction I want to see a scripture
[1:33:58] for it and oh my we're not just happy
[1:34:01] with the with the attraction but we want
[1:34:03] a scriptural star and I believe we got a
[1:34:06] scriptural star in this generation oh we
[1:34:09] can't help but rejoice and that's why as
[1:34:12] message Believers we have a right to be
[1:34:14] happy because out of all of the people
[1:34:17] in the world God chose you to be
[1:34:19] attracted to the super natural God chose
[1:34:22] you to produce the Life of Christ God
[1:34:26] chose you to reveal himself
[1:34:29] through oh Hallelujah God chose you to
[1:34:33] reveal himself through but the random
[1:34:35] says you're God's advertising agent he
[1:34:37] says you're his billboard he says he was
[1:34:39] driving down the road one day and he
[1:34:41] seen a billboard that said hungry just
[1:34:43] one word hungry and on the bottom of the
[1:34:45] billboard in small letters says up 5
[1:34:48] miles up the road a certain restaurant
[1:34:50] and brother brandom said says that
[1:34:51] billboard wasn't to attract the ones
[1:34:54] that was looking for a car it wasn't to
[1:34:56] attract the ones that was looking for a
[1:34:58] hotel it was to attract the ones that
[1:35:01] were
[1:35:01] hungry oh my and that billboard was to
[1:35:05] attract the ones and say hey what's
[1:35:07] you're looking for is
[1:35:09] here oh my and that's the way our life
[1:35:12] is to be you you're needy wanting a
[1:35:14] savior you're wanting help you need help
[1:35:17] in your marriage let me show you a
[1:35:19] supernatural God let me come and see a
[1:35:22] man that has show me all the things that
[1:35:24] I have ever
[1:35:26] done come show come come see a man oh my
[1:35:30] but you notice in Matthew 2 And1 now
[1:35:32] when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of
[1:35:34] Judea the days of Herod the king behold
[1:35:37] there come wise men in the East to
[1:35:40] Jerusalem saying where is he that is
[1:35:42] born King of the
[1:35:44] Jews for we have seen a star in the east
[1:35:47] and have come to worship him but you
[1:35:50] notice how the Bible calls them wise men
[1:35:53] but if you go back to my opening
[1:35:55] scripture the Bible says it's hid from
[1:35:57] the wise and the prudent so what's the
[1:36:00] difference this one's being rejected
[1:36:03] because they're wise but these other
[1:36:05] ones are being accepted because of
[1:36:07] wisdom it's two different wisdoms here
[1:36:10] the brother Brandon would tell us and
[1:36:12] then when the wise men saw the star or
[1:36:14] saw the word of God said a star would
[1:36:17] rise out of Jacob they follow that
[1:36:19] little god-given token to the source of
[1:36:21] eternal life so will the wise men today
[1:36:25] here he's calling you wise he says who
[1:36:27] was not blinded by Creeds will follow
[1:36:30] the god-given spoken word until they see
[1:36:34] the fullness of the power of God
[1:36:36] blooming forth in this hour they see it
[1:36:40] and they know it's here in the scripture
[1:36:42] oh Hallelujah they know it's here in the
[1:36:44] scripture God promised it for today oh
[1:36:48] my so will the wise men today who is not
[1:36:50] blind
[1:36:51] by the wisdom of the world but their
[1:36:53] eyes have been opened by another wisdom
[1:36:56] you see the Bible that brother Brandon
[1:36:58] would tell us or sorry the Bible would
[1:37:00] tell us in James 3:14 but if you have
[1:37:02] bitter envying and strife in your hearts
[1:37:05] Glory not lie not against the truth this
[1:37:08] wisdom descendeth not from above but as
[1:37:11] Earthly Central devilish for where Envy
[1:37:14] is and striving is there is confusion in
[1:37:18] every evil work but the wisdom that is
[1:37:20] from above is first pure so he's letting
[1:37:24] you know there is two wisdoms what
[1:37:26] wisdom are you going to partake
[1:37:28] of oh hallelujah what wisdom are you
[1:37:32] going to partake of brother Brandman say
[1:37:34] so the wisdom that I want to get
[1:37:36] straightened out of before we start
[1:37:38] there was a wisdom of God a wisdom of
[1:37:40] God is to stay with his word but Satan
[1:37:43] in his wisdom tries to twist the word so
[1:37:46] that's the wisdom we're speaking of so
[1:37:49] anything that's contrary to the word of
[1:37:52] God is the wisdom of the world but you
[1:37:55] notice how the serpent come how Satan
[1:37:58] came to eeve and says God knows you'll
[1:38:01] be wise like him you'll be as Gods if
[1:38:04] you partake of this wisdom and but you
[1:38:07] notice they was already in a position as
[1:38:10] Gods brother brand would tell us that it
[1:38:12] Adam could speak to the storms and the
[1:38:14] storm would listen he would speak to the
[1:38:16] tree be plucked up and planted over here
[1:38:19] and it would happen he would speak with
[1:38:21] the already in a position as God brother
[1:38:24] bam called him a minor God under god
[1:38:26] Jehovah but what happened worldly wisdom
[1:38:29] pulled him from his
[1:38:31] authority oh my worldly wisdom pulled
[1:38:35] him from his authority what is that in
[1:38:37] the in the message God the voice of God
[1:38:39] on the last days he goes through voices
[1:38:42] and speaks as them as speaks to them as
[1:38:44] influences he says Hollywood is one
[1:38:47] place over there in California or
[1:38:49] wherever it's had but but he says now
[1:38:51] that influence the voice has come into
[1:38:54] all the homes and he says now it's set
[1:38:57] the pattern he says you look at Matt
[1:38:59] Dylan he says Matt Dylan he was a he was
[1:39:01] a coward he says he was a sheriff in
[1:39:04] Kansas and he would wait outside of
[1:39:06] dolge city and he would shoot me in the
[1:39:08] back he was a coward but he says now
[1:39:10] Hollywood has made him a hero he says
[1:39:13] and now all of the kitties have the H
[1:39:15] the cowboy hats they've got the six
[1:39:17] shooters and he says they can tell
[1:39:19] everything about dealing but can't say
[1:39:22] anything about Christ what it it's
[1:39:25] worldly wisdom that is bringing a
[1:39:27] generation from the wisdom of God oh
[1:39:32] Hallelujah and then he talk he continues
[1:39:34] on about Hollywood he says now they've
[1:39:37] set the pattern for the dress he says
[1:39:39] the way they do their hair and the way
[1:39:41] they dress Hollywood has set the pattern
[1:39:45] what it's worldly wisdom trying to get
[1:39:48] the bride out of her position but we
[1:39:50] don't got to be influenced by the voice
[1:39:53] of Hollywood by the voice of politics by
[1:39:56] the voice of The World God has given us
[1:39:58] a wisdom in this generation that is
[1:40:01] exalting us it's exalting us to be a
[1:40:04] Powerhouse in this generation oh
[1:40:08] Hallelujah you see brother brand would
[1:40:10] say in order to believe the devil's lie
[1:40:13] you have to ignore and deny God's truth
[1:40:16] see he says first before you can believe
[1:40:18] the devil's lie you ever think of that
[1:40:20] now you ever you ever think of that you
[1:40:22] have to deny the truth first before you
[1:40:25] can believe a lie right you have to deny
[1:40:28] it oh my you have to deny it and it's
[1:40:31] reasoning that comes in and as the Devil
[1:40:34] comes in and says well the
[1:40:36] supernatural's not going to move tonight
[1:40:38] there there's a reasoning spirit and now
[1:40:40] you're believing worldly wisdom hope
[1:40:43] this is okay tonight as we come to a
[1:40:45] church Sunday night or Wednesday night
[1:40:47] or Sunday morning and those voices
[1:40:49] whispering and so well you it's going to
[1:40:51] be no different we're going to hear the
[1:40:53] same message we're going to see the same
[1:40:54] things it's wisdom trying to pull you
[1:40:56] from the supernatural but I say let's
[1:40:59] keep our eyes upon the Heavenly wisdom
[1:41:02] oh Hallelujah let's keep our eyes on the
[1:41:05] Heavenly wisdom you see look at Genesis
[1:41:07] 2:1 17 but of the tree of knowledge of
[1:41:10] good and of evil thou shall not eat of
[1:41:12] it for on the day Thou shalt e eat us
[1:41:15] thereof Thou shalt surely die and we see
[1:41:18] today the world is getting smarter the
[1:41:19] Bible will tell us it's second Timothy
[1:41:21] 3:7 he learning and never able to come
[1:41:25] to the knowledge of truth brother
[1:41:27] brandom says they're building Rockets
[1:41:30] they're sending Rockets up but still
[1:41:31] can't explain how a blade of grass is
[1:41:33] there they said instead of trying to
[1:41:36] find how the grass is there they're
[1:41:38] building Rockets up they're getting so
[1:41:40] smart but the smarter they get the
[1:41:42] further they get away from the
[1:41:44] supernatural oh my but God has given us
[1:41:47] something in this generation that is not
[1:41:49] driving us away from him but it's
[1:41:51] pulling us to him the Bible says in
[1:41:53] Ephesians 1:8 wherein he hath abounded
[1:41:56] toward us in all wisdom and Prudence
[1:41:59] having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:42:02] his will according to his good pleasure
[1:42:05] which he has purposed in himself oh
[1:42:08] Hallelujah and so once the mystery of
[1:42:11] God was revealed the revelation of who
[1:42:13] Christ was once we seen that we seen us
[1:42:16] we seen all the wisdom and uh SEC 1
[1:42:20] Corinthians 2 for and my speech and my
[1:42:22] preaching was not with enticing words of
[1:42:25] man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the
[1:42:28] spirit and of power that your faith
[1:42:31] should not stand in the wisdom of men
[1:42:33] but in the power of God that's right oh
[1:42:38] Hallelujah the seventh verse 1
[1:42:40] Corinthians 2: 7 for we speak the wisdom
[1:42:42] of God in a mystery even the hidden
[1:42:45] wisdom which God ordained before the
[1:42:48] world unto our Glory oh oh my but it's
[1:42:51] not a hidden wisdom anymore it's
[1:42:53] revealed it's an understanding that us

[1:48:14] hallelujah
[1:48:18] hallelujah amen
[1:48:21] just a we need the Lord more today than
[1:48:24] we ever have
[1:48:25] before or real humility acknowledging
[1:48:29] him as the Bible says acknowledge in all
[1:48:32] in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He
[1:48:35] Shall direct thy paths and it's one
[1:48:38] thing
[1:48:40] that the Lord is is leading us through
[1:48:43] the
[1:48:44] prophet is to the
[1:48:47] supernatural where we can believe for
[1:48:49] all all things all things as the prophet
[1:48:53] said he said Lord You're preparing the
[1:48:54] people to believe all
[1:48:56] things
[1:48:59] and I just I just believe that if
[1:49:02] there's ever a people that is
[1:49:03] experiencing Jesus Christ the same
[1:49:06] yesterday today and forever it's it's
[1:49:08] the bride of
[1:49:09] Christ we're in a time where demon
[1:49:14] powers are being
[1:49:17] manifested
[1:49:18] displayed more in this age than ever
[1:49:22] before it's the darkest age most evil
[1:49:24] age but there is a people that is
[1:49:27] Conquering and they're seeing God as the
[1:49:30] mighty conqueror simply because they're
[1:49:33] not following their own paths they're
[1:49:35] not they're not leaning to their own
[1:49:37] wisdom to their own understanding but
[1:49:40] they're holy holy following the Lord
[1:49:45] amen and I thought of brother Josh as he
[1:49:49] was talking about you know not knowing
[1:49:52] where the office would be and not
[1:49:55] knowing what would be in the office per
[1:49:57] se but someone would say hey let me show
[1:50:00] you where the office is and I thought
[1:50:03] that's what God would do in this age
[1:50:05] would send us a prophet to say let me
[1:50:08] show you let let me show you all about
[1:50:10] it they where you don't have to presume
[1:50:13] anymore and he's taken all of our
[1:50:15] pursuing away and the more we follow
[1:50:18] this message the more God has made open
[1:50:22] and real to us to where we don't have to
[1:50:24] presume what he is but we know by
[1:50:27] experience and I'm so glad for that amen
[1:50:31] oh do you love him I so love him really
[1:50:34] enjoyed the the service today and
[1:50:37] thought it just a wonderful kickoff for
[1:50:41] tomorrow night and the the rest of the
[1:50:44] meeting and we want to be under great
[1:50:47] expectation don't look at your problems

[1:52:38] brother Josh was preaching is brother
[1:52:40] brandham said if you want Power with God
[1:52:43] see how humble you can
[1:52:46] be the more humble your man can be but
[1:52:49] before the Lord the more power he can
[1:52:52] have with God can you say amen I have
[1:52:56] seen God do it many many time in our
[1:52:59] lives and just got to share a little bit
[1:53:02] with this
[1:53:04] pastor just what God has done in in our
[1:53:07] life you know as in our families growing
[1:53:11] up and with our children with uh just
[1:53:15] personal
[1:53:17] experiences uh God feeling the gas up
[1:53:21] with uh uh the truck up with gas times
[1:53:24] we didn't have food on the
[1:53:27] table pray and God would send somebody
[1:53:32] didn't even know
[1:53:33] them lived an hour
[1:53:36] away uh one time lived an hour away when
[1:53:40] Dad got through praying thanking God for
[1:53:43] supplying the needs knocked come on the
[1:53:46] door and there's this man said are you
[1:53:48] Mr Martin that says I am and he said
[1:53:52] well I don't know the whole you know
[1:53:54] what you're going through anything but
[1:53:56] says I just felt impressed to to buy
[1:53:59] groceries and I feel the Lord has led me
[1:54:03] here to this
[1:54:05] address and told me to give it to Mr
[1:54:08] Martin and just loads or sacks of
[1:54:13] groceries that happened time and time
[1:54:16] again times when we needed things times
[1:54:21] When Faith broke her ankle there in when
[1:54:26] was in Pennsylvania she her ankle snaap
[1:54:29] the bone was you know you know how it is
[1:54:34] and didn't have a car me and the boys

[1:54:41] car at the time and and uh didn't have a
[1:54:45] cell
[1:54:46] phone where she could call but my wife
[1:54:49] wife just laid hands on faith that ankle
[1:54:52] and begin to pray and that ankle popped
[1:54:56] back and Faith began to play around
[1:54:59] again times when
[1:55:02] Daniel uh just preaching at brother Roy
[1:55:06] got out of church and he had had his
[1:55:08] hand in our sliding door of the van and
[1:55:11] someone slammed the door shut and his
[1:55:13] hands in there and he's just crying and
[1:55:18] yelling and we open the door and you
[1:55:21] could just see it began to swell and
[1:55:24] there's black and blue and and we just
[1:55:27] began to pray and instantly quit crying
[1:55:30] the the color turned back to normal the
[1:55:32] only thing that there was was a line to
[1:55:35] show that it was done and what had
[1:55:37] happened time and time and time again it
[1:55:39] was just incredible and even just here
[1:55:44] just the other day just was in a in a
[1:55:48] situation that we needed the Lord needed
[1:55:50] the Lord in a in a worse way and didn't
[1:55:54] know how things were going to happen and
[1:55:57] just began to pray Lord I don't know
[1:55:59] what to do and God came through on the
[1:56:04] scene and met met the need that's just
[1:56:08] the god that we
[1:56:09] serve God is real he's alive and so I
[1:56:15] know that whatever you have need of God

[1:56:24] your ways amen you love him his ways are
[1:56:28] higher than our ways his thoughts are
[1:56:30] higher than our thoughts may not be able
[1:56:33] to figure God out but if we just humble
[1:56:35] ourselves and just say God you know how
[1:56:38] it is Lord just lead me just take care
