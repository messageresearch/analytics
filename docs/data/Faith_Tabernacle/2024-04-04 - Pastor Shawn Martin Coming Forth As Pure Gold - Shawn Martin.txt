trust you had a good time there in Louisiana amen and um if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to job the 23rd chapter and brother Andrew had asked me to greet you all uh tonight and so um praise the Lord and uh also just to remind you that uh sister Hannah and brother Chester is going to be getting married and uh that's going to be Sunday the uh 14th of this month and be uh just right after the regular morning service there and so if you're wanting to go we'll hang this this up in the back and um you can get the information addressed to their Church there and uh the reception is to follow at the uh Traditions Family Restaurant there and so anyways we're we're happy uh for them and just pray the Lord just blesses them abundantly and I tell you what I I uh this must be uh Love Fest or something um oh know uh there's uh I think seven that I know of that's gotten engaged and a couple of them that are looking to get engaged so God bless them all amen amen praise the Lord and um so uh there's going to be a lot of weddings this year that you can go to and enjoy the food and um and uh praise the Lord and amen but anyways uh before we go on the word let's just uh bow our heads and talk to our Lord precious Lord we're so glad to know who we are in you father and we don't count that lightly as there's so many in the world today that are groping in darkness trying to find their identity and looking to other things Lord to who attach themselves to but father youve sent a prophet our way and yes the lamb opening the book father and revealing who we are and Lord we're so thankful for it father we can go through the things of life everyday life father knowing that we've got a bright future ahead and oh father now I pray that you would just minister to every need that this evening bless your people father as you have laid this on my heart I feel and I pray that you would just anoint me and help me to get myself out of the way and may your people be anointed as well father we ask it now in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord um The Book of Job the 23rd chapter I believe and the 10th verse it says but he knoweth the way that I take when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold say that again he knoweth the way that I take and when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold amen you can have your seats this evening and um I want to maybe just speak on the subject of coming forth as pure gold and I trust it will be a help to you but um we know that that gold speaks of deity and um it is symbolizes deity and and so it fits Christ as the prophet said and one of the gifts that uh the the the wise men brought to Jesus uh when they worshiped him was gold and uh um it it identified uh as to who he was uh by by them bringing that they knew uh it showed they knew what kind of a child he was and and as Paul would tell us it was God in Christ amen reconciling the world unto himself but now it is Christ in you the hope of glory ain't that right and so then we know that God is coming for a bride and it's it's his bride and um and so uh uh which uh it's his bride because she is bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life and she is him and so only those who are part of this bride is going to be in the Rapture which we know is at hand uh any day the Rapture could take place and and this bride is going to be a word bride do you believe that now we would have never really understood that or known what kind of a bride that God was after except God would send a prophet to let us know exactly what kind of bride she's going to be and it's going to be a word Bride for he is the word groom now him being the word groom the the prophet said that Jesus so lived by the word or he so believed the word he was full of faith and he lived by the word till he became the word so so that that that that puts something with us because if it was for the groom it's for us that we we full of Faith Amen to to so live by the word till we become the word and and so brother brandom says she's fixing to bring forth the perfect word back there and the word is coming for the word bride and a woman is part of a man taken from him so the church will have to be a word abiding church every word of the Bible not systems dogmas or nothing added it'll have to be an adulterated uh unadulterated pure virgin word ain't that right so then if she's going to be the word bride then she will have to be the perfect match to every promise in this Bible that spoke of her so she is Justified amen she is is Sanctified she is filled with the Holy Ghost and and sealed but she will also be positionally placed within the body of of of Christ reflecting Christ ain't that right just as the moon uh is in her uh in its place positionally placed to reflect the light from the sun amen so is this bride amen being positionally placed to reflect the light of the s o n ain't that right amen so then Christ is the word so so her reflection is the word amen but he is the spirit that quickens the word amen to the individual the prophet said he is the spirit of the word amen so so we don't just take the word as a letter a dead letter for the letter kth ain't that right it's the spirit that gives life and so so so uh when when they say when they you know uh become formal and they become well you you've got two sides you've got the formal side and they're sophisticated and and uh you know they they they come on that side and and uh they're they're educated and then you got the other side that it's all Just Dance and hoop and holler and all of that and and you got both extremes but the bride has actually got both word and spirit amen she's got the word but then she has that spirit that is quickening the word to her ain't that right amen see so it's not knowledge that we're after it's the quickening power to Quicken that word amen within us and then we start becoming a reflection now so so the the prophet said the word itself is spirit it's spirit in word form see and then you see when it is quickened or brought to life the spirit of the word goes to work and acts amen so so we cannot have the Holy Ghost and not have the word amen had that's why brother Brown challenged you say you got the Holy Ghost you'll cut your hair women you you you say you got the Holy Ghost and and wearing your Brites women you you you know you you say you got the Holy Ghost and you're smoking your cigarettes and and you're drinking your beer and you're telling your dirty jokes and you're you understand what I'm saying the spirit quickens the word that's what we need is the spirit so now we know that this is the age of life that's what the prophet said it's the age of life it's the age where that God is requiring the token to be on display amen and the token is none other than the life of God Amen it's the literal life of Jesus Christ in The Believer now now that's where deity comes into the believer ain't that right amen see and so uh uh uh Jesus Christ uh on display in The Believer is the token and and then therefore if it's really Jesus Christ we're not talking uh of just an imagination we're actually talking of the nature of Jesus Christ the the character see the character is what of Jesus Christ is what is on display that's that's that's what this bride is to reflect ain't that right amen see and so the prophet said see God is looking for her character the character of Christ he's not looking for all the Fang dangles that she has she's not looking or he's not looking for all the fine qualities of gifts and and all of that he's looking for one thing and that's character which is his own character see that's the reflection ain't that right because we know that Satan can impersonate any gift that God's God Amen and so any gift can be questionable and and these things but when it comes to the the character of Jesus Christ being reflected amen then you know that's deity within the individual amen see so remember how they built the Great pyamid the prophet had talked about it uh several times but in this pyramid every stone was cut to prision it it was cut just right amen and it was placed exactly right to where uh the prophet even talked about it how that you couldn't even put a razor blade in between them and and it was such perfect uh uh and and of course uh uh the the the uh uh uh uh the the the pyramid was God's second Bible we know that the Stars was God's first Bible then the pyramid and then the written word ain't that right the written word as as the Bible amen that was God's third Bible but now now it's come to the word made flesh it it's come to a living word amen to where the word that that is that's in the stars that that speaks of the word the the pyramid that speaks of the word this that speaks of the word and they're all the word god telling the story now it's becoming made flesh in you and I and this is what Paul would tell us you are written Epistles read and known of all men so the prophet said the great Church of the Living God is Born Again Stones cut out aren't you glad for that we're we're not just stones but we're Stones cut out God has taken you for a purpose to fit you into the pyramid and we know that we're not at the base of the pyramid we're all the way right up in this the Capstone age ain't that right the Capstone which is Christ himself amen yes sir and so we we find and this is why the Paul would say they without us cannot be made perfect amen they were part of the pyramid they were part of the body they were part of the Bride amen but it took us they they waiting for us to make this thing perfect can you say Amen they had dips of the spirit they had dips of it and they manifested and they reflected part of the word amen a little bit here and a little bit there just a little light but in this day the fullness of light has come amen see and so we we find that we're Stones Born Again Stones cut out now now many come to the altar as the prophet would say about Billy Graham and and different ones and and and and making the altar call and and thousands would come up and they would make decisions they would make their decision to follow Christ or whatever and brother Bram said decision is all right decisions are is confession stones but what good does it do to have Stones if you don't have a stonemason to cut them out in the shapes of Sons and Daughters of God can you say Amen aren't you glad that it was more than just a confession that you made but God honored your confession God saw that confession he he saw your heart and he said now that's mine that's that was from from the book that I had wrote before the foundation of the world and he called you and he began to shape you as a stone and to cut you ain't that right amen see so now so so back again uh the prophet talking of elier Amen Abraham sending elier out to get a bride for Isaac the prophet said he swe it out he sweated it out he wasn't after just anybody he swe it out he was PR and oh God give me the right one send the right one let let me know her when he comes and and he she comes and but what he was looking for was character ain't that right so he sweated it out till he found character in Rebecca and then he had to get her dressed up ready let her stand still and listen at his message can you say Amen not some little giddy girl amen that that when she uh realized that she was going then she just takes off and goes somewhere El and trying to find him on her own but she knew that she it took him to lead her to her bridegroom can you say amen amen and she had enough character to sit there and to listen to the message he's sat there amen and hear the instruction of the message sit there and learn about what her future is can you say amen amen see so then God is looking for character and not membership amen see and so we we find that you remember that brother Bram talked about how that God showed him his ministry excuse me and and and and was his ministry was that of elaser Amen go get a bride for Isaac see and now notice and brother Brown said that's exactly what my Ministry is go get a bride go get a bride amen see a bride for who a bride for the the the the pope no the bride for a denominational bride no a bride for Christ can you say amen and only a prophet could come up with and get a word bride amen any any Theologian can get a bride for the pope and the Catholic church and the denominational bride amen but it took a Propet to call out a word bride amen dress her with a word can you say Amen now the prophet says I ain't looking for members I'm I'm looking for the pure in heart see somebody that'll believe the word amen that's what a prophet was looking for amen he traveled the world seven times around this world and and every night he's looking for somebody that'll believe the word amen the the people rejected him at the end of his uh his life uh uh uh he found no pulpits to to preach in cuz no one would accept accept him amen but it didn't matter to him amen he was on a mission find somebody that'll just believe the word amen that's right he said elzer looked and he thought oh I can't do this myself amen there's too much responsibility I'm see I I I realize the responsibility of finding Isaac a bride well see that that that's a type of the church see Christ Rebecca the type of the Bride so elaser got down on his knees and said God you have to help me and when he referred to God God helped him and he got character oh aren't you glad that the prophet wasn't relying upon his abilities he wasn't relying upon himself but every night he's saying God you got to help me amen and God helped him amen and this message is producing exactly what he was looking for character can you say Amen now see the bride's character comes from the word of God Amen and this message is what is cutting and shaping us into Sons and Daughters of God Amen this is why this message is so different and you young people you understand that amen this message ain't popular amen not everybody's going to understand this message they're not meant to understand the message why because this message is different from TD Jake and and Billy Graham and all Roberts and TL Osburn and and all the the millions of preachers and philosophers and the iians and doctors of divinity out there amen this is different for this message will cut you into Sons and Daughters of God that's exactly what God is looking for for this Rapture now we we find brother Braham said he's looking for the day for that bride to be formed now notice Hebrews 138 just exactly like it was like he was no wonder brother Braham kept saying he's the same yesterday today and forever same yesterday today and forever why because he that's what he was looking for in this age a bride that would be exactly like him amen that would look just like him have the character just like him he's the same yesterday today and forever that when you would put the two together they would be just alike with the same Ministry same character same quality same power same attitude same everything can you say amen amen it's God he says it's got to be his same flesh same bones Same Spirit same everything just exactly built up and then two then become one see not you and the bride or bridegroom and and bride but they become one can you say Amen just like Jesus said he that has seen me has seen the father how sayest thou show me the father can you sayen have I not been so long with you and you still don't know who I am amen now look where we're at in this age oh yes sir no wonder the Bible sir uh uh uh that the Bible says that this is a mirror that we're looking in a glass Darkly a mirror beholding the glory of the Lord can you say Amen so he says now they the two become one until the church becomes that they're not one see until they become same in everything Same Spirit same character same flesh same bones same word same see they're they're not one see see the character of him the word everybody say the word for this age must be molded she must be molded like he is ain't that right now notice what a prophet said character everybody say character is not a gift it's a victory character is not a gift it's a victory ain't that right a lot of things he gives us as gifts but not character character is molded within us see the word molds God's character to us the prophet said now I want to talk about our trials amen see it's hard to think that God Amen would try us and especially when we're going through the biggest trial of our life and and to really fathom that God is the one doing it now now Satan will get us convinced that God is doing it and so much that he turns it that God hates us God doesn't like us we've done something wrong we we've committed something and God's just dooming us and destroying us and all of that that that's that's just the lies of the devil amen but but we find job said when he hath when he hath tried me ain't that right but we know that God was not directly involved Amen in in the tri of of job he was not directly uh uh the cause of job's suffering amen but he did give Satan permission Amen to to test job amen Job 1 and 8 says the Lord said unto Satan behold all that he have is in thy power talking of job now now J remember Satan says well I well he if you go read the other uh previous up you know this verses amen that Satan appeared to God before God uh with the sons of God and and and God said where you been Satan oh i' just been going around you know and this and trying to tempt everybody and this and that and and and he getting everybody you know and he said well have you and God says have you considered my servant job so it was God that brought up job's name right and job had no idea that God was talking about him up there and and and uh to to the devil right and and so he was just having a good time at church and good time in life and just loving the Lord and just having an awesome time just all in Revival and God's up there amen uh uh willing and a dealing if you want to say it that way and and so we find that that Satan says oh yeah but you got a hedge about him you you know you I can't touch him amen but you you you you take that hedge off I'll get him to curse you in your face you know and and so this is where the Lord said unto Satan behold all that he hath is in thy power only upon himself put forth not to thine hand see and so Satan went from the presence of the Lord now what happens well the Revival ends for job right and uh uh uh feelings in for job and and and headaches start for job and and all chaos am man happens in job's life and family he lost his donkeys he lost the that that helped with the donkeys he lost the Sheep he lost the servants that helped with them sheep he lost you know he he lost everything he lost everything amen Bible says that his sheep his servants and all them got burned up and and and these things and then and this is all happening you know and and and and then on top of that his sons and daughters were all killed amen see and and and so in in job 1:20 we read how job reacted upon hearing all of this news and it seemed like it was just happening one after another have you ever just had trials like that where it's just like woo you know oh no what do I do and and and and the Bible says that job arose rent his Manel shaved his head fell down upon the ground and Bate no he didn't belly ache he worshiped and all that was going on he worshiped and said neaked I came out of my mother's womb and neaked shall I return thither the lord gave and the lord taketh away blessed be the name there was no accusation in job amen toward God there was no bitterness Amen in job toward God there was no walking away from God no he blessed the name of the Lord can you say Amen in the trials that he went through now so you think that been good enough right but no no no no so so here it goes again Satan re now returns back to God and and they're talking a little bit and and and of course job God already knew that job you know never denied him never cursed him never done all these things and and so we we find then then Satan says now if you'll give me his life let me let me let me just deal with him a little bit I've taken his sons I've taken his money I've taken his house I've taken it all but you let me deal with him let me let me put some plagues on him amen let let let me afflict his body let me afflict his spirit amen I'll get him to curse you amen God said okay let's do it that way then so behold he is in thine hand job 2:6 the Lord said unto Satan behold he is in thine hand but save his life have you ever just thought of why you're still living amen because God tells Satan you can do what you want to with him but don't you take his life can you say amen amen see but save his life so Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord and smoked job with sore balls from the soul of his foot unto his crown ain't that right now job must have been in such Agony and such pain and and of course he was forsaken by everybody that his his accusers and God would allow this now he had three accusers tell him everything of what he done wrong against God Amen right in the middle of the trial right in the middle of the situation he ain't got no help from all these guys ain't that right amen see and and we find amen that it must have been so bad that even his own wife told him Curse God and die job let's just get it all with it what a helpmate right amen no no encouragement patting him on the back and say buddy you can go on I I've heard you preach I've heard you sing I know God's for you buddy don't you worry about that honey bunny you know oh no no you just Curse God and die let's get it over with I you know I don't know what it was in her mind but anyways amen so maybe she just thought she could live alone without him right amen but see but but we find that that God proved to Satan that that job didn't serve him just because everything was going his way amen now we find in Romans 15 and4 it says for whatsoever things were written a fourth time were written for our learning everybody say it's written for our learning that we through fa patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope now think of that that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures these scriptures ought to be your comfort amen when you're going through the trials when you're going through hell when when it seem like everything is against you amen you ought to find the comfort in these scriptures so many people put their Bibles up and and start into the news and and start into the magazines and start into this and that as if they're going to find Comfort Amen in their trial this ought to be your comfort God wouldn't have put these in in word form if he didn't have it for our comfort that's rightl can you say Amen so the story of job's suffering is for our learning that we through faith and P or patience and comfort might have hope but see so Satan couldn't have touched job in the way that he did if God hadn't GI given him permission to do so can you say Amen why do you think Satan was created in the first place I believe God gives us the answer Amen in Isaiah 54:15 behold they shall surely gather together but not by me whosoever Shall Gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake behold I have created the Smith that bloweth the coals of the fire and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work and I have created the waster to destroy can you say Amen see so God in his wisdom God in his his in his his his way of doing things and it's the perfect way of doing things he created the devil Amen to to to send you through the trials amen he he created the devil Amen to to work upon you can you say amen amen well it it's true amen everything that Satan does is only to magnify God Amen we wouldn't know God as a Healer except amen somehow there was a sickness and who calls the sickness the devil calls the sickness amen the devil calls the fall the devil was de setfull called sin to happen the devil done all these things amen not God that God would allow it that he could be glorified can you say Amen so then job knew that he was in God's hands and that God was completely aware of what he was going through and where he was at amen so that's why he would attribute it uh uh that when he hath tried me amen see God was allowing it amen but job knew that he was perfectly safe in the hands of God oh my for God is a faithful God God is always mindful of his elect do you believe that amen first Peter 3 and12 the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers can you say Amen now we read in Revelations and two where God says I Know Thy Works he's talking I believe to the sardes sardian age and he says I Know Thy works and tribulation and po poty so they're going through these things amen of tribulation and amen and if you study the the church ages you'll understand that this was not just a little snotty nose that they were having or a little flu amen that they were going through amen this was a real persecution that they were going through they were really suffering they they were going through the fire they they they were really amen being going through the ringer and yet God would tell them it's not that I don't know I know what you're going through I Know Thy tribulation I Know Thy poverty can you say amen that's right and the prophet says see amen look look he's walking in between he's walking in the midst of the church walking back and forth ain't that right he said see walking up and down in the midst of his church like a father he is looking down upon his family he is the head of the household he is the provider he is the protector now notice that he's the provider and yet he's looking at the him and saying I Know Thy poverty he is the protector and he says I Know Thy tribulation yet he looks on their poverty how he says oh how the untutored believer stumbles at that see how can God bear to look upon his own in a time of need and not just stop it all and just give in and lavish everything material upon them amen how can he be a gracious God and see his people suffering and in in need of of food in need of things that they were going through they were in poverty and God is just saying I know I know I know I know I know instead of lavishing all this materialistic things upon them he just sits back and he says I know what you're going through you see he could have kept them from tribulation if he wanted to but he didn't he could have kept them from poverty but he didn't and and the prophet says now this this is where you have to believe in the love and goodness and wisdom of God can you say Amen don't just talk about the love of God but look now he's a wise God also amen ain't that right he's a good god also but his goodness is not the way we would consider goodness his wisdom is not the ways the wisdom of man so you now you have to believe in his love you have to believe in his W wisdom and you have to believe in his goodness in times like this amen can you say Amen now job knew that God was faithful and that God was not allowing this to destroy him right the Bible says no weapon formed against the shall prosper this was written that we might take comfort in them can you say Amen it was written for our learning that no weapon formed against you is going to prosper yeah amen amen ain't that right now did you notice how can it not Prosper is because there is an eternal quality about the elect of God Ephesians 1:4 according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy without and Without Blame before him in Love Now notice the prophet said this means that we were right there with him in the mind and thoughts of God before the foundation of the world and that gives an eternal quality to the elect you can't get away from that Satan can't get you away from that the trials can't get you away from that amen tribulation cannot get you away from that no matter where you're at it cannot get you away from that you've got an eternal quality about you for you were in the mind of God and chosen in him before the foundation of the world amen amen can you say Amen so joob knew that God was in charge of the situation amen now now he did not give Satan amen full control God remained control can you say amen God remained in control if if I hope you understand he knew that God was in charge God was at the helm he knew that God was allowing everything to happen to him or he wouldn't have been going through it I want you to understand that now God wouldn't have allowed them things to happen amen if he didn't want you to go through them things that's how big God is don't you think that God or Satan can override God in anything can you say Amen you must take comfort in the promises of God you must take comfort in the scriptures King amen well that's true now now notice he says now when Heath tried me I shall come forth as gold amen see now thinking thinking of that what job just said I shall come forth as gold now notice what God says when he addressed this lay otsy and age Revelations 3:17 because thou sayest I am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched miserable poor blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me what gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and and notice now he's talking about it in this age you are the people that that we're we we are of the scripture now he's talking of course to the world Amen and he's bid the the the leay osia come unto me come unto me I challenge you I I bid you to come unto me and buy of me go try it in the fire amen see that thou may be rich now there is such a thing as as what is called uh iron pyite which is a Fool's Gold that's right and uh could you imagine being out there in the gold mine and you're digging and digging you know you read them books and how man it must have been one hard thing to do dig with your pickaxe you know no sh no no tractors no nothing you're just digging and and and doing the best you can and and and whatever you're doing or maybe out in the streams or whatever but you're looking for gold and and you see that gold and and you see something shiny in that little nugget and buddy you're excited man and then you get all this you you know you might get a little handful of gold and oh buddy you're rich now you know and and and so you you're you're way out in the mountain now you got to take it all the way out in the out to town you know and and and so buddy you grab that old you know old Betsy on that mule and and you got your guns all you know if it was me I'd be loaded all over with guns you you know just waiting cuz I know I just struck I struck gold you know and and and and I know there's someone out there that don't want to dig is but as big as I have and and hard work as hard as I have and I've got the gold and he just wants you know he wants a free meal and kill me and you know so man you know and and you no doubt you had to probably Camp you know a couple days you know out on the on the road and and but you're staying up all night with that gun you know just guarding that gold you know and uh uh no one going to get my gold and and and and then you make it to town you know but you're hiding that around everywhere just looking around you don't want anybody see that gold you know you're a richet man and and and you get down to the bank and and and you're like um can I find a room or somewhere cuz I got gold and and and and and you know and and everybody woo gold you know and and then that that you know the guy that's going to inspect that goat says well let let me look at it and he don't just seem excited as much as you might be and and you like man he's a he's a he's a jerk you know he should be excited with me he saids let me see that I need to examine well it's gold I'm telling you it's gold you know I I'm the one that dug for it it's shiny it does all that stuff man you know there ain't no need to no need to inspect that stuff well I need to inspect it see and and you know and then then he comes back out and and only to tell you it's Fool's Gold oh my now what that means is you've been fooled you stayed up all night for no reason you you you thought you were Rich for nothing you had all that plan for that jagar and you know Bahamas and all these things and and he's over there trying to tell you it's Fool's go you want to slap him upside the head you just ain't going to believe that right but you know the prophet talks about how that that the real the Fool's Gold outshines the real gold and it looks like gold but it's not see and so a man can be fulled now now he he talks about it in the old days that that uh uh the way they could tell the difference between uh the the real gold and Fool's Gold is that that the smelter amen would would take this piece of gold and he would beat it and he would beat it and he would beat it it and he would beat it and he would just keep beating and beating and beating and beating and and and all after a while stuff started flaking off the things that you thought was gold started just chipping away chipping here and chipping here and and and and the smelter ain't he ain't discouraged at all he just keeps beating and he beating and he beating and the prophet says now the way he really knows that he got gold is he beats it till he gets all that Fool's goat off gets all that sludge off and he can actually see his reflection in the goat can you amen see so then that that's where he knew amen that he had gotten gold now now I'm going to say it just ahead of time that God isn't fooled amen by by people's worship he's not fooled by people's confessions he's not full the Bible says the foundation of God standeth sure the Lord knoweth them that are his can you say amen amen but see he's got to get away get all that pie right off of us Amen to where he can see his true reflection get all that flesh out get all the human out get everything out amen we know that Satan can impersonate we know that people could sit in a church and be as as sinner as sinner can be and still dancing and shouting and all of that God's not interested in your worship amen if it's Fool's go God's not interested in all the songs that you sing and write if it's Fool's Gold God's not good interested in all that fine preaching amen you can preach till everybody standing up and woohoo and hollering if it's Fool's Gold can you say Amen brother you see what was real remained so now job says I shall come forth as gold and I'm I might to that gold tried in the fire as gold tried in the fire now I want you to listen now amen Isaiah 13 and6 how ye and uh for the day of the Lord is at hand and it shall come as a destruction from the almighty therefore shall all hands be faint and every man's heart shall melt and and they shall be afraid pains and Sorrows shall take hold of them they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth they shall be amazed at one another see and their faces shall be as flames behold the day of the Lord cometh cruel both with wrath and fierce anger to lay the land desolate and he shall destroy the Sinners thereof out of it amen for the the stars of Heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light see the sun shall be darkened in is going forth and the moon shall not uh cause uh her light to shine and I will punish the world for their evil evil and the wicked for their iniquity and I will cause the arrogancy of The Proud to cease and will lay low in uh the hotess of the terrible amen now this is the Tribulation that he he that that this is prophecy of the tribulation that we know is right at hand amen we see the the effect starting to happen now man people's losing their minds and everything's going whacko even nature is going crazy amen because this is exactly what is going to happen but notice the 12th verse I will make a man more precious than fine gold even a man than golden the Golden wedge of ofir Amen see amen therefore I will shake the heavens and the Earth and shall remove out of her place amen see in the Wrath of the Lord of hosts and in the day of his Fierce anger amen see but in this now notice as as he's saying all of these things about the tribulation yet he lets us know there in this age that we're living in there is a bride that's going to come forth pure as gold can you say amen amen see she's going to be be made precious than find gold see now what makes gold precious in the first place it is rare you can't just buy it off the off the off the shelves it's a rare Jewel amen see and and that's what makes this precious now the the prophet said there's going to be very few that make it in this bride amen but I'm going to tell you what kind of a bride she is she's going to be made up and this bride is going to be more precious than gold can you say Amen she's going to be as the gold that is tried in the fire amen oh yes sir now notice now in in in 1 Peter 1:7 amen that the trial of your faith everybody say the trial of my faith see now see being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto the praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ this bride is going to be made ready amen come on church this bride is going to be a ready bride amen this bride is going to be one that is it it when God comes and he's looking at her and say oh man I've come she disappoint oh no she ain't going to disappoint him oh no no no no God chose you and he's cutting you he's molding you and there will be a reflection of him through you Amen on this Earth that's exactly right now your trials don't mean that you ain't got faith come on now you say well I've been praying the Lord to heal me and just I must not have that Faith oh that's a lie that doesn't mean anything like that I understand it takes Faith amen for you to get healed amen but a lot of times and sometimes amen God will allow you to remain that way and see what you'll do about it you going to sit there and talk negative you're going to sit there and act like you're dying come on now yes sir now notice so so this gold amen that we're we're coming to becoming coming forth as gold is not as the gold that perisheth see now notice what the prophet said the gold of God everybody say the gold of God is a Christlike character the gold of God is a Christlike character produced in the fiery furnace of Affliction amen can you say amen that's right now if you look and remember gold represents deity right the prophet says the organized churches of this Le Odyssey and age now remember it's in this age that he says buy of me gold tried in the fire but notice he's talking to a people and he says now see the organized churches of this Le Odyssey and age has the worldly gold that will perish it is Rich it is complacent it has made affluence in other words wealth the major Criterion of spirituality the evidence of God's blessings and the correctness of Doctrine Etc is now based upon how many Rich folks are involved in it can you say Amen but the prophet says they have gold but it's the wrong kind of gold and remember when when here is a a a people a church natural that has all this gold the wealth ain't that right and they have accumulated all of this yes sir and and and they've gained Power by this and yet when God reads it and when God looks at him he says you're wretched blind poor and naked don't even know it and it's in this that he says come and buy of me gold Lord if you want gold come and buy of me amen tried everybody say tried in the fire amen see now the prophet said see the gold they have buys men's lives and destroys them it's a gold that warps and twists human character for its love is the root of all evil can you sayen so but it's in this day of Le osia that we hear a voice come out of her my people I've got a gold come out of her that's right thank youus am Hallelujah aren't you glad you come [Music] out thank you we come into this world physically naked but when we leave this world will not go out spiritually Naked Brother Bram says every one of us is going to take something with us and that is our character it's the only thing that we'll be able to take with us notice what he says we had better be real careful now to see that we take something that will make us right before God Amen what kind of character will you take with you will it be like his whose character was molded by suffering in the fiery furnace of Affliction or will it be the softness of this characterless lotan people can you say Amen yes see if if if if you want to the easy route that's exactly what Le oosa is that's the people of the age that they're they're characterless people they don't want to go through trials remember it's the age of people's rights don't you tell me what to do that preacher preacher don't you tell me what Pastor don't you Pastor me I'm own person can you say amen I I got the Holy Ghost I know what I'm doing see but it's a characterless generation see oh man we we don't want to go through the trials we we look if God loves us he's going to vindicate us we look and we we act like the the the two disciples amen that wanted to call fire down from heaven upon these these Renegades that didn't treat him right can you say amen and then all of a sudden when we go through moments of crying when we go through moments of loneliness when we go through moments of confusion when we go through moments of feeling rejected we feel like God has already forsaken us can you say Amen but see will it be like his whose character was molded by suffering in the fiery furnace of Affliction or will it be the softness of this characterless leoty and people now notice in another place he says see the church owns such a phenomenal wealth see that at any time notice the power that she has with this wealth she owns the church owns such phenomenal wealth that at any given time she can take over the entire world's system of Commerce buddy she's doing it amen amen she's doing it yeah and indeed a leader in the world Council of churches has openly prophesied that the church in the foreseeable future should could and will do just that but their golden Tower of Babel shall fall amen only the gold tried in the fire shall endure say Amen this gold that he's offering them is himself deity living in flesh the gold your money your wealth your materialistic things are going to die out amen yes can you say Amen but I'm giving you a gold I give you myself and the church kicks him out amen name only the gold tried and the fire shall endure and that is what the church has constantly done Through the Ages she has left the word of God and taken her own Creeds and dogmas she has organized and joined herself to the world thus she is naked and God is judging her lewdness and the only way she can get out of this dread situation is by B obeying the word of the Lord to come back to his word can you sayen and what is that word come out of her my people think of that Amen in a rich nation in a rich world world and when when when when when the power of wealth is here amen and God is saying come by of me then we're hearing this come out of her my people amen that's right now it's by the message of the hour that we could only come out don't think you can come out by some commentary you cannot come out by by some Theologian not some philosophy not psychology you you couldn't come out by any of that it took a prophet to call us out and that Prophet would be a prophet of Malachi 4 that would turn our hearts back to the word can you say amen and not just to the word of some man's idea but the original word remember the prophet amen he says I've read this you know Clark and I've read you know pink and I've read this and I've read that and I've read this and he and he and he was going to take some of their thoughts amen even on the seals amen he said I even had thoughts of my own but then he came down why it's back to the original word that no man could have ever come up with no man I don't care how much schooling how smart how anointed it took a prophet to take us back to the original word hallu take us back not to a form of Doctrine not to another form of religion but we're being transformed by the renewing of our mind transformed can you say Amen now notice the prophet said the trouble of it is today when you find character it's hard to make them stand still long enough to put on clothes and get dressed up that's right see some little Ricky doesn't pull them off in some other direction it's hard to preach truth anymore because you got all these ideas out there and and they get mad they just go to somewhere else amen they'll quit Church they'll do this they'll do that it's hard to get people to stand still amen and tell character is really reflected in them now notice the trial and sufferings that job went through it did not change the mind of God about him at all bless the Lord and God saved you Sanctified you filled you with the Holy Ghost and there's not one time that he has ever changed his mind about you thank God thank God hello praise God a truth that must root in our soul yes sir he will allow you to go through hell but he hadn't changed his mind about you that's right I'm thankful thank you Jes there's something that he's after amen amen yes sir prise the Lord can you say amen amen hope this all right now notice job 23:13 but he is of in one mind everybody say he is in one mind now this is a man that has gone through suffering this is a man that's gone through just just turmoil this is a man that has went to the bottom of the barrel and like I say even his own wife is now encouraging him give it up die Job Curse God Walk Away From Him and notice what job says but he is in one mind who can turn him right what his so desireth even that he doeth for he performeth a thing that is appointed for me you go and many such things are with him now notice the the the prophet said God harnesses trouble puts bit bits in its mouth and makes it obey him that's ain't that right now if you look job 1:22 it says and in all of this job sinned not nor charged God foolishly can you say Amen now there's your bride there's the bride right there they go through hell they go through the Flames they go through water they go through suffering they go through turmoil they go through trial after trial after trial after trial and yet in all of it they never sin against God in other words they never give up in in in disbelief and and and give up on their faith to God and they never never ever charge God foolishly Hallelujah can you say Amen now you're talking about getting down to real gold amen could you imagine what would happen to you if Satan was actually in charge of what happens to you in your for your future and you sayen but if we actually have this understanding of God and that he is in charge of everything that comes our way then we can actually rest oh God help us rest that's the Christian Life is rest rest rest rest rest God never tells us what you were going to go through before we go through it he just says rest rest can you say amen he gave you the holy ghost that you could rest rest ain't that right amen see we can rest in every promise that God has given us amen they were written for our learning and our comfort so you know let's look at it now because God has actually made promises for us when we go through trials he already knew you going to go through trials listen now he already knew it he you you ain't going to be babied no no no no God ain't your granddaddy no God ain't the guy that's got the candy bars and the ice cream and all that every time you show up to his house amen amen can you say Amen you're going to go through trials but notice he gives us the promises Isaiah 54:17 no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper every tongue then that shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and the righteousness is of me sayith the Lord amen 1 Corinthians 10:13 there hath no temptation taken you amen but such as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able can you say amen he will not put something on you that you cannot bear so if you start cursing God if you walk away from God it's your fault sir can you say Amen cuz he promised that he would not put anything upon us that we cannot bear so we can't just go around me I just don't know and I'm talking about all of us now can you say amen he said see amen but we everybody say but will God will with the Temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to Bear it that tells us that the trials ain't there to destroy you the grace of God is with you that you may be able to Bear [Music] Hallelujah Romans 8:27 and we know that all all things work together for the good to them that love him love God to them who are called according to his purpose see these are promises can you say Amen not for Comfort when you're in the on the mountain top these are for written for your learning and for your comfort in The Valleys can you say Amen now notice what job went through was for his good it was and you could read the whole chapter and find out amen but here's one verse job 42:5 I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now everybody say but now my eye seeth thee what did he do in the trials he got a revelation of his Redeemer oh my but it took the trial for him to get there amen he had been hearing of him he had been uh uh learning of him but now he saw him it was for his good the Lord hallelujah see those troubles the prophet said that God allows to come our way brings us into a closer fellowship with God if Noah hadn't been pressed into the condition that he was in to float for 40 days and nights in a storm and that little Ark pitching and forward and backwards and rocking and and all of these things see but yet it took that before he could see the rainbow before he could see the rainbow sister Martha what was that rainbow it was a covenant of Promise can you say amen amen but it took all that that tossing and the turbulence and the turmoil and being there in the stink with the with the animals and all that but God brought him through and he SS the rainbow amen it took the flood to produce the rainbow the prophet said see amen the rainbow stands as a covenant of Hope the Covenant of Promise see and after he had went through the tribulation talking of job he saw the promise see that's the way you see the Promise after you've gone through the tribulation a lot of times we ask for God to give us Revelation let us get more amen but you understand that it takes the trials it takes the turmoils it takes the amen the things that we it lot these things doesn't come easy can you say amen I look at you Elders that you have gone through amen and maybe you're standing there and and and many times as a as a young man I would look at my elders I'd say I'd like to be like that I'd like to be that you know but I but but now I'm understanding amen for them to get there they had to go through the rocking and the turmoil and the ripping and the and the agony and the tears and the crying and the the suffering but they stood can you say Amen they stood a lot of times of our a lot of times a lot of times my sermons are made of of trials that I had to go through told the Lord Lord I've told the Lord for years Lord make me a man of prayer I want to be a man of prayer I believe God's heard me I thought it would be just an anointing come and sweep over me and I just all of a sudden he just waves that magic oneand and I just become a man of prayer trials drive you to your knees agonies drive you to your knees loneliness drives you to your knees heartbreaks drive you to your knees amen the trials that are upon you drive you to your knees can you say Amen see God is after the end product he's not after what you think you ought to be amen when you first become a Christian when I first become a Christian I thought I'd r that oh no no no God saw something that he wanted out of Shawn Martin and it took a lot of crying for and the shedding of tears and God why I don't understand amen and the and the loneliness and Satan talking to me and saying see give it up give it up give it up God don't love you you crossed the line and all of these things but I'm still here amen because there is a gold that God is after he's purifying us and we're coming forth as pure gold Christlike character Christlike character Christlike character amen there's things that maybe we handled down the road that we maybe wish we could have redone but now God has put us in a place he going to mold you he going to put you on the wheel he going to shape you he's going to mold you until Christ be formed in you Christ be [Music] formed amen amen that's true Prophet said we ask for comfort and peace God gives us the best he could give us trials and tribulations now notice what he says the prophet only could tell us and comfort us he said that's better than comfort and peace what my heart rending and I feel like I can't go anywhere and I'm standing here feeling like that man that had that dream standing all alone I can't see the other Footprints and that's better than comfort and peace think about it Oh my he said see our Comforts just beyond the river can you say man Hallelujah see it was after the Hebrew children was forced into one of their most outstanding trials the prophet said that they seen one liking the Son of God standing among them oh church if you only understand we are the bride of Christ she is him she is him and it's not him being reflected by our own abilities our own talents he's molding his cow character see according to the scriptures we must be tested and tried that's right Romans 816 the spirit beareth witness the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs Heirs of God and join HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him why do we need to suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for I reckon now I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us this is a man that's not just writing amen and and living out in the Bahamas this is a man that has been beaten this is a man that has been stoned to death this is a man that has been rejected where he says all Asia has forsaken me Demus have forsaken me this is a man that has gone blind amen because of being in prison most of his ministry this is a man that had to borrow somebody's coat this is a man whose letters had to be written by somebody else than his own hand and yet he's saying but this is for our good that the glory of the Lord may be revealed amen praise the Lord bless his name brother Ram says unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him see you have to suffer everybody say I have to suffer and I'm not talking about self- Affliction don't go around cutting yourself and punching yourself in the nose we have to suffer to rain the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character cannot Reign because power power apart from character is satanic and how are we seeing that in the world today but Power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share he wants us to share his own Throne see on the same basis that he overcome and is sit down in his father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and the little the little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation much tribulation yes Jesus this is why God stands by and lets us go through suffering did not Jesus have to suffer amen he had to suffer Hebrews 5'8 I'm going to let you go but though he were a son yet he learned obedience by the things which he suffered amen and being made perfect he became the author the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him so the very character of Jesus was perfected by his suffering can you say amen and the prophet said and he he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection amen this is why Paul would tell us in Hebrews 12 12 and 5 and and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despised not amen the the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth amen and and and scores every son whom he receiveth see so it's God's love to you that he would send you through the trials why because he knows what you are he know he gave you the Holy Ghost bill Amen Brother Bill amen for a reason amen it's himself now he wants to be reflected through us his character his life his nature amen amen amen amen God hasn't promised us a flowery bed of ease Amen brother Bram said what he has promised is a lot of mountains sir but he also promised us Grace to go over over every one of them Lord can you say amen he says and every child of God has to be child trained take some weapons and straighten up he said you know how to act then how to conduct yourself as a Christian see God gives you a little bit of whipping once in a while turns you around a few times and you know what it's all about see lays you on your back so you can look up ain't that right see so therefore we talk about being Messiah Ed we talk about being Miss Jesus Christ we talk but see the character amen the only way it can be perfected through us is through suffering can you say amen amen that's right see he gives you Prophet says he gives you trial after trial test after test trial after trial test after test until the Life of Christ is reflected in your life until you become peaceful sober Meek gentle humble ready submissive willing turn your head from the things of the world and looking straight to Calvary to the one who's doing the beating amen see many times you think it's strange because fiery trials and sickness and persecutions but it's only done to test you to get the dirt out of you to get the sludge out of you to get the slow out of you amen see to wake you up to the place where you can look and see the reflection or men can see the reflection of Christ in you for it is today Christ in you you Christ in you everybody say it's Christ in me the hope of glory and that is not just a by word god means it God sees it God filled you with himself and now he's going to make you suffer to build that character to where it can be [Music] reflected his name that's true no more saying well I got the Holy Ghost cuz I danced on on oh I'm on my way to heaven because I just feel goosebumps you love the Lord amen amen James 1 and 2 my brethren count it all joy when you fall into diverse Temptation count it all joy knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect in Tire wanting or lacking nothing amen 1 Peter 4:12 beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you but rejoice in as much as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also with exceeding Joy oh a joy that is beyond the world could give you it's a joy amen that money can't buy it's a joy that no vacation can give you it's a joy it's a joy you've gone through the suffering you've endured the hardships you've you've gone you stayed faithful you your patience have have come out now amen because you had that faith and the trying of your faith that oh the glory of God is being revealed in US brother brah says is it strange that God wants us to develop a Christlike character that comes through suffering no sir see and we all have trials we are all tried and chastened as sons and no one but goes through that and the church that is not suffering and is not being tried hasn't isn't of God can you say amen and he says oh we need the Lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and be Christlike in doing it Lord hallelujah God teaches can you say Amen we could go on and on and on I thought of how that you know the world today they they they look for emotions they look for feelings they look for security they look it's it's like a pacifier and if you're not careful if you're not careful this is what the the the the Apostolic Pentecostal was is is they they look to the gifts as a pacifier oh they go through trials oh if someone could just just prophesy good over me oh if I could just feel the Lord and so they go and the Bible says they go run to and fro trying to find the word of the Lord and and we find that oh if they could just have a dream of me if they could just prophesy but see here's a bride that's been tried she's a word bride and as she's going through the trials she doesn't need a dream she doesn't need someone to prophesy she doesn't need someone to you know to speak words of Peace over she's got the peace of God she's got the word she's standing purely on thus sayith the Lord can you sayen I thought of my dad he's he's not had any dreams about him being healed he's not had any Vision saw about him getting healed he's not had any Prophecies of him getting healed he's not had everybody applaud him of him getting healed he's not had any songs written about him about getting healed he's not had any of that but one thing he does is he stands upon on thus sayth the Lord and his confession is still the same by his stripes I am healed by his stripes I am healed and we see the man going through the Affliction but all we can know and all I see is God purifying and he's going to come forth as gold he's going to come forth amen and see that's what it is amen more than your singing ability God wants to show that the show the devil that you can stand through the midst of all hell you can stand when he's putting everything against you and everything's going opposite of you and you're you might be flat broke you might be sick as sick as a dog and all of that but they're something down inside of you blessed be blessed be blessed be the name of the Lord amen that's where the bride is she's a word bride her faith is up on this amen and the trying her for Faith absolutely is working patience amen that's the truth you love him it's why the prophet said even though the doctor if the doctor told you today that you'd be dead by Monday you'd laugh in that doctor's Faith face if you had that perfect Faith you wouldn't need nothing else you have that perfect Faith amen amen God said so amen it's all that matters amen if you musicians will come How Great Is Our God Amen you love the Lord amen Prophet said God is testing his people getting them ready he said see before you buy a team of horses you go out and test them check them let them pull a while run them and see if they're wind broken got lemons in their nose and so forth he oh you didn't know you put lemons in their nose for a wind broken horse you do about your automobile see you Doctor it up with with castor oil and fine oils in the motor real thick and take the knocka out of it so that they can sell it all these other things see it's testing and God puts his children through the testings I'm so happy for it so he can show his love to you amen God putting you through testing brother Tim all he's doing is showing his love to [Music] you praise the Lord I like I I like this and and 2 Corinthians 4:17 Paul said for our light [Music] Affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory while we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal can you say Amen do you see what God really sees in US is eternal etal things amen Eternal value there's things about us that are temporary that need to go that come from the common born sinful man our sinful nature our sinful ways that old adamic nature carnal mind it's got to go that all that fool's go got to go because there's something Eternal that's of more value amen can you say amen that's right oh do you love him can you lift
