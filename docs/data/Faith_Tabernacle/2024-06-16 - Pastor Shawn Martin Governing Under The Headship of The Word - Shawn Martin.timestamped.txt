[46:35] doctrines um and uh they're they're
[46:38] they're struggling they're trying to
[46:40] find the the right balance to things and
[46:44] so we just want to keep brother Andrew
[46:47] in prayer that the Lord would just use
[46:50] him in a ESP special way to preach the
[46:53] the the the message and may the people
[46:56] be able to grasp it amen amen praise the
[47:01] Lord um if you have your Bibles we're
[47:04] going to turn to 1 Corinthians the 11th
[47:10] chapter this might be a little different
[47:13] um for a Father's day but hopefully um
[47:17] it uh will be of an encouragement to you
[47:20] and some
[47:24] way but um
[47:27] before we read the the word maybe we
[47:31] just bow our heads and talk to the
[47:34] author of the
[47:36] word Lord
[47:38] Jesus we come to you Lord a needy
[47:44] people
[47:45] father we're realizing more that we live
[47:49] that without you we're
[47:51] nothing and father we know that you like
[47:54] it that way to where where we become
[47:57] dependent upon you for
[48:00] everything father we yield ourselves to
[48:03] you we want to surrender everything that
[48:06] we are all of our talents all the gift
[48:11] everything that you've given us Lord we
[48:13] give it back to you that you could use
[48:15] us and I pray that you would do it so
[48:19] today that you would speak through this
[48:21] Mortal lips father and that you would
[48:23] speak to your people the words of life
[48:27] father as we stand here realizing how
[48:31] sacred this position is Lord and I pray
[48:36] father that you would bless your people
[48:40] and may the word that goes forth be
[48:42] planted into every heart father May the
[48:46] spirit follow that Lord and cause the
[48:49] word to
[48:50] prosper father I pray that you would
[48:52] bless every father here every daddy Lord
[48:55] that is serving you
[48:57] God just grant them the desire of their
[49:00] heart and fill their soul with joy and
[49:06] peace
[49:07] Father God I I just ask just a special
[49:11] blessing for them we ask it in Jesus
[49:14] Christ's name and the church says am
[49:18] amen and
[49:20] amen uh 1 Corinthians the 11th chapter
[49:24] first verse will start there says now I
[49:27] Praise You Brethren that you remember me
[49:30] in all things and keep the ordinance
[49:33] that I delivered them or as I delivered
[49:36] them to you but I would have you know
[49:39] that the head of every man is Christ and
[49:42] the head of the woman is the man and the
[49:45] head of Christ is God Amen you can have
[49:50] your seats this
[49:51] morning and um I guess the title
[49:57] that I would uh use um is governing
[50:02] under the headship of the word governing
[50:06] under the headship of the word we
[50:09] are thinking of Father's Day we we are
[50:12] living in a uh in the age where the role
[50:17] of husband and
[50:20] father um has nearly become extinct
[50:27] um the role of of husband father has
[50:30] been
[50:31] diminished uh to to to where that the
[50:36] the man is just a figurehead in the
[50:40] home and sad to say that we've got a
[50:45] Generation Um that doesn't know really
[50:48] or understand the role that uh a father
[50:54] and husband plays within the home
[50:57] and the value of
[50:59] it but no matter what man does uh God
[51:04] has ordained it to be so and he has
[51:08] never changed his mind of uh what man is
[51:12] to be and so uh and and I I'm glad to
[51:18] know that God still has men that are
[51:21] fulfilling his will and and purpose uh
[51:26] now the the brother brandham said that a
[51:29] man is to be the head of the family he's
[51:33] the head of his
[51:35] house and um of of course that isn't to
[51:39] be taken
[51:41] lightly uh that that doesn't mean that
[51:44] we're Macho or even any
[51:47] greater um um than than uh our house uh
[51:55] family uh but it's still the the role
[51:59] that God has ordained for man to to to
[52:03] have now headship it's it's this is what
[52:08] we're talking about this morning but
[52:10] headship is a principle of the kingdom
[52:13] of God that involves god-given roles and
[52:19] responsibilities and I'm just going to
[52:21] just kind of uh talk give what head or
[52:25] headship means it's the most prominent
[52:29] important member of any organized body
[52:32] the chief the leader the word head is
[52:36] often used to represent those who are in
[52:39] control leaders Among Us those we rely
[52:44] on to keep things working effectively
[52:47] right the head is one who leads and
[52:51] directs in the Bible the word head is
[52:54] symbolic of authority
[52:58] so when we speak of headship we are
[53:00] speaking of supervision guidance
[53:03] leadership oversight someone in charge
[53:08] of amen and and so all through the Bible
[53:12] there's we we see a a
[53:15] headship uh uh there and and so headship
[53:20] or
[53:21] leadership uh refers to the ability to
[53:25] inspire and guide others to achieve a
[53:29] common goal so with headship comes
[53:33] Vision purpose
[53:36] Direction uh uh that that's what
[53:39] headship is uh so so this this this
[53:43] phrase do as I say and not as I do
[53:47] that's not headship that that would be
[53:50] dictatorship uh but not headship because
[53:53] headship is leadership and so head ship
[53:56] means that uh being at the front of the
[54:00] line uh leading the way uh being in
[54:05] charge um it requires one to take
[54:10] initiative it's it's kind of like
[54:12] shamard when he took the initiative to
[54:16] uh face the enemy the enemy had been
[54:19] coming and taking their crops and his
[54:22] family no doubt was starving and they're
[54:24] barely making it and this was of course
[54:27] in the natural and shamgar began to
[54:30] remember that he was part of a covenant
[54:34] he remembered that that he was Abraham's
[54:37] seed and and that he was part of the
[54:40] promise that thy seed shall possess the
[54:43] Gate of your enemies and as the headship
[54:47] of the home he took the initiative and
[54:50] and God blessed him for that and he
[54:53] defeated the enemy Abraham uh when he
[54:56] heard the voice of God for God would
[54:59] come to him as as the head of the home
[55:03] and and commanded him to to leave the uh
[55:08] the the land of ER and go to another
[55:11] land uh that God had had promised him
[55:14] and and so Abraham took that initiative
[55:19] Amen to act upon the word of God and not
[55:23] only did he leave but he brought his his
[55:25] his his his family he brought his
[55:28] children uh well uh not his children at
[55:31] that time but he he brought he brought
[55:34] everything that was part of his family
[55:37] his household and and and took it with
[55:39] him ain't that right so so we find that
[55:43] that uh uh a headship uh um it requires
[55:47] one taking the
[55:49] initiative uh it also requires again to
[55:52] have a vision or uh to have a purpose
[55:57] and and but not only just just a vision
[56:00] or just a purpose but it has to be the
[56:04] right kind of vision the the the right
[56:07] kind of purpose amen it also requires
[56:11] one to be
[56:12] courageous uh as well as one to Be
[56:16] steady uh uh anchored uh faithful amen
[56:22] there there is a great
[56:24] responsibility uh uh when it comes to to
[56:28] headship uh uh because you you have ones
[56:33] that are following and and not only that
[56:35] you're training you are you're you're
[56:38] protecting you're keeping you're
[56:40] preserving it's it's it's it's uh uh
[56:43] there there there's a lot that that
[56:45] weighs there if if if you you you were
[56:48] in a battle and and you were following
[56:51] your commander whatever he would be uh
[56:54] uh you wouldn't want one that that would
[56:56] run and leave you in the battle uh or be
[57:00] a chicken and and and later on you find
[57:02] him in a Dugout somewhere and you're
[57:05] taking all the the bullets or whatever
[57:08] but you would want one that was was very
[57:12] careful and in how he led you you you're
[57:15] going you know we talked about it a few
[57:17] years ago but you know you're going
[57:19] through the swamps or the jungles and
[57:21] you know the enem is all around and and
[57:24] and you wouldn't want that leader say
[57:25] hey guys you know let's uh uh uh let's
[57:29] all throw a beer party or let's all go
[57:31] this and let's all go that and and uh
[57:34] let let's just you know what have y'all
[57:35] been doing and boy we need to get home
[57:38] and and all these things you want
[57:39] someone that would be very disciplined
[57:42] that would be aware and not only aware
[57:45] but concerned that there is an enemy all
[57:48] around you can you say amen and and so
[57:52] with that uh uh uh him knowing that he
[57:57] has got you in in in uh uh in his hands
[58:01] he's responsible for you then he's going
[58:05] to be careful he's going to be observant
[58:07] he's going to be watching the enemy he's
[58:09] going to know uh where to take you and
[58:12] what not where to take you he's going to
[58:14] be looking for landmines and and all of
[58:17] these things because he wants not just
[58:20] himself but he wants those that are
[58:22] following to come home all in tight
[58:26] ain't that right and alive right and so
[58:29] uh we we find that uh uh but but when
[58:33] when we're looking at today of headship
[58:35] a man's authority to rule and direct
[58:40] comes from God who appoints them ain't
[58:44] that right amen so then he is never
[58:48] according to the Bible he is never at
[58:52] Liberty to do things his own way but
[58:56] rather is responsible for seeing that
[59:00] things are done God's way uh of course
[59:03] this is the right kind of headship now
[59:06] this is what makes the difference
[59:08] between a a real believer and and one
[59:12] who isn't because a Believer accepts
[59:16] God's way and desires to to walk in that
[59:21] way and to fulfill his plan to fulfill
[59:24] the will of God it's just like Noah Noah
[59:27] was a Believer amen and so when God came
[59:31] to him and told him about the the the uh
[59:35] the flood the the Wrath that he that was
[59:38] he's going to pour out and he's going to
[59:41] destroy the Earth with the flood amen
[59:44] but God and and thank God that God just
[59:47] didn't give him that amen uh uh
[59:50] Revelation but he also gave him a
[59:53] revelation of what to do how to do it it
[59:56] in order to be saved amen it's just like
[59:59] today God doesn't just just give us uh
[1:00:03] the given us the revelation of of the
[1:00:06] tribulation coming and the wrath of God
[1:00:08] and all these things but he has actually
[1:00:10] given us the revelation of what to do to
[1:00:14] escape the things that are coming am and
[1:00:17] and so but Moses or Noah being that he
[1:00:20] was a Believer he he didn't argue with
[1:00:22] God he didn't say well you know what you
[1:00:25] you just you know I'll deal with you I
[1:00:29] talk with you when I'm at church and and
[1:00:32] and you know but but I'm going to do it
[1:00:34] my own way no no he he he saw to it that
[1:00:39] that Ark was built exactly the way God
[1:00:41] wanted it amen and and the Bible says he
[1:00:44] built it for the saving of his household
[1:00:48] he built it can you amen so so one thing
[1:00:52] I I thank God Amen that Noah had a had a
[1:00:56] heart for his family he he had a burden
[1:00:59] for his family he he understood the
[1:01:02] crisis that that was uh uh that he was
[1:01:05] in he understood the importance of
[1:01:08] making sure that his family was saved uh
[1:01:12] uh from the danger ain't that right and
[1:01:14] and of course he preached uh uh uh
[1:01:17] trying to get others in uh but we know
[1:01:20] ultimately it was his family that was
[1:01:23] saved and and so uh uh um we we find
[1:01:27] also that when God required uh the blood
[1:01:31] of the Lamb to be a token and it had to
[1:01:34] be displayed uh uh at a certain place uh
[1:01:39] uh on a certain thing um uh God God was
[1:01:42] very specific where that blood had to be
[1:01:46] and and and so uh uh then he required
[1:01:49] every male of that household uh the male
[1:01:52] the the man the the head of the
[1:01:55] household Amen to apply the blood and so
[1:01:58] uh every man who believe the message of
[1:02:02] the Prophet amen they were Believers
[1:02:05] amen and they did exactly the way that
[1:02:09] messenger told them to do it amen see
[1:02:13] and so uh now if you notice the order of
[1:02:16] headship uh the head of woman is man but
[1:02:19] the head of man is Christ and the head
[1:02:23] of Christ is God so then this tells us
[1:02:27] that there should be no headship exercis
[1:02:31] outside of God can you say amen amen
[1:02:36] that's right now uh 1 John 1:1 in the
[1:02:39] beginning uh was the word the word was
[1:02:43] with God the Word was God ain't that
[1:02:46] right and and so then the head of Christ
[1:02:50] is
[1:02:52] what God the word is that right it that
[1:02:57] that was the head of Christ amen John
[1:03:01] 1:14 it says the word was made flesh and
[1:03:05] dwelt Among Us can you say Amen so who's
[1:03:09] that Christ ain't that right so then
[1:03:13] Christ is the word of God manifest in
[1:03:17] flesh so we could say it this way the
[1:03:19] manifested word today amen is the
[1:03:23] headship of man amen amen and and so man
[1:03:28] under the headship of the word is the
[1:03:32] head of woman of the woman and and his
[1:03:36] household now I know that men you know
[1:03:39] who you know uh uh they they want to
[1:03:42] take position as head of home but they
[1:03:46] themselves refuse to come under headship
[1:03:48] oh and and they they act as though they
[1:03:51] are the ultimate head there is no head
[1:03:54] above them and and and they carry carry
[1:03:57] this uh this this uh attitude aen with
[1:04:02] him but a a man that's a Believer will
[1:04:05] always recognize his headship now now we
[1:04:10] always want woman to recognize her
[1:04:12] headship right and and and and and and
[1:04:15] and man you know uh you get some of
[1:04:18] these men that that they always remind
[1:04:20] their wise I'm head I'm head I'm head
[1:04:23] but but but and and and they they should
[1:04:26] recognize their head but but man should
[1:04:29] recognize his headship as well and and
[1:04:33] so but but this is why a man should have
[1:04:37] the new birth before he gets married and
[1:04:39] have a family this is why a a young lady
[1:04:43] should always amen pray and make sure
[1:04:46] that that man that that she wants to
[1:04:49] marry has the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:52] and has the New Birth you you can't be
[1:04:56] head over the home amen through a carnal
[1:04:59] nature and and I understand we all fight
[1:05:02] carnal natures and and and these things
[1:05:04] I'm not saying that but but what I am
[1:05:06] saying if a man has not the Holy Ghost
[1:05:10] amen then he cannot come under the
[1:05:12] headship of the word because that carnal
[1:05:15] mind is always enmity against God cannot
[1:05:18] be subject to the law of God therefore
[1:05:21] he cannot bring his own self under
[1:05:24] subjection to the word of God so then
[1:05:27] what's the use of trying to to make a
[1:05:30] home the prophet said without it being a
[1:05:32] Christian Home can can you say amen and
[1:05:36] and this is what makes I believe uh us
[1:05:39] us different from the world is is is
[1:05:43] what God has done within us amen as
[1:05:48] Believers see a home without God is a
[1:05:52] broken home a ain't that right for years
[1:05:55] man has led his home by emotions and by
[1:05:59] feelings and Sensations and and and you
[1:06:03] know we we've had this idea and we've
[1:06:06] had this thought and we we've had you
[1:06:08] know and and a lot of times we lead our
[1:06:11] homes by our own wants and our own
[1:06:14] Ambitions and our own ways and we raise
[1:06:17] up our children amen I've seen people
[1:06:20] raise up their children uh uh and and
[1:06:23] bring them into things because they
[1:06:25] didn't have it well I wasn't allowed to
[1:06:26] play in sports so I am going to get my
[1:06:28] children involved in sports buddy you
[1:06:31] know and I was broke and and we were
[1:06:33] just flat poor and I'm going to make
[1:06:34] sure that my children are rich you know
[1:06:37] and and and so we we lead our our we
[1:06:40] raise our families based on things that
[1:06:43] of our past can you say amen and and but
[1:06:48] but in this day in this day the headship
[1:06:53] has come do you believe that the
[1:06:55] headship has come amen now there are are
[1:06:59] two controlling Spirits uh in the world
[1:07:02] today and and and to be honest that
[1:07:04] that's all there are uh so that really
[1:07:07] makes it easy for us that we don't have
[1:07:09] to count this one and this one and this
[1:07:10] one and this one this one it's just two
[1:07:12] amen and and that is God and Satan it
[1:07:15] it's just plain as day and and and so uh
[1:07:19] of course uh the the spirit of
[1:07:22] antichrist is of Satan ain't that right
[1:07:25] so that Spirit of antichrist and uh the
[1:07:28] spirit of Truth is God and then the
[1:07:32] prophet teaches there's two Vines amen
[1:07:35] uh there's the false Vine and there is
[1:07:38] the True Vine ain't that right and well
[1:07:41] both Vines have come to maturity in this
[1:07:45] day uh uh we're talking spiritually
[1:07:48] speaking but it is also an effect upon
[1:07:51] upon people in this age but but both
[1:07:54] Vines have come the Antichrist Vine uh
[1:07:58] uh has has matured and the True Vine has
[1:08:02] matured in this day can you say amen and
[1:08:05] it's becoming more and more clear as to
[1:08:08] who is running it amen at least uh uh to
[1:08:12] the Believers uh as as that maturity uh
[1:08:16] uh takes place now everything uh um you
[1:08:21] know under the the the the headship of
[1:08:25] of Satan is Antichrist do you believe
[1:08:28] that everything everything can you say
[1:08:31] everything everything that is influenced
[1:08:34] of the devil is Antichrist uh their
[1:08:37] motives are Antichrist their their their
[1:08:41] uh uh Ambitions are Antichrist
[1:08:43] everything they do is is Antichrist and
[1:08:47] and and Antichrist is one who is against
[1:08:49] the word ain't that right and and so we
[1:08:52] can understand that that that that the
[1:08:56] the the things that God did not ordain
[1:08:59] uh for man is Antichrist uh uh God God
[1:09:03] never God God never uh wanted division
[1:09:07] in the home God never amen wanted
[1:09:10] division in a church God never wanted uh
[1:09:14] people so confused uh uh as it is today
[1:09:18] but but it's it's a spirit of antichrist
[1:09:22] a man that is working against God's
[1:09:24] plans
[1:09:26] can you say Amen well then we find that
[1:09:29] the true bright church is maturing as
[1:09:32] well amen now the prophet said her
[1:09:35] rightness shall be an identification
[1:09:38] with her Lord by means of the word ain't
[1:09:42] that right and her head who will come to
[1:09:46] her is the mystery of godliness which is
[1:09:49] indeed Christ and and what is Christ in
[1:09:54] you Christ in you can you say Amen
[1:09:57] Christ coming into maturity in
[1:10:01] you yes sir amen and and what that means
[1:10:05] is he's able to to control he's able to
[1:10:08] have more preeminence he's more he he's
[1:10:10] able to take his position in you he's
[1:10:12] able to to reflect himself in you it's
[1:10:15] not that he matures but he himself now
[1:10:20] is able to to have total preeminence to
[1:10:23] where the world sees nothing but
[1:10:26] Christ through all the faults through
[1:10:28] everything there is a reflection of
[1:10:31] Christ can you say Amen so now as as the
[1:10:35] false church with all cunning and Di
[1:10:39] diabolical power made up of uh political
[1:10:42] force physical Force Demons of Darkness
[1:10:45] come against this True Vine the True
[1:10:48] Vine with the fullness of the spirit and
[1:10:50] the word will do now notice the True
[1:10:53] Vine with all the fullness of the spirit
[1:10:55] and the word will do the very acts of
[1:10:57] power that Jesus did then as she nears
[1:11:01] The Headstone becoming like him through
[1:11:03] the word Jesus will come that the bride
[1:11:06] and groom May forever be United as one
[1:11:10] now you say well what does that have to
[1:11:12] do with my life and my family and my
[1:11:16] whatever well you see people people uh
[1:11:19] try to separate religion from their
[1:11:21] personal life and home life and it's as
[1:11:24] though God only belongs in the walls of
[1:11:28] the church and so when we come to church
[1:11:31] all of a sudden we turn on this
[1:11:33] spiritual uh uh thing and and you know
[1:11:38] then we talk about God we think about
[1:11:40] God of course it's common you know or
[1:11:43] and and and it's getting less common but
[1:11:45] to to come to church and sing hymns and
[1:11:48] and to Sing About God talk about God
[1:11:52] Amen so we sing hymns in the church
[1:11:54] outside the church it's all Rock and
[1:11:56] Roll country and and and love songs and
[1:12:00] and you you understand what I'm saying
[1:12:02] uh we talk about God in church and and
[1:12:04] then when we get outside it's swearing
[1:12:07] and cussing and even the audacity to use
[1:12:10] the lord's name in vain you know but how
[1:12:13] dare we do that in church you know uh uh
[1:12:16] even though that's becoming more common
[1:12:19] uh uh with ministers amen but but see we
[1:12:23] we act religious in church and and then
[1:12:26] of course you know uh uh act like the
[1:12:30] devil you know outside of the church and
[1:12:32] I'm not talking about we I'm just
[1:12:34] talking about majority of the world
[1:12:36] today so it it's like we put on religion
[1:12:40] when performing religious duties and
[1:12:43] then take it off when we are finished
[1:12:46] see so God only has a uh uh we give God
[1:12:50] time man gives God just a certain a lot
[1:12:53] of time in his busy schedule you know
[1:12:57] and and and that's if they even have
[1:13:00] time for him right amen yes sir see and
[1:13:03] and so uh uh but for a person to think
[1:13:07] that that that life without God uh being
[1:13:10] involved amen uh uh is is is the way to
[1:13:14] go or is is is is the the the norm uh uh
[1:13:20] that that's wrong and that inspiration
[1:13:22] comes from the devil amen you see see
[1:13:25] God is Elohim he's the self-existent one
[1:13:29] he's the he's he's forever been uh never
[1:13:34] ended never
[1:13:36] started and and he he was alone ain't
[1:13:39] that right so he dwelt alone with his
[1:13:41] thoughts and in in Genesis 1:1 it says
[1:13:44] in the beginning God created ain't that
[1:13:47] right in the beginning God created then
[1:13:50] you go to Colossians 1:16 for by him
[1:13:54] were all things things created that are
[1:13:56] in heaven that are in Earth visible and
[1:13:59] invisible whether they be Thrones
[1:14:01] dominions principalities or Powers all
[1:14:04] things everybody say all things were
[1:14:06] created by Him and for him can you say
[1:14:10] amen God created All Things by him and
[1:14:15] for him so based upon this scripture
[1:14:18] alone we see that God is involved in
[1:14:21] every part of creation and he had a
[1:14:25] purpose for every every aspect of
[1:14:28] creation you realize he is the first one
[1:14:31] that instituted a marriage between man
[1:14:34] and woman amen he's the one that created
[1:14:36] the man and woman ain't that right and
[1:14:39] and and so the we we know that that the
[1:14:43] the Bible says here in the uh uh
[1:14:46] Colossians um uh 117 he is before all
[1:14:51] things and by him all things consist so
[1:14:53] this creation come by the word a ain't
[1:14:57] that right and and then the Bible would
[1:15:00] tell us that he upholdeth all things by
[1:15:03] the word of his power or the power of
[1:15:06] His word the word has power do you
[1:15:10] believe that the word has power the sun
[1:15:14] still rises amen because the word of God
[1:15:18] the power of that word is is holding it
[1:15:22] everything is the way it's uh uh uh
[1:15:25] there see and so uh uh now we want this
[1:15:29] kind of headship Amen because that's
[1:15:32] where our power comes from a do you
[1:15:36] believe that amen yes sir it it it that
[1:15:40] kind of headship the word amen is what
[1:15:43] holds us preserves us keeps us from from
[1:15:48] uh uh becoming
[1:15:50] non-existent uh or or yeah non-existent
[1:15:54] and and keeps us from being devastated
[1:15:57] and torn apart and ravished and and all
[1:15:59] of these things there is the power of
[1:16:02] the word of God can you say Amen so now
[1:16:06] when when God was in his Tabernacle the
[1:16:09] body of Jesus Christ amen uh uh he said
[1:16:13] Upon This Rock I will build my church
[1:16:16] and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[1:16:19] against it ain't that right amen I will
[1:16:22] build my church I will build my church
[1:16:24] amen so not only is is he the creator of
[1:16:28] man uh in in as natural and the all
[1:16:32] creation but now he's going to create
[1:16:34] himself a church amen build a church
[1:16:39] that the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[1:16:41] against it and that church will be held
[1:16:44] by the same thing by the power of His
[1:16:47] word ain't that right yes sir see now
[1:16:50] not only is he the designer and the
[1:16:53] maker of this church but he is the head
[1:16:57] of this church which is his body can you
[1:17:01] say Amen see so Colossians 1:18 and he
[1:17:05] is the head of the body everybody say
[1:17:07] he's the head of the body he's the head
[1:17:10] of the body the church amen who is the
[1:17:13] beginning and the firstborn from the
[1:17:16] dead that in all things everybody say in
[1:17:18] all things in all things he might have
[1:17:22] the
[1:17:23] preeminence in all things can you say
[1:17:27] Amen so in other words he's going to
[1:17:30] have preeminence in your worship he's
[1:17:33] going to have preeminence in your faith
[1:17:36] he's going to have preeminence of your
[1:17:38] confession of your thinking he's also
[1:17:41] going to have preeminence in your
[1:17:44] marriage he's going to have preeminence
[1:17:47] in your home your decisions and your
[1:17:50] personal life can you say Amen see if
[1:17:54] your part of his church then you were
[1:17:58] made specifically for him and his glory
[1:18:02] you were made for him can you say amen
[1:18:05] and not just when you come to church but
[1:18:08] he has preeminence in all things he has
[1:18:12] preeminence in your personal life he's
[1:18:14] got to have preeminence in everything so
[1:18:16] if we are part of his church then there
[1:18:20] is the headship that we've come
[1:18:23] under can you say Amen now he's the head
[1:18:27] that governs the body now in his body
[1:18:30] are pastors teachers prophets
[1:18:33] evangelists Apostles or
[1:18:35] missionaries but there are also deacons
[1:18:38] trustees Sunday school teachers right
[1:18:41] secretaries musicians song leaders in
[1:18:45] this body there are fathers husbands
[1:18:48] mothers wives children right there are
[1:18:53] employers
[1:18:55] employees there are businessmen all
[1:18:58] within the body of Christ there are
[1:19:01] people that's got gifts gifted to do
[1:19:04] other things there's janitors you know
[1:19:06] there's helps and governments all within
[1:19:08] the body but there's one head can you
[1:19:12] amen so they're within the body so
[1:19:16] therefore he's going to have the
[1:19:17] preeminence over everything because he
[1:19:20] was made to be the head and he's the
[1:19:23] word so that word is the headship of the
[1:19:26] body Now 1 Corinthians 12:18 now God
[1:19:30] hath set members every one of them in
[1:19:33] the body as it hath pleased him ain't
[1:19:36] that right so so with this this this
[1:19:39] thing of arguing with God or or twisting
[1:19:43] the word of God to bring a perversion is
[1:19:46] is not the way the body is ran ran
[1:19:50] there's Twisted things all in the Earth
[1:19:53] today uh uh that God never made it to be
[1:19:57] it it's just like a woman trying to be a
[1:20:00] man and man trying to be a woman and now
[1:20:03] you know even children you know boys
[1:20:05] trying to be girls and girls trying to
[1:20:07] be boys and and even identifying as an
[1:20:10] animal and and a cat or a dog or or
[1:20:13] whatever there there's so much twisting
[1:20:16] and perversion but in the body in the
[1:20:20] body there is exactly the way God made
[1:20:23] it to be
[1:20:25] yes sir can you say
[1:20:27] Amen so every gift every Minister
[1:20:31] Ministry every marriage family
[1:20:34] individual comes in subjection to the
[1:20:36] headship of the word of God and and it's
[1:20:39] the word everybody say it's the word
[1:20:42] that places every member where it should
[1:20:45] go in the body the word does can you say
[1:20:48] amen and so then every member in that
[1:20:52] body is placed as God has pleased and
[1:20:56] they are to to function within the
[1:21:00] boundaries that God has set for him or
[1:21:03] her ain't that right so therefore we
[1:21:06] must not try to take uh uh someone
[1:21:08] else's place we find that's what
[1:21:11] happened with King Uzziah he was
[1:21:13] anointed to be king and and and and God
[1:21:17] blessed him in that but then he got
[1:21:20] lifted up he got prideful and before you
[1:21:23] know it uh he's trying to take the place
[1:21:25] of the minister and God cursed him God
[1:21:28] struck him with Leprosy and he died a
[1:21:31] leper ain't that right see so we find
[1:21:34] even David anointed to be king and God
[1:21:37] blessed him he was the head of the
[1:21:38] nation of Israel but he got in trouble
[1:21:41] because he bypassed amen the the
[1:21:44] headship that God had placed uh over him
[1:21:48] in that land and and he consulted with
[1:21:51] other men instead of Consulting with the
[1:21:54] prophet
[1:21:55] ain't that right see so then if a man is
[1:21:58] Anointed to be a minister then then he
[1:22:00] must not you know try to be a prophet
[1:22:03] the prophet said that see if if he's
[1:22:05] anointed to be a minister he must not
[1:22:06] try to be a prophet you know the
[1:22:08] Evangelist must be an evangelist the
[1:22:10] pastor must be a pastor and and such you
[1:22:12] know and and brother Ram said see you
[1:22:14] Pastor shouldn't tell a prophet what to
[1:22:16] do or evangelist tell a pastor see each
[1:22:20] one has his office if it is perfectly
[1:22:23] identified amen can you amen so the
[1:22:26] Evangelist shouldn't be giving pastoral
[1:22:28] advice to a pastor's congregation it
[1:22:31] it's just not the way it's supposed to
[1:22:33] be so then then everything should be in
[1:22:37] the way God placed it it's just like in
[1:22:39] the home the wife shouldn't try to take
[1:22:40] the husband's place the husband
[1:22:42] shouldn't try to take the Woman's Place
[1:22:44] the children shouldn't take the parents'
[1:22:46] place but everything is twisted up in
[1:22:50] these days uh see and and businessman
[1:22:53] the prophet said shouldn't uh try to
[1:22:55] take the place of the minister they they
[1:22:57] they should stay out of the pulpit see
[1:22:59] God blesses them in the minist or in in
[1:23:02] their field amen but to try to come and
[1:23:05] and take another man's place or position
[1:23:08] then then there's wrong see so then
[1:23:11] there must be
[1:23:14] headship there must be headship because
[1:23:16] without headship there's
[1:23:18] confusion amen can you say amen amen you
[1:23:22] know in the Book of Judges we find that
[1:23:25] it says when there was no king in Israel
[1:23:28] every man did that which was right in
[1:23:31] his own eyes this is why God ordained
[1:23:34] headship in the local body of the church
[1:23:37] he ordained headship in the home he
[1:23:40] actually ordained headship in a
[1:23:43] nation uh uh and that's true now uh it
[1:23:49] was the people that wanted a different
[1:23:51] type of headship but
[1:23:53] nonetheless uh is Israel had headship as
[1:23:57] a nation ain't that right so the Bible
[1:24:00] tells us that God is not the author of
[1:24:02] confusion this word Babylon as we the
[1:24:05] Bible talks about we hear it it it's it
[1:24:09] that's the word it means
[1:24:11] confusion uh confusion see and so then
[1:24:14] if there's any confusion it it it it
[1:24:17] comes from babbling it just uh uh uh
[1:24:22] babbling there there there's no clear
[1:24:24] cut decision right there's no clearcut
[1:24:28] answers in in Babylon it's just a a mess
[1:24:31] of confusion can you say man and it's
[1:24:34] not of God but in this day we've been
[1:24:37] called to come out of Babylon we we've
[1:24:41] been called to come out not just the
[1:24:43] church but us as individuals our homes
[1:24:47] our families our
[1:24:49] marriage everything is to come out of B
[1:24:56] confusion under a
[1:24:59] headship can you say
[1:25:01] Amen any headship must be under the
[1:25:06] headship of the word of
[1:25:09] God we have read in the Bible of Kings
[1:25:12] who did not subject themselves to the
[1:25:14] word of God and their headship brought
[1:25:18] uh Israel into idolatry yeah and caused
[1:25:22] them to be led away into captivity and
[1:25:26] if you've noticed that anytime headship
[1:25:30] is is is exercised outside of God's word
[1:25:34] it always brings people into
[1:25:36] captivity right can you say amen and and
[1:25:41] it brings Ultimate Death David caresh
[1:25:44] for example Jim Jones for example on and
[1:25:48] on and on even the Bible talks about men
[1:25:51] and and uh that had gotten a following
[1:25:53] and L them out into the desert and they
[1:25:55] all
[1:25:56] perished because it was not under the
[1:25:59] headship of the word of God hello amen
[1:26:03] that's right and families are dying just
[1:26:05] as much churches are dying just as
[1:26:08] much hello ain't that right and this
[1:26:12] nation is is declining at a rapid
[1:26:16] Pace TR that's right because there's a
[1:26:20] government without headship of the word
[1:26:22] that's true that's right
[1:26:24] and so uh uh headship started in the
[1:26:29] beginning uh when God said to the man of
[1:26:31] the tree of the knowledge of Good and
[1:26:33] Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the
[1:26:37] day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt
[1:26:39] surely die so that there God would set a
[1:26:42] boundary God would set an authority over
[1:26:45] man amen and and the the word of God
[1:26:49] that word of God was the headship of man
[1:26:53] yeah ain't that right and Adam had
[1:26:56] Dominion as long as he subjected himself
[1:26:59] to that
[1:27:01] headship see he he had fellowship with
[1:27:04] God he and his wife was in harmony with
[1:27:07] one another and with God ain't that
[1:27:10] right brother said God could come down
[1:27:12] at any time he desired and talk lip to
[1:27:15] ear with him he said that is perfect
[1:27:18] Oneness they were so perfect in harmony
[1:27:21] with God till they were one with God God
[1:27:24] and his family was one and that word
[1:27:27] Oneness means United they were United
[1:27:32] together the Lord ain't that right as
[1:27:35] long as he was under that headship of
[1:27:38] the word and any man the prophet said
[1:27:41] and his family a correct good Noble
[1:27:43] obedient family is one with another any
[1:27:46] family see he says and if there's
[1:27:48] something in the family that moves them
[1:27:50] apart then it's not right the family's
[1:27:52] broken somewhere they they should all be
[1:27:54] one father with Mother Mother with
[1:27:56] father children with parent parent with
[1:27:58] children all in agreement and when you
[1:28:00] see that you'll see one lovely picture
[1:28:04] so then to separate uh uh uh from the
[1:28:09] word is to break your Oneness with God
[1:28:11] and and breaking the fellowship see so
[1:28:14] the prophet said this Oneness with God
[1:28:17] and we're now talking of Oneness Oneness
[1:28:20] with God is to have God's spirit in you
[1:28:24] everybody say In Me In Me agreeing with
[1:28:29] the word all the word the whole word and
[1:28:33] to make it manifested in power can you
[1:28:35] say amen amen now Adam being the head he
[1:28:40] was the head of his family he was the
[1:28:42] head of creation he was the head of it
[1:28:45] all and so therefore he had the
[1:28:49] responsibility of staying under the
[1:28:51] headship of the word ain't that right
[1:28:55] and how important it is for us Brethren
[1:28:59] to stay under the headship of the word
[1:29:03] amen brothers and
[1:29:05] sisters we've got an enemy that we're fa
[1:29:09] facing it's it's it's uh uh it's well
[1:29:13] it's the worst
[1:29:15] ever and and and in my honest estimation
[1:29:20] it's even worse than what Adam dealt
[1:29:22] with and what Eve dealt
[1:29:25] with he he just dealt with a serpent
[1:29:27] we're dealing with with with millions of
[1:29:33] demons in this age because that gave
[1:29:37] opened the door for us to or the demons
[1:29:42] to to uh uh challenge us as Believers
[1:29:46] can you say amen and and they're
[1:29:48] challenging on every hand they're trying
[1:29:51] to destroy family they're trying to
[1:29:53] destroy marriages they're trying to
[1:29:54] destroy they're they're they're trying
[1:29:56] to destroy these things but there has to
[1:29:59] be a headship amen amen he a a now us
[1:30:04] men just as just like us us men we are
[1:30:08] no match for the devil in our intellect
[1:30:11] we're no match in our talents we're no
[1:30:13] match in our skill our ability our drive
[1:30:16] whatever we're are no match amen hello
[1:30:20] there's only one thing that is is got
[1:30:24] the power to preserve us and that is the
[1:30:27] word of
[1:30:28] [Music]
[1:30:29] God can you say amen amen now when Adam
[1:30:33] fell then it affected the whole human
[1:30:36] race Romans 5:12 wherefore as by one man
[1:30:40] sin entered into the world and death by
[1:30:42] sin and so death passed upon all men for
[1:30:44] all that all have
[1:30:46] sinned we read in the Bible how how
[1:30:49] important headship is and what what
[1:30:52] significance that really is to us uh uh
[1:30:57] and and and how that men brought a curse
[1:31:01] upon their family through their
[1:31:02] Disobedience and Rebellion to the word
[1:31:05] such as
[1:31:06] Ahab uh uh God brought a curse upon
[1:31:10] ahab's children because of his
[1:31:14] Disobedience uh uh we find the aen uh
[1:31:18] because of his Disobedience caused his
[1:31:20] family to perish look at Esau because of
[1:31:23] what ES saw done his whole lineage
[1:31:26] become be be become uh thieves and
[1:31:29] Rebels and and and all that hiding out
[1:31:32] in caves and and things like that see
[1:31:35] but we also read where men have brought
[1:31:39] blessings and victory to their family by
[1:31:43] by their obedience we talked about
[1:31:46] Shamar amen he he he understood through
[1:31:50] all the fear and and all these things
[1:31:53] even though he felt that he wasn't able
[1:31:56] to but yet he took Courage by the word
[1:32:01] of God and by that word he acted upon it
[1:32:05] and brought Victory to his
[1:32:09] family ain't that right we we talk about
[1:32:12] Noah just as much as he acted under the
[1:32:16] headship of God he preserved his
[1:32:21] family Abraham is so
[1:32:24] you
[1:32:25] know God doesn't require you know uh as
[1:32:29] we've talked so much God doesn't require
[1:32:33] us men to be perfect we're going to make
[1:32:36] mistakes and we pay for our mistakes yes
[1:32:39] amen ain't that right but the blood of
[1:32:42] Jesus Christ is there to protect us
[1:32:45] praise the Lord hello amen and I think
[1:32:48] that's the way with our families as much
[1:32:51] Satan was Satan's after our children
[1:32:54] right I I thought of like brother
[1:32:55] brandham for example and there there he
[1:32:58] done everything serving the lord giving
[1:33:00] his all to God everything like that and
[1:33:03] then Satan comes and starts working on
[1:33:05] Billy Paul Billy Paul being out in the
[1:33:08] world he's smoking he's doing all these
[1:33:10] things but that daddy stayed with
[1:33:13] headship amen he didn't compromise on
[1:33:17] that word he didn't you understand what
[1:33:19] I'm saying amen but he stayed right
[1:33:22] there under the headship of that word
[1:33:24] believing that the word had power to
[1:33:27] preserve that family that's
[1:33:30] right amen not all times is our children
[1:33:36] doing things because of our actions it's
[1:33:40] just the devil trying to fight them
[1:33:41] that's right the devil was trying to
[1:33:43] destroy
[1:33:45] them hello yes he is and and what a
[1:33:49] benefit and I want to say this you know
[1:33:51] to you children who have parent parents
[1:33:54] and dads and and mothers that some of
[1:33:57] you may not have Christian dads but you
[1:33:59] got you got a mother that's staying
[1:34:01] right with that
[1:34:02] word amen she's under that headship of
[1:34:06] the word you're blessed to have that
[1:34:09] am that's right amen yes sir you believe
[1:34:13] it you're blessed you may see death fall
[1:34:17] but you see him rise up again you may
[1:34:19] see Mom fall but she Rises up again
[1:34:22] she's not w uh uh you know he's not just
[1:34:25] shifting over here and shifting over
[1:34:27] here and following this thing and that
[1:34:30] thing and that thing he's remaining
[1:34:32] under the headship of the word of God
[1:34:35] hello and and what it's doing it's
[1:34:38] bringing you
[1:34:40] Victory I just believe
[1:34:43] that
[1:34:45] amen Adam's fall affected creation under
[1:34:48] him as well and all creation fell with
[1:34:51] him because he's the head of it all
[1:34:56] all creation as the Bible says is
[1:34:58] groaning for the
[1:35:00] time when the sons of God comes back to
[1:35:03] the rightful position right comes back
[1:35:06] to headship over the
[1:35:09] Earth hello that's right to where that
[1:35:13] when they when they come into that
[1:35:17] adoption which is coming back to
[1:35:20] headship reigning see they will stop
[1:35:24] nature yeah that's they can speak limbs
[1:35:27] into existence under a headship hell so
[1:35:31] we going to do
[1:35:33] it can you say
[1:35:35] amen amen see that's why we we we don't
[1:35:38] look at the
[1:35:40] impossibility God help us not to look at
[1:35:42] the the things of that are
[1:35:44] negative stay under the headship of that
[1:35:47] work
[1:35:54] so so we find that
[1:35:57] that man comes back to this this
[1:36:02] reigning position of authority when he
[1:36:05] comes back in a subjection to the word
[1:36:07] of God ain't that right the Lord now
[1:36:11] Satan's power was able to take over man
[1:36:14] when he let the headship the word and
[1:36:17] and again demons are pouring in and and
[1:36:20] they're into the people they're
[1:36:22] manifesting the El in in the people in
[1:36:25] this Dimension and and why why why have
[1:36:29] they been able to do it because they've
[1:36:30] left
[1:36:31] headship of the word of
[1:36:34] God can you say Amen so then then
[1:36:38] headship is something that we come under
[1:36:41] subjection to uh 1 Peter 3 And1 it says
[1:36:44] likewise W ye wives be in subjection to
[1:36:48] your own husbands well if they are to be
[1:36:51] in subjection to their own husband are
[1:36:54] we not to be as men subject to come
[1:36:58] under subjection to our own
[1:37:00] headship amen yes sir we don't have to
[1:37:03] guess who are our
[1:37:05] head we aren't left to opinions and
[1:37:08] ideas and thoughts about these things
[1:37:11] can you say amen that's right now we
[1:37:15] look but then we find that Jesus Christ
[1:37:17] submitted to his
[1:37:19] headship as well he had headship did he
[1:37:22] not John 8:28 I do nothing of myself
[1:37:27] amen ain't that right but as my father a
[1:37:31] taught me I speak these things he didn't
[1:37:35] question the word he didn't question
[1:37:37] God's will he sought God's will right
[1:37:42] ain't that right yes he did John 5:30 I
[1:37:44] can of mine own self do nothing as I
[1:37:48] hear I judge my judgment is just because
[1:37:51] I seek not my own will but the will of
[1:37:53] the Father which has sent me so we can
[1:37:55] truly say that Christ fully obeyed the
[1:37:59] will of the father he kept him in sub
[1:38:02] himself in subjection to God and it
[1:38:06] wasn't always easy as we know it wasn't
[1:38:08] easy CU look at the the the the
[1:38:10] challenge there at at at uh in the
[1:38:12] Garden of Gethsemane he said if it be
[1:38:15] thy will let this cup pass from me that
[1:38:19] flesh was screaming out did not want to
[1:38:21] do it but God he would say but
[1:38:25] nevertheless thine be done not my will
[1:38:28] but thine be done can you say Amen so he
[1:38:32] submitted to his
[1:38:36] headship yes sir and Philippians uh uh
[1:38:40] 28 and being found in fashion as a man
[1:38:43] he humbled himself and became obedient
[1:38:46] unto death even the death of the
[1:38:50] Cross let let me ask you why did he do
[1:38:53] it
[1:38:54] for you and
[1:38:55] I can you say Amen Not only was he under
[1:38:59] headship he was going to be a head and
[1:39:02] he done it for us he he Sanctified
[1:39:05] himself to bring us to
[1:39:08] Victory the Lord he he forsook the world
[1:39:11] to bring us to a
[1:39:13] Deliverance can you say amen amen he
[1:39:17] knew where we were yes but he knew that
[1:39:20] that he would lay down his life on the
[1:39:22] line for our sake and because he did so
[1:39:26] it broke the curse upon
[1:39:30] us it broke the curse Lord it broke the
[1:39:34] power of of perversion that Satan
[1:39:37] exercised over man can you say amen and
[1:39:41] all because Christ kept himself our head
[1:39:45] under subjection to his
[1:39:49] headship praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:39:53] and by keeping himself under subjection
[1:39:56] then he knew who his headship was
[1:39:59] therefore he did not allow himself to
[1:40:01] come under subjection to any other
[1:40:04] influence are you with me now amen he
[1:40:07] did not allow himself remember Satan
[1:40:10] tried to tempt him he was tempted in
[1:40:13] every point that you and I are and yet
[1:40:16] he would never allow himself to come
[1:40:18] under such a a a a a subjection to that
[1:40:21] type of influence
[1:40:24] amen Lord can you say amen he didn't
[1:40:27] subject himself to the denominations at
[1:40:29] that day he didn't subjected himself to
[1:40:32] the priest of that day he didn't subject
[1:40:35] himself to the politics of that day he
[1:40:38] didn't subject himself to The
[1:40:40] Temptations and the negative thoughts
[1:40:43] that would come to his
[1:40:46] mind he kept himself subjected to the
[1:40:50] father's will
[1:40:51] amen prise
[1:40:54] even when death threatened to keep keep
[1:40:56] him in the grave don't you know fear try
[1:40:59] to get a hold of him yeah that's right
[1:41:02] if he was tempted in all points like we
[1:41:03] are we we Face fears we face well will
[1:41:08] God really keep his word does really God
[1:41:09] really got me is is this really going to
[1:41:12] happen or am I just a fool for all this
[1:41:14] and no doubt fear would try to grip him
[1:41:17] and say if they kill you it's it's
[1:41:19] forever you'll forever be that way in
[1:41:21] the ground but then he would say destroy
[1:41:25] this Temple and within 3 days I'll raise
[1:41:27] it up again why because he subjected
[1:41:30] himself to the will of God the word of
[1:41:34] God which was nothing but promises to
[1:41:37] him Lord can you say amen and I want to
[1:41:39] say to this to you don't subject
[1:41:42] yourself to anything outside of God's
[1:41:45] word true think
[1:41:48] about amen God help us not to subject
[1:41:51] ourselves to depression
[1:41:54] yeah
[1:41:56] to despair yeah amen that's right hello
[1:42:01] yes sir you know what that does for you
[1:42:04] it'll make you want to quit make you
[1:42:06] give up make you and then but what
[1:42:08] happens you become so
[1:42:11] self-involved so
[1:42:14] selfish that's what that type of spirit
[1:42:17] does and before you know it people are
[1:42:20] committing
[1:42:21] suicides and leaving the f family in
[1:42:25] despair because they come under an
[1:42:28] influence they allow themselves to come
[1:42:30] under subjection to something outside of
[1:42:33] God's
[1:42:33] word can you say Amen it's not always
[1:42:36] going to be easy to stay in your
[1:42:38] position it's not always going to be
[1:42:40] easy to stay
[1:42:42] steady but you got to remember as the
[1:42:44] headship of your home just as much as
[1:42:47] the head of the of a church
[1:42:54] that's right ministers don't realize
[1:42:58] the the sufferings that a church goes
[1:43:01] through because they allow themselves to
[1:43:04] come under subjection
[1:43:06] to Spirit of
[1:43:10] adultery the spirit of
[1:43:14] whatever they just they just they just
[1:43:17] whatever you know they leave the message
[1:43:20] I thought of the people that have left
[1:43:22] the message Ministers of have left the
[1:43:24] message because they kept feeding
[1:43:27] spirits that allowed themselves to come
[1:43:29] under subjection to it for you know what
[1:43:32] they start questioning
[1:43:34] it ain't that right and who suffers not
[1:43:38] only their
[1:43:40] family but the
[1:43:42] church you understand what I'm saying so
[1:43:46] Jesus understood he was the
[1:43:49] head yes he was and he cared to be unsub
[1:43:53] objection to his head that's right
[1:43:55] exactly ain't that right well his
[1:43:58] headship that word brought him out of
[1:43:59] the
[1:44:00] Grave on he rose again did he
[1:44:05] not
[1:44:06] right he so lived by the word till he
[1:44:09] became the word he didn't go out from
[1:44:11] the word as Adam did but stayed with it
[1:44:14] and he was made to be head of the church
[1:44:18] which is his body so therefore we as
[1:44:21] being part of the church we come under
[1:44:24] subjection to our headship yeah right
[1:44:28] yeah
[1:44:31] right amen as we get ready to close but
[1:44:36] we realize that the husband and wife is
[1:44:38] symbolic of Christ and the
[1:44:40] church the father and his family are
[1:44:43] symbolic of Christ and his
[1:44:48] family and the wife the family the
[1:44:50] church all is to subject themselves to a
[1:44:54] headship but this
[1:44:56] subjection is
[1:44:58] voluntarily which can only come by
[1:45:01] love can you say
[1:45:04] amen and this the Bible actually speaks
[1:45:08] of it and uh brother brandham but in the
[1:45:11] Book of Revelations it talks about
[1:45:13] Christ having the Key of
[1:45:14] David and this word key means Authority
[1:45:19] control so Christ alone has the
[1:45:23] Authority has the
[1:45:26] absolute control he's the it it it
[1:45:30] signifies he's
[1:45:31] head and and the you know the prophet
[1:45:35] brings it out the key is not in his
[1:45:38] hands it's it's not hanging around his
[1:45:41] neck it's not placed in the hands of
[1:45:44] other
[1:45:45] men so then where would it be and and uh
[1:45:50] Isaiah gives us the answer Isaiah
[1:45:53] 22:22 and the key of the House of David
[1:45:56] will I lay upon his shoulder amen so he
[1:46:00] shall open and None Shall shut he shall
[1:46:03] shut and no None Shall open he alone has
[1:46:06] this key he alone has the power he is
[1:46:08] alone has the authority he
[1:46:11] alone no struggles he alone has
[1:46:16] it but this key this Authority is upon
[1:46:19] his shoulders yeah right can you say
[1:46:23] amen
[1:46:24] Amen brother brah said see the spirit
[1:46:27] uses this Old Testament reference
[1:46:29] concerning the Lord Jesus Christ and his
[1:46:31] ministry in the church yes what the Key
[1:46:34] of David signified at that time is M
[1:46:37] Shadow which is now fulfilled in Jesus
[1:46:41] standing in the midst of the lampstands
[1:46:44] it has to do with our Lord after his
[1:46:46] resurrection and not his Earthly
[1:46:50] pilgrimage so this Authority Lays upon
[1:46:53] the shoulders the key and and and notice
[1:46:55] Isaiah 9:6 For unto us a child is born
[1:46:58] unto us a son is given and the
[1:47:01] government shall be up on his
[1:47:05] shoulders right how did it get there now
[1:47:09] notice now how did he get there well
[1:47:12] brother brandham he he he says now this
[1:47:14] phrase government upon his shoulders
[1:47:17] comes from the wedding ceremony of the
[1:47:19] East when the bride has been committed
[1:47:22] to the groom she takes off her veil and
[1:47:26] he and places it over the groom's
[1:47:29] shoulders yeah right signifying that not
[1:47:33] only is he is she under his
[1:47:37] domain see see she has transferred her
[1:47:41] rights to him that he is the head but
[1:47:44] also that he Bears the responsibility
[1:47:48] and the care and he and he alone no one
[1:47:52] else no other man no other power has any
[1:47:56] right and
[1:47:59] responsibility can you say
[1:48:01] amen he
[1:48:04] alone amen now that takes the burden off
[1:48:07] of us as as
[1:48:10] men on because as we are the church
[1:48:14] which it takes the burden off of all of
[1:48:17] us as the church we are now United with
[1:48:22] him
[1:48:25] hello and and this word United is one
[1:48:30] with him in agreement with him we're
[1:48:34] recognizing his
[1:48:36] responsibility his position
[1:48:40] hello as being our bridegroom as being
[1:48:44] our
[1:48:45] head that's right we've transferred all
[1:48:48] rights over to him amen it's his
[1:48:52] responsib ility and he alone to take
[1:48:54] care of
[1:48:56] us true yes sir that's right
[1:49:02] amen so we find he says see beloved this
[1:49:06] is the Key of David God being Sovereign
[1:49:08] he fornew by Divine Cree exactly who
[1:49:11] would be in his bride he chose her she
[1:49:13] did not choose him he called her she did
[1:49:16] not come on her own right he died for
[1:49:18] her he washed her in his own blood he
[1:49:20] paid the price for her she belongs to to
[1:49:23] him and to him alone amen and she is
[1:49:26] wholly committed to him and he accepts
[1:49:29] the obligation he is her head for Christ
[1:49:33] is the head of his church amen and so is
[1:49:37] it when we when we what we've done is
[1:49:40] when we've come in
[1:49:43] Union as as men we we've accepted that
[1:49:47] responsibility as the
[1:49:49] headship head of her home not not not a
[1:49:53] slave driver you understand that that's
[1:49:56] what the world wants to depict and
[1:49:58] that's what men have some a lot of men
[1:50:00] have become to make it a a curse that's
[1:50:03] true look upon as a
[1:50:05] shame but God has never made that to be
[1:50:09] but as men of our home as as husbands as
[1:50:13] fathers we accept that responsibility
[1:50:15] the obligation to be a provider to be a
[1:50:18] protector and not only in the natural
[1:50:21] but the spiritual
[1:50:27] can you say
[1:50:30] Amen so see he is her head for Christ is
[1:50:33] the head of his church as Sarah called
[1:50:35] Abraham Lord even so the bride is happy
[1:50:38] that he is her Lord amen he speaks and
[1:50:41] she obeys for that is her Delight can
[1:50:45] you say Amen well do you love the Lord
[1:50:48] amen the Lord we're finding
[1:50:52] that today we are seeing exactly the
[1:50:56] opposite in the majority of the
[1:50:59] world and
[1:51:01] and it is actually fulfilling what Peter
[1:51:04] said would be in second Peter
[1:51:07] 2:10 they are walking after the Flesh in
[1:51:09] the lust of
[1:51:11] uncleanness they despise government
[1:51:14] Authority they are
[1:51:15] presumptuous which means arrogant bold
[1:51:20] daring proud insolent
[1:51:23] and they are self-willed meaning
[1:51:27] self-pleasing and I I thought of this
[1:51:29] word presumptions uh and how we see that
[1:51:33] quite a bit in this
[1:51:34] age and one example in the Bible of
[1:51:37] someone being presumption is is found in
[1:51:40] in Revelations
[1:51:43] 2:2 where God says I Know Thy Works thy
[1:51:45] labor and thy patience and how thou can
[1:51:48] bear not bear them which are evil and
[1:51:52] thou has tried them which say they are
[1:51:54] Apostles and are not and has found them
[1:51:58] liars and in other words they're
[1:52:03] presumptuous in the fact that they dared
[1:52:06] and bold enough to call themselves
[1:52:08] Apostles when God has not declared them
[1:52:10] to be
[1:52:12] so and they've appointed themselves to
[1:52:14] something that God did not appoint them
[1:52:16] to and therefore it's it's it's an
[1:52:19] arrogant spirit that would dare claim
[1:52:22] something that God has not declared amen
[1:52:25] yes and so the prophet would call them
[1:52:29] presumptuous and of course this is the
[1:52:31] character of Satan for in Isaiah 14:13
[1:52:34] God said to him thou Hast said in thine
[1:52:37] heart I will Ascend into heaven I will
[1:52:40] exalt my throne above the stars of God I
[1:52:43] will sit also upon the Mount of the
[1:52:44] congregation in the sides of the north I
[1:52:46] will Ascend above the heights of the
[1:52:48] clouds I will be like the most high so
[1:52:51] he assumes a position position that he
[1:52:53] has no authority to do so by God God has
[1:52:58] not exalted him to that position God is
[1:53:00] not giving him that but he assumes this
[1:53:04] oh
[1:53:05] presumptuous can you say amen amen so
[1:53:08] this is exactly what we're dealing with
[1:53:10] in the age today young
[1:53:13] people is that that this Spirit of of of
[1:53:18] presumptuous the people are taking upon
[1:53:21] themselves to redefine everything that
[1:53:25] God has wanted or
[1:53:28] ordained the redefining family yeah do
[1:53:31] you realize that family the way God
[1:53:34] intended is is just about extinct
[1:53:38] right they're redefining family
[1:53:40] redefining marriage redefining the role
[1:53:43] of husband and wife redefining
[1:53:46] redefining the role of parenting
[1:53:49] redefining the church redef ining the
[1:53:54] ministry redefining everything that's
[1:53:57] right that's right and and and they're
[1:53:59] doing so by being
[1:54:01] presumptuous taking it upon themselves
[1:54:04] to change something and make it an
[1:54:07] authority without God approving
[1:54:10] it amen men want to be men women want to
[1:54:14] be you know uh or men want to be women
[1:54:16] and and and as we talked about see and
[1:54:19] and and so they're presumptuous because
[1:54:22] they despise government brother brandham
[1:54:25] used the word for this layout of see and
[1:54:27] age
[1:54:29] lawlessness yeah can you say that with
[1:54:31] me
[1:54:32] lawlessness they have no headship
[1:54:34] because they despise it we see this
[1:54:37] nationally do we not we see this
[1:54:40] internationally no one has respect for
[1:54:43] authority no our government doesn't have
[1:54:45] respect for other governments and other
[1:54:46] governments don't have respect of our
[1:54:48] government and and and and employees
[1:54:50] don't have respect for their bosses
[1:54:52] anymore more and and and and and
[1:54:54] congregations doesn't have respect for
[1:54:55] their Minister anymore and ministers
[1:54:57] don't have respect for other ministers
[1:54:59] and and and it's just constant even even
[1:55:02] children don't have respect for their
[1:55:03] parents anymore that's
[1:55:07] right and and and it's it's because you
[1:55:10] know and so we see all of this in the
[1:55:12] workplace in the home in the church and
[1:55:14] and all of these things it's
[1:55:16] presumptuous lawlessness despising
[1:55:19] government but then notice at this time
[1:55:24] God says I will send unto you Elijah the
[1:55:28] prophet before the coming of the great
[1:55:32] and Dreadful
[1:55:33] day I will send you a prophet amen and
[1:55:38] under this
[1:55:41] Prophet under the headship amen it's
[1:55:44] true you're going to start constructing
[1:55:46] your families you're going to start
[1:55:49] constructing a church the way I would
[1:55:50] want it to be amen deacons are going to
[1:55:53] be acting like deacons the way God wants
[1:55:55] them to be husbands are going to be
[1:55:57] husbands the way God wants them to be
[1:55:59] wives are going to be wives the way God
[1:56:00] wants children are going to be children
[1:56:02] the way God wants them to be churches
[1:56:04] are going to be churches the way God
[1:56:06] wants them to be can you say Amen why
[1:56:10] they've come under a
[1:56:12] headship GL HL and by
[1:56:16] this the wrath of God is passing over
[1:56:19] them oh Hallelujah can you say amen amen
[1:56:22] amen you don't have to
[1:56:24] fear do you love the Lord amen oh my the
[1:56:30] value of this message what's it doing
[1:56:33] it's bringing the church into agreement
[1:56:35] with one another no we've all got
[1:56:37] different ideas but it's bringing the
[1:56:40] church under a into agreement with God
[1:56:43] that's right it's bringing the home in
[1:56:46] agreement with God it's bringing our
[1:56:50] lives in agreement with God is bringing
[1:56:52] the ministry in agreement with God to
[1:56:55] where they're not just preaching any old
[1:56:56] thing they're coming in line with what
[1:56:59] God's will is for this
[1:57:01] age can you say Amen it's bringing the
[1:57:04] marriage into agreement with God
[1:57:07] bringing it all can you say amen and not
[1:57:10] only that it's going to bring the Heaven
[1:57:12] and Earth in agreement with God no sin
[1:57:15] no Sara no germs and diseases and and
[1:57:20] all that you realize it's the message of
[1:57:22] the hour it's bringing Sons and
[1:57:25] Daughters back into their position with
[1:57:27] in agreement under a
[1:57:29] headship
[1:57:31] Hallelujah and because they've come back
[1:57:34] into manifestation and back into their
[1:57:37] right place this world this Earth the
[1:57:41] heavens is coming back to way God made
[1:57:43] it to be a restored
[1:57:46] Eden Hallelujah do you love
[1:57:49] him Brethren it is so important to be
[1:57:53] guided by the word amen let the word be
[1:57:57] your answer to every question
[1:58:01] amen you believe it amen if the
[1:58:04] musicians will
[1:58:16] come ever since the fall of Man the
[1:58:19] woman has tried to take control of man
[1:58:23] and she has been successful in doing so
[1:58:27] to where today it is a woman's world
[1:58:30] right she's the goddess of America right
[1:58:34] brother Brown said she's the goddess of
[1:58:36] America being a naked female that's
[1:58:40] right but he also tells us that a woman
[1:58:42] is not meant to have an iron
[1:58:46] disposition she is to be submissive to
[1:58:48] the male it's the Commandment that God
[1:58:50] gave her
[1:58:52] and he said woman who is truly female
[1:58:55] all female will be of that disposition
[1:58:57] not a doormat no real male makes a
[1:59:00] female ad
[1:59:01] dormant but she will want to be under
[1:59:03] Authority and not rule over the male for
[1:59:07] he is the head of the
[1:59:08] house if she breaks that image that God
[1:59:11] made for her she is perverted any male
[1:59:13] that lets the woman take the authority
[1:59:15] also has broken that image and he is
[1:59:18] perverted that is why a woman cannot
[1:59:21] wear that which pertains to a man or cut
[1:59:23] her hair she is never to wear garments
[1:59:25] that pertain to a male or cut her hair
[1:59:28] when she does she is intruding into the
[1:59:31] male domain taking Authority and
[1:59:33] perverting
[1:59:34] herself now do you know that the natural
[1:59:37] is a type of the
[1:59:39] spiritual God never made the
[1:59:42] church to be her own headship or to
[1:59:45] usurp authority over her over
[1:59:48] Christ right that's right this is why
[1:59:52] Romans 12:2 Paul tells the church be not
[1:59:55] conformed to this world but be ye
[1:59:57] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[2:00:00] that you may prove what is that good and
[2:00:02] acceptable and perfect will of God
[2:00:05] notice the prophet said it's the nature
[2:00:06] of the church to surrender to Christ
[2:00:08] surrender to his will Just Surrender
[2:00:12] right she has no thinking of her own she
[2:00:16] takes his word and not somebody else's
[2:00:19] if Eve would have done that we' never
[2:00:21] had to die but she listened to
[2:00:23] reasonings but the real bride of Christ
[2:00:24] takes the headship of Christ the word
[2:00:27] and only believes God's word that's the
[2:00:30] real the restored Bride Can you say amen
[2:00:35] amen oh do you love
[2:00:38] him I'm so glad that I'm part of the
[2:00:41] Church of Jesus
[2:00:45] Christ that we could submit to our
[2:00:47] headship as we're trying to lead our
[2:00:50] families
[2:00:52] and I want to
[2:00:54] say to you Brothers
