[41:37] um we appreciate u being able to um you
[41:41] know have services um at other places
[41:45] when we ain't able to meet but uh we are
[41:48] certainly glad to be able to meet here
[41:49] tonight and may be a little warm but
[41:52] we'll survive. Um,
[41:56] uh, Brother
[41:58] Daniel Cross has ordered the part that
[42:00] we're needing, uh, for the AC and, uh,
[42:04] so the Lord willing, he'll be, uh, he's
[42:07] planning on coming, I think Friday, is
[42:09] it? And, u, uh, to, uh, help us get this
[42:13] fixed. And so, uh, we appreciate Brother
[42:17] Daniel being willing to do that.
[42:20] Uh so uh Lord willing uh Sunday we'll
[42:23] have some AC or heat whatever we need at
[42:27] the time. And uh but um also uh if you
[42:32] have your Bibles we're just going to
[42:34] turn to the book of Genesis first of
[42:36] all.
[42:39] And um as it was said we want to keep
[42:42] Brother Terry in our prayer as he's
[42:45] traveling. He's actually headed to
[42:46] Missouri and uh to see a son and so uh
[42:50] we want to keep him in prayer and
[42:52] brother Amos, sister Lisa on the road uh
[42:55] tonight. And so um may the Lord just be
[42:59] with them. But um before we go into the
[43:03] word, may we just bow our heads and talk
[43:05] to our Lord. Father,
[43:09] we're so glad that you have made us and
[43:12] designed us, Lord, that we could be
[43:16] yielded to you and that you could work
[43:20] through us and perform your will, your
[43:25] desire in us, Father. And that's
[43:27] certainly our hunger. That's what we
[43:30] want you to do, Lord. and help us,
[43:32] Father, to yield ourselves more and more
[43:36] to you and to die daily, Father, that uh
[43:40] you could have the preeminence in our
[43:42] lives. And we pray, Father, that you
[43:45] would meet tonight with us. And Lord,
[43:48] speak to our hearts, Lord. And we know
[43:51] as the prophet said, you could have
[43:54] chose anything to preach the gospel, but
[43:56] you chose man. And father, as I stand
[44:00] here behind this sacred desk, I ask that
[44:03] you would use me and help me to yield
[44:06] myself to you and that you could speak
[44:08] to your people. Bless what simple words
[44:11] we would have. Just a simple thought,
[44:14] but Lord, if you would take it and
[44:16] multiply it, that's what would matter to
[44:18] us. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name.
[44:23] Amen. And amen. Praise the Lord. So we
[44:28] want to look at Genesis the 49th chapter
[44:32] and um uh the 10th verse
[44:37] and um it says the scepter shall not
[44:40] depart from Judah nor a lawgiver from
[44:44] between his feet until Shiloh come and
[44:47] unto him
[44:49] shall the gathering of the people be.
[44:52] Unto him shall the gathering of the
[44:55] people be. Um, if you want to turn to
[44:58] Matthew the 24th chapter,
[45:02] Matthew chap 24
[45:05] and um
[45:08] verse 27 and 28 we will read.
[45:14] It says, "For as the lightning cometh
[45:17] out of the east and shineth even unto
[45:19] the west, so shall also the coming of
[45:23] the son of man be. For whethersoever the
[45:26] carcass is, there will the eagles be
[45:31] gathered together.
[45:33] Amen. You can have your seats. And in
[45:36] case you're wondering who the gathering
[45:39] would be, uh there
[45:42] as we read there in Genesis, uh Jesus
[45:45] would answer that by telling us it'll be
[45:49] the son of man. The son of man. I uh if
[45:54] I have a title, it'd be uh we have been
[45:57] gathered unto him. Amen. And I'm so glad
[46:01] for that. I'm I'm glad that we you know
[46:05] that God has made it uh to where we can
[46:09] easily identify ourselves
[46:12] &gt;&gt; in this age. So so much confusion as to
[46:16] you know what is what uh got you know
[46:21] females um
[46:24] confused on what they are you know
[46:27] whether they're a male or a cat or
[46:30] whatever and uh uh and and you got males
[46:34] doing the same thing. They're confused
[46:36] on the gender that they are and
[46:38] everybody's just confused. a day of
[46:40] confusion. But we can identify ourselves
[46:44] and um easily and so we don't have to
[46:47] wonder who we are. We don't have to uh
[46:51] wonder what we are doing or what is
[46:53] happening in in us or uh to us. We we
[46:57] have uh able to identify and uh God in
[47:02] creation as as he was creating he
[47:06] designed things that would reflect him
[47:09] and his people. Uh whether it be the
[47:13] trees or the flowers or even in the
[47:16] animal kingdom
[47:18] um everything was designed to reflect
[47:22] something to to reflect nature of of
[47:25] humanity. And so God designed everything
[47:28] that he could uh be seen in nature. Uh
[47:32] you know, brother Brandham said that um
[47:35] uh his first Bible uh was nature. Uh he
[47:39] could see God in nature and and know
[47:42] that there was a God. And so so we see
[47:45] that uh God is an eagle and and um and
[47:49] and here we find the eagles will be
[47:52] gathered. Uh he could have said, "Well,
[47:54] the sons of God would be gathered." But
[47:57] again, he says the eagles will be
[48:00] gathered. Well, uh the prophet says, you
[48:03] know, God is an eagle. Uh Jehovah there
[48:07] in the Old Testament likens himself as
[48:10] the eagle. Uh uh his prophets are
[48:14] eagles. And God likens his people as
[48:19] eagles. Eaglets. Uh Jehovah's eaglets.
[48:22] if we could say it that way. And so, but
[48:25] but there there's a reason why that he
[48:28] would uh uh symbolize the eagle as being
[48:33] uh uh representing us and uh you know,
[48:38] the prophet talked about eagles and and
[48:41] a lot and and but there's a lot of
[48:43] characteristics that an eagle has that
[48:46] reflect God and and reflect his people.
[48:50] And and one of the things the word
[48:53] eagle, the prophet would tell us, means
[48:55] a feeder with the beak, one that feeds
[48:59] with the mouth. And so that's that's
[49:02] exactly what God does. He he feeds his
[49:05] children by his mouth. And the Bible
[49:08] says the uh uh man shall not live by
[49:12] bread alone, but by every word that
[49:15] proceeds from the mouth of God. And so
[49:19] then we we see that the word coming out
[49:22] of God's mouth is where the eagllets are
[49:27] going to be because that's how they're
[49:30] fed. They they can't be fed by nothing
[49:32] else. They cannot be fed by seminary.
[49:35] They they can't be fed by Dr. So and so
[49:38] or psychologist so and so or whatever.
[49:42] It's fed by the mouth of God. Ain't that
[49:45] right? And we know that the word of God
[49:48] comes to a prophet. And so, uh, when
[49:51] when the word comes to a prophet, Jesus
[49:53] says that the prophets are gods. Amen.
[49:57] They're they're gods because they have
[49:58] the word of God that has come to them.
[50:01] And when they're speaking, it's food uh
[50:04] in in the season. Amen. And so, we're
[50:08] we're not gathered now. Uh Jesus would
[50:12] tell us, you see, we're we're gathered
[50:14] around the carcass. We're not gathered
[50:16] around politics. Amen. Uh uh we're we're
[50:20] we're not gathered around a political
[50:23] speech as the prophet said or a social
[50:26] gathering. We're not gathered around
[50:29] some sports event or or or whatever.
[50:33] Those things are not our food. Can you
[50:37] say amen? Amen. But what is our food
[50:41] must come out of the mouth of God. And
[50:45] what comes out of God's mouth? Nothing
[50:48] but promises.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because whatever God said, he is
[50:53] going to do. So then we're feeding not
[50:56] off of of some whim of man or some idea
[51:00] or a suggestion. We're feeding off the
[51:04] very promised word of God. Amen. And so,
[51:09] uh, uh, as the prophet said, eagles love
[51:12] holding on to God's word. It's, it's the
[51:15] only food that they will eat. Ain't that
[51:18] right? Another thing is an eagle will
[51:20] fly higher than any other bird. Amen. If
[51:23] if a h a hawk would try to uh or any
[51:27] bird would try to uh uh find fly up as
[51:32] as high as the eagle. Well, uh uh you
[51:36] know, he would lose his oxygen. He's not
[51:39] he's not built to fly that that high in
[51:42] the heights and and and the prophet
[51:45] said, you know, he'd just disintegrate
[51:47] and and his feathers would fall out and
[51:50] and all of these things. So, anyone that
[51:52] would try to impersonate an eagle uh or
[51:56] anything that would try to impersonate
[51:58] would would burst because they can't
[52:00] stand the pressure that an eagle uh uh
[52:04] can. And so, another thing, eagles can
[52:07] see farther than than any any other
[52:10] bird. They talk how an hawk can can can
[52:14] has has great eyesight, but the prophet
[52:16] said that that there's no comparison
[52:18] between a hawk and an eagle as to what
[52:21] they they can see. Amen. And and so that
[52:25] eagle is so much stronger than any bird
[52:29] because he's built much more powerful uh
[52:33] uh than than any. The prophet says he
[52:36] has to have a special build or he cannot
[52:40] stand it up there. See, a a a bird has
[52:43] to have be specially built uh uh in
[52:46] order to to to stay up there. So, an an
[52:49] eagle can it's not that the eagle just
[52:52] decides, I'm going to fly up there. God
[52:54] made him God designed him to be able to
[52:58] stand the pressure. And you know how he
[53:01] gets up there? By his wings. Amen. The
[53:03] winds are blowing and he takes his wings
[53:06] and he begins to soar upon the winds and
[53:10] and it takes him higher. Now the prophet
[53:12] says our wings is the old and new
[53:15] testament. Ain't that right? When the
[53:17] trials come, your wings is the old and
[53:20] new testament. That if you'll use them
[53:22] right, you can fly, amen, higher than
[53:25] any other thing around. Amen. You can
[53:28] use the winds of adversity. something
[53:31] that would blow a sparrow down and and
[53:34] drive a something little old bird down.
[53:37] Amen. You can take them wings and you
[53:39] can fly higher and higher and higher
[53:43] into the heavenlies. So, so the prophet
[53:47] said, you know, if he got up there in
[53:49] into those rims, he has to be his body
[53:53] has to be made up in order to stand
[53:56] those fears that he's in. If any other
[53:59] bird tried to follow him and would get
[54:01] into that place, even the hawk, he'd
[54:02] smother. He can't and couldn't breathe.
[54:05] He said, I say this with respect. That's
[54:07] where we get today with a lot of hawks
[54:10] that are trying to follow the eagles.
[54:12] See, they get up there and they say,
[54:14] "Well, I can't stand this. This makes me
[54:17] nervous. Let me out of here." Amen. And
[54:20] and we see them bailing out on the
[54:22] message. Right? See, they can't even sit
[54:25] through one meeting. They just smother
[54:27] to death. They're They're not built
[54:29] right. They're not built for that
[54:31] atmosphere. I want to say this, the
[54:33] closer you get to God, the more troubles
[54:35] you're going to have. Amen. But but a
[54:38] Christian is built for it. Amen. To
[54:41] where they can stand the pressures. Can
[54:43] you say amen? Amen. They're not going to
[54:46] back down. They're not going to give up.
[54:48] They're not going to say, "Well, it's
[54:49] just too hard. I'd rather just stay down
[54:51] here." Well, you can stay down here.
[54:54] Amen. But eagles are built to go up
[54:56] higher. Amen. See, and so we we find
[55:00] that there have been people who who
[55:02] claim to be like the eagles that Jesus
[55:05] is speaking of. Amen. But they're not
[55:08] able to to withstand uh uh the
[55:11] atmosphere of the supernatural. Amen.
[55:14] And you know, uh, Brother Bram said,
[55:16] someone said to hear not long ago, I was
[55:19] preaching and there was a woman while I
[55:21] was preaching was weeping and she just
[55:23] got so full till she just screamed out,
[55:26] "Hallelujah." And I met that uh I said,
[55:29] "I met a fella which was a Sunday school
[55:31] teacher and he ran and he had a baseball
[55:34] team of the First Baptist church in our
[55:36] city and he said, "Billy, I was enjoying
[55:39] that message till that woman started
[55:40] crying." And he says, "It just made
[55:43] shivers run over my back." I said, "If
[55:45] you ever got to heaven, you would freeze
[55:47] to death." Oh my. This is such a minor
[55:50] thing, but you you have to be able to
[55:52] stand it. And God makes you up that way
[55:55] if you're an eagle. He says, you know,
[55:58] if he if he speaking of that man, if he
[56:00] got up there and and seen the miracles
[56:03] are happening, seen the signs and
[56:05] wonders of God moving and and believes
[56:08] that the days of miracles would be would
[56:10] is past, he' just disintegrate and fall
[56:13] out. That's what's the matter with a lot
[56:15] of people today. They claim to be
[56:17] eagles, but I wonder, ain't that right?
[56:20] See, and so th this explains as to why
[56:23] people can so easily walk away from the
[56:26] message. They're tired of the message.
[56:27] They they find that they're exhausted
[56:30] with the message and and and like the
[56:33] message ain't helping them and it ain't
[56:34] doing any good and we need to go back
[56:37] and they fall back to denominations or
[56:39] they fall back to the world. Well, they
[56:42] weren't designed, amen, to follow the
[56:45] message of the hour. They they weren't
[56:48] designed to soar into the heavenlies and
[56:51] and and and see the mighty power of God
[56:55] on display. Ain't that right? See, you
[56:58] have to you have to be an eagle. Amen.
[57:02] Uh to live in the heavenly atmosphere
[57:05] where all things are possible. How many
[57:07] believes eagles live up that way? Amen.
[57:09] Why? Amen. Because they can see further.
[57:12] They can see further than their trial.
[57:14] They can see further than their
[57:16] sickness. They can see further, amen,
[57:18] than the impossibilities. They see
[57:20] things that are possible that no one
[57:22] else can see because they've got the
[57:24] vision for it. Can you say amen? Amen.
[57:28] See, and so the prophet said, when God
[57:30] bs a child into his family, that man has
[57:34] a makeup, something that can stand the
[57:37] supernatural, that can uh differentiate
[57:40] between the real and the unreal. uh the
[57:43] one who knows what real eagle food is.
[57:47] See, so a man, amen, that is birthed,
[57:50] got that new birth, is is been born in
[57:53] Jesus Christ and and and born into the
[57:56] family, he's an eagle. Amen. He's got
[57:59] that nature of an eagle. God ain't going
[58:01] to give a hawk the Holy Ghost and he
[58:03] just sits around and make excuses as to
[58:06] why he can't fly. Amen.
[58:08] You see, if you ever see an eagle that
[58:11] can't get up in the heights is because
[58:13] he's bound. He's in a He's in a cage. A
[58:16] Can you say amen? But a Holy Ghost, the
[58:19] Holy Ghost comes into that man, that
[58:21] woman, that boy or girl, and sets them
[58:24] free. Amen. From the cage and and
[58:27] man-made religions and unbeliefs of the
[58:29] devil that they can soar up there. And
[58:32] once they they begin to soar up there,
[58:34] they say, "This is where I belong."
[58:37] Amen. They won't won't look down and
[58:38] say, "I wished I could go back down that
[58:40] way and oh, this is so hard. I barely
[58:42] can breathe and I just I just don't know
[58:45] what's going to happen." Oh, no. They're
[58:47] happy. Can you say amen? They're happy.
[58:50] Amen. Denying the world. They're just
[58:52] happy. Amen. Soaring and and enjoying
[58:55] the blessings of God. Amen. People that
[58:58] just complain about being a Christian. I
[59:01] I don't know about it. Amen. I You just
[59:03] wonder about their real experience.
[59:05] people that just complain. They they
[59:08] have to give up this and they have to
[59:09] give up that they just have to give up
[59:11] this. I just don't understand. See,
[59:13] amen. Because the nature of an eagle,
[59:15] you never see him say, "Oh, do I really
[59:17] have to go up that high? I I just don't
[59:20] understand." You know, if if I could
[59:22] just go down here, I just wish the winds
[59:23] would quit blowing so I just wouldn't
[59:25] automatically put my wings out and start
[59:27] flying. It's just an automatic thing.
[59:30] Can you say amen? We love God. We love
[59:32] what we do. We we love giving everything
[59:35] up for our Lord and and serving him with
[59:38] everything we've got. Amen. See, and so,
[59:42] you know, if you if you ever just
[59:45] watched uh uh uh little eagllets and
[59:48] when mama comes down with food, man,
[59:50] they've got their necks stretched out
[59:51] and and their mouths wide open. Amen.
[59:54] Because they know, amen, mama has come
[59:57] to feed them. Ain't that right? So here
[1:00:00] we're gathered around the carcass and
[1:00:02] and the prophet tells us the carcass is
[1:00:05] the fresh kill of the word. It's the
[1:00:09] word that's raised up and and fattened
[1:00:13] and and being made manifest and give out
[1:00:17] as food for the children. Ain't that
[1:00:19] right? See, and so we we find that God
[1:00:23] is the word now. Amen. God the prophet
[1:00:26] put that within us that God is the word.
[1:00:29] Amen. Can't separate God from the word.
[1:00:32] God is the word. Ain't that right? Amen.
[1:00:34] And and he's the one that said, "I am
[1:00:37] that I am." Amen. Not was, not going to
[1:00:41] be. Amen. Not will be. I am that I am.
[1:00:45] Amen. He's the fresh kill of the word.
[1:00:48] He's He's the freshness. Can you say
[1:00:50] amen? That's right. So, he's always
[1:00:52] present tense. Always. And when you're
[1:00:55] feeding off God, you're feeding off the
[1:00:57] present tense God. Amen. Not something
[1:00:59] have gone down yesterday and and all
[1:01:02] that. And so the prophet says when the
[1:01:04] power of God begins to fall according to
[1:01:07] the word of God, real genuine eagles
[1:01:10] will come to that feast. Where are they
[1:01:13] going to come? To the power of God.
[1:01:16] Amen. When it's in the Bible, it's a
[1:01:18] biblical happening. It's a biblical
[1:01:21] power. We ain't just accepting anything,
[1:01:24] amen, and calling it power, but we're
[1:01:26] looking at it and we're discerning it by
[1:01:28] the scripture. And we can see that this
[1:01:31] is God. Amen. And it's our feast. It's a
[1:01:35] feast. Can you say amen? And eagles,
[1:01:38] genuine eagles, will come to that feast.
[1:01:40] There ain't nothing in the world will
[1:01:43] keep them away from there. Ain't that
[1:01:45] right? Now, as as you you all know the
[1:01:49] different types of birds and things and
[1:01:51] and they it so it's nobrainer. Amen. But
[1:01:55] chickens have their own food that they
[1:01:57] gather around, right? Amen. That's
[1:02:00] right. Amen. And the prophet said they
[1:02:02] they just scratch around in the manure
[1:02:04] pile. Amen. Getting them little worms
[1:02:06] and a little this and a little that.
[1:02:08] They they they they don't have, you
[1:02:10] know, that's their diet and that's what
[1:02:12] they fellowship around. That's what they
[1:02:14] gather around. Well, buzzards have their
[1:02:16] own diet that that they all gather
[1:02:18] around and and and they eat food that's
[1:02:21] been dead and rotten uh uh uh for for a
[1:02:25] while, stinking and and and you'll see
[1:02:28] them every every once in a while, you
[1:02:30] know, you'll see them buzzards flying
[1:02:32] around and you automatically know
[1:02:34] something died, you know, something
[1:02:36] dead, something stinking somewhere, and
[1:02:38] that's they're gathering around for a
[1:02:40] feast. Ain't that right? Amen. See, they
[1:02:42] swarm around that. Amen. See, well, if a
[1:02:46] man is gathered around something that is
[1:02:48] dead and rotten that's been dead for a
[1:02:52] long time, church, his experience will
[1:02:55] talk of that. Amen. And he will try to
[1:02:58] convince you that God is not doing
[1:03:00] miracles today. Amen. He'll convince you
[1:03:03] that God's not the same as he was
[1:03:06] yesterday. Amen. Because he's feasting
[1:03:09] off something that is long dead. Can you
[1:03:11] say amen? He will not experience the God
[1:03:15] that is the I am that I am. Amen. He
[1:03:18] He'll just talk about a God that was.
[1:03:21] Ain't that right? Amen. See, so he will
[1:03:24] think that the days of miracles is
[1:03:25] passed. He will believe that God doesn't
[1:03:28] do anything than that what he used to
[1:03:30] do. Amen. Because the word that he is
[1:03:33] feeding on, Amen. has no life in it.
[1:03:36] Now, if you'll notice that the Pharisees
[1:03:38] and the Sadducees were the buzzards in
[1:03:42] Jesus's day when when Jesus was on the
[1:03:46] earth, there there was different types.
[1:03:48] And and and the prophet called them the
[1:03:51] Pharisees and the Sadducees, he said
[1:03:52] they were buzzards. Amen. See, and and
[1:03:55] and well, how do you know that? Well,
[1:03:57] they were gathered around Moses's
[1:03:59] message. See, and and they were eaten
[1:04:02] from Moses's message. Amen. And and the
[1:04:06] prophet said, "They knew Moses, but they
[1:04:08] didn't know Jesus." They knew Moses, but
[1:04:10] they didn't know the fresh kill of the
[1:04:12] word. Can you say amen? Well, see,
[1:04:14] Moses's message was good when it was
[1:04:17] fresh.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? See, and and in that
[1:04:22] when it was fresh, notice what it did.
[1:04:25] It brought Israel out of Egypt. It
[1:04:28] provided a token for them to get under.
[1:04:31] Amen. It it provided an atonement for
[1:04:34] the people. It produced a smitten rock
[1:04:36] that followed them, it had the angel of
[1:04:39] the covenant with it. Ain't that right?
[1:04:41] Moses's message, while it was fresh, it
[1:04:44] was a message of deliverance. Ain't that
[1:04:48] right? But by the time Jesus got there
[1:04:51] on earth, that message had long died. It
[1:04:54] was rotten. It was maggoty. Amen. And it
[1:04:58] wasn't fit for the age, amen, that them
[1:05:01] Pharisees were living in. There was no
[1:05:03] power. There was no supernatural. There
[1:05:06] was no God in that message. Amen. Can
[1:05:10] you say amen? That's right. See, and so
[1:05:13] that's what the the Pharisees were
[1:05:15] gathered around. The supernatural was
[1:05:18] gone. And so they were eating it, but
[1:05:21] they weren't experiencing life from it.
[1:05:23] They were eating it, but they weren't
[1:05:25] experiencing the supernatural. Amen. uh
[1:05:28] uh that that that it happened uh uh uh
[1:05:32] when it was fresh. Can you say amen? So,
[1:05:35] Brother Brown said they were buzzards.
[1:05:37] See, and they felt they didn't need the
[1:05:39] fresh food of that day. See, they were
[1:05:43] taking the carcass of Moses's day and
[1:05:46] trying to gloat over it after God had
[1:05:49] given the type in the wilderness of
[1:05:51] fresh mana each night, meaning each
[1:05:54] generation. Amen. That's where they
[1:05:56] failed. It poisoned them. It killed them
[1:06:00] to eat that contaminated food. And
[1:06:02] spiritually, it does the same thing
[1:06:04] today. It kills them spiritually with a
[1:06:08] denomination. And and the prophet said
[1:06:10] that's how they crucified the Lord of
[1:06:12] glory. Amen. They were eating maggots
[1:06:14] food. They were eating a dead rotten
[1:06:17] food that had been dead long time ago.
[1:06:20] And they couldn't recognize the food
[1:06:23] that God was giving them in that hour.
[1:06:28] Now, the prophet said, "See, Jesus
[1:06:30] didn't serve the people leftovers from
[1:06:33] Moses's teaching, you know, by teaching
[1:06:36] Moses's message." Can you say amen? He
[1:06:39] was the word then. Jesus was the word
[1:06:42] then that he was given to the people.
[1:06:46] Ain't that right? Amen. To be eating and
[1:06:48] and these things. And so, he was feeding
[1:06:51] them the fresh kill of the word for that
[1:06:54] day. Now the prophet said Israel was
[1:06:57] called in that day to the wedding feast.
[1:07:00] Amen. And and uh the the feast of the
[1:07:03] wedding supper and Israel turned it down
[1:07:06] and went into judgment. See, they stoned
[1:07:09] and killed the prophets that was sent to
[1:07:11] them by making excuses. Amen. See, well,
[1:07:15] in the Old Testament, you know, God uh
[1:07:17] fed the children by by uh uh mana
[1:07:21] falling from heaven and and as they were
[1:07:24] on their journey and and he he fed them
[1:07:28] and and but he told them he said only
[1:07:30] store up the the food for that day.
[1:07:33] Don't don't don't save any don't store
[1:07:36] up any for tomorrow uh or anything like
[1:07:39] that, but just save for today. That's
[1:07:41] it. you know, and uh uh when they when
[1:07:44] they did save up for the next day,
[1:07:46] didn't listen, it it turned worms and
[1:07:49] maggots and it it spoiled. Ain't that
[1:07:51] right? And it was a type and the shadow
[1:07:54] of today. Amen. See, and so uh if you
[1:07:58] notice, the eagles were to only eat
[1:08:02] Moses's message. Amen. uh uh for that
[1:08:06] day. The eagles were only to eat Moses's
[1:08:10] message for that day. Ain't that right?
[1:08:13] See, so the prophet said there was some
[1:08:15] of it left over the next day, but it was
[1:08:18] no good. See? Amen. Uh uh the eagles may
[1:08:21] have not ate everything and and was left
[1:08:23] over. Amen. What was left over, it was
[1:08:26] no good. It it it didn't mount to
[1:08:29] nothing. See, but the prophet said the
[1:08:31] eagles knew they they knew that there
[1:08:34] was something else coming. And so they
[1:08:38] were waiting to see something else.
[1:08:41] Ain't that right? See, he says the word
[1:08:43] they say here. It's here. It's supposed
[1:08:46] to come. We had caribou yesterday. We
[1:08:49] have sheep tomorrow. See? See what I
[1:08:51] mean? There is old caribou carcass down
[1:08:54] there gloating, but we've got sheep
[1:08:57] coming today. Where is it at? See what I
[1:08:59] mean? Angels food. See, the people that
[1:09:02] eat mana one day, if they tried to keep
[1:09:04] it over the next day, it just got
[1:09:06] contaminated. So notice what he says
[1:09:08] now. Luther had a message of repentance,
[1:09:12] but you bunch of Lutheran buzzards. He
[1:09:15] says, Baptists had a message, but you
[1:09:17] Baptist buzzards and Pentecostals had
[1:09:21] had a message coming home now, but now
[1:09:23] it's Pentecostal buzzards. Ain't that
[1:09:26] right? See? And so, so we find that the
[1:09:29] the the buzzards come after the life has
[1:09:32] gone out of the meat, out of the the
[1:09:34] food, and now it's nothing left. Amen.
[1:09:37] It it was good in its time. Amen. It was
[1:09:41] good in its day, but we're not living in
[1:09:44] the day of Luther. We're not living in
[1:09:46] the day of Pentecost. We're living in a
[1:09:48] bride age.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And so every
[1:09:52] denomination now is is is nothing but a
[1:09:56] storehouse of rotten maggoty food. I say
[1:10:00] that now it's nothing against people.
[1:10:02] It's against the system. Amen. That's
[1:10:05] what it is. It's the system that's
[1:10:08] drawing the people and deceiving the
[1:10:10] people in the name of Christianity.
[1:10:13] Ain't that right? But now the Lutheran,
[1:10:15] they had fresh meat under Luther's
[1:10:18] message. Amen. in Luther's day. Ain't
[1:10:21] that right? And so the prophet said,
[1:10:23] "You couldn't feed a Lutheran uh the the
[1:10:26] carry on that the Catholics were eating.
[1:10:28] You you just couldn't do that." Well,
[1:10:30] then the Methodists in Wesley's day,
[1:10:33] they had fresh meat. And you you
[1:10:36] wouldn't be able to convince Methodists
[1:10:38] in Wesley's day, amen, to turn back and
[1:10:41] start eating, Amen. Luther's uh uh food
[1:10:45] of of the food of Luther's day. It it it
[1:10:48] was rotten. It it was no good. Can you
[1:10:50] say amen? See, so you couldn't feed him
[1:10:53] Luther's message. The life was already
[1:10:56] gone from it. It was maggoty. And the
[1:10:58] prophet says, "Neither can you feed the
[1:11:00] bride of Jesus Christ." Pentecostalism.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, church?
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. There there's a certain diet that
[1:11:07] the we as the eagles are are are feeding
[1:11:11] from. You cannot feed the bride of
[1:11:13] Christ. Pentecostalism.
[1:11:18] No, you see Christ is being revealed in
[1:11:22] the promise of the age. You believe
[1:11:25] that?
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; In the promise of the age, the promises
[1:11:29] of the age. That's where Christ is being
[1:11:30] revealed. The promise of the age. That's
[1:11:33] where the carcass is. Amen. And that's
[1:11:35] where the eagles. Amen. See, that's what
[1:11:38] the churches, the prophet said, that's
[1:11:40] churches are gathered around. See, and
[1:11:42] he says churches doesn't mean
[1:11:44] denominations or organizations.
[1:11:46] It means groups of people of believers
[1:11:50] who are gathered together under the
[1:11:52] fellowship of the word.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Eating goes with fellowship. We've
[1:12:01] talked about it. Eating goes with
[1:12:03] fellowship and and uh eating accompanies
[1:12:07] fellowship. So where you gather to eat
[1:12:11] is where you have fellowship. Ain't that
[1:12:14] right? See fellowship. Eagles fellowship
[1:12:18] with eagles because they have the same
[1:12:21] things in common.
[1:12:23] Crows fellowship with crows because they
[1:12:26] have the same things in common. Chickens
[1:12:29] fellowship with chickens for the same
[1:12:31] reason. We've said it often. Birds of a
[1:12:34] feather flock together. Ain't that
[1:12:36] right?
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said, you take for
[1:12:38] instance crows and doves. They don't
[1:12:40] have any fellowship with each other
[1:12:42] because why? Their diet. Everybody say
[1:12:44] their diet is different. Their diet is
[1:12:48] different. Two different cravings, two
[1:12:50] different likes, two different
[1:12:51] appetites. Their diet is different. See,
[1:12:54] they they couldn't invite one another to
[1:12:57] dinner because the crow is a scavenger.
[1:13:00] He just eats on old dead carcass
[1:13:02] somewhere. See, and the dove doesn't
[1:13:05] have any gall. So, if he'd eat that
[1:13:07] stuff, it would kill it. It's a very
[1:13:09] good picture of the sinner and the
[1:13:10] Christian. I mean, when he's a real
[1:13:12] Christian. Ain't that right? See, so so
[1:13:15] now now please understand what what I'm
[1:13:18] saying here this this evening is is see
[1:13:21] fellowship with the wrong things can
[1:13:24] kill you spiritually.
[1:13:26] You believe that? Fellowshipping with
[1:13:29] the wrong things.
[1:13:31] You see people even in in a message
[1:13:34] church and they're so dead in their life
[1:13:36] and experience and so carnal is and you
[1:13:39] find out what they're thriving off, what
[1:13:41] they're feeding off of and it tells you
[1:13:43] something's wrong. They're their
[1:13:45] fellowship is is with the wrong things
[1:13:48] and it's killing them spiritually. Amen.
[1:13:51] See, a a person can be raised in the
[1:13:53] message and go to a message church and
[1:13:55] and and yet not be gathered around the
[1:13:58] carcass of the word if their heart's not
[1:14:01] there. Amen. Jesus says, "They honor me
[1:14:04] with their lips, but their heart is far
[1:14:05] from me, showing that they weren't
[1:14:08] really gathered around the carcass for
[1:14:10] that day. They they were just honoring
[1:14:12] with the lips, but their heart was
[1:14:14] somewhere out in the world." Can you say
[1:14:16] amen? Amen. See? And so then then it
[1:14:20] tells us that we've got to stay gathered
[1:14:22] around the word of God. Amen. Everybody
[1:14:25] say, "Stay gathered."
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Stay gathered around the word of God.
[1:14:31] Brother Brown said, "It's bad when you
[1:14:32] go to segregating with unbelievers who
[1:14:35] are worldly and ungodly. Separate
[1:14:37] yourselves from the things of the world.
[1:14:40] Come out. Don't be better. Try to act
[1:14:43] like you're better, but don't mar your
[1:14:46] garments with the sin. Don't be
[1:14:48] partakers of other men's sins. See, if
[1:14:52] you want to speak a word of
[1:14:53] encouragement to people, all right, but
[1:14:56] don't have to wallow with the pig, you
[1:14:58] stay away from it. How many believes
[1:15:01] that? You don't have to act snobby and
[1:15:03] and and and just like, you know,
[1:15:06] whatever, you know, but at the same
[1:15:08] time, don't don't wallow with that.
[1:15:11] That's not your fellowship. As I've told
[1:15:14] you before, if you if if you're strong
[1:15:16] enough and you want to witness to
[1:15:17] somebody, then witness to that person.
[1:15:19] But don't you let them talk you into
[1:15:22] things that they're doing.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; And condoning it.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; See, so now as believers, we have things
[1:15:32] in common. We believe in the super How
[1:15:34] many believes in the supernatural?
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; We believe in in in miracles. How many
[1:15:38] believes in miracles? Amen. That's
[1:15:40] something that we just believe in. We We
[1:15:42] believe that there's one Lord. How many
[1:15:44] believes that? Amen. We believe in
[1:15:47] Malachi 4, don't we? Amen. We We believe
[1:15:50] that that the seventh angel has come and
[1:15:53] sounded in this age. How many believes
[1:15:56] that? Well, see, then that shows we've
[1:15:58] got something in common. Amen. I I may
[1:16:01] not be like you, Brother Tim, and you're
[1:16:03] a businessman, and you're a lot smarter
[1:16:05] than I am in that way, but I I may not
[1:16:07] be that. that I can't just say, "Well, I
[1:16:09] ain't going to fellowship with him
[1:16:10] because he knows more about money and
[1:16:11] business than I do." I find that we've
[1:16:14] got something in common. We believe the
[1:16:16] message of the hour. We believe the Lord
[1:16:18] is coming. We believe in Malachi 4.
[1:16:21] Amen. So why would I let the devil put a
[1:16:23] wedge between us and say we can't have
[1:16:25] the fellowship? Amen. Because of some
[1:16:28] carnal reasoning. Amen. Church, I'm
[1:16:31] telling you what, if we're gathered
[1:16:33] around the carcass, we can have
[1:16:35] fellowship.
[1:16:39] Do you believe that?
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brown said, "This is why we
[1:16:44] have gathered around is because we have
[1:16:46] things in common. That's why the eagles
[1:16:49] are gathered around the carcass. Is
[1:16:51] because they they're of the same diet.
[1:16:53] They they've got the they're they're
[1:16:55] enjoying. And this is Brother Bram said,
[1:16:57] "I'm so glad to have your kind of
[1:16:58] feathers so that we can have this
[1:17:01] fellowship." Amen. Amen. That's right.
[1:17:04] Amen. I'm I'm glad that I've got eagle
[1:17:06] feathers and not chicken feathers. Amen.
[1:17:08] I'm glad that I've got the same kind of
[1:17:10] feathers that the prophet had. Amen.
[1:17:12] That as he got excited around the word,
[1:17:14] I can get excited around the word. Amen.
[1:17:17] When he can receive the revelation, I
[1:17:19] can receive the revelation. Amen. When
[1:17:21] the eagle is screaming, I'm not around
[1:17:23] clucking. Amen. And not know
[1:17:25] understanding. Amen. What is going on?
[1:17:28] But I'm that eagle that was in that
[1:17:30] chicken yard. I hear the scream and
[1:17:33] something calls out for fellowship with
[1:17:36] it.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Whatever
[1:17:43] wherever the word is,
[1:17:46] the true nature of the bird will show
[1:17:48] itself.
[1:17:49] That's a direct quote
[1:17:52] from brother Brandham. Wherever the word
[1:17:54] is, the true nature of that bird of the
[1:17:56] bird will show itself. Now, someone
[1:17:59] asked Brother Bran, "What is the carcass
[1:18:01] and who are the eagles?" He said, "An
[1:18:03] eagle wants fresh meat. He must have his
[1:18:07] fresh meat. He's not a buzzard. He's an
[1:18:09] eagle. You can't give no denominational
[1:18:12] stuff to him. He's got to have the
[1:18:14] eagle's food. That's the freshest of the
[1:18:16] meat. Not what Moses done. Not what
[1:18:19] somebody else done, not what Sanki,
[1:18:22] Finny, Knox, Calvin, but right now.
[1:18:24] Right now, see the meat that's killed
[1:18:27] for this day, this age, right? That's
[1:18:30] the part of Christ that died to make
[1:18:33] this word be confirmed. That's what we
[1:18:35] they eat on, not what Noah done, what
[1:18:38] Moses done. They're examples. See, we
[1:18:41] see and read what they did, but it's
[1:18:43] what he promised to do. Now, see, and he
[1:18:46] promised it through them,
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Types and shadows. See? So, so he he was
[1:18:54] the word back there. That was the
[1:18:56] carcass for that day. The day of Wesley
[1:18:58] was a carcass for that day. The day of
[1:19:00] Luther was a carcass for that day. But
[1:19:02] they don't go back to that. Not eagle.
[1:19:04] See, that's already contaminated. What
[1:19:07] was left over must be burned of the
[1:19:10] communion. Even don't leave it for the
[1:19:12] next generation. Ain't that right? Amen.
[1:19:16] See, the Bible says that when you're
[1:19:18] taking communion, what's left over of
[1:19:20] it, don't even let it lay till morning.
[1:19:23] Burn it. That's what we do with the
[1:19:24] bread. Amen. Communion bread. We burn
[1:19:27] it. Amen. After whatever is left over
[1:19:29] after communion, we burn it. Amen. It's
[1:19:31] not to be left over. See? Amen. See? So,
[1:19:34] refer back to that. See? No sir. I ain't
[1:19:37] doing that. See what we got fresh food
[1:19:40] today. Amen. That's the word that's
[1:19:43] promised to this hour be made manifest
[1:19:46] in this hour. Can you say amen? The word
[1:19:49] that's promised to this hour be made
[1:19:51] manifest in this hour. So, Brother
[1:19:54] Brandham in a prayer uh said this. He
[1:19:57] says, you know, the only way that we
[1:19:59] know to correctly fellowship with thee
[1:20:02] talking to the Lord is around thy word.
[1:20:06] to correctly fellowship with the Lord is
[1:20:10] to fellowship around his word.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Not there's a lot of people singing and
[1:20:17] shouting and raising their hands and
[1:20:20] having Christian concerts and all of
[1:20:23] these things and oh time of worship. But
[1:20:26] to correctly
[1:20:29] have fellowship with the Lord
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; is to be gathered and fellowship around
[1:20:34] his word.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; See, thy word is the truth. We gather
[1:20:40] here for spiritual strength.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; We need it, Lord. We must have strength
[1:20:47] to endure the crosses that we bear.
[1:20:52] How many believes that
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; there's something nourishing in this
[1:20:56] message?
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you feel it, but I sure
[1:21:02] do.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Going through the trials that you go
[1:21:06] through, there's something nourishing.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:21:13] you know, for years now, the churches or
[1:21:16] they've been talking about, you know,
[1:21:17] joining the churches, uniting the the
[1:21:20] churches together and and these things.
[1:21:22] The prophet said they're going to do it.
[1:21:23] They're doing it, you know, and he says,
[1:21:27] but they couldn't do it until the
[1:21:28] falling away, until the church begin to
[1:21:31] get away from the spiritual feast draw
[1:21:34] itself back and organize itself. And
[1:21:38] then the revelation didn't stay with the
[1:21:41] church. See, when when they had a good
[1:21:44] revelation, Luther had a revelation,
[1:21:46] Wesley had a revelation, Pentecost had a
[1:21:48] revelation. Amen. And and the revelation
[1:21:51] was there. Amen. And and and yet they
[1:21:54] they got away. They fell away. And the
[1:21:56] revelation did not stay with the church.
[1:22:00] So we got Methodists today that don't
[1:22:02] have the same revelation that them
[1:22:04] Methodist had in in Wesley's day.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, they they didn't have these
[1:22:12] things. Amen. See, and so we we find
[1:22:15] that Jesus already predicted that the
[1:22:17] people of this age would not come to the
[1:22:20] feast of the Lord. Too many excuses.
[1:22:23] Prophet says they have the excuse that
[1:22:25] their church don't believe in it. Right?
[1:22:27] It'd come to the message, but the church
[1:22:29] don't believe in it. They'd preach the
[1:22:31] message, but they would get kicked out,
[1:22:32] and then they'd be where are they going
[1:22:34] to preach at? And and and all of these
[1:22:36] things. He says, "If God would speak to
[1:22:38] a man's heart and say, I want you to go
[1:22:40] and preach the full gospel." Well, my
[1:22:42] church doesn't stand for it, Lord. You
[1:22:44] have to excuse me if you will. See, I've
[1:22:46] got a fine charge. You know, I'm pastor
[1:22:49] uh one of the greatest churches in the
[1:22:51] city, Lord. Oh, we praise your name down
[1:22:54] there. We sure do. I just can't do it.
[1:22:57] Excuses. He says they go out on Sunday
[1:23:00] afternoon and play golf instead of
[1:23:02] having a church. Close it up on Sunday
[1:23:04] nights cuz it's too hot to come. See,
[1:23:06] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:23:08] God, truce breakers and false accusers,
[1:23:11] incontinent, and despisers of those that
[1:23:13] are good. Oh, you say he's talking about
[1:23:16] infidels. No, he wasn't having a form of
[1:23:18] godliness fundamentally as fundamental
[1:23:21] as the other one was. Another place we
[1:23:23] we we stay home to watch this or to do
[1:23:26] that and or to take a little ride. It's
[1:23:28] too hot to go to church or something
[1:23:30] like that. I just don't feel good. Well,
[1:23:33] you're going to feel worse than that
[1:23:35] some of these days when you're condemned
[1:23:37] at the judgment bar. Amen. Another
[1:23:39] place, see they don't come to the
[1:23:41] spiritual feast of his promised
[1:23:44] vindicated word. They refuse. Too many
[1:23:46] excuses. See? Amen. But so they don't
[1:23:49] come to the spiritual feast of his
[1:23:51] promised word. Vindicated word. Some
[1:23:54] kind of excuse. Too hot. I'm too tired.
[1:23:56] I will tomorrow. Some kind of an excuse.
[1:23:59] That's all they do. See, by rejecting
[1:24:02] the day of visitation, it separates them
[1:24:05] from God.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; It separates them from God because you
[1:24:12] can't fellowship with God without
[1:24:14] correctly fellowshipping or you can't
[1:24:16] correctly fellowship with God unless
[1:24:18] you're fellowshipping around the word of
[1:24:20] God.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Well, do you love him?
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord.
[1:24:28] Now, we have heard the cry, "Come out of
[1:24:31] her, my people." That's been a cry. And
[1:24:34] and if you've heard that, you're blessed
[1:24:36] to hear it.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; At your invitation to come to the feast.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Come come out of her, my people.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; You see, if if God's calling us out,
[1:24:49] then he wouldn't just
[1:24:51] have nothing for us not to go to. there
[1:24:55] wouldn't be anything for us to, you
[1:24:56] know, he wouldn't leave us just
[1:24:58] wandering. In other words, scattered.
[1:24:59] We've come out and we don't know what to
[1:25:01] do. Well, I'll go do this then. I'm
[1:25:03] going to go do this and I'm going to go
[1:25:04] do that and and and scattered all over
[1:25:07] the place. See? Well, God wouldn't do
[1:25:09] that. He'd have something for us to
[1:25:11] gather around. Ain't that right? you
[1:25:14] know, uh uh not to take much longer, but
[1:25:16] you know, we're we're it's it's a time
[1:25:19] of year season that that we'll start
[1:25:21] seeing the geese fly over and coming
[1:25:24] together and you'll start seeing them
[1:25:26] and occasionally you can see a bunch of
[1:25:27] them gathered around. You know, I've
[1:25:30] read to you a few Sundays back of how
[1:25:33] that, you know, brother Bram said he was
[1:25:34] him and uh that Indian man on the uh
[1:25:38] Bert that he had led to the Lord was on
[1:25:40] the lake and and ducks were just all
[1:25:43] over that water. He said it was the
[1:25:44] biggest number of ducks he had ever seen
[1:25:46] at one time. And they were just the
[1:25:49] quacking and the quacking was so loud
[1:25:51] and deafening and and and uh Bert, you
[1:25:55] know, said, "Hey, Billy says, you know,
[1:25:57] what what do you think? what what do you
[1:25:59] think's going on? And Brother Brandon
[1:26:00] said, "Well, a snowstorm is coming. The
[1:26:03] a snowstorm is coming." And and and so
[1:26:06] they're gathered, amen, they they've all
[1:26:09] come together, amen, to escape uh uh the
[1:26:12] the winter and the the the cold. And he
[1:26:15] says, "Well, what do you think they're
[1:26:16] doing with all that quacking so loud?"
[1:26:18] He says, "They're having good fellowship
[1:26:20] before they leave. They're gathered
[1:26:22] around for fellowship, right?" Amen.
[1:26:25] See? And so we we find, Amen, that you
[1:26:29] know, it's kind of like the same thing
[1:26:30] as as in Egypt on the first Passover
[1:26:34] when God was fixing to uh deliver. It
[1:26:37] was time of deliverance for Israel to
[1:26:40] leave Egypt. And Israel was scattered
[1:26:43] all over the nation of Egypt uh as
[1:26:46] slaves doing different things. and but
[1:26:49] but there came a gathering and God began
[1:26:53] to call and and gather them into one
[1:26:57] place and and and their gathering was in
[1:27:00] Gan. Amen. and and uh uh we we find that
[1:27:06] just before they left that God was going
[1:27:09] to send the death angel uh uh the
[1:27:12] destroying angel uh and and and uh they
[1:27:17] were to be delivered. But before he'd
[1:27:19] done that, he told Moses, "You tell the
[1:27:21] people to slay a lamb." Amen. And put
[1:27:24] the blood of that lamb on the door. And
[1:27:28] then that household or so many whatever
[1:27:31] the household would go under in under
[1:27:34] that blood into that house and they were
[1:27:37] together around that lamb and eat the
[1:27:40] lamb. Amen. And and the brother Brandham
[1:27:43] said they were to fellowship around the
[1:27:46] lamb. They were eating the lamb. The the
[1:27:49] lamb that had died in theirstead. The
[1:27:52] lamb that shed its blood in theirstead.
[1:27:55] That they don't have to die. They're
[1:27:57] under the blood. The blood is out there
[1:27:59] on the door as a sign that they've got a
[1:28:02] substitute. They didn't have to worry.
[1:28:04] They didn't have to fear. They didn't
[1:28:06] have to do Amen. Now, now there was fear
[1:28:08] strike in the land. Trust me. But not in
[1:28:11] the home where the lamb was. Not in the
[1:28:15] home where the token was. Not in the
[1:28:18] home where there was fellowship around
[1:28:20] the lamb. Amen. There must have been a
[1:28:23] house of hold of peace. There must have
[1:28:26] been a joy. There must have been songs
[1:28:29] being sung. I'm leaving this old place.
[1:28:32] Uh, we're going out of here. We're safe.
[1:28:35] Can you say amen? They were
[1:28:37] fellowshipping around the thing that had
[1:28:39] died for them.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. and they were in under the blood
[1:28:48] having communion
[1:28:50] and they weren't fellowshipping around
[1:28:52] worldly things but around the lamb and
[1:28:55] brother Brandham said that's the way it
[1:28:56] is in our heart when we apply the blood
[1:28:58] of the Lord Jesus taking away all sin
[1:29:01] then we can have fellowship eating the
[1:29:03] word of God around the table of God
[1:29:06] fellowshipping upon the godly things you
[1:29:09] preach divine healing and every one of
[1:29:11] them cries out amen why you're you're
[1:29:14] feasting off the lamb him. Can you say
[1:29:17] amen? Amen. See, uh uh that's right.
[1:29:21] Preach that we should lay aside all sin
[1:29:23] and malice and strife and things. And
[1:29:26] every believer says, "Amen."
[1:29:28] Fellowshipping around the word. Amen.
[1:29:31] That's what you like. You like to preach
[1:29:33] around to people that are fellowshipping
[1:29:35] around the word. They ain't
[1:29:36] fellowshipping around their troubles.
[1:29:38] They're not fellowshipping around the
[1:29:40] things of the of the world and the the
[1:29:42] dead carry on of unbelief. Amen. But
[1:29:45] they're fellowshipping around the word.
[1:29:48] And they know, amen, that a rapture's
[1:29:50] coming. They know that deliverance is
[1:29:53] coming. Talk about the end. And they're
[1:29:56] rejoicing because they're fellowshipping
[1:29:59] around the word.
[1:30:02] Hallelujah.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; We have too many people criticizing this
[1:30:07] message when they should be saying amen
[1:30:10] to it.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; It shows that they're not in fellowship
[1:30:13] around the lamb.
[1:30:16] Amen. The nature is showing up. Amen. It
[1:30:20] ain't an eagle nature because the lamb
[1:30:23] is the word.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Now notice now the prophet said the word
[1:30:27] become blood.
[1:30:29] I just want you to understand what
[1:30:31] you're fellowshipping around.
[1:30:33] The word became blood.
[1:30:36] That lamb was a bloody lamb.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; The word bled for you. How many believes
[1:30:41] that?
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; The every promise that God made to you
[1:30:45] has got blood on it.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:52] G
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; said, "See, the word bled for you, and
[1:30:56] you are washed in bleeding word,
[1:30:59] the word bleeding, the life of God in
[1:31:02] the word, and the word was bled for you
[1:31:05] that you might be washed from the filth
[1:31:07] of these prostitutes."
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; What was he talking about? false
[1:31:12] doctrines, false ideas, false
[1:31:15] conceptions of man, false teachings of
[1:31:17] man, maybe even from your own false
[1:31:20] teachings that you've conjured up that I
[1:31:22] may conjured up in my own mind. Do you
[1:31:24] understand what I'm saying? Amen. We we
[1:31:27] we've been washed from all of that.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; We're we're eating the pure
[1:31:32] unadulterated word. Amen.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; See, the word bled for you that you
[1:31:38] might be washed from the filth of these
[1:31:40] prostitutes and be cleaned and
[1:31:42] sanctified by the washing of the water
[1:31:44] of word, the word. And makes your mind
[1:31:47] and heart stayed on God and on his word.
[1:31:52] Oh, do you love him?
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; No man, now no man can have fellowship
[1:31:57] with God outside the blood.
[1:32:01] You see, it's the blood that hides us
[1:32:03] from the wrath of God.
[1:32:05] You believe it?
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; The blood. Where's the blood? Where the
[1:32:09] carcass is.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; That's where it's at.
[1:32:16] See, the blood is what keeps God from
[1:32:19] destroying you.
[1:32:22] Keeps him from destroying me.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; He's not seeking to kill me.
[1:32:28] He's not seeking to kill you.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; There is a blood.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; You're not gathering around the figs of
[1:32:37] man.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; You're gathered around God's provided
[1:32:41] blood.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; As I said before, his holiness demanded
[1:32:48] judgment, but love demanded fellowship.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; So, he produced a lamb, the son of God.
[1:32:54] The lamb died in ourstead, took our
[1:32:56] judgment. so that we wouldn't have to
[1:32:58] die. And his shed blood has brought us
[1:33:02] back into fellowship with him.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Now notice he said, "Now, did you get
[1:33:08] that?" He said, "Then how?" See it?
[1:33:10] Through the blood, washing of the blood,
[1:33:12] taken away, separating of sin that the
[1:33:15] Holy Spirit woos the believer through
[1:33:17] the blood, cleansing of the soul into
[1:33:20] the fellowship into this spirit life
[1:33:23] inside with Christ. Shut out the world.
[1:33:26] uh uh and very nature of God is in you.
[1:33:29] Still subject to mistakes.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Still subject to mistakes.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; And your brother still subject to
[1:33:40] mistakes.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; Your sister is still subject to
[1:33:45] mistakes.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Your wife and husband may be still is
[1:33:50] still subject to mistakes.
[1:33:53] Mom and dad, children, preacher.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Still subject to mistakes, but God can't
[1:34:05] see it.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Are you fellowshipping
[1:34:11] around the lamb?
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; God can't see it.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:19] See, he said, "See, God can't see it
[1:34:23] because it's covered by the blood.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; God can't see through the blood. Every
[1:34:29] time he looks through the blood, it
[1:34:30] looks white."
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Is that the way you want God to look at
[1:34:33] you?
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Bloody bleeding word.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; He looks through the blood, it looks
[1:34:40] white. So if if God so pleased was so
[1:34:44] pleased with Christ till he accepted him
[1:34:47] and said this is my beloved son in whom
[1:34:49] I'm well pleased and through Christ
[1:34:52] being the perfect one us dead to our own
[1:34:54] thoughts and ideas being born of the
[1:34:56] spirit of God walking not after theology
[1:34:59] but after the spirit inside of us then
[1:35:02] let the dead in Christ walk not after
[1:35:05] the things of the world but after the
[1:35:06] things of the spirit. Romans 8:1 said,
[1:35:09] "There is now therefore no condemnation
[1:35:11] to them that are in Christ Jesus that
[1:35:13] walk not after the flesh, fighting and
[1:35:15] waring and strife and envy and selfish
[1:35:18] things." See, don't walk after that.
[1:35:20] That's of the flesh. But after the
[1:35:22] spirit. See, you're inside of Christ
[1:35:25] walking. Then all the things of the
[1:35:27] world pass away. All the great creeds
[1:35:30] that you had of this thing or that thing
[1:35:33] is all vanished away. and your mind and
[1:35:35] heart becomes singular on Christ Jesus.
[1:35:38] That shows you have died to yourself and
[1:35:40] born again. Then just as sure as church
[1:35:43] time comes, you just can't keep come
[1:35:46] from keep from coming to church. If you
[1:35:49] just going to you're just going to go if
[1:35:52] you have to hobble. That's all you're
[1:35:54] going to church because the spirit
[1:35:56] itself bears record of gathering
[1:35:58] together in Christ Jesus. Can you say
[1:36:01] amen?
[1:36:03] Now I'm I'm I'm going to clothe, but I
[1:36:05] want to read this.
[1:36:07] What is it then that we've been gathered
[1:36:10] to?
[1:36:12] Just our idea. Is it our figment of our
[1:36:15] imagination that we're gathered around
[1:36:17] the right thing?
[1:36:19] Oh goodness. Brother Brandon says,
[1:36:21] "Never forget at Joon Johannesburg,
[1:36:23] South Africa. I just arrived about 30
[1:36:26] minutes before a plane and I had been
[1:36:28] been three days and nights in the air.
[1:36:30] So tired I could hardly stand it. They
[1:36:33] take me out to the fairgrounds where
[1:36:35] some 60 or 50 or 60,000 people were
[1:36:38] gathered. And no sooner than got on the
[1:36:40] platform till the Holy Spirit I seen
[1:36:43] coming across the place a bus and it had
[1:36:46] a sign on it Durban. I saw a young man
[1:36:49] had to fuss and slip away from his
[1:36:51] mother and father with one leg six or
[1:36:54] eight inches shorter than the other.
[1:36:57] He was wearing a white shirt with
[1:37:00] suspenders holding up his trousers. And
[1:37:02] I noticed the young man and I looked
[1:37:04] back again and the vision was gone. And
[1:37:07] then just in a moment I saw that light
[1:37:09] hanging over a young man way back in the
[1:37:11] audience. Now this is 50 60,000 people.
[1:37:15] And the man's in the very back, but he
[1:37:16] sees the light over there. Amen. And I
[1:37:19] looked and I thought I'd seen him
[1:37:20] somewhere. And I watched him and that
[1:37:22] light kept holding him. Uh it kept
[1:37:25] holding over him a few minutes and I was
[1:37:27] waiting for the interpreter to catch the
[1:37:29] next words. Then I seen that same young
[1:37:31] man stand up and throw down his crutches
[1:37:34] and his six inch inches short leg came
[1:37:38] down to normal with the rest. And I said
[1:37:40] to Mr. AJ Schuman who is in glory
[1:37:44] tonight. I said, "Mr. Schuman, just
[1:37:46] quote my words. It's a vision." And he
[1:37:48] said, "Very well." And I said, "The
[1:37:50] young man sitting back there with a
[1:37:52] white shirt on and suspenders. He come
[1:37:54] from a city called Durban, some 1500
[1:37:57] miles across the country in a bus, and
[1:37:59] he had to slip away from his father and
[1:38:01] mother to come. But he's believed on the
[1:38:03] Lord Jesus, and he's got one leg 6 in
[1:38:06] shorter than the other." And the young
[1:38:08] man jumped up and there he was standing
[1:38:10] trying to feel for his crutches. And I
[1:38:12] said, "Young man, the Lord Jesus has
[1:38:14] healed you." And immediately his leg
[1:38:17] come out 6 in to the normal with the
[1:38:19] rest of him. And they brought the young
[1:38:21] man to the platform and doctors examined
[1:38:24] him there. You can see his picture in my
[1:38:26] book. And I've been standing there just
[1:38:28] a few moments and I seen a little green
[1:38:31] car running down the road and it slipped
[1:38:33] and it turned around backward and struck
[1:38:35] a tree and a young blondheaded girl had
[1:38:38] a broken back and I said, "I see a
[1:38:41] little green car that slid into a tree
[1:38:43] and a young blondheaded girl of about 18
[1:38:46] years old has a broken back. She's in
[1:38:49] serious condition." No one responded and
[1:38:52] I couldn't see her anywhere in that vast
[1:38:54] big audience of people. And I stood
[1:38:56] there just for a few minutes and I said,
[1:38:59] "Understand it. Don't be suspicious.
[1:39:02] It's the Lord Jesus." In the power of
[1:39:06] his resurrection, he sent the Holy Ghost
[1:39:09] to continue his work. And there I seen
[1:39:11] the vision happen over again. And I
[1:39:13] couldn't see the young woman. Just then,
[1:39:15] standing right in in front of me here
[1:39:18] stood that light as you see on the
[1:39:20] picture. And it stood there. And I
[1:39:22] walked up there and and there she laid
[1:39:24] down below the platform. Oh God, rich in
[1:39:26] mercy. And I said, "Young lady, the Lord
[1:39:29] Jesus has made you well." And she
[1:39:31] started to cry. And her mother said, "Oh
[1:39:34] no, don't tell her to get up. Says if
[1:39:36] she moves, she'll die." And the young
[1:39:39] lady jumped to her feet, screaming and
[1:39:41] praising God. And the mother fainted and
[1:39:43] fell in the cot that the girl was laying
[1:39:45] in. "What is it?" he's asking. Just
[1:39:49] about that time, some critical man
[1:39:51] raised up back there and stood with one
[1:39:53] foot on one seat and one on the other
[1:39:56] and said, "You American, I challenge you
[1:39:58] to tell me what name you do this in and
[1:40:01] what denominational church do you belong
[1:40:03] to?" See, it's just the same. They don't
[1:40:05] understand. They're not looking for
[1:40:06] these things, right? They're not looking
[1:40:09] for these things. They're satisfied with
[1:40:11] old carry on. See, the churches are not
[1:40:14] looking for the coming of the Lord. And
[1:40:16] the Holy Spirit is here to confirm his
[1:40:19] coming to bring it to pass so much. Each
[1:40:23] one wants to take his own way. That's
[1:40:25] the way it is. It was there. Each group
[1:40:27] had their own idea. But that's not the
[1:40:29] question tonight. That's not what I'm
[1:40:31] talking about. The question I'm asking
[1:40:33] you is, what do you think it is? It
[1:40:38] concerns you.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Who is this that's
[1:40:44] going up and down the nations? Not man.
[1:40:46] Man man cannot do those things. Who is
[1:40:49] it that's speaking and saying to the
[1:40:51] people in the audience that's sitting
[1:40:53] right here and over here in different
[1:40:55] places in the meeting when women and men
[1:40:58] are brought in here dying. Who is it?
[1:41:01] That young woman that walked into the
[1:41:03] baptistry this morning that three weeks
[1:41:05] ago dying with sarcomus cancer uh uh
[1:41:09] lives right here on Maple Street. Mr. or
[1:41:12] Miss
[1:41:14] Batty Batty I guess and and and I asked
[1:41:17] three doctors that was with her. She
[1:41:19] didn't have one chance to live. Think of
[1:41:23] that church didn't have a chance to live
[1:41:26] with four or five little children and my
[1:41:29] mother trying to take care of them. Mama
[1:41:31] said, "Bill, she'll never come home
[1:41:33] again." And I went out to where she was
[1:41:35] and the Lord Jesus spoke. Thus said the
[1:41:38] Lord, if she will go to the church and
[1:41:40] promise to be baptized in the name into
[1:41:43] the name of the Lord Jesus and will
[1:41:45] serve God, she'll go home well. And I
[1:41:47] asked her, "Will you do this, lady?" And
[1:41:50] she said, "All that you say, I'll do
[1:41:52] it." And immediately the pains left. And
[1:41:54] three days later, she was home. And the
[1:41:57] doctor can't find one trace of that
[1:41:59] cancer. Who is this that cometh in the
[1:42:02] name of the Lord? Who is it? It's the
[1:42:04] Holy Spirit of God. What's your opinion
[1:42:06] of it? What's your opinion knowing your
[1:42:09] pastor? He says, see, and with sitting
[1:42:12] in these seats here, people out from out
[1:42:14] of town sitting with epilepsy and
[1:42:16] setting with here sets a man somewhere
[1:42:18] in here, a Menite brother right here, a
[1:42:20] surf sufferer of epilepsy. Never knew
[1:42:23] him. Seen him, nothing about him. See,
[1:42:27] and all of a sudden about two years ago,
[1:42:29] I guess two years, the Holy Spirit
[1:42:31] called it and said, "Thus sayith the
[1:42:33] Lord." And he's never had a spell since.
[1:42:35] Who is it? Who is it? See, this woman
[1:42:39] was sitting here last Sunday, the last
[1:42:41] time I was here, and come down from
[1:42:43] somewhere in Illinois the next day with
[1:42:45] a great tumor in her body that was
[1:42:47] malignant. And some of the best medical
[1:42:50] science of Illinois was taking her to
[1:42:52] the great clinic to be operated on
[1:42:54] Monday. and she squeezed her way in. And
[1:42:57] I've never seen her, heard of her in all
[1:42:59] my life. And all of a sudden, the Holy
[1:43:01] Spirit shouted her. And he told her who
[1:43:03] she was, where she'd come from, and and
[1:43:06] she was going to be operated the next
[1:43:08] day. And he says, "How many was here to
[1:43:10] see it?" Uh, see that? He said, "Seen
[1:43:13] the news flow back." The next day, she
[1:43:16] went to the doctor. They taken her from
[1:43:18] clinic to clinic. Can't find a trace of
[1:43:20] it. Who is this? Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:43:24] Who is this that's doing this? Could you
[1:43:27] dare to say it was your pastor? Never.
[1:43:30] Could you dare to say man had anything
[1:43:32] to do into it? Never. It's the Holy
[1:43:35] Spirit. The spirit that was on our Lord
[1:43:37] Jesus and is coming to unite himself
[1:43:40] with his church is so close that he's
[1:43:42] spreading forth his great holy light to
[1:43:45] redeem and to bring into fellowship a
[1:43:47] church of the living God for the rapture
[1:43:50] that's near at hand. Who is it? I can't
[1:43:54] answer your question. I can't answer for
[1:43:57] you, but I can answer for myself. And
[1:44:00] over this sacred desk tonight in the
[1:44:03] ears of this the company and the
[1:44:06] purchase of the blood of our Lord Jesus,
[1:44:09] I say this from the bottom of my heart.
[1:44:11] Not because that I'm one of you, not
[1:44:13] because that I'm just somebody
[1:44:15] different, but one of the redeemed
[1:44:17] that's washed by the blood. I believe
[1:44:19] that that same light that hangs in this
[1:44:22] church tonight, that same one shows by
[1:44:25] its nature that it's Jesus Christ in the
[1:44:29] form of the Holy Ghost.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; That's what we've been gathered to.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; And as we're eating it, we believe it. I
[1:44:41] believe the same miracles can happen
[1:44:43] tonight.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; I just believe it. There ain't nothing
[1:44:47] that's going to whip this bride.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Tim, I believe it.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; That cancer can disappear.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; From Sister Martha. He can do it. He did
[1:44:58] it here.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; That's the word we're feeding off of.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that, church?
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; We've seen it. We've seen the blind eyes
[1:45:07] open.
[1:45:09] I've seen the crippled walk. I've seen
[1:45:12] legs straighten out and grow to its
[1:45:15] normal length. I've seen it.
[1:45:19] We're feasting off the word.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; I just believe it.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; If the musicians will come,
[1:45:28] this concerns you, church.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; It's the same thing that's going to
[1:45:33] bring a rapture and changing of our
[1:45:35] bodies.
[1:45:41] It's the thing that's giving us strength
[1:45:43] to fly away from the things of the world
[1:45:47] and to escape the oncoming judgment.
[1:45:51] I thought of this.
[1:45:54] Brother Brandaman speaking of the cloud
[1:45:56] that appeared over Tucson said they took
[1:45:58] the picture. They still don't know what
[1:46:01] about it. here. Some time ago, everybody
[1:46:04] was saying, "Lookie here. This looks
[1:46:05] like this and them angel's wings and how
[1:46:08] they're folded in there." One day,
[1:46:10] turning it to the right, looking there
[1:46:12] was Jesus Christ, just as perfect as
[1:46:15] Hoffman ever drove him. It was standing
[1:46:18] there with the white wig on, looking
[1:46:20] back down towards the earth, showing
[1:46:23] that he is supreme authority. That's
[1:46:26] what we've been gathered around.
[1:46:30] The heavens declare it. The Bible
[1:46:31] declares it. The message declares it all
[1:46:34] the same. Supreme Authority with the
[1:46:36] white wig on. You see his black beard
[1:46:38] under. Many of you have seen the
[1:46:41] picture. We got it back there. Just turn
[1:46:43] it to the right sideways. Look at it.
[1:46:46] There he is. Just as perfect as it was
[1:46:49] if it had been photographed of him.
[1:46:53] They're looking at it from the wrong
[1:46:54] angle. You got to look at it in the
[1:46:56] right angle. They don't know what we're
[1:46:59] gathered around, but we've looked at it
[1:47:01] from the right angle, and we know. We
[1:47:03] know what we're gathered around. It's
[1:47:06] proven by our nature that we're eagles.
[1:47:09] We're eating on the fresh carcass, the
[1:47:11] fresh mana, the promised word that God
[1:47:14] promised in this age. I see no mistakes.
[1:47:18] I see nothing less than Jesus Christ
[1:47:21] made manifest. Hallelujah.
[1:47:24] God made manifest 2,000 years ago in a
[1:47:28] body that was created in the womb of
[1:47:30] Mary. But in this day, God made manifest
[1:47:33] in a body that was redeemed by his own
[1:47:36] blood.
[1:47:38] Hallelujah. And I see a people, Amen.
[1:47:41] redeemed by that same blood, God in you.
[1:47:46] Hallelujah. Do you love him?
[1:47:49] Bless the name of the Lord. Bless the
[1:47:51] name
[1:47:53] He said, "See, the first time I ever
[1:47:55] seen him, he looked like the head of
[1:47:58] Hoffman." He said, "I'd never seen that
[1:48:00] before." And in Billy's Sunday's
[1:48:02] tabernacle years later, I saw it. My
[1:48:04] house has never been without one of the
[1:48:06] the picture sins. Then here in the
[1:48:09] skies, and you remember what brother
[1:48:10] Brandham talked about. I I I wish I
[1:48:13] could remember the sermon looking unto
[1:48:16] Jesus, maybe. Can't remember. You can
[1:48:20] look it up, but where he talked about
[1:48:21] how he was in the field crying,
[1:48:25] weeping
[1:48:27] at night.
[1:48:30] He said, "And there stood before him was
[1:48:32] the Lord Jesus."
[1:48:35] Had his back to him. He said,
[1:48:38] he said he really don't know what it
[1:48:40] was.
[1:48:42] He said, but all he knows is the wind
[1:48:43] started blowing and his hair and his
[1:48:45] garments were flowing with the wind.
[1:48:49] [Music]
[1:48:50] And he looked he said, "Jesus
[1:48:54] and he turned and looked at him and he
[1:48:56] says the the the the
[1:48:58] scene, the face, you can't even describe
[1:49:02] it with words. No artist could ever ever
[1:49:04] ever catch all the features."
[1:49:09] Then he saw the Hoffman's head of Christ
[1:49:11] and he said, "That's the that's the
[1:49:13] closest
[1:49:15] that that he looked. It's not exactly,
[1:49:18] but it is the closest.
[1:49:21] But now he says here, see, 33 years
[1:49:24] later from seeing him out in that field,
[1:49:26] declare it that it's the truth. That's
[1:49:28] the way he looks, not some mystic
[1:49:32] something of somebody's idea. Can you
[1:49:34] say amen?
[1:49:36] He said, "See,"
[1:49:38] he said, "like in the Vatican, they got
[1:49:40] a Christ draw over there with a little
[1:49:43] white ring of beard and a ring of beard
[1:49:46] around his chin about a half inch long,
[1:49:48] runs right around the top of his mouth
[1:49:50] and like this." And they call that the
[1:49:52] Christ. That's puts me in mind of a
[1:49:54] Greek artist. I seen one time in an
[1:49:57] ancient cathedral showing what Adam and
[1:49:59] Eve look like. They look like beast or
[1:50:01] something. That's what the carnal mind
[1:50:03] can perceive of some spiritual thing. He
[1:50:06] said, "I think Adam was the most
[1:50:07] handsome man that ever lived and Eve was
[1:50:09] a perfect woman in every way." He said,
[1:50:11] "But now the carnal mind wraps up the
[1:50:14] thing in their own ideas and then God
[1:50:17] sends down and unfolds the thing by his
[1:50:19] power." Aren't you glad for that? Aren't
[1:50:23] you glad you're you're around the
[1:50:24] carcass, the fresh kill of the word?
[1:50:29] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:50:34] Oh little legal
[1:50:36] [Music]
[1:50:38] and fly.
[1:50:41] Glory to God. You weren't born.
[1:50:48] [Music]
[1:50:54] You were born for the sky.
[1:50:57] Don't let the trial
[1:51:00] get you down
[1:51:03] [Music]
[1:51:04] and drive your spirit
[1:51:07] in the ground
[1:51:10] mount up with wings.
[1:51:15] [Music]
[1:51:17] Hallelujah.
[1:51:20] Oh, sing it again.
[1:51:22] Go. Spread your wings,
[1:51:28] little eagle,
[1:51:31] and fly.
[1:51:34] [Music]
[1:51:37] You weren't born
[1:51:40] for the valley.
[1:51:43] Oh, but you were born
[1:51:47] for the sky.
[1:51:50] Don't let your trial
[1:51:54] bring you down
[1:51:57] and drive your spirit to
[1:52:01] the ground.
[1:52:03] Mount up with wings,
[1:52:08] little eagle.
[1:52:10] Well, how many eagles do we have here
[1:52:12] tonight? Can you say it again? Oh,
[1:52:16] spread your wings,
[1:52:19] [Music]
[1:52:21] little eagle.
[1:52:23] You got wings.
[1:52:26] You got the promises. Just spread them
[1:52:28] and fly.
[1:52:30] You weren't born
[1:52:33] for the valley.
[1:52:36] Oh, but you were born
[1:52:39] to fly in the sky.
[1:52:43] Don't let your trial
[1:52:46] bring you down
[1:52:49] [Music]
[1:52:50] or drive your spirit
[1:52:53] to the ground.
[1:52:56] Mount up with wings,
[1:53:01] little eagle.
[1:53:04] Sing it one more time, shall we?
[1:53:07] Hallelujah.
[1:53:08] So spread your wings,
[1:53:14] little eagles.
[1:53:16] [Music]
[1:53:18] Oh, keep feeding, feeding, getting
[1:53:21] strength,
[1:53:23] cuz you weren't born
[1:53:26] for the valley.
[1:53:29] But you were born.
[1:53:32] You got to fight your way through them
[1:53:34] atmospheres.
[1:53:36] Oh, don't let the trials
[1:53:39] get you down
[1:53:42] and drive your spirit
[1:53:45] to the ground.
[1:53:48] Ry mount up with wings,
[1:53:53] little eagle,
[1:53:56] and fly. Don't let the trial,
[1:54:00] Don't let the trial
[1:54:05] bring you down and drive your spirit
[1:54:11] to the ground.
[1:54:14] Mount up with wings.
[1:54:19] Little eagle
[1:54:22] and fly.
[1:54:25] Oh, can you lift your hands?
[1:54:28] Can you worship him?
[1:54:31] I know I have you do that a lot, but the
[1:54:33] prophet said, "You water after the word
[1:54:36] has gone forth, you water
[1:54:39] it with your praises."
[1:54:43] Oh, Father, we're so thankful we have a
[1:54:46] gathering place.
[1:54:49] We're so thankful, Lord, that you made
[1:54:53] us to fly
[1:54:56] that we could be gathered around the
[1:54:58] carcass of this day.
[1:55:02] We're not crazy. The world thinks we're
[1:55:05] crazy. The makeeliever thinks we're
[1:55:07] insane.
[1:55:09] That we're going overboard with things.
[1:55:11] But oh god, it's it's nature's of an
[1:55:14] eagle. We're feeding off every word,
[1:55:18] Lord.
[1:55:20] We see you manifested in your word.
[1:55:23] We're drawing strength from it. We're so
[1:55:26] thankful, Lord. We love you.
[1:55:30] Bless the people here, Father.
[1:55:33] You see their needs. You see the things
[1:55:35] they're going through. I I pray, Lord,
[1:55:37] that you'd help them.
[1:55:41] Oh God, we love you. We love you. Don't
[1:55:45] let the trial
[1:55:48] get you down
[1:55:51] or drive your spirit to the ground.
[1:55:57] Just mount up with wings.
[1:56:02] It'll eagle
[1:56:05] and fly.
[1:56:08] One more song. I'm going to rise.
[1:56:13] Rise,
[1:56:15] rise above it all. I'm going to rise,
[1:56:21] rise,
[1:56:24] rise above it all.
[1:56:27] I'm going to spread my wings, fly away
[1:56:36] one more time.
[1:56:39] I'm going to rise. Oh, I'm rising now.
[1:56:47] Oh, I am rising.
[1:56:50] I'm rising.
[1:56:52] Rising above it all. I've got my wings
[1:56:58] spread. I'm rising to heaven.
[1:57:03] [Music]
[1:57:04] Oh, sing it again. I am rising.
[1:57:11] Oh yes.
[1:57:15] Halleluah. Rising.
[1:57:18] [Music]
[1:57:21] Rise above it all.
[1:57:25] Spread my wings. Fly away.
[1:57:31] Rise above it all.
[1:57:35] I'm going to spread my wings, fly away
[1:57:40] to heaven,
[1:57:43] rise above it all
[1:57:47] as they play softly. God bless you.
[1:57:51] We love you.
[1:57:54] Remember service 11:00, Brother Daniel
[1:57:57] will be ministering, the Lord willing,
[1:58:00] and ask for your prayers as we would be
[1:58:04] traveling tonight
[1:58:06] and be ministering
[1:58:09] there in Pennsylvania and just praying
[1:58:12] God will
[1:58:14] anoint, be with us, be with the people.
[1:58:19] Oh my, it's such an urgent time, isn't
[1:58:21] it?
[1:58:22] I so want to proclaim this message to
[1:58:24] everyone I know.
[1:58:27] Hey, Satan fighting. He's trying to
[1:58:29] twist it all up, trying to discourage
[1:58:32] young people.
[1:58:35] One one man behind the pulpit, he asked
[1:58:39] the congregation says, "How many
[1:58:40] believes that the voice of God's on
[1:58:41] tape?" Amen. He goes, "You better be
[1:58:43] careful what you say."
[1:58:46] He said, "I said to my church the other
[1:58:48] day, and they all said, Amen. And I took
[1:58:49] a hammer and smashed the tape right
[1:58:52] before him. I said, "I just matched the
[1:58:54] voice of God. This is a man that claims
[1:58:56] to be in the mess of church."
[1:58:58] I thought, "Oh, God, them young people,
[1:59:00] what are they what are they going to
[1:59:02] think?
[1:59:04] This thing's sacred to me? These books
[1:59:07] are sacred. These tapes are sacred. Play
[1:59:10] the tapes in your home. Read them books.
[1:59:13] Feed, feed, feed. That's the only way
[1:59:15] you'll get strength. Get off the
[1:59:17] YouTube. Get off the television. get off
[1:59:19] whatever you're reading, whatever, and
[1:59:21] find time
[1:59:24] to listen to the message of the hour.
[1:59:26] Can you say amen? God bless you. Love
[1:59:29] you. Sure. Good to have brother John. Is
[1:59:31] your name Brother John? John. All right.
[1:59:35] And uh we certainly want to keep him in
[1:59:37] our prayers. He's going to school. And
[1:59:40] um also uh this coming Sunday will be
[1:59:43] the fifth Sunday. And so we're we're
[1:59:46] trying to uh on the fifth Sunday uh take
[1:59:50] up offerings for our meeting. And uh so
[1:59:55] just keep that in mind. Um that uh this
[2:00:00] this Sunday will be for the offering for
[2:00:03] our meeting. Amen. God bless you. Love
[2:00:06] you. Let's bow our heads. Brother Bill,
[2:00:10] do you want to dismiss us in prayer?
