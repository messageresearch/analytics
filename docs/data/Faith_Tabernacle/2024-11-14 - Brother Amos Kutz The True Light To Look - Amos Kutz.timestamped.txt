[39:13] hallelujah truly he is the light of the
[39:16] world is he
[39:18] not he is the only
[39:21] light he's the only light that we have
[39:25] thinking musicians
[39:28] that we have that gives us
[39:31] life I'm so thankful for
[39:34] that amen more and more as each day goes
[39:38] on my desire is to have more and more of
[39:41] him when you have more and more of him
[39:44] you get more light and if you want to
[39:46] see maturity in your life you've got to
[39:48] follow the season of the light there are
[39:52] certain seasons of the year you can't
[39:55] plant your your your garden in the
[39:59] middle of
[40:00] January you can't plant in October now
[40:04] there's certain things yes uh that are
[40:07] late bloomers like your turnips and
[40:10] certain things that are cold weather
[40:11] crops that can uh thrive in the cooler
[40:14] weather of fall but overall the ideal
[40:18] season is when that sun begins to rise
[40:22] and when it rises in its strength and it
[40:24] gets to that place where the sun is is
[40:28] almost uh as you would say it's almost
[40:31] 90° above you it's when that sun when
[40:35] the Shadows aren't real long in the
[40:37] middle of the day like it is right now
[40:40] you notice in the fall and the winter
[40:42] the Shadows are much much longer reason
[40:46] being said is the Earth has tilting it's
[40:49] tilting away from the Sun so that the
[40:52] light of the sun is shining on an angle
[40:55] and that shortens the growing season
[40:57] and it makes the air cooler in the polar
[41:00] regions especially where night becomes
[41:04] all the time you know most of the day
[41:07] and then you might have maybe an hour or
[41:09] two of where it just barely barely gets
[41:13] light but then it gets dark again and
[41:16] you're in that Perpetual Darkness I want
[41:18] to stay in the season of the Sun the
[41:21] full sunlight will
[41:24] produce the full benefit of the word in
[41:28] my life if we don't have the full
[41:31] benefit of the son then you're just
[41:33] going to get partial results amen so I I
[41:36] trust that that's what we our desire is
[41:39] tonight if you would turn with me in
[41:41] your
[41:43] Bibles and I want to take a text from
[41:46] the book of John's gospel chapter
[41:52] 1 I want to start reading at verse one
[42:03] in the beginning was the word and the
[42:05] Word was with God and the Word was God
[42:08] the same was in the beginning with God
[42:10] all things were made by him without him
[42:14] was not anything made that was
[42:18] made in him was
[42:21] life and the life was the light of
[42:26] men and the light shine in the
[42:29] darkness and the Darkness comprehended
[42:32] it not there was a man sent from God
[42:35] whose name was John the same came for a
[42:39] witness to Bear witness of the
[42:42] light that all men through him might
[42:47] believe he was not that light but was
[42:50] sent to Bear
[42:52] witness of that light that was the True
[42:56] Light which lith every man that cometh
[43:00] into the world let's read first John I
[43:03] believe it's 1 John 2
[43:08] and8 you notice uh in in Reading there
[43:12] in first in John chapter 1 he says
[43:16] that that was the True Light which lith
[43:20] every man the True Light now let's look
[43:23] at 1 John 2 and8 and again we find that
[43:26] same phrase is mentioned again here and
[43:30] he says again in new commandment I write
[43:33] unto you which s is true in him and in
[43:36] you because the darkness has
[43:39] passed and the True Light now
[43:43] shineth let's pray Heavenly Father Lord
[43:48] this is your your blessed
[43:50] word and we know father God in this word
[43:54] that it it tells us what has already
[43:59] happened and we see Jesus Christ
[44:03] yesterday but yet Lord the promise is
[44:06] unto you and to those that be a far
[44:09] off even as many as the Lord Our God
[44:12] should call we even see that
[44:15] today that you're still the same today
[44:18] as you were back then but we're even in
[44:21] a in a more Progressive Time Lord
[44:25] because this as is a restoration hour
[44:29] it's also the mystery the purpose of our
[44:32] being the purpose of our existence the
[44:35] purpose of us being here Lord is being
[44:37] revealed as to who we actually are and
[44:41] the reconciliation Lord is made complete
[44:45] Lord in this hour in our souls Lord we
[44:49] won't have to wait to get over there to
[44:53] get right Lord we thank you that that we
[44:57] have been elevated to such a position in
[45:00] our soul that we are united in an
[45:02] invisible
[45:04] Union Lord even as I've just said that
[45:08] it just seemed like something just
[45:10] opened up to me Lord God may you help me
[45:12] to get myself out of the way thank you
[45:14] for the beautiful songs of worship our
[45:17] brother leading the service and
[45:19] musicians specials God we see how that
[45:22] all has worked together God we ask it
[45:26] now God you'd help help us Lord to
[45:28] illuminate us father God without the
[45:31] Divine illumination Lord we're up here
[45:33] wasting our time God help us Lord by
[45:36] divine revelation Lord to expound with
[45:39] the authority of the word we ask it now
[45:42] in Jesus name amen amen praise the Lord
[45:46] so amen you can be
[45:50] seated I think
[45:53] I I sent a message out there and uh
[45:58] to our brother about the True
[46:01] Light is that right I think that's what
[46:03] we titled this
[46:05] tonight on the True
[46:08] Light to
[46:11] look now we're we realize that as I was
[46:14] saying there just a few moments
[46:18] ago it takes that full light we realize
[46:22] you know and I I'm aware of some of you
[46:25] are may be aware and some are not aware
[46:27] but this message has come under
[46:30] attack and it's a very concerted effort
[46:33] which means by that is it's a plan
[46:37] strategy to discredit this message if
[46:41] you don't already know it but this
[46:43] message has come under Fire in the
[46:44] Tucson newspaper it's come under Fire in
[46:48] the r Oak times it's come under Fire in
[46:51] the Hickory times in Hickory North
[46:53] Carolina and in Wisconsin star somewhere
[46:56] in newspaper up there and the Lord only
[46:58] knows where
[47:00] else Satan is determined or is
[47:03] determining in himself and I I I
[47:06] somebody asked me today how I felt all
[47:08] about that all I can say is I told them
[47:11] Satan's getting very worried he's
[47:14] getting very
[47:19] nervous well the nervousness ain't on my
[47:21] part it ain't on God's part I'm a part
[47:24] of God God ain't nervous I'm not worried
[47:28] why should I be a worried the devil's
[47:30] the one that's worried let's turn the
[47:32] table on him you see that's where the
[47:35] enlightenment of the authority of
[47:37] knowing who you are knowing your
[47:39] position in Christ you don't have to
[47:41] fear these things I'm not worried about
[47:43] it matter of fact I said it'll backfire
[47:46] on the devil some there'll be several
[47:49] people come to the message as a result
[47:50] of it some seed some there that's been
[47:53] laying dormant that was ordained to life
[47:56] predestinated to see the word it'll
[47:58] cause them to come on in the devil will
[48:01] be one miserable wreck
[48:04] after after it's all over amen that's
[48:07] the way I look at things I don't look at
[48:10] it with a negativity like oh we better
[48:13] start oh my
[48:15] goodness we better start looking for a
[48:17] place to
[48:19] hide we carry your cell phone with you
[48:22] they already know where you're
[48:24] at but the only thing is they can't
[48:26] fight find
[48:28] you you're head away in Christ they
[48:31] can't find
[48:32] you they might yeah he's he's there he's
[48:35] there but when they go to get you you're
[48:38] not there why because you're Spirit Le
[48:42] you're Spirit Led like a the people the
[48:45] king that was in that city with the
[48:47] prophet he said why they that that
[48:50] Prophet tells what you're saying in your
[48:52] bed
[48:53] chamber we thought we had them we
[48:56] thought we had his finger on
[48:58] him and all of a sudden they're not
[49:01] there what happened that's the kind of
[49:04] God I'm serving tonight he hasn't
[49:07] changed we're just getting to know him a
[49:10] little bit better than they
[49:12] did they had an understanding but now
[49:16] the whole thing's been opened
[49:19] up the whole thing and that we know that
[49:22] the scripture says that when the enemy
[49:24] comes in like a flood he to raise up a
[49:27] standard against it if the standard is
[49:30] not needed then there's no need to bring
[49:32] the
[49:34] standard but when the enemy seems to
[49:38] come in stronger it don't mean that he
[49:40] got stronger he just is trying a
[49:43] different
[49:44] trick you see God it's like I told
[49:47] somebody
[49:48] today God is not taken by
[49:52] surprise God remember this you should
[49:57] already know this by reading hearing the
[50:00] word God always has the upper
[50:09] hand now it depends where you're at and
[50:12] what you're looking
[50:13] at so that's what we want to talk about
[50:19] tonight
[50:21] Hallelujah we want to look at what the
[50:23] light shows
[50:25] us and so we realize that in this age
[50:28] and I'm just kind of navigating at this
[50:31] point to see which way the spirit is
[50:34] leading me but I want to read something
[50:37] and you this may sound a little bit
[50:41] different but brother randam said we are
[50:44] shadows of
[50:48] light now there's going to come a day
[50:51] and this is a little bit deep for you
[50:54] but if you're in the word you'll
[50:55] recognize where I'm coming
[50:58] from what we have right now in our soul
[51:01] the
[51:02] reconciliation is already in fellowship
[51:05] with God
[51:08] Almighty as far as God is concerned he
[51:11] doesn't even know that Terry Horn
[51:15] fa because he has been
[51:19] restored back to where he ought to have
[51:22] been but he's still in a house that's
[51:27] the shadow of
[51:28] light and the body is still
[51:32] falling so you got to
[51:35] realize when you get over there that's
[51:39] not going to be the time to catch up
[51:41] right now is the time to get in
[51:43] fellowship with God
[51:45] Amen
[51:47] see when an individual like you and I
[51:50] ever gets to the
[51:53] point that God you recognize that God
[51:58] doesn't even know or
[52:02] remember that you even
[52:07] fell we were born in sin coming into the
[52:11] world speaking lies the prophet tells us
[52:14] we should have come by Spoken Word
[52:17] seed we should have been
[52:19] spoke but we come the other way we
[52:22] bypassed that and we come the other way
[52:27] but now God is in this in in this
[52:30] situation with us of restoring us back
[52:35] not to a Doctrine although that's part
[52:38] of it that's part of the
[52:40] word but the person of God himself that
[52:44] you and I are being restored to
[52:48] him yes we meet him on his grounds his
[52:51] grounds is his word the doctrine and so
[52:53] forth you've got to approach God on that
[52:59] you must acknowledge God's method his
[53:02] tool for the
[53:08] day I don't mind saying but when Paul
[53:12] was
[53:13] here Paul said If any man preach any
[53:16] other gospel amen then what I preached
[53:19] unto you let him be a curse say well
[53:22] that looks like it all stacked up on one
[53:24] man and most of my denom National
[53:26] friends will agree 100% with me because
[53:30] it's there in the
[53:31] Bible God reveals nothing except he
[53:35] first reveals it to His
[53:39] prophets if I start here with Brother
[53:42] Bill and I I tell him whisper in his
[53:49] ear
[53:51] that there was this big blacking
[53:57] blue or calico
[54:00] cat that walked across mys sidewalk last
[54:04] night and then it climbed up a
[54:06] tree and then it climbed up on the roof
[54:09] of the house and it went down to the
[54:11] creek jumped across the creek then it
[54:14] decided to come back and it fell in and
[54:17] it jumped back
[54:19] out and maybe I add a few more details
[54:22] to it but I you get the point and I I
[54:25] tell him that by the time it gets around
[54:27] up here to the front to brother Levi and
[54:30] Little David sitting there I can
[54:32] guarantee you there's going to be a
[54:35] whole lot of lot of in there either
[54:37] missing or added in or not even original
[54:41] anymore that's and we still and people
[54:45] say well we got the Bible yeah we got
[54:47] the Bible and we got 10 million ideas
[54:51] about
[54:52] it God had only one interpretation in
[54:55] mind
[54:57] to his
[54:59] thoughts and you know
[55:02] I mentioned that to someone here not
[55:04] long
[55:06] ago and and it's
[55:09] like yeah you're you're
[55:12] right God only had one he did this idea
[55:16] well I I believe it's this way you
[55:19] believe in this way has nothing on
[55:23] it God is his own interpreter
[55:27] that wasn't just brother brandham saying
[55:29] that's what the Bible
[55:35] teaches the Bible teaches
[55:38] that God interprets his own
[55:41] word a prophet is a
[55:44] mouthpiece a
[55:47] spokesman for God to
[55:50] use and
[55:52] so there is there is so much at at at
[55:56] really you know a I think it's in the
[55:58] Book of Amos he says God does nothing
[56:02] but what he first reveals it to a
[56:04] Servants of
[56:05] prophets the Wesleyan Revival was
[56:08] started by one
[56:10] individual Sur there was other little
[56:12] shoots here and there that were coming
[56:14] up at the same time but there was one
[56:17] man John
[56:21] Wesley that pushed that thing through
[56:24] had to be a spear point so to speak
[56:28] Luther and all the way back Columba and
[56:30] all the ages of Martin irenius and the
[56:33] Apostle
[56:34] Paul that didn't that didn't throw the
[56:36] rest of them this okay you all listen to
[56:38] me I'm the boss and it's the way it is
[56:42] he didn't come with that kind of
[56:43] attitude to the pulpit to the church he
[56:47] came with the attitude this is a
[56:50] revelation of Jesus Christ and I pray
[56:52] God will reveal it to you as he has to
[56:55] me and he established the
[56:58] gospel sure there
[57:01] was
[57:03] Apostles
[57:05] evangelists among the Jews that was
[57:07] already fainting
[57:09] out and Peter we know the house of
[57:13] Cornelius the gospel God used
[57:16] Peter to bring the gospel to the Gentile
[57:19] and then Paul carried started to carry
[57:22] the
[57:24] chorch and then we
[57:27] find that there was the book The Bible
[57:30] the new testament which I believe is
[57:32] still going on by the
[57:35] way it didn't
[57:41] end we are still in the New Testament
[57:47] age it's all going to end when we come
[57:51] down to that great white Throne judgment
[57:53] and then there's a new heavens and a new
[57:55] Earth
[57:57] and then we're going on and even then
[57:58] there's still scripture that says that
[58:01] indicates God will continue to unfold
[58:03] himself throughout all the
[58:06] ages to
[58:08] come but then
[58:10] only God we could almost say we could
[58:14] not necessarily close this book but
[58:16] we'll see a completion of things I'm
[58:19] waiting no completion on my
[58:22] body I'm waiting for a change of my body
[58:25] my heart is already been
[58:27] restored
[58:29] so what am I doing about
[58:32] that well I tell
[58:35] you you're looking at me and I'm looking
[58:38] at you and I'm looking
[58:42] around my what such fine instruments we
[58:45] got up
[58:46] here but what are we using them for play
[58:50] devil
[58:51] music rock and roll on the
[58:54] drums you these microphones and
[58:57] screaming into them like a bunch of
[59:01] banshees when I was growing up it was
[59:03] icid Rock psychedelic
[59:05] Rock noise Rock whatever you want to
[59:08] call it drug
[59:11] Rock they did things with instruments I
[59:14] didn't even know instruments could make
[59:15] a sound like
[59:20] that but look what's what we're using
[59:22] them for I'm not looking at them drums
[59:24] I've got to have drums I just got to
[59:27] have that beat in the church to get
[59:28] myself
[59:30] excited my focus is way
[59:34] off but I used to walk in them
[59:37] shoes I'm probably a solo on that one
[59:41] the way it
[59:44] sounds but I'm
[59:48] impressed to say I'm
[59:51] not I'm not really in touch with
[59:54] reality I'm impr impressed by these
[59:56] monitors I'm impressed by the fact we
[59:59] can have a service over the
[1:00:00] Internet through a phone connection
[1:00:03] through a I guess it's it's a it's a
[1:00:05] cable
[1:00:07] line I'm
[1:00:10] impressed I'm impressed by the
[1:00:13] lights but there's something that's
[1:00:15] greater I'm not here just because of
[1:00:17] that that we got heat and air
[1:00:19] conditioning in this building that's
[1:00:21] good but I'm here for another purpose
[1:00:24] and that's to see Jesus Christ in his
[1:00:27] word this is a house of
[1:00:29] correction this is a house where we can
[1:00:32] come and worship and we can go into the
[1:00:35] into the structure of
[1:00:37] God the structure of his word and know
[1:00:40] how to
[1:00:41] live
[1:00:43] why said I thought we got the Holy
[1:00:46] Ghost we
[1:00:48] do just your body ain't got the Holy
[1:00:52] Ghost that's why we still have a house
[1:00:54] of correction
[1:00:56] that's why I need to be
[1:00:59] corrected God that's why God has
[1:01:01] ordained gifts into the
[1:01:03] church to help us to walk the way to
[1:01:05] point out the
[1:01:07] pitfalls to point out all the Shady
[1:01:10] spots that the devil lays out for
[1:01:14] us you got a lot of light in this
[1:01:18] room like I said
[1:01:20] before that light ain't going to help
[1:01:22] these plants
[1:01:27] the other night I seen sister Faith
[1:01:28] bring a light up here and over there
[1:01:32] plugged it in and turned it
[1:01:37] on and they're
[1:01:40] flourishing just like they was outside a
[1:01:43] man has somehow tapped into the
[1:01:46] knowledge of
[1:01:47] God and the science and so forth of God
[1:01:51] and knows how to
[1:01:52] recreate that light that's out there
[1:01:56] through an electronic
[1:01:58] light I can't really explain it is I
[1:02:00] believe it's
[1:02:01] ultraviolet but now those lights if you
[1:02:04] if them things just we left them lights
[1:02:07] on in here those plants that look
[1:02:10] miserable after a while wouldn't take
[1:02:13] long they get sick they get doy they get
[1:02:18] the leaves that start turning yellow or
[1:02:21] whatever it signs of
[1:02:24] death what a sickness lead to
[1:02:28] death and so what about you and
[1:02:34] I without the
[1:02:36] light we're going to get
[1:02:39] sick and without that light we're not
[1:02:42] just going to get sick but Satan would
[1:02:43] try to kill us and he he even try to
[1:02:45] kill us physically if he
[1:02:48] could what did the Bible
[1:02:50] say for the lack of knowledge my people
[1:02:53] are destroyed
[1:02:56] the lack of knowledge of the word of God
[1:02:58] to implement it into our
[1:03:01] lives you
[1:03:03] see we're yes we're we're ruling Christ
[1:03:07] is ruling from our
[1:03:08] hearts but every day I got to put up
[1:03:12] with this and I've got 10 million other
[1:03:14] people out here that I've got to show
[1:03:17] the love of God to my
[1:03:20] neighbors and sometimes hey I I the
[1:03:24] shoe's been on the other foot
[1:03:26] I haven't always been the best neighbor
[1:03:28] I'll be right up front and tell you
[1:03:29] right
[1:03:32] now how about
[1:03:35] you have you always been very neighborly
[1:03:38] and
[1:03:39] Christlike or if
[1:03:42] uh just like every year well I better
[1:03:46] not you know it's fall the leaves are
[1:03:49] flying
[1:03:50] everywhere about the time I get my yard
[1:03:53] clean a big windstorm M and my
[1:03:57] neighbor's just a little bit slow
[1:03:59] getting his leaves up and they all come
[1:04:01] over into my yard he don't come over
[1:04:04] into my yard to get him
[1:04:08] up yeah I don't know about you but I'm
[1:04:12] expressing myself and I'm letting you
[1:04:13] know these are things that we still have
[1:04:16] a a carnal mind that we need to bring
[1:04:19] under
[1:04:20] subjection by the Christ that's on the
[1:04:22] throne of our heart and pray for our
[1:04:24] neighbor pray for your brother and many
[1:04:26] times is not the unbeliever it's right
[1:04:28] amongst the brothers and sisters
[1:04:31] somebody said something or somebody did
[1:04:37] something see then that's the
[1:04:40] time or be living in the
[1:04:43] light think of brother T well I won't
[1:04:46] get into
[1:04:49] that but it's walking in that light
[1:04:53] constantly it's a battle
[1:04:56] brother Brown said that Satan has a
[1:04:58] Punch coming at
[1:05:00] you he said you might miss an accident
[1:05:03] you might miss this you might miss that
[1:05:06] but somewhere if God
[1:05:09] carries there's an appointed time for
[1:05:11] you to leave here and it may not be the
[1:05:14] way you want to
[1:05:16] leave think about
[1:05:19] that I think of brother Christian we
[1:05:21] were talking about it before service
[1:05:24] tonight
[1:05:26] nobody wanted to see his dad
[1:05:28] leave no one he was a
[1:05:32] Believer
[1:05:33] God God knows what he's
[1:05:37] doing I say God search my heart but at
[1:05:40] the same token I I want to reach out I
[1:05:42] want to pray for brother Christian give
[1:05:45] him you know and I failed on that
[1:05:48] already but we need to reach out to our
[1:05:51] brother and his mom I know they've got a
[1:05:54] little church there in New York but
[1:05:56] still he's part of the
[1:05:58] body we care for one another if there's
[1:06:02] an injury what do we do we nurse the
[1:06:04] injury we get it back to health we clean
[1:06:07] the wound you know or we bandage it up
[1:06:09] you pour in the oil and the
[1:06:11] wine do what we can to try to make their
[1:06:14] life a little bit easier cuz I really
[1:06:17] don't know what that's like I never lost
[1:06:18] my dad like that I almost did one
[1:06:23] time so you got to think about those
[1:06:26] things
[1:06:28] sensitivity we live in a time of
[1:06:31] insensitivity and I'm probably one of
[1:06:33] the worst
[1:06:35] ones being sensitive to other people's
[1:06:39] needs sometimes people just don't need
[1:06:41] more Doctrine they just need a god with
[1:06:44] skin on
[1:06:45] it that's what they
[1:06:50] need you see brother BR said we've got
[1:06:52] to put ourselves into their shoes don't
[1:06:56] criticize your neighbor what's the old
[1:06:57] inan
[1:06:58] proverb you know you don't you don't
[1:07:01] criticize your neighbor until you walked
[1:07:03] in his shoes several
[1:07:05] miles then you will understand and
[1:07:08] that's that should be our attitude and
[1:07:10] Christ is not he's also a compassionate
[1:07:13] God he's a you know his word That's What
[1:07:15] doctrine is really there for to show us
[1:07:18] the it's not all about judgment you know
[1:07:21] is we know there's a life and death
[1:07:24] situation the Bible says a soul that
[1:07:26] sinth it shall
[1:07:28] die but he's also a compassionate God
[1:07:31] and I was thinking of that Jesus last
[1:07:33] stars on the cross one prophecy after
[1:07:36] another is being fulfilled amen and he
[1:07:39] looks down
[1:07:41] there and he
[1:07:43] sees the
[1:07:46] woman that allowed her
[1:07:49] body to be a
[1:07:52] vessel for the sperm and the Egg to be
[1:07:55] created within her not the Immaculate
[1:07:58] Conception now we don't believe
[1:08:00] that and he looks down there and he sees
[1:08:03] her heart is torn she doesn't maybe even
[1:08:06] have a full understanding at that
[1:08:10] point I that that's kind of back and
[1:08:13] forth on
[1:08:15] that her heart is
[1:08:20] shredded Jesus last hours he looks down
[1:08:24] there and he sees her heart is
[1:08:28] bleeding for
[1:08:30] him for what he's having to go
[1:08:33] through and he looks at her and he says
[1:08:36] woman notice woman not Mom not mother
[1:08:42] but
[1:08:43] woman Behold thy
[1:08:46] son
[1:08:48] son Behold thy mother and the Bible says
[1:08:52] he took her I believe it was John or
[1:08:56] whoever that disciple took her to his
[1:09:00] house that very
[1:09:03] day in his last
[1:09:06] moments when he was getting ready to
[1:09:09] leave his body and descend as a
[1:09:13] sinner into the regions of the
[1:09:17] Damned and suffer as a sinner for you
[1:09:21] and
[1:09:22] me he's still thinking about
[1:09:26] others and then the thief on the cross
[1:09:29] the two
[1:09:34] thieves
[1:09:36] today Thou shalt be with me in Paradise
[1:09:42] how he got the words out I don't know
[1:09:45] because he was in incredible
[1:09:49] suffering and the weight of your sin and
[1:09:52] my sin is hanging on in the way of the
[1:09:56] sins of the whole
[1:09:59] world because it was a sing onetime
[1:10:02] sacrifice a onetime
[1:10:05] shop a one-time stop that sin was going
[1:10:09] to be dealt
[1:10:11] with but
[1:10:13] yet he's
[1:10:15] thinking when he was on the cross I was
[1:10:17] on his
[1:10:18] mind but he looks
[1:10:21] over and there's that that
[1:10:23] Thief we deserve deserve to die this man
[1:10:27] has done nothing
[1:10:29] wrong and he tells him
[1:10:31] today you'll be with me in Paradise
[1:10:37] Lord I'm just preaching the way it's
[1:10:39] coming out the way it's coming to me now
[1:10:43] what we look
[1:10:45] at we're looking at
[1:10:47] something we might be thinking about
[1:10:50] that house we're working on we might be
[1:10:52] thinking about that car and God give you
[1:10:54] a good car
[1:10:56] you're about to get it paid for you're
[1:10:58] thinking about that hopefully not right
[1:11:01] now maybe you're thinking
[1:11:03] about this that and the
[1:11:06] other what's in the Forefront of your
[1:11:09] mind I want to read to you how many
[1:11:11] knows what the second commandment
[1:11:14] is right off the top of your
[1:11:17] head Exodus chapter
[1:11:23] 20 you're looking at something tonight
[1:11:26] we're all looking at
[1:11:28] something you're looking at a vessel
[1:11:31] here I'm looking at a vessel there has
[1:11:35] fallen but I'm also seeing something
[1:11:37] else in you and you're seeing hopefully
[1:11:40] you're seeing the same thing in me
[1:11:42] you're seeing a light you're seeing a
[1:11:47] life I hope my neighbors see
[1:11:50] that I want them to see that amen less
[1:11:54] of me more of him Exodus chapter
[1:11:59] 20 on the second
[1:12:07] commandment verse one and God spake all
[1:12:09] these words saying I am the Lord thy God
[1:12:12] which have brought thee out of the land
[1:12:13] of Egypt out of the house of bondage
[1:12:16] Thou shalt have no other gods before me
[1:12:19] commandment one number
[1:12:23] two thou shalt not make unto thee any
[1:12:26] Graven image or likeness of anything
[1:12:29] that is in heaven above or that is in
[1:12:32] the earth beneath or that is in the
[1:12:35] water under the Earth verse five Thou
[1:12:39] shalt not bow down thyself to them nor
[1:12:43] serve them for I the Lord thy God am a
[1:12:46] jealous
[1:12:48] God I'm glad he's jealous over
[1:12:51] me now that's not the kind of jealousy
[1:12:56] you know a man would about kill another
[1:12:59] man for making a comment about his wife
[1:13:02] but he said a real Christian would pray
[1:13:04] for that man of course I might have
[1:13:06] something to
[1:13:11] say about
[1:13:14] it but sometimes love is
[1:13:17] tough
[1:13:22] agree but brother brm said you pray for
[1:13:24] that Poor Man's lost
[1:13:27] soul when a man that's an unbeliever
[1:13:30] about kill the other guy and sold his
[1:13:32] wife the prophet
[1:13:34] said but I'm thankful God is jealous
[1:13:37] over me because we are his bride and he
[1:13:40] has no
[1:13:42] other he loves you he loves me we are
[1:13:46] his bride a many membered
[1:13:49] bride he has eyes for no other as sister
[1:13:52] Alice sings that song Sometimes what a
[1:13:55] beautiful
[1:13:56] bride she is and he's jealous so what
[1:14:01] about now I want to say something
[1:14:08] here
[1:14:11] God looks down and he sees the character
[1:14:14] of
[1:14:15] himself in you and I right yet we are an
[1:14:21] individual brother Ram said it there is
[1:14:23] a quote where he says we are the
[1:14:25] feminine part of
[1:14:28] God you got to recognize who you
[1:14:31] are now do you know that God and I I
[1:14:35] want to say this don't nobody get the
[1:14:37] wrong idea but God worships
[1:14:41] you he thinks of you as his
[1:14:45] handiwork
[1:14:47] well that's what the Bible
[1:14:49] says is this Bible God's holy word what
[1:14:53] what did the prophet tell us about this
[1:14:55] bride bone of his bone flesh of his
[1:14:58] flesh makeup of his makeup only in the
[1:15:01] feminine
[1:15:04] form and he loves to see his purchased
[1:15:10] redeemed bride he's already looking at
[1:15:13] you you're just waiting for your new
[1:15:15] body he already sees you in a new
[1:15:19] body he doesn't even remember that you
[1:15:22] fell amen that you came to the world
[1:15:24] with a
[1:15:26] Naval he doesn't he
[1:15:28] doesn't he doesn't remember that God
[1:15:32] that's how deep it
[1:15:35] goes when you see that what are we
[1:15:37] waiting on we're waiting for the
[1:15:39] completion of the Bride the Readiness of
[1:15:42] the Bride the ripening in the sun and
[1:15:44] the full
[1:15:49] maturity and it is coming to maturity
[1:15:51] and it will come to
[1:15:53] maturity it's will will come amen I find
[1:15:58] it very
[1:16:00] fascinating on this maturity
[1:16:07] thing we got Believers
[1:16:11] here of all many different
[1:16:14] levels see these two young boys up
[1:16:17] here Brother David brother Levi yall are
[1:16:22] believers you're not just doing this
[1:16:24] because Mom and Daddy I think you
[1:16:27] already feel a pull you want to do
[1:16:30] this you don't have to say yes or no I
[1:16:32] won't put you on the
[1:16:34] spot but I think you want to be
[1:16:37] here I think you enjoy the
[1:16:40] services you clap your hands and not
[1:16:43] because there's something inside you
[1:16:46] that yeah I want to do that by the way
[1:16:50] God doesn't make us do anything we want
[1:16:54] to do it
[1:16:58] but I find it very
[1:17:00] fascinating that one of these mornings
[1:17:03] between six and
[1:17:05] nine that everyone that is elected
[1:17:08] predestinated to go in that Rapture is
[1:17:11] going to be there not one
[1:17:16] shy so if you ever wonder about your
[1:17:19] maturity level am I going to make it let
[1:17:21] me tell you something we're all at
[1:17:24] different levels
[1:17:25] yes but about the time that you think
[1:17:28] you have a long ways to go maybe just
[1:17:32] the hour
[1:17:33] like our
[1:17:37] brother didn't know
[1:17:39] it but he reached his maturity
[1:17:42] level
[1:17:45] amen he may have thought I got a long
[1:17:48] ways to go see God don't look at you try
[1:17:51] to perfect this flesh it's never going
[1:17:53] to happen I don't care if you Liv for a
[1:17:56] thousand years with the Holy Ghost in
[1:17:57] your soul you'll never perfect this
[1:18:01] flesh yes you will get closer to
[1:18:04] God
[1:18:06] yes but one day Enoch got so close to
[1:18:09] God God said hey buddy hey my
[1:18:13] son we're we're closer to my house than
[1:18:18] yours you know what I've only said this
[1:18:21] in
[1:18:22] public just recently
[1:18:27] his work was
[1:18:29] finished no
[1:18:32] doubt you say what was Enoch's
[1:18:37] work the
[1:18:43] pyramid
[1:18:45] line upon
[1:18:47] line of
[1:18:50] precision to the thousands of an inch
[1:18:55] God said I want you to build me a
[1:18:58] testimoni and
[1:19:00] stone and you will have
[1:19:06] access this is a Model T
[1:19:10] forward compared to what he
[1:19:16] had or even a horse in
[1:19:21] buggy they had an advanced science
[1:19:26] that was Far Beyond
[1:19:32] ours but none of those things in that
[1:19:35] world in which Enoch lived he didn't go
[1:19:39] and live as an
[1:19:40] Amish and I love my Amish Friends by the
[1:19:43] way we got brother here tonight who
[1:19:45] former Amish but I love my Amish people
[1:19:47] anyway I pray for their
[1:19:50] souls even if they're not called it
[1:19:53] they'll come to know Christ as their
[1:19:55] lord and
[1:19:56] savior before it's
[1:20:00] over but Enoch lived like everybody
[1:20:05] else no doubt had a construction crew
[1:20:08] and access to the most scientific
[1:20:11] advanced technology for that
[1:20:16] time and he may have been a wealthy man
[1:20:19] for that fact
[1:20:24] looking at that pyramid I'd venture to
[1:20:27] say he had to have some books in his
[1:20:30] account to pay those workers and the
[1:20:34] rent on that specialized equipment for
[1:20:36] that
[1:20:41] hour are we not living in the same
[1:20:44] thing as it was in the days
[1:20:49] of but regardless of all those
[1:20:52] impressions of fascin ations to the
[1:20:55] human mind see that's where we have to
[1:20:58] battle against these things I like to
[1:21:01] restore a car that I used to
[1:21:04] drive I like I like things to fix
[1:21:08] things but my focused in life my general
[1:21:12] purpose in life my main focus is driving
[1:21:16] down that road staying between the
[1:21:18] yellow line and the white
[1:21:19] line if I get to looking around then
[1:21:23] I've got a Wandering up
[1:21:25] and I'm worshiping my surroundings and
[1:21:28] I'm going to have a
[1:21:31] wreck I got a snow plow like I used to
[1:21:34] up and down this hill out here had to
[1:21:37] keep my eye on that
[1:21:39] road big old
[1:21:42] plow Lord I don't know how in the
[1:21:47] world I ever got around some vehicles on
[1:21:50] some of these
[1:21:51] roads I a plow
[1:21:55] you got to turn it all the
[1:21:57] way either to the left or to the right
[1:22:01] to get that angle to
[1:22:03] minimize the space yeah because you'll
[1:22:06] run a vehicle off the road or take the
[1:22:08] side of a vehicle
[1:22:15] out
[1:22:17] yeah there was times I stopped going
[1:22:20] down OT Road anybody that's been down OT
[1:22:23] Road or a Kaba road down here in the
[1:22:26] Kaba
[1:22:31] Valley I stop wait till they pass and I
[1:22:35] go on my
[1:22:37] way but all of that science that Enoch
[1:22:41] had access to he kept his eyes on the
[1:22:44] prize his walk with God he said I
[1:22:47] believe God I want to please God and he
[1:22:50] built a permid I'm a working on a
[1:22:53] building
[1:22:55] I'm a working on a building I'm a
[1:22:58] working on a building for my lord for my
[1:23:02] lord it's a holy ghost
[1:23:05] building Bible and
[1:23:08] stone King's chamber Queen's
[1:23:11] chamber death burial
[1:23:15] Resurrection it's all in the
[1:23:17] pyramid it's there the prophet said
[1:23:21] Enoch build it and then they
[1:23:25] he said don't put a headstone on
[1:23:30] it but God said it I'll do
[1:23:34] it I don't know if Enoch really
[1:23:37] understood why The Headstone why he
[1:23:40] wasn't tall to put a headstone on it
[1:23:42] somebody said ton that to Enoch you're
[1:23:44] doing a mighty fine job but and you say
[1:23:47] you're
[1:23:48] finished why ain't The Headstone there
[1:23:52] looks like something's missing yes it
[1:23:53] was missing
[1:23:55] cuz it wasn't that
[1:23:58] hour but there was a place for it so God
[1:24:03] has made a place for
[1:24:05] you he has he has chopped out and after
[1:24:09] he's chopped he's ground and he's filed
[1:24:11] like
[1:24:13] Michelangelo on a block of
[1:24:16] stone and there's a
[1:24:18] place for him to
[1:24:21] reside as a headstone
[1:24:24] in your
[1:24:31] life praise the
[1:24:33] Lord I don't know if it makes any sense
[1:24:36] to
[1:24:41] you David said I will set no evil thing
[1:24:45] before me I will set no Wicked the 101st
[1:24:49] Psalm I will set no Wicked thing before
[1:24:54] for
[1:24:55] me now what about my loved ones what
[1:24:59] about my friends what about my neighbor
[1:25:01] what about the citizens of the state and
[1:25:04] the country and the citizens of the
[1:25:06] world do they not walk by light also
[1:25:12] yes it's not totally
[1:25:18] dark there is gross Darkness coming upon
[1:25:20] the
[1:25:21] people the pope has already declared
[1:25:25] that now we can bless same-sex
[1:25:28] marriages you didn't know that it's
[1:25:31] official the
[1:25:34] pope gross Darkness upon the people but
[1:25:38] in the evening time it shall be light
[1:25:42] don't tell me we can't have light in
[1:25:44] this hour don't tell me that it ain't
[1:25:46] possible to have a light to guide us and
[1:25:49] that God's going to have a beautiful
[1:25:51] bride whose garments will be unstain by
[1:25:54] the world not stayed by the things of
[1:25:58] this
[1:25:59] world there's times I was on the job and
[1:26:03] boy I had some good people that I work
[1:26:07] for there was just times I was glad when
[1:26:10] the shift was over all that cigarette
[1:26:18] smoke country music or rock and roll
[1:26:22] playing all the radio
[1:26:25] I was glad when the shift was
[1:26:27] over and you know what some of those
[1:26:30] things left an impression on
[1:26:32] me I'm on
[1:26:34] now you
[1:26:38] know you we've got to guard our mind
[1:26:42] guide her guard our
[1:26:45] eyes this world's got a lot like I said
[1:26:48] I'm impressed but I'm more impressed
[1:26:51] with the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:26:54] brother brandham said if there's
[1:26:55] anything that we need more of we don't
[1:26:57] need more Science and Technology yes
[1:27:00] they help us thank God for the heat the
[1:27:02] air conditioning here thank God for the
[1:27:05] sound system thank God that we can reach
[1:27:07] beyond the four walls go on to cyers
[1:27:11] space but our focus is on Jesus
[1:27:14] Christ cuz someday there'll be no need
[1:27:16] of
[1:27:18] cyber cyers space so be no need of an
[1:27:21] automobile or a power plant
[1:27:24] yeah my wife and I drove through
[1:27:28] Canada on our return and on our way up
[1:27:31] in Wisconsin Minnesota never been there
[1:27:33] in my
[1:27:34] life but
[1:27:37] uh it was
[1:27:46] awesome about the same
[1:27:48] time we got up there brother Steve said
[1:27:52] you ought to see our night sky I went
[1:27:54] outside and looked around up there I
[1:27:56] didn't see
[1:27:58] anything he said her night sky is just
[1:28:00] full of the Northern Lights very visible
[1:28:04] some of you seen them some of you you
[1:28:06] post the
[1:28:07] pictures there all some up there and in
[1:28:09] cenone I didn't really look to be
[1:28:11] truthful with
[1:28:15] you but you know the handy work of God
[1:28:20] but yet the whole world
[1:28:24] even in its Fallen condition uh don't
[1:28:26] get me wrong even in its Fallen
[1:28:29] Condition it's still
[1:28:32] beautiful but if you ever got one
[1:28:35] glimpse of what it should look
[1:28:43] like be
[1:28:46] you
[1:28:48] yeah brother Ram
[1:28:51] said do I have to go back
[1:28:54] right remember when he was taken beyond
[1:28:58] the curtain of time he said do I have to
[1:29:00] go
[1:29:01] back why did he say that cuz this world
[1:29:05] looked pretty
[1:29:07] spooky when you seen those people over
[1:29:10] there and there was no sense of physical
[1:29:13] or physical touch of the the normal
[1:29:16] human that was all gone yet he said I
[1:29:19] could feel them they could speak to me
[1:29:21] they were real in a theophany
[1:29:26] he didn't want to come
[1:29:29] back so if if he felt like that then
[1:29:32] what about you and
[1:29:34] I if we ever and we just believe what
[1:29:38] the prophet said believe it it's
[1:29:41] true what was Sister Longoria down there
[1:29:44] in the hospital or wherever she was
[1:29:46] before she passed and brother
[1:29:49] Danny can't remember the last name
[1:29:57] no
[1:29:58] Williams she come back she said to
[1:30:01] brother Homer he's just as funny as he
[1:30:03] was when he was
[1:30:07] here she was seeing
[1:30:09] things like so many others that once
[1:30:14] they caught a
[1:30:18] glimpse don't want to come back here now
[1:30:22] you young people it'd be hard for you to
[1:30:24] relate to that and even me I put myself
[1:30:27] in that yeah I'm not I'm 64 yeah I'm not
[1:30:31] young but I there's certain things about
[1:30:34] this life that I do
[1:30:36] like but if I ever can allow myself to
[1:30:40] see without even seeing with my
[1:30:43] eye see with the eye of Faith what the
[1:30:47] prophet has told us what the word tells
[1:30:49] us about my future home I'm homesick for
[1:30:53] it
[1:30:58] I
[1:30:59] believe there's a place over there right
[1:31:02] now with my name on the
[1:31:06] door hey can you prove it you got the
[1:31:09] picture you got the video I've got a
[1:31:12] vision a
[1:31:13] revelation from the word of God that's
[1:31:17] me that's my future home I believe what
[1:31:20] the prophet preached when he said future
[1:31:22] home
[1:31:24] what is that it's a
[1:31:27] revelation it's a Heavenly
[1:31:29] light I didn't read any quotes tonight
[1:31:32] and I got a bunch of them and I'm out of
[1:31:35] time but there's one
[1:31:37] quote I do want to
[1:31:46] read this is taken from a message
[1:31:48] preached in 1960 to whom shall we go
[1:31:54] now
[1:31:55] listen I talked to you about this before
[1:31:57] in a false light there is the thing is
[1:32:01] this is all false light by the
[1:32:03] way this is false light now you got to
[1:32:07] get the right perspective of
[1:32:09] that if you look at me you're looking at
[1:32:11] a flop of
[1:32:13] failure you're looking at a flawed human
[1:32:16] being but if you can see Christ if I
[1:32:19] could die enough and crucify the old man
[1:32:21] that you can see Jesus Christ in me then
[1:32:24] my life is fulfilled my purpose is
[1:32:26] fulfilled and God gets the
[1:32:34] glory I'm
[1:32:36] actually that's why I said keep your
[1:32:39] eyes on the road stay in the middle of
[1:32:41] the road stay in your
[1:32:45] lane if you get to looking around and
[1:32:48] all these other
[1:32:50] attractions yeah these other attractions
[1:32:53] will cause you to have an
[1:32:55] accident you got to keep your eyes on
[1:32:58] the
[1:32:59] road
[1:33:02] amen whatever you might be it's a false
[1:33:04] light you might be in the russellite
[1:33:06] church you might be in a campbellite
[1:33:09] church or some other
[1:33:11] light listen some other light church
[1:33:18] that's what he says but until you get in
[1:33:21] Jesus you're not in light
[1:33:24] yeah you're not in light you're still in
[1:33:29] darkness
[1:33:31] now theay of
[1:33:33] seeing people stumbling
[1:33:39] around God only knows when a person
[1:33:42] crosses a
[1:33:43] line that's not for me to determine
[1:33:47] matter of fact I don't want to
[1:33:52] know but people are still as long as the
[1:33:55] life is in their body the blood is still
[1:33:59] here for the
[1:34:01] sinner look and live my brother live
[1:34:04] look away from
[1:34:06] television look away from these worldly
[1:34:09] things look to the brght serpent on the
[1:34:12] pole look at live you don't have to
[1:34:16] perish that's Moses lifted up the
[1:34:19] serpent Jesus said in John
[1:34:21] 3:14 so must the son of man be lifted up
[1:34:24] what did the brass serpent on the pole
[1:34:26] represent it represented your sin
[1:34:29] already judged on
[1:34:31] him and if they looked it was a
[1:34:33] foreshadow of Jesus Christ who became
[1:34:37] sin he who knew no sin became sin that
[1:34:41] we might be the righteousness of God and
[1:34:44] I say to you the righteousness of God I
[1:34:47] mean exactly as the Bible says it there
[1:34:50] ain't a first righteousness and a second
[1:34:52] righteousness there's only one
[1:34:54] righteousness of
[1:34:58] God you're not second you're not a
[1:35:00] factory
[1:35:03] second God's only got one of you and
[1:35:07] he's proud of his
[1:35:10] work they put Mercedes on that car used
[1:35:13] to drive brother Terry because they were
[1:35:16] proud of the work and they want to show
[1:35:19] it off they put
[1:35:22] BMW sister Lisa driving around here also
[1:35:25] in the Mercedes God bless her
[1:35:30] heart they put their name on it Ford
[1:35:34] Chevy
[1:35:36] Honda they put their name on it
[1:35:39] wherefore they are not ashamed to say
[1:35:43] this is a product of our technology what
[1:35:47] about you what about your
[1:35:52] Michelangelo you're not a piece of stone
[1:35:54] but you're a
[1:35:55] living a living
[1:35:58] soul and he is shaping and molding In
[1:36:02] His Image and you're battling this flesh
[1:36:05] each and every day you battle a mind you
[1:36:06] battle a spirit memory conscious
[1:36:09] reasoning affection every single day
[1:36:12] don't tell me you don't because you do I
[1:36:16] do but we're successful
[1:36:23] see God sees Perfection when we don't
[1:36:26] that's
[1:36:29] right and God
[1:36:31] sees a
[1:36:33] need when we think we're
[1:36:37] complete praise the Lord
[1:36:40] anybody thank God for that Pastor that
[1:36:43] visiting Minister come by and rake the
[1:36:45] hide off of me praise God I needed that
[1:36:48] thank you Lord
[1:36:54] I passed you know what God is so sure of
[1:36:57] you and I he
[1:36:59] says you've already passed from Death un
[1:37:02] life and you will not come into the
[1:37:04] Judgment I'm getting away from this
[1:37:06] microphone forgive me you will not your
[1:37:10] judgment was already met in Christ yes
[1:37:13] we'll stand before the Judgment seat of
[1:37:14] Christ yes that is true but not to see
[1:37:18] where our flaws were where the rewards
[1:37:21] will be given out
[1:37:25] you're getting your flaws right now yes
[1:37:28] there is things that we can do yes there
[1:37:30] is a Draw N to
[1:37:32] God it's not many times that's why we
[1:37:35] have preachers and teachers and
[1:37:37] evangelists and missionaries a fivefold
[1:37:40] Ministry to show us these things where
[1:37:44] we need to brush up and improve our
[1:37:46] lives where there needs to be some more
[1:37:48] dying out maybe some hidden jealousy
[1:37:52] some hidden lust in the
[1:37:59] flesh thou shallal have no other gods
[1:38:01] before
[1:38:02] me no
[1:38:04] images
[1:38:07] images images all around
[1:38:11] me yes we enjoyed the countryside but if
[1:38:15] I was a sinner man and I looked at that
[1:38:18] and and not even knowing but what I'm
[1:38:20] seeing is a Fallen World sure it's
[1:38:23] beautiful it still retains it retains
[1:38:25] that you he doesn't see anything else
[1:38:27] it's the most beautiful world he's ever
[1:38:30] going to see if he don't
[1:38:32] repent that's
[1:38:34] right he won't be in the new Earth he
[1:38:37] won't be in a new city he'll be in a
[1:38:38] lake of
[1:38:44] fire no matter young people older
[1:38:51] people your heart
[1:38:54] the Bible say he's deceitfully wicked
[1:38:57] and who can know it every person need to
[1:39:00] be born again brother Bram had to be
[1:39:02] born
[1:39:06] again every man of God Paul had to be
[1:39:09] converted he was a
[1:39:11] murderer a religious
[1:39:13] murderer intent on locking people up
[1:39:16] killing people Stone and
[1:39:21] Steven he had to be born again and the
[1:39:24] old nature had to
[1:39:26] die because you could look at you could
[1:39:30] live out here on the side of a mountain
[1:39:33] or in some beautiful Valley that's
[1:39:35] remote and isolated like I see in
[1:39:37] Pennsylvania I say boy if it was up to
[1:39:40] me I like to go in them valleys that are
[1:39:42] about 50 60 70 Mi long and they're only
[1:39:46] about 3 miles wide nothing but
[1:39:49] Farms beautiful mountain sides straight
[1:39:52] As a Razor for miles until you see the
[1:39:55] the mountain dive into the Earth whe the
[1:39:59] Earth meet the top of the mountain The
[1:40:01] Horizon meets the
[1:40:03] Earth if it was up to
[1:40:06] me that's where I would
[1:40:08] be I always dream about having a big
[1:40:11] Stone Blue Stone House two chimneys on
[1:40:15] each end of the
[1:40:17] house but you know what even if I saw
[1:40:21] everything good without a Chang in my
[1:40:24] heart I'm still a wretched sinner
[1:40:26] without God so were you and I thank God
[1:40:30] it's one good thing about
[1:40:33] memory we still
[1:40:36] remember but we were talking here a
[1:40:37] minute ago oh family we
[1:40:44] know oh they're going to they got some
[1:40:47] things to deal with
[1:40:54] I used to read a lot I still still do I
[1:40:58] want to make sure I read more of the
[1:41:00] word but I read enough of things about
[1:41:02] the
[1:41:04] battlefield I understand why these guys
[1:41:06] get
[1:41:10] PTSD I wouldn't have to go into the Gory
[1:41:13] details but if you're seeing somebody
[1:41:15] there that's standing there or Crouch
[1:41:18] down in a foxhole with you and all of a
[1:41:22] Sol sudden a shell explodes right above
[1:41:25] you and a piece of shrapnell takes half
[1:41:27] of his back
[1:41:29] out his spine is exposed and he's dead
[1:41:33] just like
[1:41:35] that living one moment dead the
[1:41:39] next and there's a lot of other gory
[1:41:41] stuff going on because it's
[1:41:44] indiscriminate when the bullets are
[1:41:46] flying they're meant to get somebody
[1:41:53] the recovery teams going out there in
[1:41:55] the battlefield it it it's it's see
[1:41:57] that's the side nobody wants to talk
[1:41:59] about these body bags and stuff they
[1:42:02] almost have to use sometimes forks and
[1:42:06] shovels yeah yeah that's what this
[1:42:09] military hardware is designed it's
[1:42:12] horrible it's hideous
[1:42:15] yeah soldier that was once a baby in a
[1:42:18] Mother's arms
[1:42:20] disintegrated there's nothing even to go
[1:42:23] back home for the mom and dad or family
[1:42:27] wife children to
[1:42:30] see thank God the Prince of Peace it's
[1:42:36] going to be raining on this Earth
[1:42:37] there'll be no more of that that's
[1:42:40] hideous and I'm saying here let me
[1:42:43] finish this quote in closing y'all can
[1:42:46] stand with
[1:42:51] me I hope I didn't know upset Somebody
[1:42:53] by
[1:42:54] that sin is not
[1:42:57] beautiful it is horrendous it is
[1:43:00] hideous it is vicious it is
[1:43:06] Savage people will do things that
[1:43:09] they're anointed by demons they'll do
[1:43:11] things they ordinarily wouldn't
[1:43:19] do you don't have light till you come to
[1:43:22] him for he is a way the truth and the
[1:43:23] light and the only way to God no man
[1:43:26] cometh to the father except by me so you
[1:43:28] can't go to God you can't go to heaven
[1:43:31] you have to get in the way Jesus is that
[1:43:33] way he is the only truth there is he's
[1:43:36] the only light the only true light the
[1:43:38] only true manifested light is Jesus

[1:43:47] have all kinds of Lights remember
[1:43:49] they're
[1:43:51] lights but anything that don't bring you
[1:43:53] to the full truth and relationship with
[1:43:55] God is a false
[1:44:00] light Samson had had a vision of a
[1:44:02] beautiful woman in his
[1:44:04] [Music]
[1:44:06] eye was nothing wrong with him Desiring

[1:44:19] defeat and he started seeing images
[1:44:25] images and the first thing you know he
[1:44:27] ask her out they start seeing each other
[1:44:30] what a pecul
[1:44:33] thing what A peculiar
[1:44:37] thing here he's raised up by God to
[1:44:41] break and loosen the chains of the
[1:44:46] Philistines and what's her
[1:44:49] name

[1:44:58] see me and he's seen that
[1:45:01] woman and she was do out a pretty thing
[1:45:05] oh yeah oh yeah the devil knows how to
[1:45:09] do
[1:45:10] it see there's nothing wrong with
[1:45:13] beauty that's why we want our sisters to
[1:45:17] look beautiful a sister that's just in
[1:45:20] her to look good look right for her
[1:45:22] husband
[1:45:23] [Music]

[1:45:28] skirt high
[1:45:32] heels all that stuff's coming
[1:45:34] [Music]
[1:45:37] back see they're looking at something
[1:45:39] they're looking at something they're not
[1:45:40] looking at the word if you look at the
[1:45:42] word you want to conform to Christ you
[1:45:45] don't want Christ to conform to you you
[1:45:49] conformed to Christ
[1:45:55] look
[1:45:57] theila has her on his
[1:46:00] mind playing with
[1:46:03] fire it wasn't
[1:46:05] long she won she become king she became
[1:46:10] his light he he put off looking at the
[1:46:13] light of the call that was on his life
[1:46:16] before he was
[1:46:17] born and he temporarily started looking
[1:46:20] at her and she took him away maybe she
[1:46:23] didn't even
[1:46:24] realize what she was even doing but she
[1:46:28] was a pagan and a
[1:46:30] heathen she probably enjoyed his
[1:46:34] company
[1:46:35] yeah but she had a heart that was
[1:46:38] deceitfully
[1:46:39] wicked she didn't even live true to him
[1:46:43] he was playing with fire she was just
[1:46:45] trying to get him when they come to her
[1:46:47] and they started rolling out the cash
[1:46:50] said you got to get him for us you got
[1:46:52] to find out what's causing him to keep
[1:46:55] moving like a
[1:47:00] bulldozer
[1:47:02] yeah and
[1:47:04] finally
[1:47:06] finally she wins his confidence he was
[1:47:09] putting his trust in a false light a
[1:47:12] false light that had a ro map that would
[1:47:15] actually lead to his own naturalizes
[1:47:18] being ruptured out of his skull
[1:47:24] and he would never ever again see
[1:47:26] another
[1:47:27] person the devil thought he had
[1:47:31] him one
[1:47:34] day skipping a whole lot he reached back
[1:47:39] here and no doubt when he was out the
[1:47:42] mill he was
[1:47:44] praying oh god I've been a I've been a
[1:47:48] loser I failed you God
[1:47:53] something was happening his hair was
[1:47:54] starting to grow out his facei was
[1:47:57] starting to he couldn't
[1:47:59] see like that devilish little guy that
[1:48:02] was going along poking him with a real
[1:48:05] mean grin I don't know if you ever seen
[1:48:07] that picture poking him and jabbing him
[1:48:10] to keep moving keep moving
[1:48:13] grind he couldn't even
[1:48:15] see but there's one thing that they
[1:48:17] couldn't take away he was
[1:48:20] elect he'd been a failure yes
[1:48:23] he brought
[1:48:24] disgrace on
[1:48:27] Israel there one thing he still had he
[1:48:29] had his spiritual vision and he seen God
[1:48:33] by
[1:48:34] Revelation oh Lord just once more Lord
[1:48:39] once more our Lord he had a vision that
[1:48:42] the devil couldn't take from
[1:48:46] him and he was victorious in his end
[1:48:58] all kinds of Lights Jesus is a True
[1:49:00] Light he's the only light we are the
[1:49:02] children we're born again we're Children
[1:49:04] of the day the children of the world
[1:49:06] walk in darkness they walk at night time
[1:49:08] they love
[1:49:12] darkness and I go so far as to say the
[1:49:14] religious crowd they love a cloudy
[1:49:18] day cuz it gives them permission that
[1:49:21] they think to do all kinds of things
[1:49:23] that you and I with the light of the
[1:49:25] word would not even want to
[1:49:27] do get married the second
[1:49:33] time lot of lot of things you can list
[1:49:37] [Music]
[1:49:40] them you're born again you're Children
[1:49:42] of the day the children of the world
[1:49:44] walk in darkness they walk at night time
[1:49:45] they love Darkness the Bible said men
[1:49:48] love people love Darkness more than they
[1:49:51] do light because light would manifest
[1:49:54] their
[1:49:54] [Music]
[1:50:03] deeds let the sun come up every old
[1:50:06] lizard every old bug insects of the dark
[1:50:08] kingdom crawls at night will take under
[1:50:11] something that's the same way when the
[1:50:13] Gospel Light begins to shine every evil
[1:50:16] deed will try to crawl under something
[1:50:19] oh they say we got light because we live
[1:50:22] at night time yeah yeah they do got a
[1:50:25] light like I say cats SS can see at
[1:50:29] night dogs can see very well at night
[1:50:32] cuz their eyes are adapted for
[1:50:35] that but they're living in
[1:50:38] darkness and doing things of the dark
[1:50:41] times he said every old every old bug
[1:50:44] insects of the dark kingdom crawls at
[1:50:46] night will take under something that's
[1:50:48] the same way when the Gospel Light
[1:50:49] begins to shine every evil deed try to
[1:50:52] call on or something we got that light
[1:50:55] because we live at nighttime if you walk
[1:50:58] in in the light at night time you're
[1:51:00] walking under a artificial
[1:51:03] light
[1:51:06] [Music]
[1:51:08] wow if you walk in the light at night
[1:51:13] time L it a seea they say we can
[1:51:17] see God said you're blind you're blind
[1:51:21] what makes a blind
[1:51:24] images Easy Living the temptation of
[1:51:27] Easy
[1:51:28] Living slothfulness because of the
[1:51:31] Comforts of the
[1:51:32] flesh Science and
[1:51:36] Technology maybe we ought to go back to
[1:51:39] old bear wooden boards on the
[1:51:42] pews better not go down that
[1:51:46] one he said oh they we got light we live
[1:51:49] at night time if you walk in the light
[1:51:51] at night time you're walking in in under
