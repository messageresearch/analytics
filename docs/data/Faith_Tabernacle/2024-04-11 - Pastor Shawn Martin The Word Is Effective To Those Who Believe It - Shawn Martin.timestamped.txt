[43:29] that it be quickened father even more
[43:33] Lord May there be a pool Lord I I pray
[43:37] father just don't let it just be a a an
[43:39] average service father but Lord may we
[43:43] know that we have been with you let it
[43:46] be an eternal thing Lord that happens
[43:48] within us tonight we ask it in Jesus
[43:51] Christ's name amen and
[43:55] amen um Luke the 1st chapter the 26th
[44:04] verse and in the sixth month the angel
[44:07] Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of
[44:10] Galilee named
[44:12] Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man
[44:16] whose name was Joseph of the House of
[44:18] David and the virgin's name was
[44:21] Mary and the angel came in unto her and
[44:24] said hell th
[44:27] thou that art highly favored the Lord is
[44:30] with thee blessed are thou among me
[44:34] women and when she saw him she was
[44:37] troubled at his saying and cast in her
[44:40] mind what manner of salutation this
[44:42] should be and the angel said unto her
[44:45] fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor
[44:48] with God and behold Thou shalt conceive
[44:52] in thy womb and bring forth a son and
[44:56] shalt call his name name Jesus and he
[44:59] shall be great and shall be called the
[45:01] son of the highest and the Lord God
[45:03] shall give unto him the Throne of his
[45:06] father David and he shall reign over the
[45:09] house of Jacob forever and of his
[45:12] kingdom there shall be no end then said
[45:16] Mary unto the angel how shall this be
[45:19] saying I know not a man and the angel
[45:22] answered and said unto her the Holy
[45:24] Ghost shall come upon thee and power the
[45:29] power of the highest shall overshadow
[45:31] thee therefore also that Holy thing
[45:33] which shall be born of the shall be
[45:35] called The Son of God then if you go to
[45:41] the 38th
[45:43] verse it says and Mary said behold the
[45:47] handmade of the Lord be it unto me
[45:49] according to Thy word and the angel
[45:52] departed from her then if you'll go to
[45:56] the fifth chapter chap same
[45:58] book um and we'll start at the the first
[46:10] verse it says and it came to pass that
[46:12] as the people pressed upon him to hear
[46:14] the word of God he stood by the lake
[46:18] of uh gurat some to that effect and saw
[46:22] two ships standing by the lake but the
[46:26] fishermen were gone out of them and were
[46:29] washing their Nets and he entered into
[46:32] one of the ships which was Simon's and
[46:35] prayed him that he would thrust out a
[46:37] little from the
[46:39] land and he sat down and taught the
[46:41] people out of the ship and when he had
[46:43] left speaking he said unto Simon launch
[46:46] out into the deep and let down your nets
[46:49] for a
[46:51] drought and Simon answered answering
[46:55] said unto him Master we have P all the
[46:58] night and have taken
[47:01] nothing nevertheless everybody say
[47:04] nevertheless at Thy word I will let down
[47:08] the net and when they had uh this done
[47:13] they enclosed a great multitude of
[47:16] fishes and their net break amen you can
[47:21] have your seats this
[47:25] evening praise the Lord Lord if I uh
[47:29] were to maybe use a title it would be
[47:31] the word is effective to those who
[47:33] believe
[47:34] it and you know I've I've I've talked
[47:38] about faith so much and and I guess most
[47:42] ministers do message Believers in one
[47:46] way or another and that is because uh
[47:50] faith in the word of God can never never
[47:53] be uh overemphasized and we're living in
[47:56] an age where our faith is really being
[47:59] challenged uh more than ever before in
[48:02] in my uh uh belief of it and um but we
[48:07] know and and these things you you you
[48:10] already know but just to remind us but
[48:15] that faith in the word of God is the
[48:19] only everybody say is the only
[48:22] ingredient that God requires a man to
[48:25] have it takes Faith to be saved it takes
[48:29] Faith to be healed it takes Faith to be
[48:32] delivered it takes Faith to to even be
[48:35] steadfast and unmovable and we're living
[48:38] in a in a shaking time and it's a
[48:41] falling away just exactly the way the
[48:44] Bible says it but it takes faith not to
[48:46] be in that great falling away it doesn't
[48:49] take great great strength it just takes
[48:52] faith and so it takes Faith to endure
[48:55] the Bible says he that endureth to the
[48:57] end the same shall be saved and and
[48:59] trust me there's there's only a few
[49:01] people that's going to endure and we're
[49:04] we're understanding the more that time
[49:06] terries uh just how few it really is
[49:09] going to be but when it's said and done
[49:12] it's only going to be by faith that
[49:14] they've endured it takes Faith to
[49:17] overcome it takes Faith to call those
[49:19] things that are not as though they were
[49:22] it it it and and and we know we we talk
[49:25] about rapture we talk about the changing
[49:27] of our body but none of that will happen
[49:29] without faith it that's the key thing
[49:32] that everyone will have that goes in the
[49:34] Rapture is faith faith brings about the
[49:38] body change faith is is what changes us
[49:41] from Mortal to
[49:43] immortality and it will take Faith to be
[49:46] caught up to meet the Lord in the air
[49:49] and and so uh um um uh a as human beings
[49:55] uh living in this life we will face
[49:57] challenges I I guarantee you you face
[50:00] challenges today uh or you're facing
[50:03] challenges or you're going to face
[50:05] challenges and and deal with issues in
[50:09] in in your life and we will always have
[50:12] problems I don't care how spiritual we
[50:14] get and how grounded in the word we we
[50:17] become we're going to have problems
[50:20] you're going to deal with issues you're
[50:22] going to we'll have sicknesses that we
[50:24] have to deal with we'll Satan is
[50:27] constantly and will be constantly as
[50:30] long as we're in this body of mortality
[50:33] he's going to be trying to put things
[50:35] upon us and and we're we're we're
[50:38] looking at at time where sicknesses are
[50:41] are becoming more prevalent than ever
[50:44] before doctors don't even know what to
[50:46] do with them uh hospitals insane asylums
[50:49] all these things are filling up like
[50:51] crazy and and and just sickness upon
[50:54] sickness upon sickness upon sickness and
[50:57] and these things and and these things
[50:59] ain't a a figment of our imagination
[51:02] these things are real and yet it's only
[51:05] by faith in the word of God that we can
[51:07] withstand any of this that is that that
[51:10] is here and and it it's it's the only
[51:13] way that we can defeat Satan in every
[51:15] one of his tricks is by faith for even
[51:17] Peter I believe it was uh Peter that
[51:19] said faith is the victory that
[51:21] overcometh the world or this is the
[51:23] victory that overcometh the world even
[51:25] our faith that right and so so the the
[51:29] word of God though is is not just
[51:31] something to be learned it's it's not
[51:34] something that we just come into to a
[51:36] church to the service and then we hear a
[51:39] preaching and or we'll go home and play
[51:42] tape or play it on the car and and all
[51:44] of these things and then we we leave it
[51:47] when the tape is done or when surfice is
[51:49] over we leave we just all leave it you
[51:51] know there and then we go do our own
[51:53] thing it's the word of God is not just
[51:57] something to be used as a conversational
[52:00] piece uh that we all just discuss the
[52:03] end time and we all discuss what
[52:05] knowledge that we have and compare it
[52:07] with other what other people might have
[52:10] or not have as far as biblical knowledge
[52:12] and it's it's it was not written for men
[52:15] to make a career out of it and and and
[52:18] and and many men have made a career off
[52:22] of the word of God and and it's just
[52:24] nothing but a career and and but yet the
[52:27] word of God was given for us to believe
[52:30] it it is meant to be believed it it's
[52:33] got to be believed amen and and you know
[52:36] it it's amazes me uh to see the millions
[52:39] of people who who claim to be Christians
[52:42] and yet not have faith in the word of
[52:45] God that Christianity is built upon you
[52:49] you can't even be a Christian without
[52:51] faith you can't be saved without faith
[52:54] and and yet many people said church and
[52:57] don't have any faith in the word of God
[52:59] whatsoever they'll have more faith in in
[53:02] in their occupation or they'll have more
[53:05] faith in the government they have more
[53:07] faith in the doctors they have more
[53:09] faith in their money and in
[53:11] materialistic things or uh uh then then
[53:15] they they do the word of God and but you
[53:19] faith in money faith in in government
[53:22] faith in in politics faith in whatever
[53:26] it it does not make you a Christian it
[53:28] has to be faith in the word of God can
[53:32] you say Amen now so so uh uh we have
[53:35] seen how people have made Christianity
[53:38] about their good works or about what
[53:40] church they belong to or uh the rules of
[53:43] their church and and they do the same
[53:46] thing about healing amen you know uh if
[53:50] if the doctor gives them a clean bill of
[53:52] health yipp IIA you know uh then then
[53:55] they feel like they're going to make
[53:56] make it or or they'll they'll look for
[53:58] that certain preacher to lay hands upon
[54:01] them then they know that they're going
[54:02] to be okay and and and things like that
[54:06] and and yet yet that's that's not faith
[54:09] faith God never raised up men for us to
[54:12] have have have faith in personalities he
[54:16] he just never did and yet so many people
[54:18] go after the personalities you know
[54:21] brother random said I've seen people
[54:22] shout and praise the Lord and not enough
[54:24] Faith to heal a toothache
[54:26] now you think of that uh uh uh he can
[54:29] shout can dance can roll on the floor
[54:32] can be so professional in music so be so
[54:35] just right in the way they preach and
[54:37] conduct themselves and and can actually
[54:39] be the best tithe payers and can be the
[54:42] most dedicated church people and yet not
[54:44] have faith and and and that's the thing
[54:47] people lack the real ingredients and
[54:49] that is Faith amen and and the house of
[54:52] God or the Christian duties and and the
[54:55] things of Christian is just something
[54:57] that we do we go to work we we go
[54:59] shopping when we need groceries and and
[55:01] we we go to church too you know and it's
[55:04] all that we fit in a schedule see well
[55:07] and and and and that's not way God
[55:09] intended somebody's got to take God at
[55:11] his word come hell or high water sick or
[55:14] sin it doesn't matter the word of God is
[55:18] to be believed ain't that right we've
[55:21] seen people who live clean and moral
[55:23] lives I've seen them you know so
[55:25] legalistic in their teaching and yet
[55:27] they have no faith amen hardly to blow
[55:30] their nose see it it's just they they
[55:32] don't have no faith uh to do anything
[55:35] with but see healing and deliverance and
[55:39] salvation is only effective when we have
[55:42] faith in the word of God if you want to
[55:44] see Power in God then it takes faith if
[55:48] this if this word is ever going to live
[55:51] and we know that is this is the age
[55:53] where every scripture must be fulfilled
[55:56] that is spoken by the bride and it's
[55:58] going to it can only be by faith that we
[56:00] do this it ain't because you believe God
[56:03] sent a prophet it ain't because you go
[56:04] to a message Church it ain't it ain't
[56:07] because you sit under such a a uh maybe
[56:09] go to a dynamic uh uh meeting and and
[56:12] you go to Revival after Revival and
[56:14] youth meeting after youth meeting and
[56:16] and all of that it you know there there
[56:19] it's sadden that that it saddens me that
[56:21] so many people are lacking and they're
[56:23] looking and and and really got the
[56:26] ingredients and that is the word of God
[56:29] all they need is faith faith can you say
[56:32] Amen yes I I believe in Reviving Revival
[56:35] and and I think these meetings are good
[56:37] but when you go to them as as as your
[56:40] pacifier as as though you need you
[56:43] become like the drug addict and the
[56:45] alcoholic they they need something to
[56:47] keep them going they need something to
[56:48] keep them thriving well the only thing
[56:50] that'll keep you going is Faith it it's
[56:53] true can you say amen amen faith Faith
[56:56] keeps that word from being dead to you
[56:58] and keeps it alive amen now the Bible
[57:01] says that all things are possible to
[57:04] them that believe so do you realize that
[57:07] going to the doctor don't guarantee your
[57:09] healing we we'll we'll pay all kinds of
[57:11] stuff nothing wrong with going to
[57:12] doctors mind you but we'll give them all
[57:15] kinds of money and have no guarantee
[57:17] that we're going to get a clean bill of
[57:19] health and even when they do give us
[57:21] medication how do we know that's really
[57:23] going to work but we'll take their we'll
[57:24] take it we'll take it act like
[57:26] everything going to be all right because
[57:27] we're taking their medicine amen but
[57:29] when it comes to the word of God we
[57:31] always question the word of God for some
[57:33] reason but the Bible says all things are
[57:36] possible to them that take their
[57:38] medicine it didn't say that did it all
[57:41] things are possible to them that go to
[57:42] the doctor all things that possible to
[57:45] them that get a clean bill of health
[57:47] from Dr so and so it it ain't that all
[57:50] things are possible to them that believe
[57:53] can you say Amen following a personality
[57:56] doesn't guarantee you that you're going
[57:57] to heaven on and I I'll just be honest
[58:00] setting in a message Church doesn't
[58:01] guarantee you that you're going to
[58:03] heaven if if there's no faith that's
[58:06] right amen prise the Lord can you say
[58:09] Amen see so faith in the word of God is
[58:12] the only guarantee that you
[58:14] have ain't that right amen see so then
[58:18] we find that the authority over every
[58:22] devil in hell lays in the word of God
[58:25] faith in the word of God gives you the
[58:27] authority now when you have faith you
[58:29] don't have to beg God to do nothing for
[58:31] [Music]
[58:33] you can you say amen and when you have
[58:36] faith amen you don't have to beg the beg
[58:38] the devil to leave you
[58:40] alone faith is the authority faith in
[58:43] God's word is the authority the only way
[58:47] that you would be disappointed in God's
[58:49] word is when you ain't got faith in it
[58:51] but I guarantee you a man that has faith
[58:53] in God's word will never be disappointed
[58:56] amen because Faith brings
[58:58] results do you believe that see so then
[59:02] you you you can name any any devil of
[59:05] hell you can name any situation any
[59:08] circumstance and faith in the word of
[59:10] God is the only answer there is not all
[59:13] kinds of answers that fit for every you
[59:16] know that that well I need an answer for
[59:18] this and I need an answer for this and I
[59:20] need an answer for this no there's one
[59:22] answer to every problem and that is the
[59:25] word of God
[59:26] if you'll just believe it can you say
[59:28] amen amen you could be lacking and and
[59:31] in need of physical uh uh uh uh having a
[59:34] physical need you you could have a
[59:36] financial need you could have a
[59:37] spiritual need you could have whatever
[59:40] need that you want and one answer is
[59:42] faith in God God's word and all things
[59:45] are possible to them that believe can
[59:48] you say amen and it's true see so you
[59:51] you remember the blind man who cried out
[59:53] to Jesus and and and stopped uh uh uh
[59:57] Jesus stopped and told his disciples go
[1:00:00] get that man and bring him here well you
[1:00:02] know the the the the prophet said that
[1:00:05] Jesus never heard that man's cry for
[1:00:07] help it was a throne of people and there
[1:00:09] was some that was cursing him and there
[1:00:11] was some that was blessing him and there
[1:00:13] was some that was rejoicing and there
[1:00:15] was some that was that was complaining
[1:00:18] and and and and and uh uh you know uh
[1:00:21] brother raham said there's some of them
[1:00:22] booing and some of them cheering and and
[1:00:25] all these things and and so there was no
[1:00:27] way that Jesus could ever hear that
[1:00:29] Blind Man's cry amen for help but he
[1:00:32] said it was the faith of that blind man
[1:00:34] that stopped Jesus in his tracks ain't
[1:00:37] that right now you you think of that you
[1:00:39] may be around all kinds of nonsense and
[1:00:42] a lot of noise and a lot of things that
[1:00:44] are going on but there's one thing
[1:00:46] that'll get God's attention amen for you
[1:00:49] and that's Faith you got to have faith
[1:00:51] can you say amen that's right see and
[1:00:54] Jesus told the man thy faith Faith have
[1:00:56] saved thee Amen brother BR said you know
[1:00:58] look at it Jesus didn't say well I've
[1:01:00] healed thee so go on your way he said
[1:01:02] thy faith hath made thee whole thy faith
[1:01:05] has healed thee see so so here brother
[1:01:09] brandom says the man had enough Faith to
[1:01:11] in God to pull out of Jesus Christ or to
[1:01:14] stop him in his march to Calvary with
[1:01:17] the burdens of all human beings every
[1:01:20] death that ever died in the world or
[1:01:22] ever would rested upon his decision at
[1:01:24] Calvary and those things oppressing in
[1:01:28] his mind and leading in front of a
[1:01:31] multitude them mocking and making fun of
[1:01:33] him amen and everything and the priest
[1:01:36] hollering at him and sparring with him
[1:01:39] and and him walking right on down that
[1:01:41] same road that Elijah and Elisha come
[1:01:44] down together with their arms around one
[1:01:46] another the same road that Joshua led
[1:01:48] the children of Israel years before up
[1:01:51] them old Stones there as they marched
[1:01:53] around Jericho and the shouted the walls
[1:01:56] fell that same road Jesus Christ the son
[1:01:59] of God going to Calvary immediately to
[1:02:01] be crucified and the faith of that blind
[1:02:04] beggar stopped him in his tracks and he
[1:02:06] turned around and said what would I do
[1:02:08] for you can you say man and he said that
[1:02:11] I might receive my sight and Jesus said
[1:02:13] thy faith is
[1:02:16] sufficient amen thy faith is sufficient
[1:02:20] amen whatever you're needing your faith
[1:02:22] is sufficient can you say Amen the Lord
[1:02:25] faith is sufficient now you know brother
[1:02:28] brandom's goes on to tell us that the
[1:02:30] Man's eyes didn't come open all at once
[1:02:34] amen but as he went believing everybody
[1:02:37] say as he went believing as he went
[1:02:40] believing what Jesus said and praising
[1:02:42] God his eyes came open that's right see
[1:02:47] so then then there is nothing that can
[1:02:50] affect man more than the word of God if
[1:02:54] it is believed and and this is why man
[1:02:57] must live only by the word of God Amen I
[1:03:02] think of and we're very well familiar
[1:03:04] with the scripture here in Matthew 8:5
[1:03:08] and when Jesus was entered into
[1:03:10] Capernaum there came unto him a
[1:03:13] centurion beseeching him and saying Lord
[1:03:15] my servant lith at home sick of py the
[1:03:18] py grievously tormented and Jesus Sith
[1:03:21] unto him I will come and heal him and
[1:03:23] the Centurion answered and said Lord I
[1:03:25] am not worthy that thou should us come
[1:03:27] under my roof but just speak the word
[1:03:30] only and my servant shall be healed for
[1:03:33] I am a man under Authority this man
[1:03:35] recognized the authority that Jesus had
[1:03:38] I'm a man under Authority and and having
[1:03:42] soldiers unto me and I say to this man
[1:03:44] go and he goeth to another come and he
[1:03:46] cometh and to my servant do this and he
[1:03:48] doeth it and when Jesus heard it he
[1:03:51] marveled and said unto the unto them
[1:03:53] that followed verily I say unto you you
[1:03:56] I have not found so great a Faith No not
[1:03:59] in Israel I'll tell you why because it
[1:04:01] was not meant for the Jews it was meant
[1:04:03] for the Gentile that kind of Faith was
[1:04:06] meant to the Gentile just speak the word
[1:04:09] can you say amen that's exactly right
[1:04:12] and here you go in the 13th verse and
[1:04:14] Jesus said to the Ser Centurion go thy
[1:04:17] way and as thou Hast believed it what
[1:04:21] are you believing
[1:04:22] for as thou Hast believed so be it
[1:04:27] undone unto thee and his servant was
[1:04:30] healed in the selfsame hour amen you
[1:04:33] know today we we speak of uh speed just
[1:04:36] thinking of speed and and in terms of
[1:04:38] that and miles per hour and you know
[1:04:42] there's 200 miles an hour it's hard to
[1:04:44] believe that we could go there but we
[1:04:46] even go further than that and faster
[1:04:48] than that you know 10,000 M an hour and
[1:04:52] and all of that and that's that's
[1:04:54] terrific speed but when it comes to
[1:04:56] Eternity you know we we can't even
[1:04:59] fathom the the the type of speed that
[1:05:03] that that that is in that Rim you know
[1:05:07] and and uh we we just can't and and you
[1:05:10] know it's just like after Jesus had been
[1:05:12] glorified and received a glorified body
[1:05:15] he was raised from the dead and he
[1:05:17] ascended up into heaven to the Father
[1:05:20] the prophet said it wasn't just but few
[1:05:22] seconds just a few seconds that he had
[1:05:25] returned turned back amen and uh back to
[1:05:29] Earth amen and showing himself see amen
[1:05:33] and the prophet said he come with such
[1:05:35] terrific speed till he come right
[1:05:37] through a wall and the wall never moved
[1:05:41] and yet he stood there and ate fish and
[1:05:44] bread with his disciples but notice the
[1:05:47] point of this is he the prophet said he
[1:05:49] can come all the way from glory to your
[1:05:52] heart as quick as you can think about
[1:05:54] him now think of that he's not so far
[1:05:57] away from you amen just as quick as you
[1:06:00] can think about him he'll show
[1:06:02] up can you say amen that's right and as
[1:06:06] quick as you can confess wrong he can
[1:06:08] run the devil out and bring himself in
[1:06:11] just as fast as you can have enough
[1:06:13] Faith to believe it can you say Amen
[1:06:15] this ain't an all day process this ain't
[1:06:17] a hundred-year process God is right here
[1:06:21] the moment you can have faith for it and
[1:06:24] believe it he'll show up on the scene
[1:06:27] he's here to walk with you he's here to
[1:06:29] to to to protect you he's here to give
[1:06:32] you every need that you
[1:06:35] have amen that's awes God ain't using
[1:06:39] vehicles to get it down to you FedEx and
[1:06:41] UPS aren't you glad for that he can come
[1:06:44] in a moment's time just a moment you you
[1:06:47] you you you anchor your heart in that
[1:06:50] word and believe it he shows up glory to
[1:06:53] his
[1:06:54] name
[1:06:56] what makes the word of God so
[1:07:00] powerful I think this is as far as I
[1:07:03] know you never hear this in
[1:07:05] anywhere outside the
[1:07:08] message and it's because what makes the
[1:07:11] word powerful is that God is the word
[1:07:14] brother brandom laid that in there so
[1:07:16] much for us he is the word everybody say
[1:07:19] God is the word God is the word and and
[1:07:22] and he is manifested in and through his
[1:07:25] word
[1:07:26] ain't that right don't don't ignore the
[1:07:28] word of God and expect to walk with
[1:07:31] God it's the selfsame thing ain't that
[1:07:35] right and God only moves through his
[1:07:37] word so the prophet said if you want
[1:07:40] deity in your midst then welcome and
[1:07:43] receive the
[1:07:45] word I don't care if you receive the
[1:07:47] doctor's report or not but don't you
[1:07:50] take this gospel don't take the word of
[1:07:52] God and treat it like a doctor's report
[1:07:54] amen if you want deity in your midst
[1:07:58] then receive that word hear that word
[1:08:01] take that word and receive it and
[1:08:03] welcome it and don't ever let anyone or
[1:08:06] anything get between you and that
[1:08:09] [Applause]
[1:08:11] word can you say Amen some might take
[1:08:15] you know talk you out of getting a shot
[1:08:16] a flu shot and they might talk you out
[1:08:19] of doing this and they may talk you out
[1:08:21] of doing that but don't you let anyone
[1:08:23] come between you and this world
[1:08:28] you see to see him in action you must
[1:08:30] believe his word to see God in action
[1:08:33] you must believe his word if you want
[1:08:36] God if you want deity in your midst
[1:08:38] you've got to believe his word welcome
[1:08:40] that word Lord can you say amen
[1:08:44] hallelujah see so you will not see him
[1:08:46] if you are believing in anything outside
[1:08:48] the word of God now this is why again
[1:08:52] this is why it's so important amen uh
[1:08:54] for the seven the angel to come and
[1:08:56] reveal the mysteries of God to tie up
[1:08:58] the Loose Ends amen God was making a way
[1:09:01] to come to
[1:09:02] you reveal himself can you say Amen see
[1:09:07] so then then we understand that the
[1:09:10] seventh angel had to be a prophet
[1:09:12] Vindicated not just because he said he's
[1:09:14] a prophet right many people got this
[1:09:18] idea that they're the
[1:09:20] prophet oh my that God would vindicate
[1:09:22] this man the seventh angel had to be a
[1:09:25] Vindicated Prophet ain't that right and
[1:09:28] and he had to be a prophet because the
[1:09:30] word of the Lord only becomes to a
[1:09:32] prophet see a theologian could not tie
[1:09:34] up them lucians can you say Amen no no
[1:09:38] just no preacher amen could tie up them
[1:09:41] lucans see we we've had theologians
[1:09:44] we've had commentators all throughout
[1:09:46] the ages and they've only made a mess
[1:09:48] out of things can you say Amen that
[1:09:51] that's exactly right see so so then
[1:09:54] we've had men come on the seen who are
[1:09:56] very well vered in the Bible and very
[1:09:59] educated men amen that that that that
[1:10:02] they they could out talk us any day with
[1:10:04] this Bible amen but it didn't mean a
[1:10:07] thing amen it took a prophet and that
[1:10:10] Prophet had to be the sth angel Amen to
[1:10:12] reveal the mystery of this Bible to us
[1:10:15] and reveal tie up the Loose
[1:10:17] Ends can you say amen that's right see
[1:10:21] amen see so then the the the the only
[1:10:24] thing that theologians and commentators
[1:10:26] and whoever else and and and no doubt
[1:10:29] they were they were well-meaning in what
[1:10:31] they were doing but they've only made a
[1:10:32] mess out of things they've only made a
[1:10:34] mess out of the church they've only made
[1:10:36] a mess out and they're still making
[1:10:37] messes out of the church can you say
[1:10:40] Amen they're confusing the people right
[1:10:43] come on now that's exactly right to
[1:10:44] where the people don't know what to
[1:10:46] believe they don't know who to Anchor
[1:10:48] their faith
[1:10:50] in it's true and it's it happens even in
[1:10:53] the messag amen brother Bram said it's
[1:10:56] it's been always each time a group of
[1:10:58] leaders that gets the people all mixed
[1:11:00] up it's not so much the people it's the
[1:11:02] leaders that get them mixed up see so
[1:11:05] people's had enough Faith to say yes
[1:11:08] Jesus that was the son of God he's gone
[1:11:11] way away see and we can see enough to
[1:11:14] believe salvation but you can't believe
[1:11:16] all of it and they sto short see the
[1:11:19] church has been stopping short too long
[1:11:22] right there you go can you say Amen
[1:11:25] every time Through the Ages that God
[1:11:27] would try to bring the church further
[1:11:29] and show it more truth they would stop
[1:11:31] right there become some group of leaders
[1:11:33] of men amen would get the people all
[1:11:36] tangled up in such a mess that they
[1:11:39] couldn't even
[1:11:42] believe and you say
[1:11:45] Amen if they would have stayed with the
[1:11:47] the truth then then people of this age
[1:11:49] would believe that God sent a prophet
[1:11:51] they would believe in Malachi 4 but it's
[1:11:53] the preachers it's the leaders amen
[1:11:55] that's tell that tells the people
[1:11:57] there's no such thing as such that's
[1:11:59] right they would believe in miracles
[1:12:02] they would believe in signs and wonders
[1:12:04] of of scriptural signs and wonders but
[1:12:06] it's the leaders that have got the
[1:12:08] people all messed up can you say amen
[1:12:11] and they stopped short the church has
[1:12:13] been stopping short amen but now notice
[1:12:16] now amen they've done exactly what king
[1:12:19] uh joash did in the Old Testament amen
[1:12:22] remember that uh 2 Kings 13:14 now

[1:12:33] king of Israel came down unto him and
[1:12:35] wept over his face and said oh my father
[1:12:38] my father The Chariot of Israel and the
[1:12:41] horsemen thereof and Elisha said unto
[1:12:43] him take bow and arrows and he took unto
[1:12:46] him bow and arrows and he said to the
[1:12:49] king of Israel put thine hand upon the
[1:12:51] bow and he put his hand upon it and
[1:12:53] Elisha put his hand hands upon the
[1:12:56] king's hands and he said open the window
[1:12:59] Eastward then he opened it and Elisha
[1:13:01] said shoot and he shot and he said the
[1:13:04] Lord now notice the promise the promise
[1:13:07] then the the uh he said the arrow of the
[1:13:10] Lord's deliverance and the arrow of
[1:13:12] deliverance from Syria for Thou shalt
[1:13:15] Smite the syrians in aec uh uh till thou
[1:13:18] Hast consumed them and he said take the
[1:13:22] arrows and he took them and he said to
[1:13:24] the king king of Israel Smite upon the
[1:13:27] ground and he smoked Thrice three times
[1:13:29] he only smoked three times and he stayed
[1:13:32] back ain't that right just the way the
[1:13:34] church has been doing just cutting short
[1:13:36] of it all and the man of God was wroth
[1:13:39] amen angry with him and he said thou
[1:13:42] should have smitten five or six times

[1:13:48] had us consumed it whereas now Thou
[1:13:51] shalt Smite is Syria but Thrice hello

[1:14:05] it he always stopped short of it amen

[1:20:49] back and his message is not just any
[1:20:52] message that has come along but it is
[1:20:54] the the end time message do you believe
[1:20:56] that amen the prophet of Malachi 4 has a
[1:20:59] message and it is the end time message
[1:21:02] for an end time people and the prophet
[1:21:04] says always end time message meets end
[1:21:07] time conditions all the way through the
[1:21:09] scriptures and it will have to do at
[1:21:12] this time a call back to the original
[1:21:15] word how is his message going to meet
[1:21:18] end time conditions by calling us back
[1:21:20] to the original word this is the time
[1:21:23] for Rapture this is the time for a body
[1:21:25] change this is the time for adoption

[1:22:39] in that word
[1:22:41] exactly as God gave it to Paul so w with
[1:22:45] all these naysayers that says well
[1:22:47] brother Bram didn't know the Bible
[1:22:48] brother Bram didn't he just using his
[1:22:50] own opinions and and all that nonsense
[1:22:52] you know what that means they don't
[1:22:54] believe that he was Malachi 4 they don't
[1:22:57] believe it they're make Believers can
[1:22:59] you say amen for a prophet would tell us
[1:23:02] that this prophet of Malachi 4 will not
[1:23:04] deviate from the word of God he'll be in
[1:23:07] that word as Paul was in the word that's
[1:23:10] right he will be in that word exactly as
[1:23:13] God gave it to Paul he won't deviate
[1:23:15] from that word for a moment not by one
[1:23:18] ioda in that last age when there will be
[1:23:22] many everybody say many many false
[1:23:24] prophets
[1:23:26] appearing now he didn't say there would
[1:23:28] be a many elijas no right he didn't say
[1:23:33] behold I'll send you a bunch of Elijah
[1:23:35] the
[1:23:37] prophets come on now but he did say
[1:23:40] there will be many false prophets yes
[1:23:43] amen amen God promised one Prophet One
[1:23:51] messenger and he told us what his
[1:23:53] message would be and that is to restore
[1:23:55] the
[1:23:55] faith take us back to the original
[1:23:59] word can you say amen he says see in
[1:24:02] that last stage when there will be many
[1:24:04] false prophets appearing watch and we
[1:24:06] see how they keep telling you that if
[1:24:09] you don't believe them and what they say
[1:24:11] you'll be lost but when that last day
[1:24:14] Prophet comes on the scene if he is
[1:24:16] truly that Prophet he'll be crying out
[1:24:18] get back to the word or you're lost get
[1:24:21] back to the word or you're lost can you
[1:24:23] say Amen
[1:24:25] God we need faith in the word of God
[1:24:27] Amen we're looking at the end times
[1:24:29] we're looking at the things we ain't got
[1:24:31] time to play around we got to get
[1:24:33] serious about this
[1:24:35] thing do you believe it Hallelujah see
[1:24:38] he won't build up on a private
[1:24:40] Revelation or an interpretation but on
[1:24:43] the word right amen amen so others who
[1:24:46] are not true prophets will build upon
[1:24:49] their private Revelation or
[1:24:51] interpretation now there is no doubt in
[1:24:54] my minded I'm sure it's yours as well
[1:24:56] can can you give me some Bas on this
[1:24:59] someone's messed with that somehow but
[1:25:02] there is no doubt in my mind that
[1:25:04] brother Brandon was the prophet of
[1:25:05] Malachi 4 he was also the messenger of
[1:25:08] Revelations
[1:25:10] 10:7 there is no doubt in my mind that
[1:25:13] the last part of his ministry was that
[1:25:16] of the open book that was brought down
[1:25:18] by the mighty angel of Revelations 10:1
[1:25:21] do you believe that brother brandom
[1:25:23] talks about it and how he tells of going
[1:25:25] up into the canyon sabinaa Canyon I
[1:25:27] believe and and he's up there and and
[1:25:30] early early early in the morning and and
[1:25:32] he's got his hands raised he's asking
[1:25:35] God what what all this constellation of
[1:25:38] seven angels was about and and all that
[1:25:40] and he says he said it must have been a
[1:25:42] vision or whatever but he said all of a
[1:25:44] sudden he felt something in his hand and
[1:25:45] he looked and it was a sword y'all
[1:25:47] remember that I'm not going to go into
[1:25:49] the whole story you all know it well
[1:25:50] enough but the the sword glistened and
[1:25:53] he described the Ivory and all of that
[1:25:55] about that sword and a voice and he said
[1:25:57] I was afraid of knives I'm scared and
[1:26:00] but there was a voice that said don't be
[1:26:01] scared don't be afraid this is the king
[1:26:05] sword right and he thought well if it
[1:26:07] said a king sword then that might have
[1:26:09] been different but he said but this is
[1:26:11] the king sword a ain't that right and he
[1:26:15] said there's only one the king and
[1:26:17] that's God and his sword is this sharp
[1:26:20] is this sharper than two edges sword
[1:26:23] ain't that right and and so he goes on
[1:26:25] down about this sword he says see see he
[1:26:28] says there's one thing that I understand
[1:26:30] uh uh about it is the principle of do he
[1:26:33] said well here it is he said I don't
[1:26:36] understand one word of it but one
[1:26:37] principle of dueling but the best of my
[1:26:40] understanding the knife striking AC
[1:26:41] cross and then finally the swords if
[1:26:43] they lock the enemy and you lock swords
[1:26:46] then it takes the strength everybody say
[1:26:49] it takes the strength of the man dueling
[1:26:52] because his sword would be pointed at to
[1:26:54] my heart and mine to his and they're
[1:26:56] locked and as our knives striking each
[1:26:58] other then they strike see uh uh and
[1:27:01] then the swords come together and the
[1:27:03] one that can shove the other one down
[1:27:07] swords see the sword straight to the
[1:27:09] heart so it takes even though the sword
[1:27:12] be the word it takes the hand of strong
[1:27:17] faith strong faith can you say Amen oh
[1:27:22] yes sir takes the hand of strong Faith
[1:27:24] to hold it there to bring it to the
[1:27:26] heart of the enemy amen oh my amen so
[1:27:31] you you you know where we're getting at
[1:27:33] right the brides got the strong hand now
[1:27:35] brother Brandon had a strong hand of
[1:27:37] Faith every time he walked out in that
[1:27:39] Pulpit it was by his faith he knew God
[1:27:42] would honor his word he he always
[1:27:44] defeated every night he defeated the
[1:27:46] Devil by the word of
[1:27:48] God ain't that right now now notice uh
[1:27:54] this may be a little lengthy but brother
[1:27:56] Ram talks about the symphony and he
[1:27:58] talked about the Russian composer and uh
[1:28:01] the one who composed Peter and the Wolf
[1:28:03] and he said the symphony acts out on
[1:28:05] symbols and everything and and you you
[1:28:07] all heard him talk about it but he said
[1:28:09] anyone who knows the story that's
[1:28:12] reading it off of a paper and can hear
[1:28:14] that Symphony how it's acting that out
[1:28:16] the drama playing it out then they know
[1:28:19] every change see and they can look at it
[1:28:22] here and see the change but now see so
[1:28:25] what happens if the composer writes
[1:28:27] something and we find out it isn't just
[1:28:30] acted outright see well then we find out
[1:28:33] then that there is something that
[1:28:35] happens there is something lacking and
[1:28:38] we see them uh he who composed it has
[1:28:41] made it up wrote it out and then the
[1:28:44] symphony is playing it and hits a wrong
[1:28:46] note well there's something wrong the
[1:28:48] director gave the wrong motion right he
[1:28:51] said well that's what's the matter today
[1:28:53] my Lutheran Brethren Baptist Brethren
[1:28:55] Pentecostal Brethren all my brethren
[1:28:58] from all different denominations that's
[1:29:00] what it is you're trying to give a note
[1:29:02] that hit back in the days of Luther or
[1:29:04] Wesley and like that see when actually
[1:29:07] the music sheet here shows that it's
[1:29:10] another day we can't live in the light
[1:29:13] of Luther he was a reformer we
[1:29:14] appreciate his part but he's played that
[1:29:17] out we're over here at the back of the
[1:29:20] book now we can't play it out like that
[1:29:23] amen see he says the only way that
[1:29:25] you're ever going to be able to do it my
[1:29:27] brethren is this the Brethren of the
[1:29:29] world of the different parts of the
[1:29:30] world I might say there's only one way
[1:29:32] for that director to do he said he has
[1:29:35] to get in the same spirit that the
[1:29:37] composer was in then he's got it can you
[1:29:41] say Amen now I I have to tell you that
[1:29:43] the our Prophet did not come in a church
[1:29:45] Spirit he did not come in a world Spirit
[1:29:48] he did not come amen with the religious
[1:29:51] spirit he come in the spirit of the
[1:29:57] composer and when the church the
[1:29:58] symphony itself where the world is a
[1:30:00] watching for these signs and wonders
[1:30:02] when the church and the composer and the
[1:30:03] director they all get in the spirit of
[1:30:06] the composer then when they say the days
[1:30:09] of Miracles is past well it don't hit
[1:30:11] the right note but when it gets in the
[1:30:13] right swing of it and the right Spirit
[1:30:16] of it how are you going to do it until
[1:30:18] the spirit comes down of the composer
[1:30:21] can you say amen hallelujah you love him
[1:30:25] he says see then when you say the days
[1:30:26] of Miracles never pass the symphony
[1:30:30] Cries Out
[1:30:32] amen see when we hit and say Jesus
[1:30:35] Christ the same yesterday to every today
[1:30:37] and forever the symphony Cries Out amen
[1:30:41] you shall receive power after this the
[1:30:43] Holy Ghost has come upon you and the
[1:30:44] symphony Cries Out amen I got it ain't
[1:30:48] that right well there's no more
[1:30:50] guesswork about it the whole symphony is
[1:30:53] Right In harmony with the
[1:30:57] word aren't you glad for that aren't you
[1:30:59] glad for the mighty angel coming down oh
[1:31:03] hallelujah amen the composer himself
[1:31:06] amen the spirit of that composer amen
[1:31:08] has gotten upon the director and is upon
[1:31:10] the
[1:31:12] symphony amen yes sir the prophet and
[1:31:14] the spirit and the bride are saying the
[1:31:17] same
[1:31:18] thing yes sir amen they just believe the
[1:31:22] word see so so he said it's a magn
[1:31:26] magnificent thing the director the
[1:31:28] composer must be in the same spirit and
[1:31:30] so must the musicians be in the same
[1:31:32] Spirit to act it all out and the world
[1:31:34] is wondering what's going on see the
[1:31:38] communism they talk about and made me
[1:31:39] sick with it and all this inter in inte
[1:31:44] integration and everything else and
[1:31:46] segregation oh mercy such all this
[1:31:48] nonsense when the coming of the Lord is
[1:31:50] at hand there is something hitting wrong
[1:31:52] they're they're talking about this and
[1:31:54] talking about this and they're all
[1:31:55] talking about everything else but but
[1:31:56] what is God is
[1:31:59] doing it's because they don't believe
[1:32:01] the word they believe their Creeds they
[1:32:02] believe everything else but the word
[1:32:05] amen it's true he said see they're
[1:32:08] they're they're hitting something wrong
[1:32:10] and I'm afraid that the directors have
[1:32:11] gotten out of the spirit of of the
[1:32:14] composer but when when we get that
[1:32:16] composer spirit that original power of
[1:32:19] God that the the Bible said men of old
[1:32:22] was moved by the ghost to write this
[1:32:25] Bible you'll see them two Chinese pieces
[1:32:28] of paper will come together just like
[1:32:30] God's Bible and the believer will come
[1:32:32] together because they're both in the
[1:32:34] same
[1:32:36] Spirit they're both the same thing they
[1:32:38] dovetail right straight together and
[1:32:41] what we need today is directors that's
[1:32:43] right back to the word back and believe
[1:32:46] it just as it said then you see the God
[1:32:49] himself that's the
[1:32:52] unveiling can you say say amen amen oh
[1:32:55] do you love him amen now we know that
[1:32:58] there are two Spirits at work that's
[1:33:00] something we we know we wouldn't have
[1:33:02] known that if it wasn't for this message
[1:33:05] thank God for the message of the hour we
[1:33:08] wouldn't know what was happening all
[1:33:11] around the prophet said there's two
[1:33:14] Spirits at work today the Holy Spirit
[1:33:16] and the devil Spirit and the devil is
[1:33:18] working in deception and the people of
[1:33:21] the Earth are now right now and maybe
[1:33:25] they've already made their choice but he
[1:33:27] said they're making their choice
[1:33:30] now he said that years ago yeah they
[1:33:34] they're making their choice now notice
[1:33:36] the Holy Spirit he is here calling out a
[1:33:38] bride for Christ and and she as Ruth did
[1:33:43] makes her
[1:33:44] choice yes sir I'll go the word only
[1:33:48] I'll
[1:33:49] go that's that's the bridegroom that's
[1:33:52] what she's married to is the word amen
[1:33:55] can you say Amen I'll
[1:33:57] go yep and how is he calling out his
[1:34:00] bride he is doing it by vindicating his
[1:34:03] Word of Promise to her for this age
[1:34:05] showing that it is
[1:34:06] Christ amen so if the finger is supposed
[1:34:10] to move in this age the finger will move
[1:34:12] if the foot is supposed to move in this
[1:34:13] age the foot will move if the eye is to
[1:34:15] see in this age the eye will see see the
[1:34:18] spirit of God as it's growed into the
[1:34:20] full stature of God is the age that
[1:34:22] we're living in now see and the Holy
[1:34:25] Spirit is here vindicating the message
[1:34:27] of the hour the holy spirit is doing
[1:34:29] this so that the people that believe God
[1:34:32] will be called out of this
[1:34:35] chaos I hope you understand am you see
[1:34:38] why you got to believe it got to believe
[1:34:40] it yes sir the only way to be called out
[1:34:43] of this chaos that's right amen thank
[1:34:47] God but notice he said the devil's
[1:34:49] Unholy spirit is here calling his church
[1:34:51] by the
[1:34:52] error as usual by a perversion of the
[1:34:56] word of God like he did at the beginning
[1:34:58] and who's following it every deceived
[1:35:02] individual but the elect will not be
[1:35:06] deceived it ain't
[1:35:08] happening we're living in a generation
[1:35:11] as we get ready
[1:35:12] close but let me talk now that we're
[1:35:16] living in a generation of sign
[1:35:19] Seekers
[1:35:22] true
[1:35:24] and the the thing that has created this
[1:35:27] is thousands of sign workers the prophet
[1:35:30] said he said they know nothing about the
[1:35:32] true move of God and his word in the
[1:35:35] last days give them blood and oil and
[1:35:39] fleshly demonstrations on the platform
[1:35:41] and they'll support it whether it's
[1:35:43] God's word or not whether it's
[1:35:45] scriptural or not they don't care
[1:35:48] yeah because they're sign
[1:35:51] Seekers brother Bri said the only way
[1:35:54] you can tell who they are is give them a
[1:35:56] word test word test ain't that right
[1:35:59] speak the word and see what they have to
[1:36:01] say about it if they don't believe the
[1:36:03] word then they have no GC germ in them
[1:36:07] ain't that right I thought a saddening
[1:36:09] thing um you know uh about this
[1:36:13] Eclipse that happened Monday and how I I
[1:36:17] I I've wondered if um if the world has
[1:36:21] gone as crazy as they did this
[1:36:24] time
[1:36:26] as thinking this was a sign of some
[1:36:32] significance and and of of course there
[1:36:35] was so much confusion opinions and
[1:36:37] speculation as to what it was all about
[1:36:40] right everybody giving their opinion and
[1:36:43] idea saying it was you know the end of
[1:36:45] the world saying the Rapture you know
[1:36:49] asking if there was any churches to be
[1:36:51] open so they could go in and pray
[1:36:55] my goodness good you know could could
[1:36:57] you imagine God sending a
[1:36:59] sign like
[1:37:02] that
[1:37:04] and poor mortal man having
[1:37:08] to depend on that for his eternal
[1:37:13] destination and then God not give a
[1:37:15] clear answer to what it's
[1:37:19] about God doesn't do them
[1:37:22] things I'm not going to going to say
[1:37:23] that it didn't have any significance
[1:37:25] anything that happens I think is with
[1:37:27] significance that's right but there was
[1:37:30] no profit on the earth to give the
[1:37:31] interpretation of its significance
[1:37:34] that's right and it it had no meaning
[1:37:36] for the bride praise the Lord it it
[1:37:39] didn't let us know that we're at the end
[1:37:41] time it didn't let us know that the
[1:37:44] Rapture is about to take
[1:37:46] place uh it didn't draw us it wasn't
[1:37:48] there to draw us closer to God it wasn't
[1:37:52] there to get us more ready it wasn't
[1:37:54] there to give us more
[1:37:55] faith uh uh it it wasn't there you
[1:37:59] understand uh and and so whatever
[1:38:02] significance it might have been it it it
[1:38:04] wasn't there to give us rapturing Faith
[1:38:07] or anything like that because we know uh
[1:38:10] by the message of the hour and again
[1:38:12] this is where people just you know and
[1:38:14] it's a shame on message people that
[1:38:16] that's just it just shows how ignorant
[1:38:18] they are of the of the word of God and
[1:38:20] the lack of faith in the message of the
[1:38:22] hour but but there's only one sign that
[1:38:25] was promised of this generation that
[1:38:28] Jesus promised to give us and that was
[1:38:31] the sign of Jonas being raised from the
[1:38:33] belly of the well and that was the sign
[1:38:36] of the Resurrection there was one sign
[1:38:38] given to this generation that every
[1:38:41] person the whole world should have taken
[1:38:44] notice of and looked for that sign can
[1:38:47] you say Amen other signs yes there there
[1:38:49] was other things but one particular sign
[1:38:53] that that was was above everything one
[1:38:54] sign that would matter amen and it would
[1:38:57] it would determine men's Destiny was
[1:39:00] that one sign whether they rejected it
[1:39:02] or received
[1:39:06] it on now and that was the sign of the
[1:39:09] Messiah sign of Resurrection sign of the
[1:39:12] Messiah and we've seen that sign
[1:39:14] performed night after night after night
[1:39:16] after night after n seven times around
[1:39:19] the
[1:39:21] world and the sign that matter no one
[1:39:24] asks about
[1:39:29] it it was the son of man being revealed
[1:39:32] yes sir can you say amen and that one
[1:39:36] sign that Jesus plainly said would come
[1:39:38] and that he would send it and would be
[1:39:41] he himself being
[1:39:43] revealed and the world rejects
[1:39:46] it they'll take any other sign
[1:39:50] right right come on now
[1:39:54] brother brandham said what what do we
[1:39:57] have in this our day multitudes are
[1:40:00] working signs until we have a generation
[1:40:02] of sign Seekers that know little or
[1:40:05] nothing about the word or a true move of
[1:40:07] the spirit of God if they see blood oil
[1:40:09] and fire they are happy and it matters
[1:40:12] not what is in the word they'll support
[1:40:15] any sign even UNS scriptural ones can
[1:40:19] you say amen and the prophet said this
[1:40:21] is why you cannot claim that manifest
[1:40:23] ation is the evidence of being Holy
[1:40:25] Ghost
[1:40:27] filled can you say amen he said we know
[1:40:30] that true manifestation is the evidence
[1:40:32] of the Holy Ghost doing Mighty
[1:40:35] acts but it is not the evidence of a man
[1:40:38] being filled with the spirit even if
[1:40:40] that individual has abundance of
[1:40:45] manifestations he said the evidence of
[1:40:47] receiving the Holy Ghost today is just
[1:40:49] the same as it was back in the day of
[1:40:51] Our Lord it is
[1:40:53] receiving the word of
[1:40:55] Truth for the day in which you live
[1:40:59] Jesus never did stress the importance of
[1:41:02] works as he did the word he knew that if
[1:41:06] the people got to the word The Works
[1:41:08] will
[1:41:09] follow can you say Amen you love the
[1:41:12] Lord he says here that Satan will try to
[1:41:14] deceive the Bride of this last day by
[1:41:16] trying to get her to hybridize herself
[1:41:19] through Creeds or just plainly turning
[1:41:21] from the word to any sign that suits her
[1:41:25] yeah sad message people go that way just
[1:41:28] as much but God never placed signs ahead
[1:41:31] of the word that's right God never plac
[1:41:33] signs ahead of the word amen can you say
[1:41:36] amen God never plac signs of ahead if
[1:41:39] this message ain't going to draw you
[1:41:40] close some in Eclipse ain't going to
[1:41:42] draw you close if this message ain't
[1:41:45] going to wake you up the eclipse ain't
[1:41:47] going to do it and no other sign is
[1:41:49] going to do
[1:41:51] it it's the Awakening of the bride what
[1:41:54] is it the message of the
[1:41:56] [Music]
[1:41:57] hour taking her back to the original
[1:42:01] word you love him I hope I'm making
[1:42:05] sense to you God never plac signs ahead
[1:42:08] of the word follow signs follow the word
[1:42:11] that's right as when Elijah told the
[1:42:13] woman to bake a cake for him first
[1:42:15] according to the word of the Lord when
[1:42:17] she did as the word said the proper sign
[1:42:20] came come to the word first and then
[1:42:22] watch the miracle
[1:42:23] can you say amen and church put the word
[1:42:27] first we've got the word we're not
[1:42:30] looking for another Prophet to come
[1:42:31] we're not looking for the seventh seal
[1:42:33] to be open we're not we're not looking
[1:42:35] for anything we've got
[1:42:37] it thank Jes and even if there were
[1:42:41] something to come take what you
[1:42:44] got you got enough to create
[1:42:47] worlds you got enough for rapturing
[1:42:50] Faith you got enough to take a body
[1:42:53] change and be caught up to meet the Lord
[1:42:55] in the air can you say Amen brother
[1:42:58] brandham says if the as the musicians
[1:43:00] will
[1:43:01] come he said I believe we're now at the
[1:43:04] time that the word should have
[1:43:06] preeminence amen I believe we're now at
[1:43:10] the time where the word should have
[1:43:13] preeminence personalities have had the
[1:43:16] preeminence the world has had
[1:43:18] preeminence our own ideas have had
[1:43:20] preeminence long enough the word must
[1:43:23] have
[1:43:24] preeminence I believe that the time to
[1:43:26] lay aside our Creeds and our thoughts
[1:43:28] and come back to the word is now he said
[1:43:32] Mary never waited for anything else she
[1:43:35] got the word of God in her heart and she
[1:43:38] was going around testifying that she was
[1:43:40] going to have a baby before she had any
[1:43:42] evidence of it or not can you say Amen

[1:52:03] couple quotes brother brandom said all
[1:52:06] of you in here that's saved tonight you
[1:52:09] just get in your head that you're not
[1:52:11] saved and go around saying I'm not saved
[1:52:13] no more he said then you're not saved he
[1:52:16] said that's a big word for a Baptist
[1:52:18] isn't it but that's true he said your
[1:52:20] backslid whenever you do that
[1:52:23] but here's a a a a word and we know it
[1:52:26] but I I want to just encourage you with
[1:52:29] that brother brandham talking about how
[1:52:33] that you know he he said here he said
[1:52:37] um uh he talking about Christ he says
[1:52:40] Christ took all the legalism upon
[1:52:42] himself he took the law upon himself and
[1:52:45] the law nailed him to the cross of what
[1:52:48] we must do and must not do and must do
[1:52:50] and must not do he said to today we
[1:52:52] don't treat the sinner like Paul did the
[1:52:54] Philippian jeller when he asked what
[1:52:57] must I do to be saved he said we tell
[1:52:59] them what they must quit doing he said
[1:53:02] but he didn't ask what he must quit
[1:53:03] doing he asked what he must what must I
[1:53:06] do to be saved and Paul told him believe
[1:53:10] everybody say believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:53:13] Christ not come join our congregation
[1:53:17] and stand up before the church and say
[1:53:19] this and we'll sprinkle you or immerse
[1:53:22] you or whatever you want to do our way
[1:53:25] he said and if you're not in our church
[1:53:27] well then he said no that wasn't it he
[1:53:29] said just believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:53:32] Christ and thou and thy house everybody
[1:53:35] say my house my house shall be saved is
[1:53:41] that not a
[1:53:43] promise then all you're required to do
[1:53:45] is to believe it he said see if you can
[1:53:49] believe for yourself then you can
[1:53:51] believe everybody say say I can believe
[1:53:53] for your house also have enough faith in
[1:53:57] God to believe for yourself then believe
[1:53:59] for your children also and that same
[1:54:03] faith will save your children that saved
[1:54:05] you if you just keep praying God will
[1:54:08] answer prayer don't you
[1:54:12] worry hello a me what he telling us
[1:54:15] don't you worry see he said just ask him
[1:54:19] and believe it and get it anchored in
[1:54:22] your heart and just keep moving on
[1:54:25] that's the way it's done aren't you glad
[1:54:29] for that oh lift your hands unto the
[1:54:32] Lord hallelujah aren't you glad that God
[1:54:35] sent a prophet to tell us how to do
[1:54:37] these things claim your children claim
[1:54:40] if you've got the faith for yourself
[1:54:42] claim them and just keep moving on keep
[1:54:46] moving on keep praising God that's the
[1:54:49] way it's done ain't that right one more
[1:54:51] he said now Paul said that the word came
[1:54:53] in power as well as voice the word
[1:54:56] priest actually demonstrated itself like
[1:55:00] a flaming cutting sword it went to the
[1:55:03] consciences of men like a surgeon's
[1:55:06] knife and it cut out the diseases and
[1:55:08] set captives free everywhere those early
[1:55:11] Believers went they went preaching the
[1:55:13] gospel the word and God confirmed that
