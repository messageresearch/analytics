while you're turning I just want to announce brother Jonathan Martin uh is uh will be ministering for us so Martin March 16th on Sunday and so um we want to keep that in mind and then um uh brother Jonas hilderbrand I don't know if you know him or not his dad is a pastor in Canada uh brother Kelly Hil debrandt but brother Jonas uh will be um ministering for us on March the 22nd and 23rd so that's going to be on a Saturday evening and Sunday morning um but we'll be announcing that but um March 22nd and 23rd brother Jonas hilderbrandt uh ministering and then um we'll be setting up uh the tent uh the Lord willing on April 14th which uh will be on a Monday and so um uh they they wouldn't let us set it up any earlier and so um if any of you brothers would like to um we would uh uh be happy to have you amen and uh be able to put that up and uh looking forward to a wonderful time in the Lord and and um got uh several folks interested in coming and uh and to the meeting and so above all I ask that you just pray for the the meeting that God will just move in a mighty way and uh we we certainly need him and uh we we know that we're in the the last seconds of time might be even that last second of time but um uh so we want to do all that we can for the Lord amen to help somebody along the way amen uh before go into the word may we just bow our heads and and talk to our Lord father so glad that we could call you father Lord we're not estranged from you Lord we're not just approaching you as a beggar a stranger but we're your children and father we know that anything that you have belongs to to us we don't have to cringe when we ask you of anything but as you have invited us to come boldly before the throne of grace to find help in time of need and Lord that's just the way you are and Lord we accept it whether we feel worthy of it Lord or not it it's it's by your grace and Lord we just believe in your pardoning grace and we would ask Lord upon this basis that you would come and minister to us this morning Father you know every need that is present and Lord I am helpless to meet them needs but father you know how to meet them and you can meet it in a moment's time and we ask that you would do so father as your word Goes Forth it is creative word and may your people rest upon that father and Believe on it and may when we leave this place Lord we would be drawn closer to you is our prayer and may you have the Liberty now Lord to minister Among Us I pray your anointing be upon me father and help me to yield myself to you and may your anointing be upon the people may your spirit go forth as the word as the word is delivered we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen amen uh we want to look at 1 Thessalonians the 4th chapter and I find that this is very um appropriate for the our time that we're living in but it says furthermore then we beseech you Brethren and exhort you by the Lord Jesus that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God so you would abound more and more for you know what Commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus for this is the will of God even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication and that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor then if you'll turn with me to uh the book of Ephesians um the fifth chapter the book of Ephesians chapter 5 and I want to just read the first two verses Ephesians chapter 5 and one be ye therefore followers of God as dear children and walk in love everybody say walk in love as Christ also hath loved us and ha given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling Savor amen you can have your seats this morning and I again want to use the title uh walk pleasing unto him you know there is an expectation that God has for us in this this day and uh as we've quoted the scripture there in Jeremiah 29:11 God spoke through the prophet and saying I know the thoughts that I think toward you sayith the Lord thoughts of Peace not of evil to give you an expected in so then that means as as uh belonging to God we're we're not just floating around in life and we should never have that attitude we should never have that just happy gol Lucky in in the sense I mean we should always be joyful and happy but not without purpose and we we should never treat our lives uh on a daily basis we should never just treat it like you know we just live life and and we're not accountable to anything or we have no goal but God has a goal every morning that you wake up amen God looks at you with purpose and uh and and this day that he put us in is for a purpose we all have a purpose and so God has allotted his word to each age as we know and so uh God expects that word to be fulfilled by a a a predestinated group of people to that age so we have been predestinated to the age that we're living in to fulfill the word that he has allotted amen uh to this age so we are to become the word now we would not know these things if it was not for a prophet but we understand now what God is is after is that we become the word for we are the word bride amen we do not become bride manifestation of bride by joining a church or uh conforming to some Doctrine or a Baptist Doctrine Pentecostal or whatever we we are word bride uh because we're manifesting the very word that God has promised or alloted for the day that we're living in and so brother brandom said what is that word bride it's the manifestation of this hour the bride see not a Creed or a denomination but a living Oracle of God everybody say living Oracle of God see a living attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the Bride so all the attributes of God are being displayed in the formation of the Bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're living in amen see so I looked up this word Oracle it it is it means a person through whom a deity is believed to speak uh an utterance of God Amen so so here the prophet said we're living Oracles of God so which means that we are a vessel which God speaks through his word is spoken through ain't that right just like we believe that the prophet brother brandom was a Oracle of God Amen and what he spoke was thus sayth the Lord we we believe that as as he would say you know I am God's voice to you and he he said I you know I I I I felt like I might have offended you or something you know and and and you all know that I guess the quote but and and but then he says uh but I am God's voice to you he said that time it repeated it you know and and so um uh so brother Brandon was a a a a living Oracle of God uh uh God's voice but we I believe are Oracles of God the voice of God did not stop when brother Brandon was taken off the Earth but notice we are lived voices everybody say lived voices we're we're lived voices see so we're living Oracles of God and and the Thunder of God thundering out that that brother brandham spoke of remember he says Oh how we need in Jeffersonville thousands of lived voices we need that here we need that around the world thousands of lived voices the Thunder of God thundering out notice in sweetness and Holiness and Purity undefiled lives walking around in the Earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians everybody say real Christians amen he says and that's the Thunder against the enemy see the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how how much you can jump or how much you can do this or Shout but What Hurts The Devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything and yet he's just as sweet as can be and move right on now he says oh my that throws him away that's the Thunder that shakes the devil ain't that right but see we're we're not just average person we're not just the average uh uh uh guy here on this Earth we are Sons and Daughters of God can you say Amen so we don't look at the message as impossible and how can I do that and and oh my no we're Sons and Daughters of God Amen see there's something in us and as we talked uh uh the other day you know uh uh we are made after his kind amen God made us after his own kind ain't that right so in in the natural we are in the genes of our father were in the genes of our father see even when he was a young boy uh uh uh brother Matthew you were you were in your father then see just waiting to be expressed Prophet said your father couldn't have fellowship with you because he didn't know you you wasn't expressed yet amen but yet you were there see and he says but then through the bedding grounds of a mother you were brought forth into the Earth and become in the image of your father then he could fellowship with you ain't that right then he could fellowship with you he said and so were you Sons and Daughters of God before there were even a moon a star a molecule you were Sons and Daughters of God for you are only the physical manifestation of the attributes that was in God at the beginning see he says there's only one form of eternal life and that was you before see and he says you don't know nothing about it neither did you know when you was in your Earthly father but you are manifested too In His Image so in the image of God you are made you were manifested for the glory and fellowship of God ain't that right see so we are a people that have been delivered as the Bible says we've been delivered out of Darkness amen into his uh uh or from the power of darkness and translated into the kingdom of his dear son amen Peter says we've escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust amen and have been made partakers of his divine nature amen see amen so so that what a blessing that is so if we are made partaker of his divine nature then it shows that we were a gene seed of God before the foundation of the world so there is a special relationship that we have with God we don't look at him as just God setting up in the heaven waiting to Amen to to blow fire down and and consume us you'll never know the wrath of God never never God May correct you but you'll never know the wrath of God Amen like the world is under because you are part of your father amen God is just not a god he's your father amen and You're Made In His Image you're made just like him so as brother brand would call him papa papa God ain't that right and and so then we are now the prophet said an expression of the attributes of his thoughts before the foundation of the world so we know we started as a thought of God in God was his thoughts and that's us amen he thought of you today he thought of uh uh what you would be he never thought of you as a sinner never never thought of you as a low life he never that's something that the devil thought of you and and made you to be that in God's mind he saw you as a son he saw you perfect he saw you holy he saw you righteous he saw you capable he saw you as a conqueror he saw you as Victorious now we are becoming that expression of a thought amen our life has been changed from low life to a Son of God Amen we live defeated but now we're Victorious we we were slaves to the devil but now we're free amen and we're now coming to the expression of what God thought us to be before the foundation of the world ain't that right amen see so brother brandom said his thoughts is the Christian of today God's thoughts if you want to know God's thoughts today look at the Christian I'm talking about real Christian of today that's God's thoughts because a Christian is an expression of the thoughts that God thought before the foundation of the world Amen so what a what a day that we're living in to be able to see the scriptures fulfilled ain't that right amen just like this uh Psalms 10216 when the Lord shall build up Zion he shall appear in his glory when the Lord shall build up Zion amen now that was written in the Old Testament thousands of years ago but it was a prophetic of today that the Lord would build his church and when he gets her built he would appear in his glory amen see it's not a different Christ that will appear amen or that has appeared we could say it that way for Jesus said at that day you shall know that I am in my father and I am in you can you say man you in me and I in you so what what is this it's time for the manifestation of the sons of God you manifested the world long enough you manifested the attributes of your first birth long enough but now it's time for the manifestation of the thoughts of God which are the sons and daughters of God that's where we're living at this is the day that we're living in no other time outside this time has it been the time to manifest sons of God that's what a prophet said amen even what what they done in the book of Acts was great but no greater time is it in this age Amen to be manifested as sons of God Amen this is the time so the manifestation of the sons of God what is it son of man revealed do you believe that son of man revealed we saw the son of man revealed in a prophet amen a redeemed son amen which was the first fruits amen of the of the other fruit coming up and now I am looking look at a the son of man being revealed in a a the whole body of Christ not just one member amen but the entire body the manifestation of sons of God Amen so what is it it's showing forth Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever we're the one that's declaring through the manifestation that he's not a different Jesus Christ but what he was back then he still here today doing the same things the same Works he's the same in power he's the same in in attitude he's the same in Holiness he's the same in every aspect amen outside of the Corporal body because now he doesn't need his Corporal body to come and and be upon the Earth and dwell among men he's got his mystical body his bride body and she is him can you say amen amen that's exactly what was in God's mind uh uh from the beginning of the world so Hebrews 138 which was the theme of brother bram's uh uh uh uh uh Ministry was Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so when Jesus of yesterday if we could say it that way 2,000 years ago what was he then amen when he walked the Earth he manifested God Amen he didn't manifest the church he didn't manifest the doctrine he didn't glorify himself he manifested God Amen what was it see the prophet said what the father was he manifested himself in the son what the father's was everything the father was was manifested in the son amen the father dwelt in The Son which the son was the Tabernacle of God how many believes that amen he he he was the Tabernacle of God this is why Jesus said when you see me you see the father amen but I'm looking at Tabernacles of God in this age amen see so Jesus proved that he had all the qualities of God in him see he was what God is he was what God is he lived like God he acted like God he spoke like God he did the works of God he loved like God he cared like God he expressed the power of God the very same power amen that created the world was the same power that was expressed in Jesus Christ not a different God not a different power but the same power can you say amen that's right amen the Bible called him the expressed image of God Amen the prophet said see he was God expressing himself in man to man amen Jesus Christ see was God expressing himself in man to man amen another place and I got a lot of quotes but he says there was no other character anywhere that could that could have produced such a person as Jesus Christ but God himself how many believes that amen and I say it today there's no other person that could express the character of Jesus Christ in this age but God himself do you believe that amen that's why it has to be God in you the same God that was in Christ now must be in you Amen to produce the very same character that was produced amen 2,000 years ago now the prophet speaking of Christ says he was God's manifestation of love power and deity and everything was in him ain't that right now did you know that Jesus just didn't happen to appear on the Earth but he was sent amen amen that's what he said the father had sent him amen that's right he was sent to Earth the father sent him now why was he sent John 3:16 it says for God so loved the world how many's glad for that God so loved the world that he gave or we could say he sent his only begotten son that who whoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved can you say Amen so God so loved amen the world that he wanted the world to be saved therefore he sent Christ amen into the world so the Bible also says that God anointed uh Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for God was with him God not only sent him God was with him and how did God send him how was God with him God was in him can you say amen God was in him and Jesus said as the father sent me so send I you amen he ain't sending you in This World by yourself amen but the prophet would declare deity is not in heaven deity is in you which shows as the father had sent him so has he sent us amen by being in us now God so loved well then who was it that God really loved amen the prophet said he loved the unlovely he loved the ungodly can you say amen and he didn't just love a certain color of people or a certain nationality of people amen see but the Bible would say here in Revelations 5:9 thou H has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and Nation God so loved the world Amen it doesn't matter if they speak English or not God loves them amen and there's going to be people from all over this world whether it's black or whether it's brown whether it's uh yellow white whatever there is going to be a bride that come out from the world that God so loved can you sayen God so loved that It produced The Savior to the world he so loved that It produced that love produced a remedy for sin God so loved that he sought to save us amen and to heal us and to deliver us ain't that right see God's love is how we got Jesus Christ and we must not forget that now amen God so loved amen that It produced Jesus Christ a savior A Healer a deliverer a a way maker amen a redeemer ain't that right see and there's nothing else that could produce him amen not man's love could produce Jesus Christ amen not an a a mortal love or an Earthly love or lust love or filthy love or what there's only one kind of love that could produce such a person as Jesus Christ and that's Divine love amen and if you notice he was sent the Bible says he was manifested to destroy the works of the devil he was sent to destroy the works of the devil the prophets had spoken of him there had been songs written about him amen uh sung about him uh poets had written about him and all the Old Testament types and shatters had had testified of of him but he had to be manifested amen uh it it it it wasn't good enough that they they wrote about him it wasn't good enough amen that they sung about him it wasn't good enough that they preached and prophesied of him he had to be manifested can you say amen and to fulfill what love was looking for amen God so Lov that It produced a manifestation of Jesus Christ brother Brandon would tell us then Jesus came to break the clouds back so that attribute could display itself that attribute is you that attribute could not come and and and you could not be expressed as an attribute of God without Jesus Christ coming first and and breaking them clouds and of darkness and condemnation and sin away amen he said that's it he is God's expressed word now nothing else could be manifesting other characters had all Fallen then you see what Jesus what did Jesus come to bring back those characters he come to bring back those Fallen characters ain't that right see he says then you see what Jesus did to bring back those characters no they they were born in sin shaped in iniquity he came as a redeemer everybody say he came as a redeemer and to redeem anything is to bring it back bring it back it was God's thought you bring back God's Fallen thought ain't that right so he says see it was God's thought you think little you little me no one in the world could take my place nobody can take yours you being a Christian and filled with the spirit God and before the foundation of the world seen you knowed every feature that you got see and Jesus come to bring you back that's what Jesus was here for the Redeemer the human body to bring you back and that had to come to be a human see a as a redeemer to display his attributes as Savior come to redeem you and bring you back from where you come from oh I'm so glad to know I came from him that's what Jesus said I came from God and I go back to God but you come from God and you're going back that's where we're headed to can you say Amen this world ain't our home amen but we're not returning to him as Sinners cuz that's not where we was we're not returning to him as some fallen down degenerated person that's not what we came from another place brother brandham said what was Jesus manifested for to show God now keep that in mind is to show God the purpose of Christ see was because God so loved and it manifested him now so so I hope I hope it's you're understanding it's to show God he was manifested for that purpose and through that purpose he achieved a church that he the fullness of God the fullness of God might bring back or bring to pass every promised word of of God in these last days can you say Amen so he says when he gets the pinenes the preeminence in the church the position his place in the church he was able to get his place in Christ in that human body upon the Earth 2,000 years ago and look what he done and now he's getting his place in another body a bride body a many membered body of which we are you believe it another place he said see God was with us in the sun cleansing his way condescending coming down making a way for me to get back and bring his people back to manifest manifested sons of God like they had them in the Garden of Eden the whole world's are groaning and waiting for that hour for the manifestation of the sons of God oh my see so do you see what love was looking for love was not looking for Christ per se he was looking to redeem us love was looking to bring us back and love produced the Messiah love produced The Savior and through that savior there's a remedy for us to come back can you sayen love was looking for you and I see to come back to being sons of God God wasn't just satisfied with just a a natural animal atonement a natural blood atonement Amen to where we would come and but but he wanted that that didn't have the power to bring us back uh to Eden Eden condition it didn't have the power to bring us back to sons of God again can you say Amen see so we find that love love was looking for you and I to be brought back to where we came from where we were fallen from love look for a remedy and found it Christ is the remedy Christ is the remedy to all your troubles Christ is the remedy to the world problems Christ is the remedy to church problems Christ is the remedy to marital problems Christ is the remedy to mental problems physical problems spiritual problems Christ is the remedy ain't that right and love found it God so loved now the prophet said the word was invisible until it was made flesh and then the word become visible and through his sacrificial death at Calvary and his resurrection positionally placed his church in that Rim that the same invisible God could come into the individual and make the word visible an't that amazing prise the Lord same invisible God could now out now through the sacrifice of Christ take you as that individual and make the word that is invisible make it visible another place he said you are brought to Christ by the Holy Spirit who woed you through the blood of Jesus Christ and presented him as a gift oh my prise God Christ you are God's gift to Christ Christ is now pres or God presenting you to Christ as a gift showing that his labor was not in vain the sacrifice wasn't in vain Calvary wasn't in vain his rejection wasn't in vain love produced something love not only produced The Savior It produced the results of it it produced the results of Redeemer it produced the results of Calvary Divine love did it can you say Amen if love produced The Savior Love produced a redeemed so you're his love gift to Christ Christ is God's love gift to you ain't that right so we read Ephesians now again five and and it says be ye therefore followers of God now notice now be ye therefore followers of God Paul is not asking something that's impossible if it was impossible then there's no point in in in writing it in the scriptures right but it is possible you've redeemed you're Blood Bought that's it amen sister Bonnie it's really good to see you I didn't see you earlier God bless you amen and you're Blood Bought you're redeemed you're loosed and it was perfect blood that loosed you so it brought forth a perfect loosening now be followers of God if you were to look this up in the Greek it would say be ye therefore imitators everybody say imitators imitators ERS of God as dear children see so is it possible for us to imitate Christ sure Romans 8:11 it says but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you and you amen if his spirit's not in yet then don't don't don't worry about being imitator of Christ you can't do it but if his spirit is in you that's who he's talking to is a people who have the spirit of God it's the same spirit that was in Christ and it quickened his mortal body now it's quickening your mortal body now how many believes that quickening power has come to us in this day that ain't just to say in that scripture it has come to us look uh uh Luke 21:25 and there shall be signs in the Sun and now speaking of our day and in the moons and in the stars and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring brother brand said that's our TI of waves and things amen that are happening men's Hearts failing them for fear Amen brother Brandon applied that to this day never an age has men's heart been filled with fear as it in this age for looking after those things which are coming upon the Earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power can you say Amen remember now brother Bram tells us you know jumping shouting and running all over the building that's not power that's blessings now we're talking about power the son of man came with power you believe that amen power and great glory in a cloud amen amen see and brother Brandon says what it's quickening power that's the token that must be displayed can you say Amen so John 14:18 I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but you see me because I live you shall live also what happened quickening power come am quick and your mortal body amen and at that day you shall know that I'm in the father and you in me and I in you brother brand says at that day what day this day can you say Amen so the son of man in this day has come in power in a cloud with power and great glory amen and there's a group of people that has now seen it and understanding what it is he's come to us in his quick quickening power he's quickened us and we know that he is in the father we are in him and he is in us we know brother brandham said that same Spirit identified in the same manner of ministry has come upon a man at the end of the Gentile age ain't that right amen and we know that that that was brother brandham amen see but now he says the called out church is to be acting in his stead upon on the earth taking his place isn't that awesome that God would choose lowly you someone that the world would consider insignificant and yet God would choose you to take his place taking Christ's place how can you do it because his blood was so powerful that it could loose you from sin it could sanctify you it could baptize you with the Holy Ghost and then come and live himself and express himself have the prance in you to where you could take his place amen right so the called out church is to be acting in his stead upon the Earth taking his place today so he says now because that same spirit that was in him would be in them you the same spirit that was in Christ would be in you they would do the very same works now listen church I know we we're coming in we've come into an invasion of of demonic spirits in the world you're seeing the lid of hell has been taken off demons have poured in in this nation in the world and and it's becoming more than just people thoughts of evil it's an expression of evil we're literally seeing demons expressing itself in human beings ain't that right but it's not to destroy you it's to give you an opportunity to show God's power in this world are you with me you young people are not to be a statist another statistic in the world our marriages is not to be another statistic in the world to where we just end up in divorce and we're separated and our homes are broken and and all of these things that's not to be and and if if you've experienced that in life you know the blood of Christ is here for you but I'm talking to these young people hello amen that's not what God intended for you God never intended for this this body Amen to be victim of the devil it's our opportunity to express the power of Jesus Christ in this age yes sir so he says see any people that is truly the body of Jesus Christ the true church WIll manifest the same works that Jesus and the Pentecostal Church as did Jesus and the Pentecostal church because the same spirit will be in them any other church that does not have the spirit and the manifestations is going to have an account H have to account to God can you say Amen now notice the church is to have because Jesus manifested the father in love power and deity amen I I mean even even they came to him and says we know that you you're come from God a man come from God because no man can do the works that he's doing except God be with him right see so he wasn't manifesting a church he was manifesting God now this word imitate be imit ators followers of God means to follow as a pattern model or example to produce a copy to make something so that it resembles an existing thing you cannot imitate God except God himself comes in you amen and lives his life amen right so we're not a church that's a fraud a fake it's the Real Deal his Ro blood is flowing in you his spirit is flowing in you you are literally partakers of his divine nature right right amen so notice be be imitators or followers of God as dear children so so it is impossible to be an imitator of God without being a gene seed of God because he's talking to the children of of God see so remember what 1 John 3:2 says beloved now everybody say now now we are the sons of God now we are it's that's been settled if you've been saved Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost you shouldn't wonder if you're a Son of God or not I know the devil tries to convince you that you're not but you should look at that devil and say that's a lie I am no longer a sinner I'm no longer bound by you I'm a son of and daughter of God I got a different purpose now that's why I don't want to be Crows with the world I'm a I've got a different purpose I'm different from that that's right children should be imitators of their father is this not what causes a child to come into adoption in the Old Testament you know brother Bram talked about you know the child being born of of of a certain family his father has got a domain a kingdom a farm and or business or whatever you know and and you know the the father goal is for that son to take over that business take over everything but he knows that that boy's just a little boy he can't give it to him now he he he'll squander everything he don't know nothing there you go but the father is so busy uh uh uh with the kingdom and making sure all the Affairs are taken care of the Prophet said that he would hire a he he would bring in a teacher a tutor someone that is very well trusted someone that really knows the father someone that's personal connection with the father amen and and he's going to teach that boy the way of the Father the the duties that the father has the kingdom he's going to teach way the the father thinks about it way the father acts toward things the way the father deals with things he's going to teach that to the son and and he talks about that if the son was an obedient child then the teacher could say to the father oh that little fella he's one of the smartest little chaps I've ever seen oh even though he's youthful uh he's a chip off the old block do you all understand what that means chip off the old block in other words he's just like you right that's all he loves you he's ex just exactly like you he's about your business he stands just exactly firm on what you say why he's just like you another place he says the tutor tells the father sir your child is progressing wonderful he's just the chip off the old block he's just like you he acts like you he conducts himself like you in other words he doesn't handle matters differently than the way you would handle it he doesn't deal with things the business The Way Way differently than what you would do I mean you two are just exactly like the Lord how did the son get there he's an obedient child he's obedient to the word that the teacher is saying he Mission he's submitting to the word of the tutor the teaching of the tutor the guidance the leadership of the tutor the son is humbling himself and he's conforming his character his attitude his likes his desires everything to that of the father hello you see if we're Sons and Daughters of God then we shouldn't act like the world amen the tutor has come in this age how many believes that the spirit of Truth is the tutor and it had to be through a prophet for the word comes to a prophet we've had so many oh yeah we've had little truth down Through the Ages but had a lot of air in it but this message ain't got air in it it's thus say the Lord to you to tell you how to walk to tell you what the father thinks the father deals his business and how to conduct yourself and to establish and mold your character don't dismiss the message hello see so we're not to act like the world we're not to act like the movie stars we're not to act like the sports stars and act like politicians come on now politician getting revenge that's someone hates me I hate you back you do something to me I get you back we're not to act like that that's not the way father deals with his business that's not the way the father handles his Affairs you seeing out there you know uh the Canadians and the Canada uh uh Americans you know playing hockey and they're just you know you know and and they seeing in our American naal Anthem and all the Canadians they're mad at our president you know and and they're boo you know and and then they're all getting in fights and all that it's becoming a a total mess that's not the way we act not as from the father maybe as an American but not as sons of God and we forfeit our American rights when we come into this gospel and we humble ourselves to the tutorship of the father brother Bram said we're not movie stars I hope you've recognized that hope you young ladies have recognized that we're not movie stars you children we're not movie stars we are son and dollars of god notice what the prophet said a million miles Beyond them that's we're not kissing and slopping around like movie stars we're a million miles Beyond them Yello we're not having long love flings with some stranger woman out there while our wife's at home we're a million miles beyond [Music] that hello our wives ain't trying to be sex Queens like the movie stars out there they're a million miles beyond that and we should treat them that [Music] way notice we got something that they know nothing about if you're a Son of God and you're following this message with the True Heart you've got something they know nothing about in other words you're million miles above that and to go back then you're digging in the garbage can we've got something that they know nothing about unless they've experienced the same thing if they experience what you got I guarantee they ain't going to be out in the movies if they experience the things you got they ain't going to try to be basketball Stars and football stars and worrying about what America says and Canada says and and the world says ain't got this world is not our home we're coming to a millennium we're coming to a new city that has been given to us by the love of our father you believe it he said see now listen it's not the world habits that we are to adopt amen I know we're fighting them I I I get it Satan every day is trying to get us to conform to this world we are not to be conformed to the world if you got pornography habits you better loose that from you by God loose that thing get away from that thing hello if you girls are trying to be like a sex queen that the world is out there get away from that that's a devil on you I'm not saying you're possessed of the devil I'm saying you are anointed of the devil that is trying to get you to conform to that lifestyle the world has habits we are not to adopt the world has a lifestyle that we are not to pattern after are you with me the world has a characteristics that have nothing to do with us God help us all as sons of God we are to do what the Bible says lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily easily everybody say easily eily so easily readily in other words it says besets us that word beset means to harass torment entangle leide them weights that will so readily eagerly entangle you Galatians 51 Paul says Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty wherewith Christ hath made you free Stand Fast everybody say Stand Fast Stand Fast Stand Fast Stand Fast right you say oh I'm free I'm been liberated by the blood of Christ you better Stand Fast that way Stand Fast in that Liberty where Christ ha made you free and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage can you say amen God can set a man from pornography and then he'll go right back to it God can set a woman free from that sex Spirit or or that evil ungodly thing and and he could set us free and if we're not careful we fall back in that root it's the grace of God that you're free Stand Fast in [Music] that I understand we have memory and we have all of these things conscience and all that and and it seems like in different seasons of our life Satan comes back and tries to tempt us with certain things but that's where you've got to keep your guard up you you know where your faults are you know where your weaknesses are you know where Satan is good at amen trying to tempt you then you stay away from them things why because there's it's demonic spirits that are trying to bring us back into bondage again can you say amen I hope this all right look look what happened in the days of Noah Genesis 61 and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the Earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that were Fair that that they were Fair beautiful right and they took uh uh took to them wives of all which they chose now if you study it brother brandom talks about this age and remember Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the in the revealing of the son of man we know the son of man is here it's been revealed so now we that understands the character of things brother brandham open opens that up to us women were so beautiful back then they were women of Cain from Cain's descendants and the sons of God Sons of Adam saw these women and lusted after them it wasn't true heartfelt love it was lust love and they became the Propet said women Chasers brother Braham said it become a sexual thing is that what it's become today a sexual thing that's why women feel like they've got to you know maybe our girls feel like they've got to dress sexy get get the get bring the skirts up a little bit more and more and Tighter and the blouse Tighter and get everything just to get a God to if you have to do that to get a God to look at you he's he's junk amen I don't know how else to say it he's lower than a dog in my opinion a like brother Bram said your beauty comes from within that's what God sees as beautiful God God sees the character it's it's just like even brother Brown said about the character of a church he said God doesn't look at the building the beauty of the building we look at the beauty of the building that's not what God counts he counts character that's the beauty of the church is character we may not be much to the world but we're beautiful before God we are a beautiful bride because his character is being formed within us may not be much talented we may not much not may may not be much of anything but to God we're beautiful that's right so brother Braham said it was a perversion it was a sex mixup it was the very thing that drove the children of God from the Garden of Eden now is is what caused God to take peace off the Earth and to destroy the Earth when men lusting after women and brother Braham said after they lusted after they lusted after this marriage then came the marrying and giving in marriage because it wasn't true love right it's like oil and water so it become marriage and [Applause] divorce that's right see and it he said see marriage and divorce it's it's because the sons of God looked at the attractiveness of women ain't that right history says that women became so pretty and attractive that men became slaves to them now we we have to say it and you know it very well that the the spirit of lust sex adultery has taken preeminence in this nation and around the world it's taken up by storm brother brandham says the extremity or the extreme beauty of women has so increased in the past 50 years to pick up a picture of 50 years ago what an attractive women look like he said I was looking the other day in the history of the wars and how that pearl white about a hundred years ago when she was stabbed by Scott Jackson her lover and the looks of the woman now also of Mary Bon Bonville boneville Bonville and some of the so-called attractive women of 50 to 100 years ago compare them with the women of today they wouldn't stand in a shadow certainly not Burley see women has become dainty feminist and so forth more attractive what is it they dress themselves more attractive where the women you used to wear big great big dresses and sleeves and long skirts and hid their body because they didn't want men lusting for them amen can you sayen they only live for one man that chose them for wife today the women pour themselves into the little clothes and immorality is on such a move and a rampage till it's beyond even thinking can you say Amen see so you see where it's come from it's a devil that that's anointing them but we're Sons and Daughters of [Music] God you love him we find that many have conformed to the themselves to the spirit of hate murder divisiveness amen you say well I got a right to defend myself you better watch that Spirit now and you better keep that balance to that amen hello we find that Millions have conformed themselves to a religious spirit having a form of godliness and denying the power thereof see it's demonic spirits that are unseen but now they're manifesting themselves in the people because these Spirits have now taking control don't let the devil take control of you don't let him take control of your mind come on Church can't let him take control of the church can't let him take control of our home amen see and we're finding now that many people cannot lay aside every weight and sin that so easily has beset them they they're they're entrenched they're entangled they they become slaves to this thing sure hello the Bible says if a man loves the world or the even the things of the world the love of God is not in them you understand that you can't love the things of the world and have the love of God in you amen true the love of the world will not produce Christ and we're called as a body of Christ to produce Christ amen can you say Amen brother Bram said all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the pride of life the lust of the eyes is not of God but of the world I mean that's what Paul would tell us right so brother brandom says this it's too bad that the things of the world has so captured the church in these days and Satan had a rude way of doing it to bring in the televisions right into the homes and things and corrupting the minds of the people till today that a great present uh of the church that called themselves Christians will stay home from prayer meeting on a Wednesday night uh to get to see some favorite program of somebody from h hwood or somewhere that oughtn't even to be put out on the screen maybe living with three or four husbands or wives and carrying on and living all kinds of lives go out drunk on drunk parties smoking lying and everything that can be done that's wrong and then it's put up on the screens right and our church are fashioning theirselves even our dress in this day becomes after Hollywood what a Pity it's got to be see uh that our minds uh uh can't stay pure pure and holy with Christ it's done something to the church it's crippled it it's done a horrible thing all our papers and everything just seems to be corrupted but listen friends it's in that hour of corruption and that time of corruption that God draws himself a bride that comes out of that corruption that's what he's looking for to get a church that's called by his name somebody that looks for a life that has no end are you with me we we ain't just looking at everything and being affected by all these things we're looking up lift your head up your Redemption drath nah don't get your eyes up here you'll be contaminated with it see so notice God truly expects us to be imitators of him because in that second verse he says Walk In Love walk everybody say walk in love walk walk in love as Christ hath loved us and gave himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling Savor so the love that we are to walk in is the same love that Christ had for us we've talked about it I believe last Sunday but the love with which he had for us is agapo love agapo love is the highest form of love which is an exotic love remember we talked about the Exotic it means something that is foreign something introduced from a strange country it it it's it's it's an exotic love it ain't something that we just have by birth it's something that comes to us from something that we know nothing about ain't that right it's foreign to mankind see and foreign means something that is in introduced from another country mysteriously different unusual so so this this kind of love does not come to us through teaching it it does not come by way of learning about it we we we can talk about the importance importance of having this kind of love and we should John wrote about it and tells us that it is a must that we need it brother brandom talked about it and and and and and all of these things but no man no matter how much he teaches about it no matter how much he writes about it no matter how much he sings and all these things about the love nobody can give us love like this God himself it takes God can you say amen and no man can possess This Love Without possessing God for the Bible says God is love amen you with me no wonder this is how Christ could could portray such love because God was in him amen John said he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love remember in 1 Corinthians the 13th chapter it tells us a man can speak with tongues of men and of and of angels a man can have the gift of Prophecy a man can have understanding of all Mysteries and to have all knowledge he can have all Faith so that he can move mountains a man can bestow all all of his Goods to feed the poor can give his body to be burned and yet not have God true you say well that that's charity but God is Charity God is love but all these things can be done and a man not have God at all he can feed the poor he can raise up John 3:16 missions he can do all these things and still not have God is't that amazing see so here's the thing though without this kind of love it's all to no avail hello it took this kind of love to redeem us it took this quality of love to set us free yes amen it wasn't human love that done this it was God's love ago love that's why would take God himself what if Jesus preached the gospel and yet did it without love what if he healed the sick and yet did it without love what if he turned the water and to Wine raise the dead without having love it would be to no avail that's right he would have had selfish motives he would have done it all to build a name for himself brother bradam says unless each one of these gifts is put right in the center of Love it'll become selfish and indifferent and pull itself off and isolate itself have you notice Mo a lot of these Ministries today isolate themselves it that's nothing new brother Terry we've been seeing this through a through through time men rise up in the message and they get this certain whatever and and they get get a drawing and before you know it they start isolating themselves and keeping the people to them because they've got a Ministry without love so he says unless each one of these Min gifts is put right in the center of Love it'll become selfish and indifferent and pull itself off and isolate itself cross over and fuss and stoop but when it's anchored right into the middle of Love it'll Fellowship everywhere see so if Jesus didn't have love he would have compromised the first opportunity he had right and he was given some amen he would have quit the first hard trial that came if he didn't have love he he he he would have catered to The Temptations that Satan offered him if he didn't have love true amen that's why you know you you it's hard to it's hard to trust a Ministry when they're looking for something else greater something great and can't be satisfied where God's placed them see they've not come to love they they might come up with a good sermon they might come up with good things they might have good gifts they might have great things but but if they're looking around for something to better themselves then they ain't got that quality that of love that Jesus had am can you say Amen see cause cuse the Bible says he endured the cross and despising the shame he could not have done that without love he had the power to call 10,000 angels down but love kept him from doing it amen notice now for it says in 1 Corinthians 13:7 that love beareth all things everybody say beareth all thingsare love beareth all things love believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things now love in in this when he says believeth all things it does not mean that it's just gullible to believe everything but Christ so loved us that he believed in us he believed in that word about us can you say Amen church he believed in it he believed in it and sometime we can't believe in one another because we ain't got that type of love amen he cried out while hanging on the cross saying father forgive them for they know not what they do well he couldn't have done that without love for the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 13:5 that love does not behave itself unseemingly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thanketh no evil can you sayen amen and here acts 8:32 says he was led as a sheep to the slaughter and like a d lamb dumb before his sheer Soul opened he not his mouth which tells us that love does not seek revenge love does not seek retaliation Church if it had not been love we wouldn't be here today because we certainly don't we we don't we're not worthy of Mercy we're not worthy of Heaven we're not worthy of anything by All rights God should have retaliated for our our blunders and our mistakes and our unbelief and our doubt and our questioning him but love sought for a remedy how we need love amen love seeks for a remedy so behold what manner of love is this as John would say it's a love that could only come from God and and we know Paul would tell us that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself ain't that right I ain't going to keep you much longer but but I want to get finish my thought Jesus expressed God to the People by expressing the love of God prise the Lord right amen so a gift of Prophecy does not express God to the people a gift of healing does not express God to the people working miracles doesn't Express God to the people preaching the gospel doesn't Express God to the people can you say Amen knowing all the Mysteries and having all knowledge doesn't Express him brother bradam says the only way that God can be expressed to the people is through love can you say Amen so he says in another place Jesus expressed God's love when he was here on Earth in so many different ways till it is undisputable that he was the most loving creature that ever lived not that he was the most gied not that he was the most spiritual not that he was whatever he was the most loving creature that ever lived in every aspect he displayed God's love in so many ways can you say Amen see love love motivated him to show the Messiah sign how many believes that love it was love that motivated him to show the Messiah sign amen even though he knew that it would cause jealousy among religious people they would become jealous of him but yet his love caused him to do it anyways so that the people could know God was among them yes amen look at the same thing the Messiah sign of today done the same thing it caused men to become come jealous it caused men to become impersonators it caused men to to to whatever but yet love caused that gift to work so that we could know God and know that he was present Among Us many you say amen amen so love caused him to do it see love caused Jesus to stand we could say it this way in in in in the prayer line night after night so was it with this way in this age every night night after night brother Brandon said Jesus had prayer lines and he was tired and he was weary but yet love caused him to do this so that the people would know that the promised Redeemer was here was on Earth can you say Amen love callus him to speak the mystery of who he was to the people even though he knew that people were going to walk away from him and even though it would it would cause him to be crucified yet he wanted the people that he El to know that God was there among in in in flesh hello amen that's why he would say I came from my father I go to my father that's why he said except you eat this flesh My Flesh and drink this Blood you have no life in you what was he declaring he was declaring he was not just man he was God and he had to let the people know are you with me amen and so is it in this age the opening of the word that third pool was the opening of the word amen and it had to be opened for this elect and yet it caused our Prophet to be rejected that's righten but he still would preach marriage and divorce he would still preach you know Christ is the mystery of God revealed he would still preach these things unto the people love caused it to happen are you with me love caused Christ to sanctify himself for the sake of those who were following him brother Braham said he was a lamb what did he do he had a right to a home he was a he was a man he had a right to be married he was a man he he had a right to good clothes he was a man but he Sanctified himself he forfeited he he could have come down the corridors of Glory a full statured man with an Angelic band but he Sanctified himself he could have at least been born in a nice clean bed somewhere but he was born in a manger over a manure Pile in a borrowed manger but he Sanctified himself why he was the lamb see friends we got to get back Amen to assembly line religions and so forth and all these things were getting away from from the real things humble yourself everybody say humble yourself keep humble Lord sanctify me now why was he though sanctifying himself he said Jesus was training some men that was going to take the gospel to all the world 12 men so we lived a Sanctified life and forfeited every worldly pleasure for their sake Divine love divine love caused him to do this say he was setting an example brother brandom in another place said he was training 12 men that was going to take the gospel to all the world so he Sanctified himself for their sake I sanctify myself for their sake a gift of God keeping himself Sanctified oh gifts of God you people who claim that you've received the spirit keep yourself Sanctified keep away from the things of the world be sanctified I think that's what we need is love that keeps us Sanctified love that keeps us apart from the world that keeps the pulpits clean that keeps the offices clean can you say Amen not Dilly ding in sin in the world and then and then getting behind the pulpit and you know just because we can preach that that's not the point Love Takes it it takes takes Love Takes love brother Braham said we ought to Forfeit our worldly dressing our worldly pleasures and things like that for the sake of the people we're trying to lead God lead to God ain't that right we're trying to lead the outside world to God we need [Music] love love that causes us to be Sanctified Lord love that causes us Daddy to live a right life before our families love that causes us to keep this the uh to live a right life upon the jobs or wherever we're at at schools or wherever love we've got this you know people get this attitude I don't care what people think let them think what they want you ain't got love yet and I understand you know you can live a Christian life and you're going to be persecuted by that Christian Life I get that brother Brown Paul would tell us now that's where the blessing comes when you're persecuted for Christ's sake but when you're persecuted for your foolishness when you're persecuted for hypocrite life can you say Amen then that should cause us to look at our lives see we need love I hope you understand I know we're on our own people I get that but love causes us to think sure if I do this I know it may not even be a sin to me but if I do this what does other people think I'll just be honest if if that's okay you know uh sometime you know uh there's you know okay whether you agree with it or not but there you know uh sometimes my wife uses uh uh cooking wine or wine for cooking or whatever you know and uh a while you know a couple years back you know she said well should I just go into the you know store and get it I said absolutely not yeah but I'm just getting it for cooking it's not and I said no we're not going to do that I said what if somebody sees this what what if they see you walking in that that store then what are you going to do and you're over there getting wine now you may be doing it for cooking but what is the other people going to say about it you understand what I'm saying brother Ram even said about going into a hotel room with a woman he said now to counsel with her or being in a room with a woman he said that now that may that ain't going to hurt me he said that may not even hurt me at all I'm just going into counsel with her but what if somebody sees me going in that room with a woman you understand what I'm saying and and so so but what what kept Him from doing these things love love because he knew that if he was preaching the gospel he wanted the people not to have questions about his life amen that's why we must walk true to all men that's why we must walk honestly we don't want people thinking we're a hypocrite and church if you think I'm a hypocrite please come and tell me because I I want to be right right I don't want my children thinking I'm a hypocrite I don't want my wife thinking I'm a hypocrite I'd rather repent to them if I've done something wrong I Repent to them I I want to be right you understand what I'm saying why because love that's true we're trying to bring the most important message to the people amen yes sir hello even brother Brown told a joke and he tells it on on tape the joke that he told told a joke to a woman or to a man he went home and told her husband take that I'm getting this wrong here he told a man and the man went home and told his wife they thought it was funny but the wife was offended by it brother Brown said I went to to her and apologize for it or telling the joke because it offended her you understand what I'm saying so if we're not careful we live such lives so loosely not thinking about what our children are doing what they're thinking about what the world what our employees what our boss what whatever is thinking we need the love of God we need the love of God that would drive us to seek a remedy for division it's easy to retaliate it's easy to look at the situation say that's their fault but Jesus didn't do that and it was our fault no question about it he was hated without a cause and yet there is innocent hanging on a cross saying father forgive them for they know not what they do can you say Amen see walk in love and I I'm not going to keep you much longer I know we're at the end but I had a lot more but I will say it this way we're at The Headstone that's right we're at the capping of the church where the headstone is coming and remember the church cannot not be complete without it and remember we've come through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost now some want to stop there and say that's it but brother Brown said no sanctification made way for or justification made way for sanctification Luther made way for Wesley's message Wesley's message made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost Pentecost and Pentecost made way for the Holy Ghost himself the person to come into that and brother brand said that's the Capstone see the church can't be complete so where are we at are we are we are we at the the bottom of the pyramid where it's just so wide no we've been going up up up up up we' passed justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost now we're in the Capstone age which is him coming into that which is Charity no wonder Satan is fight fight so hard on this these things but a Ministry cannot be effective without love you may be despised you may be rejected you may be spat upon hated whatever but let it be because of Christ Christ and yet even though they don't repent and even though they don't say sorry and even though they don't see that they're wrong and even though they despise you and reject you and be them put on holy eror love them anyhow love seeks a remedy can you say man you love him Lord if the musicians will come the ministry of love we all know brother Brown said we've come to a time where only love will be found in the elect that's right love is being taken away from the world and we're seeing it more and more and more hate murder rejection division fighting fussing just read where the other day just a bunch of people got in a fight in a brawl allout brawl in an airport just an allout brawl they getting fights in PLS they're getting fights in the courts now they're getting fights everywhere cuz hate has hate has taken over love is gone but the only thing will be found is love in the elect because there's a Capstone Christ himself charity God has found a body that he could come and reflect that same Divine love that he did through Christ can you say Amen it's the revealing of Christ again oh God help us can you say amen I love the Lord do you love him amen what song ever out of the Lord can we sing it again I want to live the way he wants me to [Music] be until there's just no you say well how do we get that Capstone brother said you have to be shaved you
