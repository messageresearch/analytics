[1:04:42] appreciate uh your pastor very much and
[1:04:45] just a great man of God a man of
[1:04:48] integrity and character and and uh we
[1:04:52] just uh appreciate uh how that he has
[1:04:55] just emptied himself out for Christ's
[1:04:58] sake and um uh I tell you we uh we need
[1:05:03] men of God in this hour that will preach
[1:05:06] the truth and and preach it with
[1:05:08] conviction and believe that Jesus Christ
[1:05:11] is alive today and he's the same in in
[1:05:15] every way yesterday today and forever
[1:05:18] and uh I believe that you find that uh
[1:05:22] that those characteristics in uh brother
[1:05:25] Sean and we love him and uh love sister
[1:05:28] Heather and the family
[1:05:30] and I love you as a church and uh if you
[1:05:34] have your Bibles we'll uh turn to
[1:05:37] Matthew the 14th chapter we appreciate
[1:05:40] to all of the songs and uh it's just
[1:05:43] tremendous uh to be with my uh just my
[1:05:47] all of my family and uh uh We've we've
[1:05:51] got to leave uh uh get the get the kids
[1:05:55] and they start a school this past week
[1:05:58] and so we've got to get them back for
[1:06:00] school
[1:06:02] and so or you'd be hearing brother
[1:06:05] brother Wendell this morning and uh I I
[1:06:09] would definitely be definitely would
[1:06:12] rather be sitting out there listening to
[1:06:14] brother Wendell and uh but you'll you'll
[1:06:17] have a masterpiece tonight and uh wish
[1:06:20] we were here to pull on the word but
[1:06:23] Matthew the 14th chapter
[1:06:26] the 25th verse
[1:06:29] and then we'll also uh turn over to
[1:06:33] Romans the fourth chapter and
[1:06:36] the 19th verse
[1:06:39] and in the fourth watch
[1:06:42] of the night Jesus went unto them and
[1:06:46] when you look at that Fourth Watch
[1:06:48] there was the the time is broke up into
[1:06:52] different watches and
[1:06:56] um some believe that this could have or
[1:06:58] this is the the time is between three to
[1:07:01] six in the morning and uh this could be
[1:07:04] maybe the time of the dawning of of the
[1:07:08] new day and I thought that was striking
[1:07:11] because it's very parallel uh with our
[1:07:15] day and how brother Branham says it is
[1:07:17] the rising of the Sun
[1:07:19] so in the Fourth Watch of the night
[1:07:22] Jesus went unto them walking on the sea
[1:07:26] and when the disciples saw him walking
[1:07:28] on the sea they were troubled saying it
[1:07:31] is a spirit
[1:07:32] and they cried out for fear but
[1:07:35] straightway Jesus spake unto them saying
[1:07:38] be of goods here it is I Be not Afraid
[1:07:42] and Peter answered him and said Lord if
[1:07:47] it be thou bid me come unto thee on the
[1:07:50] water
[1:07:51] and he said come and when Peter was come
[1:07:55] down out of the ship he walked on the
[1:07:58] water to go to Jesus but when he saw the
[1:08:01] wind boisterous he was afraid and
[1:08:05] beginning to sink he cried saying Lord
[1:08:08] save me and immediately Jesus stretched
[1:08:11] forth his hand and caught him and said
[1:08:14] unto him oh thou of little faith
[1:08:18] wherefore did thou doubt now Romans the
[1:08:23] fourth chapter
[1:08:25] 19th verse reading to verse 21
[1:08:34] and being not weak in faith he
[1:08:36] considered not his own body now dead
[1:08:39] when he was about 100 years old neither
[1:08:41] yet the deadness of Sarah's womb
[1:08:45] he staggered not at the promise of God
[1:08:47] through unbelief
[1:08:49] but was strong in faith giving glory to
[1:08:53] God
[1:08:54] and being fully persuaded that what he
[1:08:58] had promised he was able also to perform
[1:09:02] you don't have to turn to it but I'd
[1:09:04] like to just read John Saint John 11 and
[1:09:08] verse 40 and this is at the tomb of
[1:09:10] Lazarus
[1:09:12] Jesus said unto her Martha
[1:09:15] said I nod unto thee that if thou
[1:09:18] wouldest believe thou should see the
[1:09:22] glory of God now let's just bow our
[1:09:25] hearts and maybe you have something on
[1:09:27] your heart this morning and if you'd
[1:09:29] like to just raise a hand I know God
[1:09:31] sees us God knows us father with
[1:09:35] surrendered hearts and great love and
[1:09:38] great respects for you and your word and
[1:09:41] your promises
[1:09:42] father we ask that you would just bless
[1:09:45] your children minister to them Father
[1:09:49] Lord the songs have been sung the
[1:09:51] atmosphere has been created now God may
[1:09:56] your word just go right to the heart and
[1:10:00] speak to his father take us out of the
[1:10:02] way and hide us beneath the blood of
[1:10:04] Jesus Lord we'll be careful to give you
[1:10:07] all the glory and all the honor in the
[1:10:10] name of Jesus Christ
[1:10:12] amen and amen God bless you as you can
[1:10:16] have your seats
[1:10:18] I'd like to just for a text something
[1:10:21] that I've been pondering over and and uh
[1:10:25] just thinking about and uh that is Faith
[1:10:30] to hold on to God's promises
[1:10:33] and a very very simple thought but yet a
[1:10:38] very needful and a very powerful word I
[1:10:41] believe and and that is just simply that
[1:10:44] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:10:47] God
[1:10:48] and we as the Bride of Jesus Christ uh
[1:10:54] our desire is to please him and when we
[1:10:58] look at the walk that we have been
[1:11:01] predestinated to which is likened unto
[1:11:05] Enoch and uh Enoch had this testimony
[1:11:09] that he pleased God and he pleased God
[1:11:13] because it was a faith walk it was uh
[1:11:17] and Faith of course is a revelation and
[1:11:21] uh so he he walked with God according to
[1:11:25] Revelation the Divine uh wheel and the
[1:11:29] Divine Purpose of God was made known to
[1:11:32] him and he walked in that and that was
[1:11:35] uh Faith to him to Enoch and so it is
[1:11:39] that he he achieved a testimony that he
[1:11:43] pleased God through that Faith through
[1:11:46] that Revelation and that is the way that
[1:11:49] the bride
[1:11:51] finds satisfaction finds uh a way to
[1:11:55] fulfill the desire of her heart which
[1:11:59] any any bride has a desire to please her
[1:12:02] husband and and therefore the bride's
[1:12:06] desire to please him is only found in
[1:12:09] believing the word and follow fall of
[1:12:13] walking in that revealed wheel for this
[1:12:17] day which is actually the revealed will
[1:12:20] for her life and uh the scripture there
[1:12:24] in Revelations the 12th chapter says
[1:12:27] that we overcome by the blood of the
[1:12:30] lamb and the word of Our Testimony money
[1:12:34] and so I I can't think of any greater
[1:12:37] testimony than actually coming from our
[1:12:41] lips in knowing that we believe the word
[1:12:45] and and and knowing having this
[1:12:48] confidence that we please God and and we
[1:12:51] please him through our faith and and and
[1:12:55] therefore we we have this testimony that
[1:12:58] we believe the blood of the lamb and we
[1:13:01] believe the word and this is the age of
[1:13:06] the Overcomer the prophet would say that
[1:13:09] this is the age of the Overcomer the
[1:13:12] dispensation of overcoming and again the
[1:13:16] prophet would say and anything that wins
[1:13:19] a victory it's an overcoming something
[1:13:22] it overcomes their object that they're
[1:13:27] fighting against therefore if this is
[1:13:31] the dispensation of overcoming thing
[1:13:34] then we we are looking for victory and
[1:13:39] and we're contending for the faith and
[1:13:42] and that is to to get victory over over
[1:13:47] Satan and over all hell that has been
[1:13:50] released in this hour and and so it's
[1:13:54] it's our objective uh we want to see our
[1:13:57] family say we want to see uh the sick
[1:14:00] made a whole we we want to see
[1:14:03] individuals sealed under the kingdom of
[1:14:06] God by the Holy Ghost and and the the
[1:14:09] and uh John said that this is the
[1:14:12] victory that overcomes the world even
[1:14:16] our faith and so there's only one way in
[1:14:20] this in this dispensation of overcoming
[1:14:24] and there's only one way to get victory
[1:14:27] over our objective and that is Faith
[1:14:31] outside of Faith you can't get anything
[1:14:34] from God outside of Faith the word just
[1:14:38] lays dormant it's a seed but it but that
[1:14:41] word seed must have a fertile heart of
[1:14:45] faith and and and then the greatest
[1:14:49] thing is the power of commitment commit
[1:14:52] that word into a heart of faith and just
[1:14:55] let it go and it will bring forth of its
[1:14:59] kind it's a Word of Promise therefore
[1:15:02] faith is a revelation of the will of God
[1:15:05] the purpose of God for our lives and and
[1:15:09] it's the will of God to believe his word
[1:15:12] I I know that sounds very strange and
[1:15:16] even so Elementary uh to to say that
[1:15:19] it's very simple but yet in a world that
[1:15:22] we live in uh it's the will of God for
[1:15:27] you to believe his word amen I I you see
[1:15:32] denomination sin and many just the
[1:15:35] masses of people they fell on that one
[1:15:39] Revelation that the word of God is to be
[1:15:43] believed amen the word of God is the
[1:15:47] infallible
[1:15:49] Vindicated voice of God in this day and
[1:15:53] hour is not to be disputed it's not to
[1:15:56] be debated it's not to you know try to
[1:15:59] be figured out it is simply the will of
[1:16:03] God to believe the word amen if he said
[1:16:07] it believe it if he said you're healed
[1:16:09] then believe it if he said you're going
[1:16:11] to make the Rapture then believe it if
[1:16:14] he said you're more than an overcomer
[1:16:16] then just believe it just simply believe
[1:16:19] the word it is the will desire the very
[1:16:24] revealed revelation of God's thoughts
[1:16:27] for you to just take him at his word
[1:16:32] you see believe for the impossible don't
[1:16:35] don't limit God believe for the
[1:16:37] impossible amen and and and they would
[1:16:40] come to Jesus and they would ask you
[1:16:42] know the lepers would come will you heal
[1:16:44] us the blind would come will you heal us
[1:16:46] the dumb and the death would come will
[1:16:49] you believe will you heal us and he says
[1:16:51] if thou can'tst believe
[1:16:56] all things say that with me all things
[1:16:59] are possible to him that believeth Jesus
[1:17:04] never put a limitation on faith he never
[1:17:08] said well you can go so far in your
[1:17:10] faith and then you're gonna you're gonna
[1:17:12] top out amen all things all things the
[1:17:16] Supernatural is only limited to your
[1:17:19] faith amen but if you can take God at
[1:17:22] his word then all things are possible
[1:17:26] with God and all things are possible
[1:17:29] with you also because God's a believer
[1:17:32] and you're a Believer you are
[1:17:36] you are an eyeing of the very Faith Of
[1:17:39] God May manifest amen we find the wind
[1:17:42] when Sarah was having problems with her
[1:17:46] faith and she was laughing you know I
[1:17:49] was kind of snickering at a inner her
[1:17:52] heart amen because Elohim was there
[1:17:56] saying I've come to visit you I I
[1:17:58] remember my promise and Sarah was having
[1:18:02] a a hard time a man just simply
[1:18:05] believing the word amen she she failed
[1:18:09] to recognize the presence of God in her
[1:18:12] midst she she just thought that this was
[1:18:15] just another man a man and this man was
[1:18:18] speaking foolish things because she
[1:18:20] couldn't fulfill the promise she was an
[1:18:23] old woman a man she was she was going on
[1:18:26] her 90th birthday amen but you see when
[1:18:29] Elohim the word or the power of
[1:18:32] discernment through the word that can go
[1:18:35] to the very high Earth and divide
[1:18:37] between Soul and Spirit and go to what
[1:18:41] you're thinking amen what you're going
[1:18:43] through what Satan is trying to afflict
[1:18:45] you with the disease of unbelief and
[1:18:48] confusion and Amnesia amen but the word
[1:18:52] Elohim the son of man begin to say is
[1:18:56] there anything too hard for the Lord I
[1:19:00] say Elohim the son of man has come in
[1:19:04] this hour the word has divided between
[1:19:07] Soul and Spirit and he's here this
[1:19:10] morning and he's speaking the same word
[1:19:12] is there anything too hard for the Lord
[1:19:16] I don't care how long you've been going
[1:19:18] through the trial I don't care how much
[1:19:21] confusion and how much spiritual Amnesia
[1:19:24] we go through I don't care how much
[1:19:26] hardships but is there anything too hard
[1:19:29] for the Lord doesn't God know where the
[1:19:31] shot is if he's on The Honky Tonk Bar or
[1:19:35] whatever wherever three years is there
[1:19:38] anything too hard for the Lord can he
[1:19:40] reach down to the very mile of sin and
[1:19:43] lift him up and fill with the power of
[1:19:46] the Holy Ghost is there anything too
[1:19:49] hard for the Lord when Jesus said your
[1:19:52] name is engraved in the palm of my hand
[1:19:54] and I will not lose one he has swore by
[1:19:59] an old that he will keep you preserve
[1:20:03] you make sure you're in the Rapture is
[1:20:07] there anything to heart for the Lord
[1:20:09] can't you hear the words of Elohim
[1:20:12] speaking it
[1:20:13] can't you hear the son of man being
[1:20:15] revealed the son of man the word being
[1:20:19] opened and revealed is there anything
[1:20:21] too hard for the Lord
[1:20:25] you see God wants the church separated
[1:20:29] from all unbelief
[1:20:32] and and and there's many many quotes and
[1:20:34] you're taught on these things and so I'm
[1:20:36] not going to go through these quotes and
[1:20:38] scriptures because you're very much
[1:20:41] versed in them but God wants a separated
[1:20:45] he wants us purified
[1:20:48] that's the purpose of the word
[1:20:51] it's not just a letter it's not just an
[1:20:54] intellectual the word is the blood
[1:20:58] and the word became flesh
[1:21:02] and it was the blood of God the Creator
[1:21:05] blood cell that brought forth that word
[1:21:08] body
[1:21:09] and it was that body that died for your
[1:21:12] high breeding it was that word that
[1:21:16] flesh that died for your unbelief
[1:21:19] it was Thy word that was made manifest
[1:21:22] that declared it is finished that you
[1:21:26] can once and for all just simply say I
[1:21:30] believe when the devil says you're not a
[1:21:32] Believer but you're free to say I
[1:21:34] believe when all of everything else is
[1:21:37] gone against you the doctor's reports
[1:21:39] are against you the symptoms are against
[1:21:42] you the Mind battles are against you the
[1:21:45] devil's trying to get you to quit but
[1:21:47] yet you are free to Simply stand and say
[1:21:51] I believe not try to work it up not try
[1:21:55] to make it happen not try to produce
[1:21:57] something not try to manufacture
[1:21:59] something you have been liberated to
[1:22:03] just simply stand upon the word and say
[1:22:07] I am a believer no condemnation against
[1:22:12] your life How can there be condemnation
[1:22:14] to someone that has been made perfect by
[1:22:17] the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:22:19] you are loosed
[1:22:23] you are loose to believe
[1:22:26] you are free to just simply be a
[1:22:29] believer
[1:22:30] you are free to just simply say I am
[1:22:33] healed I am Holy Ghost I am going in the
[1:22:37] Rapture you are free
[1:22:42] it's a perfect loosing
[1:22:45] the blood that was made for us to die
[1:22:47] for your hybriding that died for your
[1:22:49] unbelief it's a perfect loosing once
[1:22:53] you're loose there's no condemnation to
[1:22:56] them that are in Christ Jesus that body
[1:22:58] was already judged on Calvary and the
[1:23:02] body of Christ you and I were in him and
[1:23:05] we have been judged in that body because
[1:23:09] we are only the physical manifestation
[1:23:11] of his thoughts before the foundation of
[1:23:15] the world that we were in Christ judged
[1:23:18] in that one sacrifice therefore it's a
[1:23:22] perfect loosing from all unbelief
[1:23:30] your mind wants to understand things
[1:23:33] but you're loosed
[1:23:35] you're loose from your mind

[1:23:42] can it be but you're loosed
[1:23:44] you're free
[1:23:47] when you make a mistake
[1:23:49] and in your spirit you know there's
[1:23:52] memory and the devil's beating you up
[1:23:54] and trying to stir up those memories of
[1:23:58] your failures and your mistakes but
[1:24:00] you're loose
[1:24:02] I I hope you're understanding where I'm
[1:24:04] at you're loose from your thinking
[1:24:06] you're loose from your memories you're
[1:24:09] loose you're purged from the very
[1:24:12] conscience of sin the very desire of sin
[1:24:15] we're now dealing with your soul and
[1:24:18] your soul never doubted from the
[1:24:22] beginning
[1:24:24] but my mind but from the beginning it
[1:24:26] was not sure but but all of these things
[1:24:29] in my spirit I remember I know what I
[1:24:31] did the devil's reminding me but from
[1:24:33] the beginning it was the show
[1:24:37] he said but Jonathan what was in the
[1:24:39] beginning the words
[1:24:41] [Applause]
[1:24:41] [Music]
[1:24:46] Hallelujah
[1:24:47] you see it's God's will for you to be
[1:24:50] free loosed
[1:24:52] the Jubilee
[1:24:54] to loose us
[1:24:56] from everything
[1:24:58] that would hinder faith
[1:25:01] to bring us to an absolute
[1:25:03] a tight post of the Soul
[1:25:06] and that is the word a Thy Word
[1:25:09] nevertheless
[1:25:11] yes I've toiled I've done this I've done
[1:25:13] this I've done this I've been working
[1:25:14] I've been working I've tried I've tried
[1:25:16] I've tried but nevertheless on a Sunday
[1:25:18] morning after trying service after
[1:25:20] service after service after service
[1:25:22] after service after service nevertheless
[1:25:24] at Thy Word
[1:25:28] I've tried I've not got anything I've
[1:25:31] not received anything but nevertheless
[1:25:33] at that word I believe
[1:25:37] that changes everything
[1:25:42] you see Jesus left the church
[1:25:44] with a Great Commission
[1:25:47] I say that's a glorious thing
[1:25:50] a Great Commission
[1:25:52] to be his Representatives upon this
[1:25:55] Earth
[1:25:56] amen and these signs
[1:25:59] shall follow
[1:26:01] them that believe
[1:26:04] you see it's the scriptural
[1:26:05] identification of a believer
[1:26:09] these signs shall follow them that
[1:26:12] belief we don't need any scarecrows
[1:26:14] around it we don't need anyone to put
[1:26:17] this or that to it just simply say Lord
[1:26:20] I'm a Believer
[1:26:22] I just that's just that's a simple as we
[1:26:26] can get it Lord I believe
[1:26:30] these signs shall follow them that
[1:26:34] believe you see the prophet would say
[1:26:37] that he he Sanctified a church
[1:26:40] with his spirit and blood
[1:26:43] a church that he might make every
[1:26:47] promise in this last day be revealed now
[1:26:50] see he could go back and pick up what
[1:26:53] these other fellows has left off here in
[1:26:55] the last days and by his holy spirit
[1:26:57] reveal all the mystery of the Seven
[1:27:00] Seals he is expressing himself that's
[1:27:03] his purpose that's why he died that's
[1:27:05] the second fault of his threefold
[1:27:07] manifestation first to express himself
[1:27:09] in Christ and express himself through
[1:27:12] the church and the same thing Christ was
[1:27:15] the word now I want you to get this part
[1:27:18] now Christ was the word and the church
[1:27:22] becomes the word when it lets the word
[1:27:26] go through them
[1:27:28] you see again now let's go back to the
[1:27:31] beginning he Sanctified Sanctified is to
[1:27:35] be set apart for service
[1:27:38] he Sanctified he sent his church apart
[1:27:43] from all the world all unbelief and he
[1:27:48] Sanctified that a church that he might
[1:27:51] make every promise in this last day be
[1:27:54] revealed where is it being revealed
[1:27:57] to the believer through the believer
[1:28:01] you see he's expressing himself that's
[1:28:03] his purpose that's that's why he died
[1:28:06] and Jesus would say my word is spirit
[1:28:10] the prophet would pick that up my word
[1:28:12] is spirit see
[1:28:14] Anointed with the word
[1:28:17] when the but when the current is Flowing
[1:28:20] freely now the prophet would say Amen if
[1:28:23] the current is Flowing freely and it and
[1:28:25] it hits resistance or it hits something
[1:28:27] that it's gonna it's gonna blow a fuse
[1:28:30] if it grounds out and he says you know
[1:28:32] what what's happening is the word cannot
[1:28:35] flow freely through these
[1:28:37] denominationals amen and and they're
[1:28:40] teaching and their Creeds and and all of
[1:28:43] their all of their teachings is because
[1:28:47] they are teaching the people that God
[1:28:50] cannot do it
[1:28:52] they're teaching the people that we can
[1:28:55] only take so much of the word and so
[1:28:57] many parts of the word and therefore the
[1:29:00] current the power The Authority the
[1:29:04] anointing cannot fall freely but you see
[1:29:08] the church has been Sanctified the
[1:29:12] church has been set apart we are not a
[1:29:15] denomination he bet it's because God
[1:29:18] wants to flow his power freely through
[1:29:21] our lives
[1:29:23] amen come on come out of her my people
[1:29:25] come away from the lukewarmness come
[1:29:28] away from the denominational thinking
[1:29:30] come away from the theology amen but
[1:29:33] when the current is Flowing freely the
[1:29:36] word of God expresses itself The Works
[1:29:40] that I do shall ye be also and in the
[1:29:45] last days it shall come to pass behold I
[1:29:47] send you a lie to the prophet and he
[1:29:50] shall turn the hearts of the children
[1:29:51] back to the faith of the fathers and in
[1:29:55] there there would be a Time come forth
[1:29:58] when he could express himself in
[1:30:01] fullness of his godhead deity through
[1:30:05] his church have the preeminances in this
[1:30:09] church or my what the anointed man now
[1:30:13] the anointed people oh I love that amen
[1:30:17] what God did in Christ Christ is now
[1:30:19] doing through his church because it was
[1:30:21] God poured into Christ and now it's
[1:30:24] Christ poured into his bride to do what
[1:30:28] to express himself
[1:30:33] the anointed man now the anointed people
[1:30:37] to bring back the anointed bride in the
[1:30:41] bridegroom and he said brother Jonathan
[1:30:43] how do I how do I become anointed well
[1:30:45] the prophet answers that anointed by
[1:30:49] accepting what Eve turned down in Adam
[1:30:53] coming back with the anointing of the
[1:30:57] word because he said my word is spirit
[1:31:00] Anointed with the word
[1:31:03] oh it's a total different meaning then
[1:31:06] to hearing the word
[1:31:09] because you're not you're you're not
[1:31:11] just listening to a theory you're
[1:31:12] listening to God
[1:31:14] you're listening to an anointed word my
[1:31:17] words are spirit so we're Anointed with
[1:31:20] the word it's anointing our faith to
[1:31:25] believe you see the prophet would say
[1:31:27] like this they're crying for a messiah
[1:31:29] they're fasting they're praying they're
[1:31:30] they're doing all these things looking
[1:31:32] for a messiah he says we've got the
[1:31:34] Messiah it's the anointed word he's just
[1:31:37] looking for someone to anoint the word
[1:31:41] and make it live again how many believes
[1:31:45] he's the same yesterday
[1:31:47] today and forever
[1:31:50] you see the message has restored the
[1:31:52] faith
[1:31:55] the message has taught us to believe
[1:31:58] for all things
[1:31:59] [Music]
[1:32:00] you see the prophet would say like this
[1:32:02] as much as your faith will be released
[1:32:05] that's how much power you can have
[1:32:10] my in that mind-blowing
[1:32:14] as much as your faith will be released
[1:32:18] in other words as much as you can push
[1:32:21] beyond that unbelief barrier and just
[1:32:25] simply take God at his word
[1:32:29] as much as you can say I believe it and
[1:32:32] you begin to confess that promise and
[1:32:34] commit that word to a heart of faith and
[1:32:37] commit that promise to God and say Lord
[1:32:39] you promised it you promised it and you
[1:32:42] water that with praise and you water
[1:32:44] that with faith you you are releasing
[1:32:47] power
[1:32:50] created the world that created the
[1:32:53] universe that created the Sun that
[1:32:56] created Joy upon this Earth You Believe
[1:33:00] and release that Faith you're bringing a
[1:33:04] power of dominion and Authority supreme
[1:33:08] authority into your life
[1:33:12] [Applause]
[1:33:13] this ain't just the words of a Preacher
[1:33:16] this is supreme authority
[1:33:20] you see because in you dwells the power
[1:33:22] to make heavens and earth God dwells in
[1:33:24] you
[1:33:25] and your sons and daughters of God there
[1:33:28] you are but it's your faith
[1:33:30] Jesus said according to your faith be it
[1:33:32] unto you if thou can't believe all
[1:33:35] things are possible verily I say unto
[1:33:37] you if you say unto this mountain be
[1:33:39] moved and don't doubt but believe that

[1:33:45] squirrels
[1:33:46] it'll bring forth it'll bring forth
[1:33:49] Revival amongst lukewarmness it'll bring
[1:33:52] forth sons and daughters that are
[1:33:53] Wayward and lost and will bring them
[1:33:55] back as the family of God hallelujah

[1:34:15] world the ever presence of the great
[1:34:17] gusher of Salvation and power that

[1:34:21] church the ever presence of the Living
[1:34:23] God the great flowing spit and rock that
[1:34:25] goes with us in our journey now the
[1:34:27] prophet of God would say it like this
[1:34:29] the next thing he would say Israel lost
[1:34:32] her faith
[1:34:34] said they got off the path they began to
[1:34:37] Lust For The Flesh pots if they had
[1:34:40] stayed with faith and believing that God
[1:34:42] was taking going to take them to the
[1:34:44] land there would have been nothing
[1:34:47] hinder them they had already opened up
[1:34:49] Seas they had smoked planks upon their
[1:34:52] enemies they had crucified their enemies
[1:34:54] behind them and had walked over into the
[1:34:56] land and still couldn't have faith to go
[1:34:58] on to the promise Joshua and Caleb had
[1:35:01] that Faith they said we are more than

[1:35:08] calebs amen we are more than able to
[1:35:11] conquer anything that would come before
[1:35:13] us and the prophet of God would say
[1:35:15] that's the trouble with the church we

[1:35:19] power in us we are Sons and Daughters of
[1:35:22] God nothing can stand before us only

[1:35:33] prophet believe what God has already
[1:35:37] done for you if he standing behind this

[1:36:37] thine mouth
[1:36:40] where does your mouth speak from your
[1:36:42] heart
[1:36:43] where the Throne of God is and God by
[1:36:46] the Holy Ghost is sitting on the throne
[1:36:47] his throne you're his Dominion
[1:36:50] [Applause]
[1:36:52] a part of his domain and you are only
[1:36:55] carrying your orders carrying out the
[1:36:57] orders from the king
[1:37:00] king spirit
[1:37:02] King Holy Ghost King anointing supreme
[1:37:06] authority
[1:37:07] we therefore have the same faith and we
[1:37:10] speak it and we don't doubt it
[1:37:14] no devil in hell can shake us from it
[1:37:16] [Music]
[1:37:17] you see it's a it's got a it's got to be
[1:37:20] a hand of faith is this all right
[1:37:22] that hand of faith that depends on how
[1:37:24] strong it is
[1:37:26] this hand of Faith might just be strong
[1:37:28] enough to cut a little hole for the
[1:37:29] darkness and say by faith I'm saved
[1:37:32] that's a great cut
[1:37:34] but then if that's all the stronger that
[1:37:36] handy is to yield that sword that's all
[1:37:39] it can cut
[1:37:40] but if it's a strong hand that's what we
[1:37:43] want we want we we don't want to just
[1:37:45] settle for salvation we've got a
[1:37:47] Promised Land
[1:37:50] a geese worked a question look North
[1:37:54] look South but don't just sit there
[1:37:56] looking get up
[1:38:00] how do you get up Faith how do you get
[1:38:03] out of bed in the morning by faith how
[1:38:05] do you get dressed in the morning to
[1:38:06] come to church by faith how do you take
[1:38:09] the word and begin to walk through every
[1:38:11] Promise by faith
[1:38:15] that's mine that's mine that's mine
[1:38:18] that's mine that's mine and you take the
[1:38:20] that that hand of faith and you begin to
[1:38:23] cut it loose
[1:38:25] my inheritance oh yes sir it's a strong
[1:38:29] hand of Faith it'll come Plum through
[1:38:32] everything the devil can put out there
[1:38:34] make every promise of God shine forth in
[1:38:37] the power of his resurrection if it's a
[1:38:39] strong hand of Faith the days of
[1:38:41] Miracles Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:38:43] today and forever cut its way through it
[1:38:47] depends on the power of the hand behind
[1:38:49] the sword and again the prophet would
[1:38:52] say how can that uncircumcised enemy
[1:38:54] ever stand in the presence of the
[1:38:56] Eternal God that should be the seed of
[1:38:58] David amen that should be those anointed
[1:39:00] ones that know you're anointed to take
[1:39:02] down every Giant in this age what is
[1:39:05] that uncircumcised Philistine that
[1:39:07] uncircumcised demon amen that's trying
[1:39:10] to stand before me amen what is that in
[1:39:12] the presence of the Eternal God you take
[1:39:15] the sword of the word and every promise
[1:39:17] belongs to you pick it up in a strong
[1:39:19] head of Faith walk forward if you eat
[1:39:21] healing cut it out with the word Jesus
[1:39:24] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:39:25] forever if you need salvation every
[1:39:27] promise in the Bible is yours it's
[1:39:29] laying back the back in there and
[1:39:32] Satan's trying to hide it but take the
[1:39:35] sword and push through the darkness
[1:39:38] until the light of God shines upon your
[1:39:41] soul and you have the promise he'll do
[1:39:43] it
[1:39:45] you see the prophet would say like this
[1:39:48] it says you've got to open every door
[1:39:51] the prophet of God would take take us
[1:39:52] through the door inside the door and he
[1:39:55] would say that there's a door called
[1:39:56] faith
[1:39:57] and there's people that are trying to
[1:39:59] bar that door put a padlock and say well
[1:40:04] you know
[1:40:05] it's for others but it's not for you in
[1:40:08] the days of Miracles has passed and God
[1:40:10] don't do those things any longer but you
[1:40:12] see the prophet of God says that you you
[1:40:15] you've just got to open that door
[1:40:18] and say Lord
[1:40:20] take over my faith tonight
[1:40:23] watch what will take place sure he will
[1:40:27] take over he will rule the thing
[1:40:31] when I read that I thought I'll praise
[1:40:32] the name of the Lord God rule my faith
[1:40:36] rule my faith
[1:40:39] so possess the reins of my heart
[1:40:43] that if there's anything that stands in
[1:40:46] the way of my faith you rule it you take
[1:40:49] my faith you control my faith and push
[1:40:51] it out there and let me be a rugged
[1:40:54] Christian let me be a real soldier of
[1:40:56] the cross
[1:40:57] let me not be spineless and and weak
[1:41:00] need but let me be courageous oh God
[1:41:03] take over my heart take over my faith
[1:41:07] rule my faith
[1:41:11] whenever a spirit tries to say well you
[1:41:13] can't believe that God ruled my faith
[1:41:17] when the devil tries to come and say
[1:41:19] well you've sent away your day of Grace
[1:41:20] oh God rule my faith
[1:41:22] when I have fallen for the umpteenth
[1:41:25] time but rule my faith to get me back up
[1:41:29] are you hearing me
[1:41:31] it's not you ruling your faith it's not
[1:41:33] you that is believing these things it's
[1:41:35] an eternal Gene of God that God has
[1:41:38] taken come supreme authority over your
[1:41:41] life and he's believing for thee for
[1:41:43] things that is not even humanly
[1:41:46] intelligently reasonable
[1:41:50] right man all right you see since the
[1:41:53] Holy Ghost has come
[1:41:55] Who is the dissolver
[1:41:57] of all doubts
[1:42:00] we have been released
[1:42:02] to believe
[1:42:05] things that Through the Ages people
[1:42:07] couldn't believe for these things that
[1:42:09] we are preaching about testifying of and
[1:42:12] we believe it
[1:42:14] you see we are not lukewarm layout of
[1:42:17] sins
[1:42:18] [Music]
[1:42:21] to be categorized as a lukewarm I may be
[1:42:25] the most the most prone to make mistakes
[1:42:28] and failures while walking out this
[1:42:31] Promised Land
[1:42:32] I may be the one amen that the devil I I
[1:42:37] I'm the least of all of you but I refuse
[1:42:41] to give in to a devil that's trying to
[1:42:46] weaken my faith and say that I can't
[1:42:49] possess it when he it's Christ that I'm
[1:42:53] reflecting it's Christ that I'm standing
[1:42:56] for it's Christ that I am expressing is
[1:43:00] Christ that I am a tabernacle of
[1:43:04] he's the dissolver of all doubts he's
[1:43:08] the one that taught me to believe he's
[1:43:10] the one that's pushing me out there and
[1:43:13] saying preach it preach it preach it
[1:43:15] there it is in the word there it is
[1:43:17] Vindicated there it is proven preach it
[1:43:22] I stand like the prophet said I don't
[1:43:25] know how when you got so many that isn't
[1:43:28] believing but all I know is it's gonna
[1:43:31] happen
[1:43:33] because God by his foreign knowledge
[1:43:36] predestinated because he saw believers
[1:43:42] you saw believers
[1:43:46] yes sir you see
[1:43:50] the prophet of God was saved the
[1:43:52] dissolver of doubts now the blood of
[1:43:53] Christ takes away each stain
[1:43:56] the stain
[1:43:58] of doubt
[1:44:00] [Music]
[1:44:04] no more stains
[1:44:08] nothing for the devil I'm not talking
[1:44:11] about your spirit
[1:44:13] I'm not talking about your mind
[1:44:15] I'm talking about a faith
[1:44:18] I'm talking about a conqueror
[1:44:20] I'm talking about a king
[1:44:23] I'm talking about supreme authority I'm
[1:44:25] talking about dominion over death hell
[1:44:28] and the grave I'm talking about when the
[1:44:31] devil tries to come up in your spirit
[1:44:33] there is a king that is rolling over
[1:44:36] your spirit and says Satan shut up
[1:44:39] there's no more stain it's putting the
[1:44:42] sea of forgetfulness in the mind of God
[1:44:45] you never
[1:44:47] ever did Sin in the mind of God there's
[1:44:51] not even a stench of sin in the mind of
[1:44:54] God you never fail you never made a
[1:44:57] mistake you are The Virtuous sinless

[1:45:16] [Music]
[1:45:23] ever since Christ has come
[1:45:26] to dissolve all doubts
[1:45:29] we're living in a different atmosphere
[1:45:32] it's an atmosphere of believing
[1:45:35] it's an atmosphere of expectation
[1:45:38] it's an atmosphere of worship
[1:45:41] through revelation
[1:45:43] you see it's a different atmosphere
[1:45:46] we're soaring higher in this astronaut
[1:45:48] age
[1:45:50] than any other time in the history of
[1:45:52] the world
[1:45:53] because it's a true atmosphere
[1:45:57] of faith
[1:45:59] and we are under the anointing of the
[1:46:03] Holy Ghost which is the latter the
[1:46:06] former and the latter rain falling
[1:46:08] together
[1:46:10] it is the teaching Lane and it is the
[1:46:14] the quickening power of the Holy Ghost
[1:46:17] that is falling upon your life to make
[1:46:21] this Word Flesh in you
[1:46:24] [Music]
[1:46:27] you see I love
[1:46:29] living in an atmosphere that Satan just
[1:46:32] can't stay in
[1:46:36] and come on we gotta live let's just put
[1:46:39] our let's just put what happened
[1:46:40] yesterday put it aside
[1:46:43] what happened what you're going through
[1:46:45] and the devil's trying to enter into
[1:46:47] your thoughts right now and say preacher
[1:46:50] what gives you the right to preach those
[1:46:52] kind of things why what gives you the
[1:46:54] right to say that I am living in an at
[1:46:56] that kind of an atmosphere right now I'm
[1:46:58] not talking about church I'm talking
[1:46:59] about Sons and Daughters of God who are
[1:47:02] now sitting in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:47:05] Jesus
[1:47:06] you say what gives you the right to say
[1:47:08] those things a Vindicated Prophet that
[1:47:11] preached this message and God himself
[1:47:13] the dissolver of doubts backed it up
[1:47:16] [Music]
[1:47:19] let me just get real simple even more
[1:47:22] simple you're saved when you don't feel
[1:47:23] like you're saved
[1:47:26] and if the and the prophet of God said
[1:47:28] that if the devil can get you to doubt
[1:47:30] that you're saved that very moment is
[1:47:31] when you're lost
[1:47:33] what do you mean yes
[1:47:40] that's what you see now what you hear
[1:47:42] not what you feel now your symptoms not
[1:47:45] want you what's going on here but it's
[1:47:48] by
[1:47:50] praise the Lord
[1:47:52] that's why I believe it was Peter maybe
[1:47:55] maybe it was John
[1:47:56] that said let's not be a forgetful
[1:47:58] hearer
[1:48:00] but let us heed to the words
[1:48:04] that we have been taught don't walk out
[1:48:06] the doors and just be a forgetful hearer
[1:48:08] but take it meditate ponder it believe
[1:48:12] it
[1:48:14] digest it
[1:48:17] all right am I taking too much time
[1:48:21] you see
[1:48:22] I I believe what I said
[1:48:27] in an age in the in the in the changing
[1:48:30] of dispensations the prophet of God it
[1:48:33] is the changing of the beat it's the
[1:48:34] changing of the Rhythm it's it's the
[1:48:37] changing of of dispensations and it's at
[1:48:40] that change oh hell

[1:49:13] you you say brother brother Jonathan
[1:49:15] it's pretty bleak well if you look at it
[1:49:17] that way it is Bleak but the prophet of
[1:49:20] God said when all hell is released Oh
[1:49:23] Heaven comes down
[1:49:27] that's why we've not left the scripture
[1:49:29] for greater is he that is in me

[1:53:07] gene within him that gives him a perfect
[1:53:09] knowledge of his circumstance or did you
[1:53:12] hear me Church it is by the gene the sea

[1:57:26] faith to go into places that others can

[2:00:24] and now you're bumping into another
[2:00:27] world another dimensioner you're bumping
[2:00:30] into the anointed presence of angels
[2:00:33] that I bring in the message from the
[2:00:36] Throne of God and he's saying come you
[2:00:38] gotta come you gotta
[2:00:46] you gotta walk over your circumstance
[2:00:49] you've got to do things that no one else
[2:00:52] has ever done you gotta be an overcomer
[2:00:56] foreign

[2:01:45] that Spirit of depression is not to
[2:01:46] control you you're to control it
[2:01:50] one for the land once I don't see
[2:01:54] yeah it is under the under the feet of
[2:01:56] this bride
[2:02:01] has found the body we are putting
[2:02:04] everything under our feet
[2:02:07] [Applause]
[2:02:10] let me just say like this what what
[2:02:13] Christ did in symbol for him we are
[2:02:14] doing in reality for him
[2:02:18] did you hear me
[2:02:20] whatever he put in the Book of
[2:02:21] Revelations to the 10th chapter as a
[2:02:23] symbol form we are doing it in reality
[2:02:26] form
[2:02:28] because we have heard seven Thunders no
[2:02:31] longer in simple form but it's the voice
[2:02:33] of God saying come
[2:02:36] [Music]
[2:02:38] come
[2:02:40] possess this land
[2:02:42] put your feet on this thing
[2:02:45] put your feet on these symptoms
[2:02:48] in Heavenly places
[2:02:55] all right I'm trying my best
[2:02:59] it takes faith
[2:03:01] takes Faith to receive anything from God
[2:03:05] as your pastor is preaching these
[2:03:06] promises and I know how your pastor
[2:03:08] preaches and he's laying these promises
[2:03:10] in there it's going to take Faith
[2:03:13] it takes Faith to receive it
[2:03:14] it takes Faith through a minute
[2:03:17] because your mind is going how can that
[2:03:19] be how can that be but you see you are a
[2:03:22] different race of people
[2:03:24] [Music]
[2:03:25] this can't be preached out there
[2:03:28] they've already crucified it
[2:03:34] the only place this word will have
[2:03:37] effects
[2:03:39] is in faith
[2:03:41] and the prophet of God said we are free
[2:03:44] he predestinated Believers in this age
[2:03:46] to believe the word of the hour
[2:03:49] see
[2:03:50] you you gotta have faith
[2:03:54] will you make us whole if thou can't
[2:03:57] believe
[2:04:01] you see under that anointing
[2:04:06] all of a sudden a church service
[2:04:08] where the presence of the Lord is just
[2:04:09] sweeping
[2:04:11] you come up for prayers oh
[2:04:13] maybe maybe even just right where you're
[2:04:15] sitting said Lord I receive it I believe
[2:04:17] it
[2:04:18] and the devil says I I can't even
[2:04:20] withstand him I can't even stay here
[2:04:24] the presence of the Lord the atmosphere
[2:04:28] but you see you've got to have faith now
[2:04:31] are y'all still with me now I'm going to
[2:04:33] wind it down
[2:04:36] you you you've got to have faith to hold
[2:04:39] on
[2:04:41] [Music]
[2:04:45] you see let let's just go let's just
[2:04:47] break it down for just a minute I I've
[2:04:49] only got just a few minutes so stay with
[2:04:51] me I'm going to go fast
[2:04:52] Satan is a thief
[2:04:55] Satan is a scavenger
[2:04:59] he's looking
[2:05:01] to steal
[2:05:03] your victory
[2:05:07] oh praise the name of the Lord I dance
[2:05:09] in that church service the anointing of
[2:05:10] the Lord
[2:05:13] but the devil's a thief
[2:05:19] oh my that thing that had been haunting
[2:05:23] me and hounding me all of a sudden under
[2:05:25] the presence of the Lord oh my I haven't
[2:05:27] felt like that such Liberty and I he I
[2:05:30] know he went out those doors as whether
[2:05:32] Andrew would say open those back doors
[2:05:34] the devil's fleeing
[2:05:36] let's get him out of here
[2:05:39] but he knows your address
[2:05:42] yeah
[2:05:44] he knows where you live
[2:05:47] he's been studying you for a long time
[2:05:53] oh Satan's a thief he's going to try to
[2:05:56] steal your victory
[2:05:58] he's going to try to steal your healing
[2:06:00] I know I was healed Satan's gonna try to
[2:06:03] steal it
[2:06:04] he's going to try to steal your joy he's
[2:06:06] going to try to steal your peace he's
[2:06:08] going to try to steal your Revival he's
[2:06:11] going to try to take your contentment
[2:06:12] away from you he's going to try to steal
[2:06:14] your purpose for a living the purpose
[2:06:17] for believing this message the purpose
[2:06:19] why God called you in the first place
[2:06:22] you see he's a thief we could just keep
[2:06:25] going through things but he's also a
[2:06:27] liar
[2:06:28] he'll say you don't have the Holy Ghost
[2:06:30] when you knew you testified you stood
[2:06:33] there and you said I know God filled me
[2:06:35] with the Holy Ghost but the devil will
[2:06:37] come right back around and say now you
[2:06:40] know all you had was just a little bit
[2:06:42] of an emotional workup
[2:06:47] he'll try to tell you you don't have the
[2:06:48] Holy Ghost
[2:06:50] you know what the devil do he'll try to
[2:06:51] take your symptoms
[2:06:53] you'll stand there and say I buy his
[2:06:54] stripes I am healed and then he'll make
[2:06:56] those symptoms flare up and their those
[2:06:59] symptoms will be greater
[2:07:01] worse than ever before
[2:07:05] that's why the prophet of God said
[2:07:07] symptoms are lying vanities
[2:07:12] you say Where's that in the scripture
[2:07:14] Jonah
[2:07:17] running from the presence of the Lord
[2:07:20] Jonah trying to get away from the will
[2:07:23] of God Jonah
[2:07:26] yet in right there in the will of God
[2:07:31] and all he could see was Wells belly
[2:07:34] Wells belly Wells belly seaweed vomit
[2:07:37] stench and yet he looked at that and
[2:07:40] says it's lying vanities and he looked
[2:07:43] to the promise and he prayed and he knew
[2:07:46] that God heard his prayer
[2:07:49] [Music]
[2:07:51] right
[2:07:52] Satan's a murderer
[2:07:54] the very moment the Revelation strikes
[2:07:57] your heart there's going to be there's
[2:08:00] going to be serpent a serpent seed
[2:08:02] there's going to be there's going to be
[2:08:04] the devil trying to take that kill that
[2:08:06] revelation
[2:08:09] sure he'll try to kill Revival
[2:08:12] he'll try to kill expectation he'll try
[2:08:14] to kill the move of God he'll try to
[2:08:17] kill conviction kill Joy kill the thrill
[2:08:20] of serving God he'll afflict you with
[2:08:22] mistakes he'll afflict you at complexes
[2:08:25] he'll try to put scars in your life for
[2:08:28] one purpose and that is to try to defeat
[2:08:31] the purpose of God in your life he'll
[2:08:34] try to reason us out of the promises of
[2:08:37] God but the prophet says you have to
[2:08:40] fight to possess what you know is your
[2:08:44] own
[2:08:45] [Music]
[2:08:47] that's the way God's got to set up you
[2:08:50] have to fight to possess what you know
[2:08:53] is your own
[2:08:59] you see Satan's going to constantly
[2:09:01] punch at you until you're finished here
[2:09:03] on Earth this is quote Satan will
[2:09:05] constantly punch at you until you're
[2:09:06] finished here on Earth just remember
[2:09:09] that
[2:09:10] amen you see the prophet would take us
[2:09:12] to Elijah and I I'm trying to close but
[2:09:15] I I I I want you to just to hear this
[2:09:17] I'm gonna I want to close on this I want
[2:09:19] this I want this to show just
[2:09:22] ingraining your heart here because
[2:09:24] remember Elijah by the voice of God by
[2:09:28] the will of God he went to Mount Carmel
[2:09:30] for a showdown to prove that God is God
[2:09:35] and that great anointing that great move
[2:09:37] of God Amen Baal was destroyed amen I
[2:09:41] think it was 400 450 amen and false
[2:09:45] prophets amen were destroyed and then we
[2:09:48] find
[2:09:49] that Elijah
[2:09:51] when the anointing has left him
[2:09:55] is running for his life
[2:09:58] because of the threat of one woman
[2:10:01] the prophet of God says that we find
[2:10:03] that Elijah is under a juniper tree
[2:10:07] wishing that he would just die
[2:10:10] the day before
[2:10:12] the day before he was shouting
[2:10:15] dancing
[2:10:18] the Living God made manifest and it was
[2:10:21] all real and it was all true and it was
[2:10:24] all Victory there was nothing fake about
[2:10:26] it there was no emotional workup about
[2:10:29] it it was nothing but the truth and it
[2:10:33] was the will of God for Elijah to do
[2:10:35] what he did and now the next day he's
[2:10:38] come down from the anointing
[2:10:43] I want to tell you nothing's changed
[2:10:47] the word didn't change there were seven
[2:10:51] thousand elect that still believed the
[2:10:53] word still believed the message that
[2:10:55] we're still holding to Elijah's message
[2:10:57] but Elijah himself was saying now that
[2:11:00] the anointing has left him I'm alone
[2:11:06] just take my life I'm a failure
[2:11:11] the prophet of God was saying pastor
[2:11:13] here knows and other ministers watch
[2:11:16] after your Mount carmels you're going to
[2:11:17] have a juniper tree whenever a man has a
[2:11:20] blessing and the power of God Pours Down
[2:11:22] and does something for you look out
[2:11:24] Satan is on the track just remember the
[2:11:28] next day that Monday after a good day on
[2:11:30] Sunday it's going to be a hard thing
[2:11:33] because he's going to do everything he
[2:11:36] can to knock that confidence out of you
[2:11:39] that the Holy Spirit instilled in you
[2:11:42] the day before can we say Amen ministers
[2:11:47] but the prophet of God didn't just leave
[2:11:49] it for ministers
[2:11:51] the prophet went on to say and we each
[2:11:54] one of us have our juniper trees
[2:11:59] you see when God does something
[2:12:03] you can't start looking around at the
[2:12:06] water you can't start looking around at
[2:12:08] the waves you can't start you can't
[2:12:11] start questioning how did I get here why
[2:12:13] did I step out in faith I I was obeying
[2:12:16] the word but now look there's 30 foot
[2:12:18] waves there's there's there I I'm gonna
[2:12:21] sing you cannot get
[2:12:23] place
[2:12:24] you have got to guard your heart with
[2:12:27] the anointing you don't feel anointed
[2:12:29] anymore you don't feel like dancing
[2:12:32] anymore you don't feel like you even
[2:12:34] receive the promise you've got to hold
[2:12:37] to the word
[2:12:40] you gotta stand there and you gotta walk
[2:12:44] it whether you feel it
[2:12:47] you are doing it by faith if it Be You
[2:12:52] Lord if you have stepped into this age
[2:12:54] if this is the dispensation of the
[2:12:57] Overcomer bid me come come
[2:13:02] you got here by the word you got here by
[2:13:05] the promise and you're going to have to
[2:13:08] get to the Finish
[2:13:09] by the same
[2:13:13] I'm going through a lot of things
[2:13:15] because the prophet of God said when
[2:13:17] Peter said Jesus said come come on he
[2:13:21] says that in perfect Faith he says now
[2:13:23] come on now that's just the same as
[2:13:26] James 5 14 the same as Mark 16. the same
[2:13:31] God said it come on
[2:13:34] Lord I need healing and God says come on
[2:13:37] I need the Holy Ghost come on
[2:13:40] I want to make the Rapture come on
[2:13:42] I want to be an overcomer in this age
[2:13:44] come on
[2:13:46] but we're the ones Jesus stays the same
[2:13:49] he stays constant his word is unchanging
[2:13:52] we're the ones that get to looking
[2:13:55] around us
[2:13:57] the words not changed
[2:14:01] you're gonna when you accept that word
[2:14:04] you're going to have to fight harder
[2:14:06] than you have ever fought in your life
[2:14:11] hello
[2:14:13] all right
[2:14:15] you see the prophet says it like this
[2:14:18] I'm going to just read a few things and
[2:14:19] then I'm closing
[2:14:20] thank you
[2:14:22] see the prophet says to get the
[2:14:24] difference between what is the spirit of
[2:14:26] God and what is the spirit of the devil
[2:14:27] are y'all are y'all still with me
[2:14:30] and then by the atonement in Calvary
[2:14:32] that devil is cast out and I'll assure
[2:14:34] you if the believer will come and
[2:14:36] believe right here presently no matter
[2:14:38] what's wrong with it it'll take place
[2:14:40] right here that's right you've never
[2:14:44] seen it fail and it won't but now if you
[2:14:47] go out of here in disbelief or just with
[2:14:50] a little weak Faith it'll come right
[2:14:53] back on you even worse than what it was
[2:14:56] in the first place for the unclean
[2:14:59] Spirit goes out of a man he walks in dry
[2:15:01] places is that right then he returns
[2:15:03] back and if the good man of the house
[2:15:05] isn't there to keep him away you must
[2:15:08] take God at his word not your feelings
[2:15:12] take God at his word your faith keeps
[2:15:16] him away
[2:15:18] [Applause]
[2:15:20] your faith keeps him away just refuse it
[2:15:25] here it is I want you to listen to this
[2:15:27] he will torment
[2:15:30] and pack at your door and hot at your
[2:15:34] windows
[2:15:35] let me read it again he will torment
[2:15:38] get your door hot at your windows but
[2:15:42] just turn your head and keep looking
[2:15:45] forward towards Christ and going on
[2:15:50] [Music]
[2:15:52] oh brother brother Sean I I was shouting
[2:15:55] the victory I was rejoicing I knew that
[2:15:57] God did it I I stood upon it yeah yeah
[2:16:00] that that's right
[2:16:01] and nothing's changed
[2:16:05] but now I don't feel it now I can't even
[2:16:08] I can't even barely lift my hands I feel
[2:16:11] so condemned I feel like the joy is
[2:16:13] taken out of my heart I feel like I
[2:16:15] could barely even make it to church it's
[2:16:16] because the devil's the theme
[2:16:18] the devil's trying to steal what God did
[2:16:22] for you at cap what God did for you in
[2:16:24] the Revival what God did for you on
[2:16:27] Sunday what he did for you on Wednesday
[2:16:29] what he did for you in your car or at
[2:16:32] your house or at your prayer meeting
[2:16:38] oh brother Jonathan oh I felt the
[2:16:40] anointing
[2:16:42] and all of a sudden I was just released
[2:16:46] yep you were
[2:16:50] that's not the time to go on vacation
[2:16:52] that's the time to fill up with the word
[2:16:54] that's the time to say to the Lord just
[2:16:57] fill me with your presence fill me with
[2:16:59] faith muscles because I know he's going
[2:17:02] to come back I know he's going to try to
[2:17:04] enter in again I know he's going to try
[2:17:06] to say I don't have the Holy Ghost I
[2:17:08] know he's going to try to take my peace
[2:17:09] away from me I know that Spirit of
[2:17:11] depression is going to try to take over
[2:17:13] my mind again you've got to stand there
[2:17:16] and say Satan no more this is not your
[2:17:19] house this is the house of faith
[2:17:24] this is the strong man standing at the
[2:17:27] door grabbing that old spineless demon
[2:17:29] and kicking him back away from you and
[2:17:31] say get away from me I am free from you
[2:17:37] is this all right
[2:17:41] the prophet of God says you hear me sure
[2:17:43] you do you hear me now
[2:17:46] I told you you were healed
[2:17:49] sister
[2:17:50] don't doubt me
[2:17:53] you are healed aren't you
[2:17:56] see you can hear all right your female
[2:17:59] troubles gone too your nervousness has
[2:18:02] left you hadn't heard for years say
[2:18:05] praise the Lord the lady says praise the
[2:18:07] Lord go off the platform shouting
[2:18:10] foreign
[2:18:12] don't doubt
[2:18:14] if you doubt it'll come back on you
[2:18:16] again
[2:18:17] don't do that
[2:18:19] believe
[2:18:21] have faith in God
[2:18:23] again the prophet of God says when that
[2:18:25] enemy leaves you and then you go away
[2:18:28] and let somebody talk you out of it
[2:18:32] a little pain hit you and say well
[2:18:36] maybe it wasn't so brother are worse
[2:18:40] things coming you stand like the Rock of
[2:18:43] Ages and claim the power of the Lord
[2:18:46] Jesus Christ be healed and you shall
[2:18:49] receive what you've asked for
[2:18:54] again the prophet of God would say it
[2:18:56] like this he says
[2:18:58] under that anointing he says it's left
[2:19:00] you said but I can't keep it away from
[2:19:01] you
[2:19:03] it's your faith
[2:19:07] it's your faith
[2:19:09] you see the prophet would say like this
[2:19:11] as the musicians come
[2:19:15] it says you he says the greatest power
[2:19:18] is a committal
[2:19:20] he said you the farmer takes that seed
[2:19:22] and puts it in the ground and then he
[2:19:24] doesn't come back day after day after
[2:19:26] day digging it up seeing if there's any
[2:19:28] process seeing if there's anything
[2:19:29] happening he just commits it to the
[2:19:31] ground and leaves it alone and he goes
[2:19:33] forth just believing and praising the
[2:19:35] Lord because he knows
[2:19:38] the seed there's a law within the seed
[2:19:40] it will bring forth
[2:19:44] said he says that's the way we do
[2:19:48] we just committed to God
[2:19:52] and he says and when the seed has fallen
[2:19:55] into your heart and you'll water that
[2:19:58] seed by faith believing it'll bring
[2:20:01] forth just after
[2:20:04] it's kind
[2:20:06] brother random again he says we just
[2:20:08] have to take God's word for it and start
[2:20:11] rejoicing have you noticed in the prayer
[2:20:14] line I looked it up the other day in
[2:20:17] just hundreds of times each time brother
[2:20:19] Brandon would say go shouting
[2:20:21] go rejoicing
[2:20:23] go praising God
[2:20:25] just tape after tape brother Branham
[2:20:28] would say discernment and say you're
[2:20:30] healed then he would turn to the
[2:20:31] audience and say let's say praise the
[2:20:33] Lord
[2:20:35] then he would turn to another one and
[2:20:37] say elk you're healed and he would turn
[2:20:39] again to the audience and say let's
[2:20:41] let's just say thank you Jesus and then
[2:20:44] he would turn around and he would say
[2:20:45] okay you're healed you got this
[2:20:47] premature healed it turned right back
[2:20:49] around to the audience and let's say and
[2:20:51] let's just say hallelujah what was he
[2:20:53] doing
[2:20:54] this is what I believe he was teaching
[2:20:57] us
[2:21:01] to praise the Lord
[2:21:03] the water the word with faith he was
[2:21:06] teaching the audience how to receive
[2:21:09] what God is doing in the people's lives
[2:21:13] don't just be a spectator give him
[2:21:16] praise
[2:21:17] let's say hallelujah let's Rejoice let
[2:21:21] us give honor to him who is doing
[2:21:24] everything to end according to his word
[2:21:26] and his will
[2:21:28] [Music]
[2:21:30] but then he would give instruction that
[2:21:32] wasn't just a preacher giving
[2:21:33] instruction that was a prophet that was
[2:21:35] saying go rejoicing
[2:21:36] [Music]
[2:21:39] and then he would turn to the audience
[2:21:41] when people were getting really excited
[2:21:43] he would turn around to the audience and
[2:21:44] say now
[2:21:45] that might bother some he said but the
[2:21:47] reason they're getting excited is
[2:21:49] because God just did something in their
[2:21:52] lives
[2:21:54] and they're shouting and screaming and
[2:21:56] rejoicing and you can hear you can
[2:21:57] barely even hear Brother Branham but it
[2:21:59] didn't even bother him a bit
[2:22:03] it's because he's teaching us if you're
[2:22:06] going to reach it's
[2:22:09] to receive it
[2:22:11] when you're under that anointing that's
[2:22:13] only part of it
[2:22:16] but maintaining that
[2:22:19] when you don't feel the anointing and
[2:22:21] you're not with the church people and
[2:22:23] the church service and the musicians and
[2:22:25] everything came together so perfect and
[2:22:28] then all of a sudden God spoke
[2:22:30] that's just you just received it now you
[2:22:33] gotta keep it
[2:22:35] no hell is going to try to steal it away
[2:22:37] from you and you may have this fortified
[2:22:40] but what about this and this and this
[2:22:41] and this and this and this because the
[2:22:43] devil's a sore loser
[2:22:47] I'm sorry but we're going to have to
[2:22:48] rest in on the other side this is the
[2:22:50] not the time to rest I wish it was this
[2:22:53] is the time it's just we're fighting all
[2:22:56] hell
[2:22:58] [Music]
[2:23:02] brother Brandon say like this if you can
[2:23:04] receive God's word in your heart and
[2:23:06] water it with praises and thanks to God
[2:23:08] for giving it to you it'll grow
[2:23:13] you love him
[2:23:17] Hallelujah
[2:23:19] [Music]
[2:23:20] Elijah had his juniper tree
[2:23:26] but God never came along and rebuked him
[2:23:28] for it
[2:23:32] what God did said my tired servant
[2:23:35] he needs some food
[2:23:40] and I'm so glad
[2:23:43] that God fed him and put him into a cave
[2:23:46] the whole time was just giving him rest
[2:23:50] [Music]
[2:23:52] the fire came
[2:23:54] this came the lightning the thunder came
[2:23:58] but it never moved Elijah
[2:24:01] he said there's only one thing that I
[2:24:03] want and that is to hear the word of the
[2:24:05] Lord
[2:24:06] and when God spoke
[2:24:09] Elijah stepped forth
[2:24:11] and said here I am
[2:24:14] friends God has given us food
[2:24:17] he's given us rest
[2:24:20] but oh when God comes
[2:24:24] and just speaks to our hearts
[2:24:29] how many believe that God still speaks
[2:24:33] how many believes that God takes this
[2:24:36] same word this same Revelation this same
[2:24:38] Vindicated word and just gives fresh
[2:24:41] anointing and fresh Revelation and fresh
[2:24:44] inspiration and she speaks and speaks
[2:24:48] that speaks and it's as if we heard it
[2:24:50] for the first time and it just
[2:24:52] encourages our faith
[2:24:54] Elijah you're not alone
[2:24:59] Elijah you gotta keep fighting
[2:25:03] I'm thankful for what God did for and
[2:25:06] you know some of you young people were
