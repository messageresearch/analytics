[40:32] struggles the things that we go through
[40:34] amen if you have your Bibles let's turn
[40:37] to Proverbs 3 and 5. you happen to be in
[40:40] the house of the Lord amen it's an honor
[40:43] to be here tonight appreciate Uncle Sean
[40:45] asking us to speak tonight and I pray
[40:48] something can be said to be a blessing
[40:50] amen I believe we can come to church
[40:52] with an expectation and that expectation
[40:54] be met amen you know brother Branham
[40:56] says that uh the woman with the issue of
[40:59] blood so she had an expectation to be
[41:02] healed when she seen Jesus and her
[41:04] expectation was mad
[41:06] amen I don't believe Christ went by
[41:09] there by an accident but he knew that
[41:11] there was going to be somebody there
[41:12] with a need amen and I believe that
[41:14] there's a need tonight if there's a need
[41:16] God can meet it amen Proverbs 3 and 5
[41:19] trust in the Lord with all thine hearts
[41:21] and lead not unto thine own
[41:24] understanding in all thy ways
[41:26] acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy
[41:29] paths amen can be about our heads
[41:31] tonight dear gracious Heavenly Father
[41:33] Lord we want to thank you for your grace
[41:36] and your mercy God bringing us into your
[41:38] to your house safely Lord Lord as we
[41:40] come into this part of the service I ask
[41:43] that you would anoint me Lord As I Lay
[41:45] myself aside I ask that you would speak
[41:47] to these lips of clay Lord you know the
[41:49] needs that are in the building God and I
[41:51] ask that you would meet him tonight
[41:52] father we ask these things in your
[41:54] precious name amen you may be seated if
[41:58] I had a title tonight it would be
[42:00] changing your focus and it's a simple
[42:02] thought but I pray we can take something
[42:05] from it this evening but I believe that
[42:07] our future is based on what we focus on
[42:10] the direction that we want to go is
[42:12] based on our Focus you know if you go to
[42:15] to college and do you want to be a
[42:17] scientist and you you want to become
[42:19] something like that you're not going to
[42:21] focus on History you know you're not
[42:24] you're you're majoring going to be
[42:25] something that's not going to help you
[42:27] in that direction but you're going to
[42:29] major in something that is going to push
[42:31] you in the right direction and I believe
[42:34] there must be a direction for the bride
[42:36] you see we're not going to make a
[42:38] Rapture by accident we're not going to
[42:40] see The Body Change by accident but it's
[42:42] something that we're going to have to
[42:44] press for and find the direction you
[42:47] look at Proverbs 29 and 18 where there
[42:49] was no vision the people perish but he
[42:52] that keepeth the law happy is he so
[42:55] where there's no direction that people's
[42:57] going to perish and we see that taking
[42:59] place today there's no Direction
[43:01] people's trying to do their own thing
[43:02] they've got their own thoughts they're
[43:04] they've got their own away they're going
[43:05] and we see them the world is in a
[43:07] perishing state but I like how the
[43:09] scripture continues on to say but here
[43:11] that keepeth the law happy is he so in
[43:15] the midst of uh in the midst of chaos
[43:17] there's somebody that is living in a
[43:20] state where there's a vision and I
[43:23] believe that God has given the Bride of
[43:25] Direction you see I was in Richmond this
[43:27] morning and uh in order for me to get
[43:30] here I had to get on a road and find a
[43:32] direction to get here I didn't get here
[43:35] by accident I had my car I have the I
[43:38] have the address to get here but I
[43:40] needed something to bring me here I
[43:42] needed something to show me a direction
[43:44] even though I have the means to get here
[43:46] I have the car I had I had my phone but
[43:49] I needed to pull up my GPS pull up my
[43:51] maps put on the GPS and follow that
[43:54] direction to get here and I believe God
[43:56] has given us something to take us all
[43:59] the way to a Rapture but we got a choice
[44:01] to either let it lay dormant or to pick
[44:03] it up and follow that direction you you
[44:06] see brother Branham talks about the
[44:08] North Star he says if you're ever lost
[44:10] in the woods there's always a direction
[44:12] and I like how the certainty that he's
[44:14] gone he says there's always a Direction
[44:18] you can find the North Star he says that
[44:20] will give you a direction and he says
[44:22] Christ is that North Star he goes on to
[44:25] say now I hunt worldwide and I've been
[44:27] in the wilderness and sometimes one of
[44:29] the best he says if you can look up and
[44:31] know the direction of the North Star he
[44:34] guides you out it's a man that same if
[44:36] he's ever lost if he can only find the
[44:38] North Star he can direct himself and I
[44:41] like how he's putting that he says if
[44:43] you're lost on Earth find the North Star
[44:45] or if you're lost on the sea Ponder
[44:48] North Star so it don't matter where
[44:49] you're at you can always find the same
[44:51] God and I don't care wherever you're at
[44:54] if you're in if you're in India or in
[44:56] Africa or here in America it's the same
[44:59] God it's the same nor star that is
[45:02] guiding the bride and brother Branham
[45:04] goes on to sake and direct himself than
[45:06] the way he's going that's when he's lost
[45:08] if he can look for the North Star he's
[45:11] continuing saying if he can look for it
[45:13] we got too many people wanting to go in
[45:16] our Direction but don't know where to
[45:17] find find the direction they want to
[45:19] make a Rapture but they're looking for
[45:21] that direction in the things of the
[45:23] world the looking for that direction in
[45:26] this man's opinion or this man's idea
[45:28] there's only one way to find the
[45:31] direction that's through the message of
[45:33] the hour you see I believe the only way
[45:35] to see the supernatural in this last day
[45:38] is through the message of the hour the
[45:40] only way to see a body change in this
[45:42] day is through the message of the hour
[45:44] God has given us a Direction but it's up
[45:47] to us whether we're going to focus on it
[45:49] or not brother Branham says no other
[45:51] star shift but the North Star sits right
[45:54] in the center of the earth no matter
[45:56] where the Earth is turning that North
[45:58] Star Remains the Same so he's pointing
[46:01] out that the Earth is going to be
[46:02] rotating the Earth is moving the other
[46:04] stars are moving so you can't rely on
[46:07] the earth for Direction You Can't rely
[46:10] on the other stars for a direction you
[46:12] need to rely on a time post that ain't
[46:15] going to move it ain't going to be
[46:16] tossed to and fro so if you're relying
[46:19] on your money for your Eternal
[46:21] destination your directions off if
[46:24] you're relying on the things of the
[46:26] Earth for your direction it's going to
[46:28] be off but if you can find your
[46:30] direction in the messaging in Christ
[46:33] that's been revealed in this last day we
[46:35] don't got to be we don't we don't got to
[46:37] worry about being tossed to and fro but
[46:39] we're something's anchored on the inside
[46:42] you see but The Branding continues on to
[46:44] save it points towards towards the North
[46:46] and it's the only true star he says
[46:48] they'll be half it's it's that extremely
[46:51] North Star it gives you your direction
[46:53] and he says that's what Christ is to you
[46:56] so he goes on to say if you want to go
[46:58] to heaven if you want to be saved if you
[47:00] want to be filled with the spirit if you
[47:03] want to be christ-like he says Christ is
[47:05] your North Star so he's saying if you
[47:08] want a destination if you want to see
[47:10] the supernatural if you want to see God
[47:12] revealed on your skins you've got to
[47:14] find the right direction if she went up
[47:17] the holy ghost or if she wants to go to
[47:20] heaven you want to be saved you want to
[47:22] be filled of the spirit if you want to
[47:23] be Christ like Christ is your North Star
[47:26] if you're ever lost don't take a Creed
[47:29] he's your nurse start he's your way
[47:31] here's your direction and I believe the
[47:34] bride ain't no longer looking for a
[47:36] Direction but she's found the direction
[47:38] if something's in your midst and you're
[47:41] continuing looking you're going to go
[47:42] right by it and not focus on it you're
[47:44] not going to realize it's there but the
[47:46] bride ain't looking any longer but she's
[47:48] found the direction for a Rapture she's
[47:51] found her direction for her body change
[47:54] you see the Earth is constantly moving
[47:56] times is changing currency is changing
[47:59] the stock market is changing property
[48:01] value is changing car value is changing
[48:04] so nothing in the world nothing on the
[48:07] earth is secure everything is constantly
[48:09] changing but there's one thing we can
[48:12] anchor our life upon hanker our
[48:14] destination on hanker our family's
[48:16] destination on that's the message of the
[48:19] hour you see you can't anchor your life
[48:21] on anything because it's going to fall
[48:23] it's gonna it's gonna be washed away but
[48:26] there's something God has given us in
[48:28] this last day that we can focus on you
[48:31] see we got too many people expecting to
[48:33] be going in One Direction but their
[48:36] focus is somewhere else you see in order
[48:38] for me to get to Blacksburg from
[48:40] Richmond I had to go this direction and
[48:42] not to DC there could have been other
[48:44] places that looked more more glamorous
[48:46] I'm sure DC has more to offer than
[48:49] Blacksburg you know these other cities
[48:52] has more to offer than Blacksburg but
[48:54] there was something here that I needed
[48:57] to come to I did not have no desire to
[49:00] go to DC I did not have a desire to go
[49:03] to these other places but there was a
[49:05] desire oh Hallelujah to come to
[49:07] Christiansburg and there's no desire on
[49:09] the inside of you to go in the
[49:11] tribulation there's no desire inside of
[49:14] you to go to a hell but God is a place
[49:17] of Desire on the inside of your heart to
[49:19] make a Rapture to see a body change but
[49:22] he didn't just give a desire but he gave
[49:24] a direction to meet that desire we're
[49:27] not by yourselves trying to make a
[49:30] Rapture but God has placed a desire on
[49:32] your heart and given you something to
[49:35] meet the need giving you something to
[49:37] make that destination oh Hallelujah you
[49:39] see before the product is ever made
[49:42] there's the need for the product you see
[49:44] before the speaker was ever made there
[49:47] was something that needed to be there
[49:48] was a need that needed to be filled be
[49:50] fulfilled by their speaker the the
[49:53] inventor of the speaker didn't just say
[49:55] well you know what I'm going to make
[49:57] something I don't know what we're going
[49:58] to use it for but I'm just going to
[50:00] invent something that's going to that's
[50:02] going to relay my voice no he knew that
[50:05] there was the need for a speaker oh my
[50:08] God didn't send this message by accident
[50:10] God didn't give this direction by
[50:13] accident but he knew there was somebody
[50:15] on Earth that needed a doctor direction
[50:17] that wanted a direction there was a
[50:20] desire on the inside you know brother
[50:22] Branham says that only the predestinated
[50:24] will see this message he placed
[50:27] something on the inside that can only be
[50:29] responded that could only respond to the
[50:32] word his word responding to word you
[50:35] know brother Branham says whenever the
[50:37] eagle flew by the chicken yard and he
[50:39] says mother the baby eagle was in the
[50:42] chicken yard he says he looked up and
[50:44] realized it was Eagle to Eagle when he
[50:47] heard that scream he realized I come
[50:49] from that voice I come from that being
[50:51] and he says that's the way it is with
[50:53] the bride it's word responding to word
[50:56] when this a message come across your
[50:58] life it wasn't just another idea it
[51:01] wasn't just another opinion but it was
[51:03] the word the seed that was on the inside
[51:05] realized that's where I come from just
[51:08] like the eagle realized I come from that
[51:10] being I come from that bird the bride
[51:12] realized that this word that we're
[51:14] hearing it's a part of who I am oh
[51:20] oh something woman inside that responded
[51:22] to this direction you look at
[51:24] Ecclesiastes 11 and 3 in the clouds be
[51:28] full of rain they emptied themselves
[51:30] upon the Earth and if the tree fall
[51:32] toward the South or toward the North in
[51:35] the place where the tree falleth there
[51:37] it shall be in other words it didn't get
[51:39] there by accident if it's leaning that
[51:42] direction that's where its destination
[51:44] is going to be
[51:46] oh come on somebody if you're leaning
[51:48] towards the things of the world you
[51:50] can't expect your destination to be a
[51:52] rapture if you're leaning towards Dr
[51:55] Dobson you can't expect your destination
[51:58] to be a body change if you're leaning
[52:00] towards T.D Jakes you can't expect your
[52:03] body change to be your destination but
[52:06] if you lean towards the message not just
[52:08] lean but fall towards the message give
[52:11] everything you got towards this a
[52:13] message it will bring you to your
[52:15] destination oh my you may say what does
[52:17] focusing
[52:22] know it's the way you think the way you
[52:24] talk
[52:27] Where You Are
[53:03] as now I think the greatest president
[53:05] that we ever had was Abraham Lincoln not
[53:08] because he was a kentunkian but because
[53:10] there was a man come up from nothing in
[53:13] all the books that he ever owned from
[53:14] the time he was a young boy until the
[53:16] time he was of age almost was the Bible
[53:19] and bunions Pilgrim's Progress he says
[53:22] see that molded into him he says what
[53:25] that honest ape he says what you read
[53:27] what you do merge your character and
[53:30] tells what you are so what you feed upon
[53:34] what you focus on is emoting the
[53:36] character of who you are but the Branham
[53:39] says what is your character it's who you
[53:41] are when you're by yourself it's what
[53:43] you do when you're by yourself he says
[53:45] when nobody's looking your character
[53:47] expresses itself and he says watch God
[53:49] coming after he's coming after character
[53:52] so what influences you is emoting your
[53:55] character oh my I think if ever got a
[53:58] revelation of that we would be careful
[54:00] from what we listened to what we watch
[54:02] what we think about it's a Tonka it's
[54:04] consistently emoting our character you
[54:07] look at First Peter 3 or 1-13 wherefore
[54:10] gird up the loins of your mind be sober
[54:12] and hope to the end for the grace that
[54:15] is brought unto you at the revelation of
[54:17] Jesus Christ the word gerd means to
[54:19] secure it means to secure I'm not going
[54:22] to secure myself but just anything but
[54:25] God has given me something to secure
[54:27] myself with you look at Ephesians 6 and
[54:29] 13 wherefore take unto you the whole
[54:32] armor of God that you may be able to
[54:34] withstand in the evil day having done
[54:36] all to stand so in order to stand in
[54:39] this last day we've got to take the
[54:41] whole armor of God
[54:42] come on now we gotta take the whole
[54:44] armor of God in order to stand not just
[54:47] portions not just a little bit but the
[54:49] whole armor of God the next verse says
[54:51] this stand therefore having your loins
[54:54] Gert about with truth
[54:56] not man's opinions not men's ideas but
[54:59] we gotta gird ourselves with truth and
[55:01] you see why why do we gotta gird
[55:03] ourselves for because then the mind is
[55:05] where the reproduction happens brother
[55:07] Branham says hey before Eve ever before
[55:10] the act ever took place in the Garden of
[55:12] Eden he says she accepted it in her mind
[55:15] come on now so before you ever backslide
[55:19] if you backslide in your mind before
[55:21] somebody ever leaves the church it
[55:24] happens in their mind already oh my you
[55:27] see brother Sean's a probably a witness
[55:28] of this man back home we've had so many
[55:31] young people raised up throughout our
[55:33] church and that they they come up
[55:34] wearing skirts they have their long hair
[55:36] their wonder and influence but wait till
[55:39] they get 15 16 17 18. they started to
[55:42] leave the church and what happens they
[55:44] start putting pants on they start to cut
[55:47] their hair because the influence that
[55:49] they was focusing on was now disrupted
[55:52] by another influence
[55:55] you can come to church but if your
[55:57] influence is something else it's going
[56:00] to mold your character
[56:01] oh come on somebody well you see two
[56:04] times a week three times a week ain't
[56:06] good enough for you to make a Rapture
[56:08] it's got to be something that somebody
[56:10] is doing at their homes on their jobs
[56:13] when they're working wherever you're at
[56:15] your focus has got to be the message of
[56:18] the hour you see too many times we put
[56:21] all the responsibility on the pastor
[56:23] it's the pastor's job to pray it's the
[56:25] pastor's job to study the message it's
[56:28] the pastor's job to read the books and
[56:30] and to listen to The Prophet but it's
[56:32] not along the pastor the pastor ain't
[56:34] the church you're the church
[56:37] this building is not a church unless
[56:39] you're here and so God is coming after a
[56:42] bride that don't got spot and don't got
[56:44] wrinkled but that's not happening by The
[56:47] Prophet by the pastor's Revelation it's
[56:49] by somebody else getting into the
[56:51] message for themselves focusing their
[56:54] lives and their families and their homes
[56:56] on this a message you see not just the
[56:59] pastor not just the deacons not just the
[57:02] song leaders but there's got to be
[57:04] somebody else expecting a Rapture
[57:06] somebody else expecting a body change
[57:09] it's not just the prophet that God is
[57:11] going to raise up again it's mamas and
[57:13] daddies and sisters and husbands the God
[57:16] is coming after oh my hope this is okay
[57:19] this evening you see these things don't
[57:21] happen by accident this started to
[57:23] strike me whenever I was studying on
[57:25] these things it don't happen by accident
[57:27] Uncle Sean you didn't lose all that
[57:29] weight by accident it was him focusing
[57:32] and and being determined and letting
[57:34] himself know I'm doing this I've got in
[57:37] results I'm not happy with where I'm at
[57:40] but I've got a destination and there's
[57:43] got to be a church that is saying I'm
[57:45] not happy in the middle of this here I
[57:48] want to go home I want to get out of
[57:50] here but there's only one way we're
[57:52] going to get out of here that's through
[57:54] the message of the hour
[57:56] that's through the message of the hour
[57:58] we're not going to get out of here by
[58:00] man's Creeds and dogmas but there's got
[58:02] to be a focus we gotta focus on the
[58:05] right influence Hallelujah we gotta
[58:08] Focus brother Branham says that's how
[58:10] adultery says just a minute he says
[58:12] that's how adultery is committed
[58:14] spiritually when you knowing better by
[58:17] the word of God by the Intercourse of
[58:19] the Mind take a lie of the devil against
[58:21] the word of God that's exactly what Eve
[58:24] done with spiritual intercourse first
[58:26] they'll come by believing Satan's lie
[58:28] into the womb of her mind that polluted
[58:31] her soul Steph said into her so then the
[58:34] natural act took place
[58:36] he says before the natural act ever took
[58:39] place her soul was already polluted
[58:42] oh my we can preach there count me Uncle
[58:45] Sean before you ever tell a liar your
[58:47] Soul's already polluted
[58:49] before you already start gossiping and
[58:52] backbiting this and backbiting that one
[58:54] hey I'm preaching now before these
[58:56] things ever started happening your soul
[58:58] is already polluted because of the
[59:00] influence
[59:02] oh my soul before you start talking
[59:05] about this one and that one you're
[59:07] already polluted but I believe there's
[59:09] another influence that we can be under
[59:11] that we're no longer being polluted but
[59:13] we're being uplifted we're not here to
[59:15] be polluted we're here to be a city that
[59:19] is sit on a hill we're to be a witness
[59:21] of the resurrection power of Jesus
[59:24] Christ you see the same thing happened
[59:26] with Mary brother Branham says no it's
[59:28] Mary's room Mary's womb the physical
[59:30] mind scene was a virgin womb see or she
[59:33] believed God's word no matter how much
[59:35] anybody criticized how many things
[59:37] somebody else said and that didn't have
[59:40] one thing to do with it she believed
[59:42] God's word regardless oh I wish I could
[59:45] just get that over are you getting it
[59:47] see first was in her mind before the act
[59:50] ever took place in her literal womb the
[59:53] ACT had taken place in here
[59:56] what is what what is being influenced by
[59:59] the things of the world at your mind
[1:00:02] before I'm ever speaking it's my mind
[1:00:04] telling me what to speak before I walk
[1:00:07] it's my mind telling me to walk so
[1:00:09] whenever you're out in the world I hope
[1:00:11] this is okay this evening you see I
[1:00:13] believe that we can still be working on
[1:00:15] job sites how many's ever been to it to
[1:00:17] a grocery store and you hear a song
[1:00:19] playing and all of a sudden your your
[1:00:20] foot starts to happen to it it's not
[1:00:22] that you're listening to it you've never
[1:00:24] heard the song before it's that music
[1:00:26] that is influencing your body it's
[1:00:29] influence in your mind and now you're
[1:00:30] all of a sudden without even thinking
[1:00:32] about it you start to tap your foot or
[1:00:34] you ever work around people that cuss
[1:00:37] you never cussed a day in your life but
[1:00:39] you get upset and a cuss word pops up in
[1:00:42] your mind you might not say it but it
[1:00:44] pops up it's not that you're dwelling on
[1:00:47] those things but your influence that
[1:00:49] you're around and if you're not being
[1:00:51] girded up with the things of God those
[1:00:54] influences is going to start to merge
[1:00:56] your character
[1:00:57] to move somebody but if that can happen
[1:01:00] in the the colonel how can it happen
[1:01:03] with the spiritual or it can happen with
[1:01:05] the spiritual not by the things of the
[1:01:07] world but by getting in the thanks of
[1:01:10] God changing our Focus changing our diet
[1:01:12] changing our habits changing our
[1:01:15] influence and watch we become a
[1:01:17] Powerhouse for the things of God you
[1:01:19] want to see a Revival happen a Faith
[1:01:22] Tabernacle get under the right influence
[1:01:24] you want to see God move through the
[1:01:26] aisles move across the congregation get
[1:01:28] under the right influence the pastor
[1:01:31] ain't bringing the Revival the church is
[1:01:33] bringing the Revival come on somebody
[1:01:35] watch a church that gets together in one
[1:01:39] Unity One Accord under One Direction
[1:01:41] watch God come on the scene come on
[1:01:44] somebody watch God come on the scene to
[1:01:47] the 120 that was in the upper room the
[1:01:49] Bible says they were together in one
[1:01:51] Accord they weren't doing their own
[1:01:53] things they weren't divided you want to
[1:01:55] see the devil wreak havoc among the
[1:01:57] church let Division come
[1:01:59] come on now let the vision come and let
[1:02:02] this one get together and this one over
[1:02:04] here gets together and it's backbiting
[1:02:06] and I hope this is okay Uncle Sean this
[1:02:08] has taken place and there's division
[1:02:10] happening and that's why every Bible
[1:02:12] can't fall but let Brothers come
[1:02:14] together and sisters come together Unity
[1:02:16] come together watch the power of God
[1:02:18] watch the power of God fall in Faith
[1:02:22] Tabernacle hey you've got a Revival

[1:02:30] preparation for Revival now is the time
[1:02:33] to get our bitterness now is the time to

[1:02:48] things right because there's a Revival
[1:02:50] coming up come on somebody these things
[1:02:53] don't happen by accident but somebody
[1:02:56] has to have a Direction
[1:02:58] somebody has to have a direction and I
[1:03:02] believe this message has given us a
[1:03:04] direction oh you see Uncle Sean don't
[1:03:06] get people in here that preaches the
[1:03:08] trinity
[1:03:09] that's the wrong direction he don't get
[1:03:11] somebody in here that preaches to be
[1:03:14] sprinkled that's the wrong direction
[1:03:17] how many to do that in our home lives
[1:03:21] come on somebody we know the direction
[1:03:24] that the prophet has given us
[1:03:27] oh my brother Brandon says influence one
[1:03:30] Minister's Wife let down and did this
[1:03:32] one Minister started so and so the rest
[1:03:34] just started oh my and we like us are
[1:03:37] here he says let nothing influence us
[1:03:39] but the word of God let that be our
[1:03:42] influence he says bring ourselves back
[1:03:44] to the faith back to the correction of
[1:03:47] the scriptures no matter what the rest
[1:03:49] of the world is doing he says let's let
[1:03:52] the word be your influence let the word
[1:03:54] motor character let this mode our
[1:03:57] character Hallelujah you're seen you see
[1:04:00] these things hope this is okay it don't
[1:04:02] happen by accident oh you look my
[1:04:04] opening scripture Proverbs 3 3 and 5
[1:04:06] trust in the Lord with all thine hearts
[1:04:09] and lean not unto thy own understanding
[1:04:12] and so he's saying here there's got to
[1:04:14] be a choice where you're not leaning
[1:04:16] towards your own thoughts you're not
[1:04:18] leaning towards your own opinions but
[1:04:20] you've got to make a choice the next
[1:04:22] verse in all of thy ways so not just
[1:04:25] part parts of the ways not just when
[1:04:27] you're church but on the everyday life
[1:04:29] he acknowledge Him and He Shall direct
[1:04:32] thy past so before he can direct your
[1:04:35] past you could acknowledge Him before he
[1:04:39] can give you a direction you've got to
[1:04:41] acknowledge Him and the word acknowledge
[1:04:43] means to recognize the rights or the
[1:04:46] authority of so before this message can
[1:04:49] give you a Direction You Gotta recognize
[1:04:51] it as your Authority not as an opinion
[1:04:54] but as your Authority as your direction
[1:04:57] then watch God start to lead you and
[1:04:59] guide you into this message you see you
[1:05:02] can't operate this message like a Creed
[1:05:04] and a tradition and expect it to
[1:05:06] Direction
[1:05:08] come on now you can't expect it to work
[1:05:11] for you if you're operating it in the
[1:05:13] wrong way you see where I used to do
[1:05:15] landscape Daniel the Landscaping we got
[1:05:16] zero turns you can't expect that zero
[1:05:19] tone to work if you're pushing it it's
[1:05:22] not meant to be pushed a push mower you
[1:05:25] can't jump and sit on it and expect it
[1:05:27] to work you can kick it and fuss about
[1:05:29] it and throw it in the trash and see
[1:05:31] that thing is crazy it's not working
[1:05:33] right it's not that it wasn't working
[1:05:35] right you was operating get wrong
[1:05:38] come on somebody we gotta operate it
[1:05:41] like it's meant to be operated
[1:05:44] Hallelujah we gotta operator you see
[1:05:46] brother Branham says we're miniature
[1:05:48] creators he says we can create an
[1:05:50] atmosphere he talks about I was reading
[1:05:52] earlier he was talking about how
[1:05:54] whenever he come home and his wife was
[1:05:56] in a bad mood because of the the
[1:05:58] children I believe and he says what he
[1:06:00] did was he went he started washing the
[1:06:02] dishes he started humming a song and he
[1:06:04] said watch the atmospheres change he
[1:06:06] created an atmosphere but then he said
[1:06:09] something that stood out to me he says
[1:06:11] that don't just happen at home but that
[1:06:13] happens in the church
[1:06:16] if that wasn't something that happened
[1:06:18] by accident he had a choice that said
[1:06:21] you know what I'm not letting this thing
[1:06:23] control me
[1:06:25] I'm not letting the situation bog down
[1:06:28] my faith I'm not letting this situation
[1:06:31] control me but I'm a miniature Creator
[1:06:33] and I'm going to create the right
[1:06:36] atmosphere but what about the church I'm
[1:06:39] not gonna let the first thing and this
[1:06:41] and that control me I'm going to create
[1:06:43] the right atmosphere I'm going to come
[1:06:46] to church and lift my hands I'm going to
[1:06:47] Worship the Lord I'm gonna say Amen to
[1:06:49] the preacher I'm going to say Amen to
[1:06:51] the pastor I'm going to create the right
[1:06:54] atmosphere because in the right
[1:06:56] atmosphere all things are possible
[1:06:58] we weren't healing but we don't want the
[1:07:00] right direction we want Deliverance but
[1:07:02] we don't want the right direction but
[1:07:04] create the atmosphere and in that
[1:07:06] atmosphere you can be healed you can be
[1:07:09] set free you can be repealed with the
[1:07:11] Holy Ghost you can have a renewing but
[1:07:14] it takes a choice it takes somebody
[1:07:16] saying I'm going to do this I'm going to
[1:07:19] create the right atmosphere I'm going to
[1:07:22] create and go in the right direction
[1:07:25] I want to see my family on fire I want
[1:07:28] to see my loved ones on fire I want to
[1:07:30] see my church on fire I want to see the
[1:07:33] glory of God fall like never before I
[1:07:36] want to see it happen so I'm going to do
[1:07:39] something about it
[1:07:40] I'm going to pray for the services I'm
[1:07:43] going to get up early before Sunday
[1:07:45] morning and say God anoint your pastor
[1:07:49] come on somebody I'm going to get here
[1:07:51] early on a Wednesday night and say God
[1:07:53] anoint the song leader anoint the
[1:07:55] preacher cause I gotta need the only way
[1:07:58] I'm going to get my need met is by
[1:08:00] creating the atmosphere
[1:08:02] oh my the only way I'm gonna see the
[1:08:06] Supernatural is by me doing something
[1:08:08] about it
[1:08:09] oh my do you believe that this evening
[1:08:11] we got to do something about it we got
[1:08:14] to let some things go we got to let the
[1:08:16] things go it reminds me of The Story of
[1:08:18] Lazarus the Bible says that Lazarus was
[1:08:21] identified as dead
[1:08:23] and I just love that portion of
[1:08:24] scripture Jesus never called him Lazarus
[1:08:27] he called him dead
[1:08:29] you never notice that his identity was
[1:08:31] gone because he was among the tombs his
[1:08:34] identity was gone because he was dead
[1:08:36] even though he had a previous identity
[1:08:38] but in his dead state that identity was
[1:08:41] gone but there was somebody that was
[1:08:43] coming to restore that identity and you
[1:08:46] notice what did Jesus say he come to the
[1:08:49] grave and he says Lazarus come forth the
[1:08:52] the the the the previous scriptures he
[1:08:54] was saying he's dead
[1:08:56] he's among the dead he that was dead
[1:08:59] he's continually calling him dead until
[1:09:01] he cries out the Bible says he cried
[1:09:04] with a loud voice it was that voice that
[1:09:07] restored the identity of Lazarus he
[1:09:09] didn't call him dead any longer but he
[1:09:12] caught him by his original identity and
[1:09:14] as that identity come to Lazarus he
[1:09:17] started to respond but you notice the
[1:09:19] story don't end there as they come out
[1:09:21] of the Tomb the Bible says Jesus looked
[1:09:24] at him and he says loose him and let him
[1:09:26] go but you notice the only part of the
[1:09:29] body that Jesus uh specifies is his
[1:09:32] mouth
[1:09:33] to notice that he says loose him and let
[1:09:36] him go he was bound with grave clothes
[1:09:37] and there was a napkin about his face
[1:09:40] about his mouth oh come on you can't
[1:09:43] Worship the Lord if you're in grave
[1:09:45] clothes
[1:09:46] come on somebody you can't sing if your
[1:09:48] mouth is bound you can't say Amen if
[1:09:51] your mouth is bound we've been called
[1:09:53] out their identity has been restored but
[1:09:55] we gotta let some things go
[1:09:57] Lazarus had to let those grave clothes
[1:10:00] go Lazarus how to let those things go he
[1:10:03] couldn't reconnected expect to come out
[1:10:06] of that tomb and to Worship the Lord in
[1:10:08] those gray clothes and neither can we
[1:10:10] expect to Worship the Lord if we're
[1:10:13] hanging on to bitterness if we're
[1:10:15] hanging on the complexes if we're
[1:10:16] hanging on to the things of the world I
[1:10:19] say it's time though we let them go and
[1:10:21] see I've been called out of the Tomb
[1:10:23] I've been caught out of sins I've been
[1:10:25] caught out of traditions and I'm leaving
[1:10:27] those things behind me I'm not taking
[1:10:30] them with me oh you see if you take
[1:10:32] things with you they're constantly going
[1:10:34] to be pulling you back you look at the
[1:10:36] children of Israel they was called out
[1:10:38] of Egypt but they still had things of
[1:10:40] Egypt that their heart was still in
[1:10:43] Egypt and they were constantly wanting
[1:10:45] to go back to the the task masters of
[1:10:48] Egypt that's what happens whenever you
[1:10:50] can't let things go you're constantly
[1:10:53] being pulled back in the opposite
[1:10:55] direction but they're seeing that if you
[1:10:57] can let things go we're not being pulled
[1:10:59] back we're not going backwards but this
[1:11:01] message is pulling us forward
[1:11:04] Hallelujah God is coming after a bride
[1:11:07] with the spot and without wrinkle he's
[1:11:10] given you a Direction let those things
[1:11:12] go it's time to let those behooled sins
[1:11:15] go it's time to let the bitterness go
[1:11:18] hallelujah it's time to let it go and
[1:11:21] follow the direction
[1:11:23] oh but what I love about the the story
[1:11:26] is it wasn't Jesus the loose Lazarus he
[1:11:30] anointed somebody to loosen
[1:11:33] come on now he said loose him it wasn't
[1:11:36] Jesus coming and physically losing
[1:11:38] Lazarus but under his voice under his
[1:11:42] authority he gave a five-fold Ministry
[1:11:44] the authority to loose them and to let
[1:11:47] him go
[1:11:49] come on now God has given you a pastor
[1:11:52] and under this voice there's an
[1:11:54] authority to loose you from complexes to
[1:11:57] loose you from the traditions of men to
[1:12:00] loose you from behind sins it's not that
[1:12:03] your pastor has a special ability it's
[1:12:05] under this voice under this a message
[1:12:08] has been an authority given to him
[1:12:11] Hallelujah and every time your pastor's
[1:12:14] getting up and preaching the message
[1:12:15] those grave clothes are coming off every
[1:12:18] time he preaches another message Another
[1:12:20] Sunday morning Another Sunday night
[1:12:22] another Wednesday night that napkin is
[1:12:25] coming off your face what is it that
[1:12:27] message that that that he's been
[1:12:29] commissioned with is loosening you
[1:12:32] and you can praise God like never before
[1:12:35] you can lift your hands like never
[1:12:37] before you can worship I can never
[1:12:39] before it's time to let those grave
[1:12:42] clothes go
[1:12:43] it's time to take the napkin off of your
[1:12:46] worship come on somebody It's Time To
[1:12:49] Worship it's time to praise but you
[1:12:52] can't do it with those old grave clothes
[1:12:55] Hallelujah
[1:12:57] oh my
[1:13:00] hope this is okay
[1:13:02] but the Branham says that's the reason
[1:13:04] we got so much perverted teaching of the
[1:13:06] Bible instead of coming back to the
[1:13:08] blueprints they've taken the spirit of
[1:13:11] some denominations see but the word is
[1:13:13] just as foreign to them as it was when
[1:13:16] Jesus come forth It's not that the word
[1:13:18] is gone but they've come under another
[1:13:20] influence
[1:13:22] come on what a brother Branham say how
[1:13:23] what did Jesus say they've made the word
[1:13:25] of God of no effect because of their
[1:13:27] Traditions it wasn't that their
[1:13:29] traditions did it it was the influence
[1:13:31] of their traditions and brother Branham
[1:13:34] says and they want to say the days the
[1:13:36] Miracles are passed and so forth let
[1:13:38] them go ahead and say it but let us do
[1:13:41] the service for the Lord they hated him
[1:13:43] because they were jealous of him that's
[1:13:45] the only reason they were jealous they
[1:13:47] were trying to destroy his influence
[1:13:50] before the people
[1:13:51] the same as they're doing now he says if
[1:13:54] faith can destroy the influence of the
[1:13:56] message before the people they've got
[1:13:58] this thing whipped
[1:14:00] oh mind you catch that he says if if
[1:14:03] they can destroy the influence of this
[1:14:06] message among the people this whole
[1:14:08] thing is whipped
[1:14:10] God sent the prophet gave indication
[1:14:12] after Vindication but if there's
[1:14:14] somebody under the wrong influence it's
[1:14:16] all in vain
[1:14:18] come on now that there's a
[1:14:20] responsibility not just on the pastor
[1:14:22] not just on the prophet but on us as
[1:14:24] individuals what is going to influence
[1:14:28] us
[1:14:29] Hallelujah what do we see when we're
[1:14:32] looking at it what do we see brother
[1:14:33] Brandon would say if men come out there
[1:14:35] he's talking about the the the brass
[1:14:37] serpent the Moses lifted up he says if
[1:14:39] men come out there and uh to look at it
[1:14:42] just as an item to look upon that
[1:14:44] serpent they would receive nothing he
[1:14:47] says but when the True Believer come out
[1:14:48] there and looked upon that serpent with
[1:14:51] the revealed spiritual truth that that
[1:14:53] serpent itself being that it was the
[1:14:55] form of the form of judgment from that
[1:14:58] from the serpent from the Garden of Eden
[1:15:00] the serpent was made out of brass that
[1:15:02] means divine Divine judgment see the
[1:15:05] altar was made out of brass which
[1:15:07] sacrifice was offered upon the brass
[1:15:09] Divine judgment but the only way that
[1:15:12] you could receive the benefits of that
[1:15:15] judgment was for you to look at it in
[1:15:17] the right way
[1:15:18] he says if they come out and looked at
[1:15:21] it as an idol it did nothing for him but
[1:15:23] I love how he puts it but when the True
[1:15:25] Believer come out there and looked upon
[1:15:27] it not a make-believer but a True
[1:15:29] Believer with the revealed spiritual
[1:15:31] truth something started to take place
[1:15:34] oh but the brand of preaches message
[1:15:36] after message he looked on the way to
[1:15:38] Jesus look I'm looking unto Jesus he
[1:15:41] continually is asking the question what
[1:15:43] do you see when you look what are you
[1:15:46] focusing on what do you see and brother
[1:15:48] Branham says here what do you see when
[1:15:50] you look some look the same when they
[1:15:52] look at him they look to see some great
[1:15:54] intellectual Church founder somebody who
[1:15:57] can really produce a Creed that will
[1:15:58] cause all the people to fall for this
[1:16:00] create something or another that's what
[1:16:02] they see when they look at him he says
[1:16:05] some look to see a myth like Santa Claus
[1:16:07] when they look out and they read the
[1:16:08] Bible and say oh that's a mythical thing
[1:16:11] it's just something that man wrote
[1:16:13] that's what they see what opinion you
[1:16:15] take of the Bible is what you take of
[1:16:17] him see some look to see a baby some
[1:16:20] look to see a rabbit or Santa Claus some
[1:16:23] look to see a historical book that was
[1:16:25] yesterday and not today but the question
[1:16:27] is what do you see when you look you can
[1:16:31] look upon it but it has to be revealed
[1:16:33] to you in order for you to see it
[1:16:36] you see if I'd never seen a microphone
[1:16:39] before I could look upon it but in order
[1:16:41] for me to understand it I would have to
[1:16:43] have somebody reveal it to me
[1:16:45] remember brother Branham tells the story
[1:16:47] about the uh John spro I believe he was
[1:16:50] walking through the garden overseas and
[1:16:52] he's seen a statue of Christ and he
[1:16:54] started to criticize it he says now
[1:16:56] there's no suffering to it there's
[1:16:57] nothing to that statue why would they
[1:16:59] even put that up there but then there
[1:17:01] was a guide that says you're looking at
[1:17:03] it the wrong way in order for you to see
[1:17:06] it like it's meant to be seen you got to
[1:17:08] change your direction you got to come
[1:17:10] down and Nila pee Altar and look up at
[1:17:13] him and as he knelt down and looked up
[1:17:15] at it he's seen this these scenes such
[1:17:18] suffering that'll broke his heart but in
[1:17:20] order for him to see the power of it he
[1:17:23] had to look at it the right way but in
[1:17:26] order for him to look at it the right
[1:17:28] way he needed somebody to direct him
[1:17:31] Hallelujah and there was a guide there
[1:17:33] that wasn't there for himself that guide
[1:17:36] wasn't there that point back to himself
[1:17:38] or to talk about himself but that guy's
[1:17:40] responsibility was to give him a
[1:17:43] direction to see the power of that
[1:17:45] statue and we had a messenger in this
[1:17:48] last day that wasn't pointing back to
[1:17:50] himself but he was pointing to Christ
[1:17:52] and saying look at the scripture this
[1:17:55] way not like a man man's Creed your
[1:17:57] ideas but he gave us a Direction Where
[1:18:00] We can see that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:18:03] yesterday today and forever he changed
[1:18:06] the way he looked at scripture now we're
[1:18:09] no longer looking at an imaginary God
[1:18:11] but we see that Jesus Christ is not
[1:18:14] something in her imagination but it's a
[1:18:17] reality that he can still heal he can
[1:18:19] still set free the message has brought
[1:18:22] Christ back into Focus where we can see
[1:18:25] him through reality we're not trying to
[1:18:28] work something up not trying to work our
[1:18:30] faith up but this the message has
[1:18:33] brought our faith to us we can't help
[1:18:35] but believe for the supernatural we
[1:18:37] can't help but believe for the
[1:18:39] impossible we can't help but believe for
[1:18:42] the Rapture this a message has restored
[1:18:45] such a faith oh my John spro couldn't
[1:18:48] help but see the power of that statue
[1:18:52] he didn't have to work something up he
[1:18:54] didn't have to pray Hail Marys he didn't
[1:18:56] have to fast and pray all he needed was
[1:18:59] somebody to tell him how to look
[1:19:02] come on somebody you don't gotta work
[1:19:04] this up you just needed somebody to tell
[1:19:07] you how to look look and live look at
[1:19:11] Jesus and live Christ has been revealed
[1:19:17] that we gotta work something up for the
[1:19:20] semester to become flesh again
[1:19:22] no all you need to do is come under the
[1:19:25] influence of it
[1:19:27] man you can take somebody that drinks
[1:19:29] they may be the calmest the meekest
[1:19:31] person but let them start to drink it
[1:19:33] changes the way they act they didn't
[1:19:35] have to go to school for it but
[1:19:37] something influenced them you know my
[1:19:39] wife Loretta is from Ohio way up in the
[1:19:42] north you know so whenever she come to
[1:19:44] Oklahoma she didn't say y'all she didn't
[1:19:47] talk like a southerner but let her come
[1:19:49] under our influence she's been there for
[1:19:51] four years now now her sisters make fun
[1:19:53] of her because she sounds like a
[1:19:55] southerner she didn't have to go to a
[1:19:57] college she didn't have to go to a
[1:20:00] seminary come on now you don't gotta go
[1:20:02] to a seminary to make this message Live
[1:20:04] come on now God needs somebody to come
[1:20:07] under the influence of it how does that
[1:20:09] happen by focusing on it focusing your
[1:20:12] life on it focusing your time on it
[1:20:14] listen to the tapes and watch the
[1:20:17] message come off of the books off of the
[1:20:19] computers and into skins once again oh
[1:20:23] and it's becoming what you think about
[1:20:24] it's becoming what you talk about it's
[1:20:26] been come your ideas
[1:20:28] Hallelujah then watch God start to work
[1:20:31] through your skins
[1:20:33] watch God start your work and prove to
[1:20:36] the devil that he's got a bride on Earth
[1:20:38] how does how is God proving to the world
[1:20:41] that there's a bride on Earth through
[1:20:42] your skins come on now it's through your
[1:20:45] skins through your body through through
[1:20:47] your appetites through your everyday
[1:20:49] life you're proven to the devil the God
[1:20:52] is alive and is walking on Earth just
[1:20:55] like he did when Jesus was on Earth the
[1:20:57] message is influencing some lives
[1:21:00] hallelujah it's influencing some lives
[1:21:04] we're not working it up but we're being
[1:21:07] influenced by it are you being
[1:21:09] influenced by it this evening
[1:21:11] hallelujah it's changing to our it's
[1:21:13] changing our Outlook you see too many
[1:21:15] people don't like to change their focus
[1:21:17] because changing Focus means change
[1:21:21] means you're going to lose focus of this
[1:21:23] and now gain a focus over here I know
[1:21:26] we've got some hunters in the in the
[1:21:27] building up in Oklahoma we're going
[1:21:29] through our Hill and we're all looking
[1:21:31] through binoculars right we're all
[1:21:33] looking and he got got some of the boys
[1:21:35] like Austin and Nathaniel and I'm sure
[1:21:37] Judah is one of them every doe they see
[1:21:39] it's a monster buck and you can be
[1:21:41] looking at a buck over here but you hear
[1:21:44] somebody say hey look there's a buck and
[1:21:46] you take your attention off of this and
[1:21:49] look over here you may find the doe but
[1:21:51] you lost your buck
[1:21:53] come on now so changing Focus means
[1:21:56] you're losing sight of one thing and
[1:21:58] putting your sign on something else
[1:22:01] so putting your focus on the message
[1:22:03] means you're going to lose sights of
[1:22:05] your favorite opinions I'm preaching now
[1:22:08] putting your focus on the message you're
[1:22:11] losing you're losing sides of those
[1:22:12] feelings and the bitterness that you've
[1:22:14] held for years if you can just change
[1:22:16] your focus all of those things is going
[1:22:19] to fall away change in Focus means you
[1:22:22] might have to lay off on the makeup or
[1:22:24] or throw away the earrings or or throw
[1:22:27] out some clothes that's too tight
[1:22:28] changing Focus means change and that's
[1:22:31] why we don't like changing our Focus but
[1:22:34] if there's ever a time to change Focus
[1:22:36] it's now it's now is the time to put our
[1:22:40] focus on what God has given us in this
[1:22:42] last day if it rubs me wrong let it rub
[1:22:45] me wrong if it burns my high little burn
[1:22:47] my hide I've got a direction I've got a
[1:22:50] destination I've got a place that I'm
[1:22:53] wanting to go left this a message change
[1:22:55] me let it change me it's my focus let it
[1:22:59] change the way my address let it change
[1:23:02] the way I talk it's my focus
[1:23:05] it's my focus
[1:23:07] but the Bantam says we must focus our
[1:23:09] lives not on what somebody else says but
[1:23:12] focus our lives to him and he is the
[1:23:14] word see if we get our lives lined up
[1:23:17] with the word then the word and our life
[1:23:20] becomes the same
[1:23:22] it becomes the same so no longer is it
[1:23:25] the word doing its own thing and we're
[1:23:27] doing their own thing but our life has
[1:23:29] become one the Bride In Christ has
[1:23:33] become one like I said earlier my mouth
[1:23:35] only speaks what my mind says my body
[1:23:38] only moves to where my my head tells me
[1:23:41] to move but you take somebody that is
[1:23:43] brain dead the body is still capable to
[1:23:46] move but they can't move because they
[1:23:48] lost their brain
[1:23:49] they become brain dead and that's what
[1:23:52] happens oh my that's what happens when
[1:23:54] the bride of Christ gets away from the
[1:23:56] headship of the word they're not able to
[1:23:59] do the same things that Christ did but
[1:24:01] let a bride come under the headship of
[1:24:04] the word and it starts to operate under
[1:24:07] the word your link hands on the sick and
[1:24:10] the recovering you're casting out Devils
[1:24:12] to the serpents and harming you you'll
[1:24:15] be coming an invincible Army it's the
[1:24:17] body it's coming subjects to the head
[1:24:20] you become one of them the same it
[1:24:23] continues on to say if you abide in me
[1:24:25] in my word in you then ask what you will
[1:24:28] and it'll be granted to you verily
[1:24:30] verily ashamed of you if you say unto
[1:24:33] this mountain be moving down not in your
[1:24:35] heart but believe that what you have
[1:24:36] said will come to pass you will have
[1:24:39] what you said he says oh my not what I
[1:24:42] said but what you said you can have
[1:24:45] because you and he has become the same
[1:24:49] what a brother them say under your
[1:24:51] messenger you become the final voice to
[1:24:53] the final age you've become one and the
[1:24:56] same you're speaking the same words
[1:24:58] you've got the same actions you've got
[1:25:00] the same thoughts you've got the same
[1:25:02] destination oh my what's the Bible say
[1:25:04] but not one word will return unto me
[1:25:07] void but it's going to accomplish what
[1:25:10] it was sent to do oh my soul if you're
[1:25:12] tied to the word and the word is tied to
[1:25:15] you once it's accomplished what it's
[1:25:17] said to do it's going back to its maker
[1:25:21] it's going back to where it come from
[1:25:23] and if you're tied to it you're gonna go
[1:25:25] with it
[1:25:27] hey look at Jesus Remember uh the Bible
[1:25:30] says that God looked through the pillar
[1:25:32] of fire so God was in the form of the
[1:25:35] pillar of power but then God was made
[1:25:37] flesh and walked upon Earth but what
[1:25:39] happened after he was crucified and went
[1:25:41] back to Heaven he appeared a pillar of
[1:25:44] fire appeared before Paul and Paul says
[1:25:46] who art thou Lord he says I am Jesus
[1:25:49] whom thou persecute us so what happened
[1:25:52] after the word accomplished what it was
[1:25:55] sent to do he went back to its previous
[1:25:57] form
[1:25:59] come on now we're back to its previous
[1:26:01] form so once the word becomes flesh in
[1:26:04] you and it accomplishes what it's said
[1:26:07] to do you're gonna go back to where you
[1:26:09] come from you're going to go back to the
[1:26:11] mind of God you're gonna go back to that
[1:26:14] spotless State come on somebody if the
[1:26:17] word is Victorious and you're tied to it
[1:26:20] that means you can't lose there's
[1:26:22] nothing that can keep you out of this
[1:26:24] Rapture there's nothing that can keep
[1:26:26] you out of this body change if you're
[1:26:29] tied to it
[1:26:31] he continues on to save because the mind
[1:26:34] that was in Christ is in you in the mind
[1:26:36] that was in Christ was to fulfill the
[1:26:39] father's word which he was the word
[1:26:41] there you are then you and the word are
[1:26:44] focused in together you become a living
[1:26:46] units of God how great you become a
[1:26:50] living units of God not a statue
[1:26:54] but a living unit your mouth is only
[1:26:57] speaking what he says
[1:26:59] brother Branham says we must cope our
[1:27:01] lives and focus it on the word of God
[1:27:03] just like when we were to picture
[1:27:06] a picture of our camera he says try to
[1:27:09] get the right Focus before we snap in
[1:27:11] then we got the real true picture he
[1:27:14] says that's what we want to do is focus
[1:27:16] our life onto Jesus Christ then Christ
[1:27:19] in you become the same person
[1:27:22] Hallelujah Christ and you become the
[1:27:25] same person another quote he says then
[1:27:27] the church will be moving without
[1:27:29] friction without hurts without harms
[1:27:31] without doubts without Scruples oh my
[1:27:34] without friction he will be moving in
[1:27:36] the power of God manifesting every
[1:27:39] divine blessing God promised just like
[1:27:42] he would do we must do our lives then
[1:27:45] see him and seek him only not some
[1:27:47] Bishop not some great man something that
[1:27:50] or something we take pattern by but we
[1:27:53] look to Jesus Christ not some
[1:27:55] organization not some Pope not some work
[1:27:57] Bishop not some cranerberry but some
[1:27:59] other Divine men they'll be called on
[1:28:01] Earth but we must look to Jesus Christ
[1:28:03] and he is the word
[1:28:06] amen as the musicians come
[1:28:09] we must focus our life on one thing and
[1:28:13] he says then the church shall be moving
[1:28:14] without friction
[1:28:16] without hurts without doubts without
[1:28:18] Scruples he says it again without
[1:28:20] friction
[1:28:22] it will be moving in the power of God
[1:28:25] manifesting every divine blessing that
[1:28:27] God promised to do it how is he doing to
[1:28:30] brother Josh through the bride's body
[1:28:31] how is that happening by focusing and
[1:28:34] letting it influence your life
[1:28:38] brother Brandon says whenever the woman
[1:28:40] at the well whenever she come under
[1:28:42] Jesus influence it put her into action
[1:28:44] and she ran to the city and says come
[1:28:47] see a man who's told me all that I ever
[1:28:49] done the Bible says that the men of the
[1:28:52] city were saved because of her report
[1:28:54] how did that happen she was put into
[1:28:56] action by an influence no telling what
[1:29:00] God can do through your body through a
[1:29:02] young person through a mama through a
[1:29:04] daddy whenever we let Christ influence
[1:29:06] our lives that puts us into action amen
[1:29:09] that's about our heads this evening

[1:34:27] aren't you glad that we have had someone
[1:34:30] to direct us
[1:34:32] change our path
[1:34:35] change our Direction change our Focus
[1:34:39] think of where we would be without the
[1:34:41] message of the hour
[1:34:43] what would we do
[1:34:45] where would we be headed well we know
[1:34:48] where we'd be headed
[1:34:50] you know the prophet talked about over
[1:34:52] and over and over the world Council of
[1:34:54] churches
[1:34:55] however one is being united into that
[1:34:58] they're running they don't know they
[1:35:01] they think it's a good thing they think
[1:35:03] it's it's of the Lord I think it's a
[1:35:06] better thing
[1:35:07] that we we know that it's nothing but
[1:35:11] damnation
[1:35:13] nothing but a heap of trouble and
[1:35:17] God's going to consume it with his Wrath
[1:35:20] and yet we've heard a voice
