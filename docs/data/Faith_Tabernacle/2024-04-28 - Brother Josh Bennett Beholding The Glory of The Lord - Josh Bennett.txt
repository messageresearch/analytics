hour and if you hear anything contrary to the message may your hearts be established this week to know that God sent a prophet and that message is the absolute was right here in the word we've had this Bible for years and years and years and hadn't understood it at all but when we come into the message we begin to understand that these scriptures belong to us this Prophet came for us amen it came for us it's the absolute I may not understand it but I don't question it you may not understand it but don't question it if God said it we believe it that settles it can you say amen and because we believe it the word is taking effect Upon Our Lives We are Becoming written Epistles read and known of all men this word that had been laying dormant for years is now taken on flesh and I'm so glad that I'm a part of it can you say Amen thank God for the ministers that preach the message of the hour and thank God for a people that can amen the message of the hour and God shows up and vindicates it time and time and time again Hallelujah there is so many men that think they they've got it all together and they think they're the one that's it and they walk away from the message message and they become nothing it's the message that produces what we are it's the message that makes ministers anointed it's the message that makes homes together it's the message that keeps us sane because it is the word of God for this age can you say Amen there's no room for personalities and I thank God for these men that are preaching they're not here to build kingdoms they're not here to build their own church they're not here to establish their own name they don't care about that they just want God glorified and they want your faith to be solidified into this message amen that no matter what comes and what goes God sent a prophet and that Prophet is right can you say Amen you love him I love the Lord amen and the prophet has said several times that God sending a prophet to us is God's grace to us and I say Amen to that thank God for his grace amen well we're um uh we just appreciate again every one of you coming and uh uh being part of the meeting and um we're going to invite brother Josh uh Bennett I uh he's no stranger to us and I uh certainly love brother Josh very much and uh the man loves the message he lives the message he breathes the message amen the message is his life and he's built his ministry not upon him self but upon the Vindicated word of the hour and God has blessed him for it anointed him amen and I know you're going to be blessed today amen it's not the minister that brings the Revival as we all know it's us that pull on the gift God placed the gift in brother Josh's life before the foundation of the world Amen and he knew that this day would come this hour would be here that Josh would stand behind his pulpit and preach the word word of God but he knew there would be a people ordained to hear that message that would pull on the gift and God says when they meet I'll come and deliver I'll come I'll come and whatever need you have this morning God's here to vindicate you heard what A Miracle it is for brother Shi and sister Bethany 20

to the Lord if you got a need just lift it up to him this morning as we pray Lord Jesus we just thank you Lord for another opportunity that you've given us and Lord the word that has come and and Lord we know that your word has a power within it to transform lives Lord I believe that Lord I I think about one time when you let a prophet out in a vision to a valley of dry bones and you asked the question can these bones live live he said thou knowest and you begin to tell the prophet to speak and as he begin to speak that word had a power in it Lord that it begin to bring bone to bone and and and flesh begin to come on the bone and send you on the flesh Lord as he begin to prophesy and speak the Breath of God be today and Lord I believe that by the power of the word even the scripture says you sent your word and healed the people so Lord we believe that if your word Goes Forth it cannot return unto you void but it will have to accomplish what you sent it to do Lord that's what we're just asking Lord this morning that Lord we're giving you pre and Lord that you would just Minister Lord to every heart and every life and I pray Lord that the sick would be healed and Lord discouraged Hearts would be encouraged and Lord I I pray Lord that that which has been weakened will be made strong Lord we know God that Lord these things are possible Lord because you are here you said wherever two or three are gathered in my name there will I be in the midst and Lord we take you at your word and we know God that your word can never fail so we know that you're here and because you are here Lord we have an expectation Lord we have an expectation that Supernatural things will be done and Lord we're just committing ourselves we we're giving ourselves to you now Lord I pray that you'll have your way and we ask these things in Jesus name amen amen if you have your Bibles this morning we'll turn to the book of 2 Corinthians I'd like to turn to the third chapter um we just certainly are honored to be here and enjoyed the services so far and amen I I tell you we're a blessed people amen how many believes that that um you know we're we're we've received the greatest head we're um um blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear and the things that uh men of old and Prophets and you know the sages of old long to see you and I have been blessed to see those things and amen so we just thank God for what he's done amen 2 Corinthians the third chapter and I'd like to start at the second verse you are written you you are our our Epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone to godward not that we are sufficient ourselves to think anything of our as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God who also hath made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which Glory was to be done away how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious for the ministration of condemnation be glory much more do the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this Respect by reason of the glory that excelth and not as Moses which put a veil over his face that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded For unto this day remaineth the same Veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament which Veil is done away in Christ but even unto this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their heart so notice here the veil is upon their heart so their hearts are veiled but their minds are blinded nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord when the heart shall turn to the Lord's seea the veil shall be taken away now the Lord is that Spirit face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord amen may God At His blessings as you're seated this morning I'd like to um just speak to you for a um I'd say a few minutes but I I I I better be careful I'm going to speak for a little while Amen on beholding the glory of the Lord and you know as we look at this i' just like to um start by reading a quote out of the unveiling of God brother Brown said since Pentecost since the crucifixion when that veil was rent from the top to the bottom for that generation Jesus was that God veiled and when he died at Calvary God sent a fire and lightning and and ripped the veil from the top to the bottom that the whole Mercy Seat was in plain view but see they were too blind to see it and Paul said in the reading of Moses when Moses is read yet that Veil is still on their heart oh brother sister that's what the Jews did when the veil was rent that brought God into Plain View hanging on the cross he was in plain view but they couldn't see it amen uh could it be possible he said that the Gentiles has done the same thing he said oh God he said when they have had their Church ages and the and they've and the of the Son of God but now the veil of this denomination and things the veil of tradition since we've had since Pentecost when the church Traditions has now been rent amen and the things that the people said but the people say the days of Miracle is passed and all these things and God has took the veil off of it and brought it into Plain View but see they're ready to crucify it again just exactly see the unveiled God in plain view they should have seen him standing there yet he was too common he was just an ordinary man they see that there was their God hanging on Calvary but they were too blind to see it it brought him into open View and they still don't see it see they're blinded amen but God was veiled in a human being amen you see why couldn't they see it because Paul said there they had a veil upon their heart amen and their minds were blinded to it now brother B would say again in the unveiling of God he said see it's a spiritual Veil that's over the people and they begin to say well I'm Methodist I'm just as good as anybody or I'm Baptist or I'm Pentecostal don't you realize that that thing is a traditional Veil and it's hiding God from you see that's the thing that keeps you from enjoying amen all see and brother B said there's now I just say this morning there's a lot of things there's many things that keeps people from seeing God Amen there's many veils there you know and there's things that that that that block off the view or a vision of people you know the world will come in and and they'll be veiled with worldism or amen and and there's all these things that that that block off amen and keep the people from seeing God Amen brother BR say if you bring it over now into the religious Realms he said the thing that is hiding God from the people is a traditional Veil amen it's their Traditions that's keeping them from seeing God now they they come to Jesus in Mark chapter 7 there Amen in in the fifth verse and the Pharisees and the scribes asked him said why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders amen but they eat bread with unwashed hand and he answered and said unto them well has Isaiah prophesied of you Hypocrites as it is written this people honth me with their lips but their heart is far from me amen now they come to Jesus and and and and I think I think this is amazing because when they come and they begin to criticize the disciples they didn't criticize them for breaking the word they criticized them for his tradition amen but they wasn't being critical toward them because they had broke a commandment of God because they hadn't broke no commandment because there was no Commandment that said they couldn't eat with unwashed hands amen but it was the tradition of the elders amen that that that they were breaking see amen and and and they come and said why don't your disciples keep their Traditions amen but Jesus just looked at them and said you're a bunch of Hypocrites amen because see you won't eat bread with unwashed hands but look at all the other things that Commandments of God that you're breaking I think this is amazing cuz when I started studying it I begin to find out that they said that in that day those Jews held so close to the tra traditions of the elders that they actually believed amen that that it was a a a a greater offense towards God to break a tradition than to break a commandment and they begin to say things like this we would be better off to be without even the law than to be without the words of our rabbis listen friends that that old that Spirit come right over into Catholicism and they begin to say oh we'd be better off to be without a Bible than to be without a pope we'd be better off to be without the word of God A and H and have our priest amen but I tell you what amen there's a a little man or a little boy One Day by the name of William tendale and he was in a school and and and there was a a young man in that school he begin to say listen we'd be better off without the words of God because they were talking about how that you know uh uhh we would like to translate the Bible into the common language amen and and you know the Catholic church was against that because they didn't want the people to see the word amen they did they they wanted amen the people to be depending upon them so that they could tell you what it means and how to apply it amen amen but that that young man said we'd be better off without the word that of God than to be without the word of the Pope but we in tendel there was something down on the inside of him amen he stood up amen and he pounded his desk and he said if God will give give me the strength I'll make it that one day the boy that walks behind the plow amen will know more about the word of God than the pope himself hallelujah amen listen friends amen and God anointed Amen in that time amen men like tendale amen and John rockliff and and Martin Luther amen and they begin to take the word of God and translate into a Common Language amen because God wanted his word have an [Music] effect Jesus looked at him and said amen you're a bunch of Hypocrites listen friends what what was he call the whole idea behind a hypocrite is somebody that is an actor they're they're they're pretending to be something they're not see and that's what Jesus called them a bunch of Hypocrites amen he said because you honor me with my with your lips but your heart is far from me amen could I just bring it down let's bring it down in modern terms you come to church but your heart is far from me you sing songs but your heart is far from me oh you pray eloquent prayers but your heart is far from me you give ties and offerings but your heart is far from me come on church and listen I'm just going to tell you amen this morning amen I'm not preaching about the church the Baptist Church or or the Methodist Church or the Pentecostal Church amen they got their Traditions but if we ain't careful amen we going to have a bunch of messy Traditions amen thing and a tradition is just something that's passed down from generation to generation amen and we're going to have a bunch of young people amen that that are that are uh you know saying things and amen and we got girls that letting their hair grow and amen whatever more but they don't know why they're doing it amen and after a while amen we're going to have a generation of people Amen in this message amen that have never met the God of this message and we're serving God out of a tradition and not by an experience and the veil of the of tradition will hide God from your view listen Jesus is quoting Isaiah 29 for the Lord had poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep and had closed your eyes amen the prophets and and and your rulers the seers hath he covered and the vision of all is become un you as the words of a book that is sealed which men deliver to one that has learned saying read this I pray thee and he saith I cannot for is sealed and and the book is delivered to him that is not learned saying read this I pray thee and he saith I'm not learned wherefore the Lord said for as much as this people draw near me with their mouth and with their lips they do honor me but have removed their heart from me amen and and their fear toward me as taught by the precept of men listen to what brother Brown said he said there's so much today friends that's called Christianity that's not Christianity I just hate to say that but I'd rather stand here among the people and amen and just Pat everybody on the back and everything like that but you got when you got to meet that group at the judge see and give an account you got to be honest I don't know about the rest of y'all but I'm glad that we had a prophet that was honest I'm glad that our the message that we received didn't come to I'm not trying to call names but I'm just telling you amen this is not a message to come and tell you oh your best life now and amen come on Friends amen but I'm glad that God sent a message amen that had a power in it Hallelujah to change you [Music] he said we look out the congregation the world today what's called Christianity we find out it's a million miles from Christianity and it's predicted in the Bible that it'll be that way but we accept Christ see or we just say well you know I believe him the devil believes the same thing and many of them tries to accept it upon a motion well I spoke in tongues or I dance in the spirit amen he said I've seen doctors amen or devil dancers in Africa speak in tongues and drink blood out of a human skull and calling the devil amen he said my mother was an Indian a half Indian and her people I seen them take a pencil and lay it down like that and watch the pencil running all over and write on unknown tongues amen and then stand there and interpret it calling on the devil sure amen you can't go by emotions amen we believe in emotions but he said you can't go by emotions see your life is what testifies what you are no matter what kind of sensation amen you can't base Christianity on sensation it's a life and Jesus said by their fruits you shall know them not by their profession not by what they say Amen Jesus said you draw n to me with your lips but your heart is far from me see that's their profession but the life is is what tells and if a man says he believes God and denies one word of this Bible or changes it in any way amen it's got to be wrong in the church brother Brown said amen that God even called The False Vine a church he said why did he do that he said the truth of the matter is that they are Christians but they're not Christians of the spirit they Christians of the flesh they're bearing the name in vain he said see amen they're bearing the name in vain but indeed they are Christians for what else could they be a muhammadan is a muhammadan that's his religion no matter how he lives because he's subscribes to the theory amen and to what the Quran teaches and it's the same thing with Christ a Christian is a Christian is long as he subscri subscribes to the fact that Jesus is the son of God born of a virgin crucified and died and rose again amen that he's a savior of mankind Etc in fact in the L O ofan age there will be those that will call themselves Christians because they subscribe to the Fine qualities of Jesus Amen while amen reserving to themselves the right to deny his deity Christian Scientists have done that already as well as multitudes who preach a social gospel see he is a nominal Christian and belongs to the church but he is not a true or spiritual believer because that kind of believer is one that's been baptized into the body of Jesus Christ as a member of him what did Jesus say he said in vain in vain do they worship me teaching for doctorine the Commandments of men amen amen laying aside the Commandment of God see you hold to the tradition of men as a washing of pots and cups and many other things that you do and he said unto them full well you reject the Commandment of God that you might keep your own tradition and watch in the 13th of God of none effect through your tradition which you have delivered many such uh uh which you have delivered in many such things you do amen what does that mean there amen it's making the word of God Amen a a void or it deprives it of force and Authority Amen in other words the word can be preached but it has no influence it has no power behind it listen you see that's what Jesus is saying you make the word of none effect by your tradition amen he said he said taking the church the prophet said taking the church the commandment and teaching of the Bible and explaining it all away see therefore you make the Commandments of God without any effect amen you because you explain it away amen let me just say Let Me Show You amen how how it is amen that's exactly what they' done by their tradition they make the word of none effect amen because you can take this Bible and you can read it right out of the Bible amen acts 238 amen water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and they'll see it amen and know that it's there amen but by because of the tradition what will they say well my church says or my pastor says well that Ain How We Do It come on church and they just explain it right away and the place that you can read listen don't you know them Baptists know them scriptures are in this Bible come on they know that scriptures over there in Corinthians about a woman cutting her hair they know it's in that Bible amen but you can read it to them you can preach it to them and it won't have no effect on them you know why because by their Traditions they have made the word of God of none effect because somebody come along and said that ain't what that means I don't mean that and you know you can read about a woman being clothed in modest apparel amen and somebody come out well that ain't what that means or a woman shouldn't wear a garment pertaining to a man and somehow come that ain't what that means and by their tradition they have made the word of God a n effect come on church and I wonder sometimes if we ain't got some of that around our message amen amen when you can preach amen and Men of God will stand and preach the word of God and the people would just go right on living the same way dressing the same way acting the same way I tell you what it is amen is somebody has come along amen and made the word of God of no effect the prophet of God said in the indictment They Crucified the effects how did that happen because they taught for Doctrine the Commandments of men come on I tell you what they done they took the man they took a man's word and they elevated it to the same place of God's word well hallelujah amen and they took the the word of a man and they begin to teach it for Doctrine oh it's the root of all legal ISM right there amen because it listen it ain't the Commandment of God it ain't nothing but a bunch of traditions and they took the Commandments of men and taught it for Doctrine Hallelujah but I want to just stand and say with all of that was in with within me this morning let every man's word be Al lie and let God's be true Hallelujah and I tell you what's wrong with a lot of people people they're looking at this message but they're looking at it through the glasses or some teacher or some man or some man's idea what we need to do is get back to the pure word of God and say it just the way he said it we don't need to explain it away we don't need to water it down and let me say this this message don't need a facelift it don't need to be cleaned up and purty pred up and fasted up amen what it needs is to be preached and GED and lived Hallelujah I say away with tradition I want to see God I want the word to have effect listen friend Traditions will kill the [Applause] effect sir and when it becomes a tradition all listen all Traditions ain't bad y'all know what I'm talking about you got family traditions and church traditions and all Traditions ain't bad but the problem is see when when when something becomes a tradition listen friends and and hey family traditions are fine and cookout traditions and I better be real careful right here cuz I was getting ready to say something else back out of that but anyhow amen there's some traditions but you can't serve God by tradition brother Brown begin to talk about it he said notice when Israel see when they first started out they would come and and there was sincerity in their worship and they come and they lay hands on the lamb and they were identified with their sacrifice and there was something behind there was something in their hearts there was sincerity in what they were doing but after a while amen they they just begin to do it because that's what they've always done and they didn't listen and and the children Amen to to begin to take on the tradition amen and they were offering the same lamb amen but there was no feeling behind it there was no sincerity in their worship and it become a tradition to them and God looked down on them and he said said it's become a stink in my nostrils your sacrifices your your holy days your amen your solemn feast all these things have become a stench in my nostrils amen why because it become a tradition they were doing it out of tradition oh come on Church you say brother Josh this is cat meeting you ought to be preaching something uplifting it is amen I'm telling you it'll help you amen because I'm telling you amen if we just come to church on Sunday morning amen cuz that's what we done last week and that's what Mama done and that's what Daddy listen friends amen that's that's exactly what the Baptists are doing amen and there's a bunch of Baptist today that are only Baptists cuz that's where their grandpa was and that's where their grandma and my mama and my daddy amen and there a much of Methodist amen their method there's Pentecostals that are Pentecostals and they're shouting and they're dancing amen and they don't even know why they're doing it amen because it's nothing but a tradition that's what was talked about in the B they have a form of God but deny the power [Applause] thereof hallelujah amen and I I pray to God Amen that we ain't coming to that in this movement cuz here we are Generations down the road amen but I'm telling you amen I hope that we ain't here I hope that you young people ain't here I hope ain't nobody here amen CUA amen well this was just passed down to me or amen that's just what my daddy believed or that's what my mama believe listen amen if you're here that way this morning I hope you don't leave that way amen because I tell you what amen it's more than a tradition hallelujah amen it's more than just something that was passed down from my grandp amen listen friends amen it's got to be a reality you got to meet the God of this message [Music] Hallelujah cuz the prophet of God said our Traditions ain't got no power in them he said they're powerless amen he said God looks and says they extinct before me amen they have no faith in them people are offering offerings without even having faith in what they're doing amen and let's just ask oursel the question isn't that something like today as bad as I hate to say it we got to face the fact there's something somewhere the church ought to be a million miles up the road to where it is now and Jesus is waiting on his church to get ready cuz his bride has had to make herself ready and we got the potentials the holy spirit is here God is here the power to heal the sick is here the power to do all things that Christ did is here amen I've seen it demonstrated Myself by the Holy Spirit missions and come back under the blood of his son and become the Church of the Living God hallelujah amen how many wants to be that church this morning amen get away from our Traditions amen like a brother Sean said get away from our personalities amen get oh come on church and get back Amen to the pure word to the Church of the Living God to The Blood Bought Blood Washed Holy Ghost fi sons of God standing with the authority of the word of God that's the church that he's looking for Hallelujah the prophet of God I just had to agree with him amen because he said amen I want to be in a church amen that preaches the full word the Full Gospel he said I don't care if they got a golden cross on the wall amen or a pipe organ amen it don't matter to me he said if they got that and the spirit is there amen I'll be glad to be a part of it come on Church am I don't care how big the building is or how small all the building is amen I don't care how good the chairs are how good they ain't amen if the spirit of God is there that's what makes a difference hallelujah amen you can have all the forms and all the rituals and amen and know all the quotes come on you can sing the right songs at the right time amen but if God ain't in it you ain't done nothing nothing has been accomplished because as long as a word remains veiled it will never change you and by Traditions they blocked off and amen and hid God but I got some good news for you the prophet of God said break that denominational veil of Education break the denominational veil of tradition break those veils that's hiding him from you break the veils of Pride you women you you're the King's Daughters act like it live like it break every Veil amen no matter what the PHD and the lld says if it's contrary to the Bible break through that Veil for we've cross the Riven Veil we're on the other side now Hallelujah and you will see if you'll just do that and break those old traditions and things and come to him you'll see him standing the mighty conquer the word promised for this old made manifest you'll see the Mighty God unveiled you'll see him right here unveiled the Mighty God unconquered by Traditions Hallelujah you're living in an age that they stacked it up and they stacked up every tradition and they put every Veil they could on the word but my God is a mighty conqueror go on the third day the your justification he broke the veil of unbelief Hallelujah and in this day he broke the veil of tradition and he remains unconquered by tradition Hallelujah that's why in this age of tradition in this age of denomination when they had it so denominated so tight that God couldn't move he sent Malachi 4 and he walked right through the tradition and he book through every Veil and reveal [Applause] Christ oh I just now want to [Applause] preach that's why Paul says seeing then we have such hope we use plainness of speech come on Friends Paul said we use plainness of spe no we we ain't up here mention words no more come on we amen you ain't oh come on church amen we use plainness of speech not as Moses was abolished see but their minds were blinded and until this day the they the remaineth the same Veil and taken away in the reading of the of old testament which Veil is done away in Christ but even un this day when Moses has read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall turn Hallelujah when the heart shall turn in Malachi 4 said behold I sent unto you Elijah and he shall turn the hearts of the children to the faith of the fathers and when the heart is turned the veil is taken away Hallelujah and when the veil is taken away amen the the the the the the eyes of your understanding are open amen and you see Christ come on Friends when the veil is taken away amen you won't see amen just a better idea when the veil is taken away you won't just see a Prophet come on friends thank God we seen a prophet amen but when the veil is taken away amen listen I i' say it in a way you can see it this morning amen pilot looked at Jesus one day and pilate said behold the man behold the man that's all he saw was a man behold the man but John the Baptist looked at him one day and said behold the lamb Hallelujah he saw past the veil and he saw the manifestation Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world Amen listen to Pentecostals looked at this message and they saw a healing campaign and they saw a gift amen others looked at it and they saw a fanatic and some say holy rollers but when I looked at I saw Christ hallelujah amen I saw a redeemer I saw the lamb I saw the [Applause] manifestation what did John say there in John 14 amen yet a little while yet a little while and the world seeth me no more amen but ye see me and because I live ye shall live also and not that day ye shall know how many knows the prophet said that day is this day and at that day you shall know that I am in the father and the father in me listen he said yet a little while and the world will see me no more Amen in the Greek that word it don't just mean to look or that they can't see with with a natural sight it is to view attentively to perceive amen or to enjoy the presence of one to discern to behold oh my amen the word is not used of an indifferent uh indifferent spectator but of one who looks at a thing with interest for a purpose amen Jesus said a little while the world Amen is not going to enjoy my presence no more they're not going to see me they're not going to perceive me me they're not they're not going to uh look upon me intently but you shall see me Hallelujah and then in the next verse verse 21 he says amen he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them amen he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved to my father and I will love him and I will manifest myself to him and that word manifest means to declare plainly it means to exhibit to view to show oneself to come to appear amen Jesus is saying he that keeps my Commandments he it is that loveth me and he is led to my father and I will manifest I will show myself to him John 1:14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and we beheld his glory amen as the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and of Truth first John 1:1 that which was from the beginning which we have heard and which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was which was with the father and was manifested unto us oh my my friends amen it was manifest with unto us and look he said we have seen it and and again in the I Ain a Greek a Greek scholar so amen but just bear with me it means to be acquainted with by experience to see or to look upon Amen in other words listen this ain't just somebody taking a casual glance amen somebody just you know amen being attracted and taking a and their attention being drawn to something for a moment amen but this is talking about somebody amen that is draw to a certain thing and they fix themselves upon it Hallelujah in other words it becomes their focus and they behold it and they look at it and they study it Hallelujah and they keep looking at it until the thing that they're looking at begins to have an influence or an effect upon them Hallelujah I tell you what friends amen you will never see Christ and remain the same if you ever get a real look at Jesus amen you cannot stay the same First John 3 and8 he that committed sin is of the devil for the devil sinth from the beginning for this purpose for this purpose the Son of God was made manifest for this purpose can we say it in a plain way for this purpose the Son of God Amen was made uh come into view was made visible for this purpose amen amen did he appear that he might destroy the works of the devil Hallelujah that he might destroy The Works of the devil listen friendss and you might ask well what's the works of the devil I'll tell you what a prophet said he said every sickness any spirit that would kill a man's influence and Destroy his character that's the works of the devil but for this purpose was a Son of God made manifest that he might destroy the works of the devil oh come on church amen I believe that he was made manifest in this day amen you're living in the day of the revealing of the son of man and he was made manifest for what purpose to destroy the works of the devil in your life come on he's here right now in this building amen for the and he's making himself visible in these Services he's manifesting himself for what purpose that he might destroy the works of the devil in the heart of every believer you might have come here bound but you can leave delivered you might have come here sick but you can leave healed because the Son of God is made manifest to destroy the works of the devil hallelujah oh I can't leave it amen without saying this he said and now he said the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy and the spoken words ofal see he said and now his body is to do the same thing hallelujah amen what are you saying brother amen I'm saying this when you see the manifested God Amen become Amen in the bride form and God starts living through his church Amen brother it's manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil [Applause] Hallelujah listen friend I'm just going to tell you this morning you know I can't help and you know uh what it's the Mighty God unveiled and and you say well how was he unveiled he was unveiled by being revealed because the word revelation actually means an unveiling it's an unveiling see brother Brown would say it in the church age book He said amen the word revelation there apoc apocalypse which means unveiling this unveiling is perfectly described in an example of a sculptor unveiling his work exposing to the onlooker see it's an uncovering or revealing of something that was previously hidden hidden so you see he's unveiling himself what was the opening of the seals he was unveiling himself it was him revealing himself he's making himself known I I I I just I want to say it in a way that you catch it listen for this whole thing this manifestation that we have seen through the message I even begin to think about all the things that God did and the Miracles that were performed the Messiah sign that was shown and amen and all these things listen do you realize God did that for you he was manifesting himself amen that listen and there was people that amen that that that they seen those things but they never seen Christ there was people that was even healed in the meetings but they never seen the message they never seen Christ but God all the time amen he was uncovering or unveiling himself so that you could see [Applause] himall see unveiled by Revelation that's what John seen the a of patmas watch Revelations 1 and9 John who also am your brother and companion in Tribulation and in the kingdom and the patience of Jesus Christ was in the aisle that called patmas for the word of God for the testimony of Jesus Christ I was on I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou see us right in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia and unto Ephesus and samna and pergamus and unto thyra and unto Sardis and Philadelphia and L of I see you and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven golden candles 6 one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down the foot and G about the PS with a golden girdle and his head and his head and his hair were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire his feet was like fine brass as they burned in the furnace his voice was as a sound of many Waters and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth when sharp toed his sword and his countenance was as a sun shining in his strength and when I saw him and when I saw him listen to John and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he lay his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I'm the first and I'm the last I'm he that liveth and was dead and behold I'm alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and of death write these things which thou seen and the things which are and the things which shall be Hereafter notice what brother Brown said amen when John turned to see the voice notice he said John does not say he turned to see the one whose voice he heard he turned to see the voice oh I like that he turned to see The Voice amen the voice and the person are one and the same Jesus is the word John 1 And1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was was God and the same was with him in the beginning amen and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that seeing Jesus Hallelujah if you ever really see the word you will be seeing Jesus listen friends that's why I can tell you this morning amen amen you can see him if you want to see him you can see him because if you can see the word you'll see him watch what brother Ram said in the message in his presence he said what about great St John Revelations 1:7 when he showed the vision see he looked and he heard the voice speaking to him now when he turned to look to see The Voice he saw them seven going kenel six and one in the midst amen with hair like wool and eyes like a flame of fire and feet like brass he was gir with a golden gird all about the path amen he was called the word of God and when the listen amen and John had walked with Jesus and slept with him and ate with him but when he seen him standing there in that glorified State he fell like a dead man amen At His Feet think of it amen think of it listen what brother Brown Say said we come to church and we talk and we praise God and so forth but old brother amen if we see him coming something will be different in our hearts we might think we do our religious Duty by go to go to church and pay our tith and we keep the laws of the church and recite the Creed but once we get a look at him the whole thing just change all the way around Hallelujah once we just get a look at him oh come on friends I want to see what John saw amen and brother Brown said it was so much greater John had walked with him amen he he had ate with Jesus he had all these things he said but when he saw him like that when he saw him like that amen can I can I tell you what brother said in the church's book he said no human can stand the full effect of the vision amen his strength utterly Gone John fell at his feet as though dead but the hand of the Lord of in love touched him and the voice of blessing begin to say fear not don't be afraid I'm the first and I'm the last I'm he that liveth and was dead and behold I'm alive forever more what is there to fear the Judgment that fell on him at the cross and at the grave amen and when he descended was for us he absorbed the full brunt of the wound of sin and there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus for assurity our attorney is our judge he is both attorney and judge as judge the case is settled it's finished there ain't no condemnation why should the church fear what promise has he ever failed to manifest before you why should it fear punishment or death it's all been overcome amen here is the mighty conqueror Hallelujah here's the one that conquered Both Worlds seen and unseen not like Alexander who conquered the world at age 33 and knew no other way to turn for further conquest and died a victim of sin and righteously living not like Napoleon who conquered all of Europe but was finally defeated at waterl and banished Amen on an island to find himself conquered amen but nothing but nothing could conquer Christ Hallelujah he he that descended is now ascended above all and unto him has been given a name that is above every name yes he conquered death hell and the grave and he has a keys there up and what he loosed is loosed and what he binds is bound there's no changing of it there's no conquer before him there's nothing beside him he alone is a savior he alone is Redeemer he's the only God and the Lord Jesus Christ is his name Hallelujah and brother I say that's who I see Hallelujah that's who I see amen that's amen I been caught up like John in the spirit and I see him standing in the power of his resurrection oh friends amen and like John amen no human can stand the full effect of that Vision amen but I tell you what I have felt his hand I have felt his loving hand and I have heard his voice and his voice is saying fear not Hallelujah fear not little bride fear not little flock amen don't fear all that I am you're air too all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours I stand in your midst I have not come to bring fear and failure but love and courage and ability and all power is given unto me and it's yours to use Hallelujah you speak the word and I will perform it this is my Covenant with you and it can never [Applause] fail oh why don't you give the Lord a great hand clap of [Music] Praise hallelujah hallelujah I tell you amen listen you ain't clapping for no man you're clapping for Jesus amen why don't we give him the praise he deserves this morning he's still the mighty conqueror Hallelujah he's still UNC conquering by Traditions he's still amen broke through every ve hallelujah amen he's still amen the only God the only savior the only Redeemer and he's still amen amen his name is still above every name hallelujah amen amen let me tell you there's a day coming that every knee will bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord oh yes sir the prideful Knee will bow amen listen amen listen amen the the church member will bow the agnostic will bow The Atheist will bow every knee shall bow but friends I ain't waiting till that day I will not wait amen to declare him Lord hallelujah I will not wait defeated his unbelief what somebody conquer conquered his unbelief amen that unbelieving Thomas was so radical in his unbelief but once the unbelief was conquered he was just his radical in his faith he looked at him and he said my Lord and my God hallelujah he I ain't wait for the millennium I'm not waiting for the right on judgment I'm here this morning right here in 2024 in the middle of Satan's Eden and I say he's my Lord and he's my god oh thank you Jesus thank you Jesus brother Brown said you'll never get a true look at Jesus and remain the same can I can I just strike the text for just a minute and because he said Paul said but we all with open face see beholding the glory of the Lord is in a glass he said now you remember when Paul's coming down to this he said not as Moses not as Moses which which veiled his his face see I I I just maybe we'll read it to you out of Exodus 34 and this is of course when the the last time Moses went up into the cloud the Bible says in the 29th verse and it came to pass when Moses came down from the mount SII with the two tables of testimony in moses' hand when he come from the mount Moses wish not that his that the skin of his face Shone while he talked with him when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses behold the skin of his face Shone and they were afraid to come nigh and Moses called unto them and and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him and Moses talked with them and afterward all the children of Israel came nigh and gave them in and he gave them in commandment all that the Lord had spoken with him in the mount SII until Moses had done speaking with them he put a veil on his face but when Moses went in before the Lord to speak with him he took the veil off until he came out see he came out and spake the children of Israel that which he was commanding the children and the children of Israel saw the face of Moses and the skin of Moses face did Shine and Moses put a veil over his face again until he went back in to speak with him so you got to catch this that when Moses mooses went into God's presence he he wasn't veiled Moses was not veiled from God and brother BR would say see because we know that Moses went he was he went up on the mountain he went up into the cloud amen and and and and and and the way brother Brown would say say he went into the word amen and and there was no Veil between him and God and and so much that when Moses was in the presence of God and he was beholding that word that word begin to change him you see and when he come out of the presence of God he was reflecting the glory of God Amen but when he come off the mountain the people were afraid they weren't afraid of Moses they were afraid of the glory of God and friends and what did they say don't Avail yourself don't let us see see amen the the the the the people amen uh you know they didn't want to see that they didn't want to Behold The Glory oh friends listen friends back there in the Old Testament it wasn't it wasn't the time amen because the prophet went up to get the word and when he come out from the presence of God brother Brown said he was the word to the people is that right amen but you see in that day that word was wrote in stones and there was no way for the to get the word amen amen that was in the prophet into the people you see and they and Moses was veiled to them amen and and and they liked it that way amen they didn't want to see amen the glory of God well I feel like preaching right now because there's a lot of people amen don't like an unveiled God they don't want to see an unveiled God they don't listen for I tell you say brother what are you saying amen they're they're happy being a Sunday morning Christian they're they're happy just coming to church and amen doing their religious duties and oh yeah I I want I want to be a Christian I want to be religious but I don't want to be changed I don't want nothing to change me I don't want the word to change me amen leave it v i I don't want to look at him I don't want to see it from face Val amen reading out of a closed book and the book is handed to them amen but and they say read it and they say how can I read it it's sealed up because the God of this world had blinded Their Minds come on friends anden you say brother what are you saying I'm saying it's unveiled but yet it's veiled the seals is broke but yet it's sealed up because their minds are blinded by the God of this world they don't want to see an unveil God they don't want a message to change them hallelujah oh but friends I tell you amen I say take the veil off hallelujah amen I say Amen preachers preach the unveil word preach the reveal word preach the open word I tell you what you done you let somebody explain it away come along say you're preaching the third pole amen amen the B ain't got nothing to do with it says who you let somebody explain way and by their tradition they made the word of God a un effect somebody come along and say St John 132 ain't for you says who come on church I tell you what amen I heard I heard some say it but I ain't never heard the prophet say it amen I heard the prophet say it belongs to me I tell you what I say Amen the things that are hidden belong to God but the things that are revealed belong to me Hallelujah and I tell you what whatever God opened up in this age through that seventh angel messenger I want it I want to see it I want to believe it don't put a veil on it the veil has been taken away Hallelujah listen read in the Old Testament a Prophet come down off the mount and his face was shining amen with the glory of God Amen in the New Testament amen here stands Jesus Christ and brother B said he was God veiled In the Flesh amen and there he was on m t amen listen because he was the full manifestation come on church but it didn't stay just in one man amen and unveiling God brow down people he said that you are now written Epistles let him known of all men and the glory that was in Jesus walking by the gate called beautiful and they said silver and gold have we known but such as we have give we to you in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk and brother B picks it up and he says amen listen they might not have understood at all but they took note that they had been with Jesus Hallelujah because the glory that was reflected in Christ was now reflecting through them some of you still having trouble with us I just tell you amen over there in Acts chapter 6 the last verse amen the Bible was talking about Steven amen when he stood there and he was preaching and the Bible says amen that they could not withand it because his face looked like an angel Hallelujah Steven was just a deacon come on Friends he wasn't even a prophet he wasn't even a messenger to the age he was just a I doubt his face was shining like a light he said that ain't what that meant but he stood there knowing who he was with the Au thought of the word and he knew what he was talking about and it didn't matter what they said and what thre they come with he stood in the face of all of it w listen Church the word was in the man amen can take this or not but I'm looking at a group of people and your faces look like Angels amen why because in this day we had a prophet go up into the mountain and he went up into a cloud and he stood in the presence of God with an unveiled face but when he come back off the mountain the word didn't stay in a prophet Hallelujah and you are now the written of pists right Mount of all men and the glory of God oh Hallelujah the glory on Sunset Mountain ain't on Sunset Mountain this morning it's in this tent it's in my flesh Hallelujah the purifier that was pictured over the prophet's head ain't just on a picture it's in my heart it's in your heart hallelujah amen and I'm looking at a bunch of people amen listen your face might not be shining but you know who you are and it don't matter what the Devil comes with and what

face beholding him beholding the glory are changed are changed but we are as the musicians come the prophet said just like a seed of the Morning Glory the seed of a fly as it falls into the sea it comes up he said it's a little Sprout and then goes to a tassel and then from a tassel back to the original grain that's exactly what the church has done see it's come down from Luther to Wesley back

have a good time of Fellowship but uh uh around 3 3 : 30 uh the the the brothers that are parking doing the uh parking they've asked that you would come back to your vehicle and move your vehicle just go back around so they can reparking uh they said it's just so much easier to do it that way uh for them and so we want to make it easy for them and uh uh so if you if you're going to leave your car
