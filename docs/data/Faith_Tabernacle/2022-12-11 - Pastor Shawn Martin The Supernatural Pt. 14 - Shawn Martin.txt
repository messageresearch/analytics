the Bible says his Mercy is new every morning man that's amazing ended when you think you've exhausted his Mercy for the day just wait till next morning amen it's all new again and we just can't exhaust his Mercy his grace and we're just thankful to the Lord for that amen I trust your uh had a good night's rest and just ready to uh for the Lord to do great things today amen and praise the Lord the musicians can be dismissed but it's always good to be in the house of the Lord to be gathered among his people amen and I heard his brother Bill's birthday today praise the lord well happy birthday brother Bill and we certainly love and appreciate brother Bill amen and as quiet as he's so quiet you know and but we always you know our family always loves when he gets up and starts testifying I just uh uh fine fine brother and we think he could have been a comedian to one point but uh he just got such a humor and love about him and and I tell you what he may be quiet here at the church but he's very special to us you're very special to us brother Bill and we just a great blessing here to the church to me amen and so happy birthday praise the Lord and if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the book of Ephesians amen the second chapter and and Lord is good to us and I said the second chapter first chapter um praise the Lord and just going to start at the 22nd verse and read the two verses there it says and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all amen let's just bow our heads and talk to our Lord father we're so thankful that you have given us the ability the desire the grace to come to your house Lord to worship you we're so thankful Lord for the health that you've blessed us with father thank you for the desire Lord and waking us up Lord in our right minds and just a heart to serve you today Lord we certainly don't want to take that for granted we just asked that you would just be with us today and anoint this part of the service Lord and ask that you would just speak through me father to your people and father May the hearts and ears of your people just be anointed to receive and if there be any unbelief in each spirit that would try to hinder I pray that you would drive it from this place Lord Lord we just love you and thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen you can have your seeds I do want to read this card it says in our Busy World each good thought word and act makes a difference and it says in more ways than you know that's the difference you make for me thanks thank you for all your prayers texts and cards from the Jones family and so we want to continue praying for brother Johnny and sister Carolyn and the family as they um you know it's not easy losing a loved one and um and I'm sure there'll be days you know where they're going to need our prayer and so we want to just keep them in prayer the Lord will just Comfort them be with them and help them throughout the days to come amen I want to again talk on the supernatural and um you know one thing about God is that God is perfect and his way is perfect and his actions are perfect his thoughts are perfect and I think it's in first Samuel or second Samuel 22 31 but it says as for God his way is perfect and so with that then that tells us that what God done in the beginning what he started out with then he he'll continue to do that if he never changes his mind on anything and so if God was called on the scene to to save the first man then however he chose to save that man he's going to save everyone just the same if he healed the first man on the basis of faith then I promise you he'll heal everyone else on the basis of faith and he can't do any other way because that's his way and he doesn't learn as he goes uh he's perfect so then it's it's a perfect action it's a perfect thought it's it's not increasing in learning and increasing in techniques as man is doing today but it's it's it's it's it's always the perfect it's it's the best way ain't that rhyme so what God desired then as in a prayer as a perfect God perfect thought than what he desired in the beginning that desire is still the same it'll never change he can't change I don't care how many unbelievers there are I I don't care how many Skeptics you'll you'll never be able to change God now the Bible says that man changed him as uh uh they're in Romans the first chapter that that they they they changed him but not not in his nature not in his Essence not not in the way he is they just changed him in their own imagination and and and the church world is doing that today uh uh The Sinner the ungodly they're they're they're they're changing God but but we're people that that says that God can't change and I don't want to be in that in that in that in that uh stand in that position to try to change God not in my mind I don't want to change God in my mind I I don't want to change who he is in my heart uh because I'll be the only uh uh well I'll be the fool I'll be the one that's that believe in a lie because God can never change ain't that right and so uh Perfection cannot progress anymore because it's already perfect ain't that right so the prophet said so he don't have to say well this is a different age and we got a better thought now well if it is he can't be God see so if he is God what he spoke back there he has to stay with it because he was perfect there and he's perfect now do you believe that so so then we're going to look there at in the book of Acts amen uh God laid the foundation for his church in the book of Acts Amen on the day of Pentecost says is when the church was birthed a man inaugurated so however God started that church it's still today however God whatever God done in that church is still applicable for today that's the standard for the church today if if if if the works of God isn't isn't being done in the church today amen then then we're below the standards the church is below the standard ain't that right amen that's right because there ain't no there ain't no better way so so then in the days of Acts God laid an Apostolic Foundation a man there was an Apostolic Faith there was an Apostolic Doctrine there was an Apostolic baptism there was Apostolic gifts a man that was in that first church ain't that right which means that that the faith the doctrine the baptism uh uh of it was of the Apostles Apostolic is when we say Apostolic that's that's where it was it was of the Apostles it was the faith of the Apostles it was the doctrine of the Apostles it was it was the gifts that that was uh uh uh uh worked through the apostles and and so uh uh that that's so we would call that Apostolic gifts or whatever but that was the foundation of the church it was an Apostolic Church a Pentecostal Church ain't that right and and so uh uh what the apostles had what they taught what they did was Apostolic amen that's right a lot of the apostolics though we got named Apostolic like we've got name Pentecostal but but and and they're so far from Apostolic uh because what the apostles done amen that was the foundation of the uh for the church today ain't that right so so uh uh brother Branham says you know the doctrine of the Apostles what was that Doctrine it was authoritative word ain't that right amen so they weren't teaching their their own ideas they weren't teaching Doctrine from a rule book cold book a man it was authoritative word straight from God ain't that right so that's what Apostolic Doctrine is so you'll never find trinitarian in an Apostolic Doctrine you'll never find even even uh Jesus name the way they they they put themselves as as as such uh uh today uh Oneness you know um uh there's there's the rawness and then there's the trinitarian and then there's the bride right in the middle of all this you know and and yes we are Oneness but we we don't believe that the flesh was deity ain't that right amen God was all all man and he was all God that Jesus was right and so so we we find that there's that Apostolic Doctrine amen and so uh an authoritative word amen then is it would be contrary to the apostolic Doctrine the doctrine of the Apostles amen now we we find in the days of the Apostles the Bible says that God added to the church daily as such as should be saved ain't that right now that's Apostolic Doctrine right there and that's apostolic faith that God added to the church daily as such as should be saved see so that's Apostolic uh uh the Apostle the apostles didn't accept anyone and everyone as as Christians as they do today amen for God is the one that would add to the church such as should be saved and if God didn't add a person to the church church then they just weren't part of the church you understand what I'm saying amen you see there was a standard that was set for the for for for uh the Christians of that day amen it wasn't all these kinds of wacky doctrines that we have today there was one Doctrine there was one Faith there was one baptism ain't that right there was one belief amen and so uh uh someone trying to bring that in the church amen they would say well that's that's not the church that you're not part of the church it's it's it's not something there you know and and uh you know today uh uh so many people just don't want to hurt other people's feelings and so that they'll you know that we we accept uh septum as a brother or sister and then have to put up with all the junk that they bring in the church we put up with their division amen uh their disrespect we put up with the confusion that they bring into the church we put up up with all the bellyaching and the backbiting and and all these things but when it was in the beginning at the apostolic of the Apostles them things weren't to happen amen uh you you had people that that were liars and and trying to deceive and and and then you find out what happened the ananias and sapphires the Holy Ghost moved amen and and uh up on Peter and and God struck them dead ain't that right well see that was Apostolic see and and so there is an Apostolic standard a man even for today the Apostle Paul says mark them which caused division among you see so so you know the apostles didn't believe in being part saved and and part Center and and and like like people do today uh confessing oh I'm a Christian I'm a Christian and still drinking and still lying and still cussing and still dividing and still uh uh uh causing trouble Lynn and and and smoking and and women wearing their britches and cutting her hair and you you understand what I'm saying amen them things weren't now then things didn't happen back then amen because there was a standard and it was God the one that added to the church such as should be saved a man sold the apostles back then didn't believe in Heaven one foot in the world and one foot in the church them things just didn't happen amen see and so uh uh you know it's like the prophet said you know when it's night outside well then it's dark it's it's yeah yeah yeah you know you you don't uh you you don't say well how much of it is dark and and how much of it is light well it's it's all dark it's night outside ain't that right see and and so uh brother Brandon said well if you are a Believer then you are a Christian and if you're not a Believer then you're not a Christian gin ain't that right see that that's Apostolic that's that's what it was back in the first day of the first church age is is if you're Christian then we expect you to be a Christian we expect actions of a Christian we expect you to be on fire for God we expect you to be working for the kingdom of God we we expect you to support the kingdom of God we expect these things as a Christian can you say amen amen even the prophet got on to the people of of you know supporting radio stations that was totally against Pentecostal doctrines amen why would the Pentecostals amen support things that would condemn Miracles and we would condemn Holiness and would condemn whatever see and you support that stuff well the apostles wouldn't support that can you say amen that's exactly right so so we find uh uh that that if you notice you're not saved by Good Works amen you're not saved by shouting and they're talking and what Apostolic right you're not saved by speaking in tongues you're not saved by keeping the Sabbath you're not saved on the basis of eating meat or whether you eat or not eat meat you're not saved amen by joining a church you're not saved by water baptism you know uh uh uh them sayings are not Apostolic doctrine of what it used to be you understand what I'm saying say man so either either people are teaching these things and saying they're blessed of God they're highly favored of God and and if if that be the case then then let's admit it God had to change because he did not build the church in that way he did not build a Doctrine there and establish that church on such doctrines as such as these things can you say amen amen see they weren't legalists back then God would add to the church and there was a great grace upon them and amen and and these things a man in Ephesians 2 and 8 the Apostle Paul says by Grace everybody saved by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God can you say Amen so then uh uh we find that there is a true salvation there is a true salvation and that's when God gets a hold of a man God gets a hold of a a boy a girl woman a man and he and he brings them into his church after all it's his church ain't that right this is just a building right here amen and and this don't mean we're part of his church amen you've got to be baptized into his church by God's spirit ain't that right amen and then if you're truly saved now now think of this if you're truly saved you you well then then you speak with tongues you can shout you can praise God well that's Apostolic can you say amen that's Apostolic amen I uh people that don't believe in speaking in tongues I you know let's just put it let's just put it plain hey man you you can't tell me where brother random took it out of out of the church and he's the one that said I preach what Paul preached can you say amen that's exactly right he didn't take tongues out of the church he didn't take tongues out of the body he put order to it but he didn't take it out but we can look and say that that's Apostolic Doctrine because Paul put order to it as well ain't that right see so then another thing that's Apostolic is is what the Apostle Paul taught in First Corinthians 14 32. amen uh uh that the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets do you believe that amen the spirit of the prophets are subject to the prophets so that's Apostolic Doctrine amen for God is not the author of confusion but of Peace as in all churches of the Saints ain't that right so now brother Branham says this see when the pastor sees something wrong and he says look sister or brother that's wrong what you're submissive that's right you're submissive see the spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophet you're submissive you say God forgive me I didn't mean to do get out of out of order see to the church you know he said I'm ready oh to the church and move on and then you're going to see a church moving for the glory of God see the spirit of the Prophet is subject to the prophet everything's in order the church said in order but if you get your head stuck up and say well I don't believe that you know and I just tell you see that shows right then there's something wrong with you see that's wrong there's something wrong you can't stand correction you know what I mean he said see the scripture says Mark those two see uh that's right if you can't stand correction you can't stand in order you can't stand in the things of God then you pull off well then Paul says they went out from us because they wasn't of us ain't that right well church that's Apostolic Doctrine ain't that right so so when we're trying to when when we're trying to make sure to not hurt people's feelings and we're trying to keep friends with with everybody well you you've got to be a chameleon is that what they call that a chameleon where you change colors and wherever wherever you're at you just change colors or but but that's not Apostolic Doctrine the Apostle stood for what they believed ain't that right we had come or go Paul says all of Asia forsook me amen he didn't try to change colors he just stood on that on the principles of God's word amen and so is the church today standing upon the principles of God's word Ephesians 2 18 tells us Paul would tell us through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the father now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God aren't you glad for that a man that your fellow citizens with with the Saints and household of God you're no more foreigners you're no more strangers and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone a man so you are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and the prophets ain't that right amen see so we find a lot of things that are in the Pentecostal age amen that are not Apostolic it did not start with the first church a man and uh it's it's just it's just not there but the foundation of the church is Apostolic can you say amen and we go back to one doctor drink one face one baptism one Lord ain't that right and anything else we don't want to be a part of that that's exactly right so then if someone tells you that the apostolic Days Are Over don't you believe that if they're not over can you say amen amen maybe you could say it with me the apostolic days are not over that's right the apostolic days are not over brother Branham says that statement is wrong a man on two accounts when they tell you that the apostolic days are over he says that statement's wrong on two accounts he said number one it is wrong to suppose that there are no more Apostles just because the Twelve Apostles are dead he said the word Apostle means one that is sin and God is still sending men can you say Amen he's still sending men and they are called missionaries ain't that right he says number two the second reason that that statement of the Apostles days of the apostolic days are over he says see they're referring to an age of manifested holy ghost power being over since the Bible has been completed so so we know we don't add we don't take away from this and so people have gotten the idea that because this is completed that we don't need the apostolic days we don't need the Holy Ghost in manifestation anymore and sadly that's becoming in the church and our message ranks as well amen and we're getting more educated morons a man that are trying to get us to sit and educate us and and and and and and no wonder it's becoming more and more popular amen for this psychiatrist and psychology and all this to come into the church we don't need Psychology that was not the apostolic Doctrine we need the manifestation of the Holy Ghost in the church today amen the Holy Ghost can amen he can discern your heart it can tell you where you're wrong it can tell you where to repent it can tell you where you messed up and make it right can you say amen amen he can do things that psychology will never be able to do as the prophet said psychology is just a shot in the dark amen the Holy Spirit doesn't do things as a shot in the dark it can tell you exactly right on where you're at ain't that right amen but see they're telling us well we're in the fullness of the word amen so we don't need all that jumping and carrying on we don't need all that manifestation well what they don't realize is that crying is it can be tears flowing down a person's cheeks can be a manifestation of the Holy Ghost somebody shouting can be a manifestation of the Holy Ghost somebody speaking in tongues can be a manifestation of the Holy Ghost somebody interpreting can be a manifestation of the Holy Ghost can you say Amen someone running in a church and excited can be the manifestation of the Holy Ghost somebody jumping out of their Pew lifting up their hand and saying amen can be a manifestation of the Holy Ghost can you say Amen oh yes sir many times brother Brown said people raising their hand Defying Gravity amen is because the Holy Ghost is upon them amen calls on them to raise up their hands causing them to shout causing them to scream causing them can you say Amen you you go back and listen to that Garden Simplicity in Albuquerque brother Branham showing him how to receive the Holy Ghost he tells them lift your hands up and begin to praise the Lord and before you know it you start hearing people scream he said that's it that's it that's the holy ghost coming upon you can you say Amen oh when I we want to put all that out that the manifestation of the Holy Ghost in power is genuine can you say amen that's exactly right I know the rain falls on the just and the unjust but if it can fall on the unjustic and fall on the just as well can you say Amen it can fall on the genuine seed and the sin genuine seed can be a reality to it amen they can receive a real experience of the Holy Ghost now so brother Brown says see amen uh they're referring to an age of manifested holy ghost power being over since the Bible has been completed brother Brown said there is not one even one scripture that suggests that but many conclusively state otherwise ain't that right acts 1 8 is one of them amen but you shall receive power everybody say power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the other uttermost parts of the earth ain't that right amen then you go to Acts 2 39 for the promise Peter says for the promise is unto you Jews the prophet said and to your children Jews and to all that are far off Gentiles even as many as the Lord Our God shall call Jew and Gentile ain't that right amen seeds so the prophet never done away with these scriptures he tells us that the promise is still for us today but people want to look at the Pentecostal lady and say well brother Brown said they're just blowing smoke out of the out of the stack so that's not for us today well I'll tell you what Amen on the day of Pentecost they didn't blow smoke out of that stack they knew exactly what to do with that power Devils were cast out people were delivered ain't that right amen they knew what it was to walk in the right Doctrine they knew what it was Amen to walk in power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost amen so the promise is to as many as the Lord Our God shall call Brother Graham said until he stops calling the Pentecostal message and power will not cease can you say Amen now you say well I believe he's he's he stopped calling then I dare you to tell me when he did it if we want to go there go go listen to souls in prison and he's questioning then if if it stopped if it was over and he says if it is over what about my children can you say Amen so if we want to go there and say well the Lord stop calling well brother Brandon was if he only ever asking the questions even then so we can stop it there and if that be the case if you weren't born before that year you ain't got no chance yourself I mean we can go in in all kinds of arguments you understand what I'm saying amen but I believe the Lord is still calling I believe he's still doing a work in this age can you say man we may not be seeing a lot of them things in this age amen because we know that time is is wrapping up that we should never ever stop having a burden for Souls we should never ever stop amen trying to get somebody amen into the kingdom of God I believe it was even brother Brown and say that Abraham went to the end of the road after the Lost ain't that right and said we'll do the same so so I hope you understand amen that that that as long as as as until he stops calling the Pentecostal message and power will not cease now notice what brother Brown says what the church had at Pentecost is her inalienable right it's your right ain't that right see originally she had the pure word of God she had the power of the spirit manifested in diverse signs and wonders and Gifts of the Holy Ghost ain't that right so what happened to the people on the day of Pentecost amen uh they received power that's what Jesus had promised them you shall receive power well they receive power and Peter identified it as being the Fulfillment of Joel's prophecy there Acts 2 17 and it shall come to pass in the last day saith God I will pour out of my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see Visions in your old men shall dream dreams and all my servants and on my handmaids I will pour out uh in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy now we were talking about that last Sunday of how it was word bread that fell it was the Manna word bread that that fell on the day of Pentecost Manna manifested word ain't that right that's what real man is to us is manifested word Jesus said I am the bread that came down from heaven amen so Peter was identifying this not as a sensation not as just some work up we're not following like uh like the people follow David koresh and Jim Jones and whatever amen we're not excitable people in that way we're not so um uh vulnerable that we just follow everything but he began to tell them this is scripture can you say man he was basing it all on scripture ain't that right amen and the Bible says they began to speak with other tongues ain't that right and notice brother Brown said they tried to talk and couldn't talk anymore in any more human languages they were so quickened up in the presence of God till they spoke in new tongue a Heavenly language ain't that right it quickened their body to speak in a language they never heard of before it quickened their body they spoke in new Heavenly language well what what what what happened they received their abstract a man indeed from God and the prophet said it glorified their souls they just didn't receive something was silly they received an abstract Hallelujah the same abstract that you receive when you received the Holy Ghost ain't that right and brother Brown said they screamed and cloven tongues of fire separated upon each of them it's so quickened their body what the power that they received so quickened their body till they couldn't even speak in an Earthly language anymore it quickened their body to a Heavenly language the place that they're going to ain't that right so the quickening power of God shook their mortal bodies he said tell their entire mortal language was transfigured transformed into an immortal language amen that's right now notice what Paul would tell us in Romans 8 and 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal Body by his spirit that dwelleth in you I tell you that's Apostolic Doctrine that's Apostolic teaching and that's Apostolic Faith Can you shame man if that spirit that is it was in Christ dwell in you you won't have one foot in the world and one foot in the church it just ain't gonna happen it'll take your whole being it'll Quicken your Immortal body it'll Quicken your mind it'll Quicken your heart it'll Quicken your spirit amen it'll make a Christian a Believer out of you that's right it's quickening and we are quickened then by the power of the Living God ain't that right notice brother Brown said tongues quickened to a new Heavenly language to speak them a rapturing up raising up into a different atmosphere than what they had ever lived in he's talking about that 120 now what happened that power that they received it raptured them it raised them up into a an atmosphere they had never been in that's what the power of God does see and so we find raising up into a different atmosphere than what they had ever had lived in also with the new quickening life to them that come in them equipping their language they spoke in new tongues now the apostolics and the Pentecostals today say well uh uh uh when you receive the Holy Ghost you've got to speak in tongues that's your evidence brother Brown plainly tells us that is not an Evidence can you say Amen but we can we can say it this way a man that you can speak in tongues ain't that right no matter what the what what what what what the power of God does it will stay within the apostolic realm of Doctrine the original Church laughs I might be going to against a lot of beliefs here but it's still true you've never you can never outgrow Pentecost you can never outgrow the apostolic Doctrine hello I know Satan would love for us to be formal he would love for us just to come to church if he had his way we wouldn't even wiggle a toll if he had his way you'd never hear an amen if he had his way our young people would never experience the power of God if he had his way we'd all be dead and dried just like any other normal Church but it ain't going to happen not as long as there's believers can you say man you know and and they say well you working it up no we're not now now anyone that's really been in the Pentecostal Rim era of the Pentecostal age you know what they do to work it up everybody jumps on the music and they Jam and and you know I I know how it is you know pastor's in the mood you know preachers in the mood for people to dance and Shout he's feeling good so he works it up buddy gets that music of cranking and you know and over and over over and over and over and over then he goes see hey hey you know God's here yes come on now you know finally someone starts with it that's it that's it that's it you know before you know what usually on the ladies start screaming glory to God that's it you know and it's a workup it's just work up but when you see a people that's excited about the word so many times you know we'd have we'd have powerful services and then everybody you know is done and you know and that may have lasted two hours or more and then past well the Lord's had his way here tonight so we we won't even go into preaching we just had a good service tonight thank the Lord for moving right well see that's not Apostolic Doctrine that's Apostolic or that's Pentecostal age that was not part of the apostolic Doctrine hello yes sir so we know that there's fanaticism and we're going to get more into it as we go there there is fanaticism but you know and and and and and and this tells me if someone's really listening to the message because the prophet already told us about the fanaticism that he told us there's always if you see the if you see the bogus there's a genuine look for the genuine ain't that right how you can tell the bogus to study the real that's right so we we find that after they receive the abstract this power was designed the prophet said to give them every promise that was on the grounds of God's word after they received this abstract on the day of Pentecost it was it was the grounds that that they could receive every promise of God that was in God's word can you say amen and so the power was to Quicken them to all that was promised in the word of God they laid hands on the sick and the sick was healed they spoke in new tongues they'd done signs and wonders and they did it because that was God's promise can you say man they did those things because it was a promise of God now notice what Paul would tell us in Hebrews 2 therefore we ought to give the more Earnest heed to the event to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip ain't that right for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast in every transgression and Disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with divers Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will ain't that right so God cannot change you can't tell me the church starts off-powerful and then we just sit here not knowing having a clue of what the Supernatural is ah I ain't gonna accept that and when then we put all and then we just become message folks that we all just tell stories of what brother Branham done or what God done in brother branham's Ministry now don't get me wrong I love to hear the them stories and I I love to hear it all over again amen and I can hear it and hear it and hear it I love to hear what God done there but you know what that only excites my faith to know that he was the Forerunner amen and here I am he he prophesied I'm the prophecy can you say man he said there would be an invincible church I am that Invincible Army he said there will be a super race I am that super race ain't that right so so what God done then it just gives us encouragement because we know it's still here he's the god of today you believe that if God could work through them people being at a the beginning of his thoughts of what he wanted to go listen to the masterpiece brother Brown said God wanted a masterpiece and he started to build that man's Masterpiece on the day of Pentecost it was not the complete Masterpiece he just started it and look what they've done just in the beginning of that masterpiece and here we are we are the the Masterpiece today you believe it yes sir so now God cannot change we're not saying that the church cannot change we're not saying that the messengers cannot change but the church isn't God so she can change but because the unchanging God has unchanging ways the prophet said we can go back to the beginning and see the first and perfect ACT of God and then judged by that standard that is how it is done hello it's the Holy Ghost Inside you that you're claiming to have doesn't Quicken you you're judging it by the wrong standard there's a standard to this it will Quicken you hello I you know I know we're living an evil age most deceptive age most horrible age I feel sorry for you young people I've well just I guess everyone that ain't got the Holy Ghost and even if you got the Holy Ghost I know the Temptations are there never before has has pornography if they've been so available to human beings as it is today so much corruption has been so available to us today by phones internet etc etc so I understand that I understand you know you got your comedies on YouTubes and you got your now you got you can play video games on your phone and and you can you can just do all kinds of stuff so much stuff that people forgetting God voices are drowning out the voice of God that all I know to tell you this there is a bride that's going to make it in this rapture there's going to be somebody going to make it and and the only way they're going to make it is to quickening power I believe that the Holy Ghost is strong enough to Quicken our bodies to Quicken our minds to Quicken to where we turn our heads when we're supposed to turn our heads hello to walk away from the field when we're supposed to walk away I just believe that quickening power is still here because that is the standard I I just don't believe that we're going to make it and say well God I you know I'm so glad you you I'm just lucky to be part of your bride even though I couldn't I couldn't over time that ain't the way it's going to be there's going to be Overcomers make this thing and it steals the set standard if it can Quicken oh Peter that was a coward and denied the Lord Jesus three times and Quicken into where he could stand there and give his own life for this gospel so will it Quicken us I just believe that now brother Brown said the true church will always try to be like the original at Pentecost the true church of today will try to approximate that early first one and The Messengers to the churches having the same spirit of God in them will try to approximate the Apostle Paul they won't be exactly like him but the true Messengers will be the ones that come the closest to Paul who was free of all men sold out to God and gave forth the word of God only and manifested the Holy Ghost in power none else would do see none else you have to work from the original as like begets like the true church will always be the one that tries to follow in the steps of her Founders at Pentecost and her Messengers will follow the Apostle Paul the first Messenger to the first church age it is that simple and that wonderful can you say Amen so then we find if the Bible a man didn't teach the baptism of the Holy Ghost if the Bible didn't teach the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that it ceased way back Yonder then I teach the same amen but the Bible doesn't teach that the Bible says he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever if the Bible said that the days of Miracles cease with the apostles then I would believe that but God said these signs shall follow them that belief can you say man amen and I believe that amen if the Bible said only that only people back in the first church a man could speak in tongues and and and and that was the only age they could do it in then then we would believe that but Jesus said these signs shall follow the believer and speaking in tongues was part of that can you say man that's right if the Bible taught what a lot of these preachers are teaching a man today then we would believe that and what they were saying but but it doesn't see and and even brother Branham came against that unbelieving spirit amen when he was here listen to what brother Brown said how can you people say that the apostolic age has ceased where do you get it amen how can a Vine come out and bear an orange today and then this day bear a pumpkin it would have to change its life can you say Amen well then we find amen that the same life that life that was in the seed in the time of planting is still in the seed in the time of harvest it doesn't change life it's the life fully develops ain't that right brother Brandon speaking to the Pentecostal said you may be Pentecostal but you're uh he said but but by name he said you may be Pentecostal but you're not and say by name but you've got to be Pentecostal the Pentecostal under conditions that the Life of Christ everybody say the Life of Christ the word of God can flow through you and manifest itself and prove it's got to be uh it's to be God see and God working through you the Life of Christ in you ain't that right so let's say that again amen you've got to be Pentecostal under conditions you're not Pentecostal if you don't meet these conditions you'll only be Pentecostal by name well we don't want to be Pentecostal by name we want to be Pentecost by experience and this is the Pentecostal under condition that the Life of Christ the word of God can flow through you and manifest itself and prove it's to be God and God working through you that's the life of Christ in you that's the original Pentecost is that right that's right aren't you glad that Peter knew what the Bible says about it that when the scoffers were there and they were saying oh they were accusing them of being drunk and yet he knew the scriptures enough to say these men ain't drunk but this is that which the prophet Joel saith and we've been accused of a lot of things I tell you what this Bride is a word bride she knows what is expected of her in this day and we can look at him and say but this is not fanaticism as you suppose this is not just a sensational workup as you suppose but this is that but God has promised in this day ain't that right so the prophet said the church is a Pentecostal Church the life that's in the vine come back come up into one church and get a Pentecostal experience and behind it they have all kinds they have all kinds of the gifts of the Holy Ghost these signs of the the signs of Jesus Christ and today we have drafted into it every different kind of a denomination Methodist Baptist Presbyterian and even Pentecostal so-called grafted into it but they don't bear the original Fruit they don't have the original experience yet they are sucking or suckling off of the name of Christianity Hallelujah that's right that vine ever brings forth another Branch it'll be a Pentecostal Branch with signs following the believer right back to the original these hybrid things won't work and you say man these hybrid things won't work see uh uh he says uh uh uh I know they're sticking in there called Christianity but they're not Christianity by their fruits you shall know them and why can't they they'll never go back can you say man they'll never go back hybrid is will never go back they can never be an orange because they're hybrid yet they wanted the name of Christian but they're hybrid can you say man but he says in another place we are like the original because by Spirit life we are original we are like the original because by Spirit life we are the original aren't you glad for that that's why you don't have to teach someone wants to know what it was like on Pentecost look at the church today hello look at the church today because you're a Pentecostal Church hello so we find here brother Branham says and I've got a lot going I'm going to keep on going is that all right when a man stands and says he's a gospel preacher and says that the days of Miracles has passed that seed of discrepancy when a man stands and says that he's a minister a pastor of a church somewhere and he does not believe that Jesus Christ is the same in every detail except the physical body the same yesterday today and forever that seed of discrepancy when he says Miracles and Apostolic age passed that seed of discrepancy when they say there's no such thing as Divine Healing that seed of discrepancy and the world is full of it and it crowds out and chokes out the wheat that's either discrepancy is trying to choke out the wheat it's trying to choke out that Pentecostal experience don't you let it do it brother Brown says anything that sows discrepancy contrary to the written word of God or puts any private interpretation to it is the seed of discrepancy can you say man say that again now con anything contrary to the written word of God or puts any private interpretation to it is the seed of discrepancy God will not honor it he can't it won't mix it certainly will not it's like the Mustard Seed see it won't mix with anything else you can't hybrid it it's got to be the genuine thing now to be honest that's what the prophet brought us out of is all this hybridization to where we could be the genuine thing then there's nothing wrong with identifying what was at Pentecost because that was what was genuine there's a reason as to why Satan hates the Book of Revelations brother Brown said he knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he changes not I'll say that again Satan hates the Book of Revelations brother Brian said why because he knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he changes not Satan knows that and yet people of people that are having the name Christianity don't even know that and yet Satan knows that brother Brown said he knows that a lot more than than do 90 percent of the theologians and I'll be honest he knows more he knows that more of these so-called unconverted uh uh preachers within the message ranks and hanging around this message brother Brown said he knows that since God is immutable in his nature then he is just as immutable in his ways thus Satan knows that surely that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16 in action is the true church that Jesus claims as his own all else is false can you say man now he's telling us what Satan knows what Satan knows he knows that God is immutable in his nature Satan knows that God is immutable in immutable in his ways Satan knows that whatever God started out doing it will forever be Satan knows that and he knows assuredly that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16 in action he is the true church that Jesus himself claims as his own all else is false Mark 16 is not taught in the Methodist Church Mark 16 is not taught in the Baptist Church Catholic Church Pilgrim Holiness Nazarene Luther whatever else brother Rand says they deny it even though they know that it's the truth but they are so organized to where they can't preach it and there's good people in them organizations brother Brown says I'm not I'm not I'm not condemning the people in the organization I'm condemning that thing that's holding them people and he said it's the system that's damning them people to hell and you say Amen the the the the nun don't go to nun race whatever to be a nun the woman don't go to be a nun to be a bad woman she's doing it with all of her heart good people and you say Amen that's why if you're free if you come out of them systems you got to hold on to your freedom as Paul would say Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty with it where Christ has made us free can you say Amen so they're so organized to where they can't preach these things brother Brown said it's an antichrist Spirit that's got them organized now notice what brother Brown says in another place we're getting ripe for judgment you can preach the Bible and the power of the Holy Ghost and the resurrection of Christ and the signs and wonders will follow the believer and speak the gifts coming back into the church the restoration of all things and preachers will even laugh at you and say you've lost your mind brother Brown said they doing that because we're and it shows that we're right for judgment can you say Amen that's right see and so that same devil is doing his best to take it out of our churches they want to take the power out they want to take the shouting out they want to take the dancing out they want to take the joy out they want to take the power the quickening power out you know what they want to take out they want to take out the Dynamics of this thing and you say Amen but I'm telling you right now we're not organized this this little body is not is not organized and will never be organized that's right and I'm going to preach the truth about it and declare to you that it's still part of the church today can you say man brother Brown said the Church of the Living God is Freeborn of the spirit of God don't need any denomination they follow the king of the Masonic Messianic Kingdom they don't have to take the people's things they're Freeborn made free by the son who makes them free indeed these signs shall follow them can you say amen and I'm so glad I'm not the only preacher preaching these things amen we believe that a true message believer believes it and a true message believer can say Amen to these things because that's what the prophet taught we're free we're free we're free from hybrids this gospel shall be preached and you say Amen now notice God planted that seed on the day of Pentecost and as we've read brother Branham called it the original seed or the Pentecostal seat it was a Pentecostal seed it was the seed word he said the word manifested the promise that had been given so now we know what kind of seed it was it was not a hybrid seed it was a seed word because it could be taken all in the Bible every bit of what they've done every bit of it all their actions all through it it was Bible right but like any seed the seed had to die it had to rot right Jesus said in John 12 24 except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die is abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit so the prophet said any seed that abides alone never does anything it's got to fall into the ground to bring forth its production again ain't that right another place he said the seed that goes into the Earth it has to die every bit of the seed it has to die it has to rot every bit of the seed and every bit of the life that was in the seed has to come forth again not some part of the life every bit of the life that was in the seed ain't that right so it cannot be if it's going to come up again it cannot be a defective seed and I want you to listen now you cannot be a defective seed brother Brown said wheat is the bread of life it's not if if it's not a hybrid grain bury them and and it'll come out again I'll say that again wheat is the bread of life if it's not a hybrid grain bury it and it'll come up again it must be a good ripe grain defective grains won't rise you don't put defective grains into the soil to expect a crop out of it because the beetle or bacteria what is in the grain eats it up it eats the life out of it first ain't that right that brother Brahm is telling us that what God planted on the day of Pentecost was not a defective brain so the devil could not eat the life out of it first what we're looking at is the seed had to die and rot they had to be buried ain't that right so he said see this grain listen this grain must be a good grain everybody say it must be a good grain notice what he says next it must be free from fault failures and so forth in it so if we're looking back on the day of Pentecost and finding fault with it there's something wrong with you not God because whatever God does it's a perfect and whatever they did was perfect it was a perfect seed that was there ain't that right see it must be a thoroughbred green it can't be hybrid grain because when it comes up you plant it again and your wheat is done because a hybrid grain Won't Grow Again so if this if in other words if this seed died and was hybrid on the day of Pentecost and when it died then God would have had to plant another seed but he didn't plant another seed we're still part of that seed so he said see it can't grow again you take the life out of it when you hybrid it well God ain't going to take the life out of it by high breeding it can you say Amen so another place brother Brown said God had showed by that first church that he was God he had a church perfected amen he showed by that first church that he was God can he not do it again today that's exactly what he's doing today don't be mowing your troubles don't be moaning what you're going through God wants to show that he's God through you he wants to take your challenges he wants to take your mouth and he wants to take your struggles and show that he's God if he'd done it back then he can do it today and he had a church perfected so there was no fault in the seat ain't that right it was not a defective seed they were in Oneness the prophet said he says this before the Holy Ghost came the disciples had no Unity with the father they could not understand Jesus for God was not in them yet but on the day of Pentecost God made them one again amen acts 4 32 and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul say that again the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one's soul ain't that right brother Brown said why they had been restored back to the original again the only thing that they had left to be disposed of was an old city or they lived in here an old body called a city or a temple that they lived in here they that had to rot because it has to die and corrupt but in spirit and in life and in purpose and in vision and everything they were one with God is that right brother Brown says another place now he says as the first Adam was given a bride fresh from the hand of God and was undefiled for a brief span so was Christ the last Adam given a pure bride and fresh at Pentecost and she remained separate and undefiled for some time now if you go to Acts we've read this Acts 2 47 or quoted it but it says and the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved she remained undefiled God added to the church God at it right such as should be saved acts 5 13 and the re and of the rest there's no man join himself to them why she remained undefiled no man joined themselves himself to them it was God that would add to the church it was a man program it wasn't man this it wasn't man that it was a man just coming up and deciding whatever God added to the church and no other man nurse joined himself to them can you say amen and they remained undefiled but as Eve was tempted and seduced by Satan so the church was contaminated by the entrance of an antichrist spirit now I'm not going to keep you much longer but I am going to finish but first John 4 3 it says break it in and this is that Spirit of antichrist now notice John being a disciple of the Lord being up there on the day of Pentecost and now he himself is writing these things and this is that Spirit of antichrist whereof you have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world ain't that right you go to Acts 20 and 28 take heed therefore unto yourselves and do all the flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood for I know this after my departing shall Grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years I cease not to warn everyone night and day with tears and you say man so the church was changing your corner now something's happening even in Paul's day in John's day look at Jude even uh 33 years after the day of Pentecost Jude writes this to the church beloved when I gave all diligence to uh to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints 33 years after and he's telling them already to contend can you say man for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ look what Paul writes in second Corinthians 11 and 26 he tells us that he's already in Pearls by false Brethren or among false brethren that's in second Corinthians 11 26. pearls endangered among false brethren something's happening in the church just shortly a short span after the day of Pentecost ain't that right look what happened in Galatians 2 and 2 Paul writes of it false Brethren unawares brought in who came in privately privately to spy out our Liberty which we have in Christ Jesus that they might bring us into bondage so men that were not part of the day of Pentecost were not part of that that original experience have now come in to join them without having the experience and they want to bring them back into bondage hello now we read where Paul talks about his wolves the wolves after my departure shall Grievious wolves come among you you want brother Brown said Paul's wolves have become nicolaitan so they were already there in in in in in Paul's time working do you see it in indeceitful come in among you unaware right so notice what Jesus said concerning his bride in the first stage in that first church age notice what Jesus says Revelations 2 and 4 I have somewhat against thee because thou Hast left thy First Love remember therefore from whence Thou Art fallen and repent so the church the prophet said was already a fallen woman in the first stage right notice he says as Satan had gotten to Eve before Adam even now had Satan seduced the church the bride of Christ before the marriage supper of the Lamb so that first church had already turned away from following the pure word of God in such a a short time and brother Branham would ask what specific thing was in her mist that what cause her to fall and brother Brown said it was the Deeds of the Nicolaitans ain't that right so he says the seed that perfect Church fell to the ground at nicer Rome when she become a denomination another place the church died at night and I see a Rome when she took dogmas and Creeds instead of the original word ain't that right so the church died at nicaea when she took dogmas and Creeds instead of the original word that's why it's so important to stand guard upon the word of God so another place he said the Church of Pentecost dies through the early Catholic Church but I want you to notice this how of a paradox the seed in the ground is it is a paradox because when that little seed dies it rots it rots in such a way to where you could not find it you can take actually you can take the prophet said you can take a handful of dirt take it to the the laboratory and under all their technology try to find it the seed and you can't find it it's not fair yet the life remains there even though the seed dies the life remains and he said that's the paradox ain't that right he said let the sun shine let the Sun get in its right position and let it shine upon that dirt and here comes life the seed dies but the life stays it rocks can you say man he said it comes up from somewhere that's the paradox ain't that right everything he says in the seed dies except the life the life is unseen It's Supernatural ain't that right the natural body is completely gone but the Supernatural still lives and I'll say this wherever the pillar fire is there is life there's life and you say Amen John 1 and 4 says in him was life speaking of Jesus and the life was the light of men in him was life now brother Branham identified that Pillar of Fire as the life right there wherever the pillar fire is there's life can you say man and if you notice on the day of Pentecost the Bible says cloven tongues licks of fire fell upon every one of them showing that God had given his life to them ain't that right well then you find that that life remains in the in the ages in the church ages that life remains and I'm going to get to it and then I'll let you go but he says you know in in Revelations the first chapter John mentioned several things that he saw in that in the in that first chapter of Revelations he saw seven golden lampstands I don't know Daniel can you pull that up the lamp stands I don't know if everybody'd be able to see it but the King James version says candlesticks which leads us to think of a candle but the prophet said John didn't see a candle ain't that right because how many's got a candle you never had a dealt with candle you had a candle and you light it and I get get one you got one in my office you know that are a sweet aroma but let it go out to burn and burn and burn and burn and the candle's going out down down down down finally I have to go get me another candle so that that would not represent what God is trying to say here so brother Brown said that's not candles lamp stands which is totally different ain't that right see a candle will burn for a while and then it won't burn anymore it's finished it's over but John didn't see that he saw seven lamp stems and each lamp had a wick that was connected to one great Wick that went into the bowl of oil now I've tried to look it up and and I really couldn't find it but uh you'll find that that lampstand but so there's that lamp stand seven lamp stand and then each one has a a wick and it all goes down to one great Wick and then that great Wick goes into a a bowl of oil and that wit pulls up that oil and keeps pulling that oil to keep the fire burning ain't that right that's right see so the prophet said see the lamp with the wick hanking down this pipe kept burning day and night day and night you never had to light it everybody say you never had a lighted it never went out that that lamp stand never went out see you never had to light it see he said it kept they just kept pouring oil in the main pipe and these lamb stands that come out like this had the lamps setting on top of them the wick from the lamp run down into here and got its life out out of here see so one great uh if you can get the idea of it their pictures are wrong that way brother Brown's describing as there's a wick that comes out and it feeds to every one of these lamps of these lamp stands and that great Wick goes into a bowl of oil ain't that right so he said see uh uh the wick from the lamp runs down into hearing and got its life out of there see out of that bowl and and what difference it is from a candle how different it's a lampstand it's pulling oil ain't that right and he says the seven lampstands represents the seven Church ages ain't that right so we see that there's fire in every Church age showing there's life in every Church age ain't that right the seed may have been gone and it died and it rotted but the life remains that's right so see and notice the same source that kept the fire burning in the church first church age keep it up there if you can in the first church age I also kept the other Church ages burning the same source that kept that first church age burning kept all them other ages burning kept all that other fire going ain't that right Same Spirit same all same life same fire that's right see and so now the the priest in the Old Testament was required to do it and it was a type of this the church ages and and so how he had to do it he had to like the first lamp first so it's not like uh you know it's not like he he gets his little stick like we'd get a match or a one of them modern day lighters alike and he didn't go around Enlighten it and lighten it like that you know he didn't do that but the prophet said he would take and light that first one then he would take take the fire from that first one and like the second one and then he wouldn't take that the fire from the first one and like the third one he would take the fire from the second one in like the first or the third one and then from the third one to the fourth one and the fourth one to the fifth one and the fifth one to the sixth one to the seventh can you say man so the fire that Lit the first stage lit the second age and the fire that Lit the second age lit the third age and the fire that Lit the third age left the fourth age and the fire that that Lit the fourth age lit the fifth age can you say Amen not a different fire of the same fire and the fire that Lit the sixth stage lift the seventh age and you say man see so we we find it's it's the same fire what is showing the prophet said that it was the same holy ghost in all the ages thank you oh life life remained even though the seed was buried and rotted life remained but the lamp was lit how did that priest get that first lit light where do you get the fire to light that first stage brother Brown said he did it off the altar there was fire on the altar and he and who lit the altar God lit that altar God let that altar and he would get that Holy Fire that God himself lit and he would like that first stage with the fire that God brought down God provided the fire can you say man that's right see yes sir and notice brother Brown said see the pre the priest took took fire from the sacred altar which was originally lighted by the fire of God he lit first of all the lamp that was sitting on top of the bowl then he lit the second lamp from the flame of the first lamp and the third lamp received its fire from the second lamp and as did the fourth received from the third and so on till all seven lamps were burning this Holy Fire from the altar being passed from lamp to lamp is a wonderful type of the holy spirit in the seven Church ages can you say man now where did the fire come from in that first church age where did it come from Brother Brown said the fire that fell on Pentecost has lit the candle the church through every age right on down didn't you say amen and God provided the fire on that Pentecost day that day of Pentecost and that fire still being lit do you believe it Hallelujah I love him if the musicians will come the original outpouring of Pentecost which outpouring came direct from Jesus on the mercy seat is in doing his church through all seven ages and showing forth perfectly that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever the never-changing god in his Essence and his ways he says the trouble of it is today we tried to paint a fire and say you know way back in the days of Pentecost they did this now what good does it do to show a freedom man that's freezing to death a painted fire it ain't going to help him one bit nope he's got to have the fire himself and if there's a power of God that made the Pentecostals work for the Lord and do the works and signs that they did if you'll just not paint that picture paint the picture but bring the picture in reality to them they'll get the same experience the same salvation and seal their own testimony the way they did but you got to get it to them can you say Amen you gotta bring the fire to them in other words you've got to be lit yourself you got to get it to them you got you you got to not place it back there in some other generation but bring it up here into this day and age can you say man I want to just tell you about what God done I'm not satisfied with what God does I want to tell you what he's doing right now and I believe he's doing a whole lot and there's a lot that can tell you about it sister you Jane you can tell what God's doing in your life how he's healed your body and he's touched your soul Hallelujah brother Matthew you can tell that God's calling still in this age look what he's done for you is he done it or is he not do y'all have a testimony brother brother Tim you know what God's done for you sister Martha you know what God's done for you he's done a lot brother Mark you know what God's doing for you Hallelujah you young people know you know what God's doing for you hallelujah it's something we're not just talking about it's something that is a reality to us we know we know can you say man yes sir so brother Brown said I believe that that same God that fell on the day of Pentecost upon his church as a pillar of fire and divided himself with cloven tongues among his people is here tonight it's the same God he was then he is today with the same Holy Ghost he said I know it's a paradox is it a paradox yes sir it is because even though the seed died and rotted the life remained and here we are in Harvest Time back to seed again that's a paradox amen he said I know it's a paradox it cannot be explained emotions screaming trying and so forth cannot be explained but it's a paradox how God does it it's the Unseen God dwelling in the human heart making himself visible by vindicating his word that he is the same yesterday today and forever and did you know what brother Bram called that fire and fell on Pentecost Pentecostal fire so you know what kind of fire that Lit the ages it was Pentecostal fire and you say man oh do you love him it'll be wonderful and you know the difference between the two virgins the wise and the foolish of today was fire one didn't keep all in their lamp and their fire went out but there's a bride that still got that Pentecostal fire that's burn and enter Hallelujah and I trust you're one of them that's still just that's just still preaching it can you say man he says go God raise up some preachers that'll go to trimming lamps I'm telling you what we need today is something that'll trim our limb to show the true Pentecostal fire it'll be fire he says in another place that will take the church up into Glory the Pentecostal fire will ratchet it up oh aren't you glad for that Hallelujah the fire and we know where the fire was throughout the Mages and they were with the messengers of the age because Paul or John called him them seven Messengers he called them Stars fire lighting up the night can you say man and Pentecostal fire was within men right there to every age
