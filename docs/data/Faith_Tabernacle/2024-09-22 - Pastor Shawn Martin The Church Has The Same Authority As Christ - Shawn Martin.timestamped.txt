[47:41] praise the Lord and it's good to be home
[47:44] amen and um uh we got home um
[47:49] Thursday um evening and afternoon I
[47:53] should say and so U but had uh a good
[47:57] meeting there in py and uh the Lord
[48:00] seemed to move uh among the people so
[48:03] we're really thankful thankful for that
[48:07] and
[48:08] um also Daniel has asked me to greet you
[48:12] all and uh he is ready to get home and
[48:17] uh he's been in Nicaragua for about two
[48:20] weeks now and uh just had some a good
[48:24] time and uh but I I I think U he he's
[48:28] ready to get home he's he's missing uh
[48:31] uh Britney and the girls and and uh just
[48:35] missing the church and so um anyways he
[48:39] should be home the Lord willing
[48:41] Tuesday and I know uh uh Britney's and
[48:45] and the girls are missing him as
[48:47] well amen and uh so uh but we do want to
[48:51] keep sister paty in our prayer if you'd
[48:54] like to turn with me to uh The Book of
[48:56] Luke first of all uh the 10th chapter
[48:59] but we want to keep her in our prayer uh
[49:02] the Lord was certainly merciful to her
[49:05] and um uh we about lost her you know uh
[49:09] the other day and uh we were thinking
[49:12] she might have had a minor heart attack
[49:14] but the doctor said it was a major uh
[49:17] heart attack and
[49:19] 95% of one of the arteries uh was
[49:22] blocked and I think the other one is um
[49:26] 85% if I'm not mistaken but uh so they
[49:30] were able to to do one of the uh put a
[49:33] stin in one of them the arteries and
[49:36] tomorrow they're going to do the other
[49:38] artery put a stin in and so we want to
[49:41] uh just keep her in a prayer but um the
[49:46] doctor said if all goes well uh they'll
[49:49] be releasing her
[49:50] Tuesday and uh so uh I know she
[49:54] appreciates all your prayers and
[49:57] and um the visits the calls and and
[50:01] these things and uh we also want to keep
[50:04] Shu all in our prayer and uh the Lord
[50:07] will just continue to be with him help
[50:10] him uh I don't understand everything um
[50:15] as far as the you know um the formula
[50:19] that they've been given him uh it's it's
[50:22] not
[50:22] working uh good and um theyed three
[50:27] different formulas and um so the doctors
[50:31] wanting to put a feeding tube in him
[50:33] which would require a surgery and of
[50:37] course you know brother Shmi and sister
[50:39] Bethany don't want that and and
[50:42] understandably so they're ready to get
[50:44] home ready to come home and so we want
[50:47] to just really pray uh uh for that uh
[50:53] situation as the Lord will just move and
[50:56] um we're thankful for the Lord moving as
[50:59] he has um these past three months on the
[51:03] baby uh but uh I believe the Lord can
[51:06] just uh bring them home amen and um um
[51:11] so we we certainly want to keep them in
[51:14] in our prayer also uh brother Amos and
[51:18] sister Lisa they're out of town brother
[51:20] Amos is uh I think ministering in
[51:23] Baltimore and uh so we want to keep them
[51:26] in our prayer today uh the the Fall
[51:30] Festival is coming up November 3rd uh
[51:33] there and so we want to uh uh keep that
[51:37] in mind and uh brother Ben PR uh from
[51:41] Arkansas is going to be ministering uh
[51:44] that day and uh so looking looking
[51:47] forward to that also uh next week Sunday
[51:52] evening uh we'll be having uh question
[51:55] and answers and and um so if you have
[51:58] your questions have questions if you
[52:01] want to send them to me um we'll do our
[52:04] best to to answer them according to uh
[52:09] what the prophet taught and according to
[52:12] the scriptures and um uh believe for a
[52:15] good time and so um but Luke uh the 10th
[52:20] chapter and we're going to read the 19th
[52:25] verse pray praise the Lord it says
[52:28] behold I give unto you power to tread on
[52:31] serpents and scorpions and over all the
[52:34] power of the enemy over all the power of
[52:38] the enemy and nothing shall by any means
[52:42] hurt you isn't that
[52:44] wonderful then if you'll turn with me to
[52:48] um acts 1 and
[52:53] 8 amen Jesus
[52:57] speaking to the
[53:01] church but said but you shall receive
[53:03] power after the Holy Ghost is come upon
[53:07] you and you shall be Witnesses unto me
[53:10] both in Jerusalem and all Judea and
[53:13] Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of
[53:17] the earth amen could we just bow our
[53:21] heads and hearts and talk to our Lord
[53:25] father
[53:27] we bow our heads to the dust from which
[53:30] we've
[53:31] come Lord in humility and in reverence
[53:35] to
[53:36] you realizing that our life is in your
[53:40] hands our past present
[53:44] future and Lord we're just so thankful
[53:48] for the work that you've done in all of
[53:50] our
[53:51] Lives thank you for bringing us here
[53:53] this
[53:54] morning waking us up up with the heart's
[53:57] desire to come to your house and to
[54:00] fellowship with
[54:02] you now Lord we're just asking that you
[54:06] would meet every need that is here
[54:09] father whether it be physically
[54:11] spiritually mentally whatever it would
[54:14] be father may you feel at home to work
[54:20] the
[54:21] supernatural I pray father that you
[54:23] would just help me to get myself out of
[54:26] the away and anoint us Lord speak
[54:30] through me father to your people that
[54:33] when we leave here we be more closer to
[54:36] you better Christians better
[54:40] established father we thank you we love
[54:43] you in Jesus Christ's name amen you can
[54:49] have your seats this
[54:54] morning if I would TI it Le the uh the
[54:59] today's sermon I guess I would title it
[55:02] the church has the same Authority as
[55:06] Christ and you know having power to cast
[55:12] out Devils to heal the sick and to
[55:18] um um to to do these things uh that the
[55:23] disciples had done that even Jesus did
[55:27] healing you know the blind eyes causing
[55:30] them to see raising the dead and those
[55:33] things uh that that is a great thing uh
[55:37] to do I believe that that is still the
[55:40] commission that God has given us to do
[55:43] in this day and I think that's part of
[55:47] the Christianity that's part of the
[55:49] works that the church is to do and Jesus
[55:54] gave the disciples that power to do that
[55:58] uh to go out and to uh cast The Devils
[56:02] out and to to lay their hands on the
[56:05] sick and and these things and and they
[56:08] were rejoicing they they were excited
[56:10] about that that that uh the demons were
[56:14] subject to them and and these things but
[56:17] then Jesus would tell them that don't
[56:20] don't rejoice in the fact that the
[56:23] spirits are subject unto you
[56:27] but rather Rejoice that your name is
[56:30] written in in heaven in in the Lamb's
[56:34] Book of Life Now there there is a reason
[56:38] uh that we should rejoice in that that
[56:41] should be our fundamental reason for uh
[56:45] the foundation for our joy and our
[56:49] worship and our
[56:51] rejoicing because we're all fighting a
[56:54] spiritual warfare
[56:57] I don't think that there's one here this
[56:59] morning or maybe listening online that
[57:04] that isn't you know without a battle
[57:07] we're all fighting a battle it's it's a
[57:10] and and we all have an
[57:13] adversary and you know the Bible there
[57:15] in 1 Peter 5 and8 it says be sober be
[57:19] vigilant for your adversary your
[57:22] adversary so you got a personal
[57:25] adversary
[57:26] and uh the ad your adversary the devil
[57:30] as a roaring lion he's walking about
[57:34] seeking whom he may devour so the whole
[57:37] point is to devour you and and not
[57:41] necessarily I mean not necessarily to
[57:44] take you out of existence uh from the
[57:47] earth per se even though you know that
[57:50] that he does that too but uh there's so
[57:53] many people that have been divided in
[57:55] their spirit spiritual walk that they go
[57:58] to church and they claing Christianity
[58:00] but they're just an empty shell it's
[58:03] just a religion it's just a duty it's
[58:06] just a form of godliness and and these
[58:09] things so but but we all have this
[58:12] adversary and he's seeking to destroy us
[58:15] and and and and so but in in that uh uh
[58:19] and that that sounds awful it sounds
[58:22] scary but yet it's not because there's
[58:25] going to be somebody to
[58:27] overcome someone is is going to to and I
[58:32] I just believe that there's a people on
[58:34] the Earth and and people in here that
[58:38] are uh going to overcome the the Bible
[58:41] says that there's going to be an
[58:43] overcomer and and Revelations 12:11 says
[58:47] they overcame him by the blood of the
[58:49] lamb and by the word of their testimony
[58:52] and they love not their lives unto the
[58:55] death it's interesting that this
[58:57] scripture is is written as though it's
[59:00] past tense they overcame him as though
[59:04] it was already done in the past and and
[59:08] uh uh uh these things and and yet uh uh
[59:12] here we are still in the process of
[59:16] overcoming but yet we're tied to that
[59:19] scripture amen they overcame him by the
[59:22] blood of the Lamb uh uh but yet this
[59:26] tells us that overcoming is a certain
[59:29] thing it's it's a sure thing it's
[59:32] overcoming a a people to overcome in
[59:36] this age is not an iffy thing it's not
[59:39] shaky but somebody's going to overcome
[59:42] because it's already written that that
[59:45] they've overcame and it's not written
[59:48] that they're going to overcome but it's
[59:50] written they overcame and that's just
[59:53] how sure that God's word is ain't that
[59:57] right amen God's word cannot lie and so
[1:00:01] we have been given power to overcome
[1:00:05] amen not just power to heal the sick
[1:00:08] power to raise the dead power over the
[1:00:11] same but power to overcome that that's
[1:00:15] what we've been given and and to me
[1:00:18] that's a greater thing uh than than just
[1:00:22] power amen uh to uh to you know to cause
[1:00:27] blind eyes to come open and and these
[1:00:30] things now you know in in this we we are
[1:00:33] made up of three parts and the prophet
[1:00:35] taught us this that it you know we are a
[1:00:38] body uh spirit and soul and and and he's
[1:00:42] taught us that our you know our bodies
[1:00:45] have our body has the five inlets The
[1:00:47] Taste feel hear smell and and sight and
[1:00:51] and it's with these senses that we have
[1:00:54] contact in the physical
[1:00:56] Rim uh uh we we can you know we can
[1:01:00] touch the pulpit we can taste our food
[1:01:02] we can you know we can smell and uh
[1:01:05] different different uh uh um uh smells
[1:01:08] and and and things like that and and
[1:01:11] we're able to contact by the senses the
[1:01:14] outward the Earthly and then we have our
[1:01:17] spirit that has five inlets uh uh senses
[1:01:21] and and it's memory affection conscience
[1:01:24] reasoning and imag ination and and the
[1:01:28] prophet said with these senses we are
[1:01:30] able to contact the spirit world you you
[1:01:33] can't contact the spirit world with your
[1:01:36] Earthly senses uh but but now we're able
[1:01:39] to go and and and there's a world that
[1:01:41] is unseen and by these five senses of
[1:01:45] memory and reasoning and conscience and
[1:01:48] and affection and and and these things
[1:01:51] then uh we're able to contact the spirit
[1:01:54] world now Satan has access to these
[1:01:58] inlets um he's has access to the the F
[1:02:02] the senses of the body the senses of the
[1:02:04] spirit and he tries to use these to his
[1:02:08] Advantage uh uh there and and so uh but
[1:02:12] then the prophet says but inside of that
[1:02:15] inside of that Spirit uh your spirit
[1:02:18] you've got a soul and that soul is that
[1:02:22] Gene that come from God
[1:02:26] that is where you're
[1:02:27] transformed from Sinner and and and uh
[1:02:32] uh uh uh you know Beggars and vagabonds
[1:02:37] and worthless you're transformed from
[1:02:40] that to being Sons and Daughters of God
[1:02:43] do you believe that amen see and so now
[1:02:47] the prophet taught us that the soul is
[1:02:49] you amen you you may see this but you've
[1:02:52] not seen me you've just seen the body
[1:02:55] that I'm living in and this body is an
[1:02:58] expression of what really is inside but
[1:03:01] inside of this is me ain't that right
[1:03:04] amen and when I go to to meet the Lord
[1:03:08] amen whether if I go by the way of the
[1:03:10] Grave this body remains but I have gone
[1:03:14] and so all you see is just the
[1:03:16] Tabernacle the corpse ain't that right
[1:03:19] but uh the soul is really what I am and
[1:03:23] and the prophet told us that the control
[1:03:26] tower is is in the soul that's that's
[1:03:30] where the real Authority comes from is
[1:03:33] down in the soul and and it's either God
[1:03:37] or Satan that controls you ain't that
[1:03:40] right amen because that is the control
[1:03:43] tower and the ability to
[1:03:46] overcome depends on what you are
[1:03:49] controlled by amen now if you're
[1:03:52] controlled by the devil then then you'll
[1:03:54] never be able to overcome now you may
[1:03:57] shout and you may speak in tongues and
[1:03:59] you can may even pray for the sick or
[1:04:01] you can even preach or you can play the
[1:04:03] music and and all that but if that soul
[1:04:06] is under the control of of the devil
[1:04:10] then there's no overcoming power ain't
[1:04:12] that right now so so when now we need
[1:04:16] this Authority we we got to have this
[1:04:18] Authority because we were all born
[1:04:20] Sinners um born in sin shaped in
[1:04:23] iniquity we all know these things and
[1:04:25] we've all have a carnal nature and that
[1:04:28] carnal nature is enity against God it's
[1:04:32] an enemy to God it cannot become subject
[1:04:35] to the laws of God and and it it does it
[1:04:38] it's contrary to the laws of God Lives
[1:04:41] contrary to the laws of God ain't that
[1:04:43] right now we know the law of God is the
[1:04:45] word of God and and so it can never come
[1:04:48] subject to that and and so but this
[1:04:50] carnal nature brother bradam said this
[1:04:53] nature is sticky it's a it's a sticky
[1:04:56] nature and it will be until this new
[1:05:00] life has been fully been developed out
[1:05:03] of the ground and raised up again ain't
[1:05:06] that right now now because that we have
[1:05:09] a carnal nature amen and and we've all
[1:05:12] been born with it then there's things
[1:05:15] that we understand about this world and
[1:05:18] and the Bible uh Paul would talk about
[1:05:20] it or Peter uh the Bible talks about it
[1:05:24] uh the lust of the flesh
[1:05:26] the pride of life the lust of the eyes
[1:05:29] ain't that right and and we deal with
[1:05:32] temper we deal with passions we we we
[1:05:35] deal with roots of bitterness remember
[1:05:38] the Bible says don't let root of
[1:05:39] bitterness uh uh uh get get get in you
[1:05:42] now he's talking to Holy Ghost filled
[1:05:44] people but yet because of a carnal
[1:05:47] nature we we have that tendency we got
[1:05:50] to fight these things that that come
[1:05:53] upon us of Gossip un belief and and and
[1:05:57] and and all of these anxieties and and
[1:06:01] and fear and and all of these things uh
[1:06:05] uh we we become subject to these things
[1:06:08] we be get bothered by these complexes
[1:06:11] and hurts and and all of these things
[1:06:14] you understand see and and so uh uh uh
[1:06:18] uh we we deal with these things but can
[1:06:20] these things be conquered yes they can
[1:06:24] be conquered
[1:06:26] they can be conquered if you're part of
[1:06:29] the Church of the Living God Amen they
[1:06:33] can be conquered see and and so because
[1:06:36] it is the church that has been given the
[1:06:40] authority been given power now when we
[1:06:43] speak of the church we're not referring
[1:06:44] to Catholic church or Baptist or
[1:06:46] Pentecostal or or or whatever we're not
[1:06:49] speaking of of of denomination and you
[1:06:52] know there we're not even speaking of
[1:06:54] inter denominational churches uh uh you
[1:06:58] know there's only one Church everybody
[1:07:00] say there's one church that God
[1:07:03] recognizes and that's the body of Jesus
[1:07:06] Christ that's the church that Jesus said
[1:07:09] Upon This Rock I'll build my church and
[1:07:13] the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against
[1:07:16] it ain't that right now that church is
[1:07:19] inter denominational church and it's
[1:07:22] it's a world Universal Church ain't that
[1:07:24] right a worldwide universal church amen
[1:07:27] and so now every person must be a part
[1:07:31] of this church not Faith Tabernacle but
[1:07:33] the church that Jesus promised to build
[1:07:36] in in in order to exercise the power
[1:07:40] that's been given to it can you say Amen
[1:07:44] the power that's been given to it and
[1:07:46] and we know that it's impossible to join
[1:07:49] this church amen you've got to be born
[1:07:52] into the church You by a new birth ain't
[1:07:55] that RH amen you you you know uh you you
[1:07:58] wasn't uh you didn't join brother Bill
[1:08:01] you didn't join the Bradberry family you
[1:08:04] were born into it it it was just a birth
[1:08:07] amen by that see and and so same way is
[1:08:10] it in this amen uh we we're born into
[1:08:14] the family of God to the Church of God
[1:08:17] then and first uh Corinthians 1213 for
[1:08:20] by one Spirit one Spirit many spirits
[1:08:23] but one Spirit one we are all baptized
[1:08:27] into one body can you say Amen one
[1:08:31] Spirit we're baptized not by a water
[1:08:34] baptism it's a spirit baptism you can be
[1:08:38] you can you can be baptized so many
[1:08:40] times till the T poost know your social
[1:08:42] security number and and that ain't going
[1:08:45] to get you into the church you've got to
[1:08:47] have a spirit baptism by one Spirit are
[1:08:51] we baptized into one body ain't that
[1:08:54] right so it's the Spirit baptism that
[1:08:57] puts us into the church which is the
[1:08:59] body of Christ amen now if if you look
[1:09:04] uh uh there's something about this uh
[1:09:07] being part of the church now Romans 6
[1:09:10] and 1 we'll start there but it says what
[1:09:13] shall we say then shall we continue in
[1:09:16] sin that Grace May abound amen should we
[1:09:20] just continue indulging in the things of
[1:09:23] the world smoking and gambling and and
[1:09:26] committing adultery and and cussing and
[1:09:30] and whatever else we've done you know
[1:09:32] shall we cons sin you in this that Grace
[1:09:35] May abound unto us God forbid no ain't
[1:09:39] that right how shall we that are dead to
[1:09:43] sin live any longer uh therein know ye
[1:09:48] not that as many of us as were baptized
[1:09:52] Spirit baptism into Jesus Christ CHR
[1:09:55] were baptized into his death therefore
[1:09:58] we are buried with him by baptism Spirit
[1:10:02] baptism into death like uh that like as
[1:10:06] Christ was raised up from the dead by
[1:10:08] the glory of the father even so also
[1:10:11] should we walk in newness of Life can
[1:10:15] you say Amen so there is a newness of
[1:10:18] life when we come into the the church
[1:10:22] and become part of of the body of Jesus
[1:10:26] Christ for if we have been planted
[1:10:28] together in the likeness of his death we
[1:10:31] shall also uh be in the likeness of his
[1:10:35] resurrection knowing this that our old
[1:10:37] man is crucified with him that the body
[1:10:41] of sin might be destroyed that
[1:10:44] henceforth we should not serf sin amen
[1:10:47] see we we we uh uh yes it sin might have
[1:10:51] been enjoyable amen because the Bible
[1:10:54] calls it a plag pleasure amen for a
[1:10:57] season but yet while it was a pleasure
[1:11:00] it was you was actually serving sin you
[1:11:04] were a slave to sin you were in bondage
[1:11:08] to sin ain't that right amen it wasn't
[1:11:10] just a choice so to speak it was a
[1:11:13] bondage you you become a slave to this
[1:11:16] thing A lot of people are slave to
[1:11:18] passions they're they're a slave to
[1:11:21] temper they're they're a slave to fear
[1:11:23] and anxieties they're they're a slaved
[1:11:27] to to to whatever Satan has to offer
[1:11:30] ain't that right they become slaves to
[1:11:33] these things and but God didn't call us
[1:11:36] to be slaves Amen to the passions of the
[1:11:40] world he he didn't call us to be slaves
[1:11:43] to that cell phone and to the internet
[1:11:46] and and to the to the naked women and to
[1:11:49] the uh uh to the all the fith that are
[1:11:51] out there he didn't call us to be slaves
[1:11:54] to these things see amen so he that is
[1:11:57] dead is free everybody say I'm free I'm
[1:12:01] free from sin I'm free from sin see amen
[1:12:06] see now if we be dead with Christ we
[1:12:09] believe that we shall also live with him
[1:12:13] knowing that Christ being raised from
[1:12:15] the dead dieth no more death hath no
[1:12:19] more dominion over him for in that he
[1:12:22] died he died un sin one but in that he
[1:12:26] liveth he liveth unto God see amen
[1:12:30] likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be
[1:12:33] dead indeed under sin but alive under
[1:12:37] God through Jesus Christ Our Lord aren't
[1:12:40] you glad for that that you can be alive
[1:12:42] unto God you can be more conscious of
[1:12:44] God than you are conscience of the sin
[1:12:47] and the field of this world you can
[1:12:49] become alive to the powers of God and
[1:12:52] the realities of God more than you are
[1:12:55] alive to the things of this world Amen
[1:12:59] that's what it means you're alive unto
[1:13:00] God Amen you were alive unto sin you
[1:13:03] amen you come to church sometime and and
[1:13:06] you didn't even understand why they
[1:13:08] shouted and why they rejoiced and you
[1:13:10] didn't understand the things of God Amen
[1:13:12] why do we need to preach it and why do
[1:13:14] we need to go to church and why do we
[1:13:16] need to do this amen but you never
[1:13:18] questioned about going to the baseball
[1:13:20] games you never questioned about getting
[1:13:22] up at 3:00 in the morning to go hunting
[1:13:24] you never question questioned about all
[1:13:25] that because you were more alive to the
[1:13:27] pleasure of sins and the pleasure of
[1:13:30] this world I'm not talking saying
[1:13:32] hunting is is a sin amen but you
[1:13:34] understand what I'm saying we were a
[1:13:36] more alive to the things of the world
[1:13:39] than we were to the things of God but
[1:13:41] now that we've died under sin we are
[1:13:44] more alive to the things of God Amen we
[1:13:47] can understand why they Rejoice because
[1:13:50] we Rejoice we understand there's a home
[1:13:53] amen that is more of reality than our
[1:13:56] natural home and we're going to that
[1:13:58] home it's a uh more of a reality to us
[1:14:02] than the things of this
[1:14:04] world so likewise you also reckon
[1:14:07] yourself to be dead indeed unto sin but
[1:14:10] alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our
[1:14:13] Lord now notice what he says let not sin
[1:14:17] let not sin therefore reain in your
[1:14:19] mortal body you're free from sin you're
[1:14:23] free from it you're not servant to sin
[1:14:26] but that doesn't mean that sin is trying
[1:14:28] to take over you it doesn't mean that
[1:14:31] that carnal flesh amen ain't trying to
[1:14:34] rule you but now you don't have to abide
[1:14:37] by that you don't have to give in to
[1:14:39] that let not sin Rule and reign in your
[1:14:43] mortal
[1:14:45] body that you should obey it in the lust
[1:14:48] thereof see he's talking to people that
[1:14:50] have been
[1:14:51] free ain't that right neither you yeld
[1:14:55] your your members as instruments of
[1:14:57] unrighteousness Unto sin but yield
[1:15:00] yourselves unto God yield don't yield to
[1:15:04] the devil yield yourselves to God can
[1:15:07] you say Amen so this tells us it's not
[1:15:10] an automatic thing amen you got to yield
[1:15:13] yourself amen and how do you yield
[1:15:16] yourself Paul says I Die daily I Die
[1:15:18] daily to the passions I Die daily to the
[1:15:21] anxieties I Die daily to my wants I Die
[1:15:24] daily to what this flesh is trying to
[1:15:26] get me to do and I have the power and
[1:15:29] the authority to do
[1:15:34] so neither yield your members as
[1:15:37] instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin
[1:15:39] but yield yourselves unto God as though
[1:15:43] that as those that are alive from the
[1:15:45] dead and your members as instruments of
[1:15:49] righteousness unto God for sin everybody
[1:15:51] say for sin shall not have dominion over
[1:15:55] me sin shall not have dominion over me
[1:15:59] for you are not under the law but under
[1:16:01] grace aren't you glad for Grace amen if
[1:16:04] it had not been for Grace I'd still be a
[1:16:06] slave to sin I'd still be serving sin
[1:16:10] amen but now it's the grace of God that
[1:16:12] has freed me Amen to where I'm no longer
[1:16:16] a slave to that old thing I'm not a
[1:16:18] slave to habits I'm not a slave to this
[1:16:21] flesh there is something within me I am
[1:16:24] free
[1:16:25] [Music]
[1:16:27] hallah now notice the prophet said our
[1:16:29] Dominion is the dominion over sin and it
[1:16:33] is inforced through the power that is in
[1:16:36] the spirit of Christ that indwells us
[1:16:41] our Dominion is the dominion over sin
[1:16:44] and it is enforced through the power
[1:16:46] that is in the spirit of Christ that
[1:16:48] indwells in us now notice sin is
[1:16:52] unbelief do you believe that
[1:16:55] sin is
[1:16:57] unbelief now I want to just continue on
[1:17:00] here 1 John 3:9 whosoever is born of
[1:17:05] God does not everybody say does not
[1:17:09] commit
[1:17:10] sin for his seed remaineth in him and he
[1:17:15] cannot sin because he's born of God now
[1:17:19] the legalist will take that and say well
[1:17:21] you know if if you if you make your
[1:17:23] mistake brother beill then then you
[1:17:25] ain't got the seed of God that's not
[1:17:27] what what is saying here at all now
[1:17:30] notice we'll go on see he cannot sin
[1:17:34] amen uh uh say that again whosoever is
[1:17:37] born of God does not commit sin in other
[1:17:40] words does not disbelieve everybody say
[1:17:43] disbelieve does not disbelieve for his
[1:17:47] seed his seed Prophet said God's seed
[1:17:51] see the word is that seed REM remains in
[1:17:56] him in in his flesh nope in his Spirit
[1:18:00] nope in his soul the word that genan
[1:18:05] seed word remains in him see the man and
[1:18:12] he cannot sin he cannot disbelieve
[1:18:15] because he is born of God ain't that
[1:18:17] right now Hebrews 10:26 talking about
[1:18:20] the authority now amen Hebrews 10:26 for
[1:18:24] if we sin or disbelieve
[1:18:27] willfully see after we that we have
[1:18:30] received the knowledge of the truth
[1:18:32] there remaineth no more sacrifice for
[1:18:34] sins legalists have taught us that that
[1:18:37] this applies to everybody that if you if
[1:18:40] you ever sin amen you come to a time
[1:18:43] that there's no sin uh uh sacrifice for
[1:18:46] these sins the prophet said that
[1:18:47] scripture doesn't even apply to
[1:18:49] Christians amen that they've got an
[1:18:52] authority there that and and this
[1:18:54] scripture doesn't even apply to it can
[1:18:57] you say Amen it it doesn't Paul is not
[1:19:00] talking to the Christian that real
[1:19:01] believer because he is the one who
[1:19:04] cannot sin he's the one that cannot
[1:19:10] disbelieve Lord now it doesn't might
[1:19:13] mean that we don't have sins in the
[1:19:17] sense of this old flesh the sins that
[1:19:20] that we make our mistakes we fall we
[1:19:23] come short
[1:19:25] of the glory of God we we we have our
[1:19:28] failures now notice why the prophet said
[1:19:30] God by Grace saved you not you yourself
[1:19:33] see if you do you got something to brag
[1:19:36] about but you haven't got nothing to
[1:19:37] brag about all Praises goes to him it's
[1:19:41] him then he's give you the sure hope
[1:19:45] sure hope see swore by an oath the
[1:19:48] impossibility for his children to ever
[1:19:51] be lost
[1:19:56] amen it's impossible for his children to
[1:20:00] ever be lost why his seed remaineth in
[1:20:03] him the seed God's seed remains in that
[1:20:08] man in that woman in that boy in that
[1:20:12] girl down in the
[1:20:14] soul that's ain't that right now they'll
[1:20:18] get weapons for doing wrong you reap
[1:20:20] what you sow you get that see now now
[1:20:23] don't think now you just going out and
[1:20:26] sin and get by with it if you do and got
[1:20:28] that attitude it shows you've never been
[1:20:30] born again you get it if you still got
[1:20:33] the desire in you to do the wrong then
[1:20:36] you're still wrong for he has perfected
[1:20:38] forever those that is see see and those
[1:20:42] beasts under the Old Testament under
[1:20:44] legal days offered yearly continually
[1:20:47] could never take away sin but when we
[1:20:49] put our hands upon his head and confess
[1:20:53] our sins and our Born Again of the
[1:20:55] spirit of God we have no more desire of
[1:20:58] sin you're no longer the slave to sin
[1:21:02] that desire is gone you used to want to
[1:21:04] go out and party you used to want to go
[1:21:07] out and drink you used to want to lust
[1:21:09] after them women you used to do all
[1:21:11] these things that never think nothing of
[1:21:12] it you loved it you you were glad for it
[1:21:16] you enjoyed it you indulged in
[1:21:19] it on now that's what made you the a
[1:21:22] slave to it was the desire
[1:21:27] can you say Amen you wanted that big you
[1:21:31] wanted to get out and cuss and hang
[1:21:32] around the worldly
[1:21:34] people come on now come on church it's
[1:21:38] the truth
[1:21:40] right see what is it see there was a
[1:21:44] desire see but when we put our hands
[1:21:46] upon his head and confess our sins and a
[1:21:49] born again of the spirit of God we have
[1:21:52] no more desire of sin sin has has passed
[1:21:55] from
[1:21:57] you ain't that right and he says and
[1:22:00] that's for Time and
[1:22:02] Eternity can never if sin has passed
[1:22:05] from you you can never be a sinner in
[1:22:08] the sight of God again it's not being a
[1:22:11] saint today and a sinner tomorrow you
[1:22:13] can never be a sinner sin has passed
[1:22:17] from
[1:22:18] [Applause]
[1:22:20] you what an
[1:22:22] authority now he says you'll make mist
[1:22:24] mistakes you'll fall you'll willfully do
[1:22:28] wrong you'll go out sometimes and do
[1:22:31] things that don't mean you're lost that
[1:22:33] means you're going to get a weapon that
[1:22:36] means you're going to get a
[1:22:39] correction can you say Amen why because
[1:22:42] we're in this old flesh we're tempted
[1:22:45] we're we we we we got that sticky
[1:22:49] nature that's right ain't that right he
[1:22:53] said my little boy lots of times my
[1:22:55] children will do things yours does too
[1:22:57] and they know it's against your rules
[1:23:00] and they know what to expect when they
[1:23:02] when they do it they're going to get a
[1:23:04] weapon for it sometimes a good one but
[1:23:07] it's still your child certainly see it's
[1:23:11] impossible for that man to ever be gone
[1:23:14] again that's once being born of eternal
[1:23:17] life God's not an Indian
[1:23:20] giver give it take it away give it take
[1:23:23] it away
[1:23:26] ain't that right see so he says see he
[1:23:29] that heareth my words and believeth on
[1:23:31] him that sent me has everlasting life
[1:23:34] and shall never everybody say shall
[1:23:36] never come into
[1:23:39] judgment but is passed from Death unto
[1:23:42] life and I'm going to raise him up at
[1:23:45] the last
[1:23:46] days amen oh what a law what a
[1:23:51] word ain't that right that's God's
[1:23:54] promise now if you go on and say well oh
[1:23:57] well then I can just do he says I always
[1:24:01] do what I want to
[1:24:03] do how many just does what you want to
[1:24:06] do you're free to do whatever you want
[1:24:09] to
[1:24:12] do there's no law to
[1:24:17] this I've said it before I'll say it
[1:24:20] again might shock you go out you can go
[1:24:21] out and smoke as many cigarettes as you
[1:24:23] wanted to smoke yeah I drink all the
[1:24:26] beer I want to drink the problem is I
[1:24:28] don't want to drink it the desire's gone
[1:24:32] it ain't somebody telling me well you
[1:24:34] better not do this and you better not do
[1:24:35] this sister Brenda and you better not do
[1:24:37] this no no no I'm free to do whatever I
[1:24:40] want to do but I'm no longer a slave to
[1:24:44] sin I don't have to come up here and
[1:24:46] beat the people
[1:24:48] up God ain't trying to beat you into
[1:24:51] submission he freed you from sin in to
[1:24:55] where now you're free to serve
[1:24:58] godall that's right see I always do what
[1:25:02] I want to do amen but if you're a
[1:25:05] Christian you don't want to do the thing
[1:25:06] that's wrong because the very life in
[1:25:09] you the very Foundation if you want to
[1:25:11] do wrong it shows you shows the wrong
[1:25:13] thing is in there how can bitter and
[1:25:16] sweet water come from the same Fountain
[1:25:19] so you've been all mixed up on some kind
[1:25:21] of emotion or fabulous something
[1:25:24] something another sensation forget it go
[1:25:27] back to the Altar and say God take my
[1:25:29] old sinful life away and put me in such
[1:25:31] a condition that my whole desire
[1:25:34] changes see he that's born of God does
[1:25:37] not commit sin he has no desire to do so
[1:25:41] certainly certainly the devil will trap
[1:25:44] him here and there but not willfully the
[1:25:47] Bible said so the devil will trap him
[1:25:49] now and then and and sure he will he
[1:25:52] tried to throw a trap for our lord Jesus
[1:25:55] he did to Moses and caught him he did it
[1:25:57] to Peter and caught him he did to so
[1:26:00] many see Peter even denied him but then
[1:26:03] he went and wept bitterly because there
[1:26:05] was something in him
[1:26:09] that's amen glory you love the
[1:26:14] Lord says when the dove was turned out
[1:26:17] of the Ark the crow went out and called
[1:26:19] around he called
[1:26:21] around see he was in the ark all right
[1:26:23] but he went out his nature was different
[1:26:26] he could eat all all the old dead
[1:26:27] carcasses he wanted to and be
[1:26:30] satisfied why he was a crow to begin
[1:26:34] with he was a scavenger he was no
[1:26:38] good I think that's why a lot of people
[1:26:40] can live without church so long they
[1:26:43] they can live without prayer they can
[1:26:45] live without Bibles uh uh reading they
[1:26:48] they can live without listening to
[1:26:49] messages they they can live without
[1:26:51] these things it it they they can do and
[1:26:54] they they they they can you know I mean
[1:26:57] they don't have to why it's a
[1:27:01] nature come into the ark anytime he
[1:27:03] wants to and leave anytime he wants to
[1:27:05] it doesn't bother
[1:27:08] him it's the
[1:27:10] nature see he was a crow to begin with
[1:27:13] he was a scavenger he was no good he was
[1:27:15] a hypocrite who sat on the roost with
[1:27:17] the dove just as big as the dove was he
[1:27:19] could fly anywhere the dove could fly
[1:27:21] but he could eat but he could eat good
[1:27:24] food just as the dove ate and then he
[1:27:27] could eat rotten food what the dove
[1:27:30] couldn't
[1:27:32] eat for the dove is a different mixup
[1:27:35] she's a different make she's a dove and
[1:27:37] the doll can Dove cannot digest rotten
[1:27:40] food because it don't have any Gall and
[1:27:43] a man that's born of the spirit of God
[1:27:45] becomes a dove of God his nature his
[1:27:47] change his makeup see yes sir you put
[1:27:50] the spirit of the dove in the crow he'
[1:27:52] never sit on a dead carcass
[1:27:55] see if he lit down by mistake he'd
[1:27:57] certainly get away quick he couldn't
[1:27:59] stand it see and a man that's born in
[1:28:01] spirit of God just cannot tolerate see
[1:28:04] he can't he might light in a barroom
[1:28:06] sometime but he'll get out of there just
[1:28:09] out of there quick a he a a woman might
[1:28:12] entice him to get him to turn uh around
[1:28:15] but he'll turn his head again he'll get
[1:28:18] away from there real quick why he's a
[1:28:21] dove how many doves do we have I'm many
[1:28:24] a dove ain't that right see well he says
[1:28:27] you ain't going to fool him because he
[1:28:29] knows my sheep know my voice and a
[1:28:31] stranger they will not follow he's a
[1:28:33] dove to begin with there is what I'm
[1:28:35] speaking about the actual something that
[1:28:38] anchors in
[1:28:40] [Music]
[1:28:42] there now as Christians we war against
[1:28:45] the flesh that's the battle that we all
[1:28:48] go through
[1:28:50] amen we war against it we don't give
[1:28:52] into it
[1:28:54] we
[1:28:56] War
[1:28:58] now and and it might seem that the
[1:29:00] people out out there in the world and
[1:29:02] even modern
[1:29:04] Christians out out in the nominal
[1:29:06] Christians or whatever they they're just
[1:29:08] so indulgent they're just
[1:29:10] happy happy because there's nothing
[1:29:13] there to fight against they're happy
[1:29:16] with what they're doing they'll fight
[1:29:18] against the word more than they will the
[1:29:22] wrong but we're fighting against the
[1:29:28] sin we're fighting against the things
[1:29:30] that so easily beset
[1:29:33] us amen cuz we're trying to run a race
[1:29:36] we're trying to achieve
[1:29:39] something
[1:29:41] amen ain't that right now notice Romans
[1:29:46] 7:14 Paul describes the
[1:29:49] Warfare he says for we know that the law
[1:29:52] is spiritual but I am carnal so under
[1:29:54] sin for that which I do I allow not for
[1:29:58] what I would that I do not that I yeah
[1:30:02] that that do I not but what I hate that
[1:30:05] do I then if then I do that which I
[1:30:09] would not I consent unto the law that uh
[1:30:12] that it is good now then it is no more
[1:30:15] that I that doeth it but sin that
[1:30:17] dwelleth in me for I know that in me
[1:30:21] that is in my flesh now I want to say
[1:30:25] this now you know some teach that this
[1:30:27] is Paul talking as a sinner that's not
[1:30:31] true Paul is speaking as a converted man
[1:30:35] been born
[1:30:36] again amen can you say
[1:30:40] Amen but yet he says sin that dwelleth
[1:30:43] in me for I know that in me that is in
[1:30:46] my
[1:30:47] flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will
[1:30:51] is present with me but how to perform
[1:30:54] that which is good I find not for the
[1:30:57] good that I would I do not but the evil
[1:31:00] which I would not that I do for now if I
[1:31:04] do that I would not it is no more I do
[1:31:07] it I that doeth it but sin that dwelleth
[1:31:10] in me I find then a law that when I
[1:31:13] would do good evil is present with
[1:31:17] me that sticky nature is still
[1:31:21] there amen and that right but notice the
[1:31:26] 22nd verse for I Delight after the law
[1:31:31] of
[1:31:32] God after or Delight in the law of God
[1:31:36] after the inward
[1:31:38] man can you say Amen see the desire for
[1:31:42] sin is
[1:31:44] gone now my desire is delighting in the
[1:31:47] laws of God the word of God after the
[1:31:50] inward man not the flesh
[1:31:54] come
[1:31:54] on Amen but I see another law in my
[1:31:58] members warning against the law of my
[1:32:00] mind and bringing me into captivity to
[1:32:02] the law of sin which is in my members oh
[1:32:05] Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver
[1:32:07] me from the body of this death I thank
[1:32:09] God through the Lord through Jesus
[1:32:11] Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I
[1:32:13] I myself serve the law of God but with
[1:32:16] the the flesh the law of sin now brother
[1:32:21] brandham really describes this and I
[1:32:24] won't go into it but uh maybe another
[1:32:27] time we can get more into it but he
[1:32:29] talks about it's the flesh the flesh is
[1:32:31] basically it's
[1:32:34] backsliding the flesh is
[1:32:36] carnal the flesh we always got to put up
[1:32:39] with the
[1:32:40] flesh the flesh doesn't want to go to
[1:32:43] church the flesh would rather be at a
[1:32:45] ball game than than than come to the
[1:32:47] house of God the flesh gets embarrassed
[1:32:49] when we all get excited about the things
[1:32:51] of God but the flesh sure doesn't get
[1:32:53] excited when you're teams
[1:32:57] winning the flesh so tired to
[1:33:02] pray but the flesh doesn't get so ex get
[1:33:05] get too tired to get up and go
[1:33:07] shopping
[1:33:10] go there's people standing in line you
[1:33:13] know on on on black
[1:33:16] Fridays way early in the
[1:33:18] morning they go get that good
[1:33:22] deal flesh doesn't question all that
[1:33:25] they get excited about that but when it
[1:33:26] comes to the house of God when it comes
[1:33:28] to prayer when it comes to putting the
[1:33:30] TVs away when it comes to putting all
[1:33:33] these other things and devoting yourself
[1:33:35] to God the flesh doesn't want
[1:33:39] that that's right so it's the flesh that
[1:33:42] makes the
[1:33:44] excuses flesh doesn't want to praise God
[1:33:46] I'm too
[1:33:47] sick that's right right the flesh the
[1:33:52] flesh reason with God's word so there is
[1:33:55] that constant
[1:33:59] battle there is that constant Warfare
[1:34:03] that that that that conflict between the
[1:34:06] outward man and the inward
[1:34:11] man ain't that
[1:34:13] right but notice Jesus gave the church
[1:34:17] power that word power means
[1:34:20] Authority ain't that right John 1 12 but
[1:34:24] as many as received him received the
[1:34:27] word for their day he was the Living
[1:34:30] Word ain't that right when you see God
[1:34:33] doing it and vindicating his word that's
[1:34:35] him and as many as received him to them
[1:34:40] gave he power or authority to become
[1:34:44] sons of
[1:34:46] [Applause]
[1:34:48] God that's right
[1:34:50] amen yeah we don't have power to heal
[1:34:53] the
[1:34:55] sick we don't have the power to save The
[1:34:57] Sinner to raise the dead we don't have
[1:34:59] power to cast out demons but we have an
[1:35:03] authority ain't that right brother
[1:35:06] Brandon described it as the like the
[1:35:08] policeman that stands out in the
[1:35:11] intersection he's standing there at the
[1:35:13] intersection directing traffic y'all
[1:35:15] y'all seen it right or maybe at the
[1:35:18] school you know at in in the school zone
[1:35:21] there you know you go to blackburg and
[1:35:23] there'll be a place at the end of the
[1:35:24] day when school is out and he's standing
[1:35:26] out there directing
[1:35:29] traffic now he ain't got enough power to
[1:35:33] you know to stop a
[1:35:35] flea and he certainly ain't got enough
[1:35:38] power to stop them automobills that are
[1:35:41] coming
[1:35:42] through but what he does have he has a
[1:35:44] badge of
[1:35:46] authority that stops
[1:35:49] everything right right sure does well
[1:35:53] see see then then that that that that's
[1:35:56] the church God doesn't have to have
[1:35:58] muscled up people he doesn't have to
[1:36:01] have talented people he doesn't have to
[1:36:04] have people so well put together
[1:36:07] educated people rich people smart people
[1:36:11] but what people he does have he's given
[1:36:14] them the authority you may be as poor as
[1:36:17] poor it can be but if you're part of the
[1:36:20] church you've been given an authority to
[1:36:22] stop every demon in his tracks you have
[1:36:26] the authority Amen to stop that devil
[1:36:29] from working in your life you've got the
[1:36:31] authority to stop the devil from working
[1:36:34] in your home working in your church
[1:36:37] working in your mind you have that
[1:36:41] Authority you're no match to the devil
[1:36:44] without an
[1:36:49] authority amen GL Hallelujah we have the
[1:36:54] badge of authority that's right the
[1:36:57] prophet said it's not a
[1:36:58] denomination it's the power of the
[1:37:01] resurrection of Christ in each
[1:37:03] individual
[1:37:05] life he gave all the power and authority
[1:37:09] that he had to his
[1:37:12] church prise the Lord no excuse say well
[1:37:15] he did it he was God the authority
[1:37:17] belongs to
[1:37:19] you can you say
[1:37:21] amen he had to give us this author
[1:37:23] Authority because all Demons of hell has
[1:37:27] been Unleashed in this day but you will
[1:37:29] not succumb to it you've got an
[1:37:33] authority I don't care how bad the age
[1:37:35] is I don't care how deceitful the age is
[1:37:37] you've got an
[1:37:43] authority look at the authority that
[1:37:45] Jesus had the Bible says he taught he
[1:37:49] taught as one having Authority yes
[1:37:52] sir than
[1:37:54] that Authority that the chief priest
[1:37:56] didn't even have that when he taught he
[1:37:59] taught his one having an
[1:38:02] authority and everybody recognized it
[1:38:05] the church recognized it The Sinner
[1:38:07] recognized it the poor the rich whatever
[1:38:11] when they heard him this is a man of
[1:38:15] authority prise the Lord the Bible also
[1:38:18] says with authority he commanded the
[1:38:20] unclean spirits and they obeyed him
[1:38:24] why he was God in human flesh can you
[1:38:29] say that with me he was God in human
[1:38:32] flesh God was in Christ reconciling the
[1:38:35] world unto himself he was not the second
[1:38:38] person nor the third person of the
[1:38:40] godhead he was the only person of the
[1:38:43] godhead made
[1:38:45] flesh ain't that right so then if if he
[1:38:48] was God made flesh then the authority
[1:38:51] that Jesus had was the same author
[1:38:53] Authority that God had the same
[1:38:55] Authority that was displayed to that old
[1:38:58] body was the same Authority that was
[1:39:01] displayed when God spoke in spirit form
[1:39:03] let there be light and there was
[1:39:08] light it was supreme authority in the
[1:39:12] body of Jesus God suffered like we
[1:39:14] suffer God
[1:39:17] aged God
[1:39:19] cried God hungered and
[1:39:21] thirsted God became weak at
[1:39:25] times ain't that right God in that body
[1:39:29] grew frail because the body grew Fair
[1:39:32] frail he was stoop shoulder the prophet
[1:39:35] said he just tired he was weary God grew
[1:39:42] grayhead can you say
[1:39:45] Amen but the authority of God did not
[1:39:48] change or
[1:39:51] diminish prise Lord when he become a
[1:39:54] human
[1:39:55] being and the Centurion we know
[1:39:59] recognized the kind of authority that
[1:40:02] Jesus had remember Matthew 88 he said to
[1:40:05] Jesus Lord I'm not worthy that thou
[1:40:07] should us come under my Ruth but speak
[1:40:09] the word what an authority speak the
[1:40:13] word don't don't come over there and and
[1:40:15] get your fist and knock somebody out
[1:40:17] just speak the word I'm looking for an
[1:40:20] authority that will cause sickness to
[1:40:22] leave my my
[1:40:25] servant can you say amen he said speak
[1:40:28] the word only and my servant shall be
[1:40:31] healed what an authority just speak
[1:40:34] speak the word don't whine about it
[1:40:38] don't cry about it don't beg over it
[1:40:42] speak it with
[1:40:44] authority in other words command it to
[1:40:46] leave and my servant shall be
[1:40:49] well ain't that right now the prophet
[1:40:53] said that this Centurion he knew that
[1:40:55] Jesus had all power all power over all
[1:40:59] sickness all diseases over death hell
[1:41:04] and he knew that all Jesus had to say
[1:41:07] was speak the word and that settled it
[1:41:11] now that's what that Centurion knew
[1:41:13] about the authority that Jesus had and
[1:41:16] the prophet said that every all the
[1:41:19] power and authority that Jesus had he's
[1:41:21] put in the church right
[1:41:24] praise the Lord
[1:41:26] glory
[1:41:28] amen now Jesus was willing to just go
[1:41:30] lay his hands on
[1:41:32] him and cause that fever to
[1:41:38] break but it was the Centurion that
[1:41:40] recognized there was a greater Authority
[1:41:42] than just laying
[1:41:44] hands we talk about the light you know
[1:41:46] brother Bram talked about when you know
[1:41:48] this I think it was Readers Digest when
[1:41:50] they you know they had that Minister you
[1:41:52] know they studying and the minister laid
[1:41:54] hands on that sick person and there was
[1:41:56] light that come out of them hands and to
[1:41:59] that to the
[1:42:01] patient brother Ram talks about it what
[1:42:05] what what an authority that we have just
[1:42:08] to lay hands on the sick and that is an
[1:42:10] authority you know but what a greater
[1:42:13] Authority all right to be able to speak
[1:42:17] amen Lord now surely you've seen that
[1:42:20] happen surely you've seen it in your
[1:42:23] life just just for an
[1:42:26] example when we were just kids me a mom
[1:42:30] was taking my grand her mom my
[1:42:32] grandmother she was an
[1:42:34] invalid back to
[1:42:36] Arkansas so Dad stayed
[1:42:40] home
[1:42:42] and it was raining I I remember it too
[1:42:46] and I was I was I don't know I might
[1:42:49] have been
[1:42:50] six but but
[1:42:53] we a car had stopped or pulled out in
[1:42:56] front of mom or done something and Mom
[1:42:58] slammed on the brakes and when she did
[1:43:00] we started spinning when she lost
[1:43:02] control and we went all the way down and
[1:43:05] was crossing or there there was a water
[1:43:09] I just remember that and we went all the
[1:43:12] way down in the bank and the back wheels
[1:43:15] ended in the
[1:43:17] water now what we didn't know is dad
[1:43:22] woke up and the Lord told him you pray
[1:43:25] or you'll never see your family
[1:43:28] again Dad rolled out of that bed and
[1:43:30] started pleading the blood over
[1:43:33] us hallelujah come home and realize it
[1:43:36] was the same time all right that that
[1:43:39] had happened the Lord speaking Dad
[1:43:42] wasn't there to lay hands on that car
[1:43:45] Dad wasn't there to lay hands on the
[1:43:47] family that wasn't there at the steering
[1:43:49] wheel to make sure that we were all safe
[1:43:53] but he began to speak a
[1:43:59] word can you say Amen you may not know
[1:44:02] where your daughter or son is that are
[1:44:04] out there in the world but just speak a
[1:44:07] word the word has more
[1:44:13] power can you say Amen it's an authority
[1:44:17] on now now the prophet said it
[1:44:19] astonished Jesus by what the Centurion
[1:44:21] said all right it astonished him cuz
[1:44:24] he's used to oh lay come lay remember
[1:44:26] your eyes come and lay your hands come
[1:44:29] come come and here's the Centurion
[1:44:31] recognized in a greater Authority than
[1:44:33] just laying
[1:44:34] hands speak it and it astonished Jesus
[1:44:39] see and the prophet said see just to
[1:44:41] know that his word it was a power of
[1:44:44] Testament his power of authority and
[1:44:46] Christian friend tonight his word is the
[1:44:49] power of authority that what he says it
[1:44:52] will be regardless of what you think or
[1:44:55] I think it's going to be just the same
[1:44:58] it's an
[1:45:00] authority good I hope this is all
[1:45:03] right now notice what kind of authority
[1:45:05] it was it was scriptural
[1:45:07] authority scriptual authority everybody
[1:45:10] say scriptural Authority see now now
[1:45:12] notice what how this works see the
[1:45:15] prophet said this word was spoke of God
[1:45:17] before the foundation of the world this
[1:45:20] word was spoke of God before the
[1:45:23] foundation of the world was ever laid
[1:45:26] and the only way it's written in a book
[1:45:28] is because that he revealed his word and
[1:45:31] plan to His prophets and apostles and
[1:45:33] they wrote it in the word now see Jesus
[1:45:38] was a predestinated seat of God how many
[1:45:40] believes that he was not he did not come
[1:45:43] into this world by accident he was
[1:45:45] pre-planned he was for ordained of God
[1:45:48] predestinated see a seat of God and the
[1:45:51] word is seat of God every word in this
[1:45:55] Bible is a seed of
[1:45:57] God and this word speaks of you it spoke
[1:46:00] of
[1:46:03] Jesus ain't that right the scriptures
[1:46:06] foretold of his life and what he was to
[1:46:09] do and what he would
[1:46:12] be ain't that right Prophet said the
[1:46:15] word spoke of him when he healed the
[1:46:17] sick when he raised the dead when the
[1:46:19] lame leap like in heart it was the word
[1:46:23] yes it was coming from the
[1:46:27] word it was scriptural
[1:46:29] Authority when he laid when he caused
[1:46:32] the blind to see it was coming from the
[1:46:34] word he was doing exactly what the word
[1:46:36] said he would
[1:46:38] do that's right
[1:46:41] right he was predestinated to be the
[1:46:44] prophet to be the lamb to be the
[1:46:47] king Lord to be the
[1:46:49] intercessor to be to be priest see the
[1:46:52] scriptures foretold of him they foretold
[1:46:56] that he would raise from the dead and he
[1:46:59] knew who he was he knew what his
[1:47:03] position was by
[1:47:07] scriptures his authority came from
[1:47:10] scripture yes sir that's right that's
[1:47:14] why he says there in John 5:39 search
[1:47:17] the scriptures for in them you think you
[1:47:18] have eternal life and they testify of me
[1:47:21] the very scriptures say you quote
[1:47:23] testify of me you claim to believe them
[1:47:26] but they
[1:47:30] testify see it was scriptural Authority
[1:47:33] so Jesus had scriptural
[1:47:35] authority to be the Messiah to be the
[1:47:38] Redeemer he had scriptural authority to
[1:47:41] do the works that he did to perform the
[1:47:44] sign that he did amen Psalms 40 and S
[1:47:48] then said I lo I come in the volume of
[1:47:50] the book it is written of me and I
[1:47:53] Delight to do thy will oh my God yay thy
[1:47:56] law is within my
[1:48:00] heart did you know John the Baptist had
[1:48:03] scriptural authority to be what he was
[1:48:04] and do what he
[1:48:06] did why he was the prophet he would had
[1:48:10] scriptural authority to be the prophet
[1:48:12] that forun the first coming of
[1:48:15] Christ no devil of Hell could could stop
[1:48:19] it he was standing there on scriptural
[1:48:21] Authority remember Matthew 3:1 in those
[1:48:24] days Came John the Baptist preaching in
[1:48:26] the wilderness of Judea and saying
[1:48:28] repent ye for the Kingdom of Heaven is
[1:48:30] at hand for this is he that was spoken
[1:48:33] of by the prophet Isaias Isaiah saying
[1:48:37] the voice of one crying in the
[1:48:38] wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[1:48:40] Lord make his path straight ain't that
[1:48:44] right John 1:19 and this is the record
[1:48:46] of John when the Jews sent priests and
[1:48:48] Levites from Jerusalem to ask him who
[1:48:51] art thou and he conf and denied not but
[1:48:54] confessed I am not the
[1:48:58] Christ he wasn't trying to be something
[1:49:01] he
[1:49:02] wasn't but what he did do and what he
[1:49:05] was he had the scriptural authority to
[1:49:08] be that and they asked him what then art
[1:49:11] thou Elias and he says I am not art thou
[1:49:13] the that Prophet see uh and he answered
[1:49:16] no then said they unto him who art thou
[1:49:19] that we may give an answer to them that
[1:49:20] sin us what sayest thou of thyself and
[1:49:23] he said kind quot from scripture I am
[1:49:26] the voice of one crying in the
[1:49:28] wilderness makes straight the way of the
[1:49:30] Lord as said the prophet isaas can you
[1:49:33] say Amen see so John the Baptist wasn't
[1:49:35] out on a limb and neither was Jesus out
[1:49:38] on the limb doing what they done it was
[1:49:41] all based upon the scriptures now notice
[1:49:44] the prophet said now John Jesus did
[1:49:47] recognize in John that John was a true
[1:49:50] Prophet the word had spoke of John and
[1:49:53] he knew that he was the absolutely the
[1:49:55] prophet of the hour and John knew that
[1:49:58] Jesus was the Messiah of the hour and
[1:50:01] they both clearly had an understanding
[1:50:05] can you say Amen so they made their
[1:50:08] confession based on the scriptures
[1:50:11] because they believed what the
[1:50:13] scriptures said about
[1:50:17] them Church we're not out on a limb amen
[1:50:20] when we say we're going to be in a
[1:50:21] Rapture that's that we're not being put
[1:50:23] out on a limb when we say we are Sons
[1:50:26] and Daughters of God that we're not out
[1:50:28] on a limb when we say that we're going
[1:50:30] to receive a body change we're not out
[1:50:32] on a limb it's everything based upon the
[1:50:35] scripture we have scriptural authority
[1:50:39] to be what we are to say what we are to
[1:50:41] believe what we
[1:50:43] believe hallelujah it's based upon
[1:50:46] scriptural
[1:50:47] Authority aren't you glad for that by
[1:50:51] scriptural authority Jesus over overcame
[1:50:53] the world he defeated death he defeated
[1:50:55] hell he defeated the grave he overcome
[1:50:58] every
[1:50:59] Temptation Hebrews 4:15 Paul said he was
[1:51:02] in all points tempted like as we are yet
[1:51:06] without sin he overcome sickness he
[1:51:10] overcome bitterness he overcome Lust by
[1:51:14] God's word he
[1:51:17] overcame brother briam said he overcome
[1:51:19] the personal Temptations of Satan by the
[1:51:21] word and by the word only
[1:51:25] yeah right another place he said he fa
[1:51:28] to the personal Temptation Of Satan by
[1:51:31] failing to use the word Adam fa in
[1:51:34] direct Disobedience to the word but
[1:51:37] Jesus overcame by the word don't
[1:51:39] disregard the word right for the word
[1:51:42] speaks of you it's your Authority
[1:51:48] am bless the name of the
[1:51:51] Lord I may not have that authority to
[1:51:54] tell you who's going to be
[1:51:56] president and I may not have the
[1:51:58] authority to put Trump or to put whoever
[1:52:00] candidate you want in in as
[1:52:03] president there's nothing in the
[1:52:05] scripture for that but I do have the
[1:52:08] authority to cast out Devils I do have
[1:52:11] the authority over every sin I do have
[1:52:14] that authority to triumph over every
[1:52:18] demon of hell because it's scriptural
[1:52:22] author
[1:52:26] Authority
[1:52:29] scripture now
[1:52:31] notice brother Braham speaking of Jesus
[1:52:34] said with all of his power with all of
[1:52:36] his signs and with everything he had in
[1:52:38] him he didn't use one of them to defeat
[1:52:40] Satan he took the father's word and
[1:52:42] defeated Satan right that's all you have
[1:52:45] to do just take God's word and defeat
[1:52:48] Satan with what he took the scriptures
[1:52:51] that prot to
[1:52:53] him and defeated every devil you can't
[1:52:57] tell me that as as he was coming up
[1:52:59] closer to death he knew he was going to
[1:53:02] die he knew what the scripture said and
[1:53:05] yet anxiety began to No Doubt fight him
[1:53:08] just like it fights us no doubt fear
[1:53:11] began to set in are you really the
[1:53:13] Messiah are you sure this is really
[1:53:15] going to work are you sure and then yet
[1:53:18] he would take the scriptures and say
[1:53:20] that it is written it is written it is
[1:53:23] written can you say amen he looked at
[1:53:25] him one time and said destroy this
[1:53:27] Temple and within 3 days I'll raise it
[1:53:29] up again he was speaking by faith but he
[1:53:32] had scriptural authority to speak like
[1:53:35] that for the scripture says destroy this
[1:53:38] body or or what was it I'll not suffer
[1:53:41] my Holy One or uh to see corruption or
[1:53:44] leave his soul in
[1:53:45] hell and Jesus knew that he would rise
[1:53:48] within 3 days because he knew that he
[1:53:51] that scripture was spoke of him
[1:53:55] him he had scriptural authority to talk
[1:53:57] like he did and you have scriptural
[1:54:00] authority to claim your
[1:54:01] children you have scriptural authority
[1:54:04] to speak yourself into a
[1:54:07] Rapture I don't care what he trying to
[1:54:09] defeat you you've got scripal authority
[1:54:11] to overcome that
[1:54:17] thing now notice Jesus had all the fine
[1:54:21] qualities of God in him do you believe
[1:54:22] it he had powers upon Powers but when he
[1:54:25] met Satan he never used his power he
[1:54:27] gave an example for the weakest of
[1:54:29] Christians when he met Satan he said it
[1:54:31] is written man shall not live by bread
[1:54:32] alone but by every word that proceeds
[1:54:34] out of the mouth of God and the weakest
[1:54:36] weakest Christian can take that stand
[1:54:39] hold it sure God's in his word every
[1:54:44] time everybody say every time every
[1:54:46] every time when he would meet the enemy
[1:54:48] he said it is written I believe he had
[1:54:50] power to do it but he met Satan on the
[1:54:52] same grounds with the same word that you
[1:54:55] can meet him with every one of us it's
[1:54:59] written it's written I might not be The
[1:55:02] Brightest Bulb in the socket but I do
[1:55:05] have the power and authority to tell the
[1:55:07] devil it's written it's written I may
[1:55:11] not know all the words of this Bible and
[1:55:13] they I might not know all the Greek
[1:55:15] understandings of it but I know there's
[1:55:17] one thing I can say it is
[1:55:21] written and I have that same
[1:55:24] authority to put the devil in his
[1:55:27] place Amen
[1:55:31] Hallelujah Jesus showed us that the
[1:55:34] authority lays in the word of
[1:55:37] God can you say amen amen now notice and
[1:55:41] I'm going to try to close but he said
[1:55:43] the Bible is manifested again like in
[1:55:45] the early days of Christ because
[1:55:48] everybody say
[1:55:50] because you are a pre destinated seed
[1:55:53] just like Christ
[1:55:55] was you can't be part of this church
[1:55:58] part of the bride and the word not speak
[1:56:00] of you that's
[1:56:04] right Jesus could not be Messiah he knew
[1:56:07] he couldn't be Messiah and not one
[1:56:09] scripture of the Messiah that spoke of
[1:56:11] the Messiah not pertained to him he knew
[1:56:14] every scripture that pertained to the
[1:56:15] Messiah spoke of him for he believed he
[1:56:17] was that Messiah and he proved he was
[1:56:20] the Messiah
[1:56:22] and so is it for you if your bride if
[1:56:25] you're part of this thing then every
[1:56:27] scripture that speaks of this bride
[1:56:29] pertains to
[1:56:34] you now you're predestinated see John
[1:56:37] 15:16 if you have not chosen me Jesus
[1:56:40] said but I have chosen you and ordained
[1:56:42] you that you should go and bring forth
[1:56:45] fruit and that your fruit should remain
[1:56:46] that whatsoever you shall ask of the
[1:56:48] father in my name he may give it to you
[1:56:50] ain't that right so this shows that
[1:56:51] you're a word seed that word seed is
[1:56:55] down in the
[1:56:58] soul amen flesh might act up flesh might
[1:57:02] be contrary but the seed is in the
[1:57:07] soul Hallelujah 1 Peter 2:9 but you are
[1:57:11] a chosen
[1:57:12] generation chosen generation a ro
[1:57:16] priesthood a holy nation see a peculiar
[1:57:19] people maybe your flesh ain't telling
[1:57:22] you that but the Bible the word is
[1:57:25] speaking of you you're a predestinated
[1:57:27] seed amen that you should show forth the
[1:57:31] Praises of him who have called you out
[1:57:32] of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light
[1:57:34] which in time past were not a people but
[1:57:36] now are the people of God which had not
[1:57:39] obtained Mercy but now have obtained
[1:57:41] Mercy ain't that right now notice what a
[1:57:44] prophet said back in the beginning when
[1:57:45] God looked down and seen what was going
[1:57:47] to happen he spoke of the slain lamb and
[1:57:50] God's word is always conf confirmed in
[1:57:52] heaven and the lamb was slain right
[1:57:55] there before the foundation of the world
[1:57:57] according to God's word is that right
[1:57:58] but it never happened until 4,000 years
[1:58:01] see but it was a finished work back
[1:58:04] there because God confirmed it in the
[1:58:07] heavens just like you was always
[1:58:11] saved God confirmed it in the heavens
[1:58:15] before he ever become a reality here on
[1:58:18] the Earth
[1:58:23] and you're he's already glorified you in
[1:58:26] that it's already
[1:58:28] confirmed it's a dumb deal it's a
[1:58:31] finished
[1:58:36] work that word it's a scriptural
[1:58:39] Authority amen ain't that right so see
[1:58:45] he said and the Bible said that you in
[1:58:47] his church tonight that's born again he
[1:58:50] said how it's nice for the poet to say
[1:58:51] that a new name that's written down in
[1:58:53] glory tonight but the Bible said that
[1:58:55] everyone that was saved their names were
[1:58:58] put on the Lambs of the book of life
[1:58:59] before the foundation of the world when
[1:59:01] the lamb was slain you was associated
[1:59:03] with it then what are you going to do
[1:59:04] about it all that comes to me no man can
[1:59:07] come to me ex come except my father
[1:59:09] draws him so there's the elected from
[1:59:11] the beginning now as we wrap this up
[1:59:15] you've got to overcome too amen I got to
[1:59:18] overcome
[1:59:20] too amen can you say amen and we've been
[1:59:24] given that authority to
[1:59:25] overcome not overcoming In the
[1:59:28] Flesh for our flesh is weak our flesh is
[1:59:32] powerless to overcome the world but the
[1:59:36] authority lays in the gene seed of God
[1:59:39] that word seed amen that God put in us
[1:59:42] before the foundation of the world ain't
[1:59:45] that right now you can have the
[1:59:47] Bible you can read this Bible you can
[1:59:51] read it backward and for forward you can
[1:59:53] you you you you can read it 10 times
[1:59:55] through every year you can know it
[1:59:58] backward and forward but it'll do you no
[2:00:00] good unless there's that genan seed word
[2:00:03] seed down in your
[2:00:07] heart can you say Amen Prophet said you
[2:00:10] can mimic any of these things you can
[2:00:12] contact like like a Christian or you
[2:00:15] could cast out devils like a Christian
[2:00:17] but the inside control tower the
[2:00:19] beginning the origin isn't of God it'll
[2:00:21] never return turn to God Amen you
[2:00:23] understand it see did not Judas cast out
[2:00:25] Devils did not C caus uh the one who
[2:00:28] condemned Jesus put him to death even
[2:00:30] prophesy but he could not stay with the
[2:00:33] word amen can you say Amen so now you're
[2:00:37] transformed this is again where you're
[2:00:40] being transformed the prophet said from
[2:00:42] the church and the world into being Sons
[2:00:46] and Daughters of
[2:00:49] God not prophesying speak tongues
[2:00:52] running all over the place and remaining
[2:00:53] the same still with them same old
[2:00:56] desires there is an authority that's
[2:00:58] been given to
[2:01:01] you scriptural
[2:01:03] Authority can you say Amen but then the
[2:01:07] word seed has to be
[2:01:11] quickened yes by the spirit so Romans
[2:01:15] 8:11 but if the spirit of him that
[2:01:17] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[2:01:18] you he that raised up Christ from the
[2:01:20] dead shall also Quicken your mortal
[2:01:22] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in
[2:01:24] you now notice what a prophet says when
[2:01:28] this body receives the spirit of God The
[2:01:30] Immortal Life inside of you it throws
[2:01:33] this body in subjection to God he that's
[2:01:38] born of God does not commit sin he
[2:01:41] cannot
[2:01:42] sin you've got your faults and your
[2:01:45] failures and all that that ain't even
[2:01:46] imputed unto
[2:01:50] you did the scriptures say blessed is
[2:01:53] the man whom the Lord does not impute
[2:02:00] sin see he cannot sin Romans 8:1 there
[2:02:05] is therefore now no condemnation to them
[2:02:07] that are in Christ Jesus they walk not
[2:02:09] after the flesh but after the spirit
[2:02:10] there you are see that throws your body
[2:02:15] subject you don't have to say oh if I
[2:02:17] could just quit
[2:02:19] drinking if I could just he said just
[2:02:21] get in Christ and it's all gone because
[2:02:24] your body is subject to the spirit it's
[2:02:27] no more subject to the things of the
[2:02:28] world they're dead they are dead your
[2:02:32] sins are buried in baptism and you are a
[2:02:35] new creation in Christ and your body
[2:02:38] becoming subject to the spirit he said
[2:02:40] try to live a right kind of life he said
[2:02:43] like you women claiming you got the Holy
[2:02:45] Ghost and going out in here and wearing
[2:02:46] shorts and things how could you do it
[2:02:48] how could the spirit of God in you ever
[2:02:50] let you do such a thing as that it can't
[2:02:51] can't just be so certainly it can't be
[2:02:54] he's not a filthy Spirit he's a Holy
[2:02:56] Spirit and then when you become subject
[2:02:58] to that Spirit it throws your whole
[2:03:00] being subject to that spirit and that
[2:03:03] spirit is nothing in this world but this
[2:03:05] seed word made manifest or quickened
[2:03:09] made alive and when the Bible said don't
[2:03:11] do this that body quickly turns to it
[2:03:13] there's no
[2:03:15] question there's there's no arguing with
[2:03:18] God there there's no ounds of unbelief
[2:03:21] there
[2:03:25] can you say amen he says and what is it
[2:03:28] it's the earnest of the Resurrection
[2:03:30] this body will be raised up again
[2:03:32] because it's already
[2:03:33] started see it's already started why
[2:03:36] because it's turned you there's there's
[2:03:38] that control tower God now has quickened
[2:03:41] that word seed he's living in there and
[2:03:44] everything your flesh may not be there
[2:03:46] your flesh May testify it may be crying
[2:03:49] out and and Waring against you but that
[2:03:52] word seed is Quicken and it's
[2:03:56] dominating
[2:03:58] dominating amen can you say amen that's
[2:04:02] right praise the Lord that's good your
[2:04:04] flesh might tell you you've crossed the
[2:04:06] line there's no more Mercy but there's
[2:04:07] something down inside of you says I'm
[2:04:10] still a Son of God it
[2:04:14] dominates you're too sick to worship
[2:04:16] you're too sick to praise God you're too
[2:04:18] sick you
[2:04:19] know and all that's doubt maybe start
[2:04:22] trying to come into but that word seed
[2:04:24] begins to well up God is faithful God is
[2:04:29] true God will come through this thing he
[2:04:32] will never leave me nor forsake me I've
[2:04:34] got the scriptural
[2:04:36] Authority can you say Amen what is it it
[2:04:40] begins to put this body under subjection
[2:04:42] it silence that voice that carnal Spirit
[2:04:45] it silences that
[2:04:49] thing amen you love him
[2:04:52] amen he said what is it it's the earnest
[2:04:54] of the Resurrection this body will be
[2:04:56] raised up again it's already started it
[2:04:58] was once subject to sin and mire and
[2:05:00] Corruption but now it's got the earnest
[2:05:02] it's turned Heavenly and see now that's
[2:05:04] the earnest that you're going in the
[2:05:06] Rapture it's the earnest a sick person
[2:05:08] laying dying nothing left but death
[2:05:10] that's all can happen see I've seen sh
[2:05:13] Shadows of people done eat up with
[2:05:15] cancer tuberculosis see them persons a
[2:05:18] little while after that perfectly normal
[2:05:20] and strong there if if there is no
[2:05:23] Divine Healing then there is no
[2:05:25] Resurrection because Divine Healing is
[2:05:26] the earnest of the Resurrection you know
[2:05:29] what the earnest money is don't you he
[2:05:31] said it's the down payment he was
[2:05:32] wounded for our transgressions with his
[2:05:34] Tripes were healed notice how wonderful
[2:05:36] we love him now this body is subject to
[2:05:39] the spirit it's not yet entered into the
[2:05:41] word form but we are still in the flesh
[2:05:44] form but now we're subject to the word
[2:05:48] subject to the word can you say Amen oh
[2:05:51] do you love him can you lift your hands
[2:05:52] unto the Lord I love
[2:05:55] him I love him hallelujah
[2:05:58] hallelujah if the musicians will
[2:06:02] come
[2:06:04] amen he said see the outside body has
[2:06:07] five inlets to it the contact your
[2:06:09] Earthly home see taste feel smell and
[2:06:12] hear the inside which is a spirit it has
[2:06:15] five senses conscience love and so forth
[2:06:17] but the inside of that the soul has one
[2:06:19] thing and that's what faith or doubt
[2:06:21] right right it's what he said one gate
[2:06:23] it's either Faith or doubt and he says
[2:06:26] that's where you live right you live
[2:06:30] amen he said the spirit can come out
[2:06:32] here and anoint you to do certain things
[2:06:34] and you do it but that don't mean you're
[2:06:35] saved think of it kef is prophesied
[2:06:38] Judas cast out Devils the spirit
[2:06:39] anointed him see the rain falls on the
[2:06:42] just and the unjust the Wheats can
[2:06:44] Rejoice with the wheat but it's what it
[2:06:46] is at the core see that's where our
[2:06:48] Authority lies is down down at the core
[2:06:52] see so the uh uh he said there's where
[2:06:55] you are in intellectuals can can accept
[2:06:58] it and say oh sure that looks good I
[2:07:00] believe that that still don't do it see
[2:07:02] no sir and the spirit can actually make
[2:07:04] witness of it and still it isn't so
[2:07:07] because if that Soul hasn't come from
[2:07:09] God it can make all the impersonations
[2:07:11] out here see the flesh the spirit see
[2:07:14] but it cannot be real you can act
[2:07:16] healing you can act like you have you
[2:07:19] can act like you receive it Christians
[2:07:21] can act like they're Christians and and
[2:07:23] act and be ever so good at it but that
[2:07:25] don't mean they're saved that's exactly
[2:07:27] right the spirit can be there the real
[2:07:29] genuine Spirit the Holy Spirit can
[2:07:31] anoint you that still don't mean you're
[2:07:33] saved it's that inside Soul That Never
[2:07:36] Dies it's got eternal life it always was
[2:07:38] eternal life see it come from God it
[2:07:41] goes to God it's the soul he said I
[2:07:44] notice it's got to be five uh faith f AI
[2:07:48] t h the outside Spirit Js us on the
[2:07:52] inside you see that's how standing here
[2:07:55] looking at you I don't know one of you
[2:07:58] see uh a one of you the spirit can
[2:08:01] anoint me still I don't know none of you
[2:08:03] but when that inside of the inside
[2:08:05] breaks in that's God see that's where
[2:08:08] the outside can reason you can take a
[2:08:10] man and say well now I know I'm not
[2:08:13] supposed to make commit adultery but you
[2:08:15] know then the spirit tells me that I
[2:08:17] shouldn't commit adultery but will you
[2:08:19] see way down in there steal that thing
[2:08:21] in there it'll kind of govern around and
[2:08:24] better watch it see but when it's
[2:08:26] directed from the inside it throws all
[2:08:29] the rest of it together that's the
[2:08:31] guidepost that's the control tower the
[2:08:33] inside of the inside the soul controls
[2:08:35] the spirit the spirit controls the body
[2:08:38] ain't that right see and that's where
[2:08:40] we're coming to we're coming centered
[2:08:42] upon the word not emotions not feelings
[2:08:45] it's not how we feel you you you may
[2:08:48] wake up not feeling saved you feel back
[2:08:51] slid feeling like you ain't got Victory
[2:08:54] feeling defeated feeling everything but
[2:08:56] what down in that soul is what counts
[2:08:59] because in there the word begins to say
[2:09:01] but you're not defeated but you are
[2:09:04] victorious but you are saved but you are
[2:09:08] going to make it can you say amen and
[2:09:10] then there you don't live by your
[2:09:12] feelings you don't act by your feelings
[2:09:14] you don't you don't talk by your feeling
[2:09:16] you talk by what the word is saying oh I
[2:09:19] may not feel it but I feel I know I'm
[2:09:22] saved I know that's different but it's
[2:09:24] true then you start reigning you start
[2:09:27] ruling by the word not by your feeling
[2:09:30] not your feelings ruling you you're
[2:09:32] ruling your feelings you're ruling your
[2:09:34] emotion you're ruling everything by the
[2:09:36] word that's in
[2:09:37] [Music]
[2:09:39] you amen can you say
[2:09:43] amen I love the Lord there's so many
[2:09:47] things that brother Bram talks about but
[2:09:49] throwing
[2:09:52] throwing our body and I'm going to read
[2:09:54] this one more I know I've kept you he
[2:09:57] said you are an out outward man which is
[2:09:59] controlled by five senses you are an
[2:10:01] inward man controlled by uh one sense
[2:10:03] which is Faith this Faith disagrees with
[2:10:05] all five senses if the and which he says
[2:10:07] six senses but we know he taught there's
[2:10:09] five senses he said with all five senses
[2:10:12] if the five senses doesn't agree with
[2:10:14] faith see this Faith disagrees with all
[2:10:16] five senses if the five senses doesn't
[2:10:18] agree with faith but one is contrary to
[2:10:21] to the other as long as the five senses
[2:10:23] agree with the faith wonderful but when
[2:10:26] the five senses disagree with faith then
[2:10:27] leave the five senses
[2:10:29] alone leave your emotions alone leave
[2:10:32] what you feel alone leave what it's your
[2:10:34] flesh is telling you leave it alone and
[2:10:37] go by
[2:10:38] faith you said now for instance Jesus
[2:10:40] made a statement a promise the inside
[2:10:42] man says that's true amen the outside
[2:10:44] man reason says that can't be true to
[2:10:46] you then ignore the outside man and
[2:10:48] accept the Inside Man see that's the
[2:10:51] same thing Paul is speaking of you see
[2:10:53] he was slded under the law uh uh to
[2:10:56] carnal sin every one of us is the same
[2:10:58] that's the reason we have the troubles
[2:11:00] that we do married four or five times
[2:11:02] and this and that and all kinds of sin
[2:11:04] adulteries everything else along in our
[2:11:05] lives is because of those things we are
[2:11:07] carnal that part must perish but the
[2:11:09] inside we are a spirit Man soul inside
[2:11:13] see and that's faith in God's word then
[2:11:16] we bring our outside body under
[2:11:19] subjection to the word by Faith
[2:11:21] everybody say by Faith by accepting what
[2:11:26] God says we could go on and
[2:11:29] on you bring it into subjection by Faith
[2:11:33] by accepting what God says don't believe
[2:11:35] in
[2:11:36] [Music]
[2:11:38] yourself yourself will let you
[2:11:42] down everything else is going to let you
[2:11:45] down everything else is Shifting Sands
[2:11:48] there's one thing that you have the
[2:11:49] authority with and that's that's by
[2:11:51] God's word and you take God's word by
[2:11:55] faith and accept it and then it becomes
[2:11:58] an authority to you you can speak to
[2:12:02] your feelings you can speak to every
[2:12:05] situation and say I know it's real I
[2:12:08] know it's true Satan give it up it's
[2:12:11] time to leave can you say amen I know
[2:12:15] fear will come upon you don't accept
[2:12:19] that say I refuse to accept fear complx
[2:12:22] has come upon you I refuse to do I I
[2:12:24] just refuse to that I'm going to take
[2:12:26] God's word but you got this you got that
[2:12:29] you got that it doesn't matter I'm going
[2:12:30] to take God at his word I've got that
[2:12:33] authority to do so scriptural
[2:12:37] Authority
