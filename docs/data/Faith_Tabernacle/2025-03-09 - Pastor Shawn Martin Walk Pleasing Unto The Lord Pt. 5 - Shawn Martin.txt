we just had a wonderful time and he hadn't really been speaking much but while we were singing and while we were exhorting while we begin to sing he actually begin to begin to sing with us he's

appreciates your prayers and all these other people do as well God is good he's answered a lot of prayers so let's remember these requests today as we look to the Lord in prayer our Heavenly Father God we've seen you answer prayer all week Lord we've seen you answer prayer Lord time and time again Lord there's so many records there's so many places testimonies where you have done exactly what

we want to uh remember that amen if you have your Bibles we're going to turn uh first of all to first Thessalonians thank you uh musicians amen and um appreciate all the the songs this morning the specials and the worship and uh the music amen and want to just thank all you brothers that are uh able to come out like yesterday and help us uh clean the U around the church I it looks it looks really good and um uh so uh we really appreciate uh your help and uh got in there and got it done and and U looks nice praise the Lord I have to say so myself amen but um so 1 Thessalonians the uh 4th chapter and um going to start the first verse and uh further more when uh then we beseech you Brethren uh and exort You by the Lord Jesus that as you have received of us how you ought to walk walk and to please God so ye would abound more and more for you know what Commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus uh for this is the will of God even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor then if you'll go Ephesians the 5th chapter amen and and um we'll start at the just read the first two verses Ephesians chapter 5 says be therefore followers of God as dear children and walk in love as Christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling Savor amen may we just bow our heads in a word of prayer father it's just good to be able to have an understanding that you are God when the world is denying you denying the power of godliness Lord you have revealed yourself to us and we're believing in you Lord Lord and no matter what we go through no matter the trials and circumstances we're at rest knowing that you're God and that there's nothing Lord that can Dethrone you there's nothing that could hinder you and father therefore we know that we will make it we're we're Victorious and now we just ask Lord that you would come Among Us this morning and that you would um just speak to every heart here father you see the subject that we would have what's on our heart Lord and pray that you would help me just to convey that and Lord that it would be planted in our hearts that we could leave this place more like you we ask it father pray that you would forgive us of all of our sins our failures Lord and we just humbly now just yield ourselves to you in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated this morning and um we had a uh a good time in in Arizona and appreciate your prayers and uh uh believing the the people were helped and and edified and and so uh we that's that's our heart's desire is to help Help the People wherever we go amen and um so here I'm going to use the title again walk walk pleasing unto him and um it just going to be a simple subject and um uh but it's something that is on my heart so I I pray that it'll be a blessing to you in in some way uh but um we uh you know uh I I think and and of course I think the Bible would back it up the message but I think the way we we live should be pleasing unto God I I think the way we talk should be pleasing unto God I I think the way we uh think and allow what we meditate upon it should be pleasing unto our Lord uh what we listen to uh should be pleasing unto the Lord I I think we shouldn't just listen to anything um um but uh and and when I say that it it could be in music it could be in in just uh any kind of preaching it it it could be gossip it could just it could be anything could be just jokes uh you know someone telling a joke and if it's a dirty joke or unclean we shouldn't listen to that but but everything that we should do uh do we should walk pleasing unto the Lord our marriage should be pleasing unto the Lord uh what we do on the job it should be pleasing unto the Lord um but but also every one of us have a Ministry um whe whe whether you believe that or not and and it's sometimes it's hard to really believe and fathom that we've got a Ministry and a lot of times Satan is good at uh at building complexes and um um hang on just a moment I'm wired up and got stuck praise the Lord amen but uh every one of us uh uh we have a Ministry and I think it like brother brandom said we should all uh it pays us to go uh to the Lord and and uh ask him what he would want us to do and um um and it may be something very small it may seem something insignificant and maybe maybe Satan is good at at putting that as insignificant to us as though we're really nothing and it's really nothing special but you have a Ministry and the prophet said no one can take your place so then we we should in our ministry we should be pleasing our ministry should be pleasing unto the Lord and um and so I I believe that as we mature in the Lord then our ministry matures uh as well and we know uh that this is the age of maturing this is the time for the manifestation of sons of God and that couldn't happen when we were children it couldn't happen when in in the other ages uh but in order for the maturity to take place the Pentecostal shuck had to pull away it it had to pull away as you know brother brandham speaks of that in uh the seed shall not be air with the shuck and and other places of course but but it had to pull away uh before maturity could come and and I believe it has pulled away that's where we're at I believe it has pulled away and that's why we're seeing a lot of people walk away from the message um is is because it's it's just drying up uh the shuck uh and and Pentecostal thought Pentecostal thinking U traditions and and doctrines and ways and all these things that were man-made all these things are just pulling away and drying up I believe we're at the place that we are maturing by laying in the Pres presence of the Sun and this is where we're at uh this is why there's nothing that appeals to us outside the message of the hour this is why the message is so dear to us and and and we we we would rather listen to a me the message than we would you know Dr doson or uh we would rather get answers from the message than we would a psychologist or uh some some denominational uh thing is because we're we're we're ripening the message is helping us to ripen and and we're we're taking we're we're we're we're building our lives by it we're we're molding our marriages after it we're molding our homes our families our churches everything after uh uh the message of the hour and and so and and by that our our behavior is maturing our thinking is mat maturing our faith is maturing our attitude is maturing our understanding of the word is maturing amen we're not standing in in a mass confusion like we used to uh because we have answers and and the prophet would tell us we have the answer to the devil's question amen but but we're maturing in these things and and the character of Christ is fully full developing uh within us as Believers I you know I I I pray that everyone here this morning has a desire to walk pleasing unto the Lord uh uh Christians every true Christian desires to please him I mean uh uh that's that's do uh it's in other words it's not you know as i' I've said before it's not like you know uh the the the carrot before the horse you know and and horse or donkey or whatever he's chasing that carrot all day long and they got that carrot to get him to moveing you know uh uh but but this is something that we can acquire we're it's not the promises before us and we're not able to obtain but this is something as Believers we're able to OB Ain uh maybe you know years ago we thought that it may not be it wasn't possible but we're looking at it and we're understanding that it is possible it is it is possible to please the Lord through maturing amen uh through maturity and so only only a Christian can walk pleasing unto the Lord only a Christian a true genuine Christian can walk pleasing amen to to try to please the Lord without being a Christian would be impossible to do uh when we think of Christian the life of a Christian and and you just bear with me but the life of a Christian is a is a direct result of the work of redemption uh so it's not something that okay I'm I'm going to be a Christian so I'm going to go to church or I'm going to be a Christian so I'm going to start living holy and and a Holiness life and or I'm going to be a Christian whatever but the life of a Christian is a direct result of the work of redemption so you don't become a Christian simply by Good Will or by joining a church or uh uh you know and and therefore we understand that uh if you're not in God's thinking you you can't be a Christian um and that's just the way it is um you you had to be in God's thinking brother brandom said a Christian is God's thoughts of today that he had before the foundation of the world so you didn't just start being a Christian by desires you was a Christian by God's Desire by what God saw of you before the foundation of the world your beginning as a Christian started in the mind of God not at an altar amen it it it started as the thoughts of God and so uh a a Christian is an attribute of God's thinking expressed in this day for this day that's what a Christian is now we were all born as the prophet would say with a fallen nature a fallen character he says our character was a dying character see but in in God but God in love he says projected a character without sin he projected one without sin and and another place he says God's great nature projected Jesus Christ ain't that right amen his great nature projected Jesus Christ another place he said he was so perfect with the father uh Christ he was so perfect with the father just a body that was here called the son that the word was him so so God was able to project a character that was a sinless nature he was able to project a person here we are uh born in sin shap it in iniquity no hope we were dying and we were as as you know the boy that had a bunch of birds you know um uh you know in a cage or some birds that a cage and someone asked you know a man asked him what are you going to do with them Birds I'm just going to play with them you know and and and he said well well you know you're going to play with them yeah yeah and he said yeah I was able to uh uh snare them and and I'm just going to play with him then what are you going to do with them I'm going to kill them you know and and uh uh and so that was the intent you know and I thought well that's that's a lot of how we were you know is is we were snared by the the devil and and and all he wanted to do is just use us and abuse us and he didn't see value in our life and and his intent was to destroy us but Jesus come one day and and said I I'll I'll I'll pay a price for him and and he saw the value in it and you know Satan oh you ain't going to want them oh yeah I do want them and and I don't want you to give them to me I'm going to pay for him and and so this was the love of God that would take uh uh be able to to produce a character that would take us from being a sinner to a saint that would take us from being in in a trapped in a cage to letting us be free can you say amen and so this was this was Christ um 1 John 3:8 we've read it before but just breaking in here it says for this purpose the Son of God was manifested what was the purpose of Christ being manifested ested to destroy the works of the devil can you say Amen can you say that with me to destroy the works of the devil that was the purpose of Jesus Christ being made manifest it was the purpose of his ministry was to destroy the works of the devil it's just like the the the the creeper that brother Braham talks about you know the man uh uh he plants his garden and if he doesn't take care of the garden a creeper will will grow in there and and and he will that that creeper will wrap itself around that corn that stock of corn and and and it will actually begin to pull that stock of corn uh you know instead of it being straight like it should be it'll start perverting it and and pulling it down and deforming it see and so in in order to to release that stock of corn to bring it back up that that farmer has to go in there with a a tool a a hole and and and break the power of that creeper and get it out of that garden and and so that the that that the the stock of corn can can come back up and be what it's meant to be ain't that right so this is Jesus he came to destroy the works of of the devil that creeper that had entwined itself around your life and so he wasn't here just to mingle with people he he wasn't here just uh to receive accolades from people and ooh and awe and and and all of these things he wasn't here just to preach and and to sing and to you know have healing campaigns and all this he was sent to destroy the works of the devil can you say amen and you wouldn't be here today I wouldn't be here today if that was if that wasn't the case amen we can truly say that the works of the devil has been destroyed in our lives and we know that we we've experienc that we can truly say he's nothing but a bluff how many believes that he's nothing but a bluff amen that's right and and so uh um uh he was sent to this destroy the works of the devil and yet this could not be done without Divine love amen uh uh the prophet said love is the greatest force uh another place he said love is the greatest weapon that God ever put into the hands of man amen and and you know what good is is is a Ministry without love what good is is is a gift without love what what good is our testifying amen what what good does it do without love and so uh you know and and I hope I ain't too scattered this morning but hopefully I can relay what I I feel uh but brother brandom says if I had the choice tonight and was a sinner and was standing here before God and and he said you know now boy I I'm going to give you all nine spiritual gifts I'm going to let you prophesy give you the spirit of Prophecy I'm going to make make you a mighty preacher give you the word of wisdom and understanding I'm going to give you the gift to speak in tongues and to interpret I'm going to give you a gift of healing that you'll have great faith for the sick I'm going to do all these things for you I'll give you all of that uh or I won't let you have any of those things but let you have real love in your heart he says I'd say God give me love ain't that right you see it was love that brother Brown said it love is what drove the heart of God to send Christ to the Earth ain't that right so the ministry that Jesus was given and and and everything that he he he was able to do it it was all inspired by love amen God so loved ain't that right and so there's nothing more powerful than than love I I I thought brother brandham here tell talking about a a man that had come to him that was was a Pentecostal brother and U he says he had seen too many of of these meetings and he goes in and his wife is a staunch Lutheran and she said well I guess you all went down and shouted last night and guess you all you know you was all speaking in tongues and doing all this last night and he got out on the floor and he said God I cast The Devil out of her you know now he casting the devil out of his wife see and and and he said um uh I cast The Devil out of her almost a divorce case you know and and he says a fine man and he come to me and he said brother brandom we're going to have a divorce I guess and I said you know he said I just can't get that devil to move out of her I said brother you're going at it the wrong way I said you know when she starts uh like that just say all right dear bless your heart honey and be real kind to her see just see how much you can do for her he said well brother Brandon well how will I ever get the devil out of her and I said you do as I say and just keep praying in your heart see and I said God will take care of the rest of it he called me up about two weeks two or three weeks later and he said my home's revolutionized and he said my wife's a different person and I said well which is the most powerful screaming and kicking and stomping or just putting your arms around in love see so Jesus was sent to destroy the works of the devil but his ministry would have done no good if it had not love it it wouldn't have helped to to be to to to testify of the father it without love it it wouldn't have done no good all the healing campaigns and everything that he' done well see we are sent for the same purpose how many believes that and I I get it that that yeah they they cre crucified him and and and and he he he you know he he didn't get everybody but he was after that elect amen he he was after that elect but there was such love for human Humanity do you believe that so we're we're sent for the same purpose so so for you ministers all of us as ministers our preaching isn't to make more room for for the devil to work in the lives of people our our our ministry uh uh you know uh our life isn't as for all of us our life isn't to be lived in a way that would allow the devil to bring more confusion to people um you know sometimes you hear people talking of the Lord and and then you you you know at least I used to uh I think well you know I you know you see the boxers beating one another and blood running out of their ears and nose and all that and then the winter afterwards say I just want to say I thank the Lord God Bless America you know and you're thinking well how how does that work you know and or you hear country singers talking about you know tears in my beer and and all of these things and and but but they're Christians you know and it used to you know you think well how in the world did that work and or I'd see in church and and a lot of hypocrisy and things and you think well well how does that but but then you come into the message and you understand that there's an anointing that falls on the just the unjust and and and the anointing doesn't change what seed it is it just it grows they they both mature under the under the rain ain't that right but the rain doesn't change the uh the weed to the wheat it just helps it grow and and so we we understand those things now and and but yet as as Christians our life isn't to be like that our life isn't to be lived amen that would allow the the devil to bring more confusion and and and the same way with the preaching it it isn't to to bring more down you know to drive the people away from God and the realities of God and and all of these things and and that happens a a lot see we're not to bring a reproach uh to the gospel to where it causes people not to want to accept Christ if if we're on the job or if we're at the store or or if we're wherever we're at at school or whatever Our Lives um um as as as walking pleasing to God we we we want our lives that when people look at us whether they're ridiculing us or laughing and mocking us or uh not saying much to us we want such a life before them that that they know that there's something different about that individual you know that that it draws them to to want to be what to have what we have and and and to become you know what we are and and and and uh you understand I'm sure so the Bible says that God so loved the world God so loved the world now you know and and we talk that world the bride is going to be made up out of every nation tongue Kindred and people God so loved ain't that right that he gave his only begotten son for the purpose of not just preaching the gospel not just not just singing not just uh living a good life but sent his son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but shall have eternal life so God so loved the world that he did not want mankind to perish sh you believe that he so loved the world therefore he produced something so that the people would not perish he didn't just produce a good Ministry he didn't just send his son with a good talent to play my music or to to with a good personality that would draw people uh uh uh to him and there's been many good men uh before him and after him that have great personalities and men that that have that ability to speak and and and draw thousands of people that can be a political uh uh uh uh speaker as as we know the the mega movement would just you use that for an example how he's able to draw thousands to a crowd but that's not what God sent God God didn't send a man that just had ability to speak and through his speech he could draw people he sent his son that men may live eternally he that was the love that God had to the world that he wouldn't just send them a great speech maker he wouldn't just send them uh some some uh healer or or some businessman or or he sent him that the world would not perish and he and and the the son was sent because God so loved can you say amen and and and so uh uh his love uh uh produced Jesus Christ you know and and uh uh Christ is the only thing I've said it last time that we spoke here uh that that Christ is the only thing that Divine love will ever produce amen When Love is projected it produces Jesus Christ again amen it it it doesn't produce a a magician it it didn't produce a miracle worker in in in a sense of what we would call uh people call these things uh it didn't send and make a pope or a bishop he produced Jesus Christ the word made flesh a savior a redeemer someone that was able to help man and destroy the works of the devil it it did not produce a denomination or a scholar it did not produce a a a psychologist and and and and if it didn't produce psychology back then it won't do it today amen it it just won't it will only produce the person of Jesus Christ and he is the word made flesh do you believe that that's the Divine love that's true divine love true love that's what it'll produce is the person of Jesus Christ and and so God saw what Satan had done to his children and because he loved them he sought to rescue them he sought to redeem them he sought to purchase them and loose them from Satan's grip and and so the Bible says that God spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all amen and and and we know how he sent his son right he sent his son the prophet said by going with him and being in him that's how God sent his son amen is is that God would be identified with man God would know how man felt he he would feel the feelings of man amen when someone was lonely he would know what it felt amen he couldn't do it as a spirit but he could do it coming into his son becoming human when someone was hungry and and beggarly and weak he would know how that felt he would know how you teenagers feel when you're confused and and you're going through the life and you're between uh uh uh uh uh the world of childhood and the world of adulthood and and and these things and and you don't know what to do and the pure pressure is there he would know how you felt God so loved the ministry was more than just his ministry was more than just healing sick and his his ministry was feeling the people going through what they they went through going through the Temptations and overcoming them and so the Bible says that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself so he wasn't bringing them to a church per se or some group he was bringing them to himself God was hid in the body of Jesus Christ you believe that and so that that shows that a a Christian Life cannot be lived without God living in the individual it was God in Christ it was God in Christ can you say man how how can it it this way how could we want the world re to be reconciled to God without God living in us we would have no desire for the world or for a burden for the world a love for people we we wouldn't we would be so consumed with our s our business and and our life and and our desires and our wants and our cravings and and and everything but Jesus he he forfeited all that because God was in him reconciling the world to himself amen so brother randam said Jesus came to break the clouds back so that attribute could display itself see so you were bound you were an attribute in God's thinking and as Sons and Daughters of God but you were trapped you you you were born in sin the desire might have been there to to to want to be free to to live right and yet you couldn't live right because your nature the so Fallen amen I say to you young people if you don't get the Holy Ghost the world will pull you out it'll draw you whether it be the sports where it'll be just some ungodly girl ungodly boy where it'll be movies television whether it be whatever there's so much there's so much entertainment out there and you well brother brand says about Billy Paul I think he said if God doesn't get a hold of him and filling with the Holy Ghost you know rock and roll would get him and because it's just naturally you know you go to a restaurant and you see a little old baby just a bobbing with that music you know well that baby's unconverted and and there's something there that's already as a sinful nature that's pulling on that well what Christian or what why would we want to go with that music why would we give you know sway to that music and then we set as an onal when when it comes to gospel music coming to the church we just sit there you know because we don't want to get out of order but then we go to to whatever and that rock and roll or whatever and just like you know you know and but what is it it's it's something there that's already in us to start doing those things it's a nature and and so if if you don't get the Holy Ghost then then there's going to be a pool that'll take you out it's it's just that way but he come to break that thing I I tell you we're not serving the lord by our own good will our own strong desires I promise you that CU cuz Satan's got something for for every one of us to take us out and to to to whatever can you say Amen but Jesus came the prophet said to break the clouds back so that that attribute the thinking of God that thought of God that seed of God that God placed in you that God thought of you before you ever become marred and before you ever become in a trap of of Satan and scarred and and and the sinful desires and the sinful pleasure and the the nature there he come to break that thing so that attribute could display itself hallelu this was the purpose of his preaching this was the purpose of him Healing The Sick this was the purpose of his seeing this is why he died and was buried and rose again this was the purpose of his life is to break the shackles of people's lives can you say Amen amen and so the prophet would say he he is God's expressed word speaking of Christ now nothing else could be manifesting other characters had all fallen so then you see what Jesus come to bring back those characters he said no no they were born in sin shaped in iniquity he came as a redeemer ain't that right he came as a redeemer his ministry was a Ministry of redemption reconciliation and and and to redeem anything thing is to bring it back amen bring it back it was God's thought you ain't that right think little old little you little me no one in the world could take my place no one can take yours see and you being a Christian and filled with the spirit of God and before the foundation of the world God seen you and know every creature that you got and Jesus come to bring you back to rescue you ain't that right see and and that had to come to be a human see as a red redemer the God could not do the ministry of redemption by a spirit amen he had to become man amen a a kinsman redeemer the human body to bring you back see that had to come to be a human as a redeemer to display his attributes as Savior come to redeem you and bring you back from where you come from can you amen so then only the redeemed attributes can be a a true Christian and and and brother Bram says no man can have his sins covered lest his name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world ain't that right so truly it is the grace of God that we're standing here today it's it's the grace of God that we are Christians how many believes that amen don't don't don't ever underestimate that don't don't ever underestimate and think well it's just because I'm just you know that's who I am no Satan can take you out in heartbeat if it ain't for the grace of God in your life it's it's just the truth and so we must not take these things for granted the world has misinterpreted the meaning of this word Christian uh you know today Christian means going to church or uh being religious or talking about God uh in the conversations or and and and and in this age if a man says he's a Christian well he's a Christian regardless of how lives regardless of how he talks regardless of his behavior he's just a Christian you know and that has become acceptable amen but the real meaning of the word Christian is to be Christlike everybody say Christlike Christlike Christlike see that's what makes the bride different from from the rest who is claiming to be Christian because there is a a people that is able to be Christlike can you say Amen see and and and so one just can't again as I've said just can't decide to be Christlike you have to be predestinated for it and and if you notice Romans 8:29 for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son aren't you glad for that so so it is possible to be Christlike you you don't have to struggle and and worry and and and just be so up and down and just wandering and no you can rest rest in the predestinated will of God for your life now if if we're to be Christlike then Jesus was more than just sent here just to do his thing but he was set forth as an example do you believe that and the word example means one that serves as a pattern to be imitated or not to be imitated see so so that that's the example in other words you see an example and and and some are an example that you say now you don't want to be like that I don't want to be like that you know uh that's that's an example and you say no no but see but then you see examples that you say now that's way I want to be right I see men and uh brothers and sisters that I look uh uh and and and I see them go through things and I see them how they handle it and I see their characters about them and and I think now god that's way I want to be right there amen why it's an example well Jesus was the Supreme example that we could all as Believers as all as as attributes of God's thinking look at him and say well not yeah he's a good person yeah I I love the way he done those things and no no he's our examp exle is something that should be imitated in our lives in this day do you believe that see and and so I guess we could say that Jesus was a prototype which which is an original model on which something is patterned the church is patterned after him that's right 1 John 2:11 it says he he that saith he abideth in him ought ought himself also to to walk even as he walked see an example right so so the the person that says I'm abiding in Christ well then you ought to walk as he walked live as he lived talk as he talked right and the ministry that he had is the same Ministry that we're having now if he has set forth the example then then what does John 8:29 Jesus said I do always those things that please him that's right please the father right I do always those things that please the father uh you know that he's the example so then if you notice what Paul says in 2 Timothy 2:4 no man Warth that Warth entangleth himself with the Affairs of this life that he may please him who hath called him or chosen him to be a soldier can you say Amen see so so we looking at Jesus being that example you know I always do that which pleased the father was it easy for him to do the will of the father always absolutely not there was always that struggle there was always the flesh Waring against the spirit always and and and yet he was so discipline and and the reason and I have to say it uh because I believe it is that the the sole purpose was love there was such a love there for the people can you say Amen so no man worth and that worth entangleth himself with the Affairs of this life that means that that there the yes there's we're always going to be tempted there's always things in our uh you know the white you know the white dog the black dog brother brandham gives that illustration of the chief you know that that Wars against one another and and and he says well who's winning remember that he says well the one I feed the most right and and so then then we understand that and we're conscience uh that we want to please the father our desires to to to imitate Christ right then then we understand the Warfare that is always within us there there's always that constant Warfare amen there's that constant whether to do right or to do wrong now people that don't care about that they they they just don't care people that don't want to imitate Christ they don't care they can they can drink and talk about God at the same time they can smoke and talk about God they can go to the movies and talk about God they can watch you know all kinds of Filth and still talk about God and there's nothing there amen because the Warfare isn't as as it is with and I that are out to please God then we understand that there's things that can entangle us I believe that Jesus loved the people enough to not tried to do things on his own he loved people enough see he he rested in the father's will he rested in the father's wisdom he rested in the father's Plan of Redemption he rested ain't that right see and to do something on his own would have been to do something contrary to the father's Plan of Redemption ain't that right but he realized that God so loved the world that he was sent to the people to to to to break the bondages to destroy the works of the devil ain't that right this is why Jesus would say in John 530 says I can of my own self do nothing another place my me is to do the will of the father uh another place you know John 5:30 I seek not my own will but the will of the Father which hath sent me and and notice then notice and and the father's will he's saying I've come to do the father's will my meat is to do the will of the father but notice John 6:39 and this is the will of the father this is the Father's will which has sent that all that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing prise God can you amen but should raise it up again at the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone that seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I will raise him up at the last day ain't that right so he knew that he was sent for a group of people he knew he knew that and I want to say it this way if I can your life is not here by accident you're you're sent here by God to be the bride of Christ with the ministry and with that in mind um you're sent here to affect somebody whether you realize that or not it's not just the preacher that that has the ministry but you have a Ministry and that is to affect somebody somebody's got to be affected by you you might be here sent just for one person you might be sent here for just two people you never know Jesus didn't know as far as who was the elect and who wasn't but he knew he was sent he knew he was sent to break the powers of the enemy you understand what I'm saying he knew that amen he had to be in the father's will he had to stay with the father he could not do what he wanted to do he could not he had to stay and and and therefore he had that's you know he had to stay in prayer he had to stay in constant fellowship with the spirit that was within him yes ain't that right but his whole goal was to do the will of the father and he knew the will of the father was I must not lose one of them I must not lose one I think if we would understand that and the only reason why he could do that is because there was the Divine love God so loved the world could you imagine Jesus coming being sent without that same love without having that same passion and he's working a Ministry he's doing these things and people slap him and people Mis abuse him and people misunderstand him and he said I forget them I'm just going to go out in the wood somewhere but he had the same love the very love that the father had because it was God in him ain't that right and and and there's times you know if God has sent you maybe he's put you on a job maybe he's put you in a particular situation that maybe even may not be pleasant to you but yet he's put you there to reach his soul true can you say Amen maybe someone needs to see a real character so God puts us in a place that that it just seemed like the pressure is there and the world is is is whatever and we want to just you know we we want we we want to run or we want to give up or we want to whatever but God has placed you there amen for maybe one Soul maybe five Souls May what whatever it would be and we must we must be at the father's business ain't ain't that right so so Jesus understanding this that I should not lose one I've said it before maybe God has given you a a a a personality God has put you in a position that I I to reach somebody that I would never be able to reach true and you're responsible for that Soul you're responsible you understand what I'm saying as much as I am responsible to preach the gospel whether I feel like it or not I'm responsible for it yes yes right God did not give me the gift of preaching just to benefit me so whether I'm sick or whether I'm not I'm responsible whether I'm on the mountain or whether I'm not I'm responsible ain't that right not always easy not always fun not always whatever but we're responsible but so is it with all of us amen see so there therefore if Jesus understood this that I'm sent for a purpose sent that I may not lose one of them and he's talking about the bride he's talking about but but there there's people that may be in your life that God has placed you there to be a lighthouse and we know it we know that it could be our actions it know we know it it it could be you know maybe Satan trying to get us to do something wrong or something to do you know or to give up and not care or get so discouraged that we just lose our position or we just leave or it whatever it would be but what I'm saying is we ought to be so sensitive to the father's will so sensitive to say God every morning that we wake up we say father I want to do your will who is it that I'm supposed to touch who is it that I'm supposed to speak to you understand Jesus knowing who he was he glorified the father not himself he glorified the father amen he manifested the father he did the works of the father ain't that right amen see and and and we know that he healed the sick and we know that he raised the dead and we know that that you know uh Matthew 4:23 it says Jesus went about all Galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people his f went throughout all Syria and they brought unto him all the sick people that were taken with uh divers diseases and torments and those which were possessed with devils and those which were lunatic and those that had the py and he healed them ain't that right why he was sent to break the powers of the devil ma uh Matthew 8:16 when even was come they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the the spirits with his word and healed all that were sick he discerned the people's hearts and the intent of their thoughts and and and and these things you know um and and and and why did he do it so he could have a Ministry so he could be lifted up no to let the people know that God was among them to let them know that there was a redeemer among them that God had come to save them and to set them free you believe it and the people saw God you believe it the people saw God the blind man who was healed said in John 9:33 speaking of Christ he said if this man were not of God he could do nothing so they knew he was of God that's right Nicodemus said to Jesus in John 3:2 we know that thou art a teacher come from God and no man for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with them ain't that right so they knew that this wasn't just a fleshly manifestation they knew this wasn't just a some carnal in impersonation they knew that this was more than just a man doing these things it was God revealing himself to the people to the people brother Bram said Christ could speak and say the words and what it was and he said it isn't me it's my father that dwelleth in me me and his father that's the reason he prayed to the father now I won't keep you much longer but in him Christ were feelings of compassion I don't think that a person could have God and not have compassion true you believe it uh scripture speaking of God there David said there in Psalms 865 breaking in thou Lord are a God full of compassion and gracious and long suffering and plenteous and mercy and Truth ain't that right Psalms 1458 the Lord is gracious and full of compassion slow to anger and of great Mercy Psalms 7837 their heart was not right with him neither were they steadfast in his Covenant but he being full of compassion forgave their iniquity and destroyed them not yay many a Time turned he his anger away and did not stir up all his wrath ain't that right and then you find that God being in Christ watch the love Jesus so loved the people that even when they rejected his message they rejected that he went up the hill and wept saying oh Jerusalem Jerusalem thou which kill us the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee how often would I gather thy children together as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings and you would not ain't that right and the prophet said that he was weeping when he was saying these words can you imagine the love of God in in a man that even though the people had rejected him he had healed the sick he had raised their dead he would he he had done everything to manifest God to them that he' go up the hill and he would just weep I I I would say it would been a heavy weeping it would be a a sorrowful weeping because everything that he had done and yet they couldn't see God and and instead of hardening his heart the love of God was still there that he would weep and say oh how I would gather you there was it was a compassion brother Bram said of all the human emotions that Christ manifested the most when he appeared as the son of man was this one he wept often he wept for the people because why it was God that so loved and now God had sent and provided a remedy a savior a redeemer and God himself come and lived in that man in that body of Flesh to be the Redeemer and it was the same God now the god that become a man was expressing his love by weeping and by Ministry by trying to help people by trying to deliver them and tried to show them who he really was ain't that right showed that he cared and he says and yet behind that weeping in that Sarah there was still God he wept with compassion at the grave of Lazarus the prophet said and then them same people that had rejected him to think of that the same people that he's weeping for on on the mountain and he's looking at Jerusalem and he's weeping with sorrow because they've rejected him now them same people have hung him on a cross and they're wagging their tongues at him they're mocking him they're saying oh if he be Christ let him come down from the cross if he be God and yet through all of that that Bleeding Heart full of love looking down upon all of them and saying father forgive them for they know not what they do it was a love and there's not one circumstance that could change that love there there was not one situation that could change that love for them that's why it's easy to love our brother it's easy to love one that gives us accolades and and Praises us and say oh you're doing a good job you know it's it's easy to love people that want to be around you but what about those that well brother Bri said love the man that would kill you if he could can you sayen then that speaks of a love that we can't get on our own we can't that requires us to look to God and say God give me that kind of a love God be so real in my life let me come to that full maturity that character fully develop where the love of God could so flow through me how many wants that love I want to imitate it I I I want to be part of that and so brother Bram talks about how that Christ was the expression of what the father is and God is love amen so he says then Jesus was the full expression of love he was loved from the very first time that his little baby hands stroke the pretty cheeks of his mother he was love and he says and I think today that's where many is failing to recognize that he was love 1 John 4:7 says love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God right no not human love we know that not perverted love not filthy love not lust love true not even a love that uh man and woman would have for each other and that's it should be a strong that's a strong love if love is really there but we're talking about a love that far Supreme true amen and this love he that loveth with this love divine love is born of God he comes from God ain't that right and knoweth God and he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love brother Braham talked about his own self he said sometimes down in my heart I feel the Holy Spirit and notice that how he says that I feel the Holy Spirit just weeping for the people think of that but it's no longer in heaven as a spirit God it's no longer him in Christ in that human body weeping brother Brandon said now he's weeping in me I feel that Holy Spirit sometime in my heart weeping for the people he said oh I feel it I'm tired I'm weary I'm wor out my wife says you can't go another time honey you're about to fall you've ministered all day you've been week after week you look awful you're so nervous you can't sit at the table you're on the middle of the floor at night with a pillow in your arms praying for it see praying for his pillow said you're so nervous stay home honey before you die and I said but sweetheart them precious Souls out there to which Christ died for I must do it he said and that's why I'm here I love you God revealed that to the people is my prayer I'm not sent here to be seen or I'm not here to be seen I'm here because I love you I'm trying to shake you with the gospel out of that formal mody condition that the people are in do you believe that aren't you glad that there was a prophet that loved us am there was a prophet that was willing to go beyond and above and he's weak he's tired he's mental about to have the mental breakdowns and and and and his own daughter he's his own baby didn't even know him when he come home didn't know who he was he it broke his heart but he had to keep going because the holy spirit in his heart was weeping for the people what a love right weeping for the people so love brother brah says love for the people was one of the first characters that draw people to Jesus he loved the people and the people knew that he loved them because he had something to tell them they knew this man was acquainted behind the curtain Yonder of death they knew that he knew something about the world beyond the regions Beyond and they so loved to talk with him he talked he talked his talk was seasoned and mellow he said there was something his characters he said I doubt whether there'd be an artist could ever paint it if it's true in a vision one time I saw him and I say that humbly because I couldn't say it positively positive but if if it is there's never an artist could paint that picture of his characters he was a man who could be Stern and speak and yet he was a man who was humble and loving he was so many different characters in him that people you couldn't paint his picture he was God's manifestation of love power and deity and everything was in him can you say amen I hope I ain't borne you today but I hope it speaks to your heart as it has spoken to mine notice what Peter says to the church 1 Peter 4:1 for as much then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that hath suffered In the Flesh has ceased from sin that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men but to the will of God can you say amen and we find that doing the will of the father is is a sign that love has been perfected in us for 1 John 2:5 says but who so keepeth his word in him verily is the love of God perfected hereby know we that we are in him can you sayen as I said before doing the will of God is not the easiest thing because in your flesh you want to be accepted by all men in your flesh you you always want the easy path in your flesh you want everything to be easy and nothing hard and and all of these things but then when you understand that God places you in certain things and it would take the love of God to keep you there to hold you and not to complain and not to murmur and not to compromise but it would keep your heart in tuned you understand it keep you loving I think of so many times you know that Satan has done everything he can within the people of God to bring a bitterness in them to where they just walk away and they have no feeling for one another and they can't they can't get past the mistakes and they can't get past the misunderstanding standings and they they just can't get past to where it divides and separates and and all of these things but I pray God give us that Divine love that we can look past the faults that we can look past one another's blunders and blemishes and we could look past you know the sinner out there we could look past all of these things and the conditions that people are in and instead of breathing fire down we could say well God help him forgive him you understand that we'd be willing to just put aside differences just for the sake of fellowship and love to help somebody you see if we if if we build ourselves a wall and we withdraw ourselves and we're in our little corner how do we affect people amen can you say Amen so our will is in constant is in conflict with his will and it was the same with Christ brother random says our dear Lord Jesus himself in the world's greatest Battleground Gethsemane so Jesus went to the greatest battle of all Gethsemane he cried out in despair should he take the sins of the world or should he just remain on Earth with his beloved disciples which what he wanted to do but watch his humility as he humbled himself not my will but thine be done humbled himself to the word the promised word of the god of heaven and notice then he went a little further and if he went a little further how much more ought we to go a little further and notice the scripture says here in Luke that he prayed earnestly brother and sister if Jesus had to pray earnestly how much more have we got to pray earnestly if Christ the god of Heaven made flesh had to pray earnestly then how much more are we Sinners saved by grace pray earnestly if the decision throwed the Son of God into despair what will it do to you and I and desperately we must cry can you say Amen what is it because we know that we're sent on a mission we know that we must do the father's will we must know that his will is to be carried out and if we do our own will if we do what we want to do then you can't do your will and his will at the same time so Divine love keeps us to the will of the father amen the will of the father Divine love amen if I could set this this way as I close is the will of the father different for us than it was for Jesus I don't think so of course we're not required to Die For The People's sins as he did and we're we're not the Redeemer uh to die and and all of these things that's that's not what I'm saying but we are to preach the gospel as he did we are to do the same works that he did we we we we are to heal the sick and cast out Devils as he did can you say man so this is being this is part of being Christlike a Christian and and so many people that claim to be Christians deny this part they don't believe in healing they don't believe in casting out Devils they don't they they don't believe in the power of God anymore but if we're going to be Christlike then this is what we're called to do we we must not we must in we must not look at someone say man that person is so evil you know I just don't like that person or I just think it's impossible but what what if God has put them in our lives in some way they may persecute us or they may ridicule us or they may bet somewhere down inside there's a seed there and for some reason God is just keeping us there in contact with that person that person could be the most miserable person and it could be a person that is bound by a religious spirit that is setting in a church and yet that brother Bram said a religious spirit is worse than them all that keeps people bound they may know the Bible they may know the message they may know everything but they're so Bound in their heart but what if God has put us there and we must not look at it as an impossible situation you understand what I'm saying because I guarantee you if Christ looked at us and looked at us as an impossible situation we would be in trouble if he looked at us in his discouragements and if he could see and say man there ain't no way it would have been more easier for him to stay there with his disciples that loved him and depended upon him but he went beyond that and done the will of the father for our sakes you love him so why are we preaching the gospel why do we sing why do we play the music why do we come to church why is that we're out in the world in in work and school and and wherever why why are all these things well Paul in 2 Corinthians 5 and 20 says now then now then we are ambassadors of Christ it was Christ being the ambassador of the father for the father sent him to show Christ to show God that's what brother Bram said he was manifested to show God to the people but now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech You by us we pray you in Christ dead be ye reconciled to God can you say Amen so now the holy spirit's in the church weeping for the people and in the ministry that we're in it it's got to be motivated by Divine love I I know we we want to make money and I know we choose jobs for such and these things but our whole motive should be God give me such love for whoever I am to meet today that your co-workers or whatever it's not just to it's not just for your life here so that you can live in greatness and ease and all these God's put Souls into your hand that may not even come to church but brother Bram said there's people that won't even come to church wouldn't even step a foot inside church and you're the only Bible you're the only God that they will see can you say Amen so what good is Ministry without love amen what good is gifts without love what good is the knowledge that we have of the Bible without love can you say Amen may God give us Divine love to where we can see that we are sent by our father to be ambassadors in this generation I look at so many people that are so just confused in this age I thank God I've got the answer I know I got the answer let me make myself available to them don't let them pull on me I want to pull on them don't let them have influence over me I want to have influence over them if the musicians will come we were at a restaurant the other day in in Ron Oak with the family and as we were sitting there you know I a man on the outside of the restaurant it was downtown Ron Oak and a man draw our attention as we looked at him he's just sitting there with the bag of chips talking to chips he starts talking to the ground you know and people passing by would just look at him like he's just strange and I told the family I hate that devil I hate him that he would take a human being and destroy that man thought he would be an innocent man an innocent baby born innocently something happened in his life I don't know what it was but the man's mind was totally burnt had no hope and I thought oh God have mercy on that man just have mercy and I think of so many people just like that you just want to help people somehow and it wouldn't be good just to give them another bag of chips it wouldn't be good just to give them what they're asking for can of beer that's what they think they need but what they really need is someone to give them a way of life what they really need is to accept this eternal Plan of Redemption can you say man I Don't Want to Go to Heaven by myself I want to take people with [Music] me and we look at what brother Bram talked of the invasion of the United States and we're saying it so real today people are just bound everywhere [Music] my wife talking to an individual the other day that used to come to this church totally backslid now going to a Church of God Church of Christ or whatever the individual says I but I still have I still want to know about the message I got questions I thought oh God if we can reach her somehow reach that individual somehow let them know that there's truly a God that loves her that cares I told my wife make every every way possible for us to get her reach her talk to her fellowship with her make yourself available that's what we want to do can you say Amen church it's not us they don't need to see some talent that we got there's so much talent out in the world they don't need to have personality there's so much good personalities out there but what they want is to see God brother BR say the world is crying for love he also said that their only love will be found is in the elect so may we the father be expressed through us may he weep through us may he speak through us may he testify through us may be reflected through us can you say amen and there may be people all around that we look and say man I don't know they're just a nut job that it could be that person it could be that person that needs you any you say amen amen what [Music] song no just no more love I could never ever out love the Lord say it again I want to live the way he wants me I want to give until there's just no more to give I want to love love till there's just no more love I could never ever out love my Lord saying it again I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more to give I want to love love till there's just no more love I could never ever out love when you have that love it it just makes you want to abstain from the world makes you just not want to get entangled with the cares the Affairs of life makes you just makes you want to become more of a channel that God could flow through that Divine love just makes you just want to unclog all channels in our lives that brother Bram talked about so that God could speak through that God could reflect himself through amen oh my isn't he wonderful to us today amen amen we want to live the way he would want us to live there's that little song too uh pleasing let me be pleasing to thee Oh [Music]
