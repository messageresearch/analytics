Left behind heaven's throne to build it here inside. And there at the cross you paid the debt I owe. You broke my chains, freed my soul. For the first time I had hope. Thank you Jesus for the blood of Thank you Jesus. It has washed me white. Oh thank you Jesus. You have saved my life. You brought me from the darkness into glorious light. Now you took my place, laid inside my tomb of sin. You were buried for 3 days, but then you walked right out again. Now death has no stain and life has no end. For I have been transformed by the blood of the lamb. Thank you Jesus for the blood applied. Thank you Jesus. It's washed me white. Oh, thank you Jesus. You have saved my life. You brought me from the darkness into glorious light. Sing it again. Oh, thank you Jesus for the blood applied. Thank you Jesus. It has washed me white. Oh, thank you Jesus. You have saved my life. You brought me from the darkness into glorious light as they would just play softly. Now, we've got a a written prayer request we want to make known. Amen. But first of all, we've got a testimony. Amen. is uh put in by sister Kim Brunumfield says, "I want to thank the Lord and give him praise for protecting my grandson." Uh, brother Levi Beach, he had totaled his vehicle last night, flipped it twice, and ended up in the creek upside down. Uh, his seat belt jammed, but he was finally able to uh get free and he swam back to the vehicle or to the back of the vehicle and uh got out that way. Amen. Is uh she said, "God was so merciful." Amen. We thank the Lord for what he did. Amen. Can you give the Lord a hand clap of praise? Amen. We also want to thank the Lord for touching Sister Lisa uh Acres. Good to have her back in church with us tonight. Amen. But let's just uh says, "Please pray for Wanda Smith. She had a stroke last Thursday. uh her and uh Robert Robera Poff will most likely uh be placed in a nursing home soon. So, let's just remember uh uh these people here tonight that the Lord would just uh comfort them. Amen. How many has an unspoken request but lift your hands? Amen. We want to keep Brother Zachary and uh Brother Jonathan Martin. Uh they're overseas. Amen. So, let's just pray that the Lord would just use them in a special way, but also bring them back safely. Amen. Maybe we could ask brother Terry if he would come and lead us in prayer tonight. Let's remember our pastor. Amen. That the Lord would just move in a special way. Amen. How many can say, "Lord, I need a touch from you." Amen. &gt;&gt; So, so good to be in his presence again. Bow heads. you just pray in your way as I lead in prayer. Heavenly Father, what a glorious hour that we're living in. We understand that we're living in Satan's kingdom, Satan's paradise. This is his hour that he's exalted, wanted to exalt himself like he said in Isaiah 14, and he's pretty much done it in this world as the God of all the kingdoms. But father, what a paradox it is that in this last day, not only has Satan uh become exalted, but God, you have chosen a bride and you sent a message and a word to bring her to a state of perfection, even innocence, even to uh a condition of adoption. What a paradox where you have the worst and then you have your chosen, oh God. But it's not anything we did, but it's all that you have done. We're thankful that you sent us a message. You sent us a prophet. You sent us guidance and certainly a light in this dark hour to show us how to walk. And truly, you're a lamp into our feet, a light into our pathway. And we're so thankful. I pray, Lord, for this request for Wanda, you know, her condition, all that is facing there. I pray that you would touch and undertake in her behalf. Lord, we're thankful for the two testimonies given in because we know that you are our healer. Whether it come by a miracle, instantaneous divine healing, it doesn't matter, Lord. But you promise to heal and by your stripes, we are already healed. We thank you for that great promise that we have. You said, "Whatsoever things you desire when you pray, believe that you shall receive them and you shall have them." And we believe that. Thank you for the little church here, the congregation, each one assembled tonight. Lord, as you uh give the words to our pastor to preach, Lord, anoint him to speak those things and may they be edification to our soul. Whether it be uh encouragement, whether it be a sharp sword, whatever it might be, Lord, that you have for us, we just want your divine will tonight. Bless us, we pray. We thank you for the all that you've done for us in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Oh, thank you Jesus for the blood applied. Thank you Jesus. It has washed me white. Oh, thank you Jesus. You have saved my life. You brought me from the darkness into glorious light. You can be seated. [Music] Oh, I was a wretch. I remember who I was. I was lost. I was blind. I was running out of time. Oh, sin separated. The breach was far too wide. But from the far side of the chasm, you held me in your sight. So you made a way across the great divide. Left behind heaven's throne to build it here inside. And there at the cross, you paid the debt I owe. broke my chains, freed my soul. For the first time I had hope. Oh, thank you Jesus for the blood of Thank you Jesus. It has washed me wine. Oh, thank you Jesus. You have saved my life. You brought me from the darkness into glory. As mom gets ready to come, let's sing it again. Thank you, Jesus, for the blood applied. Thank you, Jesus. It has washed me white. Oh, thank you Jesus. You have saved my life. You brought me from the darkness into glorious light. Amen. I just want to testify of my healing, too. So, I've been dealing with something in my body and um um that sermon that Sean preached the other day. Um I can't remember exactly. I think it was just before we went to Oklahoma or something. and it's just really helped solidify things in my heart. But you know, when say when God comes, then of course the devil wants to try to come behind it &gt;&gt; and just feed you with fear or these different things and um just I've been, you know, just sometimes playing a message and you're not necessarily paying attention right at the moment. I'm doing things around the house, but it just seems like the Lord keeps just drawing my attention at just certain times to just keep anchoring my faith and and just to reject that fear. &gt;&gt; And so I just I want to testify it beforehand. I still may be dealing with symptoms, but I believe that it's done. &gt;&gt; And I'm just like brother Ram said, I guess, devil, if you want to stick around and keep hearing me testify, then that's up to you. But it's going to go. So I just thank him for that. All the saints and angels bow before your throne. [Music] All the elders cast their crowns before the lamb of God and sing. You're worthy of it all. [Music] You're worthy of it all. For from you are all things and to you are all things. You deserve the glory. [Music] You're worthy of it all.

And can you stand to your feet as we invite our pastor to come? Where would I be? You only know. I'm glad you see through eyes of love. A hopeless case, [Music] an empty place. If not for grace. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound. I once was lost, but now I'm found. I was a hopeless case. an empty place if not for grace. Precious Lord, oh precious Lord, please take my hand. Lead me all and let me stand. A hopeless case, an empty place. If not for grace, where would I be? Where would I be? [Music] [Music] case an empty place if not for grace. Oh precious Lord, please take my hand and lead me on and let me stand. A hopeless case, an empty space if not for grace. [Music] Well, aren't you glad for the grace of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's with us every day of our lives. And a lot of times we don't realize just I think of, you know, his grace that is with us every day. and keeping us safe. And amen. I think it's the grace of God that we're here tonight. Amen. To worship him. And uh it's good to see everyone in the house of the Lord. Trust you had a good day today. And uh the musicians can be dismissed. And if you have your Bibles, we're just going to go right on into the word uh the book of Zechariah. And while you're turning, um I um glad to hear that the Lord kept Levi safe there. Amen. And um um we uh got to know him a little bit and he's just a fine young man. But um also um brother Hunter uh let me know this evening about their meeting coming up next week. And um so it's going to be starting actually a week from today uh November um or November October 8th through the 12th. And um so um the service time will be at 7:00 uh through Friday and um and then Saturday evening we'll start at 6 and um so the Lord's blessed them with a new building and u I've seen some pictures of it and it's looks just a beautiful place and uh so we're really happy for them and Um, so they're going to be dedicating it um uh during this uh time. I don't know who will be ministering uh but uh I'm sure you will be blessed if you're able to go and um uh we just be uh praying that God just blesses them abundantly. Also, uh brother Andrew asked me to greet you all and uh he's there in Alabama with brother Homer this evening. And so, um, anyways, I, uh, I guess most everyone know they've just had their baby, uh, girl. And so, uh, she's a a cutie. And, and then, um, um, the little Malachi, he was, you know, kicking a ball in the house. He fell, broke a, uh, broke his leg. Um, I think his femur or something. So he's in a cast. The whole leg, one's whole leg is in the cast and then the other leg is part in the cast. So he's in bad shape. And so u I'm sure they'll appreciate your prayers for that. And it all happened at the same time around u uh the birth and and so uh sister Mariah's got her hands full. Amen. and and so we want to keep them in our prayer that the Lord will help them. Let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer as we talk to our Lord. Father, we just thankful, Lord, that you've had your hand upon us. Lord, even in times that we don't even know, you've kept us from danger. We thank you, Lord, for keeping our young brother Levi and uh keeping him safe. And Father, we just so indebted to you of your mercy. And we're just asking that you would be with us this evening and that you would just move among us, Father. that you would just take our the simple thought that I believe you've laid on my heart and that you would just uh uh multiply it to us. And Father, give us an a greater understanding. Father, we need you tonight. And pray that you would anoint both speaker and hearer. Bless brother Andrew as he would be ministering tonight. Father, I pray that you just bless the bride around the world. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Praise the Lord. Uh so um Zechariah and um we're going to look at the fourth chapter and um the um first verse will start there. But it says, "And the angel that talked with me came again and wake me as a man that is wakened out of his sleep and said unto me, what seeest thou?" And I said, I have looked, and behold, a candlestick of all of gold, with a bowl on up on top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof, and two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof. And so I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, "What are these, my Lord?" And the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, "Knowest thou not what these be?" And I said, "No, my Lord." Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, "This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts." Amen. Then if you'll turn to Zechariah the 12th chapter and just read one uh verse there. Zechariah 12 and 10. And I will pour upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplications. And they shall look upon me whom they have pierced. And they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn. Amen. You can have your seats this evening. And if I were to use a title, it would be the uh spirit of grace is upon us. And uh we know that grace is and uh it's the unmmerited favor that is shown to someone who doesn't deserve it. Right. And uh so every Christian should kn know what what this this means. Grace is as old as the world is. And we first see the display of God's grace in the beginning um when it was displayed to the human race in the Garden of Eden and God had given his law to man and told man, you know, not to do a certain thing and uh that if he were to do it, then he would die in the day that he would eat thereof. And so we find that everything was going good and then Eve stepped across the uh separating line the prophet would say by transgressing against God's law &gt;&gt; and she enticed her husband to do the same uh there and and um and so you know uh as we know that a law isn't a law unless there's a penalty to that law. &gt;&gt; Um, you know, if if it says don't run the stop line and there's no penalty, then there's no law uh uh to that. But but God had a law. &gt;&gt; And so that day, God would come down as he always did in the cool of the evening to fellowship with Adam and Eve. and and uh but uh when when he came down, he knew that something was wrong um because they weren't there. Uh and it was a darkness. Brother Bram said there was just a dark mist hanging over the garden and the birds weren't singing that day. The the the wind wasn't blowing. There was nothing to stare. The the leaves weren't even moving. It was just a darkness and prophet said there no doubt there there there wasn't a star that was shining um uh that that evening uh because sin had blotted out the light &gt;&gt; and God came down as the prophet would describe it. He he came down roaring like a thunder. &gt;&gt; And he would go calling out, "Adam, where art thou?" And we know that Adam, he realized that he was uh unclothed and and so he tried to cover himself up so to meet God. And when God come to meet with him and Adam come into his presence, Amen. Uh God found him hiding. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And which tells us that no matter what covering that man comes up with uh it's not good enough for God's presence. Ain't that right? And and so brother Brandham would tell us that this covering was man's religion. &gt;&gt; Amen. Man tries to cover himself up with his own religion. And and so Adam had nowhere to go. He had nowhere to turn. Uh he and his wife, they they had no way out. Uh because they they they were guilty. They were unc in condemnation, under condemnation. Uh, brother Ram said that the holy image of God left them. Uh, the sinful nature, countenance, and and all of these things. It it must have been quite a change &gt;&gt; uh for them to experience peace and then all of a sudden fear &gt;&gt; to have this fellowship and understanding of God and and all of a sudden it it loses its its uh uh there's no understanding as what he had and there's no fellowship and and all of that. But when it was all bleak and it looked like it was just uh no way out, grace provided a way out. &gt;&gt; And the prophet would tell us that God killed some sheep, took the skins, and it it showed that something had to die to cover sin. &gt;&gt; Church joining will never cover sin. No driedyed confession will ever cover sin. It takes sorrow and repentance and the grace of God to cover sin for the blood of Jesus Christ, the one that God killed at Calvary to cover sin. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So, uh um you know, to believe that anyone can be a Christian uh uh would would would be wrong. or to think that anyone can believe this message uh it it w would be a wrong thought because it's the grace of God &gt;&gt; that that does this. You know a person can't even be a Christian without the grace of God. How many believes that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Can't even be a Christian without the grace of God. Amen. People can go to church. They can worship. They can get involved with the music and hear the word of God being preached, but no man can be saved without grace. That's right. &gt;&gt; And I thank God for grace &gt;&gt; cuz you're not saved by your desire. &gt;&gt; You're not saved by good will. &gt;&gt; You're not saved by your determination. You're not saved by your smart and and education and all of that. Ain't that right? And so uh something that uh we see is that grace cannot be bought and it cannot be sold. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; You cannot bargain for it by saying God if you'll do this then I'll do this or if I do this then then then I expect you to do this and uh there there's no bargaining for grace. &gt;&gt; Grace is unmmerited. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And so the prophet says with grace, you cannot pull nothing out of God. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Now think of that. You cannot pull nothing out of God. God gives it to you by his grace. &gt;&gt; So you cannot merit God's grace. And this, you know, by doing good deeds and and and this may be simple, but just to remind us of really why we're here tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ephesians 2:8, it says, "For by grace you are saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God." So even if we have the faith to believe, that's not of ourselves, that's by grace. For it is the gift of God that has been given to us, not of works, lest any man should boast. Ain't that right? So if God is dealing with you, if if if God brings conviction to you, that's the grace of God that has come to you. &gt;&gt; If um you know uh uh Jesus said in John 6:44, "No man, everybody say no man &gt;&gt; can come to me except the father &gt;&gt; which hath sent me draw him." no man. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And and and so when you really think of that, you couldn't come even to Christ. You couldn't come to the knowledge of believing in God and believing in knowing what you know and being sold out to this without grace. &gt;&gt; The father had to call you and in invite you uh uh to this. Ain't that right? The prophet said, "Grace has to save you." &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Grace has to save you. So if if you have an understanding of what God has done in this day and is doing uh in this age, it's the grace of God that has come to you. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Luke 10:22, "And all things are delivered to me of my Father, and no man knoweth who the Son is." Everybody say, "No man knoweth." No man knoweth who the Son is. Amen. Everybody's just guessing who the Son is. They They've got their idea of who the Son is. They say they're worshiping the Son, but but but it it's through an idea of who the Son is. For no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father, and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him. Ain't that right? And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see. Can you say amen? They they were in a world of of of millions of people that that could not see what they were seeing. Ain't ain't that right? But it was it was grace unto them. Amen. Upon their lives according to the Bible that uh uh there's going to be an overcomer. And the only comer the the only the overcomer is going to go in the rapture. Amen. And so who is the overcomer? Amen. The prophet said the overcomer is the one who has overcome the temptation of the age that he lived in. Ain't that right? See, he's overcome every denominational critic. He's overcomes all po the popular sins of the age in which he lives. Overcomes all the worldly things of this age. Ain't that right? But yet if you have the ability to overcome, it's only by the grace of God that is brought to you. Amen. I no, no matter how determined you are, no matter how new uh uh much New Year's leaf uh uh new, you know, resolutions you make, it takes the grace of God for man to overcome. Can you say amen? People are living uh you know today and who just can't seem to overcome and yet there's others that are overcoming. Now I want to just say this church we we are in a battle. We are in a real battle. Uh Christian life is not a makebelie. Christian life isn't a mind over matter. It it is something that is real. It's something that is um you know, we're really dealing with demonic spirits. Ain't that right? And the prophet told us that the lid of hell has been uh uh lifted off and demons are pouring in. That is a literal happening. &gt;&gt; It literally happened that demons, amen, were poured in, amen, in this uh in this rim of mortality. Amen. in and is able to have its effect. &gt;&gt; Amen. People don't know why. Amen. The things that are going on as they're, you know, uh uh coming into churches now and shooting up as y'all just saw that uh Mormon uh what happened to the Mormons uh there at that church in Michigan and it it's happening more prominent and and shootings every day and murders and and uh just all kinds of chaos. Amen. It's It's simply because demon power is at work. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; People say, "Well, they're good boys. They they that was a good girl and and and all these things and they just don't know what happened." Well, we know what happened is demonic powers is is controlling. &gt;&gt; Amen. And these powers uh of of these spirits cannot be broken without the grace of God. Don't turn me down. I don't know what's happened. Oh, my my microphone fell. Sorry. Uh uh the uh and so we the power of these spirits cannot be broken without the grace of God. Ain't that right? You know, Brother Brandham talks about these cigarettes and and and and he said he was talking to some folks uh about it and and and and uh one one man said, you know, um uh you know, cigarettes um uh they're they're hard uh hard to overcome. And and brother Ram said, "Well, it's it's because it's a devil." Amen. And he talks about how there are people that come through the line and got healed of cancer and and before you know it, they go right back to smoking cigarettes again. &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Ram said, "You cannot stop smoking cigarettes unless the power of God is upon you." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; No matter. I've seen it. I've seen kin folk that that tried to quit that, you know, and it's just only a little old a stick. Amen. And you got a, you know, 200 and some pound guy that's just a muscle or whatever and yet that little thing seems to control him. But it's just a spirit. &gt;&gt; It's a power of the devil. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And so you can't stop it unless the power of God is upon you. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon talks of two men that he knew and they smoked. And he said both of them wanted to be men of God. One of them, as soon as I led him to Christ, he started to light up a cigarette. He smoked five to six packs a day and just sat and just light one after another all day long. And he tried to light another cigarette and something just wouldn't let him. He walked over to the stove, not knowing that the scriptures condemned those things, and opened up the stove and shoved the pack in the stove and that settled it. And where another fella that wanted to become a Christian, he tried his best. He cried out to the Lord. He quit them for two or three weeks. And when he come to himself in that condition, he went out of his mind. See, he come to himself and found himself out in the backyard beating on a piece of tin out of his head. He run in the house real quick, grabbed his cigarettes, and smoked a pack before he left the house that evening, just one right after the other. He said, "See, one was called for no man can come to the father except the father draws him and all the father has given me will come to me." Can you say amen? Well, what did the warning mean? It was to life to one. He saw it. You can't see it unless God reveals it. For it's hid from the eyes of the wise and prudent and revealed to babes such as we'll learn. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; We think of another that's an addiction and that's pornography. Pornography is it's an addiction. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and that cannot be broken without the grace of God. Amen. I I looked up a um uh just uh the research and and in 2023 the popular site Pornhub reported that it has more than a 100 million daily visits. a 100 million daily visits. And And it's it's many many I and it's not just men. It's it's women that are under a a bondage to pornography. &gt;&gt; Research shows that the addiction to pornography is just the same as the addiction is to drugs. It's the same. It works the same way. They say it works on the on a person the same way drugs uh uh do and and these things and and so uh uh uh uh you know so that there are there are those who uh just declare they they can't quit. And so the excuse is well God knows just who I am and and and and and knows that you know we're just men and and humans and all that. But then there's those that have that ability to walk away from it. I don't think we have to make excuses. I just believe that there's a power that can break the chains of the devil. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. But it takes grace. It's a it's grace unto us. If if you're able to walk away from your habits, that's grace. If you're able just to leave things behind, that's grace. Can you say amen? I understand there's maturity and I understand there's growth and and all of these things, but as you see grace in a man's life and and and what is it? He's able to walk away from the past. He's able to walk away, amen, from those things that would try to bind him down. I I I just believe that. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now Romans 9:15, it says, "For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on him, I will have mercy, and I will have compassion, on whom I will have compassion." So then it is not of him that willth, nor of him that runth, but of God that showeth mercy. Can you say amen? Now, I want to say, if you have the least desire to serve God, that's the grace of God upon your life. That's right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? If you have the ability to repent of your uh wrongs and your mistakes, that's the grace of God. Amen. If you have the ability to overcome, that's only by the grace of God. If you have the ability to believe and to keep pressing on, Amen. regardless of everything that goes on, that's the grace of God upon your life. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Philippians 2:13, it says, "For it is God which workketh in you." It's God. Amen. The spirit of grace that workketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't believe that it's just uh uh God working to will. Amen. in us to will I want to. I desire and then that's as far as we go with it. I believe that this bride is moving on into action. &gt;&gt; Not only willing to do it, but doing it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Revelations 19:7 it says, "Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come." And notice his wife. Everybody say his wife. &gt;&gt; A man hath made herself ready. &gt;&gt; Now we're not looking at some woman over there. We are part of this. his wife, me, &gt;&gt; you &gt;&gt; have made herself ready. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So, what is she? What does it mean? She is standing as an overcomer. &gt;&gt; She is the spotless, sinless bride of Jesus Christ. All right. &gt;&gt; And don't think for a moment, a man, that this bride hath made herself ready by her own will, by her own desires, by her own effort, and by her own talent and her strength. So, how does she make get into this condition of being ready? &gt;&gt; As as the scripture saith, it's not by might nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord. Do you believe that? Now notice what was foretold in Zechariah 4:7. Who art thou, oh great mountain before Zerubabel, thou shalt become a plain. You know, I I thought of this and and and we know we there's a lot of mountains. We have mountains. I don't care what it is. Whether it's a mountain of of habits and mountains of traditions, mountains of sickness, whatever it is. Amen. There comes a time that God said that mountain shall become a plain &gt;&gt; and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace unto it. Now, brother Brandham talks about that scripture and he says, "Now, this is foretelling, of course, of when the seventh angel would come to restore the faith of the children back to the father." In other words, rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So, so this when this mountain shall become a plain is when the the uh the message amen of Malachi 4 would come. Amen. And and of course the message of Malachi 4 fits with uh the seventh angel of Revelations 10:7. It's the one and the same. Ain't that right? Amen. And he begins the sound and he begins to restore a church &gt;&gt; back &gt;&gt; to the faith. &gt;&gt; He restores the church back by the power of God. Can you say amen? Rebuilding the church. Amen. Brother Brown says God by the Holy Spirit will bring forth the church in these last days. Do you believe that? Amen. The worst age ever. Amen. The most difficult age ever, the darkest times ever. And yet God by his holy spirit is going to bring forth a church in these last days. &gt;&gt; How is he going to do it? By his grace. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you look at the church, the prophet said that this church is called the called the elect lady misgrace. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. She's the elect lady. Misgrace. &gt;&gt; That's what you are. &gt;&gt; Misgrace. You're not You're not identified with with what the Baptist are doing. The apostolic and the Presbyterians and all of these things. You're not identified with the works of man. You are misgrace. &gt;&gt; You're identified with the power of grace. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? She is an elected woman. Now, Brother Bram speaks of us as the bride. He says, "He, the bridegroom, took away your shame." Well, aren't you glad for that? There's no way that he you could have your shame taken off away. You couldn't be good enough to take away your shame. But he by grace took away your shame. Amen. and put it in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life. Your first wedding was analled. It was you never done it in the first place. &gt;&gt; Another place he said you were trapped into it. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? God made sure that your enemy could not bring up your accusations and your past and remind him of it. Every time the devil reminds God of your past, he can't remember it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He doesn't even know what that devil's talking about. &gt;&gt; And when you remind God of your past, Amen. He doesn't even know what you're talking about because it's under the blood. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham says, "You're pure, unadulterated." Oh, hallelujah. Leaving soon for the skies. Amen. Standing ready. Think your garments washed by the water of the bleeding word. &gt;&gt; The word become blood. The word bled for you. And you're washed in the bleeding word. The word bleeding. The life of God in the word. The word was bled for you that you might be washed. &gt;&gt; God provided a way out. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; God provided a way out. If he hadn't provided a way out, all of our covering of religion would not work. We couldn't stand before God spotless and and and justified. Amen. But God provided a blood. And the word bled that you might be washed from the filth of these prostitutes and be clean and and sanctified by the washing of the water of the word. that makes your mind and heart stayed on God and on his word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, not notice what he says. This is it from the invisible union. He says, "And you're not only that, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; but you're going to the wedding &gt;&gt; in the sky." &gt;&gt; Going to that wedding supper as we know the invisible union is taking place on the earth now. And you are wearing, everybody say, I am wearing &gt;&gt; the wedding band of predestinated unmarited grace, a wedding band of grace, unmarited of your own. God did it himself. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. He knew you before the foundation of the world. So he slipped the wedding band on you. There put your name on a book. I think of what David said. It is he that hath made us and not we ourselves. &gt;&gt; We are the making of God's grace. &gt;&gt; You believe it? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Throughout the Bible, God has exerted his grace towards men and women as an example to us of what his grace can do. And we know these stories, but it's it's it fits us. But we look at Rahab. She of course was a harlot. But she was a gentile, a prostitute. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; She was a heathen. &gt;&gt; She was not in the lineage of Abraham in the natural seed. That's right. &gt;&gt; She had no rights to the covenant that God made Abraham. &gt;&gt; She had no right to the blessings of God. She wasn't considered as one of God's chosen people. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. She was actually part of the enemy that God told Joshua to destroy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And Joshua was coming to destroy her, her people, and her city. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. everything that she was known uh used to and her surroundings and her upbringings and and all of those things Joshua was coming to destroy. &gt;&gt; But notice what she asked there in Joshua 2:12. I pray you swear unto me by the Lord since I have showed you kindness that you will also show kindness unto my father's house and give me a true token and that you will save alive my father my mother. Notice not just praying for herself. &gt;&gt; But now she's asking for a family. &gt;&gt; Amen. You'll save the life my father, my mother, my brethren, my sisters, and all that they have and deliver our lives from death. &gt;&gt; Now, church, she didn't deserve the grace of God. &gt;&gt; She had no right to ask these two spies for mercy. There was no literature that she could read of grace. Amen. And mercy being promised to her. &gt;&gt; As far as she knew, there was nothing promised to her. back distraction. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; But see, God knew her before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And God placed her in that time for such a time as that. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? He poured upon her the spirit of grace. She was given a token by grace. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? She was given a promise that was not part of the Abrahamic covenant. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; But God by grace gave her a promise. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, this promise is found in Joshua 2:18. Behold, the spies says, "When we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didest, let us down by, and thou shalt bring thy father, mother, and brethren, and and all thy father's household home unto thee." Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Now, notice she believed the promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She didn't have to say, "Well, I wonder if it's going to work. I better just see and just see if they're not see maybe they're lying to me. Maybe they're just teasing me or whatever. She went to work immediately. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. To go get her family. She went through that city wherever they were compelling them to come in where the token was. And when the death angel came uh Joshua with his army, she did not have to worry one bit for the token was on display. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We find that grace not only delivered her from death, but she become part of Israel by marrying an officer in the army. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And through Ahab come the lineage of Christ. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; It was a lineage of grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. We find that Rahab bore a son by the name of Boaz, &gt;&gt; which Boaz was a type of Jesus Christ. Ain't that right? And Boaz married who? &gt;&gt; Well, some of us is awake. Boaz married Ruth. &gt;&gt; Now, we look at Ruth. She was undeserving of God's grace. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Ruth was a Moabitete, not an Israelite. And her ancestry started, Amen. Uh uh from incest. Amen. Which was an evil act before God. She had no covenant with God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; She had no promise like the children of Israel had. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? She didn't deserve God's grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. She she had no right to expect God's grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because there was no covenant of grace to her. Amen. But God rich in mercy poured out his spirit of grace upon her. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; She left her land and all that she knew. We know that her uh the other one op uh uh Orpa a man wanted to leave. Said that she was going to go as well. But when Naomi discouraged them, amen, and told him to stay behind, Amen. Or kissed uh Naomi and she turned back to what she was born in. &gt;&gt; But Ruth would not be discouraged. &gt;&gt; God knew her before the foundation of the world. I say these things because God raised these women up to show us and where we could be identified in the scriptures for this last day. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Ruth uh 1:15. And she Naomi said, "Behold, thy sister-in-law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods, return thou after thy sister-in-law." And Ruth says, "Entreat me not to leave, or to return from following after thee. For whether thou goest, I will go. &gt;&gt; Where thou lodest, I will lodge. Thy people shall be my people. Thy God, my God. Where thou dest will I die, and there will I be buried. The Lord do so to me, and more also if ought but death part thee and me. And when she Naomi saw that she, Ruth, was steadfastly minded to go with her, then she left, speaking unto her. Amen. In other words, she tried no more to discourage her. See, God gave grace unto Ruth. &gt;&gt; And I I want to say this. Don't blame people for walking away from this message. Don't Don't Don't blame people, Amen. when they don't see what you see. See, the only way you see it is by God's grace. &gt;&gt; The only way you have a desire for this is by God's grace. The only way you're pressing on is by God's grace. Can you say amen? And God would have an orpa to to to type out those that just oh well they say I'm going to go they maybe start out to go but then they turn back over any little old discouragement. Amen. But there is a Ruth in this age that says no. Thy God will be my God. Thy thy people be my people. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. God brought Ruth to Boaz. And I like what brother Biscoll said one time. Her marriage to Boaz did not degrade Boaz. It did not make Boaz any lesser. &gt;&gt; It only elevated Ruth's position. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It changed Ruth. It changed her life &gt;&gt; because she was in marriage in union with Boaz. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; See, and it tied her to the covenant that God made to Israel. &gt;&gt; It made her reputation better than ever. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And through her come the lineage of Christ. You see, God shows us that his grace elevates us to a place where we couldn't have come &gt;&gt; without it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You here we are promised adoption of sons. Here we're coming into such a place that no other age has come to. We're coming to the manifestation of sunship &gt;&gt; that no other age has come to. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But God's grace has been given to us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God also shows that his grace not only comes to us in the beginning, but it stays with us throughout our walk with God. Take Abraham for example. He was a heathen, an idoltor. He's just like everyone else around him. Nothing special about him, just an ordinary man. But God had predestinated him before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when God came to him, called him, grace, his the calling was by grace. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And grace empowered Abraham &gt;&gt; to leave his country. to leave everything that he had known, to leave the past behind, &gt;&gt; and to look for another city. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; The rest of the people stayed behind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because God didn't call them out, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? It was just Abraham. Abraham had the call. &gt;&gt; Abraham had the grace. &gt;&gt; Abraham had the promise. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; See, and so, you know, this this is where I think uh that that well, we know that when God extended grace to Abraham, God required obedience from Abraham. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think this is where people get it get it wrong when they think that God doesn't require of them to do anything because of his grace. That's that's that's a lie. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you look that when grace comes to a person, God gives them something to do. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that Noah found grace &gt;&gt; in the eyes of the Lord &gt;&gt; and he built an ark. He prepared an ark for the salvation of his household. &gt;&gt; He had grace to do that. &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; He had grace to know the will of God. &gt;&gt; He had grace to know what God was going to do. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God extended grace to Abraham, but he had to re or to to Jacob, but he had to wrestle it out with an angel. &gt;&gt; That's right. till he became changed. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; God's grace was with Israel. Amen. God sent them a prophet when they were in Egypt. God sent him a prophet with the message of deliverance, but they had to apply the blood. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Over the door of their house. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; They had to do something. But it was grace with them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The message of grace, the prophet said, has been tramped under the feet of men until it's become a disgrace. &gt;&gt; Some of them runs out into eternal security. Some runs out into well, oh, everything, but the true message of grace remains the same. And there's where Satan tries to knock it out from the church. Ain't that right? But look, Abraham obeyed God and and left most everything behind. &gt;&gt; Now, he didn't fully obey God as we know. He he brought Lot with him and he brought his dad with him and and all that, but he started out. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandham says, "But in in the journey, Abraham's journey, Abraham tested God's patience." &gt;&gt; Wow. God told him, he said, "You stay in the land that I brought you into. Stay there. Don't get out of it." &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? This land of promise. Don't don't don't leave it. And as soon as famine hit, Abraham runs. &gt;&gt; He goes into the Philistine country. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. And where it just seemed like everything was just smooth and going good. See, and he did exactly what God told him not to do. But the grace of God was with him. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And grace kept Pharaoh from taking uh uh Abraham's wife. Remember Abraham lied to the king about Sarah, &gt;&gt; telling him it was it it's my sister. See, and yet the prophet says, "But the grace of God held him because he repented." He was willing to repent. And anybody that's willing to repent, the grace of God still goes for you. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; See, so he says God saved Abraham because of his grace, not because of his behavior. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Talking about grace now. Another place Abraham spoke of us. Amen. Uh he said God took Abraham by grace and saved him. And that's how he takes you is by grace. And you know and how do we test his patience? Today we're up, tomorrow we're down. One day we believe, the next day we're wandering. Today we're Methodists, tomorrow we're Baptist, today we believe in divine healing, you know. tomorrow this tummy ache, you know, comes and we don't know whether we believe it or not. But yet in the midst of all of that, God wants us to stay put. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Don't leave the land. But he saves us anyhow. If it wasn't the grace of God, we'd all be gone. &gt;&gt; How many believes that? we'd all be gone. God showed grace to David there in in uh 1 Chronicles 17 and 7 says, "Now therefore, thus shall thou say unto my servant David, thus sayith the Lord of hosts, I took thee from the sheep coat sheep coat, even from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Think of that. It was the grace of God. &gt;&gt; David started out in humble beginnings and then ended up reigning as a king. &gt;&gt; God did that by grace. &gt;&gt; He said, "And I have been with thee wherever whethersoever thou hast walked and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and hath made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth. Also I will adorn ordain a place for my people Israel and will plant them and they shall dwell in their place and shall be moved no more. Neither shall the children of wickedness waste them anymore as at the beginning. What is it? It's grace. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we know that David fell in sin and he saw Beth Sheeba uh taking a bath and he committed adultery with her as we know and she become expectant with a child and then David to try to hide that sin. He had Basheba's husband Uriah killed. He thought everything was taken care of and &gt;&gt; but God saw everything that he did. God sent a prophet by the name of Nathan to David and David Nathan began to, you know, talk to to David. And he told him a parable of a rich man who had many lambs. And his neighbor by him had only one lamb, just a a poor guy, but he only had just one lamb. and and this rich man had, you know, was going to have a party and invited guests and was going to make a feast for them. And so he needed a lamb and and so instead of getting a lamb of his own, he goes to his neighbor's house and gets the only lamb that his neighbor had. And and and so a as he's telling this, Amen. uh uh you of course Nathan was speaking of David's actions and for David had 500 wives Uriah had only one and and so uh uh we we find that as as Nathan is telling this parable uh to David uh David you know he he didn't realize it was about him and and so he thought it was somebody in the kingdom he thought it was a real story and and and David passed the judgment and said, "This man, you know, is going to die and he's going to pay for it four-fold, I believe, and and all of these things." And and and so Nathan told David, he said, "David, thou art the man." &gt;&gt; And David said unto Nathan, he says, "I have sinned against the Lord." And Nathan said unto David, "The Lord also hath put away thy sin. Thou shalt not die." Praise God. &gt;&gt; David passed judgment upon his own life. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; But grace, &gt;&gt; God's grace spared him. &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "See, watch how grace went to work right quick. The spirit struck the prophet and saved David's life." Grace, surely you'll not die, but the sword will not leave your house till it's thoroughly purged your heart, for you are that rich man. &gt;&gt; So, David by grace was saved from his own judgment. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, the grace of God, it it takes grace to hold us together. &gt;&gt; As you know, God would told Israel, you know, he gave them a lot of things. don't commit adultery and and don't don't worship idols and if you won't do this and if you'll do this and all of these things then I will then then then I will be a god unto you. You'll be my people and and I'll do these things. And brother Brown said it's it's like a marriage between a man and a wife. And he's, you know, the the the the man says, "If you'll be a good woman, if you'll take care of the house, if you'll be true to me, if you'll keep my clothes clean, and if we have children, if you'll be a mother to them, if you'll do things uh uh do things that I'll work till my hands bleed to make you a living, if you'll do it." Ain't that right? Brother Brandham says, "But then what if that woman turns wrong and lives lazy, won't work, won't do nothing." He said, "Then it takes grace." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; It takes grace to keep that family together. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; It took the grace of God to keep us together. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; To think the value of grace. A lot of times we take take things for granted. How many times we've griped and how many times we've complained. How many times God has done things and then you know the next trial comes and then we wondering if God's able to bring us out and yet we're still here. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; We're still serving him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And what we don't know, it's grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many times that we've gone without prayer, gone without reading? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; How many times we put our hours into other things? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Praise God. &gt;&gt; But the grace of God has kept us together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The family of God. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; See, so we wouldn't be here if not for God's grace. &gt;&gt; Now, just to to think of this and to let you go, but brother Bram said, God wants somebody that'll obey him. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? God wants somebody that's going to obey him. If it's not in the scriptures, if it's just man-made doctrine, not Bible doctrine. So regardless of what the church is, how wrong you've been, what difference does it make, it's it's how right you can be now. God's grace has showed it to you, then walk in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I thought of this and praise the Lord. I've get you got got more. But I thought of how that we read that scripture where God says, "I'll pour out the spirit of grace on the inhabitants of Jerusalem." We look at Israel and you can look in the Old Testament and see their ups and downs. Look at the book of Judges and how constantly &gt;&gt; God would bring them out of bondage and then they'd go right back into it because of their disobedience. &gt;&gt; And then God would bring them back out and they'd serve God for a little bit, then they'd go right back into it just constantly up and down, up and down. Now, Brother Bram said, you know, now they didn't fully come into the promised land. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Uh but God never forgot Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God never forgot Israel. Their biggest failure was when they rejected Christ. They had him slain. But I thought of that. The only reason why that they crucified him is because God blinded their eyes. for us. &gt;&gt; We had no rights to the covenant. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We We had no hope for mercy. We had nothing. &gt;&gt; But God desired a bride and he promised that he would take a bride out of the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not out of Israel, &gt;&gt; out of the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; So God had to blind that natural people. Yes, he did &gt;&gt; blind them to where he wasn't crucified by the Gentiles. He wasn't crucified by sinners. It was his own people that did it. &gt;&gt; It was Israel that crucified. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; We know the Romans nailed him to the cross or whatever, you know, through the government, but it was Israel that offered him up. &gt;&gt; It was Israel that said, "Crucify him." &gt;&gt; Yeah. We'll take Barabus over him. &gt;&gt; But they did it because they were blinded. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; For our sakes, &gt;&gt; the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For sure. &gt;&gt; Since that rejection, we know that it was not long after the day of Pentecost that Paul would say, "Lo, we turn to the Gentiles." And at that time grace was over for the Jews nation Israel. And Titus come in in some point and destroy Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Bro, tore down every stone. &gt;&gt; Their blood. The history says that blood run in the streets like a river. It it was such a a horrible thing because the grace of God had lifted off of them people down through the years. Um, Israel has been so persecuted. The Jews have been persecuted &gt;&gt; for what they have done. And even you know Martin Luther history tells us Martin Luther thought that the Jews should be killed and because of they were anti and he but he just didn't uh uh understand what what the Jews were. We, my dad, come out of a group of um people that believe that there is no hope for the Jews or at least they used to. Israel is no longer a people. It's over with and because they've rejected Israel or rejected their Messiah. We look today, we look at the Holocaust, we look at all of these things. It was a hatred toward the Jews and and you know, it's still happening. I you know it's amazing that what we're seeing rise up a hatred toward the Jews. Usually the Republicans are are people that that are for the Jews and now you're seeing Republicans rise up and these these commentators and and all this and they're turning against Israel and and they're speaking against Israel. They said, you know, that that the majority of young people, I think under 30 years old has turned against Israel is against Israel and and and and all these things. So, we see what's happening &gt;&gt; and and you know, but God promised &gt;&gt; that he would pour the spirit of grace &gt;&gt; upon Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And and they've been blinded as to who their their their uh Messiah is. that once God gives them that grace, &gt;&gt; the Bible says their eyes will be open and they'll see him &gt;&gt; and they will ask, "Where did you get these scars? What what happened to you?" &gt;&gt; And he says, "I got him in the house of my friends." &gt;&gt; And they will mourn for days. They will lament for days because of what they've done. But I thought, "Oh, what the spirit of grace will do." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and and we see that grace is being lifted off of America and the Gentiles &gt;&gt; to where no one seems to be having a heart of repentance anymore. &gt;&gt; No one seems to have this conviction hardly anymore. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; What is it? It's blinding. But the prophet said it, what Paul says is it's not Christ that's blinding them. It's the God of the world that's blinding them. &gt;&gt; And they have willfully become ignorant. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And and what I'm saying tonight is that that if you having this this this uncction to keep pressing, don't take it for granted. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you got the conviction, if you got a love in your heart, if you got a desire to walk in truth, &gt;&gt; don't don't take that for granted. That's grace. &gt;&gt; That's grace. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If the musicians will come, &gt;&gt; grace, God, by grace, he puts up with us, don't he? &gt;&gt; By grace, he keeps us together. He's holding us. And by grace, there's going to be a rapture. Brother Brandham called it rapturing grace. It's a grace that we don't deserve, but yet God has promised it to us. And I'm so glad for that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said that spirit of grace that he's going to pour out on onto the Jews is the same grace that's been poured out to you and I today upon the Gentiles. Thank God for grace. &gt;&gt; You love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank God. Where would I be? God only knows. [Music] I'm glad to see through the eyes of love. A hopeless case, [Music] an empty space. [Music] If not for grace, amazing grace, [Applause] how sweet the sound. I once was lost, but now I'm found. A hopeless case, an empty place [Music] if not for grace. Oh precious Lord, [Music] please take Do you want him to take your hand? Oh, and lead me on. [Music] And let me stand a hopeless case. [Music] An empty space. If not to think that brother Brandon, he would call grace sovereign. It's sovereign grace. He said in order for it to be sovereign grace, it has to come from one that is sovereign. It be a sovereign one that gives it. And only God is sovereign. Ain't that right? And being that grace is sovereign. You don't have to ask can I do this or shall I do this or can I must I will I doesn't do that. It does it itself. [Music] Grace doesn't have to get permission. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's sovereign. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prophet said, "See, grace is sovereign. Therefore, he can save the vilest. He can save the worst. He can save the impurst. He can save the immoralist, the most downgraded immoral person. Grace can save. He can heal the sickest because grace is sovereign." Oh, aren't you glad for that? That's how I was picked up. That's how I was shown mercy. That's how I'm here today. Because grace is sovereign. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, if not for grace. Oh, amazing grace. [Applause] How sweet the sound. I once was lost, but now I'm found. I was a hopeless case, an empty place if not for grace. There is a fountain filled with blood. [Music] There is a fountain filled with blood drawing from Emmanuel's vein and [Music] beneath [Music] lose all their guilty things. [Music] Lose all their guilty things. Lose all. [Music] Stay. Oh, and sin whose lives beneath the flood lose all their guilty days. The dying thief rejoice to see that fountain in his day. And there may I though vow of the sea wash all my sins away. Oh wash all my sins away. wash all my sins away. [Music] And there may I thous [Music] away. Behold thou dying lamb, thy preious blood shall never lose its power. Aren't you glad for that? Kill all the wrath. Some church of God be saved to sin no more. [Music] Oh, they are saved to sin no more. talking about grace. Our saved to sin no more till all the ransom church of God are safe to sin no more. For since by faith I saw the stream, thy flowing wounds supplied. Redeeming love has been my theme and shall be till. Well, is that your theme tonight? Oh, and shall be till I die. It shall bless the name of the Lord. Oh, redeeming love has been my feet. Oh, it shall be till I die once again. It shall be till I die. [Music] Oh, it shall be until I die. Redeeing love has been my thing and shall be till I die. [Music] Oh, isn't the Lord wonderful? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Can we just stand to our feet? Amen. Amen. Let's just sing this little song as we get ready to close. I want to thank you, Lord, for saving my soul. Just to that little chorus. I want to thank you, Lord, for saving my soul. Thank you Lord for making me holy. Yes. Thank you Lord for giving to me thy great salvation so and free. Now as they just place softly let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer. We want to remember as was said, brother Jonathan, [Music] brother Zachary, they're in a I guess a country that is Muslim, mostly Muslim. So right now it's a scary time and um but they're there to help a small church in that area. And so we really want to keep them in our prayer that God will just really protect them, guide them, bring them home safely to us and that he would help them to be able to help the people there and that nation. Amen. Remember those that maybe are sick or uh wasn't able to make it this evening. Amen. Father, you have been so good to us, Lord. We have tasted of the Lord and we can truly say he is good. [Music] We're thankful for your grace that you have shed upon our lives. you poured upon us.
