that I am free to express that love to him and we couldn't Express that except he loved us first that's what the Bible says we love him because he loved us he first loved us and once we understand that love and it just calls for a response of love back and I'm glad that there's that response that we can give that response Amen in our heart and uh it becomes a love affair a relationship with our Lord and not just a mechanical thing but a true true love and I'm so glad for that we see God just does so much for us not just saving us from our sins but just all through life he he keeps us he protects us and guides us and we just have so much to thank the Lord for and um there's so many things maybe that I am not even aware of what God does for me but I certainly want to be conscience of what he has done and certainly to thank him for all of his love amen and uh we uh just just glad to be here and uh darl it's good to have you amen good to to see you back again and and um we uh uh just want to continue praying for for Daryl and the Lord will just uh really bless him amen and um uh I want to just thank the Lord for uh keeping his hand on Judah and uh we've been doing a lot of

the Lord man love him with such a a deep deep love and an understanding that God loved us first and that is the only reason that we can love him back is because he has expressed his love to us and he's redeemed us he's cleansed us from all of our sins and unrighteousness just freed us from all condemnation and uh such a a liberty to love God and enter into uh just a a marriage uh with our lord Jesus and uh it's so good to be in the house of the Lord and we say God richly bless you and uh we love and appreciate uh all of you and uh it is just always a uh just a good time when we can uh come here and uh and just uh be able to minister the word to you and uh you've just always had a special place in our hearts and uh we just uh love brother Shawn and sister Heather very much and as brother Shawn was saying it's uh it goes beyond just uh natural blood but uh just a real uh just a real God Godly love uh uh between us as as uh there is between all the uh children of God and and uh just know that this is only the uh the Prelude to spending eternity with one another and and uh we'll be able to just uh just put a put put our Sword Down uh one of these days and uh be able to just uh Fellowship around all of the testimonies and all the victories that God has brought in our lives and and uh we're we're in a great age of Victory and I believe that we're we're not just going to barely get by but we're we're actually uh we're actually Overcomers in this age and and uh I believe that there's something within us that is just uh uh just requiring that we press the battle and keep pressing and and uh keep keep overcoming and and uh we just want to uh just uh we'll just go ahead and turn into uh our Bibles at this time we appreciate all the songs and uh you can just turn to Matthew 17 and uh beginning at verse 10 and then acts the 3r chapter verse 19 and uh Psalms 63 beginning at verse 1 and uh you may have heard that we are in a uh the last couple of months we we've been in a uh little bit of a transition and uh we uh just felt the Lord changing the direction uh in our in our ministry and uh in our family and so we're now attending there at uh uh true word Tabernacle and uh brother Wayne who is uh no stranger to this church but uh uh is now uh my pastor and so we just want to uh bring greetings from from uh brother Wayne to the church as well and and uh so uh we just have something that uh seemed like the Lord just woke us up in the middle of the night and just begin to deal with us on on this uh subject and uh we just uh pray that God can uh just minister to us uh we just want to Matthew 17 and beginning at verse 10 and we'll read to the 11th verse and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias must first come and Jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things aren't you glad that you have an understanding of what you're reading and that you we are living in the restitution of all things now acts the thir chapter verse 19 repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord and He Shall send Jesus Christ which before was preached unto you whom the Heaven Must receive until the times of restitution of all things which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world begin so all the prophets have been speaking of the very age that we're living in but God has chose you and I to live in this age and to partake of this age everything that God has promised in this age and I believe that God has promised in the season and the times of restitution of all things he's also promised a times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord and uh I'd like to minister on the times of refreshing now if we could just one more scripture there in Psalms 63 and we'll be we'll just read the first three verses oh God God Thou Art my God early will I seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh longth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is to see thy power and thy Glory so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary because thy loving kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee and may God just add his Blessing to the reading of the word and you can have your seats but again we'll just Minister on times of refreshing and you know the the prophet would tell us that Jesus always goes where he is invited no matter where it's at he will come and uh we can see that he come to aian in one time and and then another time he went to the fiery furnace and it was David that wrote that if I make my bed in hell he will be there and he will come to the poorest he will come to the richest and uh even to the most immoral to the meanest to the lowest he will come anywhere he is invited no matter what your conditions and what uh position in life is he will still come isn't that a tremendous promise that the Lord Jesus keeps all of his appointments and he will not come in an imaginary way but he comes in reality and he comes in such a personal visitation uh to bring a positive effect in each of our lives and uh we believe that his presence brings change uh his presence brings life it brings restoration just one time in his presence can uh change the most immoralist can change the most worst of conditions and it's because it's the presence of almighty God and there is something about the presence of God that there is nothing there is nothing that the devil can do uh that can hold back the presence of God that can defy the presence of God that can keep the presence of God God from working in the heart of a Believer and to that can work in in in the elect uh and that predestinated heart and when we come into His presence we're changed I think that is a powerful thing uh the prophet in his presence would just go through these things in the sermon in his presence when we come into His presence were changed never to be the same I think of how the the prophet in the presence of God unrecognized he says oh the greatest pleasure I know of is to pray until I can realize that I'm in the presence of God and recognize it I think that ought to be the thrill of the church is the presence of the Holy Spirit seeing the god that made the promise standing among us feel his presence and see his word and see it Vindicated it ought to give Faith to make cripples walk blind see deaf hear the dumb speak and I I think of how that uh the presence of God when we see the word made manifest see the word Vindicated that is the manifestation of God's presence and to be able to recognize his presence and it it's a it's when you recognize his presence that is when there is a power that is released to the believer that God can move supernaturally in your heart and in your home and in any condition any circumstance and that God can just pour out his Spirit but first you've got to recognize his presence and so when you see that God what God is doing in this hour and then recognize it that is not for another day it's not for the future but it is actually the presence of God that is being made known among us today then it is the power that the believer has been waiting for to see God manifested in every heart and every life and and in our homes and you see it is uh that it is that place it is it is not the outer court or the holy place place we but we we're talking about the the Tabernacle of witness in the in the wilderness and how that there was uh three parts to that Tabernacle there was the outer courts which was uh subject to the weather and and the sun could be shining but then the clouds would roll in and it would block out that sunshine and then there was the Holy place which was the seven you know the seven candlesticks it was a man-made light and that had to there had to be the oil that was put into that to keep it burning but sometimes it got smoked up and and uh but then there was the holiest of holies and that was a place where uh Aaron was elected Aaron being a type of the believer elected and chosen called to go into the secret place of the most high to go beyond that that Veil amen break through break break in beyond that veil of of humanity and reasoning and unbelief and once get into that place then there was that Halo of Light which was the shik of glory and it was in that presence amen where Aron's Rod which was dead budded and brought forth fruit and and and it was in that place where uh the shoe bread which got stale in the outer cord where it got stale and stagnated and got Wiggle Worms to it amen but in the holiest of holies the shoe bread never got stale never got you know amen it was fresh from generation to generation the believer it didn't matter amen if it was your if it was your grand mother your grandpa or if it was this day amen you had a right every generation had a right to have have a part of that original Mana that is even the ministry the prophet of God would say the ministry has a right to eat of that original bread of life and and preach from that original bread of life preach from the tree of life amen which would bring forth the presence of God into the church you see it is the holy spirit that is the refreshing from the presence of God that was what is prophesied in Jew 2 amen that he would pour out his Spirit upon all F All Flesh and this is the rest where you cease from all of your labors and all of your works and and it's a it's it's a refreshing unto the heart of the believer to be brought into the secret place of the most high God where the world knows nothing about it but you're elected to that place amen where God bring pours out a refreshing of the Holy Ghost and brings forth life and and brings forth the buding of the Fruit of the Spirit into your heart I tell you the prophet would say that you are a nature he would say look at the budding as I was driving in uh we're we're we're not there in Ohio we're not where you are yet amen we still got some cold weather and things and and uh but just driving into this area I started seeing the buds on the trees and and I I just begin to think amen yeah it's it's that time of year it's springtime amen it's a it's an Easter season and the prophet would say look at it the budding what makes trees bud it's a refreshment what makes the refreshing early of a morning you go out of the early morning and you find out after the night and everything gets still and then the de Falls and it brings a refreshening the trouble of it is today the people don't have time to get before God and get still they got so many things to do they belong to this they got to do this they got to have this they got to go there you don't have time the Devils just took up all of your time you don't have time to get still before God get Qui get quiet remember you're a nature and after all nature gets quiet and still then the dues Begin to Fall that refreshes and brings forth life and you are in nature yourself and when you get quiet and still before God and the do of Heavens begin to fall and begins to refresh that's what you need to do is get away and get quiet before God so he can bathe you with the refreshment from Heaven amen isn't that a tremendous thing get quiet before God so he can bathe you with the refreshment from from Heaven amen the prophet again would say let a man be out fussing fighting stewing and you'll never get much of Aroma from that of the Gospel but let him get alone one time the Stillness of God every man that comes to the pull pit ought to dwell alone first then comes the fruits yielding forth its fruit every man that stays in the presence of God into this great secret place hid away will yield the fruits of righteousness peace love joy longsuffering goodness gentleness patience don't fuss about these other things get that in your life and you'll never get it until you hide away with God into that land of adoption you see the prophet of God would uh there one of the last sermons he would preach at the end of his ministry and he in the sermon what house would will you build me he would say that I know that each one of you if you feel like I do I am so hungry to see the spirit of God moving there he was in I believe Tucson amen where he was preaching this tucon or Phoenix and and he's and he's there in the desert where it's a dry Place amen the desert where it's lacking moisture and everything is just H Cactus and it's got a sticker on on it and the prophet of God would say what what makes that sticker is because it's a leaf that is rolled up so tight it's because it's lacking moisture amen and there he is amen the condition the the condition of the natural is also symbolizing the condition of the church where where he's at and it's and it and it's lacking uh a real moisture of a real Holy Ghost Christian experience and and and the condition is cold and formal and the traditions of the elders and the prophet of God would say I am so hungry to see the spirit of God moving I'm so hungry for some moisture to come into the church amen where it where the the amen where those stickers amen would roll out and bring forth the beautiful leaves of the tree of life blossoming in the individual he would say I begin to feel us all reclining getting away from the spirit it's become too natural a thing to us we must Worship in the spirit and not only are message should be the flame of the hour it should be the flame in our hearts can I read that again not only our message should be the flame of the hour it should be the flame in our Hearts it's got to be in our hearts or we can't rightly present it to the people the spirit has to pack the message itself and I'm trusting and believing in every one of you to be a real Christian I tell you friends amen the spirit has to pack the message amen because Jesus is looking for those who will worship in spirit and in truth amen we find that the word is a seed and the word has the potential as a seed to go into a heart and bring forth its full potential every seed will bring forth of its kind amen and everything that God promised in the Bible is laying there in seed form but all it is needing amen is a little bit of moisture Hallelujah a little bit of the falling of the rain amen moisture of the Holy Ghost to fall upon the heart uh God promised that he would do it uh God placed these promises in his word uh there's nothing wrong with the promise there's nothing wrong with the message uh and there's nothing wrong uh with God's forn knowledge uh that he predestinated you uh unto the adoption of children uh oh yes sir there's nothing wrong with God but he promised in this hour that he would send forth the times of refreshing H there would be an appointed time uh when he P when he opened the word uh when he's restored us back to everything that Adam lost to the Garden uh when he's restored us back to Divine Fellowship restored us back to the Tree of Life uh restored us back uh Amen to our place in life uh he would promise that he would pour out his holy spirit and it would be times of refreshing uh it would just be waves upon waves of the outpouring of the Holy Ghost to make this word live H hallelujah it's got to have moisture you see the prophet would say that this is the principle of a Revival of people who are flex flexible not to an intellectual talk but to the coming of the holy spirit in the form of a baptism that gives way to the word of God and rejoicing and is flexible in the anointing of the spirit you remember how the prophet said that he was up there in British Columbia amen and and he kind of got lost and how that he came over to a man come over to a a place in the wilderness where there had been a where there had been a force fire amen the prophet said that he came to that place and he felt the holy Spirit stop him and he says he's looking out over these trees that had been burnt over and he says he heard this awful awful morning and he thought my what is that that is an awful a this is an awful Place why did the Holy Spirit bring me here he says you know he says it was the wind blowing and and it was blowing through those trees and it was the most making the most mournful deathful sounds and he says I could just hear it it's like the church saying the days of Miracles has passed God don't do those things today amen Jesus Christ isn't the same yesterday today and forever and he's but there's the prophet thinking my why am I here he says but I felt the Holy Spirit leading me over he says I just remove some of the brush and some of the burnoff and I look he says there is some fresh amen there is some fresh life amen there is some fresh growth coming up through that he said that's it I will restore sayth the Lord uh amen when you've got those churches so dead in Traditions and and the doctrines and and fighting and fussing and feuding and they won't let the Holy Ghost begin to blow upon the church and and it won't allow the Revival that God has ordained for this hour to blow through the church but God has got some fresh amen some fresh life some fresh Sons and Daughters uh that have been ordained for this end time Revival been ordained to receive uh the refreshing uh from the presence of almighty God uh and through them uh he will restore all things uh and he will user in uh the Mery supper of the Lamb uh he will Usher in the Millennium uh he will usher in eternity through an eternal Gene that's been ordained uh for these Seasons uh this appointed time uh of the refreshing uh from the presence of God you see you got to get in the spirit to get anything from God Amen if you're going to if you're going to pray you got to pray in the spirit amen if you're going to sing you

overcome in the spirit uh if you're going to raise above lay out a sea of gross Darkness you got to get in the spirit uh if you're going to receive uh Revelation uh the prevailing Revelation you got to get in the spirit you're never going to get it through an intellectual Revival Hallelujah you see you got to get into a spiritual atmosphere because it's atmosphere that brings the results so you got to get in the spirit of it amen the church is in the spirit of the end time they're in the spirit of oncoming judgment they're in the spirit amen of the Lord's day amen when God is going to pour out his wrath amen we're and and he is going to make the wicked just ashes upon the Earth but at the same time of gross Darkness there is an atmosphere of rapture there is an atmosphere of Life there is an atmosphere of expectation there is an at atmosphere amen of the quickening power that is making us Flex our wings uh and raise higher into the atmosphere of the supernatural above unbelief above amen the Spheres that has tried to push us down and look at our reasoning and reason out this problem and reason out that problem I say we're astronauts we've been caught up into the heavenlies and we're looking down upon that reasoning spirit that held us Earthbound and we're caught up into the supernatural reals of the Holy Ghost where God just keeps refreshing us uh and refreshing us uh and we get a little tired and the Holy Ghost refreshes us uh we get a little hurt and the Holy Ghost refreshes us uh we get a little bit bow over with the cares of life and the Holy Ghost comes and refreshes us uh it's the restitution of all things and God ain't going to allow this bride to die in some lay out of see a lukewarm Spirit he promised to refresh us he will not allow his church to become dead dried up and bitter he will refresh us if you're going to get in the atmosphere now if you're going to go to the dance you got to get in the atmosphere for the dance a't that right amen the prophet of God says that if you're going to the dance and you're over there with your arms crossed just leaning against the wall your wall flower Hallelujah people's going to look at you they're going to criticize you they're going to say just get on out of here we're trying to have a good time we're going to have a we're we're trying to you're ruining the atmosphere why don't you just go on home iel if you don't want to be here go on home why you're ruining the atmosphere but if you're going to the dance you got to get you got to get in the spirit of the dance to have a jubilee time

touchdown and you say whoopee amen I what's the meaning of that but you're in the spirit of the game amen you're my goodness people will have their sodas flying everywhere they got their chips flying everywhere they're all jumping up and down and High fiveing someone they don't even know what about the Sons and Daughters of God who have an understanding that their name is written on the Lamb's Book of Life and they were rejoicing and shouting around the Throne of God and now we are highing now we are rejoicing now we can have handshakes of Brotherly Love uh because we have an understanding uh that we are overcoming in an age of gross darkness and we're going to spend eternity with one another to God it's an atmosphere it's an atmosphere of understanding that the devil's trying to do everything in his power to bring hurts the devil's doing everything in his power to separate Brotherhood amen doing everything in his power but I tell you you can't separate the gene seed of God we are the body of Christ uh we are the action of God in this houren that's what he promised that's why he promised to pour out his spirit and God is that spirit and he is love and it's love that has come to bring this body together seal this body together under the headship of the Vindicated message of the hour God himself you see we're in an atmosphere of believing Hallelujah can I can I go ahead and express what I what I believe is very simple but I believe the devil don't have enough do you realize that Amen to some I'm old and to some I'm young I'm 42 years old but I'll just say this I've been around long enough to be able to say this the devil don't have enough I've seen the devil try amen to drag people off into worldliness off the cares of Life uh Amen to Amen to make them dead cold lukewarm uh amen I seen the devil do it I seen it look like he was going to have his way but then all the sudden a time of refreshing uh blew through the church uh and God revived him and God brought him back I tell you friends the devil don't have enough there's nothing that can separate seate this bride from the love of God for God's love is elect of Love devil don't have enough I've seen the devil try to take out those amen afflict them with cancer afflict them with hurts afflict them with all kinds of manners of of sickness body spirit amen even if try to afflict their soul amen but I tell you friends amen every time it backfired it's because uh all you've got to do is call upon the name of the Lord invite his presence and though you make your bed in hell but he is there hallelujah it's because he goes wherever he is invited it takes the spirit of God to bring life and that life must not come out of just intellectual Revival it's got to come out of the Bible word Revival Hallelujah do you realize the word Revival amen that is for this day Malachi 4 I will restore I'm going to turn your heart back to the original faith and you your faith that faith that has been birthed in Your Heart by that six sense is going to operate the supernatural you're going to do the very thing amen that Peter and Paul and those disciples did I tell you quit putting it off for another day I tell you this church is manifesting another book of Acts amen I tell you people the devil gets so people get so uh so disillusion amen of what it was really like in that first church I tell you they had problems just like you had problems they had trials just like you have trials they had the devil plaguing their minds and trying to give them to turn back upon God just like you've got that that Lucifer amen whispering in your ear but I tell you friends they weren't on the Mountaintop all the time they had plenty of valleys they had plenty of Despair but that didn't stop the life I tell you friends quit allowing the Devil to say we don't have it and why don't we get in the atmosphere of a word Revival this day Malachi for is fulfilled this day Luke 177 is fulfilled this day Revelations 5 Revelations 10 it is fulfilled we're in the atmosphere of that word Revival wonderful it'll bring life you see once you find that power once that predestinated seed in you is awakened and that's what the seven Thunder Revival is all about the opening of the word that has awakened the gene seed of God to the realities of what he promised in this age I tell you our type is Rebecca she may not have understood it she couldn't explain it but all she knew there was a deep calling into the deep let the damel decide Hallelujah maybe they thought that her decision would be there's no way I'm following this message there's no way I'm going to believe that this man is going to take me into another world another country and I'm going to be married to a man that I know nothing about that's what they thought but there was something in Rebecca that said I have decided to follow this man I tell you friends amen it's good to have an understanding of who elaser is in this age and that the camel that was provided her was the very power that was taking her to Isaac I tell you friends she watered that Camel she watered that power amen she get I tell you friends uh this this message uh the power of the Holy Ghost is taking us to Isaac it's a sweep that is moving over this end time Pride uh that is transforming uh a people that has been born again of the Holy Ghost and we are being transformed from glory to glory where's it coming from We're watering this camel we're watering it how are we watering it with praise Thanksgiving Hallelujah shoutings an understanding of what it's about you see this ain't some intellectual talk but this is this is the church laying in the presence of almighty God to Tender up do you realize that it's in that Harvest Time when that grain comes to its maturity Hallelujah that is the Sun that tenders it up it doesn't get hard and callous and oh no no the sun tenders it up and I tell you friends that's what the Holy Ghost the presence of almighty God we've been laying in the presence of this message and I tell you what it's doing it's tendering us up it's not making making us callous it's not making us hard it's not making us critical but it's something that is tendering our hearts before his presence I tell you you can't look at one another the same when you're in his presence you cannot be in the ripening presence of the so the message of the hour and stay hard critical and callous I tell you friends I'm a witness of it Hallelujah that's why every believer the middle wall of partition has been torn down between the seven Church ages and the holiest of holies amen that's why the prophet stood in the breach and said you've got to come on over into the revealing of the son of man it's because this is where you're going to get ripe this is where you're going to get tender this is where the spirits are going to fall off of you this is where you're not going to be controlled by the smoke of man-made Creed Dogma Traditions the religions of man you've got to come into the [Music] presence you see the mechanics don't run the church it's the Dynamics the Holy Ghost that's that gets in this word it's the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost in there to set that a fire you see the prophet of God would say it's not what Seminary teaches you all the Theology and the Greek interpretations but it's the holy ghost that sets the word on fire that's right amen hallelujah now you see John had to get caught up in the spirit on the Lord's day now now if you're not in the spirit then I tell you the Lord's Day can look like like a terrible thing you see when you're not in the spirit you can look at the natural and all you see is the Prelude of tribulation you see the you see the pale horse rider already begin to ride death beginning to ride spiritual deaths gross Darkness Hallelujah but you see it's Revelations the fourth chapter where John heard the same voice that was in re Galatians 1 and he was saying John come up higher he saw that there was an open door and that door is Christ the word the word now is open and John a type of the Bride is coming out of the gross Darkness out of leosia condition out of lukewarmness and coming into an eighth age an eighth day of a bride Agee where there's life where the presence of God is remember he was kicked out of that LE out of see of Pentecostal age but the bride has been called out of that age into this age where she can be in the presence of God praise the Lord not just a man-made Revival now it's not your pastor working you up into a Revival hallelujah it's not your pastor amen it's not relying upon a pastor it's not relying Upon A five-fold Min the five-fold ministry is only preaching the open book but the bride is walking through iten Hallelujah the bride by faith is taking the word and walking into that into the presence of almighty God where all things are possible you see John now John a type of the Bride there in there in Ephesians the first chapter Paul would say that I I pray now I've heard of your faith but I I pray that the spirit of wisdom and Revelation would Open the Eyes of your understanding that you can catch the knowledge of Jesus Christ that you can understand the hope of your calling I tell you the hope of your calling is you've been called out of Le oosa and why have you been called out to come into a marriage and every time that you hear this message and you're saying Amen to this message do you realize you're coming you have come into an invisible Union you have come into the marriage do you realize that this is your season this is your hour in the times of the refreshing of the presence of God in the times of the restitution of all things it's your time to rejoice it's not your time to get lost in the cares of life it's your time to Rejoice it's King lamb worship time it's because you've come back to the Tree of Life come back to Divine Fellowship come back to eternal life this is beyond the Theologian this is beyond the intellectual this is on up into the realm of the Lord's thing King this is not man's man's intelligence this is the intelligence of God amen amen the intelligence of God that's why Jesus said in John 14 is this okay St John the 14th chapter when he the person of the Holy Ghost is come not just a shout not just a baptism not just speaking in tongues not just the rest of restoration of the gifts but when he the person of the Holy Ghost comes what he going to do he's going to lead you into all truth the prophet of God in the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom of the Earthly bride says show you what day you're living in that's what the Holy Ghost is doing now when he comes he's going to show you what day you're living in and then another thing you'll know him by he'll show you things to come right back to the prophetic again when he's come I tell you that's perfectly Revelations the 10th chapter that the mighty Angel which is the Covenant Angel he's got a rainbow over his head the mighty Angel is the Covenant Angel which is Christ which is aen first th is it first Thessalonians the fourth chapter the Lord himself shall descend with a shout the message that is bring Gathering the bride calling the bride out of dark denominationalism into the resurrection of the word in flesh which makes you the voice of the Resurrection written Epistles manifesting the word now that is the Lord himself shall descend what's he descending with he's descending with a title deed he's descending with an open book and Paul said that the Lord him is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty because the veil is taken off of the human heart and they see it and they're walking in the prophetic vision of the Holy Ghost for the church you'll be caught up in the Lord's day you're going to be caught up you're going to be caught up when the Lord himself descends with the vision for the church and God is going to show you your future I tell you friends amen there's there's there's so much grumbling and and dejected people is because they're not looking got the vision but I pray the eyes of your understanding would be open that you can catch the vision the opening of the word is prophetic of your future not defeat not Leon AIA not Doom and Gloom not a world falling apart but you're a part of another civilization a super race I called our people for his name's sake a people being refreshed by his presence you see what is his presence to do is to anoint your faith intellectually Moses heard it he heard at all of his life who he was he heard that he was to be the deliverer he heard that he was the bride he heard that he was the final voice to the final age he heard of the bride's Revival you know what I'm saying now and Moses under that intellectual Revival killed one Egyptian and then he had to run for his life you see intellectually he said I'm the deliverer I guess I'll go ahead and start right now but under that intellectual thing he didn't have the secret he wasn't living under the atmosphere yet you say well brother Jonathan how do you know he wasn't in the atmosphere because 40 years later under the right atmosphere he stood before pharaoh and said let my people go knowing that just one of those Spears could take his life just one of those swords could take his head off but he was living under the right atmosphere of an exodus I tell you friends you say well H how do I get in that kind of an atmosphere well the prophet of God would say that what Moses needed was his faith anointed he had he had the mechanics he knew the message he knew the quotes he knew what he was supposed to be doing but now he needed what the presence of the Lord amen had for his life I tell you that burning bush had what Moses lacked and that was the anointing to make his faith live amen prise the Lord praise the name of the Lord amen you see Moses was on the back side of the desert dried up forgot the vision probably even carnal thinking that he was just no good worthless and then he was on the back side of the desert with a wife that was whooping him into shape because she had a temper and the prophet of God would say God knew exactly what he was doing when he put Moses who was a hotthead himself and put her with Zapora which was a hot head and she was whipping him into shape don't tell me God doesn't know what he's doing in our lives God tell don't tell me the footsteps of the righteous are not ordered of the lord it's too late I already see it I'm a witness of it I know God knows what he's [Music] doing Moses take off your shoes the prophet of God said he had heard that before Moses what are you doing in this tent with your shoes on well anyways you see he was coming into the presence of almighty God and he had to get right he had to come into sincerity he had humility he he had to he had to get his old stinky smelly thinking off of him that's right he wasn't going to Walk This Way any longer Hallelujah he wasn't going to walk this way he wasn't going to talk that way any longer I tell you why because he was coming into the pray he had an appointment with the mighty Angel yes amen and notice every excuse that Moses had well I I stutter well I can't do this well I can't do that well I'm no good well I'm a failure well every one of those excuses in the presence of almighty God was just disol disol in other words you can't talk yourself out of this people you can't talk yourself out of the Rapture brother and sister you cannot talk yourself out of the Great Commission that you can that only you can fulfill the Pentecostal church is dead they're lifeless they're dried up I don't care how much shout I don't care how much dancing I don't care how good of Music they've got they're dead they're lifeless the seed has moved into the grain the Bride of Jesus Christ and only this Bride Can fulfill the great commit mission do you realize momies and daddies you are the fulfillers of the Great Commission that the prayer faith shall save the sick they shall cast out Devils they shall take up deadly things that shall not harm you're the Fulfillment of that that's right no one else has the faith to make that work no one else can fulfill Malachi 4 Luke 17 Revelations 10 all of these bride scriptures none of them can fulfill Greater Works than these shall you do for I go into my father outside of the Bride that has been anointed by the pillar of fire to fulfill the vision of the open word you see Jacob had to come to a point in his life oh he had he had had Visions he had seen the Angels ascending and descending upon that ladder he had heard God speak to him but he come to a point his life that he said I've got to come into the presence of God I I've got I've got to have his presence I tell you God is so good God's so gracious because it was God that put that desire in Jacob Jacob had that desire all the whole time the whole time that he was running the whole time that he was working for his for his wife seven years once seven years again the whole time and now he's returning back into his rightful land amen and there is Esau going to kill him and all of that guilt all of that condemnation comes back up into his heart and God says this is an appointed time and God descends and God steps right in Jacob's way and oh the grace of God that Jacob that shyer that that oh that's but a Shyer but a Son of God now amen that he recognized the presence of almighty God and he be to wrestle with that angel and he wrestled and he wrestled and he wrestled and it was at the dawning or the rising of the Sun that his name was changed from Jacob subanner to Israel a prince with God because he wrestled with God and overcome I tell you friends again the devil don't have enough Jacob wrestled with the angel amen his life was changed his walk was changed it was at the rising of the son that the power of almighty God was released in his life and he never was the same oh the presence of God is the bride's Revival wrestling with the word wrestling with the promise God you promised it God you said so God I am your Royal seed I am a believer God you said you would bring times of refreshing God you said amen that my that I would not be withered H you promised uh that you have plant me in the rivers uh of Living Water I hold you to your promise oh God refresh me amen all right I think of when the prophet of God said that he went to Durban South Africa and there's two 100 I believe he said 200,000 people at the Durban racetrack he said oh he said the he said all they seen was one time the sign of the Messiah and they believed amen one sign now let's let's notice the condition that these people were in just a week before the prophet of God says a week before that they were in war with one another we're talking about tribes heathens yes sir we're not talking about Christians we're talking about heathens they've got their Spears they got their clubs they they they're at war with one another they're ha they hate they're wanting to kill one another and for all we know maybe they did maybe they were killing one another it maybe it gotten that far but just recognizing they were in the presence of almighty God they dropped everything in that kind of an atmosphere of love all the sudden the cripples begin to walk the blame begin to walk the the blind begin to see the ears begin to be unstopped all because they seen the word made manifest amen oh how Satan wants to Blind us to the reality of his word made manifest in this hour and just make us cold and lukewarm and just the message of tradition that's something that we just keep doing over and over and over come to church go home come to church go home do this do that and all the while the is trying to Blind our eyes through the vision of the son of man working in human flesh not your just your pastor yes your pastor but not just your pastor not just the five-fold ministry but the word being revealed in written Epistles praise the lord lord wonderful a week before they were in war with one another native war and there they was the prophet of God says the mayor of the city called brother brandham says look out your window and he says I believe it was seven it was seven truckloads van loads truckloads amen of wheelchairs stretchers crutches and the people who were at war with one another are walking arm in arm before a prophet a Vindicated prophet and they're singing only believe all things are possible do you want to know how we're going to make it do you want to know how we're going to be free our Spirits are going to be loosed there's nothing going to be in our Spirits reasoning and memory and hurts and bitterness and confusion and darkness do you want to know it's going to be the presence of God it's going to PE be a people that is recognizing that this word has been made manifest for me to keep my spirit pure that I can discern between right and wrong discern what the devil's trying to do discern situations discern why you discern the devil and his tactics then throw yourself into the presence of almighty God and see the devil defeated every single time every single time every single time there is no spirit that can stand before the presence of God in your life I don't care if it's I don't care if it's confusion I don't care if it's hurt I don't care if it's sickness it can't stand in the presence of almighty [Music] God why were they doing that arm in arm hand in hand why they recognize the god of Heaven had appeared before them in the form of his word the prophet of God would say in Jehovah Gyra part one remember the last thing is his divine presence the word itself he is the the word the head the word it's coming to the body don't you feel it friends I'm not talking about an imaginary thing don't you feel the coming of his presence hasn't it descended so close that it's actually there's been a ceiling there's a connection amen there's a connection we're a part of it we're living in the presence of almighty God every day of our life we're living in the presence of God don't you know that the presence of God knows what you're thinking don't you know the presence of God the word himself knows those feelings that we entertain oh don't you know that that pricking of the Holy Ghost H that is trying to wash us wash our spirit wash our mind to keep a bride pure for the Rapture don't you know that is that connection to the headship of his presence Glory praise the Lord don't you realize the holy spirit is the messiah that Christ and the Holy Spirit is the same thing don't you realize amen that the message that we're playing is not just a mechanics don't you realize it's the Dynamics it's the rising of the sun it is our opportunity to re to to have Deliverance to have joy restored to be refilled by the Holy Ghost amen don't you realize it is the opportunity every time you're in your truck and the presence of God comes down so close don't you realize that is not just a halfhazard thing that is a connection between you and headship that has taken you back to the Garden of Eden praise the Lord don't you realize that the headship the word of his presence is leading us back to a perfect Eden don't despise the day of small things don't despise that still small voice of the Vindicated word as he talks to your heart don't despise it it's the it's the presence of God that can bring mountains low and Valleys High and can lead you into your body change Deuteronomy 32 and2 says my Doctrine shall drop as the rain Doctrine is not to make us starchy but the doctrine is the restored word that is falling like the former the latter rain upon the church Hallelujah the teaching Reign and the anointing of the Holy Ghost which is rapturing Faith praise the name of the Lord my Doctrine shall drop as the rain my speech shall distill as the Dew oh don't you remember you're a nature now don't you remember you got to get quiet in the dawning and the rising of the sun quiet amen It's At That season it's that times that God has ordained to refresh nature hallelujah we're in the season of Easter I don't have time to go into all these things you know it though we're in the season of Easter it's the season of not the reform not the carriers but it's the season of restitution of the word in briad form and it's in that season that God has ordained times of Revival where God restores the breath into our lungs and we live we breathe the life of God within us I tell you friends not a dead Church a Living Church Church in this Easter time Hallelujah when you see those buds Hallelujah what's making those buds come is because there's an intelligence Hallelujah there's an intelligence that that told that life go down to the roots but now there's an intelligence that's saying it's Easter come on now come on up it's time that it's time to live it's time to breathe what's God doing to that tree he's breathing inspiration into it all of the sudden the the the life begins to come and that old limb that was all dried because of cold winter and you can just snap it now it's got some Flex to it what is it it's a Revival it's a refreshing it's God restoring nature in the times of refreshing where the presence where the life

quiet get our Spirits quiet it's when it's when Elijah heard the Thunder he knew that God wasn't in that Thunder it was in the earthquake God wasn't in that earthquake those were manifestations but it wasn't where God was but he Qui himself to hear that still Small Voice what's the still small voice today it's the Vindicated word which is declaring his presence isn't here that's right let me just go ahead and bring it on down his presence is in you oh yes sir the doctrine falling like rain distill as the Dew oh you wake up you're if it's not now you're not seeing it yet you'll see it you'll go

memories you don't have to be crushed by anxiety and nervous Spirits you're not of that world you're of a new world a world that is pouring out Angels pouring out Supernatural blessings pouring out the Holy Ghost in wave and wave and waves of Supernatural blessings upon the Church of the Living God the rockness never left Israel don't you realize the ne the rock that smitten Rock never left Israel calvary's just as real as it always has been healing is still flowing out of his bloody side Holy Ghost blessings are being poured out from his side uh hallelujah it's never left the church uh this message has never lost its power but it's us who get carnal it's us the devil amen tries to separate us uh I tell you friends uh come back uh to divine presence uh come back uh to what God has birthed you under come back to the supernatural outpouring of the Holy Ghost where there's healing Deliverance encouragement a wealth of His blessings thank you Jesus amen I'm closed in I want to get to this though don't you realize that it's in that season of restoration that restore means to return to the former owner or bring back to former estate of condition don't you realize that what Jesus died for on Calvary and he's been interceding upon the church for seven Church ages but John looked and he wept because that book which was a book of redemption which held our names had been sealed up with Seven Seals and no one was worthy to look upon it this was after Calvary friends but this is the work of redemption now Jesus died to redeem as the kinsman redeemer but then the lamb had to come out of Eternity step in on the scene and take the book of redemption what is it it's Redemption claims everything that Adam had Redemptive rights but he lost his rights but now the lamb has come into full view did you hear me friends he's come into full view we're not guessing at this we're not trying to First search to find his presence the word has unveiled him he's come into Plain View for what Redemption claims and what is redemption it's restoration of all that has been lost everything Satan put a lean on your life but the de but God took us back to the mind of God and says Satan you don't have a right to put a lean on them I claimed them before you ever got to him that book of redemption that Adam had that title deed that Adam had in the garden he you would have came forth as spoken word children your name was written in that Lamb's Book of Life amen but you see when sat and doubt ien but when when Eve for doubted amen she forfeited her right to the Tree of Life Adam believed it forfeited his right to the Tree of Life forfeited Fellowship forfeited eternal life uh but I'll tell you friends uh amen amen that book The Devil Couldn't get his hands upon it those greasy hands of the devil had no right upon that Lamb's Book of Life uh it went back into the hands of the original owner which was God himself uh but in this day in the restoration of all things uh where he's going to bring forth every name that is written in that Lamb's Book of Life everything the devil tried to put on your life was nothing but a hoax it's nothing but a lie it's nothing but a bluff you were already in the Mind Of God eternally sealed until the day of redemption I tell you Friends when the lamb took the book it was from the hand of the original owner the father but when Jesus stepped in the scene and said I am the kinsman redeemer I am worthy to take the book and to loose the seals thereof what he did he do it's Redemption claims now we have the book that's right and we've got a right to go to that old squatter the devil and say give me back my joy give me back my peace give me back my family give me back my sons and daughters why it's Redemption claims that's why the Holy Ghost is refreshing you as you're in a battle and when you get into that battle you need refreshing you need a fresh drink I tell you friends I tell you that's why God's God's in a great battle he's been in a great battle he prevailed the lamb prevailed to give us this book and now he is thirsty for a fresh drink of Pentecostal water and the prophet of God said who will take your sword and cut through those demonic powers to give my Lord a fresh drink of that Holy Ghost water I tell you friends H let's take our swords it's a time of refreshing it's a time of the outpouring of the Holy Ghost it's a time where the presence of God is sweeping over Hearts families homes situations to bring healing Deliverance Victory it's restoration time friends recognize the day and hour that you're living in Bring It Back Satan someone's in your home and he's a squatter and he has no right to be there you got a right to call the police and say hey Mr police officer we've got a problem on we got a squatter in my home do you realize that squatter in your home is some Demon power that's trying to crawl through some window he may even come through the open door sometimes we allow the door to be open too far well I'm preaching anyways sometimes we allow her we allow jealousies we allow this we allow that and we open the door for spirits but you don't have to sleep with those fleas you don't have to sleep with those demons you got to realize what age what time what season you're living in you got to call up the enforcer which is the Holy Ghost and say holy ghost I don't want to live this way any longer I don't want to live with these perverted Spirits there squatters I know I know my rights I know I'm a Son of God oh Wash Me wi I snow purify my heart from all unel and the Holy Ghost take it back I take back my joy I take back my peace I take back my rest I take back everything the devil has told me don't belong to me but I am here as an enforcer a holy ghost filled enforcer of redemption claims Satan get out of my home get out of my mind get out of my spirit amen tell that old anxious nervous devil you don't have a place here Glory Glory gra out the loins of your mind and cast out those Spirits that's right that's right bring it back bring it back let the musicians come I heard brother Daniel singing that song I see the cloud the size of a man's hand oh brother something welling up in my soul how did that cloud get there because a prophet called for it remember this was an age of total gross Darkness where the prophet of God says in Shalom enough about talking about the darkness now let's talk about the light Hallelujah that light wouldn't be here without that Prophet that light wouldn't be here without him saying Shalom that light wouldn't be here without making the connection between you the bride of Christ and the opening of the word and saying that's your vision now don't get sidetracked on these other things that's your vision gross Darkness apostasy Church Creed and dogmas and traditions but don't you get caught up in that now it's time to recognize light has come where did that light come the light come from the word of life life not an intellectual Revival but a spirit word Revival I see the cloud like a man hand watch it a sign of it's a sign that the rain is falling the anointing is falling Christ himself has descended I tell you the devil don't have enough can you say it with me now the devil don't have enough Hallelujah if you've been in this Christian walk long enough now you you you can testify you've been through enough battles now but the devil don't have it enough Hallelujah we if it wasn't for election if it wasn't for his elective love we would have been swept away but but but it's his love that holds us it's his keeping love that secures us I hope I'm I'm making sense if you were born in any other age maybe you could have been the devil could have had you but not in this age because you're predestinated to this glorious stand and no one can take your place you've been restored for such a time as this in the times and seasons of the outpouring and the waves of the holy ghost moving and saturating our hearts you've been born for it Hallelujah there's nothing like the presence nothing like the pr presence oh can you just bask in his [Music] presence oh do you feel the charge of his Dynamics do you feel the sweeping of his presence Now's the Time to ask Now's the Time to come boldly before the throne of grace Now's the Time to Say I'm not leaving without a refreshing of my spirit memory you're not going to bind me any longer I'm going to separate from you do you realize that the prophet of God said that Abraham had to separate from all unbelief and then he turned around and said you've got to separate from your memory from your reasoning from your conscience you got to you got to separate from what you see what you hear how you feel you got to separate from it now's a season of Life now's the season that the waters are troubled now's the season that you don't have to be in a certain Church you don't have to live in a certain town you don't have to be under a certain Ministry we're under the ministry of the son of man we're under the ministry of Christ himself it's the troubling of the waters friends you see he's come what what was that man what what was his testimony there's no man who can help me well I tell you friend if you're looking to the arm the strength of man there's no man can help you in this age because we're all in the same boat every one of us is in the same boat but I tell you there is something there is a man here that can help you it's the one who promised to descend the pro the one who promised to bring us a message of Deliverance it's here friends he's here he's Vindicated his presence the word of his presence is here there is a man who can help us there's a man who can help the preacher there's a man here that can help the song leader there's a man who can here that can help the the musicians there's a man that can help the trustee and the Deacon and there's a man that here that can help them Mama the housewife the daddy the father in your moments of decision your moments of Despair in your moments of great trial oh it's not the time to throw in the towel it's the time to invite him in it's the time to invite him friends can you do it can you say I need you Lord there's nothing like the presence of the Lord right now you don't need a preacher to lay hands on you what but you you're in his presence right where you're seated this is the sweeping of his presence that God promised to just move over the bride and friends this ain't just this service it's every day every day a recognition of whose Pres presence you're in oh I'm Healed I'm Healed in his presence can you take the courage now and call the Holy Ghost upon the scene and say there's been a squatter in my heart there's been an impostor in my mind and my memory and my spirit he's been staying there he's been bringing up thought OD he's been he's been tormenting me every time I get a little bit of Liberty the Devil comes right out of that that rim of memory and drags me back down under bondage every time I get a I get my hands a little free to lift them up and give him praise the Devil comes with reasoning and saying I remember what you did you know what you did you know this you know but you see I I I just challenge you in the name of the Lord to take some Holy Ghost courage and say Satan you're an impostor I

people you could heal me and he opened his eyes and his eyes just started burning and they were blurry he took off his glasses he could see perfect and he's never had to wear glasses again now as he's gotten older he wears reading glasses but God just touched his eyes and even my first wife Rebecca she had to have real thick glasses and but when she got saved at 10 years old just uh Faith got a hold in her heart she thought Lord you could heal me of my eyes and I don't know if she was prayed for or not but God touched her eyes and till the day she died she never had to have glasses and I
