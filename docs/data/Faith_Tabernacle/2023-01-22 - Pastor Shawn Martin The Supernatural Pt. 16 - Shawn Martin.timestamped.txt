[43:21] but uh this case I was wrong I uh I had
[43:25] got acquainted with a
[43:27] brother from Ohio one time when I was
[43:30] pastoring in Pennsylvania and they came
[43:32] up
[43:33] and um
[43:35] so when I I just met him and and so he
[43:38] gave me his name so I was
[43:41] uh you want to welcome him you know and
[43:44] I said well it's it's good to have um
[43:46] brother John here with us you know and
[43:48] he just smiles and you know and but that
[43:52] smile I knew I'd done something wrong
[43:54] you know so I said well I I know it's
[43:57] not John it's Mark you know it's good to
[43:59] have brother Mark and that smile stayed
[44:01] there it's like oh boy you know so
[44:03] afterwards I said what's your name he
[44:05] goes Earl
[44:07] oh my oh so anyway it was really good to
[44:11] have Earl with us amen but uh anyways
[44:15] I'm not good at names but uh if you have
[44:17] your Bibles we're going to turn to the
[44:19] book of Ephesians
[44:21] and
[44:22] um the first chapter
[44:26] praise the Lord
[44:29] and I for those uh who have who had
[44:33] asked for tithe receipts last year
[44:36] uh I automatically uh made a tie the
[44:41] receipt for you this year for this year
[44:45] as well so
[44:47] um
[44:48] so if you got one last year there should
[44:51] be one ready for you this year so
[44:54] brother Josiah's got them to give to you
[44:57] I did notice that there was one or two
[45:00] that I did not get printed off and and
[45:03] you have to forgive me we went to
[45:05] service last night and didn't get in
[45:08] until
[45:09] really late and uh I think we got to bed
[45:13] at two and so uh anyway so it's my bad
[45:17] so if you did not get a a if if there's
[45:21] not one there and you had gotten one
[45:23] last year or been getting one
[45:25] and it's not there just let brother
[45:27] Josiah know he can let me know and that
[45:30] way we can get it taken care of tonight
[45:32] praise the Lord and her by tonight
[45:35] so we had a just a powerful meeting
[45:38] a couple weeks ago and I I trust that
[45:42] you all enjoyed it and I I believe the
[45:46] Lord met with us what a wonderful word
[45:48] we had and and just an anointing and and
[45:52] I believe it was a a great help to all
[45:56] then it was here and those that had
[45:59] heard over the internet and and uh so I
[46:02] just uh enjoy the presence of the Lord
[46:05] amen
[46:07] and so uh here we're going to read uh
[46:10] the book of Ephesians
[46:13] um
[46:14] and we're just going to read start at
[46:16] the 22nd verse but it says and hath but
[46:19] all things under his feet and we know
[46:21] that speaking of Christ
[46:23] and gave him to be the head over all
[46:28] things to the church so Christ is the
[46:30] head over all things to the church which
[46:33] is his body
[46:35] the fullness of him that filleth all in
[46:39] all the church being the body of Christ
[46:42] amen let's just bow our heads and talk
[46:46] to our Lord father
[46:48] truly we see you as Worthy
[46:52] Lord as holy it was you know we I no
[46:57] doubt had been preached throughout the
[46:59] years
[47:00] the ages of you being Worthy
[47:04] the Lord you proved it in this age
[47:08] when no man no angel no nothing
[47:13] Lord could open the book
[47:16] but Lord you opened it
[47:19] and father we're so thankful for it Lord
[47:23] and Lord we just praise you we give you
[47:26] glory and we give you this service and
[47:28] asking that you would have the
[47:30] preeminence now
[47:31] Lord speak to every heart Speak to My
[47:34] Heart Lord
[47:35] for we're only just the vessel
[47:39] that is who we lend to you father
[47:43] that oh God we're all needy here this
[47:45] morning
[47:46] it may when we leave this place today we
[47:50] we're known that we've been with you
[47:52] father
[47:53] I pray that you would just take every
[47:55] spirit that is contrary
[47:58] bring it under subjection Lord and may
[48:01] you just
[48:03] have your way today
[48:05] in Jesus Christ's name and the church
[48:08] says
[48:10] amen you can be seated
[48:14] praise the Lord
[48:17] I want to continue
[48:21] with the title the supernatural
[48:24] and I'll probably just continue on until
[48:28] I don't feel to do so
[48:31] but we know and and we must remember
[48:36] and it must be more than just knowledge
[48:38] but it must be a reality but the
[48:41] Christian Life is a supernatural
[48:44] it's It's Supernatural there's nothing
[48:46] natural about it
[48:48] you come to church this morning there
[48:50] had been something that made you come
[48:53] that compelled you to come if you lift
[48:56] your hands to Worship the Lord there's
[48:59] something behind that
[49:01] and and everything is is is is is
[49:05] Supernatural motivating the Christian
[49:08] Life and God is Supernatural
[49:11] and the work of redemption is
[49:14] Supernatural the the fruit of the spirit
[49:16] is Supernatural the armor of God that we
[49:20] are told to put on it's all Supernatural
[49:24] there's nothing natural about it and the
[49:27] works that Jesus said that we as his
[49:31] body would do the Greater Works that's
[49:34] Supernatural there's nothing natural
[49:36] about it and so and it's because his
[49:40] body is is is the one and the only one
[49:45] that holds the supernatural life of God
[49:48] and and so we're we we should be
[49:51] acquainted every day we should be
[49:53] acquainted with the supernatural
[49:56] um uh you you can't come in the presence
[49:59] of God without experiencing a
[50:02] supernatural touch a
[50:03] supernatural Miracle a supernatural
[50:06] working it's It's Supernatural and so
[50:10] um and and we know that the supernatural
[50:13] works that Jesus did uh is the thing
[50:17] that let the people know that God was
[50:19] with him a man God would manifest
[50:22] himself through Christ through that body
[50:24] of Christ uh physical body uh and and
[50:29] The Works were Supernatural and and so
[50:33] here even in John 3 and 2 uh Nicodemus
[50:37] came to Jesus by night and and said we
[50:40] know that thou art a teacher come from
[50:42] God for no man can do these Miracles
[50:44] that thou doest except God be with him
[50:48] amen now that was the physical body of
[50:51] of Christ and now we are the body uh the
[50:55] spiritual body of Christ and and so it's
[50:59] the works that declare it's the works
[51:01] it's not because you joined up uh with
[51:04] an organization that does not declare
[51:07] that God is with you it's not because
[51:09] you you even even to a point of even
[51:13] getting emotional and and running around
[51:16] the building and all of that that's
[51:18] that's that's not that's not the the uh
[51:22] uh sign that God is with you uh but the
[51:26] Greater Works The Works that Jesus did
[51:29] we are to do today amen and so but the
[51:33] works that Jesus did uh starting to ring
[51:36] for some reason uh but the works that
[51:39] Jesus did were was above and beyond any
[51:43] human ability whatsoever he healed the
[51:46] sick he made the lane to walk he he
[51:49] raised the dead he opened the blinded
[51:51] eyes rather rather than going to the
[51:54] hospital in our building hospitals uh
[51:57] Jesus would heal the sick he would heal
[52:00] the blind he would uh you know instead
[52:03] of building insane institutions he would
[52:06] restore their minds back and he would
[52:08] just cast the demons out and and uh uh
[52:12] uh these things instead of using
[52:15] psychology on the people he would
[52:18] discern the thoughts and intents of the
[52:20] heart and and uh for he was the word
[52:24] ain't that right so all of his Works
[52:27] were Supernatural and they still are
[52:30] Supernatural amen that's right and and
[52:33] so that's why brother Brown said God
[52:36] never did tell the church to go build
[52:37] hospitals amen uh he told them to cast
[52:41] The Devils out he told him to lay hands
[52:43] on the sick and they would recover but
[52:45] he said what is the what is the church
[52:46] doing their their building programs
[52:48] they're building hospitals they're
[52:51] they're they're leaning to the Natural
[52:52] side of the human effort and that's not
[52:56] what God called the body of Christ to do
[52:58] it's it's we are called to work in the
[53:01] Supernatural realm a man and so then we
[53:06] find that if if you have an experience
[53:08] with God your experience will be
[53:11] Supernatural uh your walk with God will
[53:14] be Supernatural your calling your
[53:17] adoption your your your uh Salvation
[53:21] everything about it is Supernatural
[53:24] ain't that right and and so then we find
[53:27] that this new birth is a supernatural
[53:30] happening it it it it's it's beyond uh
[53:34] uh excitement it's beyond sensation it's
[53:37] it's it's beyond the the the the chills
[53:40] and the Thrills and and all of that and
[53:43] and I believe that comes with it but uh
[53:46] uh but that's not the new birth the new
[53:49] birth is a supernatural happening and
[53:52] and we've we find that in in John 3 and
[53:56] 3 it says accept a man because Jesus
[53:58] tells Nicodemus he said except a man be
[54:01] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[54:05] God so it takes a new birth to be able
[54:07] to understand the kingdom of God and he
[54:11] said Nicodemus says unto him well how
[54:13] can a man be born when he is owed so
[54:16] he's got a carnal mind he's looking at a
[54:19] carnal at a carnal happening he's
[54:21] thinking it's a carnal birth it's
[54:23] something carnal he's got to do he says
[54:26] can he enter the second time into his
[54:28] mother's womb and be born and Jesus
[54:31] answered verily verily I send to thee
[54:34] accepted man be born of water and of the
[54:37] spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom
[54:40] of God that which is born of the flesh
[54:43] is flesh and that which is born of the
[54:46] spirit is Spirit ain't that right time
[54:49] so we find that the the church as a
[54:52] whole and and I'm I'm talking of the
[54:54] natural Church the church's natural
[54:56] they've gotten away from the
[54:58] Supernatural and and so then uh uh they
[55:02] want to put everything uh to the Natural
[55:05] side that Human Side human effort
[55:08] everything human uh uh so what what the
[55:12] prophets say they shake the preacher's
[55:14] hand and joined the church and that that
[55:17] that constitutes to them salvation I'm
[55:20] going to heaven right I write your name
[55:22] on the roll and and now you're part of
[55:25] the church speak in tongues and you've
[55:27] got the Holy Ghost and and run the aisle
[55:30] shout and you've got eternal life and uh
[55:33] you know and then you've got those that
[55:35] like the Catholics that that you pay a
[55:37] certain amount of money if you've never
[55:39] been to a Catholic uh thing uh we've
[55:42] been to a couple of them just to go in
[55:44] and look at it and and I remember going
[55:46] one time and seeing a bunch of candles
[55:48] all all around the altar just just
[55:50] hundreds of them and and and certain you
[55:54] know there would be uh one or two that
[55:56] would lie to a couple candles but I went
[55:58] up there and looked and and there was a
[56:00] price on every candle that you light and
[56:03] and you had to pay that price whether it
[56:05] be a quarter whether it be a dollar
[56:07] whether it be inflation today it might
[56:09] be five you know but uh uh it it it it
[56:12] it you had to pay uh uh just to light
[56:16] the candle I went to Walmart and bought
[56:18] my own candles you know but but they do
[56:21] that as a form of worship as though it's
[56:24] going to get them out of purgatory and
[56:26] and and and and you know and and and
[56:28] these things see and and so but it but
[56:31] it they lean to the Natural side of
[56:33] things the natural effort The Works of
[56:36] man seeing him Mary's uh so many times
[56:40] uh uh guarantees them certain results
[56:44] and and and things like that so so the
[56:47] church has looked to the Natural works
[56:50] of man for so long that he no longer
[56:53] looks to the Supernatural and the
[56:55] supernatural becomes a foreign thing to
[56:58] him a man uh today you know we've got
[57:02] they they have their professional choirs
[57:04] they they have their educated preachers
[57:07] well-trained and they've got their
[57:09] professional programs they've got their
[57:11] professional dancers you realize there's
[57:13] people that actually work at dancing and
[57:17] and they they practice that and then
[57:19] they get in the church and they and they
[57:21] dance it's it's it's it's it's
[57:23] professional dancing it's professional
[57:26] ministers and it's it's it's you know uh
[57:30] professional musicians and and all these
[57:33] things but church we don't want
[57:34] professionalism amen that we we we're
[57:38] wanting the supernatural that that
[57:41] that's what we want we we want see so a
[57:44] man cannot be born again without the
[57:47] supernatural a a person cannot be healed
[57:50] without the supernatural I don't care
[57:52] how much medicine you take it it'll take
[57:55] the supernatural element Amen to touch
[57:58] that body or you'll never get healed it
[58:01] ain't that right amen you you cannot be
[58:04] a part of the body of Christ without the
[58:06] supernatural you we cannot even be an
[58:09] invincible Army without the supernatural
[58:12] you realize that we need the
[58:15] supernatural we cannot do the Greater
[58:17] Works with without the supernatural I
[58:19] don't care you know we we can have
[58:21] everything perfect to a t mechanically
[58:24] wise but but as the prophet said it's
[58:26] the Dynamics ain't there it ain't going
[58:28] to work it just ain't gonna run ain't
[58:31] that right and and so now I I want to
[58:34] make very clear to you as we go here
[58:38] um uh that that the spirit of God of
[58:41] course is the Supernatural and it can
[58:44] fall on anyone uh it it can fall on
[58:47] anyone which means that but not
[58:49] everything not everything is a fair
[58:52] fleshly manifestation and and so and
[58:55] this is what the prophet said you know
[58:58] uh that that uh it can it and this is
[59:00] where you get into the anointed ones at
[59:02] the end time but so so we we find that
[59:05] shouting dancing uh uh um getting
[59:09] emotional speaking in tongues and what
[59:11] more it must not and we must not
[59:14] attribute all of that Amen to fleshly
[59:17] manifestations carnal uh manifestations
[59:21] someone getting in the flesh and and and
[59:24] dancing or shouting or Screaming or uh
[59:28] uh speaking in tongues or uh uh
[59:30] prophesying or or whatever all of that
[59:33] uh that cannot always and and and if uh
[59:37] uh and those of you that really believe
[59:39] the message and know that you then then
[59:41] you know that that the everything must
[59:44] not be attributed to the carnal side of
[59:47] things brother Brandon said said when a
[59:49] man is watched in the blood of the Lamb
[59:51] he don't need music or nothing else the
[59:55] power of God just works upon him and he
[59:58] can shout screen praise God or do
[1:00:02] anything else whether there's music or
[1:00:04] not see the Holy Ghost is in him and
[1:00:08] he's identified with Jesus Christ but
[1:00:11] today we just want to see we just want
[1:00:14] to we have to jump around a little bit
[1:00:17] as Pentecostals see because our
[1:00:19] forefathers did but notice what the
[1:00:22] difference he puts between the age today
[1:00:24] Pentecostal age and that back then they
[1:00:27] had something to jump around about
[1:00:30] this Holy Spirit making them jump ain't
[1:00:35] that right see so so see not everything
[1:00:38] is fleshly
[1:00:40] the Holy Spirit does that stuff too
[1:00:42] ain't that right so he says here what
[1:00:45] makes these people to you who doesn't
[1:00:47] have the Holy Spirit what comes upon
[1:00:49] them just sends their soul into shouting
[1:00:52] for a few moments it's a baptism
[1:00:54] something that sways down across them
[1:00:57] and fills their hearts with power and
[1:01:00] goodness and mercy and the Holy Spirit
[1:01:03] makes them just raise their hands and
[1:01:06] scream
[1:01:07] well why are they doing that the Holy
[1:01:09] Spirit does that
[1:01:10] so so you can't look at that and say oh
[1:01:13] that song that's that's wrong well
[1:01:15] you've got to be careful with that right
[1:01:17] so here brother Brown is saying see they
[1:01:19] cannot contain it any longer what is it
[1:01:23] it's the bomb everybody say it's the
[1:01:25] bomb it's the bomb to their soul not now
[1:01:28] uh I like that raising her the holy
[1:01:31] spirit makes them raise their hands and
[1:01:33] scream it's the bomb it's the bomb to
[1:01:36] their soul that lets them know that they
[1:01:38] pass from Death unto life can you say
[1:01:41] man so then we find that brother Branham
[1:01:44] at a at towards an end of one of his
[1:01:47] Services he asked the people to raise
[1:01:49] their hand if they wanted Lord if if
[1:01:51] they wanted more and you know uh how he
[1:01:54] done that and uh uh if they wanted to
[1:01:57] receive the real kingdom of God and so
[1:01:59] several raised their hand and then in
[1:02:02] his prayer he says I believe I believe
[1:02:04] they could not raise their hand lest
[1:02:07] there was something there to make them
[1:02:10] raise their hand
[1:02:11] see there's a spirit around them now
[1:02:14] he's praying this he said and these men
[1:02:17] and women 90 of them perhaps Lord that
[1:02:20] they realize that there's something
[1:02:21] wrong and they don't want it that way
[1:02:24] see they they don't want to stay that
[1:02:26] way in other words and now according to
[1:02:29] science they could not raise that hand
[1:02:31] see gravitation holds that hand down but
[1:02:35] they can defy science because they're
[1:02:37] human beings and they have a spirit that
[1:02:41] can command that hand to come up and
[1:02:45] it'll come up see and God you so endowed
[1:02:49] men with on free moral agency to make
[1:02:52] his own decisions and now there's a
[1:02:55] spirit standing by the sight of them
[1:02:58] that tells them that the very spirit
[1:03:01] that they've been worshiping around has
[1:03:03] been wrong and they want a decision see
[1:03:06] and the spirit that's around him the
[1:03:08] holy spirit makes them raised their
[1:03:12] hands so raising hands is important
[1:03:16] not saying you got to raise your hands
[1:03:20] but a lot of times when brother Branham
[1:03:22] asked and I I still believe it happens
[1:03:24] today but when brother Branham asked
[1:03:26] people to raise their hand if they want
[1:03:27] something and if they didn't raise their
[1:03:29] hand it could have been their last
[1:03:30] service
[1:03:31] last time their last opportunity
[1:03:34] but here he's saying that the Holy
[1:03:36] Spirit was there to make them raise
[1:03:38] their hand aren't you glad the Holy
[1:03:40] Spirit does them things the Holy Spirit
[1:03:43] commands us
[1:03:44] I had and and that's a personal
[1:03:47] relationship
[1:03:48] ain't that right so so then now now not
[1:03:52] only though does he the we we know that
[1:03:54] the supernatural can also fall on an
[1:03:58] unconverted person and cause them to do
[1:04:00] things as well
[1:04:01] a question was asked uh brother Branham
[1:04:04] if a woman who has short hair speaks in
[1:04:07] tongues in the church is it the spirit
[1:04:09] of the Holy Ghost that speaks through
[1:04:11] her or is it a false Spirit brother
[1:04:13] Branham responds by saying this this is
[1:04:16] a hard real hard question and I can only
[1:04:20] answer it the best that I know how now I
[1:04:22] cannot judge because I was not sent to
[1:04:25] judge but I think there's so many times
[1:04:27] he said I got another question down here
[1:04:29] somewhere that goes right along with
[1:04:31] that but if a person is speaking in
[1:04:33] tongues they are anointed of God
[1:04:39] but say Amen
[1:04:41] if a person speaks in tongues they are
[1:04:44] anointed of God
[1:04:45] they may be out of order that may be
[1:04:49] true and they may be doing something
[1:04:51] that's not right but I wouldn't want to
[1:04:54] say that it wasn't the holy spirit
[1:04:56] because I would know
[1:04:59] right
[1:05:00] now if a prophet would be careful with
[1:05:02] that then we must be careful with that
[1:05:04] right
[1:05:05] so he says there's many times that
[1:05:08] people misjudge one another and it is a
[1:05:11] bad thing too you say why she's got
[1:05:13] short hair she's wearing a dress that's
[1:05:15] too short that's not the Holy Ghost upon
[1:05:17] her don't do that don't do that that's
[1:05:20] not right you don't know what's in that
[1:05:23] woman's heart
[1:05:25] you don't know nothing about it you know
[1:05:28] that the Holy Spirit would make her
[1:05:30] conduct herself a little better now that
[1:05:33] may be true but I'll tell you as uh as
[1:05:37] you and I let God do the judging of that
[1:05:40] and lets you and I pray for that person
[1:05:43] that God will show them the light
[1:05:46] ain't that right you remember brother
[1:05:49] Brown and well he goes on in this that
[1:05:52] that he had that lady playing the piano
[1:05:54] with short hair I think it was short
[1:05:56] hair or something like that makeup or
[1:05:58] whatever and uh he got blasted for that
[1:06:01] but he said I knew her heart and he said
[1:06:04] I had her up there playing and and I got
[1:06:07] rebuked for it you know who that lady is
[1:06:09] that's Jim Ed Dalton's wife
[1:06:12] she's passed on now
[1:06:14] but they there came into the message and
[1:06:18] if you ever got to meet her it's got
[1:06:19] real long hair just a sweet little lady
[1:06:22] and I didn't know it was her until well
[1:06:26] just a year or so ago uh brother Jim Ed
[1:06:28] was given his testimony on the internet
[1:06:31] and he said that woman was my wife
[1:06:34] but brother Brown saw the spirit in it
[1:06:36] see and and so we we find in another
[1:06:41] place brother Brown said If a person is
[1:06:43] sitting in a congregation a spirit can
[1:06:46] fall upon that person and yet you know
[1:06:49] that they are wrong and they don't live
[1:06:51] the right kind of life be careful
[1:06:54] everybody say be careful what you say
[1:06:56] about that Spirit it might be the Holy
[1:07:00] Spirit
[1:07:01] he also said another place the spirit
[1:07:03] can speak through a hypocrite exactly
[1:07:05] I've seen it done and I can prove you by
[1:07:07] the scriptures that that's right I can
[1:07:09] prove to you by the scriptures that
[1:07:11] demon powers take up those spirits and
[1:07:14] use them sure they take up those gifts
[1:07:16] and use them I've stood and seen Devils
[1:07:19] speak in tongues and interpret it I've
[1:07:21] seen Hypocrites take the genuine Holy
[1:07:24] Spirit and speak with it
[1:07:26] someone asked me not long ago he said
[1:07:29] brother Branham if that Holy Spirit is
[1:07:30] so great he said I've seen people who
[1:07:32] stood in the meeting shouted praise God
[1:07:34] tears running down their cheeks and they
[1:07:36] would come out and do things like
[1:07:37] Sinners and go to sinful places and live
[1:07:39] in sin was that the Holy Spirit making
[1:07:42] those people shout I said yes
[1:07:45] he said oh do you mean the Holy Spirit
[1:07:47] would fall on a person like that I said
[1:07:49] yes
[1:07:50] Jesus said A sower went forth and sowed
[1:07:53] some seeds the enemy come in and sowed
[1:07:56] some tears and the husbandman said shall
[1:07:58] I go pull up the tears and said if you
[1:08:00] do you pull up the wheat let them both
[1:08:03] grow together ain't that right we also
[1:08:06] know that ke Ephesus the high priest
[1:08:09] there in the Bible
[1:08:10] uh uh he prophesied in the days of Jesus
[1:08:13] see and so brother Brown says the holy
[1:08:16] spirit of God was upon him to preach
[1:08:19] prophesy and foretell it to come to pass
[1:08:23] right this is the high priest the spirit
[1:08:26] of God Came Upon him to preach to
[1:08:28] prophesy and to foretell it and it comes
[1:08:30] to pass
[1:08:31] and denied and crucified the very vended
[1:08:35] gated word of the hour
[1:08:37] ain't that right so the Holy Spirit the
[1:08:40] spirit of God the supernatural can fall
[1:08:42] upon anyone
[1:08:43] uh uh there and and and and yet it
[1:08:47] doesn't mean that that person is saved
[1:08:50] ain't that right see so the the thing
[1:08:53] that we we must be careful is don't say
[1:08:55] anything uh about what what happens
[1:08:59] ain't that right uh uh if if if you're
[1:09:04] hearing someone shout if you're seeing
[1:09:06] someone you know uh speaking in tongues
[1:09:08] in the prophecy and all of that just
[1:09:11] just just leave it alone
[1:09:13] ain't that right uh uh of course you
[1:09:17] know uh the pastor you know will will
[1:09:20] I'm sure take care of them things if if
[1:09:22] need be but so we find uh also I I want
[1:09:27] to say this every church is sovereign
[1:09:30] so if you're seeing a church do
[1:09:32] something that you don't agree with and
[1:09:34] even if you see it in the message in the
[1:09:37] Bible that it's that that it that what
[1:09:40] is going on is not the same uh and and
[1:09:44] they're maybe doing contrary don't say
[1:09:46] nothing against it
[1:09:48] it could be the Holy Spirit
[1:09:51] that's just all I can say I I'm just
[1:09:54] telling you what brother Brown said
[1:09:55] every church is sovereign
[1:09:57] we're not a denomination
[1:09:59] ain't that right so if you if these
[1:10:03] things don't don't fight with them don't
[1:10:05] fight with other churches we we don't
[1:10:07] want to fight a man because listen and
[1:10:10] I'm going to just just continue with
[1:10:12] this thought for a moment but when you
[1:10:14] get to fighting with them you know what
[1:10:15] you'll do you'll lose your balance in
[1:10:18] the word of God
[1:10:19] especially ministers
[1:10:21] ain't that right you you lose your
[1:10:24] balance because it'll cause you to start
[1:10:27] to look at things a certain way
[1:10:30] it'll cause uh it'll cause you to study
[1:10:33] a a certain way ain't that right and
[1:10:36] then you can miss the true
[1:10:37] interpretation of what is really being
[1:10:40] said in them tapes and and in the Bible
[1:10:43] because you hear and read uh things from
[1:10:47] a biased point of view
[1:10:50] ain't that right so so if if someone
[1:10:54] fights you know against the legalists
[1:10:56] you know for for example and you're
[1:10:58] fighting against the legalists then then
[1:11:00] you know uh uh a person that is fighting
[1:11:03] against the legalists will will
[1:11:05] automatically
[1:11:07] lean and tend to shutting everything out
[1:11:11] that would think of legalism
[1:11:15] you you you read quotes that that maybe
[1:11:18] look at legalism or that that team tend
[1:11:21] to go legalists and if you're fighting
[1:11:24] them legalists then it'll make you not
[1:11:27] want to read them quotes it'll make you
[1:11:29] anyone that reads them quotes then
[1:11:32] you'll think oh they're legalists you
[1:11:33] know what I'm saying because you have a
[1:11:36] your your your your uh uh thoughts
[1:11:39] become bias so if if you know that so
[1:11:43] therefore if someone fights against
[1:11:45] emotions then they have the tendency to
[1:11:49] shut out any Scripture any quote a man
[1:11:51] that leans toward emotions
[1:11:55] because you're you're so caught up in
[1:11:58] fighting uh uh and and trying to prove a
[1:12:02] point that anything that goes against
[1:12:04] your point or seems to go against your
[1:12:06] point then then you shut down
[1:12:10] you understand what I'm saying so then
[1:12:13] you know uh uh uh if if you're fighting
[1:12:16] if if someone's fighting you know uh
[1:12:19] emotions and and things like that then
[1:12:21] someone starts dancing well then if
[1:12:23] you're not careful you'll call it
[1:12:24] fanatical you'll you'll call it
[1:12:26] something else you'll call it this and
[1:12:28] that and and and that's what you know uh
[1:12:31] it's because you become leaning into
[1:12:34] something else well then if someone is
[1:12:35] fighting those who believe in gifts and
[1:12:38] emotions and if they're not careful
[1:12:39] they'll get off the balance and they'll
[1:12:41] go so to the extreme if they shut
[1:12:43] everything down and God can't work
[1:12:49] hello
[1:12:50] if someone gets all emotional then they
[1:12:53] considered backslit
[1:12:54] or if you're fighting the formalism
[1:12:57] you people that don't do nothing don't
[1:12:59] believe in gifts don't believe in
[1:13:01] anything like that
[1:13:02] then and if you've got that in your mind
[1:13:05] then you'll go you'll go to the extremes
[1:13:07] the other way
[1:13:09] and and therefore then when someone
[1:13:12] ain't just as emotional as you oh
[1:13:14] they're formalism
[1:13:16] they just caught up and they're so bound
[1:13:18] well that that don't mean that they are
[1:13:22] but but because we if we get into a
[1:13:25] fighting mold concerned about everybody
[1:13:28] else around and what they're doing then
[1:13:31] we lose the balance of what brother
[1:13:33] Branham is saying from the scriptures
[1:13:37] so we want to keep our mind clear can
[1:13:39] you say man
[1:13:41] keep your mind clear amen and and
[1:13:45] um uh and just you know I I you know we
[1:13:48] we as Ministry we we want to keep our
[1:13:50] minds clear I don't care what they're
[1:13:52] doing about the Thunders
[1:13:54] just because they messed them Thunders
[1:13:56] up and they missed you know they must do
[1:13:58] the you know I've seen guys that'll that
[1:14:00] that that blast the Thunders and they
[1:14:03] fight the Thunder movement so much that
[1:14:04] if you get up and preach the Thunder oh
[1:14:08] well brother Brown's wanna preach the
[1:14:09] Thunders
[1:14:10] there's people that have taken the
[1:14:11] Eighth Day and messed it all up but you
[1:14:14] know we wouldn't even known there's the
[1:14:16] Eighth Day
[1:14:17] we didn't we wouldn't know it applied to
[1:14:19] us or brother Brandon hadn't taught it
[1:14:21] but if we get to arguing about it and
[1:14:23] trying to correct everything then we
[1:14:26] ain't got no quotes to preach anymore
[1:14:29] right you understand what I'm saying so
[1:14:32] you can preach the eighth day and be
[1:14:34] balanced with it you can preach the
[1:14:36] Thunders and breathe and bring a true
[1:14:39] interpretation to it you understand what
[1:14:41] I'm saying you you brother Brian I'm
[1:14:44] kept a balance and so if we stay with
[1:14:47] the message and just keep everything
[1:14:49] clear no matter what everybody else is
[1:14:52] doing with it just keep it clear you'll
[1:14:55] keep a balance
[1:14:58] ain't that Ryan fighting does more harm
[1:15:01] than good
[1:15:02] ain't that right
[1:15:05] so we want to hear the message
[1:15:07] we want to hear the message without
[1:15:09] having our mind cluttered with what
[1:15:12] other churches are doing with what other
[1:15:13] ministers are teaching or or these
[1:15:16] things
[1:15:16] now you know and and so uh of course you
[1:15:21] know being a pastor you know you you
[1:15:23] have to deal with things especially if
[1:15:24] there's a spirit of unbelief trying to
[1:15:26] come in you we're going to deal with it
[1:15:27] if if there's false Doctrine trying to
[1:15:30] come in we're going to deal with it you
[1:15:31] know but but that's that's that's that's
[1:15:34] as a pastor that's what we've got to do
[1:15:36] ain't that rhyme but not not to fight
[1:15:39] with people and and if we have that
[1:15:40] motive to fight then we lose the balance
[1:15:44] ain't that right and so we we find that
[1:15:48] that it always has to be the balance but
[1:15:50] I want to continue on with this thought
[1:15:52] on the Supernatural and and we can go
[1:15:56] back to the day of Pentecost as to what
[1:15:58] happened on the day of Pentecost it was
[1:16:01] a supernatural event
[1:16:04] how many believes that it was the
[1:16:06] supernatural thing uh uh and and it was
[1:16:09] more than speaking in tongues it was
[1:16:11] more than staggering all over the place
[1:16:13] it was more than stuttering or
[1:16:16] stammering it it was more than them
[1:16:19] things and and uh it was more than just
[1:16:22] uh uh uh the fleshly actions of that
[1:16:27] that were that you saw in in the fleshly
[1:16:30] uh demonstration amen but but all of
[1:16:33] that was a result of what happened
[1:16:36] they spoke in tongues they they
[1:16:38] stuttered they stammered they staggered
[1:16:40] amen but what caused that
[1:16:43] that's that's the key is what caused it
[1:16:47] ain't that right well it it you know
[1:16:50] what it was 120 people that day received
[1:16:54] the new birth
[1:16:55] and it was something Supernatural that
[1:16:58] happened ain't that right and what is
[1:17:01] that the life of God the life of God
[1:17:05] came into a mortal human beings and
[1:17:09] Immortal Life came into a mortal being
[1:17:12] and quickened them
[1:17:15] ain't that right Quicken them with his
[1:17:17] own life God quickened them and that was
[1:17:20] the start of the body of Christ that
[1:17:23] that the the Church of the Living God
[1:17:26] and and then we find that the book of
[1:17:29] Acts is a result is a result of what
[1:17:33] that birth that that of what happened
[1:17:35] that Supernatural day uh event that
[1:17:38] happened at that day uh brought forth
[1:17:41] the book of Acts ain't that right we
[1:17:43] find out that 30 years after that Paul
[1:17:45] was sitting in the church gifts
[1:17:48] can you say man you couldn't have set
[1:17:51] them gifts in there without Pentecost
[1:17:54] but it took a supernatural happening and
[1:17:58] then what happened then God would raise
[1:18:01] up a a Prophet by the name of Paul a man
[1:18:04] to set them gifts in order in the church
[1:18:07] ain't that right now we find that that
[1:18:11] the the book of Acts was not the books
[1:18:14] of the Apostles it was not the about the
[1:18:16] Acts of the Apostles it was the about
[1:18:19] the supernatural Holy Ghost working
[1:18:22] through them men and women amen Hebrews
[1:18:25] 1 14 Paul would say God also bearing
[1:18:29] them witness both with signs and wonders
[1:18:32] with divers Miracles and Gifts of the
[1:18:35] Holy Ghost according to his own will
[1:18:38] ain't that right so God bore them
[1:18:40] witness if if if he continued to stay
[1:18:44] with him it wasn't just a one day
[1:18:47] happening amen that was the birth of the
[1:18:50] church but the Holy Spirit continued
[1:18:52] with them and bore record of them by
[1:18:56] signs and wonders
[1:18:58] Supernatural
[1:19:01] they didn't just have that new birth
[1:19:02] that Supernatural happening and then
[1:19:05] start leaning building hospitals and
[1:19:07] building this and having seminaries and
[1:19:09] all that no they stayed pure
[1:19:13] they stayed pure
[1:19:15] and so we find the Church of the Living
[1:19:18] God was established on the day of
[1:19:20] Pentecost
[1:19:21] by receiving the New Birth the people
[1:19:24] receiving and what birth was it it was a
[1:19:27] word birth
[1:19:28] it was a word birth for Peter identified
[1:19:32] what was happening in the scriptures
[1:19:34] everybody say it was a word birth
[1:19:38] that's right see Acts 2 15 these are not
[1:19:41] drunken now this is Peter now they're
[1:19:43] questioning what in the world is going
[1:19:44] on and they're attributing they're
[1:19:46] seeing the fleshly manifestations and
[1:19:49] they're attributing it to something
[1:19:50] natural
[1:19:51] and they're saying oh these men are
[1:19:53] drunk on wine or whatever see and and so
[1:19:57] Peter's under the Holy Ghost under
[1:19:59] inspiration said these men are not drunk
[1:20:02] and as you suppose saying it is but the
[1:20:05] third hour of the day but this is that
[1:20:08] can you say man it this is that a man
[1:20:13] which was spoken by the prophet Joel
[1:20:15] ain't that right so the new birth was a
[1:20:19] word birth it was a scripture birth
[1:20:22] ain't that right so here the prophet
[1:20:26] says he false false teachers will bring
[1:20:29] false births
[1:20:32] that's why it's always pays to be
[1:20:34] careful who you said under who you
[1:20:35] listen to
[1:20:37] because false teachers will bring false
[1:20:39] births
[1:20:41] true prophets will bring the word
[1:20:43] the birth of the word Christ
[1:20:46] can you say man
[1:20:48] false prophets will bring false birth
[1:20:51] the birth of churches the birth of
[1:20:53] Creeds the birth of denominations
[1:20:56] and here you are Pentecostal brother
[1:20:58] fals sent or Sensations and tell a man
[1:21:02] he's got the Holy Ghost because he
[1:21:04] speaks with tongues I've seen Devils
[1:21:06] speak with tongues pencils lay down and
[1:21:08] write in unknown tongues that don't mean
[1:21:10] a thing it's got to be a Life by their
[1:21:13] fruit you shall know them brother
[1:21:15] Branham do you believe in speaking in
[1:21:16] tongues yes sir do you believe in
[1:21:18] shouting yes sir to be a Christian I
[1:21:21] believe that
[1:21:23] if you're a Christian you will believe
[1:21:25] these things ain't that right I believe
[1:21:28] God's word but if the life isn't there
[1:21:31] to back it up
[1:21:33] ain't that right so that's the key is is
[1:21:37] the New Birth the life uh uh the word
[1:21:40] birth it was a word bird so the church
[1:21:43] that God planted on the day of Pentecost
[1:21:45] is a word church it was a word seed a
[1:21:49] word church you believe that it was not
[1:21:52] started by denomination it was started
[1:21:55] by a prophecy
[1:21:57] foreign
[1:21:58] prophecy Joel's prophecy was laying
[1:22:02] there for how many years I don't know
[1:22:04] but then the holy spirit amen these
[1:22:07] these men and women got up in that room
[1:22:10] waiting on the promise for Jesus told
[1:22:12] them Terry ye into Jerusalem
[1:22:16] ain't that right and they got up there
[1:22:19] and they were waiting on the promise
[1:22:24] Prophet says you know gives us you know
[1:22:26] maybe a little insight upon it maybe one
[1:22:29] of them stood up and said well we've
[1:22:30] said here long enough I had a good cry
[1:22:32] maybe this is it maybe we can go out no
[1:22:35] no no props ain't come yet
[1:22:38] well I I feel a lot better than what I
[1:22:40] did
[1:22:40] not know you gotta wait
[1:22:42] probably saying come yet why they were
[1:22:45] waiting for the word
[1:22:47] they were waiting for that word to come
[1:22:48] to pass
[1:22:50] can you say Amen they were waiting on
[1:22:52] like a certain kind of a birth
[1:22:55] not a denominational birth amen not some
[1:22:58] other birth but a word birth
[1:23:01] can you say man and when it came Peter
[1:23:04] could identify it in the Bible and say
[1:23:07] this is that
[1:23:10] ain't that right
[1:23:12] so what happened on the day of Pentecost
[1:23:16] was not
[1:23:20] the the same as Judas being anointed to
[1:23:24] heal the sick and cast out devils
[1:23:26] and then turning around and denying the
[1:23:29] Vindicated word
[1:23:31] for he betrayed the word ain't that
[1:23:34] right
[1:23:35] yep he spoke in tongues I got her I
[1:23:38] guess I don't know but I know he healed
[1:23:40] the sick cast out devils
[1:23:43] he done
[1:23:44] them works
[1:23:47] but when it comes to Pentecost
[1:23:49] he showed his colors
[1:23:52] and he betrayed the word
[1:23:55] of the hour
[1:23:57] ain't that right Jesus said that Judas
[1:24:00] was the son of perdition
[1:24:02] so now what happened on the day of
[1:24:04] Pentecost wasn't like campus
[1:24:06] being anointed to prophesy and foretell
[1:24:09] things and it come to pass even
[1:24:11] and then turning around and crucifying
[1:24:16] the Very anointed word
[1:24:19] ain't that right
[1:24:21] he was one of the priests that had no
[1:24:22] representation in heaven
[1:24:26] yet anointed
[1:24:28] but what happened on the dead Pentecost
[1:24:30] wasn't that way
[1:24:33] for this was the word birth
[1:24:36] hello
[1:24:38] that's right
[1:24:40] the day of Pentecost was not another
[1:24:42] false prophet like Balaam rising up
[1:24:45] these 120 was birthed
[1:24:49] by the word of God
[1:24:51] ain't that right
[1:24:53] yes sir they had root
[1:24:55] and where was the route this Bible
[1:24:59] the experience that they received was
[1:25:01] from this Bible
[1:25:02] ain't that right
[1:25:04] so we find how do we know that that they
[1:25:07] had that word bird the promise of
[1:25:09] scripture was fulfilled
[1:25:11] and so it was the word birth now what
[1:25:15] was God doing the prophet said let us
[1:25:17] not forget that in the beginning he
[1:25:20] smote the side of Adam and he took
[1:25:22] something from his side now the smiting
[1:25:25] of Christ was for a cause that he might
[1:25:28] take from him one to be a family the
[1:25:31] bride he might take him a bride so when
[1:25:34] his Masterpiece was perfected then he
[1:25:37] had to Smite it take it from him not
[1:25:40] another piece not another creation but
[1:25:43] of the same creation
[1:25:45] ain't that right he said my brother
[1:25:47] don't think bad at this but think a
[1:25:49] minute if it took from him the original
[1:25:52] creation to make the bride for him he
[1:25:54] never made another creation he took a
[1:25:57] part of the original creation then if he
[1:26:00] was the word what must the bride be it's
[1:26:03] got to be the original word
[1:26:06] Living God in the word ain't that right
[1:26:10] so on the dead Pentecost the prophet
[1:26:13] said he started to build another
[1:26:16] masterpiece
[1:26:17] he started that was the beginning of it
[1:26:22] so therefore it had to be a word birth
[1:26:28] amen The Original Seed he started to
[1:26:31] build another Masterpiece The Original
[1:26:33] Seed word
[1:26:35] so it had to be based upon word
[1:26:38] started in the first church what was it
[1:26:41] the seed word the word manifest the
[1:26:43] promise that had been given
[1:26:46] Joel said it shall come to pass in the
[1:26:48] last day saith God I'll pour out my
[1:26:50] spirit upon All Flesh your sons and
[1:26:52] daughters shall prophesy your old men
[1:26:54] shall dream dreams your young men shall
[1:26:56] see Visions what he would do in the last
[1:26:58] days this two last two thousand years
[1:27:00] ain't that right so notice it started
[1:27:03] out as the original
[1:27:06] as Jesus said the word of God is a seed
[1:27:09] that A sower sowed he was the sower the
[1:27:12] seed was the word
[1:27:14] so it was a perfect word seed that God
[1:27:18] planted on that day of Pentecost no
[1:27:21] denominational handling no Creeds mixed
[1:27:24] in with it no man's idea mixed in with
[1:27:27] it can you say Amen the emotion the gift
[1:27:30] the whatever happened on that day came
[1:27:33] solely from the word of God
[1:27:41] amen
[1:27:43] now the prophet said notice
[1:27:45] that Pentecost their bodies were
[1:27:47] quickened everybody say quickened by the
[1:27:50] new life they received
[1:27:52] that makes me feel religious here was
[1:27:55] men fishermen Tax Collectors The Humble
[1:27:59] Little Women see just ordinary
[1:28:01] Housewives little virgin girls see they
[1:28:04] were believers they were believing that
[1:28:05] this was the truth they believed that
[1:28:08] and when Jesus died they believed on him
[1:28:11] Rose and Rose up again from the dead
[1:28:13] they believed that to be the absolute
[1:28:15] testimony of God that he had quickened
[1:28:18] him to life now they go up to the day of
[1:28:21] Pentecost to receive their abstract
[1:28:24] do you know what that abstract is it's
[1:28:27] when a deed has been cleared they went
[1:28:29] up there to receive their abstract and
[1:28:33] they become quickened
[1:28:36] oh Church the supernatural God quickened
[1:28:40] that mortal body
[1:28:43] ain't that right now what denomination
[1:28:45] can do that what Creed what Dogma what
[1:28:49] what ideology of man can Quicken a
[1:28:51] people it took a supernatural
[1:28:56] it made them alive and you know what it
[1:28:58] made them alive to the word
[1:29:02] it made them alive to the word that's
[1:29:05] right and Peter could verify it that
[1:29:07] experience with the word this is that
[1:29:09] which the prophet spoke
[1:29:12] ain't that right so then we know that
[1:29:15] the Pentecostal seed had to die and rot
[1:29:18] it fell at nicaea ain't that right and
[1:29:22] notice God but but even before and I see
[1:29:25] it God would give a warning to the first
[1:29:27] church age
[1:29:29] to that first church and he's already
[1:29:31] giving them a warning in Revelations 2
[1:29:34] and 4 he says to them remember everybody
[1:29:37] say remember therefore from whence Thou
[1:29:40] Art fallen and repent and do the first
[1:29:44] works first Works ain't that right
[1:29:46] brother Bradham reads that and he says
[1:29:48] God tells them to remember remember say
[1:29:51] evidently something had left their minds
[1:29:54] they had forgotten something and he told
[1:29:57] them to turn back in their minds to
[1:30:00] their porn of origin
[1:30:03] the origin of the first age was
[1:30:06] Pentecost they had fallen from it they
[1:30:09] had forgotten the glory and wonder of it
[1:30:12] it was time to go back in mind and then
[1:30:15] in reality
[1:30:19] ain't that right back to when they could
[1:30:22] say for me to live is Christ back to
[1:30:24] Purity when ananias and Sapphira were
[1:30:28] dealt with back to the gate called
[1:30:30] Beautiful
[1:30:32] ain't that right so already in the first
[1:30:34] church they began to drift away from
[1:30:36] that experience and God is tell them to
[1:30:39] go back remember in your mind and when
[1:30:41] you get it in your mind then it'll
[1:30:43] become reality to you
[1:30:46] but we find out that the church just
[1:30:48] kept on going
[1:30:50] it died that that seed died and rotted
[1:30:54] but then we find that that seed began to
[1:30:57] grow and brother Brown talks about the
[1:30:59] three stages of the seed as we know and
[1:31:01] and the natural it shows us the true
[1:31:03] picture of it ain't that right three
[1:31:05] stages of the natural seed he said a
[1:31:07] seed like planted he brings forth a
[1:31:10] stock little blade shoots from it then
[1:31:12] the tossel then the pollen hangs on that
[1:31:14] then the shuck and then the seed again
[1:31:18] then the seat again can you say amen
[1:31:21] that's right see so so then we find what
[1:31:24] he tells us that the church has already
[1:31:26] gone through them three stages
[1:31:29] Luther Wesley Pentecost ages can't ain't
[1:31:32] that right amen so where are we at today
[1:31:36] Baptist seed again
[1:31:41] the same seed that was planted in on the
[1:31:43] day of Pentecost we're right back to
[1:31:45] that seat again
[1:31:48] yes sir and if you believe the message
[1:31:50] you'll believe that brother Brown says
[1:31:52] it all the way through it
[1:31:54] look he says the uh the wheat cannot
[1:31:57] change how many believes that we cannot
[1:31:59] change well what was the wheat began
[1:32:02] with it was a seed
[1:32:04] right it didn't start out as a corn seed
[1:32:07] then become wheat it was a wheat it was
[1:32:10] seed form
[1:32:12] but then when it comes seed again it's
[1:32:14] in its maturity
[1:32:17] ain't that right it's not in the
[1:32:20] planning stage it's in its Harvest stage
[1:32:25] so that we cannot change so notice what
[1:32:28] he says for today it's got to be a
[1:32:32] Ministry just exactly on the word like
[1:32:35] he was on the word and like the first
[1:32:38] church was on the word Spirit field word
[1:32:41] fed not denominational fed it's word fed
[1:32:46] that's what it means to be back to seat
[1:32:48] again
[1:32:50] we've gone through all them
[1:32:51] denominations
[1:32:53] but it's nothing but corruption
[1:32:55] we've gone through all the men's
[1:32:57] theology but it's nothing but corruption
[1:32:59] we are back to word again
[1:33:03] and what would it take it would take a
[1:33:05] prophet to bring the word again
[1:33:08] that's why you can't look at it and say
[1:33:10] well that's brother branham's opinion
[1:33:11] and that's brother Brown's opinion well
[1:33:13] if it ain't fitting in the Bible then it
[1:33:15] ain't just it that's it then brother
[1:33:17] Branham is wrong I beg to differ with
[1:33:19] you we've had this Bible for many years
[1:33:23] and we didn't understand it
[1:33:27] but the more we get into this message we
[1:33:29] begin to understand what this really
[1:33:31] means
[1:33:32] and you cannot see just call it brother
[1:33:34] Brandon's idea
[1:33:37] can you say man we're back to seed again
[1:33:40] and we can never come back to seed
[1:33:42] without a prophet restoring the word
[1:33:47] ain't that right
[1:33:49] so then then where are we at
[1:33:52] we everybody say we
[1:33:54] have received a word birth as well
[1:33:59] we have received a birth word birth
[1:34:04] the difference between the word birth
[1:34:06] today and the word birth on the day of
[1:34:07] Pentecost is this
[1:34:09] different scriptures everybody say
[1:34:10] different scriptures
[1:34:12] are being fulfilled
[1:34:14] more scriptures
[1:34:16] are being fulfilled
[1:34:18] in this hour than it was back then
[1:34:22] ain't that right
[1:34:24] for we are in the Fulfillment of Malachi
[1:34:26] 4 they weren't
[1:34:27] we are in the Fulfillment of Luke 17 30.
[1:34:30] they weren't
[1:34:31] we are in the in the Fulfillment of
[1:34:34] Revelations 10 they weren't we are in
[1:34:37] the Fulfillment of John 14 they weren't
[1:34:39] we are in the Fulfillment of of first
[1:34:41] Thessalonians 4 16 and that they weren't
[1:34:46] we are in the Fulfillment of Revelations
[1:34:47] 5 Revelations 8 Genesis 5 22. Hebrews 11
[1:34:52] 5 and on and on and on and on and on and
[1:34:54] on we could go about the word that is
[1:34:56] being fulfilled in us that did not
[1:34:59] become fulfilled in them
[1:35:01] but nevertheless they did receive a word
[1:35:04] birth
[1:35:05] for they said this is that
[1:35:11] brother Adam said the lutherans under
[1:35:13] justification the feet raised it like
[1:35:15] that Wesley under sanctification the
[1:35:17] Pentecostals under the arms The Works
[1:35:19] deeds and so forth had to be Armenian
[1:35:22] had to be legalists but now we come to
[1:35:24] the Head the Capstone Grace Grace the
[1:35:27] Capstone cried The Headstone crying what
[1:35:30] Grace Grace passed from death and Creed
[1:35:33] into a Living Word of the Living God
[1:35:35] God's only provided plan for his age his
[1:35:38] sons in the word age quickened by the
[1:35:41] spirit like a spark that's lit off of
[1:35:43] something to make it alive and seated
[1:35:46] now in Heavenly places in present tense
[1:35:48] already alive and subject to every
[1:35:52] promise in the word
[1:35:55] then what does that do you being a part
[1:35:57] of God's Gene a part of the word other
[1:35:59] men part of God's word seated together
[1:36:01] manifests the entire body of Christ
[1:36:05] because there's no living among you
[1:36:08] ain't that right no one beliefs no
[1:36:10] Creeds nothing none of that you've been
[1:36:12] purged from that you've come out of her
[1:36:18] no living among you just the word only
[1:36:21] seated in Heavenly places in the door
[1:36:23] where he put his name Christ Jesus ain't
[1:36:25] that right
[1:36:27] so I want you to notice now the word
[1:36:28] birth and I hope this is all right but
[1:36:30] the word birth is not a repeat of
[1:36:32] Pentecost
[1:36:35] hello
[1:36:37] brother Bram says this because I I want
[1:36:40] you to understand
[1:36:42] he says now let us see what happened
[1:36:44] when God in his time and age and His
[1:36:48] prophets are not considered just
[1:36:50] depending on theology priests
[1:36:53] denominationalism like we do today
[1:36:55] now closely it all gets messed up
[1:37:01] when you don't consider God you don't
[1:37:03] consider His prophets
[1:37:05] you don't consider his word and you lean
[1:37:07] on to priests
[1:37:08] documents seminaries
[1:37:10] educate all them things it all gets
[1:37:13] messed up
[1:37:15] if the true spirit of God there
[1:37:18] it'll direct it into the word
[1:37:21] not just one place in the word but the
[1:37:25] entire word for the entire age
[1:37:28] now the day of Pentecost the spirit
[1:37:31] directed it right into that to Joe 238
[1:37:34] right
[1:37:35] so that's why Peter can look and say
[1:37:37] this experience is Joel 2 38.
[1:37:40] ain't that right
[1:37:41] but all the other scriptures lay dormant
[1:37:45] because I wasn't for them
[1:37:47] right so he said the day of Luther it
[1:37:50] directed it into that Wesley in this
[1:37:54] last Pentecostal move but this everybody
[1:37:56] say this is another age this is the
[1:38:00] calling out of the Bride not 2 000 years
[1:38:03] ago at Pentecost or the repeat or the
[1:38:06] return
[1:38:08] then you say Amen now brother Brown said
[1:38:11] the word that fell on the day of
[1:38:12] Pentecost will not work this day
[1:38:15] no sir that was for Pentecost this is
[1:38:19] for the bride going home of the Bride
[1:38:22] now I got to tell you this now the word
[1:38:24] that they had on Pentecost did not make
[1:38:26] them Rapture Ready
[1:38:30] they had a word birth
[1:38:33] Joel 2 38 this is that
[1:38:37] but it did not bring all the word into
[1:38:40] fullness
[1:38:42] true ain't that right
[1:38:44] so he says see we got something
[1:38:46] different
[1:38:48] aren't you glad why we needed more faith
[1:38:52] than ever
[1:38:53] we needed rapturing faith
[1:38:55] we needed Faith to change these bodies
[1:38:58] that's why they couldn't
[1:39:01] they were only a seed but yet that seed
[1:39:05] had to die
[1:39:07] and wrought
[1:39:09] or you wouldn't be here
[1:39:13] and you say man
[1:39:15] so he says the Pentecostals represented
[1:39:18] that again we're in the bright age no
[1:39:20] more than the word of Noah would work in
[1:39:23] the days of Moses no more than Moses law
[1:39:25] would have worked in the time of Paul
[1:39:27] here he tried to tell him you're dead to
[1:39:30] that you cannot have that now now
[1:39:31] brother Brandon does you know
[1:39:34] he talks about how the word them that
[1:39:36] word and Noah that word in Moses that
[1:39:38] word would not work in Jesus today
[1:39:41] but Jesus did not isolate himself from
[1:39:44] them scriptures
[1:39:45] he actually fulfilled them
[1:39:48] and you say man they spoke of him
[1:39:51] but he didn't go around telling
[1:39:53] everybody build an ark he was the ark
[1:39:58] ain't that right
[1:40:00] he didn't go tell everybody get out of
[1:40:01] Egypt we're going to a promised land no
[1:40:03] he was trying to get them out of another
[1:40:06] age
[1:40:06] [Music]
[1:40:08] the dispensation of law into Grace
[1:40:11] and you say man so he told them if if
[1:40:14] you really knew Moses you would know me
[1:40:17] for his spoken me
[1:40:20] but he didn't do what Moses done in the
[1:40:22] sins of or and Noah build the ark or
[1:40:25] call everybody say let's get out of
[1:40:27] Egypt
[1:40:28] that he was doing the ministry of it
[1:40:32] everybody had to get in Christ to live
[1:40:35] ever I everybody had to come out of
[1:40:37] dispensation of law to come into Grace
[1:40:41] can you say Amen
[1:40:42] and so here we find why won't now listen
[1:40:46] he says the word that fell at Pentecost
[1:40:48] won't work today why
[1:40:51] because the enemy that you're fighting
[1:40:53] is greater
[1:40:56] and you say man can you believe that the
[1:40:59] enemy that you're fighting is greater
[1:41:01] than they fought in the first church
[1:41:04] so if you go listen to putting on the
[1:41:07] whole armor of God
[1:41:09] Brother Brad I'm remember the the Bible
[1:41:11] says that when the enemy comes in like a
[1:41:13] flood
[1:41:14] the enemy did not come in like a flood
[1:41:16] on the day of Pentecost
[1:41:18] the enemy did not come in like a flood
[1:41:20] in any age but this age
[1:41:23] remember the two thousand thousand
[1:41:25] hundred thousand thousand demons have
[1:41:28] been held at Bay until this time
[1:41:33] then you go listen to the Feast of the
[1:41:34] trumpets and the prophet says now
[1:41:36] they've been Unleashed all the
[1:41:38] ecclesiastical Powers have been
[1:41:40] Unleashed ain't that right so we're
[1:41:43] fighting a greater demon our greater
[1:41:45] enemy has the enemy has come in like a
[1:41:48] flood but then the Bible says he would
[1:41:51] raise up the standard the spirit of the
[1:41:54] Lord would raise up a standard and you
[1:41:55] know what brother Rams says how he'd
[1:41:57] make that standard by making the word
[1:41:59] become more real and real and real can
[1:42:03] you say Amen so we could not fight the
[1:42:06] enemy that we have today just off one
[1:42:08] scripture
[1:42:11] all right I hope that's okay to you but
[1:42:14] it's the word is becoming more real in
[1:42:19] other words you are becoming more real
[1:42:21] of what this word said
[1:42:24] he cannot stop you
[1:42:26] he can never defy this or stop the word
[1:42:29] he'll never kill it out the word is in
[1:42:32] the bride
[1:42:33] Joel 2 38 was in that little bride on
[1:42:37] the day of Pentecost but look at the
[1:42:39] word today that's in the bride
[1:42:43] that's good
[1:42:45] it's it's there
[1:42:49] read the story of Esther
[1:42:52] it's you
[1:42:54] read the story of Ruth and Boaz it's you
[1:42:57] read the story of LEDs are getting a
[1:43:00] bride it's you
[1:43:02] she said yes that's you
[1:43:05] she said I'll go that's you
[1:43:07] she didn't only get the gifts she got
[1:43:09] the bridegroom
[1:43:11] she got Isaac that's you
[1:43:16] Hallelujah
[1:43:21] so yes we've had a word birth
[1:43:24] there ain't you realize there ain't no
[1:43:26] other birth
[1:43:35] now
[1:43:36] so does this word birth does it do away
[1:43:38] with the new birth no it is the new
[1:43:40] birth
[1:43:41] does that mean
[1:43:43] because the word that did not that fell
[1:43:46] on Pentecost
[1:43:47] doesn't apply today does that do away
[1:43:49] with the emotions
[1:43:51] nope
[1:43:52] doesn't do away with the nine spiritual
[1:43:54] gifts nope
[1:43:56] who put the gifts in the church
[1:44:00] who took him out of the church
[1:44:04] who put them back in the church
[1:44:08] God
[1:44:12] did Brother Brown do away with the
[1:44:14] Pentecostal experience
[1:44:15] nope
[1:44:18] but the word that they had was what
[1:44:21] prophet the prophet Joel promised
[1:44:24] and that church was a virgin with the
[1:44:27] word
[1:44:29] not inspired by man
[1:44:31] this was God himself
[1:44:33] the supernatural
[1:44:35] but notice again
[1:44:38] what they received Joel 2 38 become
[1:44:41] fulfilled it did not bring rapturing
[1:44:44] Faith to them
[1:44:45] it did not bring them into the adoption
[1:44:47] of sons
[1:44:48] Acts 2 38 was based off that experience
[1:44:51] on the day of Pentecost but it was not
[1:44:53] adoption of sons
[1:44:57] it's true because even after after Paul
[1:45:01] says we're looking for him we're waiting
[1:45:03] all the the Earth is moaning and
[1:45:06] groaning waiting for the manifestation
[1:45:08] of the sons of God
[1:45:11] ain't that right see what they received
[1:45:14] that word birth that they received acts
[1:45:16] Joel 2 38 it did not bring it was not
[1:45:20] the third pool Ministry that they
[1:45:21] received
[1:45:23] ain't that right it was not the Capstone
[1:45:26] that came to them
[1:45:29] headstone can you say man what they what
[1:45:33] happened on the day of Pentecost was not
[1:45:35] the mighty angel coming down with an
[1:45:37] open book
[1:45:40] ain't that right the word was not open
[1:45:43] fully to them
[1:45:47] ain't that right
[1:45:49] nope we still needed Malachi 4.
[1:45:54] it did not bring Malachi 4.
[1:45:56] what happened on the day of Pentecost
[1:45:58] did not settle all scriptures there was
[1:46:01] still them scriptures still waiting
[1:46:06] to bring the seed back to Restoration
[1:46:10] you and I
[1:46:13] ain't ain't that right
[1:46:15] notice Daniel 12 4 but thou Daniel shut
[1:46:19] up the words and seal the book
[1:46:22] until the day of Pentecost
[1:46:27] sell the book even to the time of the
[1:46:29] end and many shall run to and fro and
[1:46:32] knowledge shall be increased when does
[1:46:35] this scripture fulfilled today
[1:46:38] ain't that right they weren't running to
[1:46:41] enfro knowledge wasn't increasing it's
[1:46:44] right now we are in the days of Noah
[1:46:47] right now where knowledge has come to
[1:46:50] its highest peak right now and people
[1:46:54] are running to and fro trying to find
[1:46:55] the answers of the truth amen why the
[1:46:59] world's come to its end all right we're
[1:47:01] at the end of the Nations we're at the
[1:47:03] end of time we're at the end of humanity
[1:47:05] as we know it today and people are
[1:47:07] trying to find the answers to keep it
[1:47:09] continuing but we're at the end
[1:47:12] and all their education all their
[1:47:15] knowledge ain't helping them it is not
[1:47:17] providing the knowledge
[1:47:24] brother Brown said Daniel had prophesied
[1:47:26] these things it sought in a vision
[1:47:29] and the angel come down to seal the
[1:47:31] vision and to seal the prophecy they can
[1:47:33] read it but cannot understand it till
[1:47:36] the end time but aren't you glad we're
[1:47:38] able to understand
[1:47:39] we're able to understand
[1:47:42] not by a seminary knowledge but by word
[1:47:45] birth
[1:47:46] can you say man
[1:47:48] by profit in the age has come see the
[1:47:52] prophet said the end time message shall
[1:47:54] reveal it
[1:47:55] the last Church age
[1:47:57] so here the the Pentecostal uh the day
[1:48:00] of Pentecost was now not even the
[1:48:02] beginning of the first church h
[1:48:04] it was the beginning of the Church of
[1:48:06] the Living God
[1:48:08] ain't that right the church age started
[1:48:10] several years after and here the prophet
[1:48:13] said and the message end time message
[1:48:15] will reveal well that book will be open
[1:48:18] and the Mysteries that was hit up in
[1:48:21] this that no man they could talk about
[1:48:23] it they could not understand it but the
[1:48:25] message in this end time in the last age
[1:48:28] would reveal it now we've got an open
[1:48:31] book
[1:48:31] [Music]
[1:48:34] see the Revelation had to wait until our
[1:48:36] day and then you find even John after
[1:48:39] Pentecost
[1:48:41] after the day of Pentecost was told to
[1:48:43] seal up the book
[1:48:45] while he was seeing things
[1:48:48] amen he heard the he heard the seven
[1:48:50] Thunders utter
[1:48:51] he saw the symbols right
[1:48:54] and yet he was told in other words don't
[1:48:56] explain it John
[1:48:58] keep quiet about it write about the
[1:49:00] symbols tell what you saw but that's it
[1:49:04] keep it closed
[1:49:07] right
[1:49:09] till the end time
[1:49:11] till the end time
[1:49:14] but on the day of Pentecost they did
[1:49:15] receive the word birth
[1:49:17] for their experience was right in line
[1:49:19] with scriptures
[1:49:21] can you say man
[1:49:23] it was scripture fulfilled
[1:49:25] yes sir that was the alpha the beginning
[1:49:28] of the church God planted a Pentecostal
[1:49:31] seed that day and the potential was
[1:49:33] there don't get me wrong the potential
[1:49:35] there was there for a Rapture but it
[1:49:38] couldn't happen everything that the seed
[1:49:41] becomes the Potentials in the seed
[1:49:44] all the apples that will come forth was
[1:49:46] in the seed can you say man that's
[1:49:49] exactly right you can't add two or take
[1:49:51] away it's all right there
[1:49:53] in the seed ain't that right so so you
[1:49:56] read the book of Acts you see what
[1:49:57] potential they had
[1:50:01] yeah yeah all that potential was laying
[1:50:04] there we see it
[1:50:06] but the seed had yet to die and rot
[1:50:10] ain't that right so they could not bring
[1:50:13] forth manifestation of sons
[1:50:16] until the seed rotted
[1:50:20] so remember I hope this is all right
[1:50:23] remember in the vision brother Branham
[1:50:25] saw the Omega Church as being the
[1:50:27] exactly
[1:50:29] the same as the alpha Church
[1:50:33] and most of us know what the vision was
[1:50:36] so I'm not going to read the whole thing
[1:50:39] my brother Branham saw the first church
[1:50:41] pass
[1:50:42] by in view
[1:50:45] and she went over the hill or around
[1:50:47] something but
[1:50:49] she disappeared
[1:50:51] and then
[1:50:54] he said the worldly Church
[1:50:56] come past before him and was so vulgar
[1:51:00] and he says when she passed by like that
[1:51:02] I looked at her and I just got real
[1:51:04] faint and I just turned around and I
[1:51:06] thought oh God I'm condemned
[1:51:08] there's no need of me trying any now
[1:51:10] just just might as well just quit
[1:51:13] then after that he said the same bride
[1:51:16] everybody say the same bride
[1:51:18] that went in the first come back around
[1:51:21] again
[1:51:22] they got you
[1:51:25] and here come them little ladies again
[1:51:27] each of them was dressed in their
[1:51:28] National Garb from where they come from
[1:51:31] Switzerland like Switzerland Germany and
[1:51:33] so forth each one wearing that kind of
[1:51:35] Garb all long hair just exactly like the
[1:51:38] one at the first
[1:51:40] and then another place he says when she
[1:51:42] walked by she's she's exactly like the
[1:51:45] one was in the first place walking to
[1:51:48] the step of the music of God's word
[1:51:50] marching on see that first church did
[1:51:53] that new birth was exactly right with
[1:51:55] scriptures everything they'd done was
[1:51:57] exactly right with scriptures can you
[1:51:59] say Amen they've done marked at Mark 16
[1:52:02] exactly right with scriptures and here
[1:52:04] we are here we are again passed by he
[1:52:07] saw us he saw your church and you was
[1:52:10] marching right in step with the word
[1:52:13] like they did
[1:52:17] that's right
[1:52:18] word for their day word for our day
[1:52:21] ain't that right
[1:52:22] notice the difference
[1:52:25] they walk in the word for their day we
[1:52:27] walk in the word for our day but the
[1:52:29] difference is we go up
[1:52:31] he saw this bride not turn the corner
[1:52:33] like the first one she started going up
[1:52:35] marching up until she disappeared
[1:52:39] you're living in the age of rapture
[1:52:42] why because it's time for it
[1:52:45] it's Harvest Time
[1:52:49] it's harvest time he can pluck you now
[1:52:53] you can kidnap you
[1:52:56] right
[1:52:58] brother Brandon said see
[1:53:00] and I think I've read this but he said
[1:53:02] it's the weed age friend it's the wheat
[1:53:05] there's a Ministry on Earth there's a
[1:53:07] Ministry on Earth that's just like the
[1:53:11] one that went into the ground back
[1:53:12] Yonder at the beginning a real Pentecost
[1:53:17] experience
[1:53:19] now what is the Pentecostal experience
[1:53:23] you know what program said it is it's
[1:53:25] the word being made flesh in you
[1:53:30] and you say man his word made flesh he
[1:53:34] said Are you ashamed of of saying of Are
[1:53:37] you ashamed of Divine Healing
[1:53:39] Are you ashamed of the Full Gospel Are
[1:53:42] you ashamed of your Pentecostal
[1:53:44] experience that's being ashamed of his
[1:53:46] word for that's his word made flesh in
[1:53:47] you
[1:53:49] can you say Amen now his word has to
[1:53:53] live out in for every generation
[1:53:56] like it did in the first stage there was
[1:53:58] a promise there for them
[1:54:00] but we're at the end of the age and
[1:54:02] everything of this Bible
[1:54:05] has been laying for you
[1:54:07] and it has to live
[1:54:11] now you can't you you can't this can't
[1:54:13] live without a Pentecostal experience
[1:54:15] that is the Pentecostal experience it's
[1:54:18] the word in you
[1:54:20] can you say man
[1:54:22] so brother Brown said Pentecost is the
[1:54:25] only thing that's going to prove
[1:54:27] Christianity
[1:54:30] not legalism
[1:54:32] not the way you dress not the way you
[1:54:35] live and act going to church and all of
[1:54:37] that
[1:54:38] oh that's part of it
[1:54:42] the thing is that proves it it's
[1:54:43] Pentecost
[1:54:45] it takes a Pentecost experience to prove
[1:54:49] God
[1:54:51] and that's to each individual it does
[1:54:53] not prove the organization it proves the
[1:54:57] individual
[1:54:59] can you say Amen
[1:55:01] so I'm I'm going to read that I'm going
[1:55:03] to let you go
[1:55:04] got got a lot more but I I don't want to
[1:55:07] keep you but brother Brown you know it
[1:55:10] was in the message invisible Union of
[1:55:12] the Bride that brother Branham made that
[1:55:15] statement the word that fell on the day
[1:55:17] of Pentecost will not work for this day
[1:55:19] but notice that doesn't mean that we act
[1:55:22] different from the way they acted
[1:55:24] it doesn't mean that the experience of
[1:55:27] Pentecost has changed it doesn't mean
[1:55:30] the last commission that Jesus gave to
[1:55:32] the church has changed brother Branham
[1:55:34] says this the church began at Pentecost
[1:55:36] with the Pentecostal blessing and was
[1:55:38] ordained by Jesus Christ to continue on
[1:55:42] until the last day with the same message
[1:55:45] and the same blessing working in US
[1:55:49] can you say man
[1:55:50] so we believe in a Pentecostal
[1:55:52] experience we believe in the pillar of
[1:55:54] fire we believe in the Dynamics we
[1:55:57] believe in the quickening of the uh uh
[1:56:00] of of of our body ain't that right
[1:56:03] so then he goes on to tell us that the
[1:56:05] last commission is the message that is
[1:56:07] to continue and and and that message is
[1:56:11] the last commission he says now in in
[1:56:13] the message things that are to be 65
[1:56:16] brother random quotes the last
[1:56:17] commission and then he says remember he
[1:56:20] said that now you know what the
[1:56:22] commission is right you owe you into all
[1:56:24] the world and preach the gospel and and
[1:56:25] and these signs shall follow them that
[1:56:28] believe right he that believer shall be
[1:56:30] saved those that believe not shall be
[1:56:31] damned these signs shall follow them
[1:56:33] that believe in my name you shall cast
[1:56:35] out devils and all that so he's quoted
[1:56:38] this and he says now remember he said
[1:56:41] that
[1:56:42] that has to be everybody say that has to
[1:56:45] be
[1:56:46] he wouldn't have said that Lester's
[1:56:50] going to be somebody could catch that
[1:56:52] word
[1:56:55] the house is going to catch that word
[1:56:57] he said it
[1:57:00] so when we say the word that felon
[1:57:02] Pentecost will not work for today that's
[1:57:04] not disqualifying mark 16.
[1:57:07] that's not disqualifying the the last
[1:57:10] Commission
[1:57:12] and can you say Amen
[1:57:15] see so and yet that is the same word the
[1:57:19] first church caught
[1:57:20] for a look at the book of Acts they did
[1:57:23] it
[1:57:26] and it's the same word that you will
[1:57:28] catch
[1:57:30] because it's the supernatural God
[1:57:32] working
[1:57:35] proving himself in the church and you
[1:57:38] say man
[1:57:39] if the musicians will come
[1:57:41] brother Bram talked of the minister who
[1:57:43] told the people that the Pentecostal
[1:57:45] religion was nothing but a sham
[1:57:48] not to listen to it it was unstable said
[1:57:50] any man that spoke in tongues and these
[1:57:52] things and claimed to be healed the sick
[1:57:54] and so forth by prayer that it was to
[1:57:56] leave away from it and to pray for those
[1:57:58] poor decrepit people because they were
[1:58:00] in an illusion
[1:58:03] that there was something wrong with them
[1:58:04] he said oh hi I'd like to have talked to
[1:58:06] that brother just a while
[1:58:09] and he said that was only given for the
[1:58:11] apostles at the day of Pentecost and
[1:58:13] that was all
[1:58:15] brother Bram goes on to say but I find
[1:58:17] that 30 years after the day of Pentecost
[1:58:19] Paul was ordaining these gifts in the
[1:58:21] church
[1:58:22] First Corinthians 15 he said in the
[1:58:26] church the gifts of speaking in tongues
[1:58:28] Miracles and all these other gifts was
[1:58:30] said in the church
[1:58:32] Jesus said that go into all the world
[1:58:34] preach the gospel to Every Creature how
[1:58:35] far all the world to who
[1:58:38] Every Creature they've never received it
[1:58:40] yet see and these signs shall follow
[1:58:43] them that believe
[1:58:46] how long all the world to who Every
[1:58:49] Creature these signs shall follow them
[1:58:51] in all the world and in every creature
[1:58:54] these signs shall follow them in my name
[1:58:58] they shall cast out Devils speak with
[1:58:59] new tongues if they'd taken up a deadly
[1:59:02] thing or serpent or drinking a deadly
[1:59:04] thing it will not harm them they'll lay
[1:59:06] hands on the sick they shall recover
[1:59:08] that was his last commission to the
[1:59:10] church mark 16. right
[1:59:14] I will say
[1:59:16] that experience that they received Joel
[1:59:19] 2 38 brought this scripture to life
[1:59:22] and so will it in this age
[1:59:25] the experience that you receive
[1:59:28] of the words word coming to life will
[1:59:30] bring this to life right
[1:59:35] now he says see so
[1:59:39] this which is already received already
[1:59:42] or he says see Paul is ordaining these
[1:59:44] gifts into the church 30 years later
[1:59:46] late and said in Galatians 1 8 if an
[1:59:49] angel from heaven preaches to you any
[1:59:51] other gospel than this which is already
[1:59:53] received already been preached let him
[1:59:55] be accursed I believe that Pentecost
[1:59:58] began without an ending I believe it's
[2:00:00] to be to every creature all times at all
[2:00:02] places that Pentecost should always
[2:00:04] remain the Pentecostal blessings should
[2:00:08] be upon the people can you see me
[2:00:13] so when brother Brown says the word that
[2:00:16] failed on the day of Pentecost will not
[2:00:18] work for this day you've got to be
[2:00:20] careful in how we interpret it
[2:00:22] [Music]
[2:00:24] because in that same message brother
[2:00:26] Brown tells us that every Son of God
[2:00:28] will act like they did on the day of
[2:00:29] Pentecost
[2:00:31] same message
[2:00:34] brother Brian says every son will act
[2:00:37] like they did on the day of Pentecost
[2:00:42] another thing
[2:00:45] he says what kind of children
[2:00:47] she is bearing talking about the church
[2:00:50] that tells what their papa is whether
[2:00:53] it's the first Adam or the second Adam
[2:00:55] if the church brings forth the child of
[2:00:59] the second Adam Christ he acts the
[2:01:02] second Adam way of acting like they did
[2:01:05] on the day of Pentecost
[2:01:08] that's the really true second Adams
[2:01:12] children
[2:01:13] foreign
[2:01:15] [Music]
[2:01:17] another place he said the alpha
[2:01:21] has become Omega
[2:01:23] amen
[2:01:24] the first come last and the last is the
[2:01:28] first
[2:01:29] the seed that went in has come through a
[2:01:33] process and become the seed again
[2:01:36] the seed that fell in the Garden of Eden
[2:01:38] and died there come back and from that
[2:01:40] imperfect seed that died there come back
[2:01:42] to the perfect sea the second Adam and
[2:01:45] the first seed that fell and was used in
[2:01:47] the second uh coming as bringing forth
[2:01:50] the child now has become the true bride
[2:01:53] again the seed right back with the
[2:01:56] original word oh do you love him
[2:02:00] isn't the Lord wonderful
[2:02:02] oh just to know who we are we are that
[2:02:06] Original Seed
[2:02:07] Hallelujah
[2:02:09] there's no mixing up with it
[2:02:16] when you really believe that word and
[2:02:18] the word becomes a life to you
[2:02:21] becomes life
[2:02:24] it'll make you act strange like it did
[2:02:26] them
[2:02:28] it'll Quicken your mortal body like it
[2:02:30] did then
[2:02:32] it'll bring it all right in line with
[2:02:34] scriptures like it did for them
[2:02:36] can you say man Church we're going home
[2:02:40] and I'm so glad for it and there's
[2:02:43] something that already bearing witness
[2:02:44] in my spirit that I'm going I'm one of
[2:02:49] them
[2:02:50] Hallelujah and I trust that it's the way
[2:02:52] with you today
[2:02:53] amen what song
[2:02:57] [Music]
[2:02:58] of the Lord
[2:03:02] there's nothing like the prisons
[2:03:07] nothing like the presence
[2:03:11] nothing like the presence of the Lord
