it's certainly good to be here in the house of the Lord and the musicians can be dismissed and uh just good to uh see everyone pressing on Amen fighting a good fight of Faith amen and certainly the Lord is good to us amen and I want to say it's just good to be back um in the house of the Lord at the home Church church and um we had a just a wonderful time uh in the Lord and uh good fellowship with Brother Steve and sister Elizabeth amen and uh I think it took us about 26 hours to get there and um so anyways we got very well acquainted with each other amen and uh so they uh they were kind enough to put up with Judah and I and especially Judah and so uh we thank the Lord for that amen and so um if you have your Bibles will turn to the Book of Matthew the 24th chapter amen uh seems like a lot has happened since we've been gone got a new granddaughter for one so this is a plus and um can't wait to see her of course and um uh but glad um everything's going good with them and and good to have sister Mindy back with with us and little hadessa is that right hadessa hadassa amen better get it right hadasa and uh so I hadn't um I don't um well I I did see her briefly the little hadasa briefly before we left but it's certainly good to see Mindy and and she's recovering well in the baby and and then of course brother shemiah and sister Bethany having their baby and uh man that is just that's just so wonderful am amen and the Lord is just truly good isn't he amen and uh heard yall had some good services and uh while we were gone so we're thankful to the Lord and um I feel like uh the the services up there in uh Santa Fe were um successful in that the people were encouraged uplifted and you know um amen uh the church there was affected you know uh personally uh when uh uh Tim Humes had left and things and of course uh Church in Santa Fe and the church there in um in North Carolina uh they they were really intermingled the people and friends and things like that so um uh they they were hit pretty hard when all this went down and and they hadn't had a meeting um like that since uh 2019 and uh so you know and and uh just just things just had transpired and uh but it was just really good to see that the people still are pressing the battle and um uh you know the might of um of course you you go through a a a slump a drought or whatever you want to call that and uh really if I could say it this way like well brother Manuel said you know it really shook Us in that it got us to really digging it really got us to thinking it really got as a church you know what do we really believe and um When the Smoke cleared they were still standing and um he said they're more solid about this message and convinced about the message than ever before and so we're really thankful to the Lord for that and uh the brothers uh brother Wendell brother Andrew brother Jonathan brother Doug they they were just really anointed and um just a lot of good word uh there and um solidified the message to the people's hearts and so we're thankful for that the Lord is certainly good to us isn't he amen amen he's so faithful to his word and and uh before we go into the word may we just bow our hearts and talk to the Lord amen father Lord it it is just uh good to be back home with uh the Saints here I thank you for uh what you done Lord there in New Mexico and and keeping us safe Lord and bringing us home safe father I I thank you Lord that you're preserving a people all around the world Lord and that Satan cannot touch no matter what battles they go through and the fire and the Lord whatever it would be lord they're going to stand oh we're so thankful for that father now we just pray that you would bless the reading of your word the ministering Lord and may we just uh be all lifted up in Heavenly places father if there's anything Lord that would be displeasing to you in our lives we would ask that you'd forgive us of them oh Father draw us closer to you we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen amen amen uh just a simple um scripture we but powerful Matthew 24 and 35 but it says Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away can you say that with me Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away you can have your seats this evening and um you know I I just thinking of this of course the trip and and um you know when you looking and and that we we there was a diverse group of people there and um some had come out of uh really um sad situations whether it be um dictatorship in the church and where person can't even buy a car without asking the pastor you know for his approval or whether it be you know one believing in deity and and this you know of course when you have a meeting you got all kind kind of of uh people coming and uh and yet uh you know the people are are coming out of these situations and they're hungering for truth they they want to know they want to know more about God Amen and it it then you know thinking of brother shmaya and sister Bethany I uh when he uh told me he uh kept me in updated about the situation and and um you know let me know you know uh that the baby that was here and and things I I you know I I couldn't help but just shed a tear or two just a thinking of what God had truly done am what a miracle and uh you know as we know and um those those of you that have been here uh you know a lot longer than I have um but knowing the the testimony knowing the confession that they had that God was going to give them a child and just looking totally impossible and uh and yet staying strong and I'm not saying they didn't have discouragements and all of that but uh uh they they kept look to God look to that word and today you know what we witness is a miracle that God keeps his word amen and that is something that we can rest uh assured on on anything uh more than anything else is that God is faithful to his word uh but you know it's it's the word it's it's the the word that is infallible it's the word of God it's the only thing that we can cling to and and no wonder the devil tries to get us get the people of God so distracted and looking to other things uh because the word of God is the only lasting thing that will that that will help and and so uh you know a thinking of what brother brandham had said um uh uh in one place he tells well in several places God is obligated to his word can you say that with me God is obligated to his word I I think that's powerful if you ever just thought of why we're standing here why you're still serving the lord it's because God is obligated to his word you realize the times that you know uh uh people go through things that you go through and and and yet they end their lives uh maybe uh uh or they just go into just utter Despair and and and all of these things but why why don't we go into despair why why why are we still pressing on you know it is a flat miracle that we're still serving the lord it it is a it's an absolute miracle that you got young people serving the lord uh today and really got a desire to serve God Amen it's a miracle but but what makes that Miracle the same God that made a miracle for brother shemaya and sister Bethany is the same God that made a miracle for us it's a miracle that we're still believing this message look look at all the the the the negative that we've heard about the message I don't know about you but I've heard a lot of negative about the message and and you know and yet yet I hear the same stories that other people hear I see the the same things that other people see but that doesn't move me at all and yet other people get discouraged they get and finally they walk away and say there's nothing to it and and and these things but but why why why is because God is obligated to his word and and so we we look at that um uh then what is in his word well his word uh uh they promises every scripture every page of this Bible are promises do you believe that it's it's promises that that we can we can cling our soul to uh uh with with all of our heart but this word has been a mystery because you think well you know I I just thinking of God being faithful well you know we know he's faithful to his word but what does that word mean to us what what is the word of God to us you know is it just a book of history is a book of poem love is it you know there's there's people that find benefit uh to this Bible uh people military um our nation has studied a lot of the national or uh of of of the Bible in of the biblical Wars and things like that and they gleaned things from from that and found benefit uh uh and and and and you got money people that that teach on money and all that and they find their their their uh biblical principles the principles of their teaching is based upon the word of God and and they get benefit from that and and so many people around the world uh that get benefit just from uh the scriptures there but what is the real meaning of these scriptures why promises what why are they laying here for so we can get benefits from it and and things like that well you know as we know as message Believers we we know that the word of God has been a mystery it's it's been shut up uh uh you know be since the foundation of the world if we could said that way and uh um you know Roman or Revelations the 5th chapter talks about it being sealed with Seven Seals and if you could maybe uh Revelations 51 pull that up uh uh and and we all know it but I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book now we all know this book it's it's it's it's the content if if I'm just going to say it that way if we can uh look at it um uh it's the revelation of what is in this Bible praise the Lord can you say amen amen and and so uh uh uh so it was sealed up on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and and so as as we know it was in the hands of him that sat upon the throne it it was the title deed and and if you've listened to the SE Seven Seals and and other messages brother Brandon really goes into what that book is and what it means and it was you know Adam being having dominion and all these things he had the title deed to the Earth he had the title deed to to eternal life he had the title deed to these things he forfeited all of that amen when he fell but the book the title deed it the abstract uh it all went back to the hands of God the original own ain't that right amen and so Satan on the earth he's squatting on the earth and uh uh he has no right to the Earth but but he's able he's just a squatter he does not have the title deed to the Earth or uh to anything that's right but but it so the prophet says that this book is in the hands of him that sat upon the throne waiting for Redemption claims amen waiting it was a bloody bleeding lamb that came and took the book amen so so uh but it was waiting for Redemption claims no man was worthy to open it as we all know which brother Brandon would tell us that if the book wasn't open it meant that all creation was lost all the hopes of men were lost all the church going and all the the the uh professing Christianity and talking about heaven and and Millennium and all these things it was just it would it was all in vain it that book had to be open ain't that right and and and then we find there in Revelations 5 and and six uh it talks about the lamb coming and and opening the book and and uh uh and and he loose the seals thereof and and and then John talks about the U uh that everyone you know the angel began to cry out the elders began to sing and and all of these things and what a jubilee that took place because the book became open ain't that right now John had wept uh remember he was weeping he said I wept because no man was found worthy to open the book Someone told brother Brandon well he wept because he wasn't worthy himself to open the book and that wasn't the case it it was because that that without the book being opened everything was lost all mankind was lost everything was lost right and and so we we find that then then the Jubilee the worship began to take place and there was no negativity there was no there was no grumbling there was no complaining there was no it it was true worship it brother Ram said it King glamb worship because that book meant something the opening of that book and and then John found him self worshiping he he was no longer The Spectator watching this scene he stepped into it and he began to worship and he says all the creatures in Heaven and Earth and underneath and they all heard I John saying Glory blessings and honor and and power to the lamb ain't that right well now then then why would John worship what was why why did he get so moved by the opening of the book and and brother Brandon says it's because John saw his name he was able now to look up on the book and he goes ah there's John that's me you know I'm part of it so then every promise as I've said I just you know every page of the book every every promise that was given to the church uh uh from beginning to the end amen John could see his name amen he could now identify amen him self in the book so now he's part of the book he realizes he's part of the promise can you say Amen so Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will never pass away do you realize what that Revelation meant to John when he saw himself as being part of the book of the word of God that meant you know everything would come against him well Jesus even said you know Upon This Rock revelation of Jesus Christ I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it water Revelation John realizing that he wasn't just having a revelation of some historical figure of 2,000 years ago but he had the Revelation that it was him amen Christ in you the hope of glory can you say Amen I'm part of this I'm just as predestinated as Jesus Christ was I am just as part of God as Jesus Christ was I'm part of the book just as much as Jesus Christ was amen every promise that spoke of Messiah Jesus was there to fulfill it amen so much that he was part of that book amen that the prophet said he could have raised on that first day he could have raised on that second day but what stopped him he was part of the book and the book says he would not raise on the first day he would not raise on the second day amen but on that third day there was nothing that was going to hold him back because the book said he would rise the book said amen God would honor that word can you say amen amen so that was the Revelation that John saw now we know that brother Ram says that John is a type of the Bride he's a type of this last day bride he's a type of you and I can you say Amen oh my amen now to think of it amen when the book was open amen the lamb came to open the book amen now John is showing our response once that Revelation strikes our heart amen John was no longer weeping John was no longer having his head down and just I just don't know what to do he got such a revelation amen that of him being part of that book let all hell come he would stand let all things come against him but he would stand amen because he was part of something bigger than himself well that's what you and I are we're part of something bigger than ourselves we're part of something bigger than politics we are part of something bigger than just religion we are part of something so much greater than death amen and trials and sickness and suffering can you say Amen yes sir amen so John amen he was caught up in this last day on The Lord's day and this is what he saw unfold the lamb come and open the book now what John saw church if we could if God would just help us get that Revelation in our soul amen is what John saw is what happened in 1963 the lamb came and opened the book but notice now it does not say in Revelations 5 what what caused John to see his name amen it it does not really Express all these things all we know is is the Lamb open the book and and everybody began to worship the Angels the elders and then John began to worship but then but we find that there was something that happened between the the the lamb opening the book and John seeing his name if we could say it that way amen because we're looking at at at you and I amen see if you had this book amen you you you you know everybody's got a Bible these days everybody reads this Bible you you talk to different ones well I've got a bible plan I've got a yearly plan to read this Bible once a year you know and a lot a lot a lot of people have read this book uh once a year they've read it they know it they they can tell you the stories of it they can tell you all of these things amen and still amen doesn't see their name in the book amen but what we see is a lamb Revelations 10:1 the mighty angel with an open book now he condens sin he descends from heaven with an open book not without the book but with the revelation of the book amen and and and and we know that at that coming at the same time of that coming there is a seventh angel on the earth amen a prophet can you say amen he could not be a theologian he could not be just a a philosopher or psychologist or whatever he had to be a prophet because the word of God would come to him amen and the prophet says that the mighty Angel gives the seventh angel the book why to reveal it to his people now Church how blessed we are to be sitting under the message of the seven Angel amen and to know that the seventh angel has sounded how many believes that we're not looking for the seventh angel to sound the seventh angel has sounded that's why we're not looking for another messenger we're not looking for another Prophet to come we're not looking for some other Revelation the message holds the key amen of this book Amen to reveal it to his people not to get us educated not to get us more refined but to reveal who we are in the book can you say amen amen every promise belongs to us do you believe that every promise belongs to us yes we're living in the in the worst AG ever the most evil hour ever but every promise belongs to to Shawn Martin amen I'm part of that book I'm part of God I'm part of deity deity is not in heaven it's in you oh thank God for the opening of the word amen to let us know who we are we are Miss Jesus Christ we're not just a church we're not just a a church member Amen brother brand says I no longer call you church I call you bride what is it people want to identify something they want to identify as a cat and they're identifying as this and identifying that but here come God him himself through the voice of a prophet and identifying us as his chosen bride because the lamb had opened the book can you say Amen so that's what these promises mean to us in this day do you believe that uh uh yes sir it's it's there and and so then we we find amen that there is going to be uh a a people now that's going to endure why amen because they're part of the word do you believe that no longer is this is this Bible just you know they they can burn this Bible and and and you know this Bible the the the pages are getting old things that's why I kind of leave it in my office and just because it's getting it's getting wore out you know and uh it's pretty bad he and and things but so this this will get old this will will is it's just paper but the content will never fail and the content is now becoming flesh do you believe that the content See and and that's That's what Satan don't understand the people don't understand the world don't understand Satan has been trying to get rid of the people Christians Believers for years trying to burn them to the Stak Flay them alive it doing everything he can amen but what he don't realize is every promise in this book will endure and I'm part of that promise God said he's going to have a bride without spot wrinkle or blemish I'm here and there will be nothing nothing that can destroy that can you say amen he can destroy this that I am the word I am the promise you are the word you're the promise amen you're the thing that God has been after can you he's not coming for a Bible he's coming for you you are the book you are the word can you say Amen yes sir he's coming for you now Revelations 129 it says the Great Dragon that old serpent called the devil and Satan deceiveth the whole world now that just looks that that's that's pretty uh uh discouraging if you just stop there it deceiver the whole world well then where am I what does that mean for us well Jesus said he that endure to the end the same that shall be shall be saved he that endure to the end so there's going to be a um the majority of the world be deceived amen by religion by politics by false promises by by all kinds of things but then there is a group of people that's going to endure but are they enduring in by themselves oh no look at the pressure that's on this bride look at the the the demons that have been loosed and poured out amen uh uh you know brother Doug Baker was talking about that and and how that them demons and how it was leased uh uh uh on the Jews and and and these things but then it it it now is being uh uh Unleashed upon the bride and he done the math you know and I don't I I I uh he's he's the smart one but he done the math and and uh things and and uh uh his equation was at the end of it is is per believer per bride member 37,000 I think that's what he said 38,000 or so demons up given to one individual that is part of this bride and and of course you know he's just doing math and he's not saying it's absolute you so so don't don't go there you know but but he's giv us the idea of the pressure that we are facing you're not just facing one little old demon you're not just facing two or three thousands of demons are are are are coming at you Amen to discourage you to break you to destroy you just to get you to recant and to get you to walk away from the message and and and and he's getting people all the time to walk away but there's a people that's going to endure amen but we're not facing this devil alone a there is no way we're we're not a match for the devil we're we we you you understand that try to fight him in your own nature try to fight him in your own self try to fight him in your own weakness and your own ability amen and all he can do you know you say well I'll fight him with my intellect well let him take your intellects away from you then then what are you going to do when you're in the nursing home or you're in you're you know people are going crazy these days you understand but he's invading amen but there is a people that's enduring now it's the of God that's going to endure Jesus already told us it's impossible for the elect to be deceived do you believe that amen it's impossible Jesus said that before this age ever got here you're living in the worst stage the greatest stage of deception and yet Jesus already declared in this age it would be impossible to deceive the the elect it's always been impossible to deceive the elect but in this age of the greatest age of deception is still imposs it's never changed Jesus has already declared it why because you're it's it's you're not just part of Faith Tabernacle you're not just far part of of of the of of a of a group called message Believers you are part of the word of God and cannot be deceived right do you believe that amen see now you know we may have been born Sinners and and and out in the world and and uh having the centner nature V nature under the condemnation of sin and death but as we know Paul says it it wasn't by our own choice amen that's right amen because according to Romans 8:20 he says we were made subject to vanity not willingly everybody say not willingly you were made subject to vanity you were made subject to trials you were made subject to weakness you were made subject to the sickness and and and and you were made subject to to feel you know even even spirits that try to bring on depression and and and and and and spirits that try to bring on unbelief and spirits that try to bring questions in your mind and and spirits that try to you know all of these things amen we were made subject to vanity not willingly see that God would make us subject to vanity for his own purpose for for even brother Bram told us you bypass that your theophany you bypass that word body and men to become flesh Amen to be tempted and tried and tested you realize the greatest uh victory that God has is in you amen yes sir Jesus had a great Victory amen when he conquered death hell in the grave and and and these things but he was not born the way you were born in the sense that he wasn't born a sinner he's not he was born flesh and blood can you say Amen but he was actually born uh uh with a uh not by a sex seed a defiled seed he was born a a created amen he was created in that womb of of Mary can you say Amen but here we are amen we are with a vile nature we were born Sinners we were rotten to the core from the the get-go of of our birth and and so we we we went from from uh uh attribute the prophet said and bypass the word body that theophany to be tempted and tried amen that's right we had to be tested we had to be tried to think of it what a victory Jesus had but what a greater Victory you have that was born of a woman born in sin born you didn't even stand a chance can you say Amen Satan had you from the get goal amen and and and and and and it tells and every baby that that comes and watch him start growing throws his temper tantrums and throws his fits and and and he bites and he lies and he this and he's that and and uh well even rock and roll begins to catch them and and and uh uh these things and because they're subject to these things TV catches them can you say Amen Hollywood catches them it's an attraction because there is a a nature in there that is so against God so vile but when God redeemed you amen and he brought you out of that change your nature change your desire change your way what a victory of his amen where it looked like you were Hellbound amen it looked like you was in despair Satan would able to was able to scar you by your past and mistakes and made you a victim of his and all that and God steps in and changes everything about you what a victory that is can you say Amen so yes we had to be tested and tried we had to know defeat and sorrow and failure amen but that's not our end for that's the only the temporary part of us I know you know these things but I'm going to remind you again that's just temporary that's a temporary part of you that's why we shouldn't dwell on these things don't dwell upon them things amen that's only temporary you're dwelling on things that is here to pass amen look at the things that's here to stay look at the things that's going to endure there's something about you that's enduring amen that's right yes sir because the same God that made us subject to vanity also subjected us to a hope you know the Bible doesn't call us defeated the Bible doesn't call us weak and begly the Bible doesn't call us low lives or worthless that's the devil that does that amen that's right notice 1 John 3:1 behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called defeated that we should be called vagabonds that we should just be called worthless and live like we're worthless and act like we're worthless and know that we should be called the sons of God and brother Brandon really makes that clear you are not going to be sons of God you are called sons of God now you're not going to be changed into sons of God you are son of God now he even goes back you always were the sons of God it's written in the book can you say Amen it's written in the book amen see so what we're doing is identifying ourselves amen with what the word of God says about us we're not identifying with what the devil has done to us we're not identifying with our past oh help us to walk away from our past amen and start living in the new we are a new creation we are a new people we are a new race a super race not a defeated race it's a new thing can you say Amen yes sir so we are called in Christ chosen in Christ faithful in Christ you know what brother Braham says they have been chosen before the foundation of the world and are abiding in their calling now you think of that he that endureth to the end not well I'm just going to be a preacher and I'm going to try to do everything I can and just just stay religious and have this religious form no we're abiding in our calling amen we are enduring in the thing that God has called us to can you say Amen oh man see that that means there there's more than just coming to church it's more than just being religious it's more than just being part of the choir and part of religious programs and all that oh my but there is a people that's been chosen before the foundation of the world and God has called them for this this position and that position and that position it's all in the word can you say amen and they are abiding in their calling yes sir and brother brand one place said they are the ones that resisted the devil's lie in the beginning think of that now you resisted the devil's lie in the beginning Hallelujah they shall overcome amen say it with me I shall overcome I shall overcome I shall overcome Shall Overcome no matter how bad it gets sir no matter how low we feel no matter how discouraged it looks amen I don't know about you but we can get discouraged I get discouraged I feel pretty low sometimes but I shall overcome amen I shall overcome My Flesh says he ain't going to overcome but I say I'm going to overcome it's already been written of me can you say amen I shall overcome Church look look at who you are amen just don't live life through humdrum amen we do not live live life like the world lives life we don't face our future like the world faces their future we don't act amen like the world does can you say Amen we've got a bright future we've got a secure future we got a every promise in the book is mine because I see myself in the book it will not fail it cannot fail I can't fail I can't fail sister Jane you can't fail you gone through hell but you didn't fall amen we've gone through it brother M we've been tempted we've been tried we've been tested and we're still standing amen there's something about it because we're part of the word Heaven and Earth will pass away and everything with it is going to pass away politics will pass away kingdoms of this world will pass away feelings and emotions will pass away but the word of God shall abide forever yes sir hallelujah we're going to overcome Hallelujah can you say man amen going to overcome amen going to overcome hallelujah how are we going to do it well believe it or not the Bible has the answer Romans 11 and 1 I say then hath God Cast Away his people now I know Paul's talking about Israel amen but but also we can look at it in the spiritual Israel spiritual sense has God Cast Away his people God forbid have you ever been felt like God cast you away amen I say to you God forbid he didn't cast you away you may not feel him but he didn't cast you away that's right yes sir for I also am an Israelite of the Seed of Abraham of The Tribe of Benjamin God hath not everybody say God hath not cast his people away which he fornew what ye not uh what the scripture saith of Elias how he maketh intercession to God against Israel saying Lord they have killed thy prophets and dig down thine altars and I am left alone and they seek my life but what said the answer of God unto him I have reserved to myself amen 7,000 men who have not bowed the knee to the image of bail and I say to you God's got a People reserved unto himself he's got you young people reserved to himself he's got you mothers and you fathers and you preachers and you deacons and and everybody here I believe amen as the elect of God Amen reserved unto himself Amen to where it looked like there was nothing still standing but God Faithful amen Philippians 1:6 being confident of this very thing that he which ha begun a good work in you will perform it that's right and do you believe that he which has begun a good work in you will perform it we'll complete it we'll we'll finalize it it he's going to finalize it he's not a God that does half stuff halfway ain't that right now now if I could say it this way don't you look at the world don't look at your wants and don't look at these and then judge God his faithfulness by all of that don't judge God by being faithful by how much money you got in the bank don't judge God as being faithful by whether you got a job or not don't you judge God being faithful by whether your children are saved or whatever don't you judge God by that God is faithful to his word God is obligated to his word can you say amen amen therefore we can be judge God faithful by his word that when the situation is so Rank and it's so opposite of what we've been praying for we can still judge God Faithful because it's according to his word yes sir he's going to perform it amen he's going to perform it amen you can you can have money in the bank and be broke tomorrow but God's still going to perform it can you say Amen you're not going to take your money with you you ain't going to take your health with you you ain't going to take this old uh uh vile nature with you and and all the materialistic things with you so don't judge God God well like job said the lord giveth the lord taketh away blessed be his name amen amen hallelujah he that began a good work in you going to perform it complete it finalize it finish it up for you amen amen and when did he began the good work now notice when did he begin the work four Romans 8:29 for whom he did four know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son so this is why those that he forew he didn't say whom he did for no did he also predestinate to be wealthy amen come on them he also predestinated to have a life of ease no no no but to be conformed to the image of his son wealthy or not he predestinated you to be conformed to the image of his son health or not he he predestinated you to be conformed to the image of his son big church or not he predestinated you to be conformed to the image of his son you understand what I'm saying trial free or not amen some people have more trials than other people have but he it doesn't change what he predestined ated you to be he does it by his own counsel can you say Amen all we know is he predestinated us to be conformed to the image of his son and what comes what goes it does not matter he is faithful to his word amen amen that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified they he also glorified as I've said before you didn't reflect anything of that yeah you didn't reflect anything of what God called you to be and predestinated you to be when you were born in this world because you had a sinful nature but nonetheless you were predestinated to it can you say amen and if you're predestinated that means you've got a word everybody say a word genan seed in you not not a sex seed a gene word Gene seed in you before the foundation of the world can you say amen and brother brandham called that seed a little grain of life a little grain of Life another place he says it was another nature in Us by predestination we only catered to one nature our first nature that was our first nature a vile nature a nature that was against God a nature that fought against God a nature that couldn't see the things of God a nature that loved the world and the things of the world that's what we cater to no wonder Satan was able to draw us and lure us and and we were just dumb enough to follow him and and how many's got scars of your past you got scars of your past boy I've I've got scars in my past well you know that was just because I I followed after Satan and this is what he done to us you know understand what I'm saying but that was our first nature but brother brandham says you know we done that because we didn't have the new birth ain't that right but even while we were doing all that catering to all that there was another nature inside of us and he said that Jean seed was still working then that's right you out drinking in the bar and that Jean seed was still working then I thinking to brother Chris Long a pastor in there in Arizona he said man if you only knew what I used to be you know and he says I should be dead by now he said I was I was in the motorcycles and and this and that and and and he says I was just a rough character but all that time there was a jean seed working then think of that we couldn't be satisfied in the world we we couldn't we couldn't even be satisfied in religion that's couldn't settle down that's right amen so we can identify what a prophet said there in Psalms it's the Deep calleth unto the deep can you say Amen yes sir amen it was a desire a craving for God and yet we wouldn't even know what we were Desiring but something down inside of us but listen Church before you could have ever created had that desire that desire had to be created in you brother Braham said that's what that is desire is created can you say Amen it's a creation brother Bram said before you can have a desire that has to be a Creator there has to be a Creator to create that desire and see so that desire comes from the Eternal Gene seed of God that was placed in us a desire to be part of the promises of God a desire to be a Son of God a desire to be restored back we didn't understand what them desires were but I tell you what when we come into the message and we found the truth and the book became open to us the desire that it it it it just it's like we settle down in realities of the book we settle down not this world ain't a reality to us anymore there's a city that's a reality to us there's a heaven a millennium that's becoming a more reality to us every day Glory yes adoption being restored as sons of God ruling and reigning that's becoming more of a reality than anything amen you think of a person that's sick and a revelation of him being healed amen comes to him the reality of his healing is more real than his sickness that's what makes him profess I'm Healed that's right why because it's more of reality than the pain amen it's more of reality than the symptoms can you say amen and we're realizing now amen that what we are every promise in this book is becoming more of a reality to us that we cast aside every negative thought we cast aside every little thing of this world and we start looking to heaven we start looking to the things that God has promised us amen do you think we worship God you know God based upon how we feel and how we don't feel you know I I understand there's there a lot of folks that do that their worship hinges on whether they feel good whether they don't feel good everything about them it it just their emotions they build their life upon emotions they build their Christianity upon emotions they build their faith upon emotions so if they're feeling good that everything is going right boy they're just there wo you know and then when the things that ain't going good then they just don't know and and and you don't know if they're going to even come to church you don't even know if they're going to backslide you just really don't know what's going to happen you understand what I'm saying but to those that have really got a revelation that they are part of the word of God and they cannot fail amen their worship stems from that Revelation yes sir it stems from that Revelation their confession stems from the Revelation can you say Amen oh do you love him yes sir I love him amen amen you know brother Braham said no man ever come to God empty and went away Desiring to be filled but what was full Lord amen if you desire to be full of God God will fill it and you won't have to walk away still empty if you're Desiring more of God you don't have to walk away empty why because you're part of the word of God God is here to honor his word God is here to to to to to make that word come to pass pass can you say Amen yes sir if we could get a revelation of that now 1 Thessalonians 5:24 Faithful Is He everybody say faithful fath faithful is he that calleth you who also will do it amen amen that's right Philippians 2:13 it is God which worketh in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure amen do you believe that Amen brother Bram says now I want to show you what I find in the thought of faithful you know we often talk about a great unchanging God whose word does not change and when we speak of him after that manner we often get a view of him that makes him seem very impersonal it is as though God made the whole universe and all the laws that pertained to it and then stood back and become a great impersonal God it is as though God made a way of salvation for lost mankind that way being the cross and then when the death of Christ has a atone for our sins and his resurrection gave us an open door to him God just folded his arms and stood back it is as if we majored in believing in a great Creator who having created lost personal interest in his creation Now I say that is how too many people are apt to think but that is wrong thinking amen for God is governing the Affairs of men right now he is both Creator and sustainer amen amen he is a sovereign God by his own counsel he purposed the plan of the Salvation of his own El uh elect which he forew the son died upon the cross to establish the means of Salvation and the Holy Spirit carefully everybody say carefully executes the will of the father amen he is working all things at this moment according to the purpose of his own will he is right in the midst of it all he is in the midst of his church this great Creator savior God is Faithfully working amongst his own right now as the great Shepherd of the Sheep amen his very existence is for his own yes amen can you imagine amen what he reveals himself to us is for us praise the Lord he's revealed himself as Jehovah Gyra for you for me every every attribute that he is he's revealed it for us his very existence is for uh his own he loves them and cares for them His Eye Is ever upon them when the word says that your lives are HID with Christ and God it means exactly what it says oh I am so glad that my God abides faithful he is true to himself he won't lie he is true to the word he will back it up he is true to us he will loose none of us but raise us up in the last days can you say amen I believe oh we could go on and on but I you know bless his name I I thought of Jesus as he was here a predestinated seed of God predestinated word he stood there so confident in God that no matter what the devil threw at him it just never moved him amen he knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that he was there to fulfill the word of God right I like what brother Jonathan said there he said you know it's not you carrying the message but it's the message carrying you the word of God carrying you oh we should never just treat this message lightly this is our sustainer this is the word of God for this age hello I know this word is so different it's so odd the message is so different from the rest of the world but it comes from the very Mind Of God something that's been hid a lot of well all the messages uh in throughout the day the doctrines and that that we have today and throughout the world has been formed and formulated by men that was reading from a closed book but there's one Doctrine there's one Faith there's one message that is actually coming from an open book amen amen that's right and it's not us carrying it it's carrying us yes and Jesus knew it he knew that the word was carrying him he was the word that word was so in him that that that word that was him was caring him was sustaining him was leading him was strengthening him how else could he go to to Goa how else could he take the worst death ever possible to man because the word said he would do itall the word held him amen glory the word led him the word sustained him praise be to God and so is it today the word is sustaining us the word is carrying us can you say amenes Jesus knew it he knew amen uh you know brother brand says no matter if he was in a storm and the Gail is knocking the boat from one side to the other or he was standing in a face a mess of demons if he was hanging anywhere it never moved him he walked right on just as calm and quiet as he could be why he was simply unconscious of fear or anything around him that's right now that's way God wants us to be you know that right unconscious of fear or anything around us yeah yeah there's all kinds of things that's threatening to destroy our faith amen but we must walk unconscious of that don't let that be your reality let the word of God be the reality there's things all around us that's threatening our existence threatening our joy threatening our our our well just threatening everything Amen to where we just don't feel like we're going to make it don't feel like we're going to go in a Rapture but yeah I mean it it's just there but Satan can do that because he's working up on our emotions our feelings and everything but he still can't get that Soul that's where that genan seed lies is in that Soul amen so therefore he was simply unconscious of fear anything around him whether it was going to happen or whether it wasn't going to happen see he knew it was going to happen because God said so so he didn't say oh if I had prayed through if I wondered if I fast enough I wondered if I did this he just walked right on unconscious and you're here to fulfill it too you with me amen you're here to fulfill it too is he guessing about it NOP he's reading it from a book The open book it's something that's become he's the one that's he remember he's the one that's revealing it to his people through the people through the elect of godl and he's he's letting us know you got a purpose in this life you've got to fulfill the word of God brothers and sisters we're not passing the Baton to another age that's true amen nope nope nope the buck stops with you amen the Rapture is for you this changing of the body is for you am the adoption of sons is for you it the manifestation of the sons of God is for you that's right can you say Amen abolutely no matter how bad it looks it's for you the word of God says that's right don't just cast it away amen so what we got to do is cast away all imaginations everything that's contrary to the word of God you cast that aside and stay with the word of God Amen the word of God liveth and abideth forever amen so just walk unconscious of fear walk unconscious of criticism walk unconscious in unto the world walk as you walk in Christ walk with him not paying any attention to the right or the left hand just keep moving on if something comes up in the church walk with God if sickness strikes you walk with God if the neighbor don't like you walk with God just keep on Walking with God can you say amen and then he says in another place God wants you here to fulfill his word my Lord my Lord you're not just accident amen you remember you remember brother brandham tells that story of of that little girl that goes in the you know she the king the queen is coming or the king one of the two queen Coming you know and she's there and everybody thrown around she just so wants to see the the the the the queen or King and when it was all said and done you know and the king queen passed and things here comes the teacher and she sees this little child crying and she said what's the matter said did did did you did you not get to see the king yeah I I saw the king well what what what is it and she said well I saw the king but I don't know if he saw me amen she was so uh broken cuz she didn't think that she got recognized by her own King but Church you're just not a number in the crowd amen God wants you here in this age to fulfill his word you are his victory Hallelujah Satan's saying you realize the act the accuser of the Brethren and what he's saying about you they'll never make it they'll never come forth look at them and worthless people they'll never but see you're still making it you're still pressing you're enduring oh I love the Lord do you love him yes sir now how do we know what word we are supposed to fulfill if the musicians will come I just got to ask you how did Rebecca know that she was the one to be Isaac's wife well she didn't know she's just a normal girl she just there living her day out as she normally did but how did she know that elzer was looking for how how did she know she was that one how did they meet what we know through a prophet that the angel of the Lord met her before 30 minutes before eler got there and that angel began to prepare her begin to whisper to her go to the well go to the well begin to prepare her heart see God was going to fulfill that it it was totally impossible for elzer to find her and say she's the one he's the one that says Lord I don't know this burden is so great I don't know I won't know how to pick you got to help me and he puts the vow before the Lord but God had already been preparing her heart to come and here Rebecca starts walking under the uning of the angel of God praise the Lord and she met every requirement that elzer was was looking for and I say to you the angel of God has been preparing our hearts yes sir this isn't by accident how did Brother brandham know us he's gone he's already gone and left the Earth but here we are because the angel of God he here been preparing our hearts to come to the word oh aren't you glad for that oh it isn't by well intellectuals saying well you know we had nothing else to go to and this sounds really good now we'll just try this no no no it was God preparing our hearts to believe it was God preparing our hearts to say yes it's God preparing our hearts to meet the requirements we couldn't even do it amen but God led us to this message God leading us because he's got us here to fulfill his word I'm so glad that his word shall never pass away never pass away
