[49:43] we just love them dearly
[49:46] amen
[49:48] Matthew the 11th chapter and we'll start
[49:52] at the 28th verse it says come unto me
[49:56] all ye that labor and are heavy laden
[49:59] and I will give you rest
[50:01] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[50:04] for I am meek and lowly in heart and you
[50:07] shall find rest unto your souls for my
[50:10] yoke is easy and my burden is light amen
[50:15] let's just bow our hearts
[50:17] Lord Jesus
[50:20] there's just not enough emphasis that we
[50:23] could put upon you Lord
[50:26] your power and your might and your love
[50:29] faithfulness and all that you are
[50:33] Lord as the song would say oh for a
[50:36] thousand tongues to sing praise and
[50:39] honor to you
[50:41] father but Lord as we realize we only
[50:44] have a short lifetime
[50:47] Lord and we only have just one tongue
[50:49] that God to worship you and to speak but
[50:52] father let our lives declare
[50:55] let everything that's within us declare
[50:57] you and your glory in your mind
[51:01] father may you pray your presence come
[51:04] the presence of the king of kings Lord
[51:07] of lords come among us tonight and Lord
[51:11] you know the needs of your people I pray
[51:13] that you would meet them Lord and that
[51:16] you would just subdue Lord all enemy
[51:20] Lord that has come against your people
[51:22] father
[51:23] Lord we just Commit This service into
[51:25] your hands we need you Lord father
[51:28] anoint myself take what little words we
[51:31] would have and Lord just open it up to
[51:34] us as our prayer may it be effective in
[51:38] a positive way to your people draw
[51:40] what's closer to you we ask it in Jesus
[51:44] Christ's name amen you can have your
[51:48] seeds
[51:50] also I had forgot to mention uh this
[51:54] morning the financial report
[51:56] there is in the back anyone that wants
[51:59] to look at it and we appreciate brother
[52:03] Tim
[52:04] uh for doing that for us and taking the
[52:10] time and I know what can be a lot of
[52:13] work and for him and he's running his
[52:16] business and
[52:17] home and all that and but yet willing to
[52:21] to help us out and never complaining and
[52:24] we certainly appreciate that a lot of
[52:27] work goes on behind the scenes that
[52:30] maybe
[52:30] most don't realize uh
[52:35] but I just thank God for men and and
[52:39] even women that that just helped uh
[52:42] they're willing to help behind the
[52:44] scenes and that way we could just come
[52:46] to church and enjoy ourselves amen and
[52:50] uh so uh but
[52:53] I'm thinking again on the title uh
[52:57] resting and thus saith the Lord
[53:00] and um
[53:03] uh uh I think it's a powerful scripture
[53:07] and of course this word rest is to
[53:11] refrain from labor
[53:14] to be free from anxiety or disturbance
[53:19] having Peace of Mind and Spirit to
[53:23] remain confident so that's that's what
[53:26] the Lord wants us to do he wants us to
[53:28] be free from labor and exertion
[53:31] uh in in our spirit and our soul to be
[53:35] free from anxiety and fear and
[53:38] disturbance he wants us to have peace of
[53:41] mind he he wants us to be confident and
[53:45] if there's ever a time that we need to
[53:47] be confident it is today
[53:49] with the world the way it is and so much
[53:52] uncertainty but but there is a way for
[53:56] us to remain confident and uh and so uh
[54:00] this this this risk gives us an idea of
[54:03] what Jesus is meaning when he said come
[54:06] unto me and you shall find rest on in
[54:09] your soul and uh so people today seem to
[54:13] be physically exhausted they mentally
[54:16] exhausted and and spiritually exhausted
[54:21] um
[54:22] um just uh exhausted all around and uh
[54:26] but Jesus was speaking rest for the soul
[54:30] you shall find rest and and it's so
[54:34] important then if if we are to come to
[54:37] him to find such a rest
[54:40] then it is important to know what to
[54:43] come to uh uh because we cannot find
[54:47] rest if we don't come to him
[54:50] another scripture that is prophetic of
[54:53] our day and uh uh Nance Isaiah 45 22
[54:57] where Jesus has said or God said in the
[55:00] Old Testament be ye saved or looking to
[55:03] me and be saved all the ends plural of
[55:07] the earth and uh this this scripture uh
[55:11] been laying there all these years
[55:13] speaking of this day and uh for it says
[55:17] all ye ends of the Earth
[55:19] look unto me and be ye saved we we are
[55:22] at the end of all things
[55:25] the the system of the Earth has come to
[55:28] its end world history has come to its
[55:32] end
[55:32] civilization has come to its End Church
[55:36] ages have come to its end denominations
[55:40] have come to its end time has come to
[55:44] its end everything
[55:47] is is come to its end we are truly at
[55:51] the ends of the Earth and this world
[55:55] cannot continue anymore much longer uh
[55:59] uh uh as as it is and so uh but it's at
[56:05] this time that we are commanded by God
[56:09] to look look unto him and be ye saved
[56:13] and so now it's sad to say in this
[56:17] condition uh that the world is in uh
[56:21] people don't know what to look for they
[56:25] they don't know where to look and uh my
[56:29] they're they're trying to find comfort
[56:31] in religion uh look into religion but
[56:35] they ain't finding rest there they're
[56:37] they're looking to politicians but
[56:39] they're not finding rest there they're
[56:41] looking to their jobs but they ain't
[56:43] finding rest there you ain't finding
[56:45] rest in economies in the economy you you
[56:49] there there is just no rest but but so
[56:52] if if he told us to come to him that we
[56:56] might find rest and look to him to find
[57:00] life then we need to know we we need to
[57:03] know what he is and where he is and uh
[57:07] the the the prophet of God said at the
[57:10] end of each World System he always makes
[57:14] himself known amen God always makes
[57:18] himself known so he's not he's not some
[57:21] say look unto me and then he doesn't
[57:24] make himself known he he does and and so
[57:28] then the command is coming to me look
[57:30] unto me find rest be be saved amen and
[57:34] that's that's the most important thing
[57:36] of Our Lives is that we can find rest
[57:39] amen trouble's coming and we got to have
[57:42] that rest and and the the shaking is
[57:45] going on there Paul uh uh uh their
[57:48] prophesied of this day and and and God
[57:51] said you know not only will I shake the
[57:53] the Earth also but I'll shake the
[57:55] heavens or not only will I shake the
[57:56] heavens I'll shake the Earth anyways the
[57:58] earth and the heavens are going to be
[58:00] shaken and everything is going to be
[58:02] shaken and that which can remain shall
[58:05] remain and that which will be shaken
[58:07] will be shaken will be removed ain't
[58:10] that right well we're living in this
[58:12] time of shaking home life being shaken
[58:15] the church is being shaken everything is
[58:18] being shaken to the core a man and uh so
[58:23] so to come to him then then the the
[58:27] thing that the prophet has taught us is
[58:29] that you've got to come to the word
[58:31] ain't that right you you have to come to
[58:35] the word for he is the word come come to
[58:39] the word and find rest for your souls
[58:41] look to the word and and be ye saved uh
[58:46] all ye ends of the Earth now but this
[58:49] means more than just carrying a Bible or
[58:52] and having a Bible and it means more
[58:55] than just reading your Bible which we
[58:58] should all read our Bible but it means
[59:01] more than that it means more than just
[59:03] memorizing uh Bible verses and and and
[59:07] things like that uh here John 1 1 it
[59:12] tells us really what the word is in the
[59:15] beginning was the word the word was with
[59:18] God and the Word was God but it doesn't
[59:22] just stop there in the 14th verse it
[59:25] says and the word everybody say the word
[59:27] was made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[59:31] beheld his glory story The Glory as of
[59:35] the only begotten of the father full of
[59:37] grace and truth so the word was the
[59:41] beginning in the beginning was the word
[59:43] which is an expression of God's thoughts
[59:45] and the Word was with God the Word was
[59:49] God you can't you can't take God from
[59:51] the word you can't separate God from the
[59:53] word the word from God it's all the same
[59:55] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:00:00] Among Us which Paul later says and God
[1:00:02] was in Christ reconciling the world so
[1:00:05] unto himself so the word was made flesh
[1:00:08] God in flesh ain't that right and so it
[1:00:12] it then it was at then that when the
[1:00:16] word became flesh that he said come unto
[1:00:20] me all ye that labor and are heavy laden
[1:00:24] and I will give you rest unto your soul
[1:00:26] so so what I believe that the word made
[1:00:31] flesh is what he is today the word made
[1:00:36] flesh is what he is today to come to him
[1:00:40] we do not come to a physical body that
[1:00:43] he once lived in when he made that
[1:00:46] statement come unto me all ye that uh
[1:00:49] are heavy laden see because he isn't
[1:00:53] here today in his physical body do you
[1:00:56] believe that so we're not looking for a
[1:00:59] physical stature uh maybe with nail
[1:01:02] scarred hands and and and stripes on his
[1:01:05] back now the Bible never promised that
[1:01:08] we would that he would come to us in
[1:01:10] that way the Bible says that the Jews
[1:01:12] will see him that way and they'll look
[1:01:15] upon him uh with no scarred hands and
[1:01:17] say where did you get these scars uh and
[1:01:20] he says in the house of my friends ain't
[1:01:22] that right but he never promised to come
[1:01:25] to us Amen in a physical form or his
[1:01:30] physical body but he is here in the form
[1:01:34] of his promised word
[1:01:36] manifesting himself he is revealed in
[1:01:41] his own word ain't that right Prophet
[1:01:44] said he is sitting or hiding in his own
[1:01:47] word so God now if you notice God isn't
[1:01:51] in in the word of a man he's not in
[1:01:54] man's words he does not reveal himself
[1:01:58] in the words of a man only in his own
[1:02:02] word does he reveal himself ain't that
[1:02:06] right so his word is the saith Lord
[1:02:10] ain't that right his word is thus saith
[1:02:13] the Lord and that is why Satan hates the
[1:02:17] word of God uh uh Satan will promote
[1:02:21] man's words he'll promote man's ideas
[1:02:24] his man's theology man's Doctrine he'll
[1:02:28] promote man's dogma and Creeds he'll
[1:02:32] promote anything outside the word of God
[1:02:35] Amen because he hates the word of God do
[1:02:39] you believe that amen the Bible even
[1:02:41] says that he transforms himself into an
[1:02:45] angel of Light and his Minister's work
[1:02:48] as Ministers of righteousness
[1:02:51] um uh second uh Corinthians 11 13 for
[1:02:55] such are are false Apostles deceitful
[1:02:58] workers transforming themselves into the
[1:03:02] Apostles of Christ and no Marvel for
[1:03:05] Satan himself is transformed into an
[1:03:08] angel of Light therefore it is no great
[1:03:11] thing if his ministers also be
[1:03:13] transformed as Ministers of
[1:03:15] righteousness who's in shall be
[1:03:18] according to their Works ain't that
[1:03:20] right a man in also in second
[1:03:22] Thessalonians 2 and 3 the the Apostle
[1:03:26] Paul tells us why Satan does this why
[1:03:29] does he transform himself into an angel
[1:03:32] of Light amen and he says let no man
[1:03:35] deceive you by any means for that day
[1:03:38] this day shall not come except there
[1:03:41] there come a falling away the day of the
[1:03:44] Lord and that man of sin be revealed the
[1:03:46] Son of Perdition who opposes and
[1:03:50] exalteth himself above all that is
[1:03:53] called God or that is worship so that he
[1:03:57] Satan asked God sent us in the temple of
[1:04:02] God showing himself that he is God ain't
[1:04:06] that right so so he God is light do you
[1:04:10] believe that that's what the Bible says
[1:04:12] in John that God is light and and yet we
[1:04:16] Paul is telling us that Satan transforms
[1:04:19] himself into an angel of Light showing
[1:04:24] himself to be God and ain't that right a
[1:04:28] man showing himself to be God but the
[1:04:31] Bible tells us there in John uh first
[1:04:34] John 1 5 God is light and in him is no
[1:04:40] Darkness at all ain't no Darkness at all
[1:04:44] ain't that right so Satan May transform
[1:04:48] himself as an angel of Light but his
[1:04:52] works are the works of darkness amen and
[1:04:56] and his power as the Bible says is the
[1:05:00] power of Darkness so he as in as an
[1:05:04] impersonator
[1:05:06] transforms himself into an angel of
[1:05:09] Light a man impersonating as God ain't
[1:05:12] that right amen but the problem is with
[1:05:15] this God is the word ain't that right
[1:05:18] God is the word now the Prophet said
[1:05:21] that Satan can impersonate any kind of
[1:05:25] gift that God has got amen he can
[1:05:29] impersonate speaking in tongues he can
[1:05:31] impersonate uh uh prophesying he can
[1:05:34] impersonate uh visions and dreams he can
[1:05:37] impersonate all kinds of things amen he
[1:05:41] can prophesy he can he can dance and
[1:05:44] shout and roll on the floor and cry and
[1:05:47] and and and and all of these things he
[1:05:49] can impersonate any gift that God's got
[1:05:52] but he cannot everybody say he cannot
[1:05:55] bring that word word by word he cannot
[1:06:00] bring that word word by word ain't that
[1:06:03] right amen and so that's what he failed
[1:06:06] in on in the Garden of Eden and that's
[1:06:10] where he always fails is he cannot bring
[1:06:13] that word word by word amen and his
[1:06:16] ministers can't do it either amen
[1:06:18] they'll take the Bible and they'll start
[1:06:21] reading and they'll take the scriptures
[1:06:22] but then they'll apply their own
[1:06:24] interpretations Amen to the Bible ain't
[1:06:27] that right now now Satan quoted uh to
[1:06:31] Eve uh the serpent quoted to Eve what
[1:06:34] everything that God said that one word
[1:06:36] amen he missed one word ain't that right
[1:06:39] amen but that one word a man uh calls
[1:06:43] death to the whole world it it caused
[1:06:45] all the corruption the sickness and the
[1:06:47] pain the death and everything is by that
[1:06:50] one word so it's important to stay with
[1:06:53] the word of God ain't that right amen
[1:06:55] for that's the only where you're going
[1:06:57] to find Christ for he is the word amen
[1:07:00] now Matthew 24 and 24 it says for there
[1:07:03] shall arise false christs or false
[1:07:06] anointed ones and false prophets and
[1:07:10] shall show great signs and wonders in so
[1:07:12] much that if it were possible it would
[1:07:16] deceive the very elect now now we know
[1:07:19] that that scripture that was was a
[1:07:21] prophecy speaking of this day there's
[1:07:23] never been a time in in the history of
[1:07:26] mankind that it has been such a
[1:07:29] deceptive hour amen such as a deceptive
[1:07:33] hour is in this age and and and he says
[1:07:37] that there would arise false Christ
[1:07:39] which Christ means anointed ones amen so
[1:07:43] there would be false uh uh Christ false
[1:07:46] prophets in other words the prophet said
[1:07:48] false anointed teachers of the word they
[1:07:51] can expound on the word but false
[1:07:53] Anointed with it a man anointed but
[1:07:56] they're false a man because uh uh see
[1:08:00] they they they they're putting their own
[1:08:02] slant to the word of God Amen see and
[1:08:06] and and so the prophet said they can be
[1:08:08] Anointed with the spirit speak in
[1:08:11] tongues dance shout preach the gospel
[1:08:13] and steal a devil amen anointed teachers
[1:08:16] but anointed people with false teaching
[1:08:20] ain't that right another place he said
[1:08:23] anointed ones Christ plural prophets
[1:08:25] plural see if there was if there is such
[1:08:28] a thing as cry as a Christ singular then
[1:08:32] these would have to be anointed ones
[1:08:34] that their prophecy of what they were
[1:08:37] teaching would be the difference because
[1:08:39] they are anointed ones ain't that right
[1:08:42] both anointed the true and the false
[1:08:45] anointed one but where is the difference
[1:08:48] is their teaching one is a true teaching
[1:08:50] and one is a false teaching ain't that
[1:08:52] right one is showing Christ because
[1:08:55] Christ is the word and the other one
[1:08:57] isn't showing price
[1:08:59] hey ain't that right and so it's in this
[1:09:02] day that we are commanded to look and
[1:09:05] live uh look unto Jesus and and and and
[1:09:08] be saved and come to him and find rest
[1:09:12] for our souls and yet in this day that
[1:09:16] we are to look it's in this day that
[1:09:19] false Christ and false teachers a man
[1:09:21] will arise amen and deceive the very
[1:09:25] elect if it were possible so you can see
[1:09:28] that there it is such a confusing age in
[1:09:31] this time it's an age of deception and
[1:09:34] Satan Works through deception ain't that
[1:09:38] right it's not like God saying well you
[1:09:40] know maybe you know yeah God's saying
[1:09:42] well I'm gonna go build a house and
[1:09:44] Satan said well I'll just go if you're
[1:09:45] going to build the house I'll go build a
[1:09:46] car no no that ain't that ain't it it's
[1:09:49] it's it's it's it's it's if God does
[1:09:51] something Satan's got to counteract that
[1:09:53] Satan's gotta you understand to where
[1:09:56] it's a duplicate or a uh but it's a fall
[1:09:59] ain't that right that looks like the
[1:10:01] real
[1:10:02] now now so so we've got to see him we've
[1:10:07] got to come to him we've got to look to
[1:10:09] him and so the prophet would tell us how
[1:10:12] will the people that's believing him
[1:10:14] know know it know him unless they're
[1:10:18] constantly in the word to know what he
[1:10:21] is so you'll not understand Christ
[1:10:24] outside this word you'll not seek him
[1:10:27] outside the words you'll not know him
[1:10:29] outside this word ain't that right for
[1:10:32] Daniel said the wives shall know ain't
[1:10:34] that right the wise shall know but the
[1:10:39] foolish the unwise wouldn't know they
[1:10:41] shall know their God see the wise shall
[1:10:43] know their God now how he shall appear
[1:10:46] in the last days is to bring the people
[1:10:49] back to the word so that the bride will
[1:10:53] know her husband know her mate the
[1:10:56] revealed word ain't that right a man
[1:11:00] says so now if you're just bear with me
[1:11:02] I'm not going to keep you alone but I
[1:11:04] really want to get this to you
[1:11:06] today amen the bride will only know him
[1:11:10] and as her mate her husband which he is
[1:11:14] a man no Christ be able to look at him
[1:11:17] and recognize him and come to him only
[1:11:21] by knowing the word of God Amen you've
[1:11:25] got to look in the word of God and and
[1:11:28] and but notice how the prophet called it
[1:11:30] he's the revealed word ain't that right
[1:11:33] he's the revealed word so what is he the
[1:11:36] revealed word what is Christ in you in
[1:11:39] this age the revealed word what is the
[1:11:42] message of Malachi 4 the revealed word
[1:11:45] what do we come to the revealed word
[1:11:48] what do we look at the revealed word
[1:11:51] ain't that right there is something
[1:11:53] about this revealed word that'll give
[1:11:56] rest to your soul
[1:11:59] it's true amen it's what's keeping us
[1:12:03] from Great Tribulation
[1:12:05] ain't that right yes sir now my title
[1:12:09] again is resting in thus uh saith the
[1:12:13] Lord now that's what the word of God is
[1:12:15] do you believe that it's thus saith the
[1:12:17] Lord not the Sith man not the saith
[1:12:20] Elijah not the saith uh uh Jeremiah not
[1:12:24] in the saith uh uh these things but it's
[1:12:27] thus saith the Lord now if a theologian
[1:12:30] comes a man then don't look at that and
[1:12:34] don't gather around that because you'll
[1:12:37] not see Christ there
[1:12:39] ain't that right don't look unto a
[1:12:42] denomination and don't gather around
[1:12:44] that denomination for it you'll you
[1:12:47] won't come to Christ that way for Christ
[1:12:49] is not in there if a sensation arises
[1:12:53] well don't look at that or gather around
[1:12:55] that can you say Amen because you won't
[1:12:59] see Christ in it amen there there these
[1:13:02] things have no way to bring you to
[1:13:05] Christ or reveal Christ to you amen that
[1:13:08] you know that they're they're finding
[1:13:10] what they're doing but we've got to look
[1:13:12] to Christ amen and be you saved we we've
[1:13:16] got to come to Christ amen and and find
[1:13:19] rest unto our souls so when you come uh
[1:13:23] to a theologian or a denomination or
[1:13:25] some uh idea uh sensation or whatever
[1:13:29] what you're coming to is a personality
[1:13:32] of men amen it's man's idea man's
[1:13:36] thoughts man's thing that you know and
[1:13:38] it's all built and founded upon man or a
[1:13:42] group of men ain't that right but God
[1:13:44] never told us to come to a man
[1:13:48] and and as much as people want to say
[1:13:51] that we worship brother Brandon we're
[1:13:52] not worshiping a man we ain't coming to
[1:13:54] a man
[1:13:56] can you say Amen it's not a man that
[1:13:58] you've come to it's not a building that
[1:14:00] we come to it's none of that we've come
[1:14:03] to the word
[1:14:04] the word can you say Amen the word see
[1:14:07] so so we are to come unto him and find
[1:14:11] rest in our soul look unto him and live
[1:14:16] eternally amen we know that we've only
[1:14:18] got a space that's a limited time in
[1:14:21] this Natural Life in this in this
[1:14:23] natural body that we're all going to
[1:14:25] perish amen but but we've got a way to
[1:14:28] live eternally if we can look and live
[1:14:33] be saved ain't that right well he is the
[1:14:37] word so as we've said it started as a
[1:14:39] thought of God ain't that right that's
[1:14:42] what a word starts as is a thought and
[1:14:45] then that thought was expressed into
[1:14:48] word which we call the spoken word of
[1:14:51] God and then it becomes word fulfilled
[1:14:55] or the word materialized ain't that
[1:14:58] right now when Jesus there in his day
[1:15:02] the people should have been looking for
[1:15:05] the word to be fulfilled and if they
[1:15:08] would have looked for the word to be
[1:15:10] fulfilled then they would have
[1:15:12] recognized him when he came ain't that
[1:15:15] right because Jesus did not come as a
[1:15:17] theologian he did not come as a doctor
[1:15:19] of divinity he didn't come with all
[1:15:22] these titles of of that man have today
[1:15:25] amen he did not come representing a
[1:15:28] denomination or a seminary or a Doctrine
[1:15:30] or a thought or a or a whatever he was
[1:15:33] the word made flesh can you say man so
[1:15:37] then they should have recognized him a
[1:15:40] man because in other words uh uh he he
[1:15:43] he was the Fulfillment of the word but
[1:15:46] the reason why they did not recognize
[1:15:48] him is they were looking for their own
[1:15:51] interpretation of the word to be
[1:15:54] fulfilled they had their own idea of how
[1:15:58] this Bible should have been fulfilled
[1:15:59] and when it did not be fulfilled that
[1:16:02] way then they did not believe him and
[1:16:06] yet there he was God made flesh
[1:16:09] revealing himself to the people and they
[1:16:12] crucified him ain't that right they
[1:16:16] crucified the Messiah that's why it is
[1:16:19] so important not to add or take away
[1:16:23] from the word of God Amen Deuteronomy 4
[1:16:27] 2 amen you shall not add unto the word
[1:16:30] which I command you neither shall you
[1:16:33] diminish ought from it take away faith
[1:16:36] that ye may keep the Commandments of the
[1:16:38] Lord your God which I command you amen
[1:16:41] Matthew I believe it is or where in the
[1:16:43] New Testament John or Jesus said that
[1:16:46] man shall live by every word that
[1:16:49] proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[1:16:51] Revelations 22 and 18 for I testify unto
[1:16:55] every man that heareth the words of this
[1:16:57] prophecy uh uh of the prophecy of this
[1:17:00] book If any man shall add unto these
[1:17:03] things God shall add unto him the
[1:17:06] plagues that are written in this book
[1:17:08] ain't that right so we are told not to
[1:17:11] add or take away because the moment you
[1:17:14] add or you take away you miss Christ you
[1:17:18] won't see him for he is the word ain't
[1:17:20] that right amen and and and the revealed
[1:17:24] word so now people have Twisted the word
[1:17:27] to fit their own devilish means amen and
[1:17:31] then they wonder why they missing Christ
[1:17:33] well you know the Bible
[1:17:36] plainly says that it's in this day that
[1:17:39] Jesus will come as a thief in the night
[1:17:42] amen as a thief in the night in other
[1:17:45] words he will come and the people will
[1:17:47] not know that he came he will come and
[1:17:50] be gone before the people realize it
[1:17:52] ain't that right but it's in that coming
[1:17:55] in that coming that we are to be awake
[1:17:58] and look and live
[1:18:00] can you say man so then he's not going
[1:18:03] to come as a thief in the night to
[1:18:05] everybody
[1:18:06] oh
[1:18:07] amen see the thief breaks into the house
[1:18:10] to get something
[1:18:12] ain't that right he goes in there to get
[1:18:14] the jewels and when he gives them Jewels
[1:18:17] he slips back out amen and takes his
[1:18:20] possession with him so here comes Jesus
[1:18:23] as a thief in the night a man to come to
[1:18:26] get who those he had redeemed
[1:18:31] he comes to get his jewels a man and
[1:18:34] when he leaves the world don't know
[1:18:37] nothing about it but those that he came
[1:18:40] for they seek him they recognize him
[1:18:43] amen
[1:18:46] so he comes and and the world will know
[1:18:49] nothing about it it's because again they
[1:18:53] have their own interpretation of the
[1:18:55] scriptures and are blind amen now look
[1:18:59] look at this and and I won't keep you
[1:19:02] much longer but second Peter 3 and 1.
[1:19:04] this Second Epistle behold I now write
[1:19:07] unto you in both which I steer up your
[1:19:10] pure Minds by way of remembrance that
[1:19:12] you be mindful of the words that which
[1:19:15] were spoken before by the prophet holy
[1:19:18] prophets and of the Commandment of us
[1:19:21] um uh the Apostles of the Lord are
[1:19:23] savior uh knowing this verse that there
[1:19:26] shall arrive there shall come in the
[1:19:28] last day scoffers walking after their
[1:19:31] own lusts and saying where is the
[1:19:34] promise of his coming in other words
[1:19:36] where's the Fulfillment of his coming
[1:19:38] when is it going to happen we've heard
[1:19:41] about it for years when is it going to
[1:19:43] be ain't that right for since the
[1:19:45] fathers fell asleep all things continue
[1:19:48] as they were from the beginning of
[1:19:51] creation ain't that right now Church
[1:19:53] they are doing that very thing today
[1:19:58] ain't that right and notice now when he
[1:20:02] comes in as a thief in the night a man
[1:20:06] and and it's in that time he comes as
[1:20:09] the thief they're asking where's the
[1:20:11] promise of his coming now think of that
[1:20:13] he comes as a thief
[1:20:16] and they're asking where is he at
[1:20:19] where's the promise of his coming
[1:20:22] notice it's in this layout of seeing
[1:20:24] that the age that this happens amen and
[1:20:28] I'd encourage all you young people and
[1:20:30] and whoever Elders too alike to listen
[1:20:33] to the church ages
[1:20:34] but but you find notice what Jesus said
[1:20:38] to this lay Odyssey and age the age that
[1:20:42] he is to come as a thief in the night
[1:20:44] the age that the world is saying where's
[1:20:47] the promise of his coming
[1:20:49] and yet he says to this layout of cnh
[1:20:52] behold I stand at the door and knock
[1:20:57] and you say Amen If any man hear my
[1:21:00] voice and open the door I will come into
[1:21:03] him and will sup with him and he with me
[1:21:07] ain't that right right at the the time
[1:21:11] at the ends of the Earth at the time
[1:21:13] that it's it's so crucial to look to him
[1:21:16] and be ye saved Amen to come unto him
[1:21:19] and find rest to your soul amen the the
[1:21:23] the the time that he comes as a thief in
[1:21:25] the night and yet the world he's
[1:21:28] standing on the outside of the church
[1:21:31] trying to get back in
[1:21:33] standing on the outside of the age
[1:21:35] trying to get back in can you say Amen
[1:21:37] he's not talking about the individual
[1:21:40] he's talking about the church
[1:21:44] ain't that right so here Jesus Christ
[1:21:48] the end this scripture tells us then
[1:21:50] shows us that Jesus Christ is making
[1:21:53] known his presence
[1:21:56] amen by the word becoming flesh
[1:22:01] again
[1:22:05] amen
[1:22:07] amen that's right it John ain't seeing
[1:22:10] him in it writing about his physical
[1:22:12] body knocking at a door
[1:22:16] he comes in this age as the word may
[1:22:19] flesh
[1:22:20] word revealed ain't that right
[1:22:23] and they reject him and the people don't
[1:22:27] see that it's him
[1:22:31] the Bible does not mention
[1:22:34] any other age in the seven Church ages
[1:22:37] where Christ is manifested
[1:22:40] in that age but this age
[1:22:43] this age this is the age that he's
[1:22:45] kicked out
[1:22:46] this is the age it's only here
[1:22:49] and when it comes to reveal himself the
[1:22:51] church World kicks him out ain't that
[1:22:54] right so what what did they kick out the
[1:22:56] revealed word
[1:22:58] the revealed word now church God cannot
[1:23:00] lie
[1:23:02] what he says he's going to fulfill
[1:23:05] you believe that
[1:23:07] amen uh as we I believe said this
[1:23:10] morning he is eternal
[1:23:12] and then that makes his word eternal
[1:23:15] he is eternal he cannot change he cannot
[1:23:19] be altered you cannot diminish God you
[1:23:21] cannot you make him any other way than
[1:23:23] what he is he's eternal
[1:23:25] his word is eternal you can't change his
[1:23:28] word
[1:23:29] you you can't diminish his word whatever
[1:23:32] he says and and so then it's up to us to
[1:23:36] find out what he really means
[1:23:38] if if we were there and we heard him say
[1:23:40] let there be light and we come up with
[1:23:42] with the tricycle see there you are God
[1:23:45] well it had been the wrong
[1:23:46] interpretation of what he said
[1:23:48] we had our own interpretation of what
[1:23:50] life should be but he already knew what
[1:23:52] light should be so then when he said let
[1:23:54] there be light and light appeared then
[1:23:56] that's God's interpretation and you say
[1:23:59] amen that's God's word revealed
[1:24:01] interpreted ain't that right yes sir see
[1:24:05] so so it doesn't matter how many years
[1:24:08] go by God's word will be fulfilled
[1:24:13] amen see Jesus said Heaven and Earth
[1:24:15] shall pass away but my word shall never
[1:24:18] pass away
[1:24:19] so so then we find uh the word was
[1:24:23] expressed through Prophets
[1:24:25] amen uh through prophets that's they
[1:24:29] they had thus set the Lord second Peter
[1:24:31] 1 and 20. it says knowing this first
[1:24:34] that no Prophecy of the scripture is of
[1:24:37] any private interpretation for the
[1:24:39] prophecy came not in Old Time by the
[1:24:42] will of man but holy men of God prophets
[1:24:46] right holy men of God speak as they were
[1:24:50] moved by the Holy Ghost
[1:24:52] so it was not the words of a man it was
[1:24:56] the words of God
[1:24:58] ain't that right now maybe they didn't
[1:25:00] have the understanding of what even they
[1:25:02] were saying that it was God that knew
[1:25:05] what he would say and God knew what he
[1:25:07] was after
[1:25:09] amen second Timothy 3 16 all scripture
[1:25:12] is given by inspiration of God ain't
[1:25:15] that right so a true Vindicated Prophet
[1:25:18] is the one that has thus saith the Lord
[1:25:22] the word of the lord always everybody
[1:25:25] say always comes to the prophet amen
[1:25:29] Amos 3 and 7 surely the Lord God will do
[1:25:33] nothing but he revealeth his secret unto
[1:25:37] his servants the prophets ain't that
[1:25:40] right so if any God is going to do
[1:25:42] anything it's got to be done through the
[1:25:44] prophet the word comes to the prophet
[1:25:47] ain't that right and notice the prophet
[1:25:49] prophets were called Gods amen because
[1:25:53] not of the other their stature not
[1:25:56] because of their position in the Earth
[1:25:58] but because they had the word of the
[1:26:01] Lord they had thus saith the Lord ain't
[1:26:04] that right uh John 10 34 Jesus answered
[1:26:08] them is it not written in your law that
[1:26:11] I said you are Gods see if he called
[1:26:14] them Gods the prophets
[1:26:17] unto whom the word of God came and the
[1:26:21] scripture cannot be broken and here he
[1:26:25] was the word made flesh the Son of God
[1:26:28] ain't that right see so uh the prophet
[1:26:32] said if a man has the word of God it's
[1:26:34] not the man it's the word that the
[1:26:37] peoples listening to it isn't the man
[1:26:41] it's the word
[1:26:43] amen
[1:26:45] now if and if the prophets Jeremiah
[1:26:48] Isaiah Elisha if they had thus saith the
[1:26:50] Lord God said as long as that word was
[1:26:53] going from them they were Gods God said
[1:26:57] himself he was the one done the
[1:26:59] announcing because it wasn't a man he
[1:27:02] had took the man out and put himself in
[1:27:05] there to speak
[1:27:07] use the man's lips use the Man's Tongue
[1:27:10] and that man become the mouthpiece of
[1:27:13] God
[1:27:14] and when it come from God uh from that
[1:27:18] man as God speaking amen it was thus
[1:27:21] saith the Lord and there was nothing
[1:27:23] that was going to alter that word amen
[1:27:26] it would be fulfilled
[1:27:29] brother Brown says in this place and
[1:27:31] this he says check back to the Bible and
[1:27:33] see if the prophets are anything ever
[1:27:35] done anything outside of first seeing it
[1:27:37] first to be done because you can't say
[1:27:40] it's thus saith the Lord unless the Lord
[1:27:42] has said it and you know it it ain't a
[1:27:44] mythical workup or some mental emotion
[1:27:47] it isn't psychology see it is absolutely
[1:27:50] God foreshowing something that's going
[1:27:53] to happen correctly and it will happen
[1:27:56] every time do you believe that it'll
[1:27:59] happen every time it'll never fail once
[1:28:04] amen now we find that God let his the
[1:28:08] the children of Israel By His prophets
[1:28:11] remember when they wanted the king
[1:28:13] Israel decided they wanted a king and
[1:28:15] they told the prophet Samuel what they
[1:28:18] wanted and the Bible says in first
[1:28:20] Samuel 8 and 6 said the thing displeased
[1:28:24] Samuel when they said give us a king to
[1:28:26] judge us and Samuel prayed unto the Lord
[1:28:29] now this broke Samuel's heart as a
[1:28:32] prophet he was he was he was the one uh
[1:28:35] over the the people and they told him we
[1:28:38] don't we don't want you we want a king
[1:28:40] and and so he cries unto the Lord and
[1:28:43] the Lord said unto Samuel hearken unto
[1:28:45] the voice of the people and all that
[1:28:47] they say unto thee for they have not
[1:28:50] rejected thee but they have rejected me
[1:28:54] that I should not Reign Over them
[1:28:57] ain't that right so we we find that the
[1:29:01] words uh uh that the prophet said this
[1:29:04] is what this is is a written word of
[1:29:06] what the spoken word was that come to
[1:29:08] the prophets ain't that right everything
[1:29:11] of this Bible is the written word of God
[1:29:13] and it it it was the leadership of of
[1:29:17] Israel amen see it was uh the prophets
[1:29:21] the word amen see God LED his people by
[1:29:24] the word of the prophets
[1:29:27] a man see and so we we find
[1:29:31] um uh that that God hearkened unto them
[1:29:33] and he told them what would happen to
[1:29:35] them a man once they get a king the king
[1:29:37] was going to take their children take
[1:29:39] their daughters amen they would be
[1:29:40] servants unto him and he would take the
[1:29:43] best of the land he would take the best
[1:29:45] of their fruits he would take the best
[1:29:46] of everything and and on and on and on
[1:29:49] and yet they said well uh they said
[1:29:51] nevertheless the people refused to obey
[1:29:53] the voice of Samuel and they said nay
[1:29:56] but we will have a king over us that we
[1:29:58] also may be like all the nations and
[1:30:01] that our King May judge us and go out
[1:30:03] before us and fight our battle think of
[1:30:05] that they wanted a king to be like the
[1:30:07] Nations but God made them different God
[1:30:10] made them a different Nation he didn't
[1:30:13] give them a king to rule over them he
[1:30:14] gave them a prophet
[1:30:17] because that Prophet had his words
[1:30:20] and church so isn't today God did not
[1:30:23] make us to be like everybody else and be
[1:30:25] under a denomination in the pope and and
[1:30:27] and and a bishop and and a Creed and all
[1:30:31] of that he gave us a prophet
[1:30:34] to lead us
[1:30:36] to lead us
[1:30:40] the prophets led the People by the word
[1:30:42] thus saith the Lord thus saith the Lord
[1:30:45] I think two thousand times
[1:30:47] in the Old Testament you'll you'll
[1:30:49] you'll read thus saith the Lord thus
[1:30:51] saith the Lord thus saith the Lord why
[1:30:54] God was leading his people through the
[1:30:56] prophets
[1:30:57] and you know where they were leading
[1:30:59] them to to the coming Messiah
[1:31:03] they were pointing them to the coming
[1:31:05] Messiah
[1:31:07] their prophecies was was speaking of
[1:31:10] coming Messiah they were leading them
[1:31:12] and you say Amen all the types and
[1:31:14] shadows but it was all speaking of
[1:31:16] Messiah coming
[1:31:19] and their prophecy was correct
[1:31:21] and God Vindicated it to be so do you
[1:31:24] believe that they were anointed and were
[1:31:27] the mouthpiece of God Amen and they were
[1:31:30] living notice they were living in the
[1:31:32] time of Prophecy prophesying of what was
[1:31:35] to come
[1:31:38] prophesying it was Christ in them
[1:31:41] speaking through them about himself
[1:31:44] ain't that right but then it changed
[1:31:48] the word became flesh
[1:31:51] the word
[1:31:53] materialized and became flesh that word
[1:31:57] that was spoken out of the mouths of
[1:31:59] prophets
[1:32:01] become material last
[1:32:04] if you notice not one of those prophets
[1:32:06] said come unto me and I'll give you rest
[1:32:09] not one of them they always pointed
[1:32:12] messiah messiah messiah's coming ain't
[1:32:15] that right and when Messiah came ain't
[1:32:18] that right amen see they just pointed to
[1:32:21] him and and Jesus was the one that they
[1:32:24] spoke of amen and if you notice Jesus
[1:32:28] never pointed to a coming Messiah all
[1:32:31] the prophets before him talked of coming
[1:32:33] Messiah talked of a redeemer talkative
[1:32:35] of him to come and and these things but
[1:32:38] when he came he never pointed to a
[1:32:42] coming Messiah a coming Redeemer a
[1:32:44] whatever he he pointed to himself
[1:32:48] I am he ain't that right and that's when
[1:32:52] he came all scriptures began to be
[1:32:55] fulfilled everything that the prophet
[1:32:57] said of the Messiah began to become to
[1:33:00] happen and come to pass and and you read
[1:33:02] the Bible this was done that it might be
[1:33:04] fulfilled that was spoken by the Prophet
[1:33:06] this was done that it might be fulfilled
[1:33:08] that was spoken by the prophet
[1:33:09] everything that Jesus done was the was
[1:33:12] the Fulfillment of the word of God and
[1:33:14] he said come unto me all ye that are
[1:33:17] heavy laden and I'll give you rest
[1:33:20] look unto me
[1:33:22] every scripture that spoke of the
[1:33:24] Messiah was fulfilled through him
[1:33:27] and I say to you he was greater than the
[1:33:29] prophets
[1:33:30] you believe that he was greater than the
[1:33:33] prophets he was the prophecy fulfilled
[1:33:35] he was all the prophet's words put
[1:33:38] together
[1:33:39] made flesh
[1:33:43] see he was the word that came to the
[1:33:45] prophets and spoke through them
[1:33:47] that right
[1:33:49] but then he came as the word that was
[1:33:52] spoken
[1:33:53] made manifest
[1:33:56] so he the revealed word said come unto
[1:34:00] me and you shall find rest unto your
[1:34:02] souls hope it's all right
[1:34:04] but you have to know
[1:34:06] if you're going to come to him if you're
[1:34:08] going to look unto him you have to know
[1:34:10] what his promise for this day
[1:34:13] you have to know are we are we speaking
[1:34:15] of something still to come
[1:34:18] or are we at the end
[1:34:21] to our scriptures must be fulfilled
[1:34:25] amen
[1:34:26] see you you you you have to know what he
[1:34:29] promised for this day and didn't see it
[1:34:31] being fulfilled
[1:34:32] amen so don't be blinded we cannot be
[1:34:35] blinded by some interpretation of man
[1:34:39] man see if a man doesn't know about
[1:34:42] Malachi 4 do you realize if he doesn't
[1:34:45] know about Malachi 4
[1:34:47] and if he doesn't know that it's to be
[1:34:49] fulfilled in this day he will actually
[1:34:52] miss seeing Jesus
[1:34:56] he will actually missing Christ in the
[1:34:59] Fulfillment of Malachi 4.
[1:35:03] and you say Amen
[1:35:05] that's right see everybody's got their
[1:35:07] own interpretations of what Malachi 4
[1:35:09] means
[1:35:10] some say well that's speaking of of of
[1:35:12] John the Baptist or speaking of a group
[1:35:15] of men it's speaking of this it's
[1:35:16] speaking of that but God alone has his
[1:35:19] interpretation of what Malachi 4 means
[1:35:22] ain't that right and when it become
[1:35:25] fulfilled everybody rejected it
[1:35:27] everybody you understand but there was
[1:35:29] an elect that saw Christ
[1:35:35] the man ain't Christ
[1:35:38] right
[1:35:40] so see people are looking to a
[1:35:41] denomination
[1:35:43] they've come to a Creed or a Dogma
[1:35:45] they're looking at the man's opinion
[1:35:47] about things
[1:35:48] and all the while they're not finding
[1:35:50] rest for their souls
[1:35:53] can't look to a man
[1:35:56] can you say man
[1:35:58] yes I'm going to say it this way it's
[1:35:59] not all about brother Branham
[1:36:02] God took his servant home
[1:36:04] we're not sitting here twiddling our
[1:36:06] thumbs waiting for Brother Brown to come
[1:36:07] back to get Revival
[1:36:10] brother
[1:36:13] he's here
[1:36:14] Jesus Christ is still here
[1:36:18] in a body of people
[1:36:23] you say man
[1:36:24] but you have to find him
[1:36:28] and come to him in order to find rest
[1:36:32] so look at what the scriptures have said
[1:36:35] and promised and then watch it being
[1:36:37] fulfilled
[1:36:38] I believe that we're living in the day
[1:36:40] of Jubilee
[1:36:42] this isn't the day of denominations
[1:36:45] they've served their time
[1:36:47] this isn't a day of Creeds and dogmas
[1:36:49] they serve their time this isn't the day
[1:36:53] where personality arises there I know
[1:36:57] they're trying it but it's not the time
[1:36:59] we are not called to follow a
[1:37:02] personality we're not called to follow
[1:37:05] uh some man's ideas
[1:37:08] we're not called I don't care how
[1:37:10] anointed they are if they're drawing uh
[1:37:13] uh and pointing to their personality to
[1:37:15] their own Ministry their own kingdom
[1:37:17] it's wrong we are to look to him in this
[1:37:21] day and be saved
[1:37:25] we've been bound by these things for so
[1:37:27] long
[1:37:28] but God promised a day of Jubilee
[1:37:31] do you believe that
[1:37:33] that's right
[1:37:34] so then
[1:37:36] it's in this day that you will see him
[1:37:39] Christ in the Fulfillment of that
[1:37:44] you ain't gonna see him in a group bound
[1:37:48] are you with me I hope you're making a
[1:37:51] little sense to you
[1:37:52] you ain't gonna see him in a group that
[1:37:54] is bound and formal
[1:37:58] by traditions
[1:38:00] by false doctrines
[1:38:03] by man's and personalities
[1:38:06] no no you ain't gonna see that
[1:38:09] because that's not what God promised us
[1:38:12] in this day
[1:38:13] then you say man he promised us a Year
[1:38:17] of Jubilee
[1:38:19] to where we can break from all of them
[1:38:22] things and be a son and daughter of God
[1:38:26] in this age
[1:38:28] that's what God's called you to be
[1:38:30] do you believe that there have been
[1:38:32] scriptures that have been laying dormant
[1:38:34] for years and years do you realize that
[1:38:37] I have a week ago through the whole
[1:38:39] Bible of scriptures that speak of our
[1:38:41] day
[1:38:42] but but there are scriptures that speak
[1:38:45] all these scriptures speak of the bride
[1:38:47] of Christ
[1:38:48] amen
[1:38:50] and we we know that Adam had a
[1:38:52] counterpart and that was Eve right his
[1:38:55] bride so Jesus is the second man Adam
[1:38:58] has has a counterpart has the bride he's
[1:39:01] got his bride and so not only does the
[1:39:03] scripture speak of of the bridegroom
[1:39:05] which Jesus fulfilled as Messiah but it
[1:39:09] also speaks of that counterpart which is
[1:39:12] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:39:14] and all this time it's been people
[1:39:16] prophets raising up and saying she's
[1:39:19] coming
[1:39:21] she's coming
[1:39:22] she's coming he spoke of her whether it
[1:39:26] be the the wise virgin that was the
[1:39:28] bride ain't that right Revelations 19 7
[1:39:31] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:39:33] honor to him for the marriage of the
[1:39:35] Lamb is come and his wife hath made
[1:39:38] herself ready and to her was granted
[1:39:41] that she should be arrayed in fine linen
[1:39:43] clean and white for the fine linen is
[1:39:46] the righteousness of the saints that
[1:39:48] ain't something in the Millennium that's
[1:39:49] something happening right now that
[1:39:52] speaks of this day then you say Amen
[1:39:54] it's been laying dormant for 2 000 years
[1:39:57] just lay him there but in this age it's
[1:40:00] being fulfilled by a group of people
[1:40:03] called The Bride
[1:40:05] Revelations 22 15 and the spirit and the
[1:40:08] bride
[1:40:09] say come
[1:40:11] what is it the word is in the bride
[1:40:14] then you say Amen she has returned to
[1:40:17] being the mouthpiece of God in this age
[1:40:21] yes sir see so we as elective God are
[1:40:25] not foretelling of the bride of Christ
[1:40:27] that is to come
[1:40:29] we are the bride
[1:40:31] we are the Fulfillment of all scriptures
[1:40:35] that speak of the Bride
[1:40:38] you with me
[1:40:39] there's no other age to come we're at
[1:40:42] the end of this thing
[1:40:44] so Christ is not revealed as as a spoken
[1:40:48] word but he's revealed in the
[1:40:50] manifestation of the word
[1:40:53] and you say man
[1:40:55] or I should say not only in the in the
[1:40:57] in the spoken word but in the revealed
[1:40:59] word
[1:41:00] now we are living in the time of the
[1:41:03] word fulfilled we are the Fulfillment of
[1:41:05] the prophet's prophecy
[1:41:07] I got to ask you what's greater the
[1:41:08] prophet or the prophecy
[1:41:11] amen
[1:41:13] okay that stumped you
[1:41:16] you see it's Christ in you
[1:41:20] and what is Christ in you the word made
[1:41:22] manifest
[1:41:24] not a gimmick
[1:41:26] not a sensation
[1:41:28] not a good feeling you got
[1:41:30] it's the word made manifest
[1:41:34] ain't that right
[1:41:36] and if you notice it took a prophet to
[1:41:39] introduce Jesus
[1:41:40] when he came in his to the world in his
[1:41:43] physical body
[1:41:45] John the Baptist introduced him to the
[1:41:47] People by pointing him out the whole
[1:41:49] dilemma of God which taketh away the
[1:41:51] sins of the world
[1:41:52] the prophet introduced us ain't that
[1:41:55] right
[1:41:56] and Jesus being the word Jesus being the
[1:41:58] word came to the prophet not to the
[1:42:00] Theologian not to the teacher not to the
[1:42:03] the religious he came to that prophet
[1:42:06] amen and the prophet had the revelation
[1:42:09] of the word standing before them ain't
[1:42:13] that right
[1:42:14] amen but why did he have to be why was
[1:42:16] it important that Jesus be introduced
[1:42:19] because the people were steep in
[1:42:21] Traditions
[1:42:23] people had been taught over and over and
[1:42:26] over traditions of men interpretations
[1:42:29] of man of what Messiah should be when he
[1:42:32] would come and how he would come and
[1:42:33] when he would come and where he would
[1:42:35] come and and all of these things and and
[1:42:39] and and and so it left the people in
[1:42:41] confusion it left the people in darkness
[1:42:43] because no matter what their
[1:42:45] interpretation was it never changed
[1:42:48] God's reality it never changed what
[1:42:51] God's interpretation was ain't that
[1:42:53] right it never in in it never changed
[1:42:56] amen saved but but they didn't have him
[1:42:59] born in a as a baby in a Manger they
[1:43:02] didn't have him coming to a prophet that
[1:43:04] that was just a wild man coming down to
[1:43:07] the creek amen uh they didn't have him
[1:43:10] that way they had him coming in in in in
[1:43:12] in in other ways you know but but so it
[1:43:15] took a prophet to introduce him to the
[1:43:19] people
[1:43:20] that that elect could know
[1:43:24] Christ when he came
[1:43:28] amen so have we had a prophet in this
[1:43:30] age
[1:43:31] can you say Amen we've had a prophet
[1:43:34] Malachi 4 5. behold I will send you
[1:43:37] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[1:43:40] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[1:43:42] and he shall turn the heart of the
[1:43:43] fathers to the children and the Heart of
[1:43:45] the children to their fathers lest I
[1:43:47] come and smite the Earth with a curse
[1:43:49] can you say man
[1:43:50] now as I close it's the prophet
[1:43:54] that has the Divine interpretation of
[1:43:57] the word
[1:43:59] theologians will come
[1:44:02] and will interpret their own in their
[1:44:04] own thoughts about the word
[1:44:06] but when a prophet comes he has no
[1:44:09] thought on of his own
[1:44:10] he is the mouthpiece of God and he gives
[1:44:13] us the correct interpretation of what
[1:44:16] this Bible is
[1:44:18] that way we can see him Christ
[1:44:21] revealed then you say man and he's
[1:44:25] revealed in his own word
[1:44:27] oh
[1:44:29] not just because we've gathered
[1:44:31] but he's revealed in his word
[1:44:35] ain't that right and the people are
[1:44:38] walking in darkness today and he's come
[1:44:40] as a thief in the night and there's some
[1:44:42] Jewels he's come for and I I just have
[1:44:45] to tell you I'm one of them
[1:44:46] I'm one of them and and I I've come to
[1:44:49] him I've come to him and I'm finding
[1:44:51] Rest In My Soul I'm finding more that
[1:44:54] this message is more than just a man I
[1:44:56] see God over that man and I that's where
[1:44:59] the message really come from amen he
[1:45:01] just used the mouthpiece can you say man
[1:45:04] amen and the prophet could take that
[1:45:07] word and place the scriptures we didn't
[1:45:09] know what the word meant we had no idea
[1:45:11] but as he even said he was a Baptist
[1:45:13] amen and and had Baptist ways and all
[1:45:16] that but when the word was revealed to
[1:45:18] him he said this book become a new book
[1:45:20] and I say to you this book has become a
[1:45:23] new book and it's not only just a new
[1:45:25] book it's actually we see it now in
[1:45:27] flesh the word is being made flesh in a
[1:45:31] group of people Christ made real can you
[1:45:35] say man it's a body of Christ upon the
[1:45:39] earth that is fulfilling every prophecy
[1:45:42] that speaks of her in this day I say to
[1:45:45] you look and live house
[1:45:47] look and live
[1:45:50] come and find rest
[1:45:53] find rest for your soul
[1:45:57] Allelujah
[1:46:03] the prophet has the Divine correct
[1:46:06] interpretation
[1:46:07] you remember in the Old Testament
[1:46:10] God wrote some words on the wall
[1:46:14] and that word could not be interpreted
[1:46:17] no one knew the meaning of that word
[1:46:20] the king he called all the his
[1:46:23] soothsayers and diviners and all of
[1:46:25] these guys in
[1:46:27] told him what he would give them if they
[1:46:30] would interpret the meaning of the words
[1:46:32] that God had put on the wall
[1:46:35] they had no idea
[1:46:38] I couldn't tell it the King was troubled
[1:46:42] he was upset about it
[1:46:44] but then his wife I believe it was his
[1:46:46] wife says hey hold it
[1:46:48] be it rest O King
[1:46:50] there's a man
[1:46:52] that was in your father's Kingdom
[1:46:55] that he gave the interpretation of a
[1:46:57] dream to your father
[1:46:59] calling
[1:47:01] call him have him to come he'll
[1:47:03] interpret it
[1:47:04] they called that old Prophet Daniel
[1:47:08] amen
[1:47:09] and the King says I've heard that that
[1:47:11] the gods of gods is in you that you have
[1:47:15] that gift to Divine or to interpret in
[1:47:18] in these things and and
[1:47:20] Daniel under the unctioning of the Holy
[1:47:23] Ghost began to interpret what the words
[1:47:26] of God had put on that wall can you say
[1:47:28] man
[1:47:29] and church this interpretation has been
[1:47:31] sealed up it's been hid it's it's been
[1:47:34] you know uh uh from the foundation of
[1:47:38] the world but men have put their own
[1:47:40] ideas to what the Rapture should be
[1:47:42] oh my they put their own ideas as to
[1:47:46] what the resurrection is they put their
[1:47:48] own ideas to all kinds of things some
[1:47:51] say we're still in the you know I had
[1:47:52] one man tell me he said well we're in
[1:47:54] the sixth Church age
[1:47:55] I looked I said oh my in my heart I'd
[1:47:58] say God I thank God for a prophet you'll
[1:48:00] see everybody has tried to interpret the
[1:48:02] words of the book and they've not been
[1:48:04] able to but here come a lamb the lamb
[1:48:08] that opened the seals as we talked about
[1:48:10] this morning but he had to have a
[1:48:12] prophet on the earth and when he had
[1:48:14] that profit he come and gave the book to
[1:48:16] the prophet and the prophet began to

[1:48:24] what's happening
[1:48:26] we understand the day that we're living
[1:48:28] in we understand that we're not looking
[1:48:30] for another church age but now we're
[1:48:33] looking for an eternal Church age we're
[1:48:35] understanding that we're at the end of
[1:48:37] time we're at the end of everything but
[1:48:39] it's at this time that the manifestation
[1:48:41] of the sons of God is to be revealed
[1:48:43] ain't that right all scriptures

[1:49:25] and I say to you this message reveals
[1:49:29] Christ

[1:49:34] you're blinded by traditions
[1:49:36] may God and remember it's in this age is
[1:49:40] it not in the age of laodicea that he
[1:49:43] tells you I've got Isaac come to me and
[1:49:47] anoint thy eyes with thyself so that
[1:49:49] thou may see right it's in this age why
