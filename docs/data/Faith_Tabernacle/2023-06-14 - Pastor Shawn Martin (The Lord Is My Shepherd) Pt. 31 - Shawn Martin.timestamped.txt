[40:40] um
[40:40] as was mentioned to keep brother Jerry
[40:43] in our prayers is

[40:50] Lord just be with him and bring him
[40:53] through this situation
[40:56] and also brother Josh binens having his
[41:00] meeting starting a week from today
[41:02] um

[41:17] will
[41:17] amen he's going to be having his church
[41:20] dedication and got a beautiful Sanctuary
[41:24] there that the Lord blessed them with
[41:27] and um and so he's got a wonderful

[41:38] blessing to them amen well it's good to
[41:41] be here
[41:42] house Lord and trust you all had a good
[41:45] day today
[41:46] it's hard to believe that we're in June
[41:49] and um
[41:52] already getting I guess close to the
[41:54] middle of it and um
[41:56] thing Brother Sam was saying two more
[41:58] weeks and the day starts getting shorter
[42:01] that's just hard to believe that but you
[42:04] know what every day that comes it just
[42:07] brings us closer to the Lord or the
[42:09] coming of the Lord
[42:11] and Satan is fighting harder than he
[42:15] ever has
[42:17] um against the the bride of Christ but I
[42:21] I believe that there's we're going to
[42:24] endure and we must endure we must keep
[42:26] pressing pressing on Amen no matter what
[42:30] you go through no matter what uh things
[42:34] happen we've got to keep our eyes upon
[42:37] Christ amen
[42:38] amen can't turn back he that endures to
[42:42] the end the same shall be saved and uh
[42:45] God never promised that he would make it
[42:47] easy for us
[42:48] but he did promise we'll go through
[42:50] he'll take us through amen and so before
[42:54] we go into the word may we just bow our
[42:57] heads our hearts to the Lord and talk to
[43:00] him
[43:01] Lord Jesus we counted an honored to
[43:05] to be gathered here this evening
[43:08] father we thank you Lord for allowing us
[43:13] to live in this age
[43:15] Lord
[43:17] there's just so many things that are
[43:20] going on that your scriptures
[43:23] have talked about and we have longed and
[43:27] waited man has longed for these days and
[43:31] here we are Lord
[43:33] scripture is being fulfilled
[43:36] but you're bringing your church to the
[43:38] finale Lord all that was in your mind
[43:43] Lord you're bringing us to this and
[43:46] we're so thankful Lord to be part of it
[43:50] so glad that we have the heart to
[43:52] believe the eyes to see the the
[43:56] understanding
[43:58] and father we humbly just ask that you
[44:00] would help us to understand more and
[44:03] May Lord you take all unbelief out of
[44:07] his father
[44:09] I pray that you just your character be
[44:14] molded in every one of his father
[44:17] oh God that's our cry that's our prayer
[44:21] Lord when the Trials come upon us Lord
[44:24] may we may may we not uh have an evil
[44:30] heart of just our heart become hardened
[44:32] to them
[44:33] but Lord may we become more pliable in
[44:36] your hands more soft into your hands as
[44:40] you the Potter molding your clay
[44:43] and oh Father we ask that you would move
[44:46] among us this evening take what simple
[44:49] words we have and Lord as you did the
[44:52] the fishing loaves you multiplied it I
[44:54] pray that you would do it for us today
[44:57] Lord and let it be planted in each and
[45:00] every heart we ask it in Jesus Christ's
[45:03] name and the church says
[45:06] amen amen
[45:09] we want to just go back to Psalms 23 and
[45:13] starting at the first verse
[45:15] but it says the Lord is my shepherd I
[45:19] shall not one he maketh me to lie down
[45:21] in Green Pastures he leadeth me
[45:24] beside the Still Waters he restoreth my
[45:27] soul eliteth me in the paths of
[45:30] righteousness for his name's sake
[45:33] yea though I walk through the valley of
[45:36] the shadow of death I will fear no evil
[45:39] for thou art with me thy rod and thy
[45:43] staff they comfort me
[45:46] amen you can have your seats
[45:51] this evening we we can look at the
[45:54] scriptures here and identify with what
[45:57] David is speaking of
[45:59] and for we know that we're walking in
[46:03] the Valley of the shadow of death and
[46:07] yet David would tell us and of course he
[46:12] would
[46:13] be the voice of a bride for we would
[46:16] agree we would say it wholeheartedly
[46:20] that we feel fear no evil
[46:24] amen David says though I walk through
[46:26] the valley of the shadow of death I fear
[46:28] no evil
[46:30] this Valley of the shadow of death is
[46:33] not a paradise it's it's a it's a place
[46:36] where darkness is present
[46:39] David is surrounded by corruption so are
[46:42] we
[46:44] surrounded by you know sickness and
[46:47] disease and subject to failures and you
[46:51] know Temptations and the trials and
[46:54] subject to discouragement to weaknesses
[46:57] and all of these things because he's in
[47:00] the Valley of the shadow of death
[47:03] his life was not without problems and
[47:06] neither are ours
[47:08] every one of us we have our challenges
[47:12] we have our issues we have things that
[47:15] we face I mean that's just a given
[47:18] and and yet David says I will fear no
[47:22] evil
[47:23] for thou art with me
[47:27] that's the key so we compare this with
[47:30] today we are living in the evilest age
[47:33] ever
[47:34] trouble is on every side we've we've
[47:37] read it we've heard the prophets say it
[47:39] but the lid has come off of hell and
[47:43] streams of demon power is pouring from
[47:46] everywhere's it's conquered the Nations
[47:48] it's conquered politics till it's rotten
[47:51] to the core it's conquered the churches
[47:54] until they know nothing but denomination
[47:56] it's it's that's it's actually been
[47:58] prophesied that the world would go
[48:01] completely insane
[48:04] and and brother Branham would say
[48:08] complete complete total insanity
[48:12] complete total insanity this world will
[48:16] go into right away and he would tell us
[48:20] it's almost there now and that was what
[48:23] 50 some years or so ago or more and he
[48:27] says you see the footsteps of it and he
[48:31] said there it is it's marching right out
[48:34] on the street right down the church pew
[48:36] Total Insanity do things that a human
[48:40] being wouldn't think of doing and being
[48:42] civilized
[48:44] we know that in this Valley of the
[48:46] shadow of death That Hideous things are
[48:49] coming upon the Earth and it's only
[48:51] going to get worse and and worse and and
[48:55] these things are not natural things as
[48:58] the prophet tells us but they're
[48:59] spiritual things it will make people
[49:02] scream for the rocks and the mountains
[49:04] and everything else to fall on them we
[49:07] look today in this in this world that
[49:10] we're walking through uh the
[49:12] homosexuality is is taking over the
[49:16] world
[49:16] transgender and and and these things and
[49:20] and brother Branham speaking of
[49:22] homosexuality and uh he explains the
[49:26] reason why it's it's coming at a rapid
[49:30] pace and he said it's because men has
[49:35] run around with women and women with men
[49:37] so much until the sacredness between a
[49:41] man and woman has lost its values
[49:44] so so this this this goes back to uh how
[49:50] valuable you sisters are uh of of
[49:54] keeping yourself holy uh undefiled your
[49:59] morals in keeping Holiness and not not
[50:03] allowing yourself uh to dress in a sexy
[50:06] way to where men will lust after you uh
[50:10] you you you you are a rare specimen if I
[50:14] could say it that way uh men Brethren
[50:17] you are uh you're not cheating on your
[50:21] wives you're being faithful you're being
[50:22] loyal uh you're you're not getting
[50:25] caught up in the the the the sexualities
[50:29] of this of this age and all of these
[50:32] things and you're you're keeping your
[50:35] relationship clean and and pure and
[50:39] sacred whereas as it it caught up with
[50:43] with them now when they you know they
[50:45] all these divorces that we have today
[50:48] and and uh you know it but but what it
[50:53] is the marriage has lost its sacredness
[50:55] relationship and has lost its sacredness
[50:58] and it is cause perversion to come to
[51:03] become predominant in the world today
[51:06] now the prophet says we know that this
[51:09] is a wicked and adulterous generation
[51:11] there's never been a time since Sodom
[51:13] that homosexuals and perversion was on
[51:16] the March as it is now he said you go in
[51:19] my office and read the mail of mothers
[51:21] from California and around about their
[51:22] boys living and it's terrible he said I
[51:25] picked up a paper a couple years ago
[51:27] flying over Los Angeles where it said
[51:29] that the great sin of Sodom was on such
[51:32] an increase there until it had increased
[51:35] 20 percent over the year before and all
[51:39] out through even to government officials
[51:43] and it's everywhere now we can truly see
[51:46] that it's everywhere it's it's in
[51:48] schools it's in churches it's in
[51:50] government it's it's everywhere and it's
[51:53] because that women has made themselves
[51:56] so cheap they have brought it upon
[51:58] themselves it's it's become a cheap
[52:01] Affair used to be you took off your hat
[52:04] to a woman on the street and you do it
[52:06] now she'd Laugh In Your Face see we've
[52:09] made ourselves a bunch of corruption so
[52:12] degrading ourselves another place he
[52:15] said they are taking these uh teenage
[52:18] girls out and give them marijuana you
[52:21] know
[52:22] um
[52:23] it's it's uh uh it's amazing how people
[52:26] you know religious people think
[52:28] marijuana is all right
[52:30] because they've legalized it
[52:33] and but yet brother Brown said here
[52:35] they're taking they take these little
[52:36] teenage girls out and give them
[52:38] marijuana why what do they do they tell
[52:41] them a little friendly drink it's got
[52:43] and it's got to a place they know that
[52:47] raises passions in human life now don't
[52:51] don't don't you know don't tell me that
[52:54] that Satan knows exactly what he's doing
[52:57] he knows exactly what he's doing and it
[53:00] goes all back that educations of the
[53:02] devil Sciences of the devil and I have
[53:05] to tell you technology is of the devil
[53:07] if and if you're not a Holy Ghost Field
[53:10] individual a man them things will take
[53:13] over your life to where you can't
[53:15] control what you're doing what you're
[53:17] looking at what you're listening to what
[53:20] you're what what is dominating your life
[53:22] it's all of the devil
[53:25] ain't that right amen and we know that
[53:28] God can use them things he's used he
[53:30] used television and and and them things
[53:33] but but it but nonetheless it's of the
[53:35] devil it it comes from all that it just
[53:39] comes from the devil ain't that right
[53:40] and so but but we're finding that it's
[53:44] it's these these things that the world
[53:47] is producing and and they're anointed of
[53:50] a spirit I believe it and and because I
[53:54] see the product of what the what's
[53:56] what's producing but I believe that
[53:59] Hollywood is of the devil I I believe
[54:01] you know these men and women that that
[54:04] that have have come up with all of this
[54:07] technology and all that I believe it's
[54:09] an inspiration from from a worldly
[54:11] spirit I just believe that and and it's
[54:15] it's because uh Satan knows and and look
[54:18] look at the increase of our of of how
[54:22] many men how many good men Godly men
[54:25] have fallen because of that stupid
[54:28] internet you understand what I'm saying
[54:30] uh how many good preachers have fallen
[54:33] uh uh into sin because they got trapped
[54:37] and they got hooked up on the technology
[54:39] and I don't care if it's Facebook I
[54:42] don't care if it's Instagram I don't
[54:44] care what it is uh there's more passions
[54:47] that are running out uh uh uh being
[54:50] being dominant or predominant or
[54:53] whatever you want to call it in the
[54:55] people today than it ever has before
[54:58] ain't that right amen and so here now
[55:02] and and I believe that they I believe
[55:05] that the world knows what they're doing
[55:07] I believe they know they've marketed
[55:10] human beings they've marketed they know
[55:13] what draws they know what appeals they
[55:16] know what attracts they know that them
[55:19] sexy little old clothes attracts them
[55:22] young people they know these things and
[55:25] so now see they've got it so they
[55:27] they're they're getting these teenage
[55:28] girls he says out give them marijuana
[55:30] and what do they do they tell them all
[55:32] just a little friendly drink till it's
[55:34] got to a place they know that raises
[55:38] passions in human life little boys and
[55:41] girls till they're becoming completely
[55:44] insane so the world knows what they're
[55:48] doing can you say amen and and if they
[55:51] don't the devil does
[55:54] ain't that right the devil does and so
[55:58] in the message and knoweth it not a man
[56:02] brother Branham says there will come a
[56:04] time in the name of the Lord that people
[56:05] will go completely insane and the Bible
[56:09] said so they'll scream and haul a great
[56:12] hideous things in their imaginary mind
[56:15] and and how does it get to that point
[56:17] how does it get into the imaginary I
[56:21] believe it's it's by the production of
[56:23] Hollywood I I I believe they they began
[56:27] to work upon the people's minds and and
[56:31] even brother Branham talks about the
[56:33] comic books and and how that it's
[56:35] preparing the little children's mind for
[56:38] a blast that he's going to give them
[56:39] down the road and we're seeing that
[56:42] blast take place we're seeing what he's
[56:44] doing to the young people of the day
[56:47] ain't that right amen and so they'll
[56:50] scream and haul or great hideous things
[56:52] in their imagination and they remind
[56:54] behind the radials and things are
[56:56] television programs are producing it
[56:59] ain't that right there will be such
[57:01] things as ants raise up on Earth and and
[57:05] that will be as high as 14 trees a bird
[57:08] will fly across the Earth with wings
[57:10] four or five miles across and people
[57:13] will see them they will see them they'll
[57:16] scream and holler and cry for Mercy but
[57:19] it'll be the plagues ain't that right
[57:20] now it ain't going to be a literal thing
[57:22] it's it's an imaginary thing but that
[57:25] that's that's shows that people are
[57:27] going insane ain't that right amen I
[57:31] mean we we know it's the insanity if a
[57:34] man can if if the world is calling a man
[57:38] because he wants to be a woman they'll
[57:40] call that guy a woman and and identify
[57:43] with that guy as a woman that's got to
[57:45] be Insanity you understand what I'm
[57:48] saying so so we're understanding how
[57:51] dark and and what this Valley of the
[57:54] Shadow of death means
[57:56] as we're walking in it this because
[57:59] we're in the most evil age ever what
[58:02] David was talking about we're
[58:04] experiencing in in its greatest
[58:07] form uh uh today ain't that right amen
[58:12] you young people you're fighting things
[58:14] that I never had to fight you're
[58:16] fighting things that Grandpa never had
[58:18] to fight and and and down down the road
[58:21] you are fighting things because it's a
[58:24] it's you're walking in the valley of a
[58:27] shadow of death ain't that right but
[58:29] notice what David said I will fear no
[58:33] evil for thou art with me ain't that
[58:38] right now Jesus promised that he would
[58:41] come to us a man and and now remember
[58:44] David said the fear was gone because he
[58:48] recognized that that Christ was with him
[58:51] the shepherd thou art with me amen and
[58:55] so we're looking in this age and how
[58:58] that Jesus promised he gave that promise
[59:01] that I I come and and in in Matthew 12
[59:05] and 39 Jesus said an adulteress or an
[59:09] evil and adulterous generation seeketh
[59:11] after a sign and there shall no sign be
[59:15] given it to it but the sign of the
[59:19] Prophet Jonas ain't that right for as
[59:21] Jonas was three days and three nights in
[59:24] the Will's belly so shall the son of man
[59:27] be three days and three nights in the
[59:29] heart of the earth now what brother
[59:31] Branham tells us is that that that is
[59:35] the sign that we would be given and that
[59:38] would be the sign of the Resurrection
[59:40] ain't that right the sign of the
[59:43] resurrection showing that Christ is
[59:47] alive and well and he is among us today
[59:50] you believe that so now brother Brown
[59:53] says see in that very hour of that
[59:58] Wicked and adulterous generation you
[1:00:00] believe we're in that living in that
[1:00:01] Wicked and altruous Generation Well
[1:00:03] brother Brown says we are amen this is
[1:00:06] the age he said Jesus Christ rises in
[1:00:10] the power of his resurrection to prove
[1:00:13] that he's Alive forevermore the same
[1:00:16] yesterday today and forever but Jesus
[1:00:20] said the world won't receive it amen
[1:00:23] they cannot receive it they will not see
[1:00:26] it and and neither do they know him
[1:00:28] ain't that right so so in this coming
[1:00:32] amen uh when he comes uh there will be a
[1:00:36] the majority of the people will not
[1:00:39] recognize him will not see him you can
[1:00:43] preach about him you can show the signs
[1:00:45] you can they could see it right before
[1:00:48] them and they still won't believe it
[1:00:50] they won't receive it because it doesn't
[1:00:52] know them no him that neither does it
[1:00:57] see him amen but John 14 20 says but at
[1:01:01] that day at that day the day of his
[1:01:05] coming you shall know that I am in my
[1:01:07] father you and me and I in you ain't
[1:01:11] that right so it's more than just
[1:01:13] knowing that he has come amen but
[1:01:16] knowing where he is at amen I am in my
[1:01:20] father you and me and I in you ain't
[1:01:24] that right so it's a personal revelation
[1:01:27] and the world will not believe it it
[1:01:29] will not receive it no matter how much
[1:01:32] evidence God has shown that he is here
[1:01:35] today the world will never accept it but
[1:01:39] how do we know that he is here amen well
[1:01:43] well brother Branham he he said uh uh
[1:01:47] you know that the the purpose of his
[1:01:50] ministry was to make the presence of the
[1:01:54] Lord known to us ain't that right amen
[1:01:58] that that's the purpose of of the the
[1:02:00] message of the hour if there's ever a
[1:02:03] time a man that we need to understand
[1:02:05] the purpose of of of the ministry of
[1:02:08] brother Branham and that is to know that
[1:02:11] Jesus Christ is here Among Us ain't that
[1:02:16] right we're walking in the Valley of the
[1:02:18] shadow of death but there's one thing a
[1:02:21] man that takes the fear away from us is
[1:02:24] knowing that Jesus Christ is here with
[1:02:28] us ain't that rhyme amen and we find
[1:02:31] that the same sign that Melchizedek
[1:02:34] performed to Abraham is the same exact
[1:02:37] sign that Jesus performed to the Jew and
[1:02:40] the Samaritan ain't that right amen and
[1:02:43] that same sign has been performed in
[1:02:47] this last day to the Gentile church or
[1:02:50] the race amen I want to just read it
[1:02:53] here but Genesis 18 and 12 a man
[1:02:56] Melchizedek standing there before
[1:02:58] Abraham and he's telling Abraham about a
[1:03:01] promise the promise I'm going to visit
[1:03:03] you according to the time of life and
[1:03:06] and these things and and and and it says
[1:03:09] therefore Sarah laughed within herself a
[1:03:13] man in herself she didn't laugh out loud
[1:03:15] a man but she was in the tent behind
[1:03:18] Melchizedek amen and she chuckled with
[1:03:21] inner self amen and and saying after I
[1:03:25] am waxed old shall I have pleasure my
[1:03:28] Lord being old also and the Lord
[1:03:31] Melchizedek amen said unto Abraham
[1:03:34] wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I
[1:03:37] of a surety bear a child which am old
[1:03:40] see is there anything too hard for the
[1:03:43] Lord at that point in time I will return
[1:03:46] unto thee according to the time of life
[1:03:48] and Sarah shall have a son now Sarah
[1:03:51] heard heard what Melchizedek said
[1:03:54] Abraham him and she went out and she
[1:03:56] denied that she laughed she says I
[1:03:58] didn't laugh amen and and for she was
[1:04:01] afraid and Melchizedek said but yes you
[1:04:04] did laugh ain't that right well then you
[1:04:07] find that same sign that Jesus did uh he
[1:04:10] done it many times but but it's a woman
[1:04:12] at the well John 4 4 15. uh Jesus
[1:04:16] talking to the Samaritan woman and the
[1:04:19] woman saith unto him sir give me this
[1:04:21] water that I thirst not and either come
[1:04:23] hither to draw and Jesus saith unto her
[1:04:26] go call thy husband and come hither the
[1:04:28] woman answered and said I have no
[1:04:30] husband Jesus said unto her thou has
[1:04:32] well said I have no husband for thou has
[1:04:35] had five husbands and he whom thou uh
[1:04:39] now has is not thy husband in that set
[1:04:43] us thou truly and the woman said sir I
[1:04:47] perceive that thou art a prophet she
[1:04:49] recognized him as the Messiah the
[1:04:53] prophet that they had been way waiting
[1:04:55] for it by that sign ain't that right so
[1:04:58] Jesus Promised at that same sign would
[1:05:01] happen again and I know we know these
[1:05:03] things but I'm going back over it Luke
[1:05:05] 17 20 likewise also as it was in the
[1:05:09] days of lot amen now this is a a
[1:05:13] scripture that is a mystery to many many
[1:05:15] people a man likewise also as it was in
[1:05:19] the days of lot they did eat they did
[1:05:22] drink they uh they bought they sold they
[1:05:25] planted they built it are we not here
[1:05:27] living in that age see so this is a
[1:05:31] prophecy speaking of this age but the
[1:05:34] same day that lot went out of Sodom it
[1:05:36] rained fire and brimstone from heaven
[1:05:38] and destroyed them all even thus shall
[1:05:41] it be in the day when the son of man is
[1:05:44] revealed so by looking at the the
[1:05:47] condition of the world we can say that
[1:05:49] this scripture is being fulfilled and
[1:05:51] has been fulfilled right before our eyes
[1:05:54] in this generation ain't that right so
[1:05:57] the world the the church nominal uh most
[1:06:00] of them they'll look at that scripture
[1:06:02] and then they can agree with it we're
[1:06:03] here amen the building that's going on
[1:06:06] all these restaurants and and uh uh
[1:06:09] people are more chubbier than they used
[1:06:11] to be and and just eat eat you know and
[1:06:14] and we got all the entertainment and
[1:06:16] we're building in in all of these things
[1:06:19] and we can we can identify the condition
[1:06:21] of the World by that scripture and say
[1:06:24] that we're we're here but then the
[1:06:27] prophet would let us uh on in in uh on a
[1:06:31] secret and and he tells us but Abraham
[1:06:34] was in that day as well Abraham was not
[1:06:38] in Sodom and Gomorrah he was outside of
[1:06:40] it he was not partaken of all the sins
[1:06:43] and the filth and all the the nonsense
[1:06:46] that was going on ain't that right but
[1:06:49] he was up there talking to Melchizedek
[1:06:52] and he was receiving a promise us and he
[1:06:54] was seeing the sign of Melchizedek a man
[1:06:59] see he was fellowshipping he was talking
[1:07:01] with the king of Salem which is the Lord
[1:07:04] of glory amen and so Jesus says As it
[1:07:08] was in the days of lot so shall it be in
[1:07:12] the revealing or in the day when the son
[1:07:15] of man is revealed ain't that right well
[1:07:19] Melchizedek did not reveal himself to
[1:07:21] lot he did not reveal himself to Sodom
[1:07:23] and Gomorrah he only revealed himself to
[1:07:26] Abraham which was the elect of God ain't
[1:07:29] that right so I want to say this Abraham
[1:07:32] did not go down the lot and Sodom and
[1:07:34] Gomorrah and tell them about Abel about
[1:07:37] his experience with Melchizedek amen see
[1:07:40] it was to Abraham and and and and and
[1:07:44] Melchizedek gave him a promise ain't
[1:07:48] that right a man say so so we find that
[1:07:51] the son of man is revealed only to the
[1:07:55] elect of this day a man says so so what
[1:07:59] I'm saying is we believe that he's here
[1:08:01] and only the elect will know that he's
[1:08:04] here by the sign that they have been
[1:08:07] shown and has been revealed to them amen
[1:08:10] we we can say well I dance but that
[1:08:12] don't mean he's here well I prophesy
[1:08:14] that doesn't mean that he's here well I
[1:08:16] I I've ran the building that doesn't
[1:08:18] mean that he's here you understand what
[1:08:20] I'm saying but when we saw the sign of
[1:08:24] Melchizedek a man performed in this day
[1:08:27] then we can declare as the scripture
[1:08:29] says he is here and he has come to us
[1:08:33] ain't that right amen says so this bride
[1:08:36] is taking refuge in the fact that his
[1:08:40] presence is here his presence aren't you
[1:08:42] glad that the presence of God is here
[1:08:45] amen now notice a man stood before
[1:08:48] brother Branham in the prayer line and
[1:08:50] we could go through a lot of these and
[1:08:52] and I didn't just one amen because
[1:08:55] you've heard it many times but he stood
[1:08:57] before brother Branham in the prayer
[1:08:59] line brother Brown says see the man's a
[1:09:01] stranger I don't know him but Christ
[1:09:03] does see but sir I see you're Shadow
[1:09:06] there's a Darkness I see them taking you
[1:09:08] into a building it's a hospital and then
[1:09:10] you had an operation then you had
[1:09:13] another operation and they were for
[1:09:15] cancer and the cancer remained the
[1:09:18] doctor has failed to get it but he
[1:09:20] cannot hide from Jesus you're not from
[1:09:23] this city you're from a smaller city
[1:09:25] than this uh looks like he said it's
[1:09:27] Rockford Illinois is where you're from
[1:09:30] and your name is Leonard I believe they
[1:09:32] call you and your address is 3034 8th
[1:09:35] Street see what was it the same sign
[1:09:38] that Melchizedek performed that Jesus
[1:09:40] performed is the same sign that has been
[1:09:43] performed in this day can you say Amen
[1:09:46] so now we can say as David though I walk
[1:09:49] to the valley of this shadow of death I
[1:09:51] will fear no evil for thou art with me
[1:09:54] thou art with me aren't you glad he's
[1:09:56] with you amen yes sir brother Brandon
[1:09:59] would tell us he says he tell the people
[1:10:01] he said now you don't have to have a
[1:10:02] prayer card the prayer card has nothing
[1:10:04] to do with it just give you a lot and a
[1:10:07] number to Stand Here by sometimes we
[1:10:09] call from one place then another no
[1:10:12] matter where it's at no matter where we
[1:10:14] call a man or and all these things we
[1:10:17] just call a few people up here so that
[1:10:20] the presence of God can be known in the
[1:10:24] audience ain't that right so by his
[1:10:26] ministry by that gift amen it was
[1:10:29] allowing the people to see that the
[1:10:33] presence of God was here he says see and
[1:10:36] when the people realize that Christ is
[1:10:38] here that he's not dead but he's raised
[1:10:41] from the dead and he's the same in
[1:10:43] principle and power thousands reach up
[1:10:45] and accept him and that's when the
[1:10:48] healing takes place another place he
[1:10:50] says I've seen him move over the people
[1:10:52] and show himself over here on the side
[1:10:55] of a wall and went down upon a man and
[1:10:58] come down here and up through the
[1:11:00] building making known the secrets of the
[1:11:02] heart which is the identification of his
[1:11:05] presence to show that he's the same
[1:11:08] yesterday today and forever he's in our
[1:11:11] midst aren't you glad he's in our midst
[1:11:13] amen why because someone tells us that
[1:11:16] why because you felt a goosebump why
[1:11:18] because you shed a tear that has nothing
[1:11:21] to do with it at all see amen
[1:11:23] everybody's got the presence of God
[1:11:25] identified with something where I spoke
[1:11:28] in tongues I got the holy ghost that
[1:11:30] don't mean nothing amen and and so they
[1:11:32] put the they they put all the emphasis
[1:11:34] on gifts they put all the emphasis on
[1:11:36] shouting and the jumping and the dancing
[1:11:38] and the hollering and the music and all
[1:11:41] of these things it has nothing to do
[1:11:43] with it amen but he come and he revealed
[1:11:46] himself by showing the sign of Messiah
[1:11:48] it's a scripture signed church can you
[1:11:51] say amen amen why so we wouldn't be
[1:11:53] views as to what we are and who we are
[1:11:56] and where he is and and what's going on
[1:11:59] around us I will not fear for thou art
[1:12:02] with me can you say Amen as a parent I
[1:12:05] will not fear over my children because
[1:12:08] thou art with me as a preacher I will
[1:12:11] not fear over the church because thou
[1:12:13] art with us can you say amen amen and
[1:12:16] that's the stance that we all take amen
[1:12:18] as message Believers as those that have
[1:12:21] seen Christ revealed in this age his
[1:12:24] presence is Among Us
[1:12:27] do you believe that a man's seat now
[1:12:30] brother Branham says when we read it
[1:12:31] last Wednesday I believe there cannot be
[1:12:33] the presence of God without Supernatural
[1:12:35] things happening never did Jehovah ever
[1:12:37] appear without the supernatural
[1:12:39] following him now so God never comes on
[1:12:43] the scene unless it's to fulfill his
[1:12:45] word he doesn't come to show off he
[1:12:48] doesn't come Amen to tickle our fancy he
[1:12:50] comes for one thing and that's to
[1:12:52] fulfill his word amen and if you're part
[1:12:54] of that word then there's going that
[1:12:55] word is going to take effect upon you he
[1:12:58] come for you do you believe that he come
[1:13:01] for you if you're part of the word for
[1:13:03] this age he come for you amen that's the
[1:13:06] whole reason he didn't come for brother
[1:13:07] Branham it in alone amen he didn't come
[1:13:10] so we could all ooh and all over brother
[1:13:12] Branham amen that that's not the whole
[1:13:14] point at all amen we look at the
[1:13:17] ministry of brother Branham and we can
[1:13:19] say that Jesus Christ is here that he
[1:13:21] didn't leave when brother Branham left
[1:13:23] amen the supernatural didn't leave when
[1:13:25] brother Branham left amen that word is
[1:13:28] still being effective today because he's
[1:13:31] here to fulfill the word of God
[1:13:33] and so no matter how many years go by
[1:13:36] God remembers his word and keeps his
[1:13:39] word
[1:13:40] now in in Exodus three and seven the
[1:13:43] Lord said unto Moses I have surely seen
[1:13:45] the Affliction of my people which are in
[1:13:48] Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason
[1:13:50] of their task Masters for I know their
[1:13:52] sorrow you understand that God knows
[1:13:55] your sorrow God knows what you're going
[1:13:57] through how many believes that and God
[1:13:59] knows God knows God knows what you're
[1:14:01] going through amen God knows that the
[1:14:03] the situation God knows the
[1:14:05] discouragements God knows the Mind
[1:14:07] battles God knows the the the the
[1:14:09] testings God knows the battles God knows
[1:14:13] the The Temptations that you go through
[1:14:15] amen don't think that God doesn't know
[1:14:17] about you God knows all about you can
[1:14:20] you say Amen now amen Satan will lie to
[1:14:22] you and tell you that God doesn't
[1:14:24] understand and God has nothing to do
[1:14:25] with you but that's not what the Bible
[1:14:27] says here God remains silent all these
[1:14:31] years because he was waiting for his
[1:14:33] word to be fulfilled amen but he
[1:14:35] remembered his promise he remembered his
[1:14:37] word amen and he says I know their
[1:14:40] sorrow and I have heard I've seen the
[1:14:43] Affliction see I know their sorrow and I
[1:14:46] am come down to deliver them out of the
[1:14:49] hand of the Egyptians and to bring them
[1:14:52] up out of that land unto a good land a
[1:14:55] large unto a land flowing with milk and
[1:14:58] honey aren't you glad for that amen now
[1:15:00] see that's why God come that was the
[1:15:02] sole purpose is God remembered his
[1:15:04] promise God had heard the Cry of his
[1:15:07] people he saw the Affliction that the
[1:15:09] enemy was putting upon them amen he's
[1:15:11] knew their sorrow and he says now I'm
[1:15:13] come down to deliver them amen and you
[1:15:16] to think of this that God has come in
[1:15:18] this age Amen to deliver a people again
[1:15:22] I believe that now
[1:15:24] God has come to deliver
[1:15:27] amen and so Moses went down to Egypt
[1:15:30] where the Crooked stick in his hand amen
[1:15:32] see going to take over and brother Brown
[1:15:34] said he did it by the power of almighty
[1:15:37] God the most ridiculous thing what would
[1:15:39] its Crooked Stick be to ten thousand
[1:15:42] Spears but you see God is in it
[1:15:45] God is in it he takes what is so simple
[1:15:48] and so little to the world that God is
[1:15:51] in it
[1:15:52] amen see what looks funny to the world
[1:15:54] but God is in it oh my don't forget that
[1:15:57] now amen see God is in it and it depends
[1:16:01] on where his word is can you say man
[1:16:04] God's word wasn't in the ten thousand
[1:16:06] spheres God's word was with Moses ain't
[1:16:09] that right and Moses had his word
[1:16:12] Pharaoh had his Spears but Moses had the
[1:16:15] word of the Lord ain't that right amen
[1:16:18] and and the world has traded amen the
[1:16:21] word amen and and despise the word and
[1:16:24] went for the technology went for the
[1:16:26] glamor went for the popularity when for
[1:16:28] all of the things that thought that the
[1:16:30] devil is given to their children and to
[1:16:32] the uh to the churches today but there
[1:16:35] is a people that have taken the word of
[1:16:37] God and God is with his word
[1:16:41] now just before Jesus left
[1:16:44] he gave a promise
[1:16:47] and he said there in John 14 and 1 let
[1:16:50] not your heart be troubled you believe
[1:16:52] in God believe also in me in my father's
[1:16:55] house are many mansions if it were not
[1:16:57] soul I would have told you I go to
[1:16:59] prepare a place for you
[1:17:02] amen and if I go and prepare a place for
[1:17:05] you I everybody say I will come
[1:17:09] again
[1:17:11] so Ares promised already to come again
[1:17:14] amen now remember that's what he
[1:17:15] promised Abraham I had to end as so many
[1:17:18] years I'm going to come and I'm going to
[1:17:21] deliver your people amen and when a Time
[1:17:24] came time to come he had a prophet on
[1:17:27] the earth called Moses amen and he told
[1:17:30] Moses I've heard the I've seen the
[1:17:32] Affliction I've heard what they've done
[1:17:34] I've heard the Cry of my people I've
[1:17:36] seen their Cyrus I know all about it now
[1:17:38] I'm come to deliver them I've come to
[1:17:41] honor my word aren't you glad for that
[1:17:43] oh my see well here we are again Jesus
[1:17:47] the Same God Amen in flesh promise to
[1:17:51] come again unto us amen and receive you
[1:17:54] he says see I go prepare a place for you
[1:17:57] I will come again and receive you unto
[1:18:00] myself so this coming amen that he
[1:18:03] promised this time would be to receive
[1:18:06] us unto himself ain't that right that
[1:18:10] where I am you will be there also oh my
[1:18:14] amen see amen so then we understand uh
[1:18:18] this is what Revelations 10 1 is all
[1:18:21] about it's Redemption claims ain't that
[1:18:24] right what he redeemed 2 000 years ago
[1:18:27] he comes to claim them amen see this is
[1:18:32] what first Thessalonians 4 16 is all
[1:18:35] about none and and so forth the Lord
[1:18:37] himself shall descend with a shout which
[1:18:40] is the message of the hour ain't that
[1:18:43] right so so I want to tell you this if
[1:18:45] we can identify them scriptures amen
[1:18:48] with the coming for uh today amen and
[1:18:51] realize that the Melchizedek has come
[1:18:54] this isn't just a Ministry of a man it's
[1:18:57] the ministry of the Lord himself amen
[1:19:01] but he's come for one purpose and that
[1:19:03] is to receive us unto himself that where
[1:19:06] he is we can be there also can you say
[1:19:09] Amen yes sir so I say to you this is a
[1:19:12] message of Deliverance
[1:19:14] do you believe that it's a message of
[1:19:17] Deliverance if you can just believe that
[1:19:19] with all of your heart watch the
[1:19:21] supernatural take place in our lives
[1:19:23] amen see so so we find and it's what
[1:19:27] brother Branham calls the Third Exodus
[1:19:29] ain't that right it's a it's time for a
[1:19:32] Third Exodus it's what's happening uh uh
[1:19:36] here in this age so though I walk
[1:19:39] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:19:40] death I will fear no evil for thou art
[1:19:43] with me so he's come to receive me unto
[1:19:47] himself now now watch uh First
[1:19:50] Corinthians 15 50. now I say this uh
[1:19:54] Brethren that flesh and blood cannot
[1:19:56] inherit the kingdom of God neither doth
[1:19:59] corruption inherit incorruption but I
[1:20:02] show you a mystery we shall not all
[1:20:05] sleep but we shall all be changed
[1:20:10] want a time of Deliverance
[1:20:13] then you say Amen this isn't just coming
[1:20:15] out of a natural land but this is a time
[1:20:18] that he's going to receive us unto
[1:20:20] himself and in order to go where he's it
[1:20:23] we've got to be changed
[1:20:25] uh do you talk about a Deliverance now
[1:20:28] amen seat behold we shall not all sleep
[1:20:31] but we shall all be changed in a moment
[1:20:33] in the twinkling of an eye at the last
[1:20:36] Trump for the Trump shall sound and the
[1:20:40] dead shall be raised Incorruptible and
[1:20:42] we shall be changed you realize that the
[1:20:45] dead you're going to rise by the message
[1:20:47] of the hour
[1:20:52] true
[1:20:53] amen it ain't just got the power to
[1:20:56] Quicken your your your soul and bring
[1:20:59] you out of Dead traditions into life
[1:21:01] it's got the power Amen to Quicken those
[1:21:04] that are already dead and bring them
[1:21:06] back to life again and it's going to
[1:21:08] happen and I I just believe we're just
[1:21:10] near this thing can you say man that's
[1:21:13] right amen see so he says see we for the
[1:21:17] trumpet shall sound the dead shall be
[1:21:19] raised Incorruptible and we shall be
[1:21:21] changed for this corruptable must put on
[1:21:24] incorruption and this Mortal must put on
[1:21:26] immortality so when this corruptable
[1:21:29] shall have put on incorruption and this
[1:21:32] Mortal shall have put on immortality
[1:21:33] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[1:21:36] that is written death is swallowed up in
[1:21:39] Victory
[1:21:41] amen Victory can you say man he's come
[1:21:45] to take us out of this death a valley of
[1:21:48] shadow of death to where death can
[1:21:50] affect you sickness can affect you amen
[1:21:53] cannot torment your mind no more mind
[1:21:56] battles no more Temptation amen no more
[1:21:59] things to discourage you amen no more
[1:22:01] sickness to to paddle and all of these
[1:22:05] things and I say to you it's in this day
[1:22:07] that God has remembered his promise
[1:22:10] God has remembered his promise and and
[1:22:13] and and to be honest we didn't even know
[1:22:15] the the full effect of that promise we
[1:22:18] we didn't understand the timing of this
[1:22:20] promise we didn't understand really what
[1:22:22] God really meant but God would bring a
[1:22:25] prophet in this day to open it up to us
[1:22:28] and give us an understanding as to why
[1:22:31] he's here it's time for a body change
[1:22:34] it's time
[1:22:36] now David said the Lord is my shepherd
[1:22:39] you realize the prophet said it's a
[1:22:41] disgrace for the Sheep to lose one sh or
[1:22:44] the shepherd to lose one sheep it's a
[1:22:46] reproach on the shepherd if the shepherd
[1:22:49] loses one sheep it is a disgrace on him
[1:22:52] for all the father has given me will
[1:22:54] come and none of them are lost
[1:22:58] can I say that again all that the father
[1:23:00] hath given me now this is the great
[1:23:02] Shepherd all that the father has given
[1:23:04] me I've not lost to one they will come
[1:23:07] to me can you say Amen now though you
[1:23:10] walk to the Valley of the shadow of
[1:23:11] death or youngins are walking to the
[1:23:13] valley or the shadow over there there is
[1:23:15] a promise
[1:23:17] that's right Amen brother Brown said any
[1:23:20] good shepherd is a watcher of the sheep
[1:23:22] the shepherd can't afford to lose the
[1:23:24] Sheep that's the reason you backslider
[1:23:27] tonight he's still he's still honking
[1:23:29] hanging or still hanging around your
[1:23:31] heart trying to draw you back to the
[1:23:33] fifth fold because he once kissed you
[1:23:35] and you kissed him and told him that you
[1:23:38] loved him raised your hands and praised
[1:23:40] him and you backslid and went out there
[1:23:42] and got all butchered up and wounded up
[1:23:44] in your spirit but he still holds around
[1:23:47] you see all the time come on back
[1:23:50] wandering sheep see I just can't afford
[1:23:53] to let you be lost maybe the little
[1:23:55] sheep that he had to go way out on the
[1:23:58] mountain to find see all through the
[1:24:01] place maybe you're that sheep tonight
[1:24:03] laying out there wounded somewhere but
[1:24:05] the shepherd can't afford to lose one
[1:24:08] sheep
[1:24:09] amen think of what Jesus says uh about
[1:24:12] the shepherd and the and the Sheep he
[1:24:14] says see Luke 15 4 what man of you
[1:24:17] having a hundred sheep if you lose one
[1:24:19] of them does not leave the 99 in the
[1:24:22] wilderness and go after that which is
[1:24:24] lost until he be found ain't that right
[1:24:27] and when he found it he layeth it upon
[1:24:30] his shoulders rejoicing and when he
[1:24:33] cometh home all he calleth together is
[1:24:35] friends and neighbors singing to them
[1:24:37] Rejoice with me for I have found my
[1:24:39] sheep which was lost I say to you that
[1:24:42] likewise Joy shall be in heaven over one
[1:24:45] sinner that repenteth more than over 99
[1:24:49] just persons which need no repentance
[1:24:52] can you say Amen so I'd say to you that
[1:24:54] not one of God's sheep is going to be
[1:24:56] lost not a one ain't that right now
[1:24:59] churches come down
[1:25:02] he's come here to claim his own and I
[1:25:05] don't care how bad that the battle rages
[1:25:07] I don't care how dark it gets I don't
[1:25:09] care how it looks like the devil is
[1:25:11] having a Heyday a man not one of the
[1:25:15] sheep is going to be lost he come here
[1:25:18] in power he come here Amen to get
[1:25:21] everyone that he put on the Lamb's Book
[1:25:23] of Life
[1:25:24] ain't that right
[1:25:26] not One's Gonna Be lost
[1:25:28] Brother Brad I'm at the end of his
[1:25:30] sermon on one one of his sermons asked
[1:25:32] people to raise their hand if they
[1:25:33] wanted to accept Christ and and
[1:25:36] different ones did and he says he said
[1:25:38] you know what calls you to raise your
[1:25:39] hands it was Jesus for God said in his
[1:25:42] word listen no man cometh to me except
[1:25:44] my father draws him first and God is
[1:25:47] here and he's drawing by the Holy Spirit
[1:25:50] some 20 or 30 put their hands up he's
[1:25:53] drawing by the holy spirit because that
[1:25:56] you love him there's something in that
[1:25:58] see you you that you just can't help it
[1:26:01] there's something in you you just can't
[1:26:03] help it ain't that right I don't care
[1:26:06] how discouraged we get I don't care how
[1:26:08] low we get I don't care what goes on
[1:26:10] what happens in our day and how many
[1:26:12] Trials come there's still something in
[1:26:15] there that's Paul Satan God I gotta have
[1:26:17] you God I need you what is it God the
[1:26:20] shepherd ain't gonna lose his sheep
[1:26:24] ain't that right
[1:26:26] when Moses went and delivered them
[1:26:28] people
[1:26:29] not one was lost
[1:26:34] that's what the prophet said
[1:26:37] not one was lost
[1:26:39] now we know Jesus is our great Shepherd
[1:26:42] ain't that right
[1:26:44] so he he told us he's the Good Shepherd
[1:26:47] brother Brown said God selected the
[1:26:49] great Shepherd of the flock the Lord
[1:26:51] Jesus Christ and gave him the authority
[1:26:53] the Shepherds got the authority over his
[1:26:56] sheep
[1:26:57] amen and our Authority brother Brown
[1:27:00] said is Jesus Christ
[1:27:03] you believe it our Authority is Jesus
[1:27:06] Christ
[1:27:07] amen so now we see that our great
[1:27:10] Shepherd has a rotten staff or he says
[1:27:12] thy rod and thy staff they comfort me a
[1:27:15] man see now sheep are defenseless and
[1:27:18] need a Shepherd to protect them
[1:27:20] so from from what I understand the
[1:27:22] shepherd's Rod is used in different ways
[1:27:24] but for different things but but one of
[1:27:27] them things is that it's used to defend
[1:27:29] and protect the Sheep
[1:27:31] from from the enemy and the rod conveys
[1:27:35] the concept of Power Authority
[1:27:39] discipline ain't that right so we see uh
[1:27:43] the importance of the rod and staff as
[1:27:45] we talked about it Wednesday I believe
[1:27:47] but the importance of the rotten staff
[1:27:50] when Moses went to deliver Israel out of
[1:27:53] Egypt and to bring them into another
[1:27:55] land that was the first Exodus amen and
[1:27:59] and and Moses was called of God he was
[1:28:03] sent by God and God gave him a
[1:28:06] supernatural uh signs as Vindication to
[1:28:10] his message now the prophet said Moses
[1:28:13] was a perfect type of our great Shepherd
[1:28:15] the Lord Jesus and Jehovah displays
[1:28:20] himself uh uh in this Shepherd Prophet
[1:28:24] Moses now Moses LED every genuine lamb
[1:28:28] all the way from Egypt to Palestine he
[1:28:31] never lost a one of them neither did
[1:28:34] they go hungry or their clothes didn't
[1:28:36] even get threadbare Moses the shepherd
[1:28:39] LED them ain't that right certainly he
[1:28:43] was a type of Christ see so those who
[1:28:47] will follow will never be lost
[1:28:52] those who follow will never be lost
[1:28:56] ain't that right sometimes we don't
[1:28:58] understand the leading but we know that
[1:29:01] that the shepherd is here to bring a
[1:29:03] Deliverance
[1:29:05] so we can find courage in the story of
[1:29:08] Moses because we see that God
[1:29:12] two is going to bring every one of his
[1:29:15] sheep out as well
[1:29:17] not his word his word is not going to go
[1:29:19] idle his word is not going to fail
[1:29:22] what what God intended what every person
[1:29:25] that God intended to come out of Egypt
[1:29:28] was there on Earth at that time that
[1:29:30] Moses was there
[1:29:32] God wasn't wasting his time he didn't
[1:29:34] bring them all out of Egypt and then say
[1:29:36] Oh My amen uh uh this one was left
[1:29:39] behind because it was in the hospital or
[1:29:41] or whatever you know the Bible says that
[1:29:43] they all left well
[1:29:46] they they left there was not a sickness
[1:29:48] there
[1:29:49] so that Rod now he brought them out the
[1:29:53] prophet said by that Rod now that Rod
[1:29:56] was just a Crooked Stick yeah uh there
[1:29:59] but the prophet said the power laid in
[1:30:02] that stick
[1:30:05] look Exodus 4 and 2 and the Lord said
[1:30:07] unto him what is in thine hand and he
[1:30:10] said a rod and he said cast it on the
[1:30:12] ground and he casted on the ground and
[1:30:14] it become a serpent and Moses fled from
[1:30:17] before it and the Lord said unto Moses
[1:30:19] put forth thine hand and take it by the
[1:30:22] tail and he put forth his hand and
[1:30:24] caught it and it become a rod again see
[1:30:28] now Moses wasn't out to perform tricks
[1:30:31] he wasn't out to say look what I can do
[1:30:33] it was there to bring Deliverance
[1:30:38] ain't that right
[1:30:40] see there was a message behind what he
[1:30:43] was doing
[1:30:45] in the natural that stick that Rod was
[1:30:48] just an ordinary stick
[1:30:51] but the prophet said when the
[1:30:52] supernatural Came Upon it it was God's
[1:30:55] judgment rod
[1:30:57] 's judgment Rod now it become a serpent
[1:31:00] it turned into a serpent as we just read
[1:31:03] and the serpent represented what sin
[1:31:06] already judged
[1:31:09] ain't that right remember when Israel
[1:31:12] sinned against Moses by complaining sin
[1:31:16] against God sin against Moses they
[1:31:18] complained they griped they said it'd be
[1:31:21] better off of we we we just go back to
[1:31:23] Egypt and eat the onion and leeks and
[1:31:25] whatever see uh the garlic and all that
[1:31:29] stuff and and God was Wrath with them
[1:31:32] and numbers 21 and 6 and the Lord sent
[1:31:35] fiery serpents among the people and they
[1:31:37] bit the people and much people of Israel
[1:31:40] died
[1:31:41] therefore the people came to Moses and
[1:31:44] said we have sinned for we have spoken
[1:31:46] against the Lord and against thee pray
[1:31:49] unto the Lord that he take away the
[1:31:51] serpents from us and Moses prayed for
[1:31:54] the people and the Lord said unto Moses
[1:31:56] make the a fiery Serpent and set it upon
[1:31:59] a pole and it shall come to pass that
[1:32:02] everyone that is bitten when he looked
[1:32:04] at the point shall live
[1:32:06] and Moses made a serpent of brass and
[1:32:09] put it upon a pole and it came to pass
[1:32:11] that if a serpent had bitten any man
[1:32:13] when he beheld The Serpent of brass he
[1:32:15] lived ain't that right now the prophet
[1:32:18] said both in both cases when Moses threw
[1:32:20] the stick down and become a serpent and
[1:32:22] the pole that the serpent was on Amen it
[1:32:25] represented the cross
[1:32:29] see it was just a natural substance it
[1:32:31] was just a stick of wood ain't that
[1:32:33] right but the serpent represented Christ
[1:32:39] so brother Bram says now he said the
[1:32:42] serpent as it was uh a reptile a snake
[1:32:45] it represents it represented sin already
[1:32:49] judged for Satan had sinned in the
[1:32:52] serpent in the Garden of Eden yeah
[1:32:56] come on see which was not a reptile he
[1:32:58] was the missing link between man and
[1:33:01] animal
[1:33:02] and he stood there or walked upright and
[1:33:05] was the most subtle of all the beasts
[1:33:07] not reptiles of the beast of the field
[1:33:10] and when he was cursed his legs went off
[1:33:13] of him and he went on his belly right
[1:33:16] then and that showed that he was already
[1:33:19] judged when he became a reptile
[1:33:23] ain't that right and then Christ was sin
[1:33:27] in the serpent already judged
[1:33:30] ain't that right so God was joined by
[1:33:33] that serpent that sin was already judged
[1:33:36] and it was showing that that was Christ
[1:33:39] Christ the serpent was a type of Christ
[1:33:42] are you with me now see then Christ was
[1:33:46] sinned in the serpent already judged the
[1:33:49] lamb slain from the foundation of the
[1:33:52] world
[1:33:53] so another place he said the serpent
[1:33:55] spake of divine judgment to appease God
[1:33:58] his judgments are Divine and the poll
[1:34:00] represented the cross and the serpent
[1:34:03] represented Jesus the lovely Lord Jesus
[1:34:05] he came down and was made sin
[1:34:08] God himself revealed himself in a body
[1:34:11] made like unto sinful flesh to take away
[1:34:14] sin and sickness from the world how
[1:34:17] beautiful in there he made a way Jesus
[1:34:20] said as Moses lifted up the breast
[1:34:22] serpent in the wilderness so must the
[1:34:24] son of man be lifted up now what was the
[1:34:27] breast serpent lifted up for for a
[1:34:29] compound compound reason they had sinned
[1:34:32] and were sick and then Jesus was lifted
[1:34:35] up wounded for our transgressions and
[1:34:38] went to stripes we are healed a compound
[1:34:41] reason ain't that right another place
[1:34:44] brother Brown said the serpent was an
[1:34:46] atonement for the people
[1:34:49] we're getting somewhere now see so the
[1:34:52] Judgment was not laid upon the people it
[1:34:55] was laid upon the serpent
[1:34:57] showing that the Judgment was not laid
[1:35:00] upon the seed of God it was laid upon
[1:35:04] Christ
[1:35:06] and you say Amen
[1:35:08] see so brother Brown said the serpent
[1:35:10] represented sin already judged God
[1:35:12] judged the serpent in the Garden of Eden
[1:35:15] God already passed judgment upon the
[1:35:18] serpent oh he was beautiful walked up
[1:35:20] right he was the most subtle of all the
[1:35:23] beasts of the field but God judged him
[1:35:25] and put him down on his belly for the
[1:35:27] rest of his days see judged and Christ
[1:35:30] was our sins judged he said you see it
[1:35:34] beautiful my sin your sin justly should
[1:35:37] go to hell and be punished for our sins
[1:35:39] but Christ took our place and the
[1:35:43] serpent that's why it represented Christ
[1:35:48] see brass the serpent being made out of
[1:35:50] brass meant Divine judgment now the
[1:35:52] serpent was already was sin already
[1:35:54] judged the breast meant Divine judgment
[1:35:56] so see God's Divine judgment was upon
[1:35:59] Christ not you
[1:36:01] ain't that right see he took your
[1:36:03] judgment God put all your sins and my
[1:36:06] sins and all of our field upon Christ
[1:36:08] that you could go free
[1:36:13] you realize that's the only way the
[1:36:15] message of Deliverance could happen
[1:36:17] if there was nobody to take our sins we
[1:36:21] would never be able to hear a message of
[1:36:22] Deliverance
[1:36:24] we would never be able to hear a message
[1:36:26] of Freedom we would never be able to be
[1:36:28] comforted in this Valley of the shadow
[1:36:31] of death
[1:36:35] that's right
[1:36:37] brother Brown said now see while you're
[1:36:39] in that body talking about the body of
[1:36:40] Christ you're just as free from
[1:36:43] condemnation as he is you'll never have
[1:36:46] to stand any judgment aren't you glad
[1:36:47] for that you'll never have to stand any
[1:36:50] judgment now that means something does
[1:36:52] Church
[1:36:54] because look around you look what's
[1:36:55] happening in this world
[1:36:57] but you'll never have to stand the
[1:36:59] judgment
[1:37:00] see God calls judgment to be struck upon
[1:37:03] his body and if you're in him God cannot
[1:37:05] everybody say God cannot judge me
[1:37:09] God cannot judge you brother Bill if
[1:37:11] you're in that body amen by one Spirit
[1:37:14] are we baptized in that one body you're
[1:37:16] safe you're secure you can never be
[1:37:19] judged again
[1:37:21] because Christ took your judgment
[1:37:23] now what you're hearing is a message of
[1:37:26] Deliverance come out of her my people
[1:37:31] ain't that right
[1:37:33] he's come for Redemption claims
[1:37:36] because he's already took your judgment
[1:37:38] so you can't just go around you remember
[1:37:40] if you go listen to that uh sister Bruce
[1:37:43] that the the interview of sister Bruce
[1:37:45] you know and she's trying to tell
[1:37:46] brother Brown however rotten of a sinner
[1:37:48] she is and how this and she's no good
[1:37:49] and all this and the proc she's trying
[1:37:52] to convince the prophet that she's a
[1:37:54] sinner she's no good and the prophet
[1:37:56] looks at her says but I've checked your
[1:37:57] life you're not a sinner
[1:38:02] you realize that's what God has done in
[1:38:04] this message he told us that you're
[1:38:06] absolutely Justified as though you never
[1:38:09] did it in the first place you're no
[1:38:12] longer a sinner
[1:38:17] see you can't be see so he says God
[1:38:20] cannot judge you he's already judged you
[1:38:22] when he judged Christ
[1:38:23] he put the judgment on Christ not you
[1:38:26] aren't you glad for that
[1:38:28] yes sir and you can't be under judgment
[1:38:31] no more Christ took your judgment and
[1:38:33] when you're baptized in that body of
[1:38:35] Christ you're free from God's judgment
[1:38:37] the wrath of God will pass over you
[1:38:40] church we ought to be happy tonight we
[1:38:43] ought to be rejoicing tonight to know
[1:38:45] that the wrath of God Is Passing Over
[1:38:48] Our Lives
[1:38:50] it's passing over it you can't be judged
[1:38:58] there's that song was saying you know
[1:39:00] Jesus Took My burdens and rode them in
[1:39:02] the deep blue sea
[1:39:04] now I have a piece
[1:39:07] that he has given me all because he's
[1:39:09] took my burdens and rode them in the sea
[1:39:12] can you say Amen
[1:39:14] oh yes yes he so the rod was Christ
[1:39:18] you believe it
[1:39:20] so what the prophet said the rod was
[1:39:22] Christ the substitute for sin and
[1:39:25] sickness
[1:39:26] amen so now when when Moses went and he
[1:39:30] threw that Rod before Pharaoh turned
[1:39:32] into a serpent
[1:39:34] it was a sign of Christ coming
[1:39:37] and taking the Judgment for the people
[1:39:42] ain't that right
[1:39:44] see being our judgment and yet
[1:39:48] Pharaoh rejected it
[1:39:52] not it gave the people comfort
[1:39:55] if they could see what that Rod meant
[1:39:59] they know what it meant see
[1:40:02] that there it was a testimony of
[1:40:04] Christ's coming
[1:40:06] Pharaoh rejected it and he tried to do
[1:40:09] the same thing he called his magicians
[1:40:11] magicians and and and and and and and
[1:40:14] they done the same thing that Moses done
[1:40:16] they threw down their rods they turned
[1:40:17] into a serpent ain't that right
[1:40:19] brother Brown said so does the modern
[1:40:21] pharaohs of today and make Believers
[1:40:22] carnal impersonations impersonators of
[1:40:25] the message try to mimic the same thing
[1:40:27] without knowing where it's coming from
[1:40:29] and they throw it into some
[1:40:31] denominational something when it says
[1:40:33] free uh from it as the air is from being
[1:40:36] pinned up but you try to mimic see
[1:40:39] brother Branham in his prayer he said I
[1:40:41] see all things that you promised I see
[1:40:43] the impersonators I see uh you said that
[1:40:46] as it was in the days of Moses how this
[1:40:49] uh jambers and Janus would come back to
[1:40:52] impersonate and still remain right in
[1:40:55] that same dump that they were in see
[1:40:58] they couldn't follow Moses through that
[1:41:00] word and take those children out there
[1:41:02] Into the Wilderness amen because they
[1:41:05] was associated in Egypt
[1:41:09] that's right they couldn't do it though
[1:41:11] they'd done the same Works he did
[1:41:15] isn't that the way it is today
[1:41:17] we got him dancing speaking in tongues
[1:41:20] shouting using the gifts and all that
[1:41:22] but they ain't got what it takes to
[1:41:24] deliver the people
[1:41:26] because they're associated with the
[1:41:28] world
[1:41:31] ain't that right see they're associated
[1:41:33] with the world so they ain't got what it
[1:41:35] takes Amen to to bring him in uh take
[1:41:38] them out see amen but they're Folly see
[1:41:42] their Folly was made manifest brother
[1:41:44] Brown said now watch this spirit in the
[1:41:46] last days go to impersonate the real
[1:41:48] Spirit that's where your trouble is
[1:41:50] coming just like it like the the the one
[1:41:54] that's real but he couldn't make it
[1:41:56] manifest he couldn't make it hold he
[1:41:59] couldn't make it last
[1:42:00] pharaoh and his uh uh magicians done
[1:42:04] exactly what Moses done but they
[1:42:07] couldn't make it last
[1:42:08] it didn't last long
[1:42:11] it it didn't it was as though it was
[1:42:14] just a a vapor
[1:42:16] Mystic
[1:42:18] can you say man that's right see do you
[1:42:21] realize that brother Brad said he
[1:42:23] historically a Revival will last about
[1:42:26] three years or so and then it dies it
[1:42:30] goes off the scene he said but this
[1:42:32] revival has went on for 15 years or more
[1:42:34] not one denomination has come out of it
[1:42:37] Luther had Revival went into
[1:42:39] denomination Wesley when denomination
[1:42:41] Alexander Campbell went into a
[1:42:43] denomination all these other great John
[1:42:45] Smith and so forth denominations Moody
[1:42:47] all along but here's been one usually
[1:42:49] Revival lasts about three years but this
[1:42:51] has been going on for over 15 years and
[1:42:54] I say it's still going on and not one
[1:42:57] denomination has sprang up see has
[1:43:00] sprung up from it for this is the sea
[1:43:03] time
[1:43:03] [Applause]
[1:43:06] isn't that wonderful there's no more
[1:43:08] shot after that one the one Chuck is
[1:43:11] gone it's seed and God is ready if he
[1:43:13] isn't doing it now he's going to call a
[1:43:16] church to Perfection by his word Jesus
[1:43:20] Christ
[1:43:21] ain't that right so this revival is
[1:43:24] still going on why it's the promise of
[1:43:27] of God that he would come and take us
[1:43:31] home
[1:43:33] amen now
[1:43:35] it's true
[1:43:37] they ain't a man-made thing
[1:43:41] Moses Revival wasn't a man-made thing
[1:43:44] he had what it took to get the people
[1:43:46] out
[1:43:47] and this message is what it takes to get
[1:43:49] the people out we're leaving
[1:43:52] and the shepherd staff noticed Moses
[1:43:55] Shepherd's staff he was the shepherd
[1:43:57] Prophet his staff ate up the other
[1:43:59] snakes
[1:44:00] amen and there was the rods on the floor
[1:44:03] but only one was picked up
[1:44:06] ain't that right that's right brother
[1:44:08] Brown said it speaks of true atonement
[1:44:11] coming for sin there's only one way for
[1:44:14] an atonement for sin ain't that right
[1:44:16] and that's Jesus Christ
[1:44:18] there ain't all these other ways there
[1:44:19] ain't all these other things to get you
[1:44:21] in a Rapture there's only one way
[1:44:22] there's only one voice there's only one
[1:44:25] message there's only one power
[1:44:29] ain't that right
[1:44:31] now as we read and I'll get rid closed
[1:44:35] but Isaiah 11 and 1 and there shall come
[1:44:38] forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse
[1:44:41] and a branch shall grow out of his roots
[1:44:43] and the spirit of the Lord shall rest
[1:44:45] upon him the spirit of wisdom and
[1:44:46] understanding the spirit of counsel and
[1:44:48] might the spirit of knowledge and of the
[1:44:50] fear of the Lord
[1:44:52] and she'll make him of quick
[1:44:53] understanding in the fear of the Lord
[1:44:55] and he shall not judge after the sight
[1:44:57] of his eyes neither reprove after the
[1:44:59] hearing of his ears but with
[1:45:01] righteousness shall he judge the poor
[1:45:04] and reprove with equity for the meek of
[1:45:06] the earth and he shall Smite the Earth
[1:45:08] with the rod of his mouth and with the
[1:45:10] breath of his lips shall he slay the
[1:45:12] wicked now I'll say to you that Rod is
[1:45:15] Jesus Christ
[1:45:16] can you say man now the prophet said
[1:45:19] Israel was offered deliverance from the
[1:45:21] bondage of death by the prophet Shepherd
[1:45:23] they were brought out of bondage by a
[1:45:26] prophet Shepherd
[1:45:28] see what was it he said it was speaking
[1:45:30] of the Israel's future deliverer from
[1:45:33] death and Hell by the great Shepherd
[1:45:35] prophet
[1:45:37] ain't that right amen but we all know
[1:45:40] that Israel rejected it
[1:45:42] they rejected their deliverer they
[1:45:44] rejected it and want nothing to do with
[1:45:46] it but God has sent that same Shepherd
[1:45:49] prophet in our day to bring Deliverance
[1:45:51] to us
[1:45:52] his people his bride
[1:45:55] and there's going to be people to
[1:45:56] receive it
[1:45:58] aren't you glad you're one of them
[1:46:00] that's right see and notice when Moses
[1:46:03] the the shepherd prophet in Egypt there
[1:46:06] Pharaoh rejected the the the the the the
[1:46:09] the sign the the the serpent and and he
[1:46:14] uh therefore it become a rod of judgment
[1:46:18] to him
[1:46:19] and to Egypt
[1:46:21] Moses waved that Rod amen over the
[1:46:25] waters it turned into blood
[1:46:26] he waved toward the sky and the sun went
[1:46:30] black
[1:46:31] ain't that right turn dark everywhere
[1:46:34] that Prophet Shepherd put that Rod
[1:46:36] before him it was judgment
[1:46:39] judgment went before the rod because it
[1:46:42] was a judgment Rod the prophet said and
[1:46:44] it brought judgment Upon A disobedient
[1:46:47] people
[1:46:49] but yet that Rod was bringing a
[1:46:52] Deliverance to the people
[1:46:54] all depends what side of the the corn
[1:46:56] you're on
[1:46:57] ain't that right when Moses wanted fleas
[1:47:00] the prophet said he just raised that Rod
[1:47:02] into the air and sprinkled some dirt
[1:47:04] amen and as the dust blew on the fleece
[1:47:08] came from everywhere what was it it was
[1:47:10] divine judgment
[1:47:12] he brought fire out of Heaven lightning
[1:47:15] upon the Earth he brought hell stones
[1:47:17] and everything that killed the cattle
[1:47:19] and killed the Egyptians and everything
[1:47:20] else it was God's judgment that went
[1:47:23] before Moses and what that stick was to
[1:47:26] Moses Jesus Christ is to the church in
[1:47:30] this age
[1:47:32] in this hour
[1:47:35] as I've read last week if if those
[1:47:37] Egyptians could have ever got that
[1:47:39] simple stick out of Moses hands they'd
[1:47:41] have whooped him
[1:47:42] and when the devil ever gets the deity
[1:47:44] out of the name of Jesus Christ he's
[1:47:46] with the church
[1:47:48] can you say Amen
[1:47:49] and as the Judgment went stick went
[1:47:52] before Moses to take the judgment to
[1:47:54] bring the Judgment so does the name of
[1:47:56] Jesus go before us to take our judgment
[1:47:59] and stands our Judgment of sickness it
[1:48:02] stands our Judgment of death stands our
[1:48:04] Judgment of trouble can you say Amen it
[1:48:07] stands at everything that we deserve
[1:48:09] that Satan tries to put on us there's a
[1:48:12] rod that takes our judgment
[1:48:16] why it's time for deliverance
[1:48:18] amen take the rod
[1:48:21] he's taken our judgment
[1:48:23] and there's power in the rod
[1:48:26] can you say Amen
[1:48:28] you're not a victim
[1:48:30] I think we ought to get out of that
[1:48:32] victim mentality
[1:48:35] speaking negative mentality
[1:48:38] woe is me mentality
[1:48:41] can you say Amen
[1:48:43] we are the people
[1:48:45] how many believes you're the people
[1:48:47] you're the people he's come for
[1:48:49] amen he's come for it
[1:48:52] he's come he sent a message and there's
[1:48:54] a rod
[1:48:55] Jesus Christ is here
[1:48:58] and our Authority is in that name
[1:49:00] every problem that you have is there in
[1:49:04] that name it's your judgment it's taken
[1:49:06] the Judgment for you now you take that
[1:49:08] name of Jesus and you defeat every enemy
[1:49:12] Satan cannot stick to you he has no
[1:49:14] right sickness has no right to stick to
[1:49:16] you problems have no right to stick to
[1:49:19] you oh yes you're going through this
[1:49:20] Valley of the shadow of death but you
[1:49:22] will not be overcome you will not be
[1:49:24] subdued by that devil
[1:49:29] you believe it
[1:49:31] amen don't let this message become
[1:49:33] common
[1:49:35] said when when sickness begins together
[1:49:37] breathe that name of Jesus
[1:49:40] what is it it's God's representative of
[1:49:42] judgment
[1:49:43] Christ already judged for your sins
[1:49:47] Christ already judged for your
[1:49:49] Temptation Christ already judged for
[1:49:52] your sickness see what I mean it was
[1:49:53] God's judgment rod and as long as that
[1:49:56] Rod waved on it was God's judgment ain't
[1:50:00] that right amen Moses that night after
[1:50:03] leading the children of Israel out there
[1:50:04] come Pharaoh's Army the pillar of fire
[1:50:07] went down and hung between pharaoh and
[1:50:09] pursuing Army into Israel it may lie to
[1:50:13] Israel and darkness to pharaoh and kept
[1:50:16] them apart a go between and I'm so glad
[1:50:18] today that he is our goal between in
[1:50:21] sickness in between death and life he's
[1:50:24] my go-between he's the one that takes
[1:50:26] death in one hand and life in the other
[1:50:28] hand he's that link that connects man to
[1:50:31] God to go between ain't that right he
[1:50:34] come down as a go-between he made light
[1:50:37] on this side for Israel to march on and
[1:50:40] darkness to hold Pharaoh back isn't that
[1:50:43] what is happening to day there's light
[1:50:45] with the children of God and there's
[1:50:47] Darkness with the world
[1:50:48] he made light see to hold him back they
[1:50:52] said that same angel of God is in the
[1:50:54] church tonight giving light for the
[1:50:55] church to walk on and darkness for those
[1:50:57] who were rejected we are the children of
[1:51:00] Light how many believes that amen see
[1:51:03] how can you see when you walk in
[1:51:05] darkness you can't see you don't know
[1:51:07] where you're going but if you're in the
[1:51:09] light and Christ is the light he's given
[1:51:11] light to those Believers and while he
[1:51:14] was giving Darkness to the unbeliever
[1:51:16] see so he's given light to you and I and
[1:51:19] he's given Darkness to those that that
[1:51:21] disbelieve and that's why they can't see
[1:51:23] the message that's why they can't
[1:51:25] understand amen and what little fire or
[1:51:27] what little Revival amen they have and
[1:51:30] they say oh see we're doing just great
[1:51:31] it goes out it it cannot last but that
[1:51:34] believer is going to allow she's the
[1:51:36] she's predestinated for a Deliverance
[1:51:40] she's predestinated if the musicians
[1:51:43] will come today before see so he said
[1:51:47] see we're marching toward the promised
[1:51:48] land God's throwing light on the path of
[1:51:50] Divine Healing speaking with tongues
[1:51:52] shoutings and glories of God see
[1:51:56] manifesting them to the children of the
[1:51:58] light and throwing Darkness back there
[1:52:00] that they stumble not knowing where
[1:52:02] they're going
[1:52:03] remember that same stick that hand that
[1:52:05] held the Judgment Rod when he came down
[1:52:07] and there was God's path see running
[1:52:10] through the Red Sea he waved that over
[1:52:12] the Red Sea and the Red Sea seeing the
[1:52:14] Judgment got scared and moved back on
[1:52:17] either side and made a pillar see and
[1:52:20] the Marchers of Israel walked right
[1:52:22] across on dry land in the bottom of the
[1:52:24] sea and when the uncircumcised trying to
[1:52:27] pretend they were something when they
[1:52:30] were nothing started to do so God
[1:52:31] discomforted them took the wheels off
[1:52:34] and scared the horses and down there in
[1:52:36] the bottom of the sea in a great big uh
[1:52:39] bit of conglomeration and on the other
[1:52:41] side that same judgment where sin was in
[1:52:44] the valley praise God you know what
[1:52:46] that'll do see that same pillar fire
[1:52:49] that had been showing them when it come
[1:52:51] down to this Valley it moved right over
[1:52:54] the top of that water and made a way
[1:52:56] where these back there without the
[1:52:58] leading of the Holy Spirit could not
[1:53:00] walk where those circumcised were
[1:53:01] walking can you say man see this is a
[1:53:04] this is a time that that only the
[1:53:08] circumcised to only those that have got
[1:53:11] the token that life of God can walk
