[41:06] uh uh Tim Humes had left and things and
[41:10] of course uh Church in Santa Fe and the
[41:14] church there in um in North Carolina uh
[41:20] they they were really intermingled the

[41:29] when all this went down and and they
[41:31] hadn't had a meeting um like that since
[41:35] uh
[41:37] 2019 and uh so you know and and uh just

[41:50] and um uh you know the might
[41:54] of um of course you you go through a a a
[41:58] slump a drought or whatever you want to

[42:50] the Lord is certainly good to us isn't
[42:52] he amen amen he's so faithful to his
[42:55] word and and uh before we go into the
[42:58] word may we just bow our hearts and talk

[43:36] whatever it would be lord they're going
[43:39] to
[43:40] stand oh we're so thankful for that
[43:43] father now we just pray that you would
[43:45] bless the reading of your word the
[43:48] ministering Lord and may we just uh be
[43:53] all lifted up in Heavenly places father
[43:56] if there's anything Lord that would be
[43:58] displeasing to you in our lives we would
[44:01] ask that you'd forgive us of them oh
[44:04] Father draw us closer to you we ask it
[44:07] in Jesus Christ's name and the church
[44:09] says amen amen amen uh just a simple um
[44:16] scripture we but powerful Matthew
[44:19] 24 and
[44:23] 35 but it says Heaven and Earth shall
[44:26] pass away
[44:27] but my words shall not pass away can you
[44:32] say that with me Heaven and Earth shall
[44:34] pass away but my word shall not pass
[44:38] away you can have your seats
[44:42] this evening and um you know I I just
[44:48] thinking of this of course the trip and
[44:51] and um you know when you looking and
[44:55] and that we we there was a diverse group
[44:58] of people there and um some had come out
[45:02] of uh
[45:04] really um sad situations whether it be
[45:08] um dictatorship in the church and where
[45:12] person can't even buy a car without
[45:14] asking the pastor you know for his
[45:16] approval or whether it be you
[45:20] know one believing in deity and and this
[45:24] you know of course when you have a
[45:25] meeting you got all kind kind of of uh
[45:29] people coming and uh and yet uh you know
[45:34] the people are are coming out of these
[45:37] situations and they're hungering for
[45:40] truth they they want to know they want
[45:42] to know more about God Amen and it it
[45:47] then you know thinking of brother shmaya
[45:50] and sister Bethany I uh when he uh told
[45:54] me he uh kept me in updated about the
[45:58] situation and and um you know let me
[46:02] know you know uh that the baby that was
[46:06] here and and things I I you know I I
[46:11] couldn't help but just shed a tear or
[46:14] two just a thinking of what God had
[46:17] truly done am what a
[46:20] miracle and uh you know as we know and
[46:25] um those those of you that have been
[46:28] here uh you know a lot longer than I
[46:31] have um but knowing the the testimony
[46:35] knowing the confession that they had
[46:39] that God was going to give them a
[46:42] child and just looking totally
[46:46] impossible and uh and yet staying strong
[46:50] and I'm not saying they didn't have
[46:52] discouragements and all of that but uh
[46:55] uh they they kept look to God look to
[46:58] that word and today you know what we
[47:01] witness is a miracle that God keeps his
[47:05] word amen and that is something that we
[47:08] can rest uh assured on on
[47:13] anything uh more than anything else is
[47:15] that God is faithful to his
[47:18] word uh but you know it's it's the word
[47:21] it's it's the the word that is
[47:23] infallible it's the word of God it's the
[47:26] only thing that we can cling to and and
[47:30] no wonder the devil tries to get us get
[47:33] the people of God so
[47:36] distracted and looking to other
[47:39] things uh because the word of God is the
[47:42] only lasting thing that will that that
[47:46] will help and and so uh you know a
[47:49] thinking of what brother brandham had
[47:52] said um uh uh in one place he tells well
[47:56] in several places God is obligated to
[48:00] his word can you say that with me God is
[48:04] obligated to his word I I think that's
[48:07] powerful if you ever just thought of why
[48:09] we're standing here why you're still
[48:11] serving the lord it's because God is
[48:14] obligated to his word you realize the
[48:17] times that you know uh uh people go
[48:20] through things that you go through and
[48:22] and and yet they end their lives uh
[48:26] maybe
[48:27] uh uh or they just go into just utter
[48:30] Despair and and and all of these things
[48:33] but why why don't we go into despair why
[48:36] why why are we still pressing on you
[48:39] know it is a flat miracle that we're
[48:42] still serving the lord it it is a it's
[48:45] an absolute miracle that you got young
[48:47] people serving the lord uh today and
[48:50] really got a desire to serve God Amen
[48:53] it's a miracle but but what makes that
[48:55] Miracle the same God that made a miracle
[48:58] for brother shemaya and sister Bethany
[49:00] is the same God that made a miracle for
[49:03] us it's a miracle that we're still
[49:05] believing this message look look at all
[49:07] the the the the negative that we've
[49:09] heard about the message I don't know
[49:11] about you but I've heard a lot of
[49:12] negative about the message and and you
[49:15] know and yet yet I hear the same stories
[49:17] that other people hear I see the the
[49:20] same things that other people see but
[49:22] that doesn't move me at all and yet
[49:25] other people get discouraged they get
[49:27] and finally they walk away and say
[49:29] there's nothing to it and and and these
[49:31] things but but why why why is because
[49:35] God is obligated to his word and and so
[49:39] we we look at that um uh then what is in
[49:43] his word well his word uh uh they
[49:46] promises every scripture every page of
[49:50] this Bible are promises do you believe
[49:52] that it's it's promises that that we can
[49:57] we can cling our soul to uh uh with with
[50:01] all of our heart but this word has been
[50:04] a mystery because you think well you
[50:07] know I I just thinking of God being
[50:09] faithful well you know we know he's
[50:11] faithful to his word but what does that
[50:13] word mean to us what what is the word of
[50:16] God to us you know is it just a book of
[50:19] history is a book of poem love is it you
[50:22] know there's there's people that find
[50:24] benefit uh to this Bible uh people
[50:26] military um our nation has studied a lot
[50:30] of the national or uh of of of the Bible
[50:33] in of the biblical Wars and things like
[50:36] that and they gleaned things from from
[50:38] that and found benefit uh uh and and and
[50:42] and you got money people that that teach
[50:44] on money and all that and they find
[50:47] their their their uh biblical principles
[50:50] the principles of their teaching is
[50:52] based upon the word of God and and they
[50:55] get benefit from that and and so many
[50:57] people around the world uh that get
[51:00] benefit just from uh the scriptures
[51:03] there but what is the real meaning of
[51:06] these scriptures why promises what why
[51:09] are they laying here for so we can get
[51:11] benefits from it and and things like
[51:13] that well you know as we know as message
[51:16] Believers we we know that the word of
[51:18] God has been a mystery it's it's been
[51:21] shut up uh uh you know be since the
[51:25] foundation of the world if we could said
[51:27] that way and uh um you know Roman or
[51:31] Revelations the 5th chapter talks about
[51:33] it being sealed with Seven Seals and if
[51:36] you could maybe uh Revelations 51 pull
[51:39] that up uh uh and and we all know it but
[51:43] I saw in the right hand of him that sat
[51:46] on the throne a book now we all know
[51:49] this book it's it's it's it's the
[51:52] content if if I'm just going to say it
[51:54] that way if we can uh look at it um uh
[51:57] it's the revelation of what is in this
[52:00] Bible praise the Lord can you say amen
[52:04] amen and and so uh uh uh so it was
[52:08] sealed up on the backside sealed with
[52:11] Seven Seals and and so as as we know it
[52:15] was in the hands of him that sat upon
[52:18] the throne it it was the title deed and
[52:21] and if you've listened to the SE Seven
[52:24] Seals and and other messages brother
[52:27] Brandon really goes into what that book
[52:29] is and what it means and it was you know
[52:33] Adam being having dominion and all these
[52:36] things he had the title deed to the
[52:39] Earth he had the title deed to to
[52:42] eternal life he had the title deed to
[52:44] these things he forfeited all of that
[52:47] amen when he fell but the book the title
[52:50] deed it the abstract uh it all went back
[52:53] to the hands of God the original own
[52:56] ain't that right amen and so Satan on
[52:59] the earth he's squatting on the earth
[53:02] and uh uh he has no right to the Earth
[53:06] but but he's able he's just a squatter
[53:08] he does not have the title deed to the
[53:11] Earth or uh to anything that's right but
[53:15] but it so the prophet says that this
[53:17] book is in the hands of him that sat
[53:19] upon the throne waiting for Redemption
[53:23] claims amen waiting it was a bloody
[53:27] bleeding lamb that came and took the
[53:29] book amen so so uh but it was waiting
[53:33] for Redemption claims no man was worthy
[53:37] to open it as we all know which brother
[53:40] Brandon would tell us that if the book
[53:42] wasn't open it meant that all creation
[53:45] was lost all the hopes of men were lost
[53:49] all the church going and all the the the
[53:52] uh professing Christianity and talking
[53:55] about heaven and and Millennium and all
[53:58] these things it was just it would it was
[54:00] all in vain it that book had to be open
[54:03] ain't that right and and and then we
[54:05] find there in Revelations 5 and and six
[54:09] uh it talks about the lamb coming and
[54:12] and opening the book and and uh uh and
[54:16] and he loose the seals thereof and and
[54:20] and then John talks about the U uh that
[54:24] everyone you know the angel began to cry
[54:27] out the elders began to sing and and all
[54:30] of these things and what a jubilee that
[54:34] took place because the book became open
[54:37] ain't that right now John had wept uh
[54:40] remember he was weeping he said I wept
[54:43] because no man was found worthy to open
[54:45] the book Someone told brother Brandon
[54:47] well he wept because he wasn't worthy
[54:49] himself to open the book and that wasn't
[54:51] the case it it was because that that
[54:54] without the book being opened everything
[54:56] was lost all mankind was lost everything
[54:59] was lost right and and so we we find
[55:03] that then then the Jubilee the worship
[55:06] began to take place and there was no
[55:08] negativity there was no there was no
[55:11] grumbling there was no complaining there
[55:13] was no it it was true worship it brother
[55:16] Ram said it King glamb worship because
[55:20] that book meant something the opening of
[55:23] that book and and then John found him
[55:26] self worshiping he he was no longer The
[55:28] Spectator watching this scene he stepped
[55:31] into it and he began to worship and he
[55:34] says all the creatures in Heaven and
[55:37] Earth and underneath and they all heard
[55:39] I John saying Glory blessings and honor
[55:42] and and power to the lamb ain't that
[55:45] right well now then then why would John
[55:48] worship what was why why did he get so
[55:51] moved by the opening of the book and and
[55:54] brother Brandon says it's because John
[55:57] saw his name he was able now to look up
[56:02] on the book and he goes ah there's John
[56:05] that's me you know I'm part of it so
[56:08] then every promise as I've said I just
[56:11] you know every page of the book every
[56:15] every promise that was given to the
[56:17] church uh uh from beginning to the end
[56:20] amen John could see his name amen he
[56:23] could now identify amen him self in the
[56:27] book so now he's part of the book he
[56:31] realizes he's part of the promise can
[56:35] you say Amen so Heaven and Earth will
[56:37] pass away but my word will never pass
[56:39] away do you realize what that Revelation
[56:42] meant to John when he saw himself as
[56:44] being part of the book of the word of
[56:47] God that meant you know everything would
[56:50] come against him well Jesus even said
[56:52] you know Upon This Rock revelation of
[56:55] Jesus Christ I will build my church and
[56:59] the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[57:01] against it water Revelation John
[57:04] realizing that he wasn't just having a
[57:07] revelation of some historical figure of
[57:10] 2,000 years ago but he had the
[57:13] Revelation that it was him amen Christ
[57:17] in you the hope of glory can you say
[57:20] Amen I'm part of this I'm just as
[57:23] predestinated as Jesus Christ was I am
[57:26] just as part of God as Jesus Christ was
[57:30] I'm part of the book just as much as
[57:32] Jesus Christ was amen every promise that
[57:35] spoke of Messiah Jesus was there to
[57:38] fulfill it amen so much that he was part
[57:41] of that book amen that the prophet said
[57:43] he could have raised on that first day
[57:45] he could have raised on that second day
[57:48] but what stopped him he was part of the
[57:50] book and the book says he would not
[57:52] raise on the first day he would not
[57:54] raise on the second day amen but on that
[57:57] third day there was nothing that was
[57:59] going to hold him back because the book
[58:02] said he would rise the book said amen
[58:05] God would honor that word can you say
[58:07] amen amen so that was the Revelation
[58:10] that John saw now we know that brother
[58:12] Ram says that John is a type of the
[58:15] Bride he's a type of this last day bride
[58:18] he's a type of you and I can you say
[58:21] Amen oh my amen now to think of it amen
[58:25] when the book was open amen the lamb
[58:28] came to open the book amen now John is
[58:31] showing our response once that
[58:34] Revelation strikes our heart amen John
[58:37] was no longer weeping John was no longer
[58:40] having his head down and just I just
[58:42] don't know what to do he got such a
[58:45] revelation amen that of him being part
[58:48] of that book let all hell come he would
[58:50] stand let all things come against him
[58:53] but he would stand amen because he was
[58:56] part of something bigger than himself
[58:58] well that's what you and I are we're
[59:01] part of something bigger than ourselves
[59:02] we're part of something bigger than
[59:04] politics we are part of something bigger
[59:06] than just religion we are part of
[59:08] something so much greater than death
[59:11] amen and trials and sickness and
[59:13] suffering can you say Amen yes sir amen
[59:18] so John amen he was caught up in this
[59:20] last day on The Lord's day and this is
[59:24] what he saw unfold the lamb come and
[59:27] open the book now what John saw church
[59:30] if we could if God would just help us
[59:32] get that Revelation in our soul amen is
[59:35] what John saw is what happened in
[59:38] 1963 the lamb came and opened the book
[59:43] but notice now it does not say in
[59:45] Revelations 5 what what caused John to
[59:48] see his name amen it it does not really
[59:52] Express all these things all we know is
[59:55] is the Lamb open the book and and
[59:57] everybody began to worship the Angels
[59:59] the elders and then John began to
[1:00:02] worship but then but we find that there
[1:00:04] was something that happened between the
[1:00:07] the the lamb opening the book and John
[1:00:10] seeing his name if we could say it that
[1:00:13] way amen because we're looking at at at
[1:00:15] you and I amen see if you had this book
[1:00:19] amen you you you you know everybody's
[1:00:21] got a Bible these days everybody reads
[1:00:24] this Bible you you talk to different
[1:00:26] ones well I've got a bible plan I've got
[1:00:28] a yearly plan to read this Bible once a
[1:00:30] year you know and a lot a lot a lot of
[1:00:32] people have read this book uh once a
[1:00:34] year they've read it they know it they
[1:00:36] they can tell you the stories of it they
[1:00:38] can tell you all of these things amen
[1:00:41] and still amen doesn't see their name in
[1:00:44] the book amen but what we see is a lamb
[1:00:47] Revelations 10:1 the mighty angel with
[1:00:50] an open book now he condens sin he
[1:00:53] descends from heaven with an open book
[1:00:56] not without the book but with the
[1:00:58] revelation of the book amen and and and
[1:01:01] and we know that at that coming at the
[1:01:04] same time of that coming there is a
[1:01:06] seventh angel on the earth amen a
[1:01:10] prophet can you say amen he could not be
[1:01:12] a theologian he could not be just a a
[1:01:16] philosopher or psychologist or whatever
[1:01:19] he had to be a prophet because the word
[1:01:22] of God would come to him amen and the
[1:01:25] prophet says that the mighty Angel gives
[1:01:28] the seventh angel the book why to reveal
[1:01:31] it to his people now Church how blessed
[1:01:35] we are to be sitting under the message
[1:01:38] of the seven Angel amen and to know that
[1:01:41] the seventh angel has sounded how many
[1:01:43] believes that we're not looking for the
[1:01:45] seventh angel to sound the seventh angel
[1:01:48] has sounded that's why we're not looking
[1:01:49] for another messenger we're not looking
[1:01:51] for another Prophet to come we're not
[1:01:53] looking for some other Revelation the
[1:01:55] message holds the key amen of this book
[1:01:59] Amen to reveal it to his people not to
[1:02:02] get us educated not to get us more
[1:02:05] refined but to reveal who we are in the
[1:02:10] book can you say amen amen every promise
[1:02:13] belongs to us do you believe that every
[1:02:16] promise belongs to us yes we're living
[1:02:18] in the in the worst AG ever the most
[1:02:21] evil hour ever but every promise belongs
[1:02:24] to to Shawn Martin amen I'm part of that
[1:02:27] book I'm part of God I'm part of deity
[1:02:30] deity is not in heaven it's in you oh
[1:02:33] thank God for the opening of the word
[1:02:35] amen to let us know who we are we are
[1:02:39] Miss Jesus Christ we're not just a
[1:02:41] church we're not just a a church member
[1:02:44] Amen brother brand says I no longer call
[1:02:46] you church I call you bride what is it
[1:02:48] people want to identify something they
[1:02:50] want to identify as a cat and they're
[1:02:52] identifying as this and identifying that
[1:02:54] but here come God him himself through
[1:02:56] the voice of a prophet and identifying
[1:03:00] us as his chosen bride because the lamb
[1:03:03] had opened the book can you say Amen so
[1:03:07] that's what these promises mean to us in
[1:03:10] this day do you believe that uh uh yes
[1:03:13] sir it's it's there and and so then we
[1:03:16] we find amen that there is going to be
[1:03:20] uh a a people now that's going to endure
[1:03:24] why amen because
[1:03:26] they're part of the word do you believe
[1:03:28] that no longer is this is this Bible
[1:03:32] just you know they they can burn this
[1:03:34] Bible and and and you know this Bible
[1:03:37] the the the pages are getting old things
[1:03:40] that's why I kind of leave it in my
[1:03:41] office and just because it's getting
[1:03:43] it's getting wore out you know and uh
[1:03:46] it's pretty bad he and and things but so
[1:03:49] this this will get old this will will is
[1:03:52] it's just paper but the content will
[1:03:56] never
[1:03:56] fail and the content is now becoming
[1:04:00] flesh do you believe that the content
[1:04:03] See and and that's That's what Satan
[1:04:05] don't understand the people don't
[1:04:08] understand the world don't understand
[1:04:10] Satan has been trying to get rid of the
[1:04:12] people Christians Believers for years
[1:04:15] trying to burn them to the Stak Flay
[1:04:18] them alive it doing everything he can
[1:04:22] amen but what he don't realize is every
[1:04:26] promise in this book will endure and I'm
[1:04:30] part of that promise God said he's going
[1:04:34] to have a bride without spot wrinkle or
[1:04:35] blemish I'm here and there will be
[1:04:38] nothing nothing that can destroy that
[1:04:41] can you say amen he can destroy this
[1:04:43] that I am the word I am the promise you
[1:04:46] are the word you're the promise amen
[1:04:49] you're the thing that God has been after
[1:04:51] can you he's not coming for a Bible he's
[1:04:54] coming for you
[1:04:56] you are the book you are the word can
[1:04:59] you say Amen yes sir he's coming for you
[1:05:02] now Revelations 129 it says the Great
[1:05:06] Dragon that old serpent called the devil
[1:05:08] and Satan deceiveth the whole world now
[1:05:12] that just looks that that's that's
[1:05:14] pretty uh uh discouraging if you just
[1:05:17] stop there it deceiver the whole world
[1:05:20] well then where am I what does that mean
[1:05:23] for us well Jesus said he that endure to
[1:05:26] the end the same that shall be shall be
[1:05:30] saved he that endure to the end so
[1:05:33] there's going to be a um the majority of
[1:05:36] the world be deceived amen by religion
[1:05:39] by politics by false promises by by all
[1:05:42] kinds of things but then there is a
[1:05:45] group of people that's going to endure
[1:05:48] but are they enduring in by themselves
[1:05:51] oh no look at the pressure that's on
[1:05:54] this bride look at the the the demons
[1:05:56] that have been loosed and poured out
[1:05:59] amen uh uh you know brother Doug Baker
[1:06:01] was talking about that and and how that
[1:06:04] them demons and how it was leased uh uh
[1:06:07] uh on the Jews and and and these things
[1:06:10] but then it it it now is being uh uh
[1:06:13] Unleashed upon the bride and he done the
[1:06:16] math you know and I don't I I I uh he's
[1:06:19] he's the smart one but he done the math
[1:06:22] and and uh things and and uh uh his
[1:06:25] equation was at the end of it is is per
[1:06:29] believer per bride member
[1:06:31] 37,000 I think that's what he said
[1:06:34] 38,000 or so demons up given to one
[1:06:39] individual that is part of this bride
[1:06:42] and and of course you know he's just
[1:06:43] doing math and he's not saying it's
[1:06:45] absolute you so so don't don't go there
[1:06:48] you know but but he's giv us the idea of
[1:06:50] the pressure that we are facing you're
[1:06:53] not just facing one little old demon
[1:06:56] you're not just facing two or three
[1:06:58] thousands of demons are are are are
[1:07:01] coming at you Amen to discourage you to
[1:07:04] break you to destroy you just to get you
[1:07:08] to recant and to get you to walk away
[1:07:10] from the message and and and and he's
[1:07:12] getting people all the time to walk away
[1:07:15] but there's a people that's going to
[1:07:18] endure amen but we're not facing this
[1:07:21] devil alone a there is no way we're
[1:07:23] we're not a match for the devil we're we
[1:07:26] we you you understand that try to fight
[1:07:29] him in your own nature try to fight him
[1:07:31] in your own self try to fight him in
[1:07:34] your own weakness and your own ability
[1:07:36] amen and all he can do you know you say
[1:07:38] well I'll fight him with my intellect
[1:07:40] well let him take your intellects away
[1:07:41] from you then then what are you going to
[1:07:43] do when you're in the nursing home or
[1:07:44] you're in you're you know people are
[1:07:47] going crazy these days you understand
[1:07:50] but he's invading amen but there is a
[1:07:53] people that's enduring now it's the of
[1:07:55] God that's going to endure Jesus already
[1:07:58] told us it's impossible for the elect to
[1:08:01] be deceived do you believe that amen
[1:08:03] it's impossible Jesus said that before
[1:08:05] this age ever got here you're living in
[1:08:07] the worst stage the greatest stage of
[1:08:10] deception and yet Jesus already declared
[1:08:13] in this age it would be impossible to
[1:08:15] deceive the the elect it's always been
[1:08:18] impossible to deceive the elect but in
[1:08:20] this age of the greatest age of
[1:08:22] deception is still imposs it's never
[1:08:24] changed Jesus has already declared it
[1:08:27] why because you're it's it's you're not
[1:08:29] just part of Faith Tabernacle you're not
[1:08:32] just far part of of of the of of a of a
[1:08:35] group called message Believers you are
[1:08:38] part of the word of God and cannot be
[1:08:43] deceived right do you believe that amen
[1:08:46] see now you know we may have been born
[1:08:48] Sinners and and and out in the world and
[1:08:52] and uh having the centner nature V
[1:08:55] nature under the condemnation of sin and
[1:08:57] death but as we know Paul says it it
[1:09:00] wasn't by our own choice amen that's
[1:09:03] right amen because according to Romans
[1:09:06] 8:20 he says we were made subject to
[1:09:08] vanity not willingly everybody say not
[1:09:12] willingly you were made subject to
[1:09:15] vanity you were made subject to trials
[1:09:17] you were made subject to weakness you
[1:09:18] were made subject to the sickness and
[1:09:21] and and and you were made subject to to
[1:09:23] feel you know even even spirits that try
[1:09:26] to bring on depression and and and and
[1:09:29] and and spirits that try to bring on
[1:09:31] unbelief and spirits that try to bring
[1:09:33] questions in your mind and and spirits
[1:09:35] that try to you know all of these things
[1:09:38] amen we were made subject to vanity not
[1:09:42] willingly see that God would make us
[1:09:45] subject to vanity for his own purpose
[1:09:48] for for even brother Bram told us you
[1:09:50] bypass that your theophany you bypass
[1:09:53] that word body and men to become flesh
[1:09:57] Amen to be tempted and tried and tested
[1:10:00] you realize the greatest uh victory that
[1:10:03] God has is in you amen yes sir Jesus had
[1:10:08] a great Victory amen when he conquered
[1:10:11] death hell in the grave and and and
[1:10:13] these things but he was not born the way
[1:10:16] you were born in the sense that he
[1:10:18] wasn't born a sinner he's not he was
[1:10:20] born flesh and blood can you say Amen
[1:10:23] but he was actually born uh uh with a uh
[1:10:26] not by a sex seed a defiled seed he was
[1:10:30] born a a created amen he was created in
[1:10:33] that womb of of Mary can you say Amen
[1:10:37] but here we are amen we are with a vile
[1:10:40] nature we were born Sinners we were
[1:10:43] rotten to the core from the the get-go
[1:10:47] of of our birth and and so we we we went
[1:10:50] from from uh uh attribute the prophet
[1:10:53] said and bypass the word body that
[1:10:56] theophany to be tempted and
[1:10:59] tried amen that's right we had to be
[1:11:02] tested we had to be tried to think of it
[1:11:05] what a victory Jesus had but what a
[1:11:08] greater Victory you have that was born
[1:11:11] of a woman born in sin born you didn't
[1:11:15] even stand a chance can you say Amen
[1:11:18] Satan had you from the get goal amen and
[1:11:21] and and and and and it tells and every
[1:11:23] baby that that comes and watch him start
[1:11:26] growing throws his temper tantrums and
[1:11:28] throws his fits and and and he bites and
[1:11:31] he lies and he this and he's that and
[1:11:34] and uh well even rock and roll begins to
[1:11:36] catch them and and and uh uh these
[1:11:39] things and because they're subject to
[1:11:41] these things TV catches them can you say
[1:11:45] Amen Hollywood catches them it's an
[1:11:47] attraction because there is a a nature
[1:11:50] in there that is so against God so vile
[1:11:54] but when God redeemed you amen and he
[1:11:57] brought you out of that change your
[1:12:01] nature change your desire change your
[1:12:04] way what a victory of his amen where it
[1:12:07] looked like you were Hellbound amen it
[1:12:09] looked like you was in despair Satan
[1:12:11] would able to was able to scar you by
[1:12:14] your past and mistakes and made you a
[1:12:17] victim of his and all that and God steps
[1:12:20] in and changes everything about you what
[1:12:23] a victory that is can you say Amen so
[1:12:26] yes we had to be tested and tried we had
[1:12:29] to know defeat and sorrow and failure
[1:12:32] amen but that's not our end for that's
[1:12:35] the only the temporary part of us I know
[1:12:39] you know these things but I'm going to
[1:12:40] remind you again that's just temporary
[1:12:43] that's a temporary part of you that's
[1:12:45] why we shouldn't dwell on these things
[1:12:46] don't dwell upon them things amen that's
[1:12:49] only
[1:12:50] temporary you're dwelling on things that
[1:12:52] is here to pass amen look at the things
[1:12:55] that's here to stay look at the things
[1:12:58] that's going to endure there's something
[1:13:00] about you that's
[1:13:01] enduring amen that's right yes sir
[1:13:06] because the same God that made us
[1:13:07] subject to vanity also subjected us to a
[1:13:11] hope you know the Bible doesn't call us
[1:13:14] defeated the Bible doesn't call us weak
[1:13:17] and begly the Bible doesn't call us low
[1:13:20] lives or worthless that's the devil that
[1:13:22] does that amen that's right notice 1
[1:13:26] John 3:1 behold what manner of love the
[1:13:29] father hath bestowed upon us that we
[1:13:31] should be called defeated that we should
[1:13:34] be called vagabonds that we should just
[1:13:36] be called worthless and live like we're
[1:13:38] worthless and act like we're worthless
[1:13:40] and know that we should be called the
[1:13:43] sons of God and brother Brandon really
[1:13:45] makes that clear you are not going to be
[1:13:48] sons of God you are called sons of God
[1:13:50] now you're not going to be changed into
[1:13:53] sons of God you are son of God now he
[1:13:56] even goes back you always were the sons
[1:13:59] of God it's written in the book can you
[1:14:02] say Amen it's written in the book amen
[1:14:05] see so what we're doing is identifying
[1:14:08] ourselves amen with what the word of God
[1:14:10] says about us we're not identifying with
[1:14:13] what the devil has done to us we're not
[1:14:15] identifying with our past oh help us to
[1:14:18] walk away from our past amen and start
[1:14:21] living in the new we are a new creation

[1:14:27] super race not a defeated race it's a
[1:14:30] new thing can you say Amen yes sir so we
[1:14:35] are called in Christ chosen in Christ
[1:14:37] faithful in Christ you know what brother
[1:14:40] Braham says they have been chosen before
[1:14:42] the foundation of the world and are
[1:14:44] abiding in their calling now you think
[1:14:46] of that he that endureth to the end not
[1:14:50] well I'm just going to be a preacher and

[1:14:59] our calling amen we are enduring in the
[1:15:02] thing that God has called us to can you
[1:15:05] say Amen oh man see that that means
[1:15:08] there there's more than just coming to
[1:15:10] church it's more than just being
[1:15:11] religious it's more than just being part
[1:15:13] of the choir and part of religious
[1:15:15] programs and all that oh my but there is
[1:15:18] a people that's been chosen before the
[1:15:20] foundation of the world and God has
[1:15:22] called them for this this position and
[1:15:25] that position and that position it's all
[1:15:26] in the word can you say amen and they
[1:15:29] are abiding in their
[1:15:32] calling yes sir and brother brand one
[1:15:35] place said they are the ones that

[1:18:24] killed thy prophets and dig down thine
[1:18:26] altars and I am left alone and they seek

[1:19:18] begun a good work in you will perform it
[1:19:21] we'll complete it we'll we'll finalize

[1:19:33] could say it this way don't you look at
[1:19:35] the world don't look at your wants and
[1:19:37] don't look at these and then judge God
[1:19:40] his faithfulness by all of that don't
[1:19:43] judge God by being faithful by how much
[1:19:46] money you got in the bank don't judge
[1:19:49] God as being faithful by whether you got
[1:19:51] a job or not don't you judge God being
[1:19:54] faithful by whether your children are
[1:19:56] saved or whatever don't you judge God by
[1:19:59] that God is faithful to his word God is
[1:20:02] obligated to his word can you say amen
[1:20:04] amen therefore we can be judge God
[1:20:07] faithful by his word that when the
[1:20:10] situation is so Rank and it's so

[1:20:15] we can still judge God Faithful because
[1:20:18] it's according to his
[1:20:20] word yes sir he's going to perform it
[1:20:24] amen he's going to perform it amen you

[1:20:56] complete it finalize it finish it up for
[1:20:59] you amen amen and when did he began the
[1:21:03] good work now notice when did he begin
[1:21:06] the work four Romans 8:29 for whom he
[1:21:09] did four know he also did predestinate
[1:21:11] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:21:14] so this is why those that he forew he
[1:21:17] didn't say whom he did for no did he
[1:21:19] also predestinate to be
[1:21:22] wealthy amen come on them he also
[1:21:26] predestinated to have a life of ease no
[1:21:29] no no but to be conformed to the image
[1:21:31] of his son wealthy or not he
[1:21:34] predestinated you to be conformed to the
[1:21:36] image of his son health or not he he
[1:21:39] predestinated you to be conformed to the
[1:21:40] image of his son big church or not he
[1:21:43] predestinated you to be conformed to the
[1:21:45] image of his son you understand what I'm
[1:21:47] saying trial free or not amen some
[1:21:49] people have more trials than other
[1:21:51] people have but he it doesn't change
[1:21:53] what he predestined ated you to be he
[1:21:56] does it by his own counsel can you say
[1:21:58] Amen all we know is he predestinated us
[1:22:01] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:22:04] and what comes what goes it does not
[1:22:06] matter he is faithful to his word amen
[1:22:11] amen that he might be the firstborn
[1:22:13] among many Brethren moreover whom he did
[1:22:16] predestinate them he also called and
[1:22:18] whom he called them he also Justified
[1:22:19] and whom he justified they he also
[1:22:22] glorified as I've said before you didn't
[1:22:24] reflect anything of that yeah you didn't
[1:22:28] reflect anything of what God called you
[1:22:30] to be and predestinated you to be when
[1:22:32] you were born in this world because you
[1:22:35] had a sinful nature but nonetheless you
[1:22:37] were predestinated to it can you say
[1:22:39] amen and if you're predestinated that
[1:22:41] means you've got a word everybody say a
[1:22:43] word genan seed in you not not a sex
[1:22:48] seed a gene word Gene seed in you before
[1:22:52] the foundation of the world
[1:22:54] can you say amen and brother brandham
[1:22:57] called that seed a little grain of
[1:22:59] life a little grain of Life another
[1:23:03] place he says it was another nature in
[1:23:05] Us by predestination we only catered to
[1:23:08] one nature our first nature that was our
[1:23:11] first nature a vile nature a nature that
[1:23:13] was against God a nature that fought
[1:23:15] against God a nature that couldn't see
[1:23:17] the things of God a nature that loved
[1:23:19] the world and the things of the world
[1:23:21] that's what we cater to no wonder Satan
[1:23:24] was able to draw us and lure us and and
[1:23:26] we were just dumb enough to follow him
[1:23:28] and and how many's got scars of your
[1:23:30] past you got scars of your past boy I've
[1:23:33] I've got scars in my past well you know
[1:23:36] that was just because I I followed after
[1:23:38] Satan and this is what he done to us you
[1:23:40] know understand what I'm saying but that
[1:23:42] was our first nature but brother
[1:23:44] brandham says you know we done that
[1:23:45] because we didn't have the new
[1:23:47] birth ain't that right but even while we
[1:23:50] were doing all that catering to all that
[1:23:51] there was another nature inside of us
[1:23:54] and he said that Jean seed was still
[1:23:56] working then that's right you out
[1:23:58] drinking in the bar and that Jean seed
[1:24:01] was still working then I thinking to
[1:24:03] brother Chris Long a pastor in there in
[1:24:05] Arizona he said man if you only knew
[1:24:08] what I used to be you know and he says I
[1:24:10] should be dead by now he said I was I
[1:24:12] was in the motorcycles and and this and
[1:24:14] that and and and he says I was just a
[1:24:16] rough character but all that time there
[1:24:19] was a jean seed working then think of
[1:24:23] that we couldn't be satisfied in the
[1:24:25] world we we couldn't we couldn't even be
[1:24:28] satisfied in religion that's couldn't
[1:24:32] settle down that's right amen so we can
[1:24:35] identify what a prophet said there in
[1:24:37] Psalms it's the Deep calleth unto the
[1:24:40] deep can you say Amen yes sir amen it
[1:24:43] was a desire a craving for God and yet
[1:24:46] we wouldn't even know what we were
[1:24:48] Desiring but something down inside of us
[1:24:51] but listen Church before you could have
[1:24:53] ever created had that desire that desire
[1:24:55] had to be created in you brother Braham
[1:24:58] said that's what that is desire is
[1:25:01] created can you say Amen it's a creation
[1:25:05] brother Bram said before you can have a
[1:25:07] desire that has to be a Creator there
[1:25:09] has to be a Creator to create that
[1:25:11] desire and see so that desire comes from
[1:25:14] the Eternal Gene seed of God that was
[1:25:17] placed in us a desire to be part of the
[1:25:20] promises of God a desire to be a Son of
[1:25:23] God a desire to be restored back we
[1:25:26] didn't understand what them desires were
[1:25:28] but I tell you what when we come into
[1:25:29] the message and we found the truth and
[1:25:31] the book became open to us the desire
[1:25:35] that it it it it just it's like we
[1:25:37] settle down in realities of the book we
[1:25:41] settle down not this world ain't a
[1:25:43] reality to us anymore there's a city
[1:25:46] that's a reality to us there's a heaven
[1:25:48] a millennium that's becoming a more
[1:25:50] reality to us every
[1:25:52] day Glory yes
[1:25:55] adoption being restored as sons of God
[1:25:59] ruling and
[1:26:00] reigning that's becoming more of a
[1:26:03] reality than anything amen you think of
[1:26:05] a person that's sick and a revelation of
[1:26:08] him being
[1:26:09] healed amen comes to him the reality of
[1:26:13] his healing is more real than his
[1:26:16] sickness that's what makes him profess
[1:26:19] I'm Healed that's right why because it's
[1:26:21] more of reality than the pain amen it's
[1:26:24] more of reality than the symptoms can
[1:26:27] you say amen and we're realizing now
[1:26:30] amen that what we are every promise in
[1:26:33] this book is becoming more of a reality
[1:26:35] to us that we cast aside every negative
[1:26:38] thought we cast aside every little thing
[1:26:41] of this world and we start looking to
[1:26:43] heaven we start looking to the things
[1:26:45] that God has promised us amen do you
[1:26:47] think we worship God you know God based
[1:26:50] upon how we feel and how we don't feel
[1:26:52] you know I I understand there's there a
[1:26:54] lot of folks that do that their worship
[1:26:56] hinges on whether they feel good whether
[1:26:59] they don't feel good everything about
[1:27:01] them it it just their emotions they
[1:27:04] build their life upon emotions they
[1:27:06] build their Christianity upon emotions
[1:27:08] they build their faith upon emotions so
[1:27:10] if they're feeling good that everything
[1:27:12] is going right boy they're just there wo
[1:27:14] you know and then when the things that
[1:27:16] ain't going good then they just don't
[1:27:17] know and and and you don't know if
[1:27:19] they're going to even come to church you
[1:27:21] don't even know if they're going to
[1:27:22] backslide you just really don't know
[1:27:24] what's going to happen you understand
[1:27:25] what I'm saying but to those that have
[1:27:27] really got a revelation that they are
[1:27:30] part of the word of God and they cannot
[1:27:33] fail amen their worship stems from that
[1:27:38] Revelation yes sir it stems from that
[1:27:40] Revelation their confession stems from
[1:27:43] the Revelation can you say Amen oh do
[1:27:46] you love
[1:27:47] him yes sir I love him amen amen you
[1:27:51] know brother Braham said no man ever
[1:27:54] come to God empty and went away Desiring
[1:27:57] to be filled but what was full Lord amen
[1:28:01] if you desire to be full of
[1:28:05] God God will fill it and you won't have
[1:28:08] to walk away still
[1:28:10] empty if you're Desiring more of God you
[1:28:12] don't have to walk away
[1:28:14] empty why because you're part of the
[1:28:16] word of God God is here to honor his
[1:28:19] word God is here to to to to to make
[1:28:23] that word come to pass pass can you say
[1:28:26] Amen yes sir if we could get a
[1:28:28] revelation of that now 1 Thessalonians
[1:28:31] 5:24 Faithful Is He everybody say
[1:28:33] faithful fath faithful is he that
[1:28:35] calleth you who also will do it amen
[1:28:39] amen that's right Philippians 2:13 it is
[1:28:42] God which worketh in you both to Will
[1:28:44] and to do of his good pleasure amen do
[1:28:48] you believe that
[1:28:49] Amen brother Bram says now I want to
[1:28:52] show you what I find in the thought of
[1:28:54] faithful you know we often talk about a
[1:28:57] great unchanging God whose word does not
[1:29:00] change and when we speak of him after
[1:29:02] that manner we often get a view of him
[1:29:04] that makes him seem very
[1:29:07] impersonal it is as though God made the
[1:29:09] whole universe and all the laws that
[1:29:11] pertained to it and then stood back and
[1:29:13] become a great impersonal God it is as
[1:29:16] though God made a way of salvation for
[1:29:18] lost mankind that way being the cross
[1:29:22] and then when the death of Christ has a
[1:29:24] atone for our sins and his resurrection
[1:29:26] gave us an open door to him God just
[1:29:28] folded his arms and stood back it is as
[1:29:31] if we majored in believing in a great
[1:29:34] Creator who having created lost personal
[1:29:37] interest in his creation Now I say that
[1:29:40] is how too many people are apt to think
[1:29:43] but that is wrong thinking amen for God
[1:29:46] is governing the Affairs of men right
[1:29:49] now he is both Creator and sustainer
[1:29:52] amen amen he is a sovereign God by his
[1:29:56] own counsel he purposed the plan of the
[1:29:58] Salvation of his own El uh elect which
[1:30:01] he forew the son died upon the cross to
[1:30:04] establish the means of Salvation and the
[1:30:06] Holy Spirit carefully everybody say
[1:30:09] carefully executes the will of the
[1:30:13] father
[1:30:15] amen he is working all things at this
[1:30:17] moment according to the purpose of his
[1:30:19] own will he is right in the midst of it
[1:30:22] all he is in the midst of his church
[1:30:24] this great Creator savior God is
[1:30:26] Faithfully working amongst his own right
[1:30:30] now as the great Shepherd of the Sheep
[1:30:32] amen his very existence is for his own
[1:30:37] yes
[1:30:38] amen can you imagine amen what he
[1:30:42] reveals himself to
[1:30:45] us is for us praise the Lord he's
[1:30:49] revealed himself as Jehovah
[1:30:52] Gyra for you for me every every
[1:30:56] attribute that he is he's revealed it
[1:30:58] for
[1:30:59] us his very existence is for uh his own
[1:31:04] he loves them and cares for them His Eye
[1:31:08] Is ever upon them when the word says
[1:31:11] that your lives are HID with Christ and
[1:31:13] God it means exactly what it says oh I
[1:31:17] am so glad that my God abides faithful
[1:31:21] he is true to himself he won't lie he is
[1:31:24] true to the word he will back it up he
[1:31:27] is true to us he will loose none of us
[1:31:30] but raise us up in the last
[1:31:34] days can you say amen I believe oh we
[1:31:38] could go on and on but I you know bless
[1:31:42] his name I I thought of Jesus as he was
[1:31:45] here a predestinated seed of God
[1:31:49] predestinated
[1:31:51] word he stood there so confident in God
[1:31:55] that no matter what the devil threw at
[1:31:57] him it just never moved him amen he knew
[1:32:02] beyond the shadow of a doubt that he was
[1:32:05] there to fulfill the word of God
[1:32:08] right I like what brother Jonathan said
[1:32:11] there he said you know it's not you
[1:32:13] carrying the message but it's the
[1:32:16] message carrying
[1:32:17] you the word of God carrying
[1:32:21] you oh we should never just treat this
[1:32:24] message
[1:32:26] lightly this is our sustainer this is
[1:32:29] the word of God for this
[1:32:31] age
[1:32:33] hello I know this word is so different
[1:32:35] it's so odd the message is so different
[1:32:39] from the rest of the world but it comes
[1:32:41] from the very Mind Of God something
[1:32:43] that's been hid a lot of well all the
[1:32:47] messages uh in throughout the day the
[1:32:49] doctrines and that that we have today
[1:32:52] and throughout the world has been formed
[1:32:54] and formulated by men that was reading
[1:32:57] from a closed book but there's one
[1:33:00] Doctrine there's one Faith there's one
[1:33:03] message that is actually coming from an
[1:33:05] open
[1:33:07] book amen amen that's right and it's not
[1:33:11] us carrying it it's carrying
[1:33:14] us yes and Jesus knew it he knew that
[1:33:17] the word was carrying him he was the
[1:33:19] word that word was so in him that that
[1:33:22] that word that was him was caring him
[1:33:25] was sustaining him was leading him was
[1:33:28] strengthening him how else could he go
[1:33:30] to to Goa how else could he take the
[1:33:33] worst death ever possible to man because
[1:33:36] the word said he would do itall the word
[1:33:39] held him amen glory the word led him the
[1:33:44] word sustained him praise be to God and
[1:33:47] so is it today the word is sustaining us
[1:33:49] the word is carrying us can you say
[1:33:52] amenes Jesus knew it he knew amen uh you
[1:33:56] know brother brand says no matter if he
[1:33:58] was in a storm and the Gail is knocking
[1:34:01] the boat from one side to the other or
[1:34:03] he was standing in a face a mess of
[1:34:05] demons if he was hanging anywhere it
[1:34:07] never moved him he walked right on just
[1:34:10] as calm and quiet as he could be why he
[1:34:12] was simply unconscious of fear or
[1:34:15] anything around him that's right now
[1:34:17] that's way God wants us to be you know
[1:34:19] that right unconscious of fear or
[1:34:22] anything around us
[1:34:25] yeah yeah there's all kinds of things
[1:34:26] that's threatening to destroy our faith
[1:34:29] amen but we must walk unconscious of
[1:34:32] that don't let that be your reality let
[1:34:35] the word of God be the reality there's
[1:34:38] things all around us that's threatening
[1:34:39] our existence threatening our joy
[1:34:42] threatening our our our well just
[1:34:44] threatening everything Amen to where we
[1:34:47] just don't feel like we're going to make
[1:34:48] it don't feel like we're going to go in
[1:34:49] a Rapture but yeah I mean it it's just
[1:34:52] there but Satan can do that because he's
[1:34:54] working up on our emotions our feelings
[1:34:56] and everything but he still can't get
[1:34:58] that
[1:34:59] Soul that's where that genan seed lies
[1:35:01] is in that
[1:35:04] Soul amen so therefore he was simply
[1:35:08] unconscious of fear anything around him
[1:35:10] whether it was going to happen or
[1:35:11] whether it wasn't going to happen see he
[1:35:13] knew it was going to happen because God
[1:35:14] said so so he didn't say oh if I had
[1:35:17] prayed through if I wondered if I fast
[1:35:19] enough I wondered if I did this he just
[1:35:20] walked right on unconscious and you're
[1:35:23] here to fulfill it
[1:35:25] too you with me amen you're here to
[1:35:28] fulfill it too is he guessing about it
[1:35:30] NOP he's reading it from a book The open
[1:35:33] book it's something that's become he's
[1:35:36] the one that's he remember he's the one
[1:35:38] that's revealing it to his people
[1:35:40] through the people through the elect of
[1:35:42] godl and he's he's letting us know you
[1:35:44] got a purpose in this life you've got to
[1:35:46] fulfill the word of God brothers and
[1:35:49] sisters we're not passing the Baton to
[1:35:51] another age that's true amen
[1:35:54] nope nope nope the buck stops with you

[1:36:09] the manifestation of the sons of God is
[1:36:11] for you that's right can you say Amen
[1:36:14] abolutely no matter how bad it looks
[1:36:15] it's for you the word of God says that's
[1:36:18] right don't just cast it away amen so
[1:36:22] what we got to do is cast away all
[1:36:24] imaginations everything that's contrary
[1:36:26] to the word of God you cast that aside
[1:36:29] and stay with the word of God Amen the
[1:36:31] word of God liveth and abideth forever
[1:36:34] amen so just walk unconscious of fear
