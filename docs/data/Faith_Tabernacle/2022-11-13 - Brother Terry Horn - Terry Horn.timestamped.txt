[31:04] amen we're going to turn to the Book of
[31:07] Luke appreciate the Lord we're good glad
[31:10] to be here and love the Lord thank God
[31:12] for he sent us a message here to
[31:14] shed the light on the word for this hour
[31:17] good morning to you class
[31:21] brother Joe told me Wednesday night I
[31:23] said I'm going to be looking for I'll be
[31:24] ready for class Sunday morning so I'm
[31:28] just the substitute teacher you know the
[31:29] Holy Ghost is a teacher so I'm just a
[31:32] substitute but we want to look into a
[31:35] different subject but
[31:37] and and and talking about and studying
[31:40] this subject we're going to look into
[31:42] actually uh
[31:44] uh maybe for the younger generation of
[31:47] people who may not really understand
[31:49] what happened back then which is going
[31:51] to explain in detail but um
[31:54] it will actually answer help answer a
[31:57] couple of questions that we'll try to
[31:59] answer at the end of of the lesson this
[32:01] morning and it'll help us to understand
[32:03] even in Malachi 4 turn the hearts of the
[32:06] of the of the children back to the
[32:08] Pentecostal fathers and you know in the
[32:11] because the Pentecost was the last
[32:12] Revival that always wants to lap over
[32:14] into the present Revival which is a word
[32:17] Revival and so understanding that and
[32:19] it'll actually will answer a couple of
[32:22] questions so we're going to talk about
[32:24] this miracle and we're going to sort of
[32:26] turn to Luke 24 49 and most of you know
[32:29] where we're going with that but this
[32:32] miracle we're going to talk about is not
[32:34] just any Miracle uh it's not just
[32:36] Miracles but it's a very somewhat of
[32:39] elusive Miracle to Christianity in
[32:42] general it's mostly misunderstood by the
[32:44] Pentecostal people because they take a
[32:46] couple of words in there and and they
[32:48] actually apply a different meaning to it
[32:51] because they don't really understand
[32:52] what really happened during that time
[32:54] but to understand this miracle to help
[32:57] us understand some of the focuses today
[32:59] so we're going to talk about this
[33:01] miracle and we'll read it and we'll
[33:03] explain it and the Lord will help us
[33:05] we're going to have church this morning
[33:07] enjoy it the Lord bless you okay Luke 24
[33:10] 49.
[33:13] and
[33:15] very short scripture very simple Jesus
[33:18] speaking and behold I sin the promise is
[33:20] one of the last words Jesus spoke before
[33:22] he ascended behold I send the promise of
[33:25] my father upon you but tarry ye in the
[33:27] city of Jerusalem until you be endued
[33:30] with power
[33:31] from on high now of course this is Jesus
[33:34] as I said speaking and now he's speaking
[33:36] to us 11 plus the others that was with
[33:38] him before he ascended and at this point
[33:41] the disciples didn't know have a clue
[33:44] what they were going to receive what
[33:46] they were going to experience he just
[33:47] said go up to the city of Jerusalem and
[33:49] tarry wait
[33:51] and they didn't know but it would be a
[33:54] very very great miracle
[33:56] so we're gonna look about this I want to
[33:59] call it the miracle of Pentecost but not
[34:01] just to look at what happened at
[34:02] Pentecost which a lot of people really
[34:04] really don't know unless they've studied
[34:05] it out the details of what happened it's
[34:08] very important to details because in the
[34:09] details it really explains some some
[34:12] misunderstandings so we want to look
[34:14] into that this morning so if your bar
[34:17] has let's pray Lord Jesus we're thankful
[34:20] Lord to be here we're thankful Lord to
[34:22] be have this understanding dear Gods
[34:25] you've given us we thank you that you
[34:26] sent us a prophet a word Messenger to
[34:28] give us Enlightenment of the word for
[34:30] this hour we so appreciate that with all
[34:33] of our heart Lord where would we be we
[34:34] would be deceived like laodicea but Lord
[34:37] because we're not part of laodicea we've
[34:40] been called out of that and we're so
[34:42] thankful and we appreciate it Lord speak
[34:44] to us through your word hide me behind
[34:47] the cross Lord and this little teaching
[34:49] that we have this morning may it be a
[34:50] help and a blessing and and uh be
[34:53] fruitful Lord that we might have a
[34:54] little bit better understand ending and
[34:57] gain more a little bit more insight Lord
[34:59] and and weapons read the fight the enemy
[35:02] God may you grant it we ask you in the
[35:04] name of the Lord Jesus and everybody
[35:05] says amen you can be seated
[35:09] God bless you amen our visitors and each
[35:11] one that's here
[35:13] now I'm going to take my I don't like
[35:22] it amen
[35:29] speaking on this miracle at Pentecost
[35:32] it's really one of the most
[35:33] misunderstood subjects in the Bible and
[35:36] uh really the church was birthed on the
[35:39] day of Pentecost and most a lot of
[35:41] people just don't really understand what
[35:43] really happened on the day of Pentecost
[35:45] the miracle of Pentecost now I'm going
[35:47] to read a lot of quotes and the reason
[35:48] especially at the beginning because
[35:50] brother bam goes through this especially
[35:52] on the question answers on the on the
[35:54] Holy Ghost and he tells in details that
[35:56] there's three or four details in there
[35:58] that it's really really not known that
[36:01] really needs to be known that really
[36:03] helps us understand really really what
[36:06] happened so everybody ready
[36:08] Amen brother them said he said now
[36:11] Pentecost after they had walked with the
[36:13] word after they had seen the word Christ
[36:16] after they believed the word Christ but
[36:19] before they could see the miracle of
[36:21] Pentecost they had to obey the word see
[36:25] go up to the city Jerusalem said the
[36:28] word and wait there until you've been
[36:30] dude with power now there's a sermon all
[36:33] within that just that verse there or
[36:35] that quote there and he goes on to say
[36:37] and brothers going to kind of dramatize
[36:39] this a little bit he said I can hear
[36:40] Peter say you know something tells me
[36:43] that it is just it right there in the
[36:44] upper room now it is it right that ain't
[36:47] just exactly obeying the word see if we
[36:49] expect to see the miracle they've been
[36:50] there a couple of days now he's
[36:51] dramatizing said if we expect to see the
[36:54] miracle that God promised up of sending
[36:56] this a promise of the father upon us
[36:58] we've got to wait here until something
[37:00] happens
[37:02] and then he continues to say brethren uh
[37:06] you know stealing this little drama we
[37:08] couldn't walk out of here like that
[37:09] without even seeing any experience at
[37:12] all see we've got to have something
[37:14] because he said wait here until you be
[37:16] endued with power
[37:18] now I haven't got it now Peter speaking
[37:20] I haven't got any more power than I did
[37:22] when I come I've been here all night
[37:24] I've been here the next night I've been
[37:26] here nine nights I'm just the same I was
[37:28] when I come here and he told us we would
[37:31] receive power so let's just keep waiting
[37:35] another place where the man says then
[37:37] all of a sudden when the they and I like
[37:40] this he said then all of a sudden when
[37:41] they fully obeyed the word
[37:44] then they saw the miracle of Pentecost
[37:47] they saw the fire falling to build him
[37:49] the pillar of fire came down amongst the
[37:51] People Big licks of fire Cleveland
[37:53] tongue set upon each of them now even in
[37:57] this what we've covered so far
[38:00] I'd say probably the very first
[38:02] principle and the most important
[38:04] principle and that is to obey the word
[38:07] fully obey when they as he said when
[38:11] they fully obeyed that's when the
[38:13] miracle happened that's when God's
[38:15] blessing happened when they fully obeyed
[38:17] the word of God and as the Bible teaches
[38:19] us in the book of Acts God gives the
[38:21] Holy Ghost to them that obey so it it
[38:23] really boils down first of all first the
[38:25] most important principle is to fully
[38:27] obey the word of God
[38:29] so we find that to be true now in
[38:31] understanding what really happened on
[38:33] this day uh we'll find out really at
[38:38] first now the Azusa Street Pentecostal
[38:41] Revival 1906 it really had little
[38:43] resemblance of really what happened on
[38:45] the day of Pentecost now also the
[38:48] Pentecost Revival brother man said won't
[38:49] mix with this now this is a word Revival
[38:51] it's all together different from the
[38:53] last Revival the Pentecostal Revival we
[38:55] we know these things but you're going to
[38:57] see this is going to be helpful as we
[38:59] get especially down to them but as we go
[39:01] through this I want you to get a mental
[39:03] picture as you picture what really
[39:05] happened as they were going through this
[39:07] you know as the Bible condenses uh it's
[39:10] it's verses and so forth it doesn't tell
[39:12] in detail it just condenses his word so
[39:14] I want you to try to get a mental
[39:16] picture as we go through this
[39:18] and brother M said now and the rapture
[39:21] What mo what if Moses would have come
[39:23] and brought Noah's message we'll build
[39:25] art float down and out it would not have
[39:27] worked and neither would Jesus message
[39:29] have worked of Moses neither will
[39:31] Wesley's message even work in Luther and
[39:33] so forth and vice versa and today we our
[39:36] last Reformation was Pentecost and today
[39:39] we're moving from that and the
[39:41] Pentecostal message won't work with this
[39:43] this because this is another day it's
[39:46] all God's word but it's building like
[39:48] the feet arms coming up it's forming a
[39:51] bride for the Rapture and hold that feet
[39:53] arms coming up we'll get to that in a
[39:56] minute now Jesus told them to tarry and
[39:59] wait until they're being dude with power
[40:01] now as president goes on to say he says
[40:03] now notice Jesus had commissioned him to
[40:05] go into up at Jerusalem and await the
[40:08] word Terry means wait he said it don't
[40:10] doesn't mean pray it means to wait they
[40:13] was not fit subjects now remember there
[40:15] was 11's with him as well as the other
[40:17] it was 120 all in total but the 11
[40:20] disciples were with him
[40:21] um uh he said they was not fit subjects
[40:25] to preach because they only knew his
[40:28] resurrection by his person now that's
[40:31] that's very interesting important
[40:32] because even Jesus speaking to Peter and
[40:36] he asked him who do you say that I am
[40:37] and we we know that he said Flesh and
[40:40] Blood did not reveal this you but my
[40:41] Father which is in heaven has revealed
[40:43] this and Upon This Rock I'll build my
[40:45] church it's a spiritual revelation of
[40:47] who Christ is that's the Capstone
[40:49] Revelation the Supreme deity of Jesus
[40:52] Christ but you don't find him and you
[40:54] don't know him they didn't know him just
[40:56] by walking with him and fishing with him
[40:58] and and even seeing his miracles and so
[41:01] forth they didn't know God by his person
[41:04] it came by revelation
[41:07] and it always come by racism Paul Paul
[41:09] didn't see the person but he got the
[41:11] revelation
[41:13] same same thing
[41:15] amen
[41:16] he commanded them not to preach anymore
[41:18] or do nothing until they first had been
[41:20] endued with power from on high now if
[41:22] God would not let them preach until they
[41:24] went to Pentecost and received the
[41:25] Pentecostal experience no man unless
[41:29] some deep desire of his own or some
[41:30] organization has commissioned him has a
[41:33] right to enter the pulpit until he has
[41:35] been filled with the Holy Ghost that's
[41:38] exactly right and we can all say Amen to
[41:41] that how can how can he be a spiritual
[41:43] leader if he don't have the spirit
[41:44] within him
[41:45] amen now you know it's like the
[41:48] Pharisees they they knew the the the
[41:50] Miracles of Moses but they didn't know
[41:53] the god of Moses they could read all
[41:55] about him you know in the law but they
[41:57] didn't know the god of Moses
[41:59] now the first instructions were to wait
[42:02] and I it's difficult to wait well the
[42:04] hardest thing for people to do his way
[42:07] so it's just a way I mean especially uh
[42:10] patience is a is almost a bygone thing
[42:13] but they told him to wait
[42:15] now we know Eve wrote that first example
[42:17] she just couldn't wait and brother bam
[42:19] said but now there are 120 up there both
[42:21] being in a weapon in this upper room now
[42:24] let's notice something really kind of
[42:27] different about this upper room as we
[42:28] begin to kind of break this down
[42:31] the prophet God said the origin of the
[42:33] Oriental country seldom had stairway
[42:35] inside the stairway was outside now
[42:39] begin to get this mental picture what
[42:40] happened in the upper room one day of
[42:42] Pentecost the stairway was on the
[42:44] outside outside the temple we were told
[42:46] there was a Stairway that led up to a
[42:49] little room way up go up up up until you
[42:52] get to a little room up there like a
[42:54] storage room on top of the temple some
[42:55] kind of a little room Upper Room the
[42:57] Bible said they were in there and the
[42:59] doors were shut because they were afraid
[43:01] of the Jews
[43:03] they were afraid of the Jews they were
[43:05] afraid of the Jews that's the reason
[43:06] they closed the door probably barred
[43:08] them and locked them he goes on to say
[43:11] there they hid themselves because
[43:13] they're afraid of the Jews Jesus didn't
[43:16] tell them go to the upper room he just
[43:18] said wait in Jerusalem now if they were
[43:20] down here in the house say on the
[43:24] first floor somewhere hard to tell what
[43:25] would take place they'd come in and get
[43:28] them so they went into a little old room
[43:30] in the upstairs way up there in the
[43:32] attic and there barred the room down so
[43:34] the Jews couldn't get to them and they
[43:36] sat there waiting for 10 days quite a
[43:39] different picture
[43:41] and he says now all right we'll go to
[43:43] Acts 2 now and start reading a little
[43:45] bit Acts 2 and 1. and when the day of
[43:47] Pentecost was fully come they were all
[43:50] in one Accord in one place
[43:52] suddenly there came a sound from Heaven
[43:54] as a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled
[43:56] all the house where they were sitting
[43:58] and there appeared unto them cloven
[44:00] tongues now the of course the King James
[44:02] says Club in tongues but the original
[44:04] Greek emphatic dialogue says divided
[44:08] tongues and we'll speak a little bit
[44:09] more of that in a minute
[44:10] clothing tongues are divided tons like
[44:13] of a fire like as a fire and it's sat
[44:16] upon them or the original says rested on
[44:18] them each one of them so first we have
[44:21] now we have the sound from heaven and
[44:24] then they're appeared unto them these
[44:26] cloven tongues like as a fire and then
[44:28] it rested on each one of them okay now
[44:31] what happens next
[44:34] and Acts 2 and 4 and they were all
[44:36] filled with the Holy Ghost and began to
[44:38] speak with other tongues as the spirit
[44:40] gave them utterance now this Acts 2 and
[44:43] 4 the Brotherhood goes to his early
[44:45] Ministry you know talked about the
[44:46] Pentecostals and the one that's in the
[44:48] UPC and all I mean they just quote Acts
[44:50] 2 and 4 Mishawaka Acts 2 and 4 Acts 2
[44:52] and 4 Acts 2 and 4. now this is really
[44:54] the the Clincher you might say the most
[44:57] misunderstood verses of these scriptures
[45:00] and because the way it's worked as I
[45:03] said the Bible condenses its the
[45:05] scriptures and it doesn't say it it
[45:07] doesn't give the specific details as of
[45:10] time spans lapse between uh secrets of
[45:14] Advance is this a sequential of men or
[45:16] did something else happen in between
[45:18] this see there's lots of there's lots of
[45:20] variables in there that's why you know
[45:22] it takes especially a higher day word
[45:25] Prophet to tell us what these things
[45:26] happen and we're thankful that a word
[45:28] Prophet is a Divine interpreter of the
[45:30] word we're just we're just blessed to
[45:32] have that amen
[45:34] okay and they were all filled with the
[45:37] Holy Ghost and began to speak in other
[45:39] tongues as the spirit gave them
[45:40] utterance now watch the prophet of God
[45:42] brother man says these tongues were like
[45:45] these tongues were in the room like fire
[45:47] and it said on each they were filled
[45:50] with the Holy Ghost second thing and
[45:51] then after they were filled with the
[45:53] Holy Ghost notice after they were filled
[45:56] with the Holy Ghost after they were
[45:58] filled with the Holy Ghost they spake
[46:00] with tongues and then Brothers says not
[46:02] with tongues with languages did you
[46:05] notice that they began to speak with
[46:07] other languages now as the spirit gave
[46:11] them utter now and this was noise abroad
[46:14] now of course I have a copy of the
[46:16] dialogue another man said ever a
[46:18] preacher ought to have a dialogue
[46:19] because this is really this is New
[46:20] Testament and this is actual Greek word
[46:22] for word of course now we don't read
[46:24] Greek but they actually put it in the
[46:26] flowing language so we could understand
[46:27] it but it's not an interpretation it's
[46:29] it's just actually word by word what was
[46:31] said so the actual original rendering as
[46:35] I spoke in other languages now it's not
[46:38] incorrect it's not the King James is not
[46:40] incorrect but it doesn't give you a real
[46:44] clear understanding because of the way
[46:47] it's been interpreted down through the
[46:49] Pentecostal Revival they spoke in
[46:51] tongues instead of languages okay so as
[46:55] we begin to see some things here oh
[46:57] unfolding they speak they began to speak
[47:00] with other languages as the spirit gave
[47:02] them to uttering now this now this was
[47:04] noised abroad okay they speak they were
[47:08] filled the Holy Ghost and then
[47:11] it says you know and then they began to
[47:14] speak with other tongues and the spirit
[47:16] gave upris it says and this was noisy
[47:18] brought now it sounds like this just
[47:19] happened boom boom boom just like that
[47:21] but we find out that's really not
[47:23] actually what happened
[47:25] this this is just I mean I've known this
[47:29] for a time but studying out I just I was
[47:31] so glad that I studied out to really see
[47:33] and understand and and to be able to
[47:37] bring it to all of us really what
[47:38] happened now we don't have a lot of
[47:41] these issues in the message because
[47:43] tongues interpretation getting people
[47:45] giving tongues interpretation you know
[47:47] during service or you know even in order
[47:49] because
[47:51] I know people don't like to hear this
[47:53] but that's not the season and it's not
[47:54] the season for because let's face it
[47:56] there are like Brother band was a
[47:58] discipline sanctions he believed in
[47:59] changing the dispensations I mean God
[48:01] with this has a pillar fire above us uh
[48:04] God uh above us rather the pillar fire
[48:08] God With Us Jesus Christ God in us the
[48:10] Holy Spirit the last 2000 years so and
[48:13] and like the healing Revival the healing
[48:15] Revival we still believe in Divine
[48:18] Healing but this is not this season of
[48:20] the healing Revival it's actually
[48:21] changed after the opening of the seals
[48:23] it's changed with dispensation God don't
[48:25] deal with them organizations anymore as
[48:27] a whole but he deals with the bride he
[48:29] called the bride out that's where he's
[48:30] dealing so we we understand that God uh
[48:33] changes discipline say there are seasons
[48:35] so and president said just putting this
[48:38] in him he said anyone that speaks with
[48:40] the unknown tongue now see this is where
[48:43] the Pentecostals come from anyone speaks
[48:45] with an unknown tongue upon receiving
[48:47] the Holy Ghost does it contrary to the
[48:49] Bible it's not unknown known they knew
[48:52] what they were saying as we'll get to
[48:54] I'm going to show you in a few minutes
[48:55] and I'll prove to you I believe in
[48:57] speaking in unknown tongues but not
[48:59] receiving the Holy Ghost that's a gift
[49:02] of the Holy Ghost now in Acts 2 and 5.
[49:05] now look at let's look at verse 5. and
[49:07] there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews
[49:10] devout men out of ever
[49:12] Nation Under heaven now we begin to
[49:15] understand a little bit of the
[49:16] explanation
[49:18] now let's look at verse 6. this one's I
[49:21] really really like verse six this is
[49:23] very very interesting to me just
[49:25] tremendous
[49:26] now when this was noised abroad
[49:30] first of all we asked what was noise
[49:31] abroad number what was okay we had a
[49:34] mighty Russian wind a sound from Heaven
[49:36] as a mighty Russian Pillar of Fire came
[49:38] down broke itself up in the licks of
[49:39] fire then they were filled with the Holy
[49:41] Ghost then it says and then they this
[49:43] was noisy bro now what was noised abroad
[49:46] now that's the question now the Bible
[49:48] does it say it does not explicitly say
[49:50] what was noise abroad
[49:53] we didn't know that what the prophet of
[49:56] God does know
[49:58] I love it and this and when this was
[50:01] noise abroad the multitude came together
[50:03] now they were they were not assembled
[50:06] together before this happened said but
[50:09] after this was noise abroad the
[50:11] multitude came together and were
[50:13] confounded because that every man heard
[50:15] them speak in their own language so
[50:17] something stirred something happened and
[50:20] the multitude gathered together now what
[50:23] stirred them what what what brought this
[50:25] multitude together
[50:26] and this is just really really important
[50:30] when and and the question is this is
[50:33] really an important verse when when was
[50:36] this noise abroad
[50:39] now the big question is what was noise
[50:41] abroad and what were they saying
[50:45] now after this was noise umbrella then
[50:48] the multitude came together now I'm
[50:50] going to read verse 6 out of the dag law
[50:52] now you I want you I guess they'll have
[50:54] it on the board in the um but in the
[50:57] King James as we just read it now when
[50:59] this was noise abroad the multitude came
[51:01] together and we're confounded because
[51:02] that every man heard them speak in their
[51:05] own language but notice the way it's
[51:06] actually in the original Greek it's the
[51:08] same understanding just much clearer it
[51:11] says verse 6 and this report having been
[51:14] circulated that's the original wording
[51:16] and this report having been circulated
[51:19] the multitude came together and were
[51:22] perplexed because every one heard them
[51:25] speaking in their own language
[51:28] and when this report having been
[51:30] circulated so they were in the upper
[51:33] room filled with the Holy Ghost
[51:36] fire came they saw the fire licks if I
[51:39] arrested on each one of them fill the
[51:40] Holy Ghost then they begin to speak in
[51:43] other tongues language but we want to
[51:45] find out when did this happen before we
[51:48] get to that only a prophet could tell us
[51:50] what did they say what if I what did
[51:53] they say brother man says the question
[51:55] answers now I want to ask you something
[51:56] when was this rumor started remember
[52:00] after this was noise abroad okay he says
[52:03] when was this rumor started they called
[52:04] it a rumor you know if they had to come
[52:07] out of the upper room and go down them
[52:09] steps and get out into the palace course
[52:10] or into the temple courts rather which
[52:12] was probably a city block from where
[52:14] they were at upstairs and down out into
[52:17] the courts where all the people were
[52:19] gathered together and when they come out
[52:20] of their drunken like on the spirit for
[52:23] the people said these men are full of
[52:25] full of new wine they've never seen
[52:28] anything like it now in this get this
[52:30] picture okay they're coming out of the
[52:32] upper room they come down this stairwell
[52:33] from the outside and they begin to I
[52:37] guess mingle if you will because it has
[52:40] drawn a crowd of people
[52:42] we want to well what were they saying
[52:46] brother that tells us what they're
[52:48] saying and each one was trying to say
[52:51] the Holy Spirit has come the promise of
[52:54] God has come upon me I've been filled
[52:57] with the spirit so you can imagine how
[52:59] these guys These Guys these brothers and
[53:01] sisters 120 in the upper room how they
[53:03] were so excited because he said go you
[53:06] up in the city of Jerusalem and Terry
[53:07] and tell you being dude with power they
[53:09] didn't know what he was really talking
[53:11] about what is this power that they're
[53:13] supposed to receive so now they receive
[53:15] the Holy Ghost they come out of the
[53:16] upper room and they're now what are they
[53:18] doing they're actually testifying of
[53:21] what actually happened in the upper room
[53:23] because they said look I've been I've
[53:25] seen I've received the Holy Ghost I've
[53:26] been filled with the Holy Ghost I've
[53:28] been endued with power the Holy Ghost
[53:31] has come upon me of the Holy Ghost has
[53:33] come in me uh the promise of God is upon
[53:36] me I've been filled with this spirit
[53:38] can you imagine how they felt that time
[53:41] no wonder they acted like they acted you
[53:44] can understand why they acted the way
[53:46] they did this was a this was a brand new
[53:49] transformation they didn't know anything
[53:51] about about this this was the the first
[53:54] time ever that God had taken up
[53:56] resonance in the human heart before as
[54:00] we just said it was God above us and it
[54:02] was God With Us when Jesus Christ walked
[54:05] the streets of Galilee and so forth but
[54:06] now it's that same God that same fire
[54:09] that same Holy Ghost which was a pillar
[54:11] fire broke up in licks of fire which was
[54:13] anointing of God the life of God the
[54:15] presence of God the very God himself
[54:18] that same God has now taken up resonance
[54:21] in the human heart the first time ever
[54:23] no wonder they was excited about it no
[54:26] wonder they was and and and and the
[54:28] multitudes they were perplexed because
[54:30] they didn't they never seen anybody act
[54:32] like that
[54:33] now I don't know you know it's not for
[54:34] me to to decide if they were just you
[54:36] know staggering around like a drunk man
[54:39] you know and you know just like like
[54:41] they just you know I don't know it
[54:42] doesn't really matter but one thing for
[54:44] sure we know this because it was such an
[54:47] unusual thing that happened to them just
[54:49] if they were just running up to somebody
[54:51] brother this is what happened to me this
[54:52] is what happened to me God gave us the
[54:54] Holy Ghost the spirit of God is to come
[54:56] upon me you would act strange just doing
[54:58] that much of it you know so it doesn't
[55:01] really matter what if they were drunk or
[55:03] staggering or just so excited about what
[55:05] happened they thought it was drunk
[55:07] that's that's what they thought because
[55:08] we never seen anything like this
[55:11] that's that's one thing for sure they
[55:14] were they were trying to express and
[55:15] tell everyone you know just what they
[55:18] experienced and what did they experience
[55:20] they actually experienced the nature
[55:22] change they got a change of nature they
[55:24] were now filled with the Holy Ghost now
[55:26] that that same power that uh that that
[55:29] same power that they were to receive was
[55:31] a neighborhood a nature change and they
[55:33] went up into the upper room and waited
[55:34] there for 10 days and shut the door
[55:36] because they were afraid of the Jews
[55:38] they came out of the upper room with a
[55:40] brand new power a new nature a new
[55:42] revelation a new realization that the
[55:45] the spirit that the spirit of that same
[55:47] man Jesus Christ that they crucified is
[55:50] now living inside of my soul it was a
[55:52] change it was a nature change it was a a
[55:54] real experience brother it had nothing
[55:57] to do with emotion it had nothing to do
[55:59] with Sensations had nothing to do with
[56:01] any of these uh of feelings and and and
[56:06] and vocalists vocal sensation or
[56:09] anything is we'll get to if you had
[56:10] nothing to do with that it was a total
[56:12] nature change something they'd never
[56:15] experienced before
[56:17] amen that's no wonder they act as
[56:20] strange amen and brother man said you
[56:24] will too when you get a nature change
[56:25] don't if you could take the nature of a
[56:28] of a of a lamb and put it into a pig
[56:30] he's gonna act different too if he
[56:32] changes nature when you we get a nature
[56:34] change we do act different that's why
[56:36] because we're a brand new creation we're
[56:39] all together new different
[56:41] yeah
[56:42] now again don't miss these happenings
[56:45] first sound from heaven like a Russian
[56:47] Mighty Wind And probably this that sound
[56:50] from heaven like a Russian might even
[56:51] probably was the same sound that brother
[56:53] remember you know he had dramatized many
[56:55] times when that pillar fire would would
[56:57] whirl around him and he did
[56:59] blow on the microphone like that
[57:01] probably the same cell same Pillar of
[57:03] Fire Flame Holy Ghost
[57:04] and there appeared into them divided
[57:06] tongues like unto fire notice what
[57:08] brother M says again
[57:10] he says didn't it uh did anyone out here
[57:14] ever see Cecil the Mill's Ten
[57:15] Commandments did you notice the
[57:16] Commandments when they're written he
[57:18] caught that I did know there was two or
[57:20] three things I seen that I really like
[57:22] first thing it was that Emerald light
[57:24] that yellow green light that's exactly
[57:26] what it looked like and another thing
[57:28] was the command was written and after it
[57:30] was over did you notice flying away from
[57:32] that big pillar fire there was little
[57:34] Elixir fire flying away did you notice
[57:37] that now that's what I think this was at
[57:40] Pentecost there appeared unto them so
[57:42] they could so so they could see it it
[57:45] didn't say it fell on them but it
[57:47] appeared unto them and it rested upon
[57:49] them they actually saw those little
[57:51] licks of Fire
[57:52] how long ago is breaking up they
[57:54] actually saw those licks of fire and it
[57:56] sat upon each one of them rested on each
[57:58] one of them they was all filled with the
[57:59] Holy Ghost and
[58:01] began to speak with other languages that
[58:03] the spirit gave utterance now now let's
[58:06] look this yeah Acts 2 and 4 again when
[58:09] they were spilled with the Holy Ghost
[58:10] and began to speak with other tongues
[58:11] that the spirit gave utterance now
[58:14] I want to ask you a question how much
[58:16] time
[58:18] you think elapsed between the time that
[58:20] they were filled with the Holy Ghost
[58:22] and the time that they began to speak
[58:24] with other languages
[58:25] immediately
[58:27] five minutes ten minutes half hour how
[58:30] much time the Bible doesn't say
[58:34] but the prophet of God tells us
[58:37] not in minutes but he gives us a little
[58:39] understanding
[58:42] now he goes on to say here and I listen
[58:44] I really like this next quote
[58:46] this is this is very very good to the
[58:49] understanding very essential now listen
[58:52] let me read here before the question of
[58:54] the next coming brother I'm actually I'm
[58:56] going to read this he actually reads it
[58:58] out of this book lexicon it's actually a
[59:00] footnote and I'm going to read the
[59:02] footnote that he actually reads and
[59:03] question answers on the Holy Ghost
[59:05] and the footnote is it says it is
[59:08] difficult to determine whether it was
[59:10] the voice of those people speaking in a
[59:12] foreign language or the reporter rumor
[59:15] of the transaction of the supernatural
[59:18] wind rushing that excited the crowd now
[59:21] we don't know which one it was
[59:23] but they couldn't understand it now
[59:25] watch whether the brother man says
[59:27] whether it was the people I'll just
[59:28] illustrate now here's illustrating what
[59:31] happened here's a bunch of poor ragged
[59:33] galileans 120 of them okay and they were
[59:37] all out there in the street now they
[59:39] come out of the upper room they never
[59:41] seen anything like it their hands up in
[59:43] the air come from that upper room down
[59:46] the steps out into there just filled and
[59:50] he goes on to say they had never spoke
[59:52] yet
[59:53] I wish I
[59:54] had up on the screen so you could see it
[59:56] I mean he's either they come out of the
[59:58] upper room so I'm asking how much time
[1:00:01] was elapsed not important how much time
[1:00:03] was elapsing minutes but you have to
[1:00:05] understand and separate the sequence of
[1:00:07] what happens
[1:00:09] they were filled with the Holy Ghost up
[1:00:10] there they came out of the upper room
[1:00:12] then something was known as broad with
[1:00:15] it was the wind or the or what they were
[1:00:17] testifying about that Drew the crowd and
[1:00:19] they said after they came out of that
[1:00:21] room then they began to speak in other
[1:00:23] languages he said they come down the
[1:00:25] steps out into there just filled never
[1:00:27] had spoke yet see here they come down
[1:00:30] through there and now let's just say
[1:00:32] they was out there stagging around this
[1:00:33] and the people said a Greek Runner run
[1:00:36] up to me say I speak you gotta land you
[1:00:38] know what I'm saying now what's the
[1:00:39] matter with you boy but I like the way
[1:00:41] he you know he uh dramatizes that he
[1:00:43] said I've been filled with the Holy
[1:00:45] Ghost the power of God has felt up there
[1:00:46] in the upper room something happened to
[1:00:48] me oh glory to God and one over here and
[1:00:51] he was talking in Arab and him a
[1:00:53] Galilean said up in Arab in Arab
[1:00:56] language now they can't tell was it the
[1:00:58] Russian wind that drawed the people
[1:01:00] together when the multitude come
[1:01:02] together or was it the speaking in the
[1:01:04] foreign language that they were speaking
[1:01:06] now the Bible doesn't exactly say he
[1:01:07] said you've got two things here to watch
[1:01:09] The Outsider said how is it that we hear
[1:01:13] every man in our own language we're in
[1:01:14] we were born it did not say they were
[1:01:17] speaking it they didn't say that 120
[1:01:19] were speaking it they just said we are
[1:01:20] hearing it
[1:01:22] but they were hearing it now
[1:01:25] you believe like I believe I believe
[1:01:27] what the prophet of God said so we
[1:01:29] understand that they come out of the
[1:01:31] upper room then they begin to speak
[1:01:33] another tongues or other languages as
[1:01:35] they come out testifying as we just read
[1:01:37] the quote before testifying what God had
[1:01:39] done in the upper room
[1:01:42] change their nature given them the Holy
[1:01:44] Spirit Christ now dwelling in the heart
[1:01:46] of human beings
[1:01:47] so we find out now that they never spoke
[1:01:50] other languages in the room but after
[1:01:52] they come outside they came outside all
[1:01:55] speaking Galilee and testifying of what
[1:01:58] they had just experienced inside now
[1:02:00] they were 17 different dialects we call
[1:02:03] up different nations represented there
[1:02:05] all 120 Believers speaking the same
[1:02:08] gotta Lynn the Apostle the disciples and
[1:02:11] then the others that went up there Mary
[1:02:12] was with them also men and women now
[1:02:16] they wasn't preaching because there's
[1:02:17] women up there they were testifying they
[1:02:19] were testifying of what God had just
[1:02:22] done
[1:02:23] as I said they weren't preaching this
[1:02:25] testified and they were testified of the
[1:02:28] works of God now it read it it's right
[1:02:31] there in the Bible let's look at Acts 2
[1:02:33] and 9.
[1:02:34] parthians and put it on the board
[1:02:36] parthians and medes and elamites and the
[1:02:38] Dwellers of Mesopotamia and Judea and
[1:02:41] Cappadocia and Pontius and Asia and
[1:02:43] frigia and and pamphilia in Egypt and
[1:02:46] all the parts of Libya about Cyrene and
[1:02:49] strangers of Rome Jews and proselytes I
[1:02:52] love this leavened verse cretes and
[1:02:54] Arabians we do hear them speak in our
[1:02:57] own talk now what did they hear the
[1:03:00] wonderful works of God
[1:03:02] the wonderful works of God now he's
[1:03:04] telling them what what were they hearing
[1:03:07] they were the the 120 was testify of
[1:03:10] what happened up there which was the
[1:03:12] wonderful works of God which you shall
[1:03:14] be endowed with power and we'll get to
[1:03:16] the second one what is this power
[1:03:18] but he said you're going to be in new
[1:03:20] power and he and and as we read the
[1:03:22] quote brother man said they're not those
[1:03:24] 11 disciples were not fit to preach
[1:03:26] until they received this power
[1:03:28] I mean look at Peter before Pentecost
[1:03:31] look at Peter after Pentecost a
[1:03:33] different man changed
[1:03:35] all together changed oh it's a beautiful
[1:03:37] picture 17 different languages
[1:03:40] Representatives 17 different and they
[1:03:43] were understanding perfectly them
[1:03:44] speaking Galilean
[1:03:46] there's your Miracle of Pentecost
[1:03:48] there's your Miracle of Pentecost they
[1:03:51] were speaking Galilean and every one of
[1:03:53] them was understanding in in medes and
[1:03:56] Persians and Mesopotamian all the
[1:03:59] different nations represented under the
[1:04:01] known world at times they were here to
[1:04:03] him speak
[1:04:04] in Galilean but understanding in their
[1:04:06] lone language
[1:04:09] a miracle that's the miracle of
[1:04:12] Pentecost A great miracle one of the
[1:04:14] greatest Miracles that's ever happened
[1:04:17] and acts in Acts 2 and 7 and they were
[1:04:20] all amazed and marveled and you can see
[1:04:23] why they marveled saying behold are not
[1:04:25] all of these 120 or not all these
[1:04:28] galileans and how is it we understand
[1:04:30] I'm from I'm from Mesopotamia I'm from
[1:04:33] Crete I'm from here there in Yonder but
[1:04:35] I'm not of Galilean but from my native
[1:04:38] language I'm understanding what they're
[1:04:39] saying uh A great miracle A great
[1:04:43] miracle
[1:04:45] brother man says
[1:04:47] he says now how here we ever met our own
[1:04:50] language we're in we were born
[1:04:52] how here we not an unknown tongue how
[1:04:55] here we every man and the tongue where
[1:04:57] we were born not all of these were
[1:04:59] speaking are not all these speaking
[1:05:01] galileans
[1:05:03] um and was perhaps speaking Galilean but
[1:05:05] when they heard it it was in a language
[1:05:07] that they were born in if any brothers
[1:05:10] going to ask the question now if not so
[1:05:12] I want to ask you a question how and
[1:05:14] this is really I never really thought
[1:05:16] about this a lot myself okay Peter gets
[1:05:18] up after that and preaches his sermon
[1:05:20] and brother man says how was it that
[1:05:22] Peter got up and spoke in Galilean and a
[1:05:25] whole bunch heard what he was saying
[1:05:27] three thousand Souls came to Christ
[1:05:30] right there and Peter's speaking in one
[1:05:32] language sure it was God performing a
[1:05:35] miracle like I said part of that 3000
[1:05:38] was saved from different places from
[1:05:40] around the world all speaking a
[1:05:42] different language but they were all
[1:05:44] understanding Galilean
[1:05:47] uh oh what what a beautiful beautiful
[1:05:49] picture it wasn't speaking in an unknown
[1:05:52] tongue it was speaking in a it was
[1:05:55] speaking in a unknown language which
[1:05:57] Galilean would have been unknown to the
[1:06:00] the uh the creatures in the different
[1:06:02] languages but God miraculously made it
[1:06:05] he was their interpreter it was I would
[1:06:07] say this probably the the the only great
[1:06:09] Mass interpretation that ever took place
[1:06:11] around the world at one time
[1:06:13] 17 different dialects uh you know the
[1:06:17] 3000 was saved on the you know on that
[1:06:19] same date and they all heard him speak
[1:06:21] one language 17 different languages
[1:06:23] there that was you talk about a a a a
[1:06:26] mass interpretation
[1:06:28] amen now when I say that you know what
[1:06:31] I'm talking about like when when we go
[1:06:33] to preach and we go down to uh wherever
[1:06:35] we go you know like if we go down to uh
[1:06:38] you know if I would make a sentence you
[1:06:40] know in English and brother remember
[1:06:41] like in brown boat and Bombay you know
[1:06:43] I'd have 10 or 12 different dialects and
[1:06:45] he'd speak you know a phrase in English
[1:06:47] and then the first one we he would uh uh
[1:06:50] interpret it in one dialect and the next
[1:06:53] one would interpreting it in his dialect
[1:06:54] and go right on down you know it take
[1:06:56] them three hours to preach a 30-minute
[1:06:59] sermon you know because you have to go
[1:07:00] for the East dialect you know
[1:07:02] just like if you know if I was saying
[1:07:05] you know in English we go to the house
[1:07:07] in Spanish to be vomitos a la casa and
[1:07:09] if I was French it'd be dealing you know
[1:07:11] whatever French is and you know all of
[1:07:13] this but see but they heard it in their
[1:07:16] own language but they were speaking
[1:07:18] Galilean or we would say English amen
[1:07:22] just uh oh it's just beautiful when like
[1:07:25] when I was in Africa and I would be
[1:07:26] speaking in English you know an
[1:07:28] interpreter he was uh translating into
[1:07:30] Swahili I had no clue what he was
[1:07:32] talking about he could have been told
[1:07:33] and I was a a false prophet for all that
[1:07:36] matter of you know but I didn't know
[1:07:38] what he I don't know Swahili but he was
[1:07:40] thinking what I said and interpret it to
[1:07:42] the people that's what exactly God did
[1:07:44] on the day of Pentecost he he he
[1:07:46] interpreted the Galilean language to
[1:07:49] everyone there that was gathered
[1:07:51] together no wonder they were perplexed
[1:07:53] and wonder what does all this mean
[1:07:55] now as Jesus said go to Jerusalem and
[1:08:00] Terry and and he we're going to talk
[1:08:02] just a little bit about that power and
[1:08:03] then we're going to answer a couple of
[1:08:04] questions so in Acts 1 uh down let's
[1:08:09] read let's go to acts 1 and read four
[1:08:11] five verses here he says now the former
[1:08:13] treaty I have made o theopolis of all
[1:08:15] that Jesus began to do and teach until
[1:08:19] the day of which he was taken up after
[1:08:20] that through the Holy Ghost was given
[1:08:21] Commandments unto the apostles whom he
[1:08:23] had chosen to whom also he showed
[1:08:25] himself alive after his passion that's
[1:08:27] now that word passion actually means his
[1:08:29] sufferings by many infallible proofs now
[1:08:32] this is too loud turn this down I don't
[1:08:34] want anybody to be you know I hope it's
[1:08:36] not too loud
[1:08:37] by many infallible proofs uh being seen
[1:08:41] them of 40 days and speaking of the
[1:08:42] things pertaining to the kingdom
[1:08:44] speaking of things pertaining to the
[1:08:45] kingdom of God verse 4 and being
[1:08:47] assembled together with them commanding
[1:08:49] them that they should not depart from
[1:08:50] Jerusalem but wait for the promise of
[1:08:52] the Father which said he ye have heard
[1:08:55] of me now this is Jesus own words verse
[1:08:58] 5 for John truly baptized the water but
[1:09:00] ye shall be baptized now this is what
[1:09:02] Jesus said he said now Luke 24 49 you're
[1:09:04] going to receive power but look over
[1:09:06] here in Acts 1 and 4 Jesus same words he
[1:09:09] said for John truly baptized the order
[1:09:11] but ye shall be baptized with the Holy
[1:09:14] Ghost so he's telling them what this
[1:09:17] power is he didn't tell them in Luke 24
[1:09:19] 49 you said go up there you're going to
[1:09:21] be endued with power but here he said
[1:09:23] you're going to be baptized with the
[1:09:24] Holy Ghost not many days since of course
[1:09:27] Jesus knew it would only be 10 days he
[1:09:29] knew that but they didn't know that
[1:09:31] and verse six and when they and when
[1:09:34] they therefore were come together they
[1:09:36] asked him saying Lord will thou at this
[1:09:38] time restore the kingdom and he said to
[1:09:39] them it's not
[1:09:40] it is not for you to know the times and
[1:09:43] the seasons we're talking about Seasons
[1:09:45] before which the father had put in his
[1:09:47] own power but ye shall receive power now
[1:09:50] he's going to say repeat what he said
[1:09:52] you shall receive power after after the
[1:09:55] Holy Ghost has to come upon you and ye
[1:09:58] shall be Witnesses now see what we just
[1:10:00] said just they came out of the upper
[1:10:02] room what were they doing they were
[1:10:04] witnessing you shall be Witnesses and
[1:10:06] this is really interesting why he said
[1:10:08] this you shall be Witnesses unto me both
[1:10:11] in Jerusalem and all of Judea and
[1:10:14] Samaria and to the uttermost parts of
[1:10:16] the earth and why did he word it that
[1:10:18] way and divide it down into three
[1:10:20] because his brother teaches us that's
[1:10:22] the three different groups you've got
[1:10:24] your Jews Jerusalem that was the Jews
[1:10:26] Judea and Samaria that's the Samaritans
[1:10:28] and to the other most parts of the earth
[1:10:30] I said Gentiles so there's your three
[1:10:32] races right there verse nine and when he
[1:10:35] had spoken these things while they
[1:10:37] beheld he was taken up and received uh
[1:10:39] out of their sight so so what did he say
[1:10:42] when Jesus said they would after they
[1:10:44] received the Holy Ghost they would
[1:10:46] receive the ghosts receive the Holy
[1:10:49] Ghost excuse me and they would be
[1:10:51] Witnesses and they all what did 120 do
[1:10:54] after they received the Holy Ghost and
[1:10:56] came out of the upper room they began to
[1:10:57] witness and they witnessed what had just
[1:10:59] happened now as we said earlier before
[1:11:02] they went into the upper room they was
[1:11:04] scared of the Jews but you know what
[1:11:05] they got a nature days when they come
[1:11:07] out of the upper room the Jews were
[1:11:09] scared of them it's all together
[1:11:11] different the Jews was afraid of them
[1:11:13] they had a they had a different boldness
[1:11:15] they had something that entered in them
[1:11:17] they wasn't the same people and that's
[1:11:19] the same thing is when we received the
[1:11:22] Life of Christ the token the very Life
[1:11:23] of Christ we're different we're
[1:11:25] different person we don't we're not
[1:11:27] ashamed we're not worried we're not
[1:11:29] confounded we're not we're not confused
[1:11:31] we know where we're standing I know my
[1:11:33] redeemer liveth you know so then what is
[1:11:37] this power uh to be Witnesses your your
[1:11:40] life is a witness your speech is a
[1:11:42] witness your dress is a witness your
[1:11:45] actions is a witness your desires is
[1:11:47] with everything has changed about us
[1:11:49] that's how we witness we don't have to
[1:11:51] be preachers your life is a witness
[1:11:53] and you receive power to overcome you
[1:11:55] see a power to resist temptation to
[1:11:58] sustain do you receive power to to
[1:12:01] believe and if you receive power to be
[1:12:03] able to receive the word of God I mean
[1:12:04] of course we know God put that Gene in
[1:12:06] you before the foundation of the world
[1:12:08] but once that light strikes that and
[1:12:10] that Gene has actually been uh activated
[1:12:12] if you will you know it was dormant
[1:12:14] before but now it's come to life now
[1:12:16] you're a different person all together
[1:12:18] different
[1:12:19] oh brother man says the baptism of the
[1:12:22] Holy Ghost is a personal experience
[1:12:24] he said I've seen people speak in
[1:12:26] tongues I've seen witches Wizards and
[1:12:28] any Visionary knows that that's ever
[1:12:29] dealt with witchcrafts and Devils I've
[1:12:31] seen them stand and speak in tongues and
[1:12:32] throw dirt over their back cut
[1:12:34] themselves with the Lance and speak in
[1:12:35] tongues interpreted you say that's the
[1:12:37] Holy Ghost certainly isn't that's the
[1:12:39] devil Jesus Never Said by tongues you
[1:12:41] should know them but by their fruit you
[1:12:43] know she'll know them and what is the
[1:12:45] fruit love joy peace long-suffering
[1:12:47] jonest pieces of uh faith and Temperance
[1:12:50] and so forth and brother man said uh
[1:12:53] this is getting into another part of it
[1:12:55] I really want to get to you might speak
[1:12:57] with tongues and you might not in other
[1:12:59] words when you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:13:00] you might speak with don't you might not
[1:13:02] he said you might dance you might not
[1:13:04] you might shout you might not but it's
[1:13:06] one thing you will do you will bear the
[1:13:08] fruit of the spirit because it's the
[1:13:10] Life of Christ
[1:13:11] this is what brother man said you might
[1:13:13] speak in tongues and you might not but
[1:13:14] why did the Pentecostals do such a
[1:13:16] horrible thing
[1:13:18] talk about what was a horrible thing
[1:13:20] when they took that in denominator and
[1:13:22] said you got to speak an unknown tongue
[1:13:24] as evidence initial evidence you receive
[1:13:26] the Holy Ghost why did they do that
[1:13:28] horrible thing why did Pentecostal do
[1:13:30] that because in the beginning when God
[1:13:32] began to restore back Yonder 40 years
[1:13:35] ago bringing back the gifts someone
[1:13:37] began to speak in tongues and speaking
[1:13:39] in tongues is the least gift
[1:13:42] right according to Paul's teaching and
[1:13:45] of the entire bunch of gifts the least
[1:13:47] of all the gifts is speaking in tongues
[1:13:49] and as soon as they did it they all got
[1:13:51] excited and made a denomination to go
[1:13:53] out of it and called it the general
[1:13:54] counsel and the prophet God said that's
[1:13:56] where they died right there when they
[1:13:58] made a dime and they said okay this is
[1:13:59] what you got to believe you've got to be
[1:14:01] one God three person speak in tongues
[1:14:03] and initial evidence the Holy Ghost we
[1:14:04] believe this period don't put a period
[1:14:06] right over put it in the Articles of
[1:14:08] faith if you don't believe this you're
[1:14:10] not going to Rapture so to speak you
[1:14:12] know but they made an organization out
[1:14:14] of it but the man said if they would
[1:14:15] have put a comma and said we believe
[1:14:18] this plus everything that God will uh
[1:14:20] will reveal to us of course those two
[1:14:23] doctors I just quoted to you are not
[1:14:24] correct to begin with but you know it's
[1:14:26] got to be a further Revelation this is
[1:14:28] an unfolding revelation
[1:14:31] interesting speaking in tongues is the
[1:14:33] least of all the gifts The General
[1:14:34] Counsel of the Pentecostal declared is
[1:14:37] speaking in tongues was initial evidence
[1:14:38] and and it's a lease of the gifts it's
[1:14:41] the least of the gifts they said now
[1:14:43] you've got to do it but that's the least
[1:14:44] of the gift the whole denomination of
[1:14:46] Pentecostal Christian made it a man-made
[1:14:49] Doctrine if you might that you must
[1:14:50] speak in tongues are an unknown tongue
[1:14:53] as initial evidence of receiving a Holy
[1:14:55] Ghost and they all lack revelation
[1:14:58] they all lack Revelation thank God he
[1:15:00] sent us a prophet now let me ask you a
[1:15:03] question we know speaking in tongues is
[1:15:05] the least of all the gifts where are we
[1:15:07] today okay first pull second pull third
[1:15:11] pool we all know this
[1:15:13] third pool okay brother man preaches
[1:15:16] Christ the mystery he looks up at the
[1:15:17] the clock over there it's two o'clock he
[1:15:20] said I just happened to look up at the
[1:15:21] clock he said it's two o'clock the
[1:15:23] ending of the second pool the third pull
[1:15:25] is at hand
[1:15:26] 1963. so we know we're in the third pool
[1:15:28] we don't have to preach on that saw been
[1:15:31] the evidence we understand so the first
[1:15:33] pull is so we know that the first pool
[1:15:36] was the least of the three pulls
[1:15:38] speaking in tongues was the least of the
[1:15:41] gifts
[1:15:43] all right we got nine spiritual gifts
[1:15:47] we've got three pulls nine spiritual
[1:15:49] gifts so since the gift of tongues is at
[1:15:53] the bottom I ask you a question if the
[1:15:55] tongue is on the bottom which gifts are
[1:15:57] on the top
[1:16:00] um
[1:16:01] that's why I want to begin to understand
[1:16:04] a little bit of this first Corinthians
[1:16:06] 12 and 4. now there's the verses yes now
[1:16:08] we're going to read these nine spiritual
[1:16:10] gifts as we all know them but I want you
[1:16:12] to notice as he said speaking in tongues
[1:16:13] is a lease of yes as the way it's
[1:16:15] recorded
[1:16:16] and he knew what he was talking about he
[1:16:19] said now verse First Corinthians 12 and
[1:16:21] 8 4 to 1 is given the spirit of the word
[1:16:24] of wisdom one
[1:16:26] another word of knowledge two to another
[1:16:28] Faith three as by the spirit to another
[1:16:32] Gifts of healing for
[1:16:34] to another working of Miracles five to
[1:16:36] another prophecy six and and to another
[1:16:39] Discerning of spirit seven another
[1:16:41] diverse kinds of tongues eight and
[1:16:43] interpretation of tongues nine there's
[1:16:45] your nine spiritual gifts tongues
[1:16:47] interpretation recorded at the bottom so
[1:16:50] we find these we've got nine spiritual
[1:16:52] gifts we got three pools so what's this
[1:16:54] the bottom seven eight nine Discerning
[1:16:56] us Spirits tongues interpretation of
[1:16:58] tongues now we know that Tom's
[1:17:00] interpretation or have to go together
[1:17:01] and that's the reason we know that
[1:17:03] tongues most being the last in their and
[1:17:06] they are actually listed right together
[1:17:08] because they have to be together Tong's
[1:17:10] interpretation going that's the way it
[1:17:11] said in into the Bible and a lot can be
[1:17:14] said about tongues and brother man said
[1:17:16] after after the seals brother man said
[1:17:18] one of my uh one one Thorn and I that's
[1:17:21] the way he said it he said one Thorn I
[1:17:23] have in the flesh is what I'm trying to
[1:17:25] preach and somebody will stand up while
[1:17:27] I'm preaching and give a message in
[1:17:30] tongues and then give it even if they
[1:17:31] give the interpretation to us he said
[1:17:33] that's always a been a thorn in my face
[1:17:34] she said because it's out of order he
[1:17:36] said God is not the altar of confusion
[1:17:39] if they you know you've got to wait till
[1:17:40] the end of the service you know and they
[1:17:42] did it many times its own even on tape
[1:17:44] but he said God's not the author of
[1:17:46] confusion he's got one train Authority
[1:17:48] go one Focus you've got to stay with
[1:17:50] that Focus until the end of the surface
[1:17:51] that man will be the proper time the
[1:17:54] spirit of the prophets is subject to the
[1:17:55] prophets
[1:17:56] said hold your hold if you have the urge
[1:17:59] to speak in tongues that you hold and if
[1:18:01] there's no interpreter don't speak and
[1:18:03] oh we could get into that but we're not
[1:18:05] going that direction today so the second
[1:18:07] pull if you want to and this isn't tight
[1:18:09] now it's not you know I'm I'm showing
[1:18:11] you a type we got nine gifts we've got
[1:18:13] three pulls so if speaking in tongues
[1:18:16] interpretations the least of the is the
[1:18:18] least of the gifts and we know that the
[1:18:20] first pull is the least of the three
[1:18:22] pulls because we're in the third pool
[1:18:23] now it's very very obvious type here so
[1:18:26] what would be the second pull healing
[1:18:28] Miracles and prophecy so then what it's
[1:18:30] at the top that's where we are at and
[1:18:32] this it's so beautiful why we can
[1:18:34] regulate what is at the top what is the
[1:18:36] what is the anointing for our day what
[1:18:38] is the focus for our day what is this uh
[1:18:41] what is this uh season that we're in
[1:18:44] right now it's wisdom knowledge not
[1:18:48] worldly knowledge Godly knowledge and
[1:18:50] faith and faith is a revelation those
[1:18:53] are the three top gifts there's your
[1:18:55] type of the third pull
[1:18:57] faith is a revelation now let's just
[1:19:00] look at this just a little bit and we'll
[1:19:01] go to another question we want to answer
[1:19:03] wisdom knowledge and Faith put very
[1:19:06] simple what what is wisdom I'm just
[1:19:07] going to give you a simple explanation
[1:19:09] of this wisdom is a special ability to
[1:19:12] understand and apply doctrinal truths of
[1:19:15] life just very simply put that's wisdom
[1:19:17] what's knowledge Godly knowledge that's
[1:19:19] special insight
[1:19:21] and possessing and understanding
[1:19:24] doctrinal truths and faith is a
[1:19:27] revelation and that's a special ability
[1:19:29] to receive and believe doctrinal truth
[1:19:32] just a very a very simple explanation of
[1:19:34] wisdom knowledge and faith and Faith of
[1:19:36] the Revelation and since the spirit of
[1:19:38] wisdom is come back into the church and
[1:19:40] we could go and we preached a whole
[1:19:42] message on Statue of a perfect man then
[1:19:44] after you got and he said Spirit the
[1:19:46] spirit of wisdom is come back into the
[1:19:48] church because that's the anointing for
[1:19:50] our day he said now you can know how to
[1:19:53] add to your faith these Seven Virtues I
[1:19:55] add the faith virtue of knowledge
[1:19:57] Temperance patience goddess and
[1:19:58] brotherly kindness and charity what is
[1:20:00] it then it's the statue of a perfect man
[1:20:02] only can come in this day statue of a
[1:20:05] perfect man because the perfect word has
[1:20:07] come we understand what age we're living
[1:20:08] in third pool Ministry
[1:20:11] right God God is building a house all
[1:20:13] the way from the feet up to the arms all
[1:20:16] the way up through and look at that just
[1:20:18] in a minute God's building a house a
[1:20:20] house of Flesh I'm the house that God
[1:20:22] lives in
[1:20:23] that's what God's Building is a
[1:20:25] tabernacle he could live in for six
[1:20:26] thousand years since the fall God has
[1:20:28] desired that he could come back and have
[1:20:30] perfect Fellowship live inside a human
[1:20:33] being live inside his children you know
[1:20:35] with the fullness of the word that they
[1:20:37] could have the full word not partial
[1:20:39] word but have a full revelation of the
[1:20:42] of the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ
[1:20:45] what is the Capstone Revelation all
[1:20:47] these wonderful truths God could God
[1:20:49] could now be pleased to take up
[1:20:50] residence residence inside the believer
[1:20:53] after the full word has come
[1:20:56] amen
[1:20:58] now
[1:21:00] brother remember what did Brother man
[1:21:02] say about the gifts in his order I'm
[1:21:04] going to read a couple of quotes about
[1:21:05] that he said the gifts are here
[1:21:09] but as I said this morning we hold so
[1:21:11] much on speaking in tongues in
[1:21:13] interpretation he said now watch it he
[1:21:15] said speak it in tongues that's the last
[1:21:17] and the least of the gifts and notice
[1:21:20] what he says here he said the first gift
[1:21:22] was wisdom the second gift was knowledge
[1:21:25] and what good is it for you to have
[1:21:27] knowledge if you haven't got a wisdom
[1:21:29] know how to take care of your knowledge
[1:21:31] I mean you know that's very Elementary
[1:21:33] but it's very important
[1:21:35] you know if you don't have wisdom to be
[1:21:37] able to understand what knowledge you
[1:21:40] have you know what what good is it going
[1:21:42] to be to you
[1:21:43] that's why I said the spirit of wisdom
[1:21:45] has come back into the church
[1:21:47] amen
[1:21:49] uh wisdom to take care of your knowledge
[1:21:51] what goes it to speak in tongues if you
[1:21:53] if you haven't got wisdom to know when
[1:21:55] and how to place it see that's where the
[1:21:58] Pentecostals failed they didn't have
[1:21:59] wisdom to know where and how to place it
[1:22:01] and even what the focus was and even
[1:22:03] what happened on the day of Pentecost
[1:22:04] they didn't understand
[1:22:08] thank God for truth thank God for true
[1:22:11] now here's another look at this this is
[1:22:14] tremendous I mean the whole Pentecostal
[1:22:16] charismatic Apostolic the whole emphasis
[1:22:18] is on speaking in tongues interpret
[1:22:20] every service is still back to the
[1:22:22] Pentecost Revival tongues interpretation
[1:22:24] tongues interpretation I mean that was
[1:22:27] good for his day but that's not the
[1:22:28] season today
[1:22:30] it's still it's still we believe it's
[1:22:32] just like Luther's message the just
[1:22:33] shall live by faith we believe that just
[1:22:35] shall live by faith but that's not the
[1:22:37] emphasis or the focus today
[1:22:39] listen what brother M said this
[1:22:41] tremendous statement he said the
[1:22:43] greatest of all the gifts is wisdom that
[1:22:45] pretty much settles it right there don't
[1:22:47] it the greatest of all the gifts is
[1:22:49] wisdom the second is knowledge and again
[1:22:52] if you haven't got wisdom then to
[1:22:54] control your knowledge what good is your
[1:22:55] knowledge going to do see what I mean
[1:22:57] seek the first things first
[1:23:00] now and we could even talk about this
[1:23:02] scripture but we're not going to go into
[1:23:03] it even the Bible in Revelation 13 18
[1:23:06] says here is wisdom to him that wisdom
[1:23:08] not to him count the number of the Beast
[1:23:10] the denomination of people they don't
[1:23:12] know what who the be the Beast is
[1:23:13] they're in the very beastly system and
[1:23:15] don't even understand it don't realize
[1:23:17] it but he that has wisdom the bride has
[1:23:20] wisdom let him count the number because
[1:23:22] we know Revelation 17 the the
[1:23:25] mystery Babylon her daughter's the
[1:23:27] denominator we know these things why
[1:23:30] wisdoms come back into the church
[1:23:32] sense of focus on the third third pool
[1:23:35] not the first pull not the second pull
[1:23:37] but the third pull I can show you I can
[1:23:39] show you this is really interesting
[1:23:40] brother man said one place he said I can
[1:23:43] show you he said one day I'll tell you I
[1:23:45] don't know if he ever did actually but
[1:23:46] he said one day I'll tell you the first
[1:23:48] and second pull was not the perfect will
[1:23:50] of God it's only the permissive will of
[1:23:52] God the third pull was really the
[1:23:54] perfect will of God he said how could he
[1:23:56] say that well I'm not really Liberty to
[1:23:57] explain that but I can say this when God
[1:24:00] actually created Adam and Eve in their
[1:24:02] form the perfect will of God for
[1:24:04] children come by Spoken Word not
[1:24:06] bisexual desire that was perfect will
[1:24:08] but he permitted the permissive will you
[1:24:11] know because he actually had attributes
[1:24:12] of being a healing or Savior and
[1:24:14] Redeemer to come he had he he had those
[1:24:16] attributes those attributes had to be
[1:24:18] displayed but he said his perfect will
[1:24:20] was spoken word children he said Isaiah
[1:24:22] should have come through the womb of
[1:24:24] Mary
[1:24:25] that's what he said Isaiah it said all
[1:24:27] of us should have come through the womb
[1:24:28] of Mary by a spoken word but his
[1:24:31] permissive will God permitted because he
[1:24:33] had to display this attributes so you
[1:24:35] know why why this was you know we
[1:24:37] understand
[1:24:39] we're thankful for that now brother man
[1:24:42] said tongues interpretations earned his
[1:24:44] spirits was the least of the gifts so we
[1:24:46] know that wisdom knowledge and faith is
[1:24:50] the top three gifts
[1:24:51] we're thankful for that so it gives us a
[1:24:53] little understanding where are we today
[1:24:55] I mean what's the focus today Revelation
[1:24:58] faith is a revelation brother then said
[1:25:00] Above All Things pray for revelation
[1:25:03] sure amen just a few more minutes and
[1:25:06] the spirit of wisdom come to the church
[1:25:07] to brother man said the spirit of wisdom
[1:25:09] comes into the church to make known to
[1:25:11] the church by the revelation of the Holy
[1:25:13] Spirit bringing the church in and
[1:25:15] revealing what day that we're living in
[1:25:17] so why is it important the spirit of
[1:25:18] wisdom come to the church know what they
[1:25:20] were living in so we'll understand the
[1:25:22] focus what is the focus today amen so
[1:25:25] and he says uh like Daniel said the Holy
[1:25:28] Spirit come to the church in the last
[1:25:29] day to reveal these great deep secret
[1:25:31] things aren't you glad about that and
[1:25:34] you know when as I said before when you
[1:25:36] read through the Bible and said the
[1:25:37] mystery of this uh the mystery of God
[1:25:39] should be finished it's I think it's 23
[1:25:43] times in the Bible the word mystery is
[1:25:45] actually mentioned every time the word
[1:25:48] mystery is mentioned in the in the King
[1:25:49] James in the Bible in the New Testament
[1:25:51] it's not even the Old Testament at all
[1:25:53] but in the New Testament of all 23 times
[1:25:55] and 24 times the word mystery actually
[1:25:58] in this in the emphatic diaglo is the
[1:26:01] word Secret
[1:26:02] The Secret of God the sacred of God the
[1:26:04] sacred of God the Seeker of God the only
[1:26:06] place that's actually mystery is
[1:26:07] Revelation 17 where it says mystery
[1:26:09] Babylon actually uses the word mystery
[1:26:11] but every other place in the Bible where
[1:26:13] it says mystery the original Greek is
[1:26:15] secret so it's actually God's secrets to
[1:26:18] his bride not everybody knows it it's
[1:26:20] not for everybody God Only God only to
[1:26:24] Whispers his secrets to his bride to his
[1:26:27] wife his chosen is elected brother man
[1:26:29] said another place not all these
[1:26:31] flirters only to his bride
[1:26:34] now I want to I want to cover this and
[1:26:36] then we'll we will we will stop very
[1:26:39] interesting statement brother bam says
[1:26:42] about receiving the genuine Holy Ghost
[1:26:45] without sensation
[1:26:50] very simple it's very simple you know
[1:26:53] when you study it out it's very simple
[1:26:56] as I said the Pentecostal believe you
[1:26:58] got to speak in tongue upon receiving
[1:26:59] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that we
[1:27:00] know the prophet of this age said that
[1:27:03] one of the Mysteries was to receive the
[1:27:05] genuine baptism Holy Ghost without
[1:27:06] sensation
[1:27:08] without sensation without sensation now
[1:27:11] first of all if people would take time
[1:27:12] to just to look up the definition of
[1:27:14] sensation you know they would have a
[1:27:16] little more understanding
[1:27:18] so I looked it up let me tell you what
[1:27:21] it means it's really amazing it's
[1:27:23] amazing the word sensation comes from
[1:27:26] the word sensate
[1:27:28] now what does the word sensate mean
[1:27:31] look it up in the dictionary the word
[1:27:33] sense8 means what registering on the
[1:27:38] senses are felt by the senses
[1:27:41] sense8 registered on the senses are felt
[1:27:45] by the senses okay it's felt by the
[1:27:47] senses what's a sense
[1:27:49] what is your senses
[1:27:52] five on this body five on the spirit or
[1:27:55] five on the body rather you got five
[1:27:57] others on the spirit on your second
[1:27:59] realm there what does this is what's the
[1:28:01] definition of a sense you'll like this
[1:28:03] one the ability of the brain and nerves
[1:28:06] to react to Impressions from the five
[1:28:09] faculties of the body which is see taste
[1:28:11] feel smelling here
[1:28:13] it's right there so what is what is the
[1:28:16] win what does the word sense8 mean what
[1:28:17] does it come from it's a it's actually a
[1:28:20] ability of the brain and Earth to react
[1:28:22] to impressions in other words it's it's
[1:28:24] red it's registering in your brain
[1:28:27] something coming from your five senses
[1:28:30] that's what Sensei means
[1:28:33] so then what is what is the word
[1:28:34] sensation actually mean the process of
[1:28:37] receiving conscience
[1:28:39] sense Impressions through direct
[1:28:41] stimulation of the sense organs which
[1:28:43] are C taste feel smell and hear so if
[1:28:46] you can receive the genuine Holy Ghost
[1:28:48] without see taste spill field smelling
[1:28:50] here guess what that's without sensation
[1:28:54] now look at this look at this so then we
[1:28:57] receive the Holy Ghost without any
[1:28:59] conscience sense impressions of sea
[1:29:02] taste fill spelling here when you get
[1:29:04] when you receive the Holy Ghost you
[1:29:05] didn't it's not that you felt it I
[1:29:07] assist it all that all that might come
[1:29:10] but that's that's not what that's not
[1:29:13] what you're relying on that's at the
[1:29:15] Pentecostal they rely on speaking in
[1:29:17] tongues you've got to speak in tongue
[1:29:18] that's not it you know shouting jerking
[1:29:22] uh back in the healing of hours all in
[1:29:25] the forehead blood in the hands and this
[1:29:27] and that all these Sensations it's not
[1:29:30] it's not scriptural
[1:29:32] and it has nothing to do with receiving
[1:29:34] the genuine Holy Ghost
[1:29:37] so wow that's really deep in it
[1:29:40] so how to receive the Holy Ghost how to
[1:29:43] receive the genuine Holy Ghost by
[1:29:45] Revelation by Revelation he said
[1:29:48] Revelation it's a it's a personal
[1:29:50] revelation of God revealing himself to
[1:29:52] you you accepting that that revelation
[1:29:55] of who Christ is into your soul
[1:29:57] acceptance believe in it obeying it God
[1:30:00] seals you with the Holy Ghost them that
[1:30:02] obey and that's why he said go up to the
[1:30:04] city of Jerusalem and Terry when they
[1:30:06] fully obeyed after 10 days then they
[1:30:08] were endued with power so we God gives
[1:30:11] the Holy Ghost to them that obey so it's
[1:30:13] not an emotion it's Christ personally
[1:30:15] revealed to you it's not a feeling it's
[1:30:18] not a sensation but the person of Christ
[1:30:20] taking up residence inside the soul of
[1:30:22] man
[1:30:23] has nothing to do with Sensations
[1:30:27] now somebody tell me I'm asking you a
[1:30:29] very simple question we got 10 senses
[1:30:32] senses five on the body see tastes feel
[1:30:36] smell here five on the spirit realm
[1:30:38] conscience imagination reason infection
[1:30:40] memory
[1:30:42] and then you got one on your soul which
[1:30:44] is Free Will which is Faith or doubt
[1:30:47] okay five on the body five on the spirit
[1:30:50] now
[1:30:53] as I said you got one on the soul Faith
[1:30:55] or death now we've got these ten senses
[1:30:57] and the people said well you know he
[1:30:59] says Hey brother I'm saying you receive
[1:31:01] the Holy Ghost without sensation
[1:31:03] is there any sense on your soul as far
[1:31:06] as what we just read the definition of
[1:31:08] sense or sensation or sense of not on
[1:31:11] your soul on your soul all there is
[1:31:12] there is no there is no senses on your
[1:31:15] soul it's just faith
[1:31:17] free moral Age of Faith to receive or
[1:31:19] faith to to to not receive but there are
[1:31:22] no senses on your soul the senses are on
[1:31:24] your body and and those senses that
[1:31:27] contact the Earthly home on our spirit
[1:31:28] realm that's why brother man said you
[1:31:30] can receive you can have the genuine
[1:31:32] holy ghost on your spirit realm and
[1:31:34] still not be saved why because it's got
[1:31:37] his brother Sean been preaching the last
[1:31:39] four or five Services it's got to be on
[1:31:41] your soul it's down where the soul is
[1:31:44] and a lot of the a lot of the the
[1:31:46] Pentecostal Brothers especially the
[1:31:47] old-timers they just have a hard time
[1:31:49] accepting in fact you did not get a word
[1:31:52] birth back in Pentecost you can't get a
[1:31:54] word birth until the full word is come I
[1:31:56] don't care how much you spoke in tongues
[1:31:58] and prophesied and had dreams and all
[1:32:00] these wonderful things that's fine and
[1:32:02] damning but that's not evidence of the
[1:32:03] Holy Ghost brother Ben said when you can
[1:32:05] receive the word and you can obey the
[1:32:08] word receive you've got a receiver you
[1:32:10] got representation God had to put that
[1:32:13] representation in there before you could
[1:32:14] ever receive the word
[1:32:16] and if you don't have it you can't
[1:32:18] receive it and you can't make somebody
[1:32:20] receive it it's got It's either there
[1:32:22] it's not there we don't know who who
[1:32:24] isn't who is it but God knows but it but
[1:32:26] that receiver that representation must
[1:32:29] be down in that soul
[1:32:32] so thank God we can receive the Holy
[1:32:34] Ghost without Sensations no there's no
[1:32:36] senses on your soul oh that's on the
[1:32:38] flesh
[1:32:39] oh thank are we glad for Revelation for
[1:32:42] truth
[1:32:43] so receiving the genuine holy ghost on
[1:32:46] your soul has nothing to do with those
[1:32:48] ten senses it's your soul it's all
[1:32:50] together your soul not feeling it's not
[1:32:52] sensation not emotions it's all faith
[1:32:55] faith faith revelation God by Revelation
[1:32:58] amen musicians you come on on I'll
[1:33:00] finish this up
[1:33:02] now I want to ask you this question this
[1:33:04] is actually uh not direct or related to
[1:33:07] what we're preaching but I just wanted
[1:33:08] to bring this in right before we close
[1:33:12] I thought it was very interesting when I
[1:33:14] I learned that
[1:33:16] I learned this why is our nation in such
[1:33:19] a mess well there's lots of answers but
[1:33:21] I want to give you one big answer why
[1:33:24] we're in such a mess
[1:33:25] brother man preaches a message a warning
[1:33:27] then judgment
[1:33:28] so he gives warning and after warning
[1:33:30] what's left
[1:33:32] okay
[1:33:34] why is there such a rapid deterioration
[1:33:36] even since 1956 he said I predict this
[1:33:39] year he'll they'll either receive or
[1:33:41] turn it down said I predict they'll turn
[1:33:43] it down they did
[1:33:44] and if you study even back in American
[1:33:46] history in the last since 56 there's
[1:33:48] been certainly a rapid deterioration
[1:33:50] starting at the in the 60s The Beatles
[1:33:52] and all the sexual Revolution all you
[1:33:55] talk about going downhill
[1:33:57] and it's even it's accelerating even
[1:34:00] more today we understand that
[1:34:02] why didn't this nation rally around that
[1:34:04] gift
[1:34:05] that's that Messiah sign that second
[1:34:07] pool why didn't they rally around that
[1:34:09] gift
[1:34:10] well somebody might say
[1:34:12] well the government didn't know it
[1:34:17] they knew it
[1:34:19] how many knows or when did Brother Brown
[1:34:22] preach the message deep calling to the
[1:34:23] Deep
[1:34:25] precedent in 1954 I think he preached it
[1:34:27] also in 56. we preached in 1954 and he
[1:34:31] actually priested in the Constitution
[1:34:33] Hall in Washington D.C
[1:34:35] and we know that demon shakiring who was
[1:34:38] head of the Christian businessman was at
[1:34:39] that meeting and there's somebody else
[1:34:41] that was at that meeting
[1:34:43] a real importance his name was Richard
[1:34:45] Nixon
[1:34:47] we know who Richard Nixon was 15 years
[1:34:49] later Richard Nixon become the 37th
[1:34:52] President of the United States
[1:34:54] Richard Nixon
[1:34:56] saw that Messiah sign Richard Nixon
[1:34:59] Nixon witnessed that second pull and saw
[1:35:02] that gift in operation
[1:35:05] why didn't he when he become president
[1:35:06] why didn't he at least try
[1:35:09] to bring that before the people said you
[1:35:12] know what I was in a meeting 15 years
[1:35:14] ago and I saw a man perform a messiah
[1:35:16] sign tell people the secrets of the
[1:35:18] heart you know what if I was president
[1:35:20] and I would be a believer I'd do this if
[1:35:23] I was President then and I saw that I'd
[1:35:25] have I'd say brother random I want you
[1:35:27] to have an office right next to mine
[1:35:29] here in the White House
[1:35:30] you can tell the secrets of what they're
[1:35:32] doing in their bed chamber of the enemy
[1:35:33] you know that would be a wonderful thing
[1:35:35] to have of course God God don't misuse
[1:35:38] his gift but I mean you'd sure feel like
[1:35:40] doing that you know but brother man said
[1:35:42] if they'd rallied around that gift we
[1:35:44] wouldn't need a hospital we wouldn't
[1:35:45] need an army we wouldn't need hardly
[1:35:47] anything if they'd rallied around that
[1:35:49] gift
[1:35:50] and the same thing happened with Israel
[1:35:52] and Israel would would go back into
[1:35:53] going into idolatry then their Nation
[1:35:56] would begin to deteriorate they'd lose
[1:35:58] battles and on and on and on until they
[1:36:00] repent and get back with God
[1:36:02] but the sad part of it is today this
[1:36:05] nation ain't going to get back to God
[1:36:07] curse has been put on it she ain't
[1:36:09] coming back but God has got a little
[1:36:11] bride
[1:36:12] where's your mind come on up God's got a
[1:36:14] little bride
[1:36:15] that's going to receive the word it's
[1:36:17] going to believe the word it's going to
[1:36:19] act on the word it's going to obey the
[1:36:21] word
[1:36:23] Hallelujah aren't you glad you got an
[1:36:26] ear to hear
[1:36:27] this this nation had opportunity to
[1:36:30] Rally around that gift it had
[1:36:31] opportunity the man was there he
[1:36:33] witnessed that Messiah sign
[1:36:37] but as I said would they received it
[1:36:40] probably not but at least he could have
[1:36:42] tried
[1:36:43] he could have tried
[1:36:45] but I'll tell you what Richard Nixon did
[1:36:47] do he did one of the greatest things for
[1:36:49] Israel in The Six Day War about in the
[1:36:52] third or fourth day Israel was losing
[1:36:54] the war they'd run out of Munitions
[1:36:55] they'd run out of and they were losing
[1:36:57] the battle and go to my ear she called
[1:37:00] Richard Nixon about three o'clock in the
[1:37:02] morning and said Mr President if you if
[1:37:04] you want to see Israel save we need help
[1:37:07] and we need it right now there's one
[1:37:09] thing he did and I hope he's rewarded
[1:37:11] for that Richard Nixon did for the land
[1:37:13] of Israel at first Nixon he hung up the
[1:37:17] phone he said I just let him bleed for a
[1:37:20] while
[1:37:20] then he got to thinking his old mom told
[1:37:24] him so now and his mother told him
[1:37:26] Richard one day one day you're going to
[1:37:29] have the opportunity to help Israel and
[1:37:31] when you do when you realize that you
[1:37:34] help Israel with all your mind and
[1:37:36] Richard Nixon remember that what his
[1:37:37] mother told him so you know what Richard
[1:37:39] Nixon did
[1:37:41] because they needed armed they needed
[1:37:43] tanks they needed Munitions they needed
[1:37:44] help Richard Nixon organized and what
[1:37:47] even the historians will say was the
[1:37:49] greatest airlift of Weaponry to Israel
[1:37:52] in just in two days time or less than
[1:37:54] that from the United States to Israel
[1:37:57] and they won the war that's what Richard
[1:37:59] Nixon did to help Israel thank God for
[1:38:02] that amen God bless you Saints let's
