[35:03] Sister Rebecca comes, he'll do it again
[35:08] for you. He'll do it again.
[35:16] Oh, just take a look at where you are
[35:21] now and where you've been.
[35:27] Hasn't he always come through for you?
[35:33] He's the same now as then.
[35:39] Oh, you may not know how. You may not
[35:43] know when. Oh, you may not know how. You
[35:48] may not know when. Oh, you may not know
[35:52] how. You may not know when, but you'll
[35:57] do it again.
[36:01] Amen. Are you thankful for that this
[36:03] morning? Amen.
[36:10] This is easy.
[36:20] [Music]
[36:44] I was just a child when I felt the
[36:48] Savior leading.
[36:51] I was drawn to what I could not
[36:55] understand.
[36:59] For the cause of Christ, I have spent my
[37:03] days believing
[37:06] that what he'd have me be is who I am.
[37:14] As I come to see the weaker side of me,
[37:19] [Music]
[37:22] I realize his grace is what I'll need.
[37:27] [Music]
[37:30] Send a million injustice
[37:33] for my soul.
[37:36] Mercy say
[37:39] I'm not going to let you go.
[37:43] I'm not going to let you slip away. You
[37:47] don't have to be afraid.
[37:51] Mercy said no.
[37:54] Sin will never take control.
[37:57] [Music]
[38:00] Life and death stood face to face.
[38:04] Darkness trying to steal my heart away.
[38:10] Thank you, Jesus.
[38:13] Mercy said no.
[38:18] For God so loved the world that he sent
[38:22] his son to save us.
[38:25] From the cross, he built a bridge to set
[38:30] us free.
[38:33] Oh, but deep within our hearts, there is
[38:37] still a war that rages
[38:40] and it makes a sacrifice
[38:44] so hard to see.
[38:48] But as midnight fell upon crucifixion
[38:52] day,
[38:55] the light of hope seemed all so far
[39:00] away.
[39:01] [Music]
[39:03] As evil tried to stop, redemptions flow.
[39:09] Mercy said, "No,
[39:13] I'm not going to let you go.
[39:17] I'm not going to let you slip away. You
[39:20] don't have to be afraid.
[39:24] Mercy said no.
[39:28] Sin will never take control.
[39:33] Life and death went face to face.
[39:37] Darkness tried to steal my heart away.
[39:44] Thank you, Jesus.
[39:46] Mercy said no.
[39:52] And now when heaven looks at me, it's
[39:56] through the blood of Jesus
[39:59] reminding me of one day long ago.
[40:04] [Music]
[40:09] Mercy said, "No,
[40:12] I'm not going to let you go.
[40:16] I'm not going to let you slip away. You
[40:20] don't have to be afraid.
[40:23] Mercy said no.
[40:27] Sin will never take control.
[40:32] Life and death face to face. Darkness
[40:37] tried to steal my heart. Oh,
[40:42] thank you Jesus.
[40:45] Mercy said no.
[40:49] [Music]
[40:52] Mercy said no.
[41:00] [Music]
[41:03] [Applause]
[41:06] [Music]
[41:08] Amen. Man, are you so glad that mercy
[41:10] said no? Amen. Can we just stand to our
[41:14] feet as we invite our pastor to come?

[44:34] house of the Lord. Good to have our
[44:36] visitors. God bless you all. Amen. And I

[45:07] passing the torch over to them. And uh
[45:10] so it's it's certainly good to uh see
[45:13] young people serving the Lord. Amen. And
[45:17] um
[45:18] um if you have your Bibles, uh we're
[45:21] going to turn to the book of
[45:23] Deuteronomy,
[45:25] the seventh chapter. And as it's been
[45:30] said, um good to have Sister Kim, Amen.
[45:34] Uh with us and back with us. And she
[45:38] just had knee surgery and uh uh but
[45:42] she's a trooper and just handling it
[45:44] really well. the Lord's just been with
[45:46] her to help her and and so we're we're
[45:48] really glad for that. And and Sister
[45:52] Martha, Amen. certainly good to see
[45:55] Sister Martha back with us and see that
[45:58] smile. Amen. and she's gone through a
[46:01] lot herself and um doctor has found a a
[46:06] tumor uh in her stomach and and uh so
[46:11] she was in the hospital for a few days
[46:13] and um doctors wanting to uh do a
[46:17] surgery on her u but uh they had called
[46:22] her and said that they would um they're
[46:24] wanting to put her on medication for I
[46:26] believe a couple weeks that it and and
[46:29] uh to try to reduce that size of tumor.
[46:33] And so she's uh the medication is
[46:36] supposed to arrive I believe sometime
[46:38] this week. And so we want to uh just
[46:41] keep her in our prayer and uh she's a
[46:44] trooper um a fighter and um um she
[46:49] hadn't Are you eating? Are you a little
[46:52] bit trying to eat? And so we want to
[46:56] just uh keep her in our prayer. Amen.
[46:59] And the Lord would be with her. Amen.
[47:02] And um I want to thank the Lord for
[47:04] keeping me safe. I uh um been traveling
[47:08] back and forth to the to the hospital
[47:10] and things and getting on that highway.
[47:13] And I had felt, you know, that I don't
[47:16] know, it just felt like my tire was
[47:18] going to come off. And um so I'd go
[47:22] real, you know, I'd say I was going
[47:24] slow. 60 65 on that highway. That was
[47:27] pretty slow. And um anyway, uh Friday I
[47:32] I visited Sister Jane and and I was
[47:35] backing out of her drive, got in the
[47:36] middle of the the road there, and the
[47:39] whole wheel assembly came off. And um
[47:43] and so I I really thank the Lord that it
[47:45] happened there instead of on the
[47:47] highway. And uh so God's grace was with
[47:50] us. and Daniel and Junior or uh Levi was
[47:55] pulling a trailer Thursday, using it all
[47:58] day uh to mow lawns and things. And then
[48:01] I get home Friday, you know, after that
[48:04] experience. And then Faith um said that
[48:08] her and a car sideswiped and and uh um
[48:13] uh kind of damaged the cars, but other
[48:15] than that, everybody was safe. So, I
[48:17] really thank the Lord um uh for keeping
[48:20] her and Ruth safe and the other
[48:23] gentlemen and um uh God is just good,
[48:28] you know, and and um I was telling
[48:30] brother Andrew uh the the story, you
[48:33] know, my tire falling off and he he as
[48:36] we were talking, he was listening to a
[48:37] sermon and brother Brown uh I wished I
[48:41] had the quote now, but he had said
[48:42] something to the fact that you never
[48:45] realize that the angels of God are with
[48:47] you till you get in your car and um and
[48:51] then he protects you. And something to
[48:53] that effect, I I I thought, you know,
[48:55] that's so true. It made it real that day
[48:59] &gt;&gt; uh more than ever that the angels of God
[49:01] are with us.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; And uh we we take our life for granted.
[49:04] We take every day for granted. But at
[49:07] the end of the day, when we lay our head
[49:10] on our pillow, we should always be
[49:12] thankful for the angels of God that
[49:14] protected us. Amen. And so, um, let's
[49:18] just bow our heads in a word of prayer
[49:21] before we go into the word. Father,
[49:24] truly you are, uh, our God. You have
[49:29] proven time and again that you're
[49:31] watching over us and that you care for
[49:33] us. Father, we go through things that
[49:36] maybe we don't even understand,
[49:40] but Father, you know, and by faith, we
[49:43] believe, Lord, that you're working
[49:45] everything out for our good.
[49:48] And Lord, as we approach this part of
[49:50] the service, I pray, Lord, that you
[49:53] would come in a special way. Father, I
[49:56] I'm I'm nothing. And Lord, but you're
[50:00] everything. And if you could just help
[50:02] me to lay myself aside and that you
[50:05] could speak through me, Lord, to your
[50:08] people, that's that's what matters.
[50:11] It that's that's all that that we are
[50:14] concerned about. And and if you would
[50:16] just uh anoint your people as well,
[50:19] Father, that they would be able to hear
[50:21] and to receive. And may you just give us
[50:25] a heart, Lord, uh more fervent and have
[50:30] a better resolve, Lord, to serve you,
[50:34] Lord, and and and to press on, Father.
[50:37] That's our desire, Father. Create within
[50:40] us that is lacking, Father. For we
[50:43] certainly want to reflect every promise
[50:47] uh that you have made for us in this
[50:49] hour. We ask it in your lovely name
[50:52] Jesus Christ. And the church says,
[50:56] "Amen." Now, we want to read here in
[50:59] Deuteronomy
[51:01] the um the seventh verse and going to
[51:05] start uh the or the seventh chapter.
[51:08] Start at the first verse. when the Lord
[51:11] thy God shall bring thee into the land
[51:15] whether thou goest to possess it, and
[51:18] hath cast out many nations before thee,
[51:20] the Hittites, the uh Gurgites,
[51:25] and the Amorites, and the Canaanites,
[51:28] Parizzites, Hivites, and the Jebusites,
[51:31] seven nations greater and mightier than
[51:34] thou. And when the Lord thy God shall
[51:38] deliver them before thee, thou shalt
[51:40] smite them, and utterly destroy them,
[51:45] thou shalt make no covenant with them,
[51:48] nor show mercy unto them. Neither shalt
[51:51] thou make marriages with them. Thy
[51:54] daughter thou shalt not give unto his
[51:57] son, nor his daughter shalt thou give
[52:01] unto thy son. for they will turn thee uh
[52:06] turn away thy son from following me that
[52:10] they may serve other gods. So will the
[52:13] anger of the Lord be kindled against you
[52:15] and destroy thee suddenly.
[52:18] But thus shall ye deal with them. You
[52:21] shall destroy their altars, break down
[52:23] their images, cut down their groves, and
[52:27] burn their graven images with fire. For
[52:30] thou art an holy people, unto the Lord
[52:34] thy God. The Lord thy God hath chosen
[52:36] thee to be a special people unto
[52:38] himself, above all people that are upon
[52:41] the face of the earth. The Lord did not
[52:44] set his love upon you, nor choose you
[52:47] because you were more in number than any
[52:49] people, for you were the fewest of all
[52:52] people, but because the Lord loved thee,
[52:56] and because he would keep an oath uh the
[52:59] oath which he had sworn unto your
[53:01] fathers, hath the Lord brought you out
[53:03] with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out
[53:06] of the house of bondman, and from the
[53:09] hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. Know
[53:12] therefore that the Lord thy God, he is
[53:14] the He is God, the faithful God, which
[53:17] keepeth covenant and mercy with them
[53:20] that love him and keep his co
[53:22] commandments to a thousand generations.
[53:27] Then if you'll turn with me, Romans the
[53:29] 12th chapter
[53:31] and we will just read the first two
[53:35] verses. It's a um scripture that is
[53:38] common
[53:41] to us. Um
[53:45] Romans the 12th chapter and starting at
[53:49] the uh first verse it says I beseech you
[53:52] therefore brethren by the mercies of God
[53:56] that you present your bodies a living
[53:58] sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[54:02] is your reasonable service and be not
[54:05] conformed to this world but be ye
[54:07] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[54:10] that you may prove prove what is that
[54:12] good and accept and perfect will of God.
[54:17] Amen. You can have your seats this
[54:21] morning.
[54:22] And I uh I want to continue on the
[54:26] subject holiness, a people separated
[54:29] unto the Lord. And we've u I guess I've
[54:32] spoke on this subject a couple times
[54:35] before here lately. And um I I pray that
[54:41] the Lord will help help me to uh speak
[54:44] what's on my heart. But um uh according
[54:48] to the Bible, the the path of every true
[54:51] believer is uh the way of holiness. Uh
[54:57] it's that's the path that a true
[54:59] believer walks. It's uh the Bible calls
[55:02] it the way of holiness. And and the
[55:06] Bible also says that without holiness no
[55:10] man shall see God.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; I don't think um holiness can be taught
[55:16] without teaching um that there has to be
[55:19] a separation.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Uh without separation there can be no
[55:24] holiness. For uh the word holiness it
[55:28] means a sacred place or thing
[55:32] consecrated,
[55:34] dedicated
[55:36] uh hallowed. Uh so again consecrated and
[55:41] and the word consecrate means to make or
[55:44] declare sacred to set apart.
[55:47] The word dedicate it means to set apart
[55:51] for a definite use to devote the worship
[55:54] of a uh to to to devote to the worship
[55:58] of a divine being. Lord
[56:00] &gt;&gt; the word sacred again to set apart holy.
[56:04] So, so these words um as I'd said last
[56:08] time the word devote, dedicate,
[56:11] consecrate, hallow, it means to set
[56:14] apart for a special and often higher
[56:18] end. Amen. And so this is what God was
[56:22] telling Israel, I've set you apart. Um I
[56:25] you are a holy people. I've created you
[56:28] for myself. And um and so God required a
[56:34] separation.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; We know that the second work of grace uh
[56:40] that was um is is sanctification.
[56:44] And the word sanctify it means to
[56:48] separate for the glory of God, cleansed
[56:52] and set aside for service.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; And so that that's the work that's the
[56:57] second work of grace. There's the the
[56:59] three works of grace and um and that's
[57:03] uh justification, sanctification, and
[57:06] the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; And and so John's Wesley's message was
[57:12] the message of sanctification.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Uh uh Luther's message of course was
[57:18] justification. And the prophet said that
[57:20] Luther, he had, you know, his message,
[57:23] the people had gotten so uh into that
[57:27] justification
[57:28] that they made grace a disgrace and
[57:32] allowing just anything. And so God had
[57:34] to straighten the church up with the the
[57:37] message of John Wesley
[57:40] &gt;&gt; and to bring a sanctification to the
[57:43] church to let them know that that it it
[57:46] was time. the church needed to live
[57:49] separate from from the world and and the
[57:52] things of the world. And so this was the
[57:55] work of the Holy Ghost. Ain't that
[57:56] right?
[57:57] &gt;&gt; But we find that they didn't come to a
[58:00] complete separation
[58:02] uh uh there. And uh brother Brandham
[58:06] would tell us he said there's not a
[58:08] church on earth that could live any more
[58:10] pure than the Nazarene and their
[58:12] teachings, the pilgrim holiness and and
[58:15] such. He said they absolutely believe in
[58:18] the purity of sanctification.
[58:20] Not even to their women wearing rings
[58:23] and anything. Purity and sanctification.
[58:27] Every way they believe it. The holiness
[58:30] organizations, all the legalists, that's
[58:33] their teaching. They believe it. Holy
[58:35] women wearing long hair and long skirts.
[58:39] Men ain't supposed to roll your sleeves
[58:42] up. And many of them see everything uh
[58:46] not even touch, smoke, drink, nothing of
[58:49] that. See, holy, you couldn't even you
[58:52] couldn't live any cleaner. But that same
[58:55] Nazarene church, if a man would speak in
[58:58] tongues in the church, he'd be shot out
[59:00] the door. See? And and and so they they
[59:03] said they wouldn't even set with one.
[59:05] See, now that's true. If you don't
[59:07] believe it, try it once. See? Find out.
[59:09] They hate the very thoughts of it. They
[59:12] say it's the devil. See? And so then we
[59:15] find that there there there's a a
[59:18] greater separation that God uh wants his
[59:22] church to. We thank God for the message
[59:24] of sanctification and and and and
[59:27] separating and and uh uh from from the
[59:31] worldly things, but that but there's a
[59:33] greater separation. And God demands
[59:36] total separation. Do you believe that?
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Total separation. And you know uh
[59:42] uh today a lot of people want to bring
[59:46] the world along with them as they tried
[59:49] to serve God. And and uh that that's
[59:52] what Abraham done as as we know that God
[59:56] commanded Abraham to separate himself uh
[1:00:00] get out of your country and and go to a
[1:00:02] place that I've called you. Leave your
[1:00:04] kindred. Leave everything behind. But
[1:00:06] Abraham brought his father along and he
[1:00:09] brought Lot his nephew along. Ain't that
[1:00:12] right? And and so uh uh he didn't fully
[1:00:16] separate as he came out just like Luther
[1:00:20] didn't fully separate. Amen. When he
[1:00:23] come out of the Catholic Church and
[1:00:25] Wesley didn't fully separate from what
[1:00:27] he came out of and Pentecost never fully
[1:00:31] separated what they came out of. And and
[1:00:34] so we find that God never fully uh
[1:00:38] blessed Abraham. Uh he never blessed
[1:00:41] Abraham until Abraham fully separated
[1:00:46] uh uh and himself and done what God told
[1:00:49] him to do. Ain't that right? So God
[1:00:53] always sets an example before us. uh the
[1:00:57] the the the the biblical uh stories uh
[1:01:01] uh are examples to us uh what what God
[1:01:05] wants of us or what he doesn't want of
[1:01:07] us. And and and so we we have uh
[1:01:11] examples to follow. And so, uh, he set
[1:01:15] Abraham, uh, the prophet said, as an
[1:01:18] example of a complete separation from
[1:01:22] all of his family, all of his kindred,
[1:01:24] and so forth to walk a life separated to
[1:01:28] God. Ain't that right? So, so it it's
[1:01:32] the separation is a separation to God.
[1:01:35] God wants us to be separated unto
[1:01:39] himself. Ain't that right? He's the one
[1:01:41] that called us. He's the one that chose
[1:01:43] us. He's the one that's got a purpose
[1:01:45] for us. He's the one that that that has
[1:01:48] a a uh a goal and a that he wants of of
[1:01:53] us. And and it's not our goal. It's not
[1:01:55] our purpose. It's not our desires. It's
[1:01:58] it's not what we want in life. It's what
[1:02:00] God predestinated from uh before the
[1:02:03] foundation of the world. It's his
[1:02:05] purpose that he's trying and wanting to
[1:02:07] work in in us as his church. Ain't that
[1:02:10] right? But he doesn't want us mingled
[1:02:13] and and and all the he wants us
[1:02:16] dedicated set aside for his service and
[1:02:20] his his alone. So the prophet said when
[1:02:23] God expects you to do a special thing he
[1:02:27] demands a complete separation from any
[1:02:31] doubt.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? From any doubt. Amen.
[1:02:34] See and and the prophet told us that
[1:02:37] we're channels. Amen. He He told us that
[1:02:40] we're we're we're like the conductors.
[1:02:42] Amen. And and we can either be a vessel
[1:02:46] unto unto Satan and let Satan just have
[1:02:49] his way with us and and and or we can be
[1:02:52] a vessel unto God. Amen. To where God
[1:02:55] can have his way with us. So if if God
[1:02:59] expects us to do a special thing, he
[1:03:02] demands a complete separation from any
[1:03:05] doubt. You've got to come to full
[1:03:08] obedience to obey what he says. God
[1:03:10] demands it. Everybody say, "God demands
[1:03:12] it." And you can't do it no other way.
[1:03:15] Ain't that right? Now, the my my reason
[1:03:18] for for this is I maybe just for the
[1:03:21] young people, I've been burdened for the
[1:03:23] young people and and and I I pray it can
[1:03:25] be of such a help as we as we go um uh
[1:03:30] uh some through the services here. I
[1:03:33] won't get it all today, but I I do want
[1:03:35] to talk about things and and so uh but
[1:03:38] just to lay a foundation. But brother
[1:03:40] Brandham would tell us you will never
[1:03:43] receive the fullness. Everybody say
[1:03:45] fullness. Now that that's that's what we
[1:03:48] want. We want to come into the fullness
[1:03:51] of the Holy Ghost. Ain't that right? Now
[1:03:54] I I thank God for what he done uh on on
[1:03:57] the day of Pentecost. I I I I I thank
[1:04:00] God for for what he done on the book in
[1:04:02] the book of Acts as as uh you know it it
[1:04:06] you you read the headline on the book of
[1:04:08] Acts, it's it says the uh uh the acts of
[1:04:11] the apostles and the prophet said it
[1:04:12] ain't the acts of the apostles, it's the
[1:04:14] acts of the Holy Spirit in the apostles.
[1:04:17] And and so what God done in that day is
[1:04:20] it was great. But I believe we've come
[1:04:23] to the place of the fullness of the Holy
[1:04:26] Ghost. Can you say amen? To where we've
[1:04:29] come to the adoption of sons. We've come
[1:04:32] to to where the fullness of God is
[1:04:36] manifested himself in the church. For we
[1:04:39] seen the revealing of the son of man in
[1:04:42] this age. How many believes that? Amen.
[1:04:45] See, and and the day of Pentecost was
[1:04:48] not Amen. the revealing of the son of
[1:04:50] man. Amen. Jesus never promised that. He
[1:04:53] said it would be in this day that the
[1:04:55] son of man would be revealed. Christ in
[1:04:58] his fullness would be revealed in this
[1:05:01] day. So then this would why I guess uh
[1:05:04] we could say that brother Brandham is
[1:05:06] telling us that you've got to come to
[1:05:09] full obedience because you'll never
[1:05:11] receive the Holy Ghost in the fullness.
[1:05:14] Amen. I I thank God for what he's done
[1:05:17] for me. I I truly thank God for uh
[1:05:20] filling me with the Holy Ghost and and
[1:05:22] and I I truly thank God for all the past
[1:05:26] experiences with him that I've had. But
[1:05:28] I believe there's more to be had. Amen.
[1:05:32] See, and so uh uh but you'll never
[1:05:34] receive the the Holy Ghost in the
[1:05:36] fullness. You'll never walk in the
[1:05:38] spirit of God until you totally separate
[1:05:42] your things from unbelief. Ain't that
[1:05:46] right? Amen. And we know unbelief uh
[1:05:49] unbelief is what questions God's word.
[1:05:52] Unbelief is what, you know, causes fear
[1:05:55] to strike our hearts and and to think
[1:05:57] that God just, you know, uh uh uh won't
[1:06:01] do what he said he would do and and and
[1:06:04] these things. So, separate your things
[1:06:06] from unbelief. Get away from the world.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, get away from the
[1:06:13] world. Come out of the world. See why?
[1:06:16] Because we'll never receive the Holy
[1:06:19] Ghost in its fullness until we do. Ain't
[1:06:23] that right? See, now God is a
[1:06:26] segregationist. Ain't that right? He's a
[1:06:29] segregationist. And and God even
[1:06:31] separates his nation. He separates his
[1:06:34] nations. He separates his people. Amen.
[1:06:37] and and he pulled the prophet said he
[1:06:40] pulled Israel that Jewish race out of
[1:06:42] every all the races in the world. He
[1:06:45] pulls that race out to be a special race
[1:06:49] unto himself out of all the races of uh
[1:06:52] and and the the nations of the world so
[1:06:56] God would pull them out dedicated for
[1:07:00] his glory. Ain't that right? Dedicated
[1:07:03] for his power. If God was going to show
[1:07:06] his supernatural power, it would be in
[1:07:08] that nation of Israel. If God was going
[1:07:10] to show himself to be real, it would be
[1:07:13] in that nation of Israel. God had
[1:07:16] separated that nation from amongst
[1:07:18] everyone else. Amen. And so the prophet
[1:07:22] says, "And the bride of Christ is
[1:07:24] segregated from the rest of the
[1:07:26] churches." And he's that that's exactly
[1:07:29] right. So all Christians, all
[1:07:32] Christians, every true Christian is a
[1:07:35] segregationist.
[1:07:36] Amen. Now man separates by the color of
[1:07:41] of of a man's skin. And he has brought
[1:07:44] segregation by the color of a man,
[1:07:47] black, white, brown, red, or yellow. And
[1:07:50] it's man that has caused the segregation
[1:07:53] between colors. It's man that has caused
[1:07:56] segregation between rich and poor. Man
[1:08:00] causes these kinds of things. But God
[1:08:02] does not segregate by color. He does not
[1:08:05] segregate by class. He does not
[1:08:08] segregate. Amen. That's man that does
[1:08:10] that. That's that's that's the evil
[1:08:12] things of of the devil. Ain't that
[1:08:14] right? But God does not segregate by
[1:08:17] color or class. But the prophet said he
[1:08:20] segregates by spirit. Amen. He doesn't
[1:08:23] want our uh uh uh uh have a defiled
[1:08:27] spirit hanging on us or a a filthy
[1:08:30] spirit or or whatever. A man's color
[1:08:33] skin has nothing to do with God. Amen.
[1:08:36] See, any man can be a child of God by a
[1:08:39] spiritual birth regardless of his skin
[1:08:41] color. How many believes that? See, and
[1:08:44] so then the prophet said, "God is a
[1:08:46] segregationalist,
[1:08:48] a filth between right and wrong." Amen.
[1:08:52] He's a segregationist. Amen. Between
[1:08:54] right and wrong, between good and evil,
[1:08:57] between uh filthy and un uh and and
[1:09:00] clean. Ain't that right? Amen. 2
[1:09:03] Corinthians 6:14.
[1:09:05] Uh uh the Bible says, "Be not unequally
[1:09:08] yolked together with unbelievers? For
[1:09:12] what fellowship hath righteousness with
[1:09:14] unrighteousness? And what communion hath
[1:09:17] light with darkness? And what concord
[1:09:20] hath Christ with bal? And or what part
[1:09:24] hath he that believeth with an infidel?
[1:09:27] See, and what agreement hath the temple
[1:09:29] of God with idols? For you are,
[1:09:32] everybody say, I am.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; I am. You are the temple of the living
[1:09:37] God. See? Amen. See, as God hath said, I
[1:09:42] will dwell in them, walk in them. I will
[1:09:46] be their God, and they shall be my
[1:09:48] people. Wherefore come out from among
[1:09:51] them, and be ye separate, saith the
[1:09:54] Lord, and touch not the unclean thing,
[1:09:57] and I will receive you, and will be a
[1:10:00] father unto you, and you shall be my
[1:10:02] sons and daughters, saith the Lord God
[1:10:06] Almighty. Ain't that right? So, we can
[1:10:08] see from this scripture that sons and
[1:10:10] daughters of God are the ones that are
[1:10:14] segregated. Amen. They're segregated.
[1:10:16] Brother Brown said, "You can't even be a
[1:10:18] Christian and be an integrationist." Uh
[1:10:21] uh that's a that's a big word,
[1:10:23] integrationist. Amen. In other words, if
[1:10:25] you don't if you don't segregate, you
[1:10:28] can't be a Christian. Amen. If if if you
[1:10:31] if you can't amen keep away from the
[1:10:34] world, then you can't be a Christian.
[1:10:36] Can you say amen? That's right. See, so
[1:10:39] then when we're segregated, the prophet
[1:10:41] said, is when we come out of the world.
[1:10:44] Amen. It's not classes of people. It's
[1:10:46] not color of people. It's not uh uh
[1:10:49] different races. When you come out from
[1:10:51] the world, then you're segregated. Amen.
[1:10:55] Unto God. Can you say amen?
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; That's right. See, and so it's like when
[1:10:59] God segregated or separated uh Israel
[1:11:03] from Egypt, as long as they were in
[1:11:06] Egypt, they were the people of God. But
[1:11:08] the prophet said when they come out of
[1:11:10] Egypt, they become the church of God.
[1:11:13] For church means called out ones. Ain't
[1:11:15] that right? How many's glad you're part
[1:11:16] of the church? Amen. You're you're part
[1:11:19] of the church because you you you're
[1:11:21] called out. You've been separated. Amen.
[1:11:24] And and so God doesn't want his children
[1:11:27] being mixed up with the world or the
[1:11:29] things of the world. Brother Bram said,
[1:11:32] "God expects you to disassociate
[1:11:34] yourself from all ungodly things." Amen.
[1:11:38] All ungodly things. And remember, the
[1:11:41] prophet preached a sermon, enticing
[1:11:43] spirits. This Amen. Satan isn't with a,
[1:11:46] you know, a little red demon with a
[1:11:48] pitchfork and horns and evil something.
[1:11:51] They're enticing. Amen. And it's
[1:11:53] something that is appealing. It's
[1:11:55] something that is attractive. Amen. So,
[1:11:58] you know, uh uh but but yet it's ungodly
[1:12:02] in its character. It's in ungodly in its
[1:12:05] intent. It's it's ungodly in its its
[1:12:09] motives. Ain't that right? Amen. See, so
[1:12:12] the church will always be called out.
[1:12:15] Amen. God doesn't call you out. Amen. uh
[1:12:19] from the drinking and the smoking and
[1:12:21] and and and then you come in and you
[1:12:23] start living something else. It uh and
[1:12:26] attaching to the world in other things
[1:12:28] and and and to where you just lay
[1:12:31] powerless in the church. God doesn't
[1:12:33] want a powerless church. Amen. The
[1:12:36] prophet said God hates a powerless
[1:12:38] religion. A ain't that right. See, and
[1:12:41] so then the church will always be
[1:12:44] segregated unto God and he is the word.
[1:12:48] Ain't that right? He is the word. Amen.
[1:12:51] Now, we know the prophet taught us and I
[1:12:53] again uh thank God for a prophet. Amen.
[1:12:56] To let us know these things that there
[1:12:58] is a carnal church and there is a
[1:13:00] spiritual church. Amen. There is a
[1:13:02] worldly church. That carnal church is a
[1:13:05] worldly church. Amen. And that that uh
[1:13:08] spiritual church is a is a a holy
[1:13:12] church. It's it's set apart for the
[1:13:15] purpose of God. Amen. And the prophet
[1:13:17] would tell us that the spiritual church
[1:13:19] is the elect lady. Ain't that right?
[1:13:22] It's the elect lady. And and and uh it's
[1:13:26] it's one lady that's been called out
[1:13:28] from all the other ladies. Amen. Amen.
[1:13:31] She's segregated. Amen. Just separated
[1:13:34] and she's a holy lady. Amen. A holy
[1:13:37] lady. If you ought to go listen to the
[1:13:39] uh invisible union of the bride of
[1:13:41] Christ. And brother Bram talks about it
[1:13:43] right at the beginning. Amen. that this
[1:13:45] lady that I'm talking to is an elect
[1:13:48] lady. Amen. She's been called out. She
[1:13:50] been pulled out. I ain't preaching to
[1:13:52] everybody else. He says, I'm preaching
[1:13:54] to that elect lady that's been called
[1:13:56] out of the out of the world among all
[1:13:58] the other ladies. See, and and Mary, she
[1:14:01] was elected. Amen. Uh uh uh by God to
[1:14:05] bring forth the body of God on the
[1:14:08] earth. Amen. That scripture was exactly
[1:14:11] for her. Amen. No other woman could
[1:14:14] fulfill that scriptures. Amen. Behold, a
[1:14:17] virgin shall conceive. Amen. God called
[1:14:20] her out among all the other women to for
[1:14:24] this scripture to fulfill the scripture.
[1:14:26] Ain't that right? When God laid that
[1:14:28] promise, behold, a virgin shall
[1:14:30] conceive, he had Mary in his mind. Amen.
[1:14:34] And it didn't matter what other women
[1:14:35] done. It didn't matter what whatever
[1:14:37] else. Amen. Mary didn't have to work for
[1:14:40] it. She didn't have to beg for it. is
[1:14:42] she was predestinated to it. Can you say
[1:14:46] amen? And there was no devil in hell
[1:14:48] going to stop it. Amen. And God prepared
[1:14:51] her heart to receive the promise. No
[1:14:54] matter how impossible it was, no matter
[1:14:56] how strange it was, she was
[1:14:59] predestinated to receive it. And she
[1:15:02] said, "Be it unto me according to thy
[1:15:04] word." Amen. Amen. So she wasn't mixed
[1:15:07] up with all the other religions as the
[1:15:10] prophet said that she even went to a
[1:15:11] church and her priest would tell them
[1:15:13] that God doesn't do miracles, amen, like
[1:15:16] he did back then. And but she couldn't
[1:15:18] she couldn't get mixed up in that. She
[1:15:20] couldn't let her heart receive that.
[1:15:22] Amen. She was a predestinated
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; seed of God to accept the promise for
[1:15:30] that age.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; And God has elected lady. God has an
[1:15:36] elected lady to be his bride. When he
[1:15:39] said there's going to be a bride without
[1:15:40] spot, wrinkle, or blemish, I can't help
[1:15:43] but believe I was in his mind. Hey, do
[1:15:46] you believe that you were in his mind?
[1:15:49] Amen. You don't have to work for it. You
[1:15:51] don't have to try it. You don't have to
[1:15:53] plead for it. Amen. It's just something
[1:15:55] that's been given to us. Amen.
[1:15:57] Pentecostal didn't help me. The doctrine
[1:16:00] didn't help me. Amen. But when I saw the
[1:16:03] message of the age, there was something
[1:16:06] that quickened in my heart. This is
[1:16:08] right. This is for me. I was
[1:16:10] predestinated for this time. God was
[1:16:14] separating me
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; for this time. Can you say amen? So, so
[1:16:19] the bride of Christ is an elected lady.
[1:16:22] She's been called out. There are
[1:16:23] promises that only will fit. Amen. For
[1:16:26] the bride of Christ. Amen. I I know and
[1:16:29] I've said it before, a lot of ministers,
[1:16:31] Amen, have gotten confused on this Bible
[1:16:33] and they have taken scriptures that does
[1:16:35] not pertain to the bride and they have
[1:16:38] worked and they beat the bride up. Amen.
[1:16:40] By by scriptures that don't that don't
[1:16:43] even pertain to the bride. Amen. Just
[1:16:46] like uh you know the Bible talks about a
[1:16:48] man that if he would uh commit an
[1:16:50] unpardonable sin, if he had blasphemed
[1:16:52] the Holy Ghost, his sin would never be
[1:16:55] forgiven. Amen. And they've used that
[1:16:57] scripture to put the bride into fear.
[1:17:00] Amen. Oh, I hope I don't blasphe. But
[1:17:02] then I read where the Bible says, amen,
[1:17:04] an elect of God cannot blasphe. Amen. So
[1:17:08] I don't have to worry about blasphe. I
[1:17:10] don't want to blaspheme. It's not my
[1:17:12] desire to blaspheme. I'm not here
[1:17:14] rejecting what God is doing. I'm here
[1:17:16] accepting what God is doing.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Amen. See, and so
[1:17:22] we find that that this elect lady. Amen.
[1:17:25] Now this carnal church is a worldly
[1:17:28] church. Yet she claims to be the bride
[1:17:31] of Christ. Brother Bram says, "Now if
[1:17:33] you'll see the conduct of women in the
[1:17:35] world today, watch the conduct of the
[1:17:38] worldly church today." Amen. Now, now
[1:17:40] think of that. When you see the worldly
[1:17:42] women and way they're acting and the way
[1:17:44] they doing things, look on the movies.
[1:17:47] Amen. And and the prophet really blasted
[1:17:49] that how they kiss and these actors are
[1:17:51] kissing one another. And he says they're
[1:17:53] committing adultery when they do that.
[1:17:55] Amen. And when they're dressing so
[1:17:57] sleazy and sexy and all that, he says
[1:18:00] remember there is a worldly church that
[1:18:03] is doing the same thing before God.
[1:18:05] Amen. See, and he said, "So the conduct
[1:18:08] of women in the world today," Amen.
[1:18:11] matches the conduct of the worldly
[1:18:13] church today. He said, "Notice this
[1:18:15] character. When you see women just go on
[1:18:18] the rampage, just do anything they want
[1:18:20] to watch. The church is doing the same
[1:18:23] thing. Ain't that right? Several times,
[1:18:26] Brother Brown says the church wants
[1:18:28] mixers. They want to mingle. They'll
[1:18:32] accept anything as holy. They accept
[1:18:34] anything as God in the name of the love
[1:18:37] of God. Ain't that right? God is love.
[1:18:40] So, we just accept everything and
[1:18:42] anything and everybody and and all of
[1:18:44] these things. Amen. The church wants
[1:18:47] mixers. They want a pastor who will not
[1:18:49] be so hard on them and tell them good
[1:18:51] things and not dig right down and just
[1:18:54] rake the hide off of them. In other
[1:18:56] places, he says the church is so carnal.
[1:18:58] It feeds itself on worldly a carry on.
[1:19:02] See dead things of the world just like
[1:19:04] the vulture does. Church politics. They
[1:19:07] don't even let the Holy Ghost send a man
[1:19:08] to a church. They have to have a
[1:19:10] politics to see if the denomination is
[1:19:13] going to receive him or not. See, that's
[1:19:15] right. He said they're like the world.
[1:19:17] They dress like the world. They look
[1:19:19] like the world. They act like the world.
[1:19:21] They're vultures like the world. They're
[1:19:23] they are lazy, soft compromisers. Can
[1:19:26] you say amen? Well, that's pretty rough.
[1:19:28] Amen. But he's trying to get us to
[1:19:30] understand you're not to dress like the
[1:19:32] world. You're not to look like the
[1:19:34] world. You're not to smell like the
[1:19:35] world. You're not to laugh like the
[1:19:37] world. If the world is laughing at dirty
[1:19:39] jokes, that's not for you to laugh at.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? They might find joy in
[1:19:45] vulgar things. That's not where you find
[1:19:46] your pleasure. Amen. You've got to come
[1:19:49] to a separation. See, and he says it's
[1:19:52] going further and further away from God
[1:19:56] in its intellectual gospel. They have a
[1:19:59] gospel, but it's an intellectual gospel,
[1:20:02] but they're going further and further
[1:20:04] away from the word. Amen. Another place
[1:20:07] he says we find that women of the world
[1:20:10] on the streets members of such is
[1:20:12] carrying themselves in the same
[1:20:14] atmosphere. You can't tell them they've
[1:20:16] lost all sense of de common decency the
[1:20:19] people have. That's the way the church
[1:20:21] has you. And you can see it going
[1:20:24] straight to the ecumenical council just
[1:20:26] as certain as anything in the world
[1:20:28] right into Rome as hard as it can go
[1:20:30] because it's prophesied. Ain't that
[1:20:32] right? And there she is. That's her
[1:20:35] behavior. Hey, that's not the bride's
[1:20:37] behavior. She's an elect lady.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; This is the worldly church's behavior
[1:20:42] doing anything they want to regardless
[1:20:44] of what God says and and and and what he
[1:20:46] commands. Amen. But in each age, each
[1:20:51] age has had its own elect.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; And and brother Brandham said that elect
[1:20:57] group of people always heard the word
[1:21:00] and received it, proving they had the
[1:21:04] seed in them.
[1:21:06] Can you say amen?
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; So when God sent his messenger with a
[1:21:10] message, as we know there's seven
[1:21:12] messengers and brother Brandham
[1:21:14] identifies the messengers of that age.
[1:21:16] Amen. So when God sent that messenger
[1:21:18] with the messenger to that age, he says
[1:21:21] the elect had a revival under their
[1:21:24] messenger.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Well, aren't you glad for that? Amen. No
[1:21:28] revival, no God revival without a
[1:21:31] messenger. But the the the people that
[1:21:34] heard his message received that message
[1:21:37] had a revival under their messenger.
[1:21:40] See, and they lined up with the word.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; So Martin Luther, he was sent with the
[1:21:46] message of justification and the church
[1:21:48] lined up right with it and it brought a
[1:21:51] revival amongst the elect. John Wesley
[1:21:54] had the message of sanctification and
[1:21:56] the church lined right with it and it
[1:21:58] brought a revival to that elect. God
[1:22:01] restored the gifts in the Pentecostal
[1:22:03] age and the church lined right with it.
[1:22:06] See, and it brought a revival. Amen.
[1:22:09] Now, he says, "And and he says the
[1:22:11] messengers, he they dropped them women."
[1:22:14] See, each each age, he's talking to that
[1:22:16] elect of each age. Amen. Church
[1:22:19] represents women, right? Amen. See, they
[1:22:21] dropped them women right back in line
[1:22:24] with the word. Every messenger, Amen.
[1:22:27] Each messenger that came in that age,
[1:22:29] Amen. They proclaimed the message. Amen.
[1:22:31] And they brought that woman, that elect
[1:22:34] lady, that church right back in line
[1:22:37] with the word. See? And and then they
[1:22:39] drift away. See? Amen. And there she
[1:22:41] goes right back over into chaos. You
[1:22:43] understand? Not the elect, but the rest
[1:22:45] of that church, that move, that revival,
[1:22:48] God started the revival, and then that
[1:22:50] revival would end up going into chaos
[1:22:52] and people go into join this
[1:22:54] denomination and making this
[1:22:56] denomination, all that. He said, "But
[1:22:58] then the time that the people are ready
[1:23:01] to line up, there is a message that
[1:23:03] comes forth again and they line up right
[1:23:06] with it." Ain't that right? Amen. Every
[1:23:08] time God would send a message, Amen. A
[1:23:11] messenger with a message, God would line
[1:23:14] them people back up. Amen. See, and he
[1:23:16] says in another place, every time a
[1:23:18] message went forth, and the people
[1:23:20] believed it and accepted it in all the
[1:23:23] light. Everybody say, "All the light."
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; All the light it was. Then they were
[1:23:28] sealed away until that day of
[1:23:31] redemption. The rest of the people went
[1:23:33] off into denominationalism. But God by
[1:23:36] the message of the hour of that age
[1:23:39] would segregate his people, call them
[1:23:42] together, and then seal them away.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And he says, now you
[1:23:47] notice when the people begin to try to
[1:23:49] line with the word, there comes a fresh
[1:23:52] message from the word of God right
[1:23:55] straight to the people. and they catch
[1:23:58] that message and line up every time. Can
[1:24:02] you say amen? So notice what he's
[1:24:05] saying. It's the message that lines the
[1:24:07] people up. It's the message that calls
[1:24:10] that elect together and lines them right
[1:24:13] up to the word of God. Without the
[1:24:15] message, there is no lining up. Amen.
[1:24:18] Now, I want to tell you this. The
[1:24:19] message doesn't mean nothing to the rest
[1:24:21] of the world. That God's going to
[1:24:23] separate his people. He's calling them
[1:24:26] to holiness. Can you say amen? He
[1:24:28] calling them to purity, cleanness, to
[1:24:31] walk with him to where he could have a
[1:24:34] preeminence in them. And he uses the
[1:24:37] message of the hour, every age, amen, to
[1:24:40] line them up.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; It's the message. Now notice again he
[1:24:46] says the spiritual bride when she begins
[1:24:48] to have a revival when she begins to
[1:24:51] come back and line herself up with the
[1:24:53] word of God. Watch then again how that
[1:24:56] the scripture at that time there will be
[1:24:59] a message to sweep out to catch that
[1:25:02] bride to catch that woman elect.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Well why? Because God says, "Amen." In
[1:25:11] Ephesians uh 5:25,
[1:25:14] he says, "Husbands, love your wives even
[1:25:17] as Christ also loved the church and gave
[1:25:19] himself for it that he might sanctify it
[1:25:22] and cleanse it with the washing of water
[1:25:25] by the word." Ain't that right?
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; That's the only way he does it. Amen. Is
[1:25:29] by the word.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. that he might present it to
[1:25:33] himself a glorious church, not having
[1:25:36] spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but
[1:25:40] that it should be holy.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that God's called you to
[1:25:46] holiness?
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. A purity, a cleanness, a a way of
[1:25:51] life that it might be holy and without
[1:25:55] blemish.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Now, if you notice the washing of the
[1:25:59] water by the word. Amen. The prophet
[1:26:02] takes that and goes back in the Old
[1:26:04] Testament to where God established a
[1:26:07] water of separation.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? The water of
[1:26:12] separation. The word is the water of
[1:26:15] separation that washes us, separates us
[1:26:20] from our sins. It separates us from our
[1:26:23] sicknesses. Brother Brham said, "If
[1:26:25] you've got sin, apply the word. If
[1:26:28] you've got uh uh uh sickness, apply the
[1:26:31] word. If you've got uh uh habits, apply
[1:26:35] the word. If you've got complexes, apply
[1:26:38] the word. Can you say amen? If you've
[1:26:40] got uh uh selfish desires, apply the
[1:26:43] word. If bitterness is trying to take
[1:26:46] over you, apply the word. For the word
[1:26:49] separates, it washes us and separates us
[1:26:53] and keeps us holy unto God.
[1:26:57] Praise the Lord.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; The tabernacle of Moses and of Solomon
[1:27:03] and any other that God would have them
[1:27:07] to erect throughout time was not to be
[1:27:11] used for heathen worship.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; And we know it to be God's holy temple.
[1:27:19] That's that's what it was called, God's
[1:27:22] holy temple. It's like when when Jonah
[1:27:25] was in the belly of the well and he's
[1:27:27] praying to God. He says, "Therefore, I
[1:27:28] will look unto thy holy temple."
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Well, it was just a natural temple that
[1:27:35] Solomon had built. And but but uh but or
[1:27:39] yeah, it was built and and so uh but it
[1:27:42] was it was considered God's holy temple,
[1:27:45] thy holy temple. But the tabernacle was
[1:27:48] for his presence
[1:27:51] alone.
[1:27:53] Right.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; God would exhibit his presence, manifest
[1:27:57] his presence in the temple
[1:28:01] and and and it was for his worship
[1:28:04] alone.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; they they weren't to drag the god of
[1:28:08] Dathan
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; in in their dagon.
[1:28:12] They they were not to drag the the God
[1:28:14] of Baal and and bring it into this
[1:28:17] worship
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; that everybody from all the nations
[1:28:20] could come to this tabernacle. Oh, that
[1:28:22] that that would be nice unity.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; But God didn't raise that temple for
[1:28:26] that kind of unity.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; He raised that tabernacle for his his
[1:28:32] glory,
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; his worship.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So this this
[1:28:36] tabernacle was to remain holy, set
[1:28:38] apart, dedicated, consecrated for his
[1:28:42] use, his purpose. Ain't that right?
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; See, so then it was holy. The priesthood
[1:28:48] was to be holy, set apart for God's
[1:28:50] service. Amen. Uh the vessels in the
[1:28:53] tabernacle had to be holy. Set apart to
[1:28:56] be used only for God's divine uh uh
[1:28:59] purpose. Amen. See, they were dedicated,
[1:29:02] consecrated to God. Amen. Later we find
[1:29:06] that God moved from that earthly
[1:29:07] tabernacle that that that that uh that
[1:29:11] that was made by hands and and he
[1:29:14] created himself a a body. Amen. And and
[1:29:19] prepared himself a body to live in. And
[1:29:22] Christ became God's holy temple.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Well, aren't you glad for that?
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now God had hands. God had feet.
[1:29:32] Glory of God was manifested. Amen. I've
[1:29:35] Jesus even said, "I've declared thy
[1:29:37] name." Amen. To to the brethren. I I've
[1:29:40] declared it. Amen. And the presence of
[1:29:42] God. He told Philillip when Philip says,
[1:29:44] "It suffices that you show us the
[1:29:46] Father." And and he says, "Oh, have I
[1:29:48] not been so long with you and you still
[1:29:50] don't know who I am? He that has seen me
[1:29:52] has seen the Father." Amen. Why? He was
[1:29:55] the temple of the living God. A man
[1:29:59] became a temple.
[1:30:01] of God. The fullness of God dwelt in him
[1:30:04] bodily. Ain't that right? But then we
[1:30:07] see now that we are the temple.
[1:30:10] Everybody say, "I am the temple."
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; I am the temple. We are the temple of
[1:30:16] the Holy Ghost. Amen. 1 Corinthians uh 3
[1:30:20] and 16. Know ye not that you are the
[1:30:23] temple of God and that the spirit of God
[1:30:26] dwelleth in you. Is it a different
[1:30:28] spirit that dwelt in Christ? No. For
[1:30:30] Paul says, "If the same spirit that
[1:30:32] dwelt in him, that dwell in you, it
[1:30:35] shall also quicken your mortal bodies,
[1:30:37] the same spirit that quickened him and
[1:30:39] raised him from the dead, now is
[1:30:42] dwelling in you to quicken your mortal
[1:30:44] body." Why? Because the God of heaven
[1:30:47] and earth that dwelt in Christ is now
[1:30:50] dwelling in you. For now you are the
[1:30:53] temple of the Holy Ghost.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Now notice what he says. 17th verse. If
[1:31:00] any man defile the temple of God, him
[1:31:02] shall God destroy. For the temple of God
[1:31:05] is holy, which temple you are.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? In Psalm 79 and one,
[1:31:13] we see what happens when the temple of
[1:31:16] God becomes defiled.
[1:31:18] He says, "Oh God, the heathen are come
[1:31:21] into thine inheritance, thy holy temple,
[1:31:24] have they defiled. They have laid
[1:31:26] Jerusalem on heaps. Then if you go down
[1:31:29] to the fourth verse, we are become a
[1:31:31] reproach to our neighbors, a scorn and
[1:31:34] derision to them that are round about
[1:31:38] us. Amen. See, and when the church
[1:31:41] becomes defiled, just like the worldly
[1:31:44] church has be claim, they claim to be
[1:31:46] the temple of God, they claim to possess
[1:31:49] the Holy Spirit of God, but they have
[1:31:52] let that temple become defiled.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? They've let it become
[1:31:59] preachers have let themselves become
[1:32:01] defiled. The saints have let themselves
[1:32:04] become defiled. I've told you before,
[1:32:07] you know, we were with, you know, uh me
[1:32:09] and brother Coffee was with a bunch of
[1:32:11] ministers uh years ago when I first come
[1:32:14] here. We were uh uh lifting weights and
[1:32:17] stuff, you know, doing workout with
[1:32:19] ministers from all around, you know, in
[1:32:21] the area. And uh uh this this gentleman
[1:32:26] that owned the uh owned the the weight
[1:32:29] thing that he was a he wanted to donate
[1:32:33] an hour a day for ministers and it was a
[1:32:36] really nice thing as you can see. It
[1:32:39] didn't really help me too much. But
[1:32:41] anyways, and and so uh uh but it was
[1:32:45] interesting what they would talk about,
[1:32:46] you know, and uh these pastors, you
[1:32:49] know, talking about how what concert the
[1:32:51] rock and roll concerts they just got
[1:32:52] from and what rated R movie they've just
[1:32:55] watched and and and they're all talking
[1:32:57] about this, you know, and I'm like, "Oh,
[1:32:59] wow. These are pastors, pastors
[1:33:01] preaching the word of God and and and
[1:33:04] their favorite group maybe the Beatles
[1:33:05] or or some some rock and roll group that
[1:33:08] I don't know of today, you know, but but
[1:33:10] they're talking about all this. I'm
[1:33:11] like, "Oh, wow. This is interesting, you
[1:33:13] know, and and but see, the temple had
[1:33:15] become defiled."
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Hello. The church had become defiled and
[1:33:21] it's made a church the church of God a
[1:33:24] reproach to the world to where the world
[1:33:27] doesn't respect the house of God
[1:33:29] anymore. They they have no regard for
[1:33:32] the the the the house of God anymore.
[1:33:34] It's become a bunch of professionalism.
[1:33:37] It's become just uh uh uh uh well, you
[1:33:40] know, the other day uh they they had a
[1:33:43] com comedy man uh that that does the
[1:33:45] jokes and all that uh preaching on a
[1:33:48] Sunday morning using the word of God and
[1:33:50] about Moses and making a comedy out of
[1:33:53] Moses and and having the people laugh
[1:33:55] and he was preaching and that's what the
[1:33:58] church has come to.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:34:04] But see, Israel was God's nation.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; And God had called them to be a holy
[1:34:10] people. I hope this is all right this
[1:34:12] morning.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; But he called them to be a holy people.
[1:34:15] And and so after Israel was in bondage
[1:34:18] for 400 years, God said to Pharaoh, and
[1:34:21] I want you to notice, they had been in
[1:34:23] bondage for 400 years to where Pharaoh
[1:34:26] could look at them and not see no
[1:34:28] promise about them,
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; no future for them except slavery.
[1:34:34] But God by mercy showed unto Moses
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; that these people were not slaves
[1:34:40] forever.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; And so when he would look at these
[1:34:43] people, he saw them as children of
[1:34:45] promise. He saw them as a covenant
[1:34:47] people. He saw them as a holy people. He
[1:34:50] saw them that God was going to visit one
[1:34:52] day. This condition will never be like
[1:34:55] this forever. Amen. They'll not They're
[1:34:57] not intended to be slaves forever.
[1:34:59] They're not intended to bow to Pharaoh
[1:35:01] forever. Amen. It's come a time, amen,
[1:35:04] that God going to call them out. And
[1:35:06] when that time came, God said to Pharaoh
[1:35:09] through the prophet Moses, "Let my
[1:35:11] people go.
[1:35:13] It's time for a separation. It's time
[1:35:16] that I take away their reproach. It's
[1:35:19] time I take away, Amen, everything that
[1:35:21] they've been involved in." Amen. And
[1:35:24] bring them to myself that they could be
[1:35:26] a holy people unto me.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. And it tells us
[1:35:31] you can't serve God living in bondage.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you want real freedom in God,
[1:35:36] get rid of the bondage. You say, "Well,
[1:35:38] I'm I'm trying." Oh, but there's a
[1:35:40] grace. There's a blood that is able to
[1:35:43] separate you, amen, from all your sins
[1:35:46] and and all your failures and and
[1:35:48] everything to where you can stand free
[1:35:51] to worship God. Amen.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Can't be a holy people as long as we're
[1:35:58] subject to the power of the devil.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; So God says there's got to be a
[1:36:03] separation.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Pharaoh, let my people go. And I believe
[1:36:07] that same voice is called out today.
[1:36:10] House of hell,
[1:36:13] give way in the name of the Jesus. Can
[1:36:15] you say amen? There is a people that's
[1:36:18] ordained for a rapture. There is a
[1:36:20] people that's ordained for a body
[1:36:22] change. There people on the earth that's
[1:36:25] ordained to manifest the sons and
[1:36:27] daughters of God and to come into
[1:36:29] adoption. Let my people go.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; There had to be a separation.
[1:36:38] But notice after Israel came out of
[1:36:41] Egypt, God commanded them to put away
[1:36:45] leaven bread.
[1:36:48] I'll say that again. leaven bread,
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; not leaven, leaven bread
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; from their houses
[1:36:57] in the first day. Now, we know what
[1:36:59] leaven represents. It represents sin.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; So, it was a it was showing a sign that
[1:37:06] you've come out of Egypt,
[1:37:09] but there's always a walk of holiness.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Keep sin out of your houses.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Keep living away from you.
[1:37:16] Can you say amen? God may have called
[1:37:19] you in this by this message of the hour.
[1:37:21] How many's been called out by the
[1:37:23] message of the hour? Church, I could
[1:37:25] have been somewhere else, but I thank
[1:37:26] God for the message of this hour. But
[1:37:29] it's not for me to listen to this
[1:37:30] message and getting involved with the
[1:37:32] movies and and this and that and this.
[1:37:35] God called me out of this me by this
[1:37:38] message that I could be a powerhouse.
[1:37:40] Amen. that I could be a holy vessel unto
[1:37:43] God and reflect him in this age.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; You know, you and I both know that
[1:37:50] there's a power laying in the church.
[1:37:52] You and I both know that the power
[1:37:54] doesn't just amen belong to a prophet.
[1:37:57] But he kept telling us over and over
[1:37:59] that that promise greater, amen, the
[1:38:01] works that I do shall you do, and even
[1:38:03] greater than these shall you do. It
[1:38:05] didn't just belong to him. It belonged
[1:38:07] to the church of the living God.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; That's right. Do you believe it?
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; 11. Keep the leaven out.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Then in Joshua 24:14,
[1:38:21] Joshua called an assembly and said to
[1:38:23] the people breaking in here, "Fear the
[1:38:25] Lord. Serve him in sincerity and in
[1:38:29] truth, and put away the gods which your
[1:38:32] fathers served on the other side of the
[1:38:35] flood and in Egypt, and serve ye the
[1:38:38] Lord." What's he doing? He's getting
[1:38:40] ready to bring them over into the
[1:38:41] promised land. Amen. You You've We've
[1:38:44] talked about the promises. We've sung
[1:38:46] about the promises. We've read about the
[1:38:49] promises. We We've thought about them
[1:38:51] promises. But now I'm here to bring you
[1:38:54] over into the promised land where every
[1:38:56] promise becomes a reality. But before we
[1:39:00] do all of this, you got to put away the
[1:39:01] gods. Every other god that you have you
[1:39:04] have brought from Egypt, you got to get
[1:39:05] rid of. You got to get you got to clean
[1:39:08] the house. You got to you got to clean
[1:39:10] your worship up. Amen. To where we can
[1:39:12] serve God and God alone.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Later on he says, "Put away the strange
[1:39:20] gods which are among you and incline
[1:39:22] your heart unto the Lord God of Israel."
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Now church, just as Joshua brought the
[1:39:29] children of Israel over, so is this
[1:39:31] message of the hour. Amen. Taken us
[1:39:33] through the twothirds of the land. First
[1:39:36] pool, second pool. But now we have
[1:39:38] entered into the third pool. Amen. The
[1:39:41] opening of the word. Uh you don't have
[1:39:43] to dream about the promises. Uh you
[1:39:45] don't have to wish for them promises.
[1:39:47] We're not just singing about these
[1:39:48] promises. Every promise is ours. Can you
[1:39:53] say amen? We've been predestinated.
[1:39:56] Put away your gods.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; We're not to mix with the nations other
[1:40:02] nations.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; No. No. No. Utterly destroy them.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Now it sounds merciless. It sounds like
[1:40:09] God was just a hateful God and he was
[1:40:12] evil. But it was a natural people typing
[1:40:14] a spiritual people. Them people, Israel
[1:40:18] was typing us. Now they had a natural
[1:40:20] enemy. They had a natural nations that
[1:40:23] they had to conquer. And they were not
[1:40:25] to let any of them live. They were to
[1:40:27] slay one of them. Amen. And destroy
[1:40:30] them. They were not to look at them
[1:40:32] girls and say, "Boy, that's a pretty
[1:40:33] girl. I you know, you understand what
[1:40:35] I'm saying now? Oh, yeah. But you don't
[1:40:38] understand. She's got a She's serving
[1:40:39] another God. I don't care about that. I
[1:40:41] can change her anytime. You know, I'm
[1:40:42] sure I can I can, you know, she's just
[1:40:45] so nice and so soft-hearted. I bet I
[1:40:47] bring her over here. The Bible says,
[1:40:50] "Don't you do that." Amen. Don't you
[1:40:52] give your sons to their daughters and
[1:40:54] don't you give your daughters to their
[1:40:56] sons unless they turn them away from the
[1:40:59] God to serve their gods. Can you say
[1:41:03] amen? There has to be a separation.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; They were not to mix with other nations.
[1:41:19] We know as they journeyied to the land
[1:41:21] of promise,
[1:41:22] they passed by Esau's inheritance
[1:41:26] land
[1:41:29] and they went through
[1:41:32] the land of Moab.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; But the prophet said God told them not
[1:41:37] to fuss at them, not to procelite.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Don't take up their habits.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; You're going through their land, but
[1:41:45] don't you take up their habits.
[1:41:48] Hello.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; We're we're we're we're on our journey
[1:41:51] to heaven
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; and we're living in this world and we've
[1:41:55] gone from age to age to age and we're
[1:41:57] living in the worst age ever. Don't you
[1:41:59] take up their habits.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; But here's the thing. Israel wanted to
[1:42:10] be as other nations.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; They didn't like standing out from the
[1:42:14] rest.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Go ahead. Other nations had all this and
[1:42:18] they had something in common. But here
[1:42:19] we are. We just got a prophet.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Our diet is different. Our worship is
[1:42:27] different. We don't have no visible
[1:42:28] gods.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Our ritual of worship is different from
[1:42:37] them. It looks like we're just
[1:42:39] self-righteous people. They looking at
[1:42:41] us like holier than thou. I'm the one
[1:42:44] standing alone.
[1:42:49] Amen.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; And they wanted to be like the other
[1:42:51] nations.
[1:42:53] Hello.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; They're like a lot of so-called
[1:42:56] Christians today.
[1:42:58] They say they believe the message they
[1:43:00] are, but they can't understand why we
[1:43:01] have to live separated.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; It's true. And and I'm I'm going to say
[1:43:08] it, but we got a lot of the our young
[1:43:10] generation. We got a and our young
[1:43:12] generation don't understand the
[1:43:14] importance of this message. They they
[1:43:16] don't understand the importance of why
[1:43:19] God's called us out.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; So they want to look at the world. Did
[1:43:23] you know brother Brown said you're not
[1:43:24] to even dress like the fashions of this
[1:43:26] world?
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Don't take up their fashions. Oh, but
[1:43:30] but but their style of dress looks nice.
[1:43:33] Don't take up their fashions.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; And that's not just you girls. That's
[1:43:38] you guys, too. Amen.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Well, it's true.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; See, but but but so so they can
[1:43:48] understand why they can't be like the
[1:43:50] other churches. Other churches have
[1:43:52] baseball leagues, and other churches
[1:43:54] have movie nights, and and other
[1:43:56] churches allow their young people to go
[1:43:57] to the movies and get involved in
[1:43:59] sports, and other churches allow their
[1:44:01] young people to wear to to marry worldly
[1:44:05] uh boys and worldly girls and to date
[1:44:07] and and all of these things. and and all
[1:44:10] that. We just like to be like the rest.
[1:44:12] Amen. But God has called us to be a holy
[1:44:15] people.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; But Israel wanted to be like the other
[1:44:20] nations.
[1:44:23] What What sin did Israel commit that God
[1:44:26] would never forgive them for?
[1:44:31] They listen to the teaching of Balum.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; You remember Balam?
[1:44:37] He was a Moabitete.
[1:44:40] Well, Moabitete came from Lot.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Remember his two daughters had incest
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; with him and they they produced sons by
[1:44:49] their dad.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; And that that that now we got a nation,
[1:44:55] the Moabites.
[1:44:59] Now, the prophet says the Moabites
[1:45:01] weren't infidels.
[1:45:03] They weren't godless people.
[1:45:06] They actually were religious and they
[1:45:09] were fundamental as fundamental as
[1:45:12] Israel was. They built the same amount
[1:45:14] of offers, offered the same amount of
[1:45:16] sacrifices, the same kind of sacrifices.
[1:45:19] They had the same promise sacrifices and
[1:45:21] worshiped the same God.
[1:45:24] Balam actually was a prophet, but he was
[1:45:27] a hirling.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:45:31] He was a prophet, but God never sent him
[1:45:34] as a prophet to Israel.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Moses was the vindicated prophet of God
[1:45:41] sent to lead Israel to the promised
[1:45:43] land.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Balam was a prophet, but he was over
[1:45:46] there trying to curse Israel.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; God wouldn't let him curse Israel.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; He looking at Israel from a moral
[1:45:54] standpoint,
[1:45:56] right?
[1:45:57] Prophet said he tried to judge a people
[1:45:59] by a moral god, a holy God, but he
[1:46:01] failed to see the smitten rock before
[1:46:03] them,
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; the brazen serpent, that atonement that
[1:46:06] forgave their sins. He failed to see
[1:46:08] that pillar of fire. He tried to judge
[1:46:10] them from a moral standpoint. He failed
[1:46:13] to see the higher call of God
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; by grace, by election. They were in that
[1:46:19] line and with God's word. And when he
[1:46:22] wanted to curse them, God said, "Don't
[1:46:24] you do it. They're mine. Amen.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Leave them alone. Don't you touch them.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; So what did he do? He tried another
[1:46:30] tactic.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says he got down there
[1:46:37] and taught the people. Now say now, now
[1:46:39] wait, wait, wait, wait, wait just a
[1:46:40] minute before y'all go on. I got
[1:46:42] something to say to y'all.
[1:46:45] Of course, I'll be a little quiet so I
[1:46:47] don't want your prophet Moses hearing
[1:46:48] what I have to say.
[1:46:54] You know what?
[1:46:56] We're more We're just as religious as
[1:46:59] you guys.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; We We worship the same God. We got the
[1:47:04] same Holy Ghost you got.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; We speak in tongues. We shout and dance.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; He said, "We're more moabites. Lot's
[1:47:20] daughter is our queen. She's our
[1:47:22] origination or or origination. We're all
[1:47:26] of one blood. See, all of us
[1:47:28] denominations are the same. See, uh uh
[1:47:32] but the prophet said, "Don't you mix
[1:47:34] with that thing. Stay away from there."
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; So Balam said, "We're all the same.
[1:47:38] While your people is like my people, we
[1:47:40] can intermar and and one am one among
[1:47:43] another. And so we could have a real
[1:47:45] ecumenical council. All of us can get
[1:47:48] together and come back to the original
[1:47:50] thing again. Well, see, this is known in
[1:47:52] the book of Revelations as the doctrine
[1:47:54] of Balum.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says he taught Bailo to
[1:48:00] cast a stumbling block before the
[1:48:02] children of Israel, to eat things
[1:48:04] sacrificed unto idols and to commit
[1:48:06] fornications.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? See, Bam might have
[1:48:10] believed in the same God that Israel
[1:48:12] believed in. Amen. But he wasn't going
[1:48:14] to the promised land. He was already in
[1:48:16] his inheritance. He wasn't as a
[1:48:19] sojourer. He wasn't looking to move on.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; He didn't have the covenant that Israel
[1:48:26] had.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; He was a prophet to Moab, not to Israel.
[1:48:35] So, he had a ministry. Yes. He had a
[1:48:37] gift. Yes. He was a preacher. Yes.
[1:48:40] But he wasn't concerned for Israel.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; He used his gift. He used his ministry
[1:48:46] to cast a stumbling block before the
[1:48:48] elect of God,
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; before the people of God. He wasn't
[1:48:51] careful as to what he said to the
[1:48:53] children of Israel. I truly believe that
[1:48:55] Moses was very careful in what he said
[1:48:58] to the people.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; And and and so as not to mislead them.
[1:49:02] And and I know brother Brand was he said
[1:49:04] this. He said, you know, in the sight of
[1:49:06] God tonight, setting before me is a
[1:49:08] greater thing to him than his own blood
[1:49:11] because it's the purchased of his blood.
[1:49:14] He shed his blood for you. And here I
[1:49:17] hold you in listening tonight of the
[1:49:19] gospel. Then how close I must be to tell
[1:49:22] you the exact truth because God will
[1:49:26] make me answer for it at the day of
[1:49:28] judgment more than if I took the blood,
[1:49:30] the literal blood, and just threw it on
[1:49:32] the ground. It would be a greater
[1:49:34] penalty to mislead the people, the
[1:49:36] purchase of his blood, than it would be
[1:49:39] to throw the blood from the charger that
[1:49:40] I had in it.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Yeah.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; See, and and so then Bailey convinced
[1:49:46] Israel to to marry Moabitete women and
[1:49:50] caused adultery. And brother Bram said,
[1:49:52] notice it was then, and I'll get ready
[1:49:55] to hurry now, but he said it was then,
[1:49:57] hallelujah, when Moses stepped forth and
[1:50:00] said, "Who's for me and God?"
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; It was then the Levite pulled his sword
[1:50:06] and went through the camp and utterly
[1:50:08] slayed everything that was connected
[1:50:10] with it. everything, every man that had
[1:50:12] a Moabitete woman, they killed them
[1:50:15] right together. Now the hour has come.
[1:50:18] Where is that man? Where is Aaron's
[1:50:20] sons? Some of the priesthood that is
[1:50:22] willing to pull the word of God, this
[1:50:24] sharp two-edged sword and said, "Who
[1:50:26] stands for me and God? Where is he at?"
[1:50:29] You can invite and invite, but no one
[1:50:32] answers. Ain't that right? Well, I'll
[1:50:33] say I'll answer. How many going to
[1:50:35] answer to that call? Amen. God looking
[1:50:38] for somebody just that ain't married in
[1:50:41] and and and and got mixed up into the
[1:50:43] world and got mixed up into all these
[1:50:45] corruptible things. Stay themselves
[1:50:48] undefiled. Amen. Standing with the
[1:50:50] prophet of God, the word of God.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you love him?
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:59] Now, Brother Brham said they were
[1:51:01] Pentecostals. They ate mana in the
[1:51:02] wilderness. They drank from the rock.
[1:51:05] Amen. Uh there. But Jesus says they were
[1:51:07] they're everyone dead.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; They saw the miracles. They saw the word
[1:51:11] anointed. They ate mana that come from
[1:51:13] heaven. They enjoyed the blessings of
[1:51:15] the atonement. They saw the smitten rock
[1:51:17] give its water. They drank from it. They
[1:51:19] were personally acquainted with it.
[1:51:21] Personally acquainted with it. But when
[1:51:23] it come to breaking that word, don't you
[1:51:25] never forget that when the real true
[1:51:28] message come down to a showdown, they
[1:51:30] organized it. We'll take moabites and us
[1:51:33] together. And they're a great
[1:51:35] organization. a great nation. We're not
[1:51:37] even a nation. So, we'll just marry
[1:51:39] among one another and we'll be all right
[1:51:41] then. We'll be with him. And it never
[1:51:43] was forgiven. Never forgiven. Can you
[1:51:45] say amen?
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; He said, see in another place when it
[1:51:48] come to the exact message where they
[1:51:50] shouldn't break that covenant with the
[1:51:52] other nation. See, and God does not want
[1:51:54] us this hold this word sacred.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; You may not understand everything, but
[1:52:02] hold it sacred.
[1:52:04] Don't let this word lose its value to
[1:52:08] you.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; Hold it dear to us.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I just don't understand
[1:52:14] everything. It looks like it just
[1:52:16] contradicts and it looks like this. It
[1:52:17] looks like," you know, one man said,
[1:52:18] "Brother Bram didn't even know what he's
[1:52:19] talking about on some of these things."
[1:52:21] Oh my. Hold that word sacred.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you love him?
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful?
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, we're living in an age
[1:52:34] that the musicians will come. We're
[1:52:37] living in an age now. And this age is
[1:52:39] what? Leotia, lukewarm,
[1:52:43] carnal.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is the only age that God
[1:52:49] rebukes and does not commend them for
[1:52:52] anything
[1:52:53] is the age that we're living in.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; Lukewarmness.
[1:52:59] And their lukewarmness made God sick.
[1:53:00] God says, "I'd I'd rather you be cold,
[1:53:03] freezing cold, just an outreach sinner,
[1:53:08] or I'd rather you be on fire for me,
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; red hot on fire."
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; But to be lukewarm, a mixture, you make
[1:53:18] me sick,
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; so I'll spew you out. So the prophet
[1:53:23] says God has spewed out the church
[1:53:25] carnal
[1:53:28] and they are no longer his mouthpiece.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; They may preach from this Bible. They
[1:53:33] may sing the songs. They may dance. They
[1:53:35] may shout, but they're no longer the
[1:53:37] mouthpiece of God
[1:53:41] because they've mixed with creeds.
[1:53:43] They've not separated themselves to the
[1:53:46] word and the word alone. Can you say
[1:53:49] amen?
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:51] [Music]
[1:53:55] So he, brother Bram said, he said that's
[1:53:57] a rebuke to this ungodly leodysian age.
[1:54:02] The worst of the whole bunch. All the
[1:54:04] rest of them under torments and
[1:54:05] everything they had down through the
[1:54:06] ages. They had nothing. They was
[1:54:09] povertystricken, wandered about in
[1:54:11] sheepkin, goat skin, destituted, sold,
[1:54:14] and burnt to death, fed to the lions,
[1:54:16] and everything else, and still held the
[1:54:18] faith. But here's this bunch. Rich and
[1:54:20] have need of nothing and everything and
[1:54:22] a prostitute. Can you say amen?
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; But God has called a people by the
[1:54:29] message of this hour.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; To live separate unto God.
[1:54:35] How many wants to live separate to God?
[1:54:39] I want to live separate to his word. I
[1:54:43] I want to be more fervent than ever to
[1:54:46] this message.
[1:54:47] I want my resolve to be stronger. And I
[1:54:50] I pray that is way with you young people
[1:54:54] this morning.
[1:54:57] As I said at the beginning,
[1:55:00] if God would terry, we're going to be
[1:55:02] passing the baton to you.
[1:55:06] [Music]
[1:55:09] God may call you to be a minister. God
[1:55:11] may be call you to be a minister's wife.
[1:55:14] God may call you to be a musicians or
[1:55:17] deacons or whatever,
[1:55:19] but this message has got to be just as
[1:55:22] fervent to you as it is with the elders.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Don't don't don't look at the world,
[1:55:31] look at the pictures and look at all.
[1:55:33] Keep your values,
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; keep your convictions,
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:55:41] Stay true to God.
[1:55:44] Don't don't mix with the unbelief out in
[1:55:46] the world. I know you you might have to
[1:55:48] rub shoulders at work with them, at
[1:55:50] school with them, or whatever, but but
[1:55:52] keep yourself undefiled.
[1:55:55] You've got examples.
[1:55:58] The three Hebrew boys, remember that
[1:56:02] they they were in Babylon. They they
[1:56:03] weren't in their hometown. They were in
[1:56:05] Babylon as slaves.
[1:56:08] And that wicked king, they they were
[1:56:10] serving a wicked king.
[1:56:13] And he decided to make that image. But
[1:56:15] there's these three boys. We ain't doing
[1:56:18] that. No, we're keeping ourselves holy
[1:56:21] unto God.
[1:56:24] Yeah. And he had to go through the fiery
[1:56:26] furnace for it. But God was there with
[1:56:28] him, right? Daniel, he would he wouldn't
[1:56:31] keep he wouldn't defile himself. He kept
[1:56:34] himself clean, holy unto God. He went
[1:56:37] had to go to the lion's den for it, but
[1:56:39] God met him there. God brought him
[1:56:41] through. through. And I I promise you,
[1:56:42] God will bring you through. He'll bring
[1:56:45] this church through if we keep it right.
[1:56:47] Right. He'll keep us through. He'll
[1:56:50] He'll bring us all through. We just got
[1:56:53] to keep it. He'll bring your family
[1:56:55] through. He'll bring your marriage
[1:56:56] through. He He He'll He'll bring your
[1:56:58] children through. He's going to bring
[1:57:00] them.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, do you love him? Can you lift
[1:57:04] your hands unto the Lord and just to
[1:57:07] worship him? I'm so glad. I I'm so glad
[1:57:11] to to be dedicated unto God.
[1:57:16] Gladly bear his reproach
[1:57:19] in this age that we're living in.
[1:57:22] God, help us to keep our garments clean,
[1:57:25] undefiled. Father,
[1:57:28] so much enticements out in the world
[1:57:30] today.
[1:57:32] So many things that are pulling, but oh
[1:57:34] God, you've called us for this. You've
[1:57:38] called us to be true to this message.
[1:57:40] Just as you called that prophet, he
[1:57:42] said, "I must stay true to this this
[1:57:45] message." So must we stay true to this
[1:57:48] message.
[1:57:50] Thank you, Father.
[1:57:52] Oh God, as the young people are getting
[1:57:54] ready to go to school,
[1:57:57] Father, I pray you'd just help them,
[1:58:00] that you'll keep them, Lord.
[1:58:04] Father, protect them. May your angel be
[1:58:07] with them, Lord. Keep their feet from
[1:58:10] falling, Lord. And if they do stumble,
[1:58:14] Lord, you got a promise there. Let
[1:58:16] though a righteous man fall, the Lord
[1:58:18] will lift him up and deliver him. God,
[1:58:22] we stand upon that today.
[1:58:25] We love you. I thank you, Lord, for just
[1:58:27] touching all the sick.
[1:58:30] Father, our elders,

[1:58:36] well. And Father, just thanking you,
[1:58:40] Lord, for just bringing them all
[1:58:42] through.

[1:58:47] elders that have standing for your word
[1:58:50] through all these years, standing true.
[1:58:53] I thank you for bringing Sister Kim,
[1:58:56] being with her, Father, through her
[1:58:59] surgery and her recovery. God, I thank
[1:59:02] you for being with Sister Martha, Lord.
[1:59:05] Oh, God, I know you've been with her,
[1:59:08] Lord. And we've seen your hand upon her.
[1:59:12] Thank you, Father, for just helping her
[1:59:14] through this, Lord. And we know that
[1:59:17] you're going to finish it, Lord, and
[1:59:19] complete it and work a miracle in her
[1:59:21] behalf.
[1:59:23] Father, we thank you. You're so good to
[1:59:25] us.
[1:59:27] Hallelujah. Do you love him, church?
[1:59:30] Amen. What song?

[2:00:56] still is true.
[2:00:59] Oh, it's been ridiculed. It's been
