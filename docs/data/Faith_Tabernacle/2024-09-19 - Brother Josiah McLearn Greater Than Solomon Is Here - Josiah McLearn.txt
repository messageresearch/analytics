out there taught me to make knives and uh wanted to come up and visit for a week so uh it's good to have him amen do you love the Lord amen aren't you thankful for his grace and his Mercy that he's given to us amen I'd like to turn to the scriptures to Matthew 12 verse 41 amen Matthew 12 verse 41 says the men of Nineveh shall rise and in judgment with this with this generation and shall and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonas and behold a greater than Jonas is here and the queen of the South shall rise up in the Judgment with this with this generation and shall and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater than then Solomon is here also like to turn to uh 2 Corinthians ch 3:2 amen 2 Corinthians chapter 3 amen 2 Corinthians 3:12 says seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech and not a and not as Moses which put a veil over his face that the children of Israel would could not steadfastly look look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded for un until this day remaineth the same Veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament which Veil is done away in Christ but even unto this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their heart never nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is is Liberty but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord amen let's all bow our heads our gracious Heavenly Father Lord how we love you father and Lord how thankful we are father for another opportunity Lord just to come in your presence and sit at your feet Lord and learn of you father we ask you Lord now just to walk the aisles now father and touch every heart and life here Lord we ask you father just to help me lay myself aside and speak through me Lord Lord become the Potter father and I Am The Clay Lord we ask you father now just to take complete control we we love you and thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen y'all can have your seats um I wanted to speak just for a few minutes tonight if the Lord willing on um on a greater than Solomon is here and uh uh but we but I also kind of wanted to speak a little bit about uh about um um um uh make this Valley full of ditches and uh but we notice that um that that Christ in in second in second Corinthians there it says it says that that um that when that that that that that there was a veil upon the hearts of the people and where where that where that they can they they can never they can never they can never look in into the into the into the into the holiest of of of holies where that once a year once a year only the high priest could could could could could could could could could enter in there and where the shikina glory of God had had had had had hovered had hovered and there and that's and that and that's where where where where it had abided and um and only once year that high priest could cross that Veil and and and and and enter in well now well well now we know that that that that when that that that that was that was Moses's message to his people in that day and and we notice that that that throughout time God has always come in a different Veil and a in a different mask where where where where he would come one day and he would come as Noah and one day where where Noah was was preaching was preaching to to repent and and and get on the ark Arc Ark because because the Reign is coming and and Moses came came with the Deliverance to his people and and shamgar came and preached a message to his people and and and Isaiah preached a message to his people but but but but yet those those different those different messages would not work in in the other person's day when when when when Jesus when when Jesus had had come he he couldn't have preached he could not have preached have preached Noah's message right because if if Jesus had showed up and and said to repent and board the ark it it wouldn't have worked it was not it was not it was not applicable applicable for that day and in that time but but but but but but but but but Noah but but we find that Noah had had a portion of God and he acted a a a particular way way way way in his in his message and his message was a particular way because it was in that time and in that season for that day it was the word for his day being being being made being made made manifested he could not have come with with with with with Moses's message it wouldn't have worked he he he he he couldn't have come and tried to split the red the the the the Red Sea or call Fire down down down from from heaven in Elijah's day because it wasn't it wasn't for that day and for that and for the and and for and for that hour but when he come he Express exactly what what what what God told him to to do he he and and all those people all those people who was redeemable right those eight Souls all those people who were redeemable redeemable believed it be because because as the prophet said they were the thoughts of God the attributes of him at the beginning was made flesh and redeemable and and was brought back to God as many as received him to them gave he the power to become sons of God because they were they was they were re re re re redeemable they were from the beginning in the expression of God so so so so so so so so so so now so now so now we can we can look throughout history and see that that that God that God with that veil with with that with that Veil over himself he he he showed up and manifested himself as Ezekiel he showed up and manifested himself through Isaiah through through David through all those prophets of of of the Old Testament why because because he came in in and and he came in different mask in a different times and different seasons in and and and and and in history but we notice God never changed God has never changed changed changed his nature who he was God was still God go he was still the same back then as he as he is as he is as he is as he is today but we just notice he changed his mask and in Joel chapter 2 and 28 he says he promised that in these last days there will be a Lou rain poured out upon the people and and and and brother Bram said said said said that the Greek word there is is kenos which means he emptied himself out not in the way that that that that that that that we would say like something was inside of something somebody that he emptied out but he poured himself out he he said he changed he changed his and morphe he changed from what he was to what he is and he never changes his nature but on the day of Pentecost he changed himself from being the son of man to the Son of God he came not not with the people he came in the people see the same God to carry his ministry on through in this in in this great Age and and and and and so he said another place he said he said Jesus is our Moses of of of of Jesus is our Moses of today Moses's veil was the Living Word Moses's veil was the Living Word to the people today Jesus Jesus veiled is the Living Word to is the Living Word to the people that Jesus is in the church the Holy Ghost the Son of God in the people revealing the word by the promise of this day makes it just exactly the the same now so now we look at we step back can we look at at Jonah and because it says it says that it says that it says that greater than Jonah was here in that scripture and but but yet but yet you can look at Jonah when he when he ran away from God's calling and he ended up and he ended up in the belly of the well and and and and brother brandham said said said that everywhere that that that Jonah looked was he looked left it was Wells belly and he looked right it was Well's belly and he looked up it was Well's belly and everywhere he could see was nothing but the belly of the whale but brother Bram said said that he looked at his circumstances as lying vanities right just just as as as brother Branson Branson had had had testified before um um during during the the the the the the song service he he came and Satan tried to tried tried to lay a sickness on him but but but but Branson Branson recognized it as a lying vanity right and and and and so and so we know that Jonah when when Solomon had dedicated had dedicated the temple that God had Vindicated his presence in that in that in that in that in that in that Temple by letting his glory fill that place up and and by coming in and by coming in in in as a as a pillar of of cloud and it went and and and sat behind the holy place and upon the mercy seat and over the ark and it settled down and it filled that place up and Solomon prayed Lord If thy people be in trouble anywhere and will look to this holy place and pray then you will hear from heaven now now now now now now if Jonah under all those circumstances where he where he was set with all the the rotting nasty um um fish and that seaweed and all that that filth and and and and if he could sit there sat there and think about that about that about that that that that that promise that that what God had had had had had had promised him that if you will look to this Holy Temple and and and a and pray God God will God will will will hear will hear will hear your your prayer amen so if if he can have faith in the prayer in the prayer in the in the in the prayer of a man a a human being that had later on had backslid and and and and over a temple that had been that had been built had been built by by the by the by the Hands by by the hands of man that God that God that God had had come into to to to how much more ought we tonight as the Bride As the Bride of Jesus Christ when when all the circumstances that we have are stacking up against us when when all when all we see to the left and the right is we see might see have financial problems we might have sickness our children might be might be straying left or right or or or or or or or when it seems like all hell is coming against us where where where where where we can sit in the presence of the great God himself and and where where where where we can look at all those and call those as lying vanities where we can claim our God our God our God our God our God g g given rights and and where we can see people healed and saved and filled with the and filled with the Holy Ghost why why we don't look we don't look to towards a natur a natural Temple tonight but but but but but but but but we look at at a temple in in in heaven it's Christ Jesus where Christ sits on the right hand of the of the of the Throne of God and and and with the power of his own blood to make intercession Upon Our confession we why God has gone from the temple in the wilderness and the Temple of of of of of so of Solomon where that Shak glory of God was in the holiest of holies where where where it was such a a holy atmosphere where where the high priest he had to go through this whole this this ritual just to be able to walk in there where they had to they they they had to to to anoint him from from head to toe with oil where he had bells on the bottom of his of his robe where where where where where when he had to walk such a certain way where those bells would play Holy Holy Holy unto the Lord why because it was a the shakina of Glory the very power the existence of God was dwelling in in that that that that Temple but yet now but yet now he's no longer he's no he's no longer dwelling in the temple made of of of of of of of of stone and brick and gold now he's dwelling in human flesh where where the worshipper once purged once purged has no more desire has no more desire to to S and not even a consciousness of it we in the Old Testament that that that that worshipper would would come in and offer and offer his sacrifice year after year but but but the difference was he would come back and he would come back out with the same desire he he he every year he he he would roll back and say I'm going to be different this year sacrifice sacrifice and tomorrow he' turn around and fall again but yet as but but but yet but yet when Christ died when Christ died died died on on Calvary we can now we can now come forth and lay our sacrifice at the at the at the feet of Jesus the Shina glory of God and when we can get up and and and we have no more we have no more desire of sin it has been purged from our very existence but just as the Bible says we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord we are changed we we are we are we are we are not just we not up one day and down the other we're not we're not this way or we're that way we are changed from Glory unto Glory as the glory of the Lord is Fallen is Fallen upon the bride brother bam said said said said said then it was God it was God in them days it was God in a man his son Christ Jesus we believe that not just a prophet not just an ordinary man a an ordinary human it was God in Christ God in a man the fullness of the godhead bodily in a man God in a man now it's God in man the fullness of God in the godhead bodily his entire church manifesting himself fulfilling his his word and and and so so so so so so we find that that that that God has always had had a skin on him right he he said through throughout time he has always worked through worked worked he has always worked through man mankind you look he he had he he had he had he had Moses when Moses had had had had seen him he he he looked like a man and talk like a man but God had veiled him toward toward to where he only seen the backside of him what but but but why but but God but God but God had a skin on him but but but but but yet we also know that brother man taught us that Moses was literally God to those people he was God in in flesh to those to those people at that time it was it was a manifestation of of God of God of God of God for that for that time but but but but and and and brother brother brother brother brandom said now I think in that you find out the changing himself what he did he said if you'll notice he came in the name of Three Sons he he came in the name of the son of man the Son of God and the son of David he came as and he came as son of man now in Ezekiel 2:3 it says Jehovah himself called Ezekiel the prophet son of man son of man means a prophet and and he had to come that way that way to fulfill D Deuteronomy 1815 which Moses said the Lord your God shall raise up among you a prophet likened on on likened on unto me he he never he never called he never called himself the son of man he referred he referred to himself he he he referred to himself the he he never called himself the son of man he referred to himself the the son of man because he had he had to come according to the scriptures see he had to make these two pieces of torn paper the Old Testament prophecy and his own character to be exactly the same so he come the son of man come in that form but then he and he says but then we find after his death burial and Resurrection he come on the day of Pentecost as Son of God God God the spirit in the form Holy Ghost what was he doing he was changing himself making himself known to his people in a different form like the Holy Spirit which is God he come to deal through he he come to deal with with he he come to deal Through the Ages as Son of God the the Holy Spirit he said but in the Millennium he comes as son of David to set on the throne of David King he he was he was to take the Throne of David he he is on the father's so now but but and then he said he he that overcometh cometh shall set with me on my Throne as I overcome and set on my father's Throne so he in the Millennium he'll be son of David what is it the same God all the time just changing his mask it's that of morphe and and and and and but but but and then and then a bit later later on down he says Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man deity veiled again in human flesh now now now now remember Jesus didn't say when the Son of God is is being revealed and in in Luke in Luke in Luke the 17 chapter he he said when the son of man is being revealed the son of man back in the church again revealed revealed in human beings not Son of God but son of man again back in his church again in the last days we find that he promised that he that we find what he promised that in God it was in God promises so so so so so we find though that he he went from that he's changed back into the son of man in these last days why because it has to fulfill the the Malachi Malachi 45 and 6 and and and and the rest of the of of of of the of of the scriptures we had he he he was he was he was just like God the Father God the son and God the Holy Ghost it's the same God but three but three different attributes of the same God now this is son of now now now now now now now son of David is is is is to the Jews right but but now he has revealed himself in these last days as son of man again revealing himself revealing himself again in a prophet and a prophet in these last days why because he he he had he had to fulfill all scriptures but but um you guys you guys will have to help me out here cuz I'm trying to lay this this Foundation just to to to to to show something here but but he says he brother Lam said now in these last days he returned back as son of man because Malachi promises that there would be a prophet rise up in the last days that would return the hearts of of the people people back to the original word the faith of the fathers the original Pentecost and when he did it St John 14:12 says the works that he did w would be done would be done would be done would be done also in Revelations 10 promises the whole mystery so God is is sending the son of man as the super again in these last days we notice that when that that when that when when when when when when when mzc appear appear appeared on the on the planes to to to to to to to to Abraham Abraham he he God called he he called Abraham called him called him called him called him Elohim the self-existent one and and and and when that when that when that man in human flesh God wrapped in that in that human flesh had his back had his back had his back had his back to to the tent and called Sarah out he discerned the thoughts in the spirit and the the thoughts in the intense in the intense of of of of of of of her heart showing what was to come in the in the in the in these last days God God God that would that would be our super sign sign sign sign in these last days why because because because now we have we have we have man veiled in in human in our God veiled in human flesh again in these last days Days showing just exactly what was to come and what was to be with the through through the bride through the bride of Christ so so and he says he he said he said he he said he said as it was in the days of Sodom he said in the days of Sodom so will it be in the coming of of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed not no more as a church see see see not no more the bride is called see in the days of the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the Head unite the marriage of of the Bride the bridegroom call call come right will come right will come right through this when the son of man will come down in in human flesh to unite the two together the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not not a clergyman he he he said he said he said he said he said he said he said do you see what I mean see it's the son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us and will make his word so real that it will unite the it will unite the church and him as one the bride and then she'll go home to the wedding supper why CU God has veiled in in in human flesh in these last days days as the as the Son of God in Jesus now once again through through through his Prophet as a as as the son of man now living now now now now in his people living and dwelling and dwelling in in in her through the bride of Christ bone of her bone and bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh husband and wife becoming the selfs the self the same person Jesus and his bride becoming one Behold a greater than Solomon is now here in in in in in our midst but but but but you know um when when um so we so so so so so so so so when we come when we come here here tonight here tonight for for for healing or or or or or or whatever it is whatever it it is it is it is that that that we have a need of tonight all you have to do is let that Holy Spirit get get get get a hold of you and you get and brother said you get a hold of it and you're going to get exactly what you ask for there's no way from there's no way to keep you to to keep you to keep you from from it you come believing that if if you come believing that Jesus Christ saves and that there is a saving power that get that gets that gets that gets a hold of you you and and and you a hold to it you are going to get saved if you believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit gets a hold of you and he'll baptize you and you get a hold of him you won't have brother brother says you won have you will not have to move from your seat he will fill you with his presence right there right right there right there where you are just as he did while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on them on them that that that that that fell on them that that hurt it something had got a hold of it so so so so we don't we notice we we notice that uh that uh that that that that that the queen of of of Sheba with with with with that something had had had had got a hold of her with when when all the circumstances that she had when she had across that that that that Sahara Desert and her and her church had had kicked her out had excommunicated her and she traveled um um all those miles miles across across the desert she was thoroughly thoroughly convinced that God was was was was was was was was was was moving was moving in a people again when when when through all the the difficulties she had and all the struggles she had where when she went she was thoroughly convinced about it and there was nothing there was nothing there was nothing that that that that that was going to stop her and I can say tonight that that a greater than Solomon is is is is is here tonight but but yet we always know that that that as soon as as you make a determination a determined step or DET or determination to where to where to where to where you'll seek God and and and and you'll and you'll get your answer Satan is is always there to to block the way he he'll be there he'll fight you tooth and elf for for for for everything he he he he he'll he'll he'll make you have a flat tire on the way to church he'll he'll he'll he'll he'll come and and put you down with sickness or he'll come and and fight you every every every single every single answer the way answer the way that he can but we have to purpose in in our hearts that there is nothing that is going to to to to to to stop us but but but but but but but but remember now that that that woman had that that that that Queen of Sheba had a lot of hindrances but but her faith her but her faith her faith didn't H have any she was determined that she was that she was going to go all the way that that that didn't matter it didn't matter if if if if thieves came up and stole and stole everything that that she had it didn't matter if all her camels died she was going to walk the rest of the way it doesn't matter what had happened or or or or or or or or or or or or what she was going to go through she was going to go all the way all the way tonight but but but and and so and so and so and so and so we know we know now that that that when we determine anything with God we have to we have to grab a hold to God and and hang on tight for dear life and we're going we're going to be to be like Jacob when we wrestle all night long and say and say I will not let go until you bless me I I I don't care I don't care if the doctor say there's no hope I don't care if the doctor say there's nothing there's nothing that that that that that you can do do do I I don't care if the bank's calling to for cloes on you I don't care I I don't care I don't care what whatever happens whatever happens you take a hold of God's word and and you hold on to it because it is our life it is our everything it is who we are as the bride of Christ so I don't care I don't care if we have to stand there like like Elisha with with those with those with those with those with those 400 prophets and come against him and and and Elijah could could stand on the Vindicated on the indicated word of the hour and not let go why because be because because God had promised it we have to determine in our hearts there's nothing there's nothing that's that that's that that's going to stop us why why why why because God God God has changed his mask and is now he's now poured he's now gone from from from the prophets of the Old Testament through through through through through through through Christ when he died on the cross to to to filling those people with the Holy Ghost to to now he was back in a prophet and now he is manifest ested the fullness of Christ in the bride of Christ the the fullness of Christ is now in in the bride in these last days why why so we can stand there in all confidence and in all and in all Assurance knowing who who who who we are just Ju Just as that Queen she might have marched across that desert for for months and months and months and months and and and yet and yet and yet and yet and and yet and yet she was marching with all conf and in all Assurance knowing that that that that that whatsoever that's whatsoever she asked God would fulfill a and and so so so now so now we can see that that tonight through that that that through the bride of Christ there is a greater than than than Solomon is here he's standing here in in our midst midst tonight and we have all assurance and all authority knowing that whatsoever we have need of he is here to fulfill it but but and so we notice that um that uh um you look at this this this make this Valley full of full full of of of of ditches the the Israelites had had had had had come up had come up on a war against against um against the enemy I I don't I don't remember I I I don't remember who it was now but he he come up against the war and they got out in the middle of that desert and realized they didn't have any water and they were dying a thirst so they went and got the prophet and they asked him and he and he said bring me a Minal a ministrel and he and and as they began to play he began to pray about it and and God revealed to him said said said said you dig you dig these valleys this Valley full of ditches and and and so and and so and so and so and so and so I would imagine that that that that they all grabbed shovels and they started digging and and and then they dug some more and dug some more and dug some more and brother bam said said said brother bam said that they went to digg and and some of them said well I've got the Digger the deeper you go the more water you're you're you're the the more water you're going to have that's the thing tonight get to dig in some ditches so the Holy Ghost can travel through it that water come that water come from that rock that was in the desert out there that had that had been smitten in the days of Moses it was still there and it's still here tonight that same rock that the children of Israel of of Israel had drank from he was that Rock God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish a perishing people from the smitten Rock lived and he is the smitten Rock tonight to a perishing people the only hope of Life Of Life Of Life of life that there is is a perfect type there there he was and and and so and so and so and and and and so we notice that the children of Israel you know and I don't know if if any of y'all have ever dug out there in the desert it is not not like it is not like it is not like like like like like they can here here we have Clay and it's somewhat easy easy to dig but out there it's it's it's the ground is like rock and you and you you dig and you dig and you dig and and and and and yet it seems like every shovel full you hit a boulder the size of a Volkswagen I've done it but but yet those people out in that desert they they were a desperate people they were a perishing people where where where where they said we have to dig or we will die and they dug all night long and and and and the next thing you know no no they got they got a foot deep and they kept digging and digging and next thing you know they got they got two feet deep and they kept digging and diging brother brandom said said as much as much as you're as you are willing are willing to dig that is as much as as as you're able to get out so if you dig down a shovel full you'll get a shovel full full of full of water if you dig down if if if if you're willing to um Dig Down uh um 10 ft you'll get 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 50 ft of water it's all in how much and it's all in how much you you decide to dig but but they just kept on digging and and digging and and next thing you know they started to dig them doubts out they they begin to see see see see where it says what it says what it says well I've got I've I've got issu I've got issues with with with with my finances and they just dug it on out and they said he said well I I I'm getting sick tonight and I just they just dug it on out and they said well well my children are starting to stray and they just dug it on out and they said and they said hey well said well well my children are are sick tonight and and and one has this and one has that you just diging on out why why why why because we as the bride of Christ we can stand there in in in all assurance and in all confidence knowing that what that God has given us that has God has given us has given us all the authority and all the power and all you have to do is take God at his word and dig tonight if if God says dig then we dig if he says if he says to go to to to to to to go and and and and jump off a cliff we'll go jump off a cliff why because God has God has has promised us us in these in these last days why because God told told told told Abraham to to to to sacrifice Isaac and God and and and and Abraham was was was was was willing to hold God to his promise that Isaac that Isaac was was was is is his his his that Isaac was his promise seed so so if Abraham SL him God was obligated to raise him back up so we we can stand here we can stand here in all confidence and in all Assurance knowing that God will keep his word so so so so so so so we noticed that that that that maybe they dug all night long I I don't know and and maybe they went to bed you know just just an hour and an hour be be be for daylight or something but yet but yet but yet they they all went to bed exhausted and they a hear hear no rain they they a hear no they Ain see no clouds they a feel no wind there's no Thunder no lightning but they woke up that next morning and there was water there and and there was water there there was water water water sitting there so so so so don't we worry about about how about about about how about how how how how God is how God is is is going to do it we can we can stand there and and with all confidence and all Assurance knowing that God will do it why because because God always always will will keep his word and and and if and and if we find out that that that we're we're just a little sick tonight we we're a little bit tired and and May and and maybe and maybe we're just discouraged and thinking that that that that we're all alone that we're all that that we're all alone we can just rise on our feet and and take God's word and in all confidence and all Assurance apply it apply it to our lives and and and and and and and and and watch God and watch God God God watch God go to work um um so brother brother brother brand brother bam said brother Hallelujah I say this that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and and and yesterday today and forever and every demon knows and every demon knows knows every demon knows the authority of God and it don't really have to be anything else but to believe on the Jesus Christ with with all of with with all all of with all of your heart and and and and be healed that's right that's right do you believe this he said oh men women brothers and sisters why why can't we now with one Accord say Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus I I I believe you and I'm accepting you oh how glorious it it would be how how wonderful listen he he he said he he said listen he said listen the apostolic way of holding a me of holding a healing meeting is be preaching and seeing what God is doing and then speaking it out where you find Faith men and women men and women men and women to believe to have faith in God to believe on God and God will grant it then them he said he said Do you believe it he said he and then he said he said we're thinking we're thinking of the Centurion now when he said I'm not worthy that you should come you should come that you should come on under my my my roof and he said just speak the word for I am one on Authority and and and you and you have have authority and and whatsoever you say is going to just be be be be in whatsoever is going to be just that way so so so so we so if you look at that at that at that at at that at that at that Centurion where he he was a he was a man in the military he snapped his fingers and and and they and they brought up to him I seen a thing the other day where where where Biden was was was in the Oval Office and he pushed a button and within two seconds and somebody brought him a chocolate ice cream cone and and and it may it made me think it made me think think of of of of that Centurion where where he snapped his fingers and they bought him a chocolate ice cream come on on or something I don't know but he he was a man with authority and with and whatsoever he said went but but yet but yet he recognized the authority and the power and the power that that that that that that was was in Jesus Christ where he may have commended man but but Jesus but Jesus was what Jesus with just a word with just a word could could could could could command the demons to leave and and to be cast out and and yet and and and yet we as the bride of Christ we have all authority we have all power we can snap our fingers and and with the simple word the demons the demons have to leave they have to be cast out why because we have the same Authority that Christ had you you look at the at these police cars are these the these these police out there they have they have they have they have they have they have no no power over anything you you you might be bigger and stronger and and be able to out wrestle the guy or something I don't know but but but what what the police have is they have the authority to to tell you and they are backed they are backed they are backed by the entire by the they they are backed they are backed they are backed by the entire by by the entire the city what they say goes why why why and they have and and the and the and the police the these police have authority and if they are and if they are ever if if if they are if they are ever ever ever if they're ever in a situation in a in a situation where whe they're having to take a take a guy out where that has been a a seral killer or or or or or or or he's IND dangering he's endangering other people they have they they they they will call in and dispatch and ask him say say say say say what do we do and and and that police chief that police chief will will will will will get on the radio and say you have been authorized to use deadly force so so so so when so so when we as the bride of Christ are coming are that have come up that have have come have come up against these Demons of of of unbelief and and of Doubt of sickness of of of of whatever of whatever of whatever it it may we have been authorized to use deadly force we have been authorized we have been granted the authority and and and we can stand up and all confidence and and in all assurance and cast and and and cast that that that that demon out out out out out in in our lives why through Mark through through through through through through Mark 16 it said whatsoever whatsoever ye shall believe Amen in 2 Kings 13:14 says now Elisha was Fallen was Fallen sick of of his sickness a and and whereof whereof whereof whereof he he died and joash joash the the king the the the king of Israel had come down unto him and and and and wept over his face and said oh my father my father The Chariot of of of Israel and the horsman thereof and Elisha said said said said unto him take bow and arrows and he took unto him bow and arrows and he said to the to to the he said to the king of Israel put thine hand upon the bow and he put his hand upon it and Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands and he said open the window open the window e Eastward in the open and Elisha said shoot and he shot and the arrow and the arrow of the Lord's and he said the arrow of the Lord's of the Lord's of the Lord's deliverance and the arrow and the arrow of deliverance from from from Syria for for for Thou shalt Smite Smite the syrians of of APAC till thou Hast consumed them and he said and he said take the arrows and he took them and he said on unto the king of Israel Smite upon the ground and he smok smoke Thrice and he stayed his and he stayed and the man of God was wroth was wroth with him and he said thou should have smitten five or six times till thou Hast till thou Hast till then thou then then hast thou then then hast thou smitten smitten sp sp s in Syria Syria till thou Hast Hast till thou Hast Hast consumed it whereas now Thou shalt Thou shalt Smite Syria Syria but but Thrice and when we as the bride of Christ can sit there and say when God is saying and and so God God is s there telling us don't don't just ask don't just ask ask ask ask ask don't just ask for for for the small things we can ask we can ask we can ask we can ask we can ask for for for big things could you imagine Sam Walton's son the um owner owner of of of of of of of Walmart walk into Walmart and say um you know can can I have a have a bag of chips or or or or or how about no how about a pack of gum but no but yet but but but yet but yet he doesn't realize that his daddy owns it all he if Sam bton decides Sam balton's son decides that he wants a stake he can watch March March back there grab just just just just just whatever just whatever in the world he wants throws in a cart and marches out he doesn't have to pay for it he doesn't have to sit there and beg for it he doesn't have to do anything why because his daddy owns it all and when we as the bride of Christ can sit here and and realize just exactly what God has has done for us in these last days where where where where where where he has sent us a prophet and the son of man and the son of man uh the son of of man man of man of man Ministry is now living and abiding in in the bride of Christ we can stand here in all authority and and all confidence to say and say give me my Mountain why because we are going back we are going back we're going back to to to to and and and and and and Ed and Edom like like like like condition where where where where where Adam and Eve had Eve had a perfect Reign where neither death nor sorrow but but but but but but but but but but when they when they fell God had to drive them from it but but now he's driving us he's he's driving us back back back back to it and and we are coming forth on on on under that that that that Edom that Edom that that Edom that Edom condition again where where where where we have the power of the spoken word where Adam can set there and say and say peace be still to the wind he he could he could pluck up a tree and move it somewhere else oh why why because he was he was a Son of God fully in in in in his in his position and he had all assurance and and all confidence of it but yet we as the bride of Christ now we are coming back back back back back back to to that again to to to to that condition once again through the son of man the son of man of men Ministry and not as a weak helpless bride not like the not not not like the first Eve but but but we stand forth as the most powerful as the most powerful Army to to to to ever to ever march across the face of the world why why because we have come into our position and we're realizing just exactly just exactly exactly exactly who we are we we are we we are Awakening out and that cry has H has gone has has gone forth that the brid is coming and this virtuous bride we have she has she has stood she has stood up on on on on on on on on she has stood up on her feet and she has made she has made herself ready she's she's trim her lamps and she's standing forth and and she and she's now we are now marching out to to to to to meet the bridegroom why she is seeing who she is just exactly we're not we're not just some little downtrodden beggar on the side of the street why we are the Bride of Jesus Christ she has stepped into the vision of seen what God has had for her since since the foundation of the world he doesn't see us see us see us see us as as as the world sees the world sees me as as the owner of mlar of McClaren construction and he the world sees me as a carpenter but God doesn't see me as who I am God doesn't see me as a failure or or as a or or or or as a beggar on the street or a bum he he he never seen us as a sinner he's he's never seen us as as what we are that were in our past as as drunks on the street or a druggie or as an addict or or or or or as a little Dr trotten down down down as a little trotten down down down nobody he sees us as a spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ and we have to take his mind in order to get to get to get to get to get to get anywhere and now we have seen who we are and we are standing forth and we are realizing just exactly who we are if we can only catch if we can only realize and catch the vision that healing is of the children's bread and and he's not going to do one thing for somebody and not somebody not a different thing a different thing for somebody else and the Bible says Bible says says says say says says says if if if God being a good father father and and and you ask him you ask him of bread and he and he gives you a scorpion he he they said that God's not going to do that why because because it is healing is of the children's bread Deliverance is is of the children's bread salvation is of the children's bread the Holy Ghost is of the children's bread whatsoever we have need of need of of of of of of whatsoever we have need here here he here he here tonight is of the children's bread it's the same the
