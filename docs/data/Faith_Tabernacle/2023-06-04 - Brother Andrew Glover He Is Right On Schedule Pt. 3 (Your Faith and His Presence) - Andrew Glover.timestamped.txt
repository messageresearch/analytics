[41:10] a man amen Matthew the 12th chapter and
[41:13] the 42nd verse I don't know brother
[41:15] Judith it'd be possible to give me a
[41:16] little bit of highs in this microphone I
[41:18] got a lot of loaves in it Matthew 12 and
[41:22] verse 42.
[41:24] Matthew 12 and 42. Jesus you're speaking
[41:29] he says the queen of the South shall
[41:32] rise up in the Judgment with this
[41:33] generation and shall condemn it for she
[41:37] came from the uttermost parts of the
[41:38] earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon now
[41:42] those of you that studied this know that
[41:43] she had heard that there was a god a
[41:45] living God and she was tired of the Dead
[41:47] tradition so she left the tradition to
[41:50] go find the Living God and she got there
[41:52] and it says and she heard the wisdom of
[41:55] Solomon but I want to speak here from
[41:57] this last portion of this scripture says
[41:59] and behold a greater than Solomon is
[42:03] here amen Behold a greater than Solomon
[42:06] is here and if we'll ask the Lord to add
[42:08] His blessings you can be seated tonight
[42:10] that's good there where you've got it
[42:12] that'll be good thank you buddy amen we
[42:14] want to tonight maybe by the help of the
[42:16] Lord just to continue here on this
[42:18] thought and maybe speaking to you he is
[42:20] right on schedule how many beliefs he's
[42:22] right on schedule amen and tonight I
[42:25] want to maybe take another portion of
[42:26] this and maybe say it like this your
[42:29] faith and his presence amen your faith
[42:32] and his presence we were speaking this
[42:34] morning on the time of trouble is the
[42:36] time of his presence and how that
[42:38] whenever trouble sets in that's not the
[42:41] time to forget who you are to forget the
[42:43] god you're serving but that's the time
[42:45] to remember without the trouble you
[42:47] would not know his presence so in the
[42:49] time of trouble he is a very present
[42:51] help in the time of trouble now
[42:53] we found that the word schedule there
[42:56] actually means to arrange or to plan an
[42:58] event to take place at a particular time
[43:01] and we found that our God as we've
[43:03] already said he is in on time end time
[43:05] every time God now in the message the
[43:08] Forgotten beatitude brother Brahm says
[43:09] it like this he said when troubles it in
[43:11] Jesus come and showed the Messiah that
[43:13] he was the Messiah he said but then
[43:15] something went wrong and John had
[43:17] introduced the Messiah with a fan in his
[43:19] hand he was going to burn up the chaff
[43:21] but he found out that the works of Jesus
[43:23] he was meek and lowly so it worried him
[43:25] he didn't know what to say and he
[43:27] thought now there's something wrong here
[43:28] somewhere he said it seemed that he had
[43:31] believed the wrong thing it seemed like
[43:32] it wasn't working right and there's many
[43:35] times that we think that too see it
[43:37] isn't working right but it is working
[43:39] right how many can agree it is working
[43:41] right
[43:43] as long he said it's working right as
[43:45] long as we know amen that he is here
[43:48] then what difference does it make as
[43:51] long as we know that he is here then
[43:53] what difference does it make it's
[43:54] working right maybe it isn't working
[43:56] according uh to the way we think it
[43:58] ought to work but it's according to the
[44:00] way God wants it to work you know excuse
[44:03] me amen and I'm thankful to know tonight
[44:05] that he is here how many can say I'm
[44:07] thankful to know that he is here amen
[44:09] Jesus Christ the son of God he is here
[44:11] tonight now
[44:13] Daniel 12
[44:15] and verse 1 we were reading it this
[44:16] morning he said and at that time
[44:19] that time stand up
[44:20] it's withstanding for the for the
[44:22] children of our people and there shall
[44:24] be a time of trouble such as never was
[44:26] since there was a time even to that same
[44:28] time and at that time now watch this
[44:31] there shall be a time of trouble such as
[44:33] never was since there was a nation even
[44:35] to that same time and at the time thy
[44:38] people shall be delivered every one that
[44:40] should be found written in the book now
[44:42] I want you to notice here in Daniel 12 1
[44:44] he's using the word time right a
[44:46] specific time he's saying at that time
[44:48] at the same time at that time in the
[44:51] second verse and many of them shall
[44:52] sleep in the dust of the earth and shall
[44:54] awake amen
[44:57] some to everlasting life and some to
[44:59] shame and everlasting contempt now they
[45:02] still be wise shall shine as the
[45:04] brightness of the firmament and they
[45:05] turn many to righteousness as the Stars
[45:07] forever and ever but thou oat Daniel
[45:09] shut up the words and seal the book even
[45:12] to the time of the End Amen for many
[45:15] shall run to and fro and knowledge shall
[45:17] be increased so we know amen there's
[45:19] coming a time of trouble right there's
[45:21] coming a specific time and at that same
[45:23] time
[45:25] he says y'all forgive me uh he says it
[45:28] like this he said but even to the time
[45:30] of the end so now we realize amen that
[45:32] we have now come to the time of the end
[45:35] in Revelation 1 1 he said the Revelation
[45:37] Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to
[45:39] show unto the servants the things which
[45:41] must certainly come to pass he sent and
[45:43] signified it
[45:44] by his Angel unto his servant John who
[45:47] bear record of the word of God and of
[45:49] the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[45:51] the things that he saw in verse 3 and
[45:53] said blessed is he that readeth and they
[45:56] that hear the words of this prophecy and
[46:00] keep those things which are written
[46:01] they're in for the time is at hand amen
[46:05] so there's come in a time of trouble
[46:06] we're in the time of trouble right amen
[46:08] there'll be a time of trouble such as
[46:10] never since a nation and we're in that
[46:12] time amen but now the time is at hand
[46:15] now Abraham picks us up in the church
[46:17] age book
[46:18] thank you brother
[46:22] sometimes I don't drink it so these guys
[46:24] don't bring it and then I need it and
[46:25] they bring it so amen it's it's me it's
[46:28] not them I think they don't want me to
[46:29] knock it over again I've knocked it over
[46:31] too many times amen but but when you
[46:33] look here in the church age book he said
[46:35] the time is at hand
[46:37] he said the time was not at hand
[46:38] previously in the wisdom and the economy
[46:42] of God he said this Mighty Revelation
[46:43] though fully known to God it could not
[46:46] come forth hitherto he said thus we
[46:48] learn immediately learn a principle that
[46:50] the revelation of God for each age can
[46:53] come in that age only and at a specific
[46:55] time so now we're learning a principle
[46:58] from God that the revelation of God for
[47:00] each age can come in that age and come
[47:03] only at a specific time he says look at
[47:05] the history of Israel the revelation of
[47:07] God to Moses came only at a specific
[47:10] time of history and even more
[47:12] specifically it came as the people Cried
[47:14] unto God he said Jesus himself came at
[47:17] the fullness of time he being the
[47:19] complete Revelation the godhead he said
[47:21] and in this age laodicea he said the
[47:24] revelation of God will come in its due
[47:26] time so amen the Revelation can only
[47:28] come at a specific time then it will
[47:31] come in its due time he said now watch
[47:33] it will not falter and neither will it
[47:35] be premature so in the Revelation comes
[47:38] it will not be coming too early but it
[47:40] will not be coming too late it'll be
[47:42] coming right on time see amen think on
[47:45] this and heed it for we are in the end
[47:47] time today and pick up your pen and
[47:49] write brother remember to receive an
[47:50] inspiration and he said those in the
[47:52] bride will do only his will no one can
[47:54] make them do otherwise he said they have
[47:57] the saith the Lord or they keep still
[47:58] how many can say Amen that we have thus
[48:01] saith the Lord or we keep still amen
[48:04] they will have the Sith Lord
[48:07] or they will keep still he said they
[48:09] know that it has to be God in them doing
[48:11] the works amen fulfilling his own word
[48:14] see he did not complete all his work
[48:16] while in his Earthly Ministry amen so
[48:19] now he works in and through the bride so
[48:21] amen there was a time coming that he 33
[48:23] and a half years amen that he would he
[48:26] would not complete everything in those
[48:28] 33 and a half years but he would
[48:29] actually come to a Time amen that he
[48:31] would finish his work through his bride
[48:33] see she knows that for it was not yet
[48:36] time for him to do certain things amen
[48:38] that he must do now but I love this he
[48:40] will now fulfill through the bride amen
[48:43] the work which he has left for this
[48:45] specific time amen so we have not
[48:47] arrived too early and we've not showed
[48:50] up too late amen we are right on time
[48:53] with the schedule of God Amen the
[48:55] prophet said I believe that we're living
[48:57] in the last days and I believe amen that
[48:59] it is a timely message that should be
[49:01] approached amen reverently in this day
[49:04] again he said the Holy Spirit led us to
[49:06] say last night that we are not way back
[49:08] behind and neither are we Advanced we're
[49:10] just exactly on schedule Amen in this
[49:13] timely message amen that we have today
[49:15] in the sixth full purpose of Gabriel he
[49:18] said the end times shall reveal it the
[49:20] last Church age right amen he said the
[49:22] mystery the things that the church
[49:24] world has batted their eyes had and says
[49:27] it's nonsense the mystery of who Jesus
[49:29] Christ was he was not a third person he
[49:31] was not the second person not the third
[49:33] person but he was the person of God see
[49:35] all these other mysteries of God will be
[49:37] revealed amen because it's wrote here in
[49:40] this book and will be revealed to the
[49:43] end time generation so the revelation of
[49:45] the word is coming at a specific time in
[49:48] due time to a bride who will be will be
[49:51] the finishing part of the ministry of
[49:53] Jesus Christ amen and it will be
[49:55] revealed in the end time generation they
[49:57] can no more see it in seminaries and
[49:59] schools in the nomination amen then the
[50:02] Jews could see Jesus being the Messiah
[50:04] he said no wonder they try to think
[50:06] you're crazy no wonder they think you're
[50:07] foolish no wonder they can't understand
[50:09] why you don't cluck up with them amen
[50:12] see because there's a power and a vision
[50:14] behind it it's a word of God that's been
[50:16] revealed to get the church in order for
[50:18] the Rapture amen and the going home so
[50:21] the next thing on the schedule for the
[50:23] church is the rapture and the going home
[50:26] the next thing amen is the changing of
[50:29] your body right after Abraham amen and
[50:31] Sarah received the message the next
[50:33] thing was a change Amen to receive the
[50:36] promised son and I believe here tonight
[50:38] that there's a bride amen who is the
[50:40] part of this end time word she's a part
[50:42] of this end time generation and she has
[50:45] not come on the scene too late and she
[50:47] has not come on the scene too early amen
[50:50] she is right on time now in the in 1961
[50:53] brother Ben preaches to Chicago Illinois
[50:55] and he preaches a series of sermons and
[50:57] maybe if you get time to listen to him
[50:58] it's the end of April 1961 and he starts
[51:02] those meetings off with Abraham and his
[51:04] seed after him then he goes into the
[51:06] greatest news flash in history and he
[51:08] goes into the godhead explained the
[51:09] forgotten the attitude Makai the prophet
[51:11] only believe getting in the spirit one
[51:13] of the meanest men in town amen and then
[51:15] he finishes it with the uncertain sound
[51:17] now if you go back and study those two
[51:19] previous sermons to the Forgotten be
[51:21] attitude he will preach Abraham and his
[51:24] seat after him and then he'll preach the
[51:27] greatest news flash in history and what
[51:29] he's doing there is he's turning corners
[51:31] or showing you the Junctions
[51:33] he's showing you amen he says in
[51:35] forgotten beatitude is this okay amen he
[51:38] says in the forgotten the attitude he
[51:39] said we found out that every Junction
[51:41] he'd taken Abraham he took his seat so
[51:44] whatever he done to Abraham he did do
[51:46] his seed through justification through
[51:48] sanctification through the baptism of
[51:50] the Holy Ghost amen through the placing
[51:52] of a son he said and then God came in
[51:55] human flesh and turned his back to
[51:57] Sarah's tent and told what she was
[51:59] thinking in her heart he said now don't
[52:01] get scared he's right on schedule he's
[52:03] here amen don't be offended in him amen
[52:06] blessed are they who's not offended in
[52:07] me if he was here to speak tonight he
[52:10] would say the same thing he's right on
[52:12] schedule see the prophet said there'll
[52:14] be a time it'll not be day or night but
[52:17] in the evening time it shall be light
[52:20] we can say this day this scripture is
[52:22] fulfilled right in the evening time it
[52:25] shall be light amen he's right on
[52:27] schedule he said he's done come through
[52:29] justification Luther age amen
[52:31] sanctification Wesley H Pentecostal age
[52:34] then placed his gifts in the church and
[52:36] now has appeared somebody say appeared
[52:38] amen he's now appeared to us in our
[52:41] flesh amen as Jesus said he would so in
[52:44] other words amen there were two events
[52:46] on his schedule and that was his
[52:48] appearing and his coming see this
[52:51] evening church we're not looking for his
[52:53] appearing we are living in the hour of
[52:55] his appearing so what we are looking for
[52:57] is just coming he said so don't be
[53:00] offended in him he's right on time he
[53:02] said John get out of that jail get out
[53:04] of that organization amen don't believe

[53:15] the evening time now when brother bam
[53:17] tells this he goes in in the Forgotten
[53:19] be attitude and he actually stops and
[53:21] tells the testimony very powerful he
[53:23] says there was a lady come down the
[53:24] other day from his hind City speaking of
[53:26] Zion Illinois and he said when she come
[53:28] down she had a little baby he said and
[53:30] it was born with a foot and he said that
[53:32] foot was hanging up like this he said he
[53:34] couldn't get his foot down so she said
[53:36] if I can only see brother Brandon put
[53:38] his hands on the baby amen that foot
[53:40] will drop down he said why she brought
[53:42] it shoes to wear home and everything yes
[53:44] sir so when she's coming brother Shema
[53:46] she's coming with faith amen that when
[53:48] brother Branham touches that baby the
[53:50] baby's instantly going to be healed and
[53:52] he's actually going to wear the shoes
[53:53] home that she's carrying with him he
[53:55] said so I was praying that but the
[53:57] Tabernacle preaching there and he said
[53:58] we were going to have foot washing and
[54:00] communion my son come in and said dad

[54:19] your hands on this baby that the leg is
[54:21] going to come straight see it's going to
[54:23] be all right I said do you require me to
[54:26] find a vision from the Lord see she
[54:28] believes the leg is going to come
[54:29] straight but do you require me to find a
[54:32] vision from the Lord she said no sir
[54:34] just lay your hands on on her I said all
[54:36] right I'll do that so I laid my hands
[54:38] upon it prayed for it and went on in the
[54:40] room he said next day I was in the
[54:42] office and somebody come running here
[54:44] and she said brother Branham said
[54:45] something has went wrong so here they
[54:47] come back the next day amen and said
[54:49] something has went wrong now that's the
[54:51] same words amen that John was using when
[54:53] he was in the jail he was saying
[54:55] something has gone wrong something has
[54:57] changed amen he said something has went
[54:59] wrong I said what do you mean she said
[55:01] well the baby's leg is not down yet I
[55:03] said well what's that got to do with it
[55:05] amen she said well I believe brother
[55:07] Brandon if you lay your hands on my baby
[55:09] God would heal it said I believed it and
[55:12] said something went wrong somewhere she
[55:14] said maybe you better have a vision for
[55:16] it amen so yesterday she didn't need a
[55:19] vision amen but today she needs a vision
[55:21] what changed amen what changed between
[55:23] yesterday and today he said no no
[55:26] there's nothing wrong no not a thing
[55:28] wrong the only thing wrong is you oh my
[55:31] amen there was nothing wrong with the
[55:33] prayer there was nothing wrong with the
[55:35] Lord there was nothing wrong with his
[55:37] word there was nothing wrong with his
[55:38] Prophet amen the thing that was wrong
[55:40] was her he said see I said you just
[55:43] believe it she said well one thing I
[55:45] asked brother Branham amen do you think
[55:46] it's God's will for my baby to be
[55:48] crippled I said I do not believe it's
[55:50] God's will she said that's all I wanted
[55:53] you to save out of there she went in a
[55:55] few days they called up and now the
[55:57] baby's leg is back to normal see amen we
[56:00] just get frustrated amen everything's
[56:02] running all right it's running according
[56:04] to the time
[56:06] well somebody shout amen or hallelujah
[56:09] or something amen everything is running
[56:11] right according amen yesterday she
[56:14] didn't need a vision amen but today she
[56:16] needs a vision amen it wasn't that she
[56:18] needed a vision what she needed was to
[56:20] see a manifestation amen of the faith
[56:23] that was in her heart and when she did
[56:25] not see it as fast as she thought she
[56:27] should have seen it amen then all of a
[56:29] sudden she needed a vision amen but the
[56:31] prophet said no he was just as good then
[56:33] as he is right now he had a specific
[56:36] time that the baby's leg was going to
[56:38] come normal then comes from the
[56:40] following service
[56:43] he's hoping the sermon and he said now
[56:45] the sister from Zion there with a little
[56:46] baby
[56:47] see what God did for one of those drawed
[56:49] up plagues you see what he does for
[56:51] years he's still God Amen he's right on
[56:53] schedule he said now here's where I want
[56:55] to preach to you for a few moments this
[56:56] afternoon the only thing for us to do
[56:59] amen is just schedule our faith with his
[57:02] being here and it'll happen amen the
[57:05] only thing for us to do is to schedule
[57:07] our faith with his being here and it
[57:10] will happen you say his being here yes
[57:13] because God has always been here in some
[57:16] form in the message Hebrews chapter 7
[57:18] part 1 he said God has always been on
[57:21] the earth God has never left the Earth
[57:23] see if he'd ever leave the earth I don't
[57:25] want to be no more of it amen because
[57:27] God has always been here in some form if
[57:31] the children of Israel in the wilderness
[57:32] coming out of Egypt he was in the form
[57:34] of a light he spoke to Abraham in the
[57:36] form of a man he spoke to Moses in the
[57:39] form of a man amen he spoke to the
[57:41] church in the form of a man and that was
[57:43] his son Christ Jesus and he is speaking
[57:46] to his church today Amen to the anointed
[57:49] Church of the Living God Amen to the
[57:51] vessels of clay see God is still
[57:53] speaking amen and the world sees Jesus
[57:56] as you present him see your life tells
[57:59] what you are so this evening friends we
[58:01] believe amen the report of the Lord that
[58:04] he promised Amen to be with us but we've
[58:06] got to figure out what form that he
[58:08] promised to be with us in amen and the
[58:11] form that he promised to be with the sin
[58:13] is the form of the Holy Spirit he said
[58:16] see we know that he promised to be with
[58:17] us in the form of the holy spirit amen
[58:20] come to the end of the world Amen to the
[58:23] End of the Age so from the beginning to
[58:26] the end he has promised to be with his
[58:28] church he has promised to bless his
[58:30] church he has promised to provide for
[58:32] his church amen that you can only
[58:34] receive the blessings and the provisions
[58:36] when you can identify the form that he's
[58:38] in when he is giving out the blessings
[58:41] and the provision look if you're looking
[58:43] for a blessing and a provision amen from
[58:45] a natural Ark today you're not going to
[58:47] find it because that's not the form he
[58:50] promised to be here in today if you're
[58:52] looking for the provisions and the
[58:54] blessings amen by taking the literal
[58:56] blood of the Lamb putting it on your
[58:57] door you're not going to receive the
[58:59] benefit and the blessing of the token
[59:01] because that's not the form that he
[59:04] promised to be here today but he did
[59:06] promise to be here in some form because
[59:08] he always appears in some form
[59:12] now in The Book of Mark 16 the ninth
[59:15] chapter 16 chapter and the ninth verse
[59:18] the Bible said when Jesus was risen
[59:20] early the first day of the week he
[59:21] appeared first to marry Magdalena out of
[59:23] whom he cast Seven Devils and she went
[59:26] and told them that he had been with him
[59:27] as they mourned and wept and they when
[59:29] they heard that he was alive and seen
[59:31] her seen of her believe not after then
[59:33] he appeared in another form somebody say
[59:35] he appeared in another form
[59:37] he appeared in another form amen unto
[59:40] the two that of them as they walked and
[59:43] went into the country and they went and
[59:45] told it unto the residue and neither
[59:47] believe they them so here he appears in
[59:50] one form in verse 9 then in verse 12 it
[59:52] says he appears in another form in
[59:54] Philippians 2 and verse 5 Paul said let
[59:57] this mind be in you which was also in
[59:59] Christ Jesus amen who being in the form
[1:00:02] of God Amen thought it not robbery to be
[1:00:05] equal with God Amen but made himself of
[1:00:07] no reputation took upon him the form of
[1:00:10] a servant and was made in the likeness
[1:00:13] of them and being found in fashion as a
[1:00:15] man he humbled himself and became
[1:00:18] obedient unto death amen even the death
[1:00:21] of the Cross amen wherefore God also
[1:00:24] hath highly exalted him and given him a
[1:00:26] name which is above every name that at
[1:00:29] the name of Jesus every knee should bow
[1:00:31] of things in heaven of things in Earth
[1:00:33] and things under the Earth and that
[1:00:35] every tongue should confess that Jesus
[1:00:37] Christ is Lord to the glory of God the
[1:00:40] father now see he appeared Amen in the
[1:00:43] form of God he then appeared in the form
[1:00:45] of a servant and the Bible says that
[1:00:47] word form is the form by which a person
[1:00:50] or faint strikes the vision it is the
[1:00:53] external appearance so when one time
[1:00:55] you've seen him you've seen him in the
[1:00:56] form of God when you look in John 1 14
[1:00:59] you see him in the form of a servant
[1:01:01] right because he come emptied himself
[1:01:03] out amen and took on the form of a
[1:01:05] servant in Colossians 1 15. he said who
[1:01:08] is the image of the invisible God Amen
[1:01:11] is the firstborn of every creature now
[1:01:14] we believe here tonight that the Jehovah
[1:01:16] of the old is the Jesus of the new how
[1:01:19] many agrees amen that the Jehovah of the
[1:01:21] old is the Jesus of the new so when you
[1:01:24] sing Jehovah you were seeing a
[1:01:26] pre-figure of the form of Jesus and when
[1:01:28] you saw Jesus you were seen amen the
[1:01:31] form of Jehovah amen because all that
[1:01:34] was in God he poured into Christ and all
[1:01:37] that was in Christ is poured into the
[1:01:39] church amen so when you see this word a
[1:01:42] amen form it means in more faith which
[1:01:45] means the Unseen was made visible amen
[1:01:48] when you seen the form you were seeing
[1:01:50] the Unseen made visible amen we know
[1:01:53] it's there but it cannot be seen but yet
[1:01:55] we know that it's there amen and when he
[1:01:57] changed his form of the amorphy which
[1:02:00] mean that he changed from Supernatural
[1:02:02] to Natural
[1:02:04] now watch a prophet break it down he
[1:02:07] just changed his mask in other words
[1:02:10] it's like a drama he was acting and in
[1:02:12] the Greek when they would change their
[1:02:13] Mass maybe one play one player might
[1:02:15] have acted in several different parts
[1:02:17] amen so we find them that God never
[1:02:19] changes his nature he only changes his
[1:02:23] form he said it was God formed in a man
[1:02:25] called a prophet and the word of the
[1:02:27] Lord came to this man so it wasn't the
[1:02:28] prophet no the prophet was the veil but
[1:02:31] the Word was God Amen the man's word
[1:02:33] won't act like that do you see what I
[1:02:35] mean it cannot act in that manner but
[1:02:37] potentially it was God see he was the
[1:02:40] word of God in the form of a man called
[1:02:42] man notice he never changed his nature
[1:02:45] only his form he's the same yesterday
[1:02:48] today and forever so he did not change
[1:02:51] his nature when he come he's always that
[1:02:54] Prophet down to the age same thing the
[1:02:56] word the word the word the words he he
[1:02:58] cannot change his nature but he changed
[1:03:01] his form he just changed his mask only
[1:03:04] thing he done now watch this he said
[1:03:06] only thing he done was change his mask
[1:03:08] he said he went from Noah to Moses he
[1:03:10] went from Moses to David he went from
[1:03:13] David to Joseph on down until he come
[1:03:15] into the fullness of the godhead Molly
[1:03:17] so the presence of God was in Moses the
[1:03:20] presence of God was in Noah the presence
[1:03:23] of God was in David the presence of God
[1:03:25] was in Joseph the presence of God was in
[1:03:28] Paul amen the presence of God was in
[1:03:30] those men amen but it did not take on a
[1:03:33] form that we actually called God until
[1:03:35] it came into a man called Jesus and then
[1:03:38] we seen the fullness of the godhead
[1:03:40] bodily Amen dwelt in the man Christ
[1:03:42] Jesus it's the same God he said until
[1:03:45] finally it come down through Luther amen
[1:03:48] and Wesley and finally comes out into
[1:03:50] the complete amen then pray tell me
[1:03:52] where are we at tonight we are not in
[1:03:55] Luther's age we are not in Noah's age we
[1:03:57] are not in Wesley's age amen but we have
[1:04:00] come into the age of completion when
[1:04:02] there will be a bride upon the Earth
[1:04:03] Earth who would be here and who would be
[1:04:06] in position Amen to let the Lord change
[1:04:09] his mask and he would go from being
[1:04:11] bridegroom Amen to being right and
[1:04:13] failed in the bride well glory to God he
[1:04:17] said just before it comes a prophet
[1:04:19] arises again he said and they identified

[1:04:26] here tonight in the form of the Holy
[1:04:27] Spirit he changed his form and he came

[1:04:38] human flesh he said see men and women of
[1:04:41] all walks of life amen showing that he's

[1:12:28] said then we come down here to talk to
[1:12:30] you why he said raised up in Indiana
[1:12:31] down here in Florida he said well then
[1:12:34] when we come together to talk one
[1:12:35] another he said we've been miles apart
[1:12:37] but God knowed you since before you was
[1:12:39] born God knows you since before you was
[1:12:42] born and he knowed me since before I was
[1:12:45] born come on Church he's going back into
[1:12:47] Bloodlines and saying God knows you and
[1:12:51] God knowed me before he was ever even
[1:12:52] born
[1:12:54] now don't think I'm crazy but can I
[1:12:56] preach for a second
[1:12:59] and it's time he had a schedule that the
[1:13:02] prophet with me fat woman
[1:13:06] well glory to God he had a time he had a
[1:13:11] schedule that a prophet would be there
[1:13:13] and she would be there he said you're
[1:13:15] from in Florida I'm up in Indiana he
[1:13:17] said we've been knowing god since before
[1:13:18] he was born he snowed us he said now I
[1:13:21] believe you're a Christian because your
[1:13:23] spirit seems to be welcome when a
[1:13:25] Christian comes there's just something
[1:13:26] that just says welcome you see and I get
[1:13:29] that right away it's the Holy Spirit he
[1:13:31] said but now if me knowing nothing of
[1:13:33] you and miles apart of your life he said
[1:13:36] the Holy Spirit would have to do
[1:13:39] something that would make you know that
[1:13:40] the presence of his being is here amen
[1:13:43] if I have not known you for all these
[1:13:45] years and you have not known me for all
[1:13:48] of these years then in order for there
[1:13:49] to be a for there to be a manifestation
[1:13:52] to take place amen the holy spirit is
[1:13:55] going to have to do something Amen to
[1:13:57] let you know amen that the presence of
[1:14:00] his being is here in other words he's
[1:14:02] going to have to do something brother
[1:14:04] Terry to get your eyes off of me and
[1:14:06] realize it's not me but it's the son of
[1:14:08] man it's the revealing of Jesus Christ
[1:14:10] it's the presence of the discerner of
[1:14:13] the thoughts and intents of the heart of
[1:14:14] a man is on this platform he said then
[1:14:17] it would make you have more confidence
[1:14:18] than I told you the truth amen so when
[1:14:21] you recognize you as in the presence of
[1:14:24] his being it was a confidence that the
[1:14:26] prophet was telling you the truth why
[1:14:28] are you preaching about this presence
[1:14:29] amen because the presence of the Lord
[1:14:31] amen gives Faith amen the presence in
[1:14:34] the presence of the Lord there is
[1:14:36] fullness of joy in the presence of the
[1:14:38] Lord Brother Bob there is faith in the
[1:14:41] presence of the Lord there is healing in
[1:14:43] the presence of the Lord there is Joy
[1:14:44] what do you saying preacher I'm saying
[1:14:46] if there's ever been a time for somebody
[1:14:48] to declare amen the presence of Jesus
[1:14:51] Christ they've been hours a time to do
[1:14:53] it now is the time to say he is here
[1:14:58] the Holy Spirit he says moves out on the
[1:15:00] building speaks to whomever he will
[1:15:02] speak he said see they meant amen that
[1:15:04] Sovereign right then God brings the
[1:15:06] knowledge because it's a promise of God
[1:15:08] he said watch and the knowledge of God
[1:15:11] knowledge of God he said Sovereign also
[1:15:15] brings his presence down Among Us amen
[1:15:17] so when you have a knowledge you're in
[1:15:19] his presence it's a sovereign God he
[1:15:22] brings his presence down Among Us he
[1:15:24] said we should see it and rejoice you

[1:15:41] brother so and so didn't pray the prayer
[1:15:42] of faith or so and so see it's the
[1:15:45] presence of the Lord gave you Faith you
[1:15:47] see it then then he sent his word and he
[1:15:49] healed them the presence of the Lord is
[1:15:52] the giving of faith I love what he says
[1:15:54] in a true sound overlooked he said
[1:15:56] together thy servant and the servant
[1:15:58] bring him the word he said together we
[1:16:00] might be brought Amen to a closer
[1:16:02] realization of his appearing than ever
[1:16:05] before in our life
[1:16:07] in second Timothy 1 9 he said but it's
[1:16:10] 110 rather but it's now made manifest by
[1:16:13] what the appearing of Our Savior Jesus
[1:16:16] Christ who hath abolished death and
[1:16:18] brought life and immortality to lie to
[1:16:20] the gospel the Bible speaks of his
[1:16:23] appearing you know what his appearing is
[1:16:25] his appearing is different than his
[1:16:27] coming the proud of God said now there's
[1:16:29] a great big difference in the sign of
[1:16:30] Jesus appearing and then Jesus coming
[1:16:32] there's two different words see the
[1:16:35] appearing of the Lord and the coming of
[1:16:37] the Lord he said now the appearing of
[1:16:39] the Lord is now the appearing of the
[1:16:42] Lord is now when he is appearing in his
[1:16:45] people his Spirit working among them
[1:16:47] proven that it's him with him amen
[1:16:50] getting them ready for the Rapture his
[1:16:52] appearing is the preparing of the church
[1:16:55] for the Rapture amen it's for the
[1:16:57] catching away the coming of the Lord he
[1:16:59] said it's the appearing and then the
[1:17:01] coming from that time 62 Spokane
[1:17:03] Washington he said now's the appearing
[1:17:06] the coming will be soon amen the
[1:17:08] appearing is now he's appearing in the
[1:17:11] midst of us doing the works that he once
[1:17:13] did in his church he said now you're a
[1:17:15] part of the church by Grace you believe
[1:17:16] now watch a prophetic announcement amen

[1:21:02] make due use of the time that God come
[1:21:04] on you may not have another time to say
[1:21:06] Amen but God right now has given you a
[1:21:09] chance to say Amen you might not have

[1:21:13] feet and let the devil know whose side
[1:21:15] you're on but right now right here God
[1:21:17] is giving you another opportunity Amen
[1:21:20] to identify whose side you may never
[1:21:22] have another time Amen to clap your

[1:21:29] his name and to worship His presence you
[1:21:32] know what I think we're going to do I
[1:21:33] think we ought to kick this old formal
[1:21:35] devil back to the hell that it come out

[1:22:27] think it's time to have church don't you
[1:22:29] how many degrees it's time to have
[1:22:31] church I think it's time to forget what
[1:22:33] setting the thermostat's on it's time to
[1:22:36] forget who's here not here who thinks it

[1:28:49] the joy of yourself and the very minute
[1:28:51] you feeling slipping away that's the
[1:28:53] minute to start fighting to get it back
[1:28:54] the very minute you feel that coldness
[1:28:57] coming on you brother Sean that's the
[1:28:58] time to start fighting and saying oh no

[1:29:10] prayers I'll fight him in the third
[1:29:12] culture I'll find him in my office but I
[1:29:14] will not let the devil rob me of the
[1:29:16] blessing to the bride time of the age
[1:29:18] I'm living in it's the time that God has
[1:29:21] been waiting for Brother Matthew God has
[1:29:23] been waiting for this time he's been
[1:29:25] waiting for the time to get perfect
[1:29:27] faith in his word back in his perfect
[1:29:29] presence and watch something take place
[1:29:31] yeah the part of God said each night the
[1:29:33] holy spirit is trying to get you to the
[1:29:35] presence of his being here not the
[1:29:39] presence of a man he said see a man can
[1:29:41] only humble himself by gifts he can
[1:29:43] submit himself into a certain Realm of
[1:29:45] the spirit that can open God to you
[1:29:48] but it will never work until you
[1:29:51] yourself believe it and accept it and
[1:29:54] then it works see he said now watch see
[1:29:56] it's your faith so it takes you and I
[1:29:59] together with the Holy Spirit to bring
[1:30:02] these things to pass to let me Rejoice
[1:30:05] to let you rejoice that God is here and
[1:30:09] that he keeps his word
[1:30:11] this is the time for you to rejoice
[1:30:13] and for me to Rejoice that God is here
[1:30:17] and he keeps his word see then what is
[1:30:19] this time Amen brother brother Terry
[1:30:21] this is the time of the meeting of two
[1:30:24] omnipotent it's when two omnipotents are
[1:30:27] meeting the part of God so when when God
[1:30:28] and a Believer meet there's two
[1:30:31] omnipotents the patmosphere and I was
[1:30:33] going to choke it but I'm going to say
[1:30:35] it amen man is omnipotent you don't
[1:30:38] believe that but he is a man fully
[1:30:40] surrendered to God is omnipotent so he
[1:30:43] did not he say in Mark 11 22 whatsoever
[1:30:46] things you say and you don't doubt in
[1:30:47] your heart it'll come to pass you can
[1:30:50] have what you have said what happens
[1:30:52] then when two omnipotents meet when God
[1:30:56] and man comes together he said two
[1:30:58] omnipotents something's got to shake
[1:31:01] whatsoever you say with that creative
[1:31:03] power of omnipotence of God Amen knowing
[1:31:06] that he's promised it and he said it in
[1:31:07] his word it creates a power that goes
[1:31:10] out yonder and brings the thing to pass
[1:31:13] things that it's not it makes them as
[1:31:16] though they are because two omnipotents
[1:31:19] have met things that is not makes it as
[1:31:22] though they are because two omnipotents
[1:31:25] have man there he stands oh my isn't he
[1:31:28] wonderful in John chapter 11 the Bible
[1:31:31] said that Jesus's friend Lazarus died
[1:31:33] right amen and they wished he would have
[1:31:35] come at a certain time amen but now
[1:31:36] watch Lazarus was led in the grave for
[1:31:39] four days and the prophet says first
[1:31:41] thing you know Little Martha come
[1:31:42] running out there she said Lord amen see
[1:31:45] she told him he was Lord Lord if I would
[1:31:47] have been here my brother would not have
[1:31:48] died she said now even now whatsoever
[1:31:51] you have asked God God will give it to
[1:31:53] you he said nothing uncertain about that
[1:31:55] amen that's when two positives meet when
[1:31:59] two positives meet amen see that's when
[1:32:02] two omnipotents meet amen when one
[1:32:04] omnipotence she had amen perfect
[1:32:07] omnipotent faith in Christ and Christ
[1:32:09] was omnipotent see she had perfect
[1:32:11] infinite faith in Christ that he was is
[1:32:14] the Lord and knowed whatsoever he asked
[1:32:17] God Amen God would give it to him amen
[1:32:20] she knew whatever the Lord asked
[1:32:23] whatever he asked God for God would give
[1:32:25] it to him in other words she said you
[1:32:28] just speak the word that's all you have
[1:32:30] to do and whatever you ask God God will
[1:32:32] give it to you he said that's omnipotent
[1:32:35] all-powerful amen because he just said
[1:32:37] so see all right and he was all-powerful
[1:32:40] that's when two Powers two omnipotent
[1:32:43] Powers meets together he said then it's
[1:32:45] a contact amen so when you get one
[1:32:47] omnipotent contact Brother Samaya
[1:32:50] meeting with another omnipotent contact
[1:32:51] amen then something has got to change
[1:32:54] amen something has got to shake he said
[1:32:56] when a line has got 150 votes this way
[1:32:58] and got 150 votes that way and they come
[1:33:01] together he said you got a hundred and
[1:33:03] fifty votes going both ways he said see
[1:33:06] and when you got supreme power anybody
[1:33:08] want to preach with me tonight say these
[1:33:10] words supreme power when you got supreme
[1:33:12] power when Jesus said lay hands on the
[1:33:15] sick they shall recover and you got
[1:33:17] supreme Faith somebody say Supreme Faith
[1:33:19] supreme power and supreme faith in that
[1:33:23] being the truth then you need a supreme
[1:33:25] god somebody say supreme god
[1:33:28] that made a supreme promise Supreme
[1:33:31] promise and a supreme result will come
[1:33:34] amen that's it see when you have a
[1:33:37] supreme power connects with the Supreme
[1:33:39] faith that meets a supreme god under a
[1:33:42] supreme promise you will see a supreme
[1:33:44] result
[1:33:46] that's a preaching quote right there
[1:33:47] brother Terry when you see a supreme god
[1:33:49] where the supreme power and you've got
[1:33:52] supreme faith and you meet a supreme
[1:33:54] promise there's going to be a supreme
[1:33:56] result come on church do you know why
[1:33:59] that baby's leg dropped is because the
[1:34:02] faith amen met the presence of God and
[1:34:04] when the faith met the presence of God
[1:34:06] it brought a change in the life of that
[1:34:09] baby are y'all hearing me in other words
[1:34:11] it doesn't do no good if the faith is
[1:34:13] there and the presence is not it does no
[1:34:16] good if the presence is there and the
[1:34:18] faith is not come on call it to you the
[1:34:20] other day Faith will be slow in the last
[1:34:22] days amen but you gotta fight for your
[1:34:25] faith you're going to fight to keep your
[1:34:26] faith elevated amen above the reasonings
[1:34:29] above the unbelief you've got to fight
[1:34:31] to keep your face the preeminence of
[1:34:33] your life
[1:34:34] are you hearing me amen a supreme Faith

[1:44:12] faith
[1:44:13] what do you saying preacher I'm saying
[1:44:16] you don't have to go to Fort Wayne to
[1:44:17] touch him you don't have to go to Tucson
[1:44:19] to touch him the product of God said
[1:44:21] like this he said it's not me it's him
[1:44:23] and he's here he's in this building how
[1:44:26] many preachers we got here tonight can I
[1:44:28] see your hands men of God do you know
[1:44:29] what the prophet said he said your
[1:44:31] commission is to declare to the people
[1:44:33] his presence is here your commission
[1:44:36] from the throne is to declare to the
[1:44:38] people that the presence of God is here
[1:44:41] now I want to say this brother Sean we
[1:44:43] thank you for hanging this picture up in
[1:44:45] the church
[1:44:47] I think we ought to give the man of God
[1:44:49] a hand clap and pray I know you probably
[1:44:51] got criticism but we thank you for
[1:44:53] hanging that picture in the church I
[1:44:55] preached in churches and spent 10
[1:44:56] minutes looking for the picture and
[1:44:57] finally had to dig out of my Bible
[1:44:59] because they didn't have one now that's
[1:45:00] every church is Sovereign but I'm
[1:45:02] thankful to be identified with the
[1:45:03] church that still hangs the picture up
[1:45:05] you know what when I look at that
[1:45:07] picture brother Shema you know what I
[1:45:09] see I don't see just brother Branham I
[1:45:11] see his presence how many can see that
[1:45:13] picture right now if you can see that
[1:45:15] picture if your faith will allow your
[1:45:17] vision to see you will see more than
[1:45:19] William Mary and Bradham you will see
[1:45:21] more than a blue tie you will see more
[1:45:23] than a white shirt you will see more
[1:45:25] than a picture you will see the presence
[1:45:27] of the almighty God Amen the high priest
[1:45:30] himself amen veiled in the form of a
[1:45:33] light above a prophet's head he said how
[1:45:35] many of you got the picture here he said
[1:45:37] now that same being somebody said that
[1:45:39] same being that scientific world is
[1:45:41] recognized to be supernatural being at
[1:45:44] the day of the Judgment when I will
[1:45:45] stand before every one of you it isn't
[1:45:48] standing three feet from where I am
[1:45:50] right now
[1:45:52] whatever is in the picture has come into
[1:45:55] the church
[1:45:56] whatever is in that picture Sister Kim
[1:45:59] has come into this church he said now it
[1:46:02] hasn't come into me yet but it's
[1:46:04] standing here come on Church it hasn't
[1:46:06] come into me yet but it's standing here
[1:46:08] he said and it will perhaps in a few
[1:46:10] moments it's the one who does the
[1:46:13] Discerning so if that Pillar of Fire
[1:46:15] just stayed in the picture and did not
[1:46:18] come into the prophet there would have
[1:46:20] been no discernment but the very minute
[1:46:22] that Pillar of Fire amen changed forms
[1:46:24] it changed from a period in the form of
[1:46:26] a picture to appeared in the flesh of

[1:46:56] building he said now if he Remains the
[1:46:58] Same high priest like the Bible said we

[1:47:02] touch His Garment your faith can touch
[1:47:03] him that are you ready for this
[1:47:06] he'll act the same way
[1:47:08] yeah
[1:47:12] can I say it did like this he'll act the
[1:47:15] same way here tonight
[1:47:16] like he did in Fort Wayne Indiana
[1:47:21] he'll act the same way he did here
[1:47:23] tonight
[1:47:25] he did
[1:47:26] in Jeffersonville
[1:47:29] can we go a little bit further
[1:47:31] he'll act the same way here tonight like
[1:47:33] he did at the woman at the well
[1:47:37] he'll act the same way here tonight he
[1:47:39] says in flesh human flesh like he did
[1:47:42] when he was in human flesh there at
[1:47:45] Abraham's Oak
[1:47:49] your faith
[1:47:51] scheduled to be here at the same time
[1:47:53] his presence is
[1:47:56] can I say it to you tonight in closing
[1:47:58] Church you have a Divine appointment
[1:48:01] with his presence
[1:48:06] what I I wish I was a preacher right now
[1:48:08] to get this to you the way I'm seeing it
[1:48:11] what if you could see that these
[1:48:12] Services were more than just services
[1:48:17] what if you could see they are Divine
[1:48:19] appointments
[1:48:22] and the Bible said Jesus keeps all of
[1:48:24] his appointments
[1:48:28] come on Friends
[1:48:29] you know we've scheduled a lot of
[1:48:31] appointments we didn't keep
[1:48:34] something come up we couldn't make it
[1:48:37] it's like a guy told me one time he said
[1:48:38] he told the story he said he said I was
[1:48:41] sick one time he said
[1:48:43] I called the doctor told the doctor it's
[1:48:45] time for my yearly checkup he said it
[1:48:46] was like January he said they said well
[1:48:48] that's okay he said come in and in the
[1:48:50] end of October so we'll get you in for
[1:48:52] your checkup he said the end of October
[1:48:54] he said that's nine months they said
[1:48:56] yeah he said well what if I die between
[1:48:57] now and then he said well have your wife
[1:48:58] call and cancel the appointment
[1:49:01] laughs
[1:49:04] so you make appointments
[1:49:06] and things happen you can't make them
[1:49:08] situations happen you can't be there but
[1:49:10] what if I told you he's never canceled
[1:49:12] an appointment
[1:49:14] he's never made an appointment with your
[1:49:17] faith and canceled it
[1:49:20] now I know what happens
[1:49:22] I know what happens you get the same
[1:49:23] well God ain't moved for me yet and God
[1:49:25] moved for so and so and so and so got
[1:49:26] their blessing I ain't got mine so I
[1:49:28] don't guess I'm gonna get a bus well
[1:49:29] that's a devil trying to anoint you with
[1:49:30] a spirit of unbelief
[1:49:33] you do not have to bow your knee to that
[1:49:35] devil any longer you got to write right
[1:49:37] here tonight to say I'm going to show up
[1:49:39] and I'm going to bring my faith and I'm
[1:49:41] going to release my faith and when my
[1:49:43] faith and his presence has a Divine
[1:49:45] appointment I'm going to receive my
[1:49:47] Miracle until then I'm not going to be
[1:49:49] offended I'm not going to be upset I'm
[1:49:50] just going to keep on praising God
[1:49:52] rejoice
[1:49:54] how many prayer lines do they go through
[1:49:56] brother shalom for they finally made it
[1:49:57] to Miller's cafeteria
[1:50:00] spend all their money
[1:50:02] all their time all the travel time and
[1:50:05] never got to the prayer line
[1:50:06] that the prophet of God got up one
[1:50:08] morning to go downtown and get some
[1:50:09] breakfast brother Sean
[1:50:11] and God is mindful of the needs of his
[1:50:13] children so he worked it out to get that
[1:50:16] woman right there in the building at the
[1:50:18] right time maybe he maybe maybe he got
[1:50:20] her a little bit early a little early
[1:50:21] you know and then had the Prophet come
[1:50:23] in a specific time and had him bow his
[1:50:25] head and pray maybe maybe I get to
[1:50:28] thinking sometimes you imagine maybe
[1:50:30] he'd been there you know and just walked
[1:50:31] in sit down and kind of maybe just by
[1:50:34] himself if he had been by himself sister
[1:50:35] Jane just kind of sit there and bowed
[1:50:37] his head you know silently pray to
[1:50:38] himself and raised his head up and
[1:50:39] started eating that woman would never
[1:50:41] heard him say Amen
[1:50:43] but God had it so arranged that his
[1:50:45] family was sitting there and they all
[1:50:46] got together and they prayed and when he
[1:50:47] raised his voice he said amen
[1:50:51] I hope you don't think I'm crazy
[1:50:53] I'm preaching to you God's schedule
[1:50:57] can I leave your fist tonight

[2:20:18] it's amazing the scriptures
[2:20:21] All Through the Bible
[2:20:23] that God promises he would be here in
[2:20:26] this age
[2:20:27] this age living in a time of trouble
[2:20:32] such as never before
[2:20:34] and yet he promised that he would be a
[2:20:37] present help
[2:20:39] in such a time as this
[2:20:41] and I'm so glad that there is a people
[2:20:44] a man that is keeping their appointment
[2:20:48] [Music]
[2:20:49] in other words the remaining steadfast
[2:20:52] their faith is steadfast their faith is

[2:20:59] on knowing that God will keep his
[2:21:03] appointment
[2:21:04] God never fails
[2:21:07] never fails do you believe that
[2:21:10] never ever fails
[2:21:13] [Music]
[2:21:16] it seems like it's too late
[2:21:19] it's not too late
[2:21:22] seems like it's just gotten to an
[2:21:25] impossible situation it's not impossible
[2:21:29] God allows it to be impossible to the
[2:21:32] doctors he will allow it to be even
[2:21:34] impossible to preachers
[2:21:36] he will allow it to be impossible to
[2:21:39] parents he will allow it to be
[2:21:41] impossible to where the psychologist
[2:21:43] can't help no one has the answer as far
[2:21:47] as being able to help
[2:21:49] then God comes on the scene
[2:21:51] as it's been said when he's four days
[2:21:54] late
[2:21:55] he's never too late never too late
[2:21:59] can you say man God has proven it
[2:22:03] time and time again he doesn't move by
[2:22:06] majority
[2:22:08] he doesn't move by Talent he doesn't
[2:22:11] move by nothing
[2:22:12] [Music]
[2:22:13] and we you could look it through all
[2:22:15] throughout the Bible
[2:22:17] he would pick a uh just a farmer
[2:22:20] a man that that farmer would recognize
[2:22:22] his Covenant recognize who he was and
[2:22:26] that's little oh sham guard
[2:22:28] and he would take the mightiest
[2:22:30] 600.
[2:22:32] in the army of the philistine
[2:22:36] trained
[2:22:37] it was an impossible situation
[2:22:40] but he kept his appointment with God
[2:22:43] can you say man and God kept his
