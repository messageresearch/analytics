[41:40] St live inside this house of
[41:45] clay well is that your
[41:48] prayer oh let your word be
[41:52] born in the
[41:55] manger of
[41:56] of my
[42:01] heart bless the name of the Lord amen I
[42:05] believe
[42:06] that there are some hearts that have
[42:09] taken on the word amen and the word is
[42:13] maturing amen and uh developing and
[42:16] we're so glad for that amen but this is
[42:20] the time this is the age for it
[42:23] amen um if you have your Bibles the the
[42:27] book of St John the 13th
[42:30] chapter and
[42:33] um uh just good to have everyone here um
[42:38] tonight and those that were gone with
[42:41] sickness or out of
[42:43] town um good to have you back and um we
[42:48] also want to uh remember uh Sunday night
[42:51] we'll be having a uh testimony service
[42:54] songs and testimony so um looking
[42:58] forward to that we always have a
[43:00] wonderful time and it's hard to believe
[43:02] that we're already Thanksgiving and
[43:05] right around the corner and uh we got a
[43:08] lot to be thankful for amen we got a lot
[43:10] to be thankful for and um so um I'm glad
[43:16] to be an American for one and I'm glad
[43:18] to be a Christian amen and no matter
[43:21] where this this uh country is going to
[43:25] uh seems like it's going down in a hurry
[43:28] but while we still got our liberties and
[43:30] and uh freedoms to worship amen let's
[43:34] take advantage of it and be thankful for
[43:36] it amen but uh St John the 13th
[43:42] chapter and uh going to read the third
[43:44] and fourth verse but it says Jesus
[43:46] knowing that the father had given all
[43:48] things into his hands and that he was
[43:51] come from God and went to God he riseth
[43:55] from supper and laid aside his garments
[43:57] and took a towel and girded himself amen
[44:02] let's just bow our heads and talk to our
[44:05] Lord
[44:06] father we're just a humble group of
[44:12] people here father we bow our heads to
[44:16] the dust from which we've
[44:19] come and Lord we don't have much to
[44:22] offer we don't have anything to offer
[44:24] Lord in way that would edify you or to
[44:28] make you any more than what you
[44:30] are but father we just come to worship
[44:34] you because of who you are Lord and
[44:38] we're asking father that you would mold
[44:40] us into your image Lord and that you
[44:43] would have your way we recognize you to
[44:47] be Lord of all father Lord we ask that
[44:51] you'd be Lord Of Our Lives take complete
[44:55] preeminence father in this service and
[44:58] may the word have its effect in US Lord
[45:02] and may we leave here better than we
[45:06] came in Father we ask it in Jesus
[45:10] Christ's name and the church
[45:12] says amen you can have your seats this
[45:16] evening and um I'm going to continue on
[45:21] the thought that we spoke on um last
[45:26] Wednesday of understanding who we
[45:30] are and um I tell you it's it's a a real
[45:35] honor to be part of the Bride of Jesus
[45:39] Christ and uh we must not take that for
[45:43] granted and and more than anything
[45:48] um I pray that God gives us a greater
[45:52] understanding and uh as to who we are
[45:55] but as I mentioned uh last Wednesday
[46:00] that being being his body is more
[46:04] precious to us than even Walking With
[46:08] Jesus of uh back when he was on the
[46:11] earth 2,000 years
[46:13] ago John laid his head on his chest
[46:18] Jesus's chest and and what a privilege
[46:22] that must have been to be able to sit
[46:24] with him and rub shoulders with him eat
[46:27] with him but we are more privileged than
[46:30] that uh the disciples touched him talked
[46:33] with him heard his voice but we are more
[46:36] privileged even than that for we are the
[46:39] body of Jesus Christ and so our hands is
[46:44] his hands our voice is his voice our
[46:47] body is his body and according to
[46:51] Matthew 25 there will actually be people
[46:55] that will obtain eternal life uh simply
[46:59] by being good to the bride of Christ
[47:02] which is his body amen and and we we
[47:07] know it um but uh Jesus uh here talked
[47:14] to them there in Matthew
[47:16] 25:34 and said Come Ye blessed of my
[47:19] father inherit the Kingdom prepared for
[47:21] you from the foundation of the world for
[47:24] I was hungered you gave me meat I was
[47:26] thirsty you gave me drink I was a
[47:28] stranger you took me in naked you
[47:30] clothed me I was sick you visited me I
[47:34] was in prison and you came to me and
[47:37] then they will answer Lord when did we
[47:39] see you these this way when did we and
[47:42] he said when you've done it unto the
[47:43] least of these my brethren you did it
[47:46] unto
[47:48] me and so and then and then of course uh
[47:53] there will be those that'll be cast out
[47:55] out into outer Darkness simply by not
[47:58] being good to the bride uh for here he
[48:03] he said you know um uh he said verily I
[48:07] say unto you in as much as you have done
[48:10] it unto the least of these my brethren
[48:12] you have done unto me then he shall say
[48:13] unto them on the left hand depart from
[48:15] me ye cursed into eternal life or
[48:18] everlasting life uh prepared for the
[48:21] devil and his angels for when I was
[48:24] hungry you gave me no meat I was thirsty
[48:26] you gave me no drink I was a stranger
[48:29] you took me not in naked and you clothed
[48:31] me not sick and in prison and you
[48:33] visited me not and so he said when did
[48:37] we not do these things and when did we
[48:39] see you and and he says verily I say
[48:42] unto you in as much as you did it not
[48:44] unto the least of these you did it not
[48:46] unto me so then we we see that being a
[48:51] part of the body is is is very a uh and
[48:57] and any of the Bride that that was not
[49:00] speaking of the bride at all as far as
[49:03] their what they had done and what they
[49:05] had attained amen but these were people
[49:09] that had been good to the the bride and
[49:12] and they had actually done it
[49:14] unconsciously they brother brand said
[49:16] they just it came from their heart they
[49:18] automatically did it and didn't even
[49:20] realize what they were doing and so but
[49:24] you you can see why it is important to
[49:26] have a clear understanding uh uh who we
[49:30] are and you know we need to have the
[49:33] same understanding that Jesus and John
[49:36] had in their day and not only did they
[49:40] have a clear understanding of who each
[49:43] other were but they had a clear
[49:46] understanding of who they were amen and
[49:50] uh uh and their understanding came from
[49:52] the scriptures um there in John 1:2 2 2
[49:56] uh John the Baptist was asked who art
[49:58] thou that we may give an answer to them
[50:00] that sent us what sayest thou of thyself
[50:03] and he said I am the voice of one crying
[50:06] in the wilderness make straight the way
[50:07] of the Lord as said the prophet Isaiah
[50:11] amen Isaiah and and so John uh he he
[50:15] could take his ministry take what he was
[50:17] and what he was doing and he could found
[50:20] it upon the scriptures and um he he had
[50:23] a clear understanding of what he was and
[50:26] who he was and what his ministry was
[50:28] about and our opening scriptures tells
[50:32] us that Jesus knew who he was and uh to
[50:36] me uh that that just that thought and
[50:39] how that he could take a towel and G
[50:42] himself and bow and kneel and wor the
[50:45] feet of his disciples it's it's
[50:47] incredible and how he could do that is
[50:50] because he knew who he was he didn't
[50:53] have to prove nothing he didn't have to
[50:55] uh be all high and mighty there was no
[50:58] competition with him uh to see who gets
[51:00] the first spot and who gets this and
[51:02] this and no no he already knew who he
[51:06] was and because of that then he could
[51:09] take on the heart of a servant amen and
[51:13] so uh but Jesus knowing who he was uh in
[51:16] in John
[51:18] 2:19 he bodly States destroy this Temple
[51:21] and within three days I will raise it up
[51:25] and he and he bases that statement off
[51:28] of what the prophet uh uh said there in
[51:32] psalm 16 and 10 for thou wil not leave
[51:36] my soul in Hell neither wil thou suffer
[51:38] thine Holy One to see corruption well
[51:41] see it it doesn't say Jesus it doesn't
[51:43] say Jesus Christ Jesus of Nazareth or it
[51:47] Jesus's name wasn't physically literally
[51:50] in that scripture but Jesus had the
[51:53] revelation of that scripture and he knew
[51:56] who it was talking about he knew it was
[51:59] about him and so therefore uh uh he knew
[52:04] he knew based on that scripture and
[52:07] based on the Revelation that he had and
[52:10] the the personal revelation of it that
[52:13] he would not see corruption amen and and
[52:17] so even though he would die and so but
[52:20] Jesus had the clear understanding that
[52:22] he was the Messiah and and that the
[52:25] scripture spoke of him he was the word
[52:27] as the uh John uh 1 and 1 says uh and 14
[52:34] and that word became flesh and so uh uh
[52:37] he was on Earth to fulfill every
[52:40] scripture that was spoke of the Messiah
[52:44] and and yet he did not fulfill them
[52:46] blindly he he didn't come to the end of
[52:49] his life and the end of his Earthly
[52:51] Journey amen and say now I hope I
[52:54] fulfilled everything and and you know
[52:57] fingers crossed and and let let's hope
[52:59] we did it all but no he he he knew that
[53:03] he was to fulfill the scriptures and he
[53:05] did them uh knowingly he he did them and
[53:10] and so um uh in other words he didn't
[53:14] fulfill Promises of the scriptures uh uh
[53:18] as though he didn't know who he was and
[53:20] didn't know what his ministry was about
[53:23] and what he was to fulfill he knew what
[53:25] he was to fulfill he he knew who he was
[53:29] he knew the ministry that he had and so
[53:32] his purpose was to fulfill the ministry
[53:35] that God had called him to do ain't that
[53:38] right notice how he prays in in John
[53:42] 17:22 and breaking in in he says the
[53:46] glory which thou gavest me I have given
[53:50] them that they may be one even as we are
[53:53] one I am them and thou and me that they
[53:56] may be made perfect in one and that the
[53:58] world may know that thou has sent me and
[54:01] has loved me as as thou or has loved
[54:05] them as thou H has loved me amen and and
[54:08] notice this prayer was not a a qu uh
[54:11] there was not this prayer was not a
[54:13] question uh it didn't end with the
[54:15] question mark it was actually a matter
[54:18] of fact statement you you understand the
[54:21] glory thing of that now he truly
[54:23] believed that the one one who who who
[54:26] gave him the glory was the father he
[54:30] believed that he and the father were one
[54:32] he believed he knew with all of his
[54:35] heart that the father was in him he
[54:38] believed that the father loved him and
[54:41] so uh uh uh and and and so his prayer is
[54:45] not about Lord would you would you make
[54:47] sure would you assure me of your
[54:49] presence would you assure me that that
[54:51] we are one uh uh would you help my
[54:54] confidence in in my you know that that
[54:57] you love me no it was now he's praying
[55:00] for someone else he's praying for for
[55:02] the elect father make them one as you
[55:04] and I are one give the glory that you
[55:07] have given me I have given them he knew
[55:09] what he was given us it was the glory
[55:12] that the father had given him and and
[55:14] and so um uh you know brother brandham
[55:17] talked about the faith of Jas and who
[55:20] was a Jew and he talked about the faith
[55:22] of that Centurion who was a gentile
[55:25] and and and of course the the Jew had
[55:28] the had Faith uh enough to to believe in
[55:32] Jesus that if he would come and and lay
[55:35] hands lay his hands on uh his daughter
[55:39] she would be well the Centurion had a
[55:42] greater faith and and he believed that
[55:45] if Jesus would just speak the word uh
[55:48] then his servant would live and and so
[55:51] these men both men recognize Jesus to be
[55:55] the Son of God they they recognized that
[55:58] he had some type of authority and uh and
[56:02] and believe that that he had the uh
[56:04] Power to heal and and to raise the dead
[56:08] there there were many others as well
[56:10] that that Express faith in in Jesus uh
[56:14] the woman with the issue of blood she
[56:16] said within herself if I can just but
[56:18] touch his clothes I know I I'll be made
[56:21] whole the two men uh expressed uh BL men
[56:25] expressed their faith in him uh even
[56:28] when Jesus turned and walked away from
[56:30] them they followed him in the house and
[56:32] and and and they made their appeal to
[56:34] him and and the Bible says that Jesus
[56:37] says that great is thy faith and and and
[56:40] and and they they were healed another
[56:43] woman expressed her faith in Jesus by
[56:45] coming to him and asking for him to heal
[56:48] her daughter that was grievously vexed
[56:51] uh uh with the devil and even though
[56:54] Jesus called her a dog yet she would not
[56:58] leave because she recognized that Jesus
[57:01] had something that she needed and and if
[57:04] he would just uh uh uh Grant her request
[57:08] uh everything would be all right so
[57:10] their faith all of these their faith was
[57:13] in in Jesus Christ uh a man came to
[57:16] Jesus asking him to deliver his son who
[57:19] was possessed with an epileptic Spirit
[57:22] as as we all know and and and then you
[57:26] find in Luke 6:17 it says that many came
[57:29] to hear him and to be healed of their
[57:32] diseases and they that were vexed with
[57:34] unclean spirits and they were healed and
[57:37] and the whole multitude sought to touch
[57:40] him for there went virtue out of him and
[57:43] healed them all ain't that right so by
[57:47] their faith in him they received what
[57:50] they had need of amen and yet many of
[57:54] them didn't understand the scriptures um
[57:57] many of them probably didn't even
[58:00] understand who he was per se as being
[58:03] the Son of God it's just like today a
[58:06] lot of people didn't recognize brother
[58:07] Brandon's Ministry and and and yet they
[58:10] had enough faith that if he would pray
[58:12] amen I would you know they would get
[58:14] healed or uh or this or that but they
[58:17] didn't really understand the scriptures
[58:19] about his ministry and and even he was
[58:22] having healing campaigns and all that
[58:24] and really didn't understand it it was
[58:27] later on in his ministry that he
[58:28] understood that he was the prophet of
[58:30] Malachi 4 and and these things but see
[58:34] uh uh but but they had faith in Jesus uh
[58:37] uh no doubt well the Bible says his Fame
[58:39] grew and and so uh um uh brother
[58:43] brandham says that some no doubt had an
[58:45] intellectual Faith uh about him and and
[58:48] and these things and they they had heard
[58:50] stories and whatever like blind Bas
[58:53] probably heard stor stories of of of
[58:56] Jesus and and and what he was doing and
[58:59] then he hears that Jesus is passing his
[59:01] way and and his faith uh uh knowing that
[59:05] Jesus if Jesus could just uh uh touch
[59:09] him or or Grant his request he'd be he'd
[59:12] be healed and so his faith amen uh uh uh
[59:16] stopped Jesus in his tracks amen and
[59:19] these things but what about the faith
[59:21] that Jesus had amen you you see
[59:25] uh uh he wouldn't have laid hands uh on
[59:28] ji's daughter if he didn't have faith uh
[59:31] that it would help am man he he wouldn't
[59:34] have uh spoke the word to this uh
[59:37] Centurion about his servant if he didn't
[59:40] believe that his words had power amen he
[59:43] he wouldn't have went to the grave of
[59:45] Lazarus who had been dead already for
[59:48] days if if he did not believe that when
[59:51] that stone was rode away and he would
[59:53] command Lazarus to come forth he would
[59:56] come out of the ground if Jesus didn't
[59:58] believe that that would happen he he
[1:00:00] wouldn't have went to the Grave it's
[1:00:02] like a lot of us today amen if there's a
[1:00:04] little bit of doubt in in our lives then
[1:00:07] then we won't ask and you know and and
[1:00:09] and we won't we wouldn't come up for
[1:00:11] prayer we wouldn't do this we wouldn't
[1:00:13] do that it takes Faith to do all of that
[1:00:16] it takes Faith to preach the gospel it
[1:00:18] takes Faith to believe in this message
[1:00:20] it takes Faith Amen to Proclaim that God
[1:00:22] has healed me before you ever get the Sy
[1:00:25] get evidence of it it it takes Faith
[1:00:28] amen so just as much as it takes Faith
[1:00:31] to declare I've been healed well well so
[1:00:34] your fever broke well no uh uh well how
[1:00:37] can you say that you're healed well I
[1:00:38] believe that God healed me amen well you
[1:00:41] wouldn't do that you would think every
[1:00:42] like every the unbeliever you would
[1:00:44] think that was stupid to say that oh
[1:00:46] they're going to make fun of me oh
[1:00:47] that's just on nonsense we got to think
[1:00:49] of reality here but no if you really got
[1:00:52] faith in what the word says amen the
[1:00:54] Bible says by stripes we were healed
[1:00:57] it's already done it's a finished work
[1:00:59] amen but it takes faith that to Proclaim
[1:01:01] that I'm Healed regardless of what the
[1:01:03] devil says what everything says I am
[1:01:06] healed ain't that right so so Jesus had
[1:01:09] to have faith in order to do his his uh
[1:01:13] his ministry he had to have faith in
[1:01:16] order to set the captive free he had to
[1:01:19] have faith when that woman was there uh
[1:01:21] when they were going to Stone uh that
[1:01:24] lady uh for adultery and things and and
[1:01:27] and there they they had their rocks and
[1:01:29] all of that and and and he says he that
[1:01:33] without the sin cast the first stone
[1:01:35] remember that amen and then uh uh he he
[1:01:39] looked at her and and after they had
[1:01:41] left and it says Where Art Thou accusers
[1:01:43] and she says I have none he says well
[1:01:45] neither do I condemn thee go thy way and
[1:01:48] sin no more he knew that that these
[1:01:52] words had power to release her amen as
[1:01:57] as much as the woman that that was there
[1:02:00] that washed his feet and and these
[1:02:02] things and and he says thy sins which
[1:02:05] are many are forgiven thee he had to
[1:02:08] have faith in in in who he was Amen to
[1:02:13] say them kind of words can you say Amen
[1:02:17] so his faith amen was not in a church it
[1:02:20] wasn't in a man it wasn't in something
[1:02:22] else his faith was on a different level
[1:02:26] everyone else's Faith was in him as he
[1:02:29] was walking on the earth and and and and
[1:02:33] performing The Miracles and all of these
[1:02:35] things but his faith he had perfect
[1:02:37] Faith amen he had perfect faith and his
[1:02:41] faith came from understanding who he was
[1:02:46] can you say amen amen his faith came
[1:02:49] from understanding so so his faith was
[1:02:52] the faith of God a man he had the same
[1:02:55] Faith uh that God had when when God said
[1:02:59] let there be light there was no light
[1:03:01] never had been light amen and and and
[1:03:04] the Earth was dark and darkness covered
[1:03:07] the Earth and and and all of these
[1:03:09] things but God wanted light God wanted
[1:03:12] to to transform the world and he would
[1:03:14] transform it through the power of light
[1:03:16] and and so he stands there and he says
[1:03:20] let there be light and the prophet said
[1:03:22] it took faith for God to do that but
[1:03:24] where was God's faith going to be at
[1:03:26] amen there there was nothing that he
[1:03:28] could put his faith in there was no
[1:03:30] church that he could put his faith in
[1:03:31] there ain't a bishop he could put his
[1:03:33] faith in he certainly couldn't put his
[1:03:35] faith in in man even if man was there at
[1:03:38] that time there was nothing there but
[1:03:40] God had faith and his faith was in his
[1:03:44] own word ain't that right and by faith
[1:03:47] the worlds were framed by faith God
[1:03:50] spoke his creative word and it was Soul
[1:03:55] amen the prophet said the dirt that you
[1:03:57] set over uh tonight that's God's word
[1:04:01] God just said let there be and his word
[1:04:03] materialize well where did he get the
[1:04:05] dirt if it wasn't there see amen see if
[1:04:08] it didn't materialize where did he get
[1:04:10] it he just spoke it it's God's
[1:04:12] materialized word form the Earth that
[1:04:15] you set on ain't that right oh I
[1:04:18] wonderful how past finding out it's by
[1:04:20] faith everybody say it's by faith it's
[1:04:22] by faith that we believe him believe him
[1:04:25] God believed his own word and it formed
[1:04:29] the world God believed his own word
[1:04:32] ain't that right see it was a perfect
[1:04:34] Faith Amen brother brand said it's the
[1:04:36] super sense amen uh that Jesus had and
[1:04:40] that God had it was by super sense that
[1:04:43] the world was formed amen and so Jesus
[1:04:47] had that kind of Faith he had the same
[1:04:49] kind of Faith see amen because his faith
[1:04:53] was in the word word of God can you say
[1:04:55] amen amen not in some man not in some
[1:04:59] Ministry not in some whatever it was in
[1:05:02] the word of God Amen see so brother
[1:05:05] bradam said a Believer is he said is the
[1:05:08] faith of God that moves in you amen
[1:05:11] that's what a True Believer is is the
[1:05:14] faith of God moving in in in the man
[1:05:18] amen so where did Jesus get his faith at
[1:05:22] then amen uh other were inspired by
[1:05:25] Jesus's Ministry and their faith was
[1:05:28] inspired by by what he done and what he
[1:05:30] said and and and these things but Jesus
[1:05:34] amen his faith amen well the Bible says
[1:05:38] that God was in Christ everybody say God
[1:05:41] was in Christ reconciling the world unto
[1:05:44] himself see God was in Christ amen the
[1:05:48] same God that that uh uh that spoke amen
[1:05:52] that stood on the invisible plat form
[1:05:55] amen and by Faith said let there be and
[1:05:58] it was was now living in a body amen for
[1:06:02] Jesus Christ was the human body that God
[1:06:05] lived in and I I say it this way God
[1:06:07] wasn't manifesting himself in that Jew
[1:06:10] he was not manifesting himself in that
[1:06:13] Gentile he wasn't manifesting himself in
[1:06:16] those who came to Jesus for help amen
[1:06:19] their faith was in Jesus Christ can you
[1:06:21] say Amen but God in Christ
[1:06:24] God in Christ recognized his own word
[1:06:29] that he spoke through the prophets and
[1:06:31] believed it ain't that right God Amen
[1:06:35] God in Christ amen now the prophet said
[1:06:38] God forsaw the bride in the groom Amen
[1:06:41] to save his wife like Adam he had to go
[1:06:44] with her Adam know what he was doing Eve
[1:06:47] didn't know what she was doing but Adam
[1:06:49] walked out with his wife and Jesus took
[1:06:51] his wife's place and became sin for her
[1:06:55] remember he became you he stood your
[1:06:58] punishment that you might stand at his
[1:07:00] place he stood in your place that you
[1:07:03] might stand in his place what a place to
[1:07:06] stand in tonight you're not standing in
[1:07:09] J's place you're not standing in that
[1:07:12] centurion's place you are standing in
[1:07:16] his place in the place of Jesus Christ
[1:07:19] you're not standing in blind bz's uh
[1:07:22] place you are standing in the very place
[1:07:25] of Jesus Christ amen see Jesus the word
[1:07:30] became me that I a sinner might become
[1:07:33] him the word amen so at Calvary he died
[1:07:36] as a man and yet you know we know that
[1:07:39] he didn't have to do it but the prophet
[1:07:41] said he went there with you in him ain't
[1:07:44] that right he went with you there with
[1:07:46] you in him God had never separated the
[1:07:49] bride from the groom yet so when God
[1:07:51] looked down upon the body of Christ he
[1:07:54] saw both male and female and it was all
[1:07:57] redeemed in that one body they are one
[1:08:02] the same word spoke of the groom it's
[1:08:05] now speaks of the Bride Can you say Amen
[1:08:09] the same word that spoke of the groom
[1:08:11] amen the word Jesus Christ now speaks of
[1:08:14] the uh the the the bride which is the
[1:08:17] word as well ain't that right amen so
[1:08:20] the prophet says how can the Bride come
[1:08:23] and fail to manifest everything that was
[1:08:26] promised of her ain't that right how
[1:08:29] could Jesus come being God being the
[1:08:31] Redeemer being the Messiah and not
[1:08:33] fulfill every scripture pertaining to
[1:08:36] the Messiah what a Ministry what a faith
[1:08:39] he must have had Amen to fulfill every
[1:08:42] scripture and know that he was ordained
[1:08:44] to fulfill it ain't that right amen you
[1:08:47] couldn't move him from it Satan tried to
[1:08:50] do it and he found out he he he met
[1:08:52] someone greater than a than Solomon make
[1:08:55] greater than Noah make greater than
[1:08:56] Moses make greater than David this man
[1:08:59] was the word it was God in flesh can you
[1:09:04] say Amen well it's in this age too this
[1:09:07] is why amen you'll never be deceived
[1:09:09] because you're part of him you'll never
[1:09:12] be deceived he's been able to Amen to
[1:09:14] deceive many down Through the Ages and
[1:09:16] and his deception is the greatest of all
[1:09:19] ages in this age but there is a bride
[1:09:22] that has been ordained amen just as the
[1:09:25] groom so is the bride going to fulfill
[1:09:28] everything that has been promised of
[1:09:32] her now he the groom fulfilled
[1:09:35] everything in his physical body that was
[1:09:37] spoken of him ain't that right then
[1:09:41] wouldn't he fulfill all that was spoken
[1:09:44] of him living in his bride's body his
[1:09:47] bride hello it's not your ministry it's
[1:09:50] not your your acts anyways it's God
[1:09:52] you're just the body
[1:09:54] the same God that was in Christ is the
[1:09:56] same God that's in this bride and and
[1:09:59] and he he and as as he wrote the script
[1:10:02] out for the groom and and and then he
[1:10:04] came down and fulfilled it in that body
[1:10:07] in that single body that physical body
[1:10:09] so as he wrote out a script for this
[1:10:11] bride body that he would come and live
[1:10:14] in her and fulfill the script can you
[1:10:17] sayen so amen uh uh then then he's got
[1:10:21] to fulfill everything that was spoken of
[1:10:23] him in the bride body amen see so
[1:10:26] brother Brown said he did everything
[1:10:28] even to proven it by raising himself up
[1:10:31] from the dead afterwards then don't the
[1:10:33] bride have to do the same thing have to
[1:10:36] be exactly what the word said she would
[1:10:38] be in this last days now notice what the
[1:10:41] prophet said now he asked the question
[1:10:43] but he's he's it's really he's really
[1:10:45] letting us know she has to return by
[1:10:49] Malachi
[1:10:50] 4 can you say Amen she has to return
[1:10:54] through Malachi 4 amen so this is why
[1:10:57] the message of the hour is so important
[1:11:00] and and how do we know what is Malachi
[1:11:02] for how do we know who is really the
[1:11:04] Elijah well God's had his picture taken
[1:11:06] with him so you would know can you say
[1:11:09] man that ain't that ain't a picture
[1:11:10] that's just something insignificant to
[1:11:12] this bride that is very important to us
[1:11:15] that we would know who we are to listen
[1:11:19] to and to follow can you say amen that's
[1:11:23] exactly ly right so Jesus the prophet
[1:11:26] said now Jesus relied upon what he was
[1:11:30] ain't that right he relied in knowing
[1:11:32] that he was the word he had faith in God
[1:11:36] who made him the word now I'm going to
[1:11:38] say that again Jesus relied upon what he
[1:11:42] was that's right he didn't rely upon
[1:11:46] everybody applauding him amen because
[1:11:49] there's a lot of times in his ministry
[1:11:50] they didn't applaud him amen he didn't
[1:11:53] rely upon him uh uh staying with him
[1:11:57] amen and and and and and that's where
[1:11:59] his faith was because there was many
[1:12:02] times that they walked away from him
[1:12:04] amen but he relied upon what he was amen
[1:12:10] and he had Faith watch he had faith in
[1:12:12] God who made him the word see he relied
[1:12:16] in knowing that he was the word he was
[1:12:20] God the word and they was in him and
[1:12:23] that give him Faith because he
[1:12:26] understood his
[1:12:28] position praise God hello come on now he
[1:12:33] understood his position you're going to
[1:12:34] have rainy days you're going to have
[1:12:35] sunny days come on now you're going to
[1:12:37] have good times you're going to have bad
[1:12:39] times you're going to have times that
[1:12:41] you feel like you're on the mountain and
[1:12:42] then other time you're going to feel
[1:12:43] like you're already close to
[1:12:47] hell you're going to have times that it
[1:12:49] just seem like God is carrying you and
[1:12:51] God's wrapped his arms around you and
[1:12:53] there's going to be other times you're
[1:12:54] going to think that God's A Million
[1:12:55] Miles
[1:12:56] Away ain't that right and I I have to
[1:13:00] tell you I believe that Jesus
[1:13:01] experienced every one of these things I
[1:13:04] believe he I I I believe that he his he
[1:13:07] he he still had the five senses of the
[1:13:09] of the flesh he had the five senses of
[1:13:11] the spirit he was a man and he went
[1:13:14] through ups and downs and and all of
[1:13:16] these things but it never detoured him
[1:13:19] because his faith was not based upon uh
[1:13:22] what people said about him his faith
[1:13:24] wasn't based upon how people treated him
[1:13:27] his faith wasn't based on anything his
[1:13:29] faith was based because he understood
[1:13:32] his position he understood who he was
[1:13:35] can you say Amen now notice how did he
[1:13:37] know who he was well the prophet said he
[1:13:40] know what he was because the scripture
[1:13:42] had said he was this can you say Amen
[1:13:45] the scripture said it amen sure there
[1:13:48] was a lot of people say well th there
[1:13:50] well look at Peter let's just take Peter
[1:13:51] for example amen now he already knew who
[1:13:54] he was Jesus knew who he was so when he
[1:13:57] asked him well who do men say that I am
[1:13:59] he was not looking for approval he was
[1:14:02] not looking for somebody to to to help
[1:14:05] him boost his faith up he just wanted to
[1:14:07] know who people what people are saying
[1:14:09] about him well some say this some say
[1:14:11] that well who do you say that I am and
[1:14:13] Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son
[1:14:15] of the Living God did that M did that
[1:14:17] boost Jesus's Faith even more absolutely
[1:14:20] not I don't not I do I don't believe
[1:14:22] that amen because look what Peter done
[1:14:24] later on he denied
[1:14:28] him but Jesus knew he was the son of God
[1:14:33] anyways can you say amen that's what
[1:14:36] keeps Believers keep pressing on yes sir
[1:14:38] you just press on regardless of what
[1:14:41] comes what goes what who does this who
[1:14:44] does that just keep pressing on one of
[1:14:47] these days it's all going to come out at
[1:14:48] the end of the wash anyways but if you
[1:14:51] know who you are based on what the word
[1:14:54] says you can go regardless of whatever
[1:14:57] else happens in your life amen he know
[1:15:00] what it was because the scripture had
[1:15:02] said he was this and here every
[1:15:04] scripture tied in to prove that he was
[1:15:06] exactly what the scripture said he would
[1:15:08] be and he knew what he was therefore he
[1:15:12] relied upon what God made him amen now
[1:15:16] if he did that then can't we rely upon
[1:15:20] what God made us as Believers think
[1:15:22] about notice that now if we're in his is
[1:15:27] shoes if we're taking his place you
[1:15:29] cannot have the faith of J you can't
[1:15:31] have the faith of of others you've got
[1:15:33] to have the faith that Jesus had perfect
[1:15:36] Faith amen amen can you say amen and
[1:15:40] that Faith relies upon the
[1:15:43] word ain't that right surely it it
[1:15:46] relies upon the word right praise the
[1:15:49] Lord yes sir these signs shall follow
[1:15:51] them that believe he he had faith in
[1:15:54] what he was and if you are a Believer
[1:15:58] you have faith in what you are for you
[1:16:01] are a Believer amen ain't that right
[1:16:05] amen
[1:16:07] now Jesus said as the father have sent
[1:16:11] me so send I you yes
[1:16:14] sir and I like what brother brand said
[1:16:17] how did the father send him by going
[1:16:19] with him and being in him amen so the
[1:16:23] same God that was in Christ is in the
[1:16:25] church amen you believe it amen then
[1:16:29] when the bride is being called out now
[1:16:31] notice how the brother Braham says this
[1:16:33] when the bride is being called out how
[1:16:35] are you going to put it
[1:16:38] out how are you going to put out this
[1:16:40] bride Revival can't do it can't do it
[1:16:43] how are you going to how are you going
[1:16:44] to Stomp The Bride out can't do it can
[1:16:47] you say Amen notice what brother Brown
[1:16:49] said this calling out of the Bride it's
[1:16:51] the revelation of the manifestation of
[1:16:54] the word made
[1:16:55] True say that again it's the revelation
[1:16:59] of the manifestation of the word made
[1:17:02] True see everything about this bride the
[1:17:05] ministry of this bride everything about
[1:17:07] this bride is right in scriptures can
[1:17:10] you say Amen this bride is not a
[1:17:12] hypocrite
[1:17:14] bride getting out there and sinning all
[1:17:17] that then coming to church acting like a
[1:17:19] like like some little angel that ain't
[1:17:22] happening
[1:17:23] and there's a lot of Hypocrites in
[1:17:25] churches yeah even in the message can
[1:17:28] you say Amen but we ain't talking about
[1:17:30] all that you have to look over all that
[1:17:33] hypocrisy and look what the Bible says
[1:17:35] that we are can you say Amen see it's
[1:17:38] the revelation of the manifestation of
[1:17:41] the word made true that's what your life
[1:17:44] is is the revelation of the
[1:17:46] manifestation of the word may true and
[1:17:48] we're living in that day praise be to
[1:17:51] God the revelation
[1:17:53] of the mystery of himself
[1:17:57] amen God revealing himself where in his
[1:18:02] bride and it lines up with the word of
[1:18:07] God and this is what this fulfills what
[1:18:09] Jesus said at that day you shall know
[1:18:11] that I'm in my father I in you and you
[1:18:14] in me yeah you in me and I in you ain't
[1:18:18] that right that's what it fulfills why
[1:18:19] this is the Revelation amen of God's see
[1:18:23] so brother BR says now the very God that
[1:18:26] wrote the word is in the
[1:18:29] man saying that's the
[1:18:33] truth ain't that right the very God that
[1:18:37] wrote the word is in the man saying
[1:18:40] that's the truth I don't care what
[1:18:41] anybody says that's the truth there it
[1:18:44] is God in the man recognizes his own
[1:18:50] word God in the man recognizes his own
[1:18:53] work that's good now you think of that
[1:18:56] how blind we would be brother
[1:18:59] Amos right there's so many intellectual
[1:19:03] people that take this Bible and really
[1:19:05] think they got knowledge of it but
[1:19:07] they're so far off how many commentators
[1:19:11] made by men that have spent their life
[1:19:14] searching through this Bible
[1:19:16] amen and and and yet didn't come to any
[1:19:20] conclusion of Truth I mean they had some
[1:19:23] truth yeah but not not the where it's
[1:19:26] brought the bride to a rapturing
[1:19:29] faith but then God would come in this
[1:19:32] age in his
[1:19:34] bride and recognize the
[1:19:37] truth it isn't us that's doing it it's
[1:19:41] God in
[1:19:45] us God in the man recognizes his own
[1:19:49] Word Church we're not just professing
[1:19:52] church church
[1:19:53] members we're not just here just
[1:19:56] twiddling our
[1:19:57] thumbs we are the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:20:01] his body yes sir true can you say Amen
[1:20:06] yes sir his body Luke 17:30 means a lot
[1:20:10] to us because it's a prophecy of this
[1:20:13] day and I this is just my thoughts uh
[1:20:17] from what I see and that is you know
[1:20:21] because it talks about the revealing of
[1:20:22] the son
[1:20:24] man I believe we're still in that
[1:20:27] revealing of the son of man I believe
[1:20:30] we're in the days of the son of
[1:20:33] manise the Lord one one had told me said
[1:20:36] well we've been taught that that and it
[1:20:39] wasn't here it was in another state but
[1:20:40] so we've been taught that when brother
[1:20:42] brandham died we went back to being the
[1:20:44] days of son of Son of God and I no no no
[1:20:48] I don't I don't see that at all right I
[1:20:51] believe that that that brother Brandon's
[1:20:54] Ministry was the revealing of the son of
[1:20:56] man introducing what Christ in the the
[1:21:02] body that that's my thoughts that's
[1:21:05] that's the way I see it and and so
[1:21:08] therefore we're still in the revealing
[1:21:11] of the son of man son of man being
[1:21:13] revealed through his body and see the
[1:21:15] only way he could be revealed is through
[1:21:18] by his very own body bride body ain't
[1:21:23] that right he's not to be revealed as
[1:21:25] Spirit he's to be revealed as son of man
[1:21:30] Spirit was Son of God ain't that right
[1:21:34] but in this day revealing as the son of
[1:21:37] man what is it God and man becoming one
[1:21:43] amen God and man becoming one the word
[1:21:49] becoming
[1:21:51] flesh true Amen brother Bram said all
[1:21:54] that spiritual union of Christ and his
[1:21:56] church now when the flesh is becoming
[1:21:59] the word and the word is becoming flesh
[1:22:01] manifested Vindicated amen just what the
[1:22:05] Bible said would happen in this day it's
[1:22:08] happening day by day everybody say day
[1:22:11] by day day by day yes sir it ain't
[1:22:15] happening all at once it's day by day
[1:22:17] day by day little by little something's
[1:22:20] taking place amen
[1:22:24] now what happens when God and man become
[1:22:26] one now notice because I think this is
[1:22:29] important and this helps us understand
[1:22:32] who we
[1:22:33] are brother Braham said God is in him
[1:22:38] when man and God become one God is in
[1:22:42] him God in the man God speaks through
[1:22:45] him he's no more his
[1:22:48] own but he's God's Voice through human
[1:22:51] lips praise the Lord Hallelujah and
[1:22:54] every believer in him tonight is
[1:22:56] likewise possessed so possessed so
[1:22:59] completely given over till his words
[1:23:01] become like the words of
[1:23:04] Christ he speaks and the word is made
[1:23:08] flesh he speaks and the word is
[1:23:12] manifested the works that I do shall you
[1:23:15] do also these sign shall follow them
[1:23:17] that believe can you say amen and God
[1:23:20] comes in you his body to make that word
[1:23:26] live Hallelujah that's right that's
[1:23:28] where we are praise the Lord Brother
[1:23:31] brandom says in another place when the
[1:23:33] word becomes flesh it is manifested
[1:23:35] that's right can you say amen amen
[1:23:38] that's right when the word becomes flesh
[1:23:40] it is manifested so what God was in
[1:23:43] Christ he is in
[1:23:45] you this then requires the bride which
[1:23:48] is the body of Christ to have the same
[1:23:50] kind of faith that he had
[1:23:54] amen if we are to be the body of Christ
[1:23:57] have the same Ministry that Christ had
[1:23:59] have the same God that was in Christ now
[1:24:03] living in US it requires the same
[1:24:07] faith that Jesus had so brother brand
[1:24:11] said see have faith in what the word
[1:24:13] says you are and Jesus had faith in the
[1:24:16] word of God that said he he was uh said
[1:24:20] what he was it is written of Me Jesus
[1:24:24] could take the scriptures and say it is
[1:24:25] written of me it is written of me it is
[1:24:28] written of me that's
[1:24:30] right well can't we not do the same amen
[1:24:34] we sure we can sure absolutely whether
[1:24:36] we we whether we're receiving accolades
[1:24:39] from men or not the word says word says
[1:24:43] what I am and it is written of me
[1:24:46] written on me see we all going to meet
[1:24:48] the challenge we're all going to face
[1:24:50] the devil we're all going to face
[1:24:51] Temptations we're all going to the
[1:24:53] devil's going to knock us flat and when
[1:24:55] I say that when I say the devil going to
[1:24:58] knock us flat I that may be a wrong
[1:25:00] statement because let's say it this way
[1:25:02] the devil's going to try to knock us
[1:25:04] flat he's going to try to knock us off
[1:25:07] our feet he's going to do everything he
[1:25:09] can to get us to quit to get us to doubt
[1:25:13] to get us to to to not necessarily to
[1:25:17] get you to leave a
[1:25:21] church
[1:25:30] quit believing in what you
[1:25:32] are that's right and what the word says
[1:25:35] can you say amen
[1:25:37] yeah now I know there there are there
[1:25:39] are guys you
[1:25:41] know they they can they can go they can
[1:25:45] mess up they can do things illegal they
[1:25:47] can they can they they can do things and
[1:25:50] it doesn't bother them about about it
[1:25:52] they just do it and then they but we're
[1:25:57] we're it really hurts Believers is
[1:26:00] because they really want to be right
[1:26:02] amen and and and then they'll slip up or
[1:26:05] they do something and then the devil's
[1:26:06] right
[1:26:08] there and and uh he he's there to to to
[1:26:13] tell them well you you flubbed up this
[1:26:15] time you've done this you've done that
[1:26:16] you've done this and he he's able to to
[1:26:19] to really try to affect him
[1:26:22] probably more than someone that is just
[1:26:24] so
[1:26:25] callous and they don't care yeah because
[1:26:30] you know a person that really wants to
[1:26:32] do right well brother Brian said the
[1:26:33] moment you see that you're wrong you're
[1:26:34] going to repent of it and and yet that
[1:26:38] ain't going to stop Satan from just
[1:26:41] constantly hounding you that's right on
[1:26:43] these things because he knows what your
[1:26:46] heart is so by faith you have to look
[1:26:49] past that all right I hope that makes
[1:26:52] sense you have to have faith in the
[1:26:54] blood you have to have faith in the word
[1:26:55] of God you have to have faith in in all
[1:26:57] of this to stand on your own two feet
[1:27:01] and say but it's under the blood Satan
[1:27:04] right it's under the blood that's right
[1:27:06] and and and this this keep doing and
[1:27:08] doing and doing and doing I think
[1:27:10] there's a power of God that'll break the
[1:27:14] habits do you just believe that I
[1:27:17] believe the power of God will break
[1:27:19] habits in a man's life amen
[1:27:23] amen and so have faith in what the word
[1:27:26] says you are that's it and Jesus had
[1:27:29] faith in the word of God that said that
[1:27:31] he was it is written of me didn't David
[1:27:34] in the Psalms and the prophets and all
[1:27:36] of them speak of him I am the bread of
[1:27:38] life Jesus said that come from God out
[1:27:40] of Heaven amen I am the tree of life
[1:27:43] that come from the Garden of Eden see I
[1:27:45] am all of these things I am that I am
[1:27:47] see he knew with that perfect faith that
[1:27:50] he was the anointed Messiah
[1:27:52] that the spirit of God was upon
[1:27:55] Him lot of statements that he would make
[1:27:58] that would Flor the people but it didn't
[1:28:01] matter he knew where he
[1:28:04] was he understood his position praise
[1:28:07] Lord he said now I in myself can do
[1:28:09] nothing but it's my faith in God and God
[1:28:12] was in him the word made manifest and
[1:28:15] when the word of God comes in you it's
[1:28:17] made manifest for you are a Believer can
[1:28:21] you say Amen the word of God comes in
[1:28:23] you it is made manifest for you are a
[1:28:26] Believer now brother brandom says in
[1:28:28] another place that super sense is
[1:28:32] God can you say Amen that super sense
[1:28:35] brother Bram talked about it's that six
[1:28:37] sense the super sense Faith sup Superior
[1:28:40] Faith that's
[1:28:42] God the faith of God in you the part of
[1:28:45] God that comes into you gives you the
[1:28:48] super sense and by that same super sense
[1:28:52] God framed the world together with
[1:28:53] things which was not and did not appear
[1:28:56] see and and so in other words it was
[1:28:59] already there like like like people
[1:29:01] invent things and think they're really
[1:29:03] great because they've invented it I
[1:29:06] think I've told you about the two
[1:29:07] scientist you know uh you know that that
[1:29:11] was talking to God about things you know
[1:29:14] and says you know we're equal to you and
[1:29:17] and and he says oh yeah you are huh he
[1:29:19] says oh yeah says we we we've invented
[1:29:22] this we've done this we've done that he
[1:29:24] said we can even create man now oh you
[1:29:27] can he said well show me so they got a
[1:29:30] handful of dirt he goes you got to go
[1:29:32] get your own
[1:29:34] dirt
[1:29:36] well man can do whatever they want to
[1:29:38] but they do things that is already
[1:29:41] visible already material that God would
[1:29:44] make things that did not appear That's
[1:29:47] the God we
[1:29:48] serve can you say amen and that was
[1:29:51] where Jesus's Faith was he didn't have
[1:29:54] to have things and so is it the faith
[1:29:57] that is today the Lord so we find by
[1:30:00] that same superent see God framed the
[1:30:03] world together with things which was not
[1:30:05] and did not appear see he spoke his word
[1:30:08] and believed his word and a world shook
[1:30:10] into existence now that super sense is
[1:30:15] the Holy Spirit the faith of God that
[1:30:18] dwells in you ain't that right now Jesus
[1:30:22] understood by the scriptures as to who
[1:30:24] he was that's where he got his
[1:30:26] understanding how would we have a
[1:30:30] understanding in the word if the lamb
[1:30:34] hadn't come and opened the book that's
[1:30:36] right amen and you say amen amen amen
[1:30:41] then he opens that book and he sends it
[1:30:43] down as the prophet said to that seventh
[1:30:45] angel to reveal it to his people if he
[1:30:47] hadn't done that we wouldn't be able to
[1:30:50] have the faith that we have today
[1:30:53] today because we've got to have
[1:30:56] understanding by the
[1:30:59] scriptures now people understood what
[1:31:01] they were their understanding of what
[1:31:04] they were came from oil coming out of
[1:31:06] their hands wrong
[1:31:09] understanding a lot of people's
[1:31:11] understanding comes by by you know uh uh
[1:31:14] uh doing it doing a jig dancing speaking
[1:31:17] in tongue prophesying come on but that
[1:31:20] Jesus already told notice that many
[1:31:22] would come in say Lord have we not cast
[1:31:24] out devils in thy name have we not
[1:31:25] prophesied in the name have we not done
[1:31:27] this in thy name and he says depart from
[1:31:29] me you workers of
[1:31:31] iniquity so our understanding doesn't
[1:31:34] come from all of that even though we
[1:31:36] believe in them things I do I believe if
[1:31:39] you're a Believer you will believe in
[1:31:40] those things but our faith isn't in that
[1:31:44] our faith is in the solid word of God
[1:31:47] can you say Amen so then you know God
[1:31:50] tells John and Daniel both to seal up
[1:31:53] the book till the end of time then it
[1:31:56] takes a prophet it took a prophet to
[1:31:59] reveal it amen that's why we hold to
[1:32:02] this prophet of Malachi 4 it's the only
[1:32:05] way we can return back to being the body
[1:32:07] of Christ and what Christ the same
[1:32:10] Ministry that Christ had is now in the
[1:32:12] church but it couldn't be without a
[1:32:15] prophet because our understanding comes
[1:32:18] from the word and the word comes to a
[1:32:21] prophet
[1:32:22] amen that's right notice the prophet
[1:32:25] says God promised in his word that he
[1:32:27] would choose his bride by his original
[1:32:29] way he chose his the bridegroom he for
[1:32:34] he forto it by the prophets and sent a
[1:32:36] prophet to identify it amen see the
[1:32:41] prophet said standing on the banks of
[1:32:42] Jordan behold they said are you the
[1:32:44] Messiah you're the Messiah aren't you he
[1:32:46] said no I'm not the Messiah you must be
[1:32:48] the Messiah no I'm not him but he he is
[1:32:51] standing among you and his shoes I'm not
[1:32:54] worthy to loosen right see when he comes
[1:32:58] makes himself known and today he's
[1:33:01] standing Among
[1:33:03] Us the Lord can you say amen amen and
[1:33:07] notice a prophet would
[1:33:09] identify where he's not
[1:33:14] at he's not in the organizations that
[1:33:17] turn him down amen hallelujah ain't that
[1:33:21] right right right he's not in all the
[1:33:24] gimmicks and
[1:33:27] impersonations but that didn't mean that
[1:33:29] he wasn't here for he's standing Among
[1:33:33] Us ain't that right notice he's standing
[1:33:37] Among Us in the person of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:39] manifesting himself more and more coming
[1:33:43] into his church making himself known
[1:33:47] because him and the bride and the groom
[1:33:50] will be the same name making himself
[1:33:53] known and one day you'll see that the
[1:33:56] one that you filled in your heart and
[1:33:59] see his identification will become
[1:34:01] personalized before you then you and he
[1:34:05] are one Hallelujah and notice what a
[1:34:08] prophet says you've
[1:34:10] United by the
[1:34:13] word can you say that with me
[1:34:15] United by the word I love it not by
[1:34:19] feelings not by sens ations not by not
[1:34:23] by your past not by this not by that you
[1:34:27] know the only thing you've unite can
[1:34:30] unite him by is by the word you've
[1:34:32] United by the
[1:34:34] word what is it you've taken his word
[1:34:36] you've believed it you've identified
[1:34:38] Yourself by the word you've identified
[1:34:41] your actions by the word you've
[1:34:43] identified everything by the word of God
[1:34:46] can you say Amen you've United by the
[1:34:49] word and the Word was in the beginning
[1:34:51] will go back to the beginning which is
[1:34:53] God and that day you'll know that I'm in
[1:34:56] the father and the father in me and I in
[1:34:59] you and you and me Hallelujah then he
[1:35:01] says we're
[1:35:03] here amen we're here we're here to that
[1:35:07] Revelation we're here where a people is
[1:35:10] really understanding that he is in them
[1:35:14] and they are in him they're
[1:35:17] understanding who they
[1:35:19] are amen
[1:35:22] he said' I'm so glad to see him
[1:35:23] personifying himself right Among Us and
[1:35:27] see what he promised for the word not
[1:35:29] what somebody's emotion singing jumping
[1:35:32] and dancing but by his word his word
[1:35:35] amen he is making himself
[1:35:39] known by his word he is making himself
[1:35:44] known do you love the
[1:35:46] Lord if the musicians will
[1:35:49] come brother brandham said said see the
[1:35:52] true word comes to the true Prophet yes
[1:35:55] amen and he tells you the true word
[1:35:59] hallelujah say that again the true word
[1:36:02] comes to the true prophet and he tells
[1:36:04] you the true word you follow that true
[1:36:08] word and you get an A true experience of
[1:36:11] the word good because the word is made
[1:36:15] flesh in you are you believing this
[1:36:17] prophet in vain absolutely not come on
[1:36:20] now are you denying the world in vain

[1:36:29] world absolutely not it's not in
[1:36:32] vain people leave but it's not in vain
[1:36:35] for us to
[1:36:37] stay why because the word as we believe
[1:36:40] in the word we becoming the word ain't
[1:36:44] that right we're getting a true
[1:36:45] experience of the word this ain't
[1:36:48] impersonation thing amen won't be
[1:36:51] not something made up this is a true
[1:36:54] experience of the word amen that's what
[1:36:58] a lot of folks don't understand about us
[1:37:00] getting
[1:37:02] excited they call it Pentecostalism well
[1:37:05] it is
[1:37:07] Pentecostalism it's acts 238 it's it's a
[1:37:10] day of Pentecost
[1:37:12] thing God birthed this church then am
[1:37:15] they acted
[1:37:17] drunk they acted out of their
[1:37:20] minds they they were beside themselves
[1:37:23] amen they did yes but more than just
[1:37:27] that it's already prophesied that the
[1:37:29] sons of God shatter for Joy before the
[1:37:32] foundation of the
[1:37:36] world we we there there's no way that a
[1:37:40] Believer is going to go get into
[1:37:42] formalism I know they criticize our
[1:37:45] meetings I know they criticize these
[1:37:47] things say that we're all in the flesh
[1:37:49] well some of them may be in the the
[1:37:51] flesh who cares that's right that's
[1:37:54] right brother that's right but it's a
[1:37:57] word experience
[1:37:59] amen there's nothing wrong with shouting
[1:38:01] there's nothing wrong with Amen in the
[1:38:03] word there's nothing wrong with with
[1:38:05] getting excited about what's being
[1:38:08] preached why it it's it's a true word
[1:38:13] experience John saw that the lamb opened
[1:38:16] the
[1:38:17] book he he got so excited he got beside
[1:38:20] him self John said brother Bown said
[1:38:23] John must have had a had a time why he
[1:38:27] saw his name in the book he actually
[1:38:30] understood his position yes he
[1:38:34] did Brother brand said that all happened
[1:38:37] in our day he was caught up in the

[1:39:03] tells you the true word you follow that
[1:39:05] true word and you get a true experience

[1:39:14] revolving right out of God into
[1:39:18] you because you are of his nature his
