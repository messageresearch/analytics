[37:17] Jesus
[37:19] amen I'd like to uh just read the U
[37:24] scripture here in Mark 10 and 13

[37:33] he should touch them and his disciples
[37:36] rebuked those that brought them but when
[37:39] Jesus saw it he was much displeased and
[37:41] said unto them suffer the little
[37:43] children to come unto me and forbid them
[37:46] not for of such is the kingdom of God
[37:50] and verily I say unto you whosoever
[37:52] shall not receive the kingdom of God as
[37:54] a little child he shall not enter
[37:56] therein

[43:15] love and appreciate brother Mike and um
[43:18] uh just a good brother uh there and uh
[43:21] doing a work there in um in I guess near
[43:25] Washington and um so uh I know you'd be
[43:29] blessed and you'd be a blessing Amen to
[43:31] him as well uh The Book of Matthew the
[43:35] 20th chapter and uh going to start at
[43:38] the 20th
[43:44] verse praise the
[43:50] Lord uh Matthew 20 and
[43:55] 20 it says then came to him the mother
[43:58] of zebedee's children with her sons
[44:02] worshiping him and Desiring a certain
[44:05] thing of him and he said unto
[44:08] her what will
[44:10] thou she saith unto him grant that these
[44:14] my two sons May sit the one on the right
[44:18] hand and the other on the left in thy
[44:22] kingdom but Jesus answered and said you
[44:25] know not
[44:26] what you ask are you able to drink of
[44:29] the cup that I shall drink of and to be
[44:31] baptized with the baptism that I am
[44:33] baptized with they say unto him we are
[44:37] able and he saith unto them you shall
[44:40] drink indeed of my cup and be baptized
[44:43] with the baptism that I am baptized with
[44:45] but to sit on my right hand and on my
[44:48] left is not mine to give but it shall be
[44:51] given to them for whom it is prepared of
[44:54] my father
[44:56] and when the 10 heard it they were moved
[45:00] with
[45:01] indignation against the two Brethren but
[45:04] Jesus called them unto him and said you
[45:07] know that the princes of the Gentiles
[45:09] exercise dominion over
[45:12] them and they that are great exercise
[45:15] authority over them but it shall uh not
[45:18] be so among you but whosoever will be
[45:22] great among you let him be your minister
[45:26] and whosoever shall be Chief among you
[45:29] let him be your servant even as the son
[45:32] of man came not to be ministered unto
[45:35] but to minister and to give his life a
[45:38] ransom for many amen let's just bow our
[45:43] heads and ask the Lord to be with us
[45:46] today
[45:47] Father Lord we know that your word is is
[45:51] already anointed it's it was given by
[45:54] inspiration
[45:56] but Lord we're asking that you would
[46:00] Inspire us
[46:02] Lord not only me that it would be
[46:06] speaking but also the
[46:09] hearing Lord and that you would just
[46:12] Elevate us into a Heavenly atmosphere
[46:17] father and that you would open the
[46:20] scriptures unto us father and Lord that
[46:23] you would give us the words to say and
[46:25] Lord Lord may it just be an edification
[46:29] to your people Lord and that we when we
[46:32] leave this place we'd be drawn closer to
[46:35] you and more determined Lord to to serve
[46:40] you father I pray Lord that you would
[46:43] forgive us of all of our sins and our
[46:45] failures Lord and father we commit this
[46:48] service into your hands those that are
[46:51] sick and are afflicted father in their
[46:53] bodies father I pray that you would
[46:55] touch touch them Lord make them whole is
[46:58] our prayer we ask it in Jesus Christ's
[47:01] name and the church
[47:03] says amen you can have your seats this
[47:08] morning
[47:10] amen and
[47:11] [Music]
[47:13] um I want to uh just talk along the
[47:17] lines of
[47:19] ministry and um I I can't seem to get
[47:24] away from this this thought
[47:27] and um but uh when we thinking of
[47:31] minister to minister it is to wait upon
[47:35] others to serve the need of others to
[47:39] supply what is needed to care for so
[47:44] that that's what Minister uh uh to to
[47:47] minister to waiting upon others to serve
[47:50] the need of others to supply what is
[47:52] needed and and to care for and so
[47:56] uh Jesus in speaking of the parable of
[48:01] the Good Samaritan he he he gives us an
[48:04] idea of what
[48:06] Ministry is or what it is to minister
[48:10] and you know he talks about the Good
[48:12] Samaritan walking along the the road and
[48:15] he he finds this man that had been uh
[48:19] robbed and and been beaten and been left
[48:22] to die and he he talked of how that
[48:26] there was the the priest that had walked
[48:28] by and looked at him and just kept going
[48:31] on and and he talked about the levite
[48:34] that had come and looked at him and and
[48:37] saw him in his condition and just kept
[48:38] on walking and uh they did nothing to
[48:42] help but the the Samaritan looked upon
[48:45] this man and and had
[48:48] compassion and you know what what it it
[48:52] takes
[48:53] compassion uh to minister it it it uh
[48:57] when when there's no uh compassion then
[49:01] there's no Ministry and we know that
[49:04] brother brandham separated human
[49:06] compassion to Godly compassion and and
[49:10] uh uh so so this man uh uh the Good
[49:13] Samaritan had a a Godly compassion and
[49:17] uh you know brother brand I'm talking
[49:19] about this compassion he said Godly
[49:21] compassion it's in the reals of the
[49:24] spirit which means to do the will of him
[49:27] that sent you and so in another place he
[49:30] said you know people say that Jesus was
[49:33] full of compassion and he was but Godly
[49:37] compassion not not human sympathy but
[49:41] Godly
[49:42] compassion and and he says see human
[49:45] sympathy just throws everything in a
[49:48] puddle it just it just puts everything
[49:51] in in one lump sum but this this Good
[49:55] Samaritan uh he didn't you know he
[49:58] didn't have this uh uh uh type of
[50:02] compassion uh just to sit there and and
[50:05] and and talk to him and try to you know
[50:08] befriend him but just leaving him there
[50:11] and uh getting acquainted with him and
[50:14] and maybe getting to know his name and
[50:16] his telephone number and and all that
[50:18] and then walking away but there was a
[50:21] compassion to to to help this man and
[50:25] and so you know the church claims to
[50:27] have compassion the the natural but uh
[50:30] but we find that the natural Church
[50:32] doesn't have the type of compassion that
[50:35] this Samaritan uh uh had uh because
[50:39] they're they're leaving the people lay
[50:42] where they're at without the the the
[50:45] burden to restore them back to Sons and
[50:49] Daughters of God and and and so this
[50:52] this this Samaritan as as as Jesus said
[50:57] um uh he he bound up this man's wounds
[51:01] and and poured Jesus said he poured oil
[51:05] and and wine uh in into the wounds and
[51:08] of course uh uh the oil represents the
[51:12] Holy Spirit and and we know what wine
[51:15] represents it's it's it's stimulation of
[51:18] Revelation and and so uh uh this is what
[51:22] Good Samaritan is today is is pouring
[51:26] the oil you know he he had oil and wine
[51:31] which which uh that's that's what he was
[51:33] using to minister to to this uh uh uh
[51:38] this this this poor man and and and
[51:42] so there's all kinds of ministry but the
[51:45] church to to Really depict this and or
[51:50] be be this uh uh have the ministry that
[51:54] this this Good Samaritan had they've got
[51:56] to have the oil and the
[51:58] wine excuse me and and then the Bible
[52:02] says that that the Good Samaritan picked
[52:05] this man up and he set this man on his
[52:08] own Beast the Good Samaritan set this
[52:11] this man on on his his his beast and and
[52:15] we know what Beast represents it
[52:17] represents power so it wasn't a
[52:20] political power that the Good Samaritans
[52:23] set this man on it wasn't the Church
[52:25] power or uh whatever but he set him on
[52:30] his own his own power that the power
[52:34] that he was riding on he set this man on
[52:38] on that power and and and so uh uh the
[52:42] church has a a different Power uh uh so
[52:46] that's part of the ministry is is
[52:48] putting him on the in this hooking him
[52:50] up so to speak with the same power but
[52:53] uh uh he brought him to to an in which
[52:56] the prophet he said that the in was the
[52:58] house of God and and took care of him
[53:01] and then as he was fixing to leave he he
[53:05] gave two pence um uh to the inkeeper um
[53:10] uh which brother Bram says the inkeeper
[53:12] the pastor and and and and he gave the
[53:16] two pence and which was he said
[53:18] represented the spirit and the word amen
[53:22] uh not not programs and and not not uh
[53:26] talents but but the thing that he gave
[53:28] him was the spirit and the word amen and
[53:32] and told him to take care of the man and
[53:34] if he needed anything else he would give
[53:36] it to them uh when he came ain't that
[53:39] right and so uh brother brandom said you
[53:43] don't have to worry about you know the
[53:46] minister uh he's already been paid you
[53:49] know and and and and so he's paid to
[53:52] take care of of of of the the individual
[53:56] and and I I think that that goes with
[53:59] every minister of the Gospel that that
[54:02] sets behind the the the sacred desk or
[54:05] stands behind this the sacred desk is is
[54:09] is the spirit and the word ain't that
[54:12] right so so uh Christian Life the
[54:15] Christian life is all about ministering
[54:19] to others and uh this has just been
[54:22] something on my heart for for a long
[54:24] time and
[54:25] uh and and I pray that it'll it'll help
[54:28] us in some way but God has given us the
[54:33] ability uh to influence others and I've
[54:38] been listening to uh brother Brandon
[54:41] preached several sermons on
[54:43] influence and excuse me but he he didn't
[54:47] just preach one sermon but he preached
[54:50] several of them which which tells me
[54:53] there there's a reason that he's
[54:54] preaching it and he's he preached it
[54:56] right before the SE opening of the seals
[54:58] and then he preaches it after the seals
[55:01] and so it's something that uh God is is
[55:05] trying to get to us and and and so he uh
[55:09] God gave us the ability to be an
[55:11] influence and this word influence means
[55:14] to
[55:15] impact uh to affect to sway others by
[55:20] what we
[55:21] do how we act what we say
[55:25] it's it's an influence and so most of us
[55:30] all and and I I'll just say all of us
[55:33] are going to be an influence in one way
[55:37] or
[55:38] another uh by the way we live by how we
[55:42] act by what the things that we
[55:46] say uh uh because as the prophet said
[55:49] somebody is watching your life amen and
[55:53] and and help us God someone is watching
[55:57] us and and no matter if we don't want to
[56:00] be involved in the church no matter if
[56:02] we don't want to be involved with people
[56:04] or whatever somebody is going to watch
[56:08] us uh in in whatever way true uh we no
[56:12] matter how isolated you want to be or or
[56:16] involved or whatever you're being
[56:18] watched and so uh brother BR says
[56:22] then when we profess that we're
[56:26] Christians then that magnifies it
[56:29] magnifies of the of what people are
[56:31] going to watch for and so he says see
[56:35] what type of life should we live if
[56:38] somebody is watching us the moment we
[56:40] say we're Christians and and and and
[56:43] we'll even say it the moment we say we
[56:45] go to church well that's going to
[56:46] identify you that you're supposed to be
[56:48] a Christian if you're going to church
[56:50] the moment you you you uh uh so he says
[56:54] and your life life that you live will
[56:57] reflect an influence on somebody see and
[57:01] so they know as what he says now their
[57:04] Eternal
[57:06] destination will rest upon the way that
[57:10] you live and the things that you do for
[57:14] they watch you now brother brandham said
[57:17] in one place a lot of time people won't
[57:18] go to church but but they'll watch you
[57:21] they won't read the Bible but you'll be
[57:23] the Bible that they'll you may be the
[57:25] only Bible that they'll ever read amen
[57:28] is you so
[57:31] so and and so uh uh you know as parents
[57:35] we we we I think it starts at the home
[57:38] that that parents uh uh we we we the
[57:42] brother Brown you know and we all know
[57:43] it so it ain't no new revelation we may
[57:47] just try to keep it as a secret but our
[57:49] worst and our best that we live is at
[57:53] home how we how we live uh it's going to
[57:57] be our our worst and best will be
[57:59] manifested at home because that's that's
[58:02] that's our home we're more relaxed there
[58:05] we're more that's that's where we're at
[58:07] every day you know and and so then then
[58:11] our children our children uh uh uh are
[58:15] watching us he says even though that
[58:18] they may act like they're not but they
[58:21] are noticing it they notice everything
[58:25] that we do so you know a lot of folks
[58:28] say well if I could just you know uh if
[58:31] I could just be an evangelist out in the
[58:33] world and evangelize the whole world
[58:37] well you
[58:38] know I don't know what it is but we'll
[58:40] get there uh brother brandom said you
[58:44] may not be called to uh uh uh how how
[58:49] was he said this uh to make his
[58:52] reputation known around the
[58:55] World by by ministering the gospel but
[58:59] you can make his reputation known by
[59:03] your life right now God may have not
[59:06] called us to to evangelize Around The
[59:09] World God may have not even called us to
[59:11] be an evangelist period uh and to
[59:14] minister behind uh other pulpits or
[59:18] whatever but a lot of times we we we
[59:23] forget
[59:25] that even the greatest influence that we
[59:29] could ever have is at at home because
[59:33] our wife is watching our children are
[59:36] watching or we could say our husband is
[59:39] watching our children are watching and
[59:43] and so but but so he says see don't
[59:46] don't never think that the children are
[59:50] are not watching or the wife ain't
[59:53] watching or or that that you you you're
[59:57] not impacting the home uh because they
[1:00:02] are watching they're they're watching
[1:00:04] everything I i' I've lived away from
[1:00:06] home for for many year now and and and I
[1:00:10] still watch my parents I I their life
[1:00:14] still affects me by by how I see them in
[1:00:19] their troubles and in their trials and
[1:00:21] this Parkinson that Dad has has had and
[1:00:25] I've watched him I've I know that he's
[1:00:27] been uh a true true man I've seen him in
[1:00:31] his flaws I've seen more flaws in my dad
[1:00:34] than anyone would know uh because I'm
[1:00:37] I'm his child and so we've seen behind
[1:00:39] the scenes of thing but what has stood
[1:00:42] out more than anything is he was a man
[1:00:45] of God and he reflected Christ and so
[1:00:49] now I'm looking and I see him in his
[1:00:52] condition and and and and and you know
[1:00:55] basically if God doesn't do anything for
[1:00:57] him in the way of healing him he's got a
[1:01:00] death sentence it's a it's a slow death
[1:01:03] but it's it's just what it is and and so
[1:01:06] you see him deter deteriorating but
[1:01:09] every time I'm around him he talking
[1:01:11] about prayer and how we need to pray
[1:01:14] more and and and and how that he just
[1:01:17] loves the Lord and and and he's
[1:01:20] confident and and and always just
[1:01:23] talking about the things of God well see
[1:01:26] that's an influence in my life that that
[1:01:29] if and I always pray God God if I go
[1:01:32] through things don't let me complain and
[1:01:33] I know I have complained and I know I
[1:01:36] have shed tears and I'm not saying that
[1:01:38] he doesn't go through struggles I'm not
[1:01:40] saying he doesn't go through his
[1:01:41] depressions and and things like that and
[1:01:43] there's times that you know uh uh I I
[1:01:46] will you know send a text and because he
[1:01:48] can't talk much so I send a text and
[1:01:51] I'll just send scripture or quote or
[1:01:54] just something positive he says I needed
[1:01:56] that you know thank you I needed that
[1:01:59] see so so uh uh but but uh there's an
[1:02:02] influence and but brother BR says it's
[1:02:05] not only the children that watches it's
[1:02:07] our neighbors that are watching he said
[1:02:10] everyone that you're associated with
[1:02:12] they're they're they're watching you
[1:02:14] people at your church are watching you
[1:02:18] uh uh the times that you know the people
[1:02:20] miss the times that people you know uh
[1:02:23] have lousy excuses as to why they can't
[1:02:25] come to church well they're being
[1:02:26] watched you know and and when they're
[1:02:29] Church hopping and going here and going
[1:02:31] there instead of at their post of Duty
[1:02:33] and well the people are watching it's
[1:02:36] everything is is an influence and and uh
[1:02:41] um you know people you do business with
[1:02:43] they're watching the children that you
[1:02:45] go to school with they're they're
[1:02:47] watching your life especially when you
[1:02:49] say I'm a Christian well they they're
[1:02:51] looking for something that would set
[1:02:54] separate you from their worldly
[1:02:57] Associates so they're they're really
[1:02:59] watching and a lot of times they'll
[1:03:01] antagonize you sometimes they'll test
[1:03:04] you sometimes they'll make fun of you
[1:03:07] just to get a reaction and see what kind
[1:03:10] of a genuine Christian you really are
[1:03:13] see because it's an influence people at
[1:03:16] the grocery store wherever you go
[1:03:19] they're watching you and and and so
[1:03:22] therefore it should keep us on our toes
[1:03:25] uh uh as to what things we say and and
[1:03:29] and what we do and what we listen to how
[1:03:33] we act and and and these things we
[1:03:35] should not be one to try to fit in with
[1:03:40] what they're doing amen they tell the
[1:03:42] dirty jokes we shouldn't laugh with that
[1:03:45] we shouldn't we shouldn't try to uh to
[1:03:48] make them feel comfortable around us in
[1:03:51] the sense that we don't want to stand
[1:03:53] out amen God called you to stand out and
[1:03:56] if you're ever going to have a positive
[1:03:59] act uh influence on a people's life
[1:04:01] you've got to be the one to stand out
[1:04:04] can you say Amen there's a lot of
[1:04:05] Christians out there that are smoking
[1:04:07] and cussing and swearing well you know
[1:04:10] their influence is so wrong that people
[1:04:14] don't want that anymore am can you say
[1:04:17] Amen they don't want to go to church
[1:04:19] anymore they don't want to believe in a
[1:04:20] God that can't keep they're looking for
[1:04:23] influence
[1:04:24] that is something greater than what they
[1:04:27] have seen and so we should as the
[1:04:30] prophet says we should always try to
[1:04:32] reflect Christ in everything everybody
[1:04:35] say in everything that we do see not
[1:04:38] just in the public eye but as at home as
[1:04:42] as well and and and brother brandom had
[1:04:45] a model uh uh plaque that that had a
[1:04:48] model that he hung up in his home that
[1:04:50] says go no place that you would not want
[1:04:52] to be found if Jesus should come don't
[1:04:56] don't say anything that you wouldn't
[1:04:58] want to be saying if Jesus could come
[1:05:01] don't you be watching things that you
[1:05:03] wouldn't want to watch if Jesus would
[1:05:06] come see and and we know that Jesus is
[1:05:09] coming but more than anything we should
[1:05:12] be such a a a conscience of the presence
[1:05:17] of God With Us that we would be very
[1:05:21] careful with what we say because we know
[1:05:23] he's listening he knows the very
[1:05:25] thoughts that you think he knows the
[1:05:27] very words that you think he knows the
[1:05:30] very motive and the intent of our heart
[1:05:33] amen and the problem the prophet said is
[1:05:36] people do the things they do because
[1:05:38] they're not conscience that God is
[1:05:40] watching they're not conscious that God
[1:05:42] is listening they're not conscious that
[1:05:45] God knows the very thoughts that they
[1:05:48] entertain amen see and so therefore
[1:05:52] there's always there there there's
[1:05:54] always two ways to doing things and
[1:05:56] that's the right way and the wrong way
[1:05:58] ain't that right brother Ram talks about
[1:06:01] his son Joseph who was eight at the time
[1:06:04] and and the boy you know he got in a
[1:06:06] fight with another boy and and the boy
[1:06:09] had uh stepped on Joseph's toes and and
[1:06:12] and so they got in the fight and brother
[1:06:14] Bram told him says you know Joseph don't
[1:06:16] don't don't do that see but he says but
[1:06:19] Daddy he did such and such you know and
[1:06:23] and he says but and and and brother BR
[1:06:25] tells but that doesn't matter see what
[1:06:28] that boy did just remember Joseph he
[1:06:31] said do you love your father yes Daddy
[1:06:33] he said well then remember that people
[1:06:36] are going to look at your life now
[1:06:38] notice how he's starting 8 years old and
[1:06:41] he's already teaching this his boy that
[1:06:45] you're going to be an influence at 8
[1:06:47] years old there's going to be people
[1:06:49] watching and and he say see he says that
[1:06:53] they're going to look at you your life
[1:06:54] as a minister son and then if you if you
[1:06:57] do anything wrong then they're going to
[1:06:59] say well does this Minister permit his
[1:07:01] child to do sex and sex see and and and
[1:07:04] brother brand said well see we know that
[1:07:05] there you know children are going to do
[1:07:07] wrong and all these things we know that
[1:07:10] see but he said to him he said see he
[1:07:13] said now that doesn't only reflect on
[1:07:15] you Joseph but it reflects on your
[1:07:17] mother it reflects on your sisters see
[1:07:20] and and and young people I want to say
[1:07:21] this you got Christian parents that are
[1:07:24] trying to do right that are trying to
[1:07:26] live right your actions reflects upon
[1:07:28] them as well can you say Amen see so he
[1:07:32] says it reflects on your father the very
[1:07:35] cause of the family that of what we're
[1:07:38] standing for then what we stand for see
[1:07:41] it reflects on Jesus Christ CU we're
[1:07:44] claiming to be him uh uh uh his his
[1:07:47] bride we're claiming to be uh United
[1:07:50] with him and then therefore it it
[1:07:53] reflects upon on Christ if we say we
[1:07:56] have the Holy Ghost and we live like a
[1:07:58] devil and and we act like a devil we
[1:08:01] talk and and we're looking at evil
[1:08:03] things and and we're just running at the
[1:08:05] mouth and we're throwing our little
[1:08:07] temper tantrums every time we turn
[1:08:09] around that we're treating our wife like
[1:08:11] she's just a bunch of trash and and our
[1:08:13] children and all of these things well
[1:08:16] then what are you doing you're
[1:08:18] reflecting Christ your actions are
[1:08:21] actually a reflection of what you claim
[1:08:24] to have within you ain't that right so
[1:08:27] see he says then what we stand for it
[1:08:31] reflects on that on Jesus Christ you
[1:08:33] don't want to do that see and I said see
[1:08:37] so our Lord told us see if somebody
[1:08:39] smites us on the on One Cheek just turn
[1:08:41] the other he well that's kind of a hard
[1:08:43] for a little boy with a high temper to
[1:08:45] begin with of such a things but he says
[1:08:47] but but place it before him anyhow that
[1:08:53] he should not do it can you say amen I
[1:08:55] have found uh you know sometimes when
[1:08:58] when their children are done wrong
[1:09:00] parents will go up there and say go slap
[1:09:01] him you know well you're teaching them
[1:09:04] wrong see place it before them I promise
[1:09:07] you they're going to do it anyhow you
[1:09:09] know uh uh when you're not looking how
[1:09:11] many times I guarantee you my boys have
[1:09:14] done it you know turning around just I
[1:09:16] have you know I remember you know uh I
[1:09:20] my dad was the principal he was the
[1:09:22] associate pastor and I was a real poor
[1:09:24] reflection you know on him you know uh
[1:09:28] uh especially when he ain't looking you
[1:09:30] know so he was he was somewhere else and
[1:09:33] actually he wasn't even there that day
[1:09:35] and so so some boy come up and and and
[1:09:38] said something to me and and and I just
[1:09:40] turned around and knocked the knocked
[1:09:42] him flat you know and and uh you know
[1:09:46] and and what I didn't realize as the
[1:09:48] teacher was sitting there watching and
[1:09:51] uh of course she went and told my dad
[1:09:53] you know and
[1:09:54] he let me know real quick that was a
[1:09:56] poor reflection you know on him you know
[1:09:59] and and uh uh but you know uh it's that
[1:10:03] way and and so but but but we we got to
[1:10:06] teach our children you know that that uh
[1:10:10] uh uh there's an influence with
[1:10:13] everything ain't that right now
[1:10:15] Galatians 6 and 2 it says bear ye one
[1:10:19] another's burdens and so fulfill the law
[1:10:23] of Christ bear everybody say bear ye one
[1:10:27] another's burdens bear ye one another's
[1:10:31] burdens don't be just bear yours now
[1:10:35] bear the other person's burdens see in
[1:10:38] other words think of what they're going
[1:10:40] to do think of what they're going to say
[1:10:42] think of what you're going to put them
[1:10:43] through think of think of things of uh
[1:10:47] uh how you know we don't want to be TR
[1:10:49] put trials on people amen we want to be
[1:10:52] able to help people ain't that right see
[1:10:55] Philippians 2 and4 look not every man on
[1:10:58] his own things but every man also on the
[1:11:02] things of others that's right see now
[1:11:05] the problem today is no one wants to be
[1:11:08] accountable to others and the reason why
[1:11:12] is because the Bible says they're lovers
[1:11:15] of their own self pleasure lovers of
[1:11:18] pleasure more than lovers of God
[1:11:21] fulfilling see what was prophesied of
[1:11:23] them and so this is where we're at amen
[1:11:26] how many people buy for themselves
[1:11:28] instead of buying for other people you
[1:11:30] know and and they just putting it all on
[1:11:32] themselves all on themselves and they
[1:11:34] leave everybody else you know they can
[1:11:36] leave their own family in in in poverty
[1:11:39] and and they're buying this and they're
[1:11:40] buying that and they're buying this and
[1:11:42] it it has nothing to do except it has no
[1:11:44] value except what they want they'll buy
[1:11:47] this scope they'll buy this hunting gun
[1:11:49] they'll buy this camo they'll buy this
[1:11:52] you know and and and the families are
[1:11:54] living in poverty you see what it is
[1:11:56] it's a selfish selfish motives and and
[1:12:00] so uh but you know you see brother
[1:12:02] brandom said for a man to live to
[1:12:06] himself is to live for himself and the
[1:12:09] devil he said see if I live for myself I
[1:12:13] live for a a selfish life now now we we
[1:12:17] can find this selfishness in every part
[1:12:20] and and and I think every one of us can
[1:12:22] say that we we have an ounce of
[1:12:24] selfishness in us if if we're not
[1:12:26] careful how many of us husbands can be
[1:12:29] selfish and how many wives can be
[1:12:31] selfish how many children can be selfish
[1:12:34] amen see we become selfish in things and
[1:12:37] and when we do that then we're living
[1:12:41] for ourselves and it only shows that
[1:12:45] just how selfish we can be and we're
[1:12:48] living a selfish life now the prophet
[1:12:51] tells us that in for a man to be able to
[1:12:54] change amen because we're all born with
[1:12:57] this nature to be selfish it's all for
[1:12:59] me it's all for for my deal look what I
[1:13:02] have done look what I said look what I
[1:13:04] do look look look look how I act and and
[1:13:07] and you you you can make the bed or you
[1:13:09] can you know and or uh uh you you can do
[1:13:12] something small for somebody look at me
[1:13:14] see I'm the one that done that see and
[1:13:16] and and what it is it's it it's bringing
[1:13:19] out a selfishness you you understand
[1:13:22] what I'm saying see to we everybody oo
[1:13:24] and alls oh man he's a nice guy he
[1:13:26] really not now that that you know you
[1:13:29] understand what I'm saying but see we
[1:13:30] all have that type of a selfish nature
[1:13:33] within us see and and the only way for a
[1:13:36] man to change from being that way is to
[1:13:39] be born again Amen to be born again amen
[1:13:43] that's that's the only way that he'd be
[1:13:45] able to subdue that selfish nature amen
[1:13:48] see and and because New Birth brings
[1:13:51] forth new life ain't that right and
[1:13:53] brother Bram said in order for New Life
[1:13:55] to Come a sinner has to die and rought
[1:13:58] to his own ideas see he has to his own
[1:14:02] life has to die that old Sinful Nature
[1:14:04] has to die and Rod in order amen for New
[1:14:08] Life to grow out of it see the nature a
[1:14:11] new Nature has got to come so the old
[1:14:14] Nature has to first die and and to rot
[1:14:17] amen we have to die to our own thoughts
[1:14:20] and and rot so that God's thoughts can
[1:14:22] come in to us ain't that right so we can
[1:14:26] truly say and just just flat honest
[1:14:28] people ain't getting to a new birth amen
[1:14:31] as as they're claiming because they want
[1:14:33] to be entertained they they they are uh
[1:14:36] uh pleasure mad brother Brown called
[1:14:38] them pleasure mad people in in this day
[1:14:43] see if if if if it aches them to just to
[1:14:46] do some little thing if it's against
[1:14:48] their grain just to do something well
[1:14:50] they ain't going to do it nobody going
[1:14:51] to make them do it nobody going to tell
[1:14:54] them what to do you know they don't
[1:14:56] understand me you know well see it it's
[1:14:59] because there's a selfishness there
[1:15:00] that's why people don't don't have no
[1:15:02] burden for Souls anymore that's why
[1:15:04] people amen ain't witnessing to other
[1:15:07] people and telling them about God and
[1:15:09] and doing these things because they are
[1:15:11] so wrapped up in self and then put that
[1:15:15] in the church you understand what I'm
[1:15:17] saying so they not getting to a new
[1:15:19] birth they want to be entertained they
[1:15:22] are pleasure mad people they just want
[1:15:25] comfort and luxury brother Ram says see
[1:15:28] people walk about not knowing where they
[1:15:30] are going and seem to care less see just
[1:15:34] at leisure to go wherever they wish to
[1:15:38] and kind of pleasure seeking people see
[1:15:41] he's just about like he was when he left
[1:15:44] God at the Garden of Eden and was left
[1:15:47] to ship for himself he just simply
[1:15:49] leaves God out of the picture and just
[1:15:52] goes wherever he wishes to and kind of
[1:15:56] pleasure mad see this is what causes so
[1:15:59] much dissatisfaction in the home it
[1:16:03] causes dissatisfaction in the church it
[1:16:06] causes dissatisfaction on the job Amen
[1:16:10] to where the the boss has to meet every
[1:16:13] criteria of that individual or that
[1:16:15] individual is going to run him down and
[1:16:17] run the job down and run this and run
[1:16:19] that amen everything's got to be so
[1:16:22] perfect for that indiv idual the wife
[1:16:24] can't please him the husband can't
[1:16:25] please her and and and and children even
[1:16:29] children can't even please their parents
[1:16:31] or they the parents can't even please
[1:16:33] the children everyone is wanting to be
[1:16:36] pleased themselves and forgetting about
[1:16:40] Ministry ain't that right so there's so
[1:16:43] much
[1:16:44] dissatisfaction in the world and in the
[1:16:46] church and you know what what really the
[1:16:49] Bible calls them is unstable
[1:16:52] Souls unstable Souls looking for
[1:16:55] pleasure looking for entertainment
[1:16:57] looking to be pacified looking to be you
[1:17:00] know everybody to say the looking for
[1:17:02] the preacher to say the right things
[1:17:03] don't ever step on my foot you
[1:17:05] understand so they'll go Church to
[1:17:07] church seek it but the problem is amen
[1:17:10] let them sit there long enough and
[1:17:12] they're going to find every problem with
[1:17:13] that one so then they're going to run
[1:17:15] that preacher down they're going to run
[1:17:16] that Deacon down they're going to run
[1:17:17] that Saint down they're going to run
[1:17:19] that church down no one can be satisfied
[1:17:27] notice what Paul prophesied in 2 Timothy
[1:17:32] 4:3 for the time will come will they'll
[1:17:34] not endure sound Doctrine but after
[1:17:37] their own lust their own
[1:17:39] lust shall they Heap to themselves
[1:17:42] teachers having itching ears and they
[1:17:44] shall turn away their ears from the
[1:17:46] truth and shall be turned to fables of
[1:17:48] course fables is lies be turned to to
[1:17:52] lies
[1:17:53] where they actually believe the lie over
[1:17:55] the truth ain't that right so now the
[1:17:58] Amplified Bible says this for the time
[1:18:00] has coming when people will not
[1:18:02] tolerate or endure sound and wholesome
[1:18:06] instruction but having itching or ears
[1:18:09] itching for something pleading and
[1:18:12] gratifying this is what that itching ear
[1:18:15] means is they they're looking for
[1:18:17] something pleasing and
[1:18:19] gratifying they will gather to
[1:18:22] themselves one teacher after another to
[1:18:25] a considerable number chosen to satisfy
[1:18:28] their own liking and to Foster the
[1:18:30] errors they
[1:18:32] hold see and and and so no one wants to
[1:18:35] be told wrong no one wants to be rebuked
[1:18:37] anymore no one wants to be corrected so
[1:18:40] they look for things or somebody that
[1:18:42] will allow them to Foster the false
[1:18:45] doctrines and the lies and the thing
[1:18:48] that they they're already holding you
[1:18:50] understand what I'm saying see because
[1:18:52] it's a self pleasure It's s uh uh lovers
[1:18:55] of self lovers of pleasure lovers and
[1:18:58] more than lovers of God but see the
[1:19:01] Christian life is not self a
[1:19:04] self-serving life now it is important
[1:19:08] for a man to find the right kind of
[1:19:10] church to attend so that's not being
[1:19:14] selfish that's actually watching out for
[1:19:16] a soul and for The Souls of his family
[1:19:20] that are depending upon Him brother br
[1:19:23] he would say this I wish this above all
[1:19:25] things that you hear tonight that who
[1:19:28] believes in your heart that you love the
[1:19:30] Lord and something has happened to you
[1:19:32] promise me that you'll find a good
[1:19:34] gospel church somewhere a church that
[1:19:36] teaches the Full Gospel the power of God
[1:19:39] his resurrection join up with those
[1:19:42] people and make yourself a church home
[1:19:45] don't just Dray around loose on the
[1:19:47] streets go get a good church somewhere
[1:19:50] of your choice where the gospel and the
[1:19:52] power of God is made known and the signs
[1:19:55] of eternal life is in there the signs
[1:19:58] that was in Christ another place you go
[1:20:01] find a a good church somewhere that
[1:20:03] preaches the Full Gospel that believes
[1:20:06] in Divine Healing believes in the
[1:20:07] baptism of the Holy Spirit and there you
[1:20:10] find a good church of your choice and
[1:20:12] then settle down there and be a real
[1:20:16] servant to Christ ain't that right so
[1:20:18] don't come to a church don't settle that
[1:20:21] at that church and then expect all
[1:20:22] always be waited upon and attended to
[1:20:25] and pacified and all that find you a
[1:20:27] good gospel church now and and if you're
[1:20:30] going to find that it's going to rub
[1:20:31] your wrong sometimes amen because the
[1:20:33] Full Gospel always cuts and and it
[1:20:36] shapes us because the what God is doing
[1:20:38] with that Full Gospel is he's shaping
[1:20:41] stones to fit in his body can you say
[1:20:44] amen amen but if you find that type of a
[1:20:48] church support it and then settle down
[1:20:51] there and be a real servant now you're
[1:20:53] going to have a Ministry can you say
[1:20:55] Amen be a servant real servant to Christ
[1:20:59] now he says once you know brother Brown
[1:21:02] says see once you find that church he
[1:21:04] said I want you to be with your church
[1:21:07] support your church and help it help it
[1:21:09] ain't that right help it for the glory
[1:21:11] of God in another place if God is God
[1:21:14] he's worth everything you are if
[1:21:16] Christian religion is right it's worth
[1:21:18] everything you can do uh uh for it
[1:21:21] support your church support your pastor
[1:21:23] support your ministry or M missionaries

[1:21:28] and give God the best you've God can you
[1:21:31] say Amen so God didn't call us to be
[1:21:33] entertained God didn't save us amen for
[1:21:36] us to expect Amen to be pacified God
[1:21:39] called us that we could be part of a
[1:21:42] Ministry and be the best at it that we
[1:21:45] can amen throw yourself not everybody

[1:22:08] that every person should stand at their
[1:22:10] post of Duty when their Pastor there is
[1:22:12] preaching or evangelist or something I
[1:22:14] think they ought to stand at their
[1:22:16] posted Duty do you believe that you know
[1:22:18] one man told me said well I ain't got
[1:22:20] anything to do so that's not I ain't got
[1:22:21] a posted Duty yes you do you got to post
[1:22:24] a duty every time them Church doors are
[1:22:26] open you got to post a duty to be there

[1:22:30] need to be at your church if you're if

[1:22:35] and and you're just going out of town
[1:22:36] for whatever you know be at your church
[1:22:38] can you say amen amen be at your post of
[1:22:41] Duty see they ought to support that

[1:24:27] they don't consider the the the time
[1:24:29] that is consumed they don't consider the
[1:24:31] fact that they're weary they know that
[1:24:33] God is doing something they're wanting
[1:24:34] to see God's people blessed they want to
[1:24:36] see Soul safe and what every little part
[1:24:39] they've got they want to do it with
[1:24:40] everything they've got within them amen
[1:24:43] see and and so I I certainly appreciate
[1:24:46] that uh uh from the bottom of my heart
[1:24:49] amen see brother brandom says this I
[1:24:51] want to live for others how many wants
[1:24:53] to live for others I want to live for
[1:24:56] others amen and and he says and give
[1:24:59] what strength I have you know I I
[1:25:03] thought of that you know I'm 50 and and
[1:25:05] and to be honest I I'm I I I don't know
[1:25:08] how many years I've got left but I know
[1:25:10] my as time is ticking I ain't got much
[1:25:12] energy left you know I mean 20 years 30
[1:25:15] years but what is that you know what is
[1:25:17] time you understand what I'm saying we
[1:25:19] don't know brother Tim how much time we
[1:25:21] have but I I think God you know I I
[1:25:24] would hate to have a stroke and and not
[1:25:27] be able to do nothing and I'm still
[1:25:29] living you know I I would hate to to to
[1:25:32] be lamed uh in some way I'd hate that
[1:25:35] that somehow my vocal cords went out you
[1:25:38] you understand and I wouldn't be able to
[1:25:40] preach anymore and and and and and these
[1:25:42] things really uh come into my mind and
[1:25:45] and when it does come in my mind I think
[1:25:47] God let me do
[1:25:49] everything I can while I still have a
[1:25:53] voice let me do everything I can while I
[1:25:57] can still praise God Amen everything I
[1:26:00] can because there's going to come a day
[1:26:03] amen even even if God takes us home what
[1:26:06] record we have left what life that we
[1:26:10] lived will be our record do you
[1:26:12] understand what I'm saying I think it's
[1:26:13] brother Donnie you know that that said
[1:26:15] you know if if people would just live
[1:26:18] right and live a Christian it makes it
[1:26:19] easy for their funeral you know then I
[1:26:21] don't have to lie about things I don't
[1:26:23] have to say things that that ain't right
[1:26:25] you preached your own funeral your life
[1:26:28] has preached your own funeral you
[1:26:30] understand what I'm saying how many
[1:26:31] times we go to a funeral and you know
[1:26:33] that man was a saint I thought brother
[1:26:35] Walker for example you know and and it
[1:26:38] was the easiest thing to get up and
[1:26:40] preach amen because I I didn't have to
[1:26:42] wander about him I didn't have to I saw
[1:26:45] that man you know I've only known him 12
[1:26:46] years but I saw that man go through scar
[1:26:48] he got scars and of losing his son and
[1:26:52] then and and the things that that man
[1:26:54] went through but the change and and he's
[1:26:57] still holding on to God every time you
[1:26:59] went up there he just talking about God
[1:27:02] wh people called him a fanatic people
[1:27:04] thought he was crazy people just looked
[1:27:06] at him as an old man I looked at him as
[1:27:08] a genuine Christian amen see but his
[1:27:13] life his life already preached his
[1:27:15] funeral see you are declaring your
[1:27:18] funeral right now you're preaching your
[1:27:20] own funeral by the life you live by the
[1:27:24] words you say by the energy you put in
[1:27:27] there's other times you wonder I wonder
[1:27:29] if they ever did make it and all that
[1:27:31] and you hear people say oh they've done
[1:27:32] this and they done that bless God they
[1:27:34] were really holy but then in our minds
[1:27:35] we all know that that wasn't the real
[1:27:37] case you you know good and well they
[1:27:39] didn't live that type of Life what
[1:27:41] they're saying behind the pull pit you
[1:27:43] know they didn't say that they didn't
[1:27:45] live that and you understand what I'm
[1:27:47] saying is you don't have to lie to a
[1:27:49] real about a real genuine Christian amen
[1:27:53] and I thought God let my life bear
[1:27:55] record of what I am let everything
[1:27:58] that's within me bear record amen of who
[1:28:02] I am that if there's no preacher to
[1:28:05] preach my funeral the people will know
[1:28:07] what I
[1:28:11] was brother Ram said I want to live for
[1:28:14] others and give what strength I have not
[1:28:17] to myself and to my own pleasure but for
[1:28:20] the benefit of others that'll build the
[1:28:22] kingdom of God so you see we got to have
[1:28:26] a
[1:28:27] feeling for one another got to have a
[1:28:30] feeling for the Lost God have a feeling
[1:28:34] for those that are Wayward yes yes
[1:28:37] Ezekiel 9 and4 and the Lord said unto
[1:28:40] him go through the midst of the city
[1:28:42] through the midst of Jerusalem and set a
[1:28:45] mark upon the forehead of the men that
[1:28:47] sigh and that cry for all the
[1:28:50] Abominations that be done in the mid
[1:28:52] thereof brother R said see he said we
[1:28:55] make so much emotion over our religious
[1:28:58] ideas all fuss and the fighting and the
[1:29:02] oh if someone doesn't agree boy we'll
[1:29:04] make a fuss there's you know there's
[1:29:06] churches that are split just over the
[1:29:08] carpet color of the carpet the painted
[1:29:11] walls and it wasn't their color it
[1:29:13] wasn't their kind of Pew it wasn't what
[1:29:16] they wanted it wasn't the song they sung
[1:29:18] it wasn't the musician that they wanted
[1:29:20] it ain't this it ain't the sermon that
[1:29:22] they wanted to hear and they actually
[1:29:24] walk out the church they'll split at
[1:29:26] church they'll do whatever they can see
[1:29:28] amen it's it's because we make so much
[1:29:31] emotion over our religious ideas but who
[1:29:35] is it in the city tonight in
[1:29:38] Jeffersonville that's so concerned about
[1:29:40] the Lost World in this last day that can
[1:29:44] even spend even spend 30 minutes a night
[1:29:49] praying for the sins of the city
[1:29:52] you understand what I'm saying amen see
[1:29:55] so so now if you notice our opening
[1:29:57] scripture the son of man did not come to
[1:30:00] be minister to but he came to minister
[1:30:05] he came not to be served but he came to
[1:30:08] serve now he's the same yesterday today
[1:30:11] and forever do you believe that so we
[1:30:13] believe that he's the same healer we
[1:30:15] know that he's the same savior we know
[1:30:17] that he's the same brother Brown said
[1:30:18] he's the same in in thought he's the
[1:30:21] same in power he's the same in motive
[1:30:23] he's the same in every which way but the
[1:30:25] Corporal body but who is his body today
[1:30:29] you and I ain't that right we claim to
[1:30:31] be that bride well if we're that bride
[1:30:34] we are his body we are the physical
[1:30:37] appearance of Jesus Christ on Earth
[1:30:39] that's right amen yes sir you ain't
[1:30:42] going to see him on on the earth in a
[1:30:45] physical body God never promised that
[1:30:47] you are his body we'll we'll be caught
[1:30:51] up in the in and caught up to meet our
[1:30:53] Lord in the air but until then we are
[1:30:56] that body ain't that right and when he
[1:30:59] comes into our body he has the same
[1:31:01] motive the same intentions the same
[1:31:03] attitude the same the same character
[1:31:05] he's got the same everything amen and
[1:31:08] and that's what it is to die out you got
[1:31:11] to die out to yourself in order for him
[1:31:13] to come in and then he he directs you he
[1:31:18] controls you why because he didn't come
[1:31:21] just to to as people think he's an
[1:31:24] emotion and they get some type of
[1:31:26] feeling on their on their flesh and they
[1:31:28] feel good and they say oh I got him no
[1:31:30] no no he didn't come upon your spirit to
[1:31:32] where you just feel good and you think a
[1:31:34] good thought and you and you know and
[1:31:36] all these things he come to live into
[1:31:38] that Soul which is the control tower
[1:31:41] ain't that right so now John 14:18 I
[1:31:45] will not leave you comfortless I will
[1:31:47] come to you yet a little while in the
[1:31:50] world seeth me no more but you see me
[1:31:52] because I live you shall live also at
[1:31:54] that day you shall know you shall know
[1:31:57] ain't that right not in imagination you
[1:32:00] shall know it ain't going to just be a
[1:32:01] teaching you shall know that I am in my
[1:32:05] father you in me and I in
[1:32:10] you he's the same praise God praise God
[1:32:14] hallu looking at his
[1:32:18] ministry his service was totally
[1:32:20] different from that of the church in his
[1:32:23] day his ministry was different from any
[1:32:26] other
[1:32:27] Ministry that man
[1:32:30] had the type of ministry that man has
[1:32:35] operates in the natural
[1:32:39] real such as
[1:32:41] hospitals insane asylums yes using
[1:32:45] medication
[1:32:47] psychology we see that man has come up
[1:32:50] with charity organization ations to help
[1:32:52] feed the poor and provide shelter for
[1:32:54] the
[1:32:55] homeless even the church has got into
[1:32:58] such
[1:33:00] things as programs and societies and
[1:33:05] charity functions to keep the people
[1:33:08] entertained to keep the young people out
[1:33:11] of
[1:33:11] trouble you know they have movie
[1:33:15] Nights just so to draw the young people
[1:33:19] you know they have all kinds of things
[1:33:22] there are Ministries in the church out
[1:33:25] of the church to help reform drug
[1:33:27] addicts and
[1:33:29] alcoholics there are ministers
[1:33:31] Ministries to help troubled teenagers
[1:33:35] and to help with marital issues man has
[1:33:39] established all kinds of programs and
[1:33:43] organizations and things to to help
[1:33:45] people with all kinds of
[1:33:48] addictions whatever if you're having uh
[1:33:51] thoughts of suicide just call the
[1:33:52] suicide hotline if you have emotional
[1:33:56] troubles there's you know uh I just
[1:34:00] heard uh you know last night that they
[1:34:03] got actually they got they got places of
[1:34:05] rooms to where if you're having problems
[1:34:08] with anger management that you can go in
[1:34:11] these rooms and and and it's it's so
[1:34:14] built to where you you can just go in
[1:34:16] there and throw things and just just let
[1:34:19] off your steam I mean break it whatever
[1:34:21] you whatever you want to do it's it's

[1:34:28] throw throw your child or something see
[1:34:32] and and and uh they they've got all
[1:34:35] kinds they you know uh my wife is tell
[1:34:37] me she read where you know these these
[1:34:40] uh uh high up um they you know they
[1:34:43] they've uh businesses and things they
[1:34:46] they've got they got rooms cubicles
[1:34:48] where it's just soundproof that you can
[1:34:49] go in there and just scream you know uh
[1:34:52] to to let off the
[1:34:54] frustrations oh my what compassion
[1:34:57] people have today you know just to suit
[1:35:00] you so you don't yell at anybody just go
[1:35:03] in that little room scream all you want
[1:35:06] to it's it's relief you know well that's
[1:35:09] that's human that's human it's it's it's
[1:35:12] people are trying to fix people you
[1:35:15] understand what I'm saying and it's
[1:35:16] coming up with all kinds of things you
[1:35:18] know and and and they're all fine but
[1:35:21] they only deal with the outward
[1:35:24] manifestation and not the source of the
[1:35:27] problem you see it's a spiritual problem
[1:35:30] that people are dealing with yes there
[1:35:32] is a physical illness yes there is
[1:35:34] mental illness and and then there's that
[1:35:37] sickness of the soul but it's all
[1:35:40] demonology do you believe that amen you
[1:35:43] can call it cancer but the prophet would
[1:35:46] say it's a demon you can call it
[1:35:47] deafness but the prophet said it's a
[1:35:49] demon that's that's God on that nerve
[1:35:52] and it's cramping that nerve down you
[1:35:55] know it you we can call it parkon but
[1:35:58] it's it's a demon it's it it's a
[1:36:01] spiritual real and the doctors can't fix
[1:36:04] demons the the psychologist can't fix
[1:36:07] demons and and these things and so no
[1:36:10] matter how many hospitals we're building
[1:36:12] the sick are it's getting worse sickness
[1:36:14] more sickness after after another the
[1:36:17] more scientists they have and education
[1:36:20] and and and discuss iies and invention
[1:36:22] it it's still not fixing problems you
[1:36:25] understand what I'm saying the more
[1:36:26] psychology that we have and and the more
[1:36:29] insane Syms that we have they're filling
[1:36:31] up already and we still got them Lo
[1:36:33] running loose around here you understand
[1:36:34] what I'm saying see it's not fixing the
[1:36:37] problem doctors deal with the physical
[1:36:39] and mental state through medication
[1:36:42] surgeries and and and and and training
[1:36:45] and and all these things and yes it is a
[1:36:48] Ministry that that God does uh work
[1:36:51] Works through amen uh uh to heal amen
[1:36:54] medication doesn't heal God does the
[1:36:56] healing and and and all these things but
[1:36:58] but when it's all said and done the
[1:37:00] doctor is limited in what he can do and
[1:37:02] we all know that amen and and and so so
[1:37:07] most of the time you know a doctor can
[1:37:09] only help his patients just cope with
[1:37:11] the problem you know and and these
[1:37:14] things but see God has given his church
[1:37:18] you and I a far greater
[1:37:22] Ministry you don't have to be trained to
[1:37:24] be a doctor you don't have to be trained
[1:37:25] to be a psychologist you don't have to
[1:37:27] read all their books and and all of
[1:37:29] these things you don't have to know
[1:37:30] about natural medicines and and and all
[1:37:32] of these if you can get the power of God
[1:37:35] and get back to prayer and believing in
[1:37:37] the reality of God God never told us to
[1:37:40] build hospitals he never told us Amen to
[1:37:42] build such programs and and and all of
[1:37:45] these thing he told us that we can cast
[1:37:47] out Devils we can lay hands on the sick
[1:37:50] we can do something that is greater and
[1:37:52] have a Ministry far more effective than
[1:37:55] we could a natural
[1:37:59] Ministry when Jesus walked the Earth in
[1:38:02] his physical body there were millions of
[1:38:04] people in need and he came to supply the
[1:38:09] Need No Doubt there were many who were
[1:38:13] poor maybe no doubt there were those
[1:38:16] that were even
[1:38:19] homeless but he didn't come to create
[1:38:21] jobs for those who needed a job even
[1:38:25] though he could have done
[1:38:27] it he didn't come to give money to those
[1:38:30] who were poor even though he could have
[1:38:32] done it he didn't come to build charity
[1:38:36] organizations for those in need even
[1:38:39] though he could have done
[1:38:41] it but see he come to meet a greater
[1:38:45] need ain't that
[1:38:47] right a need that the government
[1:38:49] couldn't fix
[1:38:52] a need that even the natural Church
[1:38:54] couldn't meet doctors couldn't meet the
[1:38:56] need Psychology couldn't meet the
[1:38:59] need his ministry was
[1:39:02] different and far
[1:39:04] greater ain't that right according to
[1:39:08] Luke 19:10 he came to seek and save that
[1:39:12] which was
[1:39:15] lost not by passing
[1:39:19] Donuts not by passing coffee in the
[1:39:26] church
[1:39:28] hello Galatians 4:5 tells us that he was
[1:39:31] sent to redeem them that were under the
[1:39:33] law that we might receive the adoption
[1:39:35] of sons what a
[1:39:37] Ministry according to 1 John 3 and5 he
[1:39:40] was manifested to take away our sins
[1:39:44] Luke 4:18 Jesus said the spirit of the
[1:39:46] Lord is upon me because he hath anointed
[1:39:49] me to preach the gospel to the the poor
[1:39:52] he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[1:39:53] to preach Deliverance to the captives
[1:39:55] and recovering of sight to the blind to
[1:39:57] set at Liberty them that are bruised to
[1:40:00] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[1:40:03] the Amplified Bible says the son of man
[1:40:05] came not to be waited
[1:40:07] upon but to serve to give his life as a
[1:40:11] ransom for many the price paid to set
[1:40:15] them free can you say
[1:40:18] Amen yet he didn't go into natural
[1:40:21] prisons he didn't go and have a meeting
[1:40:22] with the governor and the king and
[1:40:25] whoever and say set these people
[1:40:29] free come on he didn't loose the natural
[1:40:33] natural prisons there was a far greater
[1:40:36] prison that was holding the people can
[1:40:39] you say amen he didn't set the people
[1:40:42] free from Roman
[1:40:44] oppression that Roman government that
[1:40:46] they that was oppressing the Jews it
[1:40:49] didn't come to set them free from that
[1:40:51] that can you say Amen there was a
[1:40:53] greater oppression the people thought
[1:40:55] that what he would do they thought he
[1:40:57] would come as king and deliver them but
[1:40:59] notice Romans 15:8 Paul says now I say
[1:41:02] that Jesus Christ was a minister of the
[1:41:06] circumcision for the truth of God to
[1:41:09] confirm the promises made unto the
[1:41:11] fathers and that the Gentiles might
[1:41:14] glorify God for his Mercy as it is
[1:41:18] written for this cause I will confess to
[1:41:21] the uh uh among the Gentiles or I will
[1:41:24] confess uh uh to thee among the Gentiles
[1:41:27] and sing unto thy name the Amplified
[1:41:30] says for I tell you that Christ the
[1:41:32] Messiah became a servant and a minister
[1:41:34] to the circumcised the Jews in order to
[1:41:37] show God's truthfulness and honesty by
[1:41:41] confirming verifying the promises that
[1:41:44] was given to their fathers can you say
[1:41:47] amen and also in order that the G
[1:41:50] Gentiles see might glorify God for his
[1:41:54] Mercy not Covenant it to them as it is
[1:41:58] written therefore will I praise your uh
[1:42:01] uh Praise You among the Gentiles and
[1:42:03] sing praises to your name oh do you love
[1:42:06] the Lord amen see so he came not to be
[1:42:10] ministered to but he came to
[1:42:14] minister but if you notice he was sent
[1:42:18] he didn't go on his own he was sent
[1:42:21] amen that's I think that's a a a thing
[1:42:24] that you know very powerful thought is
[1:42:27] he was sent yeah he didn't go without
[1:42:30] being sent sent means he was
[1:42:33] commissioned he was directed He was
[1:42:36] ordered he was under a
[1:42:40] command right
[1:42:42] right
[1:42:43] well the body of
[1:42:46] Christ you and I there's not a person
[1:42:50] here
[1:42:51] that can be part of the body of Christ
[1:42:55] without having a
[1:42:57] commission the body of Christ has been
[1:43:00] commissioned Mark 16:15 he said unto
[1:43:03] them go ye into all the world and preach
[1:43:05] the gospel to Every Creature brother
[1:43:07] Bram said if you're not a
[1:43:09] minister then don't try to preach it not
[1:43:12] don't stand behind the pulpit he said
[1:43:14] you got a life your life is a preaching
[1:43:18] ain't that right right a minister he has
[1:43:20] to stand behind the pulpit and preach
[1:43:22] and live a life too you're called to
[1:43:25] live a life amen see preach the gospel
[1:43:28] to Every Creature he that believeth and
[1:43:31] is baptized shall be saved but he that
[1:43:32] believeth not shall be damned these
[1:43:35] signs shall follow them that believe
[1:43:37] every one of us this scripture applies
[1:43:40] to every one of us that's exactly right
[1:43:42] that's why we should never have this
[1:43:44] mentality of being helpless and hopeless
[1:43:46] and don't know what to do and all of
[1:43:48] these things you have been commissioned
[1:43:51] get out of the selfishness amen
[1:43:56] amen hallu we expect God to do things
[1:43:59] without us inserting anything people
[1:44:02] don't pray no more true but they want
[1:44:06] everything God to do they want all the
[1:44:08] promises but but they they don't want to
[1:44:10] come into that mentality of ministry
[1:44:12] amen
[1:44:15] amen he that believeth and is baptized
[1:44:18] these signs shall follow them that
[1:44:19] believe in my name they shall cast out
[1:44:21] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[1:44:22] they shall take up serpents and if they
[1:44:24] drink deadly any deadly thing it shall
[1:44:26] not hurt them they shall lay hands on
[1:44:29] the sick and they shall recover see our
[1:44:31] ministry is far
[1:44:32] different than passing out the Tylenol
[1:44:35] bottles far different than educating
[1:44:38] people on essential oils far different
[1:44:43] than educating people in in the medical
[1:44:47] field they got their job yeah but what
[1:44:51] about our
[1:44:53] job who are
[1:44:56] we hello what are we to
[1:45:01] do our greater ministry that's right so
[1:45:05] we have been sent to the world with a
[1:45:08] commission Jesus would never send his
[1:45:10] people without a commission I just don't
[1:45:12] believe that and notice he sends us the
[1:45:15] same way he he the father sent him Jesus
[1:45:19] sends us the same way the father sent
[1:45:21] him notice John 2021 Jesus said as my
[1:45:25] father has sent me so even so I send you
[1:45:28] and when he had said this he breathed
[1:45:30] upon them and said unto them receive ye
[1:45:34] the Holy Ghost notice he get ready send
[1:45:36] them
[1:45:38] out but before he sends them he going to
[1:45:41] give them the Holy
[1:45:42] Ghost notice whosoever sends you or
[1:45:46] remit you remit they are remitted unto
[1:45:49] them and whosoever sends you retain they
[1:45:52] are retained can you say amen amen now
[1:45:55] how did the father send him by being
[1:45:58] with him by being in him he went with
[1:46:01] him and was in him can you say Amen see
[1:46:05] John 1412 verily verily I say unto you
[1:46:08] he that believeth on me the works that I
[1:46:09] do shall he do also and Greater Works
[1:46:11] than these shall he do because I go unto
[1:46:15] my father and whatsoever things you
[1:46:17] shall ask in my name that will I do that
[1:46:19] the father May glorify the son be
[1:46:21] glorified in the son if you shall ask
[1:46:23] anything in my name I will do it amen 2
[1:46:25] Corinthians 5:18 and all things are of
[1:46:27] God who have reconciled us to himself by
[1:46:31] Jesus Christ not by some
[1:46:34] program not by a psychologist amen not
[1:46:38] by the world's
[1:46:40] programs he reconciled us to God by
[1:46:44] Jesus Christ what a
[1:46:46] Ministry and hath given to us the same
[1:46:49] Ministry of reconciliation can you say
[1:46:52] Amen to it that God was in Christ
[1:46:54] reconciling the world how did he bring a
[1:46:57] Reconciliation God was in
[1:47:00] Christ amen not imputing their
[1:47:02] trespasses unto them and hath committed
[1:47:05] unto us the word of
[1:47:08] reconciliation now then we are
[1:47:11] ambassadors not for the government not
[1:47:13] for some
[1:47:14] organization but for Christ that's right
[1:47:18] Christ is the one that has ordered us
[1:47:20] Christ is the one that has commissioned
[1:47:21] us can you say amen amen yes sir now
[1:47:26] that see now we are ambassadors for
[1:47:28] Christ as though God did beseech You by
[1:47:31] us see when you speak it's God speaking
[1:47:34] can you say Amen see we pray you in
[1:47:37] Christ dead we're standing in Christ
[1:47:39] dead on the earth as his body be ye
[1:47:43] reconciled to
[1:47:47] God right Matthew 18:18 ver I say unto
[1:47:51] you whatsoever you shall bind on Earth
[1:47:53] shall be bound in heaven whatsoever you
[1:47:55] shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in
[1:47:56] heaven again I say unto you that if two
[1:47:59] or three two of you shall agree on Earth
[1:48:01] as touching anything that they shall ask
[1:48:04] see it shall be done for them of My
[1:48:07] Father which is in heaven for where two
[1:48:09] or three are gathered together in my
[1:48:11] name there I am in the midst of them can
[1:48:14] you say Amen see so we as the bride of
[1:48:17] Christ has has something that the the
[1:48:20] Church natural the world does not have
[1:48:23] our ministry is so profound it's so much
[1:48:26] it it it just cannot be anyone people
[1:48:29] are trying to impersonate it but they're
[1:48:31] that's what they are they're
[1:48:33] impersonators God doesn't recognize that
[1:48:36] impersonation amen and and look where
[1:48:38] they're they're going with it they
[1:48:39] mislead people they lead people astray
[1:48:41] away from the word of God any
[1:48:43] impersonator that tries to impersonate
[1:48:46] will always lead people away from the
[1:48:48] word of God can you say Amen but when
[1:48:51] God send his bride there's something
[1:48:54] there that is genuine it's a genuine
[1:48:57] Ministry yes sir brother Brown talked of
[1:49:01] the precious Souls out on the street
[1:49:03] he's in his prayer and praying he's
[1:49:05] talking of the precious Souls out on the
[1:49:07] street who are looking and wandering and
[1:49:09] waiting to see the Life of Christ being
[1:49:11] manifested among God's people and he
[1:49:14] says see we may not he said we may not
[1:49:16] be able to influence the whole city
[1:49:19] hardly ever
[1:49:20] was that ever done because in there uh
[1:49:24] is the wheat and the tears they're
[1:49:26] gathered together see they are together
[1:49:28] see the wheat and the tears amen he said
[1:49:31] but then he said this he said Lord may
[1:49:34] we be so enthused may we be so enthused
[1:49:37] that we'll try to light one little
[1:49:39] candle each day by telling someone else
[1:49:43] doing something that'll influence others
[1:49:46] to know you to love you not to trust in
[1:49:50] doctors and and don't get me wrong I'm
[1:49:51] not against doctors we go to the
[1:49:53] hospital we we we take medicine all
[1:49:55] these things but we're not looking to
[1:49:57] them for our
[1:49:58] ansers if they're not The Miracle Worker
[1:50:01] you understand what I'm saying our job
[1:50:03] is to influence people to God to know
[1:50:06] that God Is A Healer to know that he's
[1:50:08] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:50:10] amen that they can understand and
[1:50:12] experience the same God that we've
[1:50:15] experienced ain't that right by telling
[1:50:17] someone doing something that'll
[1:50:20] influence others to know you and to love
[1:50:22] you for to know you is
[1:50:25] life oh do you love
[1:50:28] him our opening scripture shows us that
[1:50:32] in order to minister one must be a
[1:50:37] servant for Jesus being the son of man
[1:50:40] came not to minister to but to minister
[1:50:43] and notice in Philippians I believe 2
[1:50:45] and 7 it says but he made himself of no
[1:50:50] no
[1:50:52] reputation and took upon him the form of
[1:50:54] a servant and was made in the likeness
[1:50:56] of men and being found in fashion as a
[1:51:00] man he humbled
[1:51:02] himself and became obedient unto death
[1:51:05] even the death of the Cross he took upon
[1:51:09] him the form of a
[1:51:11] servant and humbled himself yes and
[1:51:14] became obedient amen did he lose his
[1:51:16] power by doing so no did he lose his
[1:51:19] excellent see by doing so no did he lose
[1:51:22] his kingdom by doing so oh no he was God
[1:51:27] right God God he remained to be God and
[1:51:32] and and so a as Jesus said you know in
[1:51:35] Matthew 28:18 all power is given unto me
[1:51:39] in heaven and in Earth why because God
[1:51:42] the all powerful one was in him amen the
[1:51:45] fullness of the godhead dwelt bodily in
[1:51:48] him ain't that right see and and so God
[1:51:50] veiled in a man and the word is God and
[1:51:53] the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:51:56] ain't that right so the prophet said God
[1:51:59] hid himself in human flesh he was the
[1:52:02] creator he was the I am that I am he was
[1:52:05] the the one that met that met Moses in
[1:52:08] the burning bush he was the fourth man
[1:52:11] in the fiery furnace he was the one that
[1:52:13] moved upon the waters of the Red Sea and
[1:52:16] part of them for his people he was that
[1:52:19] one wasn't a different God it was the
[1:52:21] same God that took on a form of a Man
[1:52:26] became a servant to man can you sayen he
[1:52:30] was the one that discerned and revealed
[1:52:33] the the secrets of the heart Amen to
[1:52:36] Abraham and to Sarah he was
[1:52:40] MDC can you say
[1:52:42] Amen but
[1:52:44] notice he healed the
[1:52:46] sick but he made no reputation for
[1:52:49] himself
[1:52:50] you know what the prophet says about
[1:52:52] it the
[1:52:55] doctor he comes with a fake
[1:52:58] arm and he has builds a
[1:53:01] reputation he becomes Wealthy by what
[1:53:04] he's
[1:53:06] invented they'll do this and they come
[1:53:08] up with something but when Christ came
[1:53:11] the god of Heaven he raised the dead and
[1:53:15] didn't build a reputation from it he
[1:53:18] didn't seek reputation he didn't do it
[1:53:20] for reputation he ministered to the
[1:53:22] thousands and he multiplied The Fish and
[1:53:24] Loaves but he didn't do it for
[1:53:30] reputation walked on the water but he
[1:53:33] didn't do it to seeking to build a
[1:53:35] reputation can you amen you think
[1:53:38] Matthew 15:30 great multitudes came unto
[1:53:41] him having with them those that were
[1:53:43] lame blind dumb maimed and many others
[1:53:47] and cast them down at Jesus's feet and
[1:53:49] he healed them in so much that the
[1:53:51] multitude wondered when they saw the
[1:53:54] dumb to speak the m to be whole the lame
[1:53:57] to walk and the blind to see and they
[1:54:00] glorified the god of
[1:54:02] Israel can you say Amen the ministry was
[1:54:06] so
[1:54:07] humble that they didn't exalt a
[1:54:10] man they glorified
[1:54:15] God hallu what a Ministry Jesus said to
[1:54:19] the man with the paly arise and take up
[1:54:21] thy bed and go thy way into thine house
[1:54:25] and Mark 2:13 says and immediately he
[1:54:27] arose and took up the bed and went forth
[1:54:30] before them all in so much that they
[1:54:32] were all amazed and glorified God saying
[1:54:34] we've never saw it on this
[1:54:38] fashion as soon as Jesus raised the
[1:54:40] young man from the dead the Bible says
[1:54:42] in Luke 7:16 and there came a fear upon
[1:54:45] all and they glorified God there come a
[1:54:48] respect there came a reverence upon the
[1:54:51] people that they glorified God it wasn't
[1:54:54] glorifying some
[1:54:56] man the old critics today saying that we
[1:54:59] glorify that man right there it ain't
[1:55:02] that man it's the god in that
[1:55:04] man but how many people how many
[1:55:07] ministers seek Glory from from people
[1:55:09] that's right they they they they've lost
[1:55:12] their burden I look at at doctors and
[1:55:13] and things and look where we're coming
[1:55:15] to
[1:55:16] today it's coming to where that that
[1:55:19] doctors and nurses and you wonder even
[1:55:22] why they're there they're
[1:55:24] rude right they're just sometimes they
[1:55:28] don't want to help
[1:55:29] you they they're just and what it is
[1:55:32] it's a it's become a job to them it's
[1:55:35] just become a way of money right people
[1:55:39] become doctors today not not for the
[1:55:41] help of the people but I don't know I'm
[1:55:43] saying not all of them is that way but
[1:55:44] the majority is becoming that way right
[1:55:47] is is because it's a money thing yeah
[1:55:50] see and they forget it's a
[1:55:53] Ministry can you say amen that's right
[1:55:56] and and it's becoming more and more but
[1:55:58] look at where it's coming in into
[1:56:00] churches even the same but see Jesus
[1:56:04] Jesus didn't live for himself he didn't
[1:56:06] seek fortune and fame he didn't seek
[1:56:08] comfort and pleasure he didn't seek
[1:56:10] popularity or big crowds and you say
[1:56:13] Amen as I
[1:56:15] close if he was living for
[1:56:18] himself he would have called 10,000
[1:56:20] angels cuz he said he had them at his
[1:56:22] disposal he could have called them and
[1:56:25] he would have called them to set him
[1:56:27] free from the cross so he wouldn't have
[1:56:29] to have gone that
[1:56:30] way we know that even when he was in The
[1:56:33] Garden of Gethsemane right before he was
[1:56:35] arrested his flesh was screaming out
[1:56:39] father if it be thy will let this cup
[1:56:41] pass from
[1:56:42] me but notice but
[1:56:46] nevertheless thy
[1:56:48] will not my will will thy will be done
[1:56:51] ain't that
[1:56:52] right if he was living for himself he
[1:56:55] would have never never taken the time to
[1:56:58] go out of his
[1:57:00] way to go by
[1:57:02] samarra to talk to that one little
[1:57:05] woman he would have stayed with the
[1:57:07] 5,000 10 thousands the thousands of
[1:57:10] crowds that were following
[1:57:12] him but a woman that didn't even know
[1:57:16] him didn't even understand who he was
[1:57:19] but he went
[1:57:21] anyways one
[1:57:23] individual cuz he wasn't living for
[1:57:26] himself he was doing the father's
[1:57:31] will sometimes we get Ministries so
[1:57:34] wrong I see it working among the young
[1:57:38] men of ministers a lot of
[1:57:42] them they want to be full-time
[1:57:46] evangelist they want to be like brother
[1:57:48] Andrew comes to a point that you know
[1:57:50] brother Andrew feels odd being around
[1:57:52] them cuz there's just a weirdness there
[1:57:55] because they wonder why he's that way
[1:57:56] and they can't be but the point is if
[1:57:59] you're a minister it doesn't matter if
[1:58:02] you're called to go to the nursing home
[1:58:04] and minister to one
[1:58:07] individual it's Ministry it's true
[1:58:10] Ministry is not all about standing
[1:58:11] behind the pull pit it's true very true
[1:58:15] getting out on the streets passing out
[1:58:17] flly letting people know what God is
[1:58:20] doing witnessing
[1:58:23] amen it's it's it's all Ministry can you
[1:58:25] say
[1:58:26] Amen see so so if Jesus was living for
[1:58:30] himself you would have never you
[1:58:32] know you you would have never saw him
[1:58:35] going up that hill reading about him
[1:58:39] going up the hill and crying out and
[1:58:41] saying oh Jerusalem oh Jerusalem how
[1:58:45] often i' gathered you as a hen with or
[1:58:47] brood right
[1:58:52] yes he said but you would not brother
[1:58:55] Braham said he was a rejected he was
[1:58:57] rejected the people rejected him well
[1:59:00] how did he get there because he didn't
[1:59:01] live for
[1:59:02] himself he stayed with the father's will
[1:59:05] right if he was living for himself you
[1:59:08] would have never read about the 70
[1:59:09] walking away from him right why because
[1:59:14] he would have been passing out the
[1:59:15] donuts he would have been so careful on
[1:59:17] how he worded his his message so not to
[1:59:21] offend
[1:59:22] everybody cuz who wants to be rejected
[1:59:24] right who wants people to to to walk
[1:59:26] away and say man that guy's a nut
[1:59:28] whoever who wants to be a
[1:59:31] nut who wants to be considered the
[1:59:34] Oddball so if you're living for yourself
[1:59:37] you want friends you want everybody to
[1:59:38] Pat you on the back and see what
[1:59:40] accomplishments you can
[1:59:41] do
[1:59:44] right but we find the 70 walking
[1:59:48] away
[1:59:49] and actually the prophet say Jesus said
[1:59:52] it to weed down his
[1:59:57] crowd can you say amen amen he said he
[2:00:01] said it to weed down his crowd till he
[2:00:03] could get the group together and and out
[2:00:06] of all those people only 11 of them then
[2:00:10] understood actually who he was ain't
[2:00:12] that right
[2:00:14] see and I want to say this a lot of
[2:00:16] people within message the message ring
[2:00:21] would have
[2:00:22] attributed to Jesus being unwise in his
[2:00:27] sermon maybe he could have said
[2:00:29] something a little different that
[2:00:30] wouldn't have offended them come
[2:00:32] on maybe he could have said something
[2:00:34] because after all we're here to to win
[2:00:37] souls we're here to to Rally everybody
[2:00:44] around I
[2:00:46] am
[2:00:47] appalled at how many people are really
[2:00:50] ashamed to declare the message to other
[2:00:53] people they call it being wise but in
[2:00:56] all reality they're
[2:00:57] ashamed of what God has
[2:01:02] done see the message is so different
[2:01:05] from the mainstream teaching of today
[2:01:09] the message goes against traditions and
[2:01:11] people are so rooted in Traditions that
[2:01:14] the message seems so odd so the moment
[2:01:16] we start saying about Malachi 4 and
[2:01:18] telling other people about what God has
[2:01:20] done and sending a prophet well
[2:01:22] automatically they call us an occult
[2:01:25] right automatically they link us up to
[2:01:27] Mormons whoever else because of a
[2:01:30] prophet but no matter what the truth is
[2:01:34] truth amen sure see people ain't going
[2:01:37] to make it in a Rapture without this
[2:01:41] message people ain't going to get a
[2:01:42] rapturing faith without this message
[2:01:45] amen you understand what I'm saying see
[2:01:48] so so it goes against you know this
[2:01:51] message corrects false
[2:01:53] doctrines ain't that right that people
[2:01:56] have been
[2:01:57] taught that are depending upon these
[2:01:59] things for
[2:02:01] salvation right see and so therefore
[2:02:05] people are afraid that if they say
[2:02:07] anything about a prophet in this
[2:02:08] generation they're going to lose friends
[2:02:09] and be considered the
[2:02:11] wackos considered you know David cres
[2:02:14] Jim Jones and and all these things but
[2:02:17] see when Jesus come he came not to be
[2:02:20] minister
[2:02:22] to he came to minister amen but he had a
[2:02:27] certain way to do it and that was to
[2:02:31] reveal the father's will to the people
[2:02:35] can you say Amen you love
[2:02:38] him I love the
[2:02:41] Lord if the musicians will
[2:02:47] come
[2:02:49] you see Jesus
[2:02:51] knew that if he was going to save that
[2:02:54] elect if he was going to be able to
[2:02:56] reach that elect he had to do more than
[2:02:59] just work miracles first and second pull
[2:03:04] that was only to confirm his
[2:03:06] ministry but then it came to revealing
[2:03:09] who he was that was the third pool

[2:03:15] of the word when he come to open the
[2:03:17] word can you say am man
[2:03:19] see so then if he was living for himself
[2:03:23] he would have just stayed with the
[2:03:24] Social Gospel he would have stayed with
[2:03:27] the signs and the Miracles everybody was
[2:03:29] oo and and nowing over that everybody
[2:03:31] loved him by Healing The Sick raising

[2:03:36] had great flock of people when he
[2:03:40] was multiplying the fishes and the
[2:03:43] loaves great things but when he started
[2:03:46] opening the word and revealing really
[2:03:48] who who he was yes sir but he had to do
