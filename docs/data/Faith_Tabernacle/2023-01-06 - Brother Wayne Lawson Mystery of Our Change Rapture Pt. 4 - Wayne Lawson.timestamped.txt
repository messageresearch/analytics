[1:07:30] to have everybody here and amen the
[1:07:32] spirit of grace and mercy that's been
[1:07:34] Among Us I I think the Rapture is going
[1:07:37] to be like this you know when the
[1:07:38] meeting in the Air Bud Brown said we'll
[1:07:40] all get together and see one another
[1:07:42] just a little bit before we meet him he
[1:07:45] said so we'll get all that out of the
[1:07:46] way so he'll be the main attraction amen
[1:07:49] I I think that what a wonderful time
[1:07:52] that we're talking about tonight and
[1:07:53] I've been three nights on the Rapture
[1:07:56] and if it's okay with you I'm just going
[1:07:58] to go ahead and continue tonight on that
[1:08:00] and and uh and uh and like I I spoke to
[1:08:03] the last night there'll be a couple
[1:08:05] things here I'm I'm sure that's going to
[1:08:07] be very familiar to you because the
[1:08:09] revelation of the Rapture hadn't changed
[1:08:11] since the last time you heard it
[1:08:12] preached on but uh but we're going to uh
[1:08:15] we're going to try to to labor into a
[1:08:17] few of these areas and if you find a
[1:08:19] spot there that's uh that's real
[1:08:21] familiar to you and it's just good
[1:08:22] old-fashioned home cooking you can
[1:08:24] holler out amen and and pass the
[1:08:27] potatoes and and what and we'll just
[1:08:29] enjoy ourselves tonight amen God bless
[1:08:31] you and tonight we're going to go into
[1:08:33] the Bible in the book of Philippians the
[1:08:35] third chapter
[1:08:36] and the 20th verse I want to bring you
[1:08:39] greetings from the church at home true
[1:08:41] word Tabernacle and brother Erickson and
[1:08:43] amen and uh his sister Chris is not with
[1:08:46] us tonight but uh greetings from her and
[1:08:48] amen she's been uh she's been there at
[1:08:50] home you know we just had another
[1:08:52] grandbaby and and she she felt a real
[1:08:55] pool to be up there throughout the week
[1:08:57] here and uh she's she they're still
[1:09:00] adjusting amen it's Mariah's first when
[1:09:03] she's actually had the flu this week so
[1:09:05] Grandma being at home was a really good
[1:09:07] thing amen and so we just want to take a
[1:09:10] few minutes tonight in the scripture I'm
[1:09:12] going to look in Philippians chapter 3
[1:09:15] and verse 20.
[1:09:17] and verse 21 and also First Corinthians
[1:09:20] 15 51. let's read Philippians chapter 3
[1:09:23] for our conversation is in heaven
[1:09:26] for once also we look for our savior the
[1:09:30] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:32] who shall change our vile body that it
[1:09:35] be fashioned
[1:09:37] like it unto his glorious body
[1:09:40] according to the working
[1:09:42] whereby he is able to subdue all things
[1:09:46] unto himself
[1:09:49] and I like this one in First Corinthians
[1:09:51] 15 51 behold I show you a mystery
[1:09:55] and we shall not all sleep
[1:09:57] but we shall all be changed
[1:10:00] amen let's bow our hearts father we
[1:10:02] thank you tonight for your word
[1:10:04] and Lord It's a real humbling experience
[1:10:06] to stand before your children
[1:10:09] and Lord to speak to the people that I
[1:10:12] believe this scripture is talking about
[1:10:15] sacred thing Lord
[1:10:17] to know that there are human beings that
[1:10:20] have been born into this age
[1:10:23] it lowered their purpose
[1:10:25] and the desire of their life was set by
[1:10:27] you for this great change
[1:10:29] and Lord it may be just one in a million
[1:10:32] Lord
[1:10:33] I but it just makes it so much more real
[1:10:36] to me
[1:10:37] that there are people that's going to
[1:10:39] experience this and I always wonder what
[1:10:42] it was like maybe
[1:10:43] for someone to talk to Mary
[1:10:46] just before she had the child
[1:10:48] that Lord I'm talking to another church
[1:10:52] Lord just before their change
[1:10:54] and I ask you now that you would help me
[1:10:56] that you would lead me through your word
[1:10:58] and father there'd be nothing here but
[1:11:00] you and your spirit
[1:11:02] you'd lead me to every word of it father
[1:11:04] and you'd help me tonight to yield that
[1:11:07] what you've put in me Lord to you and to
[1:11:10] serve your people Lord if it'd be one
[1:11:13] thing that would be said that would be
[1:11:14] harmful or be said in the wrong way God
[1:11:17] I pray you'd stop it before it came out
[1:11:19] but Lord that which you once spoken I
[1:11:22] pray you'd make us bold as a lion with
[1:11:24] it father and that there would be no
[1:11:26] hindrance to it oh God we ask you for
[1:11:28] your mercy now we pray in Jesus name
[1:11:31] amen and amen and God bless you as you
[1:11:35] can be seated tonight
[1:11:37] I want to speak to you a little bit and
[1:11:40] I'm going to take a subtopic tonight on
[1:11:42] the mystery of our change but there's a
[1:11:45] there's a there's a lot in here of
[1:11:47] course and so we'll just we'll probably
[1:11:49] not try to preach to you all night so
[1:11:50] what I'm going to do is I'm going to
[1:11:51] preach a while then I'm just going to
[1:11:53] quit because there's gonna be no finish
[1:11:54] in this one uh I've got too much I'd
[1:11:57] have to stay the other two days and and
[1:11:59] we got to be home so uh but but I just
[1:12:02] gonna ask God for some mercy here to get
[1:12:05] the points into our hearts amen I I do
[1:12:08] want to say that I appreciate uh men of
[1:12:11] God that stand on this message and that
[1:12:14] not just uh stand on the message but
[1:12:16] stand with balance on the message
[1:12:18] because we're in a c reason when the
[1:12:21] spirit of error has took a hold of the
[1:12:24] word and it uses the word by error to
[1:12:27] lead people into error and and it and as
[1:12:30] brother Branham said many times he
[1:12:32] talked about a good paper somebody had
[1:12:33] and he said I read the paper the other
[1:12:35] day he said they put together and he
[1:12:37] said he said it was the word of God they
[1:12:39] put together he said but they just put
[1:12:40] it together intellectually he said so it
[1:12:43] didn't come out like what the word what
[1:12:45] the word would do so what we're Desiring
[1:12:47] is not just to have an intellectual
[1:12:49] putting together of the scripture that
[1:12:51] leads us in the wrong direction but we
[1:12:53] want the revelation of the word to take
[1:12:55] a hold that God by the spirit of Truth
[1:12:58] would lead us into the places that it
[1:13:00] would desires to go now we know where
[1:13:02] we're going and we know what to expect
[1:13:04] because we've had a prophet a prophetic
[1:13:06] word has told us where we're going so
[1:13:09] you know you know as the scripture tells
[1:13:11] us that if you're going to give a
[1:13:12] prophecy a prophecy must be judged
[1:13:15] before it's give to the church but a
[1:13:17] Vindicated Prophet is already spell
[1:13:19] already Vindicated to speak openly
[1:13:22] before the church and when he prophesied
[1:13:24] something you don't have to measure that
[1:13:26] or judge it you don't have to question
[1:13:27] it it's just the way it is amen it's a
[1:13:30] it's a Vindicated word of God and and we
[1:13:33] have received a Vindicated word and and
[1:13:36] and we're asking ourselves what is to
[1:13:38] come what's what's coming next what is
[1:13:41] coming to the church what are we to
[1:13:42] expect and I know uh coming from this
[1:13:44] area and I know up in different areas I
[1:13:47] know there's been a lot of ideas about
[1:13:49] what the church was going to experience
[1:13:51] before the Rapture and what what kind of
[1:13:54] uh what kind of great tragedies we were
[1:13:56] going to have to experience in things
[1:13:57] and you all forgive me but I'm just not
[1:13:59] one of those preachers that believe a
[1:14:01] lot of things are going to be coming
[1:14:02] other than the change of the body
[1:14:05] now I think I'm justified in my belief
[1:14:08] amen the prophet of God said was asked
[1:14:11] the question will the bride go through
[1:14:12] the persecution as the early Apostolic
[1:14:15] Church did and he said no I just
[1:14:17] explained this the next thing is a
[1:14:19] Rapture amen we're at a Promised Land
[1:14:21] we're at the border Amen in questions
[1:14:23] and answer he said now this is my
[1:14:25] thoughts ministering brother but in my
[1:14:27] own way I feel the holy spirit is
[1:14:29] revealed to me the next thing that is to
[1:14:31] happen to the Gentile elected bride is
[1:14:34] to be caught up with the rest of the
[1:14:36] Gentile elected bride it's been down
[1:14:38] through the age so if you're asking a
[1:14:41] prophet what is coming next he said the
[1:14:44] Rapture is coming next the change of our
[1:14:46] body so if you're uh if you're maybe
[1:14:48] looking for a lot of persecutions and
[1:14:51] you're looking for a lot of tribulation
[1:14:52] I mean I'm sure that you could find some
[1:14:55] quotes to line up with that thought and
[1:14:57] you could maybe get some scripture that
[1:14:59] you could make it say that if you wanted
[1:15:01] to but if you really want to follow what
[1:15:03] a prophet taught in 1964 in Ephesians
[1:15:05] the trumpets he changed he changed the
[1:15:08] way he viewed that and he moved from
[1:15:10] there coming to persecution upon the
[1:15:12] church because he was seeing it in the
[1:15:14] trumpets and he kept saying that the
[1:15:16] trumpets held it but then in 1964 he
[1:15:19] preached his Feast of the trumpets and
[1:15:21] he was going to hold a whole series of
[1:15:22] meetings on Feast of the trumpets and
[1:15:24] then he comes to the church and said he
[1:15:26] wouldn't let me preach on it and I asked
[1:15:28] him why can't I preach on the Feast of
[1:15:29] trumpets he said because you've already
[1:15:31] preached it spiritually in the seals
[1:15:34] because the seals is the trumpets to the
[1:15:37] Gentile and the natural trumpet sound to
[1:15:41] the Jews so whatever the trumpets are
[1:15:42] going to do for the Jew the Seal's done
[1:15:45] it for the bride of Christ so whatever
[1:15:46] you were thinking we needed to get into
[1:15:49] the Rapture the seals was going to
[1:15:51] produce it because it would be
[1:15:52] Revelation that would bring the true
[1:15:54] desperation of the church I'm on that
[1:15:57] I'm a Bible reader and when Daniel saw
[1:15:59] the end coming near that's when he got
[1:16:01] in contact with the angel because he
[1:16:03] understood by the books it was the time
[1:16:05] of the their Deliverance amen and I find
[1:16:07] out amen that God would send a message
[1:16:10] to to bring us to that point now I
[1:16:13] believe that God does things and he has
[1:16:15] an order that he does them when you're
[1:16:17] reading the Bible and you see just
[1:16:19] before Abraham's change amen God
[1:16:21] appeared to Abraham in the flesh and
[1:16:24] discerned it that was the sign that
[1:16:26] things were about to change and brother
[1:16:28] bam said not one thing what not one
[1:16:30] thing did he promised Abraham one thing
[1:16:32] did he do to Abraham but what he's done
[1:16:34] or give to the church except the change
[1:16:36] of the body so what God is owing the
[1:16:39] church is the change of the body amen
[1:16:42] we've already got the message folks
[1:16:43] we've already got the word of the lord
[1:16:45] we have got the inspiration that gathers
[1:16:48] the bribe what we are looking for
[1:16:49] tonight is the change of the body that's
[1:16:52] exactly where we are that is the season
[1:16:54] that we're living in that is the
[1:16:56] expectation of the church it's the
[1:16:59] changing of our body we're looking at
[1:17:01] any moment in any situation something is
[1:17:04] going to happen that's going to be a
[1:17:05] change I'm not looking for them to lock
[1:17:07] me up somewhere and to beat me up and
[1:17:10] make me get into a place that I could
[1:17:11] get desperate that's not really what I'm
[1:17:13] looking for I am
[1:17:16] I am body
[1:17:17] in the twinkling of an eye the next
[1:17:20] thing that is to come is the rapture of
[1:17:22] the church the change of the body of the
[1:17:24] sleeping Saints brother random says it
[1:17:26] there's nothing I don't see anything to
[1:17:29] hinder at this time the coming of the
[1:17:30] Lord Jesus out of the side of the
[1:17:32] Readiness of the church
[1:17:35] let me say this and anyone can prove it
[1:17:38] wrong he said wouldn't all these Visions
[1:17:40] no one can prove it wrong these all
[1:17:42] these Visions were they not all
[1:17:43] fulfilled each one has been fulfilled or
[1:17:46] is in the process right now
[1:17:48] amen where are we in this abrahamic age
[1:17:51] we're living he said we are in a great
[1:17:53] time the great hour we're living in all
[1:17:55] the Visions have been fulfilled Feast of
[1:17:58] the trumpets it's a mystery revealed in
[1:18:00] this day the son of man to the evening
[1:18:02] message that the last sign was to be
[1:18:04] seen that discernment before the change
[1:18:06] of the body the discernment before the
[1:18:09] change of the body now somebody asked me
[1:18:10] one time what I thought about all the
[1:18:12] blood moons and sometimes uh some of the
[1:18:14] ministers were preaching on the blood
[1:18:16] moons and that was a big deal somebody
[1:18:18] called me and said brother Wayne what do
[1:18:19] you think about these blood moons are
[1:18:20] you keeping up with it I said well
[1:18:22] somebody's a good book salesman's all I
[1:18:24] can tell you amen because if they can't
[1:18:25] even figure out that Malachi 4 is Elijah
[1:18:28] is William Branham I'm not going to
[1:18:30] depend on them for end time signs they
[1:18:33] miss the biggest and greatest sign that
[1:18:35] there is I'm not going to be asking them
[1:18:37] about the other signs when they have
[1:18:39] missed the sign and Church of the Living
[1:18:41] God we're not looking for signs we have
[1:18:44] received the sign of the change of the
[1:18:46] body somebody said well how do you know
[1:18:48] what ahead because I sing the sign I've
[1:18:51] seen the last sign to the church amen
[1:18:53] God has given us everything that we need
[1:18:56] for the change of our body amen right
[1:18:58] now Russia is in a place it's ready to
[1:19:01] bomb America does anybody realize where
[1:19:03] we are with Russia you go back to the
[1:19:06] 1960s and you look at the you look at
[1:19:08] the uh you look at the the other Cuban
[1:19:10] Missile Crisis do you know that the
[1:19:13] scientists and the politics and the Army
[1:19:15] is saying we're closer right now to
[1:19:18] nuclear war than we were in the Cuban
[1:19:20] Missile Crisis days we are right back
[1:19:22] where we were when a prophet left the
[1:19:25] scene we have re-entered the rest like
[1:19:27] somebody pushed a pause button and now
[1:19:29] they've took their finger off of the
[1:19:31] pause button and let me tell you this
[1:19:32] amen there's there's something there
[1:19:34] that this America is under judgment
[1:19:37] since
[1:19:38] 1956 amen we don't need another Prophet
[1:19:41] to rise up and say judgment's owner we
[1:19:43] don't need another day of prayer she's
[1:19:45] already rejected her day of Grace amen
[1:19:47] and she is seeking to the bottom of the
[1:19:50] ocean some morning amen but the power of
[1:19:53] it is is the prophet of God said listen
[1:19:54] but we've got to shelter the name of the
[1:19:57] Lord is a mighty tower and the righteous
[1:19:59] went into it and are saved no matter how
[1:20:01] many bombs or anything else we are saved
[1:20:04] so the world and the sinner they don't
[1:20:06] have a shelter they don't have a safety
[1:20:09] place it's a shaking time if I wasn't a
[1:20:12] Christian I'd go crazy to thinking of
[1:20:14] what might happen at any time with a
[1:20:16] house full of little kitties I wouldn't
[1:20:18] know what to do but I'm so glad that I
[1:20:20] got a place to stand in my house and
[1:20:23] introduce them to a shelter that no bomb
[1:20:25] could ever touch or nothing else under
[1:20:28] the protecting wings of the Lord Jesus
[1:20:30] not by power not by might but by my
[1:20:33] spirit saith the Lord that is eye
[1:20:36] protection tonight
[1:20:38] that is our protection tonight we said
[1:20:40] well bombs are about to drop what kind
[1:20:42] of shelter are we going to be we're
[1:20:43] going to build some kind of bomb shelter
[1:20:45] or something brother Adam says don't be
[1:20:47] scared no hydrogen bomb or nothing else
[1:20:49] as long as you got Christ in your heart
[1:20:51] that is the best bomb shelter I know of
[1:20:53] and it's made out of filters feathers
[1:20:56] under his wings we will abide so don't
[1:20:59] worry about these things if you're a
[1:21:01] Christian Old Church of the Living God
[1:21:04] if you're a Christian you don't need no
[1:21:05] pills tonight you don't need a
[1:21:07] psychologist to calm you down tonight if
[1:21:10] you're a Christian what you need to do
[1:21:12] is get under the Peace of the baptism of
[1:21:15] the Holy Ghost as a shelter of Our Lives
[1:21:18] that we might change in the moment in
[1:21:20] the twinkle of an eye amen I believe
[1:21:22] it's a powerful thing now now there's a
[1:21:24] lot of people has different directions
[1:21:26] on the message and I I can't help Which
[1:21:28] Way some other people go it really and I
[1:21:31] have to be real clear about this amen
[1:21:33] when I preach something it's not in a
[1:21:35] Prejudice to what someone else preaches
[1:21:37] it's just I don't allow because someone
[1:21:39] else preaches something different to
[1:21:41] keep me from preaching what I believe is
[1:21:42] truth do you see do you see that
[1:21:45] somebody said well he's against this guy
[1:21:46] he's against that guy no really I'm not
[1:21:49] see I've been preaching this message
[1:21:51] longer than some guys had been born
[1:21:53] and I've been preaching a lot longer
[1:21:55] than a lot of guys has been pastoring so
[1:21:58] sometimes a pastor will start pastoring
[1:22:00] then you're preaching a certain way and
[1:22:01] they say well he's talking about that
[1:22:02] guy don't get my takes 10 years ago or
[1:22:04] 15 years ago or 20 years ago and I was
[1:22:07] preaching the same thing before these
[1:22:09] people come on the scene but because
[1:22:11] they say something a certain way does it
[1:22:13] mean that I'm going to quit preaching
[1:22:15] the truth
[1:22:16] come on church amen we need to get out
[1:22:19] of that old spirit
[1:22:21] we need to get out of that old spirit
[1:22:22] because it's a binding Spirit where it's
[1:22:25] a it's a wrong mode of applied to the
[1:22:28] Gospel of Jesus Christ we're not
[1:22:30] preaching the gospel to argue with
[1:22:31] someone or or we're not preaching the
[1:22:33] gospel to say this guy's right and this
[1:22:35] guy's wrong this is for the bride so
[1:22:37] they can take a change of their body
[1:22:39] amen we need a release and of a freedom
[1:22:42] amen where our hearts return back to joy
[1:22:45] and peace and the glory of God I think
[1:22:48] these old binding Spirits we ought to
[1:22:50] open up the door and say devil you're
[1:22:52] dismissed tonight you can't got no right
[1:22:54] to bind the church you ain't got no
[1:22:56] right to bind the preacher I say let
[1:22:59] Liberty come in the house of God again
[1:23:00] let the power the power of the Holy
[1:23:03] Ghost flow in the church with anointing
[1:23:05] and we're truth amen you know what it
[1:23:07] used to be you could just break out and
[1:23:09] dance down the aisle and you didn't
[1:23:11] think nothing about it you can worship
[1:23:13] and have a wonderful time come on church
[1:23:16] amen I'll tell you what happened so
[1:23:18] little problems come up well you
[1:23:20] shouldn't have pushed back if you didn't
[1:23:21] want me to preach the problems come up
[1:23:23] and they come up and they come up and
[1:23:25] now you can't hear one preacher without
[1:23:27] he's talking about you you can't hear
[1:23:29] this preacher unless he's talking about
[1:23:31] that and that ain't nothing but an Old
[1:23:33] Devil to keep you from enjoying the
[1:23:36] house of God you know what you ought to
[1:23:38] do opposite
[1:23:40] it's not Old Devil amen trying to keep
[1:23:42] you from rejoicing you are the same to
[1:23:44] your feet say glory to God I gotta
[1:23:46] Liberty to praise God
[1:23:49] you want to do opposite of whatever that
[1:23:51] Devil's telling you
[1:23:54] that's why I do things
[1:23:57] that's what I do if a dog bites you you
[1:24:00] know what brother bam said the best
[1:24:01] medicine for the dog bite is the hair on
[1:24:03] the dog's back
[1:24:05] I'm a hillbilly sorry I understood that
[1:24:08] statement
[1:24:09] you know what he was saying he's saying
[1:24:12] you got a problem with somebody bake
[1:24:13] them a pie tell me you love them
[1:24:16] and if you think they got something well
[1:24:17] you just buy them something tell them I
[1:24:19] love you God bless you
[1:24:21] come on can we preach now look what he's
[1:24:24] saying he's saying the prophet is saying
[1:24:26] look now the hour that we're living
[1:24:28] we're surely at the end now the prophet
[1:24:31] could not this is the thing that if this
[1:24:33] this just amazes me at the at the level
[1:24:37] of character of this prophet
[1:24:39] that that he's a judgment Prophet
[1:24:42] putting judgment upon the Earth and he
[1:24:45] catches a revelation when they start
[1:24:47] talking about flying saucers or putting
[1:24:49] uh satellites in the heavens when they
[1:24:52] started doing that he takes it to the
[1:24:54] scripture and said signs in the heavens
[1:24:56] above
[1:24:57] and he starts talking about them putting
[1:24:59] the Russia putting that missile up there
[1:25:01] and satellite and he starts identifying
[1:25:04] that with an end-time judgment sign he
[1:25:06] said now look even judgments hanging in
[1:25:09] the heavens so he's showing you what is
[1:25:11] happening he wants to come home and he
[1:25:13] wants to preach a message amen he wants
[1:25:16] to preach a message on the handwriting
[1:25:17] on the wall they just got one sermon
[1:25:20] just got one sermon to preach that day
[1:25:22] he don't have a second service he said
[1:25:25] so I wouldn't preach that service
[1:25:27] because I didn't have a second service
[1:25:29] to preach another sermon now listen to
[1:25:32] him I wanted to preach handwriting on
[1:25:34] the wall he said but see I couldn't then
[1:25:37] leave the people in that condition
[1:25:38] without bringing another message to
[1:25:41] follow it and give a hope to the church
[1:25:43] it leaves the people wondering and makes
[1:25:45] them nervous so I thought next Sunday
[1:25:47] I'll speak on the handwriting on the
[1:25:49] wall on the morning and then Sunday
[1:25:51] night I'll speak on the church Rapture
[1:25:53] him before the tribulation now look at
[1:25:55] this he wouldn't even preach a judgment
[1:25:57] sermon without preaching a Rapture
[1:25:59] sermon he wouldn't preach judgment
[1:26:01] without a way of Escape amen he was a
[1:26:04] prophet of God look at the power of this
[1:26:06] amen as a prophet he could have said
[1:26:08] anything he wanted but he didn't want to
[1:26:10] leave The People Under
[1:26:12] he didn't want to leave it under it
[1:26:15] amen now but before that can take place
[1:26:17] then God called man 1958 brother bam
[1:26:20] said the Bible claims that Russian
[1:26:22] communism is playing right in the hands
[1:26:24] of God to absolutely rid the Earth of
[1:26:25] the people he said that before that can
[1:26:27] take place the Rapture comes and takes
[1:26:30] the church home that's right this takes
[1:26:33] place before tribulation God according
[1:26:37] to scripture he said Noah went into the
[1:26:40] ark before it rained and he said a lot
[1:26:43] left Sodom before the fire fell he said
[1:26:46] and God will have the church leave
[1:26:48] before tribulation Falls now I think
[1:26:51] that ought to be settled in every
[1:26:53] Christian heart in this building tonight
[1:26:54] amen God will let us leave before
[1:26:58] tribulation comes now now look if there
[1:27:00] ain't nothing else going on in your life
[1:27:02] that is shouting material that ought to
[1:27:05] get a stir on the inside of your heart
[1:27:07] and make you say thanks be to God that
[1:27:11] he's given me an escape in a time of
[1:27:13] judgment it's judgment we know but there
[1:27:15] there's an escape for the Bride of Jesus
[1:27:18] Christ and brother Branham says watch
[1:27:20] this when the Rapture takes place all
[1:27:22] the Believers will go of course even
[1:27:24] their children even the family's
[1:27:26] children this was always an amazement to
[1:27:28] me I've had more mothers ask me what
[1:27:31] will happen to my babies if I'm raptured
[1:27:33] you got young children you know and what
[1:27:35] will happen somebody actually got the
[1:27:37] nerve up in thy house and asked brother
[1:27:38] by them and said will my family go in
[1:27:40] the Rapture brother and said yes
[1:27:42] he said yes amen so so it's not
[1:27:46] something that we should have to worry
[1:27:48] about now now here's the thing
[1:27:49] tribulation of course is something that
[1:27:52] people go into but God does everything
[1:27:55] with purpose it's nothing without
[1:27:56] purpose before God and the six The Sixth
[1:27:59] Seal tribulation is a threefold purpose
[1:28:02] the number one purpose of that is that
[1:28:05] it would it would Purge the hundred and
[1:28:07] forty four thousand right and then it
[1:28:10] would Purge the foolish virgin and then
[1:28:12] it would Purge the Earth so there's
[1:28:14] three things the six he'll do and none
[1:28:17] of that has anything to do with a bride
[1:28:20] so somebody said well I think the bride
[1:28:22] goes through tribulation why does she go
[1:28:24] through it
[1:28:25] what would be the purpose of putting
[1:28:28] someone through the tribulation it's a
[1:28:30] purging time but the bride has already
[1:28:34] been purged by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:28:37] of course amen there are people that
[1:28:40] need purging them that have denied the
[1:28:42] word they're not under the blood and
[1:28:45] they need a Persian but to the Bride of
[1:28:47] Jesus Christ she's went through the
[1:28:49] greatest purging that anyone could go
[1:28:51] through she's went through the blood of
[1:28:54] Jesus Christ I'll tell you there's
[1:28:56] nothing else that can Purge a man like
[1:28:57] the blood brother banham said I think it
[1:29:00] ought to be truly settled in every
[1:29:01] believer's heart that Christ never takes
[1:29:03] the tribulation period the church the
[1:29:05] bride never takes it you can't put her
[1:29:07] in the tribulation you put the church
[1:29:09] there but not the bride the bride's gone
[1:29:11] she has not won sin not one thing
[1:29:14] against her at all the grace of God has
[1:29:17] covered her and the bleach has took
[1:29:19] every sin so far away as not even a
[1:29:22] remembrance of sin not a thing of Purity
[1:29:25] perfect in the presence of God holy
[1:29:28] daughter make the bride get down on
[1:29:29] their knees and cry out to God Amen
[1:29:32] there is a tribulation but we won't be
[1:29:34] there because there ain't no need to go
[1:29:36] there amen our clothes are already
[1:29:38] cleaned in the cycle of the Rapture
[1:29:41] there's been a washing of the water of
[1:29:44] the word of God I tell you what you
[1:29:46] can't make a sinner out of her the
[1:29:48] bleach of the blood has cleansed her and
[1:29:50] if you wash somebody with a bleach of
[1:29:52] the blood there is nothing left of the
[1:29:54] former sin that's upon that person the
[1:29:57] bleach has took every sin so far away
[1:29:59] there's not even a remembrance
[1:30:04] that's hard for us to conceive isn't it
[1:30:07] not even a remembrance of it
[1:30:10] 129 amen paragraph 129 the first seal
[1:30:13] brother Brown said listen hey how can a
[1:30:16] man say the bride of Christ goes in the
[1:30:17] tribulation I don't understand it she's
[1:30:19] took away from the tribulation if the
[1:30:22] church has been judged and they have
[1:30:24] judged themselves and accepted the blood
[1:30:26] how can God judge a man that's perfectly
[1:30:30] totally sinless now that's a that's
[1:30:34] that's something to release our hearts
[1:30:36] tonight folks perfectly totally sinless
[1:30:40] and look at what brother Adam said he
[1:30:42] says you say there's no such a person he
[1:30:44] said every born and again True Believer
[1:30:46] is perfectly absolutely sinless before
[1:30:50] God Amen how many Believers I got in the
[1:30:52] house tonight and now come on don't you

[1:31:08] got a memory but God don't have it I
[1:31:11] know your brother's got a memory but God

[1:31:16] our soul in the blood of the Lamb what
[1:31:19] about worship our mind in the blood and
[1:31:21] forgetting about our transgressions and
[1:31:24] the failures of our life and say God

[1:31:39] something out if I do this I'll get
[1:31:41] there if I do this I'll get there the

[1:33:45] Amen I tell you about that blood it's a
[1:33:48] powerful blood
[1:33:49] in Psalms 27 amen it says for in the
[1:33:52] time of trouble shall he hide me in the
[1:33:55] Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle
[1:33:57] shall he hide me he shall set me upon a
[1:34:00] rock for in the time of tribulation can
[1:34:02] we say it like that or in the time of
[1:34:04] trouble in the time of judgment how many
[1:34:06] knows brother Brown threw up a rock all
[1:34:08] the way back there in 1964. threw that
[1:34:11] rock up and said judgment is coming
[1:34:13] remember and then on that Friday of the
[1:34:15] Passover amen Alaska almost sunk when
[1:34:18] brother bam threw that rock up judgment
[1:34:20] City and upon the nation and when he
[1:34:23] threw that rock up he said bride head
[1:34:25] for the secret place he said what is the
[1:34:27] secret place he said the promises of
[1:34:29] Malachi 4 and Luke 17 amen what is it
[1:34:33] it's a bride running into the Promised
[1:34:35] word of the age we're living in we're
[1:34:37] already sheltered upon Church judgment
[1:34:40] is falling on the nation but it ain't
[1:34:42] fell upon the house of God Amen you say
[1:34:44] why why what do you mean ain't fell on
[1:34:46] the house of God the last thing to fall
[1:34:49] is spiritual day death but brother amen
[1:34:51] I'm alive tonight amen I'm Not Dead in
[1:34:54] this place tonight and I'm here to let
[1:34:56] the devil know I'm still alive and
[1:34:58] kicking and I'm going to keep preaching
[1:35:00] as long as I got breath in my body hey I
[1:35:04] know the devil would like to shut us up
[1:35:06] you know
[1:35:06] [Applause]
[1:35:08] I know he would I remember we're going
[1:35:10] to keep preaching anyhow
[1:35:11] [Applause]
[1:35:13] oh yeah
[1:35:14] but in the time of trouble Haley had me
[1:35:16] said well bro Wayne how do you know how
[1:35:18] do you know I ain't going in there it's
[1:35:19] cool what your name is
[1:35:21] hey man how many knows brother and
[1:35:22] preach a whole message called
[1:35:23] identification
[1:35:25] you know he said how to identify
[1:35:27] yourself he said go in the Bible and
[1:35:30] watch the characters in the scripture
[1:35:31] and identify your present character with
[1:35:34] the characters in The Bible
[1:35:36] so if you want to know who you were in
[1:35:38] the disciples look at the ministry of
[1:35:40] Jesus Christ and watch how they reacted
[1:35:43] and there was a fair scene there's a
[1:35:44] woman at the well which are you it
[1:35:46] matters that Peter and James and John
[1:35:48] and then there's a Judas which one are
[1:35:49] you do you see what he's saying to you
[1:35:51] you've got to identify with one of those
[1:35:54] people because the same Jesus is here
[1:35:56] that was there is that right so now you
[1:36:00] can identify yourself because we have if
[1:36:02] you had to have two elements you're
[1:36:04] going to have you're going to have one
[1:36:05] of them here and that same Jesus is here
[1:36:08] so the way you respond to that Jesus is
[1:36:11] telling us who you are in the scriptures
[1:36:14] that's a pretty powerful thing when it
[1:36:17] comes into the positive
[1:36:19] hey man when it comes into the positive
[1:36:20] it's a pretty powerful thing because you
[1:36:22] say what are you saying I'm saying
[1:36:23] what's according to who you are
[1:36:24] according what's about to happen to you
[1:36:26] is calling what's about to happen to you
[1:36:28] because look what you can do you go out
[1:36:30] in the Bible and you can see about about
[1:36:32] Abraham sending Eliezer after a bride
[1:36:35] for Isaac all right now let's get real
[1:36:37] simple amen Eliezer is a prophetic word
[1:36:41] or a message William Branham ashamed
[1:36:43] brother bam identifies himself as at
[1:36:45] Elisha and he said he went among
[1:36:47] Abraham's kinfo those that had the Holy
[1:36:50] Ghost
[1:36:51] and he said he was looking for a mate
[1:36:54] for Isaacs that's when he went and he
[1:36:56] went to The Well of the virgins that's
[1:36:58] where he went with the words of Remember
[1:37:00] at the time in the evening when they
[1:37:02] were gathered together amen now elieza
[1:37:05] is William Branham come on church amen
[1:37:08] but it matters how you respond to the
[1:37:11] message it tells us who you are
[1:37:14] and there was a lot of women that come
[1:37:15] to that well but none of their name made
[1:37:17] the scripture they were just women
[1:37:19] that's all they were they were just what
[1:37:21] they were just the millions amen but
[1:37:24] there was one little girl that walked up
[1:37:26] to the well and the way she responded
[1:37:28] got her name written down and three
[1:37:31] thousand years later we're preaching
[1:37:33] about this woman because she didn't die
[1:37:36] that spirit is still alive today in the
[1:37:40] Church of the Living God it was an
[1:37:41] attribute that was in a tight being as
[1:37:43] fulfilled in his greater type now in
[1:37:46] this generation and look what he did
[1:37:47] when he went down to that well Ellie
[1:37:49] he's on his way he started praying y'all
[1:37:50] know the prayer and he said Lord amen
[1:37:52] let the woman that's supposed to marry
[1:37:54] Isaac respond like this you remember he
[1:37:56] said I'll ask for a drink and then
[1:37:58] she'll give me a drink and then she'll
[1:37:59] offer to water my camels now he didn't
[1:38:01] tell her any of that she didn't hear any
[1:38:03] of that
[1:38:04] but the minute he said yeah I'd like to
[1:38:06] have a drink she said well I water you
[1:38:08] I'll give you a drink but I'll get the
[1:38:09] camels also oh brother
[1:38:12] she had part of the word that wasn't
[1:38:14] even written down
[1:38:15] she had part of the word nobody had ever
[1:38:17] told her hey man where was that word at
[1:38:19] it was in her that response was laying
[1:38:22] in or amen and God was recording the way
[1:38:25] you could identify the Bride In the End
[1:38:27] Time amen they would water the camels of
[1:38:30] Elisha not only did they give a little
[1:38:32] drink to Elise or they said we'll water
[1:38:34] whatever brought you here brother man
[1:38:36] said those those camels y'all know the
[1:38:38] story he said those camels represented a
[1:38:41] power that brought Elijah to the whale
[1:38:43] which is represented as the power of the
[1:38:47] Holy Ghost in the end time that brings
[1:38:49] the end time messenger is that right he
[1:38:51] said National Force will put Israel in
[1:38:54] his place but the power of God will put
[1:38:57] the bride in their place listen amen we
[1:39:00] are not riding the Scarlet Beast of
[1:39:02] Revelation 17 but we are mounted on to
[1:39:06] the camel of the power of God that's
[1:39:08] going to ride this church all the way
[1:39:10] into the promised land and I'll tell you
[1:39:12] what Rebecca did she watered those
[1:39:14] camels foreign

[1:39:22] can't beat my type my type what is that
[1:39:24] Camel in the Bible it was the Holy Ghost
[1:39:27] at the well amen that was going to carry
[1:39:29] her out of there you know what it is the
[1:39:31] holy spirit can come into some places
[1:39:32] amen and it'll first to death and it'll
[1:39:35] just die out right in the amen the power
[1:39:38] of it is there the reality is there
[1:39:40] it'll just keep getting lower and lower
[1:39:42] and lower and lower and lower but if
[1:39:43] Rebecca's in the place if there's a
[1:39:45] Rebecca in there she's going to start
[1:39:47] watering it until the power of the Holy
[1:39:50] Ghost is refreshed among the Church of
[1:39:53] the Living God I say refresh the Holy
[1:39:56] Ghost bring back the power of God bring
[1:39:58] back something that'll carry us out of

[1:46:45] come what your name is
[1:46:49] do you know who else you are I don't
[1:46:50] know her actual name
[1:46:53] but I know who she was
[1:46:54] there was a woman in the name in the
[1:46:56] Bible who was Joseph's wife
[1:46:59] yeah
[1:47:01] do you know she was a gentile
[1:47:03] married to the tribe that was going to
[1:47:06] lead the Jews
[1:47:08] and while Joseph was killed of his
[1:47:10] Brethren they thought he had been
[1:47:12] resurrected and become the Lord of
[1:47:14] another country
[1:47:16] and them Jews think they killed Jesus
[1:47:18] but he's resurrected and became the lord
[1:47:21] of the Gentiles and while as being the
[1:47:23] lord of the Gentiles he saved the whole
[1:47:25] world even the Jews is that right but
[1:47:28] while he was there he had a couple of
[1:47:31] his own seed through a gentile life and
[1:47:34] he had that woman all the way up to the
[1:47:36] Revelation to his Brethren of who he was
[1:47:38] but the Revelation leaned there's the
[1:47:40] prophet of God said you type Joseph's
[1:47:43] wife and when the Brethren returned he
[1:47:45] said he was going to reveal himself he
[1:47:47] said but before I can you've got to go
[1:47:50] to the Palace
[1:47:51] brother Brown said the only way for you
[1:47:54] get to the Palace is a change of your
[1:47:56] body listen Joseph's Brethren are up
[1:47:59] there right now I don't know if y'all
[1:48:01] realize this but that man's name is
[1:48:03] Benjamin not nahu and he's already been
[1:48:06] gone and back again come on church amen
[1:48:09] there's something about that man
[1:48:10] Benjamin amen and there's another group
[1:48:12] in the Bible who come under Benjamin in
[1:48:15] the last day I I believe it's going home
[1:48:18] time I believe the bride is right there
[1:48:20] I believe it's a season to be translated
[1:48:23] in the moment in the twinkle of an eye
[1:48:26] now the story doesn't read they took her
[1:48:28] out back and beat her
[1:48:30] the story doesn't read that they took
[1:48:31] her outside and put her through some
[1:48:33] kind of tribulation while he was
[1:48:35] revealing they took her to the Palace
[1:48:37] brother
[1:48:39] and Jesus is taking this bride to the
[1:48:41] Palace
[1:48:41] [Applause]
[1:48:44] huh
[1:48:46] now for trumpet gives an uncertain sound
[1:48:48] who can prepare for that battle
[1:48:49] [Applause]
[1:48:56] all shot
[1:49:00] glory be to Gob what an hour to live huh
[1:49:04] devil ain't got a chance in this place
[1:49:05] open that other door give him room get
[1:49:07] out of here
[1:49:12] if he don't get out here quick he gonna
[1:49:13] get a baptism in the Holy Ghost
[1:49:19] the trumpet gives an uncertain sound who
[1:49:21] can prepare for the battle
[1:49:24] who can prepare for paradox
[1:49:27] we're not preparing for tribulation
[1:49:29] we're not storing food and weapons and
[1:49:31] money and trying to get ourselves ready
[1:49:33] for this tribulation is coming no sir
[1:49:34] this bride's preparing for paradox
[1:49:38] now I I'm not dumb I got a family I got
[1:49:41] a freezer and I got some food and I got
[1:49:43] some water because a storm could hit and
[1:49:45] knock your power out for two weeks but I
[1:49:47] ain't looking for no tribulation
[1:49:49] I'm a boy scout
[1:49:51] I really am from way back I'm a Boy
[1:49:53] Scout I made life I almost went to Eagle
[1:49:55] but we got to we we had disagreements
[1:49:58] before we got that far
[1:50:00] sorry
[1:50:02] it's true
[1:50:05] but I'm going to another club
[1:50:09] and not only life I made eagle
[1:50:14] I got told how to get ready
[1:50:17] how to be ready
[1:50:18] how to live ready
[1:50:20] that's right see because something is
[1:50:22] going to change our body it will be a
[1:50:24] paradox
[1:50:25] now Paul said that our conversation is
[1:50:28] Heaven for which we look for the Savior
[1:50:30] our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:50:31] who shall change our vile body I love
[1:50:34] the word who there
[1:50:35] I love the word who it's not what it's
[1:50:38] who
[1:50:39] how many ever listen to the tape to whom
[1:50:41] shall I go
[1:50:43] to whom if you want translation where
[1:50:46] are you going
[1:50:47] who are you going to go to
[1:50:48] if you really want a body change who you
[1:50:51] gonna go to
[1:50:53] there's only one person that can change
[1:50:55] your vile body and that is our Lord
[1:50:57] Jesus Christ the word vile here it's a
[1:51:00] powerful thing vile actually means
[1:51:03] humiliation Tabernacle of humiliation
[1:51:05] brother man uses the word he's speaking
[1:51:07] of Philippians 3. I don't know if he
[1:51:09] actually knew it was the Greek or not
[1:51:10] but but he brought it out he said this
[1:51:12] that someday we're going to be changed
[1:51:13] the Old Vile body of humiliation be
[1:51:15] changed and fashioned made like and
[1:51:18] under your body
[1:51:19] see we're groaning now Faith is
[1:51:21] substance he said veiled in this
[1:51:23] Tabernacle of humiliation and the urn is
[1:51:25] my perfect complete Redemption like in
[1:51:27] the beginning God created Adam the
[1:51:29] Garden of Eden now see someday this
[1:51:32] Mortal will take on immortality
[1:51:36] the the vile shall become glorified
[1:51:39] that's exactly what the church is
[1:51:41] looking for you say you're looking for a
[1:51:42] change what kind of change you're
[1:51:44] looking for I'm looking for to go from
[1:51:46] Mortal to immortal
[1:51:48] from corruptable to Incorruptible see my
[1:51:52] soul has already been changed
[1:51:54] Rising Sun I'm preaching to you now he
[1:51:56] said resurrected already
[1:51:58] can't miss it he said if they put you in
[1:52:00] the ground you'll come up with it and if
[1:52:02] you're alive you're going to change
[1:52:04] because you already got the approval
[1:52:06] from God when your soul was changed
[1:52:08] that's the token your soul is different
[1:52:10] it's ready to go it's just waiting for a
[1:52:13] change of this vile body that brother
[1:52:15] man talks about coming out of a tent
[1:52:16] stepping into another one to be changed
[1:52:19] back see now what was it see our God
[1:52:21] appeared in this this dimension in a
[1:52:25] tabernacle of humiliation himself and
[1:52:27] brought himself into a degradation of
[1:52:30] humanity to prove to the church that you
[1:52:33] can come from humility to glorification
[1:52:35] look at what our lord Jesus done he
[1:52:38] literally come out of the heavens of
[1:52:39] heavens and he came out of that
[1:52:42] glorified place and stepped into
[1:52:45] humiliation and then turned around and
[1:52:48] went back to glorification while he
[1:52:50] stood in humiliation he said father
[1:52:52] glorify me with the glory which I had
[1:52:55] before the foundations of the world so
[1:52:58] he came out of glory and took on
[1:53:00] humiliation and then turned around and
[1:53:03] went back to glory to prove to you that
[1:53:06] if you have fallen from there that you
[1:53:09] can return there the same way he did
[1:53:11] amen he came from there and he went back
[1:53:14] to there do you know that you came from
[1:53:17] God and you're returning back to God
[1:53:19] Amen but you bypassed the word but now
[1:53:22] the word has come to glorify you and put
[1:53:25] you back in your original state that you
[1:53:27] might be lifted back into the presence
[1:53:29] of God Amen now listen there's going to
[1:53:32] be a path that the church could take
[1:53:34] there's going to be a path the church
[1:53:36] can take now listen God don't put us
[1:53:39] through tribulation there's no need to
[1:53:41] because Jesus stripped himself
[1:53:43] humiliated himself and come down in the
[1:53:47] Great Divine from above
[1:53:50] now brother Bam's going to give us the
[1:53:52] reason
[1:53:53] how many ever studied the cross you ever
[1:53:54] study the cross
[1:53:56] now I know people talk about the cross
[1:53:58] and they they read about the cross
[1:54:01] but if you ever really studied the cross
[1:54:04] now if you've ever wondered why
[1:54:06] we do not have to go through tribulation
[1:54:09] take the next week of your life
[1:54:12] and study what the cross did for you
[1:54:15] if you're still wondering if you have to
[1:54:17] go through tribulation you don't have a
[1:54:19] revelation of the cross
[1:54:21] I'm not trying to mean that in a
[1:54:23] demedium way I just mean you don't know
[1:54:25] yet what Jesus did for you
[1:54:28] because if you ever see what he did you
[1:54:31] would never think you had to redo it
[1:54:34] if you've ever seen the price he paid
[1:54:36] you would never try to pay it again
[1:54:40] amen if you could only see it he
[1:54:42] stripped himself and humiliated himself
[1:54:44] and he came down here humbled himself
[1:54:47] into a tabernacle where he took the
[1:54:50] lowest name he could take he took the
[1:54:52] lowest job he could take so remember
[1:54:54] become a football is flunky done the
[1:54:56] lowest job with the lowest name that a
[1:54:58] man could do and he done all of that to
[1:55:01] show you how low that deity could go
[1:55:04] before it returned back to glorification
[1:55:08] some people said well I'll tell you what
[1:55:10] deity can't dwell in me because of my
[1:55:12] humble beginnings and where I came from
[1:55:14] the situations of my life amen you're
[1:55:16] completely wrong deity dwelt in humility
[1:55:20] did he dwell in humanity deity suffered
[1:55:24] dear to God but deity rose again amen it
[1:55:28] could be humiliated to the place of no
[1:55:31] Act of humiliation greater than the act
[1:55:33] of Calvary it was the greatest it was
[1:55:36] the most humiliating and the greatest
[1:55:37] punishment that anyone could put Upon A
[1:55:40] man the Romans the Romans actually would
[1:55:43] not even want to do their own citizens
[1:55:45] like this I'm not going to preach on the
[1:55:48] cross and agreed the extent tonight but
[1:55:49] I do want to say this that he and his
[1:55:51] humiliation his judgment was taken away
[1:55:54] and who shall declare this generation
[1:55:57] for his life was taken from the Earth
[1:56:00] of course this man our lord Jesus came
[1:56:03] into our degradation that's a beautiful
[1:56:04] word if you study it but he came into
[1:56:06] our degradation and and what it means is
[1:56:10] is that he was unanimously considered
[1:56:13] the most horrible form of death among
[1:56:15] Romans the degradation was also a part
[1:56:18] of the infliction and the punishment if
[1:56:20] applied to a free man it was usually in
[1:56:22] the case of the vileless criminals so
[1:56:24] when when someone was crucified it
[1:56:27] wasn't only to kill them like electric
[1:56:30] chair or by punishment of gas it was to
[1:56:33] humiliate them publicly before man so
[1:56:36] when they when they hung a man on the
[1:56:37] cross it was a visible out in the open
[1:56:40] thing that everybody could see how
[1:56:43] horrible this human was and then they
[1:56:45] didn't even give them the Dignity of
[1:56:47] being crucified and closed they stripped
[1:56:49] them naked and hang them publicly beaten
[1:56:52] and riveted in the most humiliated state
[1:56:55] that a man could be in that see when our
[1:56:58] lord Jesus came he didn't come to a
[1:57:01] palace
[1:57:02] he didn't come to a drive in the best of
[1:57:05] the cars and living in the greatest
[1:57:06] homes not our lord Jesus he came to the
[1:57:09] lowest place a man could go and then
[1:57:11] when he couldn't lower himself any
[1:57:14] further the Romans took him to another
[1:57:16] level of low Amen in the Hebrews chapter
[1:57:19] 2 it tells us amen that he didn't even
[1:57:21] take on him the form of angels
[1:57:24] but he came lower than the Angels amen
[1:57:28] and told us this that he took upon him
[1:57:30] the the very Seed of Abraham that he
[1:57:33] might be called our brother
[1:57:35] that he might be tempted in every like
[1:57:37] manner of man now that that deserves
[1:57:40] longer than I have to give it tonight
[1:57:42] but I'll say this in a very short way
[1:57:44] amen that what he did was he came into a
[1:57:48] place that he identified with every
[1:57:51] person suffering here tonight it doesn't
[1:57:53] matter what level of suffering that
[1:57:55] you're taking he was he was tempted in
[1:57:58] every like manner of man how many knows
[1:58:00] he was tempted in every gate of man he
[1:58:03] was tempted in every way of man now the
[1:58:05] Oneness Pentecost people used to if yeah
[1:58:08] if you ever if you're a preacher and you
[1:58:09] ever preached on the godhead there's a
[1:58:11] certain group always say well he's a
[1:58:12] Oneness you know amen and I don't mean
[1:58:15] to kick off on anybody but they'll call
[1:58:17] you Oneness because you preach the
[1:58:18] Oneness of the godhead but what what
[1:58:20] they try to do is identify you with the
[1:58:22] Pentecostals who believe in the Oneness
[1:58:23] of the godhead and the Pentecost but
[1:58:25] what they believed is that it was so
[1:58:27] much deity that it was God in the that
[1:58:29] he was God the flesh was God and he
[1:58:31] couldn't have had sex he couldn't have
[1:58:33] children he couldn't have smoked a
[1:58:34] cigarette he couldn't have whiskey hey
[1:58:36] man he couldn't have entered into sin of
[1:58:37] any kind but that's a lie amen he was
[1:58:40] every way a human being or he was not
[1:58:44] your Kinsmen
[1:58:46] so if you ever argue the godhead was
[1:58:48] someone ask him are we talking about his
[1:58:50] Humanity or are we talking about his
[1:58:52] deity because if it was a human you're
[1:58:55] talking about I can prove to you he was
[1:58:57] ever been human he suffered every bit of
[1:59:00] the way our human would suffer but if
[1:59:02] you want to talk about deity he was ever
[1:59:04] bit God in the human flesh until Paul
[1:59:07] said the fullness of the godhead dwelt
[1:59:10] bodily in Christ Jesus our lord he was
[1:59:13] ever met God and he was ever been a man
[1:59:15] if he wasn't man he wasn't your Kinsmen
[1:59:17] if he wasn't God you're not saved but
[1:59:20] God to the blood of his own son
[1:59:22] sacrificed that blood and paid the debt
[1:59:25] and the penalty of every man child and
[1:59:28] woman sitting here but not only did he
[1:59:30] forgive you a sin he suffered so he
[1:59:32] could understand your Temptation and
[1:59:35] from the lowest places yours of your sin
[1:59:37] he can carry you to a glorified place
[1:59:41] [Applause]
[1:59:43] brother I tell you that in order to be a
[1:59:46] blessing for every person sitting here
[1:59:47] tonight
[1:59:48] that he's able that he is able to feel
[1:59:51] the Temptations
[1:59:55] of what you're going through he knows
[1:59:58] what it's like church somebody somebody
[2:00:00] tried to present that he's God on the
[2:00:02] cross you know it was God that walked
[2:00:04] the hill it was God in one sense it was
[2:00:06] but we had a prophet that told us that
[2:00:09] the spirit left him in Gethsemane and he
[2:00:11] went to the Cross as a man not as a God
[2:00:14] come on church he carried the cross as a
[2:00:18] man not as a god
[2:00:19] come on friends you know what I'm
[2:00:21] talking about he drug his own cross and
[2:00:24] he did it to you and me why didn't he
[2:00:26] stop halfway up the hill why didn't he
[2:00:28] quit halfway in the going and surprise
[2:00:30] he had to pay that was the reason that
[2:00:32] he pressed on it was a bride on his mind
[2:00:35] he said I'll take her from the
[2:00:37] humiliation the glorification but he had
[2:00:40] to have a price to pay for that
[2:00:43] it was the blood
[2:00:45] he didn't go to Calvary as a God he went
[2:00:49] there as a man
[2:00:52] and every devil in hell tell him you
[2:00:54] don't have to do this you know
[2:00:57] you can turn around
[2:00:58] you don't have to you know how to put
[2:01:00] yourself through this you can you can
[2:01:03] let these people fend for themselves
[2:01:05] but he he went on
[2:01:08] he went on beaten
[2:01:10] and torn
[2:01:12] blood soaked
[2:01:15] it wasn't bad enough that he did that
[2:01:16] the stripped her clothes he walked there
[2:01:18] as a as a as a naked man I mean folks
[2:01:22] I I only won't be seen without my shirt
[2:01:24] on
[2:01:25] getting the public can you imagine
[2:01:26] walking out in the public with just I
[2:01:28] mean you know just
[2:01:31] you're talking about humiliated
[2:01:35] and it wasn't just any man they'd done
[2:01:37] this way it was the king
[2:01:40] it was the king of all of Heaven
[2:01:43] and they're humiliating him this way but
[2:01:45] brother Shamar he keeps going anyhow
[2:01:48] you know why you know what the prophet
[2:01:50] said water from The Rock in 55 he's
[2:01:52] preaching and all of a sudden he says I
[2:01:54] see it he said I see Adam leaving the
[2:01:57] garden he said I see them bloody
[2:01:59] sheepskins he's in a vision he said his
[2:02:01] spot in the side of Adam's legs and I
[2:02:04] see him believing in humiliation I see
[2:02:07] him leaving in defeat he said but now
[2:02:09] the vision is breaking he said I see
[2:02:11] another Adam I see him coming down a
[2:02:14] cobblestone Road he's got a cross on his
[2:02:16] back and he said they're his roles he
[2:02:19] said it starts it starts putting
[2:02:20] together and the Blood starts appearing
[2:02:22] you remember the story amen and his
[2:02:24] blood soaked and he comes to that place
[2:02:26] and brother man said they're going to
[2:02:27] put him on the cross now remember this
[2:02:30] when they put him up there on the cross
[2:02:31] amen here he is putting Adam back in the
[2:02:36] place that he come out of
[2:02:38] thank you
[2:02:40] when they hunt him on the cry I don't
[2:02:43] have time to go deep into this but I
[2:02:44] have to I have to at least show you why
[2:02:46] I believe you don't go through a
[2:02:47] tribulation
[2:02:48] because when they hung him on the cross
[2:02:51] he was answering sin's debt from Genesis
[2:02:54] and Genesis 3 said the woman's seat
[2:02:56] shall bruise the head of the serpent and
[2:02:58] he was there bruising the head of that
[2:03:00] serpent that's what he was doing and you
[2:03:03] know what they did the prophet of God
[2:03:04] y'all on this brother bam said what
[2:03:06] happened was when they beat him in the
[2:03:08] back he said that was for the for the
[2:03:10] for the healing of the body he said when
[2:03:13] they when they pierced his side he said
[2:03:15] that was for the Salvation of the Soul
[2:03:17] he said so what happened he said the
[2:03:19] blood out of that wound of his side ran
[2:03:22] together with the blood on his back and
[2:03:25] when it went down his leg it joined at
[2:03:27] the hip he said and by the time it hit
[2:03:30] the ground it was a blood for salvation
[2:03:32] and healing amen that that blood ran
[2:03:36] together if you preach gospel you've got
[2:03:38] to preach healing If You Preach healing
[2:03:40] you got to preach salvation it's by
[2:03:43] atonement it's not by your Works you're
[2:03:45] saved it's not by your abilities your
[2:03:47] saved you are saved by the blood
[2:03:49] atonement of Jesus Christ the son of God
[2:03:52] and he shed his blood for you you and me
[2:03:55] and by one act of redemption oh man is
[2:03:59] forever free of the power of the Living
[2:04:01] God oh Church there's enough blood to
[2:04:04] save every man as a bluff blood to save
[2:04:06] every person but there was a little
[2:04:08] bride that was only his mind amen that
[2:04:10] God was going to so blood wash her that
[2:04:13] there wouldn't be one spot or one recall
[2:04:16] of the blood of Jesus Christ that
[2:04:18] wouldn't touch her and completely
[2:04:20] cleanse and completely cleansed her life
[2:04:23] well I'll tell you I wish I was a
[2:04:25] songwriter I'd say oh the power of the
[2:04:28] blood amen the blood the blood the
[2:04:31] wonderful blood the blood of Jesus
[2:04:33] Christ
[2:04:34] I'll tell you what I don't have enough
[2:04:36] voice to preach it the way you ought to
[2:04:37] hear it
[2:04:40] blood
[2:04:41] the blood did it
[2:04:46] not because you did any good thing not
[2:04:49] because you said any good thing it's
[2:04:51] because of his blood and the only thing
[2:04:53] that you have done was said Lord I'll
[2:04:55] accept it and you only accept it because
[2:04:58] he gave you a seed to believe it it's
[2:05:00] Grace coming and it's Grace going you're
[2:05:02] wrapped up in the grace of God not good
[2:05:05] work have I done but the grace of God
[2:05:07] and his saved mankind I received the
[2:05:10] blood I received the word but there was
[2:05:13] something in me that wanted it everybody
[2:05:16] oh brother
[2:05:18] [Applause]
[2:05:19] somebody said brother Wayne don't you
[2:05:21] believe in don't you believe in
[2:05:22] sovereignty of choice absolutely I do
[2:05:24] believe in sovereignty of choice but I'm
[2:05:26] told God so grateful that God Amen made
[2:05:29] my choices for me
[2:05:34] every choice you ever made look what it
[2:05:36] got you

[2:05:47] choices got you you'll take all the free
[2:05:49] choice you want to I'll take his choice
[2:05:51] I took what he chose for me he chose a
[2:05:54] path of redemption he chose a path of
[2:05:57] the blood he chose to wash me and I'm
[2:05:59] just going to stand still and let the
[2:06:01] blood of Jesus Christ wash away the sins
[2:06:03] and make me a citizen of another kingdom
[2:06:06] that's why that's why tonight I can
[2:06:09] stand in Victory so brother Wayne how do
[2:06:12] you got victory in such troubled times
[2:06:13] because I got a cross
[2:06:16] y'all know what matters what you look at

[2:06:52] of the Holy Ghost
[2:06:56] hey y'all y'all know the scripture y'all
[2:06:59] remember over there in the Bible where
[2:07:00] it got the Lord who is our Banner one of
[2:07:02] the names of Jehovah remember where they
[2:07:04] got that when Moses was on the mountain
[2:07:06] and they're fighting the amalekites
[2:07:09] and everybody down there fighting and
[2:07:10] the Bible says why Moses hands were
[2:07:13] lifted everybody was winning but when
[2:07:16] Moses his hands fell they began to lose
[2:07:18] so God anointed a couple men said hold
[2:07:21] that man's hands up so we could win a
[2:07:23] while and they and they did it they they
[2:07:25] held up his hands but the prophet of God
[2:07:27] said notice now he said but when they
[2:07:30] come to Jesus Christ he said God nailed
[2:07:33] his hands up on calvary's tree so they
[2:07:36] forever are held up they were always in
[2:07:39] Victory I don't care how low you are
[2:07:41] look to Calvary and you'll get a victory
[2:07:44] look to the presence of God you'll get a

[2:08:07] you'll have Victory oversee him you'll
[2:08:10] have victory over death I'm talking
[2:08:12] about a victory of all victories a
[2:08:15] jubilee of all jubilees it's through the
[2:08:18] power of the blood it's the Blood church
[2:08:21] it's the blood of Jesus Christ he said
[2:08:24] well give me the blood the Holy Ghost is
[2:08:27] the blood
[2:08:28] [Applause]
[2:08:30] I'm letting commanded to sprinkle the
[2:08:33] church with a chemical amen we're to
[2:08:35] speak words Holy Ghost words that
[2:08:38] sprinkles the church and the power of
[2:08:40] the blood of Jesus Christ

[2:08:49] Redemption draweth now
[2:08:52] when you see all these things
[2:08:55] lift up your head Jonah you in the belly
[2:08:58] of the whale but there's a promise
[2:08:59] already if you look this way there's a
[2:09:02] Deliverance coming
[2:09:04] come on Church y'all know I'm writing
[2:09:06] the word
[2:09:07] how'd that man know which way East was
[2:09:09] anyhow because God sovereignly turned
[2:09:12] him the right direction otherwise he
[2:09:14] didn't know head from toll or east from
[2:09:17] west or nothing else but God is present
[2:09:19] in the time of trouble and he headed
[2:09:21] John in the right direction and when he
[2:09:23] began to look at the temple would he
[2:09:25] began to look at the cross when he began
[2:09:27] to look at the word Victory came and the
[2:09:30] and the and the then the devil couldn't
[2:09:32] hold him no more
[2:09:38] now our citizenship it's in heaven
[2:09:42] our citizenship is in heaven
[2:09:46] well I wasn't intending to tell this but
[2:09:49] this is coming like a Russian win I got
[2:09:51] some Liberty here
[2:09:53] as I was traveling here a while back I
[2:09:55] was on an airplane I travel I don't
[2:09:57] remember where I was coming where I was
[2:09:58] going I forget where it's at now but I
[2:10:00] was on the airplane I was sitting there
[2:10:01] and I was meditating over all these
[2:10:03] people getting out of prison because of
[2:10:05] this new DNA stuff
[2:10:06] because there's a lot of innocent people
[2:10:08] in prison I don't know why they all say
[2:10:09] they're Innocent but there is a few
[2:10:11] really that are some of them didn't do
[2:10:13] it you know when there's there's uh
[2:10:15] there's uh evidence that's just a
[2:10:17] circumstantial but just because he's in
[2:10:20] the wrong town and they had the wrong
[2:10:21] prosecutor and the wrong judge they in
[2:10:23] jail
[2:10:23] but this DNA it has a greater Witness
[2:10:27] and so so people are getting out of
[2:10:29] prison and they're they're walking free
[2:10:31] and I was thinking about them people
[2:10:33] sitting on the on the plane I think
[2:10:34] about them people and I thought you know
[2:10:37] I guess I'm a little like that and I got
[2:10:40] out of prison I got to go free
[2:10:43] but then I thought I said but I really
[2:10:45] did it
[2:10:47] and I got to thinking about my life and
[2:10:49] and the Life I Lived before I was a
[2:10:51] Christian I I now I I don't I don't
[2:10:53] share it a lot because I don't give no
[2:10:55] glory to the devil I don't want him I
[2:10:57] don't want it to sound like I'm trying
[2:10:58] to boast up what I was I'm ashamed of
[2:11:00] what I was
[2:11:01] I've had young people say brother Wayne
[2:11:03] I wished I had your testimony well I
[2:11:05] wished I had yours
[2:11:07] it ain't near as glorious as you think
[2:11:08] it is
[2:11:10] matter of fact it's embarrassing as a
[2:11:12] preacher to have to have outlived some
[2:11:14] of the things that we did as a kid
[2:11:17] I was sitting there on that airplane I'm
[2:11:19] sitting there thinking about those
[2:11:20] things and I just dropped my head and I
[2:11:22] said Lord
[2:11:23] how does this fit in the Bible
[2:11:26] How could a man like me ever be free
[2:11:28] really free how could it really be Lord
[2:11:31] I said who am I how did you let this
[2:11:35] happen to me I I really about just about
[2:11:37] bawling about the ignorance of my life
[2:11:39] and about that time just almost an
[2:11:41] audible it might have been audible
[2:11:42] brother but it spoke to me directly and
[2:11:45] he said you're my Barabbas
[2:11:47] brother when he said them words to me it
[2:11:49] was an anointing dropping that airplane
[2:11:50] I started bawling big old alligator
[2:11:53] tears started they probably thought I
[2:11:54] was a crazy man
[2:11:55] but if you knew who Barabbas was
[2:11:58] Barabbas was guilty
[2:12:00] he's completely guilty amen but it was
[2:12:03] the cross that made the man free amen
[2:12:06] somebody told him about the power of the
[2:12:08] Cross listen to me I know sometimes
[2:12:09] people say well that guy he shouldn't be
[2:12:12] preaching the message so that guy
[2:12:13] shouldn't be preaching the message but
[2:12:14] you know it was an old Roman soldier
[2:12:16] that preached the gospel to Barabbas he
[2:12:19] was an unsaved man but what he had to
[2:12:21] say about the cross was so powerful and
[2:12:23] it gave a man Freedom let me tell you it
[2:12:26] ain't always The Vessel you're listening
[2:12:27] to it's the message you're hearing amen
[2:12:30] don't you ever forget this message as
[2:12:32] power whatever whatever mouth had come
[2:12:36] out of y'all know y'all know y'all seen
[2:12:38] a lot of preachers come and go but this
[2:12:40] message still got power in it
[2:12:41] [Applause]
[2:12:46] somebody said brother Wayne are you
[2:12:48] condemned not anymore I ain't
[2:12:50] I'm a Barabbas and I know who I am I
[2:12:53] know where I fit in Scripture that man
[2:12:55] walked free
[2:12:56] and it was up to him do I return to my
[2:12:58] former life or do I go and be a free man
[2:13:00] I'm a free man
[2:13:02] I didn't go back and try to get
[2:13:04] Vengeance I didn't go back and try to
[2:13:06] correct things and make people and make
[2:13:09] them pay for things I went on and went
[2:13:11] free
[2:13:11] just Kim and I know what I'm talking
[2:13:13] about now amen my life's more than
[2:13:16] something I read about I'm a barabba so
[2:13:18] if you've ever been forgiven the way
[2:13:19] I've been forgiven forgiven's the
[2:13:21] easiest thing you ever did somebody said
[2:13:24] what are you talking about I remember
[2:13:25] amen some of y'all might know me long
[2:13:27] enough to know one of one of my one of
[2:13:29] the second brother I got I had killed
[2:13:31] was killed by man back shot him shot him
[2:13:34] uh with a 22 rifle a bunch of times
[2:13:36] hey man did you know the night they shot
[2:13:38] that boy and murdered him right right in
[2:13:40] the right there and they put that old
[2:13:42] boy in jail he spent not even a night in
[2:13:44] jail got out on a 500 Bond the same
[2:13:47] night they made a they made that a
[2:13:49] second degree thing a man spent 10
[2:13:51] months in prison I'm a hillbilly
[2:13:54] Blood for Blood that's the way we lived
[2:13:57] you do that to my brother we hang you
[2:13:59] somewhere high and burn you with fire
[2:14:01] that's the way it happens in the Hills
[2:14:03] amen but I had to make a decision I was
[2:14:06] either going to be a Christian or I was
[2:14:07] going to be a hillbilly and God be
[2:14:10] graceful to my heart he gave me enough
[2:14:12] forgiveness in this old Wicked thing
[2:14:14] that I could say brother I forgive you
[2:14:16] if a man walked in this building tonight
[2:14:18] I'd take him to the river and baptize
[2:14:20] him and invite him into heaven because
[2:14:22] if anybody can forgive me he could
[2:14:24] forgive anybody of anything I say oh God
[2:14:27] that the power of the blood dropping the
[2:14:30] church again with Revival fires and the
[2:14:33] Holy Ghost anointing oh brother this
[2:14:37] ain't just a story that's read it's a
[2:14:39] reality in my life roll the power of the
[2:14:43] blood

[2:14:59] could free me anybody there ain't nobody
[2:15:00] in this room can't be free tonight ain't
[2:15:03] nobody can't walk out of here three of
[2:15:05] every condemnation every fear in every
[2:15:07] situation
[2:15:12] as a citizen of another country I have a
[2:15:14] freedom
[2:15:16] I'm not actually an American
[2:15:18] I Come From Heaven
[2:15:22] my citizenship is in heaven do you know
[2:15:25] in Philippians chapter 3 he said the
[2:15:26] Lord Jesus Christ he said in whom we
[2:15:28] have our conversation it actually means
[2:15:30] citizenship
[2:15:32] we have our citizenship in heaven we are
[2:15:34] citizens of another kingdom that's why
[2:15:36] we talk like we talk
[2:15:38] that's why we believe what we believe we
[2:15:40] got our own language it carries
[2:15:42] continents you can go in Africa and they
[2:15:44] speak same language I do
[2:15:45] right
[2:15:46] it's a faith language
[2:15:50] God starts it when you're baby and the
[2:15:52] message and you first got born he starts
[2:15:54] teaching you little words and after a
[2:15:56] while you start developing the language
[2:15:58] and after a while your words you can
[2:16:01] speak them over situations and breaks
[2:16:04] the power of the enemy
[2:16:05] brother I'll tell you what don't you
[2:16:08] ever let that devil tell you your words
[2:16:09] ain't got power he's trying to he's
[2:16:11] trying to stop a weapon that's what he's
[2:16:13] trying to do but if you'll just remember
[2:16:15] this you have a language of faith and oh
[2:16:19] my goodness I got too much brother Sean
[2:16:21] it's a language of Faith but I'll say
[2:16:23] this to you one thing that's not in our
[2:16:25] language is negative the prophet of God
[2:16:28] said this let your testimony always
[2:16:30] everything never permit a negative
[2:16:32] thought to come in your mind if you can
[2:16:34] help it when it starts that don't
[2:16:37] entertain it
[2:16:41] I can't help the thoughts from coming
[2:16:43] but we'll be like that farmer and they
[2:16:45] can't it couldn't stop him from flying
[2:16:47] over but he sure could stop him from
[2:16:49] roosting
[2:16:50] you can't help a negative thought coming
[2:16:52] but you ain't got to entertain it you
[2:16:54] ain't got to feed it nothing right you
[2:16:56] can let it go on and I believe the
[2:16:58] Church of the Living God can let these
[2:16:59] things go I really believe that from my
[2:17:01] heart when a negative thing comes to my
[2:17:03] mind well you can't you can't there's no
[2:17:05] way you're ever going to make the
[2:17:06] raptures no way you're ever going to be
[2:17:08] able to do this that's a line devil
[2:17:10] that's trying to enter your mind to
[2:17:12] enter your confession to cause your own
[2:17:14] confession to condemn you I tell you
[2:17:16] what Paul said I can do all things
[2:17:17] through Christ Jesus who strengthens me
[2:17:20] amen I don't I don't do that on my own
[2:17:22] I'm not confessing about me amen I'm
[2:17:25] confessing with the blood of Jesus
[2:17:27] Christ did in my life and I've got a
[2:17:29] right to expect fully something to
[2:17:31] change
[2:17:33] Philippians three and three simply our
[2:17:35] conversation in heaven which we also
[2:17:37] look we also look for a savior that word
[2:17:39] look right there actually means to
[2:17:42] expect fully
[2:17:46] to expect fully what is it it's an
[2:17:50] expectation that's built upon something
[2:17:52] that's got faith behind it what is your
[2:17:55] expectation built upon tonight upon the
[2:17:57] word of God
[2:17:58] see Christianity whatever you are is
[2:18:00] built upon Faith now as much Faith as
[2:18:03] we'll be released that's how much power
[2:18:05] that you have
[2:18:07] whenever your face starts being released
[2:18:09] that's where your power is see see what
[2:18:11] we have is the word of God and as we
[2:18:13] spoke last night the word is the seed of
[2:18:16] things coming
[2:18:17] the message is the seed of the Rapture
[2:18:19] and he says Planet into your heart and
[2:18:22] then it will come to pass that's what
[2:18:23] you're going to do plant the word and
[2:18:25] then let the atmosphere come upon it he
[2:18:27] said see see what it is he said the
[2:18:29] gospel is not word only but through
[2:18:31] Power and demonstration of the spirit go
[2:18:33] in the world and demonstrate the power
[2:18:34] he said these signs shall follow them
[2:18:36] believe just teaching the word won't do
[2:18:38] it you've got to have the power of the
[2:18:40] Holy Ghost behind the word to make it
[2:18:43] come to life
[2:18:45] now some of these things were preaching
[2:18:46] they're old some of these promises that
[2:18:49] we're reading from here is from
[2:18:50] Philippians and Thessalonians and
[2:18:51] Corinthians they're over 2 000 years old
[2:18:54] somebody said why are you preaching
[2:18:55] words that are 2 000 years old brother
[2:18:57] bam said because they're seeds so he
[2:19:00] takes us back to the Garners of Joseph
[2:19:01] and says there were seeds back there in
[2:19:03] that Garner he said and those seeds laid
[2:19:06] there but when they discovered it I
[2:19:08] think one place he said it come out of
[2:19:09] the Great Pyramid but they discovered
[2:19:11] the seed and then when they found it
[2:19:13] they planted it and sure enough it came
[2:19:16] to life even if it was 2 000 years old
[2:19:19] so if you'll take the word and you will
[2:19:22] plant it in the right atmosphere it will
[2:19:24] still come to pass exactly what God said
[2:19:28] it would do but that's exactly what we
[2:19:30] need tonight isn't it we need the
[2:19:32] atmosphere to come upon the word we need
[2:19:35] an atmosphere of the Holy Ghost to come
[2:19:38] upon the word that's exactly what will
[2:19:40] change the situation that's exactly what
[2:19:43] will come upon our life Holy Ghost seeds
[2:19:46] of this Bible cannot grow in the
[2:19:48] atmosphere of wisdom
[2:19:50] you'll never get the Bible to grow in
[2:19:53] wisdom
[2:19:55] the Bible only grows in the atmosphere
[2:19:57] of the Holy Ghost
[2:20:00] and somebody said brother Wayne
[2:20:02] what are you trying to say
[2:20:04] well I'm trying to say we've had this
[2:20:06] message now for about 57 years or so
[2:20:09] without the prophet here
[2:20:12] and the things that he spoke is just as
[2:20:14] real today as they were when he spoke
[2:20:17] them
[2:20:18] you've been carrying them around in your
[2:20:20] heart but what we really need is an
[2:20:23] atmosphere to come on what you have been
[2:20:25] taught
[2:20:26] we need the atmosphere to get to a place
[2:20:29] that what you've been taught will come
[2:20:31] to life that it'll live in its anointing
[2:20:34] amen the brother Adam actually says it
[2:20:36] he said it's the attitude of the people
[2:20:38] that brings the results and that's the
[2:20:40] reason Pentecost got in the upper room
[2:20:42] until the Holy Ghost came they got in
[2:20:44] one place in one Accord it's the
[2:20:45] atmosphere that brings the results
[2:20:49] and listen the atmosphere brings the
[2:20:52] results he said preacher what are you
[2:20:54] talking about I just want to say it to
[2:20:55] you like this do you know that there are
[2:20:57] certain germs that can't live in certain
[2:20:59] atmospheres
[2:21:00] they're biologically studying today how
[2:21:03] to stop certain germs just by adjusting
[2:21:06] your thermostat I remember years ago
[2:21:07] when the doctors told my wife he said if
[2:21:09] you keep it a little cooler in your
[2:21:11] house you'll have less problems with
[2:21:13] your kids sicknesses because those germs
[2:21:15] don't like it like that so the
[2:21:18] atmosphere changes what lives in it one
[2:21:22] of the one of the most extreme cases my
[2:21:24] my wife's Aunt sister Donnie she
[2:21:27] actually got a lung disease and they
[2:21:29] kept trying to figure out where the lung
[2:21:31] disease come from but it came from her
[2:21:33] hot water heater her hot water heater
[2:21:35] was set at a little lower temperature
[2:21:36] and there was some some bugs that lacked
[2:21:39] that temperature and every time she took
[2:21:41] a hot shower she was breathing those
[2:21:43] bacteria until they come into her so
[2:21:46] they told her you need to turn up your
[2:21:47] hot water heater and burn them things
[2:21:49] out of there
[2:21:50] well that's a little bit what we're
[2:21:52] talking about
[2:21:53] amen that there is a lukewarm place that
[2:21:55] we can get and there's bacterias that
[2:21:58] live in that lukewarm place and you said
[2:22:00] brother Wayne how do we get rid of this
[2:22:01] condition turn the heat up just turn up
[2:22:05] the heat and watch that devil die you
[2:22:08] don't have to you don't have to take a
[2:22:09] microscope and find ever ever little
[2:22:11] germ floating into place turn the fire
[2:22:14] on watch the Holy Ghost burning the
[2:22:16] church them Devils can't live in the
[2:22:18] fire of God you just start letting the
[2:22:20] Holy Spirit begin to move and things
[2:22:23] will start dying the power of God
[2:22:25] because it's the atmosphere that changes
[2:22:28] the situations it is the atmosphere
[2:22:31] brother Brandon said the atmosphere
[2:22:32] brings results that's what it is
[2:22:34] atmosphere brings it amen the atmosphere
[2:22:37] see Siege can't grow in that kind of
[2:22:40] atmosphere of wisdom atmosphere brings
[2:22:43] we know what we need to do amen this
[2:22:45] word again is put it on the cross he
[2:22:47] said he said we need to produce this
[2:22:49] word again put it not on a cross or on a
[2:22:51] nail but only live atmosphere of the
[2:22:55] Holy Spirit
[2:22:57] put the word on the atmosphere of the
[2:23:00] Holy Spirit it'll bring a result under
[2:23:03] the right atmosphere we'll produce
[2:23:05] exactly what it says it'll do it's got
[2:23:09] to be in the right atmosphere though
[2:23:12] hey if you want an atmosphere for
[2:23:14] healing preach healing
[2:23:16] if you want an atmosphere for salvation
[2:23:18] preach salvation if you want an
[2:23:21] atmosphere for worship preach worship if
[2:23:23] you want an atmosphere for Rapture
[2:23:25] preach Rapture and that's exactly what
[2:23:29] the atmosphere of the church ought to be
[2:23:31] we ought to be an expectation of a
[2:23:34] change just any minute we ought to lay
[2:23:36] and think about these things God is
[2:23:38] under expectation the atmosphere the
[2:23:41] atmosphere of the Holy Ghost brother man
[2:23:42] said here it is he said it'll straighten
[2:23:45] out every one of them spiritual problems
[2:23:47] it's here to heal every sick person
[2:23:49] that's present here but you've got to
[2:23:51] come and get it in the atmosphere and
[2:23:54] the attitude of receiving it what are
[2:23:56] you talking about I'm talking about
[2:23:58] changing Dimensions while we're right
[2:24:00] here I'm not talking about Dimension
[2:24:02] changing only with our physical body
[2:24:04] changes but when the spirit comes the
[2:24:07] dimension changes we're feeling the
[2:24:09] influence of another dimension while
[2:24:11] we're yet right here in this body you
[2:24:13] know what brother bam said about it he
[2:24:15] said you feel you're changing Dimensions
[2:24:17] he said or getting in the spirit when
[2:24:21] you get into the spirit you're changing
[2:24:23] you said preacher what are you lost your
[2:24:25] mind no I lost my mind some people got
[2:24:28] so deep in it until they moved like
[2:24:30] Philip 500 Miles he wasn't the rapturing
[2:24:33] day but he got so in the spirit that the
[2:24:36] spirit could carry the body from one
[2:24:38] place to another then the spirit of God
[2:24:40] can carry you from depression to the joy
[2:24:44] of the Lord it can carry you from a
[2:24:47] weary mind to peace and joy and
[2:24:50] salvation it'll carry you from a cold
[2:24:53] place unto the placing of the sons or
[2:24:56] the baptism of the Holy Ghost we need
[2:24:59] the spirit of God to carry us
[2:25:01] it's all right it's our ride he said
[2:25:04] preacher amen it ain't match your time
[2:25:06] John wasn't either he said but I was
[2:25:08] caught up in the spirit on the Lord's
[2:25:10] day and he traveled 2
[2:25:13] 000 years in time
[2:25:15] [Applause]
[2:25:16] you can travel tonight you could travel
[2:25:20] tonight you could travel to a land you
[2:25:22] could create your own world where the
[2:25:25] sun is shining with the joy of the Lord
[2:25:27] is redeeming where the power of God is
[2:25:29] going you can frame your own world by
[2:25:32] the faith of God
[2:25:35] oh yeah
[2:25:37] the preacher lost your mind I lost my
[2:25:39] mind
[2:25:40] y'all want me y'all want me to let you
[2:25:42] in on something there's no limits in the
[2:25:44] spirit
[2:25:46] hey man there's no limits in the spirit
[2:25:48] of God it's when a little it's when a
[2:25:50] little young man can preach like an old
[2:25:52] man
[2:25:54] come on you somebody said well you
[2:25:55] wander the mystery behind brother Andrew
[2:25:57] Glover's Ministry he said I I myself I
[2:26:00] forget he's 20 year old I listen to him
[2:26:02] preaching get around I think that boy's
[2:26:03] got to be a 50 year old man but he ain't
[2:26:05] he's 20 something years old but I'll
[2:26:07] tell you why he's preaching that way
[2:26:09] because he got carried in the spirit
[2:26:11] to my show brother Wayne why would you
[2:26:13] say that because they might be another
[2:26:14] young man sitting here saying I'd like
[2:26:16] to be a preacher like that well he
[2:26:18] didn't make himself a preacher he got in
[2:26:20] the spirit and the spirit carried him
[2:26:23] into a maturity that intellectualism
[2:26:26] would never take a man in you could
[2:26:28] study psychology and intellectual rest
[2:26:30] of your life and never get there but a
[2:26:33] man give him the spirit of God and it'll
[2:26:35] carry him into Revelation and authority
[2:26:38] and Power by the spirit of knowledge of
[2:26:41] Revelation that's why I don't believe
[2:26:42] there's an age limit on Mark 11 and 20.
[2:26:45] I don't believe it I don't believe that
[2:26:47] there's some age limits I believe it
[2:26:49] said if you say unto this mountain be
[2:26:50] moved I believe it's for you I believe
[2:26:53] it's for you if you can get in the
[2:26:55] spirit of it it'll carry you into an
[2:26:57] authority
[2:26:58] [Applause]

[2:27:02] years he could carry William Branham all
