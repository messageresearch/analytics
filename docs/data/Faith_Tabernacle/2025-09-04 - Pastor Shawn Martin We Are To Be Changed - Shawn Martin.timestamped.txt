[9:39] My heart was distressed and each Jehovah
[9:42] thou strewn and low in the pit where my
[9:47] sins dragged me down. I cried to the
[9:51] Lord from the deep mighty clay who
[9:55] tenderly brought me out to golden day.
[10:01] Oh, he brought me out of the myy clay.
[10:07] He set my feet on a rock to stay.
[10:13] He puts a song in my soul today.
[10:18] A song of praise. Hallelujah.
[10:24] Now he placed me upon the strong rock by
[10:28] your side. My steps were established and
[10:32] here I'll abide. No danger of falling
[10:37] while here I remain but stand by his
[10:42] grace until the crown I gain.
[10:46] Oh he brought me out of the mighty clay.
[10:52] He set my feet on the rock to stay.
[10:58] He puts a song in my soul today.
[11:03] A song of praise. Hallelujah.
[11:07] Yeah. Can we stand now? He gave me a
[11:11] song to a new song of praise. By day and

[12:02] goodness shall see. I'll sing of
[12:05] salvation at home and abroad till many
[12:10] shall hear the truth and trust in God.
[12:15] Oh, and he brought me out of the mighty
[12:20] clay.

[44:13] Christ's name. Amen.
[44:17] Praise the Lord. Uh so, first of all,
[44:21] we'll read uh 1 Corinthians the 15th
[44:24] chapter starting at the 51st verse.
[44:29] But it says, uh, "Behold, I show you a
[44:32] mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we
[44:34] shall all be changed
[44:36] in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,
[44:39] at the last trump. For the trump shall
[44:41] sound, and the dead shall be raised
[44:42] incorruptible,
[44:44] and we shall be changed.
[44:47] For this corruptible must put on
[44:49] incorruption, and this mortal must put
[44:51] on immortality.
[44:54] Then, if you'll go with me to Romans the
[44:56] 15th or the 12th chapter. Romans chapter
[45:01] 12.
[45:02] And we will just read the first
[45:06] two verses.
[45:11] It says, "I beseech you therefore,
[45:14] brethren, by the mercies of God that you
[45:16] present your bodies a living sacrifice,
[45:19] holy, acceptable unto God, which is your
[45:22] reasonable service.
[45:24] And be not conformed to this world, but
[45:27] be ye transformed." Everybody say
[45:30] transformed.
[45:32] by the renewing of your mind that you
[45:35] may prove what is that good and
[45:37] acceptable
[45:39] and perfect will of God. Amen. You can
[45:44] have your seats this evening. And if I
[45:47] were to use the title, it would be we
[45:49] are to be changed.
[45:52] And um
[45:54] I'm I'm glad that we have that promise
[45:58] &gt;&gt; and we're going to be changed in a
[46:00] moment and twinkling of an eye. And the
[46:04] word uh change
[46:08] it. It means to transform to make
[46:12] different to give a different position
[46:16] uh course or direction to. So to
[46:20] transform to make different to give a
[46:23] different position course or direction
[46:25] to now we know that change is not
[46:30] impossible
[46:31] because with God all things are possible
[46:37] &gt;&gt; and if there's anyone that has the
[46:39] ability to change uh the situations and
[46:43] to make change that's God. God has that
[46:47] ability to to change circumstances and
[46:51] he does it through his word through the
[46:54] gospel. Uh Paul would tell us, you know,
[46:58] that uh the gospel is the power of God
[47:02] unto salvation to them that believe. And
[47:05] and so the gospel is the word. It's the
[47:10] uh word made alive, living power. And so
[47:15] uh thinking of this power uh brother
[47:19] Brandon would call it the power of
[47:21] transformation.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; So we preach the gospel so that lives
[47:26] can be changed. Every one of us. Um the
[47:29] gospel should mean something to us. It
[47:33] uh uh the gospel uh has the power. It
[47:36] changes the sinner from the saint. It
[47:39] changes a drunk man to a sober man. It
[47:43] it changes uh um uh the sick uh uh uh to
[47:50] being well. It it's it changes and and
[47:53] and
[47:55] that's that's that's the gospel. And so
[47:58] it it it's to transform. And and this is
[48:03] what Paul is saying. Be ye transformed
[48:07] by the renewing of your mind. And and to
[48:10] transform something is to change it.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; In other words, be changed. Amen. If
[48:16] you're going to be transformed, then
[48:18] then he's calling to be changed. And so
[48:21] so in our opening scripture, Paul spoke
[48:24] of the changing of our body. And I'm so
[48:28] glad that we have that promise
[48:30] &gt;&gt; uh that that we're going to be changed
[48:33] um uh there. And so our bodies are going
[48:35] to be changed from mortal to
[48:37] immortality.
[48:39] Um uh the old is going to give way and
[48:45] the youth is going to be uh back again.
[48:49] The the gray hairs are going to be
[48:51] changed back to its original color. the
[48:55] crippled up limbs are going to be
[48:56] changed and and straightened and and uh
[49:01] uh all the effects of the the old age
[49:05] and and what comes with it, all that's
[49:07] going to be changed. Amen. And and I'm
[49:10] sure that as believers, we're all
[49:13] looking forward to that time. I I
[49:15] certainly am looking forward to the the
[49:18] change of of that. But that's not when
[49:22] our change begins.
[49:24] uh uh that is actually the finale of the
[49:29] change and so the changing of our body
[49:32] will be the final process and and it
[49:35] will be a very actually be a very small
[49:37] step uh to to the change that uh uh we
[49:43] we are experiencing and yes we are
[49:45] waiting for the changing of our body but
[49:48] yet the change is is actually happening
[49:52] now. Uh and and this is what Paul is
[49:55] talking about it to be transformed or
[49:59] changed by the renewing of our mind. And
[50:03] and and so we we we we not to to look
[50:10] and and say, "Well, one of these days I
[50:12] will be changed and I'm looking for that
[50:14] change." Well, the change must be
[50:16] happening even this present moment. And
[50:20] he's not just talking about changing
[50:22] from sinner to a saint. Uh uh I I hope
[50:27] that and you know and pray that we've
[50:28] all been there that we've all changed uh
[50:32] uh from a sinner to the saint. But the
[50:34] prophet as he's talking about that
[50:36] scripture, he says, "Now we have been
[50:39] saved as we are." Now that we have been
[50:41] saved as we are and that we have been
[50:44] filled with the Holy Spirit as we have,
[50:47] now we want the mind that was in Christ
[50:51] to be in us that we might be transformed
[50:56] from the natural things of life and be
[51:00] brought in to do the perfect will of God
[51:04] by transformation of God's spirit by his
[51:08] word. Amen. So, so, so I'm thankful to
[51:11] be saved. I'm thankful to have the the
[51:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost, but the
[51:16] change is still happening. It's a the
[51:19] transformation is still taking taking
[51:22] place. Now, we can look at nature and
[51:26] and see what Paul is is speaking of by
[51:29] being changed and and to understand what
[51:33] this transformation is like. and and and
[51:37] uh uh example it would be a a tadpo
[51:42] uh you know a little old uh uh creature,
[51:46] you know, uh swimming in the water and
[51:48] it's got a a heads got a little tail. It
[51:51] looks like a catfish and uh uh you know
[51:55] and it and it's it's it's it's abiding
[51:57] its time. It's it's waiting for the
[52:00] changing. But then then after a while
[52:03] something takes place. it loses its tail
[52:07] and and it takes on a transformation
[52:10] and and he's changed from a tadpole to a
[52:13] frog. Ain't that right? So, the prophet
[52:16] said he's transformed from one species
[52:19] to to another. And and this would tell
[52:22] us and that that the change that Paul is
[52:25] talking about this transformation
[52:28] isn't taking us backwards.
[52:31] It's actually taking us forward. It's a
[52:34] it's a process. It's a progress that
[52:37] that that we're going through a
[52:39] development. But it's it's a
[52:42] transformation. Ain't that right? And
[52:44] and so uh and and to think of this by
[52:48] the power of transformation, it it gives
[52:51] us a past. Amen. uh um u and and we
[52:57] could all look and and and say, "Well, I
[53:00] was a sinner, but I'm not that way now.
[53:04] I I was this, but I'm not that way now."
[53:08] Because the power of transformation uh
[53:10] uh something took place. And so, we can
[53:13] actually look back and we're not that as
[53:16] as present, but that is past. It's it's
[53:20] done away and we've moved on and and
[53:23] into a a a the present tense. Ain't that
[53:26] right? Uh this word past means no longer
[53:30] current. It's gone by. It's over. Ain't
[53:33] that right? So we sing songs, you know,
[53:35] like my chains are gone. Amen. and uh
[53:39] you know uh I'm no longer a slave to
[53:43] fear and uh you know uh uh different
[53:47] songs uh such as that. You may ask me,
[53:50] you know, uh why I'm happy. I'll tell
[53:52] you why. My sins are gone. Amen. So, so
[53:56] we we actually can write songs about
[54:00] what we used to be and say that's not
[54:03] what we are today. Amen. because it's a
[54:07] uh it's an experience that we have uh uh
[54:11] gone through by the power of
[54:14] transformation.
[54:15] Another example is the caterpillar. You
[54:18] know, you see that little caterpillar,
[54:20] you know, crawling around on the ground
[54:22] and and all that and and and to look at
[54:26] that caterpillar, you would never know
[54:28] by the outward. There's nothing about
[54:31] that caterpillar that that tells us
[54:34] about its future and that it's going to
[54:37] fly one of these days. But it has
[54:40] something within it, a law. Amen. That
[54:44] that it goes through a transformation
[54:48] uh to where that that when it comes out
[54:50] of its cocoon, it it is a butterfly.
[54:54] Amen. So what what used to just crawl
[54:57] around on on the dirt and get stepped on
[55:00] or or whatever or have to worry about
[55:02] all that of getting stepped on uh uh no
[55:05] longer because there's been a
[55:07] transformation.
[55:08] Amen. God would God would make nature uh
[55:12] uh things in nature that way to to
[55:14] testify of the transforming power that
[55:18] Christians uh uh uh will experience or
[55:22] are experiencing. Ain't that right? and
[55:24] and so um then then we find that it's
[55:28] the same caterpillar. Amen. But it's
[55:31] been transformed. So the power of
[55:33] transformation
[55:35] uh doesn't replace us. It it's not a
[55:39] replacement. It's not taking something
[55:42] and replacing it with another. Amen. But
[55:45] uh uh it's a transformation just like
[55:47] when our body amen is changed. um uh uh
[55:52] those that are left here for the
[55:55] tribulation, they they you know, the
[55:57] prophet said they'll not find our bones.
[56:00] They'll not find hide or hair. They'll
[56:02] not find any part of us because uh our
[56:06] we've been transformed. Amen. We're not
[56:09] just leaving our body here to rot and we
[56:12] go to another body. Amen. But but we are
[56:16] transformed. The the body is to be
[56:18] changed. a transformation is going to
[56:22] take place. Can you say amen? And so
[56:24] this terrestrial body will take on a
[56:27] celestial body and and the the
[56:30] transformation will take place in a
[56:32] moment of time. And so the change comes
[56:36] by transformation
[56:38] which is uh um uh what Webster I believe
[56:42] says a metamorphosis.
[56:45] a metamorphosis and and that means a a
[56:49] change of physical form, structure, or
[56:52] substance, especially by supernatural
[56:54] means. A striking altercation in
[56:58] appearance, character, or circumstances.
[57:00] See, it's it's just a change, right? a a
[57:03] typically marked or and more or less
[57:06] abrupt developmental change in the form
[57:10] or structure of an animal such as
[57:12] butterfly, frog or whatever see
[57:15] occurring subsequent to birth or
[57:17] hatching. See, so so this this
[57:20] transformation is a metamorphosis or uh
[57:23] there and it's the same creature, it's
[57:26] the same life, but it's been changed
[57:29] from one thing to another. Ain't that
[57:32] right? Amen. A change. And so, Brother
[57:36] Bram tells us that's what's going to
[57:37] happen to the heavens and and the earth,
[57:40] you know, u uh uh second Peter 3 and 10.
[57:45] It says, "But the day of the Lord will
[57:48] come as a thief in the night, and in the
[57:51] he in which the heavens shall pass away
[57:53] with a great noise, and the element
[57:56] shall melt with fervent heat, and the
[57:59] earth also, and the works that are
[58:01] therein shall be burned up." See, and
[58:04] and and and so it's going to pass away.
[58:07] Heavens and earth pass away. And uh uh
[58:10] John in Revelations 21 and1 and I saw a
[58:13] new heaven and a new earth for the first
[58:17] heaven and the first earth were passed
[58:19] away and there were no more sea. Ain't
[58:22] that right? And the prophet said it
[58:24] looks like an a total complete
[58:26] annihilation
[58:28] but it's not. It it's it's not that. And
[58:31] I I I uh you know how blessed we are to
[58:34] have a prophet to be able to tell us
[58:36] these things that of of the mysteries of
[58:39] of these things. And uh but the word
[58:42] passway actually uh there it means
[58:45] change from one form to another.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Changed. Amen. From one form to another.
[58:52] Change from one condition to another or
[58:56] pass from one thing to another. In other
[58:59] words, transformed. Ain't that right?
[59:02] What what you was is no longer. It's
[59:05] it's still there. It's still the same
[59:07] thing. Amen. But it's been changed to
[59:11] something else. Amen. It's it another
[59:14] condition or or whatever. It's just like
[59:16] Lazarus uh when when Jesus called
[59:19] Lazarus to come forth from the grave and
[59:21] there he was with all the grave clothes
[59:24] on. He was bound and and Jesus told
[59:26] them, "Loose him." and let him go. Ain't
[59:30] that right? Well, the the the prophet
[59:32] said that's that's the same word for
[59:34] pass away. Loose him and let him go. He
[59:38] was bound, but now he's free. Amen. He's
[59:41] changed from one thing to another, one
[59:44] condition to another. Ain't that right?
[59:46] And so he says the earth is going to be
[59:49] loosed from Satan's grip. Amen. See,
[59:53] it'll be loose from politics. It'll be
[59:56] loose from denominations,
[59:58] uh, religious systems, and all of that.
[1:00:01] Amen. See, it's it's it's it's just a
[1:00:04] passing away. Uh, Brother Bram tells us
[1:00:07] that Satan is the ruler of of the earth,
[1:00:10] and he owns it for it belong to him. But
[1:00:13] now, Christ has redeemed it.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that? Christ has
[1:00:19] legally uh he's paid the price. He
[1:00:22] legally owns it now. Amen. And and the
[1:00:25] prophet says, see, Satan and sinners are
[1:00:28] to be gone uh for eternity, never no
[1:00:31] more to be. Satan cannot create. If he
[1:00:34] is, he's God. He can only pervert what
[1:00:37] has been created. And all perversion
[1:00:40] will be done away with. And death is the
[1:00:44] pervertage of life. And when the
[1:00:48] perversion is done, there can be no more
[1:00:50] death. Old age is a sign of death. And
[1:00:53] when old age has gone away, life comes
[1:00:56] in.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So all perversion,
[1:01:00] signs, and everything else is gone.
[1:01:02] Thorns and thistles is a sign of sin.
[1:01:05] The earth will be cursed with them. And
[1:01:07] and now they're done away with. See, it
[1:01:10] will be done away with. Sickness come by
[1:01:12] sin. See, a curse, but uh it'll be done
[1:01:16] away with. Death will be done away with.
[1:01:18] The bloodshed will be done away with.
[1:01:21] Aren't you glad for that? Another place,
[1:01:23] brother Bram said, when the holy fire of
[1:01:25] God sterilizes the earth with uh the
[1:01:28] chemicals, he has lifted his bride which
[1:01:31] can come into heaven with him while this
[1:01:34] is going on and comes back. The bride
[1:01:37] comes back on earth again. A new heaven
[1:01:40] and a new earth. Amen. Cold winter can't
[1:01:44] hurt it. The hot summers can't hurt it.
[1:01:47] The the the deserts will blossom as a
[1:01:50] rose. Sin and sinners are gone. God and
[1:01:54] his creatures and creation is dwelling
[1:01:57] together in perfect harmony. As the
[1:01:59] heavens and the earth is husband and
[1:02:02] wife, so is Christ and the church. And
[1:02:04] they all meet in one big glorious plan
[1:02:08] of redemption and is brought right back
[1:02:11] into the bosom of God again. Ain't that
[1:02:14] right? What is it? A transformation
[1:02:17] has taken place. Amen. A transformation.
[1:02:21] See? And so, but before that
[1:02:24] transformation of the heavens and the
[1:02:26] earth can take place, there has to be a
[1:02:30] transformation
[1:02:31] happen in the people of God. Amen. Uh
[1:02:35] and that's by the renewing of our mind.
[1:02:38] Notice what the prophet said. The things
[1:02:40] now I want you to notice. Amen. Now,
[1:02:42] listen. We are to be transformed.
[1:02:45] transformed. We're We're going to a a
[1:02:47] city. We're going to a place that's been
[1:02:49] transformed. We're not going to live in
[1:02:52] an old place, but the past will be gone.
[1:02:54] Old things are passed away. Ain't that
[1:02:56] right? And all things become new. But
[1:02:59] notice the things that you once thought
[1:03:02] upon to be precious, lay that aside and
[1:03:06] be transformed to something else.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, sinners have sinners
[1:03:14] thoughts. Christians have Christian
[1:03:16] thoughts. Sinner has a has a sinner
[1:03:19] life. Christian has a a Christian life.
[1:03:21] Ain't that right? Amen. And and and you
[1:03:24] can't blame them. Amen. There's got to
[1:03:27] be a transformation.
[1:03:29] Amen. See, and so why would God save us
[1:03:31] out of sin only to talk dirty jokes and
[1:03:34] and to keep hanging out with the filth
[1:03:36] and the the things of the world? Amen.
[1:03:39] There has to be a cutting off, a
[1:03:41] transformation. So if we're going to be
[1:03:44] transformed, then you've got to Amen.
[1:03:47] the things that you once thought upon to
[1:03:49] be precious, lay that aside and be
[1:03:52] transformed to something else. How many
[1:03:54] wants to be transformed to something
[1:03:56] else? Amen. I want to be transformed to
[1:03:58] something else. Amen. I don't want to
[1:04:01] be, you know, like these unconverted
[1:04:03] church members. Amen. that that claim
[1:04:06] Christ and yet their minds out in the
[1:04:08] sport world or uh their their heads in
[1:04:10] the television and and the movies and
[1:04:13] the entertainments and you can't tell
[1:04:15] any difference between them. There's got
[1:04:18] to be a transformation that takes place.
[1:04:21] Amen. So be transformed to something
[1:04:24] else. What you was one uh what you was
[1:04:28] one time to what you are now. See? Amen.
[1:04:31] We always, as the prophet said, we never
[1:04:33] want to look back in the rear view
[1:04:36] mirror. We want to keep pressing on,
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; pressing on. Can you say amen? So many
[1:04:41] people want to stay behind with Luther,
[1:04:43] but we got to keep pressing on. Amen.
[1:04:46] Wesley was great. Pentecost was great,
[1:04:48] but we got to keep pressing on.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, by the renewing of your mind,
[1:04:57] that you might prove that good and
[1:04:58] acceptable and perfect will of God. Oh,
[1:05:01] that's what we all want to know, how to
[1:05:04] do it. We are here. We love him. See, he
[1:05:07] saved us. And now we want to know what
[1:05:08] to do. Notice what he says. And we're
[1:05:11] trying to take a little step this
[1:05:13] morning to raise up just a little bit
[1:05:16] higher. Every day we want to go up
[1:05:18] higher. Can you say amen? We we we that
[1:05:22] that's that's every Christian, every
[1:05:24] believer, every person that's part of
[1:05:26] the bride. Amen. Their desire is to come
[1:05:29] up higher. Amen. And the only way we can
[1:05:31] do that is by transformation.
[1:05:34] The power of transformation. Now, God is
[1:05:38] not seeking to replace us for he can't.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; He cannot replace us. Amen. See, in
[1:05:48] order uh uh uh uh you know uh uh uh the
[1:05:53] prophet says no one can take our place.
[1:05:57] Ain't that right? Amen. He can't take he
[1:05:59] can't replace us then. And so he's not
[1:06:02] seeking to replace us. Now notice in
[1:06:05] order for for transformation to take
[1:06:08] place, there has to be a seed. Ain't
[1:06:10] that right? There has to be a seed in
[1:06:12] order for transformation Amen. to take
[1:06:16] to take place. Well, we are the gene
[1:06:19] seed of God.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; How many believes that
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; we are a gene seed of God, not by our
[1:06:24] choice, but because we're part of God.
[1:06:27] God is eternal. And if God is eternal,
[1:06:29] then we're a part of God. Then we've got
[1:06:32] an eternal something about us.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen. That eternal
[1:06:38] equality about us. Amen. and and and
[1:06:41] it's an attribute of God which means
[1:06:44] that we are predestinated.
[1:06:46] Everybody say, "I'm predestinated.
[1:06:49] I am predestinated." If I'm a gene seed
[1:06:51] of God, I'm predestinated. You're
[1:06:53] predestinated. Well, then what is that?
[1:06:56] Then what makes us that way? Uh uh uh
[1:06:59] what are we predestinated? Well, uh uh
[1:07:01] uh well, we're predestinated to be sons
[1:07:04] and daughters of God. How many believes
[1:07:06] that? Amen. We're predestinated, Amen.
[1:07:09] to the adoption of sons. As as the Bible
[1:07:12] says, we're predestinated to be holy and
[1:07:15] without blame before him in love. We're
[1:07:19] we're predestinated to be the bride of
[1:07:22] Jesus Christ. Ain't that right? Amen. So
[1:07:25] then then if we're predestinated, Amen.
[1:07:28] to these things, then nobody can take
[1:07:30] our place. Amen. No one. The devil can't
[1:07:34] make anyone, Amen. The devil can't mar
[1:07:37] us and and scar us and and and and and
[1:07:40] uh so bad to where God doesn't want us.
[1:07:43] Amen. That's not it at all. Amen. If God
[1:07:46] ever called you, it's over. It's done.
[1:07:49] You're going to come to it. Ain't that
[1:07:51] right? Amen. Now, if if you say, "Well,
[1:07:54] you know, then that that gives me a
[1:07:56] chance to do whatever I want to." Well,
[1:07:58] Brother Brandham says, "Well, if you're
[1:07:59] that way, you haven't made that yet. You
[1:08:01] haven't you haven't connected with God
[1:08:03] yet." Because when you connect with God,
[1:08:05] you don't want to sin. You don't want to
[1:08:07] go out in them in in the honky tonks and
[1:08:09] and all of these things. Ain't that
[1:08:11] right? Now notice, we are predestinated.
[1:08:14] And and God would show through types and
[1:08:16] shadows of what we as the bride. Well,
[1:08:19] let me ask you, how many believe that
[1:08:21] your bride?
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; You believe your bride. Amen. Well, I
[1:08:25] want some hands. Amen. You You believe
[1:08:27] your bride? Amen. Well, then what does
[1:08:30] that mean then? Well, God would show us
[1:08:33] in the beginning when he made a man and
[1:08:35] woman exactly what he would do for
[1:08:38] himself as the as the groom and and and
[1:08:42] what we are as the bride. Amen. When God
[1:08:45] God took made man and then he takes
[1:08:48] woman out of man. Amen. And when man
[1:08:51] first sees woman, he says, "This is
[1:08:54] flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone." Can
[1:08:57] you say amen? She shall be called woman,
[1:09:00] for she was taken out of man. Ain't that
[1:09:03] right? Well, think of this as the
[1:09:05] prophet would tell us. We are to be
[1:09:07] flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone,
[1:09:12] life of his life, power of his power.
[1:09:16] Can you say amen? Amen. Just as Eve was
[1:09:19] to Adam, so are we. But brother Brandon
[1:09:22] would ask the question, how is this
[1:09:24] mortal flesh going to become his flesh?
[1:09:28] Now, think of that. That's a good
[1:09:29] question. Ain't that right? How is this
[1:09:32] flesh, mortal flesh, going to become his
[1:09:34] flesh? Well, he gives the answer as Paul
[1:09:38] would. Amen. In Romans 8:11, but if the
[1:09:41] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[1:09:44] the dead dwell in you, it he that raised
[1:09:48] up Christ from the dead shall also
[1:09:51] quicken your mortal bodies by uh by his
[1:09:55] spirit that dwelleth in you. Can you say
[1:09:57] amen? See, so the power of
[1:10:00] transformation, God's not considering
[1:10:03] the scars. God's not considering the
[1:10:05] past. God's not considering how bad we
[1:10:08] were and are or our mistakes and our
[1:10:10] failures. That's not the point. Amen.
[1:10:14] There is a power of transformation
[1:10:17] that can change that whole situation and
[1:10:21] make you a child of God. Can you say
[1:10:24] amen? Amen. Now the prophet says we did
[1:10:28] not become seed by rebirth. Amen. We
[1:10:31] were seed and therefore were reborn for
[1:10:35] only the elect can be reborn. Because we
[1:10:39] were seed is the reason we could be
[1:10:42] quickened. Ain't that right? In nonseed
[1:10:45] there is nothing to quicken. So the
[1:10:47] rocks aren't quickened. The sand ain't
[1:10:50] quickened. The dirt even isn't
[1:10:52] quickened. It's the seed that is
[1:10:56] quickened. Ain't that right? The seed.
[1:10:59] Amen. Uh uh and the seed is what is
[1:11:03] predestinated.
[1:11:04] Amen. To be Now, in the beginning, God
[1:11:08] said, "Let there be."
[1:11:10] You know, Abraham said, "Maybe God said,
[1:11:12] "Let there be an oak tree. Let there be
[1:11:15] a a a pine tree. Let let there let there
[1:11:19] be a a pecan tree." and and and he
[1:11:23] started naming amen that that you know
[1:11:26] all of these things. Let there be a
[1:11:27] cactus and and then he makes all kinds
[1:11:29] of different cactuses and and let there
[1:11:32] be a certain flower and the aelia and
[1:11:35] and all of these things. See? Well, see
[1:11:38] the seed is Godspoken word. Do you
[1:11:41] believe that? And so whatever God
[1:11:44] ordained that seed to be, that's what
[1:11:47] it's going to be. Amen. It's it's God's
[1:11:51] spoken word. God ordained it. God called
[1:11:54] it. Amen. And then he puts the seed in
[1:11:56] the ground. Amen. See, and and and God
[1:12:00] didn't place all those seeds in one
[1:12:01] place in the ground. He he he put it all
[1:12:05] over the earth. Amen. He put seeds all
[1:12:08] over all over the earth. Ain't that
[1:12:11] right? Wherever he desired. And prophet
[1:12:14] talks about how that you know there's
[1:12:16] some seeds can't grow in certain
[1:12:19] grounds. Um uh like like in the desert
[1:12:22] you got the cactuses and and then he
[1:12:24] says you know 20 you go about 30 minutes
[1:12:27] up the mountain and and you'll find the
[1:12:29] Sherman pine and and all that. And he
[1:12:32] and he talks he says there it took an
[1:12:34] intelligence to place all of the seeds
[1:12:37] where it should go. it it there would be
[1:12:41] no point in in in commanding a seed to
[1:12:44] become and then place it in the wrong
[1:12:47] dirt or the wrong atmosphere or or
[1:12:50] whatever. See, and and then it never
[1:12:53] grows. So God by his intelligence placed
[1:12:56] the seeds wherever he would he wanted it
[1:12:59] and where it would it would grow. It it
[1:13:02] would do. Ain't that right? Well, if God
[1:13:05] would do that to the natural seed, then
[1:13:07] he would do that to a spiritual seed as
[1:13:10] well. Amen. He said that he will have
[1:13:14] sons and daughters by his word. Do you
[1:13:18] believe that? He said, he promised that
[1:13:21] he would have sons and daughters of his.
[1:13:23] He said that he would have a bride
[1:13:26] without spot, wrinkle, or blemish. Amen.
[1:13:29] That's a seed. Amen. by his word
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; said that there would be an overcomer
[1:13:35] who would reign with him. Amen. This
[1:13:38] isn't by chance. This is a promise.
[1:13:41] These are seeds that God by his spoken
[1:13:44] word ordained to to to be. Ain't that
[1:13:47] right? Amen. And what God said it's
[1:13:51] going to happen.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; What God said will happen. Amen. In
[1:13:58] Noah's day. Amen. God God said told them
[1:14:02] it's going to rain. He told the people
[1:14:03] it was a scientific age. Amen. Like it
[1:14:06] is today. And but he told the people
[1:14:08] it's going to rain. And and the people
[1:14:11] by science could could shoot something
[1:14:14] up in the air and they could prove it.
[1:14:16] They prove that there was no moisture up
[1:14:19] there. There was no rain. It was
[1:14:21] impossible for it to rain. Amen. See,
[1:14:24] but see, it came down anyways
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; because God said it would. A ain't that
[1:14:31] right? Amen. The rain came anyways.
[1:14:34] Despite uh what they would prove and
[1:14:37] what they would say and and all of these
[1:14:40] things, God has said that in this last
[1:14:42] day, fire will come from heaven. Amen.
[1:14:45] Now, they say that'll never happen.
[1:14:46] There ain't nothing up there for that to
[1:14:48] happen. Amen. and see. But the prophet
[1:14:51] says it's going to fall just as God
[1:14:54] promised it. Can you say amen? He said,
[1:14:57] "See, that seed will take a hold
[1:14:59] somewhere." That seed's going to take a
[1:15:01] hold somewhere. Glory to God. And the
[1:15:04] only thing he's looking for today is a
[1:15:06] bedding ground. Everybody say, "A
[1:15:08] bedding ground." A bedding ground.
[1:15:11] Somewhere that it can bed. Amen. See?
[1:15:15] Amen. So, so now in in in in another
[1:15:19] place he says, "Now let the word start
[1:15:21] in somebody and they'll pervert it and
[1:15:24] spray it like Satan did Eve." It started
[1:15:27] in Eve for her to bed forth and bring
[1:15:30] forth sons of God, not sons of Satan,
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Sons of God. But she was a bedding
[1:15:37] ground and it fell in the wrong place.
[1:15:41] So will the word fall in an unbeliever
[1:15:44] or a doubter or a skeptic. It'll make a
[1:15:47] church member out of them, but never a
[1:15:50] son or daughter of God.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; In other words, that seed can never come
[1:15:56] to transformation.
[1:15:58] Amen. Uh be transformed in an
[1:16:01] unbeliever, in a skeptic, in in in just
[1:16:04] a an unbeliever. See? Amen. See? So he
[1:16:08] says, "You tell them let their hair to
[1:16:10] let their hair grow, they'll laugh in
[1:16:12] your face. You tell them to do this,
[1:16:14] that, or the man do it." Amen. They'll
[1:16:17] laugh in your face. It's not sons of
[1:16:19] God. It's the wrong bedding ground.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; See? Yet they're holding the seed.
[1:16:24] They're holding the word. See? Amen. See
[1:16:26] the false anointed ones. They're
[1:16:28] anointed, yes, with the Holy Spirit.
[1:16:30] Speak in tongues, do signs and wonders,
[1:16:32] but it's of Satan. Ain't that right?
[1:16:35] Another place, brother Bram says, when
[1:16:37] you try to take the word of God and put
[1:16:39] it in religion of this world, you bring
[1:16:42] death to yourself. It kills the subject.
[1:16:46] Amen. That's right. It kills the life.
[1:16:48] See? See? You see what I mean? It kills
[1:16:50] the person. It uh you say, "Well, now
[1:16:53] look, you you believe in God and and oh,
[1:16:56] now you don't have to believe in that.
[1:16:59] See, you you our church. See, right
[1:17:02] then. See, that's the boom that kills
[1:17:04] the subject. You've got to let notice
[1:17:07] what he says. You've got to let
[1:17:08] everything fall aside. Amen. And take
[1:17:11] the word only.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; You got to let everything else fall
[1:17:16] aside and take the word only.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Let your your your feelings aside and
[1:17:22] take the word. Let the symptoms aside
[1:17:25] and take the word. Let go of the
[1:17:27] critics, what they're saying, and take
[1:17:29] the word. Don't listen to critics. Don't
[1:17:31] listen to anything outside the word of
[1:17:34] God. Take the word only. Can you say
[1:17:36] amen? You got to let everything fall
[1:17:38] aside and take that word only. Stay
[1:17:42] right with the word. Don't leave it when
[1:17:45] God said, "So, that's just what it is."
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So God plants the
[1:17:51] seeds and then every seed has to be
[1:17:55] transformed
[1:17:56] in in in into the plant life. Amen. For
[1:18:00] God says, "Let every seed bring forth of
[1:18:04] its kind."
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Got to bring forth. So
[1:18:08] the seed was planted by God. And now
[1:18:12] it's got to have a transformation take
[1:18:15] place to bring on the manifestation of
[1:18:19] what God called that seed to be. He
[1:18:22] planted seeds, but he didn't intend for
[1:18:24] it to remain seed in the ground. He
[1:18:27] wanted something to come up. He wanted a
[1:18:30] an oak tree to come up. He wanted an
[1:18:32] apple tree to come up and bear apples
[1:18:35] and an orange tree to come up and bear
[1:18:37] oranges and and all of these things. But
[1:18:40] it happens by transformation.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; So, so uh uh the seed, amen, planted by
[1:18:51] God's word and then has to come to
[1:18:53] manifestation. And that's why, amen, the
[1:18:56] Bible says the whole earth is groaning,
[1:18:59] travailing, waiting for the
[1:19:01] manifestation of the sons of God.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; There's a seed that's been planted.
[1:19:08] That's right. seed to bring forth sons
[1:19:10] of God.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. See? Amen. So again, God never
[1:19:16] intended for it to remain in seed form,
[1:19:19] but to be transformed.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says the seed can only come
[1:19:23] forth with the power of life within it.
[1:19:27] Aren't you glad you have that?
[1:19:30] to transform it from a seed to a plant
[1:19:33] or whatever it was, it had to come forth
[1:19:37] with the power of life in it.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; The power of life is in you.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; How many believes that?
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Power of life is in you.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Now, the earth is the womb that God
[1:19:51] planted the seed in.
[1:19:54] and and he placed each seed in the womb
[1:19:58] uh uh with the potentials that it would
[1:20:00] be what he said it would be. See, and
[1:20:03] and each one of these seeds has the
[1:20:06] power within itself to transform itself
[1:20:11] into the species that God uh uh called
[1:20:16] it to be.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; He put that power of life within it.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so God says, you know, that's
[1:20:25] what it must be. See, because I have
[1:20:28] given every seed transforming power.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad to be seed?
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Seed of God. Amen. I've given every
[1:20:37] seed, Amen. Uh uh transforming power to
[1:20:42] make out of itself it its potentials now
[1:20:47] to make out of itself exactly what I
[1:20:50] want it to be. You're not a helpless
[1:20:52] church. We're not a helpless people. I I
[1:20:56] you know, we just not. If the power is
[1:21:00] within us, that power of life, then the
[1:21:03] transforming power is already there, the
[1:21:07] potentials to be what God has called us
[1:21:09] to be.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, the prophet said, "As long as
[1:21:12] it stayed in its right category, it
[1:21:16] would be just exactly what God said it
[1:21:19] would be." So it couldn't be mixed with
[1:21:22] anything else. Couldn't be hybrid. This
[1:21:24] is why brother Brown was such against
[1:21:26] you know screamed out against
[1:21:28] hybridization and all of these things
[1:21:30] because what usually in the natural
[1:21:32] happens in the spiritual but but we know
[1:21:35] hybriding is what kills. It's it it's
[1:21:37] what makes humans weak and and and a lot
[1:21:41] of defens deficiencies within our body
[1:21:44] and and the sicknesses that that uh uh
[1:21:47] that man struggles with. A lot of it is
[1:21:50] because of the the the hybriding that
[1:21:52] that we have done uh we we just messed
[1:21:55] with God's laboratory and all of these
[1:21:58] things. Ain't that right? Amen. But but
[1:22:01] for it to to to have transforming power,
[1:22:04] hybrid corn cannot reproduce itself.
[1:22:07] Amen. But an original corn has the
[1:22:11] transforming power within it. Amen. To
[1:22:14] go from seed, Amen. to uh to maturity.
[1:22:18] Ain't that right? So, Brother Bram said
[1:22:21] it had to be that way because he made it
[1:22:23] that way and made a channel that
[1:22:26] anything that stays in his channel, in
[1:22:29] his line of word, ain't that right, in
[1:22:32] his line of word, as the prophet said,
[1:22:34] God never did make a a donkey, right? Or
[1:22:37] a mule. It's a mule, right? See, it
[1:22:40] didn't stay in the line of word. It's
[1:22:42] it's not any it's a hybrid. They taken a
[1:22:45] donkey and a horse and made a mule. It's
[1:22:47] a hybrid. It can't reproduce itself.
[1:22:50] It's not in the line of God's word.
[1:22:53] Ain't that right? See, and any religion,
[1:22:56] anything that's hybrid is not in the
[1:22:59] line of God's word. It's It's got to
[1:23:01] stay in the channel of God's word, it
[1:23:05] will have to bring forth exactly like
[1:23:07] his word said it would. It cannot move
[1:23:09] from there. It's channelneled just
[1:23:12] exactly right.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Yeah.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; So, not to keep you much longer, but in
[1:23:18] Genesis 1 and1,
[1:23:21] uh,
[1:23:23] it says that in the beginning, God
[1:23:25] created the heaven and the earth. The
[1:23:28] earth was without form
[1:23:31] and void, and darkness was upon the face
[1:23:33] of the deep.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet looking at that, he
[1:23:37] said it was nothing but a complete
[1:23:40] chaos.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, it was
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; nothing but complete chaos. Ain't that
[1:23:45] right?
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; But notice what God did in in that
[1:23:49] condition. When it was in that condition
[1:23:52] and the spirit of God moved.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Everybody say, "The spirit of God
[1:23:57] moved."
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; The spirit of God moved upon the face of
[1:24:02] the waters. And God said, "Let there be
[1:24:06] light." And there was light. And God saw
[1:24:09] the light that it was good. And God
[1:24:12] divided the light from the darkness.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says, "And the entire
[1:24:18] picture was changed,
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; transformed."
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; It w it went from a picture or a
[1:24:25] situation of chaos to a beautiful garden
[1:24:29] of Eden.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; God brought forth a transformation.
[1:24:35] So God knew that he needed light.
[1:24:41] in order for the seeds to live.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; He had already planted the seeds and
[1:24:46] there was the darkness that had covered
[1:24:48] the earth and and and and uh uh and and
[1:24:53] so that power of darkness was holding
[1:24:56] that sea to where it couldn't be
[1:24:58] transformed into what God wanted to be.
[1:25:02] Now, we know as the prophet deals with
[1:25:05] it, light is the manifestation of God's
[1:25:08] spoken word.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; God said, "Let there be light." And
[1:25:12] there it was.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; That was the manifestation of God's
[1:25:18] spoken word. Ain't that right? Anytime
[1:25:20] God's word is manifested, that's light.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So therefore, God
[1:25:29] brought light to bring on a a
[1:25:32] transformation. The Bible says that God
[1:25:35] separated the light from the darkness.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. What was he doing? He making a way
[1:25:43] to where that light could shine in its
[1:25:46] full strength upon that seed to bring a
[1:25:51] transformation.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? That's how he's going
[1:25:56] to change the chaos,
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; all this chaos and all that. But there
[1:26:01] would be a light that would transform
[1:26:03] those seeds and make it a beautiful
[1:26:05] garden.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Make it a beautiful Eden. Ain't that
[1:26:08] right?
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; See, and when light shines, darkness has
[1:26:12] to give way.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; When light shines, that's why you walk
[1:26:17] in the light. Stay in the light.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Don't don't fellowship in
[1:26:24] darkness.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; That's why John says if we walk in the
[1:26:28] light as he is in the light, then we
[1:26:29] have fellowship with one another.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; You know, I'm finding that that that
[1:26:33] that these people that have left the
[1:26:35] message, you know, that instead of just
[1:26:37] walking away from the message, they're
[1:26:38] doing everything they can to find the
[1:26:40] weak ones and to pull them out. Oh,
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; yeah.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; You know, and and and and uh uh sad
[1:26:47] situation, you know, uh up there where
[1:26:50] where we just come from. and to see
[1:26:52] people that I've known for years and and
[1:26:54] now they're teetering and and I find
[1:26:56] out, you know, that they're they're
[1:26:58] fellowshipping with with some guy that
[1:27:00] have left the message and and and so
[1:27:02] he's he's just going around from all
[1:27:04] church to, you know, all the people in
[1:27:05] the church trying to bring him out, you
[1:27:07] know, and and and and and all these
[1:27:09] things. And I think, well, well, you
[1:27:11] know, you ain't to fellowship with that.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; You got to stay in the light.
[1:27:19] God's the one that separated light from
[1:27:21] darkness.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And children of the light are not
[1:27:25] to have fellowship with the darkness.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; See, and so we we find that that uh uh
[1:27:34] uh darkness when light shines and and
[1:27:37] then then then darkness has to give way.
[1:27:40] Amen. Darkness can never stand in the
[1:27:42] presence of light. It it cannot do it.
[1:27:45] The prophet says light is 10 million
[1:27:47] times stronger than darkness.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? There's no reason for
[1:27:53] us to to go back in into the world.
[1:27:55] There's no reason for us amen to to give
[1:27:59] way amen from this message. The only way
[1:28:02] we could do that is we we we refuse to
[1:28:05] walk in the light and we accept the
[1:28:07] darkness instead.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when the power of light is
[1:28:15] shining, the power of darkness is
[1:28:17] broken.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; That's right. Brother Brown says, "No
[1:28:21] matter how dark it is, light will put it
[1:28:24] out."
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; So So the sun is is the natural sun
[1:28:32] light is the king of all lights up on
[1:28:35] the earth. Amen. No matter if it's
[1:28:38] artificial light or or you know uh star
[1:28:42] light, candle light, whatever, when that
[1:28:45] sun comes out, he's the king of of
[1:28:48] light.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says, "And no matter how
[1:28:52] much artificial light that we can have
[1:28:54] and and how many electric rays, great
[1:28:58] electric rays, we can produce when that
[1:29:00] sun rises, all the rest of them dim
[1:29:02] out." He said, "And that's the same
[1:29:05] thing with the word of God. When it
[1:29:08] rises, ain't that right? When it rises,
[1:29:11] the light of the word arises, then all
[1:29:15] superstitions and denominational
[1:29:17] fanaticisms and things just spread away
[1:29:20] and it shows it just exactly what it is.
[1:29:24] People can rise up with this and that
[1:29:26] and or the other and isms can rise,
[1:29:29] communism, fascism and all other isms
[1:29:32] can rise. superstitions and cults,
[1:29:35] whatever it might be, might rise. Amen.
[1:29:38] But the king light shuts out all other
[1:29:41] lights.
[1:29:42] Can you say amen? Amen. And that's what
[1:29:45] God ordained was the king light. Amen.
[1:29:48] To shine upon the seed and transform the
[1:29:52] seed into what he ordained them to be.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. King light. I'm glad
[1:29:59] for the king light. Amen. And when the
[1:30:02] sun is shining, notice when the sun is
[1:30:04] shining, amen, the all the darkness is
[1:30:07] pushed on the other side of the world.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; It's pushed. It cannot dwell together.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; And when the sun comes in its full
[1:30:15] strength, where's the darkness?
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; It's pushed on the other side of the
[1:30:19] world. Ain't that right? Well, it has to
[1:30:22] be that way. Amen. See, and and and and
[1:30:26] in order for the seed, Amen. to be
[1:30:28] transformed. So, so there there are
[1:30:30] people that live in darkness while
[1:30:31] there's other people living in light at
[1:30:33] the same time. Ain't that right? People
[1:30:35] living in light and people living in
[1:30:37] darkness. Amen. At at the same time
[1:30:40] because light and darkness cannot dwell
[1:30:42] together.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Bless the name of the Lord.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; So, it's the spoken word light
[1:30:52] that brings the transformation to the
[1:30:54] spiritual seed. Right.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Not denominational light,
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; not uh seminary light,
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; not not not all these other lights.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; And you can't even bring the seed forth
[1:31:11] from today from a glare of yesterday's
[1:31:13] light.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; It it doesn't work.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; The spoken word light is what brings
[1:31:18] forth the transformation. It's the only
[1:31:21] way, church, that the sons of God are
[1:31:24] going to be made manifested.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; It's the only way. And we're in the age.
[1:31:30] This is the time for the manifestation
[1:31:33] of sons of God.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; We've been a mystery. We have been kept
[1:31:39] up a mystery in seed form. But now is
[1:31:43] the time that the sons of God are to be
[1:31:46] transformed into manifestation. Come on.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; It's the only way. The word light, king
[1:31:52] light. It's the only way for you as a
[1:31:54] believer, as a gene seed of God to come
[1:31:57] to your potential.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; It's the only way.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; So, we don't need to run from the light.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; We need to run to the light.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? We We don't need to
[1:32:10] allow darkness to to keep us from the
[1:32:13] light. Amen. We want to stand full in
[1:32:16] the presence of the light to where the
[1:32:18] light breaks the power of darkness.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right. You would think
[1:32:26] that all nature would love light, but
[1:32:28] that's not true. You take the beetles,
[1:32:30] roaches, bugs, and things like that. Let
[1:32:33] the dark or let let let let the sun or
[1:32:36] flashlight or whatever let let the sun
[1:32:38] rise and they'll run for the darkness.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Gream said that's the way the gospel is.
[1:32:42] When it flashes on, what happens to
[1:32:45] those who wants to call you a holy
[1:32:46] roller? What happens to those people who
[1:32:49] make fun of you? When the light flashes
[1:32:51] on, they shoot for darkness as hard as
[1:32:53] they can go because they're children of
[1:32:56] the night.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; John 3:19. And this is the condemnation
[1:33:01] that light is coming to the world and
[1:33:04] men love darkness rather than light
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; because their deeds were evil. See, for
[1:33:11] everyone that doeth evil hateth the
[1:33:12] light, neither cometh to the light, lest
[1:33:15] his deeds should be reproved. See, but
[1:33:17] he that doeth truth cometh to the light,
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; that his deeds may be made manifest,
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; that they are wrought in God.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Now, you know, we're living in a day
[1:33:32] again
[1:33:34] when God is again separating light from
[1:33:37] darkness. That's right.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; He's separating it. And and Isaiah tells
[1:33:43] us of this. Isaiah 60 and1, it says,
[1:33:46] "Arise, shine, for thy light is come."
[1:33:49] Think of that. Arise, shine.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Bless the name of the Lord.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; For thy light is come, and the glory of
[1:33:59] the Lord is risen upon thee. For behold,
[1:34:02] darkness shall cover the earth, and
[1:34:03] gross darkness the people, but the Lord
[1:34:06] shall arise upon thee, and his glory
[1:34:10] shall be seen upon thee. Can you say
[1:34:13] amen?
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Telling us that there's going to be
[1:34:15] those that live in light and those that
[1:34:17] live in darkness.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Those and and and those that are are
[1:34:22] living in the light are under a
[1:34:24] different power than those that are
[1:34:26] living in the darkness. A power has the
[1:34:29] a power over those that are living in in
[1:34:31] in the darkness. And light has a power
[1:34:34] over those, amen, that it's shining
[1:34:36] upon. Amen. See, and so notice gross
[1:34:40] darkness. Darkness shall cover the earth
[1:34:42] and gross darkness the people. Brother
[1:34:44] Ram said, "This is the condition of the
[1:34:46] Leoysian age."
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now we're in the dark time,
[1:34:53] the Leoysian church age. man lukewarm
[1:34:56] not able to stand the things of God.
[1:34:58] Another place we're living in the last
[1:35:00] days at the closing age. See the Leotan
[1:35:04] age. One of the darkest ages that's ever
[1:35:07] been since the dark ages. A more
[1:35:09] hypocritical age right now than there
[1:35:12] was then. See, they had no light at all
[1:35:15] back then. But now this is a twilight, a
[1:35:18] a deceiving hour. Ain't that right? So,
[1:35:22] so then he tells us that it's this
[1:35:25] seventh church age, the Leoysian age
[1:35:28] that has gone into complete chaos.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; See, back in the same boat that it was
[1:35:35] in the beginning. Amen. In the
[1:35:37] beginning, it was a natural chaos.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; This is a spiritual chaos.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Just darkness
[1:35:45] everywhere. Why? Because Christ has been
[1:35:48] kicked out of the age,
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; kicked out of the church.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. And and notice now
[1:35:55] just so we does do not mix this up as
[1:35:58] some people are trying to do. Amen. Mix
[1:36:00] this up. Brother Brandham identifies
[1:36:02] this to be the Leoan this age to be the
[1:36:06] Leoysa church age which is the
[1:36:09] Pentecostal organization
[1:36:12] which all goes right straight into the
[1:36:14] mark of the beast. Right.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; We are not part of the Leoysian age.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? We're not part of the
[1:36:25] Pentecostal organization. We're not part
[1:36:28] Amen. of of of those going into the the
[1:36:32] mark of the beast. We're not part of
[1:36:33] that.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that?
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brown say we're part
[1:36:38] of a bride age.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; This is bride time.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Amen.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Now, you know, to understand that those
[1:36:50] people in the organizations and things,
[1:36:52] they're not bad people. They're they're
[1:36:54] good people and you know it and I know
[1:36:56] it and but as the prophet said, they're
[1:36:59] planted they were they were planted
[1:37:01] straight in a roll. Like brother Bram
[1:37:04] talks about the corn, you know, the
[1:37:06] farmer planted that corn straight in a
[1:37:08] row. See, and as the corn was growing,
[1:37:11] there was creepers that grew around some
[1:37:13] of the stock and pulled them down,
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; right? They wrapped itself around the
[1:37:19] stock and pulled that stock down to
[1:37:21] where they couldn't grow like they were
[1:37:23] supposed to. And now they're deformed
[1:37:25] and and and and uh just just in a mess.
[1:37:30] And and the prophet said, "Satan sold
[1:37:32] the creepers called science,
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; research, education, doctor's degrees."
[1:37:39] And sometimes they won't even let you in
[1:37:41] the pullpit unless you can produce a
[1:37:44] doctor's degree from seminary somewhere.
[1:37:46] It's all wrong. Not the people, it's the
[1:37:49] program that's wrong. Now, what uh
[1:37:52] what's it done? It's all headed up again
[1:37:55] and brought the whole entire world.
[1:37:58] Think of that. brought the whole entire
[1:38:00] world through a bunch of hybriding
[1:38:02] perversion of the original seed of God
[1:38:04] to another darkened chaos.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; And instead of being transformed into
[1:38:13] sons and daughters of God, amen, they're
[1:38:16] just they're just become church members.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; They just become religious.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; They they just become, as Paul said,
[1:38:24] having a form of godliness. Amen. yet
[1:38:26] denying the power thereof. But the
[1:38:29] prophet says, "I'm so glad that God is
[1:38:32] mindful of us again, that he can still
[1:38:36] move upon the face of the condition he
[1:38:39] promised he would do it and call a
[1:38:41] little flock, which would be his bride."
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? taking that
[1:38:48] deformationation and breaking the power
[1:38:51] of that thing, breaking Satan's power
[1:38:54] over our lives to where we can truly be
[1:38:57] transformed into what God has called us
[1:39:00] to be. Not sinners, but sons and
[1:39:04] daughters of God. Not bound for hell,
[1:39:06] but bound for heaven. Not bound for
[1:39:09] tribulation, but bound to the marriage
[1:39:12] supper of the lamb and the and the
[1:39:14] millennium. Can you say amen? Oh yes
[1:39:17] sir.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said out of that Pentecostal
[1:39:21] people see that Leoysian age out of that
[1:39:24] Leoysa Pentecostal. See he's pulling
[1:39:27] that remnant up here. Watch to show
[1:39:31] Jesus Christ.
[1:39:33] Not to reflect leotysa, not to reflect a
[1:39:37] lukewarm chaotic condition, but to
[1:39:40] reflect Jesus Christ. To show Jesus
[1:39:43] Christ, reflect his life just the same
[1:39:46] yesterday, today, and forever. Exactly
[1:39:48] when the evening lights shine.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; And again, the darkness is being
[1:39:56] separated so that the light can shine
[1:39:59] upon the seed. church. How blessed we
[1:40:03] are to be able to lay and in the
[1:40:07] presence of not the sen or su n but the
[1:40:11] sen. Amen. Truly to be able to lay in
[1:40:15] the presence of God and watch the
[1:40:18] transformation take place in our lives.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm afraid people just don't
[1:40:27] understand what the message is about
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; and so they get so confused about these
[1:40:32] things and what it is. But this message
[1:40:34] is our life.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; It's it's important to us.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; It's important to believe it. It's
[1:40:42] important. Amen. To ask God to give us
[1:40:44] the understanding of it,
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; the revelation of it. Can you say amen?
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Brother Brandham also likened
[1:40:54] the Pentecostal age, the sleighian age,
[1:40:57] Pentecostal age to that of the shock,
[1:41:01] you know, and you know how he talks
[1:41:02] about it, how it goes through the stages
[1:41:04] and then goes through that third stage
[1:41:05] of the shock and and the shock is
[1:41:08] gathered around inside of it is the seed
[1:41:10] that is developing. Amen. And then there
[1:41:13] comes a time that that all the life
[1:41:17] gathers in the the seed. All that life
[1:41:21] all down through that stock, it all
[1:41:22] gathers in that seed and then the shock
[1:41:26] pulls away. It dies. It It rots. It It
[1:41:30] just no good. It was used for purpose at
[1:41:32] one time, but now it's no longer needed.
[1:41:35] And and the now the seed is laying there
[1:41:38] in the presence of the sun to ripen. The
[1:41:42] the light of the sun, amen, is is
[1:41:45] shining upon that seed and is ripening
[1:41:49] it to its maturity. Ain't that right?
[1:41:51] And I say to you, the shuck has pulled
[1:41:53] away. I believe it has. The shook has
[1:41:56] pulled away from the seed to where we're
[1:41:58] no longer tied and bound in
[1:42:00] denominational this and denomination
[1:42:02] that and traditions of man and
[1:42:04] traditions of teaching and we are just
[1:42:07] simply taking God's word for what it
[1:42:09] says and believing it.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Brother Bram says, "See
[1:42:17] why did it pull away for?"
[1:42:19] So that it would bring the grain in the
[1:42:22] presence of the sun to ripen the grain
[1:42:24] to a golden ripen
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; for the master. Why has it pulled away?
[1:42:31] It so it causes heartaches and tears
[1:42:34] that they don't lay before the su but
[1:42:36] the sen to be ripened to the true full
[1:42:39] gospel. See, it brings a transformation
[1:42:43] to manifest everything that Jesus Christ
[1:42:46] promised in the Bible.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Are you one of those tonight?
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Manifesting everything that God promised
[1:42:53] in the Bible.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; See, there is a raising up a body today
[1:42:58] amongst the people. And there will be no
[1:43:01] more organizations. It goes right out
[1:43:03] into rich Leota. Can you say amen? And
[1:43:07] and and he says this, "The church age is
[1:43:10] ending now." And and and this was years
[1:43:13] ago. The church age is ending now. This
[1:43:16] is the hour. She's just about finished.
[1:43:18] And God's pulling his church.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; Pulling his church. Can you say amen?
[1:43:24] Come out of her. Right. And and so he
[1:43:26] says in the Bible, God told how Luther
[1:43:29] would do, what Luther would do, and how
[1:43:31] Wesley would do, and how this
[1:43:32] Pentecostal denomination will go into
[1:43:35] Leoa lukewarm condition. Now, did you
[1:43:38] notice that the Pentecostal denomination
[1:43:40] will go in to Leoa lukewarm condition,
[1:43:44] not the bride?
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; The bride is not going into that
[1:43:48] lukewarm leosya condition.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; We're fighting against that spirit.
[1:43:55] Amen.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; And the only way that keeps us from
[1:43:59] doing that is we're laying in the
[1:44:00] presence of the sun.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; I hope this all right this evening.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; He said, see, so they the Pentecostal
[1:44:10] denomination will go right into the
[1:44:13] leoty lukewarm condition. But in the
[1:44:15] midst of that, he God would pull the
[1:44:18] people out. Pull his elect out. Pull
[1:44:21] that bride out. Can you say amen? Why?
[1:44:24] We're not part of that. We're the ones
[1:44:26] that's being transformed.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; God never intended Leoa to be part of
[1:44:34] our lives,
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; God never uh uh uh intended for this
[1:44:41] bride, his elect, amen, to be so wrapped
[1:44:44] up and caught up in Leosa to where they
[1:44:46] ain't powerless and formless and don't
[1:44:48] know anything about the power of God.
[1:44:51] That's not the bride. Amen.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; See, so he says God is taking the elect
[1:44:59] out of that Pentecostal church, that
[1:45:02] hybrid, pulling it out and watch
[1:45:04] finishing up the word,
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; The word come and the Pentecostals
[1:45:10] rejected it.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; But God is pulling a people out of that
[1:45:13] Pentecostal church uh uh and and to
[1:45:17] finish up his word. See, and it's got to
[1:45:20] be so close until the word itself will
[1:45:22] blend with this word. There comes the
[1:45:25] headstone crying grace, grace, amazing
[1:45:27] grace, the headstone.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; So arise, shine, rise, and shine for thy
[1:45:33] light has come and the glory of the Lord
[1:45:37] is risen upon thee.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; What is it? It's calling for
[1:45:41] transformation.
[1:45:44] The seeds of God being transformed in
[1:45:46] this age.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; The light is shining. Arise.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; Come out of that dirt.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Come out of that organization. Come out
[1:45:57] of the world. Come out of all of the
[1:45:59] Leoysia uh uh uh condition.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Come out of those
[1:46:05] things. Now there is no question
[1:46:10] in my mind that the message of the hour
[1:46:13] is the king light for our day.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; It's the king light.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said at the opening of the
[1:46:24] seven seals, Revelations 10,
[1:46:28] and we're going to take our time for
[1:46:29] just a moment.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; The full word, everybody say the full
[1:46:34] word.
[1:46:35] is to be born
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; into manifestation again
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; and vindicated by the spirit of God in
[1:46:44] the full strength as it was when he was
[1:46:48] here on earth.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; When at the opening of the seven seals,
[1:46:55] the full word is to be born into
[1:46:59] manifestation again.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; Son of man revealed in what? a bride
[1:47:05] body
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; manifested in the same way doing the
[1:47:13] same things that it did when it was here
[1:47:15] on earth. Hebrews 13:8, Jesus Christ is
[1:47:20] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right,
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham says the Holy Spirit is
[1:47:27] here calling out a bride for Christ.
[1:47:32] He is doing it by vindicating his word,
[1:47:34] a promise to her for this age, showing
[1:47:38] that it is Christ. If the finger is
[1:47:40] supposed to move in this age, the finger
[1:47:42] will move. How many believes that?
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; If the foot is supposed to move in this
[1:47:46] age, the foot will move. If the eye is
[1:47:48] to see in this age, the eye will see.
[1:47:51] The spirit of God as it grow into the
[1:47:53] full stature of God is the age that we
[1:47:57] were living in now. The Holy Spirit is
[1:48:00] here vindicating the message of the
[1:48:03] hour.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit is doing this so
[1:48:08] that the people that believe God will be
[1:48:12] called out of this chaos.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; Why did God vindicate the message? So
[1:48:19] that we would believe it and be called
[1:48:22] out of the chaos.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; God so vindicated there should be no
[1:48:26] questions about it, right? No questions
[1:48:29] about it. That's right. See, and so we
[1:48:32] we look now that the light has brought
[1:48:36] the church.
[1:48:38] How long has it been since brother
[1:48:39] Brandham's been gone?
[1:48:41] And look how far we've progressed
[1:48:45] since brother Brandham left the scene.
[1:48:47] Even
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; you know, people used to just just
[1:48:50] believe God sent a prophet. God sent a
[1:48:52] prophet and tell all the stories about
[1:48:54] the prophet and what they you know were
[1:48:56] with him and all these things and and
[1:48:58] but but the light has has progressed us.
[1:49:02] We've we've we've developed more
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; the transformation
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; by the light. Can you say amen?
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; So the light has brought the church
[1:49:12] further than what it used to be. Prophet
[1:49:16] said not Methodists, not Pentecostals,
[1:49:19] not some other denomination,
[1:49:21] but we are advanced. Everybody say
[1:49:23] advanced.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; We are advanced in the word.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Not knowledge.
[1:49:31] But that seed word seed that was God
[1:49:34] called us to be. We're advancing
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; advancing. What I was yesterday, I'm not
[1:49:41] today. what I was 10 years ago and not
[1:49:44] today.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; It's an advancing. There's a
[1:49:47] transformation taking place.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And what is it? It's
[1:49:52] it's we're being transformed to sons and
[1:49:55] daughters and and and the full
[1:49:57] manifestation.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Uh as the musicians come, Brother Bram
[1:50:02] said, "What does the transformation?"
[1:50:04] God does it by the spirit of his word.
[1:50:07] He transforms. He plants his seed,
[1:50:10] throws his spirit on it, and it brings
[1:50:12] forth the product. See, his holy spirit
[1:50:15] transformed the seed word in to be
[1:50:18] vindicated of its kind. And what kind of
[1:50:21] seed you are, that shows just what's in
[1:50:24] you. You can't hide it. Whatever you are
[1:50:27] inside, it shows outside. You just can't
[1:50:29] keep from it. You can't make that tree
[1:50:31] anything but what it is. It's going to
[1:50:34] be that way. The Holy Spirit transforms
[1:50:37] the seeds that's on the inside of it.
[1:50:39] Ain't that right?
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; And remember, the Holy Spirit's moving
[1:50:42] upon the message. The message ain't
[1:50:45] making us sons and God,
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; The sun doesn't make the seed an apple
[1:50:51] seed.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; It just brings forth what it is. It just
[1:50:55] makes a transformation.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; See, and so it he says the Holy Spirit
[1:51:01] transforms the seed that's on the inside
[1:51:03] of it. No matter what kind of a seed it
[1:51:06] is, it'll transform it. If it's evil,
[1:51:08] it'll bring forth evil. If it's a
[1:51:10] hypocrite, it'll bring forth a
[1:51:11] hypocrite. If it's a genuine word of
[1:51:13] God, it'll bring forth a genuine son or
[1:51:17] daughter of God through a think of man's
[1:51:19] filter. When the seed comes up, it comes
[1:51:21] up through that and it produces a son
[1:51:25] and daughter of God. Can you say amen?
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, be transformed
[1:51:32] by the renewing of your mind.
[1:51:35] Hallelujah.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm glad there's a change that's
[1:51:40] taking place.
[1:51:42] Not going backwards, going forward.
[1:51:47] Not backsliding,
[1:51:49] not falling away,
[1:51:52] but getting more stronger and stronger
[1:51:54] and stronger.
[1:51:57] As Abraham, the Bible says Abraham
[1:51:59] though he got weak in his body, yet he
[1:52:01] was stronger in faith.
[1:52:04] Amen. Got stronger because he was
[1:52:05] nursing off the promises of God.
[1:52:08] [Music]
[1:52:10] Hallelujah.
[1:52:11] I am so glad I It's just the grace of
[1:52:14] God, church, that we have been
[1:52:17] introduced and brought into the very
[1:52:20] thing that's going to bring on a
[1:52:21] rapture.
[1:52:23] What What if What if we were out in the
[1:52:25] world? What what what if we were caught
[1:52:27] up in some denomination and sitting
[1:52:29] under a theologian or psychologist or
[1:52:31] whatever, you know, and and and having
[1:52:34] this form of worship and yet not knowing
[1:52:38] we we'd be worshiping the devil thinking
[1:52:40] we're worshiping God as the prophet
[1:52:42] said. That's what a lot of people are
[1:52:43] doing. See, we wouldn't have no hope for
[1:52:46] a rapture. We would have no hope for
[1:52:48] that to to make these promises live.
[1:52:52] But because he predestinated us, he had
[1:52:56] to bring a light
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; to shine upon us
[1:53:02] to quicken the seed,
[1:53:05] to bring a transformation. I'm so glad
[1:53:08] for that.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; And that's why brother Brandham when he
[1:53:11] was talking about his ministry, he
[1:53:14] wasn't bragging. He wasn't anything, but
[1:53:16] he was showing us that his ministry tied
[1:53:19] with the scriptures.
[1:53:22] showing that this ministry was a spoken
[1:53:25] word light
[1:53:27] to shine upon that predestinated seed to
[1:53:30] bring forth a transformation
[1:53:32] and by it by it we're being transformed.
[1:53:37] You love him.
[1:53:39] [Music]
[1:53:43] Oh, it's Jesus.
[1:53:47] [Music]
[1:53:54] Oh,
[1:53:55] we'll walk in
[1:53:58] the light.
[1:54:00] Such a beautiful
[1:54:02] [Music]
[1:54:04] light.
[1:54:05] [Music]
[1:54:06] Come where the dwrops
[1:54:11] of mercy
[1:54:14] are bright.
[1:54:17] Just shine all around us
[1:54:23] by day and by night.
[1:54:27] Jesus
[1:54:30] the light of the world.
[1:54:34] Oh, sing it again.
[1:54:37] We will walk in
[1:54:40] the light,
[1:54:43] a beautiful
[1:54:46] light.
[1:54:48] Come where
[1:54:51] the dwars
[1:54:53] of mercy
[1:54:56] are bright.
[1:54:59] Shine all
[1:55:01] around us by day and by night.
[1:55:09] It's Jesus
[1:55:12] the light of
[1:55:14] the world.
[1:55:18] Oh, we will walk in
[1:55:22] the light,
[1:55:25] the beautiful
[1:55:28] light.
[1:55:31] Come where the dew drops
[1:55:35] of mercy
[1:55:37] are bright.
[1:55:40] Oh, shine all around us
[1:55:45] by day and
[1:55:48] by night.
[1:55:50] It's Jesus,
[1:55:53] the light of the world.
[1:55:58] Do you know that song? Shine on me.
[1:56:00] Shine on me.
[1:56:02] [Music]
[1:56:03] Shine
[1:56:05] on me.
[1:56:09] Shine
[1:56:11] on me.
[1:56:14] Let the light
[1:56:17] from the lighthouse
[1:56:20] shine
[1:56:22] on me.
[1:56:24] Oh, let it shine.
[1:56:27] Oh, on me.
[1:56:30] Let it shine
[1:56:33] on me.
[1:56:35] Let the light
[1:56:38] from the lighthouse
[1:56:42] shine
[1:56:44] once again. Oh, let it shine.
[1:56:51] Oh, shine
[1:56:55] on me.
[1:56:57] Let the light
[1:57:00] from the lighthouse
[1:57:03] shine
[1:57:05] on me. Oh, let it shine,
[1:57:10] [Music]
[1:57:12] God. Let it shine
[1:57:16] on me.
[1:57:18] Let the light
[1:57:21] from the lighthouse
[1:57:24] shine
[1:57:27] on me.
[1:57:32] Oh, do you love him?
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; Can we just stand to our feet?
[1:57:38] Amen. And I'm so glad for the light to
[1:57:41] bring a power transformation
[1:57:46] on our soul.
[1:57:49] Amen.
[1:57:51] I think I think we I believe we feel
[1:57:55] that light shining upon us.
[1:57:59] I feel it. I feel that power working
[1:58:04] in my soul.
[1:58:06] I think that's what makes it so easy to
[1:58:09] believe
[1:58:11] in the changing of our body.
[1:58:15] If you if if if a man's not walking in
[1:58:17] that already and not feeling that power,
[1:58:20] it'd be hard to even fathom. It just
[1:58:23] seem like a fairy tale,
[1:58:26] you know, that one of these days our
[1:58:27] bodies are going to change and all these
[1:58:29] things. But see that power of
[1:58:31] transformation is working in us now.
[1:58:34] Changing us into more like him day by
[1:58:38] day, day by day. Can you say amen? I'm
[1:58:42] so glad to be part of it. God bless you.
[1:58:46] Remember service
[1:58:49] Sunday at 11:00.
[1:58:52] Amen. Come prayed up believing.
[1:58:56] Amen. And is there any announcements?
[1:59:00] Nothing. All right. Amen. Let's just bow
[1:59:04] our heads in a word of prayer. Father,
[1:59:08] we thank you, Lord, for the power that
[1:59:10] works within us.
[1:59:14] We would be cut off from that light if
[1:59:17] you hadn't by grace
[1:59:20] brought us to the light.
[1:59:23] Father, we'd be walking in darkness,
[1:59:27] blind, not knowing you, ignorant of your
[1:59:30] promises, ignorant of your power of your
[1:59:33] life. But oh God,
[1:59:36] [Music]
[1:59:38] we're having fellowship with the mystery
[1:59:41] of life.
[1:59:44] It's working in us, Lord, and we're so
[1:59:47] thankful for it, Lord. Thank you for
[1:59:50] your mercy. We thank you for your grace
[1:59:52] and your favor toward us, Lord. That
[1:59:55] we're your children and
[1:59:58] you're still with us, God.
[2:00:01] We love you. I pray that you would just
[2:00:04] bless the people that have come, those
[2:00:06] that may be sick and couldn't come. I
[2:00:10] pray you would just bless them.
[2:00:13] Father, bring us to your house Sunday
[2:00:18] safely, Lord.
[2:00:21] hands be upon us throughout the
[2:00:23] remainder of the week. Father, keep us
[2:00:26] all safe. Keep us under the blood.
[2:00:29] Father, forgive us of all of our sins
[2:00:32] and failures, our mistakes. Lord, may we
[2:00:37] look toward you and keep pressing the
[2:00:40] battle.
[2:00:41] We ask it in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:00:45] Amen.
