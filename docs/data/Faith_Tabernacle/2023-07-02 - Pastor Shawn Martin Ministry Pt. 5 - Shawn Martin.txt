meetings amen the people of God can come together and um but we also enjoy meeting here at the local assembly and just believe God to do something great amen before we go under the word could we just bow our heads in a word of Prayer precious Lord Our Father so privileged to be able to call you father Lord knowing that we've been begotten of you Lord that we are Sons and Daughters of yours that your raw blood flows within our veins the quickening power Lord we're not just mere mortals Lord we are Supernatural Lord and you've made us that way to where we could live in this world and be a super race a super Church an invincible Army Lord and father no matter what comes our way Lord no matter what tactics and uh schemes the devil has laid waiting for us Lord we know and are confident that we will overcome them now father we just come here just to worship you and asking for a recharge Lord in our spirit Lord and that you would come and fellowship with this Lord it means more than just to us than fellowshipping even with the president or some high up in this world if you would just come and meet with us and not just your presence but if you would speak Lord to his father and I pray that you had anoint me Father help me to get myself out of the way Lord and may your people get themselves out of the way father and Lord that you would have the preeminence in this service we ask it Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen thank you Lord Jesus Hebrews the eighth chapter and [Music] it says now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the Throne of the Majesty in the heavens a minister of the sanctuary and of the true Tabernacle which the Lord pitched and not man for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer for if he were on Earth he should not be a priest saying that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law who serve unto the example and Shadow of heavenly things as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the Tabernacle for see saith he that thou make all things according to the pattern show to thee in the mound in other words Moses saw a Heavenly Tabernacle saw that Heavenly realm and God showed it to him and then he was to make an Earthly Tabernacle after what he saw and so sixth verse but now has he obtained a more excellent Ministry by how much also he is the mediator of the better Covenant which was established upon bitter promises amen you can have your seats this morning so Paul showing that Christ is the high priest which is greater than the natural high priest the natural was only a type and Shadow of that which was to come and I'm not going to go that direction but I again I I want to talk about Ministry because Paul is saying here a minister see second verse minister of the sanctuary that's what this high priest see who is said on the right hand of the Throne of the Majesty in the heavens a minister and then you look here where Paul would say the sixth verse he hath obtained a more excellent Ministry by how much also he is the mediator of a better Covenant which was established on better promises so I want to just again talk of ministry and I'm going to I'm using that scripture as maybe a foundation but uh Maybe uh looking at the purpose of ministry and maybe the title should be actually God's Ministry but I'm putting it as Ministry all across the board as we go that makes sense but Ministry is an agent or instrument a person or thing through which something is accomplished and so uh there is a foundation upon which Ministry is is established Ministry has must have a foundation uh and and so there is a purpose as to why Ministry exists and and and and so I speaking of the ministry that God has established but Satan has a ministry as well and it's founded upon his agenda and purpose and and so uh and his his ministry Works through deception and and he transformed as Paul would say he transforms himself into an angel of Light and his ministers uh act as Ministers of righteousness and and so but Satan's Ministry is against God's purpose uh so um it would be against God's Ministry because God's Ministry is founded upon the his purpose his will his agenda and and so Satan uh his ministry seeks to destroy what God does and is currently doing and and it is established to undermine God's word and John 10 10 Jesus said the thief and we all know the thief uh is Satan he cometh not but for to steal to kill and to destroy so so that's that's his ministry at work to steal to kill and to destroy so Satan does not come as a builder his ministry is not in in building uh his ministry is to destroy it's a destructive it's it's to tear down it's to ultimately kill uh not just physically which we're seeing that a lot these days uh suicide rates especially among young people but also we know that the end uh is is a spiritual death uh and that's that's coming from the ministry of of Satan and uh um and and so he doesn't come to establish the church he doesn't come to establish the home he doesn't come to establish the marriage he doesn't come to establish and build up the individual hmm there's so many individuals today that have many complexes that's not God that Satan that puts these complexes in individuals and and he gets the person looking at the complex and you know a person that has complexes it's hard for God to use them because they've always got a complex there and preachers have complexes uh parents get complexes young people gets complexes people don't sing because they got complexes people Don't Preach because they got complexes and it's hard for them to get over the complexes and if if God can break these complexes down he could really use people ain't that right and and so uh but but Satan does these things he he doesn't come to it uh to to further the kingdom of God but he comes to break down and Destroy and and you know I I thought of uh and you just excuse me but we're just talking about a a minister uh there in the office and and uh how that he is he has struggled in in things and and just have gone through just so much in these past five years or so and and and um uh he's then then he's went from one to now trying to uh Pastor for a few years and and uh and even in that you know he had a minister to come in and sit there and then he didn't like what was being preached or how it was being preached thought he could be a better preacher and lead the people better and yada yada and and so he takes half the people with him to start another church and and you know how many of common that is in in this age that that's been even in the Pentecost when we were back there we had so many that would try to come in thinking that we were just young and dumb and especially when we first come into the message you know and they they thought they knew it better they had these great Mysteries and and these things and and so they start working on the people they'd start listening to the the gripes and the complaints and and before you know it they they started whining and dining and then their Christmas and and before you know it they take him out trying to establish their own their own Ministry and these things and and I was telling the brother though it's exactly the way Satan did it and and not in a church not not under a setting under a pastor he'd done it in heaven when there was no sin I mean it was a state of perfection for Pete's sake and yet Satan uh uh thought he could do a better job and and he was able to take two-thirds of the angels with him I mean took them from their very creator took them from a a a right atmosphere the best atmosphere you could get in the presence of God and yet Satan through his Beauty and Charisma and and would entice them to to seeing that they could have a better Kingdom than God and and of course the prophet said that Satan done that through pride and jealousy and that's what caused him to do it ain't that right see so Satan destroys anything that he is a part of all kingdoms of the world are his and look what he's doing to them most families and I'm going to say 99 maybe maybe more a family is not a hundred percent but close our families are under his control most children are under his control and they could even be sitting in church but under the control of Hollywood under the control of school under the teachings that they're trying to bring in most parents are under his control most churches are under his control and all of them can you say that with me all of them are being destroyed they're being destroyed and yet they're under Satan's control he has built his Eden Satan's built his Eden and has perfected it in this day can we all agree to that Satan has built his Eden he's worked for all these years to to perfect his Eden and we're here we're living in Satan's Eden now let's look at it there's more despondency than there's ever been there's more sickness than ever before there there is more death than ever before there is more hate than ever before there is more Rebellion than ever before there is more destruction than ever before there is more evil than ever before there is more Insanity than ever before there is more unrest than ever before the home life is being destroyed are are our people's minds are so Twisted today to where they're thinking they're a cat or an animal or or the woman being a man and man being a womb and then and all of these things and and it's it's because it's it's showing what control they're really under for Satan is a destroyer he comes deceit uh uh to steal kill and destroy and so everyone who is a part of his ministry amen uh are anointed to serve that purpose they are under his headship they are under his Direction and under his control and it's his ministry in the church ages and the Seven Seals we see the four stages of Satan's Ministry in Revelation 6 we see him riding on four horses the the white horse rider the red horse rider the black horse rider the The Pale Horse Rider and and and we see it now we didn't see it before until God would send a prophet and the lamb would open the book to us but now we see him riding in these four stages and his work in both political and religious rims ain't that right nations are against Nation well who would do that well it's it's it's Satan because they every nation is under the control of of Satan ain't that right and the Bible calls him the mystery of iniquity they're in in second Thessalonians 2 7 and he has been exposed in this day how many believe that he's been exposed to his agenda has been exposed his ministry has been exposed ain't that right everything and that's why he will never be able to deceive the very elect of God he can't do that because God would expose him for what he is it may look pretty it may look glamorous if the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence amen but the Bride of God a man has been now able to have a spirit of discernment to discern in in in the difference and know the difference amen see that's right amen so now God's God's Ministry is important because that's how his will and purpose is carried out amen his purpose which is an eternal purpose is accomplished by his ministry his desires and plans a man is they're accomplished by his ministry see there is an objective to God's Ministry amen you you you uh maybe get ahead of myself but you you Ministries amen men that are preaching the gospel and they're really under God's Ministry there's an objective to what they're doing but there's also an objective to Satan's Ministry too ain't that right you think Satan wants you to make it in a Rapture you you think Satan wants Perfect Harmony you think God he wants God's people to come together and and and and in United Hearts United around the word of God not not somebody's idea not somebody's personality amen but around the word of God if we're a United around a personality that ain't going to work if you're uh uh uh if you're coming United around an idea that's not going to work but when God's people come together United around the word of God Satan's going to fight that tooth and nail he sure is so there's an objective now to finish reading John 10 10 Jesus said the thief cometh not but for to kill to steal and destroy but I am calm that they may have life and that they might have it more abundantly ain't that right so so this is the ministry of God to impart life to give life that the people can live that that the church can thrive ain't that right see so so then all who are called on for this ministry are anointed and called for that purpose as I've said God's Ministry has an objective and an objective is something toward which effort is directed the energy the the the the the the the everything the actions and everything is directed to something it's an objective Hollywood all their movies their anointed they may not even understand that but they're anointed and that and that that one that is anointing it has an objective ain't that right that that's why that that's why brother Brown said it used to be wrong to go to the picture shows but Satan snuck a good one he snuck a good one on us and brought it in our homes he's got an objective to it now we're seeing why he did it in this day if a person can't see what's happening to the young people if he can't see what what what's caused all this transgender homosexuals and perverseness it was because Satan snuck a good one he anointed them people he anoints these fashion designers to make our boys look like sissies he does I'm gonna go even further he and I believe he anoints our scientists and all that to put stuff in our Foods to break down our mental capacities to break down to where women can't have children he knows what he's doing and it's all an anointing see there's an objective but there was an objective why God sent a prophet there's an objective why God sends the Holy Ghost there's an objective why God sends his faithful Ministry there's an objective to these things it's a Ministry now this objective the subjective in in the Sons and Daughters of God is the main focus of it all you believe it the Sons and Daughters of God and that's what I want to talk about this morning because the Sons and Daughters of God are the elective God and we know that God's Ministry of course does not affect all human human beings in the way it does his elect now say that again God's Ministry doesn't affect all human beings in the way it does his elect but it wasn't for them it was for the elect see God's Ministry God's not wasting time with this ministry God's Ministry has full effect upon the Sons and Daughters of God ain't that right upon the election we find and and we uh it wasn't online last week but we talked about the the Holy Ghost being God's agent and how he's he's the main agent angels and all that that's they're they're they're they're they're they're they're part of that Ministry but the Holy Ghost is the agent of God ain't that right and and but but we we look and and God doesn't reveal himself just to anyone and and I want us to hopefully identify as ourselves as being the elect and and see how special we really are but uh uh God doesn't reveal himself just anyone Luke 10 21 in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I think the old father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for so uh it seemed good in thy sight you think of that the the the the the fact that you believe the message the fact that you see what God is doing in this day do you realize it was pleasing to God to show you these things and and and he says all things are delivered to me of my father and no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and he everybody say he that's me that's you he to whom the son will reveal him now we look at uh Luke 17 and 26 through 30 it talks about the son of man being revealed in this day as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage in other words marriage divorce and all these things until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also in the days of lot they did eat they drank more restaurants than we ever have right they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it more construction all of these things that we're seeing today but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed well he's not just revealing there's got to be a people to see the revelation there's got to be a people to whom he reveals it to now he looked at this age and it pleased the father to choose an elected group of people that would see this revealing and you say Amen now John 14 18 I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you and yet a little while the world seeth me no more see as me no more in other words the father ain't revealing it to them but you see me because I live you shall live also at that day you shall know that I am in the father so notice the Revelation that is to be in this age is not seeing a physical man not seeing a physical being but to see the Revelation that he is in the father I am in him and he is in me the world will no longer see him but a select group will see him and they will see him in what it truly is and the Revelation is Christ in US Christ in me now just as it was in the days of lot God revealed himself to Abraham not a lot ain't that right there's not a person who can know God without it being revealed as to who he is it even has to be revealed to the elect predestinated of God even to those that God predestined to see it it still has to be revealed to them or they will never see it that's why we call it the grace of God the mercy of God that God would take the time to open our eyes to the things he's doing First Corinthians 12 and 3 says that no man can say Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost God's agent the ministry right see brother Brown said you cannot believe that Jesus is the Christ until you have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're only testifying or saying what the scripture says saying what the pastor says saying what mother says saying or some good preacher says but you don't know it yourself until he has witnessed his resurrection to you aren't you glad for God's agent amen see and you you you can never know truly know that Jesus is the Christ unless God himself has bore witness to you by the Holy Ghost no man can call Jesus to Christ truly genuinely call him the Christ except by the Holy Ghost ain't that right see so the Holy Ghost is God's agent as we talked about see now John the Baptist brother Brown said John the Baptist would have never known Jesus If he if it had not been for the Holy Ghost pointing him out and yet John was already written in the Scriptures it was written of John that he would foretell and he would he would uh bring the announcement and he would he would introduce the Lamb of God ain't that right but yet John being a predestinated man he could not do it until the Holy Ghost revealed it to him John said to the people there is one standing among you right now an ordinary man that is here somewheres he's the Lamb of God see it was revealed by the Holy Ghost brother Brian said that's the only way you'll know him today the only way you'll get the threefold revelation of God is for the Holy Ghost and the only way it can ever be is your predestinated to see it now think of the Holy Ghost can fall upon everybody but only those that are predestinated to see it will see it see the ministry of God works for the elect [Music] they they can criticize this message all they want to but I was predestinated to see it I was predestinated to believe it I can't help what they do they come up with other stupid questions I ain't got time for their stupid questions it's their questions not mine that's right and I don't have to answer their questions God's already answered it God's already proven it to be right the fact is they can't see it they want to criticize it it shows ain't predestinated to it see so the only way you can ever you it can ever be is your predestinated to see it if it don't you'll never see it if you're not predestinated to see it you'll never see it because that light can Flash and you'll go away and make fun of it explain it away by some intellectual conception when the very God himself manifesting himself and proving it but if it ain't upon you to see it you won't see it see so everything that God has done in his ministry from from the foundation of the world to uh before the foundation of the world to now has been done for his elect every promise that God has made to his church has been for his elect you believe it amen that's that's right see and and and who are the elect those who have their names written in the Lamb's Book of Life and when were they written before the foundation of the world ain't that right so see they are the ones that are secure they are the ones they their names can never ever be taken off the book but you're glad for that now let's just talk about it for just a few moments but we we've talked years ago I guess now but and and most of you know it but just maybe for the young people but there is what the Bible calls The Book of Life and there is the Lamb's Book of Life they are not two different books per se really Brown says there is no basis for the claims that the Lamb's Book of Life is not the same as the Book of Life and so brother Branham teaches it as being one book and then he would teach it as though they're two separate books and he's not con contradicting himself but he is showing that it is all one book it's like the Bible it's a book but there's 66 books within this book ain't that right so so in this book there and and I'm gonna use this in this book there's the Lamb's Book of Life and the Book of Life and and and so uh uh it's it's I believe that this Bible is what we're going to be judged by you believe it every man every man I don't care who they are burn the Bible but they're going to be judged by it let us gather up in on the coffee table that they're going to be judged by this book foreign it's amazing that this book has remained the best seller for centuries and still is the best seller it's the most bought sought book that's ever been is the Bible and yet only the elect can see its Pages or the con understand its contents through a prophet of this age but why is it it's because there's something about it and I believe that people know they're going to be judged by this book it's going to be the judgment can you say man so we we find that the Lamb's Book of Life only has a limited amount of names on it which God wrote before the foundation of the world he is not currently adding names he has never added names throughout time David's time Moses time or whatever and then brother Brandon would say nothing will be saved only those whose names were put in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and I'll say it this way there's not one that's going to make it in a rapture unless their names are written in this Lamb's Book of Life there's going to be a lot of people make it to heaven but even babies when they die they go to heaven but it determines if their name is written on the Lamb's Book of Life whether they go in the rapture amen so see it's it's those names not one of those names that he put on the Lamb's Book of Life can ever be taken off they are the ones that God called Justified Sanctified and already glorified when before the foundation of the world amen and the prophet said he's already made a place for them in glory every name that is written in the Lamb's Book of Life he's already made a place for them in glory before we ever come into sin we were born in sin shaping in iniquity come to this world speaking we were we were no good rotten Sinners and yet God had already made a place for us in glory it's pretty powerful second Corinthians 5 1 for we know that if our Earthly house uh of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building and house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens this is not something that will be when we die this is something that's already there you already have a body waiting for you in glory and you say Amen so so so if if if we can understand I I pray that you could understand where I'm trying to come from as far as God's Ministry having an objective see so second Peter 3 and 9 the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but Islam suffering to us word not willing everybody say not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but we already know that not all is going to come to repentance hey ain't that right yet God is not willing that that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but God doesn't work he's not working as a guest thing like we do you know we we're hoping we're wishing we're we're we're believing we're what whatever see uh uh we don't know what tomorrow's going to be but but maybe there's something we really want and and so we're hoping that that everything will work out to what we want it to be and amen but God's not doing that amen he already knows what will be by his infinite mind ain't that right that's why he could already secure our future that's why he could already secure us amen has already being there before we've had anything to do with it so now the prophet says see but God but being God he had to know and does know the end from the beginning if he doesn't then he is an infinite and if he is not infinite he isn't God so he wasn't willing and certainly that any should perish but he knowing who would perish and who would not perish that's the reason the very purpose that Jesus come to the Earth was to save those that God through his foreknowledge seen that wanted to be saved because the whole world was condemned ain't that right so so as the world would put it that Jesus is there he's he's got his his hands and he's reaching out for everyone he's sad amen because so many are rejecting him today and and he's trying he's compelling and and it almost would seem as though he's defeated amen because everybody's spit in his face still and all that well he's not defeated and that's not what Calvary is all about he come to save his own which was his elect before the foundation of the world every one of those names that's who he come for amen amen and that's why the ministry is not in vain the ministry isn't in vain see so now uh uh so he says see the uh uh God he was to save those that God through his foreign wanted to be saved because the whole world was condemned he's I don't see how we could teach it any other way than the foreknowledge of God and the Bible plainly says that he knows the end from the beginning and can tell it so here's second Timothy 2 and 19. amen uh it says nevertheless the foundation of God standeth Shore having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his you believe that so you see why do we have Revival meetings why why does the presence of God just come Amen in in our services in the local church and local assembly or why why why why do we have these things is because it's not in vain we've seen people come to the altars and they walk out and they nothing nothing happens it's almost like water falling on the Ducks back and and all these things but it's for that elect God will have one meeting and will call an assembly of thousands for one person and you say Amen everything that God does is for that elect the Holy Ghost will fall all over the building but it could be just for that one elect people could be dancing and shouting and speaking in tongues and all that but it's for that one elect I've seen people speak in tongues and live like Hypocrites I've seen them dance and shout and roll on the floor and live like Hypocrites but I've also seen them people that God has touched with an eternal touch the Lord knoweth them that are his so the prophet said see therefore when a person tries to be something that they're not they're only making an impersonation and sooner or later it will find you out your sins will find you out you cannot cover them notice what he says now there's only one covering for sin do you believe that it ain't the pope it ain't a preacher it ain't your dad and mom they can tell you whatever is fine but you better have it right with God that's right there's only one Covenant for sin and that's the blood of Jesus Christ and it cannot be applied unless God has called you from the foundation of the world so the blood cannot be applied just to anybody it's a plaid it was shed a man for those who were in the Lamb's Book of Life God's whole Ministry is for that elect this way we'll have a Rapture that's why we're the bride of Christ every one of those who in the in the Lamb's Book of Life they are the bride of Christ they are Sons and Daughters of God they'll never stand in judgment they'll never enter into that place of of judgment in in Wrath everyone else will and there will be those that will make it to heaven but they they don't have blood they don't have that atonement in its fullness we'll put it that way hello and they got to go through and face the wrath of God they've got to go through it they got to go through the tribulation but this bride will not this blood do you realize the blood of Christ is so powerful one drop one drop of blood is powerful enough to take all sins away one drop but why because it's only for the elect you're free by the blood of Christ ain't that right so we find that's what the blood was shed for see it cannot be applied unless God has called you from the foundation of the world that's what the blood was shed for not to be tramped upon made fun of job that and evenly spoke of and so forth it was for a direct purpose the blood of Jesus Christ was for the a direct purpose that's right not to be played with not to be impersonated by saying that's the sins are covered when they're not and no man can have his sins covered lest his name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and Jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws him and all that the father hath past tense given me will come to me ain't that right now as we go here further a little bit uh both the book and life and the Lamb's Book of Life deal with life they deal with life but one one deals with our natural life our natural birth and the other one deals with life according to our spiritual birth amen so I'm going to read you some quotes but brother Brown said it's the same book but one of them is your natural birth the other one is your spiritual birth one leads out to the other one just like a stalk of wheat whenever you talk to me you talk to me as a living person but there's a part of me here is that person that must perish right see that's the book that the name comes off of so so there's the Book of Life we'll just say the Book of Life deals with our Natural Life according to our natural birth but that's not and in that natural birth we were sinners we were condemned to die we were a hopeless case we were wretched by that natural birth we couldn't even come into the presence of God without being condemned ain't that right all of these things but that part must perish thank God for your ministry that part must perish see that's the book the name comes off of but the Eternal one the predestinated one the elected one that name can never come off from there because it always was on it and it can never be taken off can you say man see so you were a Christian before you ever become a Christian right right and in the end you you you will be a Christian because that's what God predestinated you to be in the beginning right you were a son and daughter of God before you ever projected yourself as being a saint you might have hated God you may have hated Church there's nothing well there's nothing about our sinful life in our sinful condition that we wanted God that we sought after God you didn't seek after God God sought after you God's agent the Holy Ghost shot after you it's true he saw it went through the alleys to find you went in the bar rooms to find you went in The Honky Tonks to find you he went into the lowliness of your life and and and to find you ain't that right why because before you knew it he already knew you and put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life and every one of us who has her name in the Lamb's Book of Life the end of our life will be Victory the end of our life will be exactly the way he saw us to be in the first place do you believe it see so they're the Eternal and the predestinated one the elected one that name can never come off from there because it always was it can never be taken off see now see the Baptists say believe there's two separate books and in one way it is two separate books another way it is in two separate books see so he says I'm two separate people I'm Body Soul Spirit these the three separate people but only one makes me as a being right so there's only one Book of Life One there's only real one Book of Life see uh uh like there was a one germ of the wheat that come up to the stalk and went through the tassel and out through the husk and into the wheat all the way along there you say well now that's a wheatling there it isn't the wheat it's the stock I hope you're getting it but together it's a wheat but it had to go through stages ain't that right you might be looking at the wheat but but it's not the wheat that's the stop that's the tussle that's the shock but keep hanging in there what was in the ground to begin with it will come out ain't that right so so he says see so it isn't the wheat is the stock but together it's the wheat see it's the wheat because it's all one stock but the wheat is what you're talking about the grain at the end of it the others were a carrier and it must perish oh I hope you understand your physical this whole body full of corruption if I could say it this way it's not the son of God that that's just a body of corruption it's the carrier of what you really are it's the carrier of that predestinated seed and it had to go through its stages and all of that it's just a carrier but this whole body is going to be changed don't put all your time on this body can you say Amen see so so we find he said see it must perish the others were his carrier it must perish see that's the one now see one place sounds like you can have your name taken off the Lamb's Book of Life the other place you can't do it see well that that's where it is see it's all in that great Revelation there which was made known during the time of the Seven Seals why is it how some people can't believe it Jesus said no man can come to me except my father first draw him and all that the father has given me will come to me no man can understand who he is or how it is except to be revealed to you by the revelation of God can you say Amen see you're standing here a lot of people going to church these days amen millions of people well I don't know it may be getting down to a few now but uh they're at the ball games and all but but there are people that are all over the place that are going to church but there's an elect in this we're all human beings but in there there is a seed that was predestined before the foundation of the world amen now notice life is a sacred thing to God the prophet said and it's recorded in a book and God is the author of life in another message he says God never forgets all of our Deeds are recorded on The Book of Life all of our Deeds now brother Branham explains it speaking to the bride he said see our natural life here that we have is just the perversion it really should be the right life to begin with but it's perverted by the natural birth the first life everybody say the first life or your first Union you were joined in at Birth by Nature a natural act a natural human being being associated a natural human being associated see man and woman together Associated together in sexual Affair which brought your first life here and that's associated with sin and death so brother Branham talks about our first life which is our first nature it's a life that was is a perverted Life by our natural birth and if you notice brother Brandon talks about it uh maybe an invisible Union of the Bride where he talks about he mentions our first life our first husband our first nature everything first right first first that's all we've known so he calls it our first uh that's that's that's the beginning of what we understand right our first born in sin condemned wretched miserable yeah maybe a prostitute maybe a drunk maybe maybe a liar a thief whatever see so he says now it was nature associated with death right associated with death your first husband that had rule over you was your Nature by natural birth natural see you love the world because you are of the world part of the world your desires was by nature to love the world see which you're a part of you see that's your natural thing that's the reason you have to be born again don't ever try to be a Christian by that natural birth thing has got to dismiss that to separate you have to die to that first husband you can't live with it you can't just say well I'll divorce him and hang him up here till occasion no certain writing of divorcement he dies everybody say he dies that nature dies that's the thing see the nature of the world has to die every Speck of him has to die you have to be reunited again with another nature ain't that right now that's what God's Ministry is all about is to bring another nature see a lot of people look at the Ministries that are today bypass the new birth joining in church as long as you're fine you feel good that's fine and it's got to the place where they they dismiss the sins forgive the sins talk about the Catholic Church you know you have to pay go to the priest and pay your Penance and all that and then you're fine you can lie you can be whatever you want to and just as long as you make your confession and then then they write it off but God doesn't write it off that way see so so so the their the ministry of God is to bring a new birth what what is that there them seeds them names have got to be quickened ain't that right yes sir so then your name of your first nature was born and put in a book of life all your Deeds was wrote in it too everything you've done under that nature by say under that nature under that nature was put in a book called The Book of Life ain't that right so so then what you did as a sinner is recorded in the Book of Life and you realize people are going to be judged by that book sure are let's look at it Daniel 7 is this all right Daniel 7 9 I beheld till the Thrones were cast down and the Ancient of Days did sit whose garments garment was white as snow and the hair of his head was like pure wool his throne was like a fiery flame and his wheels as burning fire a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him thousands and thousands ministered unto him and tens Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand stood before him and the Judgment was sent and the books were open Revelations 20 and 12 and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were open and another book was open which is The Book of Life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works and the Sea gave up the dead which were in it death and Hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works see men are going to be judged according to their works hello that's right politicians can get away with what they're doing but they're coming to this book right here they're going to be judged they they can pull all kinds of schemes and dictators and all that but they all every one of them both small and great it's going to come to this book right here and be judged and they're going to stand before the white Throne judgment there will be no blood to atone for them ain't that right now brother Brown said think of it the only thing that'll back off God is blood the only thing that's going to back him off is blood and there's only one blood that he'll back away from and that's his own son when he sees that his that's his own son's blood he'll back away back see because that's the gift see God is given to his son to redeem God gave us his son to redeem those who he foreknew and it brings God back from his judgment aren't you glad for that this is what the ministry of God is all about is that God could have fellowship with those predestinated elect but when that blood is removed and all that was foreknown has been called into the precious body his church has been ready made ready and taken up then God's Wrath is on the people oh brother don't ever want to stand there don't let me stand before a machine or he says let me stand before machine gun let me be cut to Pieces let me be sold inch by inch let anything happen as the oath of the Knights of Columbus let them split open my belly and burn sulfur and everything in me and my arms and legs cut off whatever it may be but never let me stand at the white Throne judgment before God it isn't going to be a pretty day that day can you say Amen but I want to say this the elect everybody say the elect will never have to stand there the elect will never have that's what the ministry of God was all about it'll never have to stand there and I want to just say this you ought to appreciate the baptism of the Holy Ghost you ought to appreciate the Holy Ghost when it leads you away and convicts you of your wrongs and I'll say this you ought to appreciate a man of God that'll preach this message I don't care if it skins you I don't care if it blows everything away from you and you're just left standing just a few feathers at least God had his Mercy to tell you where you're wrong so you don't have to stand there before the white Throne judgment it's the ministry of God what is it God's preserving life ain't that right the elect will never have to stand before the white Throne judgment why they were separated from their first Union I was separated are you separated separated from that First Union my first nature my spiritual death ain't that right remember your first husband was your first Nature by your natural birth but no longer are you accounted of that no longer do you walk by that no longer does God look at you as that you've been divorced you're separated that old Nature has died your first husband has died yet you may be full of mistakes but it's not a counter to you you may fall down but as brother Terry reminded me of that scripture what is it the righteous may fall down seven times but God will lift him up can you say man why there's a blood in this ministry there's a power of reconciliation and when God once does the work it's over now notice brother Brown says now see your natural desire is to cut your hair your natural desires to wear shorts and paint your face and I'm gonna put it this way your natural desires to see what how far you can go without sinning these these ladies that are putting her pants on under their skirts I think it's hypocritical I think they need a new birth yeah but I can't go skiing unless I can't go and do things that boys do unless God didn't call you to be a boy God didn't call you to act like a boy be satisfied with what God called you to be hey yes all right not on cause you to charge you anything that was free but you see we're not here to see what we can get by with to get away with well let's just see how far brother Brown said if there's a question to it don't do it and the problem is people ain't got their convictions anymore and they ain't their conscience are seared to where there's no questions they've gotten so far to say I'll do it anyways and what they're doing is they're pushing that conscience back they're silenced that voice to where now they're able to do anything walk where Angel well the Bible word the Bible or the the poem walk with hobner's shoes Where Angels Fear to trod uce that's what happens in a rebellious age well I'm going to do whatever no preacher going to tell me what to do my parents ain't gonna tell me what to do I'll have to live by rules buddy you're going to live by God's rules and you may not do it right here you may get away with it you may be sneaky you may be slappy ain't gonna let the pastor know what I'm doing you know I'm just everybody just want to talk about me and all this just just just I'm going to just do it go ahead and do it do it I don't care but one of these days you're gonna answer to your creator by the books can you say amen and I say to you young people humble yourself to the word of God pants humble yourself preachers humble yourself every one of us humble ourselves to God's headship there's blood there the only way you can do it though is by your nature being divorced died dead gone your natural desires to cut your hair trim your hair your natural desires to wear makeup or a little Shadow to where nobody can see it natural desire is to wear shorts and I'm going to tell you boys too and you men don't wear shorts you're a panty waste you're a sassy when you do it and you're putting on women's undergarments you say well I had one tell me so well I wear shorts and I can I'd be in my church and I love him to death still love him we're buddies we're friends we wore shorts I told him I said you need to quit wearing your shorts well this way just stay cool I said Brandon said they're a so what does it do a week two weeks later so look what I found and his brother Branham in in shorts in Africa does it say yeah I said buddy I don't care what that picture says I'm telling you what that Prophet told us to do don't wear shorts I don't know why he was that way I don't understand but all I know is we don't wear shorts and what the prophet said they were there were women's undergarments he's still wearing his shorts but and his children are disarray whatever that's okay I still love him we're friends may God do what he got to do but see your natural desires to be intellectual be a smart man whether it's getting behind the pulpit and just saying everything just right and saying your nice deep words that no one can understand except just a few to be intellectual to know something better than the other he said that's what Eve wanted that's the very thing she wanted that's what eve took and she was pregnated with that kind of pregnation and that's what the church is today Bible schools intellectuals look everyone disagreeing with the other a big mess just exactly what the Bible said it's Babylon Babylon exists by the first nature get out of Babylon you only can do that by your nature dying got to be dead to that first nature if you ain't dead by that first nature that first nature ain't did your first husband ain't dead you'll stay in Babylon even living and setting in a message Church so your love of the world come by your first nature everything you did as a sinner comes by your first nature now first John 2 and 15 love not the world neither the things that are in the world any If any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and that is inspired of Satan ain't that right so see how does the world become appealing by your first nature through your first birth the world is appealing amen yes sir now it says the spirit that you have come to you by Nature see and by Nature coming from sexual intercourse desired by man and woman produces an Earthly child let that child alone and don't teach him nothing right you'll go wrong don't teach him neither right nor wrong he'll go wrong because it's his nature to do such ain't that right it's the nature That's what Satan works on is the first nature that first nature can be religious that first nature can rule the Bible that first nature can go to church and lift up hands and worship that first nature can do a lot of things but it cannot separate from the world ain't that right but notice Ephesians 2 and 4 but God everybody say but God who is rich in Mercy his ministry is full of Mercy to his elect his his ministry calls to everyone that God knows before the foundation of the world that only that elect is going to be touched by that Ministry the prophet went around the world seven times but only to the elect it was called for God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead and sins hath quickened us together so then that great love wherewith he loved us he must have been talking about an elect he loved us that he left ain't that right for even when we were were everybody say were not even while we are even when we were past tense sins dead in sins half he quickened us together in with Christ by Grace you are saved and hath raised us up who that elect raised us up together and made us sit together in heaven places in Christ brother Brown said see you separated from your first Union by spiritual death now you are born again or remarried again to the new spiritual union of not your natural life of the things of the world but of eternal life that germ that was in you at the beginning found you found you aren't you glad I found you hallelujah hallelujah what a wretched people we were but it found us that germ of life from the foundation of the world found us amen no matter how deep in sin a person can go if there's a germ of life you'll find them amen don't you worry about your incapabilities don't you worry about whatever you are if that germ of Life can find you that's it ain't that right so listen now that germ that was in you at the beginning found you now your old book is gone with your old Union amen amen amen you can't be judged by it no more all your works as a sinner's gone it's over it's done it's divorce you died with that old nature and you're that died with you that died everything died your past died oh Satan will bring it up but that's all he can do that's not you no more that was what you used to be that was the first that it was not the wheat that was the carrier if you want to call it that now what you've come into is that which was in the beginning in God's mind you found you now your old book has gone with your old Union and your name in your old in your he said has been transferred your name's not in the Book of Life it's been transferred hello you say well I thought my name was always in the book life it is it has been but you're now coming to realize it [Music] you're now coming to realize it you with me that's why not all the all scriptures in this Bible applies to you there's some scriptures that apply to the foolish virgin there's some scriptures that apply to the ungodly the unrighteous bet them scriptures that apply to you doesn't apply to them amen your name's been transferred you know you're common to the reality of what you are to begin with in the beginning now now you can understand the justification you're Justified as though you never did it you're Justified as though you never did remember what program explains the justification you heard that I was drunk you heard that I was drunk and you come up and but he said I really didn't do it but you heard I did but I didn't but you come up to me and you say I forgive you brother Adam right and he says well forgive me for what I never did it you were going off of a rumor you've given you you've gone off someone what someone told you but I'd never did it in the first place so your past is just a rumor you don't want to believe rumors especially about your past because you're Justified you never did it in the first place so now your name see has been transferred now you say do you mean to tell me that my old book well see God put it in the sea of his forgetfulness now a person can justify you my mom tries to justify her children but we all know how rotten he is right but there's something about a mama's love that she's willing to overlook it and she may not just understand why everybody just don't like that little boy or that little girl or whatever but we know they put sugar in in in you know in our milk they'll do something else you know and so we've been bit right but mama don't see that so even though we see whatever Mama can't justify it that he can't justify parents can't justify but God is the only justifier now what what blows my mind and well I think is the miracle he's an infinite god with an infinite mind knowingly in from the beginning he knows every time a beef a flea that's a sign he knows every time that the Bumblebee and every flap that a bumblebee makes he knows the breath the depth of the breath that every animal the flea the the bee every bee every flea he knows the depth of the breath he knows every time the heart is beating and how many times and all that he's so infinite and yet he puts your sins in the sea of forgetfulness that he can't even remember aren't you glad for the ministry of God [Applause] he can't remember so then he sets himself as our judge thank God for that while there's blood right yeah then he sets himself as our return attorney so here you're sitting in the courtroom and the accuser the Devil he's got his fouls of your past and he's accusing you before God the judge and yet now God is sitting here being our attorney fighting for us and the judge says but what proof do you have he's got all of his proof what proof do you have that he never did it he's a father I've got my blood to show I died for him I've taken their place so good is the blood that the Father the judge dismisses the case and the devil is bewildered he's dumbfounded he thought he had a good case against us and found out he has no case can you say man now you could imagine as we've said before that if if a man if a man becomes let's say the Syria serial killer they just can't stop it because because of his nature and he's he's killed 20 people when the in the in the Years spans of time ain't going to do it again it goes to the court you know and and maybe he gets him a lawyer that was a school buddy the lawyer remembers how there's been School Chums and all that and he tells the judge he says well judge he said I know he's bad and I know he's guilty and all that but man we were good buddies back then he had it really going for him and all these things I don't know what's happened but but but uh uh you know I I really like him as a friend he's a judge how about I take his place I'll go to death for him and what if the judge says okay all right if you're willing to do that take his take his place then you go right ahead well Billy Bob goes free but the problem is is it didn't help Billy Bob at all he's still a serial killer he's still got the nature he's gonna do it again and one of these days he's gonna run out of friends ain't that right amen so it might as well just been Billy Bob uh uh you know because the lawyer died in vain but here was our judge and our or our lawyer he's i'll take his place father but there was a plan for this he couldn't he he couldn't help us if he didn't take our place but he died to take our place to help us that he could put his spirit in US now what if that lawyer could live in Billy Bob say I'll die but I'll come back in Billy Bob then what happens then Billy Bob is no longer a serial killer he becomes the lawyer he becomes dressed up as a decent citizen why because there's something else that's in him ain't that right and we're only sons of God by the spirit of God living inside of us no longer are we Sinners we're Christians no longer are we unbelievers we're believers because God's believing through us God living through us God having preeminence in US you love the Lord the wonderful so it says now see God put it in the sea of forgetfulness you stand perfectly before God now your name is now in the new book not the book of life but the Lamb's Book of Life what the lamb redeemed not the old book of your natural Union but your new bride your new life is in the Lamb's Book of Life your marriage certificate Hallelujah where your true Eternal germ from the beginning takes hold you're not now you're not only forgiven but you're Justified ain't that right so we just all got we got through all of that see so he said see the word Justified is as though you never did it it's not even regarded at all how is it done in the God's book of the sea of forgiveness your old book and marriage is divorced and dead it's not even in the memories of God don't try to remind God something he can't even remember if the musicians will come you're Justified therefore being justified see it was accused you was accused but you've never done it in the first place the old Union is in the sea of God's forgetfulness you wasn't married to it to begin with see he the bridegroom bore your shame himself for you and your place he took your place for you were predestinated for him to be in his bride before the foundation of the world the Bible said so you are the predestinated seed how did you come to do this you were deceived into it by your first marriage to your adulterous parent Eve it's no fault of your own by your natural birth you come after Eve who committed adultery that's the reason you was born in an adulteress say you're a sinner to begin with you was deceived into it no it ain't your fault you never did it because that little germ that was in you was to be you before the foundation of the world and God put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life so hope you understand the purpose of God's Ministry I am come that you may have life and have it more abundantly people's got this perverted idea that this is life having money is life having the wealth is life having all the riches and Comforts of world is life no that ain't the life it was everything you do as a sinner is going to be judged but he come that you may have life not to destroy you but to give you life that you may live before him as what he called you to be before the foundation of the world brother Brown said Christ died to save those who God by foreknowledge elected to meet him Yonder without spot or wrinkle before the foundation of the world he's seen you in glory that's what the Bible said Ephesians the first chapter Fifth Fifth chapter first verse God predestinated by foreknowledge if God did that predestinated us before the foundation world and knew every one of us by name before the foundation of the world and he elected us to eternal life and sent Jesus Christ to redeem us that 6 000 years ago he saw us that we might appear to his Praises in glory how can you ever be lost now if you're saved you're saved ain't that right if you're saved you're saved [Music] if God Saves you tonight knowing he's going to lose you in 10 years from today he's defeating his own purpose the infinite Almighty Eternal Everlasting wisdom God doesn't know enough to know then to know whether you'll hold out or whether you won't then when he saves you you say well I'll give him a try we'll see what he I'll see what he'll do then he doesn't know the end from the beginning God knows what he's doing don't you never worry about that I don't care how low you've been God knows what he's doing don't you ever worry about that [Music] see it's you and I stumbling alone but God knows what he's doing and he knew whether we had hold out or what we would do then you say Amen you love him I got one more to read to you I know I got a lot more to go but he says the spiritual man today the spiritual woman that's elected predestinated of God come to eternal life if they have to sell everything they've got if they have to take their name off of every Church book in the nation they still want that Birthright it's the only thing that matters to them just get that birth right that's all no matter how and what level they have to come on if they have to get down at the altar and cry boohoo if they have to run through the places and go back and make things right and sell what they got or give away everything they have and become a pilgrim and a stranger it doesn't matter they want the birthright that's a that's all they're interested in is the birthright and notice what brother Brown says now don't blame them people they can't help it they were predestinated to that elected to it can you say amen and we're willing to be called fools for Christ aren't we we're willing to do it all for Christ you can't help it we were predestinated for it you love him isn't he wonderful amen what song the battle is over Victory is one it's already done can you sing that now it's already done

redeemed are gathered in oh when the redeemed are gathering in wash like snow free from all sin I will shout I will sing when the redeemed are gathering in well I am thinking of the Rapture in our blessed home on High when the redeemed hard gathering in well how we'll raise the Heavenly Anthem in that City in the sky when the redeemed are gathered in oh when the redeemed are gathering in oh what's like snow free from all sin I will shout I will sing when the redeemed our gathering well there will be a great possession over on the streets of gold when redeemed are gathering in what news musical what singing or the city will be rolled when the redeemed are gathering in oh when the redeemed oh our gathering in we'll watch like snow and free from all sin how will shout how we'll sing when the redeemed are gathering in well now Saints will sing with the story [Music] redeemed I gathering in Lane Gavin then the angels all will listen for they cannot join that song when the redeemed are gathering in oh oh when the redeemed are you gonna be there what a day it's gonna be Church let's know they're free from all sin oh I will shout oh and how we'll see let's sing that third verse well now Saints will sing Redemption story with their voices clear and strong when they redeemed I like that see the angels will all listen listen amen what a what a day it's gonna be oh and redeem our gathering in wash like snow free from all sin how will shout how we'll sing when reading our gathering in the end then the Savior will give orders to prepare the banquet board with the redeem I gathering in oh we'll hear his invitation Come Ye blessed of the Lord when the wind redeemed are gathering in it ain't gonna be much longer whole winter redeem our gathering in wash like snow free

how will shout how we'll see hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you know just just my thinking just my thinking if I thought of that as the angel singing standing there watching the redeemed they must be rewarded too it must be a reward for them to see the redeemed there because they were given charge over us they were given charge to help our faith to help us to believe to help us through our hard times the angels of the lord always watching us and then when we enter in it must be something for them to look and say ah they made it they all have to bow their heads because they don't know what we're singing about but oh what a day it's going to be and all the work is over and it actually shuts the Angels up that we have the chance to sing praises unto God isn't that wonderful singing praises to your name oh Lord praises to your name oh God for your name is great and greatly to as we close sing it one more time how I love that name oh how I love that oh God how I love the name oh God for your name is Grace and Grace Softly God bless you remember service at 4 30. this afternoon just may God be with us in a great way speak to our hearts brother Doug would you
