the Lord's blessed us with a beautiful day today and we thank the lord always for that and if you have your Bibles we're just gonna go right in to the word here this evening uh Philippians the fourth

brother Junior woosley keep his wife in prayer she's recovering she's just had a really rough time of it and I think she's had two hip replacements and um so and both went bad and so she's been in a lot of pain we actually went toxic to him uh her not just yeah toxic in her blood system and um so but I think she's on the mend and um so we just want to keep her in our prayer that the little helper she said to have when they went back in there and done surgery on her and um having to do the hips again and just a lot of I guess just a lot of things went on there brother Jr was telling me that over the weekend and and so we keep her in our prayer amen before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to the Lord and hear him father we're so glad our life is in your hands Lord and we have this Blessed assurance that we can make it we will make it Lord I believe we have made it for it's all in your predestinated plan your purpose father and Lord what you have decreed before the foundation of the world is now being manifested in our lives father you never promised a bed of roses a life of ease that you did promise that you would be with this Lord and that you would bring

bless your people anoint them as our prayer father we give you all praise and glory in Jesus Christ's name amen the first uh or Philippians their chapter 4. and we've been reading this verse here but it's in the eighth verse finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are good of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the peace of God shall be with you amen you can have your seats this evening and I want to continue with the thought meditating on the positive and we have so much negative that is out there in the world and very few people really know the positive but I'm glad that we do know what the positive is and and that we can meditate there on because not all meditation is approved of God or acceptable and um but we we find that Paul tells us here what to think on and and it's important that our thinking or um is is right for Proverbs 23 and 7. uh we we know that uh it says as a man thinketh in his heart so is he as as he thanketh and so uh as a man thinketh so is he and uh and and he says in his heart so what we think on or meditate on in our heart it shows what kind of individual we are it shows what what we who we are we've talked about it um um the five senses of the of our body which your taste smell hears sight and feel um you you can't go by that because one moment it'll be positive and the other moment it won't be positive I um it's kind of like um uh I've uh had just I've got a lot of stiffness in my neck and um you know it's just I guess either part of just growing up or what uh Growing Pains I guess and so but anyways man you know it just uh hurts well the other day I woke up no pain whatsoever man I was feeling great and I was really thanking the lord for it and uh man I was so excited and uh three hours later back again you know and so uh I really learned right then that your body backslides on you and so you can't depend on your body and um and so it'll be positive one moment negative the next then you got your five senses of the spirit that are imagination reasoning conscience affection and uh memory and that will be positive one moment and then turn around and be negative the next and so but these things these things don't tell what you are your body doesn't tell what you are and and your spirit don't tell what you are but it says as a man thinketh in his heart so is he and and so now Satan Works through these senses just as God does as as we know and I'm just going to be simple and uh but hopefully to help somebody but Satan Works through these senses God works through these senses and but it's in your soul what you are in your soul is is what counts because it's in your soul as the prophet taught us uh uh that that's where the control tower is and so then if that's the case and there's only one sense or gate whatever to the soul in that self-will free moral agent and and so and then another place brother Brown says is Faith or doubt and so if you keep that in mind uh but it's in the soul that that that's the control tower that's really what you are you got your body and you got your spirit but then then you are in the soul that that's that's really what counts and so uh then that means that we're not a slave to any of our senses five senses of the body but we are not slaves to it uh five senses of the spirit but we're not slaves to it ain't that right now you know every day I I say every day we have two different reports that come to us through our senses uh senses of the Flesh and senses of her spirit and one report is positive it's it's all positive and then the other report is of course the negative and it has to be now for it's it's called The Law of contrast ain't that right and so uh by by our sense of sight we see what God says in his word if you read the Bible which you should always uh read your Bible brother Brown said a Christian reads and prays every day reads his Bible and prays every day but but there's a reason that we would read because our site picks this up and you read you see what is in the scriptures and and you know we see the Miracles that God has uh performs um whether you know it it be among us or whether uh whatever but but we see that God performs Miracles ain't that rhyme uh uh and it don't even have to be you know a lot of the miracles happen every day that we see like the rising of the sun and the setting of The Sun that's a miracle uh when we're we're looking now that the trees have been so dead and all that but look at the grass changing uh from brown to green and and the the the leaves are now uh coming on the trees that's a miracle yes it happens so silently it happens just so unknown to us but it's still a mirror miracle and and we see these things I mean uh all of these things because what we're seeing is a resurrection of Life uh in the trees the flowers the grass and it testifies to us that there is a a resurrection and it causes us to rejoice and and to praise God I I I I don't think that you could uh read the promises of God see it with your eyes to see what God says without getting excited about it I I don't think you can see Miracles with your eyes and and not not get excited in and think of God ain't that right well God gives us our eyesight so we can be reminded of his word his promises his faithfulness his goodness and his power and and all of these things and and God allows the sick uh you know sickness he allows deformity he allows these things and then he comes with his mighty hand and and causes the blind to see the ears to start hearing the lame to start walking I've seen I've seen tripled get out of the wheelchair I've seen blind eyes come open we've seen I've seen that with my own eyes brother shalom and and and and these things and God just loves to do that and and he does it so your eyes can see it uh uh and it testifies of who he is but also on the other hand these eyes have seen tragedy and we've seen you know horror and and I don't you know we've we've uh uh if you've come on a wreck or something and it's just horrible and maybe someone's died and and uh or you've seen a fire or you've seen uh just just tragedy that has taken place and and well you know so uh as as our eyes look on things that God does then are also our eyes look on that on the things that maybe the devil is working through and so so we we see things that we want to see but then then we also see things that we don't want to see and and so but uh you know so so uh you know we we pray a lot of those times for God to move in a situation and and we see that things haven't changed uh we keep saying the same thing and and you know and people get affected by them things you know you're praying and praying and you're praying and and you know um I I think of uh just like my dad uh example you know he's he's got the Parkinson's and he's shaking and and uh he's real weak he can you know hardly walk and sometimes he can't even walk and and we see that right and and but yet we're praying for a miracle and but yet as as every time we're praying we believe in we're confessing and then you see with your natural eye that it's getting worse well then Satan is trying to take what you're seeing and affect you in some way well so we're seeing what the Bible says I'm the god that healeth all thy diseases ain't that right and and and so we're seeing that with our eyes and yet we're seeing this with our eyes and and and we're seeing two contrary different things uh opposite things and and so um so maybe we pray for someone you know that to get better in their health and then we see that the situation is getting worse well this is this allows Satan to work on us uh uh so we're seeing a good report we're we're seeing a bad report and and and these things and and so how many people have seen others you know in in some kind of Affliction and maybe they've died from that Affliction and then and then uh the the that person that saw that they're Afflicted with that PR that the same disease that this individual died with and and of course Satan goes to work you know on that well I saw what they done and and then he tries to put fear on them by what they saw you understand what I'm saying and and so uh uh uh you know so so Satan works with uh you know our sight as much is God works on our with our sight as well also by our sense of hearing we hear what the minister says about God's word we Rejoice at what we hear how many times uh we we rejoiced at the ministering of the word of God to hear the promises and and and I'll be honest I've I get excited when I hear a prophet the prophet preach and playing the tapes and there's something he says that I catch it with my ear hearing and I rejoice in that eyes amen that's right you know and and and and that's wonderful but then we also hear things that we don't want to hear that we don't need to hear you understand what I'm saying and so we'll hear the good and we'll hear the bad it's it's both negative and positive and and yet none of that determines Who You Are you can hear the badge you can hear the good you can see the badge you can see the the good and yet none of that determines as to what you are because it's it's what's in your soul ain't that right now what report you sink on and you receive then that shows what you are in your soul can you say amen and I want you young people to really understand this that your conversion doesn't happen in your body your conversion doesn't really happen in your spirit your conversion happens in your soul yeah that that's that's where that's where it's got to happen and you are a a gene seed in your soul ain't that rhyme brother Branham would say the real ordained of God that real Gene that real germ a soul of God that was in God before the foundation of the world another place he says your physical context the physical your spiritual context the spiritual but inside of that you've got a soul and that soul is the gene that come from God ain't that rhyme so the Warfare the battle that goes on it's a daily thing uh that that that we go through it's just like you you you hear the word today uh both services and and maybe God's speaking to you and you're hearing that well it's it's it's a given fact I guarantee you you will hear something down tomorrow or the week and something to that effect that'll be horrible that'll be bad that'll be a negative that'll be a it's just common it's just the law of contrast ain't that right and and so it it's it's just a guarantee and God allows these things he he allows you to sit and hear the promises and he will also allow you to sit and hear all the negative and and and all of these things and so you're not only affected by positive things you're going to be affected by negative things you you could sit here and say you know by by the end of the services and all that you know I've been in them in Services where I just feel like I'm on the Mountaintop brother Amos I feel like man I'm I'm a really first kid I'm a real believer I'm really gonna make it you know and and then by the next day or so then all of a sudden everything I thought everything I've tested everything you know or everything that I've said confessed everything I heard is now being put to the test ain't that right I don't feel like I'm gonna make it I kind of wonder if I will I wonder you know and and then you wonder well I wonder where God just went you know and and because you was on the Mountaintop and now here you are and everything is just backslid my emotions have backslid my sensation well everything else you know because you cannot depend upon these five senses ain't that right so so here so we go through the battle and a lot of times you young people may not understand these battles I know I didn't and and sometimes you know uh it's just been by God's grace that we're we're we we get settled and but I don't think that you have to be an adult to be settled I I think if you could really understand the tactics of the enemy and and because a lot of times you'll go through battles and you'll see that here the negative you'll you'll see the negative you'll think thoughts negative thoughts and all these things and Satan will try to put it on you as though it's you the one that's thinking them things he does now if you have the Holy Ghost then you are sealed until the day of your Redemption Ephesians 4 30 and grief not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed everybody say I'm sealed I'm sealed you are sealed into the day of what first trial the day of redemption ain't that right now so what does a seal represent a finished work I think that's awesome a seal represents a finished work that means that God when he seals you it's over he's at rest with you he's approved of you so now notice he says now the box cars loaded and the seal is on it it's completed can you say that with me it's completed it's finished right it's bound for its destination woe to anyone who will break the seal ain't that right see another place they are sealed unto their Eternal destination there's not nothing can ever break that seal aren't you glad for that there's nothing so it's the grace of God that he gives you the Holy Ghost now why is God going to give you the Holy Ghost to seal you up now the devil can't touch you you're no longer a slave to him it's over make that right now brother Ryan said you take a boxcar they'll start loading it and loading it on the track many of you people here he said I know some of you little cards he says they'll go around and they'll call for so much here and so much here there but before that car can be sealed the inspector has to come along he looks through and sees that everything's in there is tight and everything's ready it's going to its destination well if there's anything loose and afraid it'll break he will say take her out and fix her over again till you get it and when it's all together tightened and packed and set down then he will slam the doors and seal it and no one can break that seal until it goes to its Eternal death or till its debt to its destination so now where is that seal is it on your flesh is it on your spirit it's on your soul ain't that right that's the only place that the devil has no claim to it's the only place that the devil has no right to is your soul he can he can afflict your body he can mess with your spirit he can go through them uh use them five gates of the flesh five gates of the of of of the spirit but he cannot get to that soul if you are sealed can you say man with the Seal of God and the Seal of God is the Holy Ghost ain't that right now it goes the other way too there there's and and this is where we're at today and this is why the prophet would preach uh uh the Seal of God and the Seal of of Satan and the Seal of the Antichrist or whatever there but he he talks about two seals ain't that right because this is where we're at is the two seals and and so uh uh the word of God do you realize as Satan cannot get to a person that is sealed uh uh Satan can't touch him that the word of God also can't touch a person that's been sealed in their soul uh by the devil now see so so if they have the Seal of Satan then that's then the word of God can't touch so a seal Works two waves you know that which is inside if you notice brother Brown talking about that boxcar and they they make sure that it's there everything is in there before he seals the door shut now now what what's he doing what's that inspector doing and remember brother Brown says the inspector shuts the door right puts that seal on what has he just done everything that's in that boxcar is sealed in and everything that's not in that boxcar is sealed out ain't that right that that that's that that's right see so so what is sealed in can't leak out and what's sealed out cathly can it's it's sealed ain't that right so if you have the Holy Ghost then the Seal of God Amen uh uh it seals things that are uh uh it seals in you things that should be in there there's things that that are in you that are sealed in and there's things that are on the outside that are sealed out it can't get to you ain't that right again Satan can affect you in in in both the spirit Rim flesh Rim but he's sealed out from that Soul he can't touch you there ain't that right so then we find that faith if if you've got the spirit of God then then faith is sealed in and unbelief is sealed out the word of God is sealed in and the the world is sealed out God is sealed in right and Satan is sealed out that's right now notice brother Branham said a seal is the security can I ask you how many feel secure it's a security now I know we're in a world of turmoil and there's you know we got alarms security alarms and all that and homes and houses businesses churches and all of these things but what about a security for us people all the time looking for security wanting to wanting to uh be secure from the thief wanting to be secure from the murderer want to be secure a man from the the people that's going to steal and and do damage and and all of these things in other words they want security to to things that don't belong in their home ain't that right well God purchased you he he he he he he bought you with the price you are the Church of the Living God and you are the Tabernacle of God ain't that right so he's not going to depend on you to seal all these things in he's going to seal it in ain't that right it's it's for his per it's his home you you you're you're you're the Temple of the Holy Ghost ain't that right so he is going to seal his home up to where no devil and Intruder can come in and take away your joy take away your faith steal steal steal all the attributes of God out of your life take the power away from you he's going to seal it up can you say Amen now you ought to feel secure because that's what a seal means is that you are secured well who is who secured you God did ain't that right so now he said you that don't believe in eternal security I don't know but a seal signifies security to its destination that's why he can already know you're coming that's why he does things ahead of time he's got your theophany already waiting he's got your seat at the table already waiting why he sealed you it's a security ain't that right so he says see a seal signifies security to its destination woe unto that guy that would try to break that seal and the Holy Spirit seal everybody say the Holy Spirit seal cannot be broken it can he said you've all heard me say that people said the devil made me do this no no no the devil didn't do that you just wasn't sealed in ain't that right so then because when you're sealed in he's sealed out when you're sealed in he's sealed out you understand that church that's why you don't have to walk in fear when you're sealed in he's sealed out he he can hust and puff and try to blow your house down but he can't do it there's a security ain't that rotten so we're not running around like the little old pigs and and running from the big bad wolf we've already been sealed in isn't that right and so he says see he says now when you're sealed in he's sealed out now you went out to him he could not get to you because the only way he could get to you is is come to the same process that you've had you had see he said he'd have to be saved Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost didn't be your brother so he didn't do it no you just went to the borderline and come back listen for the things of the world he never went all the way over into Canaan land across Jordan to death itself can you say man or death to self that's right so when it comes to the kingdom of God a man can be sealed in and he can be sealed out ain't that right a man that is sealed out of the Kingdom what will happen he will serve the devil the rest of his life ain't that right why because the word can't get to him anymore he can't believe the word he can't subject to the word for there's nothing there to believe with there's nothing the prophet said there's nothing in him to believe with why he sealed out so if you've when you've got the Holy Ghost we ought to be the most thankful people that's why brother Brown said a Christian cannot uh what was that crossed come to that line of of where he can't come back a Believer cannot uh trying to think of that word blaspheme a Christian can't do that a Believer can't why he's sealed in every qualification in uh is sealed in in him you don't have to beg to be a Christian it's sealed in you ain't that right but if if it's sealed out now then there's nothing in there notice the devil see the devil that lives in them won't let them believe their their eyes are blinded from truth and they can't believe they haven't got nothing to believe with ain't that right how can I move a hand if I ain't got a hand to move with how can I believe God when I'm just looking at a word here and him not in here see you've got to have God in here first before you can believe ain't that right it takes God to do that now I I I pray that I can get across my heart to you what I I want to get across now notice brother Brown said you you got to get the man right in his heart first before he can believe ain't that right get God in your heart before you can believe but when he's there in your heart well then he seals he seals doubt out unbelief out skepticism out criticism out he he seals it all out and Satan no longer has his way with you why you're sealed to your destination I think it's time that we Holy Ghost Field Believers quit begging God for things quit act like we ain't got anything if we're sealed with the Holy Ghost everything that you have need of is already sealed in you we're not deprived people we're not waiting for God to do something spectacular the best thing he could have done for you is give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's your seal praise the Lord so he says you've got to get the man right in his heart first before he can believe he ain't got nothing to believe on see he ain't got nothing to believe with I'm sure the little infant brain of the man knows nothing about belief he's got to have something in there uh that stimulates his faith and makes him look Yonder to his creator so you could not believe without him helping see but he comes in and stimulates your faith it makes a man look Yonder to his creator and believes the very god brother Brown makes a blowing sound see he blew the moon and stars off his hands and can do all the thing all these things well what happened God come into that heart he's the one that's stimulating the faith he's the one that's stimulating everything I'm gonna seal it up for his home brother Brian goes all the way back to predestination that a man has to be predestinated to believe brother Branham you know we all know the story talk to Dr best and um that I didn't believe in Divine Healing he was a Baptist or claimed to be and didn't believe in Divine Healing and he made fun of it and so he wrote in the in the paper that brother Branham was an imposter and uh that was imposing himself as a servant of God and needed to be run out of town and he would like to be the man to do that and so he challenged brother Branham to a debate and and brother Brandon would not accept the challenge and brother Branham explained why he wouldn't accept the challenge and and I I thought it was good he said all the fussing you could do with that man he'd walk away with the same belief he had when he come in see you don't get nothing by fussing Jesus didn't come to fuss he just done what the father told him if they believed it all right if they didn't all right anyhow see so after all if God confirms the word see Jesus said if you can't believe me why believe the works that I do then see them believe the works that I do that the father has sent me and so brother Ram goes on we were having about 8 000 people now and there was about seven thousand of them wanting to be prayed for and and to give one of these nights to fuss with that preacher and the only thing you do is he's going to go away he's born he if he's born an unbeliever God made him an unbeliever and how's he going to be anything else but an unbeliever see God predestinated a man men of old was forordained to this condemnation the Bible says see so if they can't believe everybody say if they can't believe if they can't believe it's just like pouring water from a duck's back they can't believe they ain't got nothing to believe with ain't that right see then what is it their whole soul is subject to the devil no matter what God does no matter the supernatural that God performs no matter what he could come down in flesh in person and they still wouldn't believe it remember that man that told Brother Brown said I don't care how many miracles you do I still won't believe it brother Brown said certainly not you're an unbeliever what he ain't got nothing to believe with ain't that right so you'll never convince him to be a Christian but you think of the man that's been predestinated to believe think of the man that God has come into that soul and sealed it up no trial is big enough no devil is big enough no hell is hot enough that's why you're standing today ain't that right you can take you can take all your trials and you can take all the horror and all these things that that P you see you hear you witness and the the things that you you you you you you go through on a daily basis and you know what it's just like pouring water on a duck's back it ain't gonna affect you because the soul has been sealed away so what is it so a man that sealed out the kingdom faith is sealed out and unbelief is sealed in so brother Graham said a person has to be ordained of God to believe or they'll never believe anyhow they have nothing to believe with they just don't have no depths of their soul now Satan can affect your physical body as we said he can he can affect you mentally in your mind ain't that right he can affect you in your spirit but that has nothing to do with you being lost because the seal is on your soul Satan will make you feel like you're lost he will try his best to make you look at the circumstance instead of God's word ain't that right he works on our emotions our memory our Sensations our affections he works with what we see with what we hear with what we uh feel what we taste what all of these things but that doesn't mean that he has you I want you to really understand that young people it doesn't mean that he has you you'll wake up on the wrong side of the bed tomorrow feel grumpy feel Moody fill out a sort I don't mean you ain't a Christian give it next week hopefully you'll wake up on the other side of the bed but what I like about real Believers and and you young people understand this because you've got a lot of oak trees if I could say it that way a lot of oak trees brother random looked at at the evolves Bosworth as an oak tree and he told tell Osborne you said under that oak tree learn and you've got a lot of oak trees here tonight that and and hey I know how it is I know I know how Satan works it gets you it's so isolated in your own mind to where you think you're the only individual that is going through things to where you think that you're the only one that's got problems have you all ever been there I've been there and you know I've had to be reminded by other people that they got problems too I remember when I lost my wife you know I I was you know I was about crazy and I just thought I was really going through something and someone wanted me to watch a a YouTube about a testimony of Gary Walker I ever listen to Gary Walker you know and and he starts giving his testimony of how he's traveling and with him his wife his daughter and that log truck tipped over and all them logs fell on their vehicle he was pronounced dead on the scene and and God revived him and all the horror that he went through you know and I I have to say that that rotario really helped me well I can make it he he went through every bone in his body was broke and he literally saw death standing at his at the bedside you know and and you know they had that they had to wire all of his teeth in and then then you know uh uh his guns grew Over The Wire and so the doctor comes in big old Stout dude with pliers and just grabs it and Yanks it out he passes out you know and as he's telling me these things I'm thinking well I thought I really had it bad you know but but and what I'm saying is Satan was trying to put me into a place that I thought I was the only guy and of course when he does that he can just deal with you then you know and and woe is me and and and all these things and I'm not saying it wasn't bad for me but I just looking around everybody else is having it rough too here and and so and and so you young people when you go through battles and you go through trials don't let the devil fiend and make you think that nobody understands what you're going through because that's a lie there's everybody that knows what you're going through the the thing is is there are people that have learned how to deal with it there are people that have learned not to give in to that you understand what I'm saying yeah you're gonna find people that just give up on life period but think of all the people that hasn't given up think of all the people that didn't walk away think of all the people that endured can you say man but see so you're going to see both sides of this thing you're going to see people walk away from the message and if Satan can get you looking at that and then he start working on your mind see there wasn't nothing to it there ain't nothing to it it's just all fraud it's all fake it's all that you're just believing a scam a lie and all that but look at the people that has never walked away and has been blessed by staying with the message and believing the message and preaching the message and living this message can you say man so so don't let the devil take your your eyes and then you start to send what you see starts working on your imagination and your reasoning and all that don't don't let the devil just have his way with what you hear look at what the promises you've heard look at the the the the promises and what the Miracles of what God has done that you've seen you've seen is that right so Satan works on her emotions our memory Sensations affections he works on everything what we see taste feel here smell but that doesn't mean he has you and it does not mean you're possessed with the Devil he gonna work with you mentally as I I think I've said before that there's a big problem today and that's mental people really going through mental struggles in their mind like they're just going to clap so they're just gonna they don't know what to do you think of the people that have lost it mentally and then of course when you're seeing these things Satan will start affecting your mind and make you think you're going to go that way you understand what I'm saying but but but if you can look at the word of God so I bet that doesn't mean just because you're going through these things doesn't mean you're possessed of the devil can you say man people torment and mentally and it's it's getting even worse and it seems brother Brown's already told us that it would be a mental thing ain't that right people are literally going the mental and institutions are filling up yeah they don't know what to do with these people and sometimes it seems like you're going to break but you won't break I just want to tell you God has sealed you you're sealed can you say man so so Believers have these issues you know holy ghost-filled people have these issues Holy Ghost Field that if their Holy Ghost Field they're sealed can you say Amen so the devil can manifest himself in your body he can affect your mind he can do whatever but that Soul has he has no right to he has no claim he cannot touch it again all of our senses are affected by both positive and negative you're going to hear the negative as well as the positive but it can only enter the soul by free moral agency now I want you to actually turn with me if you will in your Bibles to First Peter 2 and 11. first Peter 2 and 11. when you're there Say Amen it says dearly beloved I beseech you as what strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the what the soul so you see there is a Warfare that is going on and it's for your soul right you you can be healed today in your body and be sick tomorrow with something else you can you can get over one trial today and rejoice for a minute and it seemed like that's about as the span of our victories sometimes of our rejoicing is you you have a trial and then you you like it it subsides or whatever and you're like with another one it's constant it's because you're subject to these things but the soul it's finished there's an eternal rest there was an eternal destination so but what these things are doing it's coming against your soul is trying to affect your soul and you say Amen I wished I could really describe it to you to really get it down in to you of how that these things are trying to affect the soul he'll affect your emotions your feelings to where you start feeling alone you start feeling like no one cares you start feel like no one's listening no one understands young people I know I know where you you go through because we've been there how many adults have been there been there so young people you're not alone we've been there we we have so much emotions and things and you know I've I've talked about it how especially Teenage life it's it's it's a time uh to to where it's it's really a no man's land because you're you're coming from childhood and childhood you know you're comfortable is these these children they're just comfortable at being what they're at identifying with what they are you know and that's you know uh I guess it's okay and I'm not gonna be politically correct but you know playing the Cowboys and the Indians and and uh you know and playing with the dolls and the trucks and uh you understand what I'm saying and mom's mom's taking care of supper Dad's doing you know taking care of the finances no worries no nothing just it's just free man you know and then you you start changing and the voice starts squeaking and you know um your desires begin to change girls used to have cooties you know and the boys used to have fleas and and they stunk and and all these things and and now things are changing and what what is going on is you're becoming an adult not only is your body changing your mind is changing then your faith now you're having to start thinking of the future right and I think a lot of times you know where the misunderstanding is is parents don't understand their child as a teenager uh for one the teenager can get to the place where he thinks he knows it all become smart alec becomes this and it's usually just shooting at the mouth and saying things he shouldn't say she shouldn't say it's and they're doing it without thinking you know and and and and and and then the child's thing the parents don't understand this because they're all the time tell us to shut up and stop this and quit that and you know it becomes there's a gap there and we thinking we wish the children child would grow up you know something's happened to him he he's he he he come out the door one way and he's come back in totally weird you know and and and it's it's because our children grow up so fast and so but it's in this time that the child you know you teenagers you're trying to figure things out for yourself you're trying to figure life out what is my future what is my who do am I going to marry who am I going to you know what is my career what what am I to do and and and the responsibility starts Weighing on your shoulders and yet you're between childhood and you're between adulthood and adults really don't like you around them too much and and but but you don't want to be a child because you look stupid you know you're the tallest kid sitting here playing blocks you know and and all of that and so that you don't understand adulthood either you don't understand why they just sit around and talk and you know and they don't want you talking out back you know and and and it's just there there's a time of of misplacement there's a time of No Man's Land and Satan takes advantage of that time right he takes it because you become more vulnerable and before you know it he wants to draw you away from your parents he wants to draw you away from the church he wants to draw you away to where you feel isolated you you feel like no one likes you you don't you don't feel like anybody cares you don't feel like anything that's the devil and he's trying to put an identity on you that you are not you say Amen that's right he wants to put an identity on you and so what he's doing he's trying to war against your soul he's warring against your soul can you say man now you know um and and then you start questioning did I really get the Holy Ghost did I really have something genuine that I did I really you know well what you're facing is is Satan is not going to let you keep your testimony where there's nothing going on I mean the battles doesn't start when you get a certain age so I can't tell you okay you got 10 more years and then when you hit 30 you're watch out no every one of us is going through our battles and you say man now it doesn't look like a lot of times that the adults are going through battles because they know how to hide it they know how to stabilize themselves and when I say stabilize what I mean is they're being they're rooted more in the word of God or they should be should be so rooted in that word that when a trial comes you know they may just uh like that you know and get hit but they're standing whereas you know uh uh uh sometimes a a a younger person in the Lord they can get hit and just about blocks them off on their seat in but as you learn to to to handle and to grow and uh uh well well brother Brown said that how you overcome is to recognize the devil and every one of his tricks you understand what I'm saying The Temptations that he brings your way recognize that is not you it's of the devil so we find he's warring against your soul now so again what what you are in your soul is what counts and by your first birth your soul is smutty and black you can have the carnal nature or you have a carnal nature and and of course the prophet said the soul is the nature of the spirit ain't that right so you're automatically going to think wrong talk wrong act wrong do things that are wrong and and it's because the carnal mind is enmity against God it cannot be subject to the law of God to the things of God can you say Amen it just can't and this is why you know brother Brown talking about needing a guide uh or he said you don't need a God when you're walking the broad way he said because you know all the alleys and everything else you know all the way to sin you oh you've been around a long time there's no need of somebody trying to tell you about all that see you know all the shortcuts that's right every sin you know all about see nobody has to tell you how to steal and nobody to ask to tell you how to curse you know that see nobody has to tell you how to do these evil things because it's posted on every tree everywhere on every tree everywhere see so uh uh this is why it's so easy for a common born man to go the the flow of the world it's so easy it's it's it's such an enticement amen to that carnal individual that unregenerated man and it becomes a temptation to us even that has the Holy Ghost because it's it's just what we were it's what we are you know and this is why politics are shifting more to evil things because there's nothing holy about politics ain't that right church denominations are shifting and becoming more open to sinful living because there's nothing holy about a denomination ain't that right culture is Shifting and accepting the evil inventions and ways of man and it's becoming an unconverted man that's what it is it's becoming to an unconverted man a man to move in the direction that the world is going into ain't that right it's just common God doesn't get a hold of a child brother Brandon said if he got the brother of Billy Paul didn't get the Holy Ghost he'd be dancing or rock and roll would get him when he got older you understand what I'm saying so now the word of God is becoming more obsolete all the time now uh why because the Bible already said it he said there'd be a famine for the word of God for the for for for the hearing of the word of God ain't that right in another place he said that people would Rome to and fro running Amen to and fro trying to find the word of God but they shall not find it ain't that right so so we're looking at these things the world is living their life without the standard of the word of God that you have now brother Graham says show me what you read show me what you listen to Let me hear the songs that you like best and I'll tell you what's in your soul that's feeding on it ain't that right so as I get ready to close if your soul is a gene seed of God then it comes from God ain't that right amen that Soul came from God and that is the control tower and if that Soul has been quickened then there's a new nature that's there ain't that right aren't you glad for that a new nature which which means that you wasn't born with that nature which means that you've got a desire that you wasn't born with in the natural you you you you've got a craving that you wasn't born with in the natural and now what has what does it do it becomes pliable to the word why because Satan no longer has a place in your soul he no longer has a way to you the word of God does the word of God does now this your word the word of God is your guide the word of God is your Fortress the word of God right here it's your God ain't that right and if your soul has been quickened then there's a new nature within and it becomes acceptant to this word now that unconverted Soul what does it do it reasons everything away which you're you're you're you get the let the word of God just to stay in your senses of of the spirit and you'll reason it yeah you'll explain it away because there's nothing there to to to to to reject that reasoning see so now you are still still a free moral agent to accept or to reject brother Brandon said this you can accept or turn away and that's the only Avenue to that if you accept the will of God through the spirit or the soul God's spirit takes his place in your heart and the con and controls the rest of you you with me if you do not accept that then the enemy takes that spot and controls the rest of you so it lays in that now we've looked and and and and we've seen that false doctrines and traditions of men and Creeds and all these things have been taught throughout the years and and they tried to latch on to us they've tried the world you know has tried to latch on to us but I I want you to look uh John 15 and 7. Jesus said if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you can you say Amen so so if you think of it through all these things now we're looking at that soul for just a moment but the word of God has to be deposited in you it has to be deposited and then it is to abide in you the soul ain't that right the prophet said your soul is the womb he said when Eve got perverted and listened to a lie of the the devil and took a wrong seed in the womb of her soul to believe one word and twisted ain't that right so the word comes into your heart by revelation if there's ever a time we need Revelation it's it's now there's ever a time that you need Revelation that the lord loves you it's now there's ever a time that you need Revelation that you're healed or that you're saved or or uh that you're on your way to heaven it's it's now the revelation of God can you say man that's how the word comes to you is by revelation we can talk about it we can say it we can sing about it we can do it everything else but but but it'll be like water on a duck's back but when it comes to to Revelation if the word can really get revealed to you it goes past your senses of of your flesh of your spirit and it enters into that soul of man so he says see if you if you abide in me and my word abide in you and that word abide means to continue to dwell endure remain so you continue in him because you're sealed in him and the word continues or remains in you because it is sealed up in you and you say man so brother Brown says when a man has been born again by the word of God predestinated to eternal life called the elected it'll be the word of God on top of word word on Word then then you're going to look the excitement of things is not the one that the thing that's going to drive you anymore it's going to be the word of God ain't that right um you know the worldly things maybe your friends doing things or young other young people doing things that you know is not right with the word of God that's not going to be an enticement to you as much as it used to be because now you're not looking for them things to thrive on to feed off of you're looking at the word of God and you're meditating upon the word of God and you're letting the word control you don't let the world control you don't let the things of amusements in the world control you don't let it drive you to where you become unsettled in the word because to where you become unsettled in the church to where you become unsettled in everything you're looking at everything else out here and that's fine but now let's look at it that God has called you for a purpose what is your purpose and you're coming to a place especially you young people you're coming to a place that God's got to use you in some way and you've got to come to a place that you've become established in your heart in your thoughts in in in in your conduct to where you start taking on that responsibility Dad can't keep you mom can't keep you no one else a pastor can't keep you you've got to come to your own grips that when you come to your trials you can stand true and be that faithful individual and can you say man we're looking and I'm going to close but this generation is a is is a they want to be entertained they they want to have fun fun fun fun fun fun fun if someone else is having fun let's go do that then and they'll they'll woefully I mean it's getting to the place that if if the husband gets tired of the wife let's go for her let's go for the woman that has the fun if the if if the wife gets tired of the husband the old fuddy daddy you know he can't excite me no more so let's go do this and we say oh that's bad but what about other people can't find them faithful in church anymore because they're too busy looking for fun out other things you can't find solid people anymore children want to change families now this is why parents are just fuddy-duddy they look at every other parent oh man they're having fun out there they got the gold cards and they got this and they got that what do we have a treehouse foreign tree and I had to make it you know what I'm saying and before you know it we're looking at everything else instead just being established and content with what God made us to be so this is where it comes into the soul you've got to be rooted and grounded in the soul and this word can only satisfy you can you say Amen meditate on the positive you'll be surprised and and we've already talked about it the word of God is the only positive thing there is quit looking at everything else and see where God has blessed you at wouldn't you think it funny wouldn't you think it funny if your husband you sisters that are married your husband says you know deary sweetie poo h I was at the store the other day and this girl winked at me and I had feelings I mean just something there was a connection so I got her number we're going to go on a date because every time you wink at me I I don't feel nothing you just kind of lost it ain't that ridiculous but how many people do the same thing well the church ain't satisfying me no more so let's go somewhere else let's go see let's get satisfaction message came in satisfying people so let's go find satisfaction why because they're looking for something that excites them in the spirit Realm and it's not the spirit realm that counts is as a man thinketh in his heart so is he so you come to know that every family is going to have trials Mom and Dad ain't going to be you be on your your your pedestal all the time especially when teenagers get there right and then then you realize that maybe we we've been here you know for whatever years and man you know we just see the same old people then you start oh man they're doing really something nice over there you know what I'm saying and before you know it you're looking at well here's the thing though you get your new car you get excited about it but it gets old you're always going if if you develop a spirit like that you become you're going to trade your models in and they do it in all kinds of levels whether it's trading your husband trading their wife trading their children trading the preacher trading the the Saints trading churches trading whatever some even got to the point they're going to trade Nations because they're always looking for something else instead of looking what God has blessed them with I it blows my mind how people can look at America and claim to be American and looking over somewhere else as if there's something better I don't get it I understand that America is rotten and it's it's something else but I'm so glad to be in America and as the prophet said we bear with their shame we bear their reproach we bear it all well with the gospel is the same way and that's what makes you settle that's what makes you a pillar That's What Makes You concrete is you're willing not only did handle it for I'm I'm the guy you know someone gives me gum I only like the gum when the flavor's there and after one minute and the flavor's gone I take the gum out I want another one I don't understand why people just want chew gum all you know there ain't no flavor there but if you take that in the spirit Realm we're going to trade everything and before you know it you become unstable Trials come you're looking for something else to appease you even only in your Christian walk you understand what I'm saying you you know that there's going to be times that in your Christian walk you're not going to feel God what are you going to do then when you don't feel God where are you going to go well you're going to switch gods
