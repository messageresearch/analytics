[Music] so glad that there is a group of people that have given their all to the Lord amen so many um today different groups are pledging their allegiance to many things but we pledge the allegiance to our allegiance to the lamb a man of the musicians can be dismissed it's good to see everyone in the house of the Lord and brother Bill sure good to have you I'm back and pray your uh feeling better and amen we sure love and appreciate brother Bill very much and um great uh blessing to us but if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the Book of John the 13th chapter amen and Ray uh you know you got some rest a little bit man but um John the 14th John 14. amen there's a little ringing I don't know what it is but um but before we go into the word could we just bow our heads and talk to our Lord father and truly we pledge our allegiance to you Lord in this day and we realize more and more how few it is father that is really sold out to you but Lord we're just thankful for what you've done in our lives and how you've touched us thank you for keeping us Lord and answering so many of our prayers and you're just taking care of us and we're so thankful for that I pray father that you would just move among us this evening Lord just take what simple words we would have and pray that you would anoint Lord these lips of clay and anoint both speaker Lord and hearer Lord let it just be the words be rooted and established in our Heart Lord father that we can be more like you give us a greater faith greater understanding is our prayer in Jesus Christ's name amen the um uh John 14 and just start at the 12th verse but it um says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it everybody say I will do it ain't that a promise amen you can have your seeds and say Levi done a really good job at saying it man tell you what he uh he may not be able to get through that door now but uh uh enjoyed sister hope song as well amen but um uh thinking of this uh The Works that I do shall he do also and and of course brother Branham tells us that is the believer Jesus was speaking to the believer and he never he never put it as um um like he was speaking in general it was you shall do you shall do if you ask anything in my name I will do it for you and so it become a personal and and he's again talking to that believer there's still a ring Daniel I don't know what it is but so we realize that any promise is to the believer any promise of God and and you know the Bible says that every promise in him is yea and amen they are so sure they are so anchored uh it's and the promises of God are benefits for the believer to enjoy ain't that rhyme and so and and they are guaranteed to work for the believer every promise of God is guaranteed to work for the believer so doing the Greater Works is for the believer just as much much as salvation is for the believer now I think we could all believe that we're saved tonight right and we can all believe that we're saved well that that is by faith we we operate it now you know now that that's a real big step to believe that we're we're we're uh gonna make it in in the Rapture you know that because you know uh we see what the world is doing we see the world shaking in fear and and uh the the worst time uh is coming that that has never been seen on the face of the earth is coming of of this Great Tribulation that is at hand and yet while that is approaching and you can tell it's approaching because the people are nervous anxiety fear uh everything uh uh they're looking for answers they're trying to find the peace they're they're and yet we're in in in looking in the same in in the same direction in other words we we can we can see it coming we we see what's going on in the world and yet we realize that we're not part of it because we believe that we're saved we we believe that we're the Bride of Jesus Christ so if we can stand that way in faith knowing and believing that we are the bride of Christ uh uh then we can look at all the other promises and believe that we're able to do the Greater Works ain't that right we're able to do the Greater Works so Jesus said that um uh uh you know that he didn't do any of the works a man that was done through him he said it was the father that was in him that he's the one that done the works ain't that right so we we understand that Jesus was a dual person he he was he was man the son and yet he was God Almighty ain't that right amen so for the spirit in him was God as we have quoted you know it Paul says that uh God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself so so uh um uh uh Jesus being a dual person brother Brian said the people couldn't understand him because uh there were times that he would speak as God and other times he would speak as man and and and and so uh uh you know he was hungering at one point and and then another point you know uh uh he was multiplying uh The Fish and Loaves and and these things because he was a dual person well we are I believe that we are a dual person the believer is a dual person a man in that amen we are human and yet that same spirit that was in Christ is in us can you say Amen now the skeptic might hear that and say well that's that's just bizarre but but you you got to remember that we're not uh we've got the Living God that is within us and and when when uh the Bible says that you're the Temple of the Holy Ghost amen well that ain't just a a cliche amen that ain't just something we just say Amen that is a reality that if if the Holy Ghost is in us which is none other than God Amen then God uh uh he is a person he's a personality and so when he comes in us he doesn't change himself amen because he came in US amen my nature may be whatever you know you may be shy in your nature but when God comes in you amen God's still the same God that he's always been amen you might be a little backward amen uh and have that that timid nature but when when God gets in you amen he's he's his own person he's his own nature he's his own personality can you say amen amen so so we find that that that God uh uh uh the prophet in speaking of the Bride said she is him she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him ain't that right so as we were talking amen uh this morning you know the the bride she is different from the rest of the world Amen she has been hewed out we have been hewed out amen now you think of that we were not uh um uh what would be that word we're not reformed we didn't become reformed from one thought to another thought or uh from maybe a Baptist thought to a Pentecostal thought or or a a Jehovah's Witness Doctrine to to the message we we weren't reformed amen we were hewed out can you say Amen totally different in my opinion we were hewed out see this bride has been hewed out from all unbelief remember the prophet preached the message God calls for a separation from all unbelief the only way that you could have been separated is by this message of the hour and God done it it wasn't a teacher of that done and it it wasn't even the prophet himself that done it it was God that done it by the message that the prophet brought amen we were hewed out from unbelief we were hewed out from the Creeds and dogmas of of man we were hewed out even from our own thoughts a man's seen and this bride has come to recognize her place and position she's recognized her day and her hour do you believe that well that's what the prophet said in the recognizing your day in this message amen the prophet said the brightest come to recognize her dad day and her hour amen that's that's that's right amen and and we even look at Israel how that Israel is has recognized she's she's in her Homeland not just there to be there but she realizes she's there Amen to see the Messiah she recognizes why she is in that land amen and we're talking about the true uh the the true seed of Israel the true elect amen see and so the prophet Hosea even prophesied that they would be gathered again and yet the prophet said at the same time that that Israel is recognizing what is going on for her this bride has recognized the evening light amen the prophet said the hungry Pentecostals have begun to recognize that them organizations hasn't got anything they was looking for they're so twisted and tore up it's the time of recognition mission do you believe that it's the time of recognition amen playing church is over it's the time of recognition fussing and fighting and feuding is over it's the time of recognition the name he says you've got to recognize the world has recognized the Nations I've recognized science is recognized the devil has recognized it's the time that he can wreck women wreck the church wreck the people he's recognized it think of that he's recognized that this is the time to wreck people's lives this is the time amen direct churches and and all of these things but God has recognized that there is a people on Earth that he has predestinated to life aren't you glad that God is recognized amen God is very well aware of this age amen it's not like he's oblivious to it it's not like all the angel ages just blending together amen if it had not been for a prophet Amen to separate the ages that we're living in and and that's been through amen God has recognized this age that he's got a predestinated People amen for his glory he's recognized that this is the time to send this message and he's done it see the people has recognized it the bride time has realized the evening light amen and what's happened under this recognition she comes under expectation amen we as a people the believer the bride are under expectation the bride she understands why she was put here on this Earth and it wasn't to have a a an 80-hour job and it wasn't to have all the materialistic amen that that that Satan wants to drive us to amen we've got a greater purpose than that can you say Amen it's true see and and so see you're you're you're you're not going the way of the mainstream ideas anymore amen you're not acting with the rest of the world anymore you don't have the same thought pattern as the church world anymore see you've been hewed out for a purpose no do you believe that that's why this this this church will never go back to denomination this message can never be organized again why we've been hewed out this has been the queuing out time that God would take out a people for his name's sake a man different you've broken the cycles now you think of that the message of the hour has broken the cycles that has been going on for ages and ages and ages and yet the message in it takes your life and breaks the Cycles in your life see God predestinated you to be a believer ain't that right so we're under expectation if God said it we believe it amen we're under expectation we expect nothing less than the supernatural to come Among Us we expect nothing less than to do the Greater Works we expect nothing less than to see miracles happen we expect nothing less than to see our children filled with the Holy Ghost we expect nothing less than to see amen uh God give us victory over in the things that we're struggling with in our life amen we've been hewed out can you say Amen we're not looking at the situation we're not looking at the impossibilities we're not considering anything we're looking at the word of God we've been hewed out in this age Amen to believe the word of God Amen separate from everything else all right yes yes ma'am brother Branham he Likens the setting of the world today as it was in the days of the judges in in the Old Testament with Israel and Israel had been playing with God and they would get into sin and then they would go into captivity then God would in his graciousness would deliver them from the enemy and it wouldn't be long too long after that Israel would go to sin and again and they would go into captivity God in his Mercy would come and deliver them again and God would show his Mercy toward them time and time and time again and it was like just putting up with the little old baby little old kid a man they go to sinning they're going to captivity amen you realize that Israel was God's people amen now think of that Israel was God's people and the enemy could not touch them the enemy couldn't hurt them the enemy could not defeat them the only time the enemy could do that is when they're in sin ain't that right because they were God's people God had taken them out of a Nation a man to display his power but and they're going to sin and they deserved it and they went into captivity but God rich in Mercy would bring that Nation back out and it was just constantly going constantly going see a man see and so you you find that that when Israel got to uh to sin and then they lost their ability to win Wars ain't that right they lost their ability they they lost that Supernatural they were still the people of God but they lost the supernatural hey man they didn't win their Wars Always by sword they didn't win their world wars Always by military ain't that right sometimes they'd sing amen and they would win the war sometime that March around the city and they would win the war sometimes the anointing of them ornament would come upon a little boy a man needed to take a slingshot amen and they would win a war sometimes they would take the anointing Upon A man amen did grab an ox gold amen and and go to the enemy amen and win a war amen it had nothing to do with man yeah the the science of man it it had nothing to do with the intellectual of man it had to do with the supernatural you believe that Amen to Supernatural but see the people of Israel they did not come out of Egypt by military power they didn't come out by scientific inventions or through educational programs they came out of Egypt by the power of the Living God ain't that right and they were sustained by the power of God so that no military power could ever conquer them amen no military power could conquer them because they were sustained by a supernatural power I feel sorry for those these make-believers that are looking toward the White House for help as if they've got the answers as if Trump has the answers you know you know as if the next republican or democrat or whatever has the answers amen the believer has been hewed out of all of this can you say amen amen we're not like Israel that wanted a natural King a natural government they should have known better there was no King that could have taken them out of Egypt it was God that done that can you say amen and there ain't no president that's going to help us in this hour there ain't no hope in this hour except getting out of here there's a Rapture at hand can you say amen that's right see see but when they no longer had the power of God with him then they were as weak and helpless as any other Nation ain't that right yes sir now today look at the day amen God is put up with with the church all the way through the ages and going to one ISM God would take him out and they would go into another ism and he's going to captivity ain't that right study the Masterpiece study the the church ages study all these things amen study the the the the the seals and all that there was an enemy that was writing in the church ages ain't that right amen and when Israel or when the church began to backslide amen remember they lost their first love in the first church age amen and they took dogmas instead of Amen instead of the word of God they they adopted titles instead of the name of Christ and and all of these things and what happened amen the enemy was able to come in there God brought him through with Wes with Luther and I go right back in and defeated conquered right he brought him out through Wesley there they go back right in again brought him out through Pentecost and there they go back in again you say Amen yep Pentecostals is just as helpless as any of them they're just as helpless see see the word has been Twisted in every way to fit everyone's ideas amen ain't that right now I want you to listen I'm going to shoot straight here for a few moments but people wonder why things are going wrong in their life a man and their family or or whatever and you know first of all they ought to check all of us here if it's happening here uh internet whatever you ought to check to see where you are with the word of God you see the churches look look at laodicea we're just going to look at laodicea the churches have gotten away from God you believe that yep yep they've gotten away from God now now the prophet even told us you know about Russia having their their um uh their Pentecostal movement you know and how it was great and all that but then they got away from God and they set their dead today now I know they say they've got their little Pentecostal moves and and their little tongue speaking in their little prophecies and all that but the church says they're dead you see we understand then that just a little prophecy that that ain't what we're looking for just a little speaking in tongues that's not what we're looking for that's what they had in the Pentecostal movement and yet the prophet said there's been no Revival to wake this bride up yet don't get me wrong I believe in gifts and all these things but that's not that's not the the icing on the cake so here they are the church is second dead and yes they're prophesying yes they're speaking in tongues yes they're Discerning yes they're doing all these things uh uh but yet the church is set dead no life hey man look at the home life the home life is in disarray ain't that right now now you know just talking to a gentleman the other day but men don't know how to lead their homes anymore they just don't or they refuse to do it or they're too intimidated by the wives to do it but they don't know how to lead their homes and and this idea is a new thing it's hard to believe to the world to laodicea women don't want their husbands being head of the home and they refuse to come under the headship they want to be their own head they want to have their the the the things their own way can you say amen and yet did you know that brother Branham said as you serve your husband's sisters you serve the Lord that's right and the prophet said the greatest curse in the world is a dominating female can you say Amen so we we find that not only has it that has it just affected the home but it's tried to slip into the church where they've done their best to try to rule the church can you say Amen but it's against God's word are you with me now now Leota Sia has gone that direction but this bride has been hewed out by the word ain't that right men in this age are becoming more material minded and they're leaving off the spiritual things of God and of course they they quote their scriptures you know if a man doesn't work he doesn't eat he's got to be provider and he's got to do all of this but they never consider what Jesus said but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these other things shall be added unto you can you say Amen they don't believe what Paul said my God shall supply all your need according to hisra not your riches he is riches not according to your bank account but he is riches ain't that right they say well we're barely you know we're barely making ends meet as it is and my answer to that is quit living so high on the hog to where you're constantly in debt I know we're we're in a we're in a materialistic world where we all got to have nice things you don't have to have nice things and if that in if that is interrupting your spiritual life can you say Amen if that's interrupting your spiritual life see now I know we we want our families to live life in Comfort here on this Earth and that's I I commend men to do that amen but if it cost you your spirituality brother Branham already told us we pray for comfort and peace they said God doesn't give us comfort and peace I wished I had the quote right before me but he just verb just just phrasing he's in this turmoil he sends us trials he sends us testings then you say man and then he says our comfort is over there and can you say man our comfort is over there so I I I believe that Satan in this age is convincing more and more people that they can go to church at their own convenience now I know this is becoming more touchy as as time goes but listen the Bible Still Remains the Same forsake not the assembling of yourselves together even the more as you see that day approaching and I don't care who is teaching it that it's okay it's not okay are you with me we got women that'll trim their hair and I'm not saying in the church but it's just it's everywhere it was so much even in in the apostolics when we when we were in that Pentecostal yet trimmed their hair and then try to hide it so-called Christians watching all kinds of movies foreign God have mercy listen all kinds of ungodly music so wrapped up in sports they're not wrapped up in church they're wrapped up in sports then they come to church they want to say like a knot on a log sleep wonder why the preacher's preaching too long but you get them out there and they're wrapped up in every ungodly thing and it may not even be ungodly but if it's distracting your mind and your attention from the word of God something's wrong if the supernatural ain't happening in your life I'm just telling you church we can we can look and we can sit here all day long and say well I've heard about it I've heard about them good works but where is it well then that that question should look at us don't blame the preacher don't blame the Deacon don't blame your you know the guy next to you look at yourself [Music] right that's right see and and so these things have occupied the people's minds hearts and their time to where they have no time for the Lord if I would ask him he's got time for prayer this week oh yeah I prayed three minutes two minutes one minute getting into real prayer we're just going to talk for a moment all right because we wonder why the situations are there why is it why is it now we're having a hard time overcoming lust why is it that we're having over a hard time overcoming this why is it the troubles are around me and I'm just sitting here just like like I'm just a you know a a second duck God's just left me what are we entertaining see Israel as long as they walk they didn't follow the Commandments of God you say but I I've got I've got long hair I've we we've got Holiness standards you know good and well that's more than just that can you say Amen that's exactly right when we can't respect the house of God when we can't respect our husbands hello and and I'm just showing you it may not be here but I'm just showing you what it is out there somewhere the word of God and the presence of God left the World Church and I want to tell you young people there's a white reason why we are different it's more than just a message it's more than just a Doctrine it's more than just making us different because we believe Brother Brad and be a prophet we want the supernatural that's what God cut you out for not so you can come out of Baptist and come into a message and bring your old Baptist ways or your old Pentecostal ideas are your old legalistic ideas all that Junk's Gotta Die then you say Amen it's exactly right see so their mind is so cluttered that they hardly have time to think on the Lord hello amen children get sick we immediately want to go to the doctor we mentally start panicking we immediately start looking for scientific things why not just look to the Lord not against doctors as you know foreign that our minds are so cluttered up that the Lord becomes the last resort hello hey you know I'm just going to be honest with you we fight these we fight these things you know and and me and my wife we've had our discussions about things you know where is this coming from and what what's what's what about the finances and what about this and what about that and what about you know where you you you literally begin to panic it's okay what what what's what's next for my future I'll tell you what's next for my future God's with us and we're going to see victory you understand what I'm saying you might be struggling in your marriage and you're like well this this might be the end of it don't look at it that way look at the supernatural and you say Amen your back may be against the wall a man to where it looks like there's no absolutely no hope don't you look at it as that way there is a supernatural that is with the people of God well the doctor says I'll always be like this and I'll just I've got to carry this all my life you don't have to listen to that right Let's see we we got now we you've got people more you know they're more interested in in the football getting their children to football practice and making sure they attend their games and then they wonder why the children their own children don't have much enthusiasm about God anymore hello it's because we never presented God in that way that you need God more than you ever need anything else before you ever needed money you need God before you need a home you need God that's why the prophet said I'd rather live under a bridge eating soda crackers amen than the compromise on the word of God I need God can you say man young women today are more interested in getting prepared for a career than about their position in the home they want to get out and work and the churches and parents both are promoting such nonsense can you say Amen you know what the prophet said woman was made to be a help meet at the house [Music] that goes out the window many times but I'll tell you if you've been hewed out by the prophet's message you'll believe that it rain so well I just can't respect my husband you shouldn't have married him then and if you had dads to look at things and and be the head of their home when that old time is coming in trying to sneak around then you say Amen now brother Brown said if your husband's sick everybody say if my husband's sick not you men women if your husband's sick then you need to go out and work but if it isn't listen to your sister God Made You for one place the kitchen and when you get out of there you're out of his will remember that women was made to be a help mate at the house she never was made for office work and it's caused more disgrace and more divorces and things I've had young women come and tell me so well I'm just not made to be that way I hate to cook and be stuck in the house you know what I got to say it's a perverted spirit it's just like them homosexuals trying to tell us that we were born to be homosexuals no you wasn't you got a demon on you that's making you believe that junk God wouldn't make the woman for that to have a prophet to set the standard for the household amen and then make her to where she wants to go out and she can't be what she's supposed to be it's the spirit of the age that's what it is and you say Amen just like the woman you know years ago that told me that she has to cut her hair because having long hair causes her to have headaches what an excuse me be honest with you there ain't no excuse that's going to hold up in God's courts and you say man he promised he'd give us Grace foreign you ain't cooking cooked by the grace of God hate working go work by the grace of God can you say man he never made men to sit there on their phones and and and and and do video games all day what such Tommy rot so when we get down to the root of it all it's an evil spirit that's anointing to people to be the way they are thank you hello they started entertaining thoughts well I got to do something for my child they're just sitting in the church dead they just ain't got no friends they ain't doing all this and you know what it is it's Satan that is is is pulling them away to whether they're not comfortable in church they're not a comfortable around comfortable around Christians more comfortable out there in the sports team more comfortable out there in the world can you save it and I don't care the best of them amen they they say well I'm a churchgoer the best of them ain't got the Holy Ghost if they're wearing their shorts I don't care how good they are they are anointed of a devil to do that that's what the prophet said and if you are hewed out by the prophet of this age you'll believe that it's an evil spirit brother Brown said when people claim to be Christians or personate Christianity or try to act like they're Christians when down in their heart they don't have the peace of God you only become an actor you know people really know that see your neighbor neighbor knows that you're just acting that way certainly she sees you get mad and fly loose beat the dog around the house and holler at your husband and Scat him under the bed when he comes in and you do the same see they know that's not Christianity he said when you really get saved he changes you when that homo really gets saved he'll never be a homo again when that man that's acting feminine and all wearing them tight jeans he gets saved he'll never do that again and that woman trying to be a man and be masculine like a man she gets saved she'll never be that again can you say Amen why when you really get safety changes you can you say man seed The Works that I do shall you do also you can't do it by going to the movie theaters can doing it by watching these ungodly filthy movies amen people won't take communion because they have believed the LIE of the devil you'll either have to believe the prophet what the prophet said about you or you'll continue believing that lie [Music] because communion is something that God requires us to park take in you say well I don't feel I just don't feel Worthy the prophet said there's a blood to make you Worthy you see if we're not hiding behind the word of God then we become susceptible to anything we're the only thing that makes us different a different group of people from the rest of the people is the blood is the word of God the word of God is our Fortress and once that is taken away if we start allowing little sins in our life it strips us of the supernatural and we become as the Pentecostal as Samson that God never did intend us to be like that can you say Amen see if you open up a little gate the devil takes takes control and then we wonder why he's wreaking havoc in our lives we wonder why this is going on and we ain't got no power to stop it I'll tell you why is because we're allowing things in our life that God never did a lot on I'm gonna tell off for myself okay sometimes as a I guess my my disposition or whatever I whatever it is I can go into depression and I I go dark deep in in my mind I'm a deep thinker and I start thinking about things things that are going on things that are happening maybe it's in the church or maybe it's in the family or maybe it's in the world and I start thinking about them and start thinking about my Ministry I think about what you know the past or I start thinking of this and and now and I'm telling you for a reason them things should never be allowed them things should never be because the prophet told us to be positive always positive never let a never negative thought into your mind but I had hit that low I hit a low I was in a church service the power of God was moving the the brother that was preaching wow he was tearing it up and I was agreeing with everything he said the service started going the song service was great people really worshiping God and somewhere a little thought hit my mind and I let it drift and I started thinking on a negative thought just about my own life negative and before you know it such a spirit of depression grabbed a hold of me I felt my chest tightening up I'm hearing the message and I'm saying amen but it's Amen amen a minister sitting there by me he's rejoicing and he just turns around and looks at me what in the world's happening on and I couldn't break it and and it was just it was such a power I don't know how to explain it but it was just a power and the whole service I couldn't lift my hands I was agreeing with the message I was hearing it it was right it was a man it was true but I couldn't rejoice in my heart I think God please help me God help me whatever the spirit is doing help me I wanted to leave the church because I thought I was being an embarrassment or thought of being a hindrance to the ministers that was sitting there now I'm really telling off of myself but I told the Lord Lord please if you deliver me I don't want to ever go this road again I'll never listen to that Spirit again God please help me be think on the positive give me that Grace and it was by God's grace that that thing lifted it was it was at the end of the service and the thing finally just lifted away the minister said what what was going on he I mean he's looking at me it's what was going on I saw I I don't know all I know is that some Spirit came it was a depression depressive spirit my chest started her I thought I was just I thought my heart was going to blow I I just it was the most awfullest weirdest feeling ever that I told I told the Lord I'll never think of thought and negative thought help me never to go that direction now that opened my eyes to what what I'm talking about to you right now that you give the devil one inch he's going to rule he's going to take over if if you are if you are a person that like to talk negative think negative don't you do that get away from that if you are a person that that you know that that just says well I can do whatever you know uh I know it says there but you know and you're letting the devil twist the scriptures in your mind to you get away from that now see God has hewed us out for a purpose it's true that's all right the enemy is doing everything to attack and you may be having life easy right now but remember if you're giving in today Satan's going to press and press and press and get you more relaxed there's a man in Pennsylvania and I I love the brother I I think dearly of him and he was a big help to us at our church in Erie Pennsylvania great great help loving but he had children Levi's age and Ruth Sage these voices that want to go Church all the time but he would never go to church maybe on Sundays why don't I just talk to him and so Darren you better get them boys in church he had one teenager that really wanted to get in church I said you better get them boys in church yeah yeah yeah yeah I know I know I know I said no no no you're not listening to me you're not listening to me listen to what I'm trying to tell you it's the grace of God that your children want to go to church it's the grace of God that your family wants to go to church get them in church quit playing around in this thing yeah yeah yeah I know I know I know but he never would change his mind about it I was very strict with him because I'm telling you right now Darren your children ain't gonna be the same once the devil gets a hold of him went up there this time divorced not one of them children have a desire to serve God he got him out in sports and there he is still the same old same old person I love him to death he loves me to death but he never saw the impact of what Satan was doing to him [Music] can you say Amen now let's look now there are people who make excuses as to why they can't get baptized you see the devil will he we will let the devil just to any fire justify anything in our minds then you say Amen but there is no excuse you with me people will never get any further with God until they get rid of the unbelief and come into obedience to the word of God I don't care how much you've got to sacrifice I don't care how much we you know we we've got to uh uh get down to business and get rid of this and get rid of that and how much it hurts amen and the devil say you're just becoming a fanatic no we've been you'd ouch for a purpose you realize the devil can't set a foot on a person until he gets away from God can you say man he can't he can't destroy a family unless they get away from God when Daddy quits doing what he's supposed to be doing in that headship in that house and I'm not just talking about leading I'm not just talking about work guys can go work and they become Workaholics and they become that's the easy thing for this layout of SIA is to become pleasure-minded materialistic minded but very few people know how to lead their family in the spiritual things very few men can you say Amen that's right now he may not get you to wear your full blown out in the world he may get you to where you're just cold lukewarm church member where you have no Supernatural power in your life you don't understand the spiritual things of God he may get you to where you just can't believe for the impossible anymore and every little thing that comes along in your life just upset you and trips you up and and you're just wondering why you understand what I'm saying I'm Gonna Let You Go brother Brandon talks about this Minister y'all y'all would remember Branham he asked brother how's your church doing well doing good we're feeding them you know pills pills like kind of pills Gospels and he said How's your church doing well we we just you know he's I just made all my congregation to sign a pledge a thing piece of paper pledging that there'd be at least Church six months out of the year and as they're talking about this they're in a they're in a in a building and a girl you know brother Brown called her a wild cat you know she'd come banging on the door and I think brother Brown was working there the someone was working there and so brother Brandon Moses she flies right by Brother Branham forgets about brother Brandon being there and then there's a DJ on the radio that's that's whatever doing his thing and the girl blows the kiss at the radio and as she's leaving she walks out or she bumps and brother oh excuse me I forgot you're here and she looks at the radio and says I'll see you tonight and walks out they're going to have a big old dance now brother Brian said when that Minister told me about his people signing those pledges he said I asked him do you think that Wildcat player on that radio would have to make that girl sign a pledge that she would be over there that tonight not at all she would Pawn what clothes she had on to get there why it's something in her that's connected her a spirit to that worldly amusement and he says until the Church of the Living God that's called the bride of Christ gets herself connected with God like that she'll still wallow in the world and in the miracle of sin until she's connected with God in such a way till her heart is so filled with glory and power of God until she can't see nothing else but Christ can you say Amen if you allow me just a few more moments amen the prophet said see God finally got tired of playing games with Israel he finally got tired of it and he's tired of playing church with people or uh yeah yeah people playing Church in this day and and and the prophet said today right now is the time to get down to business with God that's what you're made for can you say Amen he said it's time for action it's time to act upon what we know it to be the truth and he said you cannot act unless you have faith and you cannot have faith unless you know what you are standing for or what you are doing ain't that right amen someone said someone said to me one time says no and no the doctor was talking about a miracle that happened among sick people and he said to me preacher don't you believe that if you told them people to go out and touch a tree or a post the same thing would take place I said no sir I said because you cannot have faith in touch in a tree or a post faith is not that loose and I'm gonna be honest you cannot have faith trimming your hair Faith ain't that loose you you can't have faith listen to the worldly music Faith ain't that loose so you understand where a Believer is he knows where he's at ain't that right see faith is not that loose it's got to be based upon some noted fact you've got to know something about what you're having faith in before you can have faith in it so we first must know how and what what God's desire is what God's plan is and how to approach God by that plan then when we walk up boldly to the to the throne of grace and plead what the plan is promised to us we shall have what we've asked so God got tired of messing with the people so he called the halt he got tired of the people messing around so he called a halt and you know what he done when he called the heart he sent a prophet now I want you to realize that's what's happening in our day he sent a prophet he says when God's people gets in trouble listen now when God's people gets in trouble God always sends them a prophet with a true word to bring them out now you realize God ain't gonna send another Prophet right he sent this Prophet to get us to select out of our trouble [Applause] it's never a time that God's people ever gets in trouble unless God sends them his word God always in every case sends the people a true servant a true Prophet that'll bring them the true word of God and the word of God is what delivers the people always can you say Amen so the intellectual mind will not deliver the people psychology will not deliver the people politics will not deliver the people military force will not deliver the people always the prophet with the word of God will deliver God's people now notice what the prophet said man is not surviving by military power man survives by the power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ not by military power and by sputniks and so forth we survive and live by the power of Jesus Christ oh this bride God hewed us out that we would survive only by his power where's the power at today Luke 21 25 and there shall be signs in the Sun and the Moon and in the stars and upon the Earth's distress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring men's Hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken are we here then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud foreign with power everybody say with power and great glory and you know what in another place brother Branham said he is coming in power for the bride he's coming in power for the bride don't it make you want to just get rid of all the world don't want to make you just want to get rid of everything all the excess and just stay right there in his word that's where the power is he's coming in power for his bride Church we're getting ready to leave here can you say Amen amen I read this uh this morning but National Force put Israel in her Homeland National Force put the church in the world Council of churches but the power of God will put the people in The Bride the world forces this way the world forces that way but God forces upward the spirit of God which is the word of God my word is spirit and life will put the bride in her place because she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in Christ we'll put her in her place and no National Force will do it can you say man and did you know what brother Brown has called this power that has come astronaut power that is lifting us up off from the world We Are Spiritual astronauts can you say Amen notice the prophet said she is getting resurrected power in her to fly beyond the things of the world seeing him out here in the church making himself the same yesterday today and forever I'm going to read that again because that's a powerful statement she is getting resurrected power in her where is it coming from seeing him in the church making himself the same yesterday today and forever and that power she's getting resurrected power to fly beyond the things of the world brother we're here he says the countdown's over it's over it's going home time and you say Amen this Bride is a believer do you believe it she's a Believer if the musicians will come brother Branham in 1962 now listen now this is before the seals this is this is in 1962 brother branham's foretelling now brother Brown said Jesus is so close to coming to the earth now until his power has begun to catch the people and winding them up getting them ready for the bride getting ready to be caught up in the Rapture a church that'll just fit just that'll fit just exactly to be taken up though it's through its power we'll draw all the rest of them that's born again out of the earth think of that that power that's abiding in you is the power that's going to draw the the Saints out of this Earth and we're going to be caught up to meet the Lord in the air can you say man you have to do something about this Resurrection you have something to do about this resurrection that power that is in you that you're yielding to is becoming so great in this bride that it's going to affect the Dead [Music] through its power we'll draw all the rest of them that's born again out of the Earth then you say man notice God sent the prophet the people a prophet and the word came to them and he called the people back to repentance and to an understanding that God was the a God was there that that God that their God was a god of Might and a god of Deliverance that Prophet The Prophet said reminded the people that God was the god of Miracles he snatched him out of the hands of the Egyptian he opened up the Red Sea and fed them in the wilderness can you say man how do you know you know do you know how he sensed Israel out of Egypt a prophet he sent him a prophet Moses and and I got to say this where we close you see for Israel for Egyptians when that Prophet come it was assigned to the Egyptian that their power had come to an end [Music] tell the people of of God for 400 years or over but when the Prophet come on the scene it was a sign to that enemy that his power had come to an end no more to be Israel Egypt never rose up again as a superpower it was over because God sent a prophet can you say Amen listen and the prophet's brother Brown said Moses was a sign Moses stayed with the Lord he was assigned he was assigned to Israel that their day of Deliverance was at hand he was assigned to Egypt that third day uh that the day of their end was at hand because they drowned there in the Dead Sea later the whole Army of pharaoh they were in at the end of their military power and a prophet was a sign of a national end do you realize our Prophet is the same way we stand here today our Prophet stood here in this age as a sign of national end but not only as a national end but the end of the world and the end of your suffering on the end of your slavery on the end of everything that has has bound you it's an end he was a sign that it was an end your Victory is here can you say Amen we're standing at that place again no more slave to the Enemy No More being a victim of circumstance oh my God and the prophet reminded the people that God had taken a people that was dwelling in a certain land and defeated them and gave the land over to them you say man God took the land from someone else and gave it to them God LED them to the land and gave that land to them under a prophet's message and listen did not God do the same thing for us in this age did he not what Luther had they no longer have [Music] Walt Wesley had what the Pentecostals had has been taken from them and has been given to the people that's been called for his namesake the Revival that they had no longer the move of God whatever Supernatural power they had is gone but where is the Revival at today in this bride the name of God is resting upon her Hallelujah aren't you glad for that amen the Lord is wonderful amen what song are we singing [Music] I played Joe allegiance to the land Hallelujah with all mine I will seek [Music] to [Music] foreign will I have heard how Christians long ago were brought before a tyrant's throne they were told that he would spare their lives if they would just renounce the name of Christ opened one by one they chose to die oh the son of God they would not deny like a great Angelic quiet your sins I can almost hear the hand voices ring I pledge allegiance is at your heart hallelujah oh with all my strengths with all I am I will seek to honor his command oh I play pledge allegiance to the lamb second verse for now the years have come the years have gone and the cause of Jesus it still lives on now our time has come our time to count the cost oh to reject this world to embrace the cross oh and one by one let us live our lives for the one who died to give us life till the trumpet sounds on the final day let us proudly stand and boldly say I pledge allegiance to the lamb Hallelujah let the believer say it tonight oh I will seek to honor his command High play pledge allegiance to the lamb now listen I want to read a quote brother Brown said the church started
