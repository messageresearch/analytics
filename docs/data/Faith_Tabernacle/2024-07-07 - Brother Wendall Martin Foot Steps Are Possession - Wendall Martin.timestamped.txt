[1:27:16] of God and she says you gave the promise
[1:27:20] I did not come up asking for that

[1:29:27] waiting on Amen they're you know they've
[1:29:29] got that little baby and and it looks
[1:29:31] like the enemy is just trying to kill

[1:29:35] want to say to them if they are amen if
[1:29:37] they're if they're live streaming this
[1:29:39] morning Victory is the direct
[1:29:42] consequence of faith and we are
[1:29:46] believing with Bethany and and brother
[1:29:48] shemiah we are standing upon that
[1:29:51] promise this morning God gave that that
[1:29:54] promise and we're expecting God to
[1:29:57] fulfill his
[1:29:59] word oh glory to God can you say amen
[1:30:02] amen you see faith is literally Faith
[1:30:06] confesses what it is saying it's not
[1:30:09] it's not just a hope so it's not a it's
[1:30:11] not a maybe show it's not a amen I hope
[1:30:14] it comes to pass but faith brother
[1:30:16] bradam says literally sees the promise
[1:30:20] amen it's way out there you can't see it
[1:30:23] in the natural
[1:30:24] amen you might not see it in the visible
[1:30:27] the doctor might not say it you you
[1:30:29] might not see it in that lost child but
[1:30:32] yet Faith sees the promise and Faith
[1:30:36] believes the promise and faith is
[1:30:39] pushing toward that answer amen I wish
[1:30:43] there was somebody here this morning
[1:30:45] that could say I don't care where I'm at
[1:30:47] I don't care what I'm going through I
[1:30:49] don't care what I've got to fight I
[1:30:52] don't care what kind of battles that
[1:30:54] I've got to go through I believe the
[1:30:57] promise amen it's not in what I can do
[1:31:00] it's not in what the doctor can do it's
[1:31:03] not in what anyone else can do but it's
[1:31:05] in the promise of God and I'm walking
[1:31:08] into that Vision hallelujah it's not
[1:31:10] going to come to pass God has showed me
[1:31:14] that it is already mine here this
[1:31:18] morning can you say Amen so
[1:31:22] Revelation is the direct amen it is it
[1:31:26] is amen the
[1:31:29] unmasking of God's plan to
[1:31:32] you it's the
[1:31:34] unveiling or the
[1:31:36] uncovering of God's thoughts that he's
[1:31:39] had in his mind from before the
[1:31:41] foundation of the
[1:31:42] world Revelation is the
[1:31:45] divulging of God's plan in your
[1:31:49] situation now I want you to catch this
[1:31:51] as we preach this morning because you've
[1:31:53] got a see yourself in this last day
[1:31:56] Revelation and if you don't see yourself
[1:31:59] in this last day Revelation you're going
[1:32:00] to be all over the place God don't call
[1:32:03] he's not calling us to be all over the
[1:32:05] place he's calling us to stand stand
[1:32:07] fast amen steadfast in his word and
[1:32:11] believing every promise of God can you
[1:32:13] say Amen When Faith walks into the room
[1:32:17] amen I I I I I love this I've said it
[1:32:19] before amen but when Faith walks into
[1:32:21] the room it turns on the light switch so
[1:32:24] that you can see where you're at he all
[1:32:27] can you say Amen you see lot could not
[1:32:30] see where he was at lot could not see
[1:32:33] amen he could not see the son he didn't
[1:32:36] have a promise of a son he couldn't see
[1:32:38] himself amen fulfilling uh uh the
[1:32:41] promises that Abraham could fulfill
[1:32:43] there was no way that Abraham could
[1:32:45] fulfill it there was no way that lot
[1:32:48] could fulfill it but there was only one
[1:32:51] difference in between them and that was
[1:32:53] direct Revel ation Abraham had met God
[1:32:57] Abraham knew that God was going to
[1:32:59] complete his work so therefore Abraham
[1:33:02] he though he was old and though Sarah
[1:33:05] was old and though the situation looked
[1:33:07] impossible and though everything looked
[1:33:09] like it was all amen just it just looked
[1:33:12] like it was getting worse and worse and
[1:33:14] worse and worse yet there was a hope
[1:33:18] Amen in the heart of Abraham that says
[1:33:20] I'm going to receive that promise I'm
[1:33:22] coming into that promise
[1:33:24] I don't care whether I get old I don't
[1:33:26] care I'm not looking at amen the
[1:33:28] deadness of Sarah's womb I'm not looking
[1:33:30] at the circumstance around me I am in
[1:33:33] the direct orders of God God ordered me
[1:33:37] God ordained me God will fulfill that I
[1:33:40] can't answer for anyone else I will
[1:33:43] answer to what faith has revealed unto
[1:33:47] [Applause]
[1:33:49] me but lot he was looking at the natural
[1:33:52] lot couldn't get past the natural lot
[1:33:55] was looking at the trouble in the church
[1:33:57] lot well that's what the Bible said amen
[1:34:00] there was all the feuding going on and
[1:34:02] amen between the herdsman of lot and the
[1:34:04] herdsman of Abraham and there was this
[1:34:06] that and the other can you say Amen
[1:34:09] Abraham knew God by Revelation showed
[1:34:12] him that Sodom was fixing to
[1:34:14] burn lot he was just as blind as a bat
[1:34:18] lot couldn't understand anything because
[1:34:20] the re Revelation was not there in his s
[1:34:23] oh now I want you to understand aren't
[1:34:25] you glad that you can see the things of
[1:34:27] God aren't you glad for the divine
[1:34:30] revelation that has come your way so
[1:34:32] faith is not an
[1:34:36] imagination faith is not listening to a
[1:34:39] prophet's
[1:34:40] words faith is not Amen in your
[1:34:43] pastor faith is what God does in you
[1:34:48] when you're born again
[1:34:51] [Applause]
[1:34:55] it's that little something right here
[1:34:58] amen that says everything's going to be
[1:35:01] all right a little something in here
[1:35:04] that says I'm a Son of God well praise
[1:35:07] the
[1:35:08] Lord
[1:35:10] hallelujah now right now as you're
[1:35:13] looking at your
[1:35:14] situation amen I'm I'm I'm going I'm I'm
[1:35:17] sidetracking for a moment but while
[1:35:19] you're looking at your situation this
[1:35:21] morning are you looking at the Pro or
[1:35:24] the problem or the promise
[1:35:27] Giver are you looking at your sickness
[1:35:32] or are you looking at your healing are
[1:35:35] you looking amen at your problem or are
[1:35:38] you looking at a Rapture come on what
[1:35:40] what are you looking at this morning
[1:35:43] amen because where you're looking is
[1:35:46] where you're going to be
[1:35:49] walking the Apostle Paul says I I I I I
[1:35:54] run not as
[1:35:56] uncertainly come on and I
[1:35:58] fight not as one that is beating the
[1:36:02] air but I bring my body under the
[1:36:05] control of the
[1:36:07] Revelation that God has given
[1:36:10] me I I I I I'm not going to be like a
[1:36:13] donkey that is just sniffing the a wild
[1:36:16] donkey sniffing the air and running here
[1:36:19] and running there amen but the master
[1:36:22] has put a bride into my mouth the master
[1:36:25] by divine revelation amen has told me
[1:36:29] that you're a goodly horse amen he's
[1:36:31] told me that you are amen you are God's
[1:36:35] choice come on church amen and God the
[1:36:38] Revelation that was once in the mind of
[1:36:41] God Amen that had once hidden in the
[1:36:43] mind of God that was once hidden from
[1:36:45] Luther that was once hidden from Wesley
[1:36:48] that was once hidden from the
[1:36:50] Pentecostals amen there's a revelation
[1:36:53] in this bright amen that you're the one
[1:36:57] that he's coming after that you're
[1:37:01] hallelujah oh can you say Amen you they
[1:37:04] didn't have that Revelation back then it
[1:37:06] was only a it was only just a portion it
[1:37:10] was only a it was just a little bit of
[1:37:13] the picture amen how many's ever put a
[1:37:16] puzzle together hallelujah amen I don't
[1:37:18] have much I I just don't I just don't
[1:37:20] have enough patience Amen to to you know
[1:37:23] to look there at the puzzle and and put
[1:37:25] it together I look at the beautiful
[1:37:27] picture and how many puzzles have I
[1:37:29] started and never finished hallelujah
[1:37:31] amen we look at the picture and we're
[1:37:33] trying to put it together but I just
[1:37:35] want to tell you amen we're not at the
[1:37:37] beginning of the puzzle we're not at the
[1:37:39] middle of the puzzle we're at the

[1:39:59] only in the revealing of the son of man
[1:40:02] that we found
[1:40:04] ourselves with the scepter in our
[1:40:08] [Applause]
[1:40:10] hands if you find yourself with a

[1:46:58] and look northward and Southward and
[1:47:00] Eastward and Westward I want you to know
[1:47:04] it is
[1:47:10] yours now the scripture says there in 2
[1:47:13] Timothy 1
[1:47:16] and9 who had saved us and called
[1:47:18] us with a holy calling not according to
[1:47:21] our works but according to his own
[1:47:24] purpose and
[1:47:26] Grace which was given
[1:47:29] us in Christ
[1:47:32] Jesus before the world
[1:47:35] began it's always been
[1:47:38] there
[1:47:40] Hallelujah but he says but is now made
[1:47:44] manifest that word manifest means
[1:47:46] brought into public view view by the
[1:47:49] appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:47:53] and who is the Lord Jesus Christ the in
[1:47:56] the image of the invisible
[1:48:01] God why is that
[1:48:03] important why is it important that the
[1:48:06] invisible God become
[1:48:11] visible yeah because his sons were in in
[1:48:16] invisible natural bodies
[1:48:20] [Music]
[1:48:23] you were his
[1:48:24] sons you didn't know you were his sons
[1:48:27] and the invisible God had to become
[1:48:32] visible
[1:48:34] hallelu and when the visible God became
[1:48:37] or the invisible God become visible the
[1:48:39] people still didn't know who he was they
[1:48:42] thought he was just another good man
[1:48:43] thought he was just another good Prophet
[1:48:44] thought he was just another good can you
[1:48:46] say am
[1:48:47] man so what did he have to
[1:48:50] do well glory to God God someone punch
[1:48:53] your neighbor and say this is going to
[1:48:55] get
[1:48:57] good
[1:49:00] Hallelujah the invisible
[1:49:02] God there was there's no way that a
[1:49:04] righteous God is ever going to be able
[1:49:06] to look down and to visit a
[1:49:11] sinner no matter how good you
[1:49:13] are amen no God no holy God was ever
[1:49:18] going to be able to do it
[1:49:21] right and yet God God had already made
[1:49:23] the plan God had already said that it
[1:49:26] had to be a Kinsman to come in and lay
[1:49:29] down his life to redeem now that's the
[1:49:32] Old Testament that's the Old Testament
[1:49:34] law in order to be redeemed it required
[1:49:38] a Kinsman to do the
[1:49:40] redeeming we've got a problem Jack he's
[1:49:43] a holy
[1:49:45] God you're trapped in a body full of sin
[1:49:49] and the devil has got all of these leans

[1:50:18] Son of God trapped in a sinful body was
[1:50:23] ever going to fulfill their
[1:50:25] purpose and yet God said the promise was
[1:50:29] given to Adam the man Adam was to rule
[1:50:35] the
[1:50:37] Earth that's
[1:50:40] right you know can you see that God's

[1:52:41] that man am man would represent the
[1:52:45] invisible world through his
[1:52:48] body that man would control the winds
[1:52:55] through his body that man would be able

[1:53:21] minute just a minute but I just want to
[1:53:23] stop here one man
[1:53:25] sin and when Adam used to come Amen
[1:53:29] brother brandham says brother brandom or
[1:53:30] that that Adam and Eve would come to
[1:53:32] God's Cathedral every
[1:53:34] evening and they would walk with God God
[1:53:37] didn't have a body how did they walk
[1:53:39] with God their eyes could see the

[1:53:47] the pillar of fire they walked with the
[1:53:50] pillar of Fire they lived with the
[1:53:53] pillar of fire but one day the pillar of
[1:53:57] fire came looking for his
[1:54:00] son and the son is hiding now why is the
[1:54:03] Sun hiding because sin had separated
[1:54:09] him on now his eyes are closed Adam will
[1:54:12] never see the pillar of fire he can't
[1:54:14] see the pillar of fire he doesn't have

[1:54:38] atom it's going to Hallelujah there will
[1:54:42] be a man walking on Earth that the
[1:54:46] pillar of fire will have authority in
[1:54:49] again
[1:54:53] come
[1:54:56] on for what purpose he's trying to find
[1:54:59] a way to get to
[1:55:02] you now God had Lambs those little lambs
[1:55:05] they they they talked about the the lamb
[1:55:07] Christ the Lamb of God coming for years
[1:55:10] and years and years but once the perfect
[1:55:13] lamb
[1:55:15] came now now now y' y'all stay with me I
[1:55:18] I I'm I'm I'm getting back to my point
[1:55:19] once the perfect lamb came all of those
[1:55:23] other Lambs were no longer needed yeah
[1:55:27] because now God was
[1:55:30] dwelling in
[1:55:32] Jesus come here he was the lamb it was a
[1:55:36] bunch of little lambs little woly lambs
[1:55:39] but now he's
[1:55:41] dwelling
[1:55:43] amen
[1:55:45] amen it's the pillar of fire in
[1:55:50] Jesus all the genetic of God are now in
[1:55:55] Jesus devils are afraid of Jesus why
[1:55:59] come on because it's
[1:56:01] God in a
[1:56:05] body come on
[1:56:09] church it's God in a
[1:56:11] body they didn't want to believe him
[1:56:13] they didn't want to believe it they just
[1:56:15] kept on sacrificing the Lambs and they
[1:56:17] just kept doing this and that and the
[1:56:18] other they said we don't want but God
[1:56:20] was in a
[1:56:21] body and when God Amen you can be seated
[1:56:24] you can God was hung on Calvary the
[1:56:27] Bible says the veil
[1:56:29] rent amen and it showed and exposed The
[1:56:32] Mercy Seat saying it's no longer going
[1:56:34] to be used now God is going to live in
[1:56:37] aen Jesus Christ and Christ paid the
[1:56:42] price for every one of
[1:56:45] you
[1:56:50] sir amen what what does that mean to me
[1:56:53] now Christ has received all the way up
[1:56:55] to the to the heavens
[1:56:59] Hallelujah now are we just supposed to
[1:57:01] just worship a god of
[1:57:03] yesterday or do we have a
[1:57:06] revelation reation
[1:57:10] yeah he's there somebody believes Christ
[1:57:14] is
[1:57:15] there but he sent back
[1:57:17] his spirit
[1:57:23] the pillar of fire is back on
[1:57:26] earth now the scripture says that on the
[1:57:28] day of Pentecost a rushing Mighty Wind
[1:57:32] came and the Holy Spirit that great
[1:57:34] Pillar of Fire split up and there were
[1:57:37] hundred there were tongues of fire fell
[1:57:38] on 120 amen different people now it was
[1:57:43] the pillar of fire not living in the man
[1:57:45] Jesus but now it's the pillar of fire
[1:57:49] living in his sons
[1:57:54] hallah Oh Glory to God can you say Amen
[1:57:58] now something was taking place now
[1:58:01] brother Brandon would say this he would
[1:58:04] say
[1:58:06] Amen brother Brandon would say it was a
[1:58:09] partial word or he talks about the
[1:58:11] partial word that was giving a
[1:58:13] substitute lamb he says now they could
[1:58:16] not have the fullness of that lamb
[1:58:19] because the fullness of the word had not
[1:58:20] come it was a prophet given a little
[1:58:22] here a little there and a little here
[1:58:25] and a little there and little lambs were
[1:58:27] there can can you say Amen but it was
[1:58:31] pointing it was pointing to the Messiah
[1:58:34] the perfect one that was to
[1:58:36] come and when that perfect one come
[1:58:39] brother Brenham would put it this way
[1:58:40] amen he would say he would say now
[1:58:42] notice he says now notice how
[1:58:44] appropriate it was showing that
[1:58:46] Jerusalem was ceasing when it was in
[1:58:48] effect until that hour but the blood of
[1:58:50] the Lamb was all right until that day
[1:58:54] but now at the crucifixion it changes
[1:58:56] things the old system is done this one
[1:59:00] was a new one and the lamb the perfect
[1:59:02] lamb was at the sacrifice the lamb the
[1:59:05] sacrificial lamb was on the grounds they
[1:59:07] were condemning and doing the very
[1:59:10] things that they had to do that is right
[1:59:12] in other words they had to kill that
[1:59:15] lamb right now I I I I I like this
[1:59:20] because the phet had been talking about
[1:59:23] it Abel talked about it all of these
[1:59:26] prophets had talked about it Abraham had
[1:59:28] talked about our possession typed out it
[1:59:31] everything was all typed out but when
[1:59:33] Jesus was standing there he was

[2:21:00] faith to be confirmed because he knew he
[2:21:02] had had a grip on God a revelation that
[2:21:06] I spoke of last night and when the sck
[2:21:07] people in this building the crippled
[2:21:09] people or you that need God when you get
[2:21:11] that type of Revelation that you are
[2:21:13] Justified when you are actually
[2:21:15] justified in asking the thing that
[2:21:18] you're asking for and believe that he is
[2:21:20] a reward of those things those that
[2:21:22] diligently seek after him there is
[2:21:24] nothing somebody say nothing can ever
[2:21:27] separate you from that faith that is
[2:21:31] anchored to
[2:21:34] you now brother bradam says he knew he
[2:21:37] was perfect because he was setting or he
[2:21:41] was worshiping with that sacrifice
[2:21:50] us preachers probably face condemnation
[2:21:53] maybe even more than the
[2:21:55] congregation right the devil fights as
[2:21:58] preachers right
[2:21:59] [Music]
[2:22:01] preachers well you should know better
[2:22:03] well you should do this well you should
[2:22:04] do that you
[2:22:06] right you say well I didn't know
[2:22:08] preachers that's just like you parent
[2:22:09] you you kids think your parents never
[2:22:11] fight anything they
[2:22:14] do they do they fight they fight right
[2:22:18] here but you know what
[2:22:24] job had that
[2:22:26] Revelation and he was anchored to his
[2:22:29] lamb and no matter what the devil
[2:22:31] brought there was nothing that was going
[2:22:32] to turn that Revelation around he was
[2:22:35] solid in his faith that's
[2:22:39] right are you there with your
[2:22:41] lamb there's a lamb interceding for you
[2:22:44] here this morning are you needing
[2:22:46] healing and the devil saying you're not
[2:22:47] worthy of it the lamb is worthy am
[2:22:51] yeah you're needing Deliverance amen and
[2:22:53] you say when the devil say well you're
[2:22:54] you're you're you're not worthy of it
[2:22:56] the lamb is worthy that's yes sir the
[2:23:00] lamb has made me worthy the lamb has
[2:23:03] shed the price the lamb has given me my
[2:23:06] authority in Christ to believe and
[2:23:12] receive amen is that right Joseph living
[2:23:16] under the under under the amen the Revel
[2:23:21] that he was going to rule and then
[2:23:23] pifer's wife or his brothers sell him
[2:23:26] and Pier's wife is accusing him and
[2:23:28] calling him this that and the other but
[2:23:30] they didn't stop the purpose of God he
[2:23:32] reigned anyways come on jealous cor and
[2:23:37] all of the crew was right there telling
[2:23:39] Moses you'll never be you can't be but
[2:23:41] Moses had a revelation that he was God's
[2:23:44] prophet and he stood there upon that
[2:23:46] Revelation and nothing was going to turn
[2:23:48] him from it and car was SW swallowed
[2:23:54] up the three Hebrew boys were standing
[2:23:56] there alone and it seemed like God had
[2:23:59] forgotten all about him here they had
[2:24:01] stood and stood and stood amen and God
[2:24:03] had forgotten all about him there they
[2:24:05] are walking the gain plank to fall into
[2:24:08] the fiery
[2:24:10] furnace but God was there are you
[2:24:14] hearing me Jeremiah was accused of being
[2:24:17] disloyal to the king and was I want you
[2:24:20] to put feed him the bread of sorrow and
[2:24:22] put him down in the in the manure Amen
[2:24:24] in the sess poool Hallelujah when I turn
[2:24:27] back we'll deal with him Hallelujah but
[2:24:31] the prophecy was being fulfilled anyways
[2:24:33] and they had to come back and honor
[2:24:35] Jeremiah and say God Truly Spoke to
[2:24:38] Jeremiah is that right if the musicians
[2:24:41] would
[2:24:42] come God says there's going to be a
[2:24:45] bride in this last day and you stand
[2:24:47] upon that Revelation and the devil's
[2:24:48] right there saying but it's not you
[2:24:50] you'll never be you can't be but you've
[2:24:52] got to stand and watch God vindicate his
[2:24:54] word in
[2:24:57] you stand stand on the Revelation and
[2:25:00] God will vindicate his word in you every
[2:25:08] time why does he bring these assaults
[2:25:10] against the believer why does he bring
[2:25:12] these assaults against the bride of
[2:25:14] Christ he's trying to stop the
[2:25:19] vision on that's right that's right but

[2:42:41] overcome we've had an interceding
[2:42:45] lamb let's put let's put the lamb back
[2:42:47] there in the intercession that brother
[2:42:49] Brandon would call it but it's been in
[2:42:52] this last
[2:42:53] day that the lamb stood
[2:42:56] forth he opened the
[2:42:59] book he opened the
[2:43:02] book right is that what the Revelation
[2:43:06] says and the mighty Angel God the lamb
[2:43:09] sent forth his
[2:43:11] spirit amen I need your help just real

[2:43:31] around you're not you're the prophet You
[2:43:33] Preach you
[2:43:35] point this is the mighty Angel that's
[2:43:38] got the Revelation to the book and he's
[2:43:41] Whispering it up yeah yeah yeah and
[2:43:43] you're whispering and you're
[2:43:46] preaching preach it with conviction
[2:43:50] the lamb is already paid for the price
[2:43:52] but in the last day the mighty Angel is
[2:43:54] going to come down the lamb is going to
[2:43:56] open the book he's going to send it to
[2:43:58] the seventh angel Revelations 10:7 and
[2:44:01] the seventh angel is going as the
[2:44:03] sounding of the seventh Angel's message
[2:44:06] the power is going to be given to the
[2:44:09] sons now the the closed book becomes the

[2:44:57] the mighty
