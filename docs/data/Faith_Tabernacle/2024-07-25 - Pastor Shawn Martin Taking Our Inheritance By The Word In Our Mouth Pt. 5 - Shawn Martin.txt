and so we thank the Lord for that and and if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the Book of Joshua uh the um 14th chapter we've been uh uh using this scripture uh for past few Wednesdays I guess and um thought we'd read it again amen the Book of Joshua the 14th chapter amen had a wonderful time in um Arkansas and good meeting and people seem to have uh been blessed brother um wendam brother Andrew and brother Daryl just done an outstanding job and uh a lot of deliverances took place and so we're really thankful for that and uh just saw a lot of unity um uh there among the churches and and uh so that's that's just really wonderful and um so anyways I've got um ask brother Ben uh PR he's the pastor there in uh where we went to minister but asked him to maybe come and speak for us um on our fall festival and so Lord willing he'll be Mi ministering at that time so we're looking forward to that also um um not this Sunday but the following Sunday brother Matthew mcclard Matt mcclard is is to be ministering for us as well and he's from Indiana I think most I guess most of us know him um but just a wonderful brother and so he's he's going to be ministering for us uh that Sunday and um uh I made a real quick decision today uh this afternoon uh uh found out uh that they're going to be having the funeral well they're going to uh brother Miguel uh his sister as we had announced uh she had passed away and uh they're in North Carolina and so they the body has been returned in their Pony today so they're having a Indian style uh funeral for her and um for and so it's going to be a wake service tomorrow night Friday night and then the funeral Saturday and so it's kind of a big Todo uh for the natives there and uh a lot of them will probably stay up during the night with the body and uh do whatever their ritual is uh but anyway uh made the quick decision I'm going to be flying out tomorrow uh evening and going to be down there for the U funeral um we've known ABA Joe for well ever since she was just a little girl and um and so I wanted to be there with for the family and for brother Wendell and the church and so uh I won't be here Sunday uh this coming Sunday I've asked brother um uh amus to fill in for me and uh so just keep that in mind and we really cover your prayers at um the Lord just be with the family it's a kind of a devastating time uh for them and um so um I I know they would appreciate it and uh pray for me that I get back home safely amen don't fall out of the sky amen praise the Lord I I used to like to fly and the older I get I I just like the ground I just just you know like solid footing amen so Joshua the 14th chapter and the seventh verse will start uh Caleb speaking uh 40 years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh barnea to spy out the land and I brought him word again as it was in Mine Heart nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt but I wholly follow the lord Lord my God and Moses swear on that day saying surely the land where on thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance and thy children's forever because thou H has wholly followed the Lord my God and now behold the Lord hath kept me alive as he said these 40 and5 years even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo I am this day four score and 5 years old as yet I am strong or as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war both to go out and to come in now therefore give me this mountain whereof the Lord spake in that day for thou heardest in that day how the anakims were there and and that the cities were great and fenced if so be the Lord will be with me then I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer before we go into the word father indeed we need you tonight Lord as we see the the chaos around the world and father uh just seems like the enemy is Conquering prevailing over the people but father we're so glad that you bought us you purchased us with your own blood you sealed us with your spirit father and Satan can't get to us and Lord we in this world of trouble in this world of chaos and fear father we have come with in anticipation to meet with you Lord our soul at peace and at rest Lord our faith intact knowing Lord that you promis to be with us you'd never leave us nor forsake us father now Lord we're just asking that you would anoint both speaker and hearer Lord may this service not be in vain but Lord May the word have its effect upon us and those that would be watching online father father may your anointing be Lord wherever they're at and may the word have an effect upon them we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen amen and amen you can have your seats this evening and um you know uh according to Ecclesiastes three God has a time for for everything and uh Ecclesiastes 3:1 it says to everything there is a season a time to every purpose under heaven and and so throughout church history we have uh seen that there is a time not only for the world and not only for individuals but also for the church um there's been seasons and times that the church has gone through but as you know the the question would be I guess uh is what time is it now for the church what season are we living in am and you know the the the prophet said the church has got to keep time with the Bible it's got to keep exactly with the Bible speak uh in time and and she will she's going to she is keeping in perfect timing now we know that we are uh we know the time that we're living in by the types and the Shadows uh that are in the Bible uh the you know the Old Testament was was types and shadows that that that spoke of of future events and things like that and we also know the the time that the church is living in by prophecy uh uh the Fulfillment of Prophecy and and so God gives us uh uh ways to to know uh the time that we're living in and so it is so important that we would know the time and the day that we're living in we certainly don't want to guess we we don't want to uh be one that is living our lives without really understanding what God is doing and expecting of us uh and so uh God as the prophet has taught us that God has allotted his word to each age there's a a certain word that has been allotted uh to to every Age and and and it's it's it's meant for the people of that age to live that word out to fulfill that word and to express it and and so uh uh we find that the elect of that age will fulfill the word for their age and and as we know message Believers we we know that God has always had one in the age to catch the revelation of the word for the age amen and so the the word uh he he he would not leave the people uh without maybe an understanding of what he's doing and so he would raise up uh someone he would predestinate a a a a man uh uh and and which we would know to be a prophet and then the word would come to him the revelation of the word for that age for that hour and then he would let the people know uh what the word is it's like the word for Noah's day uh was revealed to Noah and then Noah uh uh caught that Revelation and began to preach it to the people and and then it would rally the elect uh uh for that age to him and under the message of the hour the word for Moses's day was revealed to Moses and and again Moses would be the one to declare the word for that age and and the people would rally around him and uh that that elect the word for Joshua's day was revealed to Joshua the word for Jesus day was revealed to Jesus and and so they they would Proclaim that word and then God would vindicate them to be the truth ain't that right and so the the the the people and uh that would listen and not only just listen but the they they believed uh the words of of the prophet and uh they were that elect and and and uh uh for that age well the the the Book of Revelation tells us that there are seven Church uh uh uh ages and there are seven Messengers uh and so each age has a messenger uh that is that God would predestinate to that church age and so uh uh brother Brandon would tell it like this the angel of the church catches the mystery of God not fully yet revealed but when he does he catches the mystery of God then he goes forth to the people after the mystery has been given to him he goes forth to the people and what does he do out there he begins to Proclaim that message and what does it start a war a spiritual war and then God takes his messenger with the elect of that age and lays them away asleep and then he drops a plague upon them who rejected a temporary judgment and then after that is over then he goes on and they denominate and bring in denominations and start off with that man's work like of Wesley and all the rest of them then it gets all in a a scruple again and then another mystery comes forth then what happens another messenger arrives on Earth uh uh for a church age then when he arrives the trumpet sounds he declares war then what happens finally he's caught away and then he's laid away then PL Falls and destroys them spiritual death hits the church and she's gone uh that group see and then he goes on to another one oh he said it's a great plan until it comes to that last angel now he has no certain mystery but he gathers up all that's been lost in them other age all the truths that wasn't truly revealed yet as the Revelation come then he reveals those things in his day to the people ain't that right and so then then the the elect are uh is the one who recognizes their day and they recognize their season they they recognize the message that God has sent to them and then the rest of the world goes on as though nothing has ever happened uh they're Tangled in the cares of Life they're entangled with with the PO political uh Powers they're entangled with the religious Powers they're just and and and they don't know what God is is is doing and they don't know what he has done and and so yeah they serve God as in future tense that it's coming coming coming and yet the elect knows that something has happened in their day and and so now our opening scripture is dealing with Caleb uh who has crossed over into the uh the land of Canaan under uh the message of Joshua uh the the the ministry of Joshua and and of course the prophet told us in in adoption series that the land of Canaan is a type it's it it's a type well now I believe and and I believe that the message would back it up that Canaan land is a type of the bright age of of today and and now we would never know that that that terminology phrase or whatever uh if it had not been for the message of the hour I know there's a lot of people that have put a bad name to bride Age and and so a lot of folks don't want to teach it and say it and mention it it becomes a bad word but but we wouldn't know bride age if the prophet hadn't taught it if the prophet taught it if he said it then we can teach it and we can say it amen he's the one that introduced the bride age to us now Canan did not represent the age of the Millennium that's what the prophet said it uh because uh there is no war and and and struggles and things in the Millennium but in the in in in Canaan uh there was there was fighting there was Wars there was conquering and all of these things so what the land of Canan represented was the age of the Overcomer the dispensation of overcoming ain't that right so so then Caleb entered into a land that had been promised under the ministry of Joshua and and notice the prophet said now what is the land promised to the New Testament believer the promise is the holy spirit how many believes that the promise is the holy spirit see and and if you notice Caleb there would have been no way for him to cross over into the land of promise except there was for the except for the Joshua Ministry had no other message could have taken him over it he had to come under the the the the Vindicated word for that age and that was under the ministry of Joshua ain't that right and so so Joshua was the one who God had called to take the people over and and was Vindicated uh by God now and and and so if we look at that then then in the message identification brother brandom starts off by saying this I'm sure tonight that that we ought to find ourselves somewhere in some character of The Bible so so this Bible ought to be a personal book to us it it should not just be a history book it should not just be you know a a book of love or whatever it it it it should be really a personal book to us because we ought to be able to find some character in the Bible that we can identify with today and say well that me well that that's why we look at Caleb tonight and been talking about Caleb is because uh he he is somebody that we should be able to identify ourselves with so he says now we ought to find somewhere in some ourselves somewhere in some character of The Bible so that we would know the outcome of that character and know what our outcome will be ain't that right now if if you're going to identify yourself as Goliath with Goliath well then you know that your outcome is defeat it's it's you're going to be stopped you you what your plans are going to be hindered and and and these things but if you can identify with Caleb well then you automatically know that there's no weapon going to be formed against you that's going to prosper you're going to overcome because that's what Caleb was he was an overcomer now see so brother Braham said Caleb represents the True Believer who stayed with Joshua so how many True Believers do we have amen now now then Caleb is your type Caleb is your type I I know we we're in a world full of trouble and demonic powers are everywhere but if you can take and identify with Caleb then you can find rest for your soul knowing that as his outcome was Victorious your out come will be victorious as well amen see so now from what I see uh Caleb only represents the sons of God for this day uh uh that that we live in and and so uh you know we we read you know uh the our opening scripture was from the Book of Joshua and and and and I guess all of us know this but brother Bram said that book of Joshua should actually be titled the book of Ephesians of the Old Testament and and he says the reason why is because the Book of Joshua parallels with the book of Ephesians of the New Testament see and and and so so the Book of Joshua is a book of redemption the prophet said of the Old Testament you see Exodus was a book of redemption dealing with the coming out two parts of redemption right and so the book of Exodus deals with the first part of redemption coming out of but the Book of Joshua deals with the second part of redemption and that is coming into ain't that right entering into and and so uh uh the the reason for God bringing them out of of Egypt was to take them and bring them into the land of promise it was not God's will for for them to die in the wilderness it was not God's will amen for them to be carried all off amen with Dayan and and Kora and balum and and all of that God sent a message to take them out and to bring them into and and and when God sends something he he he's got a reason to do that ain't that right amen see and so his his goal was his his idea his intention his purpose was to take him out and bring them into that they could partake of their inheritance take them out from slavery take them out from bondage take them out from a Strange Land and bring them in their Homeland not to be defeated not to be slaves amen but to possess their inheritance amen see now we've talked about it inheritance amen is something that has been left uh uh uh by someone else it's it's it's if you've got an inheritance well it was left you uh by someone you don't have to work for it you don't have to earn it you don't have to beg for it uh uh nothing like this it's an act of Grace aren't you glad for Grace it it's an act of Grace So Joshua's Ministry was a Ministry of Grace Amen to bring the people into that which has been given to them amen it was already given amen and they were just to come in and under that Ministry Joshua would place the people in the land of promise in the land of inheritance amen so brother brandom says now the book of Ephesians placed us positionally in Christ what they was in the Holy Land see we're not placed in the Holy Land we are placed in the Holy Ghost aren't you glad for that every promise amen that that God has given you is in the land of the Holy Ghost amen see now Joshua the way he could uh uh uh uh place them in positionally in the land he could only do that by Revelation he would not do that by his own understanding he he it wasn't his ideas he wasn't just guessing or probing at it he did it by Revelation ain't that right now Church no other age no other age has has has been has has had the privilege of being able to cross into the land of promise but this age that we're living in amen we we're we're this is the age that we are to uh uh that we've crossed over into the land of inheritance amen see see the church could not cross over until the denominational ages had run out do you believe that amen the denominational ages had to run out had to seas in order for uh the church to go on into the the land of inheritance you know in the message uh the seed is not air with the Shu uh uh brother brandham talked to three women in the Bible and that was Hagar Sarah and and Mary and and of course you know uh women uh in the Bible represent churches a type of churches and things like that so brother brandham said these three women hey G Sarah and Mary were a type of the three denominational ages Luther Wesley and Pentecost ain't that right amen and he says see the women always types churches three denominate denominational ages carriers which also must die and dry up like the shuck and so forth does to give room for what the seed ain't that right amen see the seed cannot get right or ripe rather until the Chuck stock and leaves are all dry you know they got to be dead every bit of life has got to leave it in in order amen uh uh for the seed to come together the life gathers itself in the seed ain't that right amen see and so uh uh what are these denomination denominational ages well brother Brown said the denominational ages he said they they would pick up a little Doctrine and then they would one would run off to one side with it and and and uh and then go off out on a limb uh uh with it and they'd say well this is it you know nothing else well then someone else would pick up another little Doctrine and they'd run off to that side with it and run off out and on a limb with it and say no this is it you know and and before you know it it was a a fussing and a fighting and and and these things and he says each one builds a denomination under it see denomination did not come from from the spirit of God Amen God didn't start denomination amen but denomination is a result amen of a Revival that God produced amen and then men would grab a hold of an idea and take off with it amen and it wasn't even in God's program at all and and then they would denominate see and and so he says see each one builds a denomination under it until we got hundreds of denominations but still in all of it to see the confusion people are wondering what is truth amen it's brought so much more confusion amen as to what is truth ain't that right well each age each Church age had had truth in it but they didn't have all of it amen see God would bring a little truth amen give a little truth irus and St Martin and Columbus and and uh uh Martin Luther and Wesley and all that brother Brown said they live long enough to bring a little light a little light to that age to shine that little truth to that age ain't that right see but then they left many things in darkness they they they they they didn't have all the truth they they just had a little bit of it ain't that right amen well then Luther come with his his uh uh little light his his Revelation and then the Lutheran ran out on a limb with it and then you you look at Wesley and then the Wesleyan ran off out on a limb with it the Pentecostals ran off on a limb with with what they had and so they ran uh they all ran out on limbs you understand what I'm saying see and and the prophet said the reason why is because the seals had not been broken yet the seals had not been broken this this word was closed up the understanding of this this word was was sealed up amen so men probed at it good men but but they didn't have all the light can you say amen amen and we have all these commentators throughout the church ages we didn't need a commentator we needed a prophet see but but we had the commentators and things but and they wrote significant thing and and smart men but they were only probing at it can you say Amen see and and so uh uh but but then we find that God promised that when these denominational ages run out amen when when they've when when they've done all that they can do and they've run out on all the limbs and and all of these things then the seventh angel would sound amen see now think of that the seventh angel with sound then the book would be opened can you say amen amen the the seven sealed book amen that was closed All Through the Ages now would be made known now I want to tell you what what's the significance of that is this is your inheritance everything in this book that is promised to the church belongs to you can you say Amen see so so the prophet said the Mysteries are promised to be revealed in the end time now notice he said see the lamb comes forth to take the book now watch to reveal the mysteries of God that others have guessed that uh uh in in all these denominational ages then the seventh angel he said see if this book Mysteries is the word of God the seventh angel has to be a prophet for the word of God to come to see the revelation of the word see no priests popes or anything else can get it see the word doesn't come to such the word of God comes only to a prophet always Malachi 4 everybody say Malachi 4 promise such promise such a one ain't that right see and when he come forth he' take all the mysteries of God where the church had got all scrupled up in all these denominations and restore the faith of the children back to the fathers in the world judgment would strike and the Earth would be burnt then the righteous would walk out upon the ashes of the wicked in the Millennium you understand it now see others had guessed at in the denominational age but this see he must be this man the seventh angel of Revelations 10 1-4 the seventh angel has the mysteries of God given to him and finishes all the mystery then left off down through the denominational ages can you say Amen so the denominational ages ceases amen and a People amen now stands in this age not confused not uh uh wondering what is truth and what is not amen they're they're not a part of them denominationally they're not part of that confusion they're can you say amen amen see so he says see if it's he said you see why I I do not strike at my brethren in denominational uh denomination it's the system of denomination see he said there's no need of them trying to know it because it cannot be revealed see it could not be revealed that's according to the word they presumed at it and believed it was there and by faith walked by it but now it is evidently proved can you say Amen now what is the importance of the seventh Angel's message it it is it brings on another Ephesians it brings on it's not just another Ministry that has come and and and a special Ministry like o Roberts and Billy Graham and and T osbor and Jack Cole and AA Allen and all these things and and and you've got even great ministers up today TD Jake Benny henss and and and and what whatever else you know out there amen that that are there but this was the seventh angel sounding a man to bring on another Ephesians can you say Amen not a man coming and standing here and Confused upon the Bible and and Confused upon what is truth and what isn't truth and and speaking his own ideas and speaking his own ways and his own opinion no nothing like that can you say Amen not because of Theologian could not bring on an Ephesians it could not bring the church into the land of promise and positionally place them in the land of promise it could not we needed somebody under an inspiration that could take us over now brother brandom said we're promised according to Revelations 10 according to Malachi 4 and St Luke 2217 uh uh uh and so forth uh and he says that there has got to come an Ephesians to this can you say Amen what's going to bring the Ephesians amen when Revelations 101 through uh SE 7 is is fulfilled amen when re uh Luke 17:30 is fulfilled when Malachi 4 is fulfilled and all these scriptures in there is promising the church and Ephesians when Malachi 4 comes there's going to be an Ephesians to this when Revelations 10:1 amen through seven is fulfilled there is an Ephesians amen that comes to the church I hope you understand he said there is promised it uh friends he said there must come an Ephesians that the Sevenfold Mysteries of the word of God must be unfolded and it's in the Le oysan age that this takes place can you say Amen now we have come through uh a denominational age uh seven Church ages or whatever you want to call it and brother bandam says it's in that denom denominational age that Satan's works are exalted above God's word and manifested works he said the wisdom of Satan is exalted to the throne of worship in man above the Vindicated word of God for the hour our churches proves that by their seminaries and schools of learning that's learned more than God's word knows about it see they think see and they're doctor so and so and teacher so and so and professor so and so has exalted their own Knowledge socalled from Satan see so-called truth above the Vindicated promise of God made clear right before them and man falls for it can you say Amen so that's that's in them denominational ages it's man exalting himself under the inspiration of Satan and exalting their own opinion exalting their own Works above the Vindicated works of God and and the word of God can you say man and so brother Brandon said Satan is trying to prove God Wrong by his scientific achievements he said man's theology explains God's word to the people and makes it of no effect again like he had it in the denominational age when Jesus appeared on the earth remember that Jesus told them there in Mark 713 you have made the word of God of no effect through your tradition and brother Brown said that's their interpretation ain't that right by their in own interpretation they've made the word of God of no effect ain't that right now this tells us that Caleb was not part of that amen he was not part of that it it was the other spies that was part of that because they believe they man uh the people believe the 10 spies and that said they exalted their own word their own knowledge above the word of God and God God said you're able to take it and the people says oh we're not able to take it amen God says there's the promises there that you're inheritance amen and the people and the 10 spies got the people to believe it that they couldn't take it and that that there was no way they could overcome and and there was no way that they could live Victorious you understand what I'm saying and they died they died because they refused to take God at his word ain't that right see and so but Caleb now notice he says we we brother Brown says see we've gone through that denominational age but now everybody say but now we have come to a free age everybody say free age not a denominational age but a free age we're not part of denomination we're not tied to a denominational age amen we are part of a free age we've come to a free age where the Holy Spirit himself comes down and vindicates himself and makes himself known notice and makes every promise that he promised come to pass can you say Amen well that's what Caleb was amen the every promise that God promised did not come to pass in the wilderness it did not come to pass in Egypt oh yeah God God brought them out and God done all these things but the real fulfillment of the word of God was in the promised land can you say Amen now the church the church has had to wait until this time before it could enter into this second part of redemption you see the Joshua Ministry uh uh uh which is the end time message of the hour has come to take us over aren't you glad for that young people listen to me now amen that word this message God has sent this message to you to take you over take you over you're not like them out there you're not like the world you're not like those other churches out there that's playing their rock and roll and and got their fancy things and their lights and and made a a a a show out of the house of God you're not like those things you should not want to be like those things Amen to dress like Jezebels and to dress like like the world and and and and all these things aren't you glad that that God took you know took a prophet and took the shorts off of us guys where we wouldn't act like sissies and and and and and taught us how to dress and taught us how to live and and taught he he he cut us away from all the denominational uh to where we now know that we have the truth in the right baptism and we know that there the truth as to what God kind of a God and how many gods there really are we know the truth we're not standing here confused we have the truth we have the truth we have the truth that we're not just Baptists or Pentecostals and identifying with some man-made Creed but we are the sons and daughters of God in this age we're not part of that denominational system can you say Amen so this end time message this Joshua Ministry has come to take us over and to positionally place us in our land our land hallelujah hallelujah now notice the message this message of the hour has brought forth a resurrection out of dark denominationalism and has brought us into the bright age our Canaan can you say Amen where a free age where the holy spirit is free to move the holy spirit is free to act the Holy Spirit has the preeminence can you say amen amen yes sir it Amen brother Bram said the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power full power it is not touched by denominations it's not tarnished it's not it's not cut and and spliced and taken out and added to and and all of that no no the full maturity of the word can you say that with me the full maturity of the word has turned back back again in full power it's full power and it's being waved over the People by the same signs and wonders that Jesus did back there now I really hope I'm making some kind of a sense to you today amen the Canaan land the full word not partial word full word oh word amen not not not just a Ministry but the same Ministry that Jesus had now is in the church can you say Amen notice the full maturity of the word has come in its full power yes sir now when Luther came he left the Catholic age when Wesley come he left the Lutheran age when Pentecost come and we say the Pentecostal age he left the wesleyian age can you say Amen now that that uh uh the Le ought to seean age or whatever see so so the Holy Spirit fell in 1906 and that's when the church moved on out of Wesleyan age into the Pentecostal age can you say Amen what was the Pentecostal age now people thought that that was the complete restoration it was not the complete restoration am it was only a restoration of gifts can you say Amen uh uh back into the church so it was not the fullness of the Holy Ghost and it wasn't the restoration of power can you say Amen if it was then it would have brought forth the manifestation of the sons of God but it did not bring forth the manifestation of sons of God Amen see the Pentecostal age only restored the gifts back into the church brother Bram said speaking in tongues gifts of healing and things to the church see and they did they did exactly what the scriptures said they would do and when they did they manifested it ain't that right but notice brother Brown says but do you realize we've moved on from that amen if Pentecostal age if 1906 was the fullness of restoration then there would be no need to move on but a prophet says we moved on we moved on well there's no other Church there's no other age outside the Pentecostal age but brother God would God would through the prophet would tell us there is an age and that's a bright age a bride age what is it we're moving on into an eternal age can you say Amen so he says see but did you realize we've moved on from that we are in the bride time the selecting time the time that the bride they said we would have see all the C all the caterpillar left said Joel 2:28 the Palmer worm eaten and the what all the palmerworm left the Locust eaten see each one of those organizations if you've read the Seven Seals of the Bible each one of those reformers went forth and preach the word but left something off then what did they do after the reformers over um and the light uh began to dim out instead of walking on into further light they organized denominational age right see and when they organized that we believe this light see this is the light this is it see and what did they do Wesley come right on and moved away from them what did Wesley do he organized after him uh his brother John and Charles and Along come Asbury and all those see and after their days they organized what was called the Methodist Church what did they do they rejected further light they just said you know this is the light this is it then come along the Pentecostal and show them up that God still sends down the baptism of the Holy Ghost he still brings down his power of healing which they've denied and what did they do walked right away from them because it was another light but what is it now what is it now he says see we passed around 60 years the Pentecostals has organ ized we are this we are that and God has walked away from it out in Yonder and bringing forth a bride can you say Amen a bride and elect out of that group which there will never be another church age naal age there'll never be another age that we pass on to another to another no you are that one you are that Caleb the finally cross over Jordan into the promised land and receive the benefits of The Inheritance can you say amen amen see so he says there there will never be another church age the Philadelphian Church age was Wesley the leysan church age is the Pentecostal organization not the bride Pentecostal organization can you say Amen we're not part of that Pentecostal organization amen yes sir so brother Brandon would identify us in our part is a bride age can you say Amen good so so the lsan church age is the Pentecostal organization which all goes right straight into the mark of the beast but we're not going there we're not part of that amen can you say amen amen see that's the Bible as this brother was saying a few minutes ago is true right they're they're all them organizations because they refuse to walk in further light they organized themselves saying we believe this and when God does something check it with the scripture the Pharisees said we have it the Sadducees said we have it but God had it and God has turned on the key and showed the light it was rejected like it's always been the Catholic Church rejected Luther Wesley rejected Luther see uh and and so also the Pentecost rejected Wesley and the Holy Spirit today is rejecting the Pentecostals see you're just you're getting just as formal and cold as the rest of them and we know that to be truth years later we know that the Pentecostal are sitting dead cold formal can you say Amen so then where are we at what's our season it's seed time can you say that with me it's seed time it's seed time now what does that mean well each dip or each age had a dip of the Holy Ghost had a portion of the Holy Ghost each age had a portion it's just like it was in the Old Testament each age had a portion of the Holy Spirit and and each uh uh each manifested the word alloted for their day and and Elijah had a portion David had a portion Jeremiah had a portion amen they all had a portion of the Holy Spirit and and notice they all spoke of Messiah to come ain't that right their lives spoke of the Messiah their word spoke of the Messiah amen they were all looking for messiah to come they spoke of what he would do and what he would be and all that but then there come a time amen that the word became in its in fullness the word the entire word amen of the Old Testament speaking of Messiah became flesh can you say amen amen the word came in fullness full manifestation brother BR said the entire word everybody say the entire word was made flesh Among Us the entire word was made flesh Among Us so no longer just teaching about it no longer singing about it but now it was being lived one man Liv living what Isaiah said one man living what Jeremiah had prophesied one man living what Moses had predicted and prophesied one man living what Abel had typed out and and and and all uh uh these these uh prophets and sages of old had had lived out and prophesied and sung about promise upon promise upon promise upon promise was being fulfilled in one man because the entire word had now come flesh amen can you say Amen what was Jesus Christ brother Brown said he was all what the prophets were plus everybody say plus the rest of God that's right he was all that the prophets were plus the rest of God that's good right amen now Luke 17:30 tells us that the son of man is going to be revealed again amen and the day when he would be revealed would be the days a day like the days of Noah in the days of lot ain't that right and we could all truly say as Bible Believers and message Believers that we're living in that day amen and you say Amen what does that mean we have come back to the full maturity of the word as it was when he walked the Earth yes hello amen every promise that has been spoken of this bride is our [Applause] inheritance do you believe that yes sir it's our inheritance I believe it amen hallelujah all that God was he poured into Christ yes sir all that Christ was he poured into the church so the word is being made flesh in our flesh right and the prophet said with the restoration of the word comes the restoration of power the full word brings full power can you say Amen or we could say full Authority full Authority so what are we talking about adoption to where you you you your name is just as good as the father's name Amen on the check Hallelujah can you say Amen the father has been running his business he's been conducting it everyone is having to talk to the father yeah about things and the father writes out the checks and the father does this and this and that amen but the time of adoption he steps back and the son comes forward and everyone has to answer to the son it's the son writing his name on the check it's his it's the son conducting the business as the father did why because the authority has now been given to the son can you say amen amen Pentecost uh 1906 did not bring the manifestation of sons of God it's in this age by the message of the hour has brought us into an Ephesians placing Us in the land and giving us the authority to claim our inheritance amen hallelujah do you believe that so what is the bride of Christ she is all that fell on the day of Pentecost plus the rest of God glory can you say amen amen did you know the day of Pentecost did not reveal the son of man that's right I know there's a teaching that that says that it was the son of man revealed on the day of Pentecost that's that's wrong brother Bram never taught it the Bible never taught it there's only one promise of the son being revealed again and that's in this age Luke 17:30 brother Brandon said when he returned on Pentecost he was the son of God again on the day of Pentecost in another place on the day of Pentecost the word came and was in the form of Son of God another place we find after his death burial and Resurrection he came on the day of Pentecost as Son of God God the spirit in the form of Holy Ghost what was he doing he was changing himself making himself known to his people in a different form like the Holy Spirit which is God he came to deal through the church ages as Son of God the Holy Spirit on another place on the day of Pentecost he changed himself from being son of man to the Son of God can you say Amen but in this age it's been promise that the Son of God would be changed back to son of man again the fullness of the word would now be made flesh not in one man but in a multiple group of people that is part of the body of Jesus Christ The Authority that Jesus had to do the works you've got that authority to do them same Works sir I hope you understand that Authority that's where we're living Hallelujah bright age what is it the fullness of God returned the fullness of the word the full manifestation of the power not in a man called Jesus Christ but in a me many membered body can you say Amen in sons of God Daughters of God who make up the bride of Christ amen if you notice brother Braham said God is calling a church to Perfection that's right by his word by his word think of that calling his church to Perfection What kind of a Perfection sinless Perfection no a Perfection that every part of the word that has been spoken of the Bride has come to manifestation a Perfection can you say amen that's right Jesus was that perfect Masterpiece God dwelt in that body the fullness of God dwelt in that body on ain't that right sinless perfect body yes hello he fulfilled all the word that was promised of him so much that Jesus said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but they testify of me the church couldn't testify of him the bishop couldn't testify of him and he wouldn't appeal to that denomination to testify of him because they called him a be elub they called him this and they called him that and ended up crucifying but Jesus could take his ministry his life back to the word all right and tell them I'm identified here amen and so is it in this bride today we are identified here every promise every promise so here's the fullness of the word the lamb opened that book and as we know amen John wept amen he wept because if no man was worthy to open that book all creation would be lost amen there would be no way that we could come into that inheritance there'd be no way that we could come in and claim what is rightfully ours we would be doomed all creation will be doomed creation is waiting for the manifestation of sons of God because we are the head of creation man is the head of creation when man fell everything under him fell with him but when he is restored everything is restored with him can you say amen and so John knew that it was important for this book to be open and and when the lamb opened the book John began to shout and scream and what a worship brother brand said it was time for worship ain't that right and he says John done so he worshiped he screamed he hollered he said he must have saw his name he must have been able to identify with every promise he saw the promises for what it was and it become a personal he saw his inheritance that's right he saw that he had inherited you're not bound for hell you've got an inheritance amen you're not bound for Destruction you've got an inheritance praise the Lord can you say amen amen oh do you love him so now God is calling a church to Perfection by his word and she will be perfectly restored by the opening of the seven sealed book do you believe that amen amen yes sir amen so brother Bram said what good would have done Martin Luther to continue on with the Catholic message what good would it done Wesley to continue on with the Lutheran message what good would have done the Pentecostals to continue on with the Methodist message or what good will it do Pentecost to continue on with the brides when the brides being called we're right up into the seed time we're here at the in time another place if I taught you a Methodist message it would take no effect on you this is bright time that's why we cannot mix Methodist with the with the message of the hour can you say amen that's not our inheritance can you say Amen so he says if Moses taught the message of Noah it would take no effect if Jesus taught Moses message it would take no effect because the predestinated seed are laying there that will only be watered by that type of water that's GI for that seed you understand what I'm saying if you are a predestinated seed for this age there's only one thing that can water that and that's the message of this hour it's the only way you you cannot stay in the Pentecostal age and be content with what they had amen it's called for further light it's called for the mature purity of the seed and only the message can do that for us can you say Amen another place the end time message should meet end time conditions where they've got off the message ought to bring it back always the end time message meets end time conditions all the way through the scripture it'll have to do it this time a call back to the original word not inheriting some doctrine of man we're not here inheriting some theology some Creed or whatever you want to call it we are inheriting what has been left us from the foundation of the world God has purposed in his mind before the foundation of the world to give you everything that you need he already purpose he's predestinated you to be Sons and Daughters of God it's written in the book yes amen can you say amen hallelujah he's predestinated you to be justified called glorified it's already there so he says this is not a Pentecostal age this is the latterday age this is the bright age this is the evening light this is when Malachi 4 must be fulfilled to follow God's pattern and I will say to you brother Brandon was not the only one to fulfill Malachi 4 that's right he was the prophet of Malachi 4 but there was a people that was to have their hearts turned back to the original Faith by his message we're part of Malachi 4 and that Malachi 4 is being fulfilled amen hallelujah that's the truth so he says see we're not living in a Pentecostal age we're living in another age we're not living in a Methodist age we're living in another age we're living on up here to the bright age the calling out of the church and getting it together for the Rapture not getting it together for tribulation not getting it together for World Council of churches not getting it together for for the grave amen but getting us together ready for the Rapture the Rapture is our inheritance the Bible says so we that are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them uh in the air amen praise the Lord bless the name of the Lord I love it so he says that's the age that we're now living in to my honest opinion that's exactly the truth amen so this is not Luther's age this is not Pentecost age this is bride age bride age as Moses called a nation out of a Nation Christ today is calling a church out of a church you see the same thing in type taking them to the glory Eternal Promised Land Hallelujah do you love him another place I'm coming to you with the message that that sign Vindicated what did the church he said no it never denominated but what happened to the denominations over this revival what did they do they went straight into Leota amen millions and millions and billions of dollars poured into it and she's become Big and Rich and she builds millions of dollars worth of property and things like that and to receive the message no indeed they turn it away what is it it's the husk pulling away from the wheat that Pentecostal husk is pulling away so that you can ripen into every promise that God has for you amen oh church I hope you understand everything that Jesus Christ died for Belongs To You Right do you believe it I believe that's where our faith ought to be right now don't walk with your head down walk with your head up don't walk like a beggar walk as though you are as a Son of God for you are a son of God and if you are a son of God you are air to everything that belongs to Christ that Christ died for it's yours amen everything hallu everything can you say amen he said see so the the husk pulling away from the wheat now the wheat must be that way to lay in the presence of the sun why must it lay in the present Sun you are that wheat predestinated seed of God aren't you glad for that you're you're not shuck you're not tossle you're not whatever you are the seed and the seed must lay in the presence of the son to turn to to a Full Gospel everybody say Full Gospel golden grain for the master what is this message doing to us not educating us no no no we who are laying under that sun presence of the sun we are ripening to the Full Gospel do you believe that we must lay in the presence of the son to turn to a Full Gospel now notice then what does he mean by Full Gospel well brother Brown said what the Full Gospel means is to express Jesus Christ in the power of his resurrection and all the fullness of his promises that the Holy Ghost manifest these things and make them right that God has promised and he will do it you see what God would send the message for you see the power of this message to listen to the message to believe the message and turn away from unbelief and everything in your life and lay hold to this message it's turning you to the Full Gospel where Jesus Christ is manifesting himself in you in the power of his resurrection and every promise he promised in this bride to this bride is being manifested and reflected through your body Hallelujah being positionally placed in the word Hallelujah that's good praise God Amen brother Braham said the Holy Spirit has come upon us in the last days and identified himself right in our church and has proven the same works that he did when he was here in the fullness Upon Jesus Christ he did the same thing upon the bride and doing the same thing do you believe that do you believe you're part of that well some of you do amen we're part of that the same power that Jesus had not that Paul had I thank God for what Paul had I thank God for what they received on the day of Pentecost amen but it didn't bring forth the ministry of Jesus Christ it did not produce son of man it's in this day that you have been given the privilege to become the manifested sons of God to take the authority over the devil and claim every part of your inheritance Heaven is m M Redemption is mine the body change is mine healing is mine Deliverance is mine victory is mine the Rapture is mine that Eternal City is mine an incorruptable body is mine that's my inheritance Hallelujah death has no hold upon that believer do you believe it the Holy Ghost has come upon us in this last day and identified him self right in our church proving the same works that he did when he's here in fullness Upon Jesus Christ he is doing the same thing upon the bride ify musicians will come brother Bram said another place the last thing that the church is going to see is Christ manifested in his power in fullness in his church just before the fire falls and if you're sitting here waiting for that and you're saying well that's going to come don't you let that pass you by look for it now now can you say Amen if there's anything that's holding you back any unbelief take that thing and destroy it take bitterness and destroy it fight against it whatever you got to do fight against it take God at his word take godall take God at his word Lord let this word message come on you and ripen you oh praise the name of the Lord do you love him it's our inheritance I believe God I believe him over it all I believe him wonderful Hallelujah yes sir so what does it do it makes you an overcomer for now you've come into the age of overcoming makes you an overcomer that's right just like Caleb did when he had nothing to overcome in that Wilderness he had nothing to overcome Amen in Egypt or whatever you want to call it amen all the way through there was nothing he wasn't possessing anything in Egypt he wasn't possessing anything in Esau's land moab's land balam's land uh uh uh whatever land he was he was walking through he he wasn't possessing nothing it was not his inheritance but when he come over into that Promised Land he become the Overcomer yes sir as I've told you last Wednesday that's when the Giants that's when the enemy become more real than anything in in that Journey it become more real to him when he walked into that Promised Land there they were guarding his inheritance trying to keep him away from that inheritance they were inhabiting that inheritance and now he had to look at them and command them to leave whatever it would take he had to deal with that enemy you understand what I'm saying it's in this age that every demon power has been Unleashed in this age because there's a people that have crossed over over into that promised land land of inheritance but as I've said before it wasn't up to Caleb to fight that giant it wasn't up to Caleb no God was with him God had already promised I'll go before you I'll drive him out I'll go before you so really what he was doing what Caleb was doing was dealing with a defeated enemy God had went before them and now Cale was just dealing with a defeated enemy and so are you dealing with the defeated enemy that enemy ain't got no power over you ain't got no say so over you ain't got no legal rights over you Hallelujah aren't you glad for that yes sir we have every right we have every right to possess this is the age for you to take your Mountain give me my Mountain Hallelujah do you love him hallelujah hallelujah
