the time the things that are going on amen and there's one thing we we want to be ready amen and I believe that every promise in this book is a reality to the bride of Christ amen we should be under expectation a man to leave here any day amen and the musicians can be dismissed it's just good to see everyone that has come to the house of the Lord and got several missing some sick I guess and and um and then it's good to see those that have been gone uh recovered that have recovered from sickness as well and and so uh but we just carry right on Amen and give the devil black eye praise the Lord and so it's again just good to have everyone and brother Tim sister Teresa God bless you all and really enjoyed the song and enjoy brother Tim singing amen got a good voice praise the Lord amen but if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the Book of Psalms the 23rd chapter and um praise the lord lord is good to us and we've just a beautiful day today serve the Lord and amen and just makes you ready for spring a man to hit I uh one of the ministers on our chat says y'all y'all just Praises we we got blizzard conditions coming like really and uh anyway so they're in a blizzard and uh so uh and we're in Bahama weather close close amen but uh anyways we'll take what we can amen before we go into the word let's just bow our heads and talk to our Lord father truly it is a privilege to be in your house tonight to worship you and Lord we just ask that you'd forgive us of all of our sins our failures God and may your blood just cover us all here tonight father may your blood speak for us Lord we could lift up holy hands without wrath or doubting have total confidence in that atonement that you made father and Lord based upon that atonement we're asking that you would just come and move Among Us and speak to every heart Lord and work the supernatural Lord I pray that you would take control Lord of my lips father and take control of the people's hearts and years Lords and and may you be glorified tonight give us greater understanding of your word we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen uh the book of Psalms the 23rd chapter uh starting at the first verse and said the Lord is my shepherd I shall not one he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures eliteth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul eliteth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake amen you can have your seats this evening and um tonight I'm just going to be referring a lot of scriptures and um but we have been speaking uh about being led in the paths of righteousness and the Lord being Our Shepherd and and as we've seen brother Brandon said uh uh righteousness is is his word amen so we we could say it that he leads me in the paths of his word not in any in any other thing but the paths of his word it's always the word of God and so I I believe as as we've talked about it uh but I I believe it's safe to say that uh this the paths of righteousness he leading Us in the paths of righteousness is uh for us it's dealing with the second part of redemption which is going into uh I I believe that we are uh in uh the promised land which in one place brother Brown said the land of adoption and it has to do with that third pull Ministry brother Bram talks about and if you remember we we uh mentioned where brother Branham uh talked to the vision he had and he was standing on the map on a map of Palestine and he was at the Jordan River and he was looking across there but he said he looked back at where he came from and he said he was two-thirds of the way uh there he had already gone two-thirds of the way uh which I believe uh was speaking of the first and second pool of his ministry and so but then he looked across uh uh Jordan River and he said oh praise God just on the other side is where all the promises lay every promise lays in the promised land now he was speaking this in the message uh Paradox in 1961. and so I believe that it was it was God letting the church know what was fixing to happen uh uh there and that the ministry was getting ready to change and so in 1962 now he said that in in 1961 and in 1962 uh brother Branham says now watch close this is going to have a spiritual background let us now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb as we see the promised land coming in sight it's nearing the time to be given Joshua in Hebrew means Savior and represents the promised end-time leader to take the church over and Caleb represents the True Believer who stayed with Joshua amen so this is why we stand with Joshua ain't that right and we know that brother Rams says that Joshua is the Holy Ghost but he also said Joshua or the Holy Ghost is the prophet you know he was the prophet in Isaiah's age he was the prophet in Elijah's day so he's the prophet in our day as well ain't that right it was it the the real Prophet is God Amen and so this is why we we follow the message of brother Branham because we realized it wasn't just a man uh God had his picture taken with him to show that it was God a man that was leading us ain't that right and so in 1965 after the seals are open brother Branham identified the third pool as being the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed and then he says there is no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word and remember the third pool was see it was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word of God Amen and so as based upon these things then we can look and say as the elective God we are now in the promised land the land of the open book by the message of the hour now remember when Jesus died brother Brandon says you know that well the Bible says it that when Jesus died that the veil in the temple was is rent from the top to the bottom amen and and you go in in listening to the messages the Mighty God unveiled and brother Branham talks about that and ties it to our day and it's important um uh uh that if to to go listen to that if you if you can but he said see God took the temple and tore it to pieces that they might see God in plain view and they was too blind to see it and he's done the same thing today putting his word right out in front what he promised ain't that right see and he's speaking this now after the the seals have been opened and he said so the same thing that was done there has been done today in this age and and and that was a natural Veil that brother Branham said today the veil is is a veil of traditions the veil of Creeds the veil of of these things but God has torn down them veils that's why brother Branham hit them uh uh denomination so hard he blasted that thing because it was God tearing down the veil for you and I ain't that right amen he had to tear down the veil so we could see God in plain view and so he says see he's done the same thing putting his word right out in front what he promised every promise in the word is laying right before us in plain view he says you know what the Gentile Church does the same thing the Jewish Church did too blind to see it and Saul it'll be on their hearts just as it was in that day and remember Paul says that the veil was on their heart ain't that right amen they couldn't believe they couldn't understand they couldn't see oh they they could read the scriptures but the their their heart was void of understanding and so is it today ain't that right so as as we're looking at this walking in the paths of righteousness in the land of the open book where we've got the promises all there right before us and and and so this if you'll notice is this has to do with more than just walking through the land amen and and and observing all of our surroundings and and say oh wow that's nice and that's nice and and oh yes yes yes he did promise that and yes he yes he promised this and oh yeah that that's really nice and and all that amen but this is has the has to do with doing this is about doing or fulfilling righteousness can you say man remember Jesus said it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness that's right so he came the prophet said to fulfill all the word that the prophets had spoke of him he healed the sick to fulfill the word he raised the dead to fulfill the word he said at Liberty them that are bruised to heal the uh uh to fulfill the word in the gospels in the four gospels that talk about Christ's life a scripture after scripture amen was fulfilled and and and and and and he did things that it might be feel fulfilled he said things that it might be fulfilled he went to places that it might be fulfilled and you look look at it it says and this was done that it might be fulfilled and he said this that it might be fulfilled and and everything all around him because he had come to fulfill the scriptures ain't that right amen not to talk about enough to prophesy of something he was the one that they had prophesied Earth a man and so all around him the prophecies that were waiting for him to come they were laying there in the in the scripture in the word just laying dormant amen uh uh waiting for him to come we're now being fulfilled because he had finally come to Earth ain't that right amen and so the same thing is happening today if you could look and and realize what is going on Amen now brother Branham lets us know this too he says we see a roar in the paper across the television out across the Nations where five stars fell in line with the world what's five a number of Grace every time those stars come then something happens on the earth ain't that right Isaiah sister Jane you was telling me five stars July up a few months ago and and and most people didn't even know it a man see but but but but it has a significance of and he says every time they line up amen it it's for a reason see and so here it is now something happens on Earth what taken place five stars fell in what was it introducing he said see since uh uh since then just look what's taken place Germany almost washed off the map some of the Mad guys said that the world would burst like a watermelon every distressful things prophesied by them for the last days looks what's taken place England the other day had a storm that blowed away seventy thousand houses in one day disasters everywhere California Los Angeles like to wash into the ocean what is it it's the beginning of Sorrows earthquakes has picked up everywheres why five stars have come in line and it's God's grace ain't that right five is the number of Grace he said what's happened why what what why what is all this about an infant Church Hallelujah a bride infancy that the power of God has begun to fall on Earth and she's taken form a bride for this bright groom ain't that right he says see that three stars meant his Perfection of the heavenly father in the Trinity becoming one on earth Among Us Now God's offices or he says that that was God's office is becoming one but what happened now it's the Church of the Living God coming together under the word of God and the astronomic heaven is announcing her approach ain't that right amen so we we we're looking at this that we are a special group of people amen as three stars lined up for his birth a man when he first come now we've got five stars which is a number of Grays announcing the approach of the bride of Christ another Masterpiece a man say so notice now look what's happening today the foolish virgin a man is crying out for oil you can you see it everywhere they're they're crying out for a move of God they want that oil uh uh there Israel has been restored to its Homeland a man which fulfills what Jesus said that the Fig Tree about the Fig Tree putting forth its buds Jesus said there in Luke 21 29 a man breaking in behold the Fig Tree and all the trees when they when they now shoot forth and you you see and know of your own cells that summer is now my hand so likewise when you see these things come to pass know ye that the kingdom of God is at hand ain't that right so Jesus was pointing to a day and and and were in that day amen to think of it he would speak that 2000 years ago or or maybe over and would prophesy and them scriptures have been laying dead and were dormant for all these years until this age right here amen and we know that the fig tree has always been the Jewish Nation amen and and that fig tree has budded a man for the prophet said Israel is in her Homeland today amen but not only has the Fig Tree brought forth its leaves but all all the trees has brought forth their leaves brother Brown said them trees are the denominations a man putting forth their leaves the Presbyterians the Methodist the Baptist the lutherans the Pentecost all the churches putting for their leaves revival can you say amen amen and they're speaking of Revival they're saying Revival is hitting everywhere amen and so we can see that the that that that the leaves are putting forth a man or the trees are putting forth their their leaves but it had to wait for this day look at Russia that was a nothing it was a nobody it was it was there uh uh just just a uh a little thorn in in in in in in the side so to speak but now amen Russia which the Bible calls the King of the North and and there's a prophecy laying for Russia amen and talks about it there in in Revelations in Daniel I believe and all that and now where is Russia she has risen up in prominence Amen in in position in in the world today everybody recognizes Russia everybody fears Russia and look at her flexing her muscles out as as there she's got prominence because there's a word concerning her ain't that right but it had to wait for this hour it had to wait for this day a man see and so brother Bradham in speaking of Jesus said he believed what God Said was truth Jesus believed that what God Said was true and the words must be fulfilled and he knew what his life was to fulfill them so Jesus knew he he had purpose amen he could see himself in the book and every scripture that concerned the Messiah he knew that he would fulfill that amen but the prophet said you're here to fulfill it as well amen the time has come amen for us as we're in this land of promises amen not to look at everything and observe and say wow that's cool amen and pass it to another generation you are the people a man of the book you are the people a man that a prophet came amen and God delivered us into the promised land as Joshua delivered the people into that promised land and I say to you it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness can you say Amen now notice brother Brown said in order for Jesus to fulfill the word of God he had to be the expression of God's word amen he had to be amen and and so I looked up that word expression it means something that manifests or embodies see so he had to be the expression of God's word in order to fulfill all righteousness amen and so the Bible speaks of Jesus saying that he was the visible image of the invisible God he was the image and the prophet said the visible image of the invisible God ain't that right amen so God was in flesh to fulfill his Divine word every promise amen now notice as we're going here and just hopefully I I can uh it'll bring it clear to us but James 1 22 uh breaking in he says be ye doers everybody say be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving yourself see so you got a responsibility amen be doers of the word for If any man be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is likened to a man be holding his face as natural face in a glass or a mirror for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgetth what manner of man he was my eye see but whosoever looked us into the perfect law of Liberty and continuous therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed ain't that right then you go to Paul uh in Romans 2 13. he tells us that it isn't the hearer of the law or the word a man that are just before God but the doers of the law amen shall be amen amen Psalms 15 and 1 Lord who shall abide in the Tabernacle a man who shall dwell in my holy heel and and and he that walketh uprightly and worketh righteousness ain't that right amen see thy Tabernacle that that that body that that a word body see amen who who's going to dwell a man in that Holy Hill who's going to dwell in that City Amen in other words is what he's saying amen it's the one that woke us uprightly and worketh worketh not heareth worketh righteousness and speaks uh the truth in his heart amen Psalms 22 and 30. a seed Shall Serve him and talking of of Christ and and his seed a seed Shall Serve him and it shall be counted to the Lord for a generation and you remember amen the the the uh the question and out from Isaiah who shall declare his generation for he was cut off from the land of the living he ain't got a seed so to speak he was cut off so who's going to declare him amen but then he promised that there would be a seed that would declare him ain't that right and church that we are that seed and a seed Shall Serve him and it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation they shall come and shall declare his righteousness or Express his righteousness unto a people that shall be born that he hath done this amen righteousness amen job 29 14 it says I put on righteousness and it clothed me amen Psalms 132 9 let thy priest be clothed with righteousness and the Bible says we are Kings and Priests unto our God ain't that right be clothed with righteousness Isaiah 61 and 10 I will greatly rejoice in the Lord my soul shall be joyful in my God for he hath clothed me with the garments of Salvation he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom deck as himself with ornaments and as a bride adorneth herself with jewels my Revelations 19 and 7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come how many believes were rare for the marriage of the Lamb hey any day we're going to that marriage supper any day we are the people amen there is no other generation there is no other age you are the finale amen you are this scripture right here Amen Let us be glad and rejoice give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife everybody say his wife now that's you now his wife hath made her self-ready amen see it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints can you say man see and and then the prophet Raptor reading that says she is clothed in his righteousness it shows that she is a word Bride Can you say man amen for the prophet said the Garment she had on was his own word and she was dressed in his righteousness so so the this bride amen what you're dressed with what you're clothed with is his word amen aren't you glad for that amen every promise a man that we're we we that have spoke of this day is the thing that will close you amen and dress you amen for the for this wedding supper hey ain't that right now in in First John 3 and 7 amen he says little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous ain't that right so got the same righteousness amen not not different righteousness but as he is righteous he that doeth righteousness is righteous as he is righteous ain't that right and the word doeth there means fulfilled a man see so he that fulfills righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous now notice the Bible is prophesied of a people in this day that that would have a form of godliness amen just to form and this is completely different a man from from fulfilling righteousness it's just a form a man and the word form is a visible shape or configuration of something it's it's a body of a person or thing it's it's the external appearance ain't that right amen so so example the Brazen serpent there in the Old Testament it was it was it was shaped as a snake as a as a serpent but it wasn't a serpent it was just the form of a serpent right it was just a form amen it had no life and so and and that's just one of the things that we can look at but but let's look at it in the spiritual sense amen that that the Catholics they they have all kinds of statues that they prayed to some of these Idols are made in the form of a woman a man called Mary or some other name see and then some of these Idols are made in the form of a man which yeah uh they call Jesus or Peter or or Saint something else you know amen but none of these have life amen they just they they they are they are a form of something ain't that right a man's seat and so a form of godliness is something that human beings practice yet there is no Godly life a man that is there is just a form it's a form but yet it's devoid a man of God ain't that right amen you you could have a church and it just has a form amen with without the life of God and and so that's that's what the prophet is saying or uh uh Peter is saying godliness without God is just a form ain't that rap godliness without God is just a form amen I'm getting somewhere now and so as uh since after the fall of Man there have been all kinds kinds of forms of religion all kinds of forms of religion Creeds darkmas in in all of these things and the prophet said that Satan is bringing his bride to him in a form of religion called dogmas and Creeds it's just a form ain't that right now one thing I have noticed a man is that legalism thrives on forms of religion it it thrives on forms and man-made leadership takes preeminence in forms of religion it could be one man dictating a group of people look take Nimrod for example or even the pope a man they're dictating over a a people and and they've got their own form of worship a form of religion form of of of of of of of whatever seek or it could be the leadership of a group of men such as the Pharisees and the Sadducees and and today it would be called denominations and it's just a form a ritual a a dictate of of men to where a preacher couldn't preach the truth a man without answering a man to the headquarters you understand what I'm saying it's a dictate of men a man in the form of religion or it could be an individual dictating his or her own life such as Cain did ain't that right so any religion outside of God's leadership and Direction and power amen constitutes a form of religion a man see and so we see that a form of godliness is just nothing just another form of of religion one writer said forms in Christianity are mostly familiarly uh uh uh dictates of church Authority or tradition Church government uh liturgy uh uh Doctrine see so so that that that's what becomes the dictate in forms of Christianity see is a church Authority traditions and and all that and and so they he says the the pattern of religious practice is a form of religion just go to church go do your thing amen listen to the preacher do this do that live by colds live by conduct live by the rules of the church and all of that that is just the form ain't that right but we're not talking about form amen we're talking about fulfilling all righteousness can you say Amen example there are Catholics and Protestants alike who have confessionals a man which follow forms that are dictated by Church Authority or Traditions amen amen Catholics just don't come up to the altar like we would or kneel at a at a at a Pew like we would and and and talk to God they they've got their statues they've got their candles they've got their priests they've got their confessional that's a form of religion ain't that right well denominations do too amen they have their form of religions and and all of these things and so uh with this form of religion and form of godliness or whatever self-righteousness everybody say self-righteousness is exercised in forms of religion or godliness and every denomination or non-denomination has a form of godliness with the exception of those who are part of the bride of Christ a man and self-righteousness is only a form amen but it has no power to fulfill all righteousness so every form of godliness the forms of religion amen it it only exercises self-righteousness ain't that right amen uh uh that that's right see so the righteousness though that David is speaking of is not a self-righteousness amen uh the Lord is not leading Us in the paths of self-righteousness ain't that right amen now denominations will lead you that way a form of religion will lead you that way amen a form of godliness will lead you in the paths of self-righteousness Amen but we're not leading being led in the past of self-righteousness we are being led in the paths of his righteousness can you say amen that's right see so now notice self-righteousness Works apart from the atonement it works apart from the revealed word of God a man see and so we can look at Cain for an example he went through all the forms and the Motions as did Abel but he was self-righteous in what he did ain't that right he wasn't looking to please God he wasn't looking to honor God he was depending upon his own abilities his own way his see he did it he worshiped yes he erected an altar yes he brought forth a substance unto God yes but he done it all without knowing the will of God and offered the work of his own hands to God ain't that right amen even the Pharisee amen had the form of religion and went through all the emotion uh the emotions of religious duty but yet all the while rejecting God's provided way amen so it was an exercise a man of of self-righteousness ain't that right amen now notice Cain offered something that was totally contrary to the will of God and he'd done it without Revelation or understanding but now the Pharisees amen they they actually performed the Commandment of God Amen for what they'd done it was the will of God it was the Commandment of God offering a lamb they offered the lamb amen having a breeze an altar they had one amen they've done it all they were working amen exactly the way God commanded it amen but they'd done it without Revelation amen they've done it they didn't have any understanding as to what they were doing and and so Jesus when he come he said you've made the Commandment of God of no effect by your Traditions it become a tradition to them the house of God became a tradition into them worship became a tradition to them offering up a sacrifice became a tradition to them amen they didn't honor God by it it was just a tradition because they didn't do it with the Revelation or understanding they offered a lamb they had their altars they had their priests they had their amen every ritual amen but they couldn't look Beyond The Natural Things amen and to see the substance of what those things spoke of can you say amen amen that's right so when the true lamb came on the scene they despised him when the true high priest stood in their in their midst and they rejected him amen when when the God who they claimed the worship came in a human body and then spoke to them amen They Crucified him because everything they'd done even though they were obeying the Commandments of God they did it without revelation ain't that right yes sir see they knew the Bible they knew the scriptures by intellectual knowledge but they didn't have the revelation of what it all meant so they only had a form of religion a form ain't that right and how many people go to church today and don't even understand why they're going amen why they don't understand why it's important to amen a preacher Amen to hear the preacher they don't understand amen oh yeah God sent a prophet but they don't understand why God sent a prophet they don't even understand it and it's becoming a ritual to them it's becoming a tradition to them God doesn't want Church to be a tradition God doesn't want your worship to be a tradition God doesn't want your praise to be a tradition God doesn't want your a man's to be a tradition God wants it to be a living reality to you and you can only do that through a revelation it's great and you say man that's right see now if you notice see they only had a form of religion but all the Old Testament Saints understood that the lamb the high priest the altar the Tabernacle had a deeper meaning than just the natural so they were able to look beyond that natural lamb and see a true lamb and by faith they believed in that lamb can you say Amen not not the letter lamb the true Lamb by faith amen they were looking at a night or they they were able to look beyond the natural Tabernacle and by faith they could see a true Tabernacle and they were able to look Beyond and and believe in the true Tabernacle they were able to look past the natural priest and see a true high priest oh Church it wasn't a form of religion to them this was something that captivated him and when they were doing it as they offered that lamb they were fulfilling the righteousness amen that was revealed to them that's right it was revealed Hebrews 11 and 13 says these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them oh my to think of that as they slaughtered that natural lamb amen them Old Testament Saints they weren't dependent on the lamb because that natural lamb couldn't get them out of the grief but they sold something far off and brother or Paul says it was a promise to them afar off they seen it as a promise can you say amen and they died being persuaded of the promise and not embracing the natural but they embraced the spiritual they embraced the true ain't that right they embraced the substance of what the natural had had the type had spoke of and so they were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth to think of what Moses hid he had built the Tabernacle and the Wilderness according to what he saw in the heavens amen he perfectly built the Tabernacle on Earth as what he saw in the heavens Amen to think of that as he went to the Natural Tabernacle he knew that there was a Heavenly Tabernacle amen and he has embraced it he was persuaded of it because he had saw it amen hallelujah it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness but those that did not have a revelation of of what that lamb spoke of they just held to the Natural those that had didn't have the revelation of what all these forms were and all these these these these Works were they just held to it as rituals it became ritual and then when the lamb true lamb come that the natural sacrifice spoke of they they crucified him can you say amen and so is it doing that today in this age hallelujah hallelujah but do you realize that every Old Testament saying or the New Testament Saints before us they saw our day I just believe they saw it Paul spoke of it amen and those people embraced it amen but as they saw it and they were in break you are in the land of promise Amen to take hold of it and make it a reality for you you're not looking afar off you're standing right there and every promise is opened up into your hands now hey man they were able to see they saw them afar off God had led them by his eye and so is it in this age he said I'll guide thee with mine can you say Amen they died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them but then to the others the Commandments of God had become a Creed and a Dogma a man see and and what is a Creed amen we've read it before but a Creed is a statement of the basic beliefs of a religious Faith a set of guiding principles or beliefs a man's seat so that that's what they had made the Commandments of God nothing but just to Creed every denomination has a Creed whether it be and and all of them is is based upon their own ideas a group of men one man or whatever amen uh uh and they've developed this and now if you if you're a Baptist if you're a Jehovah's Witness or if you're a Mormon or if you're if you're whatever then then you have to come under this this this Creed this set of rules this set of belief amen and it doesn't matter if you've been born again it doesn't matter you just automate exactly become a Baptist you just automatically become an Assemblies of God you just automatically become whatever amen because you now come under amen that set of of rules that that set of of beliefs can you say man a Dogma is something considered as an established opinion A belief or body of beliefs concerning Faith or morals laid down by a church so everyone now you just think of that a form of godliness a form of religion how many millions of people just have a form of religion amen but yet they're only abiding by a form of a belief a belief that has been conjured up not from the word of God but of man and you say Amen and and all it is is a self-righteousness it it it's promoting self-righteousness but we'll never be able to stand before God depending on our own righteousness hope it's all right Ezekiel 33 12 therefore thou son of man say unto the children of thy people the righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver them deliver him in the day of his transgression say that again the righteous of the righteous he shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression for as the wickedness of the wicked he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sent us so no matter how much you go to church and how much righteous you are amen by your set of beliefs and your set of rules in your well I don't care it could be you you John if you want strict rules join the Muslims they got better rules they got stricter rules than what we would ever think of Amen if you really want to live by set of rules and strictness then you go go to there amen but yet in the day of your transgression not one of them things amen will be able to save you can you say man for it's not all about all of that that is just a form of religion he says when I when I shall say to the righteous that he shall surely live if he trusts to his own righteousness and commit iniquity all is righteousness all everybody say all is righteousness shall not be remembered well out of all the righteousness that he he has within himself in the day of his iniquity shall not be remembered amen that he hath committed see but but for see uh shall not be remembered but for his iniquity that he committed and he shall die for it ain't that right so there is no appeal Before the Throne of God that we can make of our own righteousness ain't that right amen so again leading Us in the paths of righteousness don't you think it's your righteousness that's that's doing this he's not leading Us in the paths of our own righteousness he's he is righteous Isaiah 64 and 6 we are all as un as an unclean thing and all our righteousness are as filthy rags and we all do fate as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away now if you look at the law of Moses it brought about a self-righteousness and the law came about because the people wanted something that they could do themselves so they tried to be holy without the power of Holiness a man they tried to Love Without The Power of Love they tried to be reconciled to God without the power of reconciliation uh or without the atonement amen they tried to to serve god without the power of of Revelation ain't that right amen and and and that's what it was but then after Jesus come and and and noticed after he had died he had resurrected now he talks to the church acts 1 and 8 but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you ain't that right and what is the Holy Ghost we've we've talked about it he is the spirit of Truth which will lead and guide you into all truth so what is the one that's leading us into the paths of righteousness it's the holy ghost that is leading Us in the paths of righteousness the path of Truth the paths of the word of God Amen brother Brown said he will teach us he will guide us in other words he will reveal all righteousness to us isn't that wonderful he will reveal all righteousness to us John 6 45 it is written in the in the prophets and they shall all be taught of God all shall be but who is that all Isaiah 54 13 explains it and all thy children shall be taught of the Lord see so the all of God are the children of God brother Brown said so the evidence of being a true child of God he whom the spirit has come upon and indwells is again set forth as one taught the word by the Holy Ghost can you say Amen he's the one that leads or teaches or Reveals All the paths of righteousness to us so this is not a form of religion we're not part of a form of religion taking our own ideas or taken this and taking that amen but we are as as Paul would say he that hath hath anointed us is the Holy Ghost we have an unction amen and that is the Holy Ghost ain't that right amen see so again the people uh have this form of godliness while denying amen the power of Revelation now that's what the prophet said you know now Peter I think it was Peter and Paul amen said that they would have a form of godliness denying the power thereof from such turn away amen and the prophet says it was the power of Revelation that they would deny in other words they would not allow him to lead them they were built upon their own self-righteous they would take a Creed they had rather take a Dogma they'd take their own opinion of it instead of the Holy Ghost leading them can you say amen that's right see and so today people are just as Israel did they want something they can do themselves a man joins a church and by that he considers himself a Christian a man puts his name on the roll and by that he deems himself a Christian he pays his tithes and offerings and by that he thinks himself the Christian he he prays three times a day and by that he he he's ready for heaven all right then you look at the woman she wears a long hair and deems herself a Christian she doesn't wear the Rings she places you know or Pierce her ears like the other women do so she considerselves a Christian she doesn't wear the pants and the britches and the shorts like everyone else does so she considers herself a Christian but do you realize you can do sir God's service without it being his will and you say man and that's exactly what David did he should have consulted the prophet of God first before he acted I imagine can you say Amen now you know the prophet says it and if you've read it at all that women was sometimes Satan can jump on a spirit can jump on a woman where she get long hair and gets prideful about it God didn't tell us to tell you women sisters to wear your long hair so I can get proud about it and think you're better than somebody else it's fulfilling all righteousness amen and how many people do it without a revelation of what they're doing can you say amen that's exactly right God doesn't want you doing things without revelation it's true see it becomes a form amen just just a form of godliness a man see and so people are doing the exact same thing that David did God sent us a prophet and the people have bypassed it doing their own thing don't tell me that we're the only Holiness group there is there's apostolics that got more more uh uh convictions at what we would have amen don't believe in the Beards don't believe in certain colors don't believe in long or short sleeves don't believe in sideburns don't believe this and don't believe that amen they've got all kinds of ideas and yet through it all they've never consulted a prophet about it and we've got people in the message doing the same thing they tell us wearing a necklace is wrong you can't do this and you can't do that and you can't they're trying to strip you everything without consulting a profit but you go listen to a prophet he tells you how to wear a necklace he tells you how to conduct yourself can you say amen he knows what to do people say well you can't listen to what he does in his family life I beg to differ with you I ain't gonna listen to you I'd rather listen to what he did I'd rather look at how he led his family he led his family and the angel of the Lord must have been pleased with it because the angel of the Lord came to him can you say Amen that's exactly right it's not about form of religion it's about a revelation and the Revelation comes through a prophet and you say Amen see they want to do their own religious thing they got these legalist spirits on them coming into the message then they got these these disgraceful spirits that coming in the message they'll either make a disgrace out of Grace or they'll make it or where there ain't no Grace at all to where they're the ones that's dictating the people yeah can you say Amen that it's not matter how holy you are because you could have a Holiness and to be a self-righteousness but we have come to fulfill all righteousness every promise in This Book Is Ours they bypass the prophet and go after serving God on their own opinion or some other man's opinion but I'll tell you what I'll take a prophet's opinion over your opinion any day can you say Amen but what they're doing they're fulfilling the prophecy for this day blind wretched miserable naked and don't know it that's the problem they don't know it they've got a form of religion oh yeah they cannot they can out pray they can out uh uh look at they can out they can outperform any day amen but they're blind or wretched miserable and they don't know it because they do it without a revelation oh that's all right brother Brown said even their mental faculties are gone they're spiritual faculties of mental spiritual understanding he says the holy spirit is to lead you into all truth and I was just listening to him today and we talked about it before about the the the way there there's a highway and brother Brown says and most ministers say about that Highway the highway we're walking the highway he submit brother It also says there's a way and that way is in the middle of the highway and that's where Holiness is that's where the bride is standing that washes all the trash off over on this side and that side she's staying right in the middle of the road foreign can you say Amen see the holy spirit is to lead you into all truth reveal these things to you he leadeth Us in the paths of righteousness hmm Hallelujah and he says and the modern Church hates that he said the people of today is choosing a modern denomination and it only reflects their poor understanding of the word that just blows my mind that people come in the message and and and and and they will choose a man to bring in Pentecostal age ideas they'll bring in Charles Stanley ideas [Music] hello they'll bring in uh uh the spurgeon's ideas they'll bring in Moody's ideas they'll bring it all in and mix it all up you understand what I'm saying amen see so they're choosing I I just believe that if God sent a prophet to restore the word that's all we need are you with me now that's all we need he can tell you how to live he can tell you how to walk he can tell you how to talk he can tell you how to conduct your family your home your church your marriage your children he can do it all amen it's the truth he's leading Us in the paths of righteousness really Brown said instead of Spirit-filled men in the church who were led by a spirit-given revelation foreign there are now Creeds and bylaws and the educated guesses of educated men he knows how to put it don't he learning has taken the place of Revelation reason has replaced faith program has replaced spontaneous praise in the Holy Ghost but notice brother Brown describes the Church of the Living God he said my heart's desire is to meet the church which he has died foreclosed in the righteousness of his own blood dressed in his word and the righteousness of his word for his word cannot fail can you say man that's exactly what he's saying the church is going to be it's going to be a church that will not be clothed in a Dogma it won't be clothed in whatever amen as Adam did he took his own self he took on self-righteousness right he presented himself in the clothes that he had designed that he had made himself and God rejected it amen and in the presence of God he had to hide amen because the wrath of God the only thing that saved Adam was God provided a blood and not only a blood and got covering you understand that the lamb bled for Adam but then God took the skin of that lamb and dressed Adam and it's the bloody bleeding word that bled it's the word that bled for you amen and now God has taken his word and dressing you brother Brown said I hope he will Crown my Ministry of this of letting me take the clothes of the word and dress his bride in the clothe of the word and for his righteousness do you believe that's brother branham's Ministry I just believe that is amen that God you would take that Prophet amen and put the desire in there because that's exactly what his purpose was to do amen a church that would be found naked miserable blind and naked but then there would be his church God's church amen that would be found clothed in the righteousness of his word amen because God would have a bride or a Prophet come with the word of God and dress her you see she's not just observing of promises she's working righteousness fulfilling righteousness that's okay but notice what Paul said in Romans 10 4 breaking in Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth so no longer by the law do we live for righteousness do we become righteous do we seek to be righteous Christ is the end of that he is our righteousness can you say Amen he is our righteousness and he has come in this day his blood is the voice that is speaking upon our behalf and he's clotheing Us in the righteousness of his word so the only way that a man could be righteous is by believing Christ and he is the word now notice Romans 3 and 21 but now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe aren't you glad for that we've read the scripture many times you've read it but where Paul says if any man be in Christ he is a new creature or a new creation old things are passed away and behold all things are become new ain't that right being in Christ and by only only by one Spirit can you be baptized into the body of Christ and it's not a water baptism it's a spirit baptism that's right see amen see so now look at this as we get ready to close first John 2 29 if you know that he is righteous you know that everyone that doeth or fulfilleth righteousness is born of him not born of the church but born of him if you know that he is righteous how many believes he's righteous then you know that everyone that doeth righteousness not has the form of godliness not having a self-righteousness but he that doeth righteousness is born of him begotten ain't that right amen see so for a person to fulfill righteousness shows that he is born of God First John 3 and 10 it says whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God again many forms of religion a form of godliness producing self-righteousness and yet that doesn't count to God whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God ain't that right so we read the scripture I read it again and he that doeth or fulfilleth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous now Hebrews 11 4 it says by faith everybody say by faith Abel offered notice he's he's doing something he's in action Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous I think that's awesome that's a powerful scripture right there he offered by faith he offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice and came by which he obtained witness that he was righteous now brother Brad I'm in speaking of Abel and Cain said both of them religious both of them anointed both of them Desiring life and both worshiping the same God but Abel did something that was different than Cain did he fulfilled everybody say he fulfilled the will of God he fulfilled the will of God in other words he fulfilled the righteousness for his day and he couldn't have done that brother Brown said he couldn't have done that if it hadn't been revealed to him right but by faith he offered a more excellent sacrifice than did Cain which showed that what he did was revealed to him he did it by faith it wasn't just a form of religion he did it by faith which showed that what he did was revealed to him it wasn't his own thinking ain't that right brother Brown said see Cain and Abel Come To Worship but Cain come before the Lord in class Style but Abel came in righteousness by revelation you see when you come to church you're coming to God in righteousness by revelation and we're that group of people that the book has been open to we're in this land of of of open book all the promises are being made known to us we're not just sitting twiddling our thumbs and guessing and probing that that that's all over with we are now in the land of an open book and the promises the veil has been torn to where we can now clearly see you notice the paths of righteousness is the path of the just proverbs 4 18 the path of the justice as The Shining Light that shineth more and more into the perfect day the path of the just is as a Shining Light now remember I believe it's the psalmist said Thy word is the light my my light right so the word is the light that path is the light the others that walk in the other path we talked about it they're walking in the path of darkness and they stumble and they know not what at what ain't that right so the path he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness to just walking in the path of light and that light is shining more and brighter and brighter it's uh uh I I don't know is is it the song This is the evening time where it talks about the light has never been shining like it has been in this day I can't remember what song that is but we sing it the path of the just but notice it is written the just everybody say the just shall live by faith the just shall live by faith Abel offered by faith the just shall worship by faith can you say Amen the just shall amen by faith the just shall worship by faith amen the just shall come to church by faith the just shall read every Promise by faith but just shall claim the Promises by faith you understand what I'm saying that just shall live by faith any promise that you have is by faith you ain't gonna get it any other way you'll get your healing by faith you'll get your deliverance by faith every promise comes to you by faith ain't that right so by faith Abel offered a more excellent Sacrifice by faith know what built an art by faith Abraham left his own land his kin and looked for a city whose Builder and maker was God they've done it all by faith and notice what the prophet said faith is a revelation of the will of God favor so the just shall live by faith oh I hope it making sense to you the judge shall live by faith not form of religion sisters your Holiness is not a form of religion to you you're doing it by faith because it's revealed to you our worship is not just a form of religion to us we're doing it by faith for we realize it's been revealed the will of God has been revealed to us people say oh they're dancing they just get emotional now I don't understand there's people that do that then that's a form of religion but you forget that there is a scripture speaking of our day that when the lamb came and opened the book they were screaming there was shouting Prophet said John must have gotten to side himself did he not why something was revealed to him his name and he represented the bride of Christ for this day our worship is not a form of religion it's not a form of godliness it's a revelation to us so they fulfilled righteousness by fulfilling the revealed word for their age what had been revealed to them they fulfilled it therefore they fulfilled all righteousness for their age amen and Abel showed he was righteous by fulfilling righteousness and we are righteous through Jesus Christ and to show that we are righteous we are fulfilling all righteousness that are spoke of this age I hope ain't born you appreciate your pull I'm going to close but I want to get down to you we are to fulfill everybody say we are to fulfill the revealed word for our age don't don't don't don't bypass that profit because you won't know what the revealed word is don't don't look at anything else cause they can't lead you in the paths of righteousness can you say amen amen better prophet's message has opened up the land to us and we can now know what is expected of us and what every promise it ain't about rules of do's and don'ts it's about the quickening power of God coming upon the church now notice we fulfilled the revealed word for our age brother Brown said the beginning of righteousness is God's revealed truth see it's not forms of religion it's not forms of godliness it's the power of Revelation that has brought the righteousness to us righteousness at the beginning of righteousness is God's revealed truth and the entire Church of the Living God is built upon that not Creeds not dogmas not whatever else Jesus said blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness they shall be filled brother Brown says it this way he just knows how to put it blessed are they that are Hunger and thirsting to know righteousness and they shall be filled are you hungering to know you're thirsting to know and your food and drink comes from the revealed word of God that's how you you're hungering to know you're thirsting to know how is that thirst and hunger quenched the word of God so he leads me in the paths of his word Paths of righteousness the Apostle Paul called it the word of righteousness and that word was ordained before the foundation of the world Isaiah 46 9 remember the former things of old for I am God and there is none else I am God and there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the uh the things that are not yet done oh my so this Bible is the plan of God it's the purpose of God written out in in letter form ain't that right but notice Jesus being the Living Word of God for he was the word made flesh he knew what was written of him to do ain't that right so the prophet said every word that was wrote of that Messiah was fulfilled to the letter now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament why she is the word Bride of the word groom that's right in these six thousand years after the fall God has only made two masterpieces and that's Christ the bridegroom and today he's come to the finale of his second Masterpiece which is the bride the church the bride of Christ you see the first Masterpiece was finished when the fullness of God dwelt bodily in Christ and today the second Masterpiece is completed for the same God that was in Christ is now in fullness in his church right now brother Brown said now if he was the Messiah by being in the anointed one for that day to fulfill the word of God to be the Redeemer and the anointed one and God raised up that body his bride is Anointed is the anointed one for this day it's already raised with him in the resurrection because these two are one speaking of this adoption he says the powers that was in Christ has been given to his church all that God was he poured into Christ and Christ was God manifested on Earth and all that Christ was he poured into his church and all the powers that God had rested in Christ and the fullness of Christ now rests in his church so he says the last thing that the church is going to see is Christ manifested in his power in fullness in his church just before the fire falls and church were here we're here the word has prophesied of these organizations that we have today and the curses upon them but the prophet said the word has also prophesied of the things that would take place by his truly anointed Church why for the church is a word bride and she will have the word and brother Brian said here we are aren't you glad for that as the musicians come can you lift your hands and just Worship the Lord isn't the Lord just wonderful here we are we're here at church these Paths of righteousness that we're walking in it's the promises of God that was late dormant for years and years and now here you are not just observing but you're right in the middle of the land Hallelujah the power is in you the authority is in you everything that Christ was is in this church here we are and brother Brown said those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the Lord if they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works for feeling his own word he did not complete all his work while he was while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he now will fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time all do you love him I'm so glad that it's just not a form of religion to us Hallelujah it's the spirit of God that's leading us into the paths of his word amen what song there's never been a day like this day to me there's never been a day like this day [Music] that shine so bright as this day this Glory yesterday all sing it now there's never been a day like this day there's never been a day like this day I see there's never been alive to shine so bright as this day [Music] oh sing it again there's ever been a day like this day to me there's never been a day like this day I see there's never been a light hold the shine surprise as this day this Glory as they just play Softly I couldn't help but as we me and Ruth was coming to service tonight we didn't see the Sun but we saw just the beauty that it reflected through the clouds the color is just just just beautiful that sounds that you know sweetheart that the sun is just nothing but a ball of Fire stuff fire but it lights everything up and I don't know just
