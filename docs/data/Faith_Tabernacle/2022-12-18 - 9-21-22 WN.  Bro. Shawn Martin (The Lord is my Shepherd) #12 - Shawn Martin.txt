========================================

and enjoyed the songs that were sung and the worship and appreciate our musicians amen and their labor amen and good to have brother Berkeley with us amen and uh God bless you I didn't even know you could sing amen you got a good voice praise the Lord and enjoyed that and amen and again it's a good to have Suzanne with us my mother-in-law and we've really enjoyed and having her with us and been able to fellowship with her and so she'll be heading home Friday morning the Lord willing and so we want to keep her in prayer that she have a safe flight back home and and that the Lord is good to us if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to Psalms the 23rd chapter amen read a few verses there amen I trust everyone had a good day today in the Lord and but before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to our Lord father we truly thank you for all that you've done for us and we can never thank you enough Lord and just to be able to come to your house and to worship you to magnify you Lord and to Lord just to wash ourselves with your word father for the prophet said it's the bloody bleeding word Lord and knowing father that As we judge ourselves here by your word we won't stand on that day of judgment Lord without any blood without any Mercy father and help us all Lord just to draw closer to you for that's our desire Lord and as you draw us Lord may we respond promptly Lord and I pray Lord that you would move among us this evening anoint me Lord I I need you father it's your gift it's it has nothing to do with me Lord and may we just come into a higher place with you father and anoint your people Lord to hear to receive is our prayer Lord that when we leave this place we had known that it did we had met with you we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen Psalms 23 um first verse the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want. he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul amen you can have your seeds this evening we've been talking uh for a little bit now on this The Lord Is Our Shepherd and so this evening I want to continue dealing with it um the third verse he restoreth my soul but last last Wednesday we talked on restoring but tonight I want to just talk about the soul and um you know there are three stages of everything and and most of us we know these things and it's good to have Sister Lisa brother Andrew's Mom with us praise the Lord and um but it's uh um they're they're this it may be a simple subject to to many but yet I I think it's good just to go over these things and and to talk about them but there are three stages of everything as the prophet would tell us for such there's the the the the Mortal body then there is the theophany body and then there's the glorified body then we look at even in the coming of Christ is is in a trinity brother Branham says you know first he came to redeem his bride second he comes to receive his bride and then third he comes with his bride to reign as king and queen in the millennium and so brother Branham tells us that that three is perfection that God is perfected in three um father son and and Holy Ghost and man is also perfected in three uh and that is uh Body Spirit and soul so we are a a Triune being and so brother Branham says you live in a three-room house Body Spirit and soul and so God lived in Christ upon the Earth and Body Spirit and soul and and so God in a Trinity is One and without the Trinity then he's not God ain't that right that's what the prophet said and so none of us can be manifested uh without being a trinity amen you you you can't be a body and be manifested as a as a person uh by just being a body because without any of these three things together then we are uh uh we're not complete so if you if the prophet said if you didn't have a body then you'd just be a spirit and if you didn't have a spirit then you'd be nothing and if you didn't have a soul you'd be nothing so he says see God also is complete in the triunity of a being not triunity of beings but the one being in a triunity father Son and Holy Ghost manifests the one true and living God ain't that right now first Thessalonians 5 23 Paul tells us he says and the Very God of Peace sanctify you holy and I pray God your whole spirit and sow and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ now so our our whole Triune being must be preserved blameless ain't that right and and so but David here is talking about the restoration of the Soul now man uh is a mammal he's a warm-blooded uh animal and so uh and that's what we are by our Earthly creation the body and so when when God made man he made man in his own image and and man being a spirit being but then God formed a body Out of the Dust of the earth ain't that right and he put man in that in that body and that body was made in the image of an animal so God as the prophet would say he gave man a uh uh feat like a bear and he gave him hands like the monkey and and all of these things but when God put the spirit of man in that body then the Bible says that he gave him a soul for God breathed the breath of life and Man became a living Soul ain't that right now there's a lot to this and so I'm going to try to get through it hopefully to make some sense to you but I want to continue on later on but brother Brown said that's the difference between man and and animal the animal is the soul that that's the difference and and so um uh again Genesis 2 7 and the Lord God formed a Man Out of the Dust of the ground formed his body and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living soul and so being that the the animal doesn't have a soul then he doesn't realize that he's naked he doesn't realize what sin is he he he doesn't know sin amen because he is a living being no not a living Soul ain't that right and so also the prophet would tell us that the animal does not know what life is Hereafter amen and he can't know because he doesn't have a soul and he says the reason that we long as humans we long for Life Hereafter it's it's because we've been given a a soul where the animal can't long for it a man and and God gave you a soul to make a decision amen that's that's where the intelligence comes from is the soul and and so the animal cannot make that decision because it has nothing in it to make ain't that right another thing about the soul the prophet says that the soul is the nature of the spirit and and so he says you are what you are are in your soul not in your mind not in your spirit not even in your body but in your soul see not in your mind and not in your reasoning and so brother Branham said you meet God with your soul ain't that right you're going to meet God with your soul and the way that soul is it produced what kind of life you are and if that life in you denies this word then get rid of it and get a life that will stay with that word and and God and make God live in you ain't that right so you you will meet God with your soul and that's important I I believe and and so even though even though that we are a Triune being bodies spirit and soul it's the soul that counts it's the soul that counts now we know that the outside man which is the body it has five senses stays filled hear smell in in sight and and and that is the the this body but then there's that Inside Man which is the spirit man and it's controlled by five senses you've got imagination reasoning uh conscience uh uh memory and and and the other one and and so uh but five senses all together but in on the inside of that Spirit brother Brandon would call it the inside of the inside and he says inside of that spirit is the soul and it is controlled by one thing and that's free will ain't that right so uh uh he he in another place he said the two Spirits he said now one of them there's only two spirits in the earth a man two powers and and so such two influences and and he says one of them is God's Holy Spirit and the other one is the devil Spirit working in deception ain't that right it's working in deception and the people of the Earth are now making their choice right now see and and remember you were given a soul a man to make that choice with to make decisions amen with and and so uh he said now the holy spirit is here today calling out a bride for Christ and he's doing it by vindicating his word now I you know people question and again this this Vindication then and all of this and it just blows my mind you know they're they're seeking Vindication about the cloud that that that was in Tucson and and uh uh one one uh minister is Consulting with Scientists to get a scientific statement a truth or fact from the scientist that this really happened that and I I just if that blows my mind amen because uh here the prophet would tell us that the Holy Spirit here is calling out a bride and he's doing it not by because the scientist agrees with it but he's doing it by vindicating his word a promise to her for this age showing that it is what Christ and brother Branham already told us that that them were seven angels and and in there it was Christ he said that's Christ can you say man and he pointed out the face of Jesus Christ amen but see it's by the Vindication of this word for this day that God is calling out a bride and Satan is working through deception and the people in this age are making their choice now I'll be honest with you as we go here I I don't think you've got too much long to make your choice you better be convinced uh you'll you'll either be convinced or you're not amen look at the politics look at what Russia is doing right now uh uh Russia they you know they they've been reading that Bible and and they've been reading Revelations and and one uh high up uh uh red uh uh scriptures uh concerning America and and they said we're ready to fulfill it we know our place in scripture and and so you know uh they're they're there and and I Know It looks like they got beaten in Ukraine amen but we already know what the prophet already said about Russia and if they're recognizing their place then there's a bride that's recognizing her position in in in in this life amen so playing games it's over we can't play games ain't that right amen so now now we're talking about that soul to to give and to make decisions aware he said you can accept what the devil says or you can accept what God Said What God Says and that'll determine what spirit is in there see if it's the spirit of God it'll feed on the things of God it won't feed on anything of the world can you say man now the soul is important the prophet tells us that that one soul is worth ten thousand worlds now you think of that one Soul Your Soul here tonight amen uh there may be 30 or so of us and and and every one of us has that soul and every soul is worth ten thousand worlds and the prophet said your soul means more than your body now you think of that your soul means more than your body brother Branham actually gave us a price tag on our body and he said it's only worth 84 cents which inflation you know so you might might get up to a dollar fifty or something I don't know but but he's he's showing us how how cheap this whole body really is ain't that right amen and so when it comes to our body we aren't worth much but it's the soul everybody say it's the soul that God is working on it's the soul that matters to God Amen and why is that it's it's because in the Garden of Eden amen God and the devil chose what part of man that they would use and and and remember there's that war that began in heaven a man Satan started a revel uh Revolution or a rebellion uh against God then he was kicked out of heaven and then that battle uh uh continued here on on the earth and and and and and and man becomes the Battleground every one of us is the Battleground and so Satan chose man's head and and uh to use and and and uh uh uh his intellect and and God chose the man's heart the soul ain't that right for the soul doesn't live in your head the soul lives in your heart amen that's right and and so the prophet says the devil you know uh uh uh tries to show man uh with his mental Powers some great thing that he can do amen and so that that's what man uh with his intellect his intellectual Powers uh uh shows him what he can do and man only wants to see with his eyes ain't that right uh what he can see around him but notice the prophet said see God Amen chose man's heart for himself to live in amen God God wants to live in your heart and that's where the soul is he he wants your soul as his domain ain't that right amen see and so man God comes into man's heart and makes him believe for things that he cannot see now you think of that amen and only only God when he comes into that Soul can can man actually see things that he cannot see a man but he sees it by faith ain't that right he sees it by faith and II Corinthians 4 18. Paul would tell us we look knock at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen that that's why we don't go by feelings we don't go by what we see what we you know what we feel what we hear what symptoms we have what it looks like we don't we don't look at the situation we look at the thing that is not seen ain't that right for the things notice the things which are seen are temporal amen now you you we look at the trees that's temporal we look at we look at the the the the houses that's temporal we look at the cars that's temporal but what what about what you see inside of you amen you see yourself as just a nobody that's temporal can you say man you might see yourself as a failure but that's temporal look at the things that are not seen ain't that right amen see so we we uh the things that can be seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are are Eternal ain't that right amen and that settles it so the prophet would tell us say we don't question it amen we just believe it because God said so God said it we believe it without any question ain't that right that's why we do not allow room for questions about this about the the this message and about the cloud and about the the the picture and and the promises that God made ain't that right amen no believer has questions about this message it's the unbeliever that has questions about this message can you say amen amen because the when God gets in your soul it'll make you a Believer it it just automatically does you are a Believer not by your intellect but you are a Believer from your soul ain't that right see so we we find a man that uh uh when when God gets into a man's heart that soul he doesn't have to see anything amen he doesn't have to have the doctor to give him a good report to for him to believe that he's healed he don't have to see anything positive a man for him to actually believe that he's going to walk again or or or or or that that that that the tumor is going to leave or or whatever he just already anchored in his soul ain't that right and so none of the five senses of the body must declare it to be so in order for him to believe it amen brother Branham says he just believes it in his soul where God lives amen see God wants to lead man to the path of worship ain't that right so so the devil took man's head and makes him smart a man to where he figures out his own religion he he um he figures it all out himself and makes his own way of Escape amen and we've read this before but brother Branham says you search the Bible and you show me where God ever dealt with intellectual people hunt for it and see if it isn't always the intellectuals that are devil possessed ain't that right because Satan uses the intellectual mind amen and God uses the soul now it was the soul of man that was marred a man by sin maybe if you were there um uh the day that Adam if you could have been there the day they they sinned amen you wouldn't have seen anything in the outward expression or in that in the body outwardly but but down inside of him that Soul become marred amen seek Blackness and darkness came into it brother Brown said that little cloud in there became marred and and black and and and see before sin came Adam and Eve oh my they they would you know wait just for uh the cool of the evening a man for God to come and fellowship with him and and God was anticipating the fellowship with this children in and oh my I don't know how long it was uh well I was a bit in a bit night after night after night oh they just looked for Fellowship one with another a man and and and these things and brother Brown said see what what it was is their soul was it marred a man so they could have fellowship and and and communion with God and so their soul wasn't marred they could hear the roar see that beautiful light shining through the bushes Yonder now you think of that amen because their soul was in contact with the supernatural their soul was in contact with the Unseen World ain't that right amen and you realize that God would meet with him just like that in the pillar of fire Amen in that Pillar of Fire amen would come roaring and you hear what brother Brandon would say it would be and what was it it was a wind it was a roar amen as that light would come down and settle and Adam and Eve because their soul was admired they could see it amen hang in there and and oh what a fellowship they would have ain't that right amen but see when the soul was marred amen it changed everything from man he he fell from his estate he he lost that consciousness of a supernatural Unseen World and he just lost consciousness of God and and what he was made for and and and before you know it he was trying his own religion he was trying his own way God would try to show up and he would take off running and hiding amen man's all the time hiding from the presence of the Lord amen see and so it's the soul that has to be changed back it it's the soul that has to be trans formed can you say amen and and I'll tell you this if the soul has no change there will be no body change can you say Amen just as much as the world today they they can't see much of a change in us today amen uh on the outward expression amen but what they can't see is there's a soul that's been transformed it's been changed back can you say Amen but but if the soul ain't changed there ain't going to be a change of a body the soul must be restored ain't that right now we put all of our time in making this body look good all right and and handsome men and Purdy and we put the best of clothes on we put you know the the we we we get the best of foods and put it down our body you know and and we we we we pet this old flesh and pet this old body and people will put two hundred dollar three hundred dollar hat on their head and and uh it's a uh you know and and the prophet says they might be clean uh through taking baths every four hours they they might be Paula Scholars and and all that on the outside and yet be as filthy and dirty as the smutty walls in hell in their soul can you say man amen so we're not looking a man took this whole body now you know uh I like good old steaks and I like all these things and and and uh uh we you know I'm I'm guilty just as much as petting this whole body amen but but this the soul that counts can you say Amen it's the soul people gauge your Christianity on whether you're poor whether you're rich or whether this or whether that and they disregard the soul of man now you know uh people will drag uh anything their soul through anything amen these days uh the prophet said the church has pulled their soul through too many old love story magazines instead of the word of God Amen he said people can tell you more about what movie star is popular then they can about the moving of the Holy Spirit they can tell you more about the news Amen in the politics more than they can the Holy Spirit they got more experience out amen with the world than they do the Holy Spirit can you say Amen uh uh and brother Brandon would say now if we would put more time to stay on Tuesday night and Wednesday night and going to church to prayer meeting instead of staying home and watching television on who loves Lucy or something like that and staying away from church we didn't know more about our Bible and what we're supposed to have in this day can you say Amen so so seed them things doesn't help your soul at all you're dragging your soul amen through the smuts of hell and and all of these things but yet we'll we make sure our bodies all petted you know we we tired and and so we want to go to bed early and and and make sure nobody you know does this there's no you know we we want everything just perfect everything's got to be just right amen but then that Soul amen we'll drag it through anything we don't care amen now brother Branham was talking to the uh uh uh the nominal church amen uh but but we're finding more and more is creeping in the message trains because of the mixed multitude that has followed and we we know what brother Branham says for every Supernatural display manifestation there's always a mixed multitude that follows it's the mixed multitude that causes the division is the mixed multitude that disbelieves the word of God is the mixed multitude a man that can't do that just can't accept every word that God has written in this Bible it's always the mixed multitude ain't that right and then he goes and continues on but we've got away God has given us churches and find pastors and Spirit-filled people amen that we're so grossed in our soul and fattened and fed till we just don't care for it anymore can you say Amen we just don't care for it amen now I thought of this because brother Branham at the end of a service and he was he was given an altar caller asking people to raise their hands and if they needed the Lord and and the 12 year old a child raised his hand to accept Christ in his heart and brother Brown said God bless you sonny he said the Bible says a child shall lead them and see and he tells the people see he hasn't pulled his little soul through old true story magazines and things and and what's called true stories he said there's only one true story that I know and that's the Bible can you say amen he said little kids today know more about Davy Crockett they do about Jesus Christ and every 10 cent store has all kinds of cowboy stuff and he says and there's what the Little Children of America swallow up ain't that right but there was a little child a little boy a man that could raise his hands to accept Christ and the prophet would attribute it because his soul hadn't been drugged through all the nonsense can you say amen and and I I tell you Satan's got all kinds of enticing things in this day to drag your soul in amen that that's right to drag your soul through and and and and to be honest it makes a difference amen it makes a difference amen because people are becoming more indifferent to the word of God and to his word it makes them more calloused and irreverent to God I've never seen a generation so we're reverent to the things of God to the men of God Amen to the people of God that they'll they'll uh they'll smart they'll they'll act all kinds of ways and it doesn't even concern them we've had them walk in uh uh with mud in on their boots and when the deacons asked them not to do it they don't care amen it's just a it's a hardness it's a it's an irreverent Spirit you understand what I'm saying it makes it harder for God to reach them it makes it more harder for them to come into to relationship with God it makes it harder for them to pray it makes it harder for people to be attentive to the word of God as it's being preached and it's because they dragged their soul through all kinds of ungodliness and and all kinds of feel of the world even the prophet said they dragged their soul through religious junk can you say Amen you're all that religious doctrines and and man-made traditions and see they're dragging their soul through it amen to where America you can't even reach America anymore you can't reach people to Christ anymore because their soul has been drugged through so much brother Brown said take care of that soul and let that 84 cents go amen all right watch that soul for her to live forever your soul is more valuable than your wealth it's more valuable than the materialistic things that we hoard Mark 8 36 for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ain't that right so what you are in your soul is what you will be when you leave here so I I hope I'm helping you amen I hope we're making some sense a little bit [Applause] all your money that you hoard up it's going to be at the bank when you die and all this materialistic things that you think you've got to have to enjoy life is going to just be a waste when you die but the thing that you disregard and most American laodicea is is pushing aside is the very Soul that's going to have to meet God one of these days ain't that right amen now the prophet says God is interested in the soul of man Leviticus 17 11 for the life of the flesh is in the blood then I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your soul for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul yeah ain't that right Matthew 11 28 come unto me Jesus says all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest amen see I will give you rest everybody's so tired these days and and all that you know what I I really think it's because it's the spirit world that is Laden on the people amen they know judgments coming and people ain't ready for it you understand what I'm saying and they get weary they get wither weary of the oppression they get weary of of all these things that and and and and and and here Jesus is saying to learn of me take my yoke upon you and for I am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest for what your soul amen you can sleep 24 hours a day amen but what you really need is rest for your soul can you say amen amen that that's what people need the world needs is rest unto their soul now Jesus here he was after that soul and and he was the expression of God's love ain't that right amen and and so if he's that expression then you you know that in his heart it was for souls in his heart he was burdened I got to get a soul I I you of course he said I'm at my father's business ain't that right so of course Souls was his business amen and and so we we looked amen uh uh where in the Bible that he got into a little ship and and he was crossing the sea and and and the winds picked up and you know you know who started them wins it was old Satan himself Satan knew why Satan knew what was happening but Jesus endured it Jesus wouldn't go back amen he just kept on pressing and pressing and and and and for of course we we know that he he spoke to the winds and this and the waves and all of that peace be still but he was willing to go to the other side because of one Soul was calling him can you say Amen One Soul was calling for him amen and the prophet said he had to go so to save that one's soul to heal one person and brother Brown said he would come from glory to Shreveport amen he would come to Blacksburg tonight from glory for one so can you say man that was ready to receive him sometimes we think it's God that we're waiting on God that's a lie don't let the devil lie to you amen every time a man a real true repented heart comes through that altar God is already there before he gets to that altar you understand what I'm saying we ain't waiting God to feel people with the Holy Ghost God's wanting to fill you with the Holy Ghost before the foundation of the world brother says I preached to hundreds of thousands I preached at just four or five people but I wouldn't be any more sincere with 500 000 than I would be with five people because one soul is valued to God as ten thousand worlds ain't that right and he said wherever the Lord sins the church never gets too little whatever it is it doesn't get too little right amen but whatever wherever there's a needy Soul he says I want to lead it if it's just one soul to the Lord Jesus and you may not be the preacher of of of Omega Church you may not be a a well-known individual but one Soul One Soul matters to God one soul that soul may be on your job that means that's cool that soul may be a uh uh at your school that soul may be at the at the grocery store that soul may be at the at the barber shop wherever it is one soul God's interested in Souls don't forget it I remember reading the story of Smith Wigglesworth his biography and he was at someone's house he was ministering in that in the town I believe and so he was staying at an individuals home families home but one morning woke up and felt like the Lord wanted him to walk to town so he walked and he kept walking and and he felt led to stop and there was a bench so he sat on that bench and it was by the busty Pole or or yeah I think it was that they're trained or whatever and but he waited there waited there for hours maybe four hours and he thought well maybe I've missed the Lord and it's getting ready to leave but he just felt something certain that that God wanted him to witness to somebody [Music] and as he looked there's an individual got off that train and the Lord led him to that individual and Smith Wigglesworth went over there and introduced himself to that individual and began to talk to him about the Lord and let that soul to the Lord [Music] and you say Amen you hear that many times of brother Branham you hear it of even Jesus where Jesus went out of his way to Samaria I don't know how many hours he had to wait but maybe he waited a little while maybe there were other women that came but he knew there was one soul that was crying out for help One Soul and here this woman was a harlot but it never decreased the value of her soul can you say Amen the prophet tells us that salvation is much greater salvation of the soul is much greater than the healing of the body ain't that right a man can be healed in his physical body only for a limited time but when God Saves the soul it's for eternity ain't that right so we could go on about value of a soul you know the the value I thought of the money now money our money is just going up and down up and down and it's you know it's it's really just decreasing in value you look at your vehicles you look at the houses that you buy and and they lose its value if there's only one thing that doesn't lose value and that's a soul can you say man and I pray to God that we can get so burdened for Souls hello get so burdened for Souls Amen brother Brandon says one soul is is saved is worth it whether it is a little black boy in Africa or a prostitute in New York in eternity when that star is shining Yonder our name will be attached to it can you say man that's where the value is is in the soul it isn't how much you got or how much you desire it's how much you can do towards saving souls for Christ ain't that right he said if I get a soul safe for Christ brother as long as there's an eternity the glory of God will rest on that Soul amen that's right see so so they ought to see it is put into everything before that should not be hey they're putting value on things that are corrupt amen where God wants us to put the value and I believe if the spirit of God is within us amen it will put the value where it belongs can you say man and that's on Souls you hear Brother Brad I'm talking about you know uh uh souls in prison and at the end he said Is it true yeah it can it be so that that that that that we're at that time where where where that no more can be saved and he said well if it is what about Sarah what about my children what about that but did you know as he's asking him questions he ain't planning on stopping his campaigns he ain't planning on stopping preaching he ain't planning on stopping everything amen saying well I feel in my soul that this may be it no no no he kept on pressing the battle he kept on preaching he kept on singing and he kept on doing what he needed to do for one Soul can you say amen and I don't know where we're at it well you know we we may be at the place that you can't get another soul in that God has never showed me that God has never showed you back don't you let some mind amen convert you into that amen get after a soul and witness amen God's placed you on the job for some reason God's placed you somewhere for some reason whether it's in the school whether it's in a hospital whether it's in I don't know where you where we're at but God places his people there for a soul brother Brown said remember Eternal things is what is what lasts forever and that's getting so saved let that be the first thing of all your work all your ideas and all your motives hello he said I'd rather have one soul and Glory that I won to Christ and to know and see that the light of God circles around that Soul through all eternity my name to be associated with that than to have every penny of money in the whole world because I could lose all of it and you know good and well there's been millionaires billionaires amen that is reveled in in all their money in the lottery and they've been broken amen within one night's time amen and and they despair they don't know what to do amen they lost it oh man brother Brown said it used to be that if someone come to the altar give their heart to the Lord or to rededicate their life the whole church will come together around that soul and pray him through he said it's because they were thankful to God that a soul had come they said you don't see that anymore he said because we've lost all the Zeal that we've ever had can you say Amen now I'm going to continue on for a few more moments but brother Branham says the soul controls the spirit and the spirit controls the body and the soul is the nature of the spirit can you say Amen so he said you take two brothers for example you know one of them be John Doe and the other is Jack Doe we'll say and and and their their brothers John is a body Spirit Soul Jack is a body spirit and soul but John you know he's just mean he's evil he's he has everything about him is is just evil and and so he cheats steals lies commits adultery and and does just any evil thing that he can do amen but but Jack doe is is full of Joys full of love he's full of Happiness he's full of peace and and all these things and yet both of them have a body Soul and Spirit both of them are that way ain't that right and and and so what is the difference between the two well brother Brown says see the the nature that John has is evil and the nature that that Jack would have is is good can you say Amen talking about the soul ain't that right amen and and so God must get into the soul I want you to get this for a moment now and as as we get ready to close but God gets into the soul Matthew 5 4 5 45 Jesus said he maketh his Reign or his son to rise talking of God to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth Reign on the just and on the unjust ain't that right now brother Branham would teach us that a man's spirit is between the soul and the body a man and can be absolutely truly Anointed with the Holy Ghost brother Rand says they can anoint this Spirit to make the outside body come into subjection to the spirit ain't that right now remember it's the spirit that controls the body the soul controls the spirit the spirit controls the body see he says but the soul that rejects in unbelief the word of God shall die now you think of that a a man that is dancing Anointed with the spirit of God true spirit of God in his spirit amen that is religious amen and even his body is is is has the outward appearance of religion yeah and and his spirit is Anointed in and having a good feeling and dancing and shouting and just having a good time and yet he says that outside Spirit can be Anointed with the Holy Ghost and the Soul be as dark as pitch and you say Amen now listen now because I I want you to understand He restored my soul David David's not talking about a lot of these Pentecostals that is Anointed in his spirit having good thoughts a good time in church and yet that Soul on the outside when they get outside of churches is smutty and black and controlling that Spirit around you know brother rounds that sin is hypocrisy hypocritical right now I think of this Rich Young Ruler who was very religious brother Ram said his church his intelligence his education and all had led him to a success and all the Jews loved him he gave him gave to them he helped them he might have done this that or the other but see he came face to face with the Vindicated word of the hour ain't that right and he had the opportunity to follow Jesus he had the opportunity to gain eternal life amen but he went his own way refusing the leadership of Vindicated word that's what the prophet said ain't that right the leadership of Jesus Christ now now we'll find him in Luke 12 and 16. Jesus said that this rich young man brought forth plentifully naturally plentifully and he thought within himself saying what shall I do because I have no room where to bestow my fruits and he said this will I do I will pull down my Barns and build greater and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods and I will say to my soul so thou Hast much Goods laid up for many years take thine ease eat drink and be merry in that laodicea today but God would say unto him thou full this night thy Soul shall be required of Thee then who shall those things be which thou has provided then you say Amen while the world laodicea is taking rest got their yachts they got their nice cards they got their air-conditioned homes they got it all anything they want they got it and if they ain't got the money for it they got the credit card for it that's right and it's a credit card ain't doing it welfare we'll do it we are so at ease in Zion can you say amen and while they're taking it easy there's a bomb waiting for us written with America's USA can you say man better here God would say notice not not requiring what you stored up I ain't God ain't requiring that God ain't requiring your boats and your fancy houses and your fancy clothes and your fancy hats and and your fancy hairdos he ain't he ain't gonna require that he's going to require of your soul I gave you a soul what did you do with it I gave you a soul what did you invest with it can you say Amen listen now this man was very religious he kept the Commandments from his you but his soul had never been transformed so what he done is he whitewashed everything ain't that right he whitewashed everything else but his soul was black he couldn't whitewash the soul now notice brother Brown would tell us now because we just read about the rain and falling on the just and the unjust he said the same water that puts life into the wheat also puts life into the cockover but at the bottom of the cockover it's a of her life right so the rain you you plant your garden amen and and you're waiting for that rain to fall on that Garden because you sowed your seeds but that rain is not only benefiting amen your your vegetable your tomatoes and your potatoes and your your your all your eight is or whatever see he it's not only benefiting that but the grass is growing the Thorns are growing and and everything else is growing can you say Amen everything is benefiting but the rain doesn't turn your grass into cucumber that's great ain't that right the rain doesn't turn the weeds into broccoli so here he says see it's just Caulk of our life it's rejoicing and blooming and got life and doing everything that the wheat does but the soul of it is Cocker Burr [Music] and here that's where we're at now false teachers false prophets false christs for us anointed ones can you say amen he said see teaching all kinds of trinitarianism and everything else and be Anointed with the Holy Ghost and can even manifest the fruits of the spirit [Music] can you say amen and everything else and be Anointed with the Holy Ghost and perform just as many miracles as the true gospel can but by the word here that's what does it how do they respond to the Vindicated word of the hour they have all the emotion that the real Revival has they shout they scream they dance and the prophet said they really get something out of that anointing hope that's all right brother Brown said I was out there in Africa one day some of the kids was talking about these rock and roll songs that Elvis Presley and them was singing Pat Boone and whatever more Ricky Nelson and all them others he said I told him they're a bunch of Renegades I'll tell you what it still stands today there are a bunch of Renegades these people that can go out there and sing country songs and come back and sing gospel songs they're Renegades Randy Travis a renegade [Applause] and I know we got young people that likes that guy he's a renegade he's nothing but Elvis Presley again can you say Amen and and we can go into even in the in these southern gospel groups too The Isaacs are even starting to sing uh ungodly songs Renegades I've just I've just been truthful with you now there's there's so many grooves that are turning in because they're they're losing they're losing popularity in the Christian world and now they got to go out and get this secular World their Renegades all right so they're talking about Elvis Presley all these guys and some little girl said but why he's very religious and I said so was Judas and I said Judas got only 30 got only got 30 pieces of silver Elvis Presley got several million dollars they both sold out their birthrights he said and that's the very worst indentment this nation's got still just as deceiving as the filter of the cigarette these denominations let those members come in they ought to even be says there ought to be a law there ought to be a law that they couldn't sing religious songs ought to be against the law for them to do it can you say Amen but listen he says the whole thing has become one great big pile of hypocrisy there's where they stay today ain't that right the Bible says if you love the world the things of the world the love of God is not even in you he said you cannot say that rock and roll is of god rock and roll is of the world in any of those dances and nasty filthy things is of the world it's all of the world you can't say that bobbed hair uh uh for a woman is of God the Bible says it's not so it's the filth of the world and if you love one Speck of the world the love of God is Not In You Now where's that at it's in the soul can you say Amen but you'll see them bobbed hair preaching you'll see them bob hair dancing and saying the Lord spoke to me and they're speaking in tongues but we're talking about the soul of man really changed the soul the soul it's that Soul can you say man now David's not a hypocrite for he said he restoreth my soul I hope this is all right the love of God is not even in you he said what's that well what's drawing it see it's something down inside drawing the soul is drawing your resource through the outside down through the spirit into the soul and if the soul loves the world it's dead I don't care how annoying how it's anointed it is out here in your spirit realm and how righteous is out here in that Spirit realm down in your soul it's dead and they're like these saw was outwardly he was okay outwardly he was religious I would say he was the guy you would pick Kane was religious on the outside Balaam was religious on the outside Judas religious on the outside and when it came to religion Esau seemed to be more religious than Jacob was he seemed to be the better man than Jacob can you say Amen but now get to the soul that's what made the difference can you say Amen now brother Bradham would tell us he was outwardly religious talking to these so I'll bet his thinking was not filtered he didn't think right of the birthright he didn't think that the birthright meant as much as God said it did and so many people just don't think God really means what he says he does and they'll they'll pervert it they'll twist it around they'll let some guy talk him out of it and convince him that it's not right it's not true and and and and and all it's just nonsense you understand what I'm saying amen but see he says there he was and he said I'm hungry what difference does it make about the old Birthright you can have it if you want it oh my I go to church I'm just as good as you are my denomination is just as well yes one of the greatest in the world my mother belongs to it my father belonged to it all this that and the other my pastor was educated he got so so you know so and so that puts him much farther from God ain't that right amen notice is this okay Balaam the prophet said Nate and Balaam was anointed with the same holy spirit that Moses was now listen to that but Moses was a man sent from God with the word of God amen now let's look brother Brandon says what is the difference what was the difference between Moses and Bala the teaching of Moses was perfect I know we got a lot of anointing men around here got their tooting their little horns and they want to tell us that brother Brown's Ministry wasn't perfect in that just like Balaam they failed to see the smitten Rock he failed to see the pillar of Fire he failed to see the atonement and he started pulling all the pointing out all the faults and nitpicking the church can you say Amen but here a prophet is saying but the teaching of Moses was perfect and I say the teaching of William Branham is perfect these others may be anointed just as much but the teaching is perfect can you say Amen the Bible said here in second Peter that it was the teaching of Balaam that Israel received that God never did forgive unpardonable sin see not a one of them got saved out of all that preaching neither one of them oh they come to the altar they shave their tear they've done it all they wrote on the floor and not on one of them getting saved amen you're with me oh they're having their revivals what they call revivals not one of them getting saved though they had come out under out under the blessings of God and seen the hand of God moving by this Mighty prophet and seen it exactly Vindicated by god notice it's the same thing today ain't that right and because another Prophet come in with a teaching contrary and disputed with Moses and tried to prove to the people that Moses was wrong it aren't they doing that today and Nathan Cora and many of them agreed with him and taught the children of Israel to commit fornication to go after his organization that we're all the same we're all the same let's all just love let's not offend people we're all the same hogwash that's a teaching of Balaam that's the teaching that the people went after and God never did forgive them then you say Amen well whether we're methodists Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostals want more we're all the same we are not the same you are a separated people holy unto the Lord dedicated to the word and the spirit of God to bear fruit of his promise of this day how many is dedicated for that that's what you were predestinated to that's what you were born for not to mingle your seed with the world you said you're not one of them I know that's awful strong but that's the truth just the same dedicated to a service in these last days come out from amongst it he said now the teaching of Balaam not the prophecy of Balaam remember that thank God for a prophet he's going to show you something now here Balaam was wrong in his teaching and yet he gave a prophecy and God blessed it God honored that prophecy because it was the teaching of Balaam that was wrong not the prophecy he said that was all right that was God he said the prophecy of Balaam was exactly right because he couldn't speak nothing else the anointing of God wouldn't speak nothing else the anointing God doesn't curse his people their world may want to curse you the world may want to call you a non-fit for heaven but the blessings are the anointing of God will never curse you not the bride not the people of God no no no no amen so the anointing of God wouldn't speak nothing else and God Vindicated it by proving it was the truth but it was the teaching of Balaam now compare that with Matthew 24 24 anointed ones but their teaching is false the trinities and all these things like that it's the wrong it's wrong it's Antichrist I know you know some of them don't think we ought to be singing songs that you know that the the worldly people write amen but they don't understand the anointing is there and that anointing is real using them gifts and they can write songs like like I pledge allegiance to the blood what's wrong with that song come on Church what's wrong with them songs that we sing about God and and worshiping God their teaching is wrong yes but if God can use Balaam God can still use people today we get so sophisticated in our minds that we just put a God in a box but the prophet are he told his false anointed ones they confuse us [Music] brother random said the true filter will set all those things out and bring nothing but the trueness of God the word into the real true soul amen so now he goes on to say I hope I'm born you I'm enjoying myself people can live in this spirit and they dance in the spirit they shout in the spirit they go to church in the spirit and they can absolutely have the real spirit of God anointed on that Spirit but still be lost just as devil possessed as they can be with that spirit because watch that's the reason you couldn't tell that woman she was wearing shorts and was wrong you couldn't tell her bobbing her hair was wrong you can't tell most people anything that is wrong anymore can you say Amen well that woman said well what's your hair Got to Do With It Well then brother Brown replies well it did for Samson hair mannered for Samson amen can I go on brother Brown says looky here I know I've kept you long I'm sorry I'll close I gotta quit and but I gotta read this verse Adam said looky here here's a little lady twisting herself down the street here's a young fella his eyes catch it he's a member of the church he's a Pentecostal he's whatever he is but the first thing you know there's no hope Post in there she'll say hello and he's got curly hair kind of nice looking straight and shouldered young man maybe tried to live right and she start walking up to him and he's even a preacher the first thing you know now what is it this out here the flesh desire but the spirit down here yet anointed saying don't do it don't do it but what will it do it'll move right around there hold there it goes the first thing you know he's trying to make a date with her he's guilty of committing adultery whether he touches her or not now listen now he's anointed where his spirit but a genuine born-again Son of God Amen you can't do it yourself now he said it's totally impossible for a red-blooded male to walk before a female like that without something taking place but when there is something on the inside not the spirit but the inside of the inside that little born against something here see the soul he said see though that man might have shouted spoke in tongues jump dance and everything else Anointed with the spirit done all the signs and wonders that God said in there by his Spirit Jesus said many will come to me in that day and say Lord have I not prophesied in your name cast out devils in your name have not this and he said depart for me ye that work iniquity what is Iniquity something that you know to do and don't do it depart for me ye that worked iniquity I didn't even know you but down on the inside of that man if that little Thai post is in there that seed of God that was predestinated before the foundation of the world I don't care what takes place it holds him it's there to stay can you say Amen oh do you love him if the musicians will come I gotta close so uh a person can be Anointed with the same spirit that a True Believer is Anointed with but listen brother Brown says but down on the inside of that next rim say Body Spirit down into the next realm the soul the third Rim is the soul and that's predestinated by God there is where the real sea germ Lays is in there can you say man now listen and remember if I take a of Burr and cut it open draft it draft into it the heart of a wheat and put it in there bury it it would bring forth the wheat out of the Cocker burn no matter what the outside is what the emotions see how he's getting down to it your body could be corrupt your body could be old your body could be still full of you know as as as see it's it's still subject to things but if that Soul down inside of you was changed no matter what this body is doing it's producing a son of God hello see the spirit can be anointed and never produce the Son of God it can produce emotions [Music] ain't that right so he says today so many confused about the evidence of the Holy Ghost and so forth Satan can impersonate any kind of a gift that God's got but it cannot bring that word word by word there's where he felt in the Garden of Eden that's where he always failed that's where them see on the tape false anointed ones anointed ones they can be Anointed with the spirit speak in tongues Dan shout preach the gospel and steal a devil it's the inside everybody say it's the inside can you say Amen now I I know I wish this is long and I've got a lot but that's okay I hope I made a little bit of sense to you today but I I will say this God restores the soul why to make a word bride it's not after a church he's after a bride he's not after what Pentecost thought was it and that's the restoration of gifts speaking in tongues and shouting and running all over the place and rolling on the floor and then still living like a devil outside I didn't make bright [Music] didn't bring maturity brought the restoration of the Soul that keeps that bride intact that's why there's going to be real young people in this age middle age whatever and and the devil's going to do everything he can to sway you but God has got to your soul and has restored your soul oh do you love him isn't he wonderful amen what song what's on your plane yeah the anchor holds [Music] though the ship be better [Music] the anchor home [Music] though the sails I had fallen on my knees as I face the rage and seas that the anchor holds in spite of the storm can we stand to our feet and see the anger home [Music] though the sheer be better [Music] the anchor home though the Sails are told [Music] I had fallen on my knees [Music] as I face the rage and see the anchor holds inspired the storm don't sing it again though the ship aren't you glad The Anchor Holds Hallelujah hold the anchor hold though the Sails are torn torn I had fallen on my knees [Music] her whole foreign I had fallen on my knees oh I had fallen oh my knees as I face the rage and see The Anchor Holds oh in spite of the storm can you lift your hands and just Worship the Lord
