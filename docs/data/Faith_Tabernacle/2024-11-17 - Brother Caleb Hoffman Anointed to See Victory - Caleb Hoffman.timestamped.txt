[49:36] believe that this morning amen well God
[49:39] bless y'all we greet you from our church
[49:40] back home Bible believer Church of Lama
[49:42] Ohio our pastor brother Jonathan Martin
[49:44] he's an old stranger to you guys he
[49:46] sends his greetings I also bring
[49:48] greetings from my wife Zion she asked
[49:50] that I would greet you guys and uh
[49:52] apologize on her behalf she wasn't able
[49:54] to make it she's been battling with the
[49:56] Sickness last a little bit and we just
[49:57] thought it best that she'd stay home and
[49:59] rest this trip so she sure did want to
[50:01] be here and she asked me to greet
[50:02] you'all for her so instead we brought
[50:05] these two guys both of them together
[50:06] ain't as pretty as she is but we're
[50:09] doing
[50:10] okay amen I sure do appreciate brother M
[50:12] Nathaniel coming along helping me drive
[50:14] helping us out we should appreciate them
[50:16] should appreciate brother Sea and the
[50:18] church y'all having us this morning uh
[50:20] sure is a an honor whenever you know a
[50:22] pastor has confidence in you not only to
[50:24] preach for him but especially whenever
[50:26] he ain't there you know to so we sure do
[50:28] appreciate that and the confidence
[50:30] looking forward to what the Lord has in
[50:31] store for us today if we can let's turn
[50:33] in our Bibles to the Book of Psalms
[50:36] we're going to begin in Psalms 20 and
[50:38] we're going to begin in verse one there
[50:41] and once we're done there we're going to
[50:42] go to Isaiah the 10th chapter and we're
[50:44] going to begin in verse
[50:52] 24 The Book of Psalms 20 verse1 it would
[50:56] say the Lord hear thee in the day of
[50:57] trouble the name of the god of Jacob
[51:00] defend Thee I mean I think I thought
[51:02] that was amazing when I read that verse
[51:04] to think about that we serve a God
[51:05] that's so powerful and so mighty that
[51:07] just simply his name is a defense that
[51:09] we have against the enemy amen verse two
[51:12] send thee help from the sanctuary and
[51:14] strengthen thee out of Zion remember all
[51:16] thy offerings and accept thy burnt
[51:18] sacrifices say Grant thee according to
[51:20] thine own heart and fulfill all thy
[51:22] counsel we will rejoice in thy salvation
[51:25] and in the name of our God will we set
[51:27] up our banners and the Lord fulfill all
[51:29] thy petitions now I know that the Lord
[51:31] saveth his anointed and he will hear him
[51:35] from his holy heaven with the saving
[51:36] strength of his right hand I want to
[51:38] pause here for just a moment in reading
[51:40] this it says here in this sixth verse
[51:42] now I want now know I that the Lord
[51:44] saveth his anointed now if you look at
[51:46] this word saveth in the Hebrew
[51:47] concordance it would actually mean to be
[51:49] victorious or to give Victory unto so
[51:52] this verse would read now I know that
[51:53] the Lord gives Victory unto his anointed
[51:56] he will hear him from his holy heaven
[51:58] with the saving strength of his right
[51:59] hand some trust in chariots and some in
[52:02] horses but we will remember the name of
[52:04] the Lord Our God they are brought down
[52:06] and they are Fallen but we are risen and
[52:08] we stand upright save Lord again give
[52:11] Victory Lord and let the king hear us
[52:13] when we call amen and from there going
[52:15] to the book of Isaiah the 10th chapter
[52:18] and verse
[52:20] 24 it would say therefore thus saith the
[52:23] Lord God of hosts oh my people that
[52:25] dwelleth in Zion be not afraid of the
[52:28] Assyrian he shall smite thee with the
[52:30] rod and he shall lift up his staff
[52:31] against thee after the manner of Egypt
[52:33] for yet a very little while and the
[52:35] indignation shall seize and my anger in
[52:37] their destruction and the Lord of host
[52:39] shall stir up a Scourge for him
[52:41] according to the slaughter of median at
[52:43] the rock of orb and as his Rod was upon
[52:45] the sea so shall he lift it up after the
[52:47] manner of Egypt and it shall come to
[52:49] pass in that day that his burden shall
[52:51] be taken away from off thy shoulder and
[52:53] his yoke from off thy neck and the Yoke
[52:55] shall be destroyed it because of the
[52:58] anointing I would like to take my text
[53:00] this morning here out of this passage of
[53:01] scripture and if I can take for a title
[53:03] anointed to see Victory anointed to see
[53:06] Victory let's bow our heads this morning
[53:08] dear father we come before you humbly
[53:10] Lord and graciously father Lord we thank
[53:12] you so much Lord for the blessings that
[53:14] you've given us Lord just the
[53:15] opportunity to be able to gather
[53:16] together Lord and to be able to worship
[53:18] your name father Lord to be able to
[53:19] Worship You Lord in spirit and in truth
[53:22] Lord to be able to gather together in
[53:23] your presence father Lord and to
[53:24] Fellowship Lord under your anointing
[53:26] Lord how we love you and we thank you
[53:28] Father Lord as we enter into this
[53:29] service father Lord the songs have been
[53:31] sung Lord your presence has dropped in
[53:33] Among Us already father but Lord I ask
[53:35] that as the word begins to come forth
[53:36] you would just Lord you would move this
[53:38] broken vessel out of the way Lord you
[53:39] would just move me aside and you would
[53:41] come forth Lord and you're your presence
[53:43] and your spirit would speak Lord and you
[53:45] would meet the needs father you know
[53:46] every heart you know every soul here in
[53:47] this building you know what they have
[53:48] need of Lord we put the service to your
[53:50] hands we ask Lord that we would Lord
[53:52] surrender it all to you and that you
[53:54] would just come in and move in a mighty
[53:55] way we love you we thank you Jesus in
[53:57] your name we pray amen y'all can be
[54:00] seated this morning so laying a
[54:03] foundation for this thought here we see
[54:05] in this passage of scripture in Isaiah
[54:06] you've got to understand the backstory
[54:08] of what is going on here just a short
[54:11] little recap the army of Assyria is
[54:13] marching on the kingdom of Judah they
[54:15] have just finished taking over and
[54:16] completely wiping out Israel completely
[54:18] annihilating the country of Israel and
[54:20] now they are Marching on Judah now
[54:22] Assyria throughout this time throughout
[54:24] the Old Testament Israel Assyria is one
[54:27] of Israel and judah's most ferocious
[54:29] enemies we are at war with Assyria
[54:31] almost constantly throughout the Old
[54:32] Testament now if you begin to look you
[54:34] will see that at this period in time
[54:36] while the country of Judah they have
[54:37] stayed with the word they have stayed
[54:38] with what God has told them to do Israel
[54:40] has long left the word Israel has long
[54:42] left God as a matter of fact ever since
[54:44] the kingdom would be divided after King
[54:45] Solomon and two tribes would go into
[54:47] King rabom and become the king of Judah
[54:49] and the other 10 would go into go into
[54:51] King Jobo and will become the king of
[54:53] Israel after this has happened there was
[54:55] never again Godly King over Israel never
[54:57] again was there a Godly King but the
[54:59] nation of Israel would just begin to
[55:00] decline farther and farther into sin as
[55:02] time went on and so because of it now we
[55:05] see that uh God has allowed Assyria to
[55:08] move in he has allowed this King to move
[55:10] in and to completely overtake the
[55:11] country to clean him out to carry him
[55:13] away into captivity and this would
[55:15] actually be the last time that Israel is
[55:16] ever defeated this would be the last
[55:18] time that Israel that that they ever
[55:19] come together because these lost in
[55:21] tribes after they are overtaken by
[55:23] Assyria they would never again reunite
[55:25] they would never again come to together
[55:26] but at this point they would actually be
[55:28] scattered all throughout the world and
[55:29] they would never again return until
[55:31] World War II and so now we see that we
[55:33] have painted a very ugly picture for the
[55:35] king of Judah a very ugly picture
[55:37] because now the king of Judah he has
[55:39] just watched the king of Assyria come in
[55:41] and completely overtake the country
[55:42] right next to him he has just watched
[55:44] what they have done he has watched the
[55:45] Army come in and and and completely
[55:47] overtake them and now we see that uh the
[55:50] Bible says that the king of Assyria
[55:52] begins to get boastful the Bible says
[55:54] that he begins to get prideful he said
[55:55] the Bible says he begins to get lifted
[55:57] up in his heart and he begins to say I'm
[55:59] going to do into Judah What I've Done
[56:00] into Israel he says I'm going to do to
[56:02] Jerusalem what I did into Samaria and so
[56:05] now this stru F into the heart of the
[56:06] king of Judah we see he sees what's
[56:08] happened to Israel he's heard the army
[56:09] of Syria is on its way so I want you to
[56:11] notice his response what does he do does
[56:13] he start mustering his forces Gathering
[56:15] his armies Gathering the generals
[56:16] preparing for war preparing for battle
[56:18] no the prophet of God said or the Bible
[56:19] says that he went to the prophet that
[56:21] was his immediate response when the
[56:23] enemy came unto him whenever the enemy
[56:25] challenged him his immediate response
[56:26] was to go and consult the prophet so he
[56:29] goes to Isaiah and he asks what are we
[56:30] going to do and this scripture here that
[56:32] we are reading Isaiah the 10th chapter
[56:34] this is Isaiah's response to the king of
[56:36] judah's plea now I want you to notice
[56:38] his response the prophet tells God's
[56:40] people don't be afraid of this King
[56:42] don't be afraid of this enemy he said
[56:43] his yoke shall be destroyed his the the
[56:46] the the power that this enemy has over
[56:47] you is going to be destroyed now notice
[56:49] why because of the anointing not because
[56:51] you have followed me not because you
[56:52] have kept my Commandments not because
[56:54] you are a better people than Israel is
[56:55] but because you are my anointed people
[56:58] that you will be the people that I will
[57:00] save you will be the people that I will
[57:01] deliver because you are my anointed I
[57:03] will bring you freedom I will bring you
[57:04] Deliverance I will bring you Liberty
[57:06] because you are my anointed when I was
[57:07] looking at that I thought it was so
[57:09] powerful to see that God was Sav and
[57:11] will give power and authority unto a
[57:12] people for no other reason than they
[57:15] were his anointed people for no other
[57:17] reason that they were chosen and
[57:18] predestinated by God to be a people that
[57:20] were placed under his anointing and me I
[57:22] just want to begin this morning by
[57:23] saying I believe this bride is Anointed
[57:25] I don't believe there would be any
[57:26] dispute in that this morning that I'm
[57:28] standing this morning not just before
[57:29] the Bride of Jesus Christ but before the
[57:31] anointed bride of Jesus Christ I don't
[57:33] believe that we just sympathize with the
[57:35] anointing I don't believe that we just
[57:36] talk about the anointing that we are
[57:38] content with just feeling the effects of
[57:39] that anointing but the same anointing
[57:41] that flow through Jesus Christ is now
[57:43] flowing through this bride the same
[57:45] anointing that flow through the angel
[57:46] messenger is now flowing inside the
[57:48] heart of every believer that has come
[57:50] under the headship of that angel
[57:51] messenger amen I believe that we have
[57:54] that anointing and there's one thing
[57:55] that I want to make clear that devil
[57:56] this morning is that I know that I am
[57:58] anointed I know I've Got The Power of
[58:00] God I know I've got the Holy Ghost I
[58:02] know who I am I know where I came from I
[58:04] know where I'm going I know that I am
[58:06] anointed amen and the prophet of God
[58:08] would say if the Messiah means anointed
[58:10] he was the Messiah because he was
[58:12] anointed with the fullness of God then
[58:14] we are anointed too with the same Spirit
[58:16] now you say how do you know that you're
[58:18] Anointed with the same spirit with the
[58:19] same life the things that he did he that
[58:22] believeth on me the works that I do
[58:23] shall he do also what did he say and say
[58:26] St John 5:19 verily verily I say unto
[58:28] you the son can do nothing but what he
[58:30] sees the father doing that doeth the son
[58:32] likewise and any correct Messiah would
[58:35] have the same message so if God does any
[58:37] one thing any child of God is going to
[58:39] do the same thing do you believe that
[58:40] this morning if the Messiah is anything
[58:42] any Messiah is going to do the same
[58:44] thing so if God is Anointed his children
[58:46] are anointed if Christ is Anointed his
[58:48] bride is Anointed there's no question
[58:50] about it there's no wondering there is
[58:51] no confusion and I just want to tell
[58:53] somebody this morning I might not know
[58:54] what you're going through I might not
[58:55] know what you're dealing I might not
[58:56] know what you're battling with but it
[58:58] really don't matter if I know it really
[58:59] don't matter if I know your situation
[59:01] because no matter what it is I can stand
[59:02] in confidence this morning and I can
[59:04] tell you that you were anointed by God
[59:06] to see Victory you were anointed by God
[59:09] to overcome you were anointed by God oh
[59:11] to come through this to come through
[59:12] this storm to come through this trial
[59:14] and to stand Victorious on the other
[59:15] side oh not because you're a good person
[59:18] not because you come to church twice a
[59:19] week not because you you you listen to
[59:21] tapes every day not because you read
[59:23] your Bible not because you do all these
[59:24] things but because there has been an
[59:26] anointing that has been placed upon the
[59:28] Bride of Jesus Christ has been placed
[59:29] upon you you are anointed to see Victory
[59:32] you weren't anointed for defeat you
[59:33] weren't anointed to fail you weren't
[59:35] anointed to watch the enemy Prevail in
[59:36] your life but you were anointed to
[59:38] overcome you were anointed to Prevail
[59:40] you were anointed to destroy the Yoke of
[59:42] every enemy that would come against you
[59:44] you were anointed to see Victory I love
[59:46] how the prophet would say you were
[59:47] anointed too with the same Spirit not a
[59:50] similar Spirit not a loing spirit but
[59:52] the Same Spirit In other words the
[59:53] spirit that Quicken Christ is the Same
[59:55] Spirit that's quickened you the spirit
[59:56] that raised Christ up from the dead is
[59:58] the same spirit that raised you up from
[59:59] the dead The Same Spirit the same power
[1:00:01] that was placed upon the physical body
[1:00:03] of Christ is the Same Spirit that's
[1:00:04] moving today through the spiritual body
[1:00:06] of Christ amen the prophet would go on
[1:00:08] and he would say the Holy Spirit Body of
[1:00:10] Christ will move just as Christ moves
[1:00:12] and if Christ in heaven can never get
[1:00:14] his spiritual body on Earth moving as he
[1:00:17] wants it to move watch for things to
[1:00:19] happen he said now it's beginning to
[1:00:21] come to life they've paralyzed it long
[1:00:23] enough but the holy spirit is bringing
[1:00:25] life into it and it's beginning to wake
[1:00:27] up and it's begin to move because it
[1:00:29] sees its position amen church this
[1:00:32] anointing this Holy Ghost is bringing
[1:00:34] life into the body I ain't looking at a
[1:00:36] dead corpse this morning I ain't looking
[1:00:37] at a dead body I ain't looking at a at a
[1:00:39] still paralyzed body but I'm looking at
[1:00:41] a group of people that have allowed the
[1:00:43] anointing that God placed upon them to
[1:00:45] move through their life you are moving
[1:00:47] as Christ moved you are living as Christ
[1:00:49] moved you are moving you are you have
[1:00:51] stepped into your position you are
[1:00:53] anointed by God to step into that
[1:00:55] position because God had a purpose for
[1:00:56] your life he had a purpose for you he
[1:00:58] had a position for you he had a stand
[1:01:00] for you that he wanted you to stand on
[1:01:02] and God has anointed you to step into
[1:01:04] that position if Christ was anointed to
[1:01:06] withstand Satan I say I'm anointed to
[1:01:07] withstand Satan if Christ was anointed
[1:01:09] to raise from the dead there's no reason
[1:01:11] I'm going to stay in the grave because I
[1:01:12] was anointed to raise from the dead if
[1:01:14] Christ was anointed to do anything to
[1:01:16] stand Victorious to overcome I am
[1:01:17] anointed to do the same thing because I
[1:01:19] am the manifestation of Jesus Christ and
[1:01:22] as that manifestation I will do anything
[1:01:24] that Christ did I will manifest the same
[1:01:26] power I will manifest the same Authority
[1:01:28] I will manifest the same anointing that
[1:01:30] was placed upon him because I the
[1:01:31] manifestation of Jesus Christ and that
[1:01:33] word has come to life inside of this
[1:01:35] body because I have stepped into my
[1:01:37] position under the anointing of the word
[1:01:40] the prophet would say as Jehovah Eagle
[1:01:41] is the Great Eagle we're the eaglets
[1:01:43] he's the Messiah and with the same
[1:01:45] anointing we are the Messiahs amen
[1:01:48] anointed Messiah means the anointed one
[1:01:50] he asked the question are you anointed
[1:01:52] amen with what the same spirit that he
[1:01:55] was anointed with
[1:01:56] The Same Spirit he was anointed with
[1:01:58] amen now Isaiah 61 and verse1 it's a
[1:02:01] very familiar scripture to us but it
[1:02:03] would say the spirit of the Lord God is
[1:02:04] upon me because the Lord hath anointed
[1:02:06] me to preach Good Tidings to the meek he
[1:02:09] has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted
[1:02:11] to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and
[1:02:12] the opening of the prison to them that
[1:02:14] are bound to proclaim the acceptable
[1:02:16] year of the Lord oh thank you the
[1:02:19] acceptable year of the Lord and the day
[1:02:21] of Vengeance of our God to comfort all
[1:02:23] that mourn to appoint unto them the
[1:02:25] mourn and and to give un to them Beauty
[1:02:27] for Ashes the oil of joy for mourning
[1:02:29] the Garment of Praise for the spirit of
[1:02:31] heaviness that they might be called the
[1:02:33] Trees of Righteousness the planting of
[1:02:34] the Lord that he might be glorified now
[1:02:36] I want you to remember in reading this
[1:02:39] this chapter is speaking of Jesus Christ
[1:02:41] right is prophesying of the role of
[1:02:43] Jesus Christ and the anointing that will
[1:02:44] be placed upon him and I thought it was
[1:02:46] so powerful that before the prophet of
[1:02:47] God would ever come along and would show
[1:02:49] us that we will be placed under the same
[1:02:51] anointing as Christ God would actually
[1:02:53] give us a list of everything that Jesus
[1:02:55] Christ was anointed to do he was
[1:02:56] anointed to preach the word he was
[1:02:58] anointed to bind the Brokenhearted he
[1:02:59] was anointed to Proclaim Liberty to get
[1:03:01] Beauty for Ashes to open the prisons to
[1:03:03] them that are bound Jesus Christ was
[1:03:05] anointed to do all these things through
[1:03:06] his Natural Body and now the private
[1:03:08] will come along and would say that the
[1:03:10] natural always tops the spiritual so
[1:03:12] anything that Christ was anointed to do
[1:03:14] the body was anointed to do the
[1:03:15] spiritual body was anointed to do she is
[1:03:17] Anointed to preach the word she is
[1:03:19] Anointed to bind the Brokenhearted she
[1:03:20] is Anointed to open the prisons she is
[1:03:22] Anointed to give Beauty for Ashes she is
[1:03:24] Anointed to do all these things oh
[1:03:26] because Christ was anointed to do it in
[1:03:28] the sermon why are people so tossed
[1:03:29] about the prophet will go through Isaiah
[1:03:31] 61 and he would talk about this
[1:03:33] anointing they'll be placed upon Jesus I
[1:03:34] would recommend you go and listen to
[1:03:35] this sermon it's a it's it's a powerful
[1:03:37] sermon why are people so tossed about
[1:03:39] and he would talk about this anointing
[1:03:41] that be placed upon Jesus and he would
[1:03:43] say now that is what's here he would say
[1:03:45] now that's what's here I love that it's
[1:03:47] not something we're looking for out in
[1:03:48] the future it's not something that we
[1:03:49] had out in history it's not something we
[1:03:51] just read about in this book in this
[1:03:52] Bible it's not something that was just
[1:03:54] for brother Brandon wasn't something
[1:03:55] that was just for 1965 it wasn't just
[1:03:57] something that was just for those people
[1:03:58] it was just for the apostles it was just
[1:04:00] for the prophets it was just for Jesus
[1:04:01] but he said that anointing is now here
[1:04:04] that power is out here I just want to
[1:04:05] say this morning the anointing is here
[1:04:07] the anointing favors the Bride of Jesus
[1:04:09] Christ oh you look the denominations
[1:04:11] have a portion of the anointing the
[1:04:13] Pentecostals have a portion of the
[1:04:14] anointing and they're content with their
[1:04:16] portion the prophets God said that man
[1:04:18] will be given a lesser portion of the
[1:04:19] anointing but that the that the body of
[1:04:21] Christ would have so much anointing that
[1:04:23] she would be the fullness of the godhead
[1:04:25] deity oh I say I'm not living with a
[1:04:27] partial anointing I'm not living with
[1:04:29] just a little bit of anointing I'm not
[1:04:30] living with just a small aspect of that
[1:04:32] anointing oh but I am living with the
[1:04:34] full anointing of God oh this anointing
[1:04:37] church has been placed upon this bride
[1:04:39] of Jesus Christ not just some of it but
[1:04:41] every single bit of it there ain't no
[1:04:42] limit to what you can do there ain't no
[1:04:44] limit to where you can go he didn't say
[1:04:46] you can go to this church age or you can
[1:04:48] go to this point you can go to this
[1:04:49] point and then you're going to be done
[1:04:50] no he said I'm going to have a bride
[1:04:52] that's going to be placed under an
[1:04:54] anointing and that anointing is going to
[1:04:56] take them all the way it's not going to
[1:04:58] take them halfway it's not going to take
[1:04:59] them 75% it's not going to take them 99%
[1:05:03] but that anointing is going to take them
[1:05:05] all the way that anointing is going to
[1:05:07] take them all the way amen I love that
[1:05:10] oh I love that we've been given the full
[1:05:12] anointing to take this message and to
[1:05:14] apply every word to apply every single
[1:05:16] promise to live in Victory to live an
[1:05:18] overcoming life I don't know about you
[1:05:19] church but I'm not satisfied with
[1:05:21] manifesting a portion of this message
[1:05:23] I'm not satisfied with just expressing a
[1:05:25] portion of this word oh but give me
[1:05:27] every word I say give me every line give
[1:05:29] me every single promise give me every
[1:05:31] single precept give me everything it
[1:05:33] said I want to manifest the easy Parts I
[1:05:35] want to manifest the hard Parts I want
[1:05:37] to manifest the encouraging Parts I want
[1:05:39] to manifest the rough Parts I might not
[1:05:40] fully get it I might not fully
[1:05:42] understand it but if the word said it
[1:05:44] then I'm going to believe it and I say
[1:05:45] I'm going to manifest it because I was
[1:05:47] anointed to manifest it I was anointed
[1:05:49] to live it I was anointed to stand in
[1:05:52] Victory I was anointed to overcome I was
[1:05:54] anointed to say there ain't no devil
[1:05:56] there ain't no sickness there ain't no
[1:05:58] power there ain't no principality there
[1:06:00] ain't no Darkness there ain't nothing
[1:06:02] that can stop a memory of the B body of
[1:06:04] Jesus Christ that has come under the
[1:06:05] anointing of God hallelujah I was
[1:06:09] anointed to Manifest this message the
[1:06:12] prophet of God would say in Christ's
[1:06:13] mystery God revealed there would be a
[1:06:15] Time come forth when he could express
[1:06:17] himself in the fullness of his godhead
[1:06:18] deity through his church having the
[1:06:21] preeminence in this church oh my what
[1:06:23] the anointed man now the anointed people
[1:06:26] I like that brother kale what kind of
[1:06:27] people are y'all over there we're
[1:06:29] anointed people oh my to bring back the
[1:06:32] anointed bride and the bridegroom
[1:06:34] anointed by Why by accepting what he
[1:06:36] turned down and Adam coming back with
[1:06:38] the anointing of the word because he
[1:06:40] said my word is spirit see Anointed with
[1:06:42] the word so we aren't just anointed but
[1:06:44] we are anointed with the very word of
[1:06:46] God so we see brother brandham is
[1:06:48] telling us here that there will come a
[1:06:49] time when God would have a desire to
[1:06:51] express himself in fullness not express
[1:06:54] a portion of himself not in heart but
[1:06:56] his desire was to be expressed in
[1:06:57] fullness there was going to come an age
[1:06:59] when God would have a desire to express
[1:07:01] who he was oh of what he was of what he
[1:07:03] could do of the power that he had and
[1:07:05] the way that he was going to express
[1:07:07] himself was through a group of people
[1:07:08] that were Anointed with the word not
[1:07:10] just any people not just any group not
[1:07:12] just any church but that word must come
[1:07:14] through God's anointed people now that
[1:07:17] word anoint means to consecrate to
[1:07:19] identify as sacred to set apart for a
[1:07:22] specific purpose so to think this
[1:07:23] morning this group of people this
[1:07:25] anointed body has been set apart for a
[1:07:27] specific purpose you've been consecrated
[1:07:29] church you've been set aside you are not
[1:07:31] a part of the world you are not a part
[1:07:32] of leot C you are not part of the church
[1:07:34] today Bo but you are a member of the
[1:07:36] Bride of Jesus Christ and you have been
[1:07:38] anointed you have been set apart you
[1:07:40] have been segregated you have been you
[1:07:42] have been divided you've been set apart
[1:07:43] I don't believe that God would set me
[1:07:45] apart from before the foundation of the
[1:07:46] world for just any reason I don't
[1:07:48] believe that God would just come and
[1:07:49] would predestinate me and would make me
[1:07:51] a member of this bride body for no
[1:07:52] reason but if God is going to anoint a
[1:07:54] group of people is because he has a
[1:07:56] purpose for that group of people is
[1:07:58] because he has a purpose that he wants
[1:08:00] them to do I mean I mean maybe I'm just
[1:08:02] here to tell somebody maybe one person
[1:08:03] this morning that maybe you feel like
[1:08:05] what you're doing ain't good enough
[1:08:06] maybe you feel like you're helpless
[1:08:08] maybe you feel like you ain't doing
[1:08:09] nothing oh but if you are a member of
[1:08:10] the Bride body of Jesus Christ I'm here
[1:08:12] to tell you this morning there is a
[1:08:14] purpose that God has for your life
[1:08:16] because God does not send anointing
[1:08:17] without sending purpose God does not
[1:08:19] send anointing without giving you a
[1:08:21] position but if God anointed you as a
[1:08:23] member of the Bride body of Jesus Christ
[1:08:25] he has given you a position that you
[1:08:26] have to step into he has given you a
[1:08:29] purpose maybe sometimes you feel like
[1:08:30] just sitting there in the congregation
[1:08:32] maybe you feel like the that you're help
[1:08:34] but you ain't doing nothing maybe you
[1:08:35] feel like just aen in the preacher ain't
[1:08:37] doing nothing maybe you feel like oh
[1:08:38] just sitting out there just praying for
[1:08:40] people maybe you feel like you don't do
[1:08:41] nothing but I'm here to tell you this
[1:08:43] morning there is a purpose that God has
[1:08:45] for your life God has placed you under
[1:08:47] an anointing and that anointing has
[1:08:49] given you a purpose it has given you a
[1:08:51] position that you got to fulfill oh
[1:08:53] maybe the smallest person in the world
[1:08:55] brother Brandon said even if you are the
[1:08:57] even if you are the pey toe even if you
[1:08:59] are the skin on the bottom of your foot
[1:09:01] you still have a purpose you are still
[1:09:03] over every devil you are still over
[1:09:05] every sickness you are still over every
[1:09:06] complex you are still over every battle
[1:09:09] you are still in Victory because every
[1:09:11] part of Christ is Anointed every part of
[1:09:13] Christ has a purpose every part of
[1:09:15] Christ has a purpose has a position they
[1:09:17] have to
[1:09:18] F if you begin to study in the Bible you
[1:09:21] will see that there were only three
[1:09:22] groups of people that were anointed in
[1:09:24] the Old Testament there are the prophets
[1:09:26] there are the priests and the Kings
[1:09:28] these were the three positions and if
[1:09:29] you begin to look you will see that each
[1:09:31] of these roles had a very special
[1:09:32] purpose that they were elected to
[1:09:34] perform and as God's people it was only
[1:09:36] under that anointing that they could
[1:09:38] rightly fulfill the purpose the way that
[1:09:39] God had had designed them to do it and
[1:09:42] now we know that Jesus Christ came in a
[1:09:43] natural body he fulfilled all three of
[1:09:45] these roles that the anointing was
[1:09:47] designated for he was anointed as a
[1:09:49] prophet as a son of man he was anointed
[1:09:51] as a priest after the order of
[1:09:52] melchisedec he was anointed as a king as
[1:09:55] a king of Heaven as a king of all Kings
[1:09:57] he was anointed to be the complete
[1:09:59] fulfillment of the word and now the
[1:10:01] prophet will come along and will show us
[1:10:02] that the bride the body would be under
[1:10:04] the same subject to the same anointing
[1:10:06] as the head the brother Bandon would say
[1:10:08] anything that the head does the body has
[1:10:10] to follow if the body Rises up out of
[1:10:12] the Grave or the head rise up out of the
[1:10:14] Grave the body has to follow if the head
[1:10:16] moves the body has to move if the head
[1:10:18] stands the body has to H has to stand
[1:10:20] anything the head does the body has to
[1:10:22] do so if God predestinated you if he
[1:10:24] elected you and he anointed you and
[1:10:26] placed you inside of this body it is
[1:10:28] because he has a purpose for your life
[1:10:30] okay what is that purpose I'll just go
[1:10:32] back to what the prophet said he said
[1:10:34] that purpose is so so that so that he
[1:10:36] God the word could be made manifest
[1:10:38] through you Church who are you this
[1:10:40] morning you are the manifestation of the
[1:10:42] perfect word of God you are the
[1:10:44] manifestation of the word that was in
[1:10:45] the mind of God from before the
[1:10:47] foundation of the world you are made to
[1:10:49] Manifest this message you were made to
[1:10:51] Manifest this word you were made to
[1:10:53] stand and you were anointed to stand you
[1:10:55] were made to plant your feet down and to
[1:10:57] say I'm not going to back up I'm not
[1:10:59] going to move I won't go to the left I
[1:11:01] won't go to the right I have a position
[1:11:03] that God made me for I have a position
[1:11:05] that God anointed me to stand in and I
[1:11:08] ain't going to move but I'm going to
[1:11:09] plant my feet down this morning and I'm
[1:11:11] going to stand in a position that I was
[1:11:13] anointed to stand in he anointed me for
[1:11:15] this message so I'm going to live this
[1:11:17] message he anointed me for this word so
[1:11:19] I'm going to manifest his word he
[1:11:21] anointed me to stand in Victory so I
[1:11:23] will stop at nothing short of complete
[1:11:25] and total
[1:11:27] Victory oh hallelujah amen how was God

[1:11:41] individual that'll be willing to stand
[1:11:43] up and say God you've anointed me for
[1:11:46] something what is the purpose you have

[1:13:44] before the world was ever created before
[1:13:46] man was ever spoken into existence you

[1:14:12] facing why don't you just tell that
[1:14:13] devil devil before you were even created
[1:14:16] I was already anointed to defeat you

[1:17:12] Caleb how can you say that I'll show you
[1:17:13] by the word how I can say that the
[1:17:15] Pentecostal started shouting for Joy
[1:17:17] 1906 at isza street I was shout for Joy
[1:17:20] before the foundation of the world in
[1:17:22] the presence of my king I was crying
[1:17:24] holy holy holy holy oh before they were
[1:17:26] even dancing I was dancing before they
[1:17:29] were dancing I was shouting before they
[1:17:30] were shouting oh I was praising God I
[1:17:33] say before the world was ever created I
[1:17:35] was anointed to worship my God so why
[1:17:37] would any trial make me stop worshiping
[1:17:40] why would any devil make me stop
[1:17:42] worshiping I say I was anointed to
[1:17:44] return back from whence I came oh and if
[1:17:47] I was yaning for Joy over there I'm
[1:17:49] going to be dancing for joy over here
[1:17:51] I'm going to be shouting for Joy over
[1:17:52] here because I was anointed to see
[1:17:55] Victory oh you got to watch it Caleb be
[1:17:57] careful be careful Caleb you're saying
[1:17:59] that the anointing is that that's what
[1:18:01] the anointing is you got to dance you
[1:18:02] got to shout no I'm not saying that
[1:18:04] brother Brandon was very very clear he
[1:18:06] made it very very clear to us that that
[1:18:08] was not what the anointing was he said
[1:18:10] and why are people so tossed about he
[1:18:12] would go through it he would say the
[1:18:13] anointing is not emotion period make it
[1:18:16] very clear the anointing is not AEM
[1:18:18] motion that's not what the anointing is
[1:18:20] he said the anointing is supreme power
[1:18:22] in
[1:18:23] control supreme power in control oh okay
[1:18:27] what does that mean well in the sermon
[1:18:29] the uncertain sound the prophet will go
[1:18:30] through supreme power and he would say
[1:18:32] that by Perfect faith in the word of God
[1:18:34] the believer is given the supreme power
[1:18:36] of God so if God was going to give this
[1:18:39] supreme power unto a group of people he
[1:18:41] was going to give them a way to control
[1:18:43] it he had to give them a way to channel
[1:18:45] that power the prophet of God said that
[1:18:46] the Pentecostals could not have the
[1:18:48] power that we had he said that the
[1:18:49] Pentecostal had the power we had brother
[1:18:51] Braham said he they would be empty and
[1:18:53] out hospitals all over the world that's
[1:18:54] what they be doing with it oh but it
[1:18:56] wasn't meant for the world but this
[1:18:57] power was meant for this bride and so he
[1:18:59] was going to give this people a way to
[1:19:01] Channel or control this power and the
[1:19:03] way he would do that was through an
[1:19:05] anointing that would come in and then
[1:19:07] not only had the supreme power of God
[1:19:09] but it would also channel that power
[1:19:11] inside the believer inside the bride it
[1:19:13] would channel that power that's why
[1:19:15] every time you know when brother Baron
[1:19:17] would have a prayer line he would say
[1:19:18] I'm waiting I'm waiting on the anointing
[1:19:20] he would say I'm waiting on that power
[1:19:21] I'm waiting on the anointing to come
[1:19:22] down because it was only with that ano
[1:19:24] anointing that that power that was
[1:19:26] placed inside the bride that power of
[1:19:28] Jesus Christ could be channeled could be
[1:19:29] channeled could be worked through oh it
[1:19:31] was only under that anointing that's
[1:19:33] what it is brother bam said it's not a
[1:19:35] motion it's not a workup it's not a
[1:19:37] buildup it doesn't make you dance and
[1:19:39] Shout but now that thing's all right I
[1:19:41] love that stuff brother bernham said
[1:19:42] that joy in your victory was what
[1:19:44] brought that he said but the anointing
[1:19:46] is supreme power in control amen I love
[1:19:49] that this morning supreme power in
[1:19:52] control Hallelujah brother Brandon say
[1:19:55] Jesus was the most anointed man that
[1:19:56] ever walked the face of the Earth so to
[1:19:58] think this morning that the same amount
[1:20:00] of anointing that was flowing through
[1:20:01] him is now flowing through you oh church
[1:20:03] we don't have no shortage of the
[1:20:05] anointing we aren't wanting for the
[1:20:06] anointing but the same amount of
[1:20:08] anointing has now been placed inside of
[1:20:10] you we are living in an overflow of the
[1:20:12] anointing of God we are living in an
[1:20:14] outpouring of the Holy Ghost we are
[1:20:16] living in an age where every devil in

[1:20:55] there is enough word there is enough
[1:20:57] power there is enough Spirit to kill
[1:20:59] every devil to kill every giant to kill
[1:21:01] to stop every enemy that comes against

[1:21:04] morning oh bride now is not the time to
[1:21:06] live under your privileges now is not
[1:21:08] the time to live under the promises that
[1:21:10] God has given to you oh but stand on the
[1:21:13] word stand under the anointing of God
[1:21:15] and take a hold of the anointing take a
[1:21:17] hold of your Victory reach out and grab
[1:21:19] it this morning oh that's as simple as
[1:21:22] it is brother bandam said all you got to
[1:21:23] do is reach out and take it you ain't
[1:21:26] got to go through a 10-step process you
[1:21:28] ain't got to go through some AAA system
[1:21:30] you ain't got to go through some process
[1:21:32] you ain't got to go through some oh
[1:21:34] through some system oh but brother
[1:21:35] bandham said if you just stand on the
[1:21:37] word of God and just reach out and take
[1:21:39] what you have need of oh that's how
[1:21:41] simple as it is oh church if you're in
[1:21:44] bondage tonight you can just reach out
[1:21:45] and take the key to the chains oh if
[1:21:47] you're in trouble tonight you can just
[1:21:49] reach out and take a hold of your
[1:21:50] Victory oh if you're in trouble this
[1:21:52] morning I keep saying tonight y'all
[1:21:53] forgive me I'm used to preaching in
[1:21:54] services oh but this morning anything
[1:21:57] that you have need of all you got to do
[1:21:59] is reach out and take it you were
[1:22:00] anointed to take it you were anointed to
[1:22:02] take your Mountain you were anointed to
[1:22:04] take the land you were anointed to take
[1:22:06] your Victory you were anointed to take
[1:22:08] the enemy you were anointed to Prevail
[1:22:11] over the gates of hell you were anointed
[1:22:13] to
[1:22:14] stand amen Joel 2:23 it will say be glad
[1:22:18] then you children of Zion and rejoice in
[1:22:20] the Lord your God for he ha given you
[1:22:22] the former Reign moderately and he will
[1:22:24] cause to come down for you the rain the
[1:22:26] former rain and the latter rain in the
[1:22:28] first month and the floor shall be full
[1:22:30] of Wheat and the vat shall overflow with
[1:22:32] wine and oil so there'll be overflow of
[1:22:35] wine and an overflow of oil now the
[1:22:37] prophet would expand on this oil and
[1:22:39] wine in the third seal and he would say
[1:22:41] that that oil represented the anointing
[1:22:43] of the holy spirit that oil represented
[1:22:45] the anointing and that that wine
[1:22:47] represented the stimulation
[1:22:48] Revelation knowing the third seal he
[1:22:51] would say the oil and wine in the Bible
[1:22:52] is associated together always he said I
[1:22:55] got the concordance and I look there's a
[1:22:56] string of them like that where the wine
[1:22:58] and the oil goes together all the time
[1:23:00] see when the truth of a promised word of
[1:23:02] God has been truly revealed to his
[1:23:04] saints that is filled with the oil they
[1:23:06] all get stimulated wine is a stimulation
[1:23:09] Glory he said I fill it right now
[1:23:11] stimulated with joy and Shout see and
[1:23:13] when it does it has the same effect upon
[1:23:15] them that wine does upon a natural man
[1:23:18] oh because when the Revelation has been
[1:23:20] given of a truth of God and the True
[1:23:22] Believer filled with the oil and the
[1:23:24] Revel is revealed the stimulation
[1:23:26] becomes so great that it makes him
[1:23:28] behave himself unnormal oh my C why do
[1:23:31] you all act unnormal oh because when a
[1:23:33] revelation is revealed to an anointed
[1:23:36] body it brings simulation it's going to
[1:23:38] bring a little simulation it's going to
[1:23:40] bring a little bit of life it's going to
[1:23:42] bring a little bit of Joy it's going to
[1:23:43] bring a little bit of Praise oh come on
[1:23:45] somebody when I hear this word I get
[1:23:48] stimulated when I hear this message I
[1:23:50] get it a little stimulated because when
[1:23:52] the word is revealed to an anointed body
[1:23:55] I say there is going to be some
[1:23:57] stimulation in the house of God what do
[1:24:00] we do when we heard the revelation of
[1:24:01] the seals we got stimulated what do we
[1:24:03] do when we heard the revelation of the
[1:24:05] church ages we got stimulated what do we
[1:24:07] do when we heard adoption we got
[1:24:10] stimulated oh because when the
[1:24:11] Revelation comes in contact with the
[1:24:14] anointing there is going to be some
[1:24:16] stimulation happening there's going to
[1:24:19] be some life there's going to be some
[1:24:20] worship there's going to be some praise
[1:24:23] oh why you acting like that I can't help
[1:24:25] it act like that the spark of Revelation
[1:24:28] has come in contact with the oil
[1:24:30] anointing oh and I see there is some
[1:24:33] stimulation happening in the Church of
[1:24:35] God oh
[1:24:37] hallelujah oh I know what it means just
[1:24:39] for some extra clarification I looked up
[1:24:42] the definition of the word stimulate all
[1:24:44] right y'all got a minute it's a long
[1:24:46] definition it means to revive to
[1:24:49] rekindle to enlv to Quicken to light up
[1:24:53] to ramp up to fire up to juice up to
[1:24:56] vitalize to invigorate to jumpstart to
[1:25:00] power up to jolt into ignition to
[1:25:02] energize into action okay what happens
[1:25:06] when the anointing comes in contact with
[1:25:08] Revelation I'll tell you what happens it
[1:25:11] brings stimulation you'll get worked up
[1:25:13] you you'll get stimulated you'll get
[1:25:15] revelated you'll get enlivened you'll
[1:25:17] get quickened you'll get invigorated
[1:25:19] you'll get vitalized you'll get amped up
[1:25:22] you'll get powered up you'll get Juiced
[1:25:24] up you'll get energized into action I
[1:25:26] say this morning I ain't looking at a
[1:25:28] dead bride I'm looking at anointed bride
[1:25:31] I'm looking at a said at a stimulated
[1:25:33] bride I'm looking at a revelated bride
[1:25:36] you have been enen you have been
[1:25:37] quickened you have been empowered by the
[1:25:40] Holy Ghost to see Victory oh one of the
[1:25:42] definitions meant to rekindle oh maybe
[1:25:45] your Fire's a little low this morning
[1:25:46] maybe your Flame's gotten a little low
[1:25:48] this morning oh but I can tell you a
[1:25:50] place where there's some good
[1:25:51] oldfashioned Holy Ghost gasoline oh
[1:25:53] where there's some oil anointing oh that
[1:25:55] you can get lit up you can get fired up
[1:25:58] you can get that fire going again oh
[1:26:00] hallelujah oh church I say we are on
[1:26:03] fire this morning there was a church
[1:26:05] that is on fire we ain't dead we ain't
[1:26:08] meant to sit here oh when it Just watch
[1:26:10] and say yes oh yes that sounds good no
[1:26:12] you were meant to live it you w meant to
[1:26:14] take a hold of it you w meant to take it
[1:26:16] inside of here and say I'm going to
[1:26:18] stand I'm going to praise because the
[1:26:21] anointing is here and I am anointed to
[1:26:23] see Victory oh I've watch some fire some
[1:26:27] natural fire makes some people shout
[1:26:28] when it starts to spread I've watch some
[1:26:30] natural fire makes some people dance
[1:26:32] when it gets on the edge of their shoes
[1:26:34] I got to thinking if a natural fire on
[1:26:36] the edge of my shoes can make somebody
[1:26:38] dance oh how much more will the Holy
[1:26:41] Ghost Fire shut up in my bones make a
[1:26:43] Believer dance oh I see we've got a
[1:26:46] reason to Rejoice we've got a reason to
[1:26:48] praise because there an anointing that's
[1:26:50] here in this building this morning and
[1:26:52] you've been anointed by God to overcome
[1:26:55] yes sir oh Hallelujah you were anointed
[1:26:59] to
[1:27:00] overcome oh Caleb you don't understand
[1:27:02] we were on fire last week but the church
[1:27:05] is going through a cold spell right now
[1:27:07] the church is going through a season the
[1:27:08] church is going through something you
[1:27:10] know now listen I understand churches
[1:27:12] are going to go through Seasons it's
[1:27:13] actually a very important thing that
[1:27:15] that we need to accept as the bride is
[1:27:17] that this brother BR said the church is
[1:27:18] going to go through Seasons the church
[1:27:20] is not always going to be in Revival
[1:27:22] brother B said the church is going to go
[1:27:23] through Seasons I know that you're going
[1:27:25] to go through Seasons well brother Caleb
[1:27:27] we're we're battling with some
[1:27:28] indifference in the church right now we
[1:27:30] got some church problems some church
[1:27:31] issues that we're trying to battle with
[1:27:32] I guess the anointing ain't here no more
[1:27:34] I guess the power of God ain't here you
[1:27:36] said Caleb that's silly that's how
[1:27:39] people's minds act so many times it's
[1:27:41] said because we're going through
[1:27:42] something because you're going through a
[1:27:43] season because a Believer is going
[1:27:45] through a season that means the
[1:27:46] anointing ain't there that means the
[1:27:48] power of God ain't there but that's not
[1:27:49] what the prophet said oh the prophet
[1:27:51] went through Seasons brother Bam's
[1:27:52] Church went through Seasons but I'm
[1:27:54] going to want you to listen to what he
[1:27:56] said he said there's something within us
[1:27:58] a fire that is burning a life that has
[1:28:00] been lit by God and no breezes can blow
[1:28:02] it out there's no cold spells in the
[1:28:04] church there's no indifference amongst
[1:28:06] the people there's no persecution of the
[1:28:08] world that can blow out a flame that God
[1:28:11] has lit for it's God's purpose that his
[1:28:13] torched light of Freedom will burn until
[1:28:15] the coming of the Lord and no power can
[1:28:17] blow it out they will only Merk it burn
[1:28:19] brighter as they blow oh Hallelujah it
[1:28:23] will only make is burn brighter as they
[1:28:25] blow oh Satan is trying to blow us out

[1:28:50] we ever have been before Oh and F

[1:29:08] storms oh and to stand and say maybe the
[1:29:11] trials came maybe the storms came oh but

[1:29:16] overcame the situation the anointing
[1:29:19] overcame the circumstance the anointing
[1:29:21] overcame the devil oh Church whatever

[1:29:26] is an anointing that's been placed upon
[1:29:28] you to
[1:29:29] overcome oh Hallelujah they try to blow

[1:29:43] Trials Come When Storms Come when that
[1:29:45] wind starts blowing it just makes that
[1:29:47] flame burn brigher oh whenever that rain
[1:29:49] starts to pour I was reading this story
[1:29:51] here while back where they they had a
[1:29:54] huge fire and there was gasoline going
[1:29:56] everywhere and it started to rain and
[1:29:58] everybody thought oh well it's raining
[1:30:00] the fire's going to go out we a got to
[1:30:01] call the fire trucks we ain't got to
[1:30:02] call nobody and the rain started pouring
[1:30:05] but you know what the storm did they
[1:30:07] said all the rain did was spread that
[1:30:08] gasoline oh and that fire was burning
[1:30:11] brighter than ever before Oh church
[1:30:13] maybe you're going through a storm this
[1:30:14] morning maybe it's raining maybe it's
[1:30:16] storming maybe the wind is blowing oh
[1:30:19] maybe it looks hard oh but I say all
[1:30:21] that that rain is doing is spreading the
[1:30:23] gasoline
[1:30:24] all that rain is doing is making the
[1:30:26] fire burn brighter oh because there is
[1:30:28] an anointing here and no storm can blow
[1:30:30] that anointing away oh no power can blow
[1:30:33] that anointing away no devil can blow
[1:30:35] that anointing away oh I say you are
[1:30:38] made to stand in Victory you are made to
[1:30:40] overcome you are made to stand like a
[1:30:43] house built upon a rock and say I have a
[1:30:45] firm foundation I'm standing on this

[1:39:29] dwell in that anointing and you know
[1:39:31] like we were talking about while ago he
[1:39:32] would talk about the anointing being the
[1:39:34] supreme power in control he would say
[1:39:36] you know God would give the supreme
[1:39:38] power to the body of Christ through that
[1:39:40] anointing that would Channel
[1:39:41] it I say this tonight this this morning

[1:39:56] the hardest ways to fight sometimes is

[1:40:20] over your life the anointing is in
[1:40:22] perfect control
[1:40:24] oh my there's power in knowing who you
[1:40:26] are knowing that you are anointed
[1:40:28] knowing that you ain't got to stand in
[1:40:29] worry you ain't got to stand in
[1:40:31] nervousness you ain't got to stand there
[1:40:33] in anxiety wondering if you're going to
[1:40:34] overcome wonder if you're going to make
[1:40:36] it through another day wondering if
[1:40:37] you're going to come through this you
[1:40:38] ain't got to worry about that because
[1:40:40] you know that you were anointed the
[1:40:42] prophet of God would say time and time
[1:40:44] again that David knew he was anointed in
[1:40:46] one place he said David knew he was
[1:40:48] anointed he was Vindicated to be a good
[1:40:49] shot he know that they know that he was
[1:40:51] a good shot David wasn't anointed and he
[1:40:54] knowed it in another place David know
[1:40:56] the anointing oil was on him and it
[1:40:58] didn't make any difference he said the
[1:41:00] Philistine will be like the bear in The
[1:41:01] Lion so here I come another place he
[1:41:03] knowed where he was standing he was a
[1:41:05] man of Faith he believed that God was in
[1:41:07] him he knew he was anointed Church
[1:41:10] there's power knowing you were anointed
[1:41:12] David didn't win because he was strong
[1:41:14] David didn't win because he was educated
[1:41:16] David didn't win because he knew how to
[1:41:17] aim because he knew how to throw David
[1:41:19] didn't win because he had a strong arm
[1:41:21] oh but David saw Victory because knew he
[1:41:23] was anointed David overcame because he
[1:41:25] knew that he was anointed the prophet of
[1:41:27] God said when you recognize who you are
[1:41:30] when you recognize that anointing you
[1:41:31] will be an invincible Army oh no devil
[1:41:34] in hell will be able to stand against
[1:41:35] you no devil in hell will be able to
[1:41:37] stop you whenever you can come and you
[1:41:39] can get the revelation of who you are
[1:41:42] amen David was anointed he knew he was
[1:41:44] anointed he knew his position he knew he
[1:41:46] had found favor David he God himself
[1:41:49] said David is a man after my own heart
[1:41:51] brother bam said that David was anointed
[1:41:53] to portray Christ David was you know
[1:41:55] when you think about the anointed in the
[1:41:57] Old Testament many times you think of
[1:41:59] David David was very very anointed he
[1:42:01] was placed into that anointing and now
[1:42:03] we want to skip ahead 300 years we're
[1:42:06] going to skip ahead five
[1:42:08] generations and you look over in 2 Kings
[1:42:11] 19 we ain't got to go through and read
[1:42:13] it all but if you're reading this story
[1:42:14] here we are 300 years after David's left
[1:42:17] the scene five generations after David
[1:42:18] had left the scene and now Assyria has
[1:42:21] come up against Judah and King
[1:42:22] Jehosaphat was a Godly King and he went
[1:42:24] to the prophet of God and he said ask
[1:42:26] what we should do and now in in Second
[1:42:28] Kings this was the Lord's response he
[1:42:30] said I will give you victory for my
[1:42:33] servant David's sake for my servant
[1:42:35] David's sake I will give you Victory and
[1:42:37] the Bible says that night the spirit of
[1:42:39] the Lord which the prophet said was the
[1:42:41] anointing went out and killed
[1:42:43] 185,000 Assyrians that night 185,000
[1:42:47] Assyrians and you know I got a thinking
[1:42:50] about that if a 300y old anointing if a
[1:42:54] five generation old anointing oh have
[1:42:57] been been placed upon David after 300
[1:42:59] years that that anointing has so much
[1:43:02] power and so much Authority after 300
[1:43:04] years years that it could kill
[1:43:07] 185,000 Devils oh what about a fresh
[1:43:10] anointing that's been placed upon this
[1:43:12] bride what about a fresh anointing
[1:43:14] that's been placed upon the Bride of
[1:43:15] Jesus Christ oh I say there ain't no
[1:43:17] limit to what you can do there ain't no
[1:43:20] limit to how you can overcome there
[1:43:22] ain't no limit to how how much you can
[1:43:23] see Victory oh church I say I ain't
[1:43:26] using Granddaddy's anointing I ain't
[1:43:28] using Daddy's anointing I ain't using
[1:43:30] that anointing oh it was just for people
[1:43:31] in this Bible oh but I have been given a
[1:43:34] fresh anointing of the word and I say of
[1:43:37] an anointing given to great great great
[1:43:39] granddaddy David could kill
[1:43:41] 185,000 then I ain't got to worry about
[1:43:44] anything that I'm going through because
[1:43:46] I know that there was an anointing that
[1:43:48] was in this building this morning and
[1:43:50] that anointing will overcome that
[1:43:53] anointing will carry me through it that
[1:43:55] anointing will take a hold over every
[1:43:57] devil that anointing will go out in the
[1:43:59] night and when morning comes Israel do
[1:44:02] the spoil there is a dead army laying
[1:44:05] outside your Gates because there is an
[1:44:07] anointing that fought for you there's an
[1:44:09] anointing that stood for you oh I love
[1:44:12] how the Bible said it he said that the
[1:44:14] anointing went out that night and then
[1:44:16] they arose in the morning oh I imagine
[1:44:18] King Jehoshaphat slept very good that
[1:44:20] night oh I imagine last couple months he
[1:44:23] ain't got no
[1:44:24] sleep oh he knows this arm is coming he
[1:44:27] can't sleep tossing and turning the
[1:44:29] arm's here he's tossing and turning the
[1:44:31] arm is preparing for battle he's tossing
[1:44:33] and turning oh but this night he laid
[1:44:35] his head down oh to the sound of his
[1:44:37] enemies crying for help he went to the
[1:44:39] sound of the anointing slaughtering the
[1:44:42] enemy that come before him oh I say
[1:44:44] church maybe you're going through the
[1:44:46] dark of night maybe you're going through
[1:44:48] a dark time through a dark period oh but
[1:44:50] I just want to give you some
[1:44:51] encouragement this morning and say
[1:44:53] morning is coming I say morning is
[1:44:56] coming and the anointing is going to
[1:44:58] kill every enemy that's come up against
[1:45:00] you the anointing is going to slay that
[1:45:02] enemy the anointing is going to slay
[1:45:04] that Army the anointing is going to
[1:45:06] fight for you the anointing is going to
[1:45:08] stand for you oh Church there is an
[1:45:10] anointing that's been placed upon this
[1:45:13] bride oh you can overcome you can say
[1:45:15] you ain't got to worry about it the
[1:45:17] anointing killed 185,000 Devils all
[1:45:21] because a great great great grandpa was
[1:45:23] anointed oh what about you what does God
[1:45:26] think about you he has placed a fresh
[1:45:28] anointing upon this bride oh and I ain't
[1:45:31] got to worry about what Grandpa did I
[1:45:33] ain't got to worry about what Dad did oh
[1:45:35] but I know that I am anointed I know
[1:45:38] that I am filled with the Holy Ghost I
[1:45:40] know that I am a member of the Bride
[1:45:42] body of Jesus Christ and I know that I
[1:45:45] was anointed to see
[1:45:48] Victory
[1:45:49] amen going back to the scripture we
[1:45:51] begin with is
[1:45:53] 10:24 therefore thus sayith the Lord God
[1:45:56] of hosts oh my people that dwelleth in
[1:46:00] Zion be not afraid of the Assyrian he
[1:46:03] shall smite thee with the rod he shall
[1:46:05] lift up a staff against thee after the
[1:46:06] manner of Egypt for he had a very little
[1:46:09] while and the indignation shall cease
[1:46:11] and mine anger in their destruction and
[1:46:13] the Lord of H host shall stir up a
[1:46:15] Scourge for him according to the
[1:46:17] slaughter of Midian at the rock of
[1:46:20] orb according to the slaughter of Midian
[1:46:22] at the rock of orb sometimes when the
[1:46:23] anointing comes to fight your battle it
[1:46:25] gets a little bit messy oh but the
[1:46:28] slaughter of midan the rock of orb now
[1:46:29] this story is referring to Gideon when
[1:46:32] 300 soldiers killed 185,000 midianites
[1:46:36] and during this battle these 300 men
[1:46:38] completely destroyed this Army of Midian
[1:46:40] and so because of it the general of this
[1:46:41] Army runs and he hides in the rock of
[1:46:44] Orab he runs and he tries to hide from
[1:46:46] this Army he tries to hide and he goes
[1:46:48] to get away oh but I want to just make a
[1:46:50] declaration to that devil this morning
[1:46:51] oh when the anointing is after you there
[1:46:53] ain't nowhere you can run to get away
[1:46:55] from it oh when the anointing is
[1:46:57] fighting for you when the anointing is
[1:46:59] against you there ain't no rock you can
[1:47:01] shelter in there ain't no Fortress that
[1:47:03] can hold you there ain't no but building
[1:47:05] that will hold you there ain't no Rock
[1:47:07] that'll hold you there ain't no place
[1:47:08] that'll hold you when the anointing is
[1:47:11] against you oh because not only did the
[1:47:13] anointing kill Orab not only did that
[1:47:15] anointing kill that man oh but he named
[1:47:18] that rock after the man that was killed
[1:47:20] there he named that rock the rock of
[1:47:22] Orab because the anointing slew Orab
[1:47:25] right there at that rock oh I say this
[1:47:28] morning and now 300 years later we see
[1:47:31] Isaiah is talking to the prophet oh and
[1:47:33] he said don't worry I want you to look
[1:47:36] back to the rock of Orab I want you to
[1:47:38] look back at the memorial that I made
[1:47:40] for your people I want you to look back
[1:47:43] that the rock of Orab oh where a man
[1:47:45] said the anointing wasn't enough and I
[1:47:47] showed him that the anointing wasn't
[1:47:49] enough where a man said the anointing
[1:47:51] can't protect this people oh but I
[1:47:53] showed him that the anointing can
[1:47:55] protect this group of people oh I say
[1:47:58] not only did the anointing kill your
[1:48:00] devil but he said I'm going to make a
[1:48:02] memorial I'm going to name a rock after
[1:48:04] your devil oh this morning if you're
[1:48:06] going through something why don't you
[1:48:08] just turn around and look back to the
[1:48:10] Rock I say look to the rock of Orab look
[1:48:13] to the rock of depression without enemy
[1:48:15] try to get you but the anointing said no
[1:48:18] look back to the rock of complexes where
[1:48:21] they tried to kill you but the anointing
[1:48:22] said no look back to the rock of suicide
[1:48:25] without that enemy tried to kill you oh
[1:48:27] but the anointing said No I say that he
[1:48:30] not only killed your devil he made an
[1:48:33] example of your devil he made a memorial
[1:48:36] of your devil oh church you can turn
[1:48:38] around tonight oh and just look back at
[1:48:41] where he brought you from just look back
[1:48:43] at what the anointing has carried you
[1:48:45] through oh just look back at the rock of
[1:48:47] Orab look back at the Rock oh I have so
[1:48:51] many rocks now look back oh I can't even
[1:48:53] see my past there's so many rocks I
[1:48:56] can't even see where I was because there
[1:48:58] are so many rocks I can't even see what
[1:49:00] I used to go through because there are
[1:49:02] so many rocks that every time I came
[1:49:04] against something the anointing killed
[1:49:07] that devil the anointing overcame the
[1:49:09] anointing by Victory oh I say maybe you
[1:49:12] should drive a take down tonight or
[1:49:14] drive a take down this morning and say
[1:49:16] devil you battle me long enough or with
[1:49:18] the anointing is here the anointing is
[1:49:20] in this building and the anointing is
[1:49:22] going to
[1:49:24] overcome oh Hallelujah I'm going to make
[1:49:27] this rock a
[1:49:29] memorial oh fear not bride look to the
[1:49:32] rock look to the Rock I love I was
[1:49:35] looking at what I was doing some
[1:49:36] research on this and there was a a a
[1:49:40] Biblical
[1:49:41] historian who wrote on this rock of orb
[1:49:43] a little bit and I love this excerpt
[1:49:45] that he said he said orb fell at a rock
[1:49:48] which became known afterwards as the
[1:49:50] rock of Orab this incident not only
[1:49:52] marked a Victorious turning point for
[1:49:54] the Israelites but it also devastatingly
[1:49:57] impacted the midianite influence in the
[1:49:59] region to the point where this is the
[1:50:01] last time in history where Midian was
[1:50:04] ever a threat to the nation of Israel oh
[1:50:07] Hallelujah you know what that means that
[1:50:09] means whenever the midianites try to
[1:50:10] come back in Israelites said hey hang on
[1:50:13] a minute why don't you go look at the
[1:50:14] rock of Orab before you make any rash
[1:50:16] decisions devil why don't you just go
[1:50:18] back to the memorial oh before you
[1:50:20] decide you want to march on God's people
[1:50:22] why don't you just go back to the rock
[1:50:24] of Orab oh why don't you just go make
[1:50:26] sure that you really want to die again
[1:50:28] why don't you just make sure you really
[1:50:30] want to be defeated again oh because if
[1:50:33] my god did it once I say my God's going
[1:50:35] to do it again if the anointing overcame
[1:50:37] once the anointing is going to overcome
[1:50:39] again my God is the same yesterday today
[1:50:42] and forever and if he overcame for one
[1:50:44] person he can do it for me if he
[1:50:46] overcame for you he can overcome for
[1:50:48] somebody else I say the anointing is
[1:50:51] here this morning to bring you you
[1:50:52] Victory the anointing is here this
[1:50:54] morning to make a memorial of the devil
[1:50:57] that you're battling the anointing is
[1:50:59] here oh don't pass by this anointing the
[1:51:02] anointing is here to carry you the
[1:51:04] anointing is here to fight for you oh
[1:51:06] you were made for this anointing you
[1:51:08] were made for this message God don't put
[1:51:10] people in this message oh that weren't
[1:51:12] made for this message oh but you were
[1:51:14] anointed you were predestinated you were
[1:51:17] for ordained oh to be a part of this
[1:51:19] message I say you were made for it yeah
[1:51:23] brother Brenham would tell a story about
[1:51:24] that duck in the chicken yard he would
[1:51:26] say that that duck was born there that
[1:51:28] that farmer laid that dug under that
[1:51:29] chicken and it created the right
[1:51:31] atmosphere where he could be born and
[1:51:32] that duck was raised there in that
[1:51:34] chicken
[1:51:35] yard and you know he went about his life
[1:51:37] trying his best to be a chicken oh but I
[1:51:39] love how the prophet said it he said the
[1:51:40] only problem he said was that chicken
[1:51:42] yard was dry and he said that duck was
[1:51:44] made for water that do was made for
[1:51:47] water and the prophet tells that story
[1:51:49] he's one day he's walking around that
[1:51:51] chicken yard oh he said all that it took
[1:51:53] was that duck to get one whiff of that
[1:51:56] pond all it took that duck was to get
[1:51:58] one just little one little sniff one
[1:52:00] little smell of that water all it took
[1:52:02] was one experience all it took was one
[1:52:04] exposure and the brother the prophet of
[1:52:06] God said he flew over that fence he
[1:52:08] spread his wings and he flew down to
[1:52:10] that water and he began to jump into
[1:52:12] that water and say I was made for this

[1:52:17] was made for this message I was made to
