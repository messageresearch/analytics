up my soul [Music] feed me till I was no more here is my cup [Music] fill it up and make me [Music] oh fill my cup Lord [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] fill our cups and we certainly know he wants to do it he's able to do it and I just believe that you won't leave disappointed he's just that type of God that um answers our prayer amen and he is is he knows what you're asking before you even asking and we certainly love the Lord and I trust everyone had a good day today as uh dreary wet but you know it was just a good day good to be alive to ask brother Roy Shrewsbury we went up there a lot and visited with him and asked well you doing doing good today and he says that my age any day above ground's a good day amen well I guess we could all say that amen so I'm above ground amen but if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the Book of Psalms thee 23rd chapter praise the Lord Psalms the 23rd chapter and just good to be a Christian and before we read maybe we can just pray and ask the Lord for His blessings his help here tonight father as we just humble our hearts before you Lord we're just uh vessels Lord for you to use and if you don't use this Lord and we're nothing we're just Lord we're just in vain the services in vain the preachings in vain if if you don't have preeminence and father we're just asking Lord that you would come and just take over our vessels God and anoint the gift that you placed within me Father anoint these lips of clay father and anoint the the people father their ears to hear their hearts to receive and father when we leave this place we will know that we've been with you father and that's our desire is to commune with you and you talk with us Lord as the songs have been sung worship has gone forth and we pray Lord that it was uh a special in your your sight father pleasing Lord that you would feel at home that the atmosphere would have been created father that you could just move Among Us Lord that's our desire Bless the people for they've come and hear tonight Lord and we just ask it in your lovely name Jesus Christ and the church says amen amen now if you look at Psalms the 23rd chapter and it says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul elitists me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake amen you can have your seats tonight and um I'm going to continue just with this thought on the Lord is my shepherd and and we have been dealing uh for some time now in the third verse he restoreth my soul and um but I uh looking at this and I may not get all the way into it tonight but I'm going to just kind of go back into some areas but this last part of this verse David said he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his namesake now I believe that um David shows us in the preceding verses as to how we come to this point he leads me in the paths of righteousness and as we've talked about the first chapter he or first verse he he starts out with the Lord is my shepherd and um so uh as David would put it he's not a Shepherd but he is mine he's personally mine and I I think that's a something that we we must acknowledge we must have a revelation of that the Lord is my shepherd personally to me and for him to be my shepherd means that I am his sheep ain't that rhyme you know brother Brown said Jesus has nothing but Sheep amen so it's all sheep that are his and so he knows his sheep and his sheep know him it's it's something that is a relationship and of course we I am made his sheep you are made his sheep uh by having his nature uh within us that gives us a sheep like nature ain't that right and so this tells a lot of who I am it tells a lot of who you are as as sheep sheep cannot be driven they must be led so ever all the relationship with Christ is not that he drives you to it but he leads you to it every every part of this is is is us being led now so whereas a goat cannot be led now he can lead but he cannot be led himself and so uh uh we find that the devil does exactly what the goat does you know uh uh you know brother Brown talking about you know the the goat he said he will lead God's sheep right up to the slaughter and then he steps out out of side he said that's right so be careful what's leading you ain't that right and and so you know we've seen it's it's and I'm sure you have too or you've seen uh guys you know come in church and start being you know uh uh putting on this Christian uh act and and all of these things and when's the affection of a young lady and uh you know and before you know it he's got her out the church and and uh what when and and and what's sad about it is is after he's got the girl totally messed up and and all these things he leaves her for another girl and and you know and here she's left in shambles or life is broken into pieces and you know you you look at it and that's exactly what the devil does he'll bring someone in a church just to uh uh set under the disguise of it all and become you know as the prophet said just sit sit there and and win the affection of the people and and all these things and before you know it Satan will shoot that guy with the poison dart and and and before you know it he's he's uh you know the many people in the church get caught up in the excitement and and they're left mad they're bitter they're struggling in their walk as as as Christians and and they pull off to themselves instead of joining up with the Brotherhood and and and the guy that started it all he's already gone and moved on you know and that's that's that's that goat that's that goat nature amen and and brother Branham says you know it's hard to tell the difference between professed Christians and genuine real Christians ain't that right he says the goat represents the world they'll lead you right down the wrong road to your Eternal separation from God they'll they'll lead you into trouble so if we are sheep we better watch what kind of Shepherd we've got ain't that right and and he goes on and talks of how that the Cry of the goat sounds exactly a uh like a sheep and he says the the goat will cry exactly like a sheep he's a little let a little old Billy Goat get hung up out there somewhere and a little sheep on one side going bad you know and then bad just the same see he says I've heard them down at the altar just to cry and crying oh God sobbing away like that and and oh God and a goat all the time see so he says you better he said you better be a Shepherd if you want to know the difference ain't that right so a Shepherd is the one that knows the difference and and I'm glad that God is our Shepherd Jesus Christ is the Shepherd Of Our Lives he knows the difference ain't that right and and so he he knows the Bible says he knows his own uh the foundation of God stand to sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his ain't that right so so there is a bond there is a relationship so so so the Lord doesn't know who you are tonight he knows exactly who you are and as sheep you've got to trust that he's leading you and and you say but I I don't see where where where where you know I just you know how did I get here well the Lord's LED you there amen and I just believe that do you believe that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord so we we find that the Sheep are led by the voice of their Shepherd and and of course you know the the the the voice of Our Shepherd today is the Vindicated word for for this hour for this day amen and and his voice has been clearly identified by Malachi 4. you believe that amen uh so we don't wonder who the voice of God is it's it's it's it's made clear to us it's the Vindicated voice word of God for this age amen and and a true Vindicated Prophet has thus saith the Lord do you believe that now I know a lot of folks are saying thus saith the Lord but but but I I I and and and a lot of confusion that goes on uh uh in the world today and and even in the message ranks and and all of this but but I'm telling you the people of God should not be confused a man about what to listen to and what voice to listen to I I don't care if they say the god of Heaven and Earth came down to visit them in a form of an Angel if it's against what the Bible what the prophet of God Vindicated Prophet has said then then it's not the voice of God see because any other voice is the voice of a stranger now we've already got a promise and it's a comfort to us that Jesus would say that that they they they will follow not the voice of a stranger a stranger they will not follow ain't that right and and and and I I tell you what uh uh if there's ever a time that you young people us Elders uh preachers me your pastor we we got to get solid stable uh uh parents deacons uh trustee everybody y'all it's stable I'm not saying you're not but I'm telling you we've got to get more stable get so stable in this message that that when the the when the things begin to come and the winds begin to blow and and you're going to find people falling left and right and so much again so much confusion left and right but if you'll hear the voice of your Shepherd hey can you say man Vindicated word amen then you'll sell right through it amen that's right now we we find that the Sheep cannot lead themselves they are so dependent upon their Shepherd amen because they do not have an independent nature amen their nature is to depend a man up on a Shepherd even when they get lost as we said brother Branham tells us that they they will just they they will just sit there you know instead of trying to find their way back they'll get there and and stand there and and just bleep bad bad bad bad and and and they're defenseless against anything they'll never be able to find their way back it takes the shepherd and and and the shepherd knows his own and he loves his sheep that he will leave the 99 in the foal to go after that one sheep ain't that right because he knows without his help that sheep is going to perish and it would be a disgrace if the shepherd loses his sheep ain't that right but God says you'll not I'll not lose you all that the father hath given me I will not lose a one aren't you glad for that and that's why we're here tonight because he ain't lost you yet and he will no he won't lost you lose you so we find that there is a bond between the shepherd and the sheep and so the shepherd isn't going to leave his sheep and the Sheep isn't going to leave the shepherd amen now we remember you you know about the little lamb you know he's young and dumb and and all these things and and he he might leave that Shepherd a little bit and the shepherd keeps bringing him back bring him back but one day that Shepherd says you know the Sheep's got to learn a lesson here and he'll take that rod and he'll break that leg of that Sheep amen and it looks mean and but we would call it like a prophet would call it the tender hand of Jehovah the tender hand of of a shepherd and he will bind or take that sheep bind that leg up and all of these things and nurse that little sheep back then he holds that sheep and Carries that she talks to that sheep and when he when that sheep heals that leg heals that sheep just stays right with that Shepherd never leaves again ain't that right I don't know about you but I've I've had my leg broke a little bit and and and and I just don't want to leave the shepherd amen I I love I love the voice of the shepherd amen do you love God voice of the shepherd amen I don't understand why people just want to go away from this message I just don't amen maybe they're goats I don't know but anyways you know uh uh but I tell you uh uh we know where David's loyalty was and any other sheep a man for he said the Lord is my shepherd there's a lot of things that we could go on for for for a long time on just that thought the Lord is my shepherd but he's he's saying it without saying it in other words my my pledge is to him my loyalty is to him again there in 60 Psalm 63 8 David Cries Out My Soul followed with hard after thee so we know he's a real sheep ain't that right he's not just one that professes to be sheep he's a real sheep because his soul is following hard after him I've thought of even Psalms 5 and 1 give ear to my words O Lord consider my meditation hearken unto the voice of my cry my king and my God for unto thee will I pray my voice shalt thou hear in the morning O Lord in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee and we'll look up ain't that right amen that's a true sheep see amen uh in in Isaiah 26 and 8 it says yea in the way of thy judgments O Lord have we waited for thee the desire of us of our soul is to thy name and to the remembrance of of thee with My Soul have I desired thee in the night and Yea with my spirit Within Me will I seek thee early so there's an attachment when it comes to Sheep amen to to the Lord be their Shepherd they're such an attachment that nothing can steer them away Temptations and the trials and and all of that but down in the heart of a sheep a man it's beating God I need you oh God I I love you can you say Amen so we we find then David says our shepherd He leads me in the Green Pastures and and of course as we said the Green Pastures is where our food supply is and we feed there which the is is the open book the the the the full Revelation the the true interpretation is what every sheep is of God is feeding off of in this age and it's where we're strings and it's where that we are sustained amen and I think what the prophet said we do he have to Day by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication ain't that right so so our Shepherd has led us into Green Pastures because why would he do that because he cares for us a man he doesn't want you so just uh skinny sheep so to speak and and barely making it in Weak sheep and just staggering along just you know just faint-hearted oh no he's going to give you the best kind of food that will sustain you ain't that right amen now I want to say this about these Green Pastures and we see we don't need uh uh another uh translation of the Bible to eat in these Green Pastures see different translations don't help us to understand better God's Divine word amen and and now don't get me wrong I ain't rebuking no one here tonight because we do know what brother Brandon said about uh you know and and I I use them uh uh Vines I use the uh dye glot and and uh we we use them things brother Terry is studying and things but but I'm I'm talking about we've got so many translations today that and people are looking for better understanding of the word and I will tell you this that that even if I if I read the uh any kind of a translation maybe to get a word or whatever I always go back to what a prophet said about it amen before I put an interpretation to it ain't that right amen but see they think that the world thinks that if if I if I can get it down better in in translations then I I can understand God better and and that's not true amen and and you can read this yes um that brother Branham talks about these things of how that most Bible students believe that the New Testament was originally in the Greek language and and he says our our Greek Scholars today say that the Greek language of the Bible days is so perfect and exact that is the student of the Greek is refined and and uh is a re as is a refined and accurate grammarin uh that he can truly know exactly what the New Testament teaches so so that they're saying that it's the Greek you you got to know the Greek and anyone that's really uh uh trained in that Greek that that can can know all the ins and outs of Greek then he's the one that can better understand uh what the Bible says you understand and so uh but yet the prophet would say but every Greek scholar of reputation from one one denomination baits another debates another student of another denomination and their arguments are based on identical Greek words and identical rules of grammar see so so we find that that even history talks about or tells us that of of two two Greek uh students that got in a debate and it was such a it was at the Nicene Council in in that time and and and and and such was the debate In the Heat of debate that had spread worldwide of that of that time and and it became a worldwide debate and and so and and the prophet says that that that the world the intents of this debate that the world was divided over it was over a a a diphthong if I could say it that right and and he says that the diphthong is the sound of two vowels in a single syllable ball so they're they're they divided the whole world divided over one one word diphthong over a two-syllable uh uh uh two vowels and a single syllable that's just the debate of you you see how Petty the debates are a man see and and so the the prophet asked if the Greek is so perfect and so ordained of God then why was there a dispute in the first place see so so God did not intend for all of us to know Greek Amen in in in all of the uh you know uh these things so today you know we've got uh uh uh one Greek uh philosopher you know cannot persuade the the other Greek philosophers to to believe his interpretation of the Greek and and every Greek student has their own learned version of what the Greek means and and that's just the same way you just get one Bible and everybody's going to debate on the Bible it it it it's it's just that way ain't that right so how can you feed off of confusion uh uh and and questions in in all of these things see and and so then you you have that that there there are learned men who claim that the original manuscripts of the Bible were were written in aramic I I believe that's how you would say that in the rainiac language which was the language that Jesus and and the the rest of the people used of his day see and and so they claim that the people uh did not speak and write in the Greek as is so commonly believed today and and the prophet would tell us that even our historians are divided on that amen so so uh you know trying to get to accuracy of things uh one Professor has proven to his satisfaction through research that the New Testament was written in vernacular uh in the vernacular of the Greek speaking people of that day on the other hand amen Dr Lanza uh I guess that's his name lamsa lamsa was convinced that the New Testament was written in the aramic and so brother Branham says if you read the King James version of the Bible and compare it to the translation by Dr lamsa you you will find that there is no difference in the content or doctrine see so brother Branham goes on to say that God has allowed these newly discovered manuscripts and recent publications of already known scripts to come before us to prove the authenticity of what we've already got can you say man and we find that through trans that though translation leaders May fight each other the scriptures do not ain't that right so so there there is a truth to this and even though all the trans translators are debating over this right here and they're trying to make it plainer and plainer and plainer to us to where we can understand yet there is a truth that is laying right here and has been laying here all along do you believe that amen and that's where the Green Pastures are a man see so we we see that a man cannot base his interpretation upon students profound knowledge of the language the Bible is written in and and if if and brother Brown says if you cannot see that then you're veiled in your mind by Traditions ain't that right because the the Sadducees the scribes and and and the Pharisees and all the writers and the great Scholars uh there uh uh uh in Jesus's day knew the exact meaning of the word in which the Old Testament It Was Written these people were well skilled they were Scholars and not just in memorization but in what language the Bible was written in they they knew all the ins and outs about it the periods and the dots and the commas and the ands and the conjunctions and and and and and and so well versed in the Scrolls that it is said that they could roll up a scroll point and push a needle through it amen and tell you the words that that need a went through they were so well versed in this in the Bible in the Scrolls ain't that right amen but the prophet says but even though they had a superb knowledge they missed the revelation of God's promised word manifested in the sun ain't that right you see Jesus was the main theme throughout the the Old Testament from Genesis to to Malachi he was the main theme and yet their their education of the Bible their knowledge of the grammar everything about it and and the pronunciations and and and all of these things could not reveal to them what was hidden in the book can you say man so when Jesus came to manifest a man what the word actually said with all of that Grammar with all of that schooling with all of that knowledge and education they could not see him in the Bible ain't that right so brother Brown says as much as we believe in trying to find the oldest and the best manuscripts to get the best record of the word possible we will never get the true meaning of it by study and comparison of scriptures sincere as we may be it will take a revelation from God to bring it out can you say man so David when he's saying he leads me in these Green Pastures he's not saying it's because I know amen the grammar of it and I know all the pronunciations and and I can just say it out to you that way it wasn't that it had been a revelation that had come to him and he was eaten in the Green Pastures can you say man amen we got Bibles everywhere and yet more trouble more confusion more uh chaos than we've ever had before can you say man that's even even you you understand we had a Bible that was given to us years before a Prophet come and I know these these scoffers and these critics tell us well you need to get back to the Bible you don't message people they don't know their Bible I gotta beg to differ with you I know it more amen the bride knows it more than the than the scholars of the day and and and the commentators and all of that why because the true interpretation has come to this Bride Can you say Amen they could knock the the scholars of this Bible could not put us in the Green Pastures amen the theologians of this Bible the Seminary could not put us in the Green Pastures that God would send his voice through a prophet and would reveal and take what was between the lines and reveal it to his people and I say to you he has led us into Green Pastures now this is exactly what Paul said in First Corinthians 2 and 13. which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth and so brother Branham says that the true Revelation is God interpreting his own word by vindicating what is promised so yet you understand the true revelation if you want the true Revelation it's God interpreting his own word by vindicating what he has promised Scholars don't even know that God is fulfilling his word today they're taking us all the way back to a baby in a manger and they're taking us all the way forward to to whatever uh they they uh have imagined in the future and all this time God is doing something right under their nose and very few people know what he's doing but to us it's Green Pastures can you say man I just want to make that clear to you the Revelation is the Green Pastures that we that he Our Shepherd has led us in it's our food ain't that right so we believe that the Bible is accurate amen not because of what man has been able to do but we've seen it we've seen God interpret his own word ain't that right amen see so Jesus completely authenticated the Old Testament when he walked the Earth and and it was compiled exactly as the New Testament uh uh yes see so we we have the infallible word of God today and no man dares to add to it or take from it ain't that right but brother Branham says we need everybody say we need we need the same spirit that gave it to uh that gave it to teach it to us we need the same spirit that inspired them into right can you say amen and I'm going to be honest he didn't Inspire I don't know and and I'm not here for debate but I don't believe that he inspired uh or he may have but but I'm not going to focus on that as that is inspired the translators you understand what I'm saying but what was inspired is these men that wrote the Bible can you say man if if Moses told us what happened in in the Garden of Eden that was what was inspired now the translator can say what he wants in in all of these and he's tried his best to get it right amen but but what what we're needing in this hour is not a translator to reveal it to us amen and and some will to do guy that could that could take the scriptures and unfold it to us even even you know uh even Paul said though I understand all Mysteries and yet not have charity I'm nothing can you say man so so there is an element of truth that has been laying there as a mystery amen but it takes the holy spirit amen to reveal it to us we don't need Paul in our day to reveal it to us can you say amen and I'm going to tell you even this that that that that that we don't need brother Bradham to come back amen and get it down into our minds we've already got the tapes and yet there will be people that'll listen to them tapes and still miss what's happened we need the spirit of God to come and reveal what the prophet said amen we need Revelation by the spirit we don't need a new Bible the prophet said we don't need a new translation though some are good he says I'm not against them but we need the revelation of the spirit can you say amen he said see and we can have what we need for God wants to reveal his word to us by his spirit ain't that right I thank God for the translators aren't you I I thank God for for uh King James that's why we call it King James there's actually King James uh that that had different men uh uh uh take take the Scrolls or take whatever they they had and he wanted to make it known him but yet he wanted to be so accurate the best he could make it uh accuracy so he had different men take the Bible separate and and and and interpret it write it all down amen and it found out that then he came up with the best translations ain't that right but even then we find brother Branham even as a prophet correcting some of the translation even in King James ain't that right so so so again we need the spirit of God Amen and and so we we find that God isn't given us a greater understanding by giving us other translations of the Bible ain't that right amen he gives us understanding Revelation by his spirit amen and brother Branham said may God Begin by his Spirit to give us continuous life-giving and prevailing revelation that's what we need ain't that right so we find when we get a fresh Revelation and become the Living Word manifested by it then Prophet said we'll do the Greater Works and glorify God our Father in heaven when we get a fresh Revelation see what what has come in this age amen a revelation and become the Living Word manifested by that Revelation amen then we'll do the Greater Works and glorify God our Father ain't that right so it's in these Green Pastures in this open book in that Revelation that God has given this perfect interpretation by Divine Vindication is where we're made to rest at but then notice David said he leads me beside the Still Waters now we we we know we realize that the Green Pastures and and water speaks of life Still Waters signify rest peace quietness ain't that right water what does water represent the Holy Spirit ain't that right but notice David said Still Waters plural now I I'm personally looking at this and I I can't help but believe that it has a connection with Psalms 1. one and and three where David talks about the rivers of water and here in our scripture reading uh uh and and I won't keep you much longer but I want you to keep in mind what we're saying and and we'll go more into it Wednesday of of this the last third verse but next Wednesday the Lord willing but here in our scripture reading David Likens us as being sheep who are led to the waters in Psalms 1 3 David Likens us as a tree that is uh uh uh being planted uh uh by the rivers of water ain't that right now brother Branham identifies these Rivers as being nine different Springs coming from the same water supply so these rivers or Springs are the nine spiritual gifts that God placed within the body of Christ and notice they are flowing from the water Waters flowing from water ain't that right nine Rivers flowing from the same source of water ain't that right and the prophet says and that water is The Rock see that water came from from a rock ain't that right and that rock is Christ hey ain't that right now so it's the smitten Rock they're flowing from the smitten Rock which is Jesus Christ amen now I'm going to read a scripture Isaiah 32 and 1. where he says Behold a king shall reign in righteousness and princes shall rule in judgment and a man speaking of Christ Jesus a man shall be as in hiding place from the wind and a covert from the tempt us as rivers of water and a dry place as the shadow of a great rock in a dreary or in a weary land ain't that right so so a man shall be as Waters a man uh uh flowing in the desert uh so we we find that that rock in the wilderness was a type of Christ amen but then that rock become flesh amen become a man and dwelt Among Us ain't that right amen and notice notice because Jesus amen now here is that rock uh the uh uh in flesh amen and he went to the woman at the well and he told her whosoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life ain't that right so here he is offering water to her she was going to get water from the well and he says but if you'll look at and and ask of me to drink if you only knew the gift of God you would ask of him for a drink ain't that right and then he looks at and says but I will give you them Waters and and and and if you drink from these Waters you'll never ever never searched again and she needed a drink didn't she amen her life was internal her life was in sin it was messed up to where the church rejected her Society rejected her that he's offering her water oh my amen and and what happened amen she performed he performed the Messiah sign to her ain't that right that's right and she knew right then what he was talking about amen when he performed the Messiah sign and she could recognize that he was more than just a man flirting with her amen he wasn't just a man that wanted uh some business with her but he literally was the Messiah that could give her a drink can you say man oh then she began to ask oh give me the drink Hallelujah brother Branham said see she had seen it perfectly Vindicated amen that he was that Fountain of Life let me introduce her to you see she left that amen she left that amen when he was proved to be the word of life she left it and had discovered that the same rock that was smitten in the wilderness was sitting right there present before her amen and she left that old well of Jacob amen for a greater water can you say amen amen so what it tells us then is that these non-spiritual gifts these nine Rivers they are not coming from a fanatic they're not coming amen from uh uh uh uh uh Hypocrites make-believers they're they're not coming from Sensational the um emotion work up amen but they're coming from the very Rock of Life can you say Amen Jesus Christ these Rivers this Waters amen this streams are coming from the very Rock himself ain't that right amen yes sir amen and what when the woman the water that that woman had been drinking had lost its taste amen hallelujah and brother Branham says this he says let me say the same God that was in the days gone by that we speak so much of he is present here now not by some theological understanding but by a personal knowledge of his Vindication that he would pour out in this last day the Holy Spirit upon his church he is not and I was he is still the I am present tense always can you say amen amen in other words the the shepherd has led us not to Old stagnant Waters but he's led us to present tense Waters that the rock that was of yesterday is present here today amen and you don't have to read a Bible story to take a drink you can experience the same Rock and drink the same water amen that the the the lady at the whale had drank can you say Amen yes sir now we know the devil can impersonate any gift that God has you believe that but David isn't talking about something that's been impersonated amen he's talking about the genuine thing coming out of a genuine Source ain't that right all these Rivers all come from one source of water Amen brother Brown said Rivers what is that it's the nine spiritual gifts rivers of one water one Spirit one water coming from nine different resources of rivers of water see he says there are diversities of gifts some are called to prophesy some called uh give gift of healing some have the wisdom some have knowledge by The Same Spirit some speak with tongues some interpret all by The Same Spirit see for First Corinthians 12 what is it rivers of many Waters many water many rivers of one water the Holy Spirit giving many gifts and blessings from everywhere he brings Rich gifts to you aren't you glad for that he brings Rich gifts to you gifts of healing Gifts of Salvation gifts of the Holy Spirit to work in your church and among the people see Rivers ain't that right now but notice I I I'm looking at this that that the the chapters 1 and and 23 of Psalms uh have something in common have a common ground and that is the waters amen God leads his sheep to Waters God plants his tree By the Waters ain't that right so water is very important to God brother Brandon even tells us in the house over why Bethlehem I believe it is why Bethlehem and and and he says that that Jesus Jesus is crying out for water today ain't that right the spirit of God crying out for water today and if you remember Amen brother Brown takes that of of David when David was a fugitive and and and uh he he the enemy had excommunicated him from his own City and and they had barred the the town the city of Bethlehem to where David couldn't get back in and in that City amen was Wells of living of of a fountain it was an Artesian whale I think that's how they put it it was an Artesian whale so it was fresh water it was cold water and and and so David you know uh he had been away from that water for a little while and and and so we we find that that now David did have water to drink from wherever he was but they were they were cisterns right the the water that he could drink was was a friend were cisterns and that that word cistern is uh an artificial Reservoir such as an underground tank for storing water like rain water or whatever but that water would get stagnant have y'all ever seen stagnant water I guess you have where you know the the little tadpoles and the little things that you know that it's just scummy and nasty and and well that's a sister and that's that's it's got water but the water's not flowing again and and so it gets stagnant and I'm sure being out in the desert and it's hot and and all that that water got hot as well and and it just something wasn't wasn't um uh desirable at all but but David he he began to desire a a cool fresh drink of that water amen from that Artesian whale ain't that right the Bible tells us that David cried out and said oh that one would give me a drink of the water of the whale of Bethlehem which is by the gate and and and and David's Mighty Men picked that up they heard him crying out for water and the Bible says that three of David's Mighty Men amen they buckled up amen they armored up amen and they said we're going to go get him some water see the the prophet said David's least desire was their command they knew he was coming into power they knew that one day he would be their King ain't that right amen and he's the the prophet says that they fought their way 15 miles through enemy territory to get a bucket of water for their King that was coming into Power amen 15 miles there and 15 miles back of fighting the enemy ain't that right amen see and they regarding that bucket of water to give to the to give to David amen see and the and the Bible says that when he finally came into power they David made each one of them a ruler over a certain city and brother Brown says that's the type of the Overcomer today can you say Amen they overcame and gave water for their King amen because he desired it amen and Christ as today has been driven away from his own church and they will not let him back in the enemy has garrisoned him Amen to where he cannot come into the church can you say Amen Prophet said he's called Holy Roller he's cast off to one side he's a Fanatic in everything rejected by the churches they've got their Creeds and things drawn up in this Christmas like they did at the first one we know that but we know that this word ever remains true and it's got to be fulfilled everybody say it's got to be fulfilled amen and the desire of Christ is for men Warriors to stand and he said he's a fugitive to his own church they reject him they love their Creeds and big dignitaries instead of the word and they won't let him be manifested they won't let him be preached in his power they've cut away from it just like the Bible said they'd do in Revelation 17. what are they doing now going up here today and all going in this world a council of churches Catholicism and Protestants and uh uh uniting together making the mark and the image of the Beast and the Protestants falling right for it Pentecostals everywhere dignitaries going into Rome from Pentecost and coming back and saying you know most spiritual place and in Texas and everywhere else they're opening up and giving understanding of these stations and so forth knowing that that that's Creeds that's been injected to this word ain't that right but he said Jesus is crying for a fresh drink of water oh do you hear him tonight amen he's crying for a fresh drink of water amen see the only water that these churches have offered him amen is stagnated water water from broken cisterns ain't that right amen so noticed the cry that brother Branham gives out oh come stand with me by my side I'm standing in a terrible place I challenge today these tapes go over the uh over the world and I challenge some man some lawyer who loves Jesus Christ that knows that these things has got to be fulfilled today Brethren come stand by my side and pull the word of God forget those dried cisterns and stagnated denominations that you're living in pull the fresh word of God let's give Jesus a good drink of fresh Pentecostal water ain't that right that's his desire today back to original Pentecost back to the word it's prophesied we would do so oh in Malachi the fourth chapter returned the faith of the children back to the fathers again another place Christ wants a real church he wants a bride let's cut our ways through see get out of here get these Creeds away that the real drinkers might come back and get a drink of real cool Pentecostal water that once flowed from this great well it's still flowing do you believe that see all you Bethlehem dwellers Hallelujah I call for men Warriors who's not afraid I don't care if there's 800 standing on one side and ten thousand on the other I want Warriors who will come with me and cut a hole through this line of unbelieving Philistines the World Council has got garrisoned around the word of God trying to make it Creeds and feed the people see there's a well everybody say there's a whale there's a fountain open in the House of David Bethlehem received for sin and uncleanness see brother sin is unbelief in his word who Warrior can see the Millennium coming what Warrior can see this great Holy Spirit come in the form of Jesus Christ the literal Body of Christ to take over again stand with me stand by me let's cut a hole through this denominational Creed let's get in there he's crying for a good fresh drink of Pentecostal a water original Pentecost not a bunch of caring on screaming hollering here I mean a genuine Holy Spirit baptism that produces the life of Jesus Christ back into the person can you say man I believe there's people here tonight that has got their swords drawn and says I'll stand there with you amen and we're standing Toe to Toe with the Enemy to make sure that the Pentecostal waters flow brother Branham said see God's going to have a people that will drink from that well Hallelujah he said you might think me I'm crazy and maybe I am then I'm crazy about Jesus and his word if I have to be called a fool let me be called a fool for his word I've never been against the men in them organizations I'm against that system that's barring the word of God out let's cut Warriors stand by you see let's go into that well he is our Bethlehem ain't that right and in him is that water that's flowing these old cisterns the World Council of churches organizing now let's restore the fresh word of God not a denomination let's not take a Creed that's old stagnated cisterns that fell 40 years ago 20 years ago 30 years ago or either last year I want God's word that's promised for today that's the drink he wants me to have is this word today can you say amen I aren't you glad that you've been planted there aren't you glad your Shepherd has led you there you've got you know where the water is amen and wherever the pure word is that's where the spirit of God is amen and where that pure word is is where the Living Waters is flowing is that all right notice after that woman at the well tasted that water Living Water brother Brown said then the sister lost its taste and so does every man who ever falls into the power of God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost the denominational systems lose their taste you don't want no more of that stagnated frogs and lizards and bugs and so forth you're drinking from a fountain that's fresh and pure the word of God fresh every hour in your soul the same as now when the word has been proven to be the truth taste and see if it's not right can you say Amen see if it's not right see amen so he says seeds though the cistern had served its well uh it served its time well but you see the Fountain of Life was there not Jacob's Well no more for Spiritual drinking and see so what they thought if they drank from that whale why it would be all right but now the Fountain of life itself was sitting right there well I believed them Waters that David is talking about them both in chapters is the Water of Life can you say amen amen and and he's LED you not only just LED you to him but he's planted you right there by them oh that that that that means a lot can you say man oh yes sir so brother Branham says see the bright the Bright Tree had come up at Pentecost there's a tree that David saw see it's planted by the rivers of water One River the Holy Spirit and all these Waters flowing into it spiritual gifts flowing into it ain't that right and notice what David said about this tree his leaves cannot wither ain't that right and it will bring forth its fruit his fruit in his season ain't that right so then then as as I'm going to get ready to close appreciate your patience but one thing I'm getting out of these two scriptures is the word restoration David talks about it in Psalms 23 and 3 we've talked about it he restoreth my soul ain't that right but we find that there is a restoration in Psalms one and three about that tree and brother Brandon would take us over into Joel ain't that right and where where Joel uh 2 25 God said I will restore to you the years that the Locust hath eaten the canker worm the caterpillar the Palmer worm my great Army which I sin among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied Green Pastures ain't that right you will eat in plenty and be satisfied but notice see brother Branham says that what Joel is talking about he's talking about the tree that David talked about amen so the tree was attacked amen by that room and by that that that that demon ain't that right it was attack and the tree was cut down amen but the Bible people had already prophesied through David God would prophesy and says the Lee shall not wither amen the fruit it will bear its fruit but it took a restoration ain't that right it took a restoration just as much as God ordained you before the foundation of the world to be Sons and Daughters of God yet the devil trapped you the devil admired you the devil had you in a slave of sin but it took a restoration it could never deny God's word it could never take him away even take you away from what God had originally planted amen and the same thing about that tree God planted that tree by the rivers of water and the devil could not take it away from that water and the tree as the tree began to drink from that water it began to be restored again and you say Amen how can the tree be restored it was planted by the river of water brother Bremen said see it was planted by the rivers of water showing that it was predestinated to be there can you say man so it cannot die job talks about it Job 14 7 for there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will Sprout again and that the Tinder Branch their fourth thereof will not cease though the root thereof wax old in the earth and the stock thereof die in the ground yet through the scent of water it will but and bring forth balls bowls like a plant can you say man oh aren't you glad amen it will it will live it will be restored why you're planted by the rivers of water can you say man and David would go through the steps and he would show us that before the soul could be restored he was in the Green Pastures and he was lit to the Waters of Life can you say man and what was he drinking spiritual Waters he was drinking of something that would restore him back to where he began in the mind of God can you say man church and I'll just be honest if you don't partake of the Waters of Life you'll never be restored back you can know this Bible full backward and forward you can know all the quotes backward and forward but until you drink of the rivers of Life till you drink just like that woman at the whale drag you can never be back and restored again now that woman could drink from the Waters of life because she had representation in the mind of God can you say amen amen and God made sure that she could drink from the Waters of Life yes she was a prostitute yes she was no good yes she was an outcast of society that God made sure to give her a drink of fresh water going to be restored trees planted look at David did not David when the enemy come and got the sheep and took it out did not David the shepherd go after that sheep and restore it back to where he belonged and you say man now notice as we close brother Brown says about this this tree he says this man's that's planted he isn't stuck out he he isn't just you know set out transposed from this to that but he was planted everybody say he was planted let's make that personal I am planted predestinated to the rivers of water see he's got Roots then he's not just stuck out have you ever just stuck a you know a limb that you you took off of a tree and it may have all the roots and or or not the roots but the the leaves are still green and you stick it in the ground and give it the end of the day or whatever and the leaves are starting to wither give it another day too and before you know it it's it's stuck in the ground but it has no roots it was not planted ain't that right well so God did not stick you in the ground he planted you by the rivers of water see so the prophet said see he's predestinated to be there not just by chance he was predestinated to catch that word when it was sold means that they'll be right there when it sticks she is there he's planted not just a down but he's actually planted ain't that right so you know what that means then you're at home you're at home by the rivers of water had the rivers of life you're at home you're at the place amen where God has predestinated you to be can you say man that's where you belong so you're not just led to these Pentecostal waters for a day or two that God has planted you there by predestination so this shows that you didn't get to the Waters of life just like that the the event of the woman in the well meeting Jesus was not by chance it was not by accident it was by predestination can you say man now I don't know if any of that made sense to you tonight I hope it did in some way but all I know is this if you're predestinated to drink from that water it's not just for yesterday and it's not just for tonight but in your lowest of lows in The Valleys in your darkest of times that water is still there because you were planted there there ain't no devil big enough to take that away from you there ain't no trial big enough to take it away from you and you say well I used to be I just remember when I I was closer to God than I am now but you're planted by the rivers of water there's always restoration for you can you say man there's always restoration that's why bitterness cannot grip your heart amen that's why uh uh if you fall down you're going to get back up that's that's why the habits are falling off that's why all these things because he planted you by the rivers of water can you say man which is a fountain where you'll never thirst again aren't you glad you're satisfied that you're never having a thirst again you're planted in the right place you're not going from revival to Revival that you can be in the in the desert to The Darkest Hour of your life and you're still prospering because he planted You By the Waters that means a lot Abraham said because it's predestinated the tree can't die now listen because your soul is a gene seed of God you cannot die he restoreth my soul ain't that right amen see the real brother Brown said the real ordained of God that real uh Gene that real germ a soul of God that was in God before the foundation the room the world remember you that's really got the spirit of God in you tonight you were here in Christ because he was the fullness of the word another place you have an immortal soul that cannot die that's not that's not made with atoms or with hydron hydrogen uh or with oxen oxygen or with anything that's on this Earth it's made by spirit that almighty God created himself and give it to you can you say Amen so that tree is planted by the wall rivers of water and its roots are drawing from that water and so therefore it cannot die can you say man and its leaves cannot wither it's bringing forth its fruit and in in hopefully Lord willing we will get more into that that that David is talking about the same thing about the man about the Sheep amen he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake you'll find that the tree there in the old in in in in Psalms 1 and 3 is a prosperous tree you'll find that that tree cannot die you'll find a man that he's bringing forth his fruits can you say man brother Bram talks about it in the restoration of the bright tree but then you'll find in Psalms 23 you'll find that that Sheep amen that we are he's prospering too in the same way you'll never find a sheep that is diminished you'll never find a sheep that is so half dead and half alive oh no no he leads you amen because you are you're his sheep and he is your Shepherd he's leading you in the paths of righteousness can you say Amen amen you're bearing fruit you're prospering can you say man oh yes sir the musicians will come we love the Lord I'm so glad that God leads us into what we were predestinated to or for ain't that right there's things about our lives as I've said before that we were not predestinated to but because he is our Shepherd he's leading us to where we've been predestinated too ain't that right in Psalms 1 shows us that it's a planting it's a planning it's a place the Bible uses you know different illustrations we're an eagle or sheep we're a tree we we got different types he takes the he takes the Sheep because we can be led and David said he leads me beside the Still Waters he uses as a tree because the trees planted and he plants Us beside the rivers of water can you say man it is still the same God doing the planning the same God doing the leading and it's the same people he's planning as well as leading I love the Lord isn't he wonderful amen
