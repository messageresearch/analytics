going to turn to the book of Ephesians first of all the fourth chapter amen and uh want to say it's just good to be here in the house of the Lord and uh just all those that were missing uh for a while

is Grace that we could St stand here and recognize you as Lord father and not just Lord of all of the Earth but we recognize you to be Lord Of Our Lives meaning that we have surrendered ourselves Lord we don't invite you just to come to just in us for one part but we have opened all of our doors of the Heart Lord and asked you to make your yourself at home and Lord we're just asking that you would just come and move among us today Lord as we are your needy people we need you now more than ever and father I pray Lord that you would take anything that is not like you take it out of us Lord and may we just be acceptant to your will and whatever you would have for our lives may it your word have more preeminence than ever before Lord in us and pray that you would anoint both speaker and hearer forgive us of our sins Lord our failures anything that has been said or done that would grieve you displease you I pray that you would forgive us Lord may we be better Christians Lord more like you we ask it father in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen amen and amen uh the book of Ephesians the fourth chapter and we'll start at the the first verse I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called with all loneliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace there is one body and one Spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling amen then if you'll turn to 1 Corinthians the 12th chapter amen 1 Corinthians chapter 12 and going to start at the 12th verse but it says uh for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ for by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many yet the foot shall say because I am not the hand uh I am not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the ear shall say well because I am not the eye I am not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the whole body were an eye where would the hearing if the whole were hearing where were the smelling but now hath God said the members everyone of them in the body as it hath pleased him amen aren't you glad for that then uh if you go the 23rd verse and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable upon these we bestow more abundant honor and our uncomely parts have more abundant cless for our comely Parts have no need but God hath tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to that part which is which lacked that there should be no Schism in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honored all members Rejoice with it now you are the body of Christ and members in particular amen you can uh have your seats this morning again I want to speak on the ministry of God in the body of Christ and um of course as we've said it is the um um God's Ministry working through the members of his own body to fulfill his will yeah and this this plan purpose God's will was formulated before the foundation of the world but it's in this age that he is finishing it up uh bringing it to pass sir we are not in the beginning stages of of God's will we are rather in the completion amen and the prophet said that God is taking the elect out of that Pentecostal church that high hybrid pulling it out and finishing up the word and it's got to be so close until the word itself will blend with this word see there there Comes The Headstone crying Grace Grace Amazing Grace The Headstone now as we all I'm sure have heard the sermon Christ is the mystery of God revealed and if you haven't you ought to go listen to it but brother brandham tells us that there is a a three-fold minut mystery that God had uh uh before the world began and uh that first part of the three-fold is to express himself completely in Jesus Christ God in Christ reconciling the world to himself secondly is to have the preeminence by this by God being in Christ the work that he had done that was the purpose purpose and and and he couldn't move on into the second phase of that until he had finished the first but by that then God is to have the preeminence in his church which is his body the bride see till he could have the preeminence to express himself through them Satan has tried to express himself and every other thing uh in the church but God had uh uh desired to express himself in the church and in order for him and it's his church and he in order for him to do that he's got to have the preeminence the third part is to restore the kingdom to its rightly position that failed by sin by the first adom back to where he walked in the cool of the evened E evening with his people talk with them fellowship with them amen so brother randam he he go in another place he said see first to manifest himself in Jesus Christ secondly to come into the body by Jesus Christ to have the preeminence thirdly to what restore back Eden bring back that which was lost ain't that right so the first fold Myster of of the mystery has been fulfilled and and and and we can all agree to that the the the world talks about it uh uh this is the season that that uh the world uh uh recreates the the baby in a manger scene talks about the God of History 2,000 years ago we have our Easter and and and they redo the you know they have their Easter pageants plays and things like that and so so we can all say that that part of that mystery has been fulfilled God in Christ reconciling the world Jesus said my meat is to do the will of the father and and and another place he said it is the father in me that doeth the works amen uh uh they they it was Philip that said it would it would suffice us if you would show us who the father is show us the Father and Jesus said have I not been have I been so long with you and you still don't know who I am he that has seen me has seen the father and so God in Christ expressed himself in fullness amen uh uh through throughout the the prophets and things he was able to express himself in part but in when it come to Christ he was able to express himself in fullness so then think of the day that we are living in brother B said we're living in one of the grandest ages that that ever uh man has been permitted to live Amen to think of that you've been permitted to live in the greatest age ever he said and that's because it's the closing out of time and the blending in of Eternity so this it tells you exactly where we're at and where God is in his plan and three-fold purpose uh because see if this is true if we are truly living in the the grandest age of of the ending of time the blending of Eternity which we believe it is true uh then that means that God has been able to call a people amen out of the Gentiles for his name amen and and now he's been able to have the preeminence over them and in them God able to achieve that second fold uh uh part of his mystery and that was to have the preeminence in his people amen and because of that now we're entering into that other phase of of of of time stopping and we're going into eternity I think that is powerful to to be able to be a part of that amen that God didn't choose us in Luther and and and and that wasn't the grandest age he didn't he didn't choose us to be part of Wesley or the Pentecostal age that was not the blending but we're now in that time of time ending eternity blending ain't that right so so uh uh this again is a sign that God has been able to have the preeminence in his church he has been able now think of it God has been able by you and by me has been able to prove to the devil that there are a people that will not bow there are a people that will not give in there are a people on this Earth that that will not be deceived um and and and uh uh he was able to deceive Eve in the infant stage of deception but we're living in the greatest the the the best deception that could ever be known to man uh uh we're living here we're living in the age but and the whole world will be deceived everyone will wander after the beast that's what the prophet said that's what the Bible says and and the prophet says the only ones that will not wander after that Beast will be those that were predestinated uh before the foundation of the world that'll be part of the bride of Christ amen see so so there there is a people that Satan just will not be able to influence because God has able to have preeminence in that group of people well this people is makes up his church his body they have been baptized into that one body by one Spirit God's church is not Faith Tabernacle it is not evening Life Tabernacle uh or light Tabernacle it's not true word Tabernacle it's not Full Gospel Light House it's not spoken word Tabernacle amen as good of titles and good of names and and good churches and and all of that but that's not the body of Christ that's not the Church of Christ and and and so no doubt that God has people in every in in these churches uh uh you know uh who are part of his church which is his body and and it's them people that God is able to have the preeminence over and in and through amen and so uh uh therefore you know see God is the word Amen brother brandham has has established that over and over and over the Bible tells us that God is the word so there for that revealed word and and brother bran really makes that known that when it's the word made manifest that's God that's Christ and and so therefore the revealed word is what has the preeminence over that elect people and the word comes to the prophets amen I am so glad for that Revelation to know that it does not come to psychologists it does not come to to to theologians it does not come just to the you know to the pope it doesn't come to the bishop Cardinal uh denomination it came to a prophet ain't that right so then we we know by God's grace and it is God's grace that we can truly believe that we have had a Vindicated prophet in this age which is not just a prophet gu saying I'm a prophet I'm there's a lot of people that's claiming to be prophets uh well in and outside the message ranks you know and and and they claim but we this Prophet is is a Malachi 4 Prophet it's a word Prophet amen and and and so uh you know uh uh as the Gentile bride of Christ we are not looking for another Prophet amen we don't need another Prophet to come we're not looking for another Prophet God has never promised to send us another Prophet outside of Malachi 4 amen so how many satisfied with the prophet of Malachi 4 well I'm satisfied see amen we're so we're not looking amen so that that takes the gullibleness out that takes the vulnerability or whatever you would want to call it when people say well I'm a prophet and this is a prophet and this is the Eighth Day and or eighth messenger and all that who cares I don't I don't I don't care you know uh uh let them let them whatever you know and and uh uh but I I I don't understand why people feel the need to keep in introducing another Prophet we don't need another prophet amen amen we we just don't need it and and and I'll be the first you know I'll be uh bold enough to declare that I don't need Brother Joseph brandham to be my Prophet uh I I just don't he don't need to tell me how to run my life and run the church and what I need to do amen God sent a prophet of Malachi 4 and that's good enough for me he he never promised now after I send you the prophet of Malachi 4 then I'm going to send you another Prophet it it never was that way and so uh uh and not to say that God doesn't have prophets on the earth and and and and I don't dispute that and if God has that then that's fine but God sent me a prophet of Malachi 4 and we understand his ministry brother Brandon plainly tied prophet of Malachi 4 with uh Revelations uh uh uh 10:7 the seventh angel amen so there is no other Prophet that's going to reveal the Mysteries no other Prophet going to reveal Mysteries ain't that right and and so uh uh but but they they they want to keep introducing and so they just don't seem to be satisfied with the prophet God sent to this generation and and they're not satisfied with what God Vindicated over and over and over to be the truth ain't that right so but but but if this word if the word is actually able to have the preeminence over you then you will not look for anything else outside of the will of God outside of the the word of God and outside of what God has promised in this age we know that the leodys of messenger is the last messenger it's the last messenger and notice what brother Brown said the last day Messenger will appear in God's appointed time it is the end time now as all know for Israel is in the Homeland any time now uh he will come according to Malachi see when we see him he will be dedicated to the word aren't you glad we had a prophet dedicated to the word amen he will be indicated pointed out in the word revelation 10:7 and God will vindicate his ministry he will preach the truth as did Elijah and be ready for the Mount Zion Showdown many will misunderstand him not because of him but because they have been taught scripture in a certain way which they consider true so when he comes against that they will not believe see even some true ministers will misunderstand the messenger because so much has been called God's truth by deceivers amen see but this Prophet will come and as the uh Forerunner of the first coming cried Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world even so he will no doubt cry out Behold the Lamb of God coming in glory he will do this for even as John was the messenger of Truth to the elect so is this one the last Messenger to the elect and word born bride amen see so so uh uh uh we we thank God for a messenger we thank God that we're able to believe and see it now then brother brandham says and notice listen to the authenticated prophet of God who appears in this last age what he says from God the bride will say can you say Amen what he says from God the bride will say the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing oh that's that people that God has been able to have preeminence over the spirit the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing and what they say will have already been said in the word but the people won't know it they won't believe it because they've been taught scripturally wrong Doctrine see they've been taught this and have accepted it as the truth but there is a people that God has opened their eyes and been able to have the preeminence that they are so sold out on what that Prophet said ain't that right amen you know why people need another Prophet is cuz they can't believe the prophet God sent so they need something else to Amen to try to fix it but every answer that you need the prophet brought it's in this message if you can just believe it amen that's right so notice now the prophet said notice what Harmony Jesus never did anything until seing of the father or the father first showed him Harmony Harmony between God and Christ see Harmony see John 5:19 says that see so so will the bride so will the bride amen see it was God in Christ and and there was such Harmony that Jesus never done nothing except the father first showed him so will the bride see uh uh he says and he shows her his word has he not done that did he not show us his word by a prophet in this age he shows her his word of life he shows her and she receives it see she never everybody say she never she never doubts it amen you going through trial but she'll never doubt it she goes through ups and downs but she never doubts it she's tempted but she never doubts it she may fall but she gets up and she never doubts it amen there's something about this ride that God is able to have such preeminence she never doubts it notice nothing can harm her you go through hell or high water but nothing will harm you amen you go through the deepest of Trials but nothing will harm you amen let Satan do whatever he wants to and God will allow it sometimes but nothing nothing will take that Faith away from her nothing will get her to deny God and curse God nothing will amen see nothing she never doubts it nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again he said I got a great big Hallelujah here is the secret here's the secret the word everybody say the word is in the bride the word is in the bride there's a people here this morning that the word is already found root in the word is in the bride see and the mind of Christ see to know what he wants done with that word now we're they're talking about Ministry in the bride see amen see the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word she does it in his name she has thus sayith the Lord she has thus sayith the Lord each member of the body has thus sayith the Lord do you believe that each member of the body body has thus sayth the Lord each member of the body knows what he wants done uh uh with the word and they do it each member in the body they do only his will and they do it in his name ain't that right see so then the this bride body is so different from what Jesus talked about uh uh uh uh uh that group of people that Jesus spoke of in Matthew 7:21 uh through 23 uh uh see not not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful Works see then I will profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity ain't that right see they did things in his name but they did not do his will they did things things in his name but he did not have the preeminence over them so how different from the bride from these these people amen the bride has he's been able to accomplish that that that second fold of his purpose and that was to have complete preeminence over them and what they do in his name will count because they're doing it according to his will amen it's a Ministry that fulfills the will of God that's all right so the this group of people that Jesus talks about doing it in his name and then in the end he says depart for me you workers of iniquity I never knew you see well they did things in his name but they didn't do the will of the father go go listen to that uh sermon uh brother Brandon doing God a service without being his will they did God a service but it wasn't his will ain't that right so then that tells us that the ministry that this bride has will be according to the will of God it it's in line with the will of God it isn't just out preaching it isn't just out singing it isn't just out prophesying speaking in tongues and all that it's all right into the will of God God has preeminence over the music God has preeminence over the preaching God has preeminence over the the husband God has preeminence over that housewife God has preeminence over the marriage God has preeminence over the local body God has the preeminence over every aspect he has the preeminence over the tongues he has the preeminence over the prophecy he has the preeminence over the Visions he has preeminence over the teaching he has preeminence over it all it isn't just a group of people doing something that they want to do for God God has the prance amen amen praise the Lord they did a service unto him without it being his will but notice again what the prophet said the word everybody say the word is where in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word everybody's got a Ministry but there's only one group that knows what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name she's the one that has thus sayith the Lord amen praise the Lord so now we're coming to the reality of what Jesus said in Mark 11:23 verily verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain well now we know who that one is the one that's going to say it the bride she has thus sayith the Lord ain't that right that's right see that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he say shall come to pass he shall have everybody say he shall have shall now let's let's make that personal I shall have I shall I shall have what soever things I say Amen why because you're part of the body you you have thus sayth the Lord you have the mind of Christ you know what he wants done with the word ain't that right see so he's speaking to no one else but the bride of Christ the Lord she can say it because the word is in her right she has the mind of Christ she know knows what he wants done with the word she has thus sayth the Lord see and and what gives her this Authority we go back she the prophet and the spirit are saying the same thing ain't that right so this shows that not only God was able to have preeminence in that Prophet he's now able to have preeminence over you the same spirit that spoke through the lips of that Prophet now has the preeminence to speak through you and what you say will be not in contrary to what a prophet says and what that Prophet taught was nothing contrary to this a that right people don't understand this at all they they look at it as literal they they take everything literally well it says it right here black and white right right here and that that's true it says it but then the prophet tells us to read between the lines get under an inspiration carnal people can't understand this even though they can read it with their own natural eyes they cannot understand this it's true so we find now now notice God has showed his word to her by way of a prophet and she has received it and never doubts it this is exactly what happened and this is our part in Revelations in the Book of Revelations in the fifth chapter we we know we're very familiar with it that John saw the lamb come forth and take the book lord it was a seven sealed book it was the book of redemption it's not just any book it's not tgj book it's it's it's not Dobson's book it's it's and and I I'll even say it it's not brother bram's book it's it's no no man's book this is God's book prise The Lord ain't that right and so John sees that the lamb come forth and loose the seals and open the look in the 10th chapter the first verse we see the mighty Angel which Christ it it it could only be right that's what a prophet said as the rainbow Covenant right uh uh he's the Covenant one the mighty Angel comes down with an open book he did not come without a book he had a book it was opened ain't that right see and and and then the prophet says see it's all connected that the seventh angel would be on the earth at the same time of this coming ain't that right because the word did not come to a pope it did not come to a bishop it did not come to to Shawn Martin I didn't need to be here at that event you didn't need to be here at event but one person that needed to be here was the seventh angel ain't that right Pope didn't the president all them people didn't need to be here but a prophet needed to be here so that seventh angel was on the earth at the same time of this coming if he wasn't here that a mighty Angel wouldn't have come down but but so so the mighty Angel comes down and gives the book right the Lord uh uh uh uh to the seventh angel uh uh so so then then we find that the seventh angel which is the prophet of Malachi 4 reveals the revelation of the book that's been given to him it's not a literal book that was given to him it was the revelation of of the book that was given to him the word came to a prophet ain't that right now notice art do we now now you know it's it's one thing to talk about the stories of brother brandham I love to hear about the stories of brother brandham uh uh actually uh I received a letter the other day of uh someone writing uh uh their eyewitness account of brother brandom praying for King George and and and uh explain going through all that that was phenomenal to me I I enjoyed reading that and and and so so you you have these things but but we God did not call us just to to think about the past and to dwell upon the past and and and talk about you know it it'd be just as bad as as as the denominations uh uh talking about Bible stories you know and well you can't get warmed by a painted fire you know and and so God never called us as message Believers to paint painted Fires for our young people and and and for our own lives and all that so God would give us something to do and it's all in Revelations 10 as well see so so here it is in in Revelations 10:8 John said that the voice which I heard uh uh from Heaven spake unto me again and said go get up get into action go take that little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and up on the earth ain't that right so now this tells us that every man has to have the same inspiration that the prophet had in order to get the true revelation of what the prophet brought ain't that right see the prophet received this book or Revelation by inspiration of God ain't that right he was not under the inspiration of Television he was not under the inspiration of Technology he was not in the under the inspiration of whatever else is that goes on in these days he received the Revelation because he was under inspiration of almighty God ain't that right now if you're going to understand the book if you're going to understand this message you've got to come to that same place of un inspiration to receive the same Revelation that the prophet gave it can you say Amen now brother brandom says I pray that the same inspiration that was given to me to speak it to you that you received it in the same inspiration that it was sent in come on Church the angel of the Lord told Brother Bram you must be more sincere than ever before well I believe that applies to you and I as well amen all right now brother Braham said if the true spirit of God is there it'll direct it into the word not just one place in the word but the entire word for the entire age see so the spirit of God a amen now coming upon the people he's he's going to have preeminence in a body amen and what that is is the Revelation that God would give to a bride amen through a prophet now that spirit is taking that same word and directing it right into our hearts amen not just one portion of the word but the whole entire thing God able to have the preeminence in his body Hallelujah now see that's the spirit of God that's what happened on the day of Pentecost amen is is the prophet said the spirit directed it right into that word amen right into the word they just didn't receive an experience amen but that experience was right from the word amen and the spirit of God that came to them opened their eyes and their understanding to to to to what amen was going on see and so Peter said this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel a ain't that right see now everyone else was looking at at the the the the phenomenon and they were calling it well these men are drunk they were calling it natural wine they were calling it a natural thing and and and and all of these things but Peter having an understanding of what was taking place why he had the spirit upon him the same spirit amen that was upon that Prophet Joel that would prophesy of this event now that same Spirit was upon Peter Amen to recognize that amen that prophecy was being fulfilled right before them and in them in Luther's day the spirit directed it into the word the just shall live by faith in Wesley's day the spirit directed it into the word in the Pentecostal movement the prophet said the spirit directed it into that word and the spirit is doing it again in our day amen now notice the prophet said this is the calling out of the Bride not 2,000 years ago at Pentecost or the the repeat or the return now is the bride calling everybody say this is the bride calling amen why because now the spirit of God now notice the spirit of God in that Prophet is directing him right into the word for this age no one could understand these things you ain't hearing you ain't seeing these denominations and these these uh Independence and all that talking about a bride coming of Christ and and a bride coming out of the out of the churches and all of that they're trying to get us into the church churches they're trying to join us together but there was a man who was inspired by God that received the book receive the Revelation and began to declare it's a bride coming it it's a calling out of this Bride Can you say amen and now we by the same inspiration receive it for us he said now this is the bride calling now is when the Seven Seals has been opened now when the complete things that the reformers have left has to be opened and only Malachi 4 can do that because it takes the Revelation straight from God to an individual see to do so that's right it can't come to a group never did one man and that's what God promised in the shadows of the coming for his bride uh and elaser so elaser was a type of this last day messenger ain't that right remember that's what brother brandom he was asking God could you show me what part of I am in the word amen and and his Bible opened up to El eer getting a bride for Isaac right and he said and that's what I'm here for is to get a bride for Christ Hallelujah yes sir but you know what before eler got there brother Bram said 30 minutes before eler got there at that well this Angel of the Lord beat him there amen and was on upon come upon uh Rebecca and told her said now you go to that well he was directing her to that well ain't that right and the same God that was Upon Our prophet elaser of this age is the same God that has directed us to this message Hallelujah that we can receive it praise the Lord now a people being called out for his name it's the bride coming of Christ fixing to meet Christ in the air she must be a perfect match amen and notice John in in in that Revelations 10 does not represent a denomination no cuz denominations aren't going to eat the book he he he doesn't represent a psychologist cuz psychologist ain't going to eat the book He's not representing the pope because he's not going to eat the book He's not representing a theologian or or or a certain church cuz they ain't going to eat the book He's representing every man woman boy girl who is part of the Bride they're going to eat the book Amen brother Brown said he was a representation of the Bride ain't that right and and and the angel tells no one else to go get the book only the bride only John go get the book ain't that right and this is why we're so sold out on this messag amen sure it's true now now notice uh uh we'll continue on Revelations 10:9 and I went to the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter see and he said unto me thou must prophesy again you know there there are certain reactions that when we eat the book something happens amen there's a bitterness that takes that comes brother brand talks about persecutions and things like that that that comes with with bitterness see see it's it's a joy to to us but at the same time we love the message it's a joy to hear it it's a joy to eat it but it's not going to be easy it just ain't going to be easy if there's ever a misunderstood people it's the bride of Christ if there's an Ever uh critics that that that are out there against the bride it's it's it's today and and they're against the bride of Christ because that that that all them hundreds of of demons that was Unleashed in the Feast of the trumpets brother Bram talks about it they've been Unleashed against the bride it's it's to the bride can you say Amen but they'll never be able to take her out you understand that but notice he's eating the book he's feeling this odd uh he's feeling the good about it he's feeling the bitterness of it and and these things but notice now what he's commanded to do thou must prophesy again Lord see now he's putting John in a in a Ministry he could not God would not have given him Ministry amen without him first eating the book ain't that right yeah Dr Dobson does not give you the ministry guar hello you you got a ministry as a father you got a ministry as a mother you got a ministry as as preachers you got a ministry as music you got a Ministry of of whatever but there is no man that can put you in the ministry you eat the book that's what this bride is to do is eat the book not interested in what they all have to say that's not the book I'm to eat and you amen thou must prophesy again before many peoples Nations tongues and Kings see so notice thou must prophesy again this isn't a gift of Prophecy that that that is is mentioned in in as as one of the nine spiritual gifts that God placed in the body as one of the you know as nine spiritual gifts this prophesying is a confession and and the word confession means to say the same thing at has a ain't that right so remember the spirit the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing you got to eat the book get under the same inspiration to receive the same Revelation praise the Lord then you'll be saying the same thing brother Bram said see God still has a voice do you believe that God still has a voice for the people of the world even as he has given a voice to the bride that voice is in the bride see she's the one that has thus sayi the Lord Brother Bram said they know that it's his voice because it's the promised word of the day ain't that right don't tell me that the voice of God is in you and you're still preaching a foolish virgin message come on come on now hello or some denominational Doctrine it it it it see it is impossible to say the same thing as make that confession unless you have received it under the same inspiration that it was taught or given Lord ain't that right so this prophesying this prophesying is about the word becoming flesh thou must prophesy again this is to every bride remember that eats the book thou must prophesy again now notice how we need in Jeffersonville thousands of lived everybody say lived voices so this prophesying is not just some just the talking or speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues and all of that it's actually the word that you have eaten now becomes reflected through you word made flesh you become written Epistles read and known of all men how we need in Jeffersonville thousands of live voices the Thunder of of God thundering out in sweetness and Holiness Purity undefiled lives walking around in the Earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians that's the Thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or shout but What Hurts The Devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrated to God say anything to him call any him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on oh my that throws him away that's the Thunder that shakes the devil well you say well if if if he could just preach just like Billy Graham or an or Roberts or something a great in influential speaker oh no sometimes the devil just laughs at that he don't pay no more attention to that than nothing see you get all the theology he wanted to and all the Seminary training and the devil just sits back and laughs at that but when he sees that life when he sees the life so John now eats the book and the book becomes him he becomes the book ain't that right that's right that's the Thunder of God that is shaking the enemy that now you're coming into not just your ministry but now you're coming into the will of God prise the Lord anyone can speak in tongues and live like a devil that's right anyone can prophesy brother Brown taught us that he showed us that two men were prophesying one was genuine both of them was accurate true one was genuine the other one was living with a woman it wasn't even his wife had children by her have I ever saw a devil there was one there this is a bride amen on see a person can't eat the book and live contrary to what the prophet taught and lived himself amen see so what life is it what life are we talking about that that what is the thunder it's word life word life so John didn't represent the carnal man and the carnal mind and he represented the individual who has been born again from above praise the Lord that's what the prophet called it you're been born again from above ain't that right and God's life in US causes us to be active he says in the things amen from above amen see his life is his word in US vindicating the word itself see his life is now in us his life is his word in US vindicating this written word amen now notice brother Brown said see the spirit that's in you is the word made flesh in you the spirit Minds the word and is active in vindicating the word praise the Lord that's right A lot of people saying I got the Holy Ghost yeah but notice what the brother said now the spirit that's in you is the word made flesh in you the spirit Minds the word and is active in vindicating the word amen where in you in me in the bride now see the spirit is not active in any denomination it's not interested in making organization because the spirit itself is contrary to the organization the organization are looking for worldly things mind of the world see they they they make big temples polished things and great polished organizations polished ministers preachers and so forth like that and has the best class in the city where the spirit see that's what denomination is trying to do where the spirit is trying to find Honest Hearts where the spirit is anxious to manifest and prove that every word of God is true I hope you understand the difference between being outside the body and inside the body the difference in Ministry outside the body and in the body praise the Lord he said how can you he said how can the spirit working an organization when it's denying taking Creeds when that organization is taking Creeds instead of the word of God yeah you can't do it see it's dead God don't go to them kinds of places to find his a group of men to work for him cuz they already dead they're unbelievers in the word or or they wouldn't be in there see we are active in the things from above see the spirit Minds the word now that's right because the spirit gives the word life ain't that right praise the Lord now as we continue on for a few minutes but as I said you know Sunday night man was made or last morning uh Sunday morning made to to achieve things for God and and but he could only achieve as long as he stayed within the premises of God's will uh and and he was successful in what he done as long as he worked according to God's will but then the fall came and and man because man wanted to achieve something uh outside of God's help and he become his own unit and so now he leaves he left God out of the picture and and and so and this is where we're at today throughout time man has achieved many things uh for you know great Great accomplishments but has done so outside the will of God all the accomplishments that man has done has been outside the will of God so therefore he is achieving for himself and not for God brother Bri said he has selfish Mo motives he he's a selfish individual man is he's he's selfish in his motives he's got selfish agenda he is self-centered uh uh and and you know you think of it that we're living in a day where where most well we we are considered to be uh a Christian Nation by most I don't know about Obama but uh most of us you know consider ourselves a great Christian Nation and most people consider themselves to be Christians anymore and and the world is maybe coming to that uh as well but but yet in this age where everything has become christianized and and all of that uh we're we're we're living where the Bible prophesied that men would be lovers of their own selves more than lovers of God now you think of that the the Christian Nation Christian everybody I'm a Christian oh yes you know hardly ever goes to church but I'm Christian drinking smok I'm Christian you know uh uh I mean it's it's even coming to transgender being Christians and all that everything is being accepted today and and yet the problem is is they lovers of pleasure lovers of themselves more than they are lovers of God yet these people are preaching singing playing music they're deacons holding offices in the church and even having religious rallies worldwide and and and they give to others in various ways oh you're talking about programs and pouring money into people feeding the poor and helping in this and helping in that and it sounds good but but the core of it is they're lovers of their own selves than they are lovers of God they're lovers of pleasure more than they are lovers of of God and and so they can do all of this and yet be self-centered and self uh indulged and and have selfish motives and all of this thing and you say well how can they how can that be uh uh how can they give so much and how can they do of their time and how can they pour their energy and all of these things and still be selfish in all this amen you know why because they're doing it their own way they're not doing it according to God's way they're not doing it according to God's will they'll never become subject uh come under subject to God's Will and purpose it's why they want to do what they want to give what they want their Ministry and before you know it it's the individual that's recognized and really not God oh we can't do without that individual no you can do without the individual you can't do without godl what's the need to pray if you got you if if if if you know for food or money or whatever when when you got programs out there that you can go what the need to pray and really get down serious with God when you got all this scientific medication and and all these things amen and in the middle of all this brother Bram said faith will be slow why because man has done their own thing accomplish great things but not according to the will of God so so what good does it do to preach when the revealed word is not being brought forth to help the people what good is it to sing gospel songs when the one sing is living a life contrary to the revealed word of God what good is it to prophesy if it isn't done according to the word of God what good is it to help feed the people and and care for them in the Natural Things of life if we're not in line with the word of God see so so so so people people people can do things in great achievements and things but but when they're not in the will of God they're drawing attention to themselves instead of God ain't that right and all of these things may be a a display of compassion we thank God for compassion thank God for people that still has compassion that's right but you know what there's only one real compassion that really works and that's Godly compassion and brother Bram said Godly compassion is is doing God's will Godly compassion is doing God's will that's what he a lot of compassion people doing everything that they want to do I mean there there's people that give millions of dollars to help the poor and all that and don't even claim to be Christian or they may claim to be Christian but they're dressed like and harlots and everything against God ain't that right but Godly compassion is doing the will of God so the unregenerated man he has a carnal mind a carnal nature that his enity against God is Not subject to the law of God and indeed cannot be so science works against God's plan Education Works against God's plan and we will'll even goes to say that religion works against God's plan can you say Amen because it's it's the work of a carnal it's the achievement of the carnal man who is against God and God you know go God can't fulfill his purpose God cannot have preeminence in them types of Ministries as great Ministries as they may be God can't have preeminence in them Ministries on but God says I'll have a people that I can have preeminence in and it won't be human compassion that they display it'll be my compassion it won't be just be a Ministry it'll be my Ministry because I can work through them ain't that right see and God will get glory for it yes prise the Lord so God will not be defeated and his purpose will not be and go unfulfilled man is the agency whereby God's purpose and will is fulfilled and we read this last Sunday morning that God wants to fulfill his word and he don't have any hands but mine and yours he don't have any eyes but mine and yours he has no tongue but mine and yours I'm the vine you're the branches he said see see the branches bear the fruit the vine energizes the branch he energizes us and we bring forth his life as he brings it through us whether it's preaching the gospel by lip or saying Vision by eye whether it's whatever it is laying hands on the sick whatever it is is it's Christ working through the branches of his church every office literally electrified by his presence see so the people who are ordained to fulfill his purpose are baptized into one body by one Spirit ain't that right and so as members of this body we have been given a Ministry some are called to preach some are called to sing uh you know as I've said you know some fathers musici Ians mothers Housewives we all have a Ministry and and every member has a place in the body of Christ and has that Ministry then then if if that be the case and it is then every member of the body is important do you believe that and and not because of what we are to bring to the table yeah not because we've got all this to offer see whether you you say well I got a good singing voice I can for that one that'd be really good well that's not why you're important amen you're important in the body and I I'll say this because I believe it is because your Nature has been changed your Nature has been changed what good is it to have a Ministry if your nature hasn't been changed so so there your Nature has been changed now every member of that body their objective their motive is now to do the will of God their energy is now to do the will of God they're able now to put God first of over everything of their life God first God first God first the Lord that's why you're important in the body it's not because you preach to thousands or you preach to one there's that does not make you less important it's it's not because you know whether whether or not you you can play in a band or or you just play in a small little old church that that's that's not the importance the importance what makes you important and invaluable is your Nature has been changed now you're not doing things through sish motives now you can be submissive now you can come under subjection to the word of God and the will and the plan of God see because Ministry is only successful when it is working in accordance to the will of God a ain't that right cuz even when Moses for example was ordained we know he was ordained he knew he was called to deliver the people he was taught that from his from from uh uh from a child amen you you're taught God God has called you you've been called to deliver the people you are a deliverer you are to be the leader so he understood that but it was all intellectually amen so the day day come he decides he's going to take care of things and what does he do he miserably failed true that's right ain't that right amen see because he tried to do it outside of God's will but the prophet said when he found the direct will of God and the time of God and received the revelation of what to do how to do it on he was successful ain't that right nothing could stand in his way see God never called Moses to deliver the people his people by his own wisdom his own ability his own his own power amen see but when he was a able to get Moses from looking at himself his abilities his talents and what did he had to do he had to strip Moses to where the only thing that Moses saw was his weakness amen I stutter if God would have come to Moses when he was a younger man man you picked the right guy buddy we'll do it you just sit back and let old Moses take care of things but he tried to and he fail but when God got him so surrendered God stripped him of everything thing and God knows how to strip his bride every member is going to go through it every member praise the Lord I know some people rebel against the dealings with god brother brown or the Bible says a man a person that cannot cannot humble themselves and cannot when God chastises them and they cannot take that chastisement they're same as the bastard childen every man every woman boy or girl that comes to God must be chastened of the Lord that's true you say oh but man I I got things I could do I could do don't matter God's going to strip you down to where you become dependent upon him Lord ain't that right see so when God finally got Moses from looking at his own self and his own abilities then the prophet said he could reveal his plan to Moses praise the Lord that's right and Moses could accept it and it was totally different from what Moses thought now the prophet said Moses wasn't looking at himself he was looking to the word he was looking to the word first and foremost see he what was the word the word that God had promised my now Moses knew the time was right ain't that right the prophet said he had Direct contact with God to know how and when to do it see so God has a time for his word to be fulfilled he has a way for his word to be fulfilled he has the person for his word to be fulfilled but it ain't going to be to what you thought come on you love him amen I hope this all right so each of us another thing each of us must be in the position that God has ordained for us in order to fulfill his will if God has called me to be a businessman then that's where I am to fulfill his will if God has called me to be a teacher school teacher then that's where I'm ordained that's where I'm going to fulfill his will if God's called me to be the electrician that's where I'm to do his will if God's called me to be a preacher that's where I'm going to do his will whatever God has called us in no matter what that's where you are going to fulfill his will outside of that you can do whatever you want to and you'll be a failure amen amen so see I I I if if if God is called me to be something then see I can't take brother Tim's place he can't take my place amen but is it anyone less important nope it's the body amen ain't that right see so then if if God has called you ladies to be a housewife do you realize you'll not fulfill God's purpose outside of that he's called you ordained you to be a mother then be a mother don't don't try to take your husband's place don't tell your husband how to do his job amen so many of the leoes sometimes and churches try to tell the pastor how to do it oh my and it's so funny because you think they were the pastor makes you want to just get up and say here once you have a seat right here and I'll sit over there so you can Pastor me a little bit it's totally out of position that's right totally out of line see so brother brandom says this there is one bride everybody say there's one bride not a dozen denominations but one bride that's elected out of the earth that's been predestinated to this now notice now this is important the ones who can recognize their place in the Kingdom amen Who belongs in the bride who's going to be part of that bride the ones who can recognize their place in the Kingdom well how am I going to recognize my place by being submitted to God letting him have that preeminence over your life see the bride is part of her husband ain't that right the Book of Genesis we know that that God took her out of her husband took the woman out of her husband and in Genesis 2:23 Adam said this is now bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she it was taken out of man so if you're the bride of Christ you've been taken out of Christ he's the word you're the word you're part of that your husband is the word you United with him are are the word of God amen notice brother brand said the only place that you'll ever recognize it the only place you'll ever recognize it is recognize what part of that husband that word you are how do I know beyond a sh of a doubt that I'm United I've been that my husband is the word quit disobeying the word you'll never recognize it by by disobeying the word but you'll recognize it when you fall into your position amen hello amen what he says see you recognize what part of that husband you are see you can't recognize being the bride or or you cannot recognize being the bride you have to recognize your position you cannot recognize somebody [Music] else's on now you've got to recognize your place your position and what does it do it fits in the body now look where we're at as a bride how God has so blessed us with a prophet amen and what has happened brother Brandman the Feast of trumpet said National Force will will put Israel in her Homeland and we see that it's done it through the Holocaust Amen brother Bram says it's the tender hand of Jehovah we would have never understood that one without a prophet telling us what happened and what it was all about and we just believe it right amen National Force put is back in her position yeah National Force is going to put the church in the world Council of churches that's right but the power of God is putting the bride in her place stay with the message listen to that message you say well I've already heard that tape listen to it again absolutely till it becomes part of you am that's right ain't that right the power of God is putting the bride see the spirit of God which is the word of God will put her in her position she will recognize her position then she's in Christ can you say Amen do you love the Lord amen I love him if the musicians will come praise His name we're living in a day of total confusion total because and and and and I'll be honest it's because the people you know no one likes the position that God has called them to oh wow and it's becoming more of a confusion the name Le oysa means people's rights amen so the world is has been working this is just the motive of Satan has been trying his best from the beginning is to get get Humanity not to recognize their place their position just like the woman the first woman was to be help meat to the man right that's what God Said She be help meat but what did she end up doing she had become more of a help meat to Satan through the serpent than she was to Adam hello see and and and so it's it's just Satan trying to get us everyone out of their position to be something else and all that but you know what when you're out of your position Satan's able to use you sure so so he's the world is is been working and working and now it's coming to a full thing of Satan's Eden to where there's no distinction between anything anybody can be whatever they want to [Music] be so I say to you if God ordained you to be a woman be content if God ordained you to be a man then be content if God ordained you to be the housewife be content if God made you you know to be you know to be the father be content be content with being a husband be content with being a man be content be content with being a preacher be content with being the singer being a musician be content ain't that right if there's ever time that people God's called a people to be content it's it's it's the bride the bride's going to be content with where God puts her cuz she's eating the book and God has come to a place that he's able to have have preeminence in in that bride and every member in that body is going to be [Music] content God ordained to be construction worker be content ain't that right in whatever position or God or as God or dained you to be be be content with that but then not only be content in your position but be content with whatever has been allotted to you be content not everybody is called to be successful in in such that they're millionaires not everybody's called to be Bill [Music] Gates not everybody's called to have Mansions not everybody's called to drive Mercedes you see you understand what I'm saying well I work just as hard as the next guy but maybe God didn't call you for that so you got to be content with what God has called you and what God has allotted you that's right cuz if if not then you start comparing yourself with everybody you look at other these evangelists well why am I being like that then something got to be wrong with me no just be content with what God's called you to be because when it's all said and done everyone that has done the will of God is going to hear the very same words well done thou good and faithful servant faithful everybody say faithful servant not servant faithful [Music] servant so be content with it and be the best that you can be while serving in that capacity there's no jealousy in this bride amen amen when you can recognize each one's position you say well how how do do I know God blesses it and the blessings is not necessarily what we consider blessings but watch how faithful that man is watch how faithful that woman is what look look at the look look at the the the contentment look at the the the anointing look look at what God is doing in their life look how they're prospering not not in physical not not in natural because you you can be in God's Will and still be battling Health you can be perfect ly in God's Will and and and be as broke as job's turkey [Music] amen there's one thing about it there'll be a peace and contentment there will be an anointing on your life and everybody will recognize it God God will be there with you it's I don't know how to explain it but it'll be there the Lord but I'm not going to read it cuz it is lengthy but Matthew 25 and 14-30 you ought to go and read that Jesus talking about about the the the different three different men that he gave different talents to and the one that had the least Talent he didn't do nothing with it honestly I maybe he just felt like well he's only given me one Talent so surely he doesn't think much of me I don't I don't know what to do you know I mean so he just half-heartedly he wasn't content with it he he could have worked it he wasn't content with it so he buries it instead of doing something with it then when the lord of the house come back he found that the the one with five talents he doubled he done something with it the one with the two Talent he done something with it but that one man he had to hold his head down low and you got to remember the only ones we answer to Is God that's true you love the Lord Brother BR said see no matter how little of a congregation he gives you to Pastor how small the work seems to be just speak to the MU man or to the new news boy he will see [Music] it I hope you understand see so God gives you a capacity to work in but do you realize you reach more people than I would ever reach you'll you'll you'll reach people that I'll never even get to talk to I'll ever get to meet so it's not that he wants you to be in your business or in your ability to become successful man if I can just become boss if I can just become boss and you work work work work work work work work work to be that that what you want to be but maybe God has just called you to speak to people and maybe through your whole career it could just be one person so instead of being so business-minded or so materialistic minded or or whatever let's be godm minded that when we wake up say God what do you want me to do today who do you want me to speak to today who you going to lead in my life God may have not called you to speak to everybody in your life there may be that one individual that he does talk lead you to speak to amen and if you could be under an unction of God and be that channel that God could flow through and have preeminence over you that's that's that's what matters the r said you can't do nothing for Jesus unless he knows it you must remember he knows every little thing you do and he will give you all credit for that's what you've been detailed to do no matter how small it is do it anyhow give your all to it put your energy into it you may not be the preacher you may not be the musician but do something for God if you're going to be part of a church whether it's this church or some other Church be part of it then and do everything you can for it if if it's to sweep the the carpet if it's to if it's to sweep you know what whatever it is if it's to fix something if it's if it's just whatever do it cuz what you're doing is you're furthering the kingdom you you're being part of something you said well but I'm not recognized I'm I'm not well we could all be in that if really all looked at it if we're really doing this for a selfish thing man we have a lot to gripe about but you know what we're part of the body of Christ we're not doing it for selfish reasons the whole point is that his kingdom can be established that we can lead people to God that people can see God in us yeah but I'm My Own man nobody going to tell me what to do well God's going to tell you what to do if you're in his if he's got preeminence over [Music] you you loving Ram talks about that little lady that really just wanted to do something for God so bad God laid it upon her heart she was just a wash woman wasn't called to preach wasn't called to do anything but she just you know she just want to do something for God way back in the days you know 100 two 200 300 years ago now I guess so she rented a livery stable for a dollar I think it was for a month or started cleaning it out just asking God to bless it then she started passing out tracks to the town people didn't want it to throw it away just laughed at her ridiculed her they weren't interested but she just kept on God but God had put it on her heart and that little boy she passed the little track said here you are little Sunny he said well what you doing well we're going to have a meeting tonight you're welcome to come all right I'll be there the preacher came began to preach just to that woman and that boy gave the altar calling that boy come gave his heart to the Lord probably that was DL Moody and look at what he done he won millions of souls is because someone wasn't looking for big things they just want to do something for God they just wanted to do what God had called them to do she wasn't trying to preach she wasn't trying to be whatever she just doing what God had laid on her heart that's what really matters isn't it I hope of helped you somehow can we just stand to our [Music] feet no matter
