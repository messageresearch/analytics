is going to be ministering Josh Martin and he was in the area oh it's good to have him since Loretta and their baby with us and so looking forward to what God has in store for us this evening and so let's just sing that song Amen The More I Seek You The More I Seek You the more I find or I find you the more I wanna see it at your feet from the cup in your head hear your word in my ear s more than

your hand s [Music] High rest in your peace I want to sit at your feet [Music] feels that you desire more than I can understand Hallelujah amen are you resting this evening I believe there's a place that the bride can rest don't have to worry about the struggles the things that we go through amen if you have your Bibles let's turn to Proverbs 3 and 5. you happen to be in the house of the Lord amen it's an honor to be here tonight appreciate Uncle Sean asking us to speak tonight and I pray something can be said to be a blessing amen I believe we can come to church with an expectation and that expectation be met amen you know brother Branham says that uh the woman with the issue of blood so she had an expectation to be healed when she seen Jesus and her expectation was mad amen I don't believe Christ went by there by an accident but he knew that there was going to be somebody there with a need amen and I believe that there's a need tonight if there's a need God can meet it amen Proverbs 3 and 5 trust in the Lord with all thine hearts and lead not unto thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy paths amen can be about our heads tonight dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord we want to thank you for your grace and your mercy God bringing us into your to your house safely Lord Lord as we come into this part of the service I ask that you would anoint me Lord As I Lay myself aside I ask that you would speak to these lips of clay Lord you know the needs that are in the building God and I ask that you would meet him tonight father we ask these things in your precious name amen you may be seated if I had a title tonight it would be changing your focus and it's a simple thought but I pray we can take something from it this evening but I believe that our future is based on what we focus on the direction that we want to go is based on our Focus you know if you go to to college and do you want to be a scientist and you you want to become something like that you're not going to focus on History you know you're not you're you're majoring going to be something that's not going to help you in that direction but you're going to major in something that is going to push you in the right direction and I believe there must be a direction for the bride you see we're not going to make a Rapture by accident we're not going to see The Body Change by accident but it's something that we're going to have to press for and find the direction you look at Proverbs 29 and 18 where there was no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he so where there's no direction that people's going to perish and we see that taking place today there's no Direction people's trying to do their own thing they've got their own thoughts they're they've got their own away they're going and we see them the world is in a perishing state but I like how the scripture continues on to say but here that keepeth the law happy is he so in the midst of uh in the midst of chaos there's somebody that is living in a state where there's a vision and I believe that God has given the Bride of Direction you see I was in Richmond this morning and uh in order for me to get here I had to get on a road and find a direction to get here I didn't get here by accident I had my car I have the I have the address to get here but I needed something to bring me here I needed something to show me a direction even though I have the means to get here I have the car I had I had my phone but I needed to pull up my GPS pull up my maps put on the GPS and follow that direction to get here and I believe God has given us something to take us all the way to a Rapture but we got a choice to either let it lay dormant or to pick it up and follow that direction you you see brother Branham talks about the North Star he says if you're ever lost in the woods there's always a direction and I like how the certainty that he's gone he says there's always a Direction you can find the North Star he says that will give you a direction and he says Christ is that North Star he goes on to say now I hunt worldwide and I've been in the wilderness and sometimes one of the best he says if you can look up and know the direction of the North Star he guides you out it's a man that same if he's ever lost if he can only find the North Star he can direct himself and I like how he's putting that he says if you're lost on Earth find the North Star or if you're lost on the sea Ponder North Star so it don't matter where you're at you can always find the same God and I don't care wherever you're at if you're in if you're in India or in Africa or here in America it's the same God it's the same nor star that is guiding the bride and brother Branham goes on to sake and direct himself than the way he's going that's when he's lost if he can look for the North Star he's continuing saying if he can look for it we got too many people wanting to go in our Direction but don't know where to find find the direction they want to make a Rapture but they're looking for that direction in the things of the world the looking for that direction in this man's opinion or this man's idea there's only one way to find the direction that's through the message of the hour you see I believe the only way to see the supernatural in this last day is through the message of the hour the only way to see a body change in this day is through the message of the hour God has given us a Direction but it's up to us whether we're going to focus on it or not brother Branham says no other star shift but the North Star sits right in the center of the earth no matter where the Earth is turning that North Star Remains the Same so he's pointing out that the Earth is going to be rotating the Earth is moving the other stars are moving so you can't rely on the earth for Direction You Can't rely on the other stars for a direction you need to rely on a time post that ain't going to move it ain't going to be tossed to and fro so if you're relying on your money for your Eternal destination your directions off if you're relying on the things of the Earth for your direction it's going to be off but if you can find your direction in the messaging in Christ that's been revealed in this last day we don't got to be we don't we don't got to worry about being tossed to and fro but we're something's anchored on the inside you see but The Branding continues on to save it points towards towards the North and it's the only true star he says they'll be half it's it's that extremely North Star it gives you your direction and he says that's what Christ is to you so he goes on to say if you want to go to heaven if you want to be saved if you want to be filled with the spirit if you want to be christ-like he says Christ is your North Star so he's saying if you want a destination if you want to see the supernatural if you want to see God revealed on your skins you've got to find the right direction if she went up the holy ghost or if she wants to go to heaven you want to be saved you want to be filled of the spirit if you want to be Christ like Christ is your North Star if you're ever lost don't take a Creed he's your nurse start he's your way here's your direction and I believe the bride ain't no longer looking for a Direction but she's found the direction if something's in your midst and you're continuing looking you're going to go right by it and not focus on it you're not going to realize it's there but the bride ain't looking any longer but she's found the direction for a Rapture she's found her direction for her body change you see the Earth is constantly moving times is changing currency is changing the stock market is changing property value is changing car value is changing so nothing in the world nothing on the earth is secure everything is constantly changing but there's one thing we can anchor our life upon hanker our destination on hanker our family's destination on that's the message of the hour you see you can't anchor your life on anything because it's going to fall it's gonna it's gonna be washed away but there's something God has given us in this last day that we can focus on you see we got too many people expecting to be going in One Direction but their focus is somewhere else you see in order for me to get to Blacksburg from Richmond I had to go this direction and not to DC there could have been other places that looked more more glamorous I'm sure DC has more to offer than Blacksburg you know these other cities has more to offer than Blacksburg but there was something here that I needed to come to I did not have no desire to go to DC I did not have a desire to go to these other places but there was a desire oh Hallelujah to come to Christiansburg and there's no desire on the inside of you to go in the tribulation there's no desire inside of you to go to a hell but God is a place of Desire on the inside of your heart to make a Rapture to see a body change but he didn't just give a desire but he gave a direction to meet that desire we're not by yourselves trying to make a Rapture but God has placed a desire on your heart and given you something to meet the need giving you something to make that destination oh Hallelujah you see before the product is ever made there's the need for the product you see before the speaker was ever made there was something that needed to be there was a need that needed to be filled be fulfilled by their speaker the the inventor of the speaker didn't just say well you know what I'm going to make something I don't know what we're going to use it for but I'm just going to invent something that's going to that's going to relay my voice no he knew that there was the need for a speaker oh my God didn't send this message by accident God didn't give this direction by accident but he knew there was somebody on Earth that needed a doctor direction that wanted a direction there was a desire on the inside you know brother Branham says that only the predestinated will see this message he placed something on the inside that can only be responded that could only respond to the word his word responding to word you know brother Branham says whenever the eagle flew by the chicken yard and he says mother the baby eagle was in the chicken yard he says he looked up and realized it was Eagle to Eagle when he heard that scream he realized I come from that voice I come from that being and he says that's the way it is with the bride it's word responding to word when this a message come across your life it wasn't just another idea it wasn't just another opinion but it was the word the seed that was on the inside realized that's where I come from just like the eagle realized I come from that being I come from that bird the bride realized that this word that we're hearing it's a part of who I am oh oh something woman inside that responded to this direction you look at Ecclesiastes 11 and 3 in the clouds be full of rain they emptied themselves upon the Earth and if the tree fall toward the South or toward the North in the place where the tree falleth there it shall be in other words it didn't get there by accident if it's leaning that direction that's where its destination is going to be oh come on somebody if you're leaning towards the things of the world you can't expect your destination to be a rapture if you're leaning towards Dr Dobson you can't expect your destination to be a body change if you're leaning towards T.D Jakes you can't expect your body change to be your destination but if you lean towards the message not just lean but fall towards the message give everything you got towards this a message it will bring you to your destination oh my you may say what does focusing know it's the way you think the way you talk Where You Are as now I think the greatest president that we ever had was Abraham Lincoln not because he was a kentunkian but because there was a man come up from nothing in all the books that he ever owned from the time he was a young boy until the time he was of age almost was the Bible and bunions Pilgrim's Progress he says see that molded into him he says what that honest ape he says what you read what you do merge your character and tells what you are so what you feed upon what you focus on is emoting the character of who you are but the Branham says what is your character it's who you are when you're by yourself it's what you do when you're by yourself he says when nobody's looking your character expresses itself and he says watch God coming after he's coming after character so what influences you is emoting your character oh my I think if ever got a revelation of that we would be careful from what we listened to what we watch what we think about it's a Tonka it's consistently emoting our character you look at First Peter 3 or 1-13 wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ the word gerd means to secure it means to secure I'm not going to secure myself but just anything but God has given me something to secure myself with you look at Ephesians 6 and 13 wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day having done all to stand so in order to stand in this last day we've got to take the whole armor of God come on now we gotta take the whole armor of God in order to stand not just portions not just a little bit but the whole armor of God the next verse says this stand therefore having your loins Gert about with truth not man's opinions not men's ideas but we gotta gird ourselves with truth and you see why why do we gotta gird ourselves for because then the mind is where the reproduction happens brother Branham says hey before Eve ever before the act ever took place in the Garden of Eden he says she accepted it in her mind come on now so before you ever backslide if you backslide in your mind before somebody ever leaves the church it happens in their mind already oh my you see brother Sean's a probably a witness of this man back home we've had so many young people raised up throughout our church and that they they come up wearing skirts they have their long hair their wonder and influence but wait till they get 15 16 17 18. they started to leave the church and what happens they start putting pants on they start to cut their hair because the influence that they was focusing on was now disrupted by another influence you can come to church but if your influence is something else it's going to mold your character oh come on somebody well you see two times a week three times a week ain't good enough for you to make a Rapture it's got to be something that somebody is doing at their homes on their jobs when they're working wherever you're at your focus has got to be the message of the hour you see too many times we put all the responsibility on the pastor it's the pastor's job to pray it's the pastor's job to study the message it's the pastor's job to read the books and and to listen to The Prophet but it's not along the pastor the pastor ain't the church you're the church this building is not a church unless you're here and so God is coming after a bride that don't got spot and don't got wrinkled but that's not happening by The Prophet by the pastor's Revelation it's by somebody else getting into the message for themselves focusing their lives and their families and their homes on this a message you see not just the pastor not just the deacons not just the song leaders but there's got to be somebody else expecting a Rapture somebody else expecting a body change it's not just the prophet that God is going to raise up again it's mamas and daddies and sisters and husbands the God is coming after oh my hope this is okay this evening you see these things don't happen by accident this started to strike me whenever I was studying on these things it don't happen by accident Uncle Sean you didn't lose all that weight by accident it was him focusing and and being determined and letting himself know I'm doing this I've got in results I'm not happy with where I'm at but I've got a destination and there's got to be a church that is saying I'm not happy in the middle of this here I want to go home I want to get out of here but there's only one way we're going to get out of here that's through the message of the hour that's through the message of the hour we're not going to get out of here by man's Creeds and dogmas but there's got to be a focus we gotta focus on the right influence Hallelujah we gotta Focus brother Branham says that's how adultery says just a minute he says that's how adultery is committed spiritually when you knowing better by the word of God by the Intercourse of the Mind take a lie of the devil against the word of God that's exactly what Eve done with spiritual intercourse first they'll come by believing Satan's lie into the womb of her mind that polluted her soul Steph said into her so then the natural act took place he says before the natural act ever took place her soul was already polluted oh my we can preach there count me Uncle Sean before you ever tell a liar your Soul's already polluted before you already start gossiping and backbiting this and backbiting that one hey I'm preaching now before these things ever started happening your soul is already polluted because of the influence oh my soul before you start talking about this one and that one you're already polluted but I believe there's another influence that we can be under that we're no longer being polluted but we're being uplifted we're not here to be polluted we're here to be a city that is sit on a hill we're to be a witness of the resurrection power of Jesus Christ you see the same thing happened with Mary brother Branham says no it's Mary's room Mary's womb the physical mind scene was a virgin womb see or she believed God's word no matter how much anybody criticized how many things somebody else said and that didn't have one thing to do with it she believed God's word regardless oh I wish I could just get that over are you getting it see first was in her mind before the act ever took place in her literal womb the ACT had taken place in here what is what what is being influenced by the things of the world at your mind before I'm ever speaking it's my mind telling me what to speak before I walk it's my mind telling me to walk so whenever you're out in the world I hope this is okay this evening you see I believe that we can still be working on job sites how many's ever been to it to a grocery store and you hear a song playing and all of a sudden your your foot starts to happen to it it's not that you're listening to it you've never heard the song before it's that music that is influencing your body it's influence in your mind and now you're all of a sudden without even thinking about it you start to tap your foot or you ever work around people that cuss you never cussed a day in your life but you get upset and a cuss word pops up in your mind you might not say it but it pops up it's not that you're dwelling on those things but your influence that you're around and if you're not being girded up with the things of God those influences is going to start to merge your character to move somebody but if that can happen in the the colonel how can it happen with the spiritual or it can happen with the spiritual not by the things of the world but by getting in the thanks of God changing our Focus changing our diet changing our habits changing our influence and watch we become a Powerhouse for the things of God you want to see a Revival happen a Faith Tabernacle get under the right influence you want to see God move through the aisles move across the congregation get under the right influence the pastor ain't bringing the Revival the church is bringing the Revival come on somebody watch a church that gets together in one Unity One Accord under One Direction watch God come on the scene come on somebody watch God come on the scene to the 120 that was in the upper room the Bible says they were together in one Accord they weren't doing their own things they weren't divided you want to see the devil wreak havoc among the church let Division come come on now let the vision come and let this one get together and this one over here gets together and it's backbiting and I hope this is okay Uncle Sean this has taken place and there's division happening and that's why every Bible can't fall but let Brothers come together and sisters come together Unity come together watch the power of God watch the power of God fall in Faith Tabernacle hey you've got a Revival coming up you've got a tip meeting attempt me or Revival don't happen by accident but it's people under preparation for Revival now is the time to get our bitterness now is the time to get our gossip now is the time to say brother I love you you may have done me wrong but I love you I want a Revival I want to renew it I know I may have done you wrong but I'm sorry I want to get things right because there's a Revival coming up come on somebody these things don't happen by accident but somebody has to have a Direction somebody has to have a direction and I believe this message has given us a direction oh you see Uncle Sean don't get people in here that preaches the trinity that's the wrong direction he don't get somebody in here that preaches to be sprinkled that's the wrong direction how many to do that in our home lives come on somebody we know the direction that the prophet has given us oh my brother Brandon says influence one Minister's Wife let down and did this one Minister started so and so the rest just started oh my and we like us are here he says let nothing influence us but the word of God let that be our influence he says bring ourselves back to the faith back to the correction of the scriptures no matter what the rest of the world is doing he says let's let the word be your influence let the word motor character let this mode our character Hallelujah you're seen you see these things hope this is okay it don't happen by accident oh you look my opening scripture Proverbs 3 3 and 5 trust in the Lord with all thine hearts and lean not unto thy own understanding and so he's saying here there's got to be a choice where you're not leaning towards your own thoughts you're not leaning towards your own opinions but you've got to make a choice the next verse in all of thy ways so not just part parts of the ways not just when you're church but on the everyday life he acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy past so before he can direct your past you could acknowledge Him before he can give you a direction you've got to acknowledge Him and the word acknowledge means to recognize the rights or the authority of so before this message can give you a Direction You Gotta recognize it as your Authority not as an opinion but as your Authority as your direction then watch God start to lead you and guide you into this message you see you can't operate this message like a Creed and a tradition and expect it to Direction come on now you can't expect it to work for you if you're operating it in the wrong way you see where I used to do landscape Daniel the Landscaping we got zero turns you can't expect that zero tone to work if you're pushing it it's not meant to be pushed a push mower you can't jump and sit on it and expect it to work you can kick it and fuss about it and throw it in the trash and see that thing is crazy it's not working right it's not that it wasn't working right you was operating get wrong come on somebody we gotta operate it like it's meant to be operated Hallelujah we gotta operator you see brother Branham says we're miniature creators he says we can create an atmosphere he talks about I was reading earlier he was talking about how whenever he come home and his wife was in a bad mood because of the the children I believe and he says what he did was he went he started washing the dishes he started humming a song and he said watch the atmospheres change he created an atmosphere but then he said something that stood out to me he says that don't just happen at home but that happens in the church if that wasn't something that happened by accident he had a choice that said you know what I'm not letting this thing control me I'm not letting the situation bog down my faith I'm not letting this situation control me but I'm a miniature Creator and I'm going to create the right atmosphere but what about the church I'm not gonna let the first thing and this and that control me I'm going to create the right atmosphere I'm going to come to church and lift my hands I'm going to Worship the Lord I'm gonna say Amen to the preacher I'm going to say Amen to the pastor I'm going to create the right atmosphere because in the right atmosphere all things are possible we weren't healing but we don't want the right direction we want Deliverance but we don't want the right direction but create the atmosphere and in that atmosphere you can be healed you can be set free you can be repealed with the Holy Ghost you can have a renewing but it takes a choice it takes somebody saying I'm going to do this I'm going to create the right atmosphere I'm going to create and go in the right direction I want to see my family on fire I want to see my loved ones on fire I want to see my church on fire I want to see the glory of God fall like never before I want to see it happen so I'm going to do something about it I'm going to pray for the services I'm going to get up early before Sunday morning and say God anoint your pastor come on somebody I'm going to get here early on a Wednesday night and say God anoint the song leader anoint the preacher cause I gotta need the only way I'm going to get my need met is by creating the atmosphere oh my the only way I'm gonna see the Supernatural is by me doing something about it oh my do you believe that this evening we got to do something about it we got to let some things go we got to let the things go it reminds me of The Story of Lazarus the Bible says that Lazarus was identified as dead and I just love that portion of scripture Jesus never called him Lazarus he called him dead you never notice that his identity was gone because he was among the tombs his identity was gone because he was dead even though he had a previous identity but in his dead state that identity was gone but there was somebody that was coming to restore that identity and you notice what did Jesus say he come to the grave and he says Lazarus come forth the the the the the previous scriptures he was saying he's dead he's among the dead he that was dead he's continually calling him dead until he cries out the Bible says he cried with a loud voice it was that voice that restored the identity of Lazarus he didn't call him dead any longer but he caught him by his original identity and as that identity come to Lazarus he started to respond but you notice the story don't end there as they come out of the Tomb the Bible says Jesus looked at him and he says loose him and let him go but you notice the only part of the body that Jesus uh specifies is his mouth to notice that he says loose him and let him go he was bound with grave clothes and there was a napkin about his face about his mouth oh come on you can't Worship the Lord if you're in grave clothes come on somebody you can't sing if your mouth is bound you can't say Amen if your mouth is bound we've been called out their identity has been restored but we gotta let some things go Lazarus had to let those grave clothes go Lazarus how to let those things go he couldn't reconnected expect to come out of that tomb and to Worship the Lord in those gray clothes and neither can we expect to Worship the Lord if we're hanging on to bitterness if we're hanging on the complexes if we're hanging on to the things of the world I say it's time though we let them go and see I've been called out of the Tomb I've been caught out of sins I've been caught out of traditions and I'm leaving those things behind me I'm not taking them with me oh you see if you take things with you they're constantly going to be pulling you back you look at the children of Israel they was called out of Egypt but they still had things of Egypt that their heart was still in Egypt and they were constantly wanting to go back to the the task masters of Egypt that's what happens whenever you can't let things go you're constantly being pulled back in the opposite direction but they're seeing that if you can let things go we're not being pulled back we're not going backwards but this message is pulling us forward Hallelujah God is coming after a bride with the spot and without wrinkle he's given you a Direction let those things go it's time to let those behooled sins go it's time to let the bitterness go hallelujah it's time to let it go and follow the direction oh but what I love about the the story is it wasn't Jesus the loose Lazarus he anointed somebody to loosen come on now he said loose him it wasn't Jesus coming and physically losing Lazarus but under his voice under his authority he gave a five-fold Ministry the authority to loose them and to let him go come on now God has given you a pastor and under this voice there's an authority to loose you from complexes to loose you from the traditions of men to loose you from behind sins it's not that your pastor has a special ability it's under this voice under this a message has been an authority given to him Hallelujah and every time your pastor's getting up and preaching the message those grave clothes are coming off every time he preaches another message Another Sunday morning Another Sunday night another Wednesday night that napkin is coming off your face what is it that message that that that he's been commissioned with is loosening you and you can praise God like never before you can lift your hands like never before you can worship I can never before it's time to let those grave clothes go it's time to take the napkin off of your worship come on somebody It's Time To Worship it's time to praise but you can't do it with those old grave clothes Hallelujah oh my hope this is okay but the Branham says that's the reason we got so much perverted teaching of the Bible instead of coming back to the blueprints they've taken the spirit of some denominations see but the word is just as foreign to them as it was when Jesus come forth It's not that the word is gone but they've come under another influence come on what a brother Branham say how what did Jesus say they've made the word of God of no effect because of their Traditions it wasn't that their traditions did it it was the influence of their traditions and brother Branham says and they want to say the days the Miracles are passed and so forth let them go ahead and say it but let us do the service for the Lord they hated him because they were jealous of him that's the only reason they were jealous they were trying to destroy his influence before the people the same as they're doing now he says if faith can destroy the influence of the message before the people they've got this thing whipped oh mind you catch that he says if if they can destroy the influence of this message among the people this whole thing is whipped God sent the prophet gave indication after Vindication but if there's somebody under the wrong influence it's all in vain come on now that there's a responsibility not just on the pastor not just on the prophet but on us as individuals what is going to influence us Hallelujah what do we see when we're looking at it what do we see brother Brandon would say if men come out there he's talking about the the the brass serpent the Moses lifted up he says if men come out there and uh to look at it just as an item to look upon that serpent they would receive nothing he says but when the True Believer come out there and looked upon that serpent with the revealed spiritual truth that that serpent itself being that it was the form of the form of judgment from that from the serpent from the Garden of Eden the serpent was made out of brass that means divine Divine judgment see the altar was made out of brass which sacrifice was offered upon the brass Divine judgment but the only way that you could receive the benefits of that judgment was for you to look at it in the right way he says if they come out and looked at it as an idol it did nothing for him but I love how he puts it but when the True Believer come out there and looked upon it not a make-believer but a True Believer with the revealed spiritual truth something started to take place oh but the brand of preaches message after message he looked on the way to Jesus look I'm looking unto Jesus he continually is asking the question what do you see when you look what are you focusing on what do you see and brother Branham says here what do you see when you look some look the same when they look at him they look to see some great intellectual Church founder somebody who can really produce a Creed that will cause all the people to fall for this create something or another that's what they see when they look at him he says some look to see a myth like Santa Claus when they look out and they read the Bible and say oh that's a mythical thing it's just something that man wrote that's what they see what opinion you take of the Bible is what you take of him see some look to see a baby some look to see a rabbit or Santa Claus some look to see a historical book that was yesterday and not today but the question is what do you see when you look you can look upon it but it has to be revealed to you in order for you to see it you see if I'd never seen a microphone before I could look upon it but in order for me to understand it I would have to have somebody reveal it to me remember brother Branham tells the story about the uh John spro I believe he was walking through the garden overseas and he's seen a statue of Christ and he started to criticize it he says now there's no suffering to it there's nothing to that statue why would they even put that up there but then there was a guide that says you're looking at it the wrong way in order for you to see it like it's meant to be seen you got to change your direction you got to come down and Nila pee Altar and look up at him and as he knelt down and looked up at it he's seen this these scenes such suffering that'll broke his heart but in order for him to see the power of it he had to look at it the right way but in order for him to look at it the right way he needed somebody to direct him Hallelujah and there was a guide there that wasn't there for himself that guide wasn't there that point back to himself or to talk about himself but that guy's responsibility was to give him a direction to see the power of that statue and we had a messenger in this last day that wasn't pointing back to himself but he was pointing to Christ and saying look at the scripture this way not like a man man's Creed your ideas but he gave us a Direction Where We can see that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he changed the way he looked at scripture now we're no longer looking at an imaginary God but we see that Jesus Christ is not something in her imagination but it's a reality that he can still heal he can still set free the message has brought Christ back into Focus where we can see him through reality we're not trying to work something up not trying to work our faith up but this the message has brought our faith to us we can't help but believe for the supernatural we can't help but believe for the impossible we can't help but believe for the Rapture this a message has restored such a faith oh my John spro couldn't help but see the power of that statue he didn't have to work something up he didn't have to pray Hail Marys he didn't have to fast and pray all he needed was somebody to tell him how to look come on somebody you don't gotta work this up you just needed somebody to tell you how to look look and live look at Jesus and live Christ has been revealed that we gotta work something up for the semester to become flesh again no all you need to do is come under the influence of it man you can take somebody that drinks they may be the calmest the meekest person but let them start to drink it changes the way they act they didn't have to go to school for it but something influenced them you know my wife Loretta is from Ohio way up in the north you know so whenever she come to Oklahoma she didn't say y'all she didn't talk like a southerner but let her come under our influence she's been there for four years now now her sisters make fun of her because she sounds like a southerner she didn't have to go to a college she didn't have to go to a seminary come on now you don't gotta go to a seminary to make this message Live come on now God needs somebody to come under the influence of it how does that happen by focusing on it focusing your life on it focusing your time on it listen to the tapes and watch the message come off of the books off of the computers and into skins once again oh and it's becoming what you think about it's becoming what you talk about it's been come your ideas Hallelujah then watch God start to work through your skins watch God start your work and prove to the devil that he's got a bride on Earth how does how is God proving to the world that there's a bride on Earth through your skins come on now it's through your skins through your body through through your appetites through your everyday life you're proven to the devil the God is alive and is walking on Earth just like he did when Jesus was on Earth the message is influencing some lives hallelujah it's influencing some lives we're not working it up but we're being influenced by it are you being influenced by it this evening hallelujah it's changing to our it's changing our Outlook you see too many people don't like to change their focus because changing Focus means change means you're going to lose focus of this and now gain a focus over here I know we've got some hunters in the in the building up in Oklahoma we're going through our Hill and we're all looking through binoculars right we're all looking and he got got some of the boys like Austin and Nathaniel and I'm sure Judah is one of them every doe they see it's a monster buck and you can be looking at a buck over here but you hear somebody say hey look there's a buck and you take your attention off of this and look over here you may find the doe but you lost your buck come on now so changing Focus means you're losing sight of one thing and putting your sign on something else so putting your focus on the message means you're going to lose sights of your favorite opinions I'm preaching now putting your focus on the message you're losing you're losing sides of those feelings and the bitterness that you've held for years if you can just change your focus all of those things is going to fall away change in Focus means you might have to lay off on the makeup or or throw away the earrings or or throw out some clothes that's too tight changing Focus means change and that's why we don't like changing our Focus but if there's ever a time to change Focus it's now it's now is the time to put our focus on what God has given us in this last day if it rubs me wrong let it rub me wrong if it burns my high little burn my hide I've got a direction I've got a destination I've got a place that I'm wanting to go left this a message change me let it change me it's my focus let it change the way my address let it change the way I talk it's my focus it's my focus but the Bantam says we must focus our lives not on what somebody else says but focus our lives to him and he is the word see if we get our lives lined up with the word then the word and our life becomes the same it becomes the same so no longer is it the word doing its own thing and we're doing their own thing but our life has become one the Bride In Christ has become one like I said earlier my mouth only speaks what my mind says my body only moves to where my my head tells me to move but you take somebody that is brain dead the body is still capable to move but they can't move because they lost their brain they become brain dead and that's what happens oh my that's what happens when the bride of Christ gets away from the headship of the word they're not able to do the same things that Christ did but let a bride come under the headship of the word and it starts to operate under the word your link hands on the sick and the recovering you're casting out Devils to the serpents and harming you you'll be coming an invincible Army it's the body it's coming subjects to the head you become one of them the same it continues on to say if you abide in me in my word in you then ask what you will and it'll be granted to you verily verily ashamed of you if you say unto this mountain be moving down not in your heart but believe that what you have said will come to pass you will have what you said he says oh my not what I said but what you said you can have because you and he has become the same what a brother them say under your messenger you become the final voice to the final age you've become one and the same you're speaking the same words you've got the same actions you've got the same thoughts you've got the same destination oh my what's the Bible say but not one word will return unto me void but it's going to accomplish what it was sent to do oh my soul if you're tied to the word and the word is tied to you once it's accomplished what it's said to do it's going back to its maker it's going back to where it come from and if you're tied to it you're gonna go with it hey look at Jesus Remember uh the Bible says that God looked through the pillar of fire so God was in the form of the pillar of power but then God was made flesh and walked upon Earth but what happened after he was crucified and went back to Heaven he appeared a pillar of fire appeared before Paul and Paul says who art thou Lord he says I am Jesus whom thou persecute us so what happened after the word accomplished what it was sent to do he went back to its previous form come on now we're back to its previous form so once the word becomes flesh in you and it accomplishes what it's said to do you're gonna go back to where you come from you're going to go back to the mind of God you're gonna go back to that spotless State come on somebody if the word is Victorious and you're tied to it that means you can't lose there's nothing that can keep you out of this Rapture there's nothing that can keep you out of this body change if you're tied to it he continues on to save because the mind that was in Christ is in you in the mind that was in Christ was to fulfill the father's word which he was the word there you are then you and the word are focused in together you become a living units of God how great you become a living units of God not a statue but a living unit your mouth is only speaking what he says brother Branham says we must cope our lives and focus it on the word of God just like when we were to picture a picture of our camera he says try to get the right Focus before we snap in then we got the real true picture he says that's what we want to do is focus our life onto Jesus Christ then Christ in you become the same person Hallelujah Christ and you become the same person another quote he says then the church will be moving without friction without hurts without harms without doubts without Scruples oh my without friction he will be moving in the power of God manifesting every divine blessing God promised just like he would do we must do our lives then see him and seek him only not some Bishop not some great man something that or something we take pattern by but we look to Jesus Christ not some organization not some Pope not some work Bishop not some cranerberry but some other Divine men they'll be called on Earth but we must look to Jesus Christ and he is the word amen as the musicians come we must focus our life on one thing and he says then the church shall be moving without friction without hurts without doubts without Scruples he says it again without friction it will be moving in the power of God manifesting every divine blessing that God promised to do it how is he doing to brother Josh through the bride's body how is that happening by focusing and letting it influence your life brother Brandon says whenever the woman at the well whenever she come under Jesus influence it put her into action and she ran to the city and says come see a man who's told me all that I ever done the Bible says that the men of the city were saved because of her report how did that happen she was put into action by an influence no telling what God can do through your body through a young person through a mama through a daddy whenever we let Christ influence our lives that puts us into action amen that's about our heads this evening dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord thank you for giving us a message God in this day that's that's given us a direction God we're not wandering around in confusion we're not wandering around father trying to make our own way but you've

they they think it's a good thing they think it's it's of the Lord I think it's a better thing that we we know that it's nothing but damnation nothing but a heap of trouble and God's going to consume it with his Wrath and yet we've heard a voice come out of her my people change your focus change your direction [Music] he saw that we really wanted to go to heaven he saw that we really wanted to we

heaven say come John come up hither John oh my we've heard it that voice was giving us a Direction amen and I really like that and what Josh was saying there that brother John spro he needed someone
