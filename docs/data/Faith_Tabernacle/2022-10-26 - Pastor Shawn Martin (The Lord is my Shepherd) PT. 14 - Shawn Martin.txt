father and Lord on the other hand Lord let you anoint the hearts and ears of your people that they may receive of you we ask these things in your lovely name Jesus Christ amen and amen you can have your seats this evening and I'm going to just continue on the title the Lord is my shepherd and I'm going to again Focus on the the third verse and but we we see that the first and second verses uh Paints the picture for us of rest and David is at rest and he he's at rest because the Lord is his Shepherd and that's that is a representation of every one of God's sheep is that we come to rest as a sheep David saying that he belongs to the shepherd and notice where the Lord leads him as he does all of his sheep and that's in Green Pastures I think this is important that David would describe these things and then he would say he restores my soul because here David is saying that he makes me lie down in Green Pastures rest peace no worrying no fretting no no wondering no fear anxiety and this isn't a fairy tale that David is speaking of it's it's not you know the the the the the story of a Cinderella or or Jack and the Beanstalk and then you know I always at the end they live happily ever after and you know uh and but it's it's some figment of man's imagination but this is a reality that that that that there is a rest and and so David is not living on an island all by himself and and we're reading the scripture as though it it's some foreign language or some foreign thing that he's talking about and he's not living in the millennium he's uh you know he hasn't changed in to some Angelic being uh uh he's still living in his fleshly Tabernacle this is a man that is full of mistakes and failures and he's still dealing with the the problems of life and yet he is telling us that he's at rest and he makes me to lie down in in Green Pastures so he's he's made to rest and and David gives the expect explanation in this third verse and that is he restoreth my soul now I want to look at this uh in in a moment but again where is the place that David is resting it's in Green Pastures of course you know in in the book of Ephesians Paul uh talks about how that the Saints uh you know um they're they're in Heavenly places um he talks about us being in Christ Jesus and he's and and so David's not resting on uh Green Pastures he's resting in Green Pastures and uh when brother Brown I'm talking about this book of Ephesians being in Heavenly places being in Christ Jesus he would say that is the position of the believer ain't that right and so I'm going to take it as that uh in this that he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures and I I say that is position of the believer a man and of course Green Pastures are what uh uh his sheep feed off of and the green pasture is the word of God do you believe that it's the word of God Matthew 4 4 it is written Jesus says that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word everybody say every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God so the believer is positionally placed in the word of God and that's where the food is he's resting in the word now I'm going to just uh you you just uh bear with me but in in Revelations 10 8-9 we know it we've talked about it but John was commanded to take the open book that only the lamb was worthy to open ain't that right and was told to eat the book The Lamb had to first of all open the book ain't that right amen and then he sent it down to his seventh angel uh uh there on Earth and the seventh angel then had to reveal the mystery of God ain't that right and it was after this that John was told to eat the book A man so so our food is the revealed mysteries of God our food is not a closed book our our food is not a mystery that is still hidden a man that our food is the revealed word of God that no man was worthy Amen to to open this book up ain't that right and it's in there that we are made to lie down it's we are at rest in the revealed word of this hour amen and and so it's it's in Revelations 5 that when John looked upon the book A man that he got excited and he began to worship the lamb ain't that right the book was open and and John looked upon that book and and he began to shout he began to glorify amen uh it wasn't an empty worship it wasn't an empty shout a man he was he had something to shout about he had something to Rejoice about he had something to worship the lamb about can you say man and the prophet said he must have saw his name in the book amen now you know that put John at rest saw his name in the book amen and and that's what this whole revealed word is about is that we're seeing ourselves in the book can you say man we're resting that's our position is in the word of God Amen see we're we're resting in Green Pastures now uh Amos 8 and 11 uh says behold the days will come amen saith the Lord God that I will send the famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water but of hearing the words of the Lord or understanding The Words of the Lord and they shall Wander from sea to Sea and from the north even to the East and they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it can you say man so there these are a group of people that that that has no understanding with the word they're not made to rest in the word they're not made to lie down in the word but they're actually searching they're they're wandering from East and and and to the west and and uh uh you know running of seeking uh to and fro trying to find the word of God and the Bible says they will not find it can you say man they will not find it and and so they're not made to lie down because they're still searching for answers amen they they can't be at rest their heart's not at rest because they're still searching for answers ain't that right a man and and uh I I think we are the Most Blessed people a man to have answers in this day amen we've got the answer for the future of America we've got the answer to the future of the trouble that's going on we've got the answer as to why the churches are the way they are we've got the answer as to what God is doing we've got the answers to what the devil is doing can you say man amen that's right and so we find that these people they fast and they pray and and then they pray even more and they fast even more and they shut themselves in uh uh for long periods of time a man uh uh they prophesy of a great outpouring of the spirit of God that is to come they preached they shout they dance they and and and they have their their proactive uh uh uh meetings a bam but but see uh yeah they're not able to reach a man and to rest they're not able to come to a an absolute in their soul a man to where they're at rest but I tell you God's sheep is not in a famine can you say amen amen they're not in a famine we have been LED in Green Pastures that that is our position amen John was told to eat the book it wasn't his idea amen it wasn't just him going by his own feelings the Lord let him to take the book can you say man John knew where to get the book a man and he knew a man by a command of God and the leadership of God to take the book and to eat it can you say man in you realize in no other age no other age uh uh has anyone been commanded to take the book and to eat the bush can you say amen amen that's right now I know I believe it was uh maybe the prophet Ezekiel that ate the scroll a man but but it was in a type of of where we're at today can you say amen amen but but see uh it was it John was caught up in the Lord's day which was our day amen and he sees the the lamb to take that book and and open the seals and and and and and and and uh he sees that Mighty Angel which could only be Christ amen and send it down come down with the open book and hand it to that seventh angel and he saw the seventh angel began to reveal the mystery of God Amen and when the Mysteries was open can you say Amen John was commanded just like you and I are amen and to take the book and to eat it can you say man amen so no other age a man no one was told to eat the book because it was still in the hands of him that set upon the throne amen it was still sealed up can you say man that's right see and so the Lord will not lead you now I want to say this because a man John knew who that seventh angel was he knew where the book was amen the revealed mysteries of God Amen and God will not command this bride a man to eat any other thing amen than what that book says can you say Amen eat the book don't eat anything else just eat the book can you say man amen he will not lead Judy anything that's not first been given to the prophet of this age ain't that right for the seven Angel holds the food do you believe that Amen brother Rand even talking about he said you remember what that dream that I got the interpretation was go back and store up food where was The Storehouse this Tabernacle where is there anything like it in the country around here anywhere that will compare with the message that we have see now of course see our little brothers out here us along these other little churches or us were one he said where would you go to to find it say show its comparison anywhere you go right out into denominational Creeds you'll go right out away from the name of Jesus of the Lord Jesus ain't that right amen as soon as you left leave the message that's where you're going to go from amen out in the Creeds out into denominations out to Traditions out out to all of these things see amen he says and here is where the food has been stored up amen will one message he said that I preached you know he said preaching from one to six hours to you on a message well if I had to use one of those message see I'd take a week to take it and and just a little bit here and a little bit there because it's been stored up here it's on tapes it'll go worldwide on the tapes where people in their houses can you say man amen people in their houses see he said see them tapes will fall right into the hands of the predestinated of God he can direct the word he'll direct everything just exactly to its cores and that's the reason he sent me back to do this to store up the food here can you say man so we we find um uh uh that in the third verse David says you know he speaks of his soul uh uh being restored and and I believe that all of these uh the three scriptures verses tied together now I want to look at the soul amen uh again for uh a few minutes but brother Branham says that when man sinned he marred that Soul it was Blackness Darkness uh came into it it's the soul that is sinful amen and we know the prophet tells us that the soul is the nature of the spirit and so you are what you are in your soul not in your flesh but in your soul ain't that right so what we are in our soul when we die is what we will be when we meet the Lord ain't that right so you are a a man is a sinner in his soul and he is a Christian in his soul and you say man that's right now brother Branham says until the burning fire of the Holy Ghost has cleansed your soul from sin you're still a sinner see it's it's in the heart ain't that right now as we've already stated that we are a a a Triune being Body Spirit and soul now we we've stated this as well that the prophet says that the soul controls the spirit and the spirit controls the flesh so your your the throne room is not in your flesh not in your spirit it's in your heart or soul can you say Amen now I I I uh uh uh so you can tell who is on the throne of your heart by your desires I want you to really listen now by your desire you can tell who's on the throne room or the Throne of your heart by what your soul is feeding on by what your soul is thirsting for by what satisfies you you say man so if the word isn't satisfying then that means there's something wrong because the Holy Spirit only lives off the word of God now this is why David is saying he's made me to lie down in Green Pastures because he's restored my soul can you say Amen so David is showing that he is satisfied his desire has been met his his ambition or his craving has been satisfied and he is at rest ain't that right now you know brother Brown talks about you know uh the girl that uh talked to his daughter Sarah and her pastor had been to Africa and and when he come back this girl stripped off her clothes that night with a pair of little tights on and done the what what do you see or whatever for him to entertain him because he had been to Africa so this this watsu whatever is a tribe over there he says you know and boy I'd like to see one of my girls in my congregation try to do something like that he said see but it goes to show and the pastor that would sit and look at one of his congregation a little 16 or 18 year old girl out there stripped off like that and let her get by with that that shows that he come out of a cesspool himself for a man of God to do a thing like that see now now I'm trying to uh I hope I can make some sense tonight but see that man's Soul wasn't right so so what that was it was the old carry-on of the world I looked up that word carry-on it's it's it's actually the decaying flesh of dead animals now that's that's totally different from where David is because he's in the place of life Green Pastures then you say Amen but here this this young girl would strip for her pastor and the pastor wouldn't say a thing about it and you say man now the prophet says a vulture wants dead things and the people have shown what their control tower is and has shown what's in their soul for he said their soul everybody say their soul longs for things like that then you say Amen he says see they're so long if for a high intellectual Church where the people dress real fine and the pastor takes 15 or 20 minutes and if you go over that they draw him back on the Deacon board he mustn't say anything about Sin he mustn't say anything about wearing shorts and wouldn't say nothing about people doing this that or the other he must have mentioned that at all if they do the board will have him thrown out he said see what about all this caring on they've done today in the name of the church practicing square dancing in the church Bunko Bingo parties teenagers rock and roll twist and all this stuff look at the Elvis Presley a devil standing in shoes Pat Boone Ricky Nelson the biggest indement this nation has ever had they say oh they're very religious they sang Christian songs it aren't the church ought to even permit a thing like that some of these guys go out here and deny it in a Road House out here dancing and playing music and everything the next night they come to the Altar and weep and the next night they're playing music on the platform see yes sir see so he says see uh approve himself first to be a man of God not all this stuff just because he can beat on an old guitar or something like that but see it's what the soul is craving ain't that right they think it's okay for women to wear shorts to Bob their hair to wear their makeup they see no problem with with social drinking hello they have no issues with homosexuality they have no issue supporting things that's against God they they see nothing wrong with rubbing shoulders with the world but see the prophet would tell us it satisfies the taste of their soul ain't that right the desire remember it's the dove that cannot just fit in with anything because it has a certain nature that won't let it just have any old diet it's the crow that that can fit in in anywhere he is ain't that right Christians are not to try to fit in ain't that right so again the soul is the throne room amen of uh is the throne room so when the soul of man became black and smutty with sin it changed the spirit of man his thoughts were different his habits changed his way of life changed and his Spirit conformed to the change ain't that right then his body or his flesh conformed to the change but the change started in the soul of man he acted different he did things that he normally wouldn't have done ain't that right uh you know one thing that I I want to say is that your flesh does not define as to whether or not you're a Christian or a sinner your flesh does not define you that's the outside man and it is governed by five senses right taste feel hear smell see five senses that this old outside man this flesh is governed by a lot of times we look at that outward and we'd say that's a Christian or that's a sinner and yet you cannot Define by the flesh hello now your spirit doesn't Define as to whether you are a Christian or a sinner for that is governed by five senses as well what is it imagination conscience memory uh uh reasoning affection now think of that these five senses control that spirit ain't that right but then as the prophet would tell us but that soul only has one Inlet to it and that is free moral agency ain't that right you have the right to choose or to reject now notice and we all know that the flesh can have a form of godliness a Godly appearance about it ain't that right be bully uh Peter even talked about people in this day having a form of godliness going to church singing songs amen and the preacher performing all duties of religion and and and yet that's the outward you say Amen in this age you know or well people have gone as far as not allow open toe shoes for women they've gone as far as to say that a woman can't even wear a necklace they've gone as far as to say no rings and a man shouldn't have a beard shouldn't have sideburns some of them even have the belief is on strict rules on the way a man Parts his hair but see it's it's all a form of godliness on the outside ain't that right yeah yeah but then the prophet says but that soul could be as black as pitch ain't that right don't get me wrong I'd rather I'd I'd rather you know uh see those uh that have that that religion of long dresses even if they do wear their bonnets and all that I think that's more Godly looking than some striptease ain't that right but see people put that that as though that's all you need ain't that right and it's even come into the holiness where legalism where that's all they they focus on is the outward appearance but then we find that your spirit we've talked about it we know it but I'm going to say it again your spirit can be anointed with the genuine Holy Spirit and your soul be lost ain't that right brother Brown says church members want a denomination filter so that they can have their own desire and still be classed religious people and you hear them say oh he's very religious oh he's a Christian because they're looking at the two elements the outward appearance and what he is in his spirit hello and I said that about Elvis he's a Christian and yet brother Brown would say he's the devil in shoes standing in shoes ain't that right people get so mixed up which we were all mixed up before we come to the message they consider many of these Chris uh country singers and rock and roll Stars to be religious because they mix gospel in with their songs they put the name of Jesus in some of their songs and the church nominal accepts it can you say Amen why would they accept such a thing as this I'll tell you why their soul is thirsting for it you say man see brother Brown said something it's something down on the inside drawing and we're gonna get somewhere and I I I'm not going to keep you long but hopefully I can get my point see something is drawing pull it craving and brother Baron said the soul is drawing your resource through the outside down through the spirit into the soul now this is where you're a threefold being your eyes there's some people can't get their eyes off pornography so their their eyes are just constantly glued to it why because down in the not spirit in the soul it's feeding hello and that control tower in that soul that desire that craving is ruling over this body where they can't get their eyes out of the the books off the internet off the porn sites people can't get away from Gossip you hear you see people that just constantly gossip gossip gossip gossip why do they do this their soul is drawing hello and it's drawing through what we hear hello brother Rand says you know why why you know uh uh uh well first of all he says if the soul loves the world it's dead if the soul loves the world now most people don't take care of the Soul as we talked about they're trying to take care of the flesh they're looking at the Spirit and they reject the soul ain't that right they deny the soul the the fixing of the Soul so why does a man or woman smoke cigarettes it's to satisfy a desire right a crave a taste so then these companies and and brother Brandon talks about it in the think of man's filter these cigarette companies found a way to satisfy the taste ain't that right they come up with a filter to satisfy the taste of that smoker and to give them the taste they want now brother Branham would tell us so has the church have you ever just thought about why we got so many churches in the world today it's because they're trying to satisfy a certain taste ain't that right see it's it it's not just you know if if it was just a cigarette while one brand would be great they've got all these brands he goes some may not like this certain brand so they want this certain brand and they don't want that certain brand so they want this certain brand so there's all kinds of brands to fit the taste of the the the the uh the customer and it's it's come down to that same thing in religion if they don't get the taste they want then they don't want the cigarette ain't that right brother Brown said if they can't get the taste they want in religion they don't take the religion most of them they want women with shorts bobbed hair painted faces they want their women to be dressed sexy and the prophet said they love that they don't want their men acting like men they don't want the men to be the head of the home and to be that leader they call that dictatorship domineering can you say Amen I'm just going to throw this in to uh you know brother Brown says in in the book of Ephesians Paul you know of course he speaks of the mystery of a mystery there and that is the prophet says that how that a woman should reverence her husband you realize that's a mystery hello and it it must be a real mystery because very few women can do that in this day but I want to tell you men something too brother Brandon says then a husband ought to live such a life before his wife that his wife could reverence him as a son of God and if he doesn't live that kind of life hello then of course she wouldn't reverence him you don't demand reverence you don't demand respect that is given to you hello by the life you live so see she wouldn't respect him because she knows what he's made of but when it is a man that is a reverent man clean with his wife and before his family a real servant of God then the women the children and all should respect that servant of God with reverence but to Modern people's got a different taste they they they're not wanting this type of uh uh gospel hello so then we know that the spirit of a man can be absolutely anointed with the genuine Holy Spirit and the prophet said and make this outside body come into subjection hello now say that again the spirit can be absolutely Anointed with the genuine Holy Spirit and make this body come under subjection but Ezekiel 18 20 says the soul everybody say the soul the soul that sinneth it shall die ain't that right the soul that sinneth it shall die brother around says the soul that rejects and I want you to really listen now the soul that rejects in unbelief the word of God shall die ain't that right remember brother Branham telling us about the man who's just listening to it today but tell us about the man the two men that he uh he he first time going to a Pentecostal meeting and one man spoke in tongues the other man prophesied and he thought he's amongst Angels you know and he said I got to meet them two men so he met the first one he said man he said you know I have a way God gave me gave him a way to find out and as he was talking to him he caught his spirit and he said that man was a genuine believer man that's right so we met the other one and he must have been an arrogant turkey they asked brother Brian you've spoken tongue Chad no well you ain't got the Holy Ghost but he said as he began to talk with him he realized that man was the most hypocritical person right living with a a woman that was not his wife living in adultery had children by her and now I thought I was amongst devils right so see it it it it was a true anointing look at Balaam we talked about him how he was anointed but he was a false prophet his prophecy was right his Doctrine was wrong ain't that right so the anointing listen the anointing that came upon him could not bring him subject to the word of God to the word of the hour can you say man now this is where laodicea stands today the church Revelations 3 15 says I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that thou were cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth ain't that right because thou sayest I am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and no it's not that thou art wretched miserable poor blind and naked ain't that right have need of nothing Matthew 7 22. many will come to me in that day and say Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity so this of course is is has been a mystery to the church until the Prophet come and and and expose this and revealed it to what it is but Jesus was prophesying of this day and this is why it's the most deceiving age ever ain't that right because they are anointed with a genuine anointing brother Brown says that Holy Spirit can fall upon a man in his spirit but his soul everybody say his soul is his germ and that germ is the word he said so I don't care how much you can preach how well you do this and how much you love he said that's one of the inlets to Spirit you can't love with your body you love with your spirit that's one of the inlets and you can love and even love God and still not be right you can cast out devils and preach and do things and still not be right Jesus said so many would come in that day that word everybody say that word settles it and you say Amen see so your flesh nor your spirit being anointed of God tells whether you're a Believer or not look at that Jacob outwardly he was better than east or or Esau he was outwardly he was better than Jacob he was religious on the outside but on the inside look what he was ain't that right brother Ram said his thinking was not filtered my his thinking was not filtered see he thought that the birthright didn't mean as much as God said it did ain't that right see he should have filtered that thinking through the word of God that he was hungry so he says what different does it make don't Jacob you can have it ain't that right cast it all aside but it showed what his soul was it showed what he was down deep in that Soul can you say Amen brother Ram talks about Eve and Judas how they sold their Birthright to satisfy their Taste of knowledge of civilization he said eve sold it for a little taste of science a little taste of worldly knowledge and a little better church a little better class of people today it would be called Judah sowed his Birthright for 30 pieces of silver and uh uh to make a few extra dollars my congregation can pay me better over here I'll just preach over here see well if I become that preacher see there were ministers that told Brother Brown said well we believe the message you brought but if we were to preach that our our church would put us out it showed now think of that anointed preaching and yet it showed where the taste was they were tasting they their taste was for a popularity their taste was for a big congregation their taste can you say Amen I tried see and down in their soul The Taste even though they knew that the message was right The Taste was not for the revealed word of the hour ain't that right Brandon said or well Paul talked about how there are preachers that that have different motives as to why they preach preach they say they preach Christ they're preaching the gospel but down in their soul is where it's where it's all matters can you say man anointed yes but we're finding out more and more that these preachers that have preached under an anointing did not have the right taste for this message can you say Amen people that had been anointed and danced and shouted and woken away from the message it showed that their soul had a different taste all along is that right so we find that Judas being anointed to cast out devils and yet the son of perdition you didn't have the taste that Peter had see so you cannot judge by the outward you cannot judge by by how a man is Anointed but now let's flip the coin for a moment and look at the other side brother van said your still Sons and Daughters of God no matter how far you stooped in sin hello you are falling degenerated in your soul and mine but God is your creator Lutheran said in your Fallen estate you are a lost undone creation of God dominated by the devil right now think of that here's a prophet telling us that even though we were out in sin brother Bill drinking partying whatever you were degenerate in your soul your mind but you were a Son of God a daughter of God right and it may look like we were just like the rest of them and Paul said we were like the rest of them but yet the prophet still calls us Sons and Daughters of God Now isn't this the story of the woman at the well she was a prostitute that's what Jesus matter in that condition he met her when she was a prostitute an outcast ain't that right but notice God didn't make her a prostitute the devil made her a prostitute she come into this world a fallen degenerate inner soul and mind and Satan dominated her and made her a prostitute but inside of her soul was a gene seed of God that was predestinated before the foundation of the world ain't that right and when she saw the Messiah sign being done what did it do it quickened that Gene seed amen Prophet said quickly her sins were forgiven her ain't that right she said I know when the Messiah cometh he'll do these things and Jesus says I am he ain't that right now brother Branham says see she was putting the old scripture with the experience that Jesus was given to her and what did it do it made him the Messiah to her she was the way she was yes and by the outward appearance we could have looked and said there's no hope for her bitter taste was different hello she just hadn't met Messiah yet she just hadn't come to the revealed word of God yet and when Jesus showed her the accurate sign it quickened and satisfied the taste so he says he putting the old scripture with the experience that Jesus was given to her what did it do it made the Messiah and did you notice quickly her sins were forgiven because at the beginning she was redeemable everybody say she was redeemable she was redeemable see you couldn't look at her flesh it was down what was in that soul ain't that right and it showed that she was redeemable hope you understand that see you're not a Christian by your flesh if you are you're still a sinner right it redeemed her or brought her back when she seen the express scripture manifested of Jehovah what he was and what he is she didn't say Sir you're Beelzebub right she said I perceive that you're a prophet and when Jesus said I am heat there was no more doubt you didn't have to explain it she saw it she believed it hello is that where you're at amen David was satisfied he saw it he believed it that's where this bride is today she's she saw the revealed word of God she knows that the lamb has opened the book and she's not looking at a closed book she's looking at a revealed book and she's seeing not only the lamb but she's seeing herself and not only she's not just seeing herself apart from the lamb she is the Tabernacle of God himself can you say Amen she's seeing this she's seeing the unfolding not just the Melchizedek Ministry on and not just putting the Sun a minute son of man Ministry to brother Branham but the word is taking a hold in her satisfied so I'm going to tell you something if people start questioning this message questioning these things to you don't you look at that as wisdom you look at it as they're not being fed in their soul it Satan will reason the word with you he'll reason it until till he's got you in such a a a a a a trap can you say man amen but when when Satan came to Jesus and started questioning now you know he did he started questioning the devil always questions the word that's how he gets you every time he'll question he'll question your experience he'll question if God loves you he'll question whether you're not you're a Son of God he questioned Jesus on that if thou be the son of God what was he doing he was trying to put questions but Jesus wouldn't listen to them questions he would answer right back it is written can you say Amen what did he do he put a balance to the word of God Satan took the scriptures and put it way over there and way over there but Jesus would put it right back into balance and notice when she caught it brother Brown says no more doubt you didn't have to explain it she saw it she believed it and away she went why what did it do to her it redeemed her it redeemed her ain't that right see it showed that she was a fallen thought of God before the foundation of the world I I'm not I'm not going to say that maybe you know uh well well I I don't believe that the scriptures never said she ever went back to prostitution again never can you say Amen why her soul was restored ain't that right her soul went from being a degenerate soul to a restored soul which brought her body under subjection to the word can you say man now see he came to be a redeemer what does redeem mean to bring back why did he get in the pre why didn't he get the priest he was never up there he had no representation you say man listen he came to redeem that which had fallen and in the fall this this girl got messed up that God had her in his thinking before the foundation of the world and he come to cleanse her she everybody say she had eternal life I hope that helps I hope it makes some sense to you she had eternal life now I know she's you know she probably had scars in her body or whatever from being a prostitute or whatever she in the past or spirit and all these things bringing up the memories and this and and all of these things you haven't just as much but the soul was satisfied the soul right in order to be sheep see it has to come from the soul in order to follow the shepherd it has to come from the soul Psalm 63 8 David said my soul followeth hard after thee my soul God never intended us for us to be led by our five senses you must not everybody say I must not be led by what I see by what I hear by what I feel hello you must not be lit by your affections by your memory hello you must not be led by your reasoning right now listen this flesh can still be tempted red Brown said you make many mistakes ain't that right but the soul has been restored amen the soul ain't that right now we can all I hope I believe that we can we can say with David my soul follow his heart after thee my soul you say man see if these senses are trying to lead you away from what God Said for this day then stay with the word is that right and brother round talks about that outside man he says the outside man feeds on things that see it it makes the Inside Man see it it feeds on things at the the Inside Man doesn't the outside man he says feeds on psychology and intellectual right whereas the inside man that spiritual man feeds off the word of God so you see why I hit psychology a lot if you want psychology there's there's other places you can have that a prophet said it's the outside man that feeds off that and intellectual we got smart men in this message trying to bring psychology in but the spiritual man noticed the prophet said see if you give him the spiritual man the right of way he might lead you to a little Mission somewhere where there's not many people but the spirit of the Living God is there the Lord yes sir and you say Amen so he separates the Holy Spirit from psychology so when they say the Holy Ghost is the greatest psychologist there ever is that's coming from intellectual Minds now listen what made you desire God in the first place I'm going to close but what made you desire God you know as the Bible says we were born in sin shape and iniquity come into this world speaking lies ain't that right and you know brother Brian said that we we we had no uh we had no chance in life not when it comes to that our birth was wrong the nature everything it was wrong but see you desired God he says because down deep inside your soul was a predestinated seat of God now say your flesh the flesh Works contrary the flesh only has the five senses to contact this earth right so if you're ever going to try to find God and walk with God by your five senses by what you see taste smell here and all that you'll never do that well then your spirit see has them five inlets and and it it can be anointed and yet not walk with God not not not come subject to God he can anoint you you can own a man well to where he prophesies the body comes under subjection to that and he can dream a dream he can prophesy speak in tongues he and to be right give him the word test though [Music] when that anointing is off he's still arrogant but he cried he shed tears he'd come to an altar but when that anointing lives watch what is in his soul what is the taste what is the desire what is the craving you with me but you've desired God because down in your soul there was a predestinated seed which was eternal life that was always laying there so Jesus said my sheep will hear my voice a stranger they will not follow because there is life down in the soul you'll never be able to be educated enough to be sheep you'll never be able to be taught by the greatest teachers of today to make you sheep you'll never be able to listen to tapes long enough to make you sheep you can read this Bible backward and four two times a year it'll never make you sheep right but the desire come because there's a predestinated seed bird brown said life connects with life sin connects with sin and sin is so hypocritical until it thinks it's saved when it isn't saved it's in the very depths of hypocrisy right now notice as I will let you go brother Brian says just as there is the eternal life there is also Eternal death for the people not eternal hell Eternal death and he talks about how that many people are religious today out in the world that has always been dead and will remain that way because it's Eternal death First Timothy 5 and 6 break it in she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth knows what brother Brown says now he said he has a lot to say about it but this is just one and and so I'm not going to take a lot there but he says the woman that liveth in pleasure with her bobbed hair painted face is dead while she's alive the Bible said so she may be religious but she's never was saved she's got an outward motion she might sing in the choir she might dance in the spirit she might speak in tongues and have all the manifestations of the spirit but unless that Soul on the inside is is God's daughter she is gone no matter what she does hello outwardly Israel was all spiritual they were filled with God's goodness they reverenced God and so forth but that didn't work brother Brown said it was the inside of them they couldn't recognize the word itself is that right outwardly they had it all but on the inside they could not recognize the word and remember when the Giants come they were at unrest and every problems come unrest because they couldn't recognize that the word of God was leading them are you with me now as I close what made you come to the message and leave it what makes you follow the shepherd on the inside of the inside something began to draw something begin to call can you say Amen Abraham said it was something that told you there was a god somewhere and you began to read his word which is God's filter he said when you take God's filter and draw your life your desires if you draw your desires through God's filter they think in men's filter there is nothing left but the Holy Ghost now if you want the evidence of the Holy Ghost there it is when that soul of yours will line with the word of God in every respect it shows that you've drawed your life through the thinking man's filter God's filtered his word then that shows that in you was that predestinated seed down in you that makes you hunger for God how many hungers for God younger for God now brother Brian tells you why because there's a predestinated seed down in your soul all that the father hath given me to redeem they died with me at Calvary they raised with me in the resurrection and all that he has given me will come to me and they'll be placed in the body where foot arm nose mouth whatever it is they'll be placed in there and they will come to me in their seasons and you say Amen and notice all the sin of the world is dead all the love of the world is dead why it's in your soul so David is saying my soul has been restored I'm not setting in the word I'm not setting in the revealed word of my age or my day I'm not in the Green Pastures looking around saying man I wished I had something else I'm finding that the more I I see the word of God the more I feed off the word of God the more contented I am the more solidified my heart is can you say man my soul has found the right taste and it's drawing from that source I don't want to look at the old filth anymore I don't want to be around the old filth anymore I I just don't that's not my taste I have found the right thing then you say man I found it and I found out it wasn't a preacher that you had done it I had eternal life from the foundation of the world and I did not reflect that eternal life because I didn't know but when the word flashed across my path quickened can you say Amen if the musicians will come I hope it was all right I hope it made some sense to you brother Brown says when a thinking man begins to think who he's going to stand before and what the word of God is when he begins to think then when he draws through that there's nothing can get to it but the Holy Ghost what is it it's the germ seed word from the beginning that you was in God at the beginning standing here drawing the seed life the seed is in your heart by four ordering of four ordination the seed is already in there by the foreknowledge of God predestinated and when it draws it can't draw through nothing else but the word I'm really going to Anchor that I'm I'm Really Gonna by God's grace we'll get more into that but there's nothing that it draws from but the word so nowhere no matter how I feel no matter what I'm in no matter what the day is my soul draws from the word alone did not Abraham do the same his body grew weaker he considered not the deadness of Sarah's womb he didn't consider himself getting older and more feeble his soul kept feeding off the promise can you see man so he says see then it's the taste of the thinking man the righteous man the holy man who sees the Bible that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and forever what comes into that place down there talking about your soul that word that's in the heart I've hid my word in my heart that I sin not against thee can I ask you something what good would it be for David to sit in the Green Pastures if he was wanting something else what good would the shepherd what good would it be for the shepherd to lead him in Green Pastures and the Shepherd in his mindset these Grays and Green Pastures will fill their belly up this Green Pastures will provide strength for them these green pastors will give them a rest so he leads them by his own intelligence and then somehow the Sheep [Music] what good would it be for God to open the word to you don't eat it can you say man he so Vindicated the word of God in this age that you can sit and count Every Man a liar that is contrary to this word and say my soul rests upon this ain't that right man so he says see then he's tasted see he says the only thing that can pass through the word is the Holy Ghost and the think of men's filter gives the holy man A Taste then he's tasted of the Heavenly things he's got the word of God in his heart he sees it manifested before him and his whole soul is wrapped into it and the world and all things is dead around him then you say man I said see it satisfies his taste he sees that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever there it is see him right before us doing the same things he did it satisfies the holy man's taste his thinking he knows then that he's passed from death and unto life and he loves he wants the word to be confirmed and Vindicated see that's what that's what the Sheep of God laughs [Music] Walker we've been around that Pentecostal nonsense we've seen what they would do guessing and this and that hitting and missing we've seen the scare tactics buddy I've seen it I've seen it when a pastor or preacher wants an altar call he just all he does is scare the people hang them over hell and the same people that was at the altar last week are at the altar again and it's just a rigmarole it's just constantly that way the people ain't getting anywheres feed off the word satisfied can you say man you love him amen what song [Music] As the deer pan is for in all of his mistakes is short come his soul was hungering for God hallelujah hallelujah [Music] my shield to you alone does my spirit you foreign [Music] oh you are my friend and you are my brother even though you are my king thank you [Music] I love you more than you the others so much more than any for you
