And we think how the prophet taught us that Christ the mystery. If you can't read Jesus Christ in every verse of the Bible, go back and read it again because you missed something. He's the he's the very heartbeat of God, the nature of God. He's the the manifestation of God.

Praise God. &gt;&gt; You know, I believe we ought to all have that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That that confession in our heart that &gt;&gt; he makes me feel so special &gt;&gt; in a world dying.

Angry winds around did blow. All on board were filled with fright as the mighty billows rolled. Then they called upon the one who the winds and waves control. When he reaches out his hand, Bill cease at his command. Winds and waves obey his will. And he says to them, "Be still." What man is this they all did say that the wind and seas obey. [Music] He's the one who sails with me. [Music] He's the master of the sea. Though the storms of life may rage and the billows round you roll, he can calm life's trouble.

Ain't you Ain't you thankful we serve a God who's the master of everything? Amen. &gt;&gt; He masters everything, controls everything by his spoken word. Amen. Ain't you glad God sent us a message in this hour that would bring us to the to a place that would bring us to the that we could be presented to God as Paul said, a spotless virtuous wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Presented unto the king. Right. &gt;&gt; What a what a blood that would be shed that would cleanse me and you in such a way &gt;&gt; that we could come before him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With nothing in our way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I sure love you. That be all the music. We sure love the Lord.

So, I'm not &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. Thank you. &gt;&gt; All right. Yeah, we It's not cold enough for coach yet. Amen. Sure is good to see each and every one of you. We're thankful that God has given us the ability for another gathering together. You know, &gt;&gt; what a gathering. As the prophet said, where the carcass is, the eagles will gather. Amen. &gt;&gt; Turn with me to St. John chapter 11. I'd like to read a few verses here. Lay a little groundwork. I'm getting a little feedback somewhere. I don't really need monitors because I don't pay any attention to none of that stuff. You might blow them up. [Music] Amen. You could probably get away with cutting the mic off if it wasn't for the sound system, but I don't have any problem with with that by God's grace. Amen. As we look at this, Jesus is here. He's always on time. We look, we realize that and we hear that that it comes and we starting in St. John 11 starting at verse one. He says, "Now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany, the town of Mary and his sister Martha. It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with an ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick. Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. When Jesus heard that, he said, "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby." So see all sicknesses are not under death but to bring glory unto God &gt;&gt; and to magnify him and to bring forth and show that the power that God has that he can do anything anytime anywhere and anytime he wants to do it. Listen he says now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. When he heard when he had heard therefore that that he was sick, he abodeed two days still in the same place where he was. Then after that saith he to his disciples, let us go to Judea again. His disciples say unto him, "Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee, and thou goest thither again?" Jesus answered, "Are there not 12 hours in a day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world." But if a man walk in night, he stumbleth because there is no light in him. &gt;&gt; These things said he, and after that he said unto them, our friend Lazarus sleepeth, but I go that I may awake him out of sleep. Then his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. How be it God How be it Jesus spake of his death. But they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest and sleep. Then saith Jesus unto them plainly. Lazarus is dead. And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there. Now see there was a purpose. He could have went right ahead and went right and done it and could have just sat there and spoke the word and Lazarus would have come right up and he wouldn't even had to go. But he was a purpose. He told him for the purpose that it might bring glory unto God. He said, "I'm glad for your sakes that I was not there to the intent ye may believe. Nevertheless, let us go unto him." Then said Thomas, which is called Ditimus, unto his fellow disciples, let us also go that we might may die with him. When then when Jesus came, he found that he had l that he had lain in the grave four days already. Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem about 15 furongs off. And many of the Jews came to Martha to comfort them concerning their brother. Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet went and met him. But Mary sat still in the house. Then said Martha unto Jesus, "If thou hadest been here, my brother had not died. But I know that even now," I want to take those two words. Even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee. &gt;&gt; Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again. Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection. At at the last day, Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection &gt;&gt; and the life. He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believeth thou this, she saith unto him, Yay, Lord, I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God, which should come into the world. And when she had said so, she went her way and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The master is come and calleth for thee. And as soon as she heard that she arose quickly, and came unto him. Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but in the place where Martha met him. And Jesus and the Jews then which were with her in the house comfort her, and they saw Mary, and she rose up hastily, and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there. Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou had been here, my brother had not died. Then Jesus therefore saw her weeping and the Jews also weeping which came with her. He he groaned in his spirit and was troubled and said, "Where have ye laid him?" They said unto him, "Lord, come and see." Jesus wept. Then the Jews be behold how he loved them. And some of them said, "Come not, this man which opened the eyes of the blind have caused even even this man should not have died." Look, there was already doubting, already complaining, already murmuring if he' come. He was there. &gt;&gt; There was nothing going to stop for when he got there, the problem was solved. &gt;&gt; He was the He was the King of Kings. the Lord of Lords. He said, "He's not the God of the dead, but of the living." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave and a stone lay upon him. Jesus said unto him, "Take away the stone." Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinkketh. Lord, you're too late. We prayed and we prayed but you didn't come. But now you've waited too long because they believed after three days the fourth day the spirit was gone and there was no hope to be raised from the dead. Then it says Jesus said unto her I not I not come unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou shouldest see the glory of God. Then they took away the stone. Huh? They took away the stone from the place where the dead l dead was laid. Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, "Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me, and I knew that thou hearest me always, because of the people which stand by me, I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me." And when he had thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave clothes. And his face was bound with a napkin. Jesus saith unto him, "Loose him, and let him go." Then many of the Jews came to Mary, seen these things which Jesus did did, believed on him. But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees and told them what things he had done. &gt;&gt; Father, Lord Jesus, it's your turn, Lord. Father, I've done all that a man can do, and that's read your scripture. Father, your word is already inspired. Your word is already anointed. But Father, I'm asking you to come now, Lord, and anoint me in such a way, Father, that it would not be a man speaking, but it would be God speaking through a man. &gt;&gt; And I pray, Lord, that you'd not only anoint the speaker, but you'd anoint the hearer. and that you'd bring forth in such a way your word that we'd have all a testimony when this is over and done with. Did not our hearts burn within us as you spoke to us along the way. Now grant it to us in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen. Apologize for the lengthy reading, but there's so much in there to get the point down. You wanted to read out what all was going on force. Now, there was a commission went out. There was a call. There was a asking that he would come. &gt;&gt; And the great heavenly father, when we always called him, he's coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He may not come when we think he's going to. He may not do it like we think he's going to do it, but he always does what his children ask him to do if it's according to his will. &gt;&gt; And we see here that here was Lazarus. They didn't understand what was going on. Even the even his disciples were scared. They was worried because they didn't want Jesus because they seen the Jews was out to kill him. And they was afraid, don't go there. If he's sleeping, he's all right. But see, even by the words he spoke, they still didn't have the understanding of what he was speaking. Just like people say, well, we'll just take this Bible without the understanding of the Holy Spirit, the guide, the Holy Ghost. We cannot understand &gt;&gt; what the word's saying. because he said, "Behold, I'll send unto you a guide, &gt;&gt; and he shall lead and guide you into all truth." &gt;&gt; That's the guide. That's the one we need. &gt;&gt; And they didn't understand it because the way he spoke it to him, they said, you know, he told them sleeps. He was asleep because really a Christian cannot die. &gt;&gt; For the Bible even says when they stoned Steven said they didn't say he died, said he went to sleep. But they didn't understand that. But God had to show them, look, I'm going to show you something that's going to bring glory to the father. I'm going to do something that you'll know that I'm in the father and the father in me. &gt;&gt; I'm going to prove to you all of your superstitions and all of your thoughts, nothing is too hard for God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. And we see that as Martha she came she came to you know she come and she come to Jesus and she after he was coming down to there four days seemed like you know everything was even though she he told her what you know that he was the the bread of life and and she spoke to him in verse 22 and says but I know that thou evens now whatsoever will ask of God, he'll give you. &gt;&gt; She's saying, "I don't understand. I can't explain it. I can see it with my eyes and it's not possible. But even now, brothers and sisters, even right now in this service, &gt;&gt; whatever you ask God, God can give it to you." &gt;&gt; God is a God of now. &gt;&gt; God is a God that helps us in the time of troubles. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be going through trials. You may be going through heartaches as we all do. But even now, you can have the victory. &gt;&gt; Even now, you can overcome &gt;&gt; because there's been a word sent to us. &gt;&gt; There's been the spirit of God has come upon us. &gt;&gt; And we have the opportunity today to say the same thing she did. We don't understand what we might be going through right now. &gt;&gt; We can't explain it. &gt;&gt; We can't see the end of it. But God, even now, because you said it, I believe it, it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; We need to have a true confession. See, the prayers that went forth, they had been prayed. And sometimes the prayers will go forth and it looks like they ain't no answer. &gt;&gt; Looks like the ceiling, they go no higher than the ceiling. The heaven is brass, &gt;&gt; right? But even now, &gt;&gt; God's hearing. &gt;&gt; Nothing is hindering him from hearing your prayers. &gt;&gt; And he told us, even when the weakest Christian &gt;&gt; gets on his knees, hell begins to shake. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, it's not by might, it's not by power, but it's by his spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even now, God can change. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even now, God can heal us. &gt;&gt; It may look like you may have got a report from a doctor. There's no way it can happen. &gt;&gt; There's not no way possible &gt;&gt; it's going to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But God said even now &gt;&gt; it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Ain't she thankful for the word of God, the truth. &gt;&gt; She didn't understand. She even said by now he smells &gt;&gt; maybe your problems become so hard on you this morning &gt;&gt; fault you so much that your problem has become stench to you &gt;&gt; it smells so bad looks like there ain't no way I'm going to get out of this &gt;&gt; but even now &gt;&gt; God's still a deliverer &gt;&gt; even now God's still a savior &gt;&gt; even now God's a healer &gt;&gt; even Now God gives the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Even now God delivers the oppressed. &gt;&gt; Even now God sets the captive free. &gt;&gt; We don't serve a God of history. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We serve a God of now. Brother said, "That's our problem, brother Amos, is we look, we're looking back at what he done." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're looking forward to what he's going to do. But we're failing to see what he's doing even now. &gt;&gt; Right now, he's doing something &gt;&gt; in this service. right now he's dealing with somebody &gt;&gt; right now he's speaking to a heart &gt;&gt; you may be battling with maybe you fighting have a problem desiring for your husband to come back &gt;&gt; even now God can do that &gt;&gt; praise the Lord &gt;&gt; your wife may be strained off even now God can bring her back &gt;&gt; your son may be gone off astray but even now God can bring him back &gt;&gt; your daughter might be seem to be lost may look like all situations may look like it's just got worse and worse and worse. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; To the place of where it looks like there's no hope. &gt;&gt; But there's always hope as long as there's breath in that body. &gt;&gt; Amen. I remember when my mother prayed for me and brother Amos and I was out in the world and things, you know, and it got seemed like it got worse and worse and worse. And she'd go to the pastor and say, "Brother, seems like the more I pray, the worse he gets." And it seems that way cuz Satan's showing, "Look at your prayers ain't being answered. You've been praying for your son. You've been praying for your daughter, your husband, your wife. You've been praying for this situ this sickness. You've been praying for this situation. It's just got worse. &gt;&gt; You know why it's got worse? Cuz God's coming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right before it gets better, it gets worse. &gt;&gt; Lazarus situation got worse before he come because that he knew he was going to come. &gt;&gt; And Satan was going to say, "Look, I'm taking him." Jesus said, "Go ahead and take him, but you can't take him far. You can only take him as far as I let you have him. &gt;&gt; And he said, I'm going to allow this that bring glory to the father. &gt;&gt; I'm going to reveal something to them that no matter how many days have passed or how long it you think it took me to get here, &gt;&gt; preach. &gt;&gt; I heard you when you first asked me. &gt;&gt; I heard you when you commissioned me to come, but I was tearing trying to see if you still had faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; Faith comes through trials and tribulations and patience work us all that we sometimes we we pray for patience. Then look for trials. &gt;&gt; And I like it like this. You know what? Satan is only battling those who he can't defeat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not battling them that he's already defeated. &gt;&gt; He's already He's battling you because he he he don't want to accept it. But he cannot defeat you because God said, "I've overcome. You'll overcome also." &gt;&gt; And we'll overcome by the word of our testimony and the blood of the lamb. It's according to how we approach that trial. When something happens, &gt;&gt; if we'll approach it like Job did when all that hit him, he didn't he didn't accuse God. &gt;&gt; He didn't argue with God. It's amazing that his reaction to all of that when he lost his family, when he lost his children, lost everything he owned. The Bible said he fell on his face &gt;&gt; and he didn't complain. The Bible said and he worshiped &gt;&gt; God. That's how you defeat Satan in your trial &gt;&gt; is when you begin to worship God in your adversities, in your dark trials. When you begin to say, "God, even now, &gt;&gt; you're able. &gt;&gt; You're more than able to bring this situation and turn it around." &gt;&gt; God, we're not looking at it by sight. We're not looking at it by feelings. We're walking by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Believing that whatever you have started, you will finish. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Ain't you thankful for that? The Bible said, "He who hath began a good work," it wasn't Amos that started a good work in his life. &gt;&gt; Wasn't Richard that started a good work in his life. He began it. G. &gt;&gt; And when Satan comes at me and starts battling me, Sister Kim, and he starts telling me, "You ain't going to make it. Ain't no hope for you." I said, "How can I quit something I didn't start?" &gt;&gt; You tell him to stop. &gt;&gt; He's telling me to keep going. &gt;&gt; You're already defeated. You already been whooped. &gt;&gt; And I said, "Greater is he that's in me than he that's in this world." &gt;&gt; He that's in me is greater than this. &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; It looked like all hope was gone. &gt;&gt; Was no hopes at all. He said, "I am the resurrection life." She thought it was going to be, you know, when the raised from the trumpet sounds and they going to come up. But he's showing, look, right now, &gt;&gt; I can raise the dead. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Right now, I can open the blind eyes. Right now, I can make the deaf hear. Right now, I can make the mute speak. &gt;&gt; Right now, I can make the lame walk. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Right now, I can create ankle bones. &gt;&gt; In a boy that was born without ankle bone. &gt;&gt; I'm a testimony of that. They can't say, brother Amos, that God didn't do it. &gt;&gt; There it is. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother said we'd see missing limbs restored. There it is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God created it. &gt;&gt; The doctor said there ain't no way, no way possible. Here's our X-ray. This boy here, he has no ankle bone. He cannot walk. He will not walk unless he walks on crutches or some kind of braces. And my mom and dad said, "You do what you can do, doctor, and we'll let God do what he can do." &gt;&gt; They said, "Well, we'll put a cast on him. We can straighten his legs." My legs just hung. My foot just flopped. You couldn't walk if you didn't have no ankle bone, club foot, and nothing there. You'd have to have something to stabilize it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So here they gone and they said took me through the prayer lines and had the ministers pray for me like the Bible says anoint the &gt;&gt; sick with oil &gt;&gt; still works even now it works. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; 2,000 years later it's still working. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, here they come. And so, they cut that cut that off. And the doctor said, "I don't believe it." Said, "There's an ankle bone there. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus." &gt;&gt; And God got the glory for that &gt;&gt; because that back then they couldn't give you prosthetic hips and knees and all those things. &gt;&gt; God said, "I'm going to do something greater than that. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give him something he didn't have, but I'm going to show that I can give what you come without. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; And this morning, when if you come without something you need, God's here to give it to you. &gt;&gt; Even now. &gt;&gt; Even now. You don't have to leave empty. You don't have to leave disappointed. &gt;&gt; Even now, God's able to do whatever you need. &gt;&gt; And so, all we got to do is believe. &gt;&gt; Believe. &gt;&gt; If we can believe, we'll receive. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know that's he had to have he was just looking for somebody to accept that he was more than able. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And they they didn't they wasn't even when he got there they wasn't expecting to be raising the dead. They was going thinking she's going to mourn. We're going to go with her. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Jesus said he's thinking Lord maybe there's a stone in front of you today. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Like there was Lazarus. Maybe you're dead in sins and trespasses. &gt;&gt; Maybe you're in a place right now and there's a stone in front of you. Maybe you're at a place where your experience has died down and you've come to a place where you're where you're weary and you're you you've lost your joy and you've lost your p uh peace and Satan's put you Oh, glory be to God. Satan's put you in put you in a tomb. &gt;&gt; He's rolled a stone in front of you. He's told everybody that brother's dead. He can't serve God no more. He sat under this message for years. He's dead. He's died out. &gt;&gt; Preach. &gt;&gt; But even now, &gt;&gt; he said, "I will restore, sayeth the Lord." &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Not later. Even now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Mary didn't understand when she come and he said, "Behold, you'll you'll have a child." not knowing a man. She said, "How can this be? How can this be?" &gt;&gt; He had to get her faith built up by telling her, "Look, Elizabeth, your cousin has wanted a child for a long time. Even now, is pregnant." &gt;&gt; Come on now. and said, "I've come for the from the presence of the Lord to tell you this that you're blessed and highly favored." &gt;&gt; Ain't that what this message come to tell the bride? &gt;&gt; Said you're blessed and highly favored. &gt;&gt; And guess what? You're impregnated now. &gt;&gt; You're fixing to bring forth the son of God. &gt;&gt; We've been impregnated with this message. Nothing else can impregnate us no more. No thoughts, no man's ideas, no man's understanding, no man's uh understanding, no man's uh way of saying things. No way can he how can they talk you out of it? &gt;&gt; They didn't talk me in it. &gt;&gt; That's what I say. How can you talk me out of it when you didn't talk me in it? &gt;&gt; Brother Brown said, "If a man told it to you, another man can take it away from you." &gt;&gt; But no man gave me this. Just like Peter, he said, "I conferred with no man, brother, &gt;&gt; but I went for myself." &gt;&gt; And I said, "God, did you show it to me?" &gt;&gt; And guess where he showed it to me? In the word. &gt;&gt; That's where we got to get it. &gt;&gt; We got to have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Got to understand even now God can do whatever. &gt;&gt; Yes, he can. &gt;&gt; He said he can do. He's not limited. Brother said, "Oh, you know, sometimes you get looking at if you look at it natural, Satan says, "Oh, this old ma message is it's drying out. &gt;&gt; It's fading out." &gt;&gt; Amen. One brother told me, he said, "Within 5 years, there won't be no message." And you know what I said? I said, "Praise God, that means I won't be here." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I said, "Because as long as I'm here, there's going to be a message. As long as you're here, there's going to be a message." &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; For that message is Jesus Christ that lives in you. Ain't that tell what Paul said is Christ in you the hope of glory &gt;&gt; not your desire not your think about but the hope the faith Paul said the life I now live &gt;&gt; I live by the faith of God &gt;&gt; the faith of the son of God the faith he did have he persecuted the church I like it like this the Lord showed me that one time I preached on the message human faith versus God's faith &gt;&gt; and I said look at Paul's faith he was zealous he thought he was doing Good. &gt;&gt; I said human faith persecuted the church and killed it. &gt;&gt; I said, "But God's faith resurrected the church." &gt;&gt; Bring her back to restored the church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I said, "So it's your faith." Brother Brown said, "Take that a token and apply it on your situations. &gt;&gt; If it's your children, your husband, your aunt, your uncle, we don't have to lead none of them." &gt;&gt; That's right. Moses wasn't going to just go worship and leave his children. &gt;&gt; Favor, Satan tries to make deals with you. You just go on to church. Don't worry about your children. Don't pray for them. &gt;&gt; They if they children of God, they'll come. &gt;&gt; I said hogwash. I'm not going to leave them for you or nobody else. &gt;&gt; God said they're my heritage. &gt;&gt; I don't know how he'll do it, when he'll do it, &gt;&gt; but I know he said he'd do it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want to be like this right here. I want to live such a life in God and live such a Christian. Not to be the best preacher. I've never desired to be that. I want to be the best Christian. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then the best preacher will come. The best preacher is the Holy Ghost. It's not brother Amos. It's not brother Sean. The Holy Ghost is the preacher. It's not a man. &gt;&gt; Man can't do this. &gt;&gt; Man can't speak to your heart. Man can't heal you. Man can't save you. man can't give you the Holy Ghost, God gives it to you. Had one brother said, "Well, Brother Richard said, "Brother Brown didn't give you the Holy Ghost." I said, "I know he didn't." I said, "Brother Brown couldn't even get the Holy Ghost for yourself. God gave it to him." &gt;&gt; Brother Brown even said, "I can't give you the Holy Ghost." God gives it to you. &gt;&gt; Peter didn't give him the Holy Ghost that day. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God did. He said he was bringing their faith up and said, "This is that." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a manifestation of what the word said. Right. &gt;&gt; Even now, if you'll believe, oh, glory be to Even now, if you'll believe, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord, &gt;&gt; you can have a refilling of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Even now, if you believe, you can be healed. &gt;&gt; That's what God said. &gt;&gt; It's not what man said. &gt;&gt; That's what God says. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Our confession. Don't let your condition affect your position. &gt;&gt; That's what Satan says. Oh, boy. If you was really a Christian, brother Amos, you wouldn't battle them things you battle. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Oh boy. If you was really a Christian, you wouldn't never have no problems. &gt;&gt; You wouldn't never get sick. God don't love you. &gt;&gt; Praise. &gt;&gt; You're just walking around fooling yourself. I said, "God's already healed me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's already saved me. &gt;&gt; God's already filled me with the Holy Ghost. All I'm doing is waiting on my body to come under the obedience of the word. &gt;&gt; He already healed us. &gt;&gt; That's right. I'm just saying I don't never ask or when I ask go prepare. I don't say pray that God will heal me. I say pray that God will bring my body subject to my confession. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Cuz confession brings possession. &gt;&gt; He that confessth, he that confessth shall possess us. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Ain't you thankful for that? &gt;&gt; You thankful for the pray the power of God. &gt;&gt; He comes to the hopeless and gives us hope. Even the Bible said faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. Us is sometimes us humans. Oh God, I got to see it first. He said, I'll let you see it when you believe it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And you know what? I found out that when I start thanking him, &gt;&gt; it comes to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I remember one time I was praying and praying and praying. I said, "God, you know, praying to my wife, I need a car. I travel, you know, we travel, brother Amish, you know, we get on the roads and we go and when God gives us health and gives us strength, you know, and wore the poor old car out, you know, and you know, ain't none of us millionaires, you know, and &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; I thought, well, I don't know what I'm going to do. And my wife said, "Well, why don't you ask God?" And I said, "I need so many spiritual things and physical things. Why would I ask him for such a a materialistic thing?" You know, and I was walking through the house, you know, I didn't want to ask that first. I need this, man. I need God to help me. &gt;&gt; You need God to help you this morning. Without his help, we're not going to do it. But I remember, Brother, I was walking through the house and I was praying and talking to the Lord and he spoke to me. He said, "Why ain't you ask me for a car?" &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; He's even mindful of the things, the natural things we need. &gt;&gt; He said, "Why ain't you ask me?" &gt;&gt; He said, "You have not cuz you ask not. And when you do ask, you ask a miss. &gt;&gt; Why don't we ask him? &gt;&gt; And then thank him for doing it. &gt;&gt; So I asked him and guess what? He did it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; Because I said, "Lord, I thank you &gt;&gt; that thou hears me." Just like Jesus said, "Father, I thank you that you hear." We got to have confidence when we pray. &gt;&gt; Say, "Brother Rich, how you pray like that?" I know he hears me when I pray. We have a spiritual connection. I am born of his spirit. &gt;&gt; We are born of his bone. Spirit of his spirit. Life of his life. &gt;&gt; We are him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In bride form. &gt;&gt; Brother said we're little Messiah. See, Satan tries to talk you out of that. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; That's what God said. That ain't what that ain't what we think. That's what God said we are. &gt;&gt; Re said you're an amateur god. &gt;&gt; Right. We don't realize how powerful our words are. If we did, we'd watch what we're saying. &gt;&gt; Cuz sometimes we get to a place and we'll say, you remember brother got to a place. He said, well, said Satan was talking said, look at her. He took your wife, took your child, your daddy. Here you are praying. You can pray for everybody else and he'll answer, but he won't answer you. &gt;&gt; Oh, Satan's straight with you. &gt;&gt; Yes, he is. &gt;&gt; He tries you. He ain't playing games. &gt;&gt; He's a good adversary, &gt;&gt; but he's a defeated adversary. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I have overcome." &gt;&gt; And we're in him. That means we've overcome, too. &gt;&gt; But he'll tell you that. He likes to tell you, you ain't no way you can do it. &gt;&gt; And you know what I tell him? I know I can't, but I know he did. &gt;&gt; And I tell him, I can do all things through Christ Jesus who strengthens me. &gt;&gt; Amen. He called and the Bible said he causth me to triumphant. &gt;&gt; He made us winner, &gt;&gt; brother Josiah. He made you a winner. &gt;&gt; He elected you, brother Will, and made you a winner. &gt;&gt; He chose you. &gt;&gt; You didn't choose him. &gt;&gt; You ran from him. You hid from him. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; You did everything to stay away from him. &gt;&gt; Come on now. But he came to your house one day &gt;&gt; just like just like he did Zakayas. &gt;&gt; He said, "I've come to your house today, Zakayas." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Salvation has come." Woo! Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; He come knocking one day. &gt;&gt; And guess what? He gave me an ear to hear that knock. &gt;&gt; He's knocked on many a heart, brother Amos. But they couldn't hear the knock. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; But he said, "Oh my, I love this." You know what? He gave you faith to believe and he's blessing you for believing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You couldn't believe. &gt;&gt; So it had nothing to do with you. You just only thing he asked you to do was was to obey. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ain't you thankful for that? &gt;&gt; He is. He's more than able. &gt;&gt; He already did it. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; He said he would do it. &gt;&gt; Turn with me to to First Kings. Can you? First Kings chapter 8. Listen to this. Now, here's a man that believed in praying, Solomon. And when he prayed, he believed God heard him. And listen what God did for him when he prayed. He's asking God to do this. And this is this is now he's telling me this. If the enemy comes in, we got a God we can call on that can feed him. It's first Kings 8 starting at verse 42. He's talking about after he built the temple. He said, "For they shall hear of thy great name and of thy strong hand and of thy stretched out arm. When he shall come, pray toward this house." &gt;&gt; A you glad it's not a building no more, not a temple, but we're praying towards him. turn our eyes toward Jesus. That's the temple now. &gt;&gt; We We don't have to turn to to Jerusalem, the temple there which was destroyed. He was telling him, "Look, you that temple there's going to be destroyed, &gt;&gt; but you can tear this temple down, but I'll raise it back up." &gt;&gt; And he did. &gt;&gt; He told Pilot, "You think you got power? You'd have no power unless I give it to you." All right, &gt;&gt; brother. All power in heaven and earth is given of God. Even what Satan's got, he got it from God. &gt;&gt; Listen to this. He said, "Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for, that all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have builded is called by thy name." &gt;&gt; Ain't tell what God said. This house which I have built, &gt;&gt; it's called in my name. &gt;&gt; If you'll turn to this house, Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Look how the shadow types to this. How beautiful. Listen to this. He said, "Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication and maintain their cause if they sin against thee. For there is no man that sinnth not." Oh, I thought, oh, I was born in the message. Ain't no way. I ain't never sinned. I ain't never been out in the world. I ain't never drank. I ain't never cussed. He was born. &gt;&gt; He's born a sinner. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Didn't he tell you right there? Oh, I love how the scripture, you know, Paul said, "We've all sinned and come short of the glory of God." He said, "There is no man that sinnth not, and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that thou carry them away captivity." He's telling them, "When you do that thing, I'm going to let the enemy, but I'm going to deliver you, but I'm going to let your enemy get the best of you &gt;&gt; because you've not obeyed me. &gt;&gt; You've not done what I've asked you to do. You've not done according to what I've asked." See, if we've done what God has asked us and we got something on us that's boundless, we got a right to say, "God, you promised you do this." &gt;&gt; You said that, Lord, there's nothing here but me and the blood of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Then Satan has no right to hold anything over you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said far away. Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land wherewith they have carried captives and repent and make supplication unto the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned and have done perversely. We have committed wickedness, and so return unto thee with all their heart. &gt;&gt; Right? See, you have to turn to him with all of your heart. Not just, "Oh, well, I got caught. I better repent." &gt;&gt; But you got to be sorrowful what you did. Say, "God, I've sinned again." Look at the the prodical son. He said, "I've sinned against heaven and I've sinned against you, Father. &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm Father, I'm coming back. I don't I don't have to be a son no more, but I'm willing to serve. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; I'm willing to do whatever you want, Lord. Whatever you ask me to do, just let me come back home. &gt;&gt; That's the way I was. I said, "Lord, just let me come back, brother Amos. Just let me come back, Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm willing to do. See, that's where we mess up. We forget that we're here to serve. &gt;&gt; The Bible, Brother Bam told us, he said, "When you're living your life for others, you're staring heaven in the face." &gt;&gt; The five-fold ministry is here to serve you, not for you to serve them. Men of God need to realize that we come here as servants to serve you what God has prepared. Brother Brand said, "Take this message." &gt;&gt; Brother Amy, break it down and feed it to them. &gt;&gt; And said, "Make it so simple that even the little bitty children can understand." &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, wait a minute, brother. I thought I had to use these big old words and all this stuff." I said, "Well, Paul said, I didn't come to you with enticing words and wisdom of men, but I come to you with power." &gt;&gt; That's right. and demonstration. &gt;&gt; What was more better? Enticing words or power and demonstration? &gt;&gt; Power and demonstration. The power was to demonstrate the word being alive. &gt;&gt; And the only one can do that is the Holy Ghost through us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Aren't you thankful for that? So if you pray, if you'll do what I tell you to do, if we come back and call on his name, he'll do this for us. He won't withhold nothing from us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh my. His arm ain't too short. &gt;&gt; He's not weak. Let's turn over into Daniel just for a minute. Look at the man now. We seen Martha call on him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; 21. And it took what was it? Four days for him to get there. Here's a man that didn't lose faith. Took 21 days. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He didn't quit praying. Brother Amos. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In Daniel chapter nine, let's start right here. Let's see. Daniel, let's see. Let's see if I can get it right here. Put my glasses on. All right. All right. All right. I got it now. I had to get my eyes focused. This is Daniel chapter nine. Look, it says, "In the year of Darius, the son of Aseres of the seed of Mendes, which made was made king over the realm of the Chaldans, in the first year of his reign, I Daniel stood by the books, the numbers of the years where the Lord of Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet." Look, even a prophet goes back to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's not a true prophet unless he goes back to the word. &gt;&gt; And brother Bram told us, he said, "If I or anybody," and Paul said, "if anybody preach anything than what I've already preached, &gt;&gt; let him be a curse." &gt;&gt; He said, and he was so sure that what God had delivered is unto him. He said, "Even if I say anything, &gt;&gt; contrary to what's already been spoken, let me be a curse." Look at this. Here's Daniel. He's needing help. And he goes to the goes to the word of the Lord from Jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolations of Jerusalem. And he said, "I set my face unto the Lord God to seek by prayer and supplications with fasting and sackcloths and ashes. And I prayed unto the Lord my God and made my confession and said, "Oh Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and the mercy to them that love him and to them that keep his commandments. We have sin." Look, he first thing he do, he starts repenting for what they've done. Didn't he say he'd only mark those who were signing and crying for the abominations done in the city? Listen, he puts himself in here. That's what God, we've sinned. We've made a mistake. We shouldn't have done. We should have listened to you. We should have obeyed you. This is the repercussion we've received because we didn't obey. Not because you're not merciful and gracious, but because we disobeyed. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "We have sinned and have committed iniquity and have done wickedly and have rebelled even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments. Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants, the prophets which spake in in thy name to our kings and our princes and our fathers." Ain't that happening right now? &gt;&gt; It's happening right now, brother. I said spirits don't die. They still dwelling. &gt;&gt; And same old spirit and all the people of the land. He said, "Oh Lord, righteousness belongth unto thee, but unto us confu confusion of faces, and at the day to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel that are near, and that are far off, through the countries, whether thou hast driven them, because of their trespasses, they have trespassed against thee. Oh Lord, to us belongest confusion of face. to our kings, to our princes, to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee. The to the Lord God belong mercies and forgiveness. Though we have rebelled against him, neither have we obeyed the voice of the Lord and our God. Walk in his ways which he has said. Then what do we do? We first praise him, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And then we repent, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And then we give him adoration. &gt;&gt; Then we yield to whatever he says. That's right. &gt;&gt; He said, "Yay, all Israel has transgressed against thy law, even in departing from they that might obey the voice. Therefore, a curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses, the servant of God, because we have sinned against, and he hath confirmed his words, and he has spake against us, and against our judges, and judged us by bringing upon this great evil. For under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem. He said, "As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us, yet made we not our prayer before the Lord our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand the truth. Therefore ha hath God watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us. For the Lord our God is righteous in all the works which he doeth, for we have obeyed." See, he's trying to get an answer from God. But he has to you to get an answer from God, you must approach him the right way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you don't approach him, Brother Brown said, if when one man, however he approaches God, if you'll do that same thing, God will do the same thing for you. Let's go on down. Then I'll skip some. You can read this later on. But look at this. And it says in verse 24, it says, "And 70 weeks are determined upon thy people in the holy city to finish the transgression and to make ends of the sins iniquities and to bring everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision of the prophecy and to anoint the most holy. Know therefore that understand therefore and understand that from the going forth and the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem, Messiah the prince shall be seven weeks and three score and two weeks." He said, "The street shall be built again in the wall and even in troubles times." He didn't say it's going to be easy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said, "But in that time, in that troubles time, it's going to happen." Brother, right here, God is building a bride right now in this leady age. &gt;&gt; In a troubles time like no other man's ever known, but God is bringing a bride &gt;&gt; out of a dark, filthy, dirty generation. He said, "And after three score and two weeks the Messiah shall come and shall confirm." And he said, "Look at this." And he and he and it goes on, he tells he tells that and he says after he's done all that, he's prayed and he's prayed and he's prayed and it looks like he's not going to get an answer, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But then an angel appears. &gt;&gt; Come on now. and says, "Look, Daniel, he heard you when you first prayed." Brothers and sisters, when we first pray, we got to have faith. And when we ask God, he hears us. &gt;&gt; But he said, "The prince of Persia, &gt;&gt; withtood me. &gt;&gt; He fought against me. &gt;&gt; He held me back. But Michael come." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Michael has come in this hour to defend us. And even he says on he said even your your angel Michael &gt;&gt; that I have given you is fought for you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; And he has caused you to triumph within this age. &gt;&gt; He has defeated the enemy. But what I like about it, brother brother Amos, when he gets the answer, he said, "But I got to go back and fight still." &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. When you get the answer, the fight's still going on. Cuz the fight ain't against flesh and blood. It's against spiritual wickedness in high places. &gt;&gt; The fight is between the conflict is between God and Satan. &gt;&gt; We got to understand that. That's not our fight. &gt;&gt; It's his fight. &gt;&gt; He's not fighting us. &gt;&gt; He's fighting God that lives in us. &gt;&gt; That's why he said, "Greater's he is in us than he is in the world." &gt;&gt; That's right. He said, "He's come in." Hey, when he wanted the body of Moses, Michael said, "The Lord rebuked these, Satan." &gt;&gt; Why do you want that body? So he can make an eye out of it. &gt;&gt; So he could make make an a a monarch or a place that they could go to the grave and and make a big monument of it. Oh, great prophet Moses. &gt;&gt; Didn't even when they come, was they not looking to build temples? When Moses and Elijah come, Peter said, "Shall we build three temples, &gt;&gt; he said no." &gt;&gt; He said, "Hear ye him." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, mine. That's why Paul said in the scripture said he said that even even he said the Lord spake to us by the prophets which we know has but now speake it to us through the Holy Spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful for that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me read you a few quotes. I'm not going to hold you long, but I mean, even now, whatever we have need of. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have a lot of needs. I mean, we're needy people. &gt;&gt; We need God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need God to do something. We're in a dark hour. We're under the greatest assault we've ever been in. &gt;&gt; We see the world falling apart. We see everything's coming to an end. &gt;&gt; But we're coming to our beginning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, listen. The Philippian church said, he says, "God gives us exceeding and great precious promises. He has promised to fulfill them. He will, but from the time but from the time we pray until the time we get the answer, we must learn to receive patience." &gt;&gt; He said, "Enter our souls. For only in patience do we possess life." He said, "May God help us to learn this lesson even now, even as we know the people of this sixth age learn patience." We read history of the lives of the great Christians. What a contrast we see between lives and ours. For they were so patient and quiet. &gt;&gt; Yes. And today we are all but overcome and over impatient and haste. Ain't that what he told Daniel? He said, "I've come to wear the saints out." He said, "Wire you out." But the Bible said, "Be patient there. Be patient. Wait on me. Understand I'm able to do this." The Bible says Matthew 21:22 says, "All things whatsoever ye ask in prayer believing ye shall receive." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen to what the prophet said in the message, "No, thou knowest all things." He says, "Now see what prayer does. Prayer is not exactly bringing God down to man. It's bringing man up to God." See, as you pray, you lose sight of these earthly things. you sway out into somewhere else way beyond on and on and on till you come into his presence. He said and then faith that you have laid it out before God. Now here he said God is here. He said I want to get well for this cause. I want to do this for me for this cause. I want to heal. I want you to heal me from cancer or TB or amnesia condition or whatever. &gt;&gt; He said, I will walk before you. I will do everything I can. I will give this testimony everywhere. I will be happy to do that, Lord. And I will use my life not for myself. I will use it for your glory to help others see. Now then you lay your life before God and say God oh my look how be will you consider my case. He said, "Even now I consider your case. If you lay your life before me and say, God, I'm not wanting this for myself, but I'm wanting you to do this that I might work for you better. That I might have the health that I might have the health to serve you better. That I might be able to do to be able to help others go more places, do more things. God, I'm not asking this selfishly, but I'm asking you, Lord. Will you please consider my case? Oh, glory be to God. Ain't you glad we got a God that considers our case? &gt;&gt; Considers it when we ask him. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. Ain't you thankful for the power of God? &gt;&gt; The power of God to restore us back. Consider my case, Lord. I'm not asking you to do this just for me as selfish, but father I'm asking just that it might let me be serve you better without being so sickly and so wore down and and in such pain God. But will you do it where I may give you more praise? &gt;&gt; I may give you more honor that I may give you more glory, Lord. That father I might be able to do it with happiness and joy and be able to tell Lord look what thou has done. &gt;&gt; Look what you've done &gt;&gt; father and knowing that if he does it you do it for me rather Lord that you they'll have faith that you'll do it for them also. &gt;&gt; Teaching of Moses he said you children know what Tor is when they're fixing the streets you know. Oh, he said, "Oh, that awful smell." He said, "It shouts shouts out the cracks in the street." And that's that's the way this does. It shuts out all the all the water. And that's what prayer does for the believer. &gt;&gt; That's what keeps the world out of you. It's when you pitch yourself on your knees and say, "Lord Jesus," and the blood comes down and seals you all up so the devil can't can't get you. See, that's right. See, oh then, oh, many times people go around and say, "It's awful." But that don't make any difference. It keeps you safe. See, that's the main thing. Keep safe. He says, "Say you're oldfashioned. That doesn't matter. He's keeping us, brother Amos. &gt;&gt; He's keeping us in this hour. Thirsting for life. He said that's that's the way the devil does. He will cut off your prayer meetings. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Cut off your altar at your home, too. He'll cut off your prayer. That's the greatest weapon we have against Satan. And that's the thing he's battling you for to get you so busy you won't pray. And brother Brand said, "You going to get closer to God?" He didn't say, he said made it so simple for us. He said, "Read your Bible and pray." &gt;&gt; And that's the thing Satan fights you the most of. When you go to reading your Bible, but we can we can look at other we can read newspapers or this or that. This man enjoys it. He don't never get sleep. But it's amazing. Every time you pick up the word of God or a message book or you start playing a tape or you start listening to preaching or something, &gt;&gt; preach. &gt;&gt; I like I'm like, Satan, &gt;&gt; brother, &gt;&gt; get behind me. &gt;&gt; That's the devil trying to rob you from receiving what God's given. &gt;&gt; We all do. That's we have to battle that, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Say, we got to shake it off and say, "Wait a minute, God. If you'll just say one word, &gt;&gt; that's enough to sustain me." Amen. &gt;&gt; One word from you means more than anything. &gt;&gt; But that's what he b that's what he fights you again. He said he said that's what the devil keeps you. He he said he's done cut off the hamstrings right then. He said you'll pull around the church like that and you'll run from here to there. But anytime the devil wants you to gobble to gobble you up, he said he's got you under his control. When he cuts your prayer life off, brother, you're gone. He said, "That's right." When he cuts that thirst off of you and perverts it into the things of the world, he's got you where he wants you. &gt;&gt; He will let you gobble along here till you get to a certain place, then crash your life without God right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. H what he wants you to do is let him drive. And I say these things they say Jesus is my co-pilot. And I thought my if he don't drive, brother, I don't ride. If he ain't driving, brother, I don't get in the car. &gt;&gt; But we'll jump in the car of the world. We'll ride around with our friends and our family and go to places we shouldn't go and do things we shouldn't do. And Satan's just a goblin. He says, "Keep on." Do you know what it is? I like I looked at this one time. I was studying on this and I looked at this and it's powerful, brother. Just simple things are so powerful that we we got so much so many weapons to use, but yet we look at them and say, "Well, I don't know if that work." It works. &gt;&gt; And you know what? I was looking at that and you know what we get? He wants us to be busy, busy, busy, busy. You ever been praying and people just your phone don't ring all day, but when you go to pray, &gt;&gt; everybody starts calling. You go to reading your Bible, everybody calls and they ain't want to talk about nothing. They just want to talk. And you know, I was looking at that. You know, I think about that. You know what busy is? I like how one man illustrated busy. Busy is being under Satan's yoke. When you're too busy to pray and read your Bible, Brother Amos, you're too busy &gt;&gt; to receive the promises of God. And all he asks you to do is pray and believe and ask what you will. But he's got us too, he can even get us too busy preaching. Sometimes we go and go and go and go and we don't take time to pray. We get wore out, too. I tell them, I tell them, "Hey, I'm not going. I'm going to church Wednesday night. &gt;&gt; I can't go every time. I mean, if they're sick, I'm going to do it." But I said, "I got to quit. I can't I can't We can't go everywhere. I mean, I know we got a prayer life every day, but we need to hear the word, too. Preachers need to sit under ministry. &gt;&gt; Yeah, they do. &gt;&gt; Yeah, they do. &gt;&gt; Ain't that what brother Brandon said? You got to have a pastor. &gt;&gt; If you ain't got a pastor, you don't need to be preaching. &gt;&gt; I said, "Preacher, I preaching." I said, "Where's your pastor? I ain't got one." I said, "Then what are you preaching for?" &gt;&gt; Brother Brand said, "Don't do it, brother. What? You can't You know what? I've learned this and God showed me this. You know what? If you don't if you don't never learn how to follow, you'll never learn how to lead. &gt;&gt; That's exactly. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Pick up your cross and follow me." &gt;&gt; And we want everybody to follow us, but we don't want to follow Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Ain't you thankful for the power of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful for his grace and his mercy? &gt;&gt; I won't hold you much longer. But what about that? Even now, if we seem like we just can't can't get no further than seem like we ain't going to make it. Even now, if we'll come to God and say, "God, I failed you. I made a mistake, Lord. I've been too busy." And it not be bad things, being good. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; And he told us not to be weary and welloing. But you know what the greatest thing is? To take time with God. It's like if you're married to a wife and you don't never tell her you love her. You don't never tell her how much you appreciate her. Just think about a wife is she'd never tell her husband. He come off of work or whatever he's doing and she'd never say, "Hey, I appreciate you, honey. I love you." You know, when the first thing I do when I pray, I said, "Lord, I love you. I thank you, Lord. I'm unworthy. I don't have anything good that I could offer you that you'd accept me. But, Father, only thing I can come with is your blood. your blood atoning for me, Lord. I And we fail him every day. Brother Br said, we even fail him after we receive the Holy Ghost. We even sin. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; We know to do better. And Satan will trick us. And we think I think, oh my, how come I fell for that again? Cuz I just didn't pray enough. &gt;&gt; Preach. &gt;&gt; I just didn't pray. Didn't take time to say, God, I can't make it through this day without you. Father, there's many traps out there. There's many shipwrecks. as many crashes, but God, if you'll turn on that GPS called the Holy Spirit in my heart and father, I can stay connected with you and I can go with you and listen to you. You know the first thing when we on that GPS, God showed me this. I preached a funeral one time, which we don't believe that saint, but I did a funeral one time and you know the first I believe that Lord showed me that you know the first thing we used to have those garments or whatever they was the first thing you had to do was you had to push I agree to follow the instructions. Ain't that how we get the Holy Ghost? Total obedience to every word. &gt;&gt; Push that button. Say, "I agree, Lord." And then we follow the directions heading to where he knows where we need to be. &gt;&gt; And I'm glad sometimes, brother, brother Amos, I'll get over there a little bit and that that I can hear that voice say, "Recalculating. &gt;&gt; You have made the wrong turn. You need to go &gt;&gt; the other way." Ain't that what the prophet said when he screaming out and he'd get out of line, he'd say, "Stay in line." That's what the Holy Ghost is. He's keeping us in line. And you know, when my mother, she passed away not long ago, 99 years old, brothers, served the Lord. Thank God that I was a part of that fifth gospel to have a mother that would train me. It didn't never I I may have walked got away, but it it never left me. I'd go to do something, brother Amos, and I'd hear that voice, you know better than that. I said, "Mom, I can't get away with nothing." And you know what she'd tell me? The way of a transgressor is hard, son. I said, "Oh, mom, I thought she'd pet me or you know, you think want some." She said, "No, when you serve God, then you'll see how much more you'll get from God." &gt;&gt; You know, and she just kept telling me what she didn't compromise because I was my son. I was her son. She just kept telling me what the truth said. She kept hanging in there. She said, "I just kept praying and believing. I knew you'd come one day because I knew he gave you to me and I gave him back to you. &gt;&gt; And I said, I knew, Father, you'd bring him one day. But you know, when I was preaching that and I was thinking about that, Brother Amos, and I said, you know what, I said about about 4:30 that Monday afternoon, Brother Amos, she had had that GPS running in her soul all them years. And I said, she heard that voice say, "You have reached your destination. True. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. You know what? I can hear it. &gt;&gt; I can hear it through the spirit of God saying, "You have reached your destination. &gt;&gt; This message is your destination." Jesus Christ is this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One day he's going to say, "You've reached your destination. Enter into my rest, my good and faithful servant. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You have. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my boy. When I when God brought me to this message, they tried to tell me say, "Well, Brother Brandham didn't save you." I said, "I never said he did." I said, "Brother Brand couldn't save yourself." I said, "But I'll tell you one thing this message did for me, Brother Amos. You know what this message did? It introduced me to Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know what? You know what? When the when the Lord got a hold of me, he didn't take me to the Memphis church, no offense to the Baptist, but you know where he did? He brought me right back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where I was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I said, if I couldn't deny it when I wasn't living right, God, how can I deny it now? Woo. Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How can we deny it now &gt;&gt; when we're reaching our destination? &gt;&gt; This thing's almost over. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit says, "Run, &gt;&gt; run. It's almost over." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ain't you thankful for the grace of God? &gt;&gt; Even now, God's encouraging us. &gt;&gt; He does a great cloud of witnesses hauling for us. Keep running, Brother Amos. Keep running, Brother Will. Keep pressing the battle. &gt;&gt; It's almost over. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not him that width or him that runth, but it's God that showeth mercy. &gt;&gt; Paul said, "I have run the race. I have kept the faith." &gt;&gt; Therefore, therefore now, &gt;&gt; there's a crown of righteousness laid up for me. He said, "I fought a good fight." &gt;&gt; Oh, God. I want to have that testimony. Don't you, brother? &gt;&gt; I want to be able to say that, brother Amos. I fought a good fight. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I got knocked down a lot. I might got knocked down in several battles, but I'm winning the war. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm winning the war. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz he won the war. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's caused me to win. &gt;&gt; Let us stand. Ain't you thankful? &gt;&gt; Amen. that even in the darkest hour, &gt;&gt; in the lowest place, &gt;&gt; in your greatest trial, even now, he can do it. &gt;&gt; When all hope is gone, when everything has failed you, he said, "I'll never leave you. I'll never forsake you. &gt;&gt; I'll even be with you, even in you to the end." That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm going to cause you to win. &gt;&gt; Oh my. What words he told us, brother Amos? He said, "You'll overcome by the blood of the lamb." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the word of your testimony. My testimony is greater as he that's in me than he that's in this world. The blood of Jesus coverth me from all sin. &gt;&gt; Jesus have called me. He have chosen me. He has elected me. He has predestinated me. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank brothers and sisters. He handpicked you for this age. One brother said, "If we'd have known the end of this thing, we'd have volunteered for it." And I began to think about that, brother. I be to think about that, brother Amos. I said, "We'd have volunteered for that." But you know what the Holy Spirit said? You did. You know why? Cuz you was there in my mind. And I thought of you being there in Leodia. Hallelujah. I thought of you being there cuz I knew you'd overcome. Because I've gi you everything you need to overcome with when I give you my Holy Spirit. He said, "Even now, even now, I can do whatever you need me to do." Ain't you thankful for a God like that? &gt;&gt; Even when all hope's gone, the doctor's gone, this is gone, that's gone. He said, "Even now, I'm able. If you'll just ask me, he said, "Is anything too hard for me?" I like what one man said. He said, "God specializes in the impossibilities." He said, "All things are possible to know through." I said, "Satan, I can't understand everything. I can't explain everything. But I tell you one thing I can do, Satan. I believe it all. I believe every bit of it. From tit to tit, from line to line, word to word, from chapter to chapter, from verse to verse. I believe it all. And you know what? By believing it, I've seen if I've asked him to help me, I've seen him through the years, brother. I've seen him reveal it to you. Oh my. He said, just put it up there for a little bit. It It's not time yet, Amos. It's not time yet, but the time has now come. We know all things. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; All things is Jesus Christ. The same yesterday, today, and forever. Every head bowed, every eye closed. Someone have a need this morning and say, "God, even now, I believe I can hand it. I can raise my hand and surrender, offering it to you, and you will defeat my enemy. You'll destroy my enemy." Oh my. Didn't God tell Abraham, "Ye shall possess the gates of your enemy." That's this flesh, man. Brothers and sisters, this flesh, we're going to possess him. We're going to possess him. He's going to take on a new body one day. Father, Lord, we ask you to help us this morning, Father. We thank you, Lord. Lord, may you take this little thought, Lord, through the week, Lord, and even when the Satan had come in. those words come back to us, Lord. Even now, Lord, even now, Lord, though you slay me, yet I trust you. Father, where else could we go? To whom else could we serve? To whom could we believe? For thou has the words of eternal life. Where can we go, Lord? Father, we come to you now this morning, Lord, asking you, Lord, to answer the needs of your children, Lord. Father, there's nothing too hard for you. There's no limits to you, Lord. There's nothing holding you back, Father. The only thing, Lord, is for us to ask and ask of believing that we receive it and then we start thanking you for it and then you bring it to pass, God. It's that simple for us, Lord. Let us do that, Lord. Bless Brother Amos, Lord, and gift you give him and all these other brothers and sisters in here, Lord, and bless brother Shawn. Oh, God. May we wave that banner so much higher than we have been. May we wave that blood stain banner and say, "Jesus, Jesus has not left us. He's still here. You're still working through your children. You're still saving. You're still delivering. You're still healing. Oh God, you're unchangeable, Lord.
