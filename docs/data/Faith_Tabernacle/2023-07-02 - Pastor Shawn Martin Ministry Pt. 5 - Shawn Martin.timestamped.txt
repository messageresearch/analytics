[44:08] before we go under the word could we
[44:10] just bow our heads in a word of Prayer
[44:13] precious Lord
[44:16] Our Father
[44:20] so privileged to be able to call you
[44:23] father Lord knowing that we've been
[44:26] begotten of you Lord that we are Sons
[44:29] and Daughters of yours
[44:32] that your raw blood flows within our
[44:36] veins the quickening power Lord
[44:40] we're not just mere mortals Lord we are
[44:45] Supernatural Lord and you've made us
[44:48] that way to where we could live in this
[44:51] world and be a super race
[44:53] a super Church
[44:55] an invincible Army Lord
[44:59] and father no matter what comes our way
[45:02] Lord no matter what tactics and uh
[45:06] schemes the devil has laid waiting for
[45:09] us Lord we know and are confident that
[45:12] we will overcome them
[45:15] now father we just come here just to
[45:19] worship you and asking for a recharge
[45:22] Lord in our spirit
[45:24] Lord and that you would come and
[45:27] fellowship with this Lord it means more
[45:30] than just to us than fellowshipping even
[45:33] with the president or some high up in
[45:36] this world if you would just come and
[45:38] meet with us
[45:39] and not just your presence but if you
[45:42] would speak Lord to his father and I
[45:44] pray that you had anoint me Father help
[45:47] me to get myself out of the way Lord and
[45:51] may your people get themselves out of
[45:53] the way father and Lord that you would
[45:56] have the preeminence in this service we
[45:59] ask it Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen
[46:04] thank you Lord Jesus
[46:07] Hebrews the eighth chapter and
[46:11] [Music]
[46:12] it says now of the things which we have
[46:16] spoken this is the sum
[46:20] we have such an high priest who is set
[46:24] on the right hand of the Throne of the
[46:27] Majesty in the heavens
[46:30] a minister of the sanctuary and of the
[46:33] true Tabernacle which the Lord pitched
[46:36] and not man
[46:38] for every high priest is ordained to
[46:41] offer gifts and sacrifices wherefore it
[46:45] is of necessity that this man have
[46:48] somewhat also to offer
[46:51] for if he were on Earth he should not be
[46:55] a priest saying that there are priests
[46:58] that offer gifts according to the law
[47:02] who serve unto the example and Shadow of
[47:04] heavenly things as Moses was admonished
[47:07] of God
[47:09] when he was about to make the Tabernacle
[47:12] for see saith he that thou make all
[47:18] things according to the pattern show to
[47:21] thee in the mound
[47:23] in other words
[47:24] Moses saw
[47:26] a Heavenly Tabernacle
[47:29] saw that Heavenly realm and God showed
[47:32] it to him and then he was to make an
[47:35] Earthly Tabernacle after what he saw
[47:39] and so sixth verse but now
[47:43] has he obtained a more excellent
[47:46] Ministry
[47:48] by how much also he is the mediator of
[47:53] the better Covenant
[47:55] which was established upon bitter
[47:58] promises amen
[48:01] you can have your seats this morning
[48:06] so Paul showing that
[48:10] Christ is the high priest
[48:13] which is greater than the natural high
[48:17] priest the natural was only a type and
[48:19] Shadow
[48:21] of
[48:23] that which was to come
[48:26] and I'm not
[48:29] going to go that direction but I
[48:33] again I I want to talk about Ministry
[48:39] because Paul is saying here a minister
[48:43] see second verse minister of the
[48:46] sanctuary that's what this high priest
[48:49] see who is said on the right hand of the
[48:52] Throne of the Majesty in the heavens a
[48:55] minister
[48:56] and then you look here where Paul would
[49:02] say the sixth verse he hath obtained a
[49:04] more excellent Ministry
[49:06] by how much also he is the mediator of a
[49:10] better Covenant which was established on
[49:12] better promises so
[49:14] I want to just again talk of ministry
[49:18] and I'm going to I'm using that
[49:21] scripture as maybe a foundation
[49:25] but uh
[49:27] Maybe
[49:30] uh
[49:31] looking at the purpose of ministry
[49:35] and maybe the title should be actually
[49:39] God's Ministry but I'm putting it as
[49:42] Ministry
[49:45] all across the board as we go that makes
[49:49] sense but
[49:50] Ministry is an agent or instrument a
[49:54] person or thing through which something
[49:56] is accomplished
[49:59] and so uh there is a foundation
[50:03] upon which Ministry is is established
[50:08] Ministry has must have a foundation
[50:12] uh and and so there is a purpose as to
[50:17] why Ministry exists
[50:20] and and and and so I speaking of the
[50:25] ministry that God has established but
[50:28] Satan has a ministry as well
[50:32] and it's founded upon his agenda and
[50:37] purpose
[50:38] and and so uh and his his ministry Works
[50:44] through deception
[50:46] and and he transformed as Paul would say
[50:50] he transforms himself into an angel of
[50:53] Light
[50:54] and his ministers uh act as Ministers of
[50:59] righteousness
[51:00] and and so but Satan's Ministry is
[51:05] against God's purpose
[51:07] uh so
[51:10] um it would be against God's Ministry
[51:13] because God's Ministry is founded upon
[51:16] the his purpose his will his agenda and
[51:22] and so Satan uh his ministry seeks to
[51:25] destroy what God does and is currently
[51:29] doing
[51:30] and and it is established to undermine
[51:35] God's word and John 10 10
[51:41] Jesus said the thief and we all know the
[51:45] thief uh is Satan he cometh not but for
[51:50] to steal to kill and to destroy
[51:54] so so that's that's his ministry at work
[51:58] to steal to kill and to destroy so Satan
[52:03] does not come as a builder his ministry
[52:07] is not in in building
[52:10] uh his ministry is to destroy it's a
[52:15] destructive it's it's to tear down it's
[52:19] to ultimately kill
[52:21] uh not just physically which we're
[52:24] seeing that a lot these days
[52:27] uh suicide rates especially among young
[52:30] people but also we know that the end uh
[52:35] is is a spiritual death
[52:38] uh and that's that's coming from the
[52:41] ministry of of Satan and uh um and and
[52:48] so he doesn't come to establish the
[52:51] church
[52:52] he doesn't come to establish the home he
[52:57] doesn't come to establish the marriage
[53:00] he doesn't come to establish and build
[53:04] up the individual
[53:06] hmm
[53:07] there's so many individuals today that
[53:10] have many complexes
[53:13] that's not God that Satan that puts
[53:16] these complexes in individuals
[53:19] and and he gets the person looking at
[53:22] the complex
[53:23] and you know a person that has complexes
[53:26] it's hard for God to use them because
[53:30] they've always got a complex there and
[53:34] preachers have complexes
[53:37] uh parents get complexes young people
[53:41] gets complexes people don't sing because
[53:45] they got complexes
[53:47] people Don't Preach because they got
[53:49] complexes and it's hard for them to get
[53:53] over the complexes
[53:55] and if if God can break these complexes
[53:58] down he could really use people
[54:01] ain't that right
[54:03] and and so uh but but Satan does these
[54:08] things he he doesn't come to it uh to to
[54:12] further the kingdom of God but he comes
[54:15] to break down and Destroy and and you
[54:21] know I I thought of uh and you just
[54:24] excuse me but we're just talking about a
[54:27] a minister uh there in the office and
[54:30] and uh how that he is he has struggled
[54:33] in in things and and just have gone
[54:36] through just so much in these past five
[54:39] years or so and and and
[54:42] um
[54:43] uh he's then then he's went from one to
[54:46] now trying to uh Pastor for a few years
[54:49] and and uh and even in that you know he
[54:53] had a minister to come in and sit there
[54:55] and then he didn't like what was being
[54:58] preached or how it was being preached
[55:01] thought he could be a better preacher
[55:02] and lead the people better and yada yada
[55:06] and and so he takes half the people with
[55:09] him to start another church and and you
[55:13] know how many of common that is in in
[55:18] this age that that's been even in the
[55:20] Pentecost when we were back there we had
[55:23] so many that would try to come in
[55:25] thinking that we were just young and
[55:27] dumb and especially when we first come
[55:29] into the message you know and they they
[55:32] thought they knew it better they had
[55:33] these great Mysteries and and these
[55:36] things and and so they start working on
[55:38] the people they'd start listening to the
[55:40] the gripes and the complaints and and
[55:44] before you know it they they started
[55:46] whining and dining and then their
[55:48] Christmas and and before you know it
[55:50] they take him out trying to establish
[55:52] their own their own Ministry and these
[55:55] things and and I was telling the brother
[55:57] though it's exactly the way Satan did it
[56:01] and and not in a church
[56:03] not not under a setting under a pastor
[56:06] he'd done it in heaven
[56:09] when there was no sin I mean it was a
[56:12] state of perfection for Pete's sake
[56:14] and yet Satan uh uh thought he could do
[56:18] a better job and and he was able to take
[56:22] two-thirds of the angels with him
[56:25] I mean took them from their very creator
[56:29] took them from a a a right atmosphere
[56:33] the best atmosphere you could get in the
[56:36] presence of God and yet Satan through
[56:40] his Beauty and Charisma and and would
[56:44] entice them to to seeing that they could
[56:48] have a better Kingdom than God
[56:51] and and of course the prophet said that
[56:54] Satan done that through pride and
[56:56] jealousy and that's what caused him to
[56:59] do it ain't that right see so Satan
[57:02] destroys anything that he is a part of
[57:08] all kingdoms of the world are his and
[57:12] look what he's doing to them most
[57:15] families and I'm going to say 99 maybe
[57:19] maybe more a family is not a hundred
[57:23] percent but close our families are under
[57:27] his control
[57:29] most children are under his control
[57:34] and they could even be sitting in church
[57:38] but under the control of Hollywood
[57:41] under the control of school
[57:45] under the teachings that they're trying
[57:47] to bring in
[57:50] most parents are under his control
[57:53] most churches are under his control
[57:57] and all of them
[58:00] can you say that with me all of them are
[58:03] being destroyed
[58:05] they're being destroyed and yet they're
[58:07] under Satan's control
[58:11] he has built his Eden Satan's built his
[58:14] Eden and has perfected it in this day
[58:17] can we all agree to that
[58:19] Satan has built his Eden he's worked for
[58:22] all these years to to perfect his Eden
[58:25] and we're here we're living in Satan's
[58:27] Eden
[58:28] now let's look at it there's more
[58:30] despondency than there's ever been
[58:34] there's more sickness than ever before
[58:37] there there is more death than ever
[58:42] before there is more hate than ever
[58:46] before there is more Rebellion than ever
[58:50] before there is more destruction than
[58:54] ever before there is more evil than ever
[58:59] before there is more Insanity than ever
[59:04] before there is more unrest than ever
[59:08] before the home life is being destroyed
[59:12] are are our people's minds are so
[59:16] Twisted today to where they're thinking
[59:19] they're a cat or an animal or or the
[59:23] woman being a man and man being a womb
[59:26] and then and all of these things and and
[59:29] it's it's because it's it's showing what
[59:33] control they're really under
[59:36] for Satan is a destroyer he comes deceit
[59:41] uh uh to steal kill and destroy and so
[59:45] everyone who is a part of his ministry
[59:50] amen uh are anointed to serve that
[59:53] purpose they are under his headship they
[59:56] are under his Direction and under his
[59:59] control and it's his ministry
[1:00:03] in the church ages and the Seven Seals
[1:00:06] we see the four stages of Satan's
[1:00:09] Ministry in Revelation 6 we see him
[1:00:12] riding on four horses the the white
[1:00:14] horse rider the red horse rider the
[1:00:16] black horse rider the The Pale Horse
[1:00:18] Rider and and and we see it now we
[1:00:21] didn't see it before until God would
[1:00:24] send a prophet and the lamb would open
[1:00:25] the book to us but now we see him riding
[1:00:30] in these four stages and his work in
[1:00:33] both political and religious rims
[1:00:36] ain't that right nations are against
[1:00:39] Nation well who would do that well it's
[1:00:41] it's it's Satan because they every
[1:00:44] nation is under the control of of Satan
[1:00:47] ain't that right and the Bible calls him
[1:00:50] the mystery of iniquity they're in in
[1:00:53] second Thessalonians 2 7 and he has been
[1:00:57] exposed in this day how many believe
[1:00:58] that he's been exposed to his agenda has
[1:01:02] been exposed his ministry has been
[1:01:05] exposed ain't that right everything and
[1:01:09] that's why he will never be able to
[1:01:11] deceive the very elect of God he can't
[1:01:15] do that because God would expose him for
[1:01:19] what he is it may look pretty it may
[1:01:22] look glamorous if the grass is always
[1:01:24] greener on the other side of the fence
[1:01:26] amen but the Bride of God a man has been
[1:01:32] now able to have a spirit of discernment
[1:01:34] to discern in in in the difference and
[1:01:37] know the difference
[1:01:39] amen see that's right amen so now God's
[1:01:43] God's Ministry is important because
[1:01:46] that's how his will and purpose is
[1:01:50] carried out amen his purpose which is an
[1:01:53] eternal purpose is accomplished by his
[1:01:56] ministry his desires and plans a man is
[1:02:00] they're accomplished by his ministry see
[1:02:04] there is an objective to God's Ministry
[1:02:09] amen you you you uh maybe get ahead of
[1:02:12] myself but you you Ministries amen men
[1:02:16] that are preaching the gospel and
[1:02:18] they're really under God's Ministry
[1:02:21] there's an objective to what they're
[1:02:22] doing but there's also an objective to
[1:02:25] Satan's Ministry too
[1:02:28] ain't that right you think Satan wants
[1:02:31] you to make it in a Rapture you you
[1:02:33] think Satan wants Perfect Harmony you
[1:02:36] think God he wants God's people to come
[1:02:38] together and and and and in United
[1:02:41] Hearts United around the word of God not
[1:02:44] not somebody's idea not somebody's
[1:02:47] personality amen but around the word of
[1:02:50] God if we're a United around a
[1:02:51] personality that ain't going to work if
[1:02:54] you're uh uh uh if you're coming United
[1:02:57] around an idea that's not going to work
[1:02:59] but when God's people come together
[1:03:01] United around the word of God Satan's
[1:03:05] going to fight that tooth and nail
[1:03:08] he sure is
[1:03:11] so there's an objective now to finish
[1:03:14] reading John 10 10 Jesus said the thief
[1:03:18] cometh not but for to kill to steal and
[1:03:20] destroy but I am calm that they may have
[1:03:26] life and that they might have it more
[1:03:28] abundantly ain't that right so so this
[1:03:31] is the ministry of God to impart life to
[1:03:34] give life that the people can live that
[1:03:37] that the church can thrive
[1:03:40] ain't that right see so so then all who
[1:03:44] are called on for this ministry are
[1:03:48] anointed and called for that purpose
[1:03:53] as I've said God's Ministry has an
[1:03:56] objective and an objective
[1:03:59] is something toward which effort is
[1:04:04] directed
[1:04:05] the energy
[1:04:07] the the the the the the the
[1:04:09] everything the actions and everything is
[1:04:12] directed to something
[1:04:14] it's an objective
[1:04:17] Hollywood all their movies their
[1:04:19] anointed
[1:04:21] they may not even understand that but
[1:04:23] they're anointed and that and that that
[1:04:25] one that is anointing it has an
[1:04:27] objective
[1:04:29] ain't that right that that's why that
[1:04:32] that's why brother Brown said it used to
[1:04:33] be wrong to go to the picture shows but
[1:04:35] Satan snuck a good one
[1:04:38] he snuck a good one on us and brought it
[1:04:39] in our homes he's got an objective to it
[1:04:42] now we're seeing why he did it
[1:04:46] in this day if a person can't see what's
[1:04:49] happening to the young people
[1:04:51] if he can't see what what what's caused
[1:04:54] all this transgender homosexuals and
[1:04:57] perverseness it was because Satan snuck
[1:04:59] a good one
[1:05:00] he anointed them people he anoints these
[1:05:04] fashion designers to make our boys look
[1:05:07] like sissies
[1:05:11] he does
[1:05:12] I'm gonna go even further he and I
[1:05:14] believe he anoints our scientists and
[1:05:17] all that to put stuff in our Foods
[1:05:20] to break down our mental capacities to
[1:05:22] break down to where women can't have
[1:05:24] children
[1:05:25] he knows what he's doing
[1:05:28] and it's all an anointing
[1:05:32] see there's an objective but there was
[1:05:35] an objective why God sent a prophet
[1:05:37] there's an objective why God sends the
[1:05:40] Holy Ghost there's an objective why God
[1:05:42] sends his faithful Ministry
[1:05:44] there's an objective to these things
[1:05:48] it's a Ministry
[1:05:51] now this objective
[1:05:54] the subjective in in the Sons and
[1:05:58] Daughters of God is the main focus
[1:06:01] of it all
[1:06:02] you believe it
[1:06:04] the Sons and Daughters of God and that's
[1:06:06] what I want to talk about this morning
[1:06:08] because the Sons and Daughters of God
[1:06:10] are the elective God
[1:06:13] and we know that
[1:06:17] God's Ministry of course does not affect
[1:06:19] all human human beings
[1:06:22] in the way it does his elect
[1:06:26] now say that again God's Ministry
[1:06:29] doesn't affect all human beings in the
[1:06:32] way it does his elect
[1:06:36] but it wasn't for them
[1:06:38] it was for the elect see God's Ministry
[1:06:42] God's not wasting time with this
[1:06:44] ministry
[1:06:45] God's Ministry has full effect
[1:06:49] upon the Sons and Daughters of God
[1:06:52] ain't that right upon the election we
[1:06:56] find and and we uh it wasn't online last
[1:07:01] week but we talked about the the Holy
[1:07:04] Ghost being God's agent
[1:07:05] and how he's he's the main agent angels
[1:07:08] and all that that's they're they're
[1:07:10] they're they're they're they're they're
[1:07:11] part of that Ministry
[1:07:13] but the Holy Ghost is the agent of God
[1:07:17] ain't that right and and but but we we
[1:07:21] look and and God doesn't reveal himself
[1:07:24] just to anyone
[1:07:25] and and I want us to hopefully identify
[1:07:29] as ourselves as being the elect and and
[1:07:33] see how special we really are
[1:07:36] but uh uh God doesn't reveal himself
[1:07:39] just anyone Luke 10 21 in that hour
[1:07:43] Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I
[1:07:46] think the old father Lord of Heaven and
[1:07:49] Earth that thou has hid these things
[1:07:51] from the wise and prudent and has
[1:07:54] revealed them unto babes even so father
[1:07:57] for so uh it seemed good in thy sight
[1:08:02] you think of that the the the the the
[1:08:04] fact that you believe the message the
[1:08:07] fact that you see what God is doing in
[1:08:09] this day do you realize it was pleasing
[1:08:12] to God to show you these things
[1:08:15] and and and he says all things are
[1:08:18] delivered to me of my father and no man
[1:08:21] knoweth who the son is but the father
[1:08:23] and who the father is but the son and he
[1:08:26] everybody say he that's me that's you
[1:08:29] he to whom the son will reveal him now
[1:08:34] we look at uh Luke 17 and 26 through 30
[1:08:38] it talks about the son of man being
[1:08:40] revealed in this day as it was in the
[1:08:42] days of Noah so shall it be also in the
[1:08:45] days of the son of man they did eat they
[1:08:48] drank they married wives they were given
[1:08:50] in marriage in other words marriage
[1:08:51] divorce and all these things until the
[1:08:54] day that Noah entered into the ark and
[1:08:56] the flood came and destroyed them all
[1:08:58] likewise also in the days of lot they
[1:09:01] did eat they drank more restaurants than
[1:09:04] we ever have right they drank they
[1:09:06] bought they sold they planted they build
[1:09:09] it more construction all of these things
[1:09:12] that we're seeing today but the same day
[1:09:15] that lot went out of Sodom it rained
[1:09:17] fire and brimstone from heaven and
[1:09:19] destroyed them all even thus shall it be
[1:09:22] in the day when the son of man is
[1:09:24] revealed well he's not just revealing
[1:09:27] there's got to be a people to see the
[1:09:29] revelation
[1:09:30] there's got to be a people to whom he
[1:09:32] reveals it to now he looked at this age
[1:09:36] and it pleased the father to choose an
[1:09:40] elected group of people that would see
[1:09:43] this revealing
[1:09:45] and you say Amen now John 14 18 I will
[1:09:49] not leave you comfortless I will come to
[1:09:52] you and yet a little while the world
[1:09:54] seeth me no more see as me no more in
[1:09:56] other words the father ain't revealing
[1:09:58] it to them but you see me because I live
[1:10:02] you shall live also at that day you
[1:10:05] shall know that I am in the father so
[1:10:07] notice the Revelation that is to be in
[1:10:09] this age is not seeing a physical man
[1:10:12] not seeing a physical being but to see
[1:10:15] the Revelation that he is in the father
[1:10:17] I am in him and he is in me
[1:10:25] the world will no longer see him
[1:10:28] but a select group will see him and they
[1:10:31] will see him in what it truly is and the
[1:10:34] Revelation is Christ in US
[1:10:37] Christ in me
[1:10:39] now just as it was in the days of lot
[1:10:42] God revealed himself to Abraham
[1:10:45] not a lot
[1:10:47] ain't that right there's not a person
[1:10:49] who can know God without it being
[1:10:51] revealed as to who he is it even has to
[1:10:55] be revealed to the elect predestinated
[1:10:58] of God even to those that God
[1:11:02] predestined to see it it still has to be
[1:11:05] revealed to them or they will never see
[1:11:08] it that's why we call it the grace of
[1:11:10] God the mercy of God that God would take
[1:11:13] the time to open our eyes to the things
[1:11:17] he's doing
[1:11:20] First Corinthians 12 and 3 says that no
[1:11:23] man can say Jesus is the Lord but by the
[1:11:25] Holy Ghost
[1:11:26] God's agent
[1:11:28] the ministry right
[1:11:30] see brother Brown said you cannot
[1:11:32] believe that Jesus is the Christ until
[1:11:34] you have received the baptism of the
[1:11:36] Holy Ghost you're only testifying or
[1:11:39] saying what the scripture says saying
[1:11:41] what the pastor says saying what mother
[1:11:43] says saying or some good preacher says
[1:11:45] but you don't know it yourself until he
[1:11:49] has witnessed his resurrection to you
[1:11:52] aren't you glad for God's agent amen see
[1:11:55] and you you you can never know truly
[1:11:59] know that Jesus is the Christ unless God
[1:12:02] himself has bore witness to you by the
[1:12:05] Holy Ghost no man can call Jesus to
[1:12:09] Christ truly genuinely
[1:12:11] call him the Christ
[1:12:14] except by the Holy Ghost
[1:12:16] ain't that right
[1:12:17] see so the Holy Ghost is God's agent as
[1:12:20] we talked about see now John the Baptist
[1:12:23] brother Brown said John the Baptist
[1:12:25] would have never known Jesus
[1:12:28] If he if it had not been for the Holy
[1:12:30] Ghost pointing him out
[1:12:33] and yet John was already written in the
[1:12:35] Scriptures it was written of John that
[1:12:38] he would foretell and he would he would
[1:12:40] uh bring the announcement and he would
[1:12:42] he would introduce the Lamb of God ain't
[1:12:44] that right but yet John being a
[1:12:47] predestinated man he could not do it
[1:12:51] until the Holy Ghost revealed it to him
[1:12:56] John said to the people there is one
[1:12:58] standing among you right now an ordinary
[1:13:01] man that is here somewheres
[1:13:04] he's the Lamb of God
[1:13:06] see it was revealed by the Holy Ghost
[1:13:08] brother Brian said that's the only way
[1:13:10] you'll know him today the only way
[1:13:13] you'll get the threefold revelation of
[1:13:15] God is for the Holy Ghost and the only
[1:13:17] way it can ever be is your predestinated
[1:13:21] to see it
[1:13:22] now think of the Holy Ghost can fall
[1:13:24] upon everybody but only those that are
[1:13:27] predestinated to see it will see it see
[1:13:30] the ministry of God works for the elect
[1:13:34] [Music]
[1:13:35] they they can criticize this message all
[1:13:38] they want to but I was predestinated to
[1:13:41] see it I was predestinated to believe it
[1:13:45] I can't help what they do they come up
[1:13:47] with other stupid questions I ain't got
[1:13:49] time for their stupid questions
[1:13:52] it's their questions not mine
[1:13:57] that's right and I don't have to answer
[1:13:59] their questions
[1:14:00] God's already answered it
[1:14:02] God's already proven it to be right
[1:14:05] the fact is they can't see it
[1:14:10] they want to criticize it it shows ain't
[1:14:12] predestinated to it
[1:14:17] see so the only way you can ever you it
[1:14:21] can ever be is your predestinated to see
[1:14:24] it if it don't you'll never see it
[1:14:26] if you're not predestinated to see it
[1:14:28] you'll never see it because that light
[1:14:30] can Flash and you'll go away and make
[1:14:33] fun of it explain it away by some
[1:14:36] intellectual conception when the very
[1:14:38] God himself manifesting himself and
[1:14:41] proving it but if it ain't upon you to
[1:14:44] see it you won't see it
[1:14:46] see so everything that God has done in
[1:14:50] his ministry from from the foundation of
[1:14:53] the world to uh before the foundation of
[1:14:55] the world to now has been done for his
[1:14:58] elect every promise that God has made to
[1:15:01] his church has been for his elect
[1:15:05] you believe it amen that's that's right
[1:15:07] see and and and who are the elect those
[1:15:11] who have their names written in the
[1:15:14] Lamb's Book of Life and when were they
[1:15:18] written
[1:15:19] before the foundation of the world
[1:15:21] ain't that right so see they are the
[1:15:23] ones that are secure they are the ones
[1:15:25] they their names can never ever be taken
[1:15:29] off the book
[1:15:32] but you're glad for that
[1:15:33] now let's just talk about it
[1:15:36] for just a few moments
[1:15:38] but we we've talked years ago I guess
[1:15:41] now but
[1:15:42] and and most of you know it but just
[1:15:45] maybe for the young people
[1:15:47] but there is what the Bible calls The
[1:15:50] Book of Life
[1:15:51] and there is the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:15:54] they are not two different books per se
[1:15:58] really Brown says there is no basis for
[1:16:00] the claims that the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:16:02] is not the same as the Book of Life
[1:16:06] and so brother Branham teaches it as
[1:16:08] being one book and then he would teach
[1:16:11] it as though they're two separate books
[1:16:13] and he's not con contradicting himself
[1:16:16] but he is showing that it is all one
[1:16:19] book
[1:16:20] it's like the Bible it's a book
[1:16:23] but there's 66 books within this book
[1:16:27] ain't that right
[1:16:29] so so in this book
[1:16:32] there and and I'm gonna use this in this
[1:16:36] book
[1:16:36] there's the Lamb's Book of Life and the
[1:16:39] Book of Life
[1:16:43] and and and so
[1:16:45] uh uh it's it's
[1:16:48] I believe that this Bible is what we're
[1:16:51] going to be judged by
[1:16:53] you believe it every man
[1:16:56] every man I don't care who they are burn
[1:16:59] the Bible but they're going to be judged
[1:17:01] by it
[1:17:02] let us gather up in on the coffee table
[1:17:05] that they're going to be judged by this
[1:17:06] book
[1:17:09] foreign
[1:17:12] it's amazing that this book has remained
[1:17:16] the best seller
[1:17:19] for
[1:17:20] centuries
[1:17:22] and still is the best seller
[1:17:25] it's the most bought sought book
[1:17:27] that's ever been
[1:17:31] is the Bible
[1:17:34] and yet only the elect
[1:17:37] can see its Pages or the con understand
[1:17:40] its contents
[1:17:42] through a prophet of this age
[1:17:45] but why is it it's because there's
[1:17:47] something about it
[1:17:49] and I believe that people know they're
[1:17:50] going to be judged by this book
[1:17:52] it's going to be the judgment
[1:17:54] can you say man
[1:17:56] so we we find that the Lamb's Book of
[1:17:59] Life
[1:18:00] only has a limited amount of names on it
[1:18:05] which God wrote before the foundation of
[1:18:07] the world he is not currently adding
[1:18:10] names
[1:18:12] he has never added names throughout time
[1:18:17] David's time Moses time or whatever
[1:18:20] and then brother Brandon would say
[1:18:22] nothing will be saved only those whose
[1:18:26] names were put in the Lamb's Book of
[1:18:29] Life before the foundation of the world
[1:18:32] and I'll say it this way there's not one
[1:18:34] that's going to make it in a rapture
[1:18:37] unless their names are written in this
[1:18:39] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:18:42] there's going to be a lot of people make
[1:18:43] it to heaven
[1:18:46] but even babies when they die they go to
[1:18:49] heaven
[1:18:50] but it determines if their name is
[1:18:54] written on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:18:55] whether they go in the rapture
[1:19:00] amen
[1:19:02] so see it's it's those names not one of
[1:19:06] those names that he put on the Lamb's
[1:19:08] Book of Life can ever be taken off
[1:19:11] they are the ones that God called
[1:19:14] Justified
[1:19:16] Sanctified and already glorified
[1:19:21] when before the foundation of the world
[1:19:25] amen
[1:19:27] and the prophet said he's already made a
[1:19:31] place for them in glory
[1:19:34] every name that is written in the Lamb's
[1:19:37] Book of Life he's already made a place
[1:19:39] for them in glory
[1:19:41] before we ever come into sin
[1:19:45] we were born in sin shaping in iniquity
[1:19:48] come to this world speaking we were we
[1:19:51] were no good rotten Sinners and yet God
[1:19:55] had already made a place for us in glory
[1:20:00] it's pretty powerful
[1:20:02] second Corinthians 5 1 for we know that
[1:20:05] if our Earthly house uh of this
[1:20:08] Tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[1:20:09] building and house not made with hands
[1:20:12] Eternal in the heavens this is not
[1:20:14] something that will be when we die this
[1:20:17] is something that's already there
[1:20:19] you already have a body waiting for you
[1:20:22] in glory
[1:20:23] and you say Amen so so so if if if we
[1:20:28] can understand I I pray that you could
[1:20:30] understand where I'm trying to come from
[1:20:33] as far as God's Ministry having an
[1:20:36] objective
[1:20:37] see so second Peter 3 and 9 the Lord is
[1:20:41] not slack concerning his promise as some
[1:20:44] men count slackness but Islam suffering
[1:20:47] to us word not willing everybody say not
[1:20:50] willing that any should perish but that
[1:20:54] all should come to repentance but we
[1:20:57] already know that not all is going to
[1:20:59] come to repentance
[1:21:01] hey ain't that right yet God is not
[1:21:04] willing that that any should perish but
[1:21:07] that all should come to repentance but
[1:21:10] God doesn't work he's not working as a
[1:21:13] guest thing like we do you know we we're
[1:21:16] hoping we're wishing we're we're we're
[1:21:18] believing we're what whatever see uh uh
[1:21:22] we don't know what tomorrow's going to
[1:21:24] be but but maybe there's something we
[1:21:26] really want and and so we're hoping that
[1:21:29] that everything will work out to what we
[1:21:31] want it to be and amen but God's not
[1:21:34] doing that amen he already knows what
[1:21:38] will be by his infinite mind
[1:21:42] ain't that right that's why he could
[1:21:44] already secure our future that's why he
[1:21:45] could already secure us amen has already
[1:21:48] being there before we've had anything to
[1:21:51] do with it
[1:21:52] so now the prophet says see but God but
[1:21:56] being God he had to know and does know
[1:21:58] the end from the beginning if he doesn't
[1:22:01] then he is an infinite and if he is not
[1:22:04] infinite he isn't God so he wasn't
[1:22:06] willing and certainly that any should
[1:22:08] perish but he knowing who would perish
[1:22:11] and who would not perish that's the
[1:22:13] reason the very purpose that Jesus come
[1:22:15] to the Earth was to save those that God
[1:22:18] through his foreknowledge seen that
[1:22:21] wanted to be saved because the whole
[1:22:23] world was condemned ain't that right so
[1:22:26] so as the world would put it that Jesus
[1:22:28] is there he's he's got his his hands and
[1:22:31] he's reaching out for everyone he's sad
[1:22:35] amen because so many are rejecting him
[1:22:38] today and and he's trying he's
[1:22:40] compelling and and it almost would seem
[1:22:43] as though he's defeated amen because
[1:22:46] everybody's spit in his face still and
[1:22:48] all that well he's not defeated
[1:22:52] and that's not what Calvary is all about
[1:22:55] he come to save his own which was his
[1:22:59] elect before the foundation of the world
[1:23:01] every one of those names that's who he
[1:23:04] come for
[1:23:07] amen amen
[1:23:09] and that's why the ministry is not in
[1:23:12] vain
[1:23:14] the ministry
[1:23:15] isn't in vain
[1:23:18] see so now uh uh so he says see the uh
[1:23:23] uh God he was to save those that God
[1:23:26] through his foreign wanted to be saved
[1:23:28] because the whole world was condemned
[1:23:29] he's I don't see how we could teach it
[1:23:31] any other way than the foreknowledge of
[1:23:35] God and the Bible plainly says that he
[1:23:38] knows the end from the beginning and can
[1:23:40] tell it
[1:23:41] so here's second Timothy 2 and 19. amen
[1:23:45] uh it says nevertheless the foundation
[1:23:48] of God standeth Shore having this seal
[1:23:52] the Lord knoweth them that are his
[1:23:58] you believe that
[1:24:01] so you see why do we have Revival
[1:24:03] meetings why why does the presence of
[1:24:05] God just come Amen in in our services in
[1:24:08] the local church and local assembly or
[1:24:10] why why why why do we have these things
[1:24:13] is because it's not in vain we've seen
[1:24:16] people come to the altars and they walk
[1:24:18] out and they nothing nothing happens
[1:24:20] it's almost like water falling on the
[1:24:22] Ducks back and and all these things but
[1:24:25] it's for that elect
[1:24:27] God will have one meeting and will call
[1:24:30] an assembly of thousands for one person
[1:24:37] and you say Amen everything that God
[1:24:40] does is for that elect
[1:24:43] the Holy Ghost will fall all over the
[1:24:45] building but it could be just for that
[1:24:47] one elect people could be dancing and
[1:24:50] shouting and speaking in tongues and all
[1:24:52] that but it's for that one elect
[1:24:55] I've seen people speak in tongues and
[1:24:57] live like Hypocrites I've seen them
[1:24:59] dance and shout and roll on the floor
[1:25:01] and live like Hypocrites but I've also
[1:25:03] seen them people that God has touched
[1:25:06] with an eternal touch
[1:25:12] the Lord knoweth them
[1:25:14] that are his
[1:25:17] so the prophet said see therefore when a
[1:25:19] person tries to be something that
[1:25:20] they're not they're only making an
[1:25:22] impersonation and sooner or later it
[1:25:24] will find you out
[1:25:26] your sins will find you out you cannot
[1:25:28] cover them notice what he says now
[1:25:30] there's only one covering for sin do you
[1:25:32] believe that it ain't the pope it ain't
[1:25:35] a preacher it ain't your dad and mom
[1:25:38] they can tell you whatever is fine but
[1:25:41] you better have it right with God
[1:25:45] that's right there's only one Covenant
[1:25:47] for sin and that's the blood of Jesus
[1:25:49] Christ and it cannot be applied unless
[1:25:52] God has called you from the foundation
[1:25:55] of the world
[1:25:57] so the blood cannot be applied just to
[1:25:59] anybody
[1:26:03] it's a plaid it was shed a man for those
[1:26:07] who were in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:26:10] God's whole Ministry is for that elect
[1:26:21] this way we'll have a Rapture that's why
[1:26:23] we're the bride of Christ every one of
[1:26:25] those who in the in the Lamb's Book of
[1:26:27] Life
[1:26:28] they are the bride of Christ
[1:26:30] they are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:26:32] they'll never stand in judgment
[1:26:34] they'll never enter into that place of
[1:26:37] of judgment in in Wrath everyone else
[1:26:40] will
[1:26:42] and there will be those that will make
[1:26:44] it to heaven but they they don't have
[1:26:46] blood
[1:26:47] they don't have that atonement in its
[1:26:49] fullness we'll put it that way
[1:26:51] hello
[1:26:53] and they got to go through and face the
[1:26:55] wrath of God they've got to go through
[1:26:56] it they got to go through the
[1:26:57] tribulation but this bride will not
[1:27:01] this blood do you realize the blood of
[1:27:03] Christ is so powerful
[1:27:05] one drop one drop of blood
[1:27:08] is powerful enough to take all sins away
[1:27:11] one drop
[1:27:17] but why because it's only for the elect
[1:27:22] you're free by the blood of Christ
[1:27:25] ain't that right
[1:27:29] so we find that's what the blood was
[1:27:31] shed for
[1:27:33] see it cannot be applied unless God has
[1:27:36] called you from the foundation of the
[1:27:37] world that's what the blood was shed for
[1:27:39] not to be tramped upon made fun of job
[1:27:42] that and evenly spoke of and so forth it
[1:27:45] was for a direct purpose
[1:27:48] the blood of Jesus Christ was for the a
[1:27:51] direct purpose
[1:27:53] that's right not to be played with not
[1:27:55] to be impersonated by saying that's the
[1:27:57] sins are covered when they're not and no
[1:28:00] man can have his sins covered lest his
[1:28:02] name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:28:05] before the foundation of the world and
[1:28:07] Jesus said no man can come to me except
[1:28:10] my father draws him and all that the
[1:28:12] father hath past tense given me will
[1:28:16] come to me
[1:28:18] ain't that right
[1:28:21] now as we go here further a little bit
[1:28:24] uh both the book and life and the Lamb's
[1:28:27] Book of Life deal with life
[1:28:30] they deal with life but one one
[1:28:34] deals with our natural life our natural
[1:28:37] birth
[1:28:39] and the other one deals with life
[1:28:41] according to our spiritual birth
[1:28:44] amen so I'm going to read you some
[1:28:46] quotes but brother Brown said it's the
[1:28:48] same book but one of them is your
[1:28:51] natural birth the other one is your
[1:28:53] spiritual birth one leads out to the
[1:28:56] other one just like a stalk of wheat
[1:28:58] whenever you talk to me you talk to me
[1:29:01] as a living person but there's a part of
[1:29:03] me here is that person that must perish
[1:29:09] right see that's the book that the name
[1:29:12] comes off of
[1:29:16] so so there's the Book of Life we'll
[1:29:19] just say the Book of Life deals with our
[1:29:21] Natural Life
[1:29:22] according to our natural birth
[1:29:25] but that's not and in that natural birth
[1:29:27] we were sinners
[1:29:29] we were condemned to die we were a
[1:29:32] hopeless case we were wretched by that
[1:29:35] natural birth we couldn't even come into
[1:29:36] the presence of God without being
[1:29:38] condemned
[1:29:39] ain't that right all of these things but
[1:29:42] that part must perish
[1:29:45] thank God for your ministry
[1:29:49] that part must perish
[1:29:51] see that's the book the name comes off
[1:29:53] of but the Eternal one
[1:29:55] the predestinated one the elected one
[1:29:58] that name can never come off from there
[1:30:01] because it always was on it and it can
[1:30:05] never be taken off
[1:30:07] can you say man see so you were a
[1:30:10] Christian before you ever become a
[1:30:12] Christian
[1:30:13] right right
[1:30:14] and in the end you you you will be a
[1:30:16] Christian because that's what God
[1:30:18] predestinated you to be in the beginning
[1:30:21] right you were a son and daughter of God
[1:30:24] before you ever projected yourself as
[1:30:26] being a saint you might have hated God
[1:30:28] you may have hated Church there's
[1:30:30] nothing well there's nothing about our
[1:30:33] sinful life in our sinful condition that
[1:30:36] we wanted God
[1:30:38] that we sought after God you didn't seek
[1:30:41] after God God sought after you
[1:30:43] God's agent the Holy Ghost shot after
[1:30:46] you
[1:30:49] it's true
[1:30:51] he saw it went through the alleys to
[1:30:53] find you went in the bar rooms to find
[1:30:55] you went in The Honky Tonks to find you
[1:30:57] he went into the lowliness of your life
[1:31:00] and and and to find you
[1:31:04] ain't that right why because before you
[1:31:07] knew it he already knew you and put your
[1:31:10] name on the Lamb's Book of Life and
[1:31:12] every one of us who has her name in the
[1:31:14] Lamb's Book of Life the end of our life
[1:31:16] will be Victory the end of our life will
[1:31:19] be exactly the way he saw us to be in
[1:31:21] the first place
[1:31:25] do you believe it
[1:31:26] see so they're the Eternal and the
[1:31:29] predestinated one the elected one that
[1:31:31] name can never come off from there
[1:31:32] because it always was it can never be
[1:31:34] taken off
[1:31:35] see now see the Baptists say believe
[1:31:38] there's two separate books and in one
[1:31:39] way it is two separate books another way
[1:31:42] it is in two separate books see so he
[1:31:45] says I'm two separate people I'm Body
[1:31:46] Soul Spirit these the three separate
[1:31:49] people but only one makes me as a being
[1:31:53] right so there's only one Book of Life
[1:31:56] One there's only real one Book of Life
[1:32:00] see uh uh like there was a one germ of
[1:32:05] the wheat that come up to the stalk and
[1:32:07] went through the tassel and out through
[1:32:09] the husk and into the wheat all the way
[1:32:12] along there you say well now that's a
[1:32:15] wheatling there it isn't the wheat it's
[1:32:17] the stock
[1:32:19] I hope you're getting it but together
[1:32:21] it's a wheat
[1:32:23] but it had to go through stages
[1:32:25] ain't that right you might be looking at
[1:32:28] the wheat but but it's not the wheat
[1:32:30] that's the stop that's the tussle that's
[1:32:33] the shock
[1:32:35] but keep hanging in there
[1:32:37] what was in the ground to begin with it
[1:32:40] will come out
[1:32:44] ain't that right
[1:32:46] so so he says see so it isn't the wheat
[1:32:49] is the stock but together it's the wheat
[1:32:51] see it's the wheat because it's all one
[1:32:55] stock but the wheat is what you're
[1:32:57] talking about the grain at the end of it
[1:33:01] the others were a carrier and it must
[1:33:04] perish
[1:33:05] oh I hope you understand your physical
[1:33:09] this whole body full of corruption
[1:33:14] if I could say it this way it's not the
[1:33:16] son of God
[1:33:17] that that's just a body of corruption
[1:33:20] it's the carrier
[1:33:22] of what you really are
[1:33:24] it's the carrier of that predestinated
[1:33:27] seed and it had to go through its stages
[1:33:29] and all of that it's just a carrier but
[1:33:32] this whole body is going to be changed
[1:33:34] don't put all your time on this body
[1:33:38] can you say Amen
[1:33:40] see so so we find he said see it must
[1:33:44] perish the others were his carrier it
[1:33:45] must perish see that's the one now see
[1:33:48] one place sounds like you can have your
[1:33:49] name taken off the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:33:51] the other place you can't do it see well
[1:33:53] that that's where it is see it's all in
[1:33:55] that great Revelation there which was
[1:33:57] made known during the time of the Seven
[1:33:59] Seals why is it how some people can't
[1:34:02] believe it Jesus said no man can come to
[1:34:04] me except my father first draw him and
[1:34:06] all that the father has given me will
[1:34:08] come to me no man can understand who he
[1:34:11] is or how it is except to be revealed to
[1:34:14] you by the revelation of God
[1:34:17] can you say Amen see you're standing
[1:34:20] here a lot of people going to church
[1:34:21] these days amen millions of people well
[1:34:24] I don't know it may be getting down to a
[1:34:26] few now but uh they're at the ball games
[1:34:28] and all but but there are people that
[1:34:30] are all over the place that are going to
[1:34:32] church but there's an elect in this
[1:34:36] we're all human beings but in there
[1:34:38] there is a seed
[1:34:42] that was predestined before the
[1:34:44] foundation of the world
[1:34:47] amen
[1:34:49] now notice life is a sacred thing to God
[1:34:52] the prophet said and it's recorded in a
[1:34:54] book
[1:34:55] and God is the author of life
[1:34:58] in another message he says God never
[1:35:01] forgets all of our Deeds
[1:35:03] are recorded on The Book of Life
[1:35:07] all of our Deeds
[1:35:10] now brother Branham explains it speaking
[1:35:12] to the bride he said see our natural
[1:35:14] life here
[1:35:15] that we have is just the perversion
[1:35:18] it really should be the right life to
[1:35:21] begin with but it's perverted by the
[1:35:24] natural birth
[1:35:26] the first life everybody say the first
[1:35:28] life
[1:35:29] or your first Union
[1:35:33] you were joined in at Birth by Nature a
[1:35:36] natural act a natural human being being
[1:35:39] associated a natural human being
[1:35:42] associated see man and woman together
[1:35:44] Associated together in sexual Affair
[1:35:46] which brought your first life here and
[1:35:50] that's associated with sin and death
[1:35:52] so brother Branham talks about our first
[1:35:55] life which is our first nature it's a
[1:36:00] life that was is a perverted Life by our
[1:36:02] natural birth
[1:36:04] and if you notice brother Brandon talks
[1:36:06] about it uh maybe an invisible Union of
[1:36:09] the Bride where he talks about he
[1:36:12] mentions our first life our first
[1:36:14] husband
[1:36:16] our first nature
[1:36:18] everything first right first first
[1:36:20] that's all we've known so he calls it
[1:36:23] our first
[1:36:27] uh that's that's that's the beginning of
[1:36:30] what we understand
[1:36:32] right
[1:36:33] our first born in sin
[1:36:36] condemned wretched miserable
[1:36:40] yeah
[1:36:41] maybe a prostitute maybe a drunk
[1:36:45] maybe maybe a liar a thief
[1:36:49] whatever see so he says now it was
[1:36:51] nature associated with death
[1:36:54] right
[1:36:55] associated with death your first husband
[1:36:57] that had rule over you
[1:37:01] was your Nature by natural birth
[1:37:04] natural see you love the world because
[1:37:07] you are of the world part of the world
[1:37:10] your desires was by nature to love the
[1:37:13] world see which you're a part of you see
[1:37:16] that's your natural thing that's the
[1:37:19] reason you have to be born again
[1:37:22] don't ever try to be a Christian by that
[1:37:24] natural birth
[1:37:26] thing has got to dismiss that
[1:37:31] to separate you have to die to that
[1:37:34] first husband you can't live with it you
[1:37:37] can't just say well I'll divorce him and
[1:37:38] hang him up here till occasion no
[1:37:41] certain writing of divorcement he dies
[1:37:44] everybody say he dies that nature dies
[1:37:49] that's the thing see the nature of the
[1:37:51] world has to die every Speck of him has
[1:37:54] to die
[1:37:55] you have to be reunited again with
[1:37:58] another nature
[1:37:59] ain't that right now that's what God's
[1:38:02] Ministry is all about is to bring
[1:38:04] another nature
[1:38:09] see a lot of people look at the
[1:38:11] Ministries that are today bypass the new
[1:38:13] birth
[1:38:15] joining in church
[1:38:17] as long as you're fine you feel good
[1:38:20] that's fine
[1:38:23] and it's got to the place where they
[1:38:25] they dismiss the sins
[1:38:27] forgive the sins
[1:38:29] talk about the Catholic Church you know
[1:38:31] you have to pay go to the priest and pay
[1:38:34] your Penance and all that and then
[1:38:35] you're fine
[1:38:36] you can lie you can be whatever you want
[1:38:38] to and just as long as you make your
[1:38:40] confession
[1:38:41] and then then they write it off but God
[1:38:44] doesn't write it off that way
[1:38:46] see so so so the their the ministry of
[1:38:50] God is to bring a new birth what what is
[1:38:54] that there them seeds them names have
[1:38:56] got to be quickened
[1:38:59] ain't that right yes sir so then your
[1:39:03] name of your first nature was born and
[1:39:05] put in a book of life
[1:39:07] all your Deeds was wrote in it too
[1:39:09] everything you've done under that nature
[1:39:12] by say under that nature under that
[1:39:15] nature was put in a book
[1:39:17] called The Book of Life
[1:39:20] ain't that right so so then what you did
[1:39:23] as a sinner is recorded in the Book of
[1:39:27] Life
[1:39:28] and you realize people are going to be
[1:39:30] judged by that book
[1:39:33] sure are let's look at it Daniel 7 is
[1:39:36] this all right Daniel 7 9 I beheld till
[1:39:39] the Thrones were cast down and the
[1:39:41] Ancient of Days did sit whose garments
[1:39:43] garment was white as snow and the hair
[1:39:45] of his head was like pure wool his
[1:39:47] throne was like a fiery flame and his
[1:39:50] wheels as burning fire a fiery stream
[1:39:53] issued and came forth from before him
[1:39:55] thousands and thousands ministered unto
[1:39:58] him and tens Ten Thousand Times Ten
[1:40:01] Thousand stood before him and the
[1:40:04] Judgment was sent and the books were
[1:40:06] open
[1:40:08] Revelations 20 and 12 and I saw the dead
[1:40:11] small and great
[1:40:13] stand before God and the books were open
[1:40:15] and another book was open which is The
[1:40:18] Book of Life and the dead were judged
[1:40:20] out of those things which were written
[1:40:22] in the books according to their works
[1:40:25] and the Sea gave up the dead which were
[1:40:28] in it death and Hell delivered up the
[1:40:30] dead which were in them and they were
[1:40:32] judged every man according to their
[1:40:34] works see men are going to be judged
[1:40:37] according to their works
[1:40:41] hello that's right politicians can get
[1:40:45] away with what they're doing but they're
[1:40:46] coming to this book right here
[1:40:48] they're going to be judged
[1:40:52] they they can pull all kinds of schemes
[1:40:54] and dictators and all that but they all
[1:40:56] every one of them both small and great
[1:40:59] it's going to come to this book right
[1:41:00] here and be judged
[1:41:04] and they're going to stand before the
[1:41:05] white Throne judgment
[1:41:08] there will be no blood
[1:41:11] to atone for them
[1:41:13] ain't that right
[1:41:15] now brother Brown said think of it the
[1:41:18] only thing that'll back off God is blood
[1:41:22] the only thing that's going to back him
[1:41:24] off
[1:41:26] is blood and there's only one blood that
[1:41:28] he'll back away from and that's his own
[1:41:30] son when he sees that his that's his own
[1:41:35] son's blood he'll back away back see
[1:41:39] because that's the gift see God is given
[1:41:42] to his son to redeem God gave us his son
[1:41:46] to redeem those who he foreknew and it
[1:41:51] brings God back from his judgment aren't
[1:41:54] you glad for that
[1:41:55] this is what the ministry of God is all
[1:41:58] about is that God could have fellowship
[1:42:01] with those predestinated elect
[1:42:06] but when that blood is removed and all
[1:42:09] that was foreknown has been called into
[1:42:10] the precious body his church has been
[1:42:13] ready made ready and taken up then God's
[1:42:15] Wrath is on the people oh brother don't
[1:42:18] ever want to stand there don't let me
[1:42:20] stand before a machine or he says let me
[1:42:22] stand before machine gun let me be cut
[1:42:23] to Pieces let me be sold inch by inch
[1:42:26] let anything happen as the oath of the
[1:42:28] Knights of Columbus let them split open
[1:42:31] my belly and burn sulfur and everything
[1:42:33] in me and my arms and legs cut off
[1:42:35] whatever it may be but never let me
[1:42:38] stand at the white Throne judgment
[1:42:40] before God it isn't going to be a pretty
[1:42:42] day that day
[1:42:44] can you say Amen but I want to say this
[1:42:47] the elect everybody say the elect will
[1:42:50] never have to stand there
[1:42:52] the elect will never have that's what
[1:42:54] the ministry of God was all about
[1:42:58] it'll never have to stand there
[1:43:01] and I want to just say this you ought to
[1:43:03] appreciate the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:43:05] you ought to appreciate the Holy Ghost
[1:43:07] when it leads you away and convicts you
[1:43:09] of your wrongs and I'll say this you
[1:43:12] ought to appreciate a man of God that'll
[1:43:13] preach this message I don't care if it
[1:43:16] skins you I don't care if it blows
[1:43:18] everything away from you and you're just
[1:43:19] left standing just a few feathers at
[1:43:22] least God had his Mercy to tell you
[1:43:24] where you're wrong so you don't have to
[1:43:26] stand there before the white Throne
[1:43:28] judgment
[1:43:30] it's the ministry of God
[1:43:36] what is it God's preserving life
[1:43:39] ain't that right
[1:43:40] the elect will never have to stand
[1:43:42] before the white Throne judgment
[1:43:45] why they were separated
[1:43:48] from their first Union
[1:43:51] I was separated are you separated
[1:43:55] separated from that First Union
[1:43:57] my first nature my spiritual death
[1:44:01] ain't that right remember your first
[1:44:04] husband was your first Nature by your
[1:44:06] natural birth
[1:44:08] but no longer are you accounted of that
[1:44:11] no longer do you walk by that no longer
[1:44:14] does God look at you as that you've been
[1:44:17] divorced you're separated that old
[1:44:19] Nature has died your first husband has
[1:44:23] died
[1:44:24] yet you may be full of mistakes but it's
[1:44:26] not a counter to you you may fall down
[1:44:29] but as brother Terry reminded me of that
[1:44:31] scripture what is it the righteous may
[1:44:33] fall down seven times but God will lift
[1:44:36] him up
[1:44:37] can you say man why there's a blood in
[1:44:41] this ministry
[1:44:42] there's a power of reconciliation
[1:44:47] and when God once does the work it's
[1:44:49] over
[1:44:53] now notice brother Brown says now see
[1:44:55] your natural desire is to cut your hair
[1:44:59] your natural desires to wear shorts and
[1:45:01] paint your face
[1:45:03] and I'm gonna put it this way your
[1:45:04] natural desires to see what how far you
[1:45:06] can go without sinning
[1:45:11] these these ladies that are putting her
[1:45:14] pants on
[1:45:15] under their skirts
[1:45:19] I think it's hypocritical
[1:45:22] I think they need a new birth
[1:45:26] yeah but I can't go skiing unless
[1:45:28] I can't go and do things that boys do
[1:45:30] unless God didn't call you to be a boy
[1:45:33] God didn't call you to act like a boy be
[1:45:36] satisfied with what God called you to be
[1:45:39] hey yes all right not on cause you to
[1:45:42] charge you anything that was free but
[1:45:47] you see we're not here to see what we
[1:45:49] can get by with
[1:45:51] to get away with
[1:45:53] well let's just see how far brother
[1:45:55] Brown said if there's a question to it
[1:45:56] don't do it
[1:46:02] and the problem is people ain't got
[1:46:03] their convictions anymore and they ain't
[1:46:05] their conscience are seared to where
[1:46:07] there's no questions
[1:46:11] they've gotten so far to say I'll do it
[1:46:13] anyways
[1:46:14] and what they're doing is they're
[1:46:16] pushing that conscience back
[1:46:17] they're silenced that voice to where now
[1:46:20] they're able to do anything walk where
[1:46:23] Angel well the Bible word the Bible or
[1:46:25] the the poem walk with hobner's shoes
[1:46:28] Where Angels Fear to trod
[1:46:34] uce

[1:46:56] everybody just want to talk about me and
[1:46:57] all this just just just I'm going to
[1:46:59] just do it go ahead and do it do it I
[1:47:01] don't care but one of these days you're
[1:47:03] gonna answer to your creator by the
[1:47:05] books
[1:47:07] can you say amen and I say to you young
[1:47:10] people humble yourself to the word of
[1:47:12] God
[1:47:13] pants humble yourself preachers humble
[1:47:15] yourself every one of us humble
[1:47:17] ourselves to God's headship
[1:47:19] there's blood there
[1:47:22] the only way you can do it though is by
[1:47:24] your nature being divorced died dead
[1:47:26] gone
[1:47:28] your natural desires to cut your hair
[1:47:30] trim your hair
[1:47:33] your natural desires to wear makeup or a
[1:47:36] little Shadow to where nobody can see it
[1:47:43] natural desire is to wear shorts and I'm
[1:47:47] going to tell you boys too and you men
[1:47:50] don't wear shorts
[1:47:52] you're a panty waste you're a sassy when
[1:47:55] you do it and you're putting on women's
[1:47:58] undergarments
[1:48:03] you say well I had one tell me so well I
[1:48:06] wear shorts and I can I'd be in my
[1:48:08] church
[1:48:09] and I love him to death still love him
[1:48:11] we're buddies we're friends we wore
[1:48:14] shorts I told him I said you need to
[1:48:17] quit wearing your shorts
[1:48:19] well this way just stay cool I said
[1:48:21] Brandon said they're a
[1:48:24] so what does it do a week two weeks
[1:48:25] later so look what I found and his
[1:48:27] brother Branham in in shorts in Africa
[1:48:31] does it say
[1:48:33] yeah I said buddy I don't care what that
[1:48:34] picture says I'm telling you what that
[1:48:36] Prophet told us to do
[1:48:38] don't wear shorts I don't know why he
[1:48:41] was that way I don't understand
[1:48:44] but all I know is we don't wear shorts
[1:48:46] and what the prophet said they were
[1:48:48] there were women's undergarments
[1:48:56] he's still wearing his shorts but
[1:49:00] and his children are disarray
[1:49:02] whatever that's okay
[1:49:04] I still love him we're friends
[1:49:07] may God do what he got to do
[1:49:11] but see your natural desires to be
[1:49:13] intellectual
[1:49:15] be a smart man
[1:49:16] whether it's getting behind the pulpit
[1:49:18] and just saying everything just right
[1:49:19] and saying your nice deep words that no
[1:49:21] one can understand except just a few
[1:49:27] to be intellectual
[1:49:29] to know something better
[1:49:31] than the other
[1:49:33] he said that's what Eve wanted that's
[1:49:35] the very thing she wanted that's what
[1:49:37] eve took
[1:49:39] and she was pregnated with that kind of
[1:49:41] pregnation and that's what the church is
[1:49:44] today Bible schools intellectuals
[1:49:47] look everyone disagreeing with the other
[1:49:49] a big mess just exactly what the Bible
[1:49:52] said it's Babylon
[1:49:57] Babylon exists by the first nature
[1:50:00] get out of Babylon you only can do that
[1:50:03] by your nature dying
[1:50:05] got to be dead to that first nature if
[1:50:08] you ain't dead by that first nature that
[1:50:10] first nature ain't did your first
[1:50:11] husband ain't dead you'll stay in
[1:50:13] Babylon even living and setting in a
[1:50:16] message Church
[1:50:20] so your love of the world come by your
[1:50:22] first nature everything you did as a
[1:50:25] sinner comes by your first nature
[1:50:27] now first John 2 and 15 love not the
[1:50:30] world neither the things that are in the
[1:50:32] world any If any man love the world the
[1:50:35] love of the father is not in him
[1:50:37] for all that is in the world the lust of
[1:50:40] the Flesh and the lust of the eyes and
[1:50:41] the pride of life is not of the father
[1:50:44] but is of the world and that is inspired
[1:50:47] of Satan
[1:50:50] ain't that right
[1:50:52] so see how does the world become
[1:50:54] appealing by your first nature
[1:50:56] through your first birth
[1:50:58] the world is appealing
[1:51:01] amen
[1:51:03] yes sir
[1:51:05] now it says the spirit that you have
[1:51:07] come to you by Nature see
[1:51:11] and by Nature coming from sexual
[1:51:13] intercourse desired by man and woman
[1:51:15] produces an Earthly child
[1:51:17] let that child alone and don't teach him
[1:51:20] nothing right you'll go wrong
[1:51:23] don't teach him neither right nor wrong
[1:51:25] he'll go wrong because it's his nature
[1:51:29] to do such
[1:51:30] ain't that right it's the nature That's
[1:51:33] what Satan works on is the first nature
[1:51:37] that first nature can be religious that
[1:51:40] first nature can rule the Bible that
[1:51:42] first nature can go to church and lift
[1:51:43] up hands and worship that first nature
[1:51:46] can do a lot of things but it cannot
[1:51:47] separate from the world
[1:51:51] ain't that right but notice Ephesians 2
[1:51:54] and 4 but God everybody say but God who
[1:51:57] is rich in Mercy
[1:51:59] his ministry is full of Mercy to his
[1:52:02] elect
[1:52:03] his his ministry calls to everyone
[1:52:09] that God knows before the foundation of
[1:52:11] the world that only that elect is going
[1:52:13] to be touched by that Ministry the
[1:52:15] prophet went around the world seven
[1:52:17] times but only to the elect it was
[1:52:19] called for
[1:52:22] God who is rich in Mercy for his great
[1:52:25] love wherewith he loved us
[1:52:27] even when we were dead and sins hath
[1:52:29] quickened us together so then that great
[1:52:32] love wherewith he loved us he must have
[1:52:34] been talking about an elect
[1:52:37] he loved us that he left
[1:52:39] ain't that right for even when we were
[1:52:42] were everybody say were not even while
[1:52:45] we are even when we were past tense sins
[1:52:49] dead in sins half he quickened us
[1:52:52] together in with Christ by Grace you are
[1:52:55] saved and hath raised us up who that
[1:52:58] elect
[1:53:01] raised us up together and made us sit
[1:53:04] together in heaven places in Christ
[1:53:07] brother Brown said see you separated
[1:53:09] from your first Union by spiritual death
[1:53:12] now you are born again or remarried
[1:53:15] again to the new spiritual union of not
[1:53:18] your natural life of the things of the
[1:53:19] world but of eternal life
[1:53:21] that germ that was in you at the
[1:53:23] beginning found you
[1:53:28] found you
[1:53:29] aren't you glad I found you
[1:53:31] hallelujah hallelujah what a wretched
[1:53:34] people we were but it found us
[1:53:36] that germ of life from the foundation of
[1:53:38] the world found us amen no matter how
[1:53:41] deep in sin a person can go if there's a
[1:53:44] germ of life
[1:53:45] you'll find them
[1:53:47] amen don't you worry about your
[1:53:49] incapabilities don't you worry about
[1:53:51] whatever you are if that germ of Life
[1:53:53] can find you that's it
[1:53:57] ain't that right
[1:53:59] so listen now that germ that was in you
[1:54:02] at the beginning found you now your old
[1:54:06] book is gone with your old Union
[1:54:12] amen amen amen you can't be judged by it
[1:54:15] no more
[1:54:17] all your works as a sinner's gone it's
[1:54:20] over it's done
[1:54:21] it's divorce you died with that old
[1:54:23] nature and you're that died with you
[1:54:25] that died everything died your past died
[1:54:28] oh Satan will bring it up
[1:54:35] but that's all he can do
[1:54:38] that's not you no more
[1:54:41] that was what you used to be that was
[1:54:43] the first
[1:54:44] that it was not the wheat
[1:54:46] that was the carrier
[1:54:48] if you want to call it that
[1:54:50] now what you've come into is that which
[1:54:53] was in the beginning in God's mind
[1:54:58] you found you now your old book has gone
[1:55:01] with your old Union and your name in
[1:55:03] your old in your he said has been
[1:55:07] transferred
[1:55:09] your name's not in the Book of Life
[1:55:13] it's been transferred
[1:55:16] hello you say well I thought my name was
[1:55:19] always in the book life it is it has
[1:55:21] been but you're now coming to realize it
[1:55:24] [Music]
[1:55:26] you're now coming to realize it you with
[1:55:28] me
[1:55:29] that's why not all the all scriptures in
[1:55:32] this Bible applies to you
[1:55:35] there's some scriptures that apply to
[1:55:37] the foolish virgin
[1:55:39] there's some scriptures that apply to
[1:55:41] the ungodly the unrighteous
[1:55:45] bet them scriptures that apply to you
[1:55:47] doesn't apply to them
[1:55:50] amen
[1:55:54] your name's been transferred
[1:55:57] you know you're common to the reality of
[1:55:59] what you are to begin with in the
[1:56:01] beginning
[1:56:03] now now you can understand the
[1:56:05] justification you're Justified as though
[1:56:08] you never did it
[1:56:10] you're Justified as though you never did
[1:56:11] remember what program explains the
[1:56:13] justification you heard that I was drunk
[1:56:16] you heard that I was drunk and you come
[1:56:18] up and but he said I really didn't do it
[1:56:20] but you heard I did
[1:56:21] but I didn't
[1:56:23] but you come up to me and you say I
[1:56:25] forgive you brother Adam right and he
[1:56:28] says well forgive me for what I never
[1:56:30] did it
[1:56:31] you were going off of a rumor
[1:56:34] you've given you you've gone off someone
[1:56:36] what someone told you but I'd never did
[1:56:38] it in the first place
[1:56:40] so your past is just a rumor
[1:56:49] you don't want to believe rumors
[1:56:52] especially about your past
[1:56:54] because you're Justified you never did
[1:56:57] it in the first place
[1:57:02] so now your name see has been
[1:57:04] transferred now you say do you mean to
[1:57:06] tell me that my old book
[1:57:09] well see God put it in the sea of his
[1:57:14] forgetfulness
[1:57:19] now a person can justify you my mom
[1:57:22] tries to justify her children
[1:57:27] but we all know how rotten he is
[1:57:30] right
[1:57:35] but there's something about a mama's
[1:57:37] love
[1:57:38] that she's willing to overlook it
[1:57:45] and she may not just understand why
[1:57:47] everybody just don't like that little
[1:57:48] boy
[1:57:51] or that little girl or whatever but we
[1:57:53] know
[1:57:55] they put sugar in in in you know in our
[1:57:57] milk
[1:57:59] they'll do something else you know and
[1:58:01] so we've been bit right
[1:58:03] but mama don't see that
[1:58:06] so even though we see whatever Mama
[1:58:08] can't justify it
[1:58:10] that he can't justify parents can't
[1:58:12] justify but God is the only justifier
[1:58:17] now what what blows my mind and well I
[1:58:19] think is the miracle he's an infinite
[1:58:21] god with an infinite mind
[1:58:24] knowingly in from the beginning
[1:58:27] he knows every time a beef a flea
[1:58:30] that's a sign he knows every time that
[1:58:33] the Bumblebee and every flap that a
[1:58:35] bumblebee makes
[1:58:38] he knows the breath the depth of the
[1:58:40] breath that every animal the flea the
[1:58:42] the bee every bee every flea he knows
[1:58:46] the depth of the breath
[1:58:48] he knows every time the heart is beating
[1:58:50] and how many times and all that he's so
[1:58:52] infinite and yet he puts your sins in
[1:58:56] the sea of forgetfulness that he can't
[1:58:58] even remember
[1:59:04] aren't you glad for the ministry of God
[1:59:07] [Applause]
[1:59:09] he can't remember
[1:59:14] so then he sets himself as our judge
[1:59:18] thank God for that
[1:59:21] while there's blood right
[1:59:24] yeah then he sets himself as our return
[1:59:26] attorney
[1:59:31] so here you're sitting in the courtroom
[1:59:35] and the accuser the Devil he's got his
[1:59:38] fouls
[1:59:39] of your past
[1:59:42] and he's accusing you before God the
[1:59:45] judge
[1:59:47] and yet now God is sitting here being
[1:59:49] our attorney
[1:59:51] fighting for us
[1:59:53] and the judge says but what proof do you
[1:59:56] have he's got all of his proof what
[1:59:58] proof do you have that he never did it
[2:00:01] he's a father I've got my blood to show
[2:00:04] I died for him I've taken their place
[2:00:09] so good is the blood
[2:00:12] that the Father the judge dismisses the
[2:00:15] case
[2:00:16] and the devil is bewildered he's
[2:00:19] dumbfounded
[2:00:21] he thought he had a good case against us
[2:00:24] and found out he has no case
[2:00:29] can you say man
[2:00:31] now you could imagine as we've said
[2:00:33] before
[2:00:35] that if if a man
[2:00:37] if a man becomes let's say the Syria
[2:00:41] serial killer they just can't stop it
[2:00:45] because because of his nature
[2:00:48] and he's he's killed 20 people
[2:00:50] when the in the in the Years spans of
[2:00:53] time
[2:00:54] ain't going to do it again
[2:00:57] it goes to the court you know and
[2:01:00] and maybe he gets him a lawyer that was
[2:01:02] a school buddy the lawyer remembers how
[2:01:04] there's been School Chums and all that
[2:01:06] and
[2:01:08] he tells the judge he says well judge
[2:01:11] he said I know he's bad and I know he's
[2:01:13] guilty and all that but man
[2:01:17] we were good buddies back then he had it
[2:01:19] really going for him and all these
[2:01:20] things I don't know what's happened but
[2:01:22] but but
[2:01:24] uh uh you know I I really like him as a
[2:01:27] friend
[2:01:28] he's a judge how about I take his place
[2:01:31] I'll go to death for him
[2:01:34] and what if the judge says okay
[2:01:36] all right if you're willing to do that
[2:01:37] take his take his place then you go
[2:01:39] right ahead
[2:01:41] well Billy Bob goes free
[2:01:43] but the problem is is it didn't help
[2:01:46] Billy Bob at all
[2:01:47] he's still a serial killer he's still
[2:01:49] got the nature he's gonna do it again
[2:01:51] and one of these days he's gonna run out
[2:01:53] of friends
[2:01:55] ain't that right
[2:01:57] amen so it might as well just been Billy
[2:01:59] Bob uh uh you know because the lawyer
[2:02:01] died in vain
[2:02:03] but here was our judge and our or our
[2:02:05] lawyer he's i'll take his place father
[2:02:08] but there was a plan for this
[2:02:10] he couldn't he he couldn't help us if he
[2:02:13] didn't take our place but he died to
[2:02:16] take our place to help us
[2:02:18] that he could put his spirit
[2:02:23] in US
[2:02:26] now what if that lawyer could live in
[2:02:28] Billy Bob say I'll die but I'll come
[2:02:30] back in Billy Bob
[2:02:32] then what happens then Billy Bob is no
[2:02:34] longer a serial killer he becomes the
[2:02:36] lawyer
[2:02:37] he becomes dressed up as a decent
[2:02:39] citizen
[2:02:40] why because there's something else
[2:02:42] that's in him
[2:02:45] ain't that right and we're only sons of
[2:02:47] God by the spirit of God living inside
[2:02:51] of us
[2:02:53] no longer are we Sinners we're
[2:02:55] Christians
[2:02:57] no longer are we unbelievers we're
[2:02:58] believers
[2:03:00] because God's believing through us God
[2:03:02] living through us God having preeminence
[2:03:05] in US
[2:03:08] you love the Lord the wonderful
[2:03:11] so it says now see God put it in the sea
[2:03:15] of forgetfulness you stand perfectly
[2:03:17] before God now your name is now in the
[2:03:21] new book not the book of life but the
[2:03:23] Lamb's Book of Life what the lamb
[2:03:25] redeemed not the old book of your
[2:03:27] natural Union but your new bride your
[2:03:30] new life is in the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:03:33] your marriage certificate Hallelujah
[2:03:35] where your true Eternal germ from the
[2:03:38] beginning takes hold
[2:03:41] you're not now you're not only forgiven
[2:03:43] but you're Justified ain't that right so
[2:03:47] we just all got we got through all of
[2:03:49] that see so he said see the word
[2:03:51] Justified is as though you never did it
[2:03:53] it's not even regarded at all how is it
[2:03:57] done in the God's book of the sea of
[2:04:00] forgiveness your old book and marriage
[2:04:03] is divorced and dead it's not even in
[2:04:06] the memories of God
[2:04:09] don't try to remind God something he
[2:04:12] can't even remember
[2:04:15] if the musicians will come
[2:04:19] you're Justified therefore being
[2:04:21] justified see it was accused you was
[2:04:23] accused
[2:04:26] but you've never done it in the first
[2:04:28] place the old Union is in the sea of
[2:04:30] God's forgetfulness you wasn't married
[2:04:31] to it to begin with
[2:04:34] see he the bridegroom bore your shame
[2:04:36] himself for you and your place he took
[2:04:38] your place for you were predestinated
[2:04:40] for him to be in his bride before the
[2:04:43] foundation of the world the Bible said
[2:04:45] so you are the predestinated seed
[2:04:49] how did you come to do this you were
[2:04:52] deceived into it by your first marriage
[2:04:54] to your adulterous parent Eve it's no
[2:04:57] fault of your own by your natural birth
[2:04:59] you come after Eve who committed
[2:05:01] adultery that's the reason you was born
[2:05:03] in an adulteress say you're a sinner to
[2:05:06] begin with you was deceived into it no
[2:05:09] it ain't your fault you never did it
[2:05:11] because that little germ that was in you
[2:05:13] was to be you before the foundation of
[2:05:16] the world and God put your name
[2:05:20] in the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:05:23] so hope you understand the purpose of
[2:05:25] God's Ministry I am come
[2:05:28] that you may have life
[2:05:30] and have it more abundantly
[2:05:33] people's got this perverted idea that
[2:05:35] this is life
[2:05:37] having money is life having the wealth
[2:05:39] is life
[2:05:41] having all the riches and Comforts of
[2:05:43] world is life
[2:05:45] no that ain't the life
[2:05:48] it was everything you do as a sinner is
[2:05:51] going to be judged
[2:05:54] but he come that you may have life not
[2:05:56] to destroy you
[2:05:59] but to give you life
[2:06:01] that you may live before him
[2:06:04] as what he called you to be
[2:06:07] before the foundation of the world
[2:06:09] brother Brown said Christ died to save
[2:06:12] those who God by foreknowledge elected
[2:06:14] to meet him Yonder without spot or
[2:06:16] wrinkle before the foundation of the
[2:06:18] world he's seen you in glory
[2:06:20] that's what the Bible said Ephesians the
[2:06:22] first chapter Fifth Fifth chapter first
[2:06:25] verse God predestinated by foreknowledge
[2:06:27] if God did that predestinated us before
[2:06:29] the foundation world and knew every one
[2:06:31] of us by name before the foundation of
[2:06:33] the world and he elected us to eternal
[2:06:34] life and sent Jesus Christ to redeem us
[2:06:38] that 6 000 years ago he saw us that we
[2:06:41] might appear to his Praises in glory how
[2:06:44] can you ever be lost
[2:06:48] now if you're saved you're saved ain't
[2:06:51] that right if you're saved you're saved
[2:06:55] [Music]
[2:06:59] if God Saves you tonight knowing he's
[2:07:00] going to lose you in 10 years from today
[2:07:02] he's defeating his own purpose the
[2:07:04] infinite Almighty Eternal Everlasting
[2:07:06] wisdom God doesn't know enough to know
[2:07:08] then to know whether you'll hold out or
[2:07:11] whether you won't
[2:07:12] then when he saves you you say well I'll
[2:07:14] give him a try we'll see what he I'll
[2:07:17] see what he'll do
[2:07:19] then he doesn't know the end from the
[2:07:21] beginning
[2:07:22] God knows what he's doing
[2:07:25] don't you never worry about that
[2:07:30] I don't care how low you've been God
[2:07:32] knows what he's doing
[2:07:36] don't you ever worry about that
[2:07:40] [Music]
[2:07:44] see it's you and I
[2:07:46] stumbling alone
[2:07:48] but God knows what he's doing
[2:07:50] and he knew whether we had hold out or
[2:07:52] what we would do
[2:07:54] then you say Amen you love him
[2:07:57] I got one more to read to you I know I
[2:08:00] got a lot more to go but he says the
[2:08:01] spiritual man today the spiritual woman
[2:08:03] that's elected predestinated of God come
[2:08:05] to eternal life
[2:08:08] if they have to sell everything they've
[2:08:10] got if they have to take their name off
[2:08:12] of every Church book in the nation they
[2:08:14] still want that Birthright it's the only
[2:08:16] thing that matters to them just get that
[2:08:18] birth right that's all no matter how and
[2:08:20] what level they have to come on if they
[2:08:23] have to get down at the altar and cry
[2:08:25] boohoo if they have to run through the
[2:08:27] places and go back and make things right
[2:08:28] and sell what they got or give away
[2:08:31] everything they have and become a
[2:08:32] pilgrim and a stranger it doesn't matter
[2:08:34] they want the birthright that's a that's
[2:08:38] all they're interested in is the
[2:08:39] birthright
[2:08:41] and notice what brother Brown says now
[2:08:43] don't blame them people
[2:08:45] they can't help it they were
[2:08:47] predestinated to that elected to it can
[2:08:51] you say amen and we're willing to be
[2:08:53] called fools for Christ aren't we
[2:08:56] we're willing to do it all for Christ

[2:19:21] they must be rewarded too it must be a
[2:19:24] reward for them to see the redeemed
[2:19:27] there
[2:19:28] because they were given charge over us
[2:19:31] they were given charge to help our faith
[2:19:34] to help us to believe
[2:19:37] to help us through our hard times
[2:19:39] the angels of the lord always watching
[2:19:41] us and then when we enter in
[2:19:44] it must be something for them to look
[2:19:47] and say ah
[2:19:48] they made it
[2:19:51] they all have to bow their heads because
[2:19:53] they don't know what we're singing about
[2:19:55] but oh what a day it's going to be
[2:19:58] and all the work is over and it actually
[2:20:01] shuts the Angels up
[2:20:04] that we have the chance to sing praises
