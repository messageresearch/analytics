[1:10:59] now someone has said significantly now
[1:11:02] listen to this if a message is very
[1:11:05] important you are likely to try and
[1:11:08] express your message through words and
[1:11:11] person so if you got a if you had a real
[1:11:15] message to give somebody and it was
[1:11:16] really important well you wouldn't TR
[1:11:18] trust any Tom Dicker Harley with it you
[1:11:20] know because you know they made BS the
[1:11:23] whole thing up on you but praise God
[1:11:25] when it's a real important message
[1:11:27] somebody important is going to come and
[1:11:29] bring it Hallelujah and and you know and
[1:11:32] and and in the in the the grand scheme
[1:11:34] of things Christ came and he brought the
[1:11:36] message Hallelujah and why he was there
[1:11:39] and and and and what we we see that God
[1:11:42] wanted to do Express himself in the
[1:11:44] person of Jesus Christ wonderful
[1:11:47] hallelujah amen the logos the logos I
[1:11:51] love to brother Sean I love to toy with
[1:11:53] like that there and one thing I know
[1:11:55] about the godhead you will never nobody
[1:11:58] in this whole earth could split Jesus
[1:11:59] from being Christ you can't say well
[1:12:01] he's Jesus but he's not Christ no you
[1:12:03] can't say he's Christ but he's not Jesus
[1:12:05] impossible just impossible amen and and
[1:12:07] I was looking at it and and you know it
[1:12:09] says in John 1 it says in the beginning
[1:12:11] was the word the logos of God hallelujah
[1:12:14] the very thought the very concept of God
[1:12:16] here and and then I said then the that
[1:12:19] that thought that concept became flesh
[1:12:21] and dwelt Among Us and you come cannot
[1:12:24] separate that from what Paul said in
[1:12:26] Philippians 2 where he said amen he was
[1:12:28] in the form of God Amen am moried
[1:12:31] Hallelujah H in the form of God and he
[1:12:34] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:12:36] God and he said he said if you don't
[1:12:39] believe that I am he you will die in
[1:12:41] your sins absolutely true Hallelujah and
[1:12:44] so thank God he he brought the message
[1:12:46] himself when when nothing else could do
[1:12:49] amen Jesus brought salvation to us he
[1:12:52] came as a human being
[1:12:53] hallelujah what a wonderful thing praise
[1:12:56] God it's bur to get you excited amen I
[1:12:59] love it I just love it amen and
[1:13:01] Hallelujah wonderful and and you know I

[1:13:11] was wonderful time to be up there uh
[1:13:13] they were in the Old Log church first
[1:13:16] and then they went into their new place
[1:13:18] amen up there in Cloverdale but uh amen
[1:13:21] he said at at the camp me
[1:13:23] he said we have tapped into the mind of
[1:13:26] God well cuz that's where we were amen
[1:13:28] you know you talk about John Calvin and
[1:13:30] what he would have know and I'm sure he
[1:13:31] knew it a lot but I'll tell you what he
[1:13:34] could he knew predestination in the
[1:13:36] Bible but he couldn't have explained it
[1:13:37] the way we could tonight because the
[1:13:39] only way you can explain it is that we
[1:13:41] were in the mind of God Amen and that
[1:13:44] his mind is eternal so we had to be
[1:13:46] manifested at some point in our life and
[1:13:49] and you know not not as tell say tomor
[1:13:51] we just fellowship and and you know you
[1:13:53] think about about all the denominations
[1:13:56] tonight who would teach that when you
[1:13:58] were born you were a Son of God yeah you
[1:14:01] didn't become a Son of God sooner or
[1:14:03] later oh I accepted Jesus I'm a Son of
[1:14:04] God I you were a Son of God the only
[1:14:06] thing is you didn't know it you're a
[1:14:08] little sinner you would steal under the
[1:14:10] cookie jar and all that you tell the odd
[1:14:12] lie make the odd curse where word my
[1:14:14] mama said I was terrible you know yeah
[1:14:16] really you know oh boy Mark you know so
[1:14:19] I was I was no Insel you know but but oh
[1:14:22] my I tell you what but I didn't know
[1:14:24] even I can remember as a child that I'd
[1:14:27] be there you know we'd be maybe playing
[1:14:29] we we would call it soccer football
[1:14:31] soccer on the ground and we'd be playing
[1:14:32] as children playing and I'd feel
[1:14:34] something and I'd think what was that
[1:14:36] you know and then I I go back to playing
[1:14:38] again and brother Bram tells me he said
[1:14:40] that was the angels with you I was
[1:14:42] watching over you Hallelujah do you

[1:14:49] children is he we're not handing them
[1:14:50] over to him praise God you know praise
[1:14:53] God and all this this sick society that
[1:14:55] we live in amen where oh I I think in
[1:14:58] Donnie goers somebody thinks they're a
[1:15:00] cat some kid thinks they're a cat but
[1:15:02] you're not a cat hallelujah amen you're
[1:15:04] a human being I think you're a human
[1:15:06] being anyway okay so you know it's
[1:15:09] wonderful and we've tapped into the mind
[1:15:10] of God we know where we came from and
[1:15:13] and that and I I preached the message
[1:15:14] back home where where we talked about uh
[1:15:17] uh uh that proving that our names are in
[1:15:20] the Lamb's Book of Life and and when we
[1:15:22] go read fact that way it proves it
[1:15:24] Hallelujah we've done everything it says
[1:15:26] in Romans chapter 8 Hallelujah and now
[1:15:28] the sons of God led by the spirit of God
[1:15:30] we know who we are praise God so yes

[1:24:34] to me and with me always he's been to
[1:24:36] Ireland but he's my go-to man you know
[1:24:38] and so Joe comes down one night I jumped
[1:24:40] into the van or the the truck and uh he

[1:26:58] cannot touch America because you're here
[1:27:01] hallelujah he's the one that's holding
[1:27:03] all things together and will hold it
[1:27:04] until the bride is lifted up in the
[1:27:07] Rapture amen praise God and so we're
[1:27:10] moving that little higher we're looking
[1:27:11] for the coming of the Lord that's what
[1:27:13] we're looking for that's the Corporal
[1:27:14] coming you understand what I mean
[1:27:16] Hallelujah because the son of man's
[1:27:17] descended to this bride and revealed
[1:27:19] himself to it he did it up in the he
[1:27:21] reveals himself in the the heavens I was
[1:27:23] talking to Sean that lovely photograph
[1:27:25] that cloud photograph my I'll tell you
[1:27:28] what I'd never give that over to anybody
[1:27:29] that's a a Critic of this message that
[1:27:31] is the bride property Hallelujah that is
[1:27:34] the son of man there over Flagstaff or
[1:27:37] wherever it was amen how many miles high
[1:27:40] 26 or something Miles High whatever it
[1:27:41] was but I'll tell you what it was a it
[1:27:44] was a supernatural photograph amen and
[1:27:46] that's our property and there's this
[1:27:48] blessed face in it amen the son of man
[1:27:50] looking down praise God uh toward us
[1:27:53] hallelujah wonderful and wanting to
[1:27:55] bring us to that time when uh he'll come
[1:27:59] again and if he came one time in the
[1:28:01] fullness of time he'll come the second
[1:28:03] time he said I will come again and
[1:28:05] receive you now I preach the message and
[1:28:08] I'm sure maybe the folks could remember
[1:28:10] it or not it don't matter but it was
[1:28:11] scripture cannot be broken Jesus said
[1:28:14] that himself you cannot break the
[1:28:17] scripture so that means what he says he
[1:28:20] means and you can't ask to it take away
[1:28:23] from It or Break It am man it's
[1:28:25] unbreakable hallelujah praise God
[1:28:27] hallelujah and so scripture cannot be
[1:28:30] broken that's why they could not you
[1:28:32] know here's this Roman soldier really
[1:28:34] going to break his legs could you
[1:28:36] imagine that just a couple of seconds
[1:28:38] off breaking his legs but that Soldier
[1:28:41] didn't know that there's angels all
[1:28:43] around Hallelujah and he could not lay a
[1:28:46] finger on our savior Hallelujah because
[1:28:49] scripture said not a bone in his body
[1:28:52] would be broken scripture cannot be
[1:28:54] broken folks no matter how people try to
[1:28:56] uh uh you know they tried to draw Moses
[1:28:58] or what about whatever not but you
[1:29:00] cannot destroy what God's got done and
[1:29:03] planned hallelujah amen it's impossible
[1:29:06] so it brings us higher amen the church
[1:29:08] uh progressing higher amen since the
[1:29:12] days of Wesley I I I I got the pleasure
[1:29:14] of of going over to London one time and
[1:29:16] and I went into the church where Wesley
[1:29:18] was and we got shown all around it as a
[1:29:20] matter of fact even took his little hat
[1:29:22] that he wore and I had it was looking at
[1:29:24] it like that and she said oh don't touch
[1:29:26] that don't touch that that was his real
[1:29:27] heart that was that John wesle I had
[1:29:30] hand you know praise God and I remember
[1:29:33] one time meeting Sarah branam and and
[1:29:35] she had that that Bible of
[1:29:38] 1947 that that the angel of God quoted
[1:29:40] from when he was talking to brother Bram
[1:29:43] it's wonderful but you know it's
[1:29:44] wonderful things but it's not going to
[1:29:46] do make you any more higher or any more
[1:29:49] holy or any it's just you can see it
[1:29:51] it's just you say Amen amen and so we
[1:29:53] were at his place and it was it was
[1:29:54] wonderful uh to see it all and where
[1:29:56] he's buried I even asked him was he
[1:29:58] ounded and she said nope you know and I
[1:30:00] said was where was Charles buried and
[1:30:02] said oh Charles was very churchy he was
[1:30:04] buried up in the Anglican Church up the
[1:30:06] road you know consecrated ground well
[1:30:09] Paul wasn't buried and consecrated time
[1:30:11] but he said there's a Crown of Life
[1:30:14] witing me Hallelujah and and and he said
[1:30:17] to all who love the Lord's appearing oh
[1:30:19] isn't it wonderful Hallelujah the word
[1:30:21] of God cannot be broken folks it'll all
[1:30:23] be fulfilled every last lick of it amen
[1:30:26] hallelujah amen and so amen we're
[1:30:29] progressing higher much higher than
[1:30:31] Wesley because they were trinitarians
[1:30:33] and it had to be that way that was the
[1:30:34] darkness but that the Supreme deity what
[1:30:37] John saw amen that Supreme deity was
[1:30:41] going to be revealed in our day
[1:30:42] hallelujah amen and to take us where
[1:30:44] we're going and there he sat on the
[1:30:46] throne and worshiped Hallelujah on the
[1:30:48] throne and I've talked to many people
[1:30:50] and said if you can show me any more
[1:30:53] than one on the throne at any time in
[1:30:54] the Bible I'd love to hear the first in
[1:30:56] the chapter amen because it ain't there
[1:30:59] amen there's always one on the throne
[1:31:02] amen always one Hallelujah and so praise
[1:31:04] God and here he comes he says amen we
[1:31:07] moved up and through uh through
[1:31:09] restoration and the gifts and right up
[1:31:11] now we're coming to the Capstone the
[1:31:13] church has got to to be the come to the
[1:31:16] stature of a perfect man amen actually

[1:55:00] distinction which Israel failed to
[1:55:03] achieve by works of being a a priesthood
[1:55:05] of Believers is therefore a Birthright
[1:55:08] just as every descendant of Aaron was
[1:55:10] born to the priesthood the chief
[1:55:13] privilege of a priest now you're Kings
[1:55:15] and Priests what is the chief privilege
[1:55:18] that you've got tonight that you can

[1:56:15] happens and you hear a voice saying thy
[1:56:18] prayer is heard
