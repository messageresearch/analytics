[19:19] amen we're certainly praying the Lord
[19:21] would share something that he would

[19:27] wonder if we could just bow our hearts
[19:28] this evening in a word of Prayer
[19:31] gracious Lord
[19:33] we are thankful that you would give us
[19:35] the grace to Stand Here Again
[19:38] Lord the year has just changed and Lord
[19:42] we're reminded of another year waiting
[19:45] Lord looking for that imminent return
[19:48] that Lord when we'd be caught a way to
[19:50] meet with you
[19:51] now Lord Jesus this is on our mind
[19:54] it's on our hearts Lord It's
[19:57] it's season Lord and as they sang the
[20:01] song All I Got lately he's leaving on my
[20:05] mind
[20:06] I think about it Lord I think what it's
[20:08] going to be when the when the elements
[20:10] of my body go to changing and and Lord
[20:13] we just get to walk from one realm to
[20:16] another and Lord it's the it's the
[20:18] center of my life it's the focus of my
[20:21] heart
[20:22] and Lord we're willing to lay aside
[20:25] anything that we could be a part of that
[20:27] and achieve it Lord
[20:29] and we're asking you tonight father that
[20:32] you just come and you'd speak to us Lord
[20:34] you would deal with our hearts
[20:36] Lord you would lead us in the word Lord
[20:38] that you would open things that you
[20:40] would desire us to know and we're asking
[20:42] that you would bless this congregation
[20:44] that would take their evening and gather
[20:46] together Lord and give us an opportunity
[20:49] to speak with him I pray you bless them
[20:51] Lord just send your Angels Among Us and
[20:54] Lord is Apostle Paul said give us the
[20:56] spirit of wisdom and Revelation tonight
[20:58] father now we ask it in the mighty name
[21:01] of Jesus Christ we pray
[21:03] amen and amen and God bless you amen
[21:07] we'd like to go back to the scripture if
[21:09] we can to the first Thessalonians
[21:11] chapter 4 we'll be looking in the 16th
[21:15] and the 17th verse
[21:18] first Thessalonians 4.
[21:23] 16 and 17.
[21:34] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[21:37] heaven
[21:39] with a shout with the voice of the
[21:42] archangel
[21:43] and with the Trump of God
[21:45] and the dead in Christ shall rise first
[21:50] then we which are alive and remain
[21:53] shall be caught up together with them in
[21:55] the clouds
[21:57] to meet the Lord in the air
[22:00] and so shall we ever be with the Lord
[22:04] we ask the Lord to bless his word
[22:05] tonight as you can be seated I want to
[22:08] take a
[22:09] uh an extension of this I'm going to be
[22:11] in if the Lord Keeps Us in this path
[22:14] we'll be here for services on this
[22:16] particular subject but tonight we're
[22:19] going to take a second part and as we
[22:21] left you last night at the pyramid I
[22:24] want to talk to you again
[22:26] about Enoch but tonight I want to talk
[22:29] about Enoch's walk and then our walk of
[22:32] Grace our walk of Grace
[22:34] of course if we're if we're looking at
[22:38] this subject
[22:39] and we say that we're speaking on a
[22:41] Rapture well there's a lot of different
[22:44] definitions of what you would say if you
[22:46] say the Rapture there's a lot of ideas
[22:48] about that but so there's has to be
[22:52] exactly a defining or a definition do
[22:55] you get it from uh which dictionary from
[22:58] which person from which assembly who who
[23:00] has the definition of that but I believe
[23:03] that it was given to a seventh angel
[23:05] prophet and I believe that messenger was
[23:07] able to give us this word and brother
[23:10] Bradham actually tells us that the word
[23:12] rapture is not in the Bible he said but
[23:14] it's it's to be caught up so we're using
[23:17] the word rapture in the place of being
[23:19] saying caught up and brother Madam uses
[23:22] this word and he says instead of saying
[23:24] they shall be caught up he said they
[23:26] shall be raptured which Rapture is
[23:28] including both the resurrection of the
[23:30] Dead
[23:31] and the change of their body to
[23:33] immortality and then it's the living
[23:35] that has changed so Rapture is inclusive
[23:37] of both resurrection and uh an Ascension
[23:40] or a body change uh so we we realize
[23:43] that Rapture uh actually the the
[23:45] definition of the root word rapture
[23:48] actually is derived from a French word
[23:50] rapture and it's actually from a
[23:53] medieval Latin Rapture which is Latin is
[23:55] the base of most languages uh but it
[23:58] actually means a seizure or a kidnapping
[24:01] and I I specifically like that myself
[24:03] because it makes it seem a little more
[24:05] like what the prophet was trying to tell
[24:07] us is that God was coming back for his
[24:10] children it wasn't so much that you're
[24:12] running God down trying to be a part but
[24:15] that God sent something to get a hold of
[24:17] you to make you a part amen is not that
[24:20] you're able to make yourself but it's
[24:22] that God has sent something that has has
[24:25] drawn you uh that is basically could I
[24:28] say it like this an irresistible forces
[24:30] came after you amen and snatched you and
[24:33] and actually uh in the unveiling of God
[24:36] brother Brahman says that some are
[24:37] already I'll leave one take one he
[24:39] brings that to the son of man Ministry
[24:41] and shows that some are already taken by
[24:44] the message it it took you it took one
[24:46] left one took another left one amen
[24:49] showing that this is an individual
[24:51] relationship now the Rapture of course
[24:54] what we're talking about the Rapture the
[24:56] bride the Rapture is a revelation to her
[24:59] and it is revealed to her and the
[25:01] revelation of the true bride of Christ
[25:03] will be waiting for the revelation of
[25:05] the Rapture and now this Revelation for
[25:07] the for the Revelation is Faith and you
[25:11] cannot have a revelation without it
[25:13] being Faith so we say to you Faith uh
[25:15] the rapturing faith it's we're speaking
[25:17] about Rapture revelation
[25:19] Faith cometh by the hearing of the word
[25:23] of God the word comes to a prophet faith
[25:28] and Revelation is speaking of rapture is
[25:32] brought by a prophet now of course the
[25:34] prophet tells us this he says of course
[25:36] the third pool of his ministry he says
[25:40] there's no higher order to reveal the
[25:42] word than a prophet so somebody says
[25:44] well brother Wayne why do you why do you
[25:46] think that God would send the prophet in
[25:48] this dispensation the Bible said God
[25:49] will do nothing until he sends a prophet
[25:52] do you really think the great event of
[25:55] the Rapture would happen and God not
[25:57] send a prophet amen it takes a prophet
[26:00] to bring change to a generation nothing
[26:02] changes until the word is spoken and
[26:05] then that's where change begins amen now
[26:07] there's there's no higher order reveal
[26:09] the word of the Prophet so a prophet is
[26:11] spoken now the Rapture he says that
[26:13] we're talking about is only for the
[26:16] bride
[26:17] there's a lot of people there's a lot of
[26:19] classes of people but what we're talking
[26:21] about is for the bride there are
[26:23] actually three different Witnesses in
[26:25] the Old Testament of rapture we're
[26:27] talking about Enoch Elijah and Jesus now
[26:31] for our types of what we're talking
[26:33] about last night and tonight is we're
[26:35] going to speak about Enoch and the
[26:37] scripture says that Enoch walked with
[26:40] God and was not amen and for God took
[26:44] him I think that's a powerful thing God
[26:46] took him amen amen uh you know they got
[26:49] these new things and they talk about
[26:50] people doing things and they say don't
[26:52] be like uh don't be like this guy or be
[26:54] like this guy you know and I want to be
[26:56] like Enoch you know he walked with God
[26:58] God took him be like Enoch you know walk
[27:02] with God and let God take you amen God
[27:04] took him now in Hebrews 11 the Bible
[27:07] said by faith Enoch was translated that
[27:11] he should not see death and was not
[27:13] found because God had translated him and
[27:17] before his translation he had this
[27:19] testimony that he had pleased God
[27:23] without faith it is impossible to please
[27:25] him again Faith Revelation Faith
[27:28] Revelation is the rapture comes from
[27:31] Faith or Revelation and the Bible says
[27:34] that Enoch had it before he changed
[27:36] bodies Enoch had it before he left the
[27:39] Earth he had it and he built it in a
[27:41] pyramid I don't know how long the
[27:42] pyramid took to build but whatever it
[27:45] took he already had the Revelation and
[27:47] put it in the pyramid before he was
[27:49] changed so it was a it was not something
[27:51] that he caught just before he walked off
[27:54] the Earth it was something that he
[27:55] carried with him so you can actually
[27:58] possess the Rapture Revelation and still
[28:01] remain on the earth for a season of time
[28:04] is that right come on church amen that's
[28:07] exactly right you said preacher what are
[28:09] you trying to get at I'm trying to say
[28:11] that you're in possession tonight of the
[28:14] very Revelation that will change the
[28:16] body of the church amen we are in the
[28:19] Revelation rapturing season that's where
[28:21] we're standing tonight it was the
[28:22] prophet of God said of course the Bible
[28:24] said faith is our Victory is that right
[28:26] and the Bible says that this Death Shall
[28:29] be swallowed up in what in Victory that
[28:32] our faith will swallow up this death
[28:34] amen and then shall it come to pass the
[28:37] Saints for death is swallowed into
[28:39] Victory it's going to the the Revelation
[28:41] is going to swallow the church amen
[28:44] y'all know what I'm talking about God
[28:45] always gives a revelation then you
[28:47] possess it Noah's seen it 120 years and
[28:50] then possessed it amen Enoch how long
[28:52] did he see it before he saw it far
[28:54] enough ahead of time that he built it in
[28:56] a pyramid and then Vindicated his
[28:59] Revelation by changing his body and left
[29:02] a Vindicated Memorial upon the Earth
[29:04] that we're still talking about 4 000
[29:07] years later powerful to me that he had
[29:09] this Revelation before his translation
[29:12] now this is speaking of the church amen
[29:16] having the Revelation before amen seven
[29:19] Church age is what takes the Rapture one
[29:21] and four teen says Enoch with seventh
[29:24] from Adam was prophesied saying Enoch
[29:26] preached saying the Lord cometh with ten
[29:29] thousands of his Saints amen of course
[29:31] he not being our type he preached the
[29:34] message of rapture and was scoffed at
[29:36] the same as we're scoffed at today he
[29:39] was scoffed out back then he preached
[29:42] the revelation of the Rapture they
[29:43] denied it and went into Judgment of the
[29:45] antiluvian flood
[29:48] amen if you turn down the message of
[29:51] change and Rapture only judgment is
[29:54] there because it was the Escape before
[29:56] the Judgment amen God showing in Enoch
[29:59] that he was building a way not an ark
[30:03] like Noah but he was building a way to
[30:05] get us off of the earth before the
[30:08] judgments fail God was able to do it if
[30:10] he wanted to show it in a type how could
[30:13] he do it how could he how could he get
[30:15] Enoch off of the earth without death as
[30:18] it typed to us he made a translation for
[30:20] him God made a Rapture for him and God
[30:23] had to do it in order to make a type out
[30:25] of Enoch of course Enoch his whole body
[30:28] was transformed that he might be able
[30:31] Amen to be a type can you imagine he
[30:34] changed his body to be a type if God
[30:37] could change a body in a type what could
[30:40] God do in the reality of that type amen
[30:44] when the type is being fulfilled I
[30:46] believe God tonight has got a People in
[30:48] mind
[30:49] that we'll be changing their body the
[30:51] prophet of God tells us of course that
[30:53] he not built amen the the pyramid which
[30:56] was the second Bible and he said what
[30:58] Enoch done here he said well it's taking
[31:01] place it's the gospel coming to the
[31:04] church it's like the gospel coming see
[31:07] it starts wide at the bottom and it
[31:11] represents the early days of reformation
[31:12] and you could call yourself a Christian
[31:15] and maybe it was Catholic it would get
[31:17] you killed just to say that you were a
[31:19] Christian but then they preached
[31:20] justification and then long come Wesley
[31:22] and then come along the church see it's
[31:24] a minority coming down to minority can
[31:27] we bring up that pyramid picture again
[31:29] Enoch's pyramid we look at it one more
[31:32] time amen we was on it last night we'll
[31:34] look at it one more time there is
[31:36] Enoch's pyramid we're not going inside
[31:37] his Pyramid tonight but there's his
[31:39] pyramid and the pyramid never had the
[31:42] Capstone put upon it right amen him
[31:45] showing amen that it didn't have the
[31:47] Capstone in that age but the cat Stone
[31:50] would be coming whenever that William
[31:52] Branham draws us a pyramid he brings us
[31:55] the Pyramid of the Statue of the perfect
[31:57] man the next one when brother Branham
[31:59] brings it to us he puts the Capstone on
[32:01] the pyramid and he's preaching to us
[32:04] that this is the ending of the age see
[32:07] he said if you're in the Zodiac you're
[32:09] in the last of the of the consolations
[32:11] he said if you're looking at the pyramid
[32:14] you're at the Capstone if you're looking
[32:16] at the written bible you're in the Book
[32:18] of Revelation so whichever Bible you're
[32:20] looking at we are at the end and it is
[32:23] time for the rapturing of the church
[32:26] amen this is a picture of course of the
[32:28] Statue of the perfect man which you find
[32:31] in First Peter chapter one amen if
[32:34] you're if you're if you're looking in
[32:36] that First Peter chapter one amen it's a
[32:38] promise of divine nature given to the
[32:40] church it's a it's a mountain or a
[32:42] possession the church's promise divine
[32:44] nature and and and and from the faith of
[32:47] God giving you a birth he adds to that
[32:50] Faith knowledge and and I guess we got
[32:52] him right here don't we we add their
[32:54] faith and knowledge and Temperance and
[32:55] patience and godliness and brotherly
[32:57] kindness now you can look at all them
[32:59] and those are the attributes amen that
[33:02] come up through the ages of the seven
[33:03] colors of the rainbow amen but when you
[33:06] come to the top one amen the Capstone is
[33:09] love right the catstone is love and and
[33:12] the Bible said amen that God would add
[33:14] love how many realizes that there's not
[33:16] another virtue in this pyramid where God
[33:19] said he is he never said I am knowledge
[33:22] or I am virtue or I am Faith he bet God
[33:25] said I am love amen amen that the
[33:28] pyramid is capped by the spirit of God
[33:30] God that that Revelation Amen in this
[33:33] age is a powerful understanding that the
[33:36] Lord himself as a spirit will cap the
[33:40] Pyramid of the church is that right he
[33:42] will cap it off himself he will weld the
[33:45] whole thing together he he'll make a one
[33:47] unit out of it isn't it powerful that
[33:50] the Capstone is in the shape of the
[33:52] entire pyramid so the whole pyramid is
[33:54] him on that one Capstone amen when you
[33:57] get the cat Stone you got everything you
[33:59] need when you get the Capstone it's a
[34:01] finished work amen the prophet of God
[34:03] said the seven seals seals off the New
[34:06] Testament is that right it seals off the
[34:09] New Testament the word coming to the
[34:11] church now in First Peter chapter one
[34:13] when Peter builds you up he'll build you
[34:15] all the way up to love and the minute he
[34:17] gets to love the next verse in the 11th
[34:20] verse says for so an entrance shall be
[34:22] ministered unto you abundantly into the
[34:25] king to Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord
[34:28] and Savior Jesus Christ we wherefore I
[34:31] will not be negligent to put you always
[34:33] in remembrance of these things though
[34:35] you know them and be established in
[34:37] present truth yeah I think at me as long
[34:40] as I am in this Tabernacle to stir you
[34:42] up by putting you in remembrance and
[34:44] knowing shortly I must put off of this
[34:46] Tabernacle even as the Lord Jesus has
[34:48] showed me now Look at the power of this
[34:50] for an entrance shall be ministered unto
[34:53] you abundantly isn't it amazing that at
[34:56] the Capstone age amen When Love sets
[34:59] upon the church amen there's a prophecy
[35:02] of an entrance being ministered to the
[35:04] church amen there's a door open in other
[35:07] words the heavens opened at this time if
[35:10] you're reading also look in second Peter
[35:13] 1 and verse 16 Peter says it like this
[35:15] we have not followed cunning divised
[35:18] fables we have made known unto you by
[35:20] the power and the coming of our Lord
[35:21] Jesus Christ by eyewitnesses of his
[35:24] majesty for we have received from God
[35:26] the Father honor and Glory when there
[35:29] came such a voice from heaven from from
[35:32] the excellent Glory saying this is my
[35:34] beloved Son and whom I'm well pleased
[35:37] and this voice which came from heaven we
[35:39] heard and when we were with him in the
[35:41] Holy Mount now look this man was with
[35:43] Jesus in Matthew 17 on Mount
[35:47] Transfiguration and he's giving you his
[35:49] account Matthew wrote it in one account
[35:51] he's writing it here in his account and
[35:54] he said we have heard a more sure word
[35:57] of Prophecy we're until you do well to
[35:59] take heed as a light that's shineth in a
[36:02] dark place until the day dawn of the day
[36:04] star arise in your heart knowing this
[36:07] verse that no prophecy is of the
[36:10] scripture is of any private
[36:12] interpretation so what he's prophesying
[36:15] is as as it was there on the holy
[36:18] mountain when Jesus went up on my
[36:20] Transfiguration what they saw was a
[36:22] glorified Jesus they saw a cloud come
[36:25] down on the mountain is that right it
[36:27] was not a thundercloud they saw it was a
[36:30] theophonic cloud That Came Upon that
[36:32] mountain and out of that mountain come a
[36:35] voice is that right amen and that voice
[36:37] was a voice that glorified Jesus Christ
[36:40] amen in his glorification and Peter says
[36:43] amen that he it was a more sure word of
[36:45] Prophecy in other words they seen Isaiah
[36:48] they sing Malachi they seen Ezekiel they
[36:51] sing the words of the prophets but they
[36:54] didn't they wasn't reading them that
[36:55] morning they were looking at them with
[36:57] their own eyes and he said we were
[36:59] eyewitnesses of the Majesty of our
[37:02] almighty God and he said these are not
[37:04] fables we're following this virgin birth
[37:06] that we've been this is not a fable amen
[37:08] the power of God that we've been talking
[37:10] about these things are not fables and he
[37:13] was testifying of a mount
[37:15] Transfiguration experience when they
[37:17] were on that mountain now listen friends
[37:19] we are not on Mount Transfiguration over
[37:21] there in Jerusalem tonight amen but we
[37:24] have had a Jordan River at the Ohio
[37:27] river and we've had a mount
[37:29] Transfiguration with the message of the
[37:32] hour and we've come up on Mount Sunset
[37:34] amen and we've seen a cloud come down
[37:36] and we heard a voice saying this day
[37:39] this scripture is fulfilled it's not a
[37:42] private interpretation him the word of
[37:45] God has become manifest in this
[37:47] generation to carry a bride from one
[37:49] dimension to another amen if you're a
[37:52] part of the word you're a part of the
[37:53] whole word and the word don't just have
[37:56] a prophet bringing a message it's got a
[37:58] People receiving the message and the
[38:00] people receiving the message are going
[38:02] to walk to the message till it changes
[38:04] their mortal blinds hey I believe it
[38:08] tonight I know that prophecy is not a
[38:10] private interpretation
[38:13] amen but God will change it in First
[38:15] Corinthians 13 watch the beauty of this
[38:17] here we are again with love
[38:20] but then that which is perfect has come
[38:22] that punch in part is done away now I
[38:25] want to say a little something right
[38:26] here there's a lot of mix up on this
[38:28] scripture and I don't mean it to to be
[38:30] mean but I'll just say this the Church
[38:32] of Christ interpret this scripture that
[38:34] when the perfect word comes then the the
[38:37] gifts are done away that's why they've
[38:39] interpret that scripture amen so they do
[38:42] a good job proving that one don't fade
[38:44] which is love and that's true love is
[38:47] eternal the gifts will cease how many
[38:49] knows that and that's what Paul is
[38:51] saying the gifts will cease but how many
[38:53] knows when they cease the prophet said
[38:56] the apostolic age does not end amen
[38:59] until the calling ages over as long as
[39:02] God is calling there's an Apostolic age
[39:04] so don't interpret this that whenever
[39:07] the message comes the gifts are done
[39:09] away with because it's not at all
[39:10] brother Ben said the apostolic age
[39:12] doesn't exceed doesn't cease nor does
[39:15] the power of Pentecost cease amen with a
[39:18] coming of the word it's a Church of
[39:20] Christ Doctrine to teach it otherwise
[39:21] amen and we're not Church of Christ
[39:23] right we're we are Bible Believers and
[39:26] and God bless the Church of Christ I
[39:28] pray I pray God do great things for them
[39:30] amen but we're talking about a rapture
[39:33] we're talking about a Rapture when I was
[39:35] a child I spake as a child understood as
[39:38] a child thought as a child but when I
[39:39] become a man I put away childish things
[39:41] now you know he's going up this pyramid
[39:43] for now we see through a glass Darkly
[39:45] but then we shall see face to face I
[39:48] will know in part that then shall I know
[39:50] even as I am also known you said
[39:53] preacher what are you talking about that
[39:54] cat stone is Love First Corinthians 13
[39:57] is a chapter of love and it's saying in
[40:01] the age of love when that perfect thing
[40:03] comes you will be known you will know as
[40:07] you were known now now somebody said
[40:09] well Bill Wayne what difference does it
[40:11] say that we know who we are amen I'm
[40:13] talking about Rapture Revelation here
[40:15] the prophet of God said when this bride
[40:17] knows
[40:19] who she is the rapture will go have you
[40:23] ever thought that the right shirt
[40:25] Revelation to you is a knowledge of who
[40:28] you are how many realizes adoption has
[40:30] to do with the maturity of who you are
[40:33] amen amen the Holy Ghost is your witness
[40:35] that you were Sons to begin with and now
[40:38] he's come to lead you into the fullness
[40:40] of the word of God in the dispensation
[40:43] that we're living in amen it comes at
[40:46] the time of Love Can we go to one more
[40:47] scripture first John chapter 3 and watch
[40:50] this scripture first John chapter 3 and
[40:52] verse 1 I could preach a month on this
[40:54] one behold what manner of love the
[40:56] father had bestowed upon us that we
[40:58] should be called the sons of God
[41:00] therefore the world knew us is not
[41:02] because it knew him not what kind of
[41:04] love does it take for God to call us
[41:07] sons of God
[41:13] sons of God somebody said well if we're
[41:16] Sons then we're in a place of maturity
[41:18] and we don't need the Holy Ghost anymore
[41:20] we don't need the move of God anymore
[41:22] come on church amen but the Bible said
[41:25] that he asked job where were you when
[41:28] the sons of God were shouting for Joy he
[41:31] didn't say when the babies of God was
[41:33] shouting for Joy or when the infants of
[41:35] God or the immature church is shouting
[41:37] for Joy he said when the sons of God
[41:40] were shouting for Joy I actually believe
[41:42] it's a sign of maturity when the church
[41:45] can know that it has a need of God he
[41:48] doesn't need of the Holy Ghost it's only
[41:50] an immature church that believes they
[41:52] can do these works on their own or they
[41:54] can live as a Christian on their own but
[41:57] the but the higher you get in God Amen
[41:59] the prophet of God said watch that wheat
[42:01] just before Harvest he said the head
[42:04] will begin to bow my goodness he'll
[42:08] begin to see that he needs God what kind
[42:10] of what kind of love is it that he would
[42:12] bestow upon bonus it's agape love we're
[42:15] we're at love again but now we are the
[42:18] sons of God it does not yet appear what
[42:20] we shall be but we know that when he
[42:22] shall appear we shall be like him for we
[42:25] shall see him as he is
[42:27] brother we shall see him as he is glass
[42:31] Darkly in the days of Paul come on I
[42:34] didn't write it Paul did grass rocked it
[42:36] Darkly in the days of Paul but there is
[42:38] coming a Time according to Daniel 12
[42:40] that in the end time the seals will be
[42:43] broke off of the Bible and you would see
[42:45] it face to face amen there was a time
[42:48] that man looked Darkly but not today a
[42:50] day star has risen in this generation
[42:53] the Vindicated word has shined the light
[42:56] even in the evening time it shall be
[42:59] light amen the word of God manifested
[43:02] will bring a Clarity to the church I say
[43:05] the Sun is up amen I say confusion is
[43:07] over I say dark and gloomy days have
[43:10] come to an end we have seen the
[43:12] resurrection and power of Jesus Christ
[43:15] in this generation the very thing that
[43:17] will change your body is not coming the
[43:19] thing that will change your body is here
[43:21] that's what sweeps through these
[43:23] buildings amen when you when you feel
[43:25] the power of God and somebody breaks out
[43:27] dancing somebody hollering Hallelujah
[43:29] glory to God you say what's wrong with
[43:31] them it's called the Dynamics of the
[43:34] spirits and that's exactly what hits the
[43:37] mechanics of the word and causes a
[43:39] change in the body
[43:43] [Applause]
[43:50] see amen we shall see him as he is how
[43:54] many knows that man didn't understand
[43:55] what man was until First John 3 said we
[43:58] should when he shall appear we shall see
[44:01] him like he is brother random brother
[44:02] bam teaches this particular scripture
[44:04] and says see it didn't it didn't appear
[44:06] what man was going to be he said but the
[44:09] other day
[44:10] I went over there and he said they're
[44:13] men now ever been a man he said the
[44:16] theophany is not a spirit it's a temple
[44:18] it's a body it eat and he he said or not
[44:21] he said but it was in every way a man he
[44:24] said I embraced them they were ever bit
[44:26] there they were men and women every bit
[44:28] man and woman he said everything but the
[44:30] glands he said that that wasn't there he
[44:32] said but they were real amen do you see
[44:35] the age we're living in when the
[44:37] revelation of theophany Amen isn't it
[44:40] beautiful when you come to the time of
[44:42] change is when the time of the
[44:44] revelation of theophany breaks out upon
[44:46] the church this was not known in other
[44:49] Ages come on Church it wasn't known Paul
[44:52] said I went over there and I rode of it
[44:54] in a few words it was illegal for me to
[44:57] talk about what I saw over there he said
[44:59] a Melchizedek he said I said a few
[45:01] things he said but you can't take it now
[45:04] but there is coming another church there
[45:06] is coming another season and it's coming
[45:09] Another Time come on Church and and Paul
[45:12] spoke of Melchizedek a few times William
[45:15] Branham preached this entire sermons on
[45:17] who is this Melchizedek who was at
[45:20] church
[45:21] it was God in theophany and at the time
[45:25] of the revelation of the church
[45:27] receiving theophany revelation God
[45:30] himself came to give it we knew God had
[45:33] a theophany we didn't know we had
[45:35] theophany but God revealed it in this
[45:38] message and William Branham built an
[45:40] entire tape and sent it back to the
[45:42] church because it's no longer illegal to
[45:45] know it it's not illegal to know it it's
[45:49] the age of Revelation it's the age of
[45:51] wisdom and knowledge it's the age you
[45:54] will be know the way you have been known
[45:57] of God
[45:57] [Applause]
[45:59] brother let me tell you what if we don't
[46:02] pass her go to sleep here and we're
[46:04] we're going to be changed God's got a
[46:06] body that we can step right into brother
[46:08] man said death he off and he'll come
[46:10] right here and we'll be changed he said
[46:12] if we're asleep God will raise us up in
[46:15] that theophany and meet it with this
[46:16] physical body but brother let me tell
[46:19] you this when it's all over we're all
[46:21] changed whether we're alive or whether
[46:23] we're dead we all change by the power of
[46:26] God and that power is already in the
[46:29] building tonight the power that will
[46:31] change your body is what heals the sick
[46:33] it's what saves the laws it's what
[46:35] brings the gifts it's what brings the
[46:37] power of God come on friends we don't
[46:39] need to throw out the thing we need for
[46:41] change
[46:46] my goodness
[46:48] yes sir yes sir bring our bring our
[46:51] pyramid back up here
[46:53] yes sir when it comes to that love isn't
[46:55] that isn't that amazing the offany
[46:58] Revelation comes
[46:59] Seven Seals are open
[47:02] all this comes the capping of that stone
[47:04] spoken word original say brother I'm
[47:06] sitting in that pyramid you could take a
[47:07] razor blade and can't run between the
[47:10] rocks it was so fitly put together they
[47:12] said Solomon's Temple was the same he
[47:14] says but watch now there comes that
[47:16] headstone crying Grace Grace amazing The
[47:19] Headstone now here you've got it written
[47:21] above that it's love but above it it
[47:23] says Grace the reason Grace is on this
[47:25] headstone is because of what brother
[47:27] Branham teaches I'm not sure who drew
[47:29] this probably brother Ronnie milavo but
[47:31] uh but I'll say this to you amen this is
[47:34] coming from the prophecy of Zechariah 4
[47:37] you all know the prophecy we've preached
[47:38] it brother Sean's priesthood brother
[47:40] Andrew we've all preached this because
[47:41] William Branham was as Rubble to the
[47:43] church right and when the Bible said
[47:46] when he lays the foundation you can
[47:48] rejoice when you see the plummet in the
[47:50] hand of the ruble when you sings
[47:52] cerebrum will walk out with a plummet
[47:54] when you see William Branham walk out in
[47:55] his ministry you can Rejoice now what
[47:58] was they rejoicing for because he wasn't
[48:00] only going to lay the foundation
[48:02] he was also going to bring the headstone
[48:05] the message isn't bringing the headstone
[48:08] the message is the headstone
[48:13] don't you believe in the Corporal yes I
[48:16] believe in the Corporal body of Jesus
[48:17] Christ we will go meet him
[48:19] but what we're talking about tonight's
[48:20] the head to the church The Headstone is
[48:23] the spirit of God brother Mary says what
[48:25] caps the church now of course amen there
[48:28] Comes This headstone crying Grace Grace
[48:31] there Comes A Spoken Word Original Seed
[48:34] brother man said Grace Grace Amazing
[48:36] Grace there it is he said that's the
[48:38] headstone see you see it coming up
[48:40] justification here it comes now God
[48:42] taken it see he come from the Sanctified
[48:45] Bunch up to that Pentecostal Bunch
[48:47] restoration of the gifts now God has
[48:49] taken it from there and honing out a
[48:51] bunch to make a Ministry just like the
[48:54] word because it's got to fit with the
[48:56] word
[48:58] see God sent that baptism of the Holy
[49:00] Ghost now a lot of people get really uh
[49:02] messed up on this there's a lot of
[49:04] arguments and I don't want to teach
[49:05] tonight on dispensations but let me just
[49:07] make this real clear to you but baptism
[49:09] of the Holy Ghost that fell on Azusa
[49:11] Street was not a holy ghost falling like
[49:15] it did in the upper room and somebody
[49:17] said somebody asked me one time they
[49:19] said brother Wayne what's the difference
[49:20] because it went into a husk showing it
[49:24] was a denomination which was a part of
[49:26] the Holy Ghost it wasn't the true Holy
[49:29] Ghost and Prophet God said the reason we
[49:31] know it is because the word hadn't come
[49:33] yet amen but then watch amen what we
[49:36] have is we have the word coming and
[49:39] bringing the true baptism of the Holy
[49:41] Ghost which is the Holy Ghost falling
[49:44] under a son of man age
[49:48] just to clarify to you we believe in the
[49:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[49:53] but we're talking about under the son of
[49:55] man Administration now watch what he's
[49:57] talking about in Zechariah 4 amen uh if
[50:00] you if you're if if you want to talk
[50:01] more on it later I'll be glad to
[50:03] Zechariah Chapter Four he said who
[50:05] aren't thou old Greek Mountain before
[50:07] it's Aruba thou shall become a plane and
[50:09] he shall bring forth the headstones
[50:12] shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it
[50:16] amen isn't that beautiful too gracious
[50:19] amen look Grace Grace say it with me
[50:21] Grace Grace there's two Graces right now
[50:25] if you go to the scripture somebody said
[50:26] well brother Wayne how is there two
[50:28] Graces in the New Testament how it's
[50:30] just the grace of God right but how is
[50:32] there two Graces well if you go to Titus
[50:35] Paul says it like this for the grace of
[50:37] God that bringeth salvation hath
[50:40] appeared unto all men
[50:42] so there was your grace and the time of
[50:44] Paul and it appeared unto all men but in
[50:47] the 13th verse just after that he'll say
[50:50] but we're looking for that blessed hope
[50:52] and the Glorious appearing of our Lord
[50:54] Jesus Christ and savior so he said
[50:56] there's something that has appeared to
[50:58] man but we're looking for something
[51:01] Paul was not saying everything that you
[51:03] were looking for was there at his moment
[51:05] he was projecting something in the
[51:07] future and he was saying it's appeared
[51:09] unto man but there's something coming
[51:11] now watch this because if you go to
[51:13] First Peter 1 and 13 you'll see it again
[51:15] we're forgot the loins of your mind to
[51:18] be sober and to the hope of the end for
[51:20] the grace that is to be brought unto you
[51:23] at the revelation of Jesus Christ come
[51:27] on church amen The Book of Revelations
[51:29] was not opened in the time of Peter it
[51:32] wasn't even written yet
[51:34] but in the revelation of Jesus Christ
[51:36] that would have to come of Grace how
[51:38] many knows why it's Grace because you
[51:40] can't open the Bible said no man can
[51:42] open this book no man could look at no
[51:45] man could open this book the book of
[51:48] redemption had been sealed from the
[51:50] Garden of Eden
[51:52] right it's sealed from the Garden of
[51:54] Eden and it would take the grace of God
[51:56] to open up that book in the end time now
[51:59] if you go back here and look at what he
[52:01] has to say about he said the grace of
[52:02] God is brought unto you at the
[52:04] revelation of Jesus Christ now you all
[52:06] probably have that book rojc you call it
[52:09] revelation of Jesus Christ
[52:12] right it's a it's an end time book
[52:16] coming from The Book of Revelations now
[52:18] if you watch Ephesians chapter 3 and
[52:20] verse 2 Peter Paul says it like this if
[52:23] you have heard of the dispensation of
[52:25] the grace of God which has given me to
[52:29] you in other words Paul was giving a
[52:32] dispensation of Grace and he brought a
[52:35] Grace that appeared unto all men but
[52:37] he's prophesying there's coming a time
[52:39] you're going to see face to face there's
[52:41] a time you won't be looking in the glass
[52:43] Darkly there'll be a time John says
[52:45] there'll be a time when you shall be no
[52:47] as you are known amen Paul said when
[52:50] Christ who is our light shall appear
[52:52] amen something's going to transpire as
[52:55] Jesus said a little while and the world
[52:57] will see me no more but ye shall see me
[53:00] I will be with you even in you because I
[53:02] live ye live also watch two
[53:05] resurrections I live ye live also and in
[53:08] that day come on that was not Jesus day
[53:11] that was not Paul's day that was not
[53:13] Peter's day that was not ruther's day
[53:16] but in the day amen that God would say
[53:19] and I am in the Father the father and me
[53:21] and I and you Amen in that day you shall
[53:24] know you said preacher what day is it
[53:26] the prophet of God said it was the day
[53:27] the Revelation was made known my
[53:31] goodness that's our day
[53:34] it's the day of rapture it's a preacher
[53:38] what are you talking about brother man
[53:39] preaches the message of Grace and he
[53:41] said that great Prince is going to call
[53:43] Grace Grace so zerubbabel the Old
[53:45] Testament is William Branham in the New
[53:47] Testament he's restoring the temple not
[53:51] by pie not by power but by Spirit now
[53:54] brother Brandon said this true message
[53:55] of Grace Remains the Same and that's
[53:58] what Satan has tried to knock from the
[54:00] church is the grace of God that we're
[54:03] all saved by
[54:04] the grace of God not by denomination not
[54:07] by The Works of man but by the grace of
[54:10] God that's where salvation has come from
[54:11] the message of Grace brother random says
[54:14] it like this he says oh he said we
[54:16] wouldn't have a chance of poor unlearned
[54:19] people he said but it doesn't take
[54:21] knowledge he said but it'll take not by
[54:24] might or by power but by my spirit now
[54:27] watch this I'll unfold this mystery
[54:32] and he will cry Grace Grace with
[54:35] shoutings and cryings the unfolding of
[54:38] the mystery was the bringing of The
[54:41] Headstone according to brother Branham
[54:42] the unfolding of the seals is the
[54:45] mystery of the coming of the countstone
[54:47] if you're listening to the breach and
[54:50] brother man must tell it there and he'll
[54:52] be preaching long and he'll say this
[54:53] great book nobody could touch it y'all
[54:55] know the story he said if nobody could
[54:57] touch it at all he said but listen he
[54:59] says but now it's come the time he said
[55:02] let him come forward now and take the
[55:04] book or forever hold his peace is that
[55:07] right amen but the Bible in Revelations
[55:09] 5 said and he come and took the book
[55:12] amen and in the breach message guess
[55:15] what we get the first seal on the next
[55:16] night because he come and took the book

[59:02] faith for Rapture Grace have you ever
[59:04] wondered why you need faith for Rapture
[59:06] Grace because the kind of Grace I'm
[59:08] talking about is Grace that you cannot
[59:11] get without God giving it to you I'm
[59:14] talking about Divine love projecting
[59:16] Sovereign Grace Divine love projects
[59:20] Sovereign Grace we have received
[59:22] Sovereign Grace in this generation faith
[59:25] for grace in other words it's going to
[59:27] take a revelation to understand how God
[59:29] could give a man this much grace you'll
[59:31] never get it to denomination you'll
[59:34] never get it to the ideas of man it
[59:36] would take a prophet to go into the high
[59:37] and a part of God's mind and say you
[59:40] always were a CERN and he would pick it
[59:43] up in Ephesians and he would pick it up
[59:44] in the Book of Job and he would pick it
[59:46] up in the Book of Revelations and he
[59:47] would prove his words that you were in
[59:49] the mind of God from before the
[59:51] foundation of the world and you have
[59:53] fell into this Earth as a as a bypassing
[59:56] of your theophany but God can't leave
[59:58] you here you're a very part of the very
[1:00:01] soul and the gene of almighty God and he
[1:00:04] sent this message to redeem you to find
[1:00:07] you to look you up like an eagle looked
[1:00:09] up a baby eagle come on church God come
[1:00:12] to find you and he didn't come to find
[1:00:14] you to leave you here and make it
[1:00:17] through this judgment but the grace of
[1:00:19] God I'm talking about is God come to
[1:00:21] catch you he come to bring you he come
[1:00:24] to make you move you into the rapturing
[1:00:27] of the church and Escape before the
[1:00:30] tribulation and it's going to take Faith

[1:00:37] you're going to have to have faith to
[1:00:38] believe this
[1:00:39] gonna take a revelation to understand
[1:00:41] how Wayne Lawson can go in the rapture
[1:00:46] that's right
[1:00:47] but Mark's going to take Revelation
[1:00:49] you're going to take understanding
[1:00:51] how can God look at this man
[1:00:54] and say he's spotless
[1:00:57] but Sean's going to take the grace of
[1:00:59] God it's but it takes Revelation the
[1:01:01] grace of God that we can look at one
[1:01:03] another and say this man is spotless
[1:01:04] never a mistake when somebody well I
[1:01:07] know I must take that guy I know a
[1:01:09] mistake brother Wang May amen but see

[1:01:35] and God couldn't see the sin isn't that
[1:01:37] powerful amen they couldn't see the
[1:01:39] atonement but God couldn't see the sin

[1:01:43] the atonement and nor could they hear
[1:01:45] the shadow of the king that was in the
[1:01:47] camp they couldn't hear and they
[1:01:49] couldn't see but there was a people of

[1:04:52] kind of cases he takes them out of the
[1:04:54] bar rooms he takes them out of the
[1:04:56] streets he takes the power of God fills
[1:04:59] their heart and then puts them in a
[1:05:01] Pulpit to say I am a witness that God
[1:05:05] still saves and feels and heals amen
[1:05:08] we've got the power of God in this
[1:05:10] generation we've already got it and let
[1:05:12] me say this I've already got Rapture and
[1:05:15] Grace you have come too late to tell me
[1:05:17] that this message ain't got the grace
[1:05:19] for rights
[1:05:21] the preacher what are you talking about
[1:05:23] brother man said when you got the Holy
[1:05:24] Ghost you got everything in you
[1:05:28] come on church when that love set down
[1:05:31] on that pyramid it was all there already
[1:05:34] come on it was already in there amen and
[1:05:37] God has put everything you need for a
[1:05:41] Rapture in you already
[1:05:43] [Applause]
[1:05:47] Devil's not making you looking for
[1:05:49] something I tell you what you ought to
[1:05:51] do you ought to quit looking you ought
[1:05:53] to quit looking for it and start looking
[1:05:54] at it
[1:05:58] we done got Rapture and Grace
[1:06:02] and here's something to think about
[1:06:03] brother shamaya brother Bram said law
[1:06:05] having a good shadow of things to come
[1:06:07] he said what the law offered he said the
[1:06:09] next chapter in the 11th verse Daniel
[1:06:10] done it unto the law look what Enoch
[1:06:13] done under the law
[1:06:15] look what Moses done under the law
[1:06:17] he said then if he was living in the
[1:06:19] shadow of the atonement
[1:06:21] he said what ought the Christian Church
[1:06:24] do today was the reality of the
[1:06:26] resurrection of Jesus Christ we're
[1:06:29] standing tonight friends I tell you it
[1:06:31] ought to make every Christian buckle up
[1:06:33] his armor you know to put on the full
[1:06:34] armor of God and sure bring the
[1:06:37] breastplate in the helmet the shield and
[1:06:38] all these things Paul said like a
[1:06:40] soldier going into the battle The Wiles
[1:06:42] of the enemy come up throw up your
[1:06:43] Shield go on out to meet him if the law
[1:06:46] can produce that what of the reality of
[1:06:49] the blood of Jesus Christ amen he said
[1:06:52] when a dead letter will do that what are
[1:06:54] the resurrect constraints of the power
[1:06:57] and the spirit amen what could it
[1:06:59] produce if the law without the spirit
[1:07:02] produced that what would the spirit of
[1:07:04] Jesus Christ do in the Church of the
[1:07:07] Living God I think it'll do it I think
[1:07:09] it'll do more to make us feel good I
[1:07:11] think it'll take us into a realm real
[1:07:14] quick and everything about us come on
[1:07:16] Church it'll Quicken our language it'll
[1:07:18] Quicken our step it'll Quicken the way
[1:07:20] we feel see visions prophesy of course
[1:07:23] all kinds of gifts will be in the church
[1:07:25] but there's another level
[1:07:27] and that levels when the word comes down
[1:07:30] in divine order and the church walks
[1:07:32] puts One Foot In Front Of Another until
[1:07:35] they are no more
[1:07:39] you say preacher what are you talking
[1:07:41] about I'm talking about the time of
[1:07:42] change
[1:07:44] it's a junction and brother man the
[1:07:46] cause of those times brother man said
[1:07:48] watch those Junctions Enoch live in a
[1:07:50] junctional time and God came down and
[1:07:52] walked with that man
[1:07:54] he said well hey man they like that in
[1:07:56] other ages it's all right this is a
[1:07:57] different age it's a different time it's
[1:08:00] a different period This is a junction
[1:08:02] it's when mortality and immortality are
[1:08:05] meeting it's when Time and Eternity are
[1:08:07] blending together it's when the ages are
[1:08:10] ending and the bride is stepping out to
[1:08:12] take a change listen friends we are not
[1:08:15] living in the days even the brother
[1:08:16] random we are 50 years past come on 57
[1:08:20] years on Christmas Eve past brother
[1:08:23] Adam's going oh God Amen Enoch changed
[1:08:27] 57 years after Adam died I don't know if
[1:08:30] it means anything but it's pretty good
[1:08:32] to me amen Adam was going 57 years when
[1:08:34] Enoch walked off of the earth and here
[1:08:37] we've been 57 years without the prophet
[1:08:39] and I believe there's a bride going to
[1:08:41] walk off of this Earth anytime I believe
[1:08:43] in church I believe walking time just in
[1:08:46] time change time we're there we're at
[1:08:50] that time you said brother Wayne why are
[1:08:52] you saying that because brother bam said
[1:08:53] just before the time of changed God came
[1:08:55] down in omnipotence and done them around
[1:08:58] gosh
[1:09:00] he came down in omnipotence and done the
[1:09:03] miraculous at the time of a junction God
[1:09:06] does something Supernatural well listen
[1:09:09] let me tell you why I believe we're in a
[1:09:11] junction of years we're leaving 22 and
[1:09:13] we're going in 23. Amen Let the
[1:09:16] omnipotence of God come down in your
[1:09:18] heart and do a miracle tonight and say
[1:09:21] God I tell you what I'm gonna do every
[1:09:23] bad thing that was in 22 every bad thing
[1:09:26] that was in 21 I'm going to lay it aside
[1:09:29] and I'm going to walk with God I'm gonna
[1:09:32] walk on like never before Lord I'm Not
[1:09:35] Looking Back
[1:09:36] not picking up troubles I'm gonna move
[1:09:39] forward by the grace of God Amen because
[1:09:41] God is here it's a time to walk with him
[1:09:44] omnipotence has come to do Supernatural
[1:09:47] things go walking with omnipotence and
[1:09:49] see what could take place walk with the
[1:09:51] power of God and see what happens come
[1:09:54] on church I know what I'm talking about
[1:09:55] come and preach little meetings like
[1:09:57] this whether it be maybe 150 200 people
[1:09:59] gather them up on a Wednesday night and
[1:10:01] amen and something happened in that
[1:10:03] meeting we talk about 10 years later
[1:10:06] Miracles take place when the word of God
[1:10:08] is being preached cancers have dropped
[1:10:10] off of people leukemia has been healed
[1:10:13] because we are in a season that the
[1:10:15] omnipotence of God is here to do the
[1:10:18] miraculous Among Us a miracle work in
[1:10:21] God is Among Us
[1:10:24] now Enoch needed a way out
[1:10:27] and there was no airplanes during this
[1:10:29] time
[1:10:29] brother by Adam said see he had the
[1:10:32] Revelation and how but God going to do
[1:10:34] it he said there wasn't even a jet plane
[1:10:36] to get him off his feet
[1:10:38] man had never even been on a jet
[1:10:40] and he was talking about walking
[1:10:43] into another dimension
[1:10:45] but God provided a way
[1:10:47] a translation that took Enoch from Earth
[1:10:50] to Glory without receiving death
[1:10:52] so have you ever thought about where
[1:10:55] Enoch was before Enoch was not
[1:11:00] where was Enoch before Enoch was not he
[1:11:03] was in God's provided way
[1:11:06] come on Church you are standing where
[1:11:10] Enoch was before Enoch was not
[1:11:16] now God provided away brother bam told
[1:11:20] him he said Enoch needed a ladder and
[1:11:21] God gave him a highway
[1:11:24] isn't that powerful
[1:11:26] he said I want I I tell you what brother
[1:11:28] Wayne I want a Rapture God give you a
[1:11:29] message to walk with
[1:11:31] you say I want a translation God give
[1:11:33] you a word to go walking with it
[1:11:37] do you know that when Enoch took off on
[1:11:39] that wall it was a special time it was a
[1:11:41] time when it was a time when the when
[1:11:44] the Eternal Walk was Immortal
[1:11:48] that's a sermon isn't it brother Terry
[1:11:49] it's a Time the Eternal well the more I
[1:11:52] think brother Mark said he's been
[1:11:53] preaching on immortality season
[1:11:57] blending of dimensions
[1:12:00] tell me it's not Timely
[1:12:02] literally we're that's what we are
[1:12:06] it's a season
[1:12:09] do you see brother Brandon says you know
[1:12:11] maybe we don't have the power to walk
[1:12:13] like Enoch did and take an afternoon
[1:12:15] strong go home he said but I do believe
[1:12:17] it will happen and I know there will be
[1:12:20] a Rapture in the last days
[1:12:21] so maybe they didn't have it then he
[1:12:23] said but I know it's got to come
[1:12:25] somebody's going to do this now watch
[1:12:27] this let's go let's go and read this and
[1:12:30] and I don't let's go to that next
[1:12:32] pyramid picture I Got That Rock
[1:12:34] let's let's go let's go out here now you
[1:12:37] all recognize that picture right there
[1:12:39] what that is that is the rock that's in
[1:12:42] Sabino Canyon how many business can you
[1:12:46] so a lot of you has not been there just
[1:12:47] a few of you been there some of you've
[1:12:48] been there and you know exactly where
[1:12:49] I'm going with this but but isn't it
[1:12:52] amazing that here's another pyramid
[1:12:55] here's here's another pyramid
[1:12:58] brother Brown describes this pyramid in
[1:13:00] the wings of the snow white dove
[1:13:03] and he's talking about his ministry and
[1:13:06] the change that's coming upon him and
[1:13:09] he's and he he says I went down that day
[1:13:11] and I think it was around noon or so 11
[1:13:13] o'clock he said I went down and got a
[1:13:14] drink and come back up he said and and I
[1:13:17] stood next to that rock where Perry's
[1:13:19] Standing There Brother Branham put
[1:13:20] himself against The Rock with a bare
[1:13:22] chest he just walked up and got against
[1:13:24] The Rock but but when he did this
[1:13:28] this rock was there and there's a little
[1:13:30] path if you're if you're looking at it
[1:13:32] it would be like this being the pyramid
[1:13:34] and I'm going to walk by it there's a
[1:13:37] path now I'm not got a big path here but
[1:13:40] I'm gonna walk this path to show you the
[1:13:41] path might be that wide you know but
[1:13:44] after but right right on the other side
[1:13:46] of the path it's just a drop off down to
[1:13:48] the creek so you it wouldn't be really
[1:13:50] passable this rock was sitting right in
[1:13:53] the pathway
[1:13:54] then but when you when you went there
[1:13:56] brother Doug Baker took me there the
[1:13:58] first time he took me on a nice tour
[1:13:59] there and went there kids and when we
[1:14:01] walked up to it uh if if you if you look
[1:14:05] on the ground out in front of it like if
[1:14:08] you look on the ground out this way out
[1:14:10] in front of the rock down on the hill
[1:14:11] there's more there's another half of
[1:14:13] that rock laying down there and brother
[1:14:15] when I walked up to it brother uh
[1:14:17] but the dog he says he said brother
[1:14:19] Wayne you notice anything odd about
[1:14:21] these rocks and I said yeah of course I
[1:14:23] said that rock down there has been
[1:14:25] dynamited I said the the drill marks are
[1:14:27] still on the Rock he said do you know
[1:14:29] that I said well I used to drill and
[1:14:30] shoot rocks on Highway construction and
[1:14:32] big rock Cuts you go through I've done a
[1:14:34] bunch of them so I knew immediately what
[1:14:36] them rocks what that cut was in that
[1:14:38] rock it was a drill bit that had cut the
[1:14:40] Rock and had blasted it and he said well
[1:14:42] he said what's amazing he says that this
[1:14:45] that this path right here was drilled
[1:14:48] and shot and that they split this rock
[1:14:51] in half and built this path that walks
[1:14:53] right through there I said man that's
[1:14:54] amazing well this pyramid of course
[1:14:57] has been opened right this rock has been
[1:15:00] opened with a blast
[1:15:02] all right where he's standing when
[1:15:04] brother Branham walks up to the Rock he
[1:15:07] says he was standing there now if you're
[1:15:09] if you're there during the time of day
[1:15:10] you'll find out why he's standing so
[1:15:12] close to rock there's no shade trees
[1:15:15] right so this Rock's basically the only
[1:15:17] shade and if the Sun is high you
[1:15:19] basically have to get against The Rock
[1:15:21] before you get any shade so he's
[1:15:24] standing there with his shirt off
[1:15:25] staying against this rock and the Lord
[1:15:27] speaks to him and says look under your
[1:15:29] heart y'all remember the story look
[1:15:31] under your hearts in the end of the
[1:15:32] Wings the snow white dove give me the
[1:15:34] next picture look under your heart and
[1:15:36] when he looks under his heart this is
[1:15:38] what he sees it's uh maybe you can't see
[1:15:41] it very well there but it's the word
[1:15:43] Eagle written in white courts
[1:15:46] it's the word eagle
[1:15:48] the fourth anointing in the Book of
[1:15:51] Revelations was Eagle
[1:15:53] amen the fourth anointing was prophetic
[1:15:55] was Eagle how many knows that was that
[1:15:57] was a symbol of brother Graham's
[1:15:58] Ministry was Eagle right and and he puts
[1:16:01] his heart on it and there it is in white
[1:16:04] courts written the word Eagle give me
[1:16:06] the other ones there's a couple more
[1:16:07] there uh well yeah you can see this here
[1:16:10] just there it is right there I had
[1:16:11] Cheyenne Erickson to darken the rock she
[1:16:15] didn't touch the courts she just
[1:16:16] darkened The Rock uh with edification
[1:16:18] she didn't change anything I just had to
[1:16:21] put a darker color on the Rock so you
[1:16:22] could see that it's actually the word
[1:16:25] Eagle written in white courts Now give
[1:16:28] me that other picture of brother Perry
[1:16:29] green
[1:16:30] I worry standing against that rock now
[1:16:32] you can see where it's Eagle there now
[1:16:34] right it's probably striking brother
[1:16:35] Perry somewhere maybe right in here amen
[1:16:38] now when brother Branham walks up there
[1:16:40] hey man when he is told to look he said
[1:16:43] what's that lane under your heart and
[1:16:46] isn't it amazing that Perry being a
[1:16:48] little bit of a taller man it's going to
[1:16:50] strike him different than it struck
[1:16:52] brother Branham
[1:16:53] but God has so designed things
[1:16:56] that he knew how the statue of his
[1:16:59] prophet he knew the size of this man he
[1:17:03] knew the measurement of his heart from
[1:17:05] the from the dirt yeah I'm talking about
[1:17:07] God now I'm not talking about I'm not
[1:17:09] talking about engineers and Architects
[1:17:11] I'm talking about God
[1:17:13] and he engineered this thing where this
[1:17:15] man's heart now you sing this word Eagle
[1:17:17] what's it this long four or five inches
[1:17:19] now I'm not a mathematician there's
[1:17:21] probably some very smart people sitting
[1:17:22] in here tonight amen maybe you could
[1:17:24] help me with the statistics but what is
[1:17:26] the statistics that a man at the size of
[1:17:29] William Branham would put his open chest
[1:17:33] on a rock that would strike him at the
[1:17:35] heart and it would be this big now how
[1:17:37] big is the world how many Roxas in the
[1:17:40] world how many Canyons is in the world
[1:17:42] if you just went into Arizona how many
[1:17:44] Canyons would they be how many rocks how
[1:17:46] many are you with me yet amen he didn't
[1:17:50] know Eagle was written there he just
[1:17:52] walked up to a rock and put his heart in
[1:17:54] there it was written in the Rock Eagle
[1:17:55] Amen in in a four inch spot in the
[1:17:58] entire world and he puts his heart over
[1:18:01] that spot and God says to him look
[1:18:03] what's written now Perry Greenwood and
[1:18:04] never got there would he he meant it
[1:18:06] just didn't strike him right amen he
[1:18:08] didn't strike him in the same place it
[1:18:10] did Brother Branham but it was struck
[1:18:12] brother about him in the heart with a
[1:18:12] the word Eagle now you you take it to
[1:18:15] that next one but what's amazing is that
[1:18:17] path well when we got to talking about
[1:18:19] this I said brother Doug then then this
[1:18:21] path evidently had to be in it had to
[1:18:24] been built in some time period where
[1:18:26] they've dynamited the front half of this
[1:18:28] pyramid off and opened this up he said
[1:18:30] that's right so amen immediately when I
[1:18:32] got home I started I started getting out
[1:18:34] the history books and I started looking
[1:18:36] at the at the Sabino canyons and looking
[1:18:38] at all the dates and all this do you all
[1:18:40] know they built the paths in subpino
[1:18:42] Canyon in 1933
[1:18:47] before
[1:18:48] 1933 you could have walked up to that
[1:18:52] path and there was no way to walk
[1:18:55] through that rock
[1:18:56] you it now today I could say to somebody
[1:18:59] hey have you ever walked that path in
[1:19:01] front of Eagle Rock and said oh yeah
[1:19:03] I've been on that path but in 1950 you
[1:19:05] could have said to one of the older guys
[1:19:07] I was down on this certain path the
[1:19:09] other day and they said well that path
[1:19:10] don't even exist
[1:19:12] see but it didn't exist when they were
[1:19:14] teenagers because it hadn't been opened
[1:19:16] yet
[1:19:17] see it took something to open the path
[1:19:20] of a certain season where you could walk
[1:19:23] the same place now listen I have stood
[1:19:26] right where the Prophet stood I have
[1:19:28] walked the same path at a prophet walk
[1:19:30] amen I literally passed through the same
[1:19:33] place he passed through and it's
[1:19:35] available today for a bride to literally
[1:19:38] walk the same path that William read
[1:19:41] themselves somebody said well brother
[1:19:43] Wayne we don't teach the Rapture like
[1:19:44] that because you know we was reading a
[1:19:46] book and back in 1884 they believed it
[1:19:49] was this way and back in back in in 1764
[1:19:52] this this great man believed it like
[1:19:55] this and another one says it believes it
[1:19:56] like that amen and there's nothing wrong
[1:19:58] with what they believed it wasn't opened
[1:20:01] in that generation it wasn't open in
[1:20:03] their season but in our generation God
[1:20:06] sent a message and at the same time
[1:20:10] at the same time that an angel of the
[1:20:13] Lord was appearing on the Ohio River
[1:20:15] anointing a man of God in 1933 amen a
[1:20:20] light came out of Heaven brother man
[1:20:21] said a light they called a star amen a
[1:20:24] light came out of heaven and said as
[1:20:26] John the Baptist was given Amen to
[1:20:28] forerun the first coming I'll give you a
[1:20:30] message and a forerunner's second coming
[1:20:32] and there's some old construction
[1:20:33] workers out there in Arizona drilling a
[1:20:36] rock have no clue why they're drilling
[1:20:39] it they have no clue why they're
[1:20:40] building probably a couple of them
[1:20:42] saying it's too hot for this work today
[1:20:43] I don't know why we couldn't have built
[1:20:45] this next fall or next year but when
[1:20:47] they blew that rock open amen there it
[1:20:50] was in the middle of that rock oh Church
[1:20:53] of the Living God that word Eagle was
[1:20:55] not revealed until
[1:20:58] 1933 you couldn't seen it before then
[1:21:01] but you can see it now
[1:21:05] you said preacher I'll tell you what you
[1:21:06] guys believe things that nobody else
[1:21:08] believes it's because they couldn't see
[1:21:10] it then
[1:21:13] but you can now brother bam called it
[1:21:15] this dispensation of Grace in the
[1:21:17] evening time now look at this this just
[1:21:19] before the antiluvian flood Amen brother
[1:21:21] Brandon said Noah he said was going to
[1:21:24] be leaving he said God give us a type
[1:21:25] and Enoch he said you know what he did
[1:21:27] he gave us a slow motion type
[1:21:30] isn't it powerful we're going to change
[1:21:32] the moment between July but the man said
[1:21:34] he slowed Enoch down and gave him a slow
[1:21:36] he gave us a slow motion type so we can
[1:21:40] study it he did it in slow motion hey
[1:21:43] man took 300 years to do it so that you
[1:21:45] could look at it and study it and know
[1:21:47] that it was real amen God commanded
[1:21:50] Enoch and everything God did commanded
[1:21:52] Enoch he did amen now prophet of God
[1:21:55] said see what it is any time that a man
[1:21:58] or a woman takes God at his word they
[1:22:01] are an astronaut
[1:22:03] amen and see today what astronauts and
[1:22:05] so forth have achieved in the natural
[1:22:07] God has been able to achieve in his
[1:22:10] church by the spiritual people who
[1:22:13] believe any man or woman who will dare
[1:22:16] at any time to take God at his word is
[1:22:19] an astronaut
[1:22:21] come on Enoch was an astronaut he took
[1:22:23] God at every word and he walked with the
[1:22:26] word of God a spiritual astronaut is an
[1:22:29] eagle and this is an eagle age and it's
[1:22:31] an eagle anointing and it's a power of
[1:22:34] God dropping on the church he said
[1:22:36] preacher what are you talking about I'm
[1:22:37] talking about when the Dynamics and the
[1:22:38] mechanics have come together you can
[1:22:40] come out here tonight amen and you can
[1:22:42] take a baseball bat and I could I could
[1:22:44] hit you it's just fake right in the knee
[1:22:46] and you'll need to come out just like
[1:22:47] that because I I hid it in a spot that
[1:22:50] gets a reaction probably anywhere I hit
[1:22:52] you with a baseball bat get a reaction
[1:22:53] amen but but but but but it it it's you
[1:22:56] you say well he struck me in the knee
[1:22:58] with it he struck me in the arm with it
[1:23:00] brother Branham said God struck Enoch
[1:23:04] with his Dynamics in Enoch's mechanics
[1:23:07] so he had the mechanics and God took the
[1:23:10] Dynamics and he struck him in the right
[1:23:12] place and when the mechanics and the
[1:23:15] Dynamics come together the quickening
[1:23:17] power of God took that man off of the
[1:23:19] earth and I'll tell you we've got a lot
[1:23:21] of McCain in the church come on we've
[1:23:23] been mechanically putting this church
[1:23:25] together for the last 50 years and I
[1:23:27] love the mechanics of this word you know
[1:23:29] what I'm preaching tonight I love the
[1:23:31] mechanics of this word but until the
[1:23:33] Dynamics of God strikes that mechanics
[1:23:36] it will not live but we are living in
[1:23:39] the generation where the Dynamics has
[1:23:41] come on the mechanics of the word for
[1:23:43] the changing of our body the quickening
[1:23:46] power of God Enoch walked with God
[1:23:50] Enoch walk with God he said Christians
[1:23:52] tonight we have an opportunity he said
[1:23:55] all the opportunity Saint Paul never
[1:23:58] dreamed of having we have opportunities
[1:24:01] Enoch and Elijah and all of them never
[1:24:03] had my goodness you got an opportunity
[1:24:07] tonight to walk with the omnipotent and
[1:24:10] see the miraculous among the Church of
[1:24:12] the Living God I think it's time to
[1:24:14] shake loose church I think it's time to
[1:24:16] shake loose of all of our thoughts of
[1:24:18] all of our feelings amen we are living
[1:24:20] in the darkest of all ages but God is
[1:24:23] simply omnipotent among us to cause us
[1:24:26] to walk in the power of God brother Adam
[1:24:29] said what we ought to do is walk come on
[1:24:31] now Rapture is progression we ought to
[1:24:34] walk he said faith is unconscious and I
[1:24:36] learned years ago in meetings and
[1:24:38] different walks he said faith is
[1:24:40] unconscious and you've got faith and
[1:24:42] don't even know you got it
[1:24:45] he said Jesus see he just walked right
[1:24:48] on unconscious he walked right on
[1:24:50] unconscious because he was here to
[1:24:52] fulfill a word he swore by himself
[1:24:54] brother bam said this you're here to
[1:24:56] fulfill a word too he said so you are to
[1:24:58] walk unconscious of fear you ought to
[1:25:01] walk unconscious of criticism good Lord
[1:25:04] what if what would we do if we did that
[1:25:06] if we didn't care what nobody said about
[1:25:08] us I'm walking this Trail right here and
[1:25:10] you can't stop me because on this Trail
[1:25:12] it's the change of my body on this Trail
[1:25:15] is omnipotence and miraculous come on
[1:25:18] church it's time to turn a deaf ear to
[1:25:21] all the criticism that is coming against
[1:25:24] us and say I'm going to walk with God
[1:25:26] I'm going to walk with him I'm not going
[1:25:28] to pay any attention to the left hand or
[1:25:30] to the right I won't have that boy win
[1:25:33] that bicycle
[1:25:34] had he win it he didn't look left he
[1:25:37] didn't look right he set a goal and he
[1:25:39] took off walking amen and that's exactly
[1:25:41] the Church of the Living God he said
[1:25:43] when something comes up in the church
[1:25:45] walk with God if sickness strikes you
[1:25:48] walk with God if your neighbor don't
[1:25:51] like you walk with God just keep walking
[1:25:56] [Applause]
[1:25:57] just keep walking when the doctor says
[1:26:01] you're going to die walk with God
[1:26:04] my goodness look what he says brother
[1:26:06] man says you'll have your ups and downs
[1:26:09] but don't you worry you're going to go
[1:26:10] through some Briar patches you're going
[1:26:12] to go through some sharp rocks over
[1:26:14] Bluffs down the hillsides up through the
[1:26:16] mountains and over the waters but walk
[1:26:18] with God it's time to walk with God Walk
[1:26:21] with every word amen forget it amen I
[1:26:23] know there's a lot of reasons to that
[1:26:25] the devil's throw it out there but we
[1:26:26] can walk with God anyhow
[1:26:28] [Applause]
[1:26:29] this is a Vindicated Revelation folks
[1:26:33] this isn't something that's a guesswork
[1:26:35] this is Vindicated Revelation somebody
[1:26:37] said well brother Wayne what are you
[1:26:38] talking about he not walk with God and
[1:26:40] then he wrote it and then Vindicated
[1:26:42] somebody said well brother Brandon you
[1:26:44] know he never he never did that but
[1:26:45] actually he did
[1:26:47] actually he did somebody said when did

[1:26:56] some of you boys been hunting out there
[1:26:58] knows what kind of storm strikes those
[1:26:59] mountains and brother Brown said I went
[1:27:01] way up on high on the mountain honoring
[1:27:03] my wife for her anniversary and he said
[1:27:06] I went out there and he said the Great
[1:27:07] Blizzard started striking I thought I
[1:27:09] better get out of here quick or I'm
[1:27:10] getting lost why that happens you get
[1:27:12] turned around you'll die off there he
[1:27:15] said but a voice called me said go right
[1:27:16] back up top there he said and I've lived
[1:27:19] long enough to know to obey the voice of
[1:27:21] God and there he was walking in the
[1:27:24] middle of a street can you imagine hey
[1:27:25] man somebody said brother brother you're
[1:27:27] going the wrong way but Sean you're
[1:27:29] going the wrong way as a storm on don't
[1:27:31] you know you ought to go that way amen
[1:27:33] but something had told him to go that
[1:27:35] way so he knew to obey God come on I'm
[1:27:38] talking about Enoch folks he meant he
[1:27:40] knew to walk with God and he walked in
[1:27:43] the middle of a storm it was blowing and
[1:27:45] hailing and rain was coming upon him but
[1:27:47] but God had something in mind he was
[1:27:50] walking with the omnipotence and God was
[1:27:52] going to do a miracle among them how
[1:27:54] many knows the story but the man said I
[1:27:56] walked up there he said that great storm
[1:27:58] must blow him and he said the Lord spoke
[1:28:00] to me and he said I am the one that
[1:28:02] calmed the waters
[1:28:05] I am the one that still the storms I'm
[1:28:07] the one that took the angriness out of
[1:28:10] the waves and my voice still has power
[1:28:12] he said you speak to this storm oh
[1:28:15] church we have forgot that there is a
[1:28:17] power in our voices we can still speak
[1:28:20] to the storms of Our Lives look what he
[1:28:23] done the prophet said storm go back
[1:28:26] where you come from and let the sun
[1:28:28] shine for four days brother let me tell
[1:28:30] you we're everywhere problems everywhere
[1:28:33] it was on every leaf on every Bush on
[1:28:35] ever I'm preaching now amen that was
[1:28:38] rain on every Bush it was on every leaf
[1:28:40] it was on every tree the evidence of
[1:28:43] that blizzard that snow it was
[1:28:45] everywhere but when he spoke to it he
[1:28:48] said go back and let the sun shine and
[1:28:50] let us be in the drive for four days

[1:28:54] and brother bam said there was a great
[1:28:56] win come Blowing by

[1:29:01] clouds went back where they came and the
[1:29:02] sun began to come out

[1:29:09] he said would you come walk with me
[1:29:14] it's pretty powerful I tell you what's
[1:29:16] amazing brother bam said it like this he
[1:29:18] said now when you hear a voice
[1:29:20] make sure it's scriptural
[1:29:22] like as if voices were talking to you
[1:29:24] every neighborhood Amos
[1:29:26] now when a voice talks to you make sure
[1:29:28] it's scriptural I said yes sir brother
[1:29:30] Bradham
[1:29:35] see what he done
[1:29:37] was when he spoke that storm away
[1:29:40] the one he was walking with
[1:29:43] he said come on walk the sunshine now
[1:29:45] y'all remember what he did Brother Brown
[1:29:46] said I went over there
[1:29:48] and he said I was standing there and he
[1:29:50] said I had my head put my gun against
[1:29:51] the tree and he said I had my head down
[1:29:53] and he said I kept hearing this patent
[1:29:57] he said I wondered what's that noise
[1:30:00] and he said I realized that it was my
[1:30:03] tears
[1:30:04] coming off of my beard falling on those
[1:30:06] dry leaves
[1:30:14] look
[1:30:16] it was gone
[1:30:18] the storm was gone the evidence was gone
[1:30:20] the aftermath was gone it was all gone
[1:30:25] because he was walking with omnipotence
[1:30:28] how many ever heard brother bisco tell
[1:30:30] the story of the brown bear
[1:30:32] he said they were missing that Vision
[1:30:33] the brown bear you remember it he said
[1:30:35] it rained for four days solid
[1:30:37] so Brother Bear never come out of his
[1:30:39] tent ring four days solid he said on the
[1:30:42] last day he said we we saddled
[1:30:43] everything in the wedding he said it was
[1:30:44] a mess out there packed everything up he
[1:30:47] said brother Brandon walked out and said
[1:30:48] where was that where was that bear at
[1:30:50] Eddie and he said he pointed him brother
[1:30:51] man walked up there said he'd come back
[1:30:53] in a minute and he said now I've been
[1:30:54] the Jonah here
[1:30:56] he said I should have went with you boys
[1:30:57] and got that bear he said I've been to
[1:30:59] Jonah he said but we will ride out of
[1:31:02] here dry
[1:31:06] brother Eddie says he said brother Wayne
[1:31:08] when you go buy them bushes it's been
[1:31:10] how many Ever Walked In the Woods it
[1:31:12] ain't if it ain't even raining
[1:31:14] you'll be sopping wet walking 100 yards
[1:31:17] in the woods because then bush is
[1:31:18] hitting you and all that
[1:31:21] he said there wasn't a raindrop
[1:31:24] the leaves was dry the bushes was dry
[1:31:27] the trees were dry been raining four
[1:31:30] days
[1:31:32] he said preacher what are you talking
[1:31:33] about I'm saying that it don't have to
[1:31:35] last always
[1:31:37] I'm saving trouble don't last always
[1:31:39] when you're walking with the omnipotent
[1:31:42] God he can cause the storm to leave and
[1:31:45] then in a moment dry the whole thing up
[1:31:47] and it's like that had never come a
[1:31:49] storm at all
[1:31:52] and come walk with me and brother takes
[1:31:54] off walking and while he's walking he
[1:31:56] said there it was he said all of a
[1:31:57] sudden you remember the story he said
[1:31:59] there I was walking in virgin Timber and
[1:32:01] never an ax laid that's virgin Timber
[1:32:03] never actually come on y'all know now
[1:32:06] y'all know where we are we just stepped
[1:32:09] into the Eden
[1:32:10] in the millennial world no no axes there
[1:32:13] nothing there used to preach what are
[1:32:14] you talking about what's the very next
[1:32:15] thing he said I look up and there stands
[1:32:17] three deer and they're not afraid of me
[1:32:20] and he talks to them and starts
[1:32:22] communicating with the animals they're
[1:32:24] not afraid he said they don't leave they
[1:32:25] come closer
[1:32:27] he had power over the animals he's
[1:32:29] walking in the sunshine the evidence of
[1:32:32] all of the trouble is gone he said I
[1:32:34] look he said and I was in every way a
[1:32:36] young man and then I turned and looked
[1:32:38] and there stood my Young Bride
[1:32:42] oh that's right I'm walking with him
[1:32:45] that's right I'm walking with him do you
[1:32:47] know this is not a fantasy I'm telling
[1:32:48] you these are not fables we're talking
[1:32:50] about these are realities when you walk
[1:32:52] with God things can change in a moment
[1:32:55] amen we're talking about the Rapture
[1:32:57] we're talking about the changing in the
[1:32:59] moment and the twinkling of an eye it
[1:33:02] can look like that there's no sun it can
[1:33:04] look like now to see it can look like
[1:33:06] that the world is falling apart and in
[1:33:09] one moment
[1:33:11] and in one moment it's stepping from one
[1:33:15] dimension to another don't you get
[1:33:17] discouraged don't you get your head down
[1:33:19] don't you let this devil stop you walk
[1:33:22] with God Shake It Off Church walk with
[1:33:25] God I tell you what I don't care where
[1:33:27] you're from I don't care what church you
[1:33:29] go to if you're a Believer this message
[1:33:31] I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ

[1:33:37] let everything go walk with God with all
[1:33:41] your heart walk with God
[1:33:43] thank you all right
[1:33:46] so brother I've been told this before
[1:33:48] but I can't walk with God
[1:33:50] I can't because we've had we've had
[1:33:52] trouble that's too much going on there's
[1:33:53] too much with me there's too much with
[1:33:54] problems with others and there's another
[1:33:56] greater story
[1:33:58] in the message than Georgie Carter
[1:34:01] kind of musicians come now
[1:34:03] there's not a greater story than Georgie
[1:34:04] Carter
[1:34:07] nine years
[1:34:10] nine years on the bed
[1:34:13] walk him with God
[1:34:15] every day in the scripture
[1:34:18] laying there in that condition
[1:34:20] and everybody around her saying there's
[1:34:22] no hope there'll never be change it can
[1:34:25] never happen
[1:34:27] she was reading about a miraculous God
[1:34:30] that was upon the Earth doing miracles
[1:34:34] brother Amos wasn't her fault she was in
[1:34:36] that condition y'all know why
[1:34:38] you all know her uncle raped her and
[1:34:40] gave her tuberculosis and they'd
[1:34:41] crippled her and put her in that
[1:34:42] condition and she was crippled
[1:34:45] and she would have stayed there
[1:34:47] but God sent a prophet
[1:34:50] he walked in that room brother Shawn he
[1:34:52] prophesied over and said get up from
[1:34:53] there in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:34:55] brother Brown said power came into her
[1:34:57] legs and she stood up on her feet first
[1:34:59] time in nine years he said preacher what
[1:35:01] are you talking about five minutes
[1:35:03] before the word came to her she couldn't
[1:35:04] walk
[1:35:07] five minutes before that Prophet
[1:35:08] prophesied she couldn't walk but the
[1:35:11] minute that the message spoke over her
[1:35:13] life
[1:35:20] brother Brown tells a story about a
[1:35:21] little girl over there in Finland right
[1:35:24] on the edge of Ukraine or Russia and
[1:35:26] Finland
[1:35:27] and he said there was a bunch of War

[1:35:41] but brother Ram said there was a little
[1:35:43] girl came a little finished grocery the
[1:35:45] War Orphan

[1:35:55] walking like this and she she was
[1:35:56] carrying that crutch she couldn't even
[1:35:57] take a step he said that the ushers was
[1:36:00] walking him in
[1:36:02] and he said they didn't want you know
[1:36:04] anybody getting close to him he said but
[1:36:06] she was standing off she was looking at
[1:36:07] him
[1:36:08] he said while she was sitting there
[1:36:10] looking at her he said I I knew she
[1:36:11] wanted to speak to me
[1:36:14] he said so I stopped and I said bring
[1:36:16] her here
