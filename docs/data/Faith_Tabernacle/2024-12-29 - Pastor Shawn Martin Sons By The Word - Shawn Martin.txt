Lord and uh so let the days Roll by and um one of these days we won't have to um amen um live in this Mortal bodies and amen we'll be forever with the Lord amen the musicians can be dismissed and

amen and if you have your Bibles we're just going to turn to the Book of Romans the 8th chapter and um I appreciate brother Tim uh farmer uh for ministering for us uh filling in uh Sunday I heard y'all had a good service and so we're thankful for that and um um it's always good when the people of God are blessed amen praise the Lord uh before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to the Lord precious father we're just an honor to be able to call you father and to recognize Lord your position our position Lord and the relationship that we have with you Lord that we're not Beggars we're not just strangers Lord but we're your children and Lord we're not just eating the crumbs off the table but we are sitting at the table and eating a seven course meal as your Prophet would call it and we're so thankful father to be invited Lord we don't want to push away Lord uh and and be unth thankful but we want to partake of your food that you provided for us today we would ask that your anointing would come among us and that you would feed us the Word of Life father I pray that you'd help me just get myself out of the way and anoint the gift that you placed Within Me Lord and speak through these mortal lips I pray father and I pray Lord that you would speak to the heart hearts of your people anoint their ears to hear and hearts to receive and understand father we just ask it and may you just have your Supreme Sovereign way this morning in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen amen Romans the 8th chapter and we're going to start at the 14th verse this is a very familiar scripture for us but it's um it's for us in this day um for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children or sons of God and if children then heirs and Heirs of God and joyin heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God amen amen you can have your seats the earnest expectation of the creature of creation waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God so that's a promise to us amen that the sons of God are going to be manifested and I truly believe that where we're living at today and um I guess if I would use a title it would be just called Sons by the word Sons by the word and often times we as ministers we um we talk about the purpose of God the the the plan of God and that's a I I guess we we talk about it a lot and and and the the reason why is because it's important to know what God is doing and what he is trying to achieve God doesn't save us and then just let us float around and choose our our own destiny and and he becomes our Aaron boy he becomes the um well the world would has traded him for Santa Claus and um and God's not that way but God has a purpose God has a plan and uh so we want to know what he is trying to achieve because God always works uh to fulfill uh his purpose and plan and Paul would call it the Eternal purpose of God God and so it's because of this the message of the hour that we're able to understand have a clear understanding of God's purpose not not just a history from a historical standpoint which because of the message we're able to see what God done Through the Ages but we are a group of people that are able to understand what he's doing today because that's the message deals with the purpose and plan of God but it's a personal revelation that his purpose and plan has to do with me with with you and and so then we're not just floating around it gives us something to fight the devil with when the devil says well you're just a nobody well we see ourselves in the purpose and plan of God and we've been told that nobody can take our place so whatever the devil wants to tell us we must not believe that now uh so because of the message we we understand what God has been after we understand who we are and if you don't understand who you are may God help you because Paul would pray uh uh H how did he put that that the spirit I pray that the spirit of wisdom and Revelation uh uh would come and open the eyes of your understanding the the the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know well I I truly believe that's what's happened in this day Paul's prayer has been fulfilled that that the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of Jesus Christ has has has enlightened our understanding and he's here to enlighten it more and and so we we we're understanding who we are we understand the time that we're living in we understand the role that we are to play in this great plan purpose the the great drama of God and so by by our understanding we realize that we are the finale we are the completion of the of God's plan and that's that's to me is uh uh really uh he saved the best for the last and and uh he must have had some confidence in us to be able to choose us for this day you know he didn't choose us for Luther he didn't choose us for any other age but he chose us for the finale and as brother Brandon would say they without us quoting what Paul would say what Paul said they without us us cannot be made perfect so all the pr previous ages they're waiting for us to finish this thing and so uh we're we're in the final stages we're not pushing for another age to come we are it and and so we we we we can't get laxed and we can't you know and and so you know as the prophet would tell us that this is the only time uh for the son of God to be manifested is this time no other time outside of this age has it been that the sons of God are to be made manifest so what is a Son of God well a Son of God is a seed of God and and um we would call it a word seed a Son of God is is a seed of God a word seed and um uh in the eth chapter of Luke Jesus talks of the sewer sewing seed and and in the 11th verse uh he tells us that the seed is the word of God Amen the seed is the word of God and and now we know that the word was spoken before the foundation of the world and and people that don't understand predestination or doesn't believe in these things you you can't understand the plan of God and never can be secure in the plan of God and the purpose of God but God is not planning as we go the plan has already been set it's already been established your destination has already been fixed if we could say it that way and and so Ephesians 1 and one Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God not by man but by the will of God to the Saints which are in Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world and and why would he chooses is that we should be holy and Without Blame so he had a purpose and choosing you in Jesus Christ before the foundation of the world you have no accuser against you because he chose us that we might that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children or Sons by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will so we have been predestinated so if you have been predestined destinated before the foundation of the world then you are a word seed amen that's what sons of God are is word seeds and so uh uh remember every seed uh has a law uh within it um or is under a law and that is to bring forth of its kind you plant a seed uh uh of wheat you wheat seed then then you expect to get a wheat crop a wheat Harvest uh you you plant a a cucumber seed you'll get cucumber if you plant an orange seed you'll get orange amen tomato uh so so it's a it's a law to every seed that every seed is to bring forth of its kind ain't that right so when you look at Christ uh Jesus was the son of God he was a word seed because he was predestinated amen he just didn't come into this world just trying to find his way and trying to find something to do for God he was predestinated his life was ordered of God the Bible says the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord ain't that right and so he was the seed of the woman that God promised would bruise the Serpent's head he was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world he was the prophet that Moses said would come he was the great high priest that the natural high priest typed out ain't that right he was predestinated to rise on the third day so so even his his death Burl and Resurrection all that was already predestinated it was already fixed that's where Jesus did not have to wonder about his future but he would actually tell them destroy this Temple and in 3 days I will will raise it up again amen because he knew who he was he knew he was that word seed ain't that right so he knew he was predestinated to be and to do those things he was he knew he was predestinated to be the lamb he knew he was predestinated to be the sacrifice he knew he was predestinated and notice what the prophet said that's the way he knew the word man when I read that that just struck my heart I thought wow that's the way he knew the word there there you know there there's so many people that that read this Bible and you know year after year they read it you know maybe one time and uh through uh uh the year and and then they'll read it over and some read it you know twice a year all the way through amen but I wonder how they know the word you know is it an intellectual is it is it something that that that come from uh their own idea of what they think the word means or some uh uh uh uh preacher teacher or philosopher but the way Jesus knew the word was different he knew that these promises applied to him he knew that prophecy applied to him that's the way he knew the word and and so he he he read the word and knew that it spoke of him he when he read the word it he could identify himself in that word he was that word seed can you say amen that's the way he knew the word that's the way we should know the word is when we look at the word we see it for us that it applies to us ain't that right that's the way we should know it Jesus even told his critics search the scriptures for they test testify of me the scriptures he knew that the scriptures testified of him they foretold of his life they for told of of the events of his life ain't that right see and so then then when we read the Bible then we want to know the word just that way see we too have been predestinated which means that we are a word seed Romans 8:29 for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called he also glorified whom he justified them he also glorified ain't that right so so all through the Bible it it testifies of us when you read the the the Rahab the Harlot is it just a story or how do you know that story how do you read that story because you should see yourself there you should see the grace of God that God would show her mercy and that was just a type to let us know that the mercy of God is for us amen uh uh Rahab the Harlot the story of Ruth see amen and and when you read these then you should look at it and know that it's for telling of you it's not just for telling of a people it's for telling of me that's my story God would tell my story through the story of Ruth and the Rahab the Harlot and you read the prophecies in the Bible and and see if it doesn't forell of us in this last day ain't that right see the scriptures testify of us sons of God the scriptures testify of us we're so we're a word seed it's it's it's already been declared who we are it's already been declared our our our our Future's already been declared our present has already been declared and and and to think of it we are the finale of this thing so all those have longed for this day they've longed to see these promises fulfilled and we are the people that are fulfilling them so we are predestinated as Jesus Christ was which makes the word seed flesh in us so it's time for the manifestation of the sons of God do you believe that we're living in the time of the manifestation of sons of God not the time of Sinners and I and I get it you know the world is becoming more wicked and more evil uh uh when you when you just think well how worse can man get it gets worse and then you think wow that's that's bad it can't get any worse and then it gets worse and and so so wickedness is manifesting itself the the wicked has become manifested but it's in this time that the sons of God are to be manifested as well now the word seed couldn't come to maturity back in the beginning or throughout because of being hybrid Adam was the first Son of God you believe that he was the first Son of God and so he was the example of what God wanted his sons to be see sons of God are to have power they're to have authority they they they are to speak and things happen at their word sons of God are they're to rule and have dominion they they are to walk with God and have fellowship with him they are to walk in harmony with God that's what sons of God are not not to fight with God and contradict God and and disbelieve God but but but to come to a place of harmony with God agreement with God power with God Authority with God that's that's sons of God so so and and Harmony exists when man believes God's word so the the manifestation of the sons of God brother Bram talks about it in the adoption series I believe that's what it was but but he says when true men or true Sons born Sons filled Sons speak and their word is backed not backed by some political government backed by God himself when that when we speak and I believe that's happening even now that when when we speak there's a power behind it that's beyond our ability it's God backing it up brother Bram said see say to this mountain let it be so brother I desire so and so a certain thing done I'm a Believer in Jesus Christ well I give it to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ see amen there's a manifestation see oh brother my crops are burning up out yonder I haven't had any rain well I'll send you rain in the name of the Lord God bless your crop all waiting groaning all nature waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God God ordained it at the beginning Adam had that Dominion he had that rule he had that Authority that's what God ordained his sons to be at the beginning he said he gave man that domain ain't that right well then then then you look in Genesis 1:27 it says so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him Mel and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it ain't that right so but how was this multiplication to happen Adam being a Son of God was to reproduce sons of God that he was supposed to multiply himself how was he going to do that by the spoken word see Adam was a spoken word of God which which is the Original Seed of God ain't that right brother brand even preached the sermon you know uh the spoken word is the Original Seed see and so Adam being that spoken word of God see and then he was to multiply multiply and replenish multiply himself but the prophet said the word couldn't find a resting place the word that was supposed to be uh uh uh multiply and replenish it couldn't find a resting place for Eve played the the part of a the prophet would say by doubting everybody say by doubting the word of God the prophet said now Satan's Satan hit Eve's mind in the womb of her mind she doubted God's word then come the actual act so first Satan hit Eve's mind ain't that right what how did he do it he took God's word and reasoned it with Eve he reasoned it he he got Eve to reasoning he started questioning the word he started amen putting question marks on it and and and so brother brah said see Eve was a good woman but she didn't follow the Commandment to the word just reasoned a little with it ain't that right he said she didn't just outright disbelieve the word she just reasoned with something contrary to it see so so she just didn't say well God's a flat liar and and and I don't even believe in God and you know let's just all go to the bar and and get some whiskey or something like that no she's sitting in the Pew we could say it that way and and yet she's reasoning God's word instead of just saying God's word is true get away from me I'm going to listen to you she began to listen to that reasoning brother Bram says anything that reasons against the word remember that's the enemy anything that reasons against the word that's the enemy don't you listen to it at all it's got to be the word can you say Amen so notice the actual act came after Eve disbelieved the word of God in the womb of her mind so the prophet said see it was a spiritual intercourse first it was a spiritual intercourse that came by believing Satan's lie and receiving that lie in the womb of her mind and it polluted her soul it set death in the soul then the natural act took place ain't that right so the result of her action was not only a physical death but a spiritual death it it caused both spiritual and physical death and and the prophet said that means that both body and spirit of the wicked is going to be annihilated both both body and spirit is going to be annihilated see and and and so then if you think of it if if Eve had to receive Satan's lie in the womb of her mind before something could take place then that would only tell us that we have to first receive God's word in the womb of our mind before something will take place can you say Amen brother brandham said see uh he said the only way that we can ever be born again is first in the womb of the Mind receive the word you don't have to get down and big you don't have to get down and beat the altar you don't have to T like they did on the on the day of Pentecost to receive the Holy Ghost they had to do that because the the day of pent they had to wait for the day of Pentecost all the types had to be fulfilled but you don't have to T all you have to do is receive the word in the room of your mind and then the spirit comes on top of that and brings it to life can you say Amen see this is exactly how Jesus was conceived amen see his conception was not by a sex act it was by the spoken word of God how many believes that amen a virgin conceived by the spoken word of God see and and and if you notice the the Bible if you just looking at this what Jesus was in the beginning the Bible says that God made man after his own image I'm just talking on what the sons of God are God made man at in his own image after his kind the prophet said so what is God John 1 one in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God can you say that with me the Word was God the Word was God ain't that right and he made man after his kind see which would be the word the prophet said made man after his kind the word amen see so he said God made Man In His Image after his kind to express his word on the earth amen that's sons of God Amen that that would be made after his image after his kind to express the word uh or his word on the earth so he expressed it in Jesus Christ for God was in Christ God the word was in Jesus Christ do you believe that so the prophet said see that's a man after his kind when God which is the word was in Jesus Christ a man a human being amen the word expressed itself in him ain't that right see he say so if you look back and see what he was when he was made flesh that's the kind of man he makes ain't that right that's the kind of man he makes yes sir see that's the kind of man another place he says that's the kind of man that God makes today is is a man that expresses the word of God on the earth amen see so that's what the manifestation of sons is is the word being expressed ain't that right so if a if a man denies the word the prophet said then that man is not made in the image of God he's not made after his kind if he's not if he's sitting there denying the word and yet God wants us to express his word how can you express it when we deny it so we must not deny it a ain't that right see so he says how can you be in God's image and deny God's word when the word is expressed image of himself so he says when God calls a man he's in his own image the word Made Alive in him God calling a man God calling a woman God calling children amen why did he call him that the word could be made alive in them ain't that right see he says that's right see there he is that's God's man man in his own image in his very likeness and Jesus being the express word said that he'll do the works that I do ain't that right who's going to do them works the sons of God that the word can flow through you know we many times people settle down just to shouting and they call that good times and we believe in shouting they they settled down to to you know fast music or or you know dancing or speaking in tongues or gifts or being operated we and we believe in all of that but but that doesn't make us sons of God it's when the whole word is being expressed through us can you say amen that's the Son of God now in the Old Testament David said Thy word have I hid in my heart that I sin not against thee so he's he's saying that David's saying that and we know that that the spirit of God came up on him he had a portion but notice what what D what brother Braham said about that Thy word have I hid in my heart that I sin not against thee he said the only thing David needed was the rain and he said David would have been all right if he could just had that rain but the Holy Ghost wasn't given yet he had the word and the Word was in him and he could know it he knew it see he said I've hid it in My Heart Lord but it it won't bloom out and act like it should but I've hid it there Lord I've HD it there but when Jesus come which was the word made manifest took the germ of life out of it and brings it back to the word now so we're not like David hiding the word in our heart knowing that word and and and and and and yet it's not blooming out can you say Amen we're talking about manifestation of sons of God so here Jesus Christ being the seed word an expressed word of God upon the Earth well what was he Colossians 1:15 uh I believe Paul says he is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature brother brandham said he is the visible image of the invisible God he was the visible image of the invisible God ain't that right Hebrews 1:3 says he is the expressed image of his person he was the very Express image couldn't get any any more clearer than that so much so that he you you all know the scripture where Philip says you know he show us the father it was a is and Jesus says have I not been have I been so long with you and you still don't know me he that has seen me has seen the father he was the express image not two people in the godhead one God in a human body can you say Amen so so therefore God is the word so Jesus Christ was God's expressed word expressed image expressed word ain't that right so brother Bram says now what are we to be sons of God everybody say sons of God what are we to be sons of God too with the expressed word in the church carrying on ain't that right that's the mystical Body of Christ carrying on the same works that Jesus did when he was here on Earth Earth that's the kind after his kind now you can have the Lutheran kind after the Lutheran the Methodist kind after the Methodist the Catholic kind after the Catholic the Pentecostal kind after its kind the Oneness after its kind the Trinity after its kind but if you're God's kind that's different you're the expressed image of the word making itself manifest ain't that right so that I hope not confusing you too much but second Corinthians 3:18 it says but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image we beholding the glory of the Lord are changed into that same image from Glory to Glory even as by the spirit of the Lord so if you go back to Adam Adam God intended for Adam to bring forth sons of God and he forfeited his rights to do so he forfeit his rights to this amen the prophet said when he send the holy image of God left them and so God raised up another Adam we would call him the second Adam we' call him the last Adam but God raised up another Adam that would bring forth what God wanted and that is sons of God Amen so so this Adam would have to do the work of redemption ain't that right so so the the first Adam was created by the spoken word The Original Seed then then Christ the second Adam could only be come forth by the spoken word The Original Seed ain't that right so brother brand said see the first son was spoken was spoken seed word of God the Second Son a spoken seed word of God see anytime that God has Sons they are going to become forth by the spoken word seed of God a ain't that right see so so the second Adam was created in the womb of a woman ain't that right but notice how did that happen how did this creation come brother Brandon would say Mary's womb the physical mind was virgin womb why she believed God's word evees mind was not virgin because she had allowed Satan to come in and pollute her but Mary her mind was virgin she just simply believed God's word she didn't try to mix God's word up she didn't try to take something for substitute she just simply believed it that's right ain't that right so she believed God's word no matter how much anybody criticized and how many things somebody else said that didn't have one thing to do with it she believed God's word regardless aren't you glad for that she just believed God's word regardless see so now when we talk about the mind we're not talking intellectual see we're not talking about intellectual mind brother Ram said it's the womb of your heart see so so the Bible says as a man thinketh in in his heart so is he as a man thinketh in his heart so it's not the intellectual side of it it's in the heart so so Medical Science the prophet said found that in the center of the human heart is a teeny little place that don't have blood cells or anything around it and they claim is the occupation of the Soul see so he says from the heart comes forth the thought his soul not from his mind but from his soul something that tells that it's right and if it's contrary to the word something tells him it's wrong see it's right down here in the soul can you say man so before the the the the ACT could ever take uh took place in the literal womb of Mary the ACT had to take place down in her her mind or in that soul that she would believe God's word count it as though it already happened God's word found a resting place it could not find it in Eve but it found it in in in in Mary and it brought forth the Son of God the Son of God the second Adam can you say Amen see so so before before the act ever took place in the literal womb of Mary the ACT had to take place in her mind first of all to let the Spirit come in to do the rest of the work she believed it she didn't have to try to figure it out she didn't have to try to make it happen she didn't have to go around wandering and and seeing if what who else would believe her and and and and find some doctor that would agree with it she just believed it and let the spirit do the rest of it and that's the way you got to do it you just got to believe it I don't care what it looks like I don't care how impossible just believe the word and let the spirit of God do the rest so so here was Mary the word found that resting place she said behold the the hands maiden of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word she did what Eve should have done and the birth of every Son of God has to be that way you believe it yeah you got to be born Sons got to be born sons in John 3:3 Jesus said to Nicodemus verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God we call it the new birth ain't that right and you look up the word birth it means creation so a birth is is literally a it's a creation so New Birth New Creation New Birth brings about New Creation second Corinthians 5:17 therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature a new creation he's had a new birth old things are passed way behold all things are become new can you say Amen so then Adam Adam forfeited his rights amen and could not bring forth all he brought forth is Sons of Adam sons of Adam ain't that right amen uh of the adamic race and we're all born Sinners we're all born uh with a carnal nature doomed for hell if it had not been for the grace of God but God was determined that there would be sons of God upon the Earth that he could express himself through we never got that being born from a natural aspect we were defeated we were born defeated born with complexes born with illnesses born with whatever and you say Amen but why must we be born again is because our first birth came by a natural natural act through holy the prophet said through holy wedlock your mother and father had to do with you coming on the earth then he calls it an act of carnal knowledge ain't that right and through there again we were conceived in sin shaping in iniquity come to the world speaking lies and God did never intended the perfect will of God now speaking God never intended for his sons to come that way into this world and he hasn't changed his mind about it ain't that right that's why Satan's doing everything he can to keep people away from a new birth get him to join a church get them to site a Creed get them to just become religious but sons of God have to be born born sons and you're not born Sons just because you come from a Christian family you're not born children of God just because daddy was a preacher or a deacon or singer or whatever it's a new birth can you say Amen a new birth every Son of God has to be born by the creative spoken word of God how many believes that you got to be born by the spoken word word the creative word of God first Peter 1:23 being born again not of corruptible seed that by carnal knowledge see but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever ain't that right see so so why God God sent the second Adam To Be Our Redeemer to send his Spirit back upon us why to bring forth manifestation God's after manifestation of sons of God ain't that right after manifestation see so now you know this might be simple but the new birth does not require us to go back into our mother's womb remember oh Nicodemus when Jesus said a man must be born again you know there John 3:4 he said well how can a man be born when he's old can he enter into the second time into his mother's womb and be born but that's not the birth Jesus is talking about he's talking about a spiritual birth that has to happen ain't that right well what does that mean that means that predestinated word seed must be quickened there is a word seed down in the side of us every elect of God every predestinated of God that's the real you brother Bill and it must be Quicken so there can be no manifestation of sons of God without the word birth can you say Amen so brother Braham said as the Eternal logos God was manifest in the Sun and in in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that Eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gained the title of son even so we Eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed manifest in flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of God even as we are so called we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened for in nonseed there is nothing to Quicken so not everyone can be born again ain't that right amen see so if you notice before before the spiritual birth can take place what had to happen the word had to find a resting place in our mind in our heart where we just believed it ain't that right amen uh John 5 5 24 Jesus said verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation or brother brand said Great Tribulation see but is passed from Death un life ain't that right so a man has to be or has to have a virgin mind a virgin mind to believe God's word what what what caused Mary to believe I think this is important now brother Bram said her mother through her lips planted a seed in Mary's heart other words she she prepared Mary's heart to receive it kept all that doubt away from her and M Mary's mother through her lips planted a seed in Mary's heart and she saw it in the word of God Isaiah 9:6 Behold a virgin shall conceive see how important that is that we would we don't try to dissect this message we don't try to even if you don't understand it it if if it's if God said it it's got to be true prepare the hearts can you say Amen see see then the word took flesh the word became flesh see so so you know uh uh brother Bram would say you know Eve received the devil's lie in the womb of her mind and brought death Mary received the word of God in the womb of her mind and brought forth eternal life ain't that right two different women or we could say two different churches am two two different all together one receives the the devil's lie in the womb of her her soul her mind and she doubts it and brings forth death the other brings forth or receives the word of God in the womb and brings forth eternal life now notice uh first thessal ionians 2:13 Paul would say for this cause also thank we god without ceasing because when we when you receive the word of God which you heard of us you received it not as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of God notice which effectively worketh also in you that belief you see the difference some just don't have the word of God working in them others have the word of God simply because one receives it as being the word of Truth and they believe it and the word becomes effective just like it did in Mary can you say Amen see so brother Brown said see the word takes flesh there you are God is going to have a church do you believe that God God is going to have a church I say he has a church we're part of that church but notice it's going to be born of the word of God because it is the Living Word of God can you say Amen see so the word is taken form by somebody believing it the word is finding a resting place in the hearts of a people here on this Earth Earth he said how you know it you know what you're going to be called from this on he said you're just going to be called he goes I don't care what I'm called that has nothing about it be it unto me according to the word of the Lord oh could everybody say that today see if people could really from your heart all of us could say that be it unto me according to Thy word Lord see my really mean it see one or two or somewhere out in the there it's going to pick up some predestinated that really means that can you say amen amen mean that from your heart see he says and brother you're going to see the sparks flying right then that's right when you really got that there to meet that what's coming that irrigation begins to fall on that word amen I I again I I pray that you can see the importance of God sending a prophet to us see God would send us a prophet uh because there would be a people that would so dearly appreciate it and they needed it we we needed it see and he would send it at the time that the sons of God were to be manifested see and and so it it's a blessing to us to be able to hear and not only to hear the words of a prophet and to read the the the books and things like that but the the most privilege is to be able to receive the message that he brought and brother bradam Mari told us that we're not like Eve you know uh but but this bride ain't going to do like Eve did right but she's going to accept that word she she's she's she's virgin see only to him only to him see so now God would have and Prophet see because there's no denomination there's no denomination that could bring forth a word birth remember denomination is part of the Harlot system she's the Harlot uh she's the daughter to the mother and uh you know the Bible says the prophet speaks about it there in Revelations 13 you know that it's that she makes an image to the Beast which you know is the c Catholic church and and it's the you know it's the confederation of churches and and all these things and she had a cup in her hand giving out her Doctrine to the people the prophet says and which was an Abomination the filthiness of her fornication ain't that right so this is what the Bible says about this Harlot system she's got a she's got a cup of wine and and she's she's giv it out to the people which brother Bram said that's her Doctrine you see and fornication means unclean living so she's a harlot she's a horde she's she just defiled and and Revelation 17:2 would tell us that the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her see and and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication and the prophet said what that is is the church has opened her mind and has received all kinds of Creeds and all kinds of dogmas and not the word of God so back to Eve again she opened her mind up to Satan's lie and received it and the word could not find a resting place and and therefore the sons of God could not be manifested uh in in that time and and We Know It the purpose was and so but here's the church again that is is denomination and and and even brother brand even applied that to non- denominations a lot of your organiz non- organizations or denominations are all in the same boat they're they're teaching the uh the the they've received of her wine a fornication see and brother brand said she calls herself the bride of Christ but but the material that she's made up of is organization and not of the word ain't that right see sons of God the the material they're made up of is word is the word see so he she has enough word in it to make her a byproduct or hypocritical see so so therefore the son of man could not be revealed in there son of man could not be revealed in in in in denominations and and all of that see see because the the the the word when the son of man is the word being made manifest the son of man see being God becomes material as the word is made manifest God becomes material how many believes that as the word becomes manifest stay with that word no wonder the prophet said stay with the word return to the word as the word of God is made manifest God himself becomes material see so then the manifestation of the sons of God is actually the word being expressed which is God becoming material God becoming material that's why the prophet would tell us deity is not in heaven deity is in you God becoming material it's such a relationship with God sons of God coming back to what God intended for them can you say Amen so it would take a prophet to bring forth a word birth in this age amen see because the prophet said this the word is going to produce Sons and Daughters of God not programs not going back in memory and having you know Christmas plays Easter Plays and all that nothing against that and and just but that has nothing to do with producing Sons the word is going to produce Sons and Daughters of God ain't that right so then for that to happen is God only promised to send this one prophet Malachi 4 one major prophet and that would be the Prophet Elijah right spoke of in Malachi 4 what was he to do he was to turn our hearts back to the Living Word of the Living God and this prophet of Malachi 4 as we know if you believe the message and know the message it's he's he's the same as what John saw being the seven Angel Malachi wrote of a prophet coming Elijah the prophet John sees that same prophet and said he's the seventh angel we didn't know that until the message and tied it together for us we would have thought been two different people two different Ministries and we find out it's all in the same Ministry ain't that right so Revelations 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished in other words it should be revealed the word would return ain't that right as he had declared to his servants the prophets and then the prophet would tell us that the seventh angel is on Earth at the same time of the coming of the mighty angel of Revelations 10:1 right when that Mighty Angel which is Christ The Covenant amen uh uh Angel Christ came down with an open book in his hand if you remember in in Revelations the fth chapter the lamb comes forth takes the book of redemption that is sealed with Seven Seals from the hand of him who sat on the throne and he breaks the seals then you find that in Revelations 10:1 the mighty angel coming with an open book not closed coming down and the prophet said see he took the book Glory opened the book tore off the seals and sent it down to the Earth to a seventh angel to reveal it to his people he says there you are oh my what happened the screams the shouts the Hallelujah the anointed the power the glory the manifestation one place brother Brown said we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation everybody say it with me the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine vindication can you say Amen so we don't have to wait for another Prophet to come we're not looking for an eighth Messenger to come what we have is the word that is is is pure to produce Sons and Daughters of God to bring a manifestation of sons there could be no manifestation of sons had not the Prophet come with a perfect word people want to dissect that word I I'll be the first to tell you I don't understand everything brother Brenham said there's things that seems to be contradictory but I do know that God Vindicated it I do know it's been so Vindicated that it's taken all the questions away and I just believe what he said some things you you might ask me to explain I may not be able to explain it but I just know it's got to be right someone where it's got to fit because it's been supernaturally it's been scientifically it's been scripturally Vindicated can you say Amen see so the perfect interpretation of the word has been restored to us now watch the message the prophet said is to bring back the word bring the people back to the word birth is to be she's to be delivered of a new birth from According to Malachi 4 can you say Amen so he says in all these years of denominations finally finally God has bred his church back to the Holy Ghost again I'm so glad to be in it let the old seeds and carnality die out become a new creature in Christ Jesus we're sitting together today in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus the Holy Spirit breeding out he said I'm so glad of that breeding out all doubts breeding out isms breeding in himself sons of God not breeding back mules and Crossing it up but breeding Sons and Daughters of God that don't look at the word and stick out their ear ears and say well my mother was Presbyterian well that's all right but we need first to make us Sons and Daughters of God reading out the unbelief and the Creeds and things and bringing us back to the original sons of God by the Holy Ghost that's exactly that's what the church is in the process of doing today I say she's here I just believe it I I I I just believe that sons of God brother Braham said as God in his word made manifest in a man man a perfect man so is God and His word coming again and making himself manifested in a bride not will do like Eve did hybrid it to something else but the unadulterated word of God will be born into that church and she'll stand like Jesus Christ did a Son of God with his Spirit anointing in his word can you say Amen so in one place brother Brown said don't you ever let somebody squeeze something into you that's not thus sayith the Lord another place he says now Christ is now taken himself a bride to be pregnated with his own seed word in her womb Spirit womb in her mind and won't mix with any the denominational trust with it she is Virgin to him ain't that right you see Sons I am a son of Duran and and jerlene Martin I was born I am of their seed right and that's what makes me a Martin there two agreements brother BR would say it this way their two agreements with their sperm Together made a seed and that's what made me your parents that's what made you is you're of their their seed now notice now so that that would have to be what a Son of God is it's not just speak I'm a Son of God and you're just speaking it like that you you got to literally become this it's literally sons of God Daughters of God so brother Bram says see when God and His word becomes one see when God God's spirit Waters the seed of God the word of God it produces God see where we're at the manifestation of sons of God we're we're we we've come to a place where it's producing God in flesh God becoming material see he says it's not the individual it's God for you are dead you're you're not yourself no more you you you reckon Yourself Dead hallowed out waiting for the seed germ then what is it it isn't you no more isn't the man it's God in the man it's the seed germ like the beginning spoken word it's God's word made manifest in the man then it isn't the man it's a man that's died he can't be a hybrid and a son at the same time he's either a son of death or son of life if he's the son of death give over to God and let him kill the devil that's in you run him out see Hallows you out then let God plant his own life in you then it's not you no more it's God's life because it's God's word watered by the holy spirit will produce the same thing you love him see so we no longer live by our natural birth you you might have developed Habits by your natural birth you you might have developed uh uh the genes of of of head what uh hereditary uh things that come through that blood line but but brother Bram says you know when and and just paraphrase it now but something to the effect when you receive the Holy Ghost then your sexual blood is dismissed see when that Holy life when God's life comes in you then then that sexual life is dismissed then you're not born defeated you're not born a a vagabond you're you're no longer acting like one and talking like one and talk and defeat and all that you are a son of God no longer do you just knck down to the devil and you just become a slave to everything he offers you people so afraid to confess things uh uh uh the promises of God because they think well I'm just a failure I'm just this I'm just that but if you've got the life of God in you you are a son of God and you live by that and the only way you live by it is by the word you live by the word by believing it can you say Amen so so so can it be can it be this way you know well again it can be it it can to where the same Christ of yesterday can be the same Christ of today and and and Christ did not leave when brother brandham left this Earth I I just don't believe that I I I thank God for what God done in brother brandom I thank God for the stories I I I love to hear them stories I'll never get tired of hearing what happened what God done in that Ministry but I'm not sitting here painting a god of yesterday trying to get warmed by that God I realize that God sent a message to bring me a word birth breathe out all that unbelief breathe out all of that traditional teaching breathe out all of these things to where I can just stay with what God Said God said it I believe it you believe that so the word that God spoke be fruitful and multiply it it it couldn't find a resting place in the beginning but then that word caught into the womb of a virgin and the second adom came forth and notice from him came forth The Germ life that the thing that gives see the water that gives the kernel is chance to reproduce itself the Spirit came out of him and went up and here we are we come along and what happens we believe it we believe it ain't that right so so in John 14:12 Jesus said he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than the shall he do now you just pardon me but there's a teaching and I just I just think it's a sign of unbelief but where the teaching is that that is only applying to brother brandham and I was told that that that that only applies to brother brandham he that believeth on me the works shall he do that was brother br and I thought I don't think so so I went and looked it up and brother Bram said that's the believer that's the believer well that's me that's the Believers in this building the works that he did you not can you shall do you shall do can you say Amen you shall do so how did Jesus do the works he was predestinated by the forn knowledge of God according to the plan of God God was going to send a redeemer God promised it and this Redeemer could only be his own son God promised this all the way from the Garden of Eden all the way through amen that Jesus would be here then he comes a man born of a virgin ain't that right God had made himself a man the word God the word was made flesh then but notice then the prophet said but it taken the spirit of God to Quicken that word to him and he was the word Quicken the word quickened for that hour the time had come when you had to have a redeemer the law had failed other things failed now it takes a redeemer and he was that promised Redeemer he was quickened by the word of God do you believe it Jesus Jesus even said there in Luke 4 the spirit of the Lord is upon me Heath anointed me to preach the gospel he has anointed me you know all these things I mean he was anointed see that word seed quickened amen and the prophet said God spoken word through a virgin brought forth a body and in that body came the water the spirit see and Washed by the Water of the word and then went in him dwelt in him and there come the life of God manifesting himself through Christ God was in Christ the anointed one Christ means the anointed one a man that was anointed ain't that right so the spirit being the water came and watered or quickened that word seed amen and and and and it became the word of God made manifest God's word made manifest and the prophet said he came to represent us before God as Sons and Daughters of God think of that not as as Sinners and not as as no goods and and just people full of M he came to represent us before God as Sons and Daughters of God see he says and and he sent his holy spirit now he's brooding over the place trying to bring us back to birth see die to ourselves and be reborn again to be Sons and Daughters of God to take God at his word to believe God's word Oh my he says now in another place says he died in order to pay the debt of your high breeding there it is what is it that you could die to yourself until you're no more yourself get rid of all your doubts your unbelief your excuses get just get it all out of the way and stand there and just totally believe God regardless you may not have to explain it you may not can explain it you don't have to explain it everything you just believe it just believe it see and you don't have to worry about what everybody else is doing well I'd be in Revival if everybody else would get their act together you can be in Revival it doesn't matter well I I could sure serve God I'd really worship if everybody else get into it but that church is dead well what about you it's you and God can you say Amen you've got to climb you've got to press you've got to it's you and God coming into worship doesn't matter what everybody else does I'm going to worship doesn't matter what everybody else does I'm just going to say Amen to it I'm going to believe it see it's it's we're coming to Sons sons of God so he said see you got to die to yourself till you know more yourself and be filled with his word believing his word how are you filled with his word believing his word just believe it see and then the Holy Spirit was in him comes down to water that word and to make it grow see you believe it God does the rest of it you know you say well I I know I know I know all about healing but I'm so hurting right now I just don't know well see you can't reason you you just got to say well God I just thank you I thank you for healing well then everybody else gets healed around you and then the devil tells you they see it's not for you don't give into that reasoning let the word find a resting place and let the spirit do the rest he'll do it that's the same way with the Holy Ghost that's the same way with every promise of God so today we have come to the same thing thing again as Christ and that is the manifestation of sons it's the only time that the same Ministry of Jesus Christ has come back is in this is in this time appreciate the ministry of All Through the Ages but here has come to the revealing of the son of man what is it the prophet asked it's God manifesting continuing the work of his first son his only begotten see that died for our high breeding life that he might reconcile us back to be Sons and Daughters of God that through the church might flow the same life by the word by the word continuing the work being manifested as it was in Christ Christ was God's word made manifest he died he gave his life that he might send the spirit take his body up send the spirit back to water to water say pay the redeeming price if we'll believe it that's that's it right there if you believe it he that believeth on me the works that I do see then come the Holy Spirit upon the same word of God why the same word that prophesied his life is the same word that prophesied your life it prophesied a Rapture for you it prophesied a body change for you it prophesied an adoption for you it's all in scriptures somebody just got to just believe it let the word find a resting place if you remember we're being changed remember he said we're being changed from glory to glory that's right this is what it's been he said brother brand says just like a seed of a morning glory the seed of a flower it falls into the ground the seed of corn falls in the ground what's the first thing it comes up and it's a little Sprout then it goes to a tossel then from a tossel it goes back to its original grain that's exactly what the church has done it come from Luther Wesley and now back to the original grain back to its original Glory back to the glory it was at the beginning the Sun that Rose in the East it's the same Sun that's manifesting the same thing in the west changing from glory to glory it changed from the Pagan down into Luther from Luther into Wesley from Wesley into Pentecost and on and on changing from glory to glory producing the hidden mana and now everybody say now it's ripe now it's right to bring him back exactly like he was at the beginning he same Ministry the same Jesus the Same power the same Holy Ghost the same one that come down on the day of Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost that's manifested today from Glory un glory to glory and is back to its original seed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost the same sign same Wonder same baptism same kind of people act in the same way with the same power the same sensation it's from Glory unto glory and the next will be changed from this Glory into a body like un to his own glorious body and we shall see him you love him where are we today as sons of God I hope it's helped you in some way today maybe you've already known all this and but it's good to be reminded but I can tell you this I believe that everything has pulled away from the from the shook every last part of shuck has pulled away from this bride it's been a hard Road it's been times of where you're having to stand on your own you're having to and and people not understanding people Mis Mis interpreting people whatever but we we are in a place that people have left the message don't understand us whatever and it's left us to where we're just standing there as what the prophet called ripening in the presence of the Sun ripening I don't know how many more people will walk away from this message I don't know but I tell you what what makes you really odd what makes us really odd and I'm not just talking about the church I'm just talking about Believers all around the world is when you simply take what a prophet said and just believe it regardless just regardless it's not up to us to have an explanation or an answer to every question Jesus did not even give answers to his critics if he did it would be such a parable that would totally confuse them and blind them even more but we're looking at the world system we're looking at everything that's going on Russia is flexing its muscles it's challenged the United States to a missile War missile Showdown you you you do yours and we'll do ours and see who wins you see where we're at everybody talking about World War II everybody talking about things why we're at the end now they don't know they're at the end I think really I think Russia just will wipe America out and we'll just continue on but see we know we're at the end we we see where we're at time is no more everything is falling apart everything but in this time is a little group of people and I say little when you consider the billions of people on this Earth you know one one Minister put on a Minister's chat and he said what if what if there's only 10,000 message true message believer teachers preachers 10,000 in the whole world and he gives this this of all the people that are up the Earth and maybe just 10,000 which likely could only be just 10,000 preachers I don't know of this message and he said it'd be like we're just 0.000000 whatever I mean we are a very minority That's how little this bride's going to be we we we're very small when you really think of the number of people that's up on the Earth today of people that are truly believ in this message but see the message didn't come for this world the message came for you to bring forth Sons and Daughters of God that you may stand in this age not as a sinner not as a vagabond and condemnation and judgment upon you he died to pay the debt of our high breeding to bring us back to what God originally intended and church we're here don't underestimate yourself believe this message with all that's within you believe it don't argue with it you come against some or reading up up up against something that that you read you hear brother bradam say and you're like man I don't know I don't understand all this stuff don't try just leave it alone just say I believe it I believe it regardless God knows what he's doing but and and I'm not saying that word being like maybe a following followers of like Jim Jones and David Kesh and all that that just goes blindly into whatever but you've got you've got Vindication this message has been so Vindicated that it should take away all question all unbelief every doubt from our minds can you say Amen you have the musicians will come I love the Lord and I'm so glad to be part of this this age I wished I could just so explain it and paint the picture to you the way I feel it but God will do it for us amen but I know that we're standing here as sons of God and it's in this age that question you remember the stone coming down and that headstone Grace Grace and then the question was who are thou oh Mountain who art thou oh [Music] mountain and declared that it would fall and I just believe that if it's a mountain of unbelief if it's a mountain of denomination Creeds and traditional thoughts and whatever whatever Mountain I just put it that way whatever Mountain is standing before you that mountain has been decreed to fall at your feet in this age amen and I'm so glad for that amen I'm so glad for that amen what song can we sing it now be it unto me according to your word according to your promises I can stand [Music] secure right upon my [Music] heart the truth that sets me free according to your word Lord not according to what I think but according to your word be it unto me oh be it unto me according to your [Music] word according to your promises oh yes yes yes R upon my heart the truth that sets me free according to your word oh Lord is that your prayer sing it unto him now oh be it un to me you don't need a visitation from an angel you don't need some visitation from whatever God to send us a prophet he declared the word of God all we have to do is just believe it we have received the same word that Mary received we've been given it it's been declared now we live by that same word as Jesus lived by oh be it unto me saying it again be it un to me according to your word according to your promises I can stand secure right upon my [Music]
