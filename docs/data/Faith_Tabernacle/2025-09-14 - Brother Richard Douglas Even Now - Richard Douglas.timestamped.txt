[23:57] Let's all bow our heads and you pray as
[24:00] we pray. I lead in prayer. Just meditate
[24:03] in your heart as we think on the Lord.
[24:06] Heavenly Father, as we come to you in
[24:08] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, how
[24:10] great is our God. We sang the song a few
[24:13] minutes ago above all and he's above
[24:16] everything. Lord, we think about how
[24:18] great that could be that you're above
[24:20] all things. And we think how the prophet
[24:22] taught us that Christ the mystery. If
[24:24] you can't read Jesus Christ in every
[24:26] verse of the Bible, go back and read it
[24:28] again because you missed something. He's
[24:30] the he's the very heartbeat of God, the
[24:32] nature of God. He's the the
[24:34] manifestation of God. How we thank you
[24:36] Lord that you become flesh one of us a
[24:38] kinsman that we might that he might be
[24:40] touched by the feeling of our
[24:42] infirmities. Lord how thankful we are.
[24:45] How thankful we are for this new
[24:46] covenant. Lord we read in Hebrews 7:19
[24:50] said the law has made nothing perfect
[24:52] but the bringing in of a better hope.
[24:54] And we're thankful Lord for that that
[24:56] new dispensation the superiority of that
[24:58] new dispensation of grace. And Lord,
[25:01] even in our even in this end time where
[25:03] it's double grace, how superior that is,
[25:06] how blessed we are, Lord, these in this
[25:09] last generation to be under a a word
[25:11] message, a word covenant. Lord, you send
[25:13] us a Malachi 4, a messenger to turn our
[25:16] hearts back to the original faith. We're
[25:18] just so thankful, excited. Lord, I know
[25:20] these are perilous times, things that
[25:22] would happen in the news, the insanity
[25:24] of But Lord, we we know that there's got
[25:26] to be that extreme opposite because this
[25:28] is Satan's Eden, yet you're going to
[25:30] take a perfect bride, and you are taking
[25:32] a perfect bride out of this disgusting
[25:35] generation. Lord, I pray for each one of
[25:37] the needs that's on people's hearts. You
[25:39] know, the things that we have been
[25:40] praying for recently. And we thank for
[25:42] those that have been sick, they returned
[25:44] back to the house of the Lord and much
[25:46] better. Perhaps maybe there's some today
[25:48] that they don't feel well in their body.
[25:50] But Lord, as a coming forth of the word,
[25:52] we know there's healing in that. Just
[25:54] believe. Don't doubt you can have
[25:55] whatsoever things you desire. Be with
[25:58] all our brothers and sisters as they
[25:59] travel back from Oklahoma when they come
[26:02] back from the meetings, trusting they're
[26:03] having a good time. Keep them safe on
[26:04] the highways is our prayer. Lord, bless
[26:07] the reading of the word uh in a few
[26:09] minutes. Lord, the preaching of the
[26:11] word. Bless our brother. Give him the
[26:13] words to speak. May they come flowingly.
[26:15] Lord, may it be edification to the
[26:17] bride. That's what we're here for, to be
[26:18] edified, Lord, to be challenged, Lord.
[26:21] Sometimes chastised, but Lord, we want
[26:23] to find favor with you, Lord, and do
[26:25] your perfect will. Bless all that's done
[26:27] and said, Lord, we ask in the lovely
[26:29] name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

[48:44] to see one another.
[48:46] We'll just think about one another and

[49:54] &gt;&gt; Called the master of the sea.
[49:58] One night upon the sea,
[50:02] a ship was tossing to and fro.
[50:06] Breakers dashed on every hand.
[50:11] Angry winds around did blow.
[50:16] All on board were filled with fright
[50:21] as the mighty billows rolled.
[50:27] Then they called upon the one
[50:32] who the winds and waves control.
[50:38] When he reaches out his hand,
[50:43] Bill cease at his command.
[50:48] Winds and waves obey his will.
[50:54] And he says to them, "Be still."
[50:58] What man is this they all did say
[51:04] that the wind and seas obey.
[51:08] [Music]
[51:09] He's the one who sails with me.
[51:13] [Music]
[51:15] He's the master of the sea.
[51:20] Though the storms of life may rage
[51:25] and the billows round you roll,
[51:30] he can calm life's trouble. See,
[51:36] as he did in days of old,
[51:41] as upon life, see yourself.
[51:46] Trust in him who never never fails.
[51:51] I'm so glad he sails with me.
[51:55] [Music]
[51:56] He's the master of the sea. Sing it with
[52:00] me.
[52:02] When he reaches out his hand,
[52:05] [Music]
[52:07] oh cease at his command.
[52:12] Winds and waves obey his will.
[52:17] When he says to them, "Be still."
[52:22] What man is this? They all did say
[52:28] that the winds and seas obey.
[52:33] He's the one who sails with me.
[52:38] He's the master of the sea.
[52:43] When he reaches out his hand,
[52:47] [Music]
[52:49] pillow cease at his command.
[52:54] Winds and waves obey his will.
[52:59] When he says to them, "Be still."
[53:04] What man is this? They all just did say
[53:08] [Music]
[53:09] that the winds and seas obey.
[53:12] [Music]
[53:15] He's the one who sails with me.
[53:19] [Music]
[53:20] He's the master of the sea.
[53:24] Amen.
[53:26] Ain't you
[53:28] Ain't you thankful we serve a God who's
[53:31] the master of everything? Amen.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; He masters everything, controls
[53:36] everything by his spoken word. Amen.
[53:39] Ain't you glad God sent us a message in
[53:41] this hour that would bring us to the to
[53:43] a place that would bring us to the that
[53:45] we could be presented to God as Paul
[53:48] said, a spotless virtuous wife.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Presented unto the king. Right.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; What a what a blood that would be shed
[53:59] that would cleanse me and you in such a
[54:01] way
[54:02] &gt;&gt; that we could come before him.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; With nothing in our way.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:11] I sure love you. That be all the music.
[54:13] We sure love the Lord. Take a little
[54:16] thought if you'll turn with me over into
[54:17] the I'm going to take this coat off
[54:19] because it's really warm in here.
[54:22] brothers of church. They brought it for
[54:24] me. So, I told them I'd wear it. So, I'm
[54:25] not
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. Thank you.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; All right. Yeah, we
[54:40] It's not cold enough for coach yet.
[54:44] Amen. Sure is good to see each and every
[54:48] one of you. We're thankful that God has
[54:50] given us the ability for another
[54:53] gathering together. You know,
[54:55] &gt;&gt; what a gathering. As the prophet said,
[54:57] where the carcass is, the eagles will
[55:00] gather. Amen.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Turn with me to St. John
[55:06] chapter 11. I'd like to read a few
[55:09] verses here. Lay a little groundwork.
[55:12] I'm getting a little feedback somewhere.
[55:15] I don't really need monitors because I
[55:17] don't pay any attention to none of that
[55:19] stuff. You might blow them up.
[55:22] [Music]
[55:25] Amen. You could probably get away with
[55:27] cutting the mic off if it wasn't for the
[55:29] sound system, but
[55:31] I don't have any problem with with that
[55:34] by God's grace.
[55:36] Amen. As we look at this, Jesus is here.
[55:42] He's always on time. We look, we realize
[55:44] that and we hear that that it comes and
[55:47] we starting in St. John 11 starting at
[55:49] verse one. He says, "Now a certain man
[55:52] was sick
[55:54] named Lazarus
[55:56] of Bethany, the town of Mary and his
[56:00] sister Martha. It was that Mary which
[56:04] anointed the Lord with an ointment and
[56:08] wiped his feet with her hair, whose
[56:11] brother Lazarus was sick. Therefore his
[56:16] sisters
[56:17] sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he
[56:22] whom thou lovest is sick.
[56:26] When Jesus heard that, he said, "This
[56:29] sickness is not unto death, but for the
[56:33] glory of God, that the Son of God might
[56:37] be glorified thereby." So see all
[56:39] sicknesses are not under death but to
[56:43] bring glory unto God
[56:45] &gt;&gt; and to magnify him and to bring forth
[56:47] and show that the power that God has
[56:50] that he can do anything anytime anywhere
[56:54] and anytime he wants to do it. Listen he
[56:56] says now Jesus loved Martha and her
[56:59] sister and Lazarus. When he heard when
[57:04] he had heard therefore that that he was
[57:08] sick, he abodeed two days
[57:11] still in the same place where he was.
[57:14] Then after that saith he to his
[57:17] disciples, let us go to Judea again. His
[57:22] disciples say unto him, "Master, the
[57:26] Jews of late
[57:28] sought to stone thee, and thou goest
[57:31] thither again?" Jesus answered, "Are
[57:34] there not 12 hours in a day? If any man
[57:38] walk in the day,
[57:41] he stumbleth not, because he seeth the
[57:45] light of this world." But if a man walk
[57:48] in night, he stumbleth because there is
[57:51] no light in him.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; These things said he, and after that he
[57:56] said unto them, our friend Lazarus
[57:59] sleepeth,
[58:01] but I go that I may awake him out of
[58:05] sleep. Then his disciples,
[58:08] Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. How
[58:13] be it God How be it Jesus spake of his
[58:16] death. But they thought that he had
[58:18] spoken of taking of rest and sleep. Then
[58:23] saith Jesus unto them plainly.
[58:27] Lazarus is dead.
[58:30] And I am glad for your sakes that I was
[58:33] not there. Now see there was a purpose.
[58:35] He could have went right ahead and went
[58:36] right and done it and could have just
[58:38] sat there and spoke the word and Lazarus
[58:40] would have come right up and he wouldn't
[58:42] even had to go. But he was a purpose. He
[58:44] told him for the purpose that it might
[58:45] bring glory unto God. He said, "I'm glad
[58:50] for your sakes that I was not there to
[58:53] the intent ye may believe. Nevertheless,
[58:57] let us go unto him." Then said Thomas,
[59:01] which is called Ditimus, unto his fellow
[59:04] disciples, let us also go that we might
[59:08] may die with him. When then when Jesus
[59:12] came, he found that he had l that he had
[59:16] lain in the grave four days already. Now
[59:20] Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem about 15
[59:24] furongs off. And many of the Jews came
[59:27] to Martha to comfort them concerning
[59:29] their brother. Then Martha, as soon as
[59:33] she heard that Jesus was coming, went to
[59:37] meet went and met him. But Mary sat
[59:40] still in the house. Then said Martha
[59:42] unto Jesus, "If thou hadest been here,
[59:47] my brother had not died. But I know that
[59:51] even now," I want to take those two
[59:53] words. Even now, whatsoever thou wilt
[59:57] ask of God, God will give it thee.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall
[1:00:04] rise again. Martha saith unto him, I
[1:00:08] know that he shall rise again in the
[1:00:11] resurrection.
[1:00:13] At at the last day, Jesus said unto her,
[1:00:18] I am the resurrection
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; and the life. He that believeth in me,
[1:00:24] though he were dead, yet shall he live.
[1:00:28] And whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[1:00:32] shall never die. Believeth thou this,
[1:00:36] she saith unto him, Yay, Lord, I believe
[1:00:40] that thou art the Christ, the Son of the
[1:00:42] living God, which should come into the
[1:00:45] world. And when she had said so, she
[1:00:49] went her way and called Mary her sister
[1:00:52] secretly, saying, The master is come and
[1:00:57] calleth for thee. And as soon as she
[1:00:59] heard that she arose quickly, and came
[1:01:02] unto him. Now Jesus was not yet come
[1:01:06] into the town, but in the place where
[1:01:09] Martha met him. And Jesus and the Jews
[1:01:12] then which were with her in the house
[1:01:14] comfort her, and they saw Mary, and she
[1:01:17] rose up hastily, and went out, followed
[1:01:20] her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to
[1:01:24] weep there. Then when Mary was come
[1:01:28] where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell
[1:01:31] down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord,
[1:01:34] if thou had been here, my brother had
[1:01:37] not died. Then Jesus therefore saw her
[1:01:40] weeping and the Jews also weeping which
[1:01:44] came with her. He he groaned in his
[1:01:48] spirit and was troubled
[1:01:51] and said, "Where have ye laid him?"
[1:01:56] They said unto him, "Lord, come and
[1:01:58] see." Jesus wept. Then the Jews be
[1:02:02] behold how he loved them. And some of
[1:02:05] them said, "Come not, this man which
[1:02:08] opened the eyes of the blind have caused
[1:02:12] even even this man should not have
[1:02:14] died." Look, there was already doubting,
[1:02:18] already complaining,
[1:02:20] already murmuring if he' come. He was
[1:02:24] there.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; There was nothing going to stop for when
[1:02:27] he got there, the problem was solved.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; He was the He was the King of Kings. the
[1:02:34] Lord of Lords. He said, "He's not the
[1:02:36] God of the dead, but of the living."
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Jesus therefore again groaning in
[1:02:41] himself cometh to the grave. It was a
[1:02:44] cave and a stone lay upon him. Jesus
[1:02:47] said unto him, "Take away the stone."
[1:02:49] Martha, the sister of him that was dead,
[1:02:54] saith unto him, Lord, by this time he
[1:02:58] stinkketh.
[1:03:00] Lord, you're too late. We prayed and we
[1:03:04] prayed but you didn't come. But now
[1:03:06] you've waited too long because they
[1:03:08] believed after three days the fourth day
[1:03:12] the spirit was gone and there was no
[1:03:14] hope to be raised from the dead. Then it
[1:03:17] says Jesus said unto her I not I not
[1:03:20] come unto thee that if thou wouldest
[1:03:22] believe thou shouldest see the glory of
[1:03:24] God. Then they took away the stone.
[1:03:28] Huh? They took away the stone from the
[1:03:31] place where the dead l dead was laid.
[1:03:34] Jesus lifted up his eyes and said,
[1:03:37] "Father,
[1:03:39] I thank thee that thou hast heard me,
[1:03:43] and I knew that thou hearest me always,
[1:03:47] because of the people which stand by me,
[1:03:49] I said it, that they may believe that
[1:03:53] thou hast sent me." And when he had thus
[1:03:57] spoken, he cried with a loud voice,
[1:04:00] Lazarus, come forth. And he that was
[1:04:04] dead came forth, bound hand and foot
[1:04:08] with grave clothes. And his face was
[1:04:10] bound with a napkin. Jesus saith unto
[1:04:12] him, "Loose him, and let him go."
[1:04:17] Then many of the Jews came to Mary,
[1:04:20] seen these things which Jesus did did,
[1:04:24] believed on him. But some of them went
[1:04:27] their ways to the Pharisees and told
[1:04:30] them what things he had done.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Father, Lord Jesus, it's your turn,
[1:04:37] Lord. Father, I've done all that a man
[1:04:40] can do, and that's read your scripture.
[1:04:43] Father, your word is already inspired.
[1:04:47] Your word is already anointed. But
[1:04:50] Father, I'm asking you to come now,
[1:04:52] Lord, and anoint me in such a way,
[1:04:55] Father, that it would not be a man
[1:04:58] speaking, but it would be God speaking
[1:05:00] through a man.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; And I pray, Lord, that you'd not only
[1:05:04] anoint the speaker, but you'd anoint the
[1:05:07] hearer. and that you'd bring forth in
[1:05:10] such a way your word that we'd have all
[1:05:12] a testimony when this is over and done
[1:05:15] with. Did not our hearts burn within us
[1:05:19] as you spoke to us along the way. Now
[1:05:21] grant it to us in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:05:23] Amen. And amen.
[1:05:26] Apologize for the lengthy reading, but
[1:05:29] there's so much in there to get the
[1:05:30] point down. You wanted to read out what
[1:05:32] all was going on force. Now, there was a
[1:05:37] commission went out. There was a call.
[1:05:39] There was a asking that he would come.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; And the great heavenly father, when we
[1:05:44] always called him, he's coming.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; He may not come when we think he's going
[1:05:49] to. He may not do it like we think he's
[1:05:52] going to do it, but he always does what
[1:05:55] his children ask him to do if it's
[1:05:57] according to his will.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; And we see here that here was Lazarus.
[1:06:02] They didn't understand what was going
[1:06:04] on. Even the even his disciples were
[1:06:07] scared. They was worried because they
[1:06:09] didn't want Jesus because they seen the
[1:06:11] Jews was out to kill him. And they was
[1:06:13] afraid, don't go there. If he's
[1:06:14] sleeping, he's all right. But see, even
[1:06:16] by the words he spoke, they still didn't
[1:06:19] have the understanding of what he was
[1:06:20] speaking. Just like people say, well,
[1:06:23] we'll just take this Bible without the
[1:06:25] understanding of the Holy Spirit, the
[1:06:27] guide, the Holy Ghost. We cannot
[1:06:29] understand
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; what the word's saying. because he said,
[1:06:32] "Behold, I'll send unto you a guide,
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; and he shall lead and guide you into all
[1:06:38] truth."
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; That's the guide. That's the one we
[1:06:40] need.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; And they didn't understand it because
[1:06:44] the way he spoke it to him, they said,
[1:06:46] you know, he told them sleeps. He was
[1:06:48] asleep because really a Christian cannot
[1:06:51] die.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; For the Bible even says when they stoned
[1:06:54] Steven said they didn't say he died,
[1:06:57] said he went to sleep.
[1:06:59] But they didn't understand that. But God
[1:07:02] had to show them, look, I'm going to
[1:07:03] show you something that's going to bring
[1:07:05] glory to the father. I'm going to do
[1:07:07] something that you'll know that I'm in
[1:07:10] the father and the father in me.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; I'm going to prove to you all of your
[1:07:15] superstitions and all of your thoughts,
[1:07:18] nothing is too hard for God. Amen.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Come on. And we see that as Martha she
[1:07:25] came she came to you know she come and
[1:07:29] she come to Jesus and she after he was
[1:07:34] coming down to there four days seemed
[1:07:35] like you know everything was even though
[1:07:37] she he told her what you know that he
[1:07:41] was the the bread of life and and she
[1:07:44] spoke to him in verse 22 and says but I
[1:07:46] know that thou evens now whatsoever will
[1:07:52] ask of God, he'll give you.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; She's saying, "I don't understand.
[1:07:58] I can't explain it. I can see it with my
[1:08:01] eyes and it's not possible.
[1:08:03] But even now, brothers and sisters, even
[1:08:06] right now in this service,
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; whatever you ask God, God can give it to
[1:08:11] you."
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; God is a God of now.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; God is a God that helps us in the time
[1:08:18] of troubles.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be going through trials.
[1:08:22] You may be going through heartaches as
[1:08:23] we all do. But even now, you can have
[1:08:27] the victory.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Even now, you can overcome
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; because there's been a word sent to us.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; There's been the spirit of God has come
[1:08:36] upon us.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; And we have the opportunity today to say
[1:08:40] the same thing she did. We don't
[1:08:42] understand what we might be going
[1:08:43] through right now.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; We can't explain it.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; We can't see the end of it. But God,
[1:08:50] even now, because you said it, I believe
[1:08:53] it, it's going to happen.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; We need to have a true confession.
[1:09:02] See, the prayers that went forth, they
[1:09:05] had been prayed. And sometimes the
[1:09:08] prayers will go forth and it looks like
[1:09:11] they ain't no answer.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Looks like the ceiling, they go no
[1:09:15] higher than the ceiling. The heaven is
[1:09:17] brass,
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; right? But even now,
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; God's hearing.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Nothing is hindering him from hearing
[1:09:25] your prayers.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; And he told us, even when the weakest
[1:09:30] Christian
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; gets on his knees, hell begins to shake.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, it's not by might,
[1:09:38] it's not by power, but it's by his
[1:09:41] spirit.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Even now, God can change. Amen.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Even now, God can heal us.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; It may look like you may have got a
[1:09:50] report from a doctor. There's no way it
[1:09:54] can happen.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; There's not no way possible
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; it's going to do it.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; But God said even now
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; it's going to happen.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Ain't she thankful for the word of God,
[1:10:08] the truth.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; She didn't understand.
[1:10:12] She even said by now he smells
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; maybe your problems become so hard on
[1:10:20] you this morning
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; fault you so much that your problem has
[1:10:24] become stench to you
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; it smells so bad looks like there ain't
[1:10:28] no way I'm going to get out of this
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; but even now
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; God's still a deliverer
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; even now God's still a savior
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; even now God's a healer
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; even Now God gives the Holy Ghost.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Even now God delivers the oppressed.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Even now God sets the captive free.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; We don't serve a God of history.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; We serve a God of now. Brother said,
[1:10:56] "That's our problem, brother Amos, is we
[1:10:58] look, we're looking back at what he
[1:11:00] done."
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; And we're looking forward to what he's
[1:11:03] going to do. But we're failing to see
[1:11:05] what he's doing even now.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Right now, he's doing something
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; in this service. right now he's dealing
[1:11:12] with somebody
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; right now he's speaking to a heart
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; you may be battling with maybe you
[1:11:18] fighting have a problem desiring for
[1:11:21] your husband to come back
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; even now God can do that
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; your wife may be strained off even now
[1:11:29] God can bring her back
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; your son may be gone off astray but even
[1:11:34] now God can bring him back
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; your daughter might be seem to be lost
[1:11:39] may look like all situations may look
[1:11:41] like it's just got worse and worse and
[1:11:43] worse.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; To the place of where it looks like
[1:11:46] there's no hope.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; But there's always hope as long as
[1:11:50] there's breath in that body.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:53] I remember when my mother prayed for me
[1:11:55] and brother Amos and I was out in the
[1:11:58] world and things, you know, and it got
[1:12:00] seemed like it got worse and worse and
[1:12:02] worse. And she'd go to the pastor and
[1:12:05] say, "Brother,
[1:12:07] seems like the more I pray, the worse he
[1:12:10] gets."
[1:12:11] And it seems that way cuz Satan's
[1:12:13] showing, "Look at your prayers ain't
[1:12:14] being answered. You've been praying for
[1:12:15] your son. You've been praying for your
[1:12:17] daughter, your husband, your wife.
[1:12:18] You've been praying for this situ this
[1:12:20] sickness. You've been praying for this
[1:12:21] situation. It's just got worse.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; You know why it's got worse? Cuz God's
[1:12:27] coming.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Right before it gets better, it gets
[1:12:32] worse.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Lazarus situation got worse before he
[1:12:37] come because
[1:12:39] that he knew he was going to come.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; And Satan was going to say, "Look, I'm
[1:12:44] taking him." Jesus said, "Go ahead and
[1:12:46] take him, but you can't take him far.
[1:12:48] You can only take him as far as I let
[1:12:50] you have him.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; And he said, I'm going to allow this
[1:12:53] that bring glory to the father.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; I'm going to reveal something to them
[1:12:59] that no matter how many days have passed
[1:13:01] or how long it you think it took me to
[1:13:04] get here,
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; preach.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; I heard you when you first asked me.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; I heard you when you commissioned me to
[1:13:11] come, but I was tearing trying to see if
[1:13:14] you still had faith. Amen.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Faith comes through trials and
[1:13:19] tribulations and patience work us all
[1:13:21] that we sometimes we we pray for
[1:13:23] patience. Then look for trials.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; And I like it like this. You know what?
[1:13:28] Satan is only battling those who he
[1:13:31] can't defeat.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; He's not battling them that he's already
[1:13:35] defeated.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; He's already He's battling you because
[1:13:38] he he he don't want to accept it. But he
[1:13:41] cannot defeat you because God said,
[1:13:43] "I've overcome. You'll overcome also."
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; And we'll overcome by the word of our
[1:13:49] testimony and the blood of the lamb.
[1:13:50] It's according to how we approach that
[1:13:53] trial. When something happens,
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; if we'll approach it like Job did when
[1:13:58] all that hit him, he didn't he didn't
[1:14:02] accuse God.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; He didn't argue with God. It's amazing
[1:14:06] that his reaction to all of that when he
[1:14:08] lost his family, when he lost his
[1:14:11] children, lost everything he owned.
[1:14:14] The Bible said he fell on his face
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; and he didn't complain. The Bible said
[1:14:19] and he worshiped
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; God. That's how you defeat Satan in your
[1:14:25] trial
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; is when you begin to worship God in your
[1:14:29] adversities, in your dark trials. When
[1:14:33] you begin to say, "God, even now,
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; you're able.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; You're more than able to bring this
[1:14:42] situation and turn it around."
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; God, we're not looking at it by sight.
[1:14:47] We're not looking at it by feelings.
[1:14:49] We're walking by faith.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Believing that whatever you have
[1:14:53] started, you will finish.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Ain't you thankful for that? The Bible
[1:15:01] said, "He who hath began a good work,"
[1:15:04] it wasn't Amos that started a good work
[1:15:06] in his life.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Wasn't Richard that started a good work
[1:15:09] in his life. He began it. G.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; And when Satan comes at me and starts
[1:15:13] battling me, Sister Kim, and he starts
[1:15:15] telling me, "You ain't going to make it.
[1:15:16] Ain't no hope for you." I said, "How can
[1:15:19] I quit something I didn't start?"
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; You tell him to stop.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; He's telling me to keep going.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; You're already defeated.
[1:15:29] You already been whooped.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Greater is he that's in me
[1:15:34] than he that's in this world."
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; He that's in me is greater than this.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said, "Thy kingdom
[1:15:41] come. Thy will be done on earth as it is
[1:15:44] in heaven."
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; It looked like all hope was gone.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Was no hopes at all. He said, "I am the
[1:15:54] resurrection life." She thought it was
[1:15:55] going to be, you know, when the raised
[1:15:57] from the trumpet sounds and they going
[1:15:58] to come up. But he's showing, look,
[1:16:00] right now,
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; I can raise the dead.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Right now, I can open the blind eyes.
[1:16:06] Right now, I can make the deaf hear.
[1:16:09] Right now, I can make the mute speak.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Right now, I can make the lame walk.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Right now, I can create ankle bones.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; In a boy that was born without ankle
[1:16:22] bone.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; I'm a testimony of that. They can't say,
[1:16:25] brother Amos, that God didn't do it.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; There it is.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Brother said we'd see missing limbs
[1:16:32] restored. There it is.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; God created it.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; The doctor said there ain't no way, no
[1:16:40] way possible. Here's our X-ray. This boy
[1:16:43] here, he has no ankle bone. He cannot
[1:16:46] walk. He will not walk unless he walks
[1:16:48] on crutches or some kind of braces. And
[1:16:51] my mom and dad said, "You do what you
[1:16:54] can do, doctor, and we'll let God do
[1:16:56] what he can do."
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; They said, "Well, we'll put a cast on
[1:16:59] him. We can straighten his legs." My
[1:17:01] legs just hung. My foot just flopped.
[1:17:03] You couldn't walk if you didn't have no
[1:17:05] ankle bone, club foot, and nothing
[1:17:08] there. You'd have to have something to
[1:17:10] stabilize it.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:13] So here they gone and they said took me
[1:17:16] through the prayer lines and had the
[1:17:19] ministers pray for me like the Bible
[1:17:20] says anoint the
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; sick with oil
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; still works even now it works.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; 2,000 years later it's still working.
[1:17:30] Yeah.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; So, here they come. And so, they cut
[1:17:36] that cut that off. And
[1:17:40] the doctor said, "I don't believe it."
[1:17:44] Said, "There's an ankle bone there.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus."
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; And God got the glory for that
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; because that back then they couldn't
[1:17:52] give you prosthetic hips and knees and
[1:17:55] all those things.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; God said, "I'm going to do something
[1:17:59] greater than that. Amen.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give him something he
[1:18:02] didn't have, but I'm going to show that
[1:18:04] I can give what you come without.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; G.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; And this morning, when if you come
[1:18:09] without something you need, God's here
[1:18:10] to give it to you.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Even now.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Even now. You don't have to leave empty.
[1:18:15] You don't have to leave disappointed.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Even now, God's able to do whatever you
[1:18:19] need.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; And so, all we got to do is believe.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Believe.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; If we can believe, we'll receive.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know that's he had to have he
[1:18:31] was just looking for somebody to accept
[1:18:34] that he was more than able.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; And they they didn't they wasn't even
[1:18:40] when he got there they wasn't expecting
[1:18:42] to be raising the dead. They was going
[1:18:43] thinking she's going to mourn. We're
[1:18:45] going to go with her.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Jesus said he's thinking Lord maybe
[1:18:50] there's a stone in front of you today.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Like there was Lazarus.
[1:18:55] Maybe you're dead in sins and
[1:18:57] trespasses.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Maybe you're in a place right now and
[1:19:01] there's a stone in front of you. Maybe
[1:19:03] you're at a place where your experience
[1:19:05] has died down and you've come to a place
[1:19:07] where you're where you're weary and
[1:19:10] you're you you've lost your joy and
[1:19:12] you've lost your p uh peace and Satan's
[1:19:14] put you Oh, glory be to God. Satan's put
[1:19:17] you in put you in a tomb.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; He's rolled a stone in front of you.
[1:19:21] He's told everybody that brother's dead.
[1:19:24] He can't serve God no more. He sat under
[1:19:27] this message for years. He's dead. He's
[1:19:30] died out.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Preach.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; But even now,
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; he said, "I will restore, sayeth the
[1:19:37] Lord."
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Not later. Even now.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Mary didn't understand
[1:19:48] when she come and he said, "Behold,
[1:19:50] you'll you'll have a child." not knowing
[1:19:53] a man. She said, "How can this be?
[1:19:58] How can this be?"
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; He had to get her faith built up by
[1:20:02] telling her, "Look,
[1:20:05] Elizabeth,
[1:20:06] your cousin has wanted a child for a
[1:20:10] long time. Even now, is pregnant."
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Come on now. and said, "I've come for
[1:20:17] the from the presence of the Lord to
[1:20:19] tell you this that you're blessed and
[1:20:22] highly favored."
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Ain't that what this message come to
[1:20:25] tell the bride?
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; Said you're blessed and highly favored.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; And guess what? You're impregnated now.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; You're fixing to bring forth the son of
[1:20:35] God.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; We've been impregnated with this
[1:20:38] message. Nothing else can impregnate us
[1:20:40] no more. No thoughts, no man's ideas, no
[1:20:44] man's understanding, no man's uh
[1:20:47] understanding, no man's uh way of saying
[1:20:51] things. No way can he how can they talk
[1:20:53] you out of it?
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; They didn't talk me in it.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; That's what I say. How can you talk me
[1:21:00] out of it when you didn't talk me in it?
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown said, "If a man told it to
[1:21:04] you, another man can take it away from
[1:21:06] you."
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; But no man gave me this. Just like
[1:21:09] Peter, he said, "I conferred with no
[1:21:10] man, brother,
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; but I went for myself."
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; And I said, "God, did you show it to
[1:21:16] me?"
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; And guess where he showed it to me? In
[1:21:18] the word.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; That's where we got to get it.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; We got to have a personal relationship
[1:21:27] with Jesus Christ.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Got to understand even now God can do
[1:21:31] whatever.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, he can.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; He said he can do. He's not limited.
[1:21:36] Brother said, "Oh, you know, sometimes
[1:21:37] you get looking at if you look at it
[1:21:39] natural, Satan says, "Oh, this old ma
[1:21:41] message is it's drying out.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; It's fading out."
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. One brother told me, he said,
[1:21:48] "Within 5 years, there won't be no
[1:21:49] message." And you know what I said? I
[1:21:51] said, "Praise God, that means I won't be
[1:21:52] here."
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; I said, "Because as long as I'm here,
[1:21:56] there's going to be a message. As long
[1:21:58] as you're here, there's going to be a
[1:21:59] message."
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; For that message is Jesus Christ that
[1:22:04] lives in you. Ain't that tell what Paul
[1:22:06] said is Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; not your desire not your think about but
[1:22:11] the hope the faith Paul said the life I
[1:22:15] now live
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; I live by the faith of God
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; the faith of the son of God the faith he
[1:22:22] did have he persecuted the church I like
[1:22:26] it like this the Lord showed me that one
[1:22:27] time I preached on the message human
[1:22:28] faith versus God's faith
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; and I said look at Paul's faith he was
[1:22:32] zealous he thought he was doing Good.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; I said human faith
[1:22:38] persecuted the church and killed it.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; I said, "But God's faith resurrected the
[1:22:43] church."
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Bring her back to restored the church.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; I said, "So it's your faith." Brother
[1:22:51] Brown said, "Take that a token and apply
[1:22:53] it on your situations.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; If it's your children, your husband,
[1:22:57] your aunt, your uncle, we don't have to
[1:22:59] lead none of them."
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:02] Moses wasn't going to just go worship
[1:23:03] and leave his children.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Favor, Satan tries to make deals with
[1:23:08] you. You just go on to church. Don't
[1:23:10] worry about your children. Don't pray
[1:23:11] for them.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; They if they children of God, they'll
[1:23:15] come.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; I said hogwash.
[1:23:19] I'm not going to leave them for you or
[1:23:21] nobody else.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; God said they're my heritage.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; I don't know how he'll do it, when he'll
[1:23:28] do it,
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; but I know he said he'd do it.
[1:23:31] Amen.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; And I want to be like this right here. I
[1:23:34] want to live such a life
[1:23:36] in God and live such a Christian. Not to
[1:23:38] be the best preacher. I've never desired
[1:23:40] to be that. I want to be the best
[1:23:42] Christian.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Then the best preacher will come. The
[1:23:45] best preacher is the Holy Ghost. It's
[1:23:47] not brother Amos. It's not brother Sean.
[1:23:49] The Holy Ghost is the preacher. It's not
[1:23:50] a man.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Man can't do this.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Man can't speak to your heart. Man can't
[1:23:57] heal you. Man can't save you. man can't
[1:24:00] give you the Holy Ghost, God gives it to
[1:24:03] you. Had one brother said, "Well,
[1:24:05] Brother Richard said, "Brother Brown
[1:24:07] didn't give you the Holy Ghost." I said,
[1:24:08] "I know he didn't." I said, "Brother
[1:24:10] Brown couldn't even get the Holy Ghost
[1:24:11] for yourself. God gave it to him."
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown even said, "I can't give
[1:24:14] you the Holy Ghost." God gives it to
[1:24:15] you.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Peter didn't give him the Holy Ghost
[1:24:18] that day.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; God did. He said he was bringing their
[1:24:21] faith up and said, "This is that."
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; This is a manifestation of what the word
[1:24:27] said. Right.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Even now, if you'll believe, oh, glory
[1:24:30] be to Even now, if you'll believe,
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord,
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; you can have a refilling of the Holy
[1:24:34] Ghost.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Even now, if you believe, you can be
[1:24:37] healed.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; That's what God said.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; It's not what man said.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; That's what God says.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Our confession. Don't let your condition
[1:24:50] affect your position.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; That's what Satan says. Oh, boy. If you
[1:24:54] was really a Christian, brother Amos,
[1:24:56] you wouldn't battle them things you
[1:24:57] battle.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Oh boy. If you was really a Christian,
[1:25:01] you wouldn't never have no problems.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't never get sick.
[1:25:06] God don't love you.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Praise.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; You're just walking around fooling
[1:25:10] yourself. I said, "God's already healed
[1:25:12] me."
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; God's already saved me.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; God's already filled me with the Holy
[1:25:17] Ghost. All I'm doing is waiting on my
[1:25:18] body to come under the obedience of the
[1:25:20] word.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; He already healed us.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; That's right. I'm just saying I don't
[1:25:24] never ask or when I ask go prepare. I
[1:25:26] don't say pray that God will heal me. I
[1:25:27] say pray that God will bring my body
[1:25:29] subject to my confession.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Cuz confession brings possession.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; He that confessth, he that confessth
[1:25:38] shall possess us.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Ain't you thankful for
[1:25:43] that?
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; You thankful for the pray the power of
[1:25:45] God.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; He comes to the hopeless and gives us
[1:25:48] hope. Even the Bible said faith is the
[1:25:50] substance of things hoped for, the
[1:25:52] evidence of things not seen. Us is
[1:25:55] sometimes us humans. Oh God, I got to
[1:25:57] see it first. He said, I'll let you see
[1:25:59] it when you believe it.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; And you know what? I found out that when
[1:26:06] I start thanking him,
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; it comes to pass.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; I remember one time I was praying and
[1:26:14] praying and praying. I said, "God, you
[1:26:16] know, praying to my wife, I need a car.
[1:26:18] I travel, you know, we travel, brother
[1:26:19] Amish, you know, we get on the roads and
[1:26:21] we go and when God gives us health and
[1:26:24] gives us strength, you know, and wore
[1:26:26] the poor old car out, you know, and you
[1:26:29] know, ain't none of us millionaires, you
[1:26:32] know, and
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; I thought, well, I don't know what I'm
[1:26:35] going to do. And my wife said, "Well,
[1:26:37] why don't you ask God?" And I said, "I
[1:26:39] need so many spiritual things and
[1:26:41] physical things. Why would I ask him for
[1:26:43] such a a materialistic thing?" You know,
[1:26:45] and I was walking through the house, you
[1:26:47] know, I didn't want to ask that first. I
[1:26:48] need this, man. I need God to help me.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; You need God to help you this morning.
[1:26:54] Without his help, we're not going to do
[1:26:55] it. But I remember, Brother, I was
[1:26:57] walking through the house and I was
[1:26:59] praying and talking to the Lord and he
[1:27:01] spoke to me. He said, "Why ain't you ask
[1:27:03] me for a car?"
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; He's even mindful of the things, the
[1:27:07] natural things we need.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; He said, "Why ain't you ask me?"
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; He said, "You have not cuz you ask not.
[1:27:13] And when you do ask, you ask a miss.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Why don't we ask him?
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; And then thank him for doing it.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; So I asked him and guess what? He did
[1:27:24] it.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; He bring it to pass.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Because I said, "Lord, I thank you
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; that thou hears me." Just like Jesus
[1:27:33] said, "Father, I thank you that you
[1:27:35] hear." We got to have confidence when we
[1:27:38] pray.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Say, "Brother Rich, how you pray like
[1:27:40] that?" I know he hears me when I pray.
[1:27:43] We have a spiritual connection. I am
[1:27:46] born of his spirit.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; We are born of his bone. Spirit of his
[1:27:51] spirit. Life of his life.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; We are him.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; In bride form.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Brother said we're little Messiah. See,
[1:27:59] Satan tries to talk you out of that.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; That's what God said. That ain't what
[1:28:04] that ain't what we think. That's what
[1:28:06] God said we are.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Re said you're an amateur god.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Right. We don't realize how powerful our
[1:28:13] words are.
[1:28:15] If we did, we'd watch what we're saying.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Cuz sometimes we get to a place and
[1:28:19] we'll say, you remember brother got to a
[1:28:21] place. He said, well, said Satan was
[1:28:23] talking said, look at her. He took your
[1:28:24] wife, took your child, your daddy. Here
[1:28:27] you are praying. You can pray for
[1:28:29] everybody else and he'll answer, but he
[1:28:31] won't answer you.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, Satan's straight with you.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; He tries you.
[1:28:38] He ain't playing games.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; He's a good adversary,
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; but he's a defeated adversary.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I have overcome."
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; And we're in him. That means we've
[1:28:50] overcome, too.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; But he'll tell you that. He likes to
[1:28:55] tell you, you ain't no way you can do
[1:28:56] it.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; And you know what I tell him? I know I
[1:28:58] can't, but I know he did.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; And I tell him, I can do all things
[1:29:04] through Christ Jesus who strengthens me.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:08] He called and the Bible said he causth
[1:29:10] me to triumphant.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; He made us winner,
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; brother Josiah. He made you a winner.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; He elected you, brother Will, and made
[1:29:19] you a winner.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; He chose you.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; You didn't choose him.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; You ran from him. You hid from him.
[1:29:28] That's
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; You did everything to stay away from
[1:29:31] him.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Come on now. But he came to your house
[1:29:33] one day
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; just like just like he did Zakayas.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "I've come to your house today,
[1:29:39] Zakayas."
[1:29:41] Hallelujah.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Salvation has come." Woo!
[1:29:44] Glory be to God.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; He come knocking one day.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; And guess what? He gave me an ear to
[1:29:50] hear that knock.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; He's knocked on many a heart, brother
[1:29:53] Amos. But they couldn't hear the knock.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; But he said, "Oh my, I love this." You
[1:29:59] know what? He gave you faith to believe
[1:30:02] and he's blessing you for believing.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; You couldn't believe.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; So it had nothing to do with you. You
[1:30:08] just only thing he asked you to do was
[1:30:09] was to obey.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ain't you thankful for that?
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; He is. He's more than able.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; He already did it.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; He said he would do it.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Turn with me to to First Kings. Can you?
[1:30:28] First Kings chapter 8. Listen to this.
[1:30:30] Now, here's a man that believed in
[1:30:32] praying,
[1:30:34] Solomon. And when he prayed, he believed
[1:30:36] God heard him. And listen what God did
[1:30:39] for him when he prayed.
[1:30:47] He's asking God to do this. And this is
[1:30:48] this is now he's telling me this. If the
[1:30:51] enemy comes in,
[1:30:54] we got a God we can call on that can
[1:30:56] feed him. It's first Kings 8
[1:31:01] starting at verse 42.
[1:31:05] He's talking about after he built the
[1:31:06] temple. He said,
[1:31:09] "For they shall hear of thy great name
[1:31:12] and of thy strong hand and of thy
[1:31:16] stretched out arm. When he shall come,
[1:31:19] pray toward this house."
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; A you glad it's not a building no more,
[1:31:23] not a temple, but we're praying towards
[1:31:25] him. turn our eyes toward Jesus. That's
[1:31:28] the temple now.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; We We don't have to turn to to
[1:31:32] Jerusalem, the temple there which was
[1:31:34] destroyed. He was telling him, "Look,
[1:31:36] you that temple there's going to be
[1:31:38] destroyed,
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; but you can tear this temple down, but
[1:31:40] I'll raise it back up."
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; And he did.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; He told Pilot, "You think you got power?
[1:31:48] You'd have no power unless I give it to
[1:31:50] you." All right,
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; brother. All power in heaven and earth
[1:31:54] is given of God. Even what Satan's got,
[1:31:57] he got it from God.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Listen to this. He said, "Hear thou in
[1:32:02] heaven thy dwelling place, and according
[1:32:05] to all that the stranger calleth to thee
[1:32:09] for, that all people of the earth may
[1:32:11] know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy
[1:32:15] people Israel, and that they may know
[1:32:18] that this house which I have builded is
[1:32:22] called by thy name."
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Ain't tell what God said. This house
[1:32:28] which I have built,
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; it's called in my name.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; If you'll turn to this house, Jesus
[1:32:33] Christ.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Look how the shadow types to
[1:32:37] this. How beautiful. Listen to this. He
[1:32:40] said, "Then hear thou in heaven their
[1:32:43] prayer and their supplication and
[1:32:46] maintain their cause if they sin against
[1:32:49] thee. For there is no man that sinnth
[1:32:52] not." Oh, I thought, oh, I was born in
[1:32:55] the message. Ain't no way. I ain't never
[1:32:57] sinned. I ain't never been out in the
[1:32:59] world. I ain't never drank. I ain't
[1:33:01] never cussed. He was born.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; He's born a sinner.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Didn't he tell you right there? Oh, I
[1:33:09] love how the scripture, you know, Paul
[1:33:11] said, "We've all sinned and come short
[1:33:13] of the glory of God."
[1:33:15] He said, "There is no man that sinnth
[1:33:17] not, and thou be angry with them, and
[1:33:21] deliver them to the enemy, so that thou
[1:33:24] carry them away captivity." He's telling
[1:33:26] them, "When you do that thing, I'm going
[1:33:27] to let the enemy, but I'm going to
[1:33:28] deliver you, but I'm going to let your
[1:33:31] enemy get the best of you
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; because you've not obeyed me.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; You've not done what I've asked you to
[1:33:36] do. You've not done according to what
[1:33:37] I've asked." See, if we've done what God
[1:33:39] has asked us and we got something on us
[1:33:41] that's boundless, we got a right to say,
[1:33:43] "God, you promised you do this."
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; You said that, Lord, there's nothing
[1:33:48] here but me and the blood of Jesus.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Then Satan has no right to hold anything
[1:33:53] over you.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said far away. Yet if
[1:33:59] they shall bethink themselves in the
[1:34:02] land wherewith they have carried
[1:34:05] captives and repent and make
[1:34:08] supplication unto the land of them that
[1:34:12] carried them captives, saying, We have
[1:34:14] sinned and have done perversely. We have
[1:34:18] committed wickedness, and so return unto
[1:34:22] thee with all their heart.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Right? See, you have to turn to him with
[1:34:26] all of your heart. Not just, "Oh, well,
[1:34:28] I got caught. I better repent."
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; But you got to be sorrowful what you
[1:34:32] did. Say, "God, I've sinned again." Look
[1:34:34] at the the prodical son. He said, "I've
[1:34:36] sinned against heaven and I've sinned
[1:34:38] against you, Father.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm Father, I'm coming back. I
[1:34:42] don't I don't have to be a son no more,
[1:34:45] but I'm willing to serve.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; I'm willing to do whatever you want,
[1:34:52] Lord. Whatever you ask me to do, just
[1:34:54] let me come back home.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; That's the way I was. I said, "Lord,
[1:34:58] just let me come back, brother Amos.
[1:35:00] Just let me come back, Lord."
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; I'm willing to do. See, that's where we
[1:35:04] mess up. We forget that we're here to
[1:35:05] serve.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; The Bible, Brother Bam told us, he said,
[1:35:10] "When you're living your life for
[1:35:11] others, you're staring heaven in the
[1:35:12] face."
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; The five-fold ministry is here to serve
[1:35:16] you, not for you to serve them.
[1:35:20] Men of God need to realize that we come
[1:35:23] here as servants to serve you what God
[1:35:25] has prepared. Brother Brand said, "Take
[1:35:27] this message."
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Amy, break it down and feed it
[1:35:31] to them.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; And said, "Make it so simple that even
[1:35:35] the little bitty children can
[1:35:37] understand."
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, wait a minute, brother. I
[1:35:40] thought I had to use these big old words
[1:35:42] and all this stuff." I said, "Well, Paul
[1:35:44] said, I didn't come to you with enticing
[1:35:45] words and wisdom of men, but I come to
[1:35:47] you with power."
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; That's right. and demonstration.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; What was more better? Enticing words or
[1:35:54] power and demonstration?
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Power and demonstration. The power was
[1:35:58] to demonstrate the word being alive.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; And the only one can do that is the Holy
[1:36:03] Ghost through us.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Aren't you thankful for
[1:36:09] that? So if you pray, if you'll do what
[1:36:12] I tell you to do, if we come back and
[1:36:14] call on his name, he'll do this for us.
[1:36:18] He won't withhold nothing from us.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Oh my. His arm ain't too short.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; He's not weak. Let's turn over into
[1:36:26] Daniel just for a minute. Look at the
[1:36:27] man now. We seen Martha call on him.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; 21. And it took what was it? Four days
[1:36:34] for him to get there. Here's a man that
[1:36:36] didn't lose faith. Took 21 days.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; He didn't quit praying. Brother Amos.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; In Daniel chapter nine, let's start
[1:36:46] right here. Let's
[1:36:49] see. Daniel,
[1:36:52] let's see.
[1:36:56] Let's see if I can get it right here.
[1:37:03] Put my glasses on.
[1:37:11] All right. All right. All right. I got
[1:37:12] it now. I had to get my eyes focused.
[1:37:18] This is Daniel chapter nine. Look, it
[1:37:19] says, "In the year of Darius,
[1:37:22] the son of Aseres of the seed of Mendes,
[1:37:26] which made was made king over the realm
[1:37:28] of the Chaldans, in the first year of
[1:37:31] his reign, I Daniel stood by the books,
[1:37:34] the numbers of the years where the Lord
[1:37:36] of Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet."
[1:37:40] Look, even a prophet goes back to the
[1:37:43] word.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's not a true prophet unless he
[1:37:46] goes back to the word.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; And brother Bram told us, he said, "If I
[1:37:50] or anybody," and Paul said, "if anybody
[1:37:52] preach anything than what I've already
[1:37:54] preached,
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; let him be a curse."
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; He said, and he was so sure that what
[1:37:58] God had delivered is unto him. He said,
[1:38:00] "Even if I say anything,
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; contrary to what's already been spoken,
[1:38:06] let me be a curse." Look at this. Here's
[1:38:10] Daniel. He's needing help. And he goes
[1:38:11] to the goes to the word of the Lord from
[1:38:14] Jeremiah the prophet that he would
[1:38:16] accomplish 70 years in the desolations
[1:38:18] of Jerusalem. And he said, "I set my
[1:38:20] face unto the Lord God to seek by prayer
[1:38:24] and supplications with fasting and
[1:38:26] sackcloths and ashes. And I prayed unto
[1:38:28] the Lord my God and made my confession
[1:38:32] and said, "Oh Lord, the great and
[1:38:34] dreadful God, keeping the covenant and
[1:38:37] the mercy to them that love him and to
[1:38:40] them that keep his commandments. We have
[1:38:42] sin." Look, he first thing he do, he
[1:38:44] starts repenting for what they've done.
[1:38:46] Didn't he say he'd only mark those who
[1:38:47] were signing and crying for the
[1:38:49] abominations done in the city? Listen,
[1:38:51] he puts himself in here. That's what
[1:38:54] God, we've sinned. We've made a mistake.
[1:38:57] We shouldn't have done. We should have
[1:38:58] listened to you. We should have obeyed
[1:39:00] you. This is the repercussion we've
[1:39:02] received because we didn't obey. Not
[1:39:04] because you're not merciful and
[1:39:06] gracious, but because we disobeyed.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "We have sinned and have
[1:39:11] committed iniquity and have done
[1:39:13] wickedly and have rebelled even by
[1:39:15] departing from thy precepts and from thy
[1:39:18] judgments. Neither have we hearkened
[1:39:20] unto thy servants, the prophets which
[1:39:23] spake in in thy name to our kings and
[1:39:26] our princes and our fathers." Ain't that
[1:39:28] happening right now?
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; It's happening right now, brother. I
[1:39:31] said spirits don't die. They still
[1:39:32] dwelling.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; And same old spirit and all the people
[1:39:35] of the land. He said, "Oh Lord,
[1:39:38] righteousness belongth unto thee, but
[1:39:40] unto us confu confusion of faces, and at
[1:39:44] the day to the men of Judah, and to the
[1:39:47] inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all
[1:39:49] Israel that are near, and that are far
[1:39:52] off, through the countries, whether thou
[1:39:55] hast driven them, because of their
[1:39:57] trespasses, they have trespassed against
[1:39:59] thee. Oh Lord, to us belongest confusion
[1:40:03] of face. to our kings, to our princes,
[1:40:07] to our fathers, because we have sinned
[1:40:09] against thee. The to the Lord God belong
[1:40:12] mercies and forgiveness. Though we have
[1:40:14] rebelled against him, neither have we
[1:40:16] obeyed the voice of the Lord and our
[1:40:18] God. Walk in his ways which he has said.
[1:40:21] Then what do we do? We first praise him,
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; And then we repent,
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; And then we give him adoration.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; Then we yield to whatever he says.
[1:40:31] That's right.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; He said, "Yay, all Israel has
[1:40:34] transgressed against thy law, even in
[1:40:37] departing from they that might obey the
[1:40:39] voice. Therefore, a curse is poured upon
[1:40:42] us, and the oath that is written in the
[1:40:44] law of Moses, the servant of God,
[1:40:46] because we have sinned against, and he
[1:40:48] hath confirmed his words, and he has
[1:40:50] spake against us, and against our
[1:40:52] judges, and judged us by bringing upon
[1:40:55] this great evil. For under the whole
[1:40:57] heaven hath not been done as hath been
[1:41:00] done upon Jerusalem. He said, "As it is
[1:41:03] written in the law of Moses, all this
[1:41:05] evil is come upon us, yet made we not
[1:41:08] our prayer before the Lord our God, that
[1:41:10] we might turn from our iniquities, and
[1:41:13] understand the truth. Therefore ha hath
[1:41:15] God watched upon the evil, and brought
[1:41:18] it upon us. For the Lord our God is
[1:41:21] righteous in all the works which he
[1:41:23] doeth, for we have obeyed." See, he's
[1:41:26] trying to get an answer from God. But he
[1:41:27] has to you to get an answer from God,
[1:41:29] you must approach him the right way.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; If you don't approach him, Brother Brown
[1:41:33] said, if when one man, however he
[1:41:36] approaches God, if you'll do that same
[1:41:39] thing, God will do the same thing for
[1:41:42] you. Let's go on down. Then I'll skip
[1:41:44] some. You can read this later on. But
[1:41:45] look at this. And it says in verse 24,
[1:41:51] it says, "And 70 weeks are determined
[1:41:53] upon thy people in the holy city to
[1:41:54] finish the transgression and to make
[1:41:57] ends of the sins iniquities and to bring
[1:41:58] everlasting righteousness and to seal up
[1:42:00] the vision of the prophecy and to anoint
[1:42:02] the most holy. Know therefore that
[1:42:04] understand therefore and understand that
[1:42:06] from the going forth and the commandment
[1:42:09] to restore and to build Jerusalem,
[1:42:11] Messiah the prince shall be seven weeks
[1:42:15] and three score and two weeks." He said,
[1:42:17] "The street shall be built again in the
[1:42:19] wall and even in troubles times." He
[1:42:23] didn't say it's going to be easy.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; He said, "But in that time, in that
[1:42:27] troubles time, it's going to happen."
[1:42:29] Brother, right here, God is building a
[1:42:31] bride right now in this leady age.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; In a troubles time like no other man's
[1:42:36] ever known, but God is bringing a bride
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; out of a dark, filthy, dirty generation.
[1:42:43] He said, "And after three score and two
[1:42:44] weeks the Messiah shall come and shall
[1:42:47] confirm."
[1:42:48] And he said, "Look at this." And he and
[1:42:51] he and it goes on, he tells he tells
[1:42:53] that and he says after he's done all
[1:42:56] that, he's prayed and he's prayed and
[1:42:59] he's prayed and it looks like
[1:43:02] he's not going to get an answer,
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; But then an angel appears.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Come on now. and says, "Look, Daniel,
[1:43:11] he heard you when you first prayed."
[1:43:13] Brothers and sisters, when we first
[1:43:14] pray, we got to have faith. And when we
[1:43:16] ask God, he hears us.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; But he said, "The prince of Persia,
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; withtood me.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; He fought against me.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; He held me back. But
[1:43:28] Michael come."
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Michael has come in this hour to defend
[1:43:33] us. And even he says on he said even
[1:43:37] your
[1:43:39] your angel Michael
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; that I have given you is fought for you.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; And he has caused you to triumph within
[1:43:48] this age.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; He has defeated the enemy. But what I
[1:43:54] like about it, brother brother Amos,
[1:43:57] when he gets the answer,
[1:43:59] he said, "But I got to go back and fight
[1:44:01] still."
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. When you get the answer, the
[1:44:04] fight's still going on. Cuz the fight
[1:44:06] ain't against flesh and blood. It's
[1:44:08] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:44:10] places.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; The fight is between the conflict is
[1:44:13] between God and Satan.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; We got to understand that. That's not
[1:44:18] our fight.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; It's his fight.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; He's not fighting us.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; He's fighting God that lives in us.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; That's why he said, "Greater's he is in
[1:44:30] us than he is in the world."
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. He said, "He's come in."
[1:44:33] Hey, when he wanted the body of Moses,
[1:44:36] Michael said, "The Lord rebuked these,
[1:44:38] Satan."
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Why do you want that body? So he can
[1:44:42] make an eye out of it.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; So he could make make an a a monarch or
[1:44:47] a place that they could go to the grave
[1:44:49] and and make a big monument of it. Oh,
[1:44:52] great prophet Moses.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Didn't even when they come, was they not
[1:44:57] looking to build temples?
[1:44:59] When Moses and Elijah come, Peter said,
[1:45:02] "Shall we build three temples,
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; he said no."
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; He said, "Hear ye him."
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Not them.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, mine. That's why Paul said in the
[1:45:16] scripture said he said that even even he
[1:45:20] said the Lord spake to us by the
[1:45:22] prophets which we know has but now
[1:45:25] speake it to us through the Holy Spirit.
[1:45:28] Amen.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful for that?
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Let me read you a few quotes. I'm not
[1:45:33] going to hold you long, but I mean, even
[1:45:35] now, whatever we have need of.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; I have a lot of needs. I mean, we're
[1:45:41] needy people.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; We need God.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; We need God to do something. We're in a
[1:45:46] dark hour. We're under the greatest
[1:45:48] assault we've ever been in.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; We see the world falling apart. We see
[1:45:52] everything's coming to an end.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; But we're coming to our beginning.
[1:45:57] Amen.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Listen, listen. The Philippian church
[1:46:00] said, he says, "God gives us exceeding
[1:46:03] and great precious promises. He has
[1:46:05] promised to fulfill them. He will, but
[1:46:09] from the time but from the time we pray
[1:46:13] until the time we get the answer, we
[1:46:15] must learn to receive patience."
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; He said, "Enter our souls. For only in
[1:46:21] patience do we possess life."
[1:46:25] He said, "May God help us to learn this
[1:46:27] lesson even now, even as we know the
[1:46:31] people of this sixth age learn
[1:46:33] patience." We read history of the lives
[1:46:37] of the great Christians. What a contrast
[1:46:40] we see between lives
[1:46:43] and ours. For they were so patient and
[1:46:47] quiet.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Yes. And today we are all but overcome
[1:46:51] and over impatient
[1:46:55] and haste.
[1:46:58] Ain't that what he told Daniel?
[1:47:01] He said, "I've come to wear the saints
[1:47:03] out."
[1:47:05] He said, "Wire you out." But the Bible
[1:47:07] said, "Be patient there. Be patient.
[1:47:10] Wait on me. Understand I'm able to do
[1:47:13] this." The Bible says Matthew 21:22
[1:47:15] says, "All things whatsoever ye ask in
[1:47:18] prayer believing ye shall receive."
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Listen to what the prophet said in the
[1:47:23] message, "No, thou knowest all things."
[1:47:24] He says, "Now see what prayer does.
[1:47:28] Prayer is not exactly bringing God down
[1:47:30] to man. It's bringing man up to God."
[1:47:32] See, as you pray, you lose sight of
[1:47:36] these earthly things. you sway out into
[1:47:40] somewhere else way beyond on and on and
[1:47:44] on till you
[1:47:46] come into his presence. He said and then
[1:47:49] faith that you have laid it out before
[1:47:52] God. Now here he said God is here. He
[1:47:56] said I want to get well for this cause.
[1:47:59] I want to do this for me for this cause.
[1:48:02] I want to heal. I want you to heal me
[1:48:04] from cancer or TB or amnesia condition
[1:48:08] or whatever.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; He said, I will walk before you. I will
[1:48:12] do everything I can. I will give this
[1:48:14] testimony everywhere. I will be happy to
[1:48:17] do that, Lord. And I will use my life
[1:48:20] not for myself. I will use it for your
[1:48:23] glory to help others see. Now then you
[1:48:27] lay your life before God and say God
[1:48:31] oh my look how be will you consider my
[1:48:35] case.
[1:48:36] He said, "Even now
[1:48:39] I consider your case.
[1:48:41] If you lay your life before me and say,
[1:48:43] God, I'm not wanting this for myself,
[1:48:47] but I'm wanting you to do this that I
[1:48:48] might work for you better. That I might
[1:48:51] have the health that I might have the
[1:48:53] health to serve you better. That I might
[1:48:56] be able to do to be able to help others
[1:48:59] go more places, do more things. God, I'm
[1:49:01] not asking this selfishly, but I'm
[1:49:04] asking you, Lord. Will you please
[1:49:06] consider my case?
[1:49:09] Oh, glory be to God. Ain't you glad we
[1:49:11] got a God that considers our case?
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Considers it when we ask him.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. Ain't you thankful
[1:49:17] for the power of God?
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; The power of God to restore us back.
[1:49:20] Consider my case, Lord. I'm not asking
[1:49:23] you to do this just for me as selfish,
[1:49:26] but father I'm asking just that it might
[1:49:28] let me be serve you better without being
[1:49:31] so sickly and so wore down and and in
[1:49:34] such pain God. But will you do it where
[1:49:38] I may give you more praise?
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; I may give you more honor that I may
[1:49:43] give you more glory, Lord. That father I
[1:49:45] might be able to do it with happiness
[1:49:48] and joy and be able to tell Lord look
[1:49:52] what thou has done.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Look what you've done
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; father and knowing that if he does it
[1:49:59] you do it for me rather Lord that you
[1:50:02] they'll have faith that you'll do it for
[1:50:03] them also.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Teaching of Moses he said you children
[1:50:10] know what Tor is when they're fixing the
[1:50:13] streets you know. Oh, he said, "Oh, that
[1:50:15] awful smell." He said, "It shouts shouts
[1:50:19] out the cracks in the street." And
[1:50:20] that's that's the way this does. It
[1:50:23] shuts out all the all the water. And
[1:50:26] that's what prayer does for the
[1:50:29] believer.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; That's what keeps the world out of you.
[1:50:33] It's when you pitch yourself on your
[1:50:36] knees and say, "Lord Jesus," and the
[1:50:41] blood comes down and seals you all up so
[1:50:44] the devil can't can't get you. See,
[1:50:47] that's right. See, oh then, oh, many
[1:50:49] times people go around and say, "It's
[1:50:52] awful." But that don't make any
[1:50:54] difference. It keeps you safe. See,
[1:50:57] that's the main thing. Keep safe. He
[1:51:00] says, "Say you're oldfashioned. That
[1:51:02] doesn't matter. He's keeping us, brother
[1:51:04] Amos.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; He's keeping us in this hour. Thirsting
[1:51:07] for life. He said that's that's the way
[1:51:09] the devil does. He will cut off your
[1:51:11] prayer meetings.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Cut off your altar at your home, too.
[1:51:18] He'll cut off your prayer. That's the
[1:51:19] greatest weapon we have against Satan.
[1:51:21] And that's the thing he's battling you
[1:51:22] for to get you so busy you won't pray.
[1:51:26] And brother Brand said, "You going to
[1:51:27] get closer to God?" He didn't say, he
[1:51:28] said made it so simple for us. He said,
[1:51:31] "Read your Bible and pray."
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; And that's the thing Satan fights you
[1:51:36] the most of. When you go to reading your
[1:51:38] Bible,
[1:51:41] but we can we can look at other we can
[1:51:43] read newspapers or this or that. This
[1:51:46] man enjoys it. He don't never get sleep.
[1:51:48] But it's amazing. Every time you pick up
[1:51:51] the word of God or a message book or you
[1:51:52] start playing a tape or you start
[1:51:54] listening to preaching or something,
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; preach.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; I like I'm like, Satan,
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; brother,
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; get behind me.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; That's the devil trying to rob you from
[1:52:06] receiving what God's given.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; We all do. That's we have to battle
[1:52:10] that, brothers and sisters.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Say, we got to shake it off and say,
[1:52:13] "Wait a minute, God. If you'll just say
[1:52:16] one word,
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; that's enough to sustain me." Amen.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; One word from you means more than
[1:52:22] anything.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; But that's what he b that's what he
[1:52:24] fights you again. He said
[1:52:28] he said that's what the devil keeps you.
[1:52:31] He he said he's done cut off the
[1:52:34] hamstrings right then. He said you'll
[1:52:37] pull around the church like that and
[1:52:39] you'll run from here to there. But
[1:52:42] anytime the devil wants you to gobble to
[1:52:44] gobble you up, he said he's got you
[1:52:46] under his control. When he cuts your
[1:52:49] prayer life off, brother, you're gone.
[1:52:53] He said, "That's right." When he cuts
[1:52:55] that thirst off of you and perverts it
[1:52:58] into the things of the world, he's got
[1:53:00] you where he wants you.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; He will let you gobble along here till
[1:53:07] you get to a certain place, then crash
[1:53:10] your life without God right there.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. H what he wants you to do is let
[1:53:17] him drive.
[1:53:19] And I say these things they say Jesus is
[1:53:22] my co-pilot. And I thought my if he
[1:53:24] don't drive, brother, I don't ride.
[1:53:27] If he ain't driving, brother, I don't
[1:53:28] get in the car.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; But we'll jump in the car of the world.
[1:53:34] We'll ride around with our friends and
[1:53:36] our family and go to places we shouldn't
[1:53:39] go and do things we shouldn't do. And
[1:53:41] Satan's just a goblin. He says, "Keep
[1:53:44] on." Do you know what it is? I like I
[1:53:46] looked at this one time. I was studying
[1:53:48] on this and I looked at this and it's
[1:53:50] powerful, brother. Just simple things
[1:53:52] are so powerful that we we got so much
[1:53:55] so many weapons to use, but yet we look
[1:53:57] at them and say, "Well, I don't know if
[1:53:58] that work." It works.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; And you know what? I was looking at that
[1:54:02] and you know what we get? He wants us to
[1:54:04] be busy, busy, busy, busy. You ever been
[1:54:07] praying and people just your phone don't
[1:54:09] ring all day, but when you go to pray,
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; everybody starts calling. You go to
[1:54:13] reading your Bible, everybody calls and
[1:54:16] they ain't want to talk about nothing.
[1:54:17] They just want to talk. And you know, I
[1:54:20] was looking at that. You know, I think
[1:54:21] about that. You know what busy is? I
[1:54:24] like how one man illustrated busy. Busy
[1:54:27] is being under Satan's yoke.
[1:54:32] When you're too busy to pray and read
[1:54:33] your Bible, Brother Amos,
[1:54:36] you're too busy
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; to receive the promises of God. And all
[1:54:41] he asks you to do is pray and believe
[1:54:44] and ask what you will. But he's got us
[1:54:46] too, he can even get us too busy
[1:54:48] preaching. Sometimes we go and go and go
[1:54:50] and go and we don't take time to pray.
[1:54:55] We get wore out, too. I tell them, I
[1:54:58] tell them, "Hey, I'm not going. I'm
[1:55:00] going to church Wednesday night.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; I can't go every time. I mean, if
[1:55:04] they're sick, I'm going to do it." But I
[1:55:05] said, "I got to quit. I can't I can't We
[1:55:08] can't go everywhere.
[1:55:10] I mean, I know we got a prayer life
[1:55:12] every day, but we need to hear the word,
[1:55:13] too. Preachers need to sit under
[1:55:15] ministry.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah, they do.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah, they do.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Ain't that what brother Brandon said?
[1:55:19] You got to have a pastor.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; If you ain't got a pastor, you don't
[1:55:24] need to be preaching.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; I said, "Preacher, I preaching." I said,
[1:55:27] "Where's your pastor? I ain't got one."
[1:55:28] I said, "Then what are you preaching
[1:55:29] for?"
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Brand said, "Don't do it,
[1:55:31] brother. What? You can't You know what?
[1:55:33] I've learned this and God showed me
[1:55:35] this. You know what? If you don't if you
[1:55:37] don't never learn how to follow, you'll
[1:55:39] never learn how to lead.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; That's exactly.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Pick up your cross and
[1:55:43] follow me."
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; And we want everybody to follow us, but
[1:55:48] we don't want to follow Christ.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; Ain't you thankful for the power of God?
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful for his grace and
[1:55:57] his mercy?
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; I won't hold you much longer. But what
[1:56:00] about that? Even now, if we seem like we
[1:56:03] just can't can't get no further than
[1:56:06] seem like we ain't going to make it.
[1:56:09] Even now, if we'll come to God and say,
[1:56:11] "God, I failed you. I made a mistake,
[1:56:15] Lord. I've been too busy." And it not be
[1:56:19] bad things, being good.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; And he told us not to be weary and
[1:56:23] welloing. But you know what the greatest
[1:56:26] thing is? To take time with God.
[1:56:29] It's like if you're married to a wife
[1:56:31] and you don't never tell her you love
[1:56:32] her. You don't never tell her how much
[1:56:34] you appreciate her. Just think about a
[1:56:37] wife is she'd never tell her husband. He
[1:56:38] come off of work or whatever he's doing
[1:56:40] and she'd never say, "Hey, I appreciate
[1:56:42] you, honey. I love you." You know, when
[1:56:44] the first thing I do when I pray, I
[1:56:46] said, "Lord, I love you. I thank you,
[1:56:49] Lord. I'm unworthy. I don't have
[1:56:51] anything good that I could offer you
[1:56:52] that you'd accept me. But, Father, only
[1:56:55] thing I can come with is your blood.
[1:56:57] your blood atoning for me, Lord. I And
[1:56:59] we fail him every day. Brother Br said,
[1:57:01] we even fail him after we receive the
[1:57:02] Holy Ghost. We even sin.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; We know to do better. And Satan will
[1:57:07] trick us. And we think I think, oh my,
[1:57:09] how come I fell for that again?
[1:57:13] Cuz I just didn't pray enough.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; Preach.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; I just didn't pray. Didn't take time to
[1:57:18] say, God, I can't make it through this
[1:57:20] day without you. Father, there's many
[1:57:23] traps out there. There's many
[1:57:25] shipwrecks. as many crashes, but God, if
[1:57:28] you'll turn on that GPS called the Holy
[1:57:31] Spirit in my heart and father, I can
[1:57:34] stay connected with you and I can go
[1:57:36] with you and listen to you. You know the
[1:57:38] first thing when we on that GPS, God
[1:57:40] showed me this. I preached a funeral one
[1:57:41] time, which we don't believe that saint,
[1:57:43] but I did a funeral one time and you
[1:57:44] know the first I believe that Lord
[1:57:46] showed me that you know the first thing
[1:57:47] we used to have those garments or
[1:57:49] whatever they was the first thing you
[1:57:50] had to do was you had to push I agree to
[1:57:52] follow the instructions.
[1:57:55] Ain't that how we get the Holy Ghost?
[1:57:56] Total obedience to every word.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; Push that button. Say, "I agree, Lord."
[1:58:00] And then we follow the directions
[1:58:03] heading to where he knows where we need
[1:58:07] to be.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; And I'm glad sometimes, brother, brother
[1:58:10] Amos, I'll get over there a little bit
[1:58:11] and that that I can hear that voice say,
[1:58:14] "Recalculating.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; You have made the wrong turn.
[1:58:20] You need to go
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; the other way." Ain't that what the
[1:58:24] prophet said when he screaming out and
[1:58:25] he'd get out of line, he'd say, "Stay in
[1:58:27] line." That's what the Holy Ghost is.
[1:58:28] He's keeping us in line. And you know,
[1:58:30] when my mother, she passed away not long
[1:58:32] ago, 99 years old, brothers, served the
[1:58:35] Lord. Thank God that I was a part of
[1:58:38] that fifth gospel to have a mother that
[1:58:40] would train me. It didn't never I I may
[1:58:42] have walked got away, but it it never
[1:58:45] left me. I'd go to do something, brother
[1:58:47] Amos, and I'd hear that voice, you know
[1:58:49] better than that. I said, "Mom, I can't
[1:58:51] get away with nothing." And you know
[1:58:52] what she'd tell me? The way of a
[1:58:54] transgressor is hard, son.
[1:58:57] I said, "Oh, mom, I thought she'd pet me
[1:58:59] or you know, you think want some." She
[1:59:02] said, "No, when you serve God, then
[1:59:05] you'll see how much more you'll get from
[1:59:07] God."
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; You know, and she just kept telling me
[1:59:10] what she didn't compromise because I was
[1:59:11] my son. I was her son. She just kept
[1:59:13] telling me what the truth said. She kept
[1:59:15] hanging in there. She said, "I just kept
[1:59:17] praying and believing. I knew you'd come
[1:59:19] one day because I knew he gave you to me
[1:59:22] and I gave him back to you.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; And I said, I knew, Father, you'd bring
[1:59:26] him one day. But you know, when I was
[1:59:28] preaching that and I was thinking about
[1:59:29] that, Brother Amos, and I said, you know
[1:59:32] what, I said about about 4:30 that
[1:59:36] Monday afternoon, Brother Amos, she had
[1:59:38] had that GPS running in her soul all
[1:59:41] them years. And I said, she heard that
[1:59:43] voice say, "You have reached your
[1:59:47] destination.
[1:59:49] True.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. You know what? I can
[1:59:53] hear it.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; I can hear it through the spirit of God
[1:59:57] saying, "You have reached your
[1:59:59] destination.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; This message is your destination." Jesus
[2:00:04] Christ is this message.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; One day he's going to say, "You've
[2:00:10] reached your destination.
[2:00:14] Enter into my rest, my good and faithful
[2:00:17] servant.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; You have.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; Oh my boy. When I when God brought me to
[2:00:24] this message, they tried to tell me say,
[2:00:27] "Well, Brother Brandham didn't save
[2:00:28] you." I said, "I never said he did." I
[2:00:30] said, "Brother Brand couldn't save
[2:00:31] yourself." I said, "But I'll tell you
[2:00:32] one thing this message did for me,
[2:00:34] Brother Amos. You know what this message
[2:00:37] did? It introduced me to Jesus Christ."
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; And you know what? You know what? When
[2:00:43] the when the Lord got a hold of me, he
[2:00:46] didn't take me to the Memphis church, no
[2:00:48] offense to the Baptist, but you know
[2:00:51] where he did? He brought me right back.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; Where I was.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; And I said, if I couldn't deny it when I
[2:00:58] wasn't living right, God, how can I deny
[2:01:00] it now? Woo. Glory be to God.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; How can we deny it now
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; when we're reaching our destination?
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; This thing's almost over.
[2:01:12] Amen.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit says, "Run,
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; run.
[2:01:17] It's almost over."
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ain't you thankful for the
[2:01:23] grace of God?
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; Even now, God's encouraging us.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; He does a great cloud of witnesses
[2:01:29] hauling for us. Keep running, Brother
[2:01:32] Amos. Keep running, Brother Will. Keep
[2:01:34] pressing the battle.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; It's almost over. Hallelujah.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; It's not him that width or him that
[2:01:41] runth, but it's God that showeth mercy.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "I have run the race. I have
[2:01:46] kept the faith."
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; Therefore, therefore now,
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; there's a crown of righteousness laid up
[2:01:54] for me.
[2:01:56] He said, "I fought a good fight."
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. I want to have that testimony.
[2:02:00] Don't you, brother?
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; I want to be able to say that, brother
[2:02:03] Amos. I fought a good fight.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:02:07] I got knocked down a lot. I might got
[2:02:09] knocked down in several battles, but I'm
[2:02:11] winning the war.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; I'm winning the war.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; Cuz he won the war.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; He's caused me to win.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; Let us stand. Ain't you thankful?
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. that even in the darkest hour,
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; in the lowest place,
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; in your greatest trial, even now,
[2:02:35] he can do it.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; When all hope is gone, when everything
[2:02:40] has failed you, he said, "I'll never
[2:02:43] leave you. I'll never forsake you.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; I'll even be with you, even in you to
[2:02:48] the end." That's right.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; I'm going to cause you to win.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; Oh my. What words he told us, brother
[2:02:55] Amos? He said, "You'll overcome by the
[2:02:59] blood of the lamb."
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; And the word of your testimony. My
[2:03:03] testimony is greater as he that's in me
[2:03:05] than he that's in this world. The blood
[2:03:07] of Jesus coverth me from all sin.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; Jesus have called me. He have chosen me.
[2:03:13] He has elected me. He has predestinated
[2:03:16] me.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank brothers and sisters. He
[2:03:19] handpicked you for this age.
[2:03:22] One brother said, "If we'd have known
[2:03:23] the end of this thing, we'd have
[2:03:25] volunteered for it." And I began to
[2:03:26] think about that, brother. I be to think
[2:03:28] about that, brother Amos. I said, "We'd
[2:03:30] have volunteered for that." But you know
[2:03:32] what the Holy Spirit said? You did. You
[2:03:35] know why? Cuz you was there in my mind.
[2:03:37] And I thought of you being there in
[2:03:39] Leodia.
[2:03:42] Hallelujah.
[2:03:43] I thought of you being there cuz I knew
[2:03:45] you'd overcome.
[2:03:47] Because I've gi you everything you need
[2:03:49] to overcome with when I give you my Holy
[2:03:51] Spirit.
[2:03:53] He said, "Even now,
[2:03:55] even now, I can do whatever you need me
[2:03:58] to do." Ain't you thankful for a God
[2:04:01] like that?
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; Even when all hope's gone, the doctor's
[2:04:04] gone, this is gone, that's gone. He
[2:04:07] said, "Even now, I'm able. If you'll
[2:04:11] just ask me, he said, "Is anything too
[2:04:13] hard for me?" I like what one man said.
[2:04:15] He said, "God specializes in the
[2:04:18] impossibilities."
[2:04:21] He said, "All things are possible to
[2:04:24] know through."
[2:04:26] I said, "Satan, I can't understand
[2:04:28] everything. I can't explain everything.
[2:04:31] But I tell you one thing I can do,
[2:04:33] Satan. I believe it all. I believe every
[2:04:36] bit of it. From tit to tit, from line to
[2:04:40] line, word to word, from chapter to
[2:04:42] chapter, from verse to verse. I believe
[2:04:45] it all. And you know what? By believing
[2:04:48] it, I've seen if I've asked him to help
[2:04:50] me, I've seen him through the years,
[2:04:52] brother. I've seen him reveal it to you.
[2:04:56] Oh my. He said, just put it up there for
[2:04:59] a little bit. It It's not time yet,
[2:05:01] Amos. It's not time yet, but the time
[2:05:04] has now come.
[2:05:06] We know all things.
[2:05:09] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; All things is Jesus Christ. The same
[2:05:12] yesterday, today, and forever. Every
[2:05:15] head bowed, every eye closed.
[2:05:17] Someone have a need this morning and
[2:05:20] say, "God, even now, I believe I can
[2:05:22] hand it. I can raise my hand and
[2:05:24] surrender, offering it to you, and you
[2:05:27] will defeat my enemy. You'll destroy my
[2:05:30] enemy." Oh my. Didn't God tell Abraham,
[2:05:34] "Ye shall possess the gates of your
[2:05:37] enemy." That's this flesh, man. Brothers
[2:05:39] and sisters, this flesh, we're going to
[2:05:41] possess him.
[2:05:44] We're going to possess him. He's going
[2:05:45] to take on a new body one day. Father,
[2:05:49] Lord, we ask you to help us this
[2:05:51] morning, Father. We thank you, Lord.
[2:05:52] Lord, may you take this little thought,
[2:05:54] Lord, through the week, Lord, and even
[2:05:56] when the Satan had come in. those words
[2:05:59] come back to us, Lord. Even now, Lord,
[2:06:03] even now,
[2:06:05] Lord, though you slay me, yet I trust
[2:06:08] you. Father, where else could we go? To
[2:06:11] whom else could we serve? To whom could
[2:06:14] we believe? For thou has the words of
[2:06:16] eternal life. Where can we go, Lord?
[2:06:19] Father, we come to you now this morning,
[2:06:21] Lord, asking you, Lord, to answer the
[2:06:23] needs of your children, Lord. Father,
[2:06:26] there's nothing too hard for you.
[2:06:28] There's no limits to you, Lord. There's
[2:06:30] nothing holding you back, Father. The
[2:06:33] only thing, Lord, is for us to ask and
[2:06:35] ask of believing that we receive it and
[2:06:39] then we start thanking you for it and
[2:06:41] then you bring it to pass, God. It's
[2:06:43] that simple for us, Lord. Let us do
[2:06:46] that, Lord. Bless Brother Amos, Lord,
[2:06:47] and gift you give him and all these
[2:06:49] other brothers and sisters in here,
[2:06:51] Lord, and bless brother Shawn. Oh, God.
[2:06:53] May we wave that banner so much higher
[2:06:55] than we have been. May we wave that
[2:06:58] blood stain banner and say, "Jesus,
[2:07:00] Jesus has not left us. He's still here.
[2:07:04] You're still working through your
[2:07:06] children. You're still saving. You're
[2:07:08] still delivering. You're still healing.
[2:07:11] Oh God, you're unchangeable, Lord. And
[2:07:14] Father, as we think about that this
[2:07:15] morning, knowing that you're
[2:07:16] unchangeable in all of your ways, and if
[2:07:19] your thought was for us to be saved,
[2:07:22] it's never been changed." Oh, God. Thank
[2:07:25] you for that, Lord. Your thought was us
[2:07:27] to be your bride. Then nothing, no
[2:07:29] devil, no demon, no power can stop us
[2:07:33] from accomplishing what you've seen.
[2:07:36] Your your your Oh Jesus, you said I come
[2:07:39] to do the father's will. Now God, let us
[2:07:42] do your will. We ask it in Jesus
[2:07:44] Christ's name. Amen. Amen.

[2:11:33] tells me so.
[2:11:36] Many souls has been his prey to fall in
[2:11:42] some weak hour.
[2:11:44] But God has promised us today his
