[42:53] presence forever and ever
[42:55] and think of just praising him with no
[42:58] mind battles and no sickness and nothing
[43:02] there to try to distract us a man and um
[43:06] but while we're here we're going to
[43:09] praise him with everything we've got
[43:11] amen and the musicians can be dismissed
[43:13] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[43:16] and trust you all
[43:20] are satisfied being in the house of the
[43:22] Lord I tell you what as the psalmist
[43:25] said I was glad when they said unto me
[43:28] let us go and it just Thrills our hearts
[43:32] to come and to be with God's people and
[43:36] most of all just to be in his presence
[43:39] and entertain him and been a little
[43:43] windy today
[43:45] but
[43:46] we didn't get blowed away so this is
[43:49] good
[43:52] tree you know they're close to my office
[43:56] and it's leaning a little bit my way and
[44:00] I was like oh Lord

[44:06] and so it's still up so thank the Lord
[44:09] for that if you have your Bibles we're

[44:36] so look forward to that and
[44:40] um
[44:41] so and of course we'll be having two
[44:44] Services Sunday

[44:52] that praise the Lord
[44:54] before we go into the word let's just
[44:56] bow our heads and talk to
[44:58] our precious father
[45:01] Lord Jesus
[45:03] we come in thy name
[45:06] for it's in thy name Lord that
[45:10] demons flee the sick are healed
[45:14] the lame walk it's in thy name Lord
[45:18] that we stand here
[45:21] Lord undefiled and we stand here with
[45:25] faith
[45:27] lord it's in thy name that we've come
[45:30] tonight and Lord we're just under great
[45:33] expectation
[45:35] for you just to speak to us Lord for we
[45:39] know that it's by Thy word Lord that we
[45:43] overcome and
[45:45] lord it's by Thy word Lord that Satan is
[45:50] defeated anywhere anytime under any
[45:53] condition
[45:55] and Lord we pray that your word would
[45:58] just be planted in our hearts let it be
[46:01] anchored father
[46:03] and oh I pray that you would just anoint
[46:06] myself anoint me the gift that you've
[46:09] placed within me and help me just to get
[46:12] myself out of the way father
[46:15] and Lord may you just speak through this
[46:18] these lips of clay and I pray that you
[46:21] would anoint every year in Heart Lord
[46:24] of your people and any spirit that would
[46:27] try to hinder this service I pray that
[46:30] you would just drive it out of this
[46:33] building and that that your people could
[46:36] have Liberty Lord to hear from you and
[46:40] to receive we ask it in Jesus Christ's
[46:43] name and the church says amen you can
[46:48] not have your seats yet we're going to
[46:50] read
[46:51] uh Psalms
[46:53] chapter 23 start at the first verse
[46:58] but it says the Lord is my shepherd
[47:02] I shall not want he maketh me to lie
[47:05] down in Green Pastures
[47:08] he leadeth me beside the Still Waters
[47:11] and he restoreth my soul I'm going to
[47:16] just stop right there and you can have
[47:18] your seats now
[47:19] praise the Lord
[47:22] but um
[47:24] my uh desire is that you'll be
[47:27] encouraged tonight and and strengthened
[47:30] and I'm sure the things that you've that
[47:35] I'll say is something you've heard but
[47:37] maybe it will just bring to your
[47:41] remembrance and solidify your heart
[47:44] into these things because I I believe
[47:46] it's so important to to be established
[47:50] in the the word in the age that we're
[47:53] living in
[47:55] and we we realize that we're living in
[47:59] the time uh of restoration of all things
[48:03] as we said before quoted brother Branham
[48:06] he's saying that this is the age of of
[48:10] restoration
[48:11] and uh there in I believe the
[48:15] Masterpiece I think it was there or
[48:19] um
[48:20] well trying to think of the other sermon
[48:24] but I've been listening to both of them
[48:26] but he says to restore is to bring back
[48:29] to to who really owns it uh to bring it
[48:34] back to its natural estate where it was
[48:37] at the first time to bring it back into
[48:40] its natural condition
[48:42] and I guess because that man is made in
[48:46] the image of God
[48:47] um he uh um you know he has this desire
[48:52] within him even though he is a sinner
[48:55] and unconverted but he has this desire
[48:59] to restore things
[49:01] and um you know I I think it's neat how
[49:04] that men would will take these old cars
[49:07] that uh maybe run down and and
[49:12] uh you know I I can remember and uh uh a
[49:18] man uh I think he was in in uh
[49:22] there in South Carolina and he drove all
[49:25] the way to to Oklahoma to pick up an old
[49:28] car and and he took pictures and so when
[49:31] I went to to
[49:33] minister at his church he showed it to
[49:36] me and and uh and and and the car had a
[49:40] tree big tree sticking out of it you
[49:43] know and uh uh out of the the hood there
[49:46] and and uh just you know it just looked
[49:49] like it was no hope whatsoever and then
[49:53] he takes me in in the garage and and and
[49:56] it's a beautiful car and I'm like wow
[49:59] you know how in the world did you do
[50:00] that uh and but he spent a lot of time a
[50:04] lot of Labor a lot of things uh trying
[50:08] to restore uh these things and so uh all
[50:13] the parts that they would put on the
[50:14] vehicle you know they if they're going
[50:17] to restore it they they want the exact
[50:19] same kind a replica or uh something that
[50:24] uh the the factory originally put on
[50:27] that vehicle uh years ago and so they'll
[50:31] they'll they'll put the same kind of
[50:33] Tire on it they'll put the same kind of
[50:36] mirror on it they'll they'll put this
[50:38] you know try to get the same uh color of
[50:42] paint that it did it originally had and
[50:44] but the same kind of seats and and
[50:47] different things and so whatever is
[50:49] broken then they'll replace it uh with
[50:52] something that
[50:54] um uh looks as like the original because
[50:58] they want everything to be just exactly
[51:00] alike uh uh there and so it's also the
[51:05] same thing when they
[51:07] um uh they do a building uh they there's
[51:11] those that will restore a building and
[51:14] uh they'll they'll try to do everything
[51:16] just exactly uh the way it was before uh
[51:22] uh it all got messed up or or whatever
[51:25] uh they'll put the exact pink color or
[51:28] try to find that that wallpaper or uh or
[51:32] refinish the woods of the wood or or or
[51:35] things like that and and that way that
[51:38] when you look at it you you have the you
[51:41] have the idea of what it was in the
[51:44] beginning and and and that's fine and
[51:47] that's good and that's but that's not
[51:49] restoration when you really think about
[51:51] it uh because no one no one can really
[51:55] restore like God can
[51:59] and so if it wasn't for him having the
[52:03] ability to restore uh then we we would
[52:07] be of all men most miserable we we would
[52:10] just be without any hope because God for
[52:13] one is not in the business of shopping
[52:16] and and around he's not in the business
[52:20] of replacing uh uh uh that which was
[52:25] broken and shattered and lost and uh uh
[52:29] because we we know that as the prophet
[52:32] would tell us no one can take your place
[52:34] and and you can't take another person's
[52:38] Place ain't that right and and so then
[52:41] you're not a replacement amen you're not
[52:45] a replacement for somebody and someone
[52:47] is the other person is not a replacement
[52:50] for you there there can be no
[52:53] replacement ain't that right and so then
[52:56] uh uh God is able to to literally take
[53:01] that which is broken which is helpless
[53:04] which is which is totally impossible uh
[53:08] uh uh uh to to be restored and yet he
[53:13] will take that and restore it because
[53:15] what what's the point of shopping when
[53:18] no one can take your place can you say
[53:20] man and so God made it that way and and
[53:24] so when when God restores he is the only
[53:28] one that can give the true meaning of
[53:31] what justification really means and that
[53:34] is you never done it in the first place
[53:37] now could you imagine standing there in
[53:41] in in in that place as we are if that
[53:44] could ever be a real reality to us that
[53:48] God's restoration is so complete and so
[53:52] thorough and so perfect that it's as
[53:55] though you've never done it in the first
[53:57] place now he can put you that way and
[54:00] and he is putting that church in that
[54:04] same way can you say man and so we're
[54:07] not talking about God uh uh replacing
[54:10] One Soul with another we're not into two
[54:13] so Doctrine amen but David said he
[54:17] restoreth my soul can you say man a soul
[54:21] that was lost a soul that was broken a
[54:24] soul that was so tattered and and vile
[54:26] and and sinful and and controlled by the
[54:30] devil and yet God would take that same
[54:33] soul and restore it ain't that right
[54:36] another way of restoring is if something
[54:40] that belonged to you was in the pawn
[54:42] shop and and you decided to go get that
[54:46] amen and so you paid the price of of uh
[54:51] for that something that once belonged to
[54:53] you and you bring it back ain't that
[54:56] right you take it out of of
[54:59] of the pawn shop and you put it back to
[55:01] where it was in the first place that's
[55:04] actually a an act of restoration amen
[55:07] the prophet talked about that ain't that
[55:09] right amen and that's why I would ask
[55:11] how can I be saved and in the pawn shop
[55:13] at the same time or how can I be in the
[55:15] Sean pawn shop and redeemed at the same
[55:18] time you can't do that ain't that right
[55:20] so also in the Old Testament when
[55:24] thinking of restoring we see that God uh
[55:27] uh through the ministry of Joshua
[55:30] divided up the land and gave a portion
[55:33] of that land to uh the tribe of Israel
[55:36] and there were 12 tribes and so it was
[55:39] given to them as an inheritance and was
[55:43] to stay in the family it was to stay
[55:46] within that that that tribe and so uh uh
[55:51] but but we find that not only God would
[55:54] give him that them that land and divide
[55:57] up the inheritance but he came my God
[55:59] would come up not man God came up with
[56:03] this law of redemption amen and and it
[56:07] was for them just in case and this is
[56:10] the whole story again of redemption
[56:13] between God and us but but he would
[56:15] provide this law of redemption for the
[56:18] just in case some poor uh uh some man he
[56:22] he got in a bind financially or or
[56:25] whatever and he lost that land he he had
[56:29] to give that land up a man for some
[56:32] unfortunate reason and and so this is an
[56:36] act of Grace on God's part ain't that
[56:39] right and and and and and so what one
[56:42] thing uh this does to us it shows us
[56:45] that the things that God has given us in
[56:49] his word he means for us to keep it can
[56:53] you say Amen what the things the
[56:56] promises the uh the blessings that God
[56:59] has given to us in his word he means for
[57:03] us to keep that amen but it also means
[57:07] that what rightfully belongs to God Amen
[57:11] he means to keep it as well can you say
[57:14] amen amen and so through the law of
[57:17] redemption that we see uh in Israel we
[57:20] understand God's heart we understand
[57:22] God's ability we understand God's
[57:25] purpose of redemption and so brother
[57:28] Branham begins to explain a man this law
[57:31] of redemption in Israel he says if if
[57:34] this man got poor and lost anything to
[57:37] another man all the only way it could be
[57:40] redeemed would be by a near Kinsman
[57:43] ain't that right but it finally it
[57:47] finally must come back so he says this
[57:50] man only holds it for a certain amount
[57:53] of time the man that he sold the
[57:55] property to can only hold it for a
[57:58] certain amount of time time he said see
[58:00] that's under that law of redemption it
[58:03] must come back everybody say it must
[58:05] come back
[58:07] to the original owner amen he says it
[58:10] must go back to the original owner if
[58:13] they was out of the tribe of Judah if he
[58:16] was there and this was allotted to his
[58:18] father then it was it was to him or some
[58:21] near Kinsmen so the dad lost that
[58:24] property and and and uh uh he he got in
[58:28] a financial bind or whatever and and he
[58:31] had to sell it or he had to give it over
[58:33] because he owed a man so much money and
[58:36] and there was no way that he could buy
[58:38] that property back he just had not that
[58:40] ability so now he's out of the picture
[58:43] he in other words he lost that in and
[58:46] you know uh uh to think of it
[58:49] what a horrible thing it would be a man
[58:52] to be that Daddy and here's you've got a
[58:55] son and you've lost the the land and
[58:58] you're thinking now what am I going to
[58:59] do amen where am I going to live what
[59:02] what is my children going to do what
[59:04] what I've lost it all that that had been
[59:06] and down handed down from my granddaddy
[59:09] and great-granddad and all the way down
[59:12] to me and here I failed and and all of
[59:14] these things but God provided a a law of
[59:18] redemption a man see and so uh uh so we
[59:23] find that that near Kinsman uh could
[59:26] take it he says now nobody else could
[59:28] rightly so if I've lost my land brother
[59:31] Andrew and and I I ain't gotten away to
[59:34] to get it back well you couldn't come
[59:36] and get it amen if I sold it to brother
[59:38] Kevin and and and and and and and uh
[59:41] brother Kevin is using it and and you go
[59:44] and say well I want to buy it and he
[59:46] says no I ain't going to sell it and
[59:47] well you you can't buy it it's just uh
[59:50] it's just the way it is ain't that right
[59:52] a man see and so brother Kevin could
[59:55] hold that piece of property until the
[59:58] debt was paid ain't that rhyme that's
[1:00:00] what brother Branham said but when the
[1:00:03] right man come along see so he says he
[1:00:06] explained is how this works he said see
[1:00:09] for instance if I owned a piece of
[1:00:11] property I lost it I sold it over to
[1:00:13] brother Neville which is of another
[1:00:15] tribe of Judah or or maybe sold it to an
[1:00:18] alien and he had rightfully owned it he
[1:00:21] he owned it he could come in there and
[1:00:24] farm it and take the goods off of it and
[1:00:27] so forth but really he just held the
[1:00:30] deed see he could not own it see so he
[1:00:34] he right he really couldn't own it amen
[1:00:37] he said that was the law in Israel can
[1:00:40] you say Amen so so you can hold the deed
[1:00:43] amen and you could live off that land
[1:00:45] you could work the land you could do all
[1:00:47] of that but back in in your mind you've
[1:00:49] got to understand that one day anir
[1:00:51] Kinsman is coming and he's going to
[1:00:54] claim that property now you may say no
[1:00:56] to brother Andrew and you may say no to
[1:00:58] to uh to brother Matthew and you may say
[1:01:01] no to uh uh sister Jane and all of these
[1:01:04] and by right you can do that but if my
[1:01:07] son Daniel comes and says brother Kevin
[1:01:09] I want that land amen that belonged to
[1:01:12] my dad you couldn't argue with it you
[1:01:14] you you couldn't do nothing amen because
[1:01:17] a near Kinsman had come to claim that
[1:01:20] property can you say man so this is what
[1:01:23] brother Branham is saying he says see
[1:01:25] now if this was my next Kinsman my blood
[1:01:28] relation he could not hold it any longer
[1:01:31] see no sir he had to give it over when
[1:01:35] that price was paid and when he uh gave
[1:01:38] him say 25 000 for the piece of property
[1:01:41] well then say brother Tony would come
[1:01:43] over and say brother Neville I'll buy
[1:01:45] brother branham's property he says well
[1:01:47] he couldn't do it see and and brother
[1:01:49] Neville says no sir I don't want to sell
[1:01:51] it he says well what did you give for it
[1:01:53] twenty five thousand well I'll give you
[1:01:55] 35. uh and and I'll give you so and so I
[1:01:58] don't care what you want to do he said I
[1:01:59] ain't gonna I don't want to sell it I'll
[1:02:01] keep it but let Billy Paul come along
[1:02:04] and say I want my daddy's possession
[1:02:06] here's your twenty five thousand amen no
[1:02:09] haggling no bargain nothing it it's it's
[1:02:13] settled it's done ain't that right see
[1:02:15] then that land that man that on that
[1:02:17] property had to let it go because that
[1:02:21] was the law of redemption now I hope I
[1:02:24] made that clear to you tonight amen the
[1:02:26] law of redemption the act of restoration
[1:02:29] ain't that right so God uh uh uh showing
[1:02:34] us in in in the Old Testament exactly
[1:02:37] what the law of redemption is amen see
[1:02:40] you were one time God's Property in the
[1:02:43] beginning you were God's Property ain't
[1:02:46] that right well and I'm going to say not
[1:02:48] just one time you've always been God's
[1:02:50] Property amen it's it's it's that way
[1:02:53] and and and you you say well how was
[1:02:55] that well brother Brown said we were
[1:02:57] with God in his thoughts at the
[1:03:00] beginning he called us and chose us in
[1:03:03] him before the foundation of the world
[1:03:05] and wrote our name aims before the
[1:03:08] foundation of the world so we were a
[1:03:10] part of God and attribute of God can you
[1:03:14] say Amen so so I want you to understand
[1:03:16] where you began from what you belong to
[1:03:19] and why God is so interested in you then
[1:03:22] you say amen he is interested in you he
[1:03:25] ain't just stealing you from the devil
[1:03:28] he has rights to claim you for his own
[1:03:31] now there's others he doesn't have
[1:03:33] rights to claim if you want to look at
[1:03:35] it that way amen see they were seeds of
[1:03:38] the devil serpent seed and and look at
[1:03:40] Cain and he was the son of perdition
[1:03:43] ain't that right but then there were
[1:03:45] people that were in the mind of God and
[1:03:48] God has every right to claim you back
[1:03:51] and and it's true that's right see so he
[1:03:55] says see we're an attribute of God
[1:03:57] because in the beginning was the word
[1:04:00] and a word is a thought expressed so we
[1:04:03] were his thoughts then expressed into
[1:04:06] word and became what we are that's the
[1:04:10] reason everybody say that's the reason
[1:04:12] our names he said maybe not what we have
[1:04:15] now but our names were put on the Lamb's
[1:04:18] Book of Life before the foundation of
[1:04:20] the world do you realize that is a
[1:04:23] record of God's book amen them names
[1:04:26] written in that Lamb's Book of Life has
[1:04:28] secured you as God's own property that's
[1:04:33] right see and so the prophet says that
[1:04:36] Jesus came to redeem all those names
[1:04:40] that were found written in that book now
[1:04:45] notice First Corinthians 6 20 it DePaul
[1:04:48] tells us we have been bought with a
[1:04:52] price ain't that right so we're not
[1:04:54] waiting to be bought with the prize we
[1:04:57] have been bought with the price so that
[1:05:00] tells us there was a near Kinsmen a man
[1:05:03] that could afford the price there wasn't
[1:05:04] near Kinsmen that could settle the amen
[1:05:07] settle the debt can you say man a man
[1:05:10] Acts 20 and 26 tells us that we have
[1:05:13] been purchased with his own blood God's
[1:05:17] own blood nah think of that so that was
[1:05:21] the price to be paid that's why no one
[1:05:23] else could do it but God himself ain't
[1:05:26] that right amen aren't you glad you had
[1:05:28] a a kinsman redeemer a man and God
[1:05:31] became our Kinsmen when he took on flesh
[1:05:35] he became you that you could become him
[1:05:38] ain't that right so so you think of this
[1:05:41] now and and job 23 and 13 job says but
[1:05:45] he is in one mind talking about God he
[1:05:49] is in one mind he's not double minded
[1:05:51] that he is in one mind and who can turn
[1:05:54] him what his soul desires even that he
[1:05:58] doeth so God would allow amen make a and
[1:06:02] provide a law of redemption for a
[1:06:05] natural people but in that he would show
[1:06:08] his own desire and his own purpose and
[1:06:11] his own plan he saw you the way you were
[1:06:13] he saw your Mart he saw you as a slave
[1:06:17] he saw you in a in a in a in a no-good
[1:06:20] junk pile but in that law of redemption
[1:06:23] he was expressing what he was going to
[1:06:26] do I'm going to claim him I'm going to
[1:06:28] come back Satan and you ain't gonna be
[1:06:30] able to do nothing about it can you say
[1:06:32] man amen say so so job says see what his
[1:06:36] soul desireth even that he doeth for he
[1:06:39] performeth everybody say he performeth
[1:06:42] he performeth the thing that is
[1:06:45] appointed for me now now the devil had
[1:06:49] an appointment for you but God had a
[1:06:50] greater point appointment and that's
[1:06:52] what we're talking about tonight amen
[1:06:54] see so I didn't know you know uh or or
[1:06:58] we know that we didn't come into this
[1:07:01] world Amen looking anything like God to
[1:07:04] uh reflecting anything like a Son of God
[1:07:08] Amen uh uh we had a sinful nature we
[1:07:11] were slaves to the devil and the reason
[1:07:13] why we were slaves to the devil is
[1:07:16] because Adam sowed us into slavery Adam
[1:07:21] sowed us into slavery of sin but see
[1:07:24] that wasn't your beginning amen our
[1:07:27] beginning was before that amen when our
[1:07:31] names were put in the Lamb's Book of
[1:07:33] Life do you believe that amen see so we
[1:07:37] thought amen or I did anyways that I
[1:07:40] would be this way forever I just thought
[1:07:42] I'd been nobody forever I I just thought
[1:07:45] I'd be a hopeless case a sinner forever
[1:07:47] I just thought I'd always be you know
[1:07:50] just worthless and no good and and and
[1:07:53] even Satan thought that he had the power
[1:07:56] to destroy me you think of that and he
[1:07:59] thought he had the power to take you out
[1:08:02] he thought he had the power Amen to ruin
[1:08:05] you and to destroy you and and and after
[1:08:09] all he's the one that you were his
[1:08:11] property can you say amen amen that's
[1:08:14] right see amen and he was able to to use
[1:08:18] me and to extract things from me amen
[1:08:21] that he wanted for I was his slave when
[1:08:24] he had tell me to lie I lied when he
[1:08:26] told me to steal stole him when he'd
[1:08:28] tell you to drink you're drunk when he'd
[1:08:30] tell you to do this you just done it and
[1:08:32] a lot of times you're in it may be even
[1:08:34] in our own mind we'd say oh God I just
[1:08:36] don't want to be this way or or maybe
[1:08:38] you didn't even know God at that time
[1:08:40] and yet you was miserable amen but
[1:08:43] everything the devil told you to do you
[1:08:44] would just do it ain't that right for he
[1:08:47] was extracting things amen from you amen
[1:08:51] because he he uh he ruled you ain't that
[1:08:54] right amen but I want to say it this way
[1:08:56] he didn't own me for good he didn't own
[1:08:59] me for good I was a slave and I had to
[1:09:02] do the things he told me to do amen but
[1:09:04] he didn't own me for good can you say
[1:09:06] amen and he didn't own you for good
[1:09:08] that's right so he wasn't able to
[1:09:11] destroy me oh no no no there's a greater
[1:09:14] purpose he wasn't able to destroy you
[1:09:17] either ain't that right you realize the
[1:09:20] prophet said God took a picture of you
[1:09:22] before the foundation of the world Amen
[1:09:24] we so like our little phone so we can
[1:09:26] take pictures amen we think that's a new
[1:09:28] invention but God took a picture of you
[1:09:30] before the foundation of the world he
[1:09:32] thought of that before you ever thought
[1:09:34] of that have you ever just loved to take
[1:09:36] I like looking back you know when I was
[1:09:38] young and skinny amen and and I said you
[1:09:41] know I showed Heather you know a while
[1:09:43] back you know uh when I was about 16 and
[1:09:46] had my shirt off you know and had a
[1:09:48] little muscle and and but I slim you
[1:09:50] know and and she said is that really you
[1:09:53] you know I said that's me man yeah
[1:09:55] that's me and uh you know that's why I
[1:09:57] had to fight all the girls off and I
[1:09:59] just you know uh no but but you know uh
[1:10:03] uh and I think it's good to have the
[1:10:05] pictures so you can go back to in memory
[1:10:08] lane you understand what I'm saying but
[1:10:10] I'm so glad God had a picture of us as
[1:10:12] well I'm so glad that God took a picture
[1:10:15] of us amen that that it wouldn't just be
[1:10:18] a memory to him but it would be
[1:10:20] something that he would achieve four
[1:10:22] ain't that right that's right because
[1:10:24] that picture wasn't just for the present
[1:10:27] that picture was the future he saw your
[1:10:29] future whom he called he chose and them
[1:10:32] he chose he predestinated he already
[1:10:35] glorified he already Sanctified and that
[1:10:38] picture was you in the future can you
[1:10:41] say amen amen and he took that picture
[1:10:44] that's right see so when he looks at you
[1:10:46] it's not Memory Lane it's not God
[1:10:48] walking down memory lane as to what you
[1:10:51] used to be but it's God looking at the
[1:10:54] future of you and telling you you're
[1:10:56] going to make it amen you're going to
[1:10:58] come through you're going to Prevail
[1:11:00] because he saw it
[1:11:02] he decreed it ain't that right so no
[1:11:06] matter what happens you cannot be
[1:11:08] destroyed now Adam represented us at the
[1:11:12] beginning and and when he fell we failed
[1:11:15] and for he was the head of the human
[1:11:18] race and I I want to say to you head
[1:11:21] ship matters
[1:11:24] headship matter say man whether it's in
[1:11:27] a family whether it's in a church and
[1:11:29] and and what you come under the headship
[1:11:32] of it matters can you say man
[1:11:35] it really does and and so uh uh but then
[1:11:40] see so Adam being our head he fell and
[1:11:45] we fell with him amen but then God
[1:11:48] became our second Adam a man when he
[1:11:52] became flesh a man and in in in in
[1:11:55] Colossians 1 18 Paul tells us that he
[1:11:59] Christ is the head of the church ain't
[1:12:02] that right amen and brother Branham said
[1:12:04] he is the head of the of the uh of this
[1:12:08] new race a new creation it's too muffled
[1:12:11] now amen uh he is the head of this new
[1:12:14] race New Creation so we find that Adam
[1:12:18] was the head of the old creation ain't
[1:12:21] that right he was the head of the old
[1:12:23] creation and all that creation fell when
[1:12:27] Adam fell amen but Christ is the head of
[1:12:30] the new creation for the prophets that
[1:12:33] he was of the new creation he was an
[1:12:36] obvious old creation he was of the new
[1:12:39] creation and the Bible says you are a
[1:12:42] new Creature if you're in Christ If any
[1:12:44] man be in Christ he is a new creature or
[1:12:48] a new creation so that means you
[1:12:51] switched heads amen that means god
[1:12:53] rescued you when he become your headship
[1:12:56] amen not Adam would represent you now
[1:12:59] God himself would represent you oh my
[1:13:04] that makes a big difference for under
[1:13:06] Adam I was a failure under Adam I was a
[1:13:09] sinner under Adam I was hopeless amen
[1:13:12] that when God became my headship all I
[1:13:15] can see is Victory all I can see is
[1:13:18] overcoming all I can see is power all I
[1:13:22] can see is as I'm going to make it it
[1:13:24] because he's my headship
[1:13:27] now Satan noticed that new head Satan
[1:13:31] tried to make him fall like he did Adam
[1:13:33] but he didn't fall
[1:13:35] can you say man the first Adam failed to
[1:13:38] fulfill God's word but the second Adam
[1:13:41] our head fulfilled all of God's word
[1:13:44] everybody say all of God's word see our
[1:13:48] second Adam our head now the new head of
[1:13:51] this new creation fulfilled all of God's
[1:13:54] word Oh my he overcame every Temptation
[1:13:57] that came his way he overcame every
[1:14:00] trial that he was uh faced with he
[1:14:03] overcome every devil
[1:14:05] of Hell amen he overcomes Satan himself
[1:14:09] he overcome every enticing Spirit can
[1:14:13] you say Amen so it shows us that the
[1:14:16] first Adam no longer represents us
[1:14:18] whatsoever amen Jesus Christ represents
[1:14:22] us and you know what the prophet said
[1:14:24] he's our Advocate Paul says he's our
[1:14:27] Advocate ain't that right amen he's
[1:14:29] interceding for you and he doesn't stop
[1:14:31] interceding for you Amen on your
[1:14:34] Mountaintop he's interceding for you in
[1:14:36] your Valley he's interceding for you how
[1:14:39] can he do it he's the one that was
[1:14:40] worthy amen he's the one amen that that
[1:14:44] was worthy to become our Kinsmen
[1:14:47] Redeemer
[1:14:49] is this okay
[1:14:51] amen now notice what the headship says
[1:14:53] because I live you'll live
[1:14:56] you live also as I've overcome the world
[1:14:59] so you shall overcome the world can you
[1:15:02] say man why he's our head we are
[1:15:05] represented by him now amen it's kind of
[1:15:09] like the the Battle of David and Goliath
[1:15:12] and and each man uh uh each of these men
[1:15:17] represented their their nation and and
[1:15:20] in first Samuel 17 and 8 uh tells us
[1:15:24] that Goliath stood and Cried unto the
[1:15:27] armies of Israel and said unto them why
[1:15:29] are you come out to set your battle in
[1:15:32] Array am I not uh uh am not I of
[1:15:36] philistine and you servants to Saul
[1:15:38] choose you a man for you and let him
[1:15:41] come down to me and if he be able to
[1:15:43] fight with me and to kill me then we
[1:15:47] will be your servants so they understood
[1:15:49] what the headship was was this this what
[1:15:52] this representation was going to be amen
[1:15:54] one man would represent his own country
[1:15:57] amen but if I Prevail against him and
[1:16:00] kill him then shall you be our servants
[1:16:03] and serve us so you could just imagine
[1:16:06] the responsibility a man that weighed
[1:16:09] upon David that little boy's shoulders
[1:16:11] amen he knew he wasn't playing playing
[1:16:13] games he knew he was fighting for
[1:16:15] Israel's life amen he was fighting for
[1:16:18] Israel's future he was fighting for
[1:16:20] their identity he was fighting for the
[1:16:22] children he was fighting for generations
[1:16:25] to come can you say amen he knew that
[1:16:28] this wasn't just about playing games
[1:16:30] this wasn't just it was his whole gland
[1:16:32] his inheritance his family amen was on
[1:16:37] the line
[1:16:40] the future of Israel laid on his
[1:16:42] shoulders but see David was a type of
[1:16:45] Christ
[1:16:46] and if you notice David willfully
[1:16:49] a man ran to meet Goliath
[1:16:52] and just as Christ did Christ willfully
[1:16:55] came Amen to stand for you and I he
[1:16:59] ain't that right there ain't no way that
[1:17:01] you was a match for the devil
[1:17:03] no way he was a match amen and I'll just
[1:17:06] be honest there was no way that Martin
[1:17:08] that that Saul was a match either there
[1:17:10] was no way that any other than men amen
[1:17:13] was a match but David was a match
[1:17:15] because he was representing Christ he
[1:17:18] had the very Spirit of Christ on him
[1:17:23] and did you know he got victory for his
[1:17:25] people
[1:17:26] and when the people saw
[1:17:28] that Goliath was dead they got courage
[1:17:32] and ran to join the fight because they
[1:17:35] knew they knew that the victory was
[1:17:38] theirs
[1:17:39] David the one that represented them had
[1:17:42] already defeated amen the enemy amen and
[1:17:46] so they ran they got courage they got
[1:17:49] boldness a man to chase the enemy can
[1:17:52] you say man and I believe that was the
[1:17:55] real victory that David had more than
[1:17:57] just defeating Goliath but to see the
[1:18:00] people Rise Up In Courage amen the ones
[1:18:03] that was hiding behind the rocks and
[1:18:05] shaking now to see them rise up and say
[1:18:08] yes that's right we're going to defeat
[1:18:10] the enemy that's the real Victory David
[1:18:12] was asking for can you say Amen oh yes
[1:18:17] sir to see the people of God that was
[1:18:19] once hiding in fear now running after
[1:18:23] the enemy what a victory now the prophet
[1:18:26] said we are his victory the church is
[1:18:31] his victory we come forth in this last
[1:18:35] days with this glorious gospel showing
[1:18:38] his Victory he died for this purpose and
[1:18:43] we are proof of his victory
[1:18:46] hiding behind the rocks oh no that's not
[1:18:49] what this Believers are that's not what
[1:18:51] this people is doing that's not what
[1:18:53] this church is doing we ain't hiding
[1:18:55] from nothing amen we're going after the
[1:18:57] devil and we're showing the victory of
[1:19:00] Jesus Christ he saddled the payment he
[1:19:04] defeated the enemy and here we are his
[1:19:07] victory
[1:19:11] when we see him coming down and living
[1:19:13] among the church that's his victory
[1:19:15] shows he couldn't keep him in the grave
[1:19:17] and they can't keep us either
[1:19:19] see that's right we are already
[1:19:21] potentially
[1:19:23] arised because we've raised from the
[1:19:25] dead unbelief in his word
[1:19:28] can you say man from denomination Creeds
[1:19:31] to an eternal word of the Eternal God
[1:19:33] which is him himself working through US
[1:19:36] manifesting himself that he is the same
[1:19:39] yesterday today and forever
[1:19:45] and notice when the enemy saw that their
[1:19:48] representation
[1:19:49] was defeated
[1:19:51] they ran
[1:19:52] remember they were the one boasting
[1:19:56] God's people was the one hiding
[1:19:59] God's people was the one shaking in fear
[1:20:02] the other one's just walking around yeah
[1:20:04] go get them Goliath come on come on
[1:20:06] Go Tell it do it again I like to see him
[1:20:09] Shake
[1:20:11] not Elvis shook
[1:20:14] every time Goliath got out there all
[1:20:16] God's people just moved
[1:20:19] trembled
[1:20:21] but now here when the enemy sees that
[1:20:24] their representation is dead
[1:20:27] they run
[1:20:29] now I'm going to tell you that's facts
[1:20:32] [Music]
[1:20:33] you with me that's facts
[1:20:37] that when the enemy sees that their
[1:20:39] Chief is dead
[1:20:41] they run
[1:20:43] you say why am I having troubles
[1:20:51] well did not Israel go after the enemy
[1:20:55] now they could have just sat there too
[1:20:57] they could have sat there in their land
[1:20:59] and look down and say bye
[1:21:03] but they went after the enemy
[1:21:06] and I think every time that we make
[1:21:08] progress in God you know what we're
[1:21:10] really doing is we're going after the
[1:21:12] enemy
[1:21:13] we're not just setting Steel
[1:21:16] we're moving
[1:21:18] can you say Amen
[1:21:20] now we see in Portland Oregon we we see
[1:21:23] that there was a showdown similar to
[1:21:24] that one
[1:21:26] and and remember when that man came up
[1:21:28] on the platform and he he threatened
[1:21:30] brother Branham said I'm gonna break
[1:21:32] every bone in your body and brother
[1:21:34] Brown said he was able well capable to
[1:21:36] do it he had already done it to to one
[1:21:38] man uh uh uh uh put a preacher in the
[1:21:42] hospital and here he was now going to
[1:21:44] make uh uh uh a a spectacle and and of
[1:21:49] himself here and and he was making
[1:21:51] threats to kill him to kill brother
[1:21:53] Branham all these things and brother
[1:21:54] Brown said he'd come up on me towards me
[1:21:57] and said I'll break every bone in your
[1:21:59] body now you you think of it because all
[1:22:02] the other preachers left the pulpit amen
[1:22:05] they they all scattered and the
[1:22:07] policemen were coming to get that man
[1:22:08] and brother Brandon said no stay back
[1:22:10] waved him back hey man why this was a
[1:22:13] showdown again and and so he says I'm
[1:22:16] going to break every bone in your body
[1:22:18] and he drew back his fist brother Brown
[1:22:20] said I said because you've challenged
[1:22:22] the spirit of God tonight you'll fall
[1:22:23] over my feet I didn't even know I said
[1:22:26] that he said that was the spirit talking
[1:22:27] it done took over then but there was
[1:22:30] both challenges and he he run to me and
[1:22:34] said I'll show whose feet uh uh uh I'll
[1:22:36] fall over and he drew back his great big
[1:22:39] fist like that and the audience set
[1:22:40] Spellbound and just as he drew back his
[1:22:43] fist I said Satan come out of him and he
[1:22:46] threw his hands back like that his eyes
[1:22:48] bulged way back like out like the head
[1:22:50] and rolled around his head threw his
[1:22:52] head back and spun around the floor and
[1:22:54] fell on my feet so that the police had
[1:22:56] to come and roll him off my feet before
[1:22:58] I could move right across the platform
[1:23:00] he was perfectly laying there now notice
[1:23:03] what brother Brown says and at that time
[1:23:06] when all them demons had seen that their
[1:23:09] Chief man was defeated they just began
[1:23:12] to raise up out of the Wheelchairs and
[1:23:14] the cots and the stretchers and
[1:23:16] everything else and walk and that was
[1:23:18] the end of the meeting that just
[1:23:19] everybody was healed and walked out you
[1:23:22] understand what I'm saying they were
[1:23:23] taking one man amen and and that Chief
[1:23:26] demon was representing everyone there
[1:23:29] and basically if he could have prevailed
[1:23:31] against the power of God in that Prophet
[1:23:33] every every person would have sat there
[1:23:36] amen probably for life in in the
[1:23:39] wheelchairs laying in the cots and and
[1:23:42] all of that that once them demons saw
[1:23:44] that their Chief was defeated every
[1:23:47] demon left that building amen and the
[1:23:49] people began to walk the lame began to
[1:23:52] walk they got up out of the car said the
[1:23:54] eyes began to see and and and the ears
[1:23:58] began to hear and and the began
[1:24:00] to the limbs begin to straighten up why
[1:24:03] they saw their their Chief was defeated
[1:24:08] I'm telling you what the demons know the
[1:24:10] power of this gospel
[1:24:13] hey
[1:24:15] sure does
[1:24:17] now notice
[1:24:19] Jesus the one who represents us told us
[1:24:22] in Revelations 1 17 says fear not
[1:24:26] I am the first and last
[1:24:29] I am he that liveth and was dead and
[1:24:31] behold I Am Alive forevermore amen and
[1:24:33] have the keys of hell and of death
[1:24:37] now you know where did he get them keys
[1:24:39] he went down into Satan's house
[1:24:43] and he got them keys
[1:24:45] are you with me now there ain't a new
[1:24:48] generation of devils so I believe every
[1:24:50] demon of hell was present when that when
[1:24:53] Jesus Christ opened that door
[1:24:56] I don't think he just opened the door I
[1:24:58] think he kicked the door down
[1:24:59] amen and he went over there and he
[1:25:01] grabbed them keys from the devil amen
[1:25:04] and every demon I believe was present
[1:25:06] and witnessed it amen I so so we're not
[1:25:09] talking about a new generation of demons
[1:25:11] that don't know what happened and have
[1:25:13] to be retold and retold and retold and
[1:25:15] retold no it's us that has to be retold
[1:25:17] it's us that has to be preached to can
[1:25:20] you say Amen to let us know that there
[1:25:22] was a real Calvary there was a real war
[1:25:25] there was a real Victory and you're part
[1:25:28] of that Victory God had you in his mind
[1:25:31] before the foundation of the world and
[1:25:35] you are part of God's Property
[1:25:39] breathe
[1:25:40] hey hey
[1:25:43] Glory Hebrews 10 14 for by one offering
[1:25:46] he hath perfected forever
[1:25:48] everybody say forever
[1:25:50] by one offering
[1:25:52] he hath perfected them forever
[1:25:54] that are sanctified
[1:25:56] and who was that offering but he himself
[1:25:59] became mire kinsman redeemer so we have
[1:26:02] been loosed as the Bible says by his own
[1:26:04] blood and are being restored how many
[1:26:08] believes you're being restored now come
[1:26:10] on now don't give me that hound dog look
[1:26:12] hey man like you just lost your best
[1:26:14] friend I'm telling you if you can
[1:26:16] understand that you are restored amen
[1:26:18] you would quit entertaining every
[1:26:20] negative thought that is in your mind
[1:26:22] you had quit in that entertaining
[1:26:24] everything that the devil offers you and
[1:26:26] you start fighting back and say hey I've
[1:26:28] already won
[1:26:31] I've already won
[1:26:33] can you say that with me I've already
[1:26:34] won
[1:26:36] I've already won
[1:26:37] why he's already won it for me
[1:26:42] please
[1:26:45] you realize the only thing about us that
[1:26:48] has been destroyed is their old life
[1:26:53] what we were under Adam is the only
[1:26:55] thing that has come to its end
[1:26:59] no more are you as sinners
[1:27:01] no more are you poppers
[1:27:03] no more are you a hopeless case
[1:27:06] no more are you Unholy and unrighteous
[1:27:09] no more are you an unbeliever
[1:27:12] can you say man in church I'm going to
[1:27:14] tell you this is not a pharaoh fairy
[1:27:16] tale this is the gospel
[1:27:19] this is the gospel I'm not sitting here
[1:27:21] wasting my time I'm telling you the
[1:27:24] exact truth amen and what I say it'll be
[1:27:27] rang up in heaven Amen on the Judgment
[1:27:30] day it's going to be there it's the
[1:27:32] truth can you say Amen can you say that
[1:27:34] with me it's the truth it's the truth
[1:27:37] God didn't save us just to sit on a Pew
[1:27:40] and dry up amen God didn't save us then
[1:27:43] 10 years later we don't know who we are
[1:27:45] and we just don't know what we're going
[1:27:47] to happen and we don't know our future
[1:27:49] come on church God would have never
[1:27:51] saved you like that he saved you and
[1:27:53] called you with the Holy calling an
[1:27:56] eternal purpose and what he done he did
[1:27:58] it for good
[1:28:00] hey
[1:28:02] brother
[1:28:03] John 8 32 says you shall know the truth
[1:28:06] and the truth shall make you free
[1:28:08] the problem is the prophet said people
[1:28:10] don't want the truth
[1:28:13] and you say Amen you know what the
[1:28:16] prophet said and he said but you can
[1:28:17] either be to either know the truth and
[1:28:19] be free
[1:28:20] or you can be a truth rejecting preacher
[1:28:24] a prisoner
[1:28:26] you can either know the truth
[1:28:28] and receive the truth and be free
[1:28:32] or you can be a truth rejecting prisoner
[1:28:35] can you say Amen
[1:28:37] that's exactly right
[1:28:39] now notice Adam represented us and we
[1:28:42] all fell when he fell
[1:28:44] but then Jesus Christ the second Adam
[1:28:46] who represented every name in the Lamb's
[1:28:49] Book of Life did not fall
[1:28:51] and here comes Jesus and asked the
[1:28:53] question which is so powerful to you and
[1:28:55] I and what a meaning what what something
[1:28:58] that captivates our hearts and and and
[1:29:01] and and and and uh creates a hope and
[1:29:03] expectation when he says who can accuse
[1:29:06] me of sin
[1:29:07] [Music]
[1:29:09] hey I've gone through it all but who can
[1:29:12] accuse me of sin
[1:29:14] I've been tempted in the wilderness but
[1:29:16] who can accuse me of sin I've been lied
[1:29:18] against but who can accuse me of sin
[1:29:20] they told me that my birth was false who
[1:29:23] can accuse me of sin they told me I'm
[1:29:25] just an illegitimate child amen but who
[1:29:28] can accuse me of sin you know what sin
[1:29:30] is unbelief who can accuse me of
[1:29:33] disbelieving Amen when I went down and I
[1:29:36] was in the trials and Satan came at me
[1:29:38] hard I stood back with faith and I never
[1:29:41] did waver amen who can accuse me that's
[1:29:44] our headship can you say Amen if our
[1:29:46] headship was just some weakling that the
[1:29:48] devil could whip around what hope do we
[1:29:51] have here tonight but if he's the one
[1:29:53] that said who can accuse me of sin and
[1:29:56] the Very accuser that accuses you get
[1:29:59] dare not accuse him
[1:30:03] preacher he may stand before our Lord
[1:30:07] and accuse us but who is he that can
[1:30:10] accuse
[1:30:12] our head
[1:30:17] for he is the innocent one
[1:30:19] can you say man
[1:30:21] so Adam's fall is not tied to us anymore
[1:30:25] as I've read before our own sexual blood
[1:30:28] is dismissed
[1:30:33] Psalms 32 and 2 blessed is the man whom
[1:30:35] the Lord imputeth not iniquity
[1:30:39] Romans 4 8 blessed is the man to whom
[1:30:41] the Lord will not impute sin
[1:30:44] are you with me
[1:30:46] you know what he's saying now these are
[1:30:49] blessings that only come to you
[1:30:51] these are your blessings
[1:30:53] come on now devil trying to tell you
[1:30:56] there's no hope these are your blessings
[1:30:58] we sing that song Count Your Blessings
[1:31:01] name them one by one and for some reason
[1:31:04] we always forget these blessings
[1:31:07] the Lord does not impute iniquity I'm
[1:31:09] it's a blessing to me the Lord does not
[1:31:12] impute sin unto me it's a blessing unto
[1:31:16] me
[1:31:19] it's what the prophet said these are
[1:31:21] blessings that God has bestowed upon us
[1:31:25] see so it's not our old life that counts
[1:31:28] anymore but notice it's the life of the
[1:31:31] Lamb
[1:31:32] for he's our head he's the one that
[1:31:34] represents us
[1:31:37] that's why God only looks at him
[1:31:41] he doesn't even see you
[1:31:44] he sees him
[1:31:46] then you say Amen
[1:31:48] and when Adam fell we fell
[1:31:52] that's just the way it was but here's
[1:31:55] our head another headship of ours that
[1:31:57] now that we're under and he says I've
[1:32:00] never sinned I who can accuse me I'm
[1:32:02] innocent and God looks at that innocent
[1:32:05] life before he honor looks at you
[1:32:09] [Music]
[1:32:16] so he's not his innocent life represents
[1:32:19] us and then his own life comes into you
[1:32:21] right
[1:32:23] and this shows that you have received
[1:32:25] the abstract as the prophet said now
[1:32:28] notice
[1:32:29] and I won't keep you much longer but but
[1:32:31] I'm I just want to keep one for a minute
[1:32:33] I hope it's helping you
[1:32:36] but abstract means it's searched all the
[1:32:39] way back to its beginning
[1:32:41] like that little drop of ink this
[1:32:43] morning he says when it struck that
[1:32:44] bleach it went all the way back and when
[1:32:47] sin has been confessed and fallen into
[1:32:49] the blood of Jesus Christ oh my it gives
[1:32:52] an abstract right straight back to the
[1:32:54] Creator again and you become a son of
[1:32:56] God
[1:32:57] isn't that what we wanted to be
[1:33:00] we were a sinner by because we were a
[1:33:03] slave but now be we have received the
[1:33:05] abstract
[1:33:07] by receiving his life that is our
[1:33:10] abstract that we can show to the devil
[1:33:12] anytime
[1:33:14] I I ain't you I I ain't a sinner no more
[1:33:17] I'm not under your hit chip
[1:33:20] You Don't Own Me I'm a Son of God I'm a
[1:33:22] daughter of God
[1:33:24] ain't that right
[1:33:25] so he says see it gives an abstract
[1:33:27] right straight back to the Creator again
[1:33:29] and you become a Son of God see Abstract
[1:33:31] title deed is held in the hand of the
[1:33:34] almighty its Redemption means all legal
[1:33:37] possession to all that was lost by Adam
[1:33:39] and Eve see what that ought to do to a
[1:33:42] born-again Christian it's legal
[1:33:44] possession to the abstract deed title
[1:33:46] deed of eternal life means that you
[1:33:49] possess everything that Adam and Eve
[1:33:50] lost
[1:33:52] Oh my he says another place when a man
[1:33:55] has said that he believes the word and
[1:33:57] then when the Holy Spirit comes it is
[1:33:59] the abstract to the title and that gives
[1:34:02] you permission everybody say I've got
[1:34:03] permission
[1:34:04] it gives you permission when you have
[1:34:06] that abstract that every bit of that
[1:34:08] belongs to you and everything uh that's
[1:34:11] on it belongs to you that gives us the
[1:34:14] abstract when the Holy Ghost comes upon
[1:34:16] this title deed that God saw back Yonder
[1:34:18] before the foundation of the world and
[1:34:20] put uh your name on the lamb book of uh
[1:34:23] or on the Book of Life see Buck was born
[1:34:26] through a man and woman subject to sin
[1:34:28] and guilty of sin but when I believed on
[1:34:31] it I received the deed but when the Holy
[1:34:33] Ghost come it was an abstract that
[1:34:36] everything against me whether my mother
[1:34:37] done it my father done it my grandmother
[1:34:39] done it whoever did it it's it's all off
[1:34:42] everything that was struck against me is
[1:34:45] struck off I am free
[1:34:50] hey man great brother Brown talked about
[1:34:54] that epileptic child that had come just
[1:34:57] before service
[1:34:59] and he said the child was an EP that
[1:35:01] epilepsy come to the grandparents
[1:35:05] but brother Brown said I kept that
[1:35:06] Spirit off that child
[1:35:09] because I had an abstract
[1:35:13] can you say man
[1:35:16] had an abstract and you know what that's
[1:35:18] exactly what the church is to be doing
[1:35:20] all right Cassidy spirit's off
[1:35:23] are you with me
[1:35:25] because why we got an abstract
[1:35:28] abstract yes sir
[1:35:31] Mark 16 15 and said unto them go ye into
[1:35:34] all the world and preach the gospel to
[1:35:35] every creature and he that believeth in
[1:35:37] his baptized shall be saved but he that
[1:35:39] believeth not shall be dead
[1:35:44] my name they shall cast out devils
[1:35:48] [Music]
[1:35:50] oh my
[1:35:52] you know brother Brown said that's what
[1:35:54] Abraham did
[1:35:55] for he was the type of the church
[1:35:58] you know that sacrifice there he's
[1:36:00] watching that sacrifice
[1:36:02] and he said he watched until the sun was
[1:36:04] going down and the fowls come down out
[1:36:06] of the air and on Abraham's sacrifice
[1:36:08] the vultures and Abraham cast him out
[1:36:11] and chewed them away
[1:36:13] he said what's this a type of Abraham's
[1:36:15] seed in the last day casting out Devils
[1:36:17] from the sacrifice casting away from the
[1:36:19] sacrifice God promised it the sacrifice
[1:36:22] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:36:24] forever and all them unbelieving Spirits
[1:36:26] trying to devour it the man of God the
[1:36:29] Abraham seed stands there casting out
[1:36:31] the Devils away from it confirming the
[1:36:34] Covenant now see the confirmation
[1:36:36] showing that Abraham's seed he said I
[1:36:38] mean the Royal loyal Royal seed remember
[1:36:42] see the natural seed failed because it
[1:36:44] accepted law instead of the word of
[1:36:46] Grace So now here you are the loyal
[1:36:49] Royal seed of God can you say man that's
[1:36:52] right see he said see so they they so it
[1:36:56] has in this round bout in the Gentiles
[1:36:59] uh in this last day but there is a seed
[1:37:02] a royal seed with the word that stands
[1:37:05] true casting out Devils doing great
[1:37:08] signs and wonders getting all the
[1:37:10] unbelief away from the word keeping the
[1:37:13] sacrifice clean keeping the word holy

[1:39:54] well I just don't feel like I've got the
[1:39:56] energy I just don't know I'm just just
[1:39:58] the smallest guy in the church even the
[1:40:00] weakest Christian
[1:40:01] can defeat Satan any time
[1:40:04] anywhere
[1:40:06] under any everybody say any condition
[1:40:12] by the word the weakest now that your
[1:40:14] Prophet our Prophet told us that so I'm
[1:40:16] not just standing here just just just
[1:40:18] blabbering I'm telling you what thus
[1:40:21] Seth the Lord said about you
[1:40:23] why the pie price has already been paid
[1:40:26] restoration means it's for everything we
[1:40:29] are in the restoration of all things you
[1:40:33] have every right to claim Every Blessing
[1:40:35] everything that God has ever promised
[1:40:37] you
[1:40:40] when the abstract has come the prophet
[1:40:43] said it struck off emitted everything
[1:40:45] everything
[1:40:48] he said I'm an abstract holder then and
[1:40:51] as sure is the spirit that raised Christ
[1:40:53] from the dead I have an abstract deed
[1:40:55] that I'm part of that body with the
[1:40:57] abstract of the Holy Ghost making that
[1:40:59] body of word live out just exactly like
[1:41:01] it did in him as he promised in this day
[1:41:03] in the last day the abstract all my sins
[1:41:06] everybody say all my sins are struck out
[1:41:10] all your sins are struck out by the
[1:41:13] blood of Jesus Christ no wonder the
[1:41:15] devil wants to take the blood away your
[1:41:18] sins will never be struck out if we take
[1:41:20] the blood out
[1:41:21] that by the blood to all your sins are
[1:41:24] struck out can you say man and by the
[1:41:27] blood of Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost
[1:41:29] has come as an abstract to the title
[1:41:31] deed that God give me by Grace by
[1:41:35] foreknowledge so you have every right to
[1:41:37] cast out the unbelieving spirits too for
[1:41:40] you hold the abstract now listen how can
[1:41:43] you be a sinner how can you be a sinner
[1:41:45] and hold his life within you
[1:41:50] how can you act like a sinner
[1:41:53] now and and I'm not I'm not there's a
[1:41:56] lot and I'm not talking about going bars
[1:41:58] and all that what about people sitting
[1:41:59] in churches that that that that act as
[1:42:04] though
[1:42:07] as though they're unworthy as though
[1:42:10] as as though they can never come to a
[1:42:13] place that that God will accept them
[1:42:18] say you have Center Center mentality
[1:42:21] and I'm just going to be frank
[1:42:25] and and Satan wants us all to come into
[1:42:27] this place
[1:42:29] to where we don't think good about
[1:42:31] ourself
[1:42:32] and and I'm going to be honest with you
[1:42:34] there's nothing good about us
[1:42:36] so this has nothing to do about us
[1:42:38] gloating and and pride and all that jazz
[1:42:42] this has to do with his Redemption works
[1:42:45] so therefore by faith I accept it and I
[1:42:48] say it but I am worthy by his blood
[1:42:51] I am a saint by his blood
[1:42:54] by his work of redemption
[1:42:57] can you say man see so therefore every
[1:43:00] name that was written in the Lamb's Book
[1:43:02] of Life was to be brought into
[1:43:04] manifestation by the spoken word ain't
[1:43:07] that right but Adam our first head
[1:43:11] failed to do that
[1:43:13] so we were born into this world through
[1:43:16] a sex act thus We Came as a fallen
[1:43:18] attribute of God but now notice before
[1:43:22] the foundation of the world God wrote
[1:43:23] your name in the Lamb's Book of Life by
[1:43:26] his spoken word
[1:43:28] and sent Christ the sacrifice to buy to
[1:43:31] redeem that same group that he had wrote
[1:43:33] their names in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:43:35] before the foundation of the world he
[1:43:37] come to redeem all names that's in that
[1:43:40] book no more not no more or not one more
[1:43:44] just what was in there when that last
[1:43:46] name is redeemed he takes his book and
[1:43:48] claims what he has redeemed ain't that
[1:43:50] right listen see so then he says see we
[1:43:54] were his thoughts then expressed into
[1:43:56] word and we become what we are that's
[1:43:58] the reason our names maybe not what we
[1:44:00] have now but our names were put on the
[1:44:02] Lamb's Book of Life and if it wasn't
[1:44:04] there then it'll it'll never be there
[1:44:06] and Jesus has come to redeem all those
[1:44:09] that's whose names were on that book
[1:44:11] ain't that right now I'm closing but
[1:44:14] listen he died
[1:44:16] everybody say he died
[1:44:18] he was buried
[1:44:19] but he rose again
[1:44:22] he died
[1:44:23] are you buried but he rose again
[1:44:27] and what was the next step
[1:44:29] the victory had already been won
[1:44:32] he showed who he was he proved by his
[1:44:35] resurrection that he was the son of God
[1:44:37] and notice the next step he said to his
[1:44:40] disciples in Acts 1 but you shall
[1:44:42] receive power
[1:44:43] after that the Holy Ghost has come upon
[1:44:45] you and you shall be Witnesses unto me
[1:44:47] ain't that right now think of a church
[1:44:49] they did not ask for his spirit
[1:44:52] he promised them his spirit
[1:44:55] ain't that right they had no idea that
[1:44:58] he could do it or would do it they had
[1:45:00] no idea amen now they had asked him
[1:45:02] questions uh uh through periodically as
[1:45:05] they followed him even one time they had
[1:45:07] asked him the question who is the
[1:45:09] greatest among the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:45:10] could you imagine the question who is
[1:45:12] the greatest you know of the Kingdom of
[1:45:14] Heaven they instead of asking for
[1:45:16] eternal life instead of asking that that
[1:45:19] he would come into them see they were
[1:45:21] just happy that they they only thought
[1:45:23] the purpose of God was that God become
[1:45:26] flesh and dwell with him and they were
[1:45:28] happy that they he would dwell with them
[1:45:30] and Jesus would tell them that I'm going
[1:45:32] to come to you one day and only come to
[1:45:35] you but I'll be in you
[1:45:37] hey that right
[1:45:42] they didn't ask that question
[1:45:45] that he promised it anyway
[1:45:48] and you say man
[1:45:50] oh do you love him
[1:45:53] and notice Acts 2 24 the promise is unto
[1:45:56] you Peter says and to your children and
[1:45:58] to all that are far off even as many as
[1:46:00] the Lord Our God shall call and so he
[1:46:03] sent back his holy spirit upon the
[1:46:06] believer
[1:46:07] and why would he do that
[1:46:09] as as we close that why would he do that
[1:46:12] because the promises of God are the laws
[1:46:15] of God
[1:46:16] ain't that right when God makes a
[1:46:19] promise it is a law
[1:46:24] and it can't be a law until there's an
[1:46:26] enforcement
[1:46:33] that's why these Lawless people don't
[1:46:34] like our policemen
[1:46:36] they want to defund police
[1:46:38] because if you have no law enforcement
[1:46:40] you have no laws
[1:46:43] and that's why so many are attacking the
[1:46:45] Holy Ghost today
[1:46:47] and it's just Satan
[1:46:49] that that is attacking it because
[1:46:51] without the Holy Spirit there's no law
[1:46:55] and you say man
[1:46:57] now listen when God makes a promise and
[1:46:59] it's got to come to pass
[1:47:01] brother Brown said God said all of his
[1:47:03] laws in motion that it must work
[1:47:05] according to his own word are you
[1:47:06] getting it his word his law has to work
[1:47:10] according to his word he commanded the
[1:47:12] son he commanded the moon he commanded
[1:47:13] the Earth he commanded nature and they
[1:47:16] all fall right in line and all the laws
[1:47:18] work in harmony with God's spoken word
[1:47:20] and we could go into it there's a law to
[1:47:23] every seed of God that he planted let
[1:47:25] every seed bring forth of its own kind
[1:47:27] ain't that right and we know that there
[1:47:29] are seasons to the seed amen you can
[1:47:32] come up the flower comes up but in the
[1:47:34] winter time it goes right back down and
[1:47:37] and and but is that it no God said law
[1:47:40] that that seed's got to come back up
[1:47:42] ain't that right that's why you keep
[1:47:44] coming up in your trials that's why you
[1:47:47] keep coming up when you're discouraged
[1:47:49] there is a law concerning you I don't
[1:47:52] care how low you go you're coming up
[1:47:54] okay
[1:47:56] Lord you say well I haven't I I I I I
[1:47:59] haven't I haven't felt God in a long
[1:48:02] time bro Sean I don't care
[1:48:04] you're coming oh
[1:48:07] hey you know how it is
[1:48:10] we have long Winters sometimes
[1:48:13] we have some bitter winners
[1:48:15] you're thinking how is it going to be
[1:48:17] have you ever just been in the middle of
[1:48:19] a winner and you're thinking how
[1:48:21] how can it all live again
[1:48:23] how
[1:48:25] but spring comes to just to prove it and
[1:48:27] answer the question
[1:48:29] the sun rotates right back and gets
[1:48:31] close to that Earth and begins to call
[1:48:33] life again
[1:48:35] and what was so dead and so hopeless and
[1:48:37] so so nothing there has come back to
[1:48:41] what God called it to be can you say man
[1:48:44] do you love him
[1:48:46] oh yes yes yes yes so there's a law to
[1:48:49] you being a son and daughter of God
[1:48:51] how else can you be that if there was no
[1:48:54] law to it
[1:48:56] but that law the prophet said is the law
[1:48:58] of life ain't that right
[1:49:00] amen if the musicians will come
[1:49:03] Jesus had that law of life in him
[1:49:06] you have that law notice
[1:49:08] that law was written in Psalms Psalm 16
[1:49:12] 10 for that will not leave my soul
[1:49:15] inhaled neither without suffer thine
[1:49:16] Holy One to see corruption you see that
[1:49:19] was a law concerning Jesus
[1:49:21] ain't that right and by that law by that
[1:49:25] one law
[1:49:26] he told them unbelievers he said you
[1:49:29] destroy this Temple and within three
[1:49:31] days I'll raise it back again one law
[1:49:33] but he knew that that law was for him
[1:49:35] and he had the law of life in him to
[1:49:39] make that law work ain't that right and
[1:49:42] notice what the prophet said there
[1:49:43] wasn't enough time there wasn't enough
[1:49:45] Devils there wasn't enough anything to
[1:49:46] keep Christ in that grave see till his
[1:49:49] body began to rot because the law of God
[1:49:52] would bring the word to pass and the law
[1:49:54] of God by the Holy Spirit brings any
[1:49:56] promise to pass regardless everybody say
[1:49:59] regardless of the conditions
[1:50:02] oh what a restoration
[1:50:05] ain't that right the restoration I'm
[1:50:08] thinking of of even job the law of life
[1:50:10] was in job for he said though the skin
[1:50:13] worms eat this flesh destroys this body
[1:50:15] yet in my flesh I will see God do you
[1:50:19] realize he said that he saw he saw he
[1:50:22] said that four thousand years before
[1:50:24] Jesus came to Earth and there he died
[1:50:27] right there he died and and and that
[1:50:30] body was already turned to ashes or dust
[1:50:33] or whatever amen when Jesus come upon
[1:50:36] the Earth amen but the word had already
[1:50:39] been spoken God had already spoken it
[1:50:42] and given job that Revelation therefore
[1:50:44] that law was concerning him can you say
[1:50:47] amen that's exactly right and we read
[1:50:50] there in the Book of Matthew had that
[1:50:51] after the death burial and resurrection
[1:50:53] of Jesus that many of the saints that
[1:50:56] slept in the dust of the earth rose out
[1:50:58] of that dust why the prophet said it was
[1:51:01] that Prophet speaking with the word of
[1:51:03] God and the word had been spoken and the
[1:51:06] law of God by the spirit raised it up
[1:51:09] aren't you glad for that and he said the
[1:51:12] holy spirit is here to enforce that law
[1:51:15] amen for the believer he you have to be
[1:51:18] ordained to do so and take it and it
[1:51:21] takes a Believer you've got to have the
[1:51:23] badge of believer and notice what he
[1:51:25] says regardless and listen now he's
[1:51:27] going to make it just so plain to you
[1:51:29] that we have no excuse but to believe
[1:51:32] amen and every time Satan puts in your
[1:51:35] mind a negative thought gets you to use
[1:51:37] that for an excuse you ain't got none so
[1:51:39] you tell the devil that ain't excuse for
[1:51:41] me I I you you give it to somebody else
[1:51:44] but that is not an excuse for me notice
[1:51:46] brother Brown says regardless of how
[1:51:48] little we are how low we are how impure
[1:51:52] we are how Unholy we are how sick we are
[1:51:56] how Afflicted we are the law of God's
[1:51:59] spirit by his word makes it obey him and
[1:52:02] forces the issue and says give it back
[1:52:04] oh oh if we could just think of that for
[1:52:07] a minute forces it regardless of
[1:52:09] conditions no matter what the condition
[1:52:11] is the law of God's word forces the
[1:52:14] condition to cope with his word it's got
[1:52:17] to now if a flower is laying there and
[1:52:20] it's dead the seeds are rocking gone the
[1:52:23] pulp is gone that doesn't have one thing
[1:52:26] to do with it it rises again because God
[1:52:29] set a law for it to rise again oh I hope
[1:52:33] you understand
[1:52:35] I hope it gets down into your soul
[1:52:37] tonight he said you are made and born
[1:52:40] and placed here in the body of Christ as
[1:52:42] Sons and Daughters of God you don't have
[1:52:46] to knock down to the devil we've got a
[1:52:50] law That's the Law of the Holy Spirit
[1:52:52] the only thing you know see have to do
[1:52:55] is know how to let go and let God in
[1:52:59] your trial know how to let go and let
[1:53:02] God in your Temptations learn how to
[1:53:05] know to let let go and let God when the
[1:53:08] devil is fighting your mind how to let
[1:53:11] go and just let God Amen throw them
[1:53:14] thoughts away throw everything away and
[1:53:18] say Satan I stand here under a law of
[1:53:20] God I have a new headship
[1:53:25] he said see you got to know
[1:53:27] how to let go and let God you keep
[1:53:29] fighting at it and it won't never work
[1:53:33] but when you let go and let God that's
[1:53:35] all that's just all you do
[1:53:37] can you say Amen
[1:53:39] do you love him
[1:53:42] he says see Fish talks about that fish
[1:53:45] and how the fish he doesn't fight for
[1:53:47] that law
[1:53:48] it's got a law within it that it can
[1:53:50] swim to the depths of the ocean
[1:53:53] so he doesn't fight against that law he
[1:53:55] doesn't say well let me hold my breath
[1:54:01] see how low I could go brother Brandon
[1:54:02] said if he'd done that it would burst
[1:54:06] you see you don't see the bird
[1:54:09] fighting against the law
[1:54:12] that it has within it to fly
[1:54:15] okay let's see here now okay I'm gonna
[1:54:17] stand back a little bit now I'm gonna
[1:54:18] run and maybe I can do this thing
[1:54:21] and you see him trying to woo
[1:54:25] brother Brian said if he'd done that he
[1:54:27] would fall
[1:54:29] right
[1:54:32] he said they don't fight against it they
[1:54:34] yield to it
[1:54:36] and he said that's the same way with us
[1:54:38] it isn't what we fight in pool and hurry
[1:54:41] oh if I don't get this if I don't get
[1:54:43] that that's not it
[1:54:45] if if you're in that state oh I got it I
[1:54:47] got it I got I gotta quit it quit it
[1:54:49] quit it quit it relax take it easy
[1:54:53] he said that's not it it's to know that
[1:54:56] the law of life is in you
[1:54:58] and you just let go and let God then he
[1:55:01] takes you to your healing he takes you
[1:55:02] to the baptism of the spirit or anything
[1:55:04] that he's promised any claim that he's
[1:55:07] given is yours and by letting go
[1:55:10] and letting God
[1:55:13] he restoreth my soul
[1:55:15] you love him
[1:55:17] amen I hope that's all right
[1:55:21] he said you just think of it just think
[1:55:24] if you had someone come and steal break
[1:55:27] into your home
[1:55:28] and he stowed something and the
[1:55:30] policeman caught him
[1:55:32] the law enforcement caught him and he's
[1:55:34] going to take him to court
[1:55:36] to be tried
[1:55:39] and you grab him no no no no hold up
[1:55:41] hold it just a moment I just don't know
[1:55:42] if I should
[1:55:44] and you keep pulling him back and he's
[1:55:46] trying he's working getting him
[1:55:48] getting Justice for you and you keep
[1:55:51] holding him back he said he'll never get
[1:55:53] to court
[1:55:54] he said you're trying to hold back the
[1:55:56] very thing that is the enforcement
[1:55:59] for you
[1:56:02] ain't that right
[1:56:05] and so he says see
[1:56:11] he said see he said he'll never he said
[1:56:14] he'll never get him there just let him
[1:56:17] go
[1:56:18] let the officer go let him do his job
[1:56:21] let him go
[1:56:23] right
[1:56:25] and he said that's the way you do let
[1:56:27] Satan just get away all the doubts and
[1:56:30] everything flee from your mind then God
[1:56:32] will raise you up
[1:56:34] God will raise you up just just relax
[1:56:38] quit worrying about it
[1:56:41] well I just don't know I just don't know
[1:56:43] well just
[1:56:45] cast that thing aside say I'm not going
[1:56:47] to dwell on that no more you're saying
[1:56:49] won't dwell on it
[1:56:51] yeah but I just don't feel Worthy
[1:56:54] good Lord
[1:56:55] you talk to anyone no one feels Worthy
[1:56:58] the prophet didn't feel worthy but you
[1:57:00] know what he let it go
