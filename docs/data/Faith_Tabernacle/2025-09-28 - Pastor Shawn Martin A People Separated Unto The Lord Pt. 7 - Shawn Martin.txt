Amen. and uh can't can't praise him enough or thank him enough for what he's done for us and what he's continuing to do. Amen. And certainly love the Lord. Uh good to be here in the house of the Lord once again and um enjoyed that rain last night and uh but um glad we're able to um come together this morning and to worship him and be able to u have fellowship afterward. Amen. with uh each other. And amen. Um the musicians can be dismissed. Um if you have your Bibles, we're going to turn again to Deuteronomy the 7th chapter. And certainly enjoyed the specials this morning. And uh just good to just see everyone in the house of the Lord. Um, some of you have heard, you know, that we were having the fall festival at Camp Tuckaway, uh, which was true. And then some of you have heard that the location was changed to Camp Christie, which was also true. And then some of you have heard that we weren't having it at all, which was true, too. Uh but um I'm here to give the final notice or final word on this. We are having the fall festival. It's going to be on November 2nd, the original date. And um it's going to be at the Pilot Community Center. So just keep that in mind. um the pilot community center and uh um we have um we believe it it'll work for us and um they're only um they're I think well it's going to be 35 a day so $70 so this this is good this is an improvement of the others and so it may not the uh the Hampton Inn or Hilton, but it'll work, right? And so, uh, we just want to remember that. And we appreciate Brother John, uh, looking into that for us. And, um, he, um, um, actually he wanted to pay for it. And we thought it was actually going to be about $200 or so, but, it worked out that, um, it would be about $70. And so we really appreciate brother John to looking into that and helping us out and and uh so looking forward to a wonderful time. Amen. And um so then uh after the service this morning right after um we're going to have a baptism. Um uh Ruth uh she came the other day asking if she could be baptized and and um so uh you know we're thankful for that and and so uh the Lord willing we'll be uh having that right after service and then of course having fellowship after that there at the the frog pond uh just right down the road and uh so believe we'll have a good time today. Uh so let's read uh Deuteronomy the 7th chapter and um I'm going to start at the first verse again. And uh when the Lord thy God shall bring thee into the land, whether thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the Hittites, the the Geresites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou. And when the Lord thy God shall deliver them before thee, thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them, thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor show mercy unto them. Neither shalt thou make marriages with them, thy daughter. Thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son. For they will turn away thy son from following me. That they may serve other gods, so will the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly. But thus you shall deal with them. Um, thus shall you deal with them. You shall break down, destroy their altars, break down their images, cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire. For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God. The Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the earth. The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because you were more in number than any people. For you were the fewest of all people, but because the Lord loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, that the Lord brought hath the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondman, from the hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. Know therefore that the Lord thy God, he is God the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with him that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations. Then let's go to the familiar scripture that we've been using and that's Isaiah 43. Isaiah 43 and1 we will start. I love how the Lord just expresses the desires of his heart through his promises. But now, thus saith the Lord that created thee, oh Jacob, he that formed thee, oh Israel, fear not, for I have redeemed thee. I have called thee by thy name, thou art mine. When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee, and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee. When thou walst through the fire, thou shalt not be burned, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee. He's making it very known, whatever they go through. And we'll put it the way whatever we go through, it ain't going to hurt us for he's with us. &gt;&gt; For I am the holy I am the Lord thy God, the holy one of Israel, thy savior. I gave Egypt for thy ransom Ethiopia and Zeba for thee. Since thou was precious in my sight, thou hast been honorable, and I have loved thee. Therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life. Fear not, for I am with thee. I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west. I will say to the north, give up, and to the south, keep not back. Bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the ends of the earth, even everyone that is called by my name. For I have created him for my glory. I have formed him. Yay, I have made him. Now, how is he going to gather? By his word. Ain't that right? He gathers by his word. And I was just reading a what the prophet said about the voice of God. He said, "It's the creative voice of God in this day, and it's it's the roll call. It's the roll call. Calling those names that were on the Lamb's Book of Life." &gt;&gt; Amen. Gathering them together. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. And this voice has the power to call those out of the grave. It's going to change our bodies. But there's a gathering that's happening now. Ain't that right? And then Acts 1:8. Um, but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you, and you shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, unto the uttermost parts of the earth. Amen. Let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer. Lord Jesus, we believe that we have gathered here not on human strength or human will, but we believe it's divine order. It's an appointment, a divine appointment, Lord, that we're gathered here. There's something Lord within us that woke us up with a desire to come to the house of God, Father. And we believe that this isn't just a natural meeting. It's a an internal something. It's a spiritual thing. and Lord, that when we leave here, we'll be eternally uh better, more prepared, more ready for the event at hand. And Lord, just asking, Father, that you would just have your way, God, just take anything that's not like you, take it out of our lives. Father, may we humble ourselves more to the word of God and learn to be more submitted and surrender to you that you could have your way within us and create a an eternal work within us. Father, I pray that you would bless the people this morning, been faithful, diligent to come, maybe weary in their body, their minds, going through things spiritually or physically, and yet they've come to the house of God to worship you and to show their appreciation to you. And I pray, Father, that you would just anoint the word, anoint the ministering of your word as well as the hearing. We just commit it into your hands now in Jesus Christ's name. And the church says, "Amen." And amen. You can be seated. So going to use the title again, holiness, a people separated unto the Lord. And we've talked about what holiness would be. would be be set apart, sanctified, dedicated, consecrated unto God. And so as the bride of Christ, we are we are to uh be separated um a separated people from the world. a separated from the habits and fashions of the world. Um the Bible tells us you know not to be conformed to the world but be transformed. &gt;&gt; Now just in that scripture there and what the prophet tells us there's two powers at work in this age that we're living in. One power is bringing a deforming. It's a power of uh to deform. So when Paul is saying don't be conformed to the world, don't don't come under the that deforming power that would twist you up and and demoralize you and to make you something that God never intended. &gt;&gt; True. Don't come under that power because that power will conform you to the world but be transformed and and brother Brown said that's another power that's the power of transformation &gt;&gt; ain't that right &gt;&gt; so we are to be different which can only come by the power of transformation you you can't be good enough you can't be more loyal than than any other person to make you good enough. You that that's not you've got to be transformed. &gt;&gt; You got to be transformed. And and and and this transformation cannot come unless our mind is renewed. For that's what Paul said, be transformed by the renewing of your mind. So you can't the the the your mind must be renewed to be come under this power of transformation. Well, the only way to have our minds renewed is to take on the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And and brother Brandon would tell us now the things that you once thought upon, it's talking about taking the mind of Christ, being renewed, the things that you once thought upon to be precious, lay that aside &gt;&gt; and be transformed to something else. &gt;&gt; Take on a new thought, take on a new attribute, new mind, new new uh way of life. Be transformed to something else. what you was one time to what you are now. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So another place he says we want the mind of Christ or we want the mind that was in Christ to be in us &gt;&gt; that we might be transformed from the natural things of life and be brought in to do the perfect will of God. Amenise the Lord. &gt;&gt; By transformation of God's spirit by his word. &gt;&gt; So then the transformation isn't just mind over matter or just just um what would that word be? Um you know going from one thought to another thought. um uh one doctrine to another doctrine, one school to another school. Um you know, it's it's it's not that, but there's there's got to be this transformation, and the transformation can only come by his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so then the thought would come that uh brother Brown says, "I'm thoroughly convinced that my message comes from God." Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm thoroughly convinced it's not my own fleshly mind puffed up. &gt;&gt; It's the word of God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So then I I think we could all say that the power of transformation lays in this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the token he says we're not to come together to talk about the message. We are come together to get in the message and the message is Christ. &gt;&gt; He is the word. That's right. To get into it. Get beneath it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's what we're supposed to do. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So, notice what he says. We're to get beneath it. Ain't that right? Get beneath the message. Get into the message. Later on down in that same uh sermon, he says, "You must come under this token, &gt;&gt; God's Holy Spirit." &gt;&gt; And it displays to you Jesus Christ because it comes and lives in you. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So he says, "Oh little people, my brother, sister, get under that token quickly. Don't take no substitute. Don't don't don't don't do that. Don't just imagine it. You stay there until you know that the token is applied. &gt;&gt; Until you're whole. He says the mind that was in Christ is in you. Stay there until the mind of Christ is in you. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? That's what happens when you about this message. When you take the message and you believe wholeheartedly, then the mind of Christ comes into you. &gt;&gt; He says, "And and uh the mind that was in Christ is in you until all the nonsense of the world is gone. &gt;&gt; Until the whole heart's desire is him, &gt;&gt; then you know something is happening." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. So I I I I truly believe that without this message our minds cannot be renewed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's time that our minds because God would send the power of transformation. &gt;&gt; This transformation is not just happen when our bodies are changed from mortal to immortal. It's happening now. &gt;&gt; Amen. by the renewing of our mind. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So we we find that we're not to be conformed to the world. And and the word conformed again is to give the same shape, &gt;&gt; the same outline or contour &gt;&gt; to bring into harmony or accord to be similar or identical. &gt;&gt; So we're not to give the same shape as the world. not to give the same contour to or to come into harmony with the world or be identical or even similar &gt;&gt; to the world. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now we know that the church and the world has drifted so far &gt;&gt; from from uh the word of God and is continuing to do so. And the prophet tells us why. Because there's a power of deformation. Satan's power is deforming them. Not just the sinners out there, but the churches. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; But we as the bride of Christ are conforming more into the image of God, into the image of Christ till there is a vast difference between the two. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; There is a vast difference between the bride of Christ and the nominal church. &gt;&gt; There's a vast difference between the bride of Christ and the world. There has to be. But why is it? Because mind over matter? No. We're under the power of transformation. We're being transformed by the renewing of our mind. We ought to be thankful that God sent a message. &gt;&gt; We must never let this message become just uh something common to us. &gt;&gt; It's the only way that we can be transformed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Which makes us an odd people. And and the more we live, the more time uh continues, the more odd we're going to become. Not that we're making ourselves odd, not that we're trying to be different. It's just we believe the message &gt;&gt; and and and we are back to the original thoughts of God. &gt;&gt; The world is becoming more adverse or contrary to the thoughts of God. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? They're getting more ready for judgment. &gt;&gt; We're getting more ready for the rapture. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're getting more prepared to be a man for the wedding supper of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. So the holiness holiness set apart separated. It's it's holiness is the way of the Christian life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's a separated life. the center of doing things. He has his own way. The religious church has their own way, church members. But the bride has has a way of doing things. And the way of the bride, the Bible would call, is the way of holiness. Isaiah 35:8 it says, "And an highway shall there be and a way, and it shall be called the way of holiness." Everybody say, "The way of holiness." &gt;&gt; The unclean shall not pass over it, but it shall be for those, the wayfaring men, though fools shall not heir therein. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So if you notice, it'll be a highway. There's a highway and a way. &gt;&gt; Now, people would call that way the highway of holiness. &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "It's not the highway of holiness. It's the way of holiness." &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? There's a certain way to walk holiness. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's a way of holiness. And so we think of a highway, you know, it's like we get down, you know, on the highway here and and car going this way and car going this way and and one brother, you know, he told brother Brandon says, "Man, you know, uh, it's dangerous then to get on that highway. You're going to get killed. You're going to get hit." Brother Brandon says, "No, it's not the highway that we thinking of. It's a oneway. Everybody going one way. If you're on that highway, you're going one way. Can you say amen? And there's a way of holiness. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a one-way street. Now, notice the prophet said the way of holiness is in the middle of the road, balanced. Ain't that right? All the trash is washed to either side of the road. Brother Brown tells us that on the side on one side of the highway is the emotional and fanatical side. On the other side of the highway is the cold formal intellectual side. So he says the main thing is right in the middle of the road with enough spirit in you to keep you warm and moving &gt;&gt; and knowing enough to keep yourself under obedience to the spirit to move just as the spirit moves. Not till, not after, just as the spirit moves. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. He says each side of the each side is where the offs is found. All the heirs are not found in the in the middle of the road. The way of holiness. The heirs are found on the side of the road wrecked up somewhere. He said that's where each side is where the off falls is found. That's where you won this brethren. You went to one side and the trinitarian went off to the other side. But the true message lays in the center of the road. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Calvinist goes into one side and Arminium goes on the other side, but the message stays right in the middle of the road. And so when you're walking in this way of holiness, you're not getting so fanatical to this and some extreme to this. You're just staying right in the middle of the road moving to a rapture. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. So you walk in this way of holiness, it separates you because not everybody can walk this way of holiness. When they get into the extremes of things and they get fanatical to things and they get cold in formal things and all of that, it separates them. They they can't walk this way of holiness because you got to stay balanced. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the way of holiness was established at Calvary. Amen. And it was at Calvary that Satan broke the powers of Satan. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and and the prophet says, "See, he opened Christ opened the prison doors of hell to every man that was shut up in this earth in the prisons, fearing what death would be to him when he died. But Christ opened those cell doors and let every captive free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have to no longer yield your members to sin. &gt;&gt; And I say this, you don't have to wreck up in your Christian walk. &gt;&gt; You don't have to backslide. I know the prophet said we backslide every day and we have to repent every day. That's not what I'm talking about. You don't have to get so cold and dead and and backslid to where you don't know what the spirit of God is anymore. &gt;&gt; You don't have to do that. You don't have to get to drinking and smoking and telling lies and gambling and and all of these things. Why? Because God made a way that you can walk this highway or this way of holiness. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on. Before a man can enter that highway to start walking the way of holiness, amen, he first has to come to the fountain, amen, of blood. &gt;&gt; The fountain filled with blood and be cleansed. Can you say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's the beginning of of getting on the way of holiness and living a separated life. You know, the prophet tells us, you don't you don't have to be mean. You don't have to be snobby to people. You don't have to be arrogant and stuck up and and rude and act like we're better than somebody else. &gt;&gt; But here's what a prophet says. He says we're to live a life of genuine holiness that the fruits of the spirit might be seen in us. &gt;&gt; Can't be seen in just a regular church member. &gt;&gt; It ain't going to be found in the world of things. It's going to be found in somebody that's walking in that way of holiness. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? That the fruits of the spirit may be seen in us of meekness and gentleness and patience and longsuffering and faith. See, it's the fruits of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen. You can be kind to people and and friendly to people and yet keep your garments undefiled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Not get confused when you're on the job or at school or at the grocery store and confused of who you are &gt;&gt; and ashamed of who you are. I am the bride of Christ &gt;&gt; and I ain't going to defile myself with this world. &gt;&gt; Let them do what they want to do and I'll be kind to them and I'll reach out to them and try to pull them in. But as far as for me in my house, I'm going to serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even though real holiness starts within the heart of man as it does, men we have found have tried to start with holiness on the outside. Just like brother Brandham talked about, you know, some women can have their long hair and steal a temper as as a buzzaw. you know, fighting. Well, see, they they trying to start it from the outside, but holiness actually is an inward work. &gt;&gt; It starts in the heart of man. &gt;&gt; It separates us. That's where the separation starts is in the in the heart of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. It takes the desires away. It takes the wantto's away. It takes all of the the carnal uh things that we're that that will come against the word. It takes it all away to where that we can come into agreement with that word. Ain't that right? But then it has an outward manifestation. &gt;&gt; You believe that &gt;&gt; holiness has an out man an outward manifestation. It does matter. And I want to say to you young people, it matters how we dress. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I say to us all, it matters how we conduct ourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It matters what we listen to and what we watch. &gt;&gt; It matters what we talk about. &gt;&gt; It matters uh the places we go. &gt;&gt; It matters. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, and and it it matters to God and it should also matter to us as believers. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Matthew 5:16, Jesus says, "Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works." They may not see what's in your heart, but they'll see, amen, your good works. By your good works, then they know, amen, that what is in your heart. &gt;&gt; That's right. So let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and to glorify not you. &gt;&gt; We're not doing this for us to be seen. &gt;&gt; We're we're not manifesting works for for for the the sake of the church. &gt;&gt; We're doing it that our glorified &gt;&gt; by those that see our works. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? How many wants God to be glorified? &gt;&gt; I want God to be seen. Amen. And that men may glorify him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we are not to be men pleasers or slaves to people's opinions and ideas. &gt;&gt; You know, people try to mold us into what they think we should be and what they think we should do. Most of the time it's out of out of line with biblical teaching. &gt;&gt; But God wants us to stay with his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which goes back to the message of the hour. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So then the light that we are to shine is to be scriptural light. &gt;&gt; Right? That's the only light there is is scriptural light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Outside of light, there's darkness. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So this is how the father is glorified. Not when I do a good deed. Not when I do something that the world thinks I should do, &gt;&gt; but when my light has become a scriptural light. and they see that I'm in obedience with the scriptures. They see that that that I'm walking according to what God has desired for this age. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, the Bible shows us that what we do outwardly is important because it's the only way that the people can see what we are. You take take Abraham for an example. Paul tells us that Abraham, he was justified by faith. James tells us he was justified by works. &gt;&gt; And so it it it it looks like there's a contradiction between the two men and what they've written. And you know, I I've actually had, you know, um um a brother, you know, um back years ago uh preach on this and said there's a contradiction there, but there's not a contradiction. &gt;&gt; And I thank God for a prophet that would show us what it's all about. &gt;&gt; Take the contradictions away that we could understand these. Can you say amen? And so Paul when he's saying that Abraham was justifed by uh justified by his faith he was saying that's what God justified him by &gt;&gt; faith. Amen. Uh the faith of Abraham. When James is saying that Abraham was justified by his works, he's saying that's what man justified him by. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. It's one thing to say I have faith. I believe. Amen. And it's another thing to act upon that faith. It's one thing to love God and say, "I love God and Jesus is my Lord." It's another thing to show forth them works &gt;&gt; to prove it. Can you say amen? Now, the Bible says that God looks upon the heart. And of course, if you talk to anybody out, especially when you're look talking of of dress codes and things like that, this scripture is the most often used and in misinterpreted, &gt;&gt; you know, cuz it Well, God loves me just the way I am. He looks upon the heart, &gt;&gt; ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And that's true. He does look upon the heart, but man can't see your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hello. &gt;&gt; He can't see what's in your heart, but he can see the manifestation &gt;&gt; of what's in your heart. &gt;&gt; You can't hold things in your heart and not it manifest. &gt;&gt; You hold bitterness in your heart, it's going to manifest somewhere. &gt;&gt; You'll start talking about somebody, you're going to start dealing with it. You'll you'll you'll skirt around them. you when his the name's mentioned, all of a sudden there's just something rises up and and you want to you you just want to spew it out &gt;&gt; because there's a bitterness there. Well, when when there's a love, you know, uh uh you you you love somebody and you know, you love your wife and you love your husband and and and you you you you can't just, you know, go go without showing some affection somewhere. &gt;&gt; You want to be with them. You you you want to let him know just how much you love her, &gt;&gt; how much you love him. Can you say amen? There there's a manifestation somewhere because it's what's in your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Well, if God's in our hearts, Amen. We can't wait for the church doors to open. God's in our hearts. We we just can't we we can't just sit there without some emotion or expression &gt;&gt; of what God has done for us. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; See, so God made it to where that whatever is in a man's heart, he will manifest it by his works. So then if we believe God's word then our works will declare that to be true. &gt;&gt; If if God is in our heart then our works will declare that to be true. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; If we love God then our works will declare that to be true &gt;&gt; because it's down in our hearts. &gt;&gt; Now God hates sin. And our works manifest that. If God is in our heart, that God hates sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so if he's in our hearts, then our works manifested by doing what Paul said, abstain from the appearance of sin. &gt;&gt; Right? So when we abstain from sin, when we abstain from things that are defiled and against God's word and and all of these things, then it's a it's a proof. It's something that is showing there's something holy down in our hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; This allows the people to see the holiness of God through us. See, we're reflectors. How many believes that &gt;&gt; God is love and God in our heart we reflect love. We reflect his love to others. God is holy. We reflect his holiness to others. God is gentle. We reflect his gentleness to others. God is the God of peace. We reflect his peace to others. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? See, and and and so this is why that God called us and separated us from the world that he could express himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. The purpose of Jesus coming to the earth was to show God. &gt;&gt; It's what the prophet said. &gt;&gt; That's why he come to this earth is to show God. Amen. And and for he was God. And he uh John 3:16, for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life. Ain't that right? So he come as the expression of God's love. &gt;&gt; God himself had to express his love &gt;&gt; and he expressed it through his son. &gt;&gt; Sent his son to express that love. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so the Son was the body that God dwelt in. Uh uh John 14:10, "Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?" Jesus says, "The words that I speak unto you, I speak not of myself, but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works." &gt;&gt; Now, Jesus was very well aware of the role that he was to play upon the earth. &gt;&gt; He knew that he was sent for a purpose. He identified himself in the scriptures. He did not identify himself as Moses trying to take Moses' spot or rebuild Moses's ministry or whatever. He identified that Moses spoke of him &gt;&gt; and and and so he found his place and he knew that he was a witness of God. &gt;&gt; The prophet said that that Jesus was a witness of God. anybody. The church couldn't be a witness of God. They were being a witness of themselves &gt;&gt; and and man's ideas and man's creed. They had drifted so far off the beaten path that they no longer become a reflection of God. &gt;&gt; That God sent his son to the world. Amen. And and he would he would play a role to where God could be manifested through him. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was to do the will of God. He had to sub subject his own will to do that. He had to surrender himself to the father's will. How many believes that? &gt;&gt; We know that Satan tried to get him to do something outside of the will of God, outside of what was written of him in the word. tried to get him to do something outside, but Christ was disciplined &gt;&gt; to the father's will. &gt;&gt; Satan was able to get everybody else in that in that day, but he couldn't get him. &gt;&gt; He lived a separated life to where the influence of Satan couldn't get to him. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; That's right. How, you know, how how could the people know that God was among them if if Jesus went about doing his own will, &gt;&gt; doing about what he wanted to do, being just uh what we what would call freelancers, &gt;&gt; just just just doing anything that he wants to do and and h how could they know the power of God if the father couldn't work his will in him? See, the father wouldn't been able to vindicate him. The father wouldn't been able to set his approval on him if Jesus was constantly ignoring the word and and and ignoring his position and and and just wanting to do everything else. And we know he had to struggle with that. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; For he was tempted in all points as we are. It was at Calvary at at Gold Gulf or or or the Garden of Gethsemane that he said, "Let uh let let this cut pass from me if it be thy will." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; That's what he did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If he was too busy trying to make friends with people or trying to please people, then he wouldn't have been able to show God to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he loved people. He wanted to help people, but he realized he was there for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; His his help to people was far greater than than than than the church organizations uh uh feeding the poor. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; His help. Can you say amen? We can feed the poor, but ain't going to set their soul free. We we can build hospitals, but it ain't going to do what we what needs to be done. &gt;&gt; So Jesus knew that he came to show God to the people. &gt;&gt; Yes, you did. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandaman speaking to the people said, "You got so much world on you that God can't reflect himself through you." See, the church wanting to be more like the world. the church wanting to be more more uh immersed with the world things to blend in and they say to try to help. &gt;&gt; They say we're showing more compassion. They say we're doing a greater work. Amen. By blending in. We got pastors now that you know and and not in the message. I hope not. Amen. But but they they they come out in jeans and they'll have hoes and in their pants and the shirt out of their pants and and wacky hair do all in the name of trying to help people. &gt;&gt; Trying to blend in with the people. You understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Amen. And and it's getting so far-fetched that they're blending in and they forget that holiness is a separated life. Christianity is a way of holiness, &gt;&gt; walking pleasing to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; So he said you got so much world on you that God can't reflect himself through you. &gt;&gt; So see Jesus could not take on the habits of the world. Amen. And and and conform to the church organizations and and still reflect the father. He had to stay in his position. Yes, you do. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; He had to stay in his position. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was despised and rejected because of it. &gt;&gt; He was mocked and scorned, spat upon. He suffered pain and heartache. All these things. But did you notice we as the as the elect of God benefited from it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We benefited from it. He stayed in his position and we benefited. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that when you stay in your position, people benefit from it? &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; When a man will stay in his position in in in in the role that he has to play within a marriage, within his family, &gt;&gt; his family benefits from that. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; When a wife will stay in her position and mother stays in her position, the family benefits from it. &gt;&gt; The husband benefits, the children benefit. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; See, when we stay in our position, Jesus stayed in his position. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He did. &gt;&gt; He knew what God had called him to do, and he stayed right in the middle of the road with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And because of it, look where we're headed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We benefited from it. Paul speaks of Christ saying, "Though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor that ye through his poverty might be rich." &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So he stayed true to what God called him to do for our sakes. He suffered because he didn't compromise. He was rejected because he wouldn't go with the popular trend. &gt;&gt; He felt the loneliness because he didn't forsake the call upon his life. &gt;&gt; But I benefited. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; According to Ephesians 1:23, the church is his body. How many believes that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are the church, right? Yes, &gt;&gt; we become part of his church not because we go to Faith Tabernacle or some other church, &gt;&gt; but because we are born of the spirit. &gt;&gt; For by one spirit are we all baptized into one body. &gt;&gt; This church, Paul says, is the fullness of Christ. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? That fullness of him that filleth all in all. So notice what in John and I hope this all right this morning &gt;&gt; but John 15:5 Jesus speaks to the church saying I am the vine you are the branches. He that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So then what is it? The vine produces the life the prophet said and the branches bear the fruit. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So notice what the prophet said. We are his hands on earth. How many believes that? &gt;&gt; We are his hands upon this earth. We are his feet upon this earth. We are his mouth upon this earth. We are his eyes. We are we are his body. We are his gospel on earth. And the gospel is not all together by word. The word made manifest. Everybody say the word made manifest &gt;&gt; is the gospel and we are his gospel. &gt;&gt; We are that word made manifest. Not manifesting the thoughts of what the world thinks. &gt;&gt; Let him ridicule us. Let him despise us. But let us maintain the purpose &gt;&gt; that we are called to. And that is to be his body, his gospel, the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; Somebody's going to benefit from it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he's in order for this to happen, notice God, the prophet said God takes the person and begins to mold himself into that person. And a lot of times we think, oh, him molding himself into us, that's awesome. A lot of times that hurts. A lot of time there's a cutting away of our desires and our flesh and killing out and oh, a lot of times we're crying and we're boohooing and asking why do this have to happen and why do this have to happen and and oh my and it seemed like our world is turned upside down. But he's molding himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, make his hands do what God would have hands to do. Make his lips speak what God's lips would speak because they're not his. They're God's. &gt;&gt; God begins to build a character, begins to take this weakness, our weaknesses, and to make his own self. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Yes. make his own self. &gt;&gt; I don't know. I don't know about you, but there's a lot of things I live with with regrets and I think, "Oh, God, why did it have to happen that way? Why couldn't I have done this and why couldn't I have done this?" But see, God takes our weaknesses &gt;&gt; and he begins to mold himself, molds his character. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, and I hope this is making a little sense to you today. At the time of the first Exodus in the Bible, God commanded that Israel put blood upon the door uh post of their house. Why? It was going to separate them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That blood would be the separation from all other homes, right? &gt;&gt; God looking for something to separate them. &gt;&gt; Yes. So he says the only way that this will separate you from all these others is the blood, &gt;&gt; the token. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So he commanded them to take and kill a lamb and then put that blood amen uh uh on their home for it would be a token that the lamb had died in their place. That way when the death angel come, he would know that there was a difference between this home and that home &gt;&gt; cuz he was coming to strike death in a home. &gt;&gt; And there had to be a separation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If there wasn't a separation, he would strike every home. He would strike everything in the land. that God would tell his people now make sure there's a separation &gt;&gt; because it doesn't matter what church you go to. It doesn't matter if you're circumcised. It doesn't matter, you know, if if you are of the lineage of Reuben or of Joseph or of Abraham or whatever. There had to be a token for separation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the token had to be on display. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right? &gt;&gt; The lamb was on inside the house. &gt;&gt; We got Jesus on the inside of our hearts, &gt;&gt; but there had to be a display. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And so, uh, it had to be on display. And brother Bram said, "Christianity has to display its token publicly &gt;&gt; in public life &gt;&gt; at the office, on the streets." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; At the store. Amen. &gt;&gt; When trouble is around, &gt;&gt; when you're in the valley or when you're on the mountaintop, &gt;&gt; the token's got to be displayed. &gt;&gt; There's got to be a difference. &gt;&gt; We all go through trials, but let the token be the difference. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; We all go through our troubles. We all fight things. But the difference is there's a token displayed &gt;&gt; when trouble is around anything in the church or everywhere else. He said see a man or a woman uh who is filled with the Holy Ghost. He is sealed away and secured from all harm and danger. His whole life displays what he is. Wherever he walks, whatever business he does, whoever he talks with, when he comes in contact with women, when he comes in contact with associates, when he comes in contact with everything, that token is laying there. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for the token? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Because that's the only thing that's the difference &gt;&gt; is the token. Amen. The token doesn't show that you're a Baptist. It doesn't show that you're a good Pentecostal &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't even show you're a good message &gt;&gt; guy. It It doesn't show that you're a apostolic or whatever else. You know what the token does? It shows that you're redeemed. &gt;&gt; It shows you're going somewhere and it ain't the tribulation. It shows it's separating you. I know everybody's calling themselves Christians, but there's a token that's showing a difference. &gt;&gt; I know everybody's saying we're on our way to heaven. I don't care. They can sing rock and roll and country and and and and and blaspheme God and be a reverend in the churches and all that. But the token makes the difference. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. token makes the difference is who's going to set up that marriage supper. &gt;&gt; So God brought a separation in this day. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you've been separated? &gt;&gt; Not because I'm smarter, but a token God gave. &gt;&gt; Not because of my goodwill. I have fallen so many time. But there is a token &gt;&gt; that shows the difference. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. The token shows that you're in a place of safety. Death is striking the land and we know it. Spiritual death is striking. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; People are becoming more dead and cold and backslid and formal and indifferent to the things of God and yet sitting in the pews. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. But the token separates us from that. Yes, we may fall. Yes, we may get discouraged. Yes, we go through our trials. Yes, we go through things that it just looks like we ain't going to make it. But there's a token that makes the difference. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It shows that I'm in a place of safety. Satan can't touch me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, by the token being on display, you're showing to the outside world, to the people, to the sinners, to the the unbelievers and make believers, to everybody that you're associated with. You're showing to them where the life truly is. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; yes, sir. See, I think we ought to care for one another enough to show them where the place of safety is. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; I think we ought to love the sitter so much to that we can show him where he can get under a token. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Not to blend in for a token won't let you blend in. &gt;&gt; Amen. The token keeps you separated. &gt;&gt; But somebody needs to see the token. &gt;&gt; Somebody needs to see that there is something that separates. &gt;&gt; It can separate them from the judgment. It can separate them from their sins. You see, there are people who will not read the Bible. Therefore, we are the only Bible that people ever read. You know that. That's what a prophet said. People won't read the Bible. There's a lot of folks sad sadly won't read the Bible. There's a lot of people you come in contact that has never even opened that Bible up. Don't even know what the Bible means. But you are that Bible on display. &gt;&gt; That's right. People can't see heaven. Therefore, our life must reflect heaven to them. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? They can't see God. But our life must reflect God to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not only important, and I won't keep you much longer, but it's not only important that we be holy as individuals, but our marriage should be holy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our family should be holy. Our home should be holy. &gt;&gt; Amen. I wished I would have kept I had a quote and I didn't know whether to use it or not. But if you go back, brother Brandman said we should never talking about us men, we should never treat our wives in a filthy way. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even though they're our wives, we should never bring them under what the world is doing &gt;&gt; in filthy ways in our home. They are our sisters. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Prophet said, "Your wife is your sister. She's a daughter of God." &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; See, it it it's got to be holy. It it matters. I want to say this. It matters what we have in our homes. That's right. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, it's just a natural house that we dwell in. It matters to God." &gt;&gt; Cuz here, you know, if you're going to if you're going to apply the token house, it's going to matter. &gt;&gt; Prophet, you know what? What do we do when we apply the token to our house? The prophet says, "Move all the trash out." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Have a house cleaning party. Men and women, kick out the shorts. Throw away the cigarettes. Move out the short skirts, the cards, the television. This is what his words are. And whatever more. Get all this old stuff out of the system here that's called the world. If you love the world or the things of the world is because the love of God is not even in you. all the dances, parties, rock and roll, old vulgar newspapers, and that that and the stuff that's of the world, kick it out the door and say, "We're cleaning out this place around here." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; All these love stories and romance and all of these things, kick it out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Why? We're applying a token. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It matters what we have in our home. Brother Bram says, "Today, we've walked and rode. We've took our children to televisions and uncensored programs. We've let our floors and our tables become full of old, dirty, sexy love stories instead of the word of God. There isn't a kid in this city. But what knows more about Author Godfrey or Elvis Presley or Pat Boon or Davy Crockett than they do know about Jesus Christ? That's straight. But oh, it's true. No wonder there's a falling away. &gt;&gt; So the falling away starts in the home. &gt;&gt; I say it starts in the house, in the heart, &gt;&gt; and then it manifests itself in the home. When people start getting backslid in their heart and they start getting indifferent in their heart, then it starts manifesting in the home. They let loose here and they get latched here and they get lax there. That's why you cannot entertain any devil. You cannot entertain spirits. I don't care how discouraged you get, maintain your position. [Music] &gt;&gt; You've got to maintain it. That's right. &gt;&gt; You might get weary. You might get battle scarred. It does not matter. &gt;&gt; Stay under the token. &gt;&gt; Keep separated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; What we bring into the home affects us. &gt;&gt; And the things of the world will cause us to lose our first love. Brother Brandham, he's talking and he's he's dealing in the Ephesian age, church age, the Phil, you know, and where God says, "You've left your first love." But I like how he as he's talking, God speaking, he's also bringing it out in our age, &gt;&gt; cuz we know he didn't have they didn't have a lot of those things that we have today. But he says, he says, "See, you've left grace and faith and power to swap it for labor and works." Well, I tell you, Brother Brandham, I help every widow woman I can. Well, that's a good thing. I commend you for that. But where's that first love you once had? Uh-huh. Where's that joy you used to have? As David once cried, "Oh Lord, restore to me the joy of my salvation. Where's them all night prayer meetings and tears on your cheek? My goodness, the Bible's even dusty. Got cobwebs on it. You read old love stories and news and things that oughten to even be allowed to be published and put for a trash can and we Pentecostal people pick them up and just loft over them like a bunch of flies on a garbage can. He said, "That's right. Oh mercy, what we need is is get back to our first love. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Hey, the more you serve God, the longer you serve God, the more hurt you're going to get. &gt;&gt; The more we get close to one another, the more we're going to see our hinder parts. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; If I if I stayed away from Brother Amos, I'd say, "Oh, Brother Amos is a good man. That guy's an angel now. But and he may he'll say that to me, but the more we fellowship, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He might say, man, he is a little different. And I'm like, wow, I don't know why he would have said that or why he done that, you know? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But see what's happening? We're getting to know one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the more we get to know one another, we're not just knowing our good side, we're knowing the bad sides. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So then the thing, what's the next thing Satan going to do? Get us to dwell on the bad side of brother Amos or the bad side of Shawn Martin &gt;&gt; and then we just walk away and not fellowship. I'd rather I'd rather love him from afar. Well, that's not what brother Brandham said. That's not what the Bible says. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not to love each other from afar to where we don't have to put up with one another. Rab said we got to put up with one another. &gt;&gt; Put up with our mistakes. Put up with our failures. &gt;&gt; Put up with our stupidities. &gt;&gt; Why? There's a token. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope you understand. &gt;&gt; I'd rather put up with one of us. I hope you'd rather put up with me than put up with the world. &gt;&gt; I'd rather put up with you than put up with the world. &gt;&gt; I don't want the world. &gt;&gt; But I know this. There's a blood. &gt;&gt; And as long as there's a blood, God is not only covering me, he's covering Brother Amos. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if God doesn't see my mistakes, he doesn't see Brother Amos' mistakes. So let me walk under the blood. Let me fellowship under the blood. Amen. &gt;&gt; Keeps us separated from the world. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, we go back. The presence of God. You realize the presence of God comes to a home that's clean and sanctified. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandon tells us why it's important to have our homes clean. &gt;&gt; Our home should be separated. Right. &gt;&gt; See, this is what the message does. It this doesn't deals with us here at church. It deals with us as individuals. It deals with us as fathers, as mothers, as children. &gt;&gt; It deals with us in our homes. How we treat one another, even in our family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what we have in the secret things. Our homes are the most secret things. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But God knows them. &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. So the presence of God comes into a home that's clean and sanctified. Brother Bram talked of Elizabeth in the New Testament. For years, and I want you to notice that for years, she couldn't have a child. I think I I read where brother Brown said at one place that Zacharias, Elizabeth's husband, was 70 and he might have said she was either 69 or something like that. But but years, I mean, think of this now. For years, she couldn't have a a child. But her her and her husband Zachcharias, the prophet said, were righteous, holy people, keeping the commandments of God, walking in all the statutes and ordinances of God, blameless. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's not saying that they were sinless and didn't have faults. Surely, you understand. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Another place he says, Elizabeth was barren. She hadn't had any children. She was past the age of barren. But now she had lived righteous and holy and clean before God all them years. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Zachcharias all them years he was a priest before God officiating in the in the temple. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And and all them years now she's come to pass bearing a children of the age of barren. But he lived. Zachcharias lived right before God and believed on God and all of his great dark long hours and I would say years of worry finally the angel come &gt;&gt; and said God has answered your prayer &gt;&gt; he stayed in his position &gt;&gt; he did &gt;&gt; he would not compromise &gt;&gt; even though it seemed My God would never hear their prayer. But he stayed true to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And finally, the angel came and said, "God has heard your prayer." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, if you want God to hear your prayers and send an angel to your home, live right, &gt;&gt; do right. &gt;&gt; Treat everybody right. Be right before God, and God will grant that to you." &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, stay separated. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; So the angel of the Lord comes to homes where the occupants of that home are living true parents, husband, wife. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, I've made mistakes, so it just can't be." No. No. You get it under the blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? It's one thing I loved about, you know, u I I so appreciate about my parents is they made the home such a different home. I'd been into homes of my friends and I'd been out and, you know, with with worldly uh associates and and these things when I got older and things, but when I always come home, I knew that God was there. &gt;&gt; And it would always convict my heart. I said, ' God, I don't want that atmosphere out there. I I I I want this atmosphere that I'm feeling. Yes, dad had mistakes. Yes, mom made mistakes. Yes, they had their squables. &gt;&gt; But they were always quick to make things right and repent of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you look at it, Sarah and Abraham, the prophet said they lived upright before the Lord and kept all the statutes and all the commandments of the Lord. They lived in perfect obedience to the word in the light that they had. Think of that one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the angel of the Lord visited them. &gt;&gt; He said, "If you want the angel of the Lord to come to your home, be like them." Amen. &gt;&gt; If you want angels to appear to you, keep your mind on God and off the things of the world. Do you understand that? &gt;&gt; I I'm going to close. I promise you. But no wonder we battle with things. &gt;&gt; No wonder because Satan is trying to get us off track. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He'll try to get us to thinking about something that happened years ago. &gt;&gt; Or yesterday. He'll even try to get us to think about something that never happened yet. True. &gt;&gt; But we dwelling on these things and before you know it, we end up in depression. Our hearts begin heavy and and then we just start moping or we just start going through things and we just start entertaining things. And here's what a prophet is telling us. If you want angels to appear to you, keep your mind on God. Don't keep your mind on your troubles. &gt;&gt; Hello. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't keep your mind on the circumstances or what's going around you and the impossibilities and all the troubles. &gt;&gt; Keep your mind on God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Keep it off the things of the world. Go about your business. Go to your church. Go to your washing of dishes. Whatever wherever you are, keep your mind on him all day and all night. Then God will do something. You're drawing close to him. You got the world shut out and it's just you and he together. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is why I think we as husbands, we should fear. Everybody say fear. &gt;&gt; Now that's a really a different word for guys. Fear. I'm not Joe. But this is a different fear. But we should fear our wife, our children enough to make sure our home is clean &gt;&gt; before the Lord. Sisters, you should fear your husband and your children. You see, we are responsible for spreading the light to the world, to our children, to our spouse. Right? Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember the Bible says of this age men shall be lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God &gt;&gt; and lovers of their own selves. &gt;&gt; Right? So with this in mind and as we see this increasing lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God, lovers of their own self and yet the prophet says there's a lack of love and there will only be love found in the in the bride in the elect. So that means this type of love doesn't make us love ourselves. It doesn't make us want to love the pleasures of the world, but it makes us love God and love one another today. People don't want to be accountable to anyone. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Have you noticed that that no one wants to be committed to anything or anyone because they don't want the obligation or responsibility? &gt;&gt; That's right. It's more easier just to live loose or to live by yourself or live in in a bubble to where you don't have no contact with other people because you don't want to deal with other people. &gt;&gt; And you want to be free to live your life, live how you want it, live the way you want it and all that without no one telling you how to do it, when to do it, where to do it. We don't want none of that. So people get married but but they don't want they don't want to that responsibility and obligation that comes with marriage. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Then they have a family without accepting the responsibility that comes with having children. You you brothers that have have businesses. You know people want they'll come to you and want a job but they don't want to be committed. They don't want to be committed to authority. They don't want to be committed to hours. &gt;&gt; They don't want to be committed to work. &gt;&gt; But they want a job. &gt;&gt; Somehow the job is separate in their mind. The job is separate from all this other stuff. &gt;&gt; Yes. Then then they come to church and and and then they don't want to be held accountable to anything. They just want to come to church. Leave me alone. Just, you know, and and I I want to just be what I want to be when I want to be, how I want to be. &gt;&gt; But it just doesn't work that way. &gt;&gt; If you're going to get married, you're accountable to that. You you there's a responsibility that comes with that. if if if you're going to have children there, you know, when when I I learned that, you know, uh my first child was on the way, I I just was so scared to death. At first, I was scared to get married. I wanted to get married, but I scared to get married. Uh and then then, you know, when I I thought, "Oh man, how am I going to handle this now?" Because I realized there was a responsibility. Man, I've told you before even when you know my wife passed away, I I had five children. Seth, I think I'm been 11 years old and on down to Judah being four months. And I I remember I my world was torn apart. I I didn't know what to do. Didn't I was numb. And I just remember giving all my you know dropping the children off to my mother-in-law. She was saved at that time. And mom and dad was in in Arizona. So, I just dropped them off and I just took off. I didn't know what I was going to do, but I wanted to run. I wanted to get away. I I I just wanted to get away from it all. And then my mother I woke up the next day and my I noticed that I had gotten a bunch of calls from my mother-in-law and missed them and but I called her and she says, "You know, Sean, your children want you so bad they're crying." And I thought, "Oh, God." I got so caught up in my own self that I forgot my responsibilities to my children. &gt;&gt; Buddy, I swear to God I'd never do that again. &gt;&gt; I went back and picked them little ones up and they've been dear to me. &gt;&gt; But I realized that I had responsibilities. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything that we go through, anything that we do through life, we've got responsibilities that we've got to meet. Do you understand? &gt;&gt; People want to be Christians without any kind of commitment to God in his word. &gt;&gt; That's right, &gt;&gt; church. That's the way of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's because they lack divine love. Can you say amen? They want to profess Christ and yet want to conform to and take on the habits of the world. But brother Bram said, "A person who lives their life for their own selves lives a selfish life." We must live for others. &gt;&gt; Why? Someone's watching you. &gt;&gt; Someone's watching me. Someone's watching you. We can have our attitudes. We can we can we can we can justify things. Well, I I just need I need, you know, I'm under pressure, so it it doesn't hurt to do this. just let me get rid of my pressure. But if it's against God's word, someone's watching. &gt;&gt; It affects. You say, "Well, no one's around." But see, God's watching. &gt;&gt; And if he can't approve of my life, as long as there's something that I'm doing that is not right with God, he can't bless my life. &gt;&gt; And if my life can't be blessed by God, I can't be a blessing to somebody else. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; Amen. If the musicians will come, Ecclesiastes 12:13, it says, "Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter. Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man." &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Now, we know that fear in this sense does not mean that you're afraid and you're hiding. That's not it. We're not to fear God in that way. But brother Bram says it means that you're giving him respect and reverence. To fear God, you respect him. You reverence him. &gt;&gt; Our worship should be filled with fear of God. Our our duties that we do should be be motivated by the fear of God. And brother Bram said, you cannot have respect until you have fear. So when you respect God, you fear God. Notice what he says. You fear that you might displease him in some way. You fear lest you would do something wrong. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Then he goes on to say, I fear my mother. I fear my wife. I fear my church. I fear all God's servants unless I should put a stumbling block somewhere in their way. I fear the people. I fear the people of this city unless I should do something wrong that cause them to think I wasn't a Christian. Can you say amen? He says God demands respect for himself and for his servants. God demands respects for his servants. His servants. How we know that they're his servants is because he vindicates these servants by his word. He takes these servants and makes them servants of God and proves that they are servants by making his word work through them servants. Then as you respect that servant, you respect God. So when I respect you and you respect me and we respect each other, then we're respecting God. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Another place we must live for others. Bear ye one another's burdens. So fulfill the law of Christ. And we've got to have a feeling for one another. See, so walking this way of holiness should not make us exalted, make us better than somebody else and feeling like, "Yeah, I'm something. I don't know what down there is, you know." No, we ought to bear one another burden. We ought to have the feeling for one another. And therefore, when you do all you know how to do, then when you lay down at night, you you have the consolation knowing that you tried your best. He says, "I can't make everyone believe. That's impossible." Jesus couldn't do that when he was on the earth. And I know there will be just a few that believes. But if anything I can add to help to the gospel, help the gospel. That's my duty of being here is to try to help somebody along the way. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Oh, do you love him? [Music] &gt;&gt; God wants to use us. He separates us from the world that those that are looking at us can say, "There's God. There's something different about that individual." [Music] Oh God, at least you know you make God real to that individual. &gt;&gt; Whether they believe or not, that's not my business. But at least when I leave and I have left footprints on this earth, I'll know that if anyone follows after me, it'll lead them straight to Calvary. It'll lead them straight to God. It'll lead them to this rapture. Can you say amen? For as Paul says, you know, he separated me from my mother's womb. Then later on he says, "Follow me as I follow Christ." Follow me as I follow Christ. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; May [Music] as we live separate lives and follow after Christ. You love him. Amen. Amen. Amen. [Music] I am. [Music] Oh, if anybody asks you just who I am, oh, just tell them I am redeemed. Sing it again. Oh, I am redeemed. I've been bought with a price. Jesus has changed my whole life. And if anybody asks you just who I am, oh, just tell them I am. Well, aren't you glad you're redeemed this morning? Oh, I am redeemed. I've been bought with a price. Jesus has changed my whole life. And if anybody ask you, [Music] bless the name of the Lord. Oh, tell them I am redeemed. Oh yes, I am redeemed. I've been bought with a price. Jesus has changed my whole life. And if anybody asks you just who I am, tell them I have redeemed. Sing the last lines. Oh, if anybody asks you just who I am, tell them I am redeemed. There's that song if uh going up yonder. [Music] Um, if you want to know where I'm going where I'm going someday soon, if you want to know [Music] where I'm going, where I'm going oh soon. Oh, I'm going up yonder. Going up yonder. Going up yonder to be with my Lord. Oh, I'm going up yonder. [Music] Going up yonder. Oh, going up yonder to be with my Lord. Now I can take the pain and the heartaches they bring. For there's a comfort in knowing I'll soon be gone. Glory. And as God gives me grace, I'm going to run this race. How am I going to run it until I see my Savior face to face? Oh yes, I'm going up beyond. I'm going up yonder. Oh, I'm going up yonder to be with my Lord. Yeah. Yes. I'm going up yonder. I'm going up yonder. I'm going up yonder to be with my Lord. Now if anybody ask you where I'm going, where I'm going. There's a lot of questions going around today. Want to know where we're going? What's our future? Well, if they ask you, oh, where I'm going, where I'm going, it ain't to the world council of churches. I'm going in a rapture. Oh, I'm going in a rapture. [Music] Oh, I'm going in a rapture. I'm going in the rapture to be with my Lord. Tell him for me I'm going in the rapture. Oh, I'm going in the rapture. I'm going in the rapture. Oh, just tell the devil this morning you're going. Oh, I'm going in the rapture. I'm going in the rapture. Oh, I'm going in the rapture. [Music] Shake off those bands of heaviness and just worship him. I'm going in the rapture. Oh, I'm going in the rapture. What a great thing to know it. What a great thing to be able to confess it. Hallelu. Well, now I can take the pain and all the heartache that it brings. But there's a comfort in knowing we're soon going to be gone. As God gives the grace, I'm going to run. Keep running the race until I see my savior face. Run with patience, church. Oh, I'm going in the right church. The world's falling apart. Rush is rising to the sea. But oh, I'm going in a rapture. Yes, I'm going in a rapture. I've heard the voice of resurrection. Halleluah. [Music] Can we sing it one more time? Oh yes, I am going in the rapture. [Music] Oh, going in the rapture. [Music] Going in the rapture to be with my Lord. Oh, I'm going in the rapture. Going in the rapture. Oh, going in the rapture to be with my Lord. Hallelujah. [Music] Bless the name of the Lord. Amen. Do you believe that, church? &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, we may have our struggles and may get burdened and weary and whatever else. May have to cry a tear or two or whatever, but one thing about it, we're going. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We got that token. We've been separated &gt;&gt; for this purpose. Amen. God bless you is our prayer. We love you. And um after the service, if you'd like to want to u observe or watch the uh witness the uh baptism, we'd love to have you. Amen. Um but let's just bow our heads now in a word of prayer. Lord Jesus, Father, we thank you Lord that there is
