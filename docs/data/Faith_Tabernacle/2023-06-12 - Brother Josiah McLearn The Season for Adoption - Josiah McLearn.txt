praise the Lord I sing this song about every 15 years I hope it's the last time I ever get to see it I don't want to be here 15 more years I've been when I first came into the message about 43 years ago whatever when listened to the Future home and the opening of the word and so this is an old song I didn't write the song I just wrote message verses to this song so it's when I wrote I only wrote two songs this is when I'm about 40 years ago kind of a fast song but uh I don't go in for the fast song but I like the words to it so listen as we've seen oh yes the Holy Ghost will set your feet a dancing the Holy Ghost will thrill you through and through I said the Holy Ghost will set your feet a dancing he'll set your heart at dancing too now the Lord has come in spirit form to open up the word he took the book he loose the seals the Thunders we have heard the stimulation by the word to know that I am sealed it makes me shout and move about the joy that I now feel well the prophet preached the Paradox and standing in the Gap he told us then sirs what's the time the sword did loose the cap the written word Beneath The Rock he told us what it said a little squeeze to try our faith but Glory lays ahead oh the Holy Ghost will set your feet a dancing the Holy Ghost will throw you through and through I said the Holy Ghost will set your feet a dancing he'll set your heart at dancing too now the joy we know the end is here the Thunders they did say the Rapture called the Lord's descent the shout that day was made that body waiting over there I heard it calling me the prophet said this day we heard from our theophany oh the Holy Ghost will set your feet a dancing the Holy Ghost will thrill you through and through I said the Holy Ghost will set your feet a dancing he'll set your heart at now listen to the last verse well we're going to a place prepared he said in future home let not your hearts be troubled now for Nevermore to Rome the joy Bells Are Ringing loud we're singing round the throne the king and queen has closed the book now in our future home all the holiday ghost will set your feet are dancing the Holy Ghost will throw you through and through I said the Holy Ghost will set your feet are dancing he'll set your heart a dancing to [Music] I'm just gonna vote that he ought to make a CD with that song on there hey praise the Lord amen I I certainly enjoy that song and I like the verses that he wrote that's really wonderful amen praise God I anybody know where that song really originated from who first came out with that huh just a little bit of trivia here yeah well I know that back in the early 70s the Philip uh or Simon Cameron family from Scotland actually was going around singing that and I don't know if any that goes back probably too far for mostly here but I remember them going around they were all over the United States singing and that was one of their songs praise the Lord amen he was associated with the Simon Cameron family Roy Turner that's right all right praise the Lord uh Sister Kim I know you uh have had a busy schedule but you would you happen to have a song for us tonight amen praise the Lord first time I heard that song brother Terry I was about 20 years old and brother Stephen Shelley sung it at a camp meeting but he wasn't those words I like those words really those are awesome forgive me my mind went blank here I got it I got it my Physicians tried in vain through 12 long years of pain it is proof that there is nothing they can do but I heard somebody say there's a Healer all the way somehow I've got to press my way through I gotta get Jesus gotta get to Jesus oh he's the only answer to money [Music] he can something in the broken pieces gotta get to Jesus now when my world is [Music] I don't know just how much I can take [Music] trapped inside a cloud of disbelief and doubt I only know one way of Escape I gotta get back to Jesus gotta get to Jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] God again to Jesus again Jesus gotta get to Jesus all these broken pieces to Jesus [Music] gotta get to Jesus amen I enjoyed that song amen you know I think it's one of the saddest things I know of is when you hear of somebody that felt like they ran out of Hope or they didn't have stand a chance for something and it didn't turn to the Lord and Lord could he's a problem solver he's a Waymaker he's uh he can certainly take an impossible circumstance that looks like I mean it's there's so many uh things confusion in it and he could bring peace he can bring Clarity uh to a complicated situation there's no problem that God can't solve I I was one of them so I don't know about you but I certainly was one of them and God solved me amen aren't you glad for that tonight let's just stand as we sing a little song here brother Josiah comes to speak to us tonight This Little Light of Mine I'm going to let it shine you all know that song I'm sure from way back in Sunday school days This Little Light of Mine I ain't gonna let Satan blow it up Satan not only tries to blow it up but he's always got a lot of wet blankets and in naysayers uh I tell you we don't want to be

a snake that we have something to shine even musicians can be dismissed uh like say uh good to see you all you all this evening and y'all can hopefully keep me in prayer and um hey man do you love the Lord amen amen let's turn to the scriptures to to love love love Leviticus chapter 25 verse 8. amen just a real simple thought but it's been on my heart and I was going a different direction and then last night I felt to change it so if I'm a little scattered y'all gotta have to help me out because it's kind of um it's uh I don't feel like I'm completely prepared for it so y'all just uh have to keep me in prayer but uh and and Leviticus chapter 25 verse 8 it says and thou shalt number is and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee and seven times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto the 40 and 90 years then then Thou shalt cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month and in the day uh in the end in the day

itself in it nor nor gather The Grapes of it in of it of thy Vine of thy Vine undressed for it is for it is the Jubilee and it shall be holy holy unto you and ye shall eat the increase thereof out out of the land let's all about our heads our dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord how we love you and Lord Lord how thankful we are father to come into your presence once again Lord we ask you father just to come down now Lord and just move in such a mighty special way Lord and help me to lay myself aside father just speak through me and Lord we ask you father God just uh just to just to just uh just to just help me to call my nerves Lord Jesus and and and and and and and and and help help what's In My Heart Lord to be commit to become made made plain Lord we pray we love him thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen I mean y'all can be seated um so I um what is all my heart tonight is is the season the seasons that is the season for adoption to everything to everything to everything to everything there's a season in a time and every purpose under the Heaven There is a time to be born a time to die a time to plant a time to pluck up that that that that that which is it is it is is planted A Time to Kill a time to heal time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and time to laugh and time to mourn and time to dance uh time to cast the waist ons and and the time to gather Stones together a Time eight a time a time to to embrace and a time and a time to to in a time a time to refrain from embracing a time to get a time to lose a time to keep and a time to Cast Away it's a Time Durant and a time to sow and a time to keep silent and a time in time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of peace so so so so so we notice now that um that God has seasons and he has times for everything for for everything that there is when it comes to to anything and everything God has his perfect time in perfect seasons for for for uh for when he wants things to happen you you uh if you notice now that Moses's message message wouldn't have worked wouldn't have worked for Noah's age and Noah's message wouldn't have worked for for for for Moses's Age and and neither and either would would have any other prophets prophets walked through most of the time and Moses's message message wouldn't have have worked for um for um for for any of the of of of the other of the other prophet's time it came it came in the season and the time that that that that God that God that God had intended Moses Moses Moses Moses couldn't have jumped jumped couldn't have couldn't have couldn't have built built an ark and and floated down the Nile and and say and say and say climb on in it's it's how we're leaving here it it it it it wouldn't have worked God had his time in his season for for exactly for exactly what what he planned said and with the age that that that we that that in the age that we're living in when that word when that word is interpreted God's speaking God speaking that that word out and making the Wardrobe the words for that age live giving the interpretation of it that is God in Christ manifesting see because Christ is the word and when the word is made manifest that is Christ in every age then so so so so now so now if if we if we step back and and look at at Moses at Moses for just a little bit we we know that that Moses that Moses intellectually he he knew that that that he was supposed to that he was supposed to to to to to deliver the the the the the children of Israel he he knew his mind that that's exactly what God had called him to do but but but but but but but but but we know now that that just because you have a call of God it it it it it it doesn't it doesn't necessarily mean that mean that you're supposed to just just just jump out there and do it you have to wait on God's timing and in God's Will and and and and and and and and and and Moses and Moses and Moses probably thought that that well that that that that well the children of Israel of Israel no no no that I'm supposed to be there to deliver and and and and and he jumps out there and he kills a man and and and and and and we find out that the children of Israel they did not that that that they did not understanding what it ended up doing was driving Moses Moses that drove Moses out out of the land of Egypt and he's so drunk and his sojourned in in the desert for 40 years why and but and and and and and and and brother Brown had actually said said that Moses had lost all hopes and Andy and he had and he lost he had lost all and he had he he had all lost all his hopes and all the power that he had had had because he was thinking that freedom was not for the children of Israel he had lost all thoughts of Freedom until God had met him one day in a burning bush and and and and and and and then we know that that that that that and God that when God sees and can't came along just exactly right right right right right right and then at that point he began he began to reveal his plans on the Moses he he began to show him signs and wonders that that that that that that that Moses that Moses was to do and before you know it and and before you know it know what that in that five minutes it with that burning bush had had done more for him than all the 40 years of schooling and with with the Egyptians why because because he he became from a head knowledge to a direct revelation of what of what he was supposed to do in in his time in his season and and he realized then that then then that God had called him for that and he realized that it was this it was the season for it now now now now now now now now here he comes he he'd become out he did the end there he went well went marched back across the desert as an 80 as in as an as an 80 as an 80 year old man man man with the stick in his hand because because because because he had realized he had caught the Revelation that it was now God's time in in God's season to do to to to do it so we know that we know that God has a time for all things he's got a he has a time that that will be plant corn he has a time that we plow it and he has the time that we I'll be harvested the uh um spring rains come and and then the droughts come and then and then the droughts come in the summertime and then the fall rains and then the Snows and and and and and we assume we noticed that that with with these times and Seasons we have we have we have this we have a planting season we have a we have a harvest season we have we we we we we have all these times and seasons for it and if you go against the seasons that God had God has placed there it'll never work the the the the Apaches used to um you used to go and plant corn and they had they had what they called to call it a harvest drain or I'm sorry a planting rain and they would never they would never ever Harvest our or I'm sorry plant corn on or or or the crops or whatever it was until until the until what they had what's called a planting land and it was usually it was usually about the start of the start of the monsoon season and and and and and and so we noticed now that that that that that that that all that that that that that every farmer or anybody knows anything in those anything about that kind of stuff knows that you can't just just go and plant it and plant it and plan it yesterday and and tomorrow and tomorrow go go in and and and pick it you have to wait for God's time and and the season brother Brown said he said that God has times for the seasons he has seasons for his word he has times when he'll win where in the scriptures where it said the presence of the Lord was there to heal the sick he said and that's when Jesus was was was was ministering too and and at the presence of the Lord was there to heal the sick he said and maybe and maybe at at at other times the presence of the Lord wasn't there to heal the sick and we find out that God works everything seasonally and and now when Moses when he he both of them said when Moses what he failed to do was find was find the timeline of God and so so so so so so so we find out that when God revealed him that when God revealed him him him him in the burning bush we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we can find out now that that the very thing that he was lacking he found he that he found out what he was lacking was it was in that burning bush what we need today as as as as as as as as Christians when when when we know what God has called us to do when we know that that we are the bride of Christ when when when we know when when when when when when when we know that God has called us to overcome all all the enemies what we need what we what we need to do now is go and have a burning bush experience what we need to do is in the backside you could go on the backside of that desert and we stay there until we know that we know that we know that God has called us to these things and there's nothing any more that could ever stress from it why because we have got a direct revelation of the will of God in our lives it's not enough it's it it's it's it's not enough just to hear the tapes and and hear the promises of God it's not enough just to just to sit there and not head at it and say well yes well yes I absolutely believe that but what we have to do is we have to we is we have to go out on that back side this side of the desert and we have to have that have we have to have that that that that burning bush of bush experience where we know that we know that we know that God has has has has has has has well God has called us through it we have to have a revelation of what God has called us to have what God has called us for um um so so so so so so so we find out now now that now now that that that that once Moses what Moses that that Moses when he when he finally when he finally got the got the direct will of God and the direct time of God and it became a revelation to it to him to him to him now now we see him as an 80 year old man with his wife and his kids and was marching him and he went marching marching uh back back across that desert as a one-man Invasion why because because the time the time had come for for deliverance it was now the season and the time for it so we and so Moses Moses Moses Moses no longer no longer no longer had a head knowledge he he he no longer had a had a had a hope so or just an intellectual knowledge of it it became our direct Revelation that that right now it was time it was time for the for for the Deliverance of of of of Israel and well and he only got that when he came in contact with the pillar of fire so so so so so so so so so so so so so so God so so God so God has has a set time it's a season it's a season for it to happen so what but but notice now that God hasn't set time for everything we we go that we see that God had has to set time for for for for for Christ for Christ to come on the earth and when he came it wasn't a day early it wasn't a daylight it was right on time according to God's Will and God's plan it could not have come a day later it couldn't have come earlier it couldn't have come a month later or a month or a month earlier and maybe the doctors were telling Mary that your due date is on such and such a day but really it came it came on this day why because because because as good as those doctors were that they might that they might have that that they might have tried try to tried to guess the due date just exactly right um God had his exact timing for when Christ was was to come on on on on Earth brother Brown said said um said uh um um um like like the heat of the sun uh like like like the like the heat of the sun to open up when it's so when it when it when it's when it's when it's tender and young to to to to to to bring it to to bring it out of the ground the seed then then it gives its leaves and then another stage of the sun um um the hot sun it will kill it if it's the ripening seed or ripening time he said so he regulates the Sun and regulates nature to meet his word he regulates the church the um the uh the predestinated the the the the the the bride to meet the season that they are that they are are are are living in and he said even need to Nature itself even nature itself tells us tells us tells us today as we see the Nations breaking and the Earth sinking and the handwriting is on the wall we see the church and the state and the state in the state it's in now we see the bride in the state in the state and he's we see the church and the state and this and the state it's in he said we see the bride in the state she's in and we know and we know by Nature that the church is getting ready is getting ready is getting ready ready to leave he he's one of the Glorious time it's a time that all the prophets have long to see he said this hour he said now now he's now he revealed his word only in its season and Martin Luther read the same Bible Bible Bible we did he he he he he he said that that Wesley Wesley read the same Bible that Martin Luther did in the Pentecostals read the same Bible that that that that that we'd read now he said but Jesus he's in Jesus read the same Bible read the same Bible that the verse he's read but he he he he said he said he he said he he he he said he he he he he he he he said but they were trying to keep the corn in an early stage when it was ripening he he said see they failed they failed to to to see their hour now and God reveals this word in the season and and and to whom and to whom he he chooses he chooses he chooses to to he to whom he chooses to reveal it to God chooses who he reveals it to and he chose that before the foundation of the world all of this doings were foreknown by him and hidden and hidden and hidden from man he just reveals them as he will it is his chosen season his chosen purpose and he never did choose a part of your sect it is a chosen person and he does it and Zechariah 14 verse 7 it says and and but it shall be one day that which which which and one day which shall be known which which shall be known what shall be known to the Lord and not not day nor night but it shall come to pass that in the evening time it shall be a light and in Revelation chapter 10 verse 1 verse verses verses verses one through seven it says and I saw another Mighty Angel come down come down come down down from out of from come down from heaven clothed with the cloud and a rainbow and the rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his little hand a little book open and he said his he said his right his his right foot upon the sea and his left and his left and his left foot of foot on the earth and and and he cried and and he cried with a loud voice as when the lion world and when he cried the seven Thunders uh other other their their their their their their voices and when the seven Thunders had had had and when the seventh Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things what's this what's the seven what's the seven Thunders uttered and white them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand lifted up his hand and it lifted up lifted up his he he lifted up his hand to him and and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who who who who who who who created heaven and the things and the things that that that that that they're in our hand and the earth and the things in the and the things that they're in our and the Sea and things that that that that that are there in that there should be time no no no no no no no no longer but then he says this in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants to his servants the prophets and so so so so so so we notice now now now now with that John when he heard those those seven Thunders he was about to write them and the angel told him seal them up and and and and and and and and and and and and and but in the days but it says in the days of the voice he would reveal those things which he which which had which which had been hid since since since the foundation of the world the the the and now and and now and now and now and now today we as the bride of Christ we can stand here and and say that the seven Thunders have to have been opened onto US those things that have been sealed in that book have now been opened up to us because because we now we have a full understanding and a full revelation of just exactly what those seven Thunders are because it because it is now in the correct time and season for these things these these who are the world see are the elect of God they are they are the um predestinated foreknown of God and we're in the mind of God and his thoughts and very plain and very plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth and then in the designated decreed in the designated decreed season and and and and and and and and as as each as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body thus the bride thus the bride this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride and though she is feminine and and and and and and and and designation she's also called the body of Christ and it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same source and and was eternal with him and is now manifesting God in a many-membered body whereas once God was manifested in one member even our Lord Jesus Christ now now that we are coming to a conclusion as the Eternal logos which was God was manifested it was manifested it was manifested in the son and in Jesus throughout all the fullness of the godhead by head and all the fullness of the godhead all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that internal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby thereby gained the title of son so even so we Eternal in his thoughts are in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed manifested in flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manifested in flesh are all the sons of God even as we are so-called we do not be become seed by by The Rebirth of birth we received and therefore were reborn for only the re-elect can be reborn because we receive is the reason we could be quickened and non-seed there is absolutely nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing to go to to Quicken and um so so what we're seeing now that that that that asses Body of Christ as she's maturing in her season she's Rising forth and she's becoming and she's becoming literally Jesus Christ in flesh again in these last days brother might have said it said now this one here is is a little bit of a reading so you guys will have to help me help me out or you have to have you you you you'll you you'll you'll you'll you'll have to you'll have to bear bear with the movie with me but it's a bit of it's a bit of a of a foundation here brother Brown said he he was talking about uh uh uh about um um um um Abraham here he he he's now that's exactly what God did what God did about the Royal by the royal royal seat of Abraham he said now I know Isaac was the Seed of Abraham potentially it was the natural seed his CC seed but not the real seed he said that real seed that real seed his his seed was Christ The Royal seed Isaac only was a substitutionary until Christ came which was the Seed of Abraham he he he he said he he he he he he he he said he he says he says then the real Seed of Abraham believes the promise just like just like what just like just like Abraham did because it because it's it's because it's to Abraham and his seat after him now watch what God did what God did what god did did um did to the Royals royal seed seed is the seeds need to make the Covenant confirmed he took Christ which was the seat of Abraham on Calvary he tore him apart and he took his spirit off him and he put his body in the grave in his soul in hell and raised him up on the third date and raised up his body and brought it up into glory and there's and there sent the spirit back down and kept the body on his right hand side and sent the spirit back down to live in the church to make to make to make a church just so much with the Life of Christ that in the end of that in the Resurrection the two will come will that the two will will the two will come together bride and bridegroom in the church in Christ will be exactly alike with the same kind of ministry the same kind of power the same kind of spirit and that he raised up the he raised up the body of Jesus Christ and sat on his right side his right hand and poured down the spirit the the the spirit upon the church on the day of Pentecost cause that's how God proved his Covenant with his church so so we noticed now now now now that that that that that that um that that there was a that there was that God performed a super sign and and we know we we know that that that that that that that that brother Brown had called the super sign the Discerning of the spirits of the heart and um um and and and and and and we all know that's that that that that God that God that God had that that that God that God adopted Jesus on the on the mount on the mount Transfiguration and and and and and he overshadowed them and he took him up and he took him up and he took him up up up to two two two a public place when he had it and he had and he had Peter James and John and John with them his three Witnesses and he overshadowed them and and his Raymond began to begin to shine like the sun sun the sun and and he said and the voice and a voice came out came out came out from Heaven saying saying this is my beloved Son hear ye [Music] I've placed him positionally that's my son what he says I'll back up he keeps my word he spot through all of these denominations and everything else and has kept the faith he's pulled no punches he's been true he's always he's always about my work and when people look at him they see me this is my son hear ye him and and and and further on down brother Branham says this is it says it says it says says says that God took Abraham out and placed the adoption upon him and changed his name and he says Glory from Abram to Abraham and Abraham comes from the word Elohim God's Own Name he Associated his name with God's name God um God God is Elohim how many how many knows that the great Jehovah the great Jehovah um um um Elohim Elohim the the the the all-sufficient one one the self-existing one Elohim and what did he do he took the Hem off his name and placed it into Abraham's name because he he was Abraham God is the is the father of all and Abraham is the father of Nations Glory Elohim Elohim father of all Abraham father of Nations placed him positionally glory now he said that's after his church that's after his church received the Holy Ghost after after they after they had went through the testing see Pentecostal missed that they organized they they they they organized they organized themselves and couldn't get any further and then when God does a certain thing say uh-huh stay away from it see our church don't teach that he said he said he said go ahead now he said but here's what he done to Abraham to Abraham and he seen afterwards and and and and so we notice now and in the scriptures that just a couple days a couple days or that that when God had placed Abraham he just changed his name from Abram to Abraham to to Abraham a couple days Days days later he shows up he he he he he he he shows up and and he said and and he said and he said he he said he said hey he he he said he said he said he said Abraham he said he said I'm going to give you a sign and and he he said he he he said you will have a son and Sarah laughed at him and and but now but now if I can find the spot he said he said he he he he he he said he said before he received his super son or his son that was to be born a super son of course before he before be before he received him he he he he's not the Royal one now but before he received him he received the super sign he said what was it God came down to him in the form of a man he's a notice he's he he he he he he he's noticed that man that talked to them that that that's that's that stood that's that that stood in the tent where he was and he performed a super sign and when his super son come on the scene his super son performed the same sign the sign his sign to show that he was Abraham's supersede glory and he promised the same thing in these last days and and he performed a sign and he performed the sign I I signed a signed to Abraham to let him know that he was the supersede he said where Sarah and she said she is in the tent behind you he said I'm going to visit you according to according according according to the time of life and Sarah did something she kind of laughed and he said Why did Why did Why did Why did Why did why did Sarah laugh laugh saying that these things that these things he cannot be and and he perceived the thoughts that was in Sarah's mind in the tent behind him and he knew that that was God so this is so so so so so we noticed now now now that at the time at the time of that super sign is when God came down and he adopted and and he adopted a and he adopted he adopted he adopted Abraham and and at the adoption time God God had sent us into Super slime showing showing what the time and the seasons was to be at the discernment of the thoughts of the thoughts and the in the intents of the heart God placing himself in the man Elohim and this and this and this and this and this today in our day in our day again again again again in these last days this is now the hour hour the hour for adoption God has sent again another Super sign in our days it was the discernment of the thoughts and the intents of the heart and no other age it had ever been except for this age then that there was never a time a time like we were saying again in these last days but but but but but but we are saying it again again again today in these last days it's God back in this church again Elohim in his bride and and it is that Covenant if that Covenant that that that that that he made that he made with Adam without him without him and and the garden in the garden in the in the Garden of Eden it was an unconditional it was on an unconditional Covenant it was no strings attached to it whatsoever and that he would send it and he would see he would he would send the Savior God promised it and he fulfilled that that that that that that that that that that that promise but but in that Covenant that Covenant he made without him was perfectly was perfectly was perfectly was perfectly fulfilled and since that's and and so will the Covenant that God that God had given on on to Abraham um that and that his seed unconditionally will will be fulfilled just as certain as Jesus Christ you guys can't get just as certain as Jesus Christ he can come to the Earth come to the Earth to fulfill what God had said to do it's got to be so what are we worried about this is Brother Madam speaking he said we are the most freest people in the world he said what are you worried about he said we ought to be the happiest happiest people people in the world we are now the sons and the daughters of God we are sitting together now in Heavenly in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus when right now present tense every man woman boy girl or or or child or or child has been born again Born Again of God and received the Holy Ghost is sitting now in Heavenly places when as many as two or three are gathered cry nice promise to be in the midst amen he he said he said now some people some some people some people goes by feeling he said I'm not saying I'm not I'm not I'm not safe because I feel like I'm saved he said the devil can can beat you around the stomper every day on that but I'm not saved because I feel like I'm saved I'm saved because I met God's requirements God called me and I accepted it and by faith I believe it whether I feel good or whether I feel like it or not I am anyhow because God because God said so Jesus never said did you feel it he said Do you believe it he said amen based solemnly upon the finished work of Christ at Calvary every Redemptive blessing belongs now to the believer so so so so so so so we as the bride of Christ we can stand here in all boldness and we we can now say that's the season for adoption is now upon us because God has given the super sign again again again again again to us in these last days God back in his bride again so so so so when when when when now so now so so now we can stand here as as a fully adopted bride of Christ and stand here in all confidence and in all boldness knowing that knowing that whatsoever we have need of God God is obligated to fulfill it from brother Branham said said this and said that when you become a Christian God gives you a checkbook in there with Jesus name sign at the bottom of it for anything you have need of while you're wow oh no well anything you haven't either while you're on you're on life's journey are you afraid to cast it he said amen fill it out and send it and send it to headquarters and see what God what God will do about it amen this is the bride's day we have found favor we have found a favor with God so just as just as mass Mary had had found have found had found had found favorite with God and then and that angel came and said said Thou Art highly favored among um among among women or women this is the hour of favor favor for the Bride of the bride of Christ Gideon when when when when when when when when when when Guinea he was out there he was out there threshing wheat threshing wheat wheat wheat behind the behind the behind the wine press because he was he was scared and the angel of the Lord appeared to him and unto him and said thou Mighty Man of Valor why he he was a he was a scared chicken but by the end of it but by the end of it he began to realize he'll realize that this was now the time in the season for a complete deliverance the Deliverance Deliverance whether for the children of Israel and he and he knew without a shot of doubt that God that God had called him and he and he was able to stand up stand up and stand up with just with us with just 300 men and drive out and drive out and drive out every enemy that that that that that Israelites had maybe because because he caught of what he caught exactly what God had called him to do and he realized it was the time and the season for it and why he he he had stood up and stood in his position in all confidence and in all boldness and he stood there on his word and said if God before me then who can be against me and so so so so so we notice now now now now now now now now that um um that uh brother random said said that he sends us he sends us with his message and he said let's go with the message and go and go with something to tell he said go go tell he said not not run and not run and then not and then and then and then not be able to tell he said first let's get it let's get it in our own heart and he said when you come up when you come up when you come up to be prayed for in the morning he said don't come don't don't don't come don't don't come don't come in in a half past it away he said come with a message in your heart he said I am he I am he that was dead and alive again he's I am the one that gave the message and he said these signs tell follow them that believe if God Almighty could take a little cross-eyed baby and turn his side sight and turn the sight normal DACA and it's starting to sight back normal when normal was just a prayer that God could take a baby a baby boy born never did see in his life and 16 years old restore his eyesight back and restore and restore his eyes like back to him God can take a miserable rest of a cancer-eating person and restore him fully why because because we as the bride of Christ he can stand there upon God's promises and every single promise that that God would ever have we can stand on knowing that this is the hour and the season for a fully adopted bride of Jesus Christ every every knee that we ever have have have have we can never possibly need we just signed that check and take it to the bank knowing that that that that that we can draw on those funds instantly the other day my my I I I cast a check my and my bank said well I'm gonna have to hold the holy sponsor like for like I think they said 10 days and I said well I need that money now they said well we don't know if the if the funds are are are they because it was like a it was like a ten thousand dollar check or something but it was it was four months of materials and I said well I have to order these materials like today and they were like I'm sorry because because because because you're gonna have to wait and I said well why they said because we don't know if the other persons if the other person has that kind of funds in the bank and we're not going to clear that until until we can verify but but we as the bride of Christ we can take that check to the bank and and lay it on the counter and cash it right then and there knowing knowing that we are drawing from the unlimited Bank on the unlimited on the unlimited Bank of heaven and we and whatsoever we have need of if it's financial problems if if it's if you have back pain if you have if you have leg pain if if you have a need of a healing your body if you need a Deliverance tonight you can just sign that check and take it to the bank and and cash it right then there and claim your Liberty why because we are now free made by the blood of Jesus Christ why we are the Bride of Mr Jesus Christ it is now the season and the time and the and the time and the time for the stuff we are a fully manifested bride of Jesus Christ Elohim back in his bride again in these last days the message of Luther it will not it will not it will not it it won't it won't work work work work work work work in these days the the the message of Wesley won't won't will not work will not work will not work work work work work for these days today days if if if if Moses would have come and brought Noah's message message it wouldn't have worked and neither would Jesus and and and and other and either and neither would would Jesus's message ever ever worked ever worked ever worked ever worked worked for uh for for Moses and either will will will will bless his message Luther's messages for Wesley and vice versa but and and and and and and and and and and and and we're looking around now and we see that the glass the last great Reformation was it was was it was was was Pentecost and and today and today we can see that we have moved on on on on to me from that why because the Pentecostal message will not mix will will not mix with what we will with what we have well with what we have what with what we have what we have what we have today and and and and and and it's and and and and it's because God is is forming a building up he's he's laid the foundation and and he's built the walls and he's come on up and he's and he and he's forming the roof now and he's shutting that Capstone right on top of the roof it's like the the the defeat and the arms and all coming together and it and it's not that we that we throw the messages away of Luther and Wesley why Hawaii because they in their season they were exactly what this bride needed we're not on the roof roof roof roof putting a bunch of foundation a bunch of foundation blocks up we're on the roof and we're putting shingles on it it's we're in a totally different stage of Life on this stuff but and and just and just like and just like like like like like the life of a wheat it's combed up and and it started out just just as little as this little sprig that maybe look like grass and it's ComEd up and it was growing up and and we begin to see now what is taking place all the way up through Luther's stage and and and and and Wesley's age and all through Pentecost but now the banana but now that that shuck has pulled back and it's revealing it's revealing the fruit of that of that wheat and it's lying here wide open and it's ready for and it's ready now and it's ready now and then now and then after the Harvest time we're not in Luther's age of the planting season we're not in Wesley's age of the planning season we're now in the harvest season season for the bride of Christ just just just just just just just as a corn of wheat of of we of we of we have we had I had to fall in the fallen in the ground and die took the race back up again just like Jesus I had to die on the cross and raise up again and so did the Church of of of of of of of Pentecost they've had to they've had to die and and and and and it had to go on the ground of them of all them Dark Ages and any grain that that that that that that goes in the ground it has to land that in that dark time to bring forth life but she started sprouting up through Martin Luther and come on up and through Wesley and on the Pentecost and now and now we go out in the Grain and the dinner and this is Brother random and now the denominational systems that they left behind their stocks that's all it's to be burned he said the denomination system but the real grain of wheat that's come out of each of each of each one of those reformations will be caught up in the bride it all all together we'll make the bride brother brother Madam says this is that and in there there would be a Time come forth when he could express himself and fullness of his godhead deity through his church we have the um we have the um um um we have the preeminence is in this church oh my what he said what the anointed man now and his anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed right and and the bridegroom anointed by by by why and he's about why except in what Eve had turned down and Adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit see Spirit of the word and when Eve turned down he comes back and we accept he's now he's now we see that that hybrid condition again does exactly what what he had what what what he had that that had had done to Eve but now we as the bride of Christ we're coming forth and we and now that truck has pulled back and that denominational system is dying off and now the bride of Christ is standing is standing tall and and all in all the glory of of the power of Christ around her and she has all authority and all power and and she can she can look any devil in the eye and say get the hints why because she had as the authority of Christ and we're now standing with all authority and in all power that that was promised us in these last days and so so so so so so so so so um um um um brother he was he he was talking about the cloud over on over on over on on on on Sunset and he was talking about how how how how how how thou that when he was holding a picture and everyone was guessing what it was he said well someone will say well it looks like a lion over here and other people people were saying Eagles and some were saying a bear and and and and and and and and and other people saying this thing but he said you take that picture and you turn it sideways and he said there was Jesus and it was Jesus sitting there and and he said he said there is a white he he he he he said he said so Jesus with a white or white a white a white a white wig on showing that Jesus was judged he said there's a white wig that they used to wear and they put in and they and and they were they they would put a wear on a wig on and where does Judge and England still does it does it and it shows you've got supreme authority and that turning sideways in this picture he said there he is his black hair and you can see it see it oh and see it see it in the in the side of his beard and the white wig on he has the last he has the ease the last of the authority he is supreme authority even God even God says it has has said has said successful himself this is my beloved hear him and now exactly on Sunset mountain and on that Sunset light the evening light has now come and God is vindicating himself what is it see the Supreme deity supreme authority no other voice no other God no other nothing in him dwells the fullness of all the godhead and then all the God and fullness of all the godhead and all the fullness of the godhead bodily the Angels themselves was his wig hey amen and he said and he says he's what happened what happened what happened on on on on on Sunset God confirming his word and that's where all this noise is about he said notice it's for feeling his promised word again of Revelations 10 1 10 1 10 1 10 1-7 and in the days of the sounding of the seventh Angel's message the mystery of God should be finished and the Mystery of the revelations of of 10 1-7 the last message to the last Church age fulfills exactly in this age Luke 17 30 the day when the son of man shall be revealed and and and in another place he says he says now watch now he has appeared to us in the same form that he did that that he did to them in the Old Testament and the same as he did as he did as as he did he as he did in in the New Testament he has shown by the same word the same Christ and I declare and I declare to you that Christ is the Holy Ghost and that the word Christ means means that the word Christ means means means that the word Christ means means word Quest means the anointed one and just as a person that just a person just a person a person that's anointed that is the Christ that is the Christ the anointed one how many knows how many knows knows knows knows that that's true he said the anointed one that there would be a man that would be anointed Anointed with what the Bible says in Acts 2 that Jesus the Nazareth of Nazareth a man approved for God Anointed with the Holy Ghost went about it and done great works and things and see that God manifested prove that he was in this man he said and now we become Anointed with that same Spirit we are anointed Messiahs Messiahs of the last day to shine forth the resurrection of Jesus Christ to show that he is not dead but in the form of the Holy Ghost and he is in his people moving among his bride with the love of pharaoh with the love of pharaoh with a love affair of uh with a love affair to her pouring pouring out into her himself they are becoming one for the wedding supper and the same signs promised by the same God and the same word is making his same man is making his same his same his same is his same [Music] making his same his same manifestations there is nothing left for us to do but believe it and believe it is the substance and that creates a perfect Faith so so now we as the product Christ we can stand here with all the confidence and and all authority and all Assurance we don't have to we don't have to be scared we don't have to sit there and wonder about it we don't have to wander say say well I don't know if I can get the Holy Ghost or I don't know if I can be healed or I don't know if if if this Deliverance really is really is is is who really is really is is is is is for me because we can stand here as the bride of Christ and we can know that Jesus Christ is in the building tonight because we because because he is he is now in us he he has now become Elohim back in his bride again and now and now he's performing Miracles we've seen Miracles left and right and and all throughout all and then my hand and says and and and and and all throughout throughout the years because he's now performing it through his church his people and and the Bible says that they shall lay their hands on their sick and they shall and they shall recover and my name in my name they shall cast out evil spirits and then now this commission is it has been given has been given to the church in these last days and brother Brown said that's what is what the matter that's what the matter with the church today it doesn't know its position and they said if you know positionally who you was and who you were tonight they want to be a feeble person in here in the next five minutes he said that's right the thing of it is you're looking off and into a millennium into a into a millennium for something to happen when it's already here he said right now we are the sons of God not we will be we are right now when this night right now this minute we are seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus oh if you'd only recognize that and the supreme authority that Jesus Christ has given to to you to every to every believer anything you desire that you desire of how you how you have that that you have a need of only thing you have to do is ask and receive it whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe believe you believe that you receive it and it will be given it will begin it will be given it will be given it will be given unto you he said that's true whatsoever things you desire When you

now in our standing in we're not cry has come forth and we've stood on our feet we've trimmed our lamps and we've gone forth now to meet our bride's groom um we're starting to realize just exactly who we are as the bride of Christ we have stepped into what God has called for us since the foundation of the world the world he he he he he he he doesn't he doesn't Christ doesn't see me as the rest of the world sees me he Christ doesn't see me as as some want to be a stuttering preacher up here he sees Perfection through the through the blood of Christ or I can stand here in all assurance and in all confidence knowing that he that what he has called me at what he has he has called me to do he uh he will perform it through me and we can stand and we can stand as the bride of Christ in all confidence knowing that God that Christ does not see us that Christ does not does not does not does not is he is as a as a weak hopeless denominational sinner he he he's never seen us as a drunk or a drunkie or or or something that's a that's a that's addicted that's addicted to that pornography or or something that's addicted to drugs or or whatever it may be your problem maybe he sees us as a spotless virtuous bride of Christ who we we have to now we have but we have to take his mind in order to get together yet to get to get anywhere we can't just be be looking be looking at our bodies saying I'm a failure and if you set them and hit yourself over the head with that every day it's what you're going to become but yeah we can stand here and all confidence and not and not and not look at ourselves through our eyes but look but but look but look through the mirror of God's word and we can stand there and say speak and we can stand there and speak to this mountain and whatsoever we have we have we have we have now we have have have need of of of that of that that same spirit I was in Jesus Christ is is now on us and that now makes us an heir and a joint Heir with with Christ what we need to do is let a vision break out breakouts breakouts break out over our lives and and and serious ourselves not as the world sees us but as Christ as Christ as Christ sees this a Son of God that that has that has broken out of those prison bars and a step forth and with full Authority and full power and where we can look and where we can look we we can look that double right in the eye and say you're powerless before me why what we got to learn to do is quit soft soft soft soft soft foot of footing it around the devil just and just say well well I hope I can I can get I can I can get through the two today with that without with it without without messing up today over this or or or or or or or I hope I could just have another average day today and and just hope to overcome
