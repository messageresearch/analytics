[47:18] food and um and uh praise the Lord and
[47:24] amen but anyways uh before we go on the
[47:27] word let's just uh bow our heads and
[47:31] talk to our Lord precious
[47:35] Lord we're so glad to know who we are in
[47:39] you father and we don't count that
[47:43] lightly as there's so many in the world
[47:46] today that are groping in darkness
[47:50] trying to find their identity and
[47:53] looking to other things Lord to who
[47:57] attach themselves
[47:59] to but father youve sent a prophet our
[48:02] way and yes the lamb opening the book
[48:06] father and revealing who we are and Lord
[48:10] we're so thankful for it father we can
[48:13] go through the things of life
[48:16] everyday life father knowing that we've
[48:19] got a bright future ahead and oh father
[48:23] now I pray that you would just minister
[48:25] to every need that this evening bless
[48:28] your people father as you have laid this
[48:31] on my heart I feel and I pray that you
[48:34] would just anoint me and help me to get
[48:36] myself out of the way and may your
[48:38] people be anointed as well father we ask
[48:42] it now in Jesus Christ's name amen
[48:46] praise the Lord um The Book of Job the
[48:50] 23rd chapter I
[48:52] believe and the 10th verse it says but
[48:56] he knoweth the way that I
[48:59] take when he hath tried me I shall come
[49:03] forth as gold say that again he knoweth
[49:07] the way that I take and when he hath
[49:09] tried me I shall come forth as gold amen
[49:15] you can have your seats this evening and
[49:18] um I want to maybe just speak on the
[49:23] subject of coming forth as pure gold and
[49:27] I trust it will be a help to you but um
[49:31] we know that that gold speaks of
[49:35] deity and um it is symbolizes deity and
[49:39] and so it fits Christ as the prophet
[49:43] said and one of the gifts that uh the
[49:47] the the wise men brought to
[49:51] Jesus uh when they worshiped him was
[49:55] gold and uh um it it
[49:58] identified uh as to who he was uh by by
[50:03] them bringing that they knew uh it
[50:06] showed they knew what kind of a child he
[50:09] was and and as Paul would tell us it was
[50:13] God in Christ amen reconciling the world
[50:17] unto himself but now it is Christ in you
[50:21] the hope of glory ain't that right and
[50:24] so then we know that God is coming for a
[50:28] bride and it's it's his bride and um and
[50:32] so uh uh which uh it's his bride because
[50:37] she is bone of his bone flesh of his
[50:39] flesh life of his life and she is him
[50:43] and so only those who are part of this
[50:47] bride is going to be in the Rapture
[50:49] which we know is at hand uh any day the
[50:52] Rapture could take place and and this
[50:55] bride is going to be a word bride do you
[50:57] believe that now we would have never
[51:00] really understood that or known what
[51:02] kind of a bride that God was after
[51:04] except God would send a prophet to let
[51:06] us know exactly what kind of bride she's
[51:09] going to be and it's going to be a word
[51:12] Bride for he is the word groom now him
[51:16] being the word groom the the prophet
[51:19] said that Jesus so lived by the word or
[51:22] he so believed the word he was full of
[51:25] faith and he lived by the word till he
[51:28] became the word so so that that that
[51:32] that puts something with us because if
[51:34] it was for the groom it's for us that we
[51:37] we full of Faith Amen to to so live by
[51:42] the word till we become the word and and
[51:45] so brother brandom says she's fixing to
[51:47] bring forth the perfect word back there
[51:50] and the word is coming for the word
[51:52] bride and a woman is part of a man taken
[51:55] from him so the church will have to be a
[51:58] word abiding church every word of the
[52:02] Bible not systems dogmas or nothing
[52:05] added it'll have to be an adulterated uh
[52:09] unadulterated pure virgin word ain't
[52:12] that right so then if she's going to be
[52:15] the word bride then she will have to be
[52:17] the perfect match to every promise in
[52:21] this Bible that spoke of her so she is
[52:24] Justified amen she is is Sanctified she
[52:28] is filled with the Holy Ghost and and
[52:30] sealed but she will also be positionally
[52:34] placed within the body of of of Christ
[52:38] reflecting Christ ain't that right just
[52:41] as the moon uh is in her uh in its place
[52:46] positionally placed to reflect the light
[52:49] from the sun amen so is this bride amen
[52:53] being positionally placed to reflect the
[52:56] light of the s o n ain't that right amen
[53:00] so then Christ is the word so so her
[53:03] reflection is the word amen but he is
[53:07] the spirit that quickens the word amen
[53:11] to the individual the prophet said he is
[53:14] the spirit of the word amen so so we
[53:17] don't just take the word as a letter a
[53:20] dead letter for the letter kth ain't
[53:22] that right it's the spirit that gives
[53:25] life and so so so uh when when they say
[53:28] when they you know uh become formal and
[53:31] they become well you you've got two
[53:33] sides you've got the formal side and
[53:35] they're sophisticated and and uh you
[53:38] know they they they come on that side
[53:40] and and uh they're they're educated and
[53:43] then you got the other side that it's
[53:45] all Just Dance and hoop and holler and
[53:47] all of that and and you got both
[53:49] extremes but the bride has actually got
[53:51] both word and spirit amen she's got the
[53:55] word but then she has that spirit that
[53:57] is quickening the word to her ain't that
[54:01] right amen see so it's not knowledge
[54:03] that we're after it's the quickening
[54:06] power to Quicken that word amen within
[54:10] us and then we start becoming a
[54:12] reflection now so so the the prophet
[54:15] said the word itself is spirit it's
[54:18] spirit in word form see and then you see
[54:22] when it is quickened or brought to life
[54:24] the spirit of the word goes to work and
[54:28] acts amen so so we cannot have the Holy
[54:31] Ghost and not have the word amen had
[54:35] that's why brother Brown challenged you
[54:36] say you got the Holy Ghost you'll cut
[54:37] your hair women you you you say you got
[54:40] the Holy Ghost and and wearing your
[54:42] Brites women you you you know you you
[54:44] say you got the Holy Ghost and you're
[54:46] smoking your cigarettes and and you're
[54:48] drinking your beer and you're telling
[54:49] your dirty jokes and you're you
[54:52] understand what I'm saying the spirit
[54:53] quickens the word that's what we need
[54:57] is the spirit so now we know that this
[54:59] is the age of life that's what the
[55:01] prophet said it's the age of life it's
[55:04] the age where that God is requiring the
[55:07] token to be on display amen and the
[55:11] token is none other than the life of God
[55:14] Amen it's the literal life of Jesus
[55:17] Christ in The Believer now now that's
[55:20] where deity comes into the believer
[55:22] ain't that right amen see and so uh uh
[55:27] uh Jesus Christ uh on display in The
[55:30] Believer is the token and and then
[55:33] therefore if it's really Jesus Christ
[55:36] we're not talking uh of just an
[55:38] imagination we're actually talking of
[55:41] the nature of Jesus Christ the the
[55:43] character see the character is what of
[55:46] Jesus Christ is what is on display
[55:49] that's that's that's what this bride is
[55:51] to reflect ain't that right amen see and
[55:55] so the prophet said see God is looking
[55:57] for her character the character of
[56:01] Christ he's not looking for all the Fang
[56:03] dangles that she has she's not looking
[56:06] or he's not looking for all the fine
[56:08] qualities of gifts and and all of that
[56:11] he's looking for one thing and that's
[56:13] character which is his own character see
[56:17] that's the reflection ain't that right
[56:19] because we know that Satan can
[56:21] impersonate any gift that God's God Amen
[56:24] and so any gift can be questionable and
[56:27] and these things but when it comes to
[56:30] the the character of Jesus Christ being
[56:32] reflected amen then you know that's
[56:35] deity within the individual amen see so
[56:40] remember how they built the Great pyamid
[56:42] the prophet had talked about it uh
[56:44] several times but in this pyramid every
[56:47] stone was cut to prision it it was cut
[56:52] just right amen and it was placed
[56:54] exactly right to where uh the prophet
[56:57] even talked about it how that you
[56:59] couldn't even put a razor blade in
[57:01] between them and and it was such perfect
[57:05] uh uh and and of course uh uh the the
[57:08] the uh uh uh uh the the the pyramid was
[57:13] God's second Bible we know that the
[57:15] Stars was God's first Bible then the
[57:17] pyramid and then the written word ain't
[57:20] that right the written word as as the
[57:23] Bible amen that was God's third Bible
[57:26] but now now it's come to the word made
[57:29] flesh it it's come to a living word amen
[57:34] to where the word that that is that's in
[57:37] the stars that that speaks of the word
[57:40] the the pyramid that speaks of the word
[57:42] this that speaks of the word and they're
[57:44] all the word god telling the story now
[57:48] it's becoming made flesh in you and I
[57:51] and this is what Paul would tell us you
[57:53] are written Epistles read and known of
[57:56] all men so the prophet said the great
[57:59] Church of the Living God is Born Again
[58:02] Stones cut out aren't you glad for that
[58:06] we're we're not just stones but we're
[58:09] Stones cut out God has taken you for a
[58:14] purpose to fit you into the pyramid and
[58:17] we know that we're not at the base of
[58:19] the pyramid we're all the way right up
[58:22] in this the Capstone age ain't that
[58:24] right the Capstone which is Christ
[58:27] himself amen yes sir and so we we find
[58:31] and this is why the Paul would say they
[58:33] without us cannot be made perfect amen
[58:36] they were part of the pyramid they were
[58:39] part of the body they were part of the
[58:41] Bride amen but it took us they they
[58:44] waiting for us to make this thing
[58:47] perfect can you say Amen they had dips
[58:49] of the spirit they had dips of it and
[58:52] they manifested and they reflected part
[58:54] of the word amen a little bit here and a
[58:57] little bit there just a little light but
[58:59] in this day the fullness of light has
[59:02] come amen see and so we we find that
[59:06] we're Stones Born Again Stones cut out
[59:09] now now many come to the altar as the
[59:11] prophet would say about Billy Graham and
[59:13] and different ones and and and and
[59:15] making the altar call and and thousands
[59:18] would come up and they would make
[59:19] decisions they would make their decision
[59:22] to follow Christ or whatever and brother
[59:24] Bram said decision is all right
[59:27] decisions are is confession stones but
[59:31] what good does it do to have Stones if
[59:35] you don't have a stonemason to cut them
[59:37] out in the shapes of Sons and Daughters
[59:41] of God can you say Amen aren't you glad
[59:44] that it was more than just a confession
[59:46] that you made but God honored your
[59:49] confession God saw that confession he he
[59:52] saw your heart and he said now that's
[59:54] mine that's that was from from the book
[59:56] that I had wrote before the foundation
[59:58] of the world and he called you and he
[1:00:01] began to shape you as a stone and to cut
[1:00:05] you ain't that right amen see so now so
[1:00:09] so back again uh the prophet talking of
[1:00:12] elier Amen Abraham sending elier out to
[1:00:16] get a bride for Isaac the prophet said
[1:00:19] he swe it out he sweated it out he
[1:00:22] wasn't after just anybody he swe it out
[1:00:25] he was PR and oh God give me the right
[1:00:28] one send the right one let let me know
[1:00:30] her when he comes and and he she comes
[1:00:33] and but what he was looking for was
[1:00:36] character ain't that right so he sweated
[1:00:39] it out till he found character in
[1:00:43] Rebecca and then he had to get her
[1:00:46] dressed up ready let her stand still and
[1:00:50] listen at his message can you say Amen
[1:00:53] not some little giddy girl amen that
[1:00:56] that when she uh realized that she was
[1:00:58] going then she just takes off and goes
[1:01:00] somewhere El and trying to find him on
[1:01:03] her own but she knew that she it took
[1:01:06] him to lead her to her bridegroom can
[1:01:09] you say amen amen and she had enough
[1:01:12] character to sit there and to listen to
[1:01:15] the message he's sat there amen and hear
[1:01:18] the instruction of the message sit there
[1:01:21] and learn about what her future is can
[1:01:24] you say amen amen see so then God is
[1:01:28] looking for character and not membership
[1:01:31] amen see and so we we find that you
[1:01:35] remember that brother Bram talked about
[1:01:37] how that God showed him his
[1:01:41] ministry excuse me and and and and was
[1:01:45] his ministry was that of elaser Amen go
[1:01:49] get a bride for Isaac see and now notice
[1:01:52] and brother Brown said that's exactly
[1:01:54] what my Ministry is go get a bride go
[1:01:56] get a bride amen see a bride for who a
[1:01:59] bride for the the the the pope no the
[1:02:02] bride for a denominational bride no a
[1:02:05] bride for Christ can you say amen and
[1:02:08] only a prophet could come up with and
[1:02:10] get a word bride amen any any Theologian
[1:02:13] can get a bride for the pope and the
[1:02:15] Catholic church and the denominational
[1:02:17] bride amen but it took a Propet to call
[1:02:20] out a word bride amen dress her with a
[1:02:23] word can you say Amen now the prophet
[1:02:26] says I ain't looking for members I'm I'm
[1:02:29] looking for the pure in heart see
[1:02:32] somebody that'll believe the word amen
[1:02:35] that's what a prophet was looking for
[1:02:37] amen he traveled the world seven times
[1:02:40] around this world and and every night
[1:02:42] he's looking for somebody that'll
[1:02:45] believe the word amen the the people
[1:02:48] rejected him at the end of his uh his
[1:02:50] life uh uh uh he found no pulpits to to
[1:02:54] preach in cuz no one would accept accept
[1:02:56] him amen but it didn't matter to him
[1:02:58] amen he was on a mission find somebody
[1:03:01] that'll just believe the word amen
[1:03:04] that's right he said elzer looked and he
[1:03:06] thought oh I can't do this myself amen
[1:03:09] there's too much responsibility I'm see
[1:03:12] I I I realize the responsibility of
[1:03:14] finding Isaac a bride well see that that
[1:03:18] that's a type of the church see Christ
[1:03:20] Rebecca the type of the Bride so elaser
[1:03:23] got down on his knees and said God you
[1:03:25] have to help me and when he referred to
[1:03:27] God God helped him and he got character
[1:03:32] oh aren't you glad that the prophet
[1:03:34] wasn't relying upon his abilities he
[1:03:36] wasn't relying upon himself but every
[1:03:39] night he's saying God you got to help me
[1:03:41] amen and God helped him amen and this
[1:03:45] message is producing exactly what he was
[1:03:48] looking for character can you say Amen
[1:03:52] now see the bride's character comes from
[1:03:55] the word of God Amen and this message is
[1:03:58] what is cutting and shaping us into Sons
[1:04:01] and Daughters of God Amen this is why
[1:04:04] this message is so different and you
[1:04:06] young people you understand that amen
[1:04:08] this message ain't popular amen not
[1:04:10] everybody's going to understand this
[1:04:12] message they're not meant to understand
[1:04:14] the message why because this message is
[1:04:17] different from TD Jake and and Billy
[1:04:19] Graham and all Roberts and TL Osburn and
[1:04:22] and all the the millions of preachers
[1:04:24] and philosophers and the iians and
[1:04:26] doctors of divinity out there amen this
[1:04:28] is different for this message will cut
[1:04:31] you into Sons and Daughters of God
[1:04:35] that's exactly what God is looking for
[1:04:37] for this
[1:04:39] Rapture now we we find brother Braham
[1:04:42] said he's looking for the day for that
[1:04:44] bride to be formed now notice Hebrews
[1:04:47] 138 just exactly like it was like he was
[1:04:51] no wonder brother Braham kept saying
[1:04:52] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:04:54] forever same yesterday today and forever
[1:04:57] why because he that's what he was
[1:04:59] looking for in this age a bride that
[1:05:02] would be exactly like him amen that
[1:05:04] would look just like him have the
[1:05:06] character just like him he's the same
[1:05:09] yesterday today and forever that when
[1:05:11] you would put the two together they
[1:05:12] would be just alike with the same
[1:05:14] Ministry same character same quality
[1:05:17] same power same attitude same everything
[1:05:22] can you say amen amen it's God he says
[1:05:25] it's got to be his same flesh same bones
[1:05:28] Same Spirit same everything just exactly
[1:05:32] built up and then two then become one
[1:05:36] see not you and the bride or bridegroom
[1:05:40] and and bride but they become one can
[1:05:42] you say Amen just like Jesus said he
[1:05:45] that has seen me has seen the father how
[1:05:47] sayest thou show me the father can you
[1:05:49] sayen have I not been so long with you
[1:05:52] and you still don't know who I am amen
[1:05:54] now look where we're at in this age oh
[1:05:57] yes sir no wonder the Bible sir uh uh uh
[1:06:01] that the Bible says that this is a
[1:06:02] mirror that we're looking in a glass
[1:06:05] Darkly a mirror beholding the glory of
[1:06:10] the
[1:06:11] Lord can you say Amen so he says now
[1:06:15] they the two become one until the church
[1:06:18] becomes that they're not one see until
[1:06:21] they become same in everything Same
[1:06:23] Spirit same character same flesh same
[1:06:25] bones same word same see they're they're
[1:06:28] not one see see the character of him the
[1:06:32] word everybody say the word for this age
[1:06:36] must be molded she must be molded like
[1:06:40] he is ain't that right now notice what a
[1:06:45] prophet said character everybody say
[1:06:47] character is not a
[1:06:50] gift it's a
[1:06:52] victory character is not a gift it's a
[1:06:55] victory
[1:06:56] ain't that right a lot of things he
[1:06:58] gives us as gifts but not character
[1:07:01] character is molded within us see the
[1:07:05] word molds God's character to us the
[1:07:09] prophet said now I want to talk about
[1:07:11] our trials amen see it's hard to think
[1:07:14] that God Amen would try us and
[1:07:17] especially when we're going through the
[1:07:18] biggest trial of our life and and to
[1:07:21] really fathom that God is the one doing
[1:07:24] it now now Satan will get us convinced
[1:07:26] that God is doing it and so much that he
[1:07:28] turns it that God hates us God doesn't
[1:07:30] like us we've done something wrong we
[1:07:33] we've committed something and God's just
[1:07:35] dooming us and destroying us and all of
[1:07:37] that that that's that's just the lies of
[1:07:39] the devil amen but but we find job said
[1:07:43] when he hath when he hath tried me ain't
[1:07:48] that right but we know that God was not
[1:07:51] directly involved Amen in in the tri
[1:07:56] of of job he was not directly uh uh the
[1:08:00] cause of job's suffering amen but he did
[1:08:04] give Satan permission Amen to to test
[1:08:08] job amen Job 1 and 8 says the Lord said
[1:08:12] unto Satan behold all that he have is in
[1:08:15] thy power talking of job now now J
[1:08:18] remember Satan says well I well he if
[1:08:23] you go read the other uh previous up you
[1:08:26] know this verses amen that Satan
[1:08:28] appeared to God before God uh with the
[1:08:31] sons of God and and and God said where
[1:08:34] you been Satan oh i' just been going
[1:08:35] around you know and this and trying to
[1:08:37] tempt everybody and this and that and
[1:08:39] and and he getting everybody you know
[1:08:41] and he said well have you and God says
[1:08:43] have you considered my servant job so it
[1:08:46] was God that brought up job's name right
[1:08:48] and job had no idea that God was talking
[1:08:51] about him up there and and and uh to to
[1:08:54] the devil right
[1:08:56] and and so he was just having a good
[1:08:57] time at church and good time in life and
[1:09:00] just loving the Lord and just having an
[1:09:02] awesome time just all in Revival and
[1:09:05] God's up there amen uh uh willing and a
[1:09:07] dealing if you want to say it that way
[1:09:09] and and so we find that that Satan says
[1:09:13] oh yeah but you got a hedge about him
[1:09:15] you you know you I can't touch him amen
[1:09:18] but you you you you take that hedge off
[1:09:21] I'll get him to curse you in your face
[1:09:23] you know and and so this is where the
[1:09:25] Lord said unto Satan behold all that he
[1:09:28] hath is in thy power only upon himself
[1:09:32] put forth not to thine hand see and so
[1:09:36] Satan went from the presence of the Lord
[1:09:38] now what happens well the Revival ends
[1:09:40] for job right and uh uh uh feelings in
[1:09:44] for job and and and headaches start for
[1:09:47] job and and all chaos am man happens in
[1:09:51] job's life and family he lost his
[1:09:54] donkeys he lost the that that helped
[1:09:56] with the donkeys he lost the Sheep he
[1:09:58] lost the servants that helped with them
[1:10:00] sheep he lost you know he he lost
[1:10:03] everything he lost everything amen Bible
[1:10:06] says that his sheep his servants and all
[1:10:08] them got burned up and and and these
[1:10:10] things and then and this is all
[1:10:13] happening you know and and and and then
[1:10:15] on top of that his sons and daughters
[1:10:17] were all killed amen see and and and so
[1:10:21] in in job 1:20 we read how job reacted
[1:10:26] upon hearing all of this news and it
[1:10:28] seemed like it was just happening one
[1:10:30] after another have you ever just had
[1:10:31] trials like that where it's just like
[1:10:33] woo you know oh no what do I do and and
[1:10:36] and and the Bible says that job arose
[1:10:40] rent his Manel shaved his head fell down
[1:10:43] upon the ground and
[1:10:48] Bate no he didn't belly ache he
[1:10:51] worshiped and all that was going on he
[1:10:56] worshiped and said neaked I came out of
[1:10:59] my mother's womb and neaked shall I
[1:11:01] return thither the lord gave and the
[1:11:03] lord taketh away blessed be the name
[1:11:07] there was no accusation in job amen
[1:11:10] toward God there was no bitterness Amen
[1:11:12] in job toward God there was no walking
[1:11:15] away from God no he blessed the name of
[1:11:19] the Lord can you say Amen in the trials
[1:11:22] that he went through now so you think
[1:11:25] that been good enough right but no no no
[1:11:28] no so so here it goes again Satan re now
[1:11:31] returns back to God and and they're
[1:11:33] talking a little bit and and and of
[1:11:35] course job God already knew that job you
[1:11:38] know never denied him never cursed him
[1:11:40] never done all these things and and so
[1:11:43] we we find then then Satan says now if
[1:11:46] you'll give me his life let me let me
[1:11:48] let me just deal with him a little bit
[1:11:50] I've taken his sons I've taken his money
[1:11:52] I've taken his house I've taken it all
[1:11:54] but you let me deal with him let me let
[1:11:56] me put some plagues on him amen let let
[1:11:58] let me afflict his body let me afflict
[1:12:00] his spirit amen I'll get him to curse
[1:12:03] you amen God said okay let's do it that
[1:12:05] way then so behold he is in thine hand
[1:12:09] job 2:6 the Lord said unto Satan behold
[1:12:12] he is in thine hand but save his life
[1:12:17] have you ever just thought of why you're
[1:12:19] still living amen because God tells
[1:12:22] Satan you can do what you want to with
[1:12:24] him but don't you take his life can you
[1:12:27] say amen amen see but save his life so
[1:12:30] Satan went forth from the presence of
[1:12:33] the Lord and smoked job with sore balls
[1:12:36] from the soul of his foot unto his crown
[1:12:40] ain't that right now job must have been
[1:12:42] in such Agony and such pain and and of
[1:12:46] course he was forsaken by everybody that
[1:12:49] his his accusers and God would allow
[1:12:51] this now he had three accusers tell him
[1:12:54] everything of what he done wrong against
[1:12:56] God Amen right in the middle of the
[1:12:58] trial right in the middle of the
[1:13:00] situation he ain't got no help from all
[1:13:03] these guys ain't that right amen see and
[1:13:06] and we find amen that it must have been
[1:13:08] so bad that even his own wife told him
[1:13:10] Curse God and die job let's just get it
[1:13:12] all with it what a helpmate right amen
[1:13:16] no no encouragement patting him on the
[1:13:18] back and say buddy you can go on I I've
[1:13:20] heard you preach I've heard you sing I
[1:13:22] know God's for you buddy don't you worry
[1:13:24] about that honey bunny you know oh no no
[1:13:26] you just Curse God and die let's get it
[1:13:28] over with I you know I don't know what
[1:13:30] it was in her mind but
[1:13:34] anyways amen so maybe she just thought
[1:13:37] she could live alone without him right
[1:13:40] amen but see but but we find that that
[1:13:43] God proved to Satan that that job didn't
[1:13:46] serve him just because everything was
[1:13:49] going his way amen now we find in Romans
[1:13:53] 15 and4 it says for whatsoever things
[1:13:56] were written a fourth time were written
[1:13:58] for our learning everybody say it's
[1:14:00] written for our learning that we through
[1:14:03] fa patience and comfort of the
[1:14:06] scriptures might have hope now think of
[1:14:09] that that we through patience and
[1:14:11] comfort of the scriptures these
[1:14:13] scriptures ought to be your comfort amen
[1:14:15] when you're going through the trials
[1:14:17] when you're going through hell when when
[1:14:18] it seem like everything is against you
[1:14:21] amen you ought to find the comfort in
[1:14:22] these scriptures so many people put
[1:14:24] their Bibles up and and start into the
[1:14:27] news and and start into the magazines
[1:14:29] and start into this and that as if
[1:14:31] they're going to find Comfort Amen in
[1:14:33] their trial this ought to be your
[1:14:36] comfort God wouldn't have put these in
[1:14:38] in word form if he didn't have it for
[1:14:41] our
[1:14:43] comfort that's rightl can you say Amen
[1:14:47] so the story of job's suffering is for
[1:14:50] our learning that we through faith and P
[1:14:52] or patience and comfort might have hope
[1:14:56] but see so Satan couldn't have touched
[1:14:58] job in the way that he did if God hadn't
[1:15:02] GI given him permission to do so can you
[1:15:05] say Amen why do you think Satan was
[1:15:07] created in the first place I believe God
[1:15:09] gives us the answer Amen in Isaiah 54:15
[1:15:13] behold they shall surely gather together
[1:15:16] but not by me whosoever Shall Gather
[1:15:18] together against thee shall fall for thy
[1:15:20] sake behold I have created the Smith
[1:15:23] that bloweth the coals of the fire and
[1:15:26] that bringeth forth an instrument for
[1:15:27] his work and I have created the waster
[1:15:31] to destroy can you say Amen see so God
[1:15:34] in his wisdom God in his his in his his
[1:15:38] his way of doing things and it's the
[1:15:40] perfect way of doing things he created
[1:15:43] the devil Amen to to to send you through
[1:15:46] the trials amen he he created the devil
[1:15:50] Amen to to work upon you can you say
[1:15:53] amen amen well it it's true amen
[1:15:56] everything that Satan does is only to
[1:15:58] magnify God Amen we wouldn't know God as
[1:16:00] a Healer except amen somehow there was a
[1:16:03] sickness and who calls the sickness the
[1:16:05] devil calls the sickness amen the devil
[1:16:07] calls the fall the devil was de setfull
[1:16:10] called sin to happen the devil done all
[1:16:12] these things amen not God that God would
[1:16:15] allow it that he could be
[1:16:18] glorified can you say Amen so then job
[1:16:21] knew that he was in God's hands and that
[1:16:25] God was completely aware of what he was
[1:16:29] going through and where he was at amen
[1:16:32] so that's why he would attribute it uh
[1:16:35] uh that when he hath tried me amen see
[1:16:39] God was allowing it amen but job knew
[1:16:42] that he was perfectly safe in the hands
[1:16:45] of God oh my for God is a faithful God
[1:16:49] God is always mindful of his elect do
[1:16:52] you believe that amen first Peter 3
[1:16:55] and12 the eyes of the Lord are over the
[1:16:59] righteous and his ears are open unto
[1:17:02] their prayers can you say Amen now we
[1:17:05] read in Revelations and two where God
[1:17:08] says I Know Thy Works he's talking I
[1:17:10] believe to the sardes sardian age and he
[1:17:14] says I Know Thy works and
[1:17:17] tribulation and po poty so they're going
[1:17:21] through these things amen of tribulation
[1:17:24] and amen and if you study the the church
[1:17:26] ages you'll understand that this was not
[1:17:29] just a little snotty nose that they were
[1:17:31] having or a little flu amen that they
[1:17:33] were going through amen this was a real
[1:17:36] persecution that they were going through
[1:17:38] they were really suffering they they
[1:17:40] were going through the fire they they
[1:17:42] they were really amen being going
[1:17:45] through the ringer and yet God would
[1:17:47] tell them it's not that I don't know I
[1:17:50] know what you're going through I Know
[1:17:53] Thy tribulation I Know Thy poverty can
[1:17:56] you say amen that's right and the
[1:17:58] prophet says see amen look look he's
[1:18:01] walking in between he's walking in the
[1:18:03] midst of the church walking back and
[1:18:06] forth ain't that right he said see
[1:18:08] walking up and down in the midst of his
[1:18:10] church like a father he is looking down
[1:18:14] upon his family he is the head of the
[1:18:17] household he is the provider he is the
[1:18:19] protector now notice that he's the
[1:18:22] provider and yet he's looking at the him
[1:18:25] and saying I Know Thy poverty he is the
[1:18:28] protector and he says I Know Thy
[1:18:32] tribulation yet he looks on their
[1:18:35] poverty how he says oh how the untutored
[1:18:38] believer stumbles at that see how can
[1:18:42] God bear to look upon his own in a time
[1:18:45] of need and not just stop it all and
[1:18:48] just give in and lavish everything
[1:18:51] material upon them amen how can he be a
[1:18:54] gracious God and see his people
[1:18:56] suffering and in in need of of food in
[1:19:00] need of things that they were going
[1:19:02] through they were in poverty and God is
[1:19:04] just saying I know I know I know I know
[1:19:06] I know instead of lavishing all this
[1:19:09] materialistic things upon them he just
[1:19:12] sits back and he says I know what you're
[1:19:14] going
[1:19:18] through you see he could have kept them
[1:19:20] from tribulation if he wanted to but he
[1:19:22] didn't he could have kept them from
[1:19:24] poverty but he didn't and and the
[1:19:27] prophet says now this this is where you
[1:19:30] have to believe in the love and goodness
[1:19:34] and wisdom of God can you say Amen don't
[1:19:37] just talk about the love of God but look
[1:19:40] now he's a wise God also amen ain't that
[1:19:44] right he's a good god also but his
[1:19:47] goodness is not the way we would
[1:19:49] consider goodness his wisdom is not the
[1:19:51] ways the wisdom of man so you now you
[1:19:54] have to believe in his love you have to
[1:19:57] believe in his W wisdom and you have to
[1:20:00] believe in his goodness in times like
[1:20:05] this amen can you say Amen now job knew
[1:20:10] that God was
[1:20:11] faithful and that God was not allowing
[1:20:14] this to destroy him right the Bible says
[1:20:17] no weapon formed against the shall
[1:20:19] prosper this was written that we might
[1:20:21] take comfort in them can you say Amen
[1:20:25] it was written for our learning that no
[1:20:28] weapon formed against you is going to
[1:20:29] prosper yeah amen amen ain't that right
[1:20:33] now did you notice how can it not
[1:20:35] Prosper is because there is an eternal
[1:20:37] quality about the elect of God Ephesians
[1:20:41] 1:4 according as he hath chosen Us in
[1:20:44] him before the foundation of the world
[1:20:46] that we should be holy without and
[1:20:48] Without Blame before him in Love Now
[1:20:51] notice the prophet said this means that
[1:20:53] we were right there with him in the mind
[1:20:55] and thoughts of God before the
[1:20:57] foundation of the world and that gives
[1:21:00] an eternal quality to the elect you
[1:21:03] can't get away from that Satan can't get
[1:21:07] you away from that the trials can't get
[1:21:10] you away from that amen tribulation
[1:21:12] cannot get you away from that no matter
[1:21:15] where you're at it cannot get you away
[1:21:17] from that you've got an eternal quality
[1:21:21] about you for you were in the mind of
[1:21:24] God and chosen in him before the
[1:21:27] foundation of the world amen amen can
[1:21:30] you say Amen so joob knew that God was
[1:21:33] in charge of the situation amen now now
[1:21:37] he did not give Satan amen full control
[1:21:40] God remained control can you say amen
[1:21:44] God remained in control if if I hope you
[1:21:47] understand he knew that God was in
[1:21:49] charge God was at the helm he knew that
[1:21:52] God was allowing everything to happen to
[1:21:54] him or he wouldn't have been going
[1:21:56] through it I want you to understand that
[1:21:58] now God wouldn't have allowed them
[1:21:59] things to happen amen if he didn't want
[1:22:02] you to go through them things that's how
[1:22:04] big God is don't you think that God or
[1:22:07] Satan can override God in anything can
[1:22:09] you say Amen you must take comfort in
[1:22:12] the promises of God you must take
[1:22:14] comfort in the scriptures King amen well
[1:22:17] that's true now now notice he says now
[1:22:21] when Heath tried me I shall come forth
[1:22:24] as gold
[1:22:25] amen see now thinking thinking of that
[1:22:28] what job just said I shall come forth as
[1:22:30] gold now notice what God says when he
[1:22:33] addressed this lay otsy and age
[1:22:36] Revelations 3:17 because thou sayest I
[1:22:39] am rich and increase with goods and have
[1:22:42] need of nothing and knowest not that
[1:22:45] thou art wretched miserable poor blind
[1:22:47] and naked I counsel thee to buy of me
[1:22:51] what gold tried in the fire that thou
[1:22:56] mayest be
[1:22:57] rich and and notice now he's talking
[1:23:00] about it in this age you are the people
[1:23:04] that that we're we we are of the
[1:23:06] scripture now he's talking of course to
[1:23:07] the world Amen and he's bid the the the
[1:23:11] leay osia come unto me come unto me I
[1:23:13] challenge you I I bid you to come unto
[1:23:16] me and buy of me go try it in the fire
[1:23:20] amen see that thou may be rich now there

[1:23:27] iron pyite which is a Fool's Gold that's
[1:23:30] right and uh could you imagine being out

[1:25:27] it and he don't just seem excited as
[1:25:29] much as you might be and and you like
[1:25:32] man he's a he's a he's a jerk you know
[1:25:35] he should be excited with me he saids
[1:25:37] let me see that I need to examine well
[1:25:39] it's gold I'm telling you it's gold you
[1:25:41] know I I'm the one that dug for it it's
[1:25:43] shiny it does all that stuff man you
[1:25:46] know there ain't no need to no need to
[1:25:48] inspect that stuff well I need to
[1:25:50] inspect it see and and you know and then
[1:25:53] then he comes back out and and only to
[1:25:55] tell
[1:25:56] you it's Fool's Gold oh my now what that
[1:26:01] means is you've been
[1:26:04] fooled you stayed up all night for no
[1:26:07] reason you you you thought you were Rich
[1:26:10] for nothing you had all that plan for
[1:26:13] that jagar and you know Bahamas and all
[1:26:18] these things and and he's over there
[1:26:20] trying to tell you it's Fool's go you
[1:26:21] want to slap him upside the head you
[1:26:23] just ain't going to believe that right
[1:26:25] but you know the prophet talks about how
[1:26:27] that that the real the Fool's Gold
[1:26:29] outshines the real gold and it looks
[1:26:32] like gold but it's not see and so a man
[1:26:36] can be fulled now now he he talks about
[1:26:38] it in the old days that that uh uh the
[1:26:41] way they could tell the difference
[1:26:43] between uh the the real gold and Fool's
[1:26:46] Gold is that that the smelter amen would
[1:26:50] would take this piece of gold and he
[1:26:51] would beat it and he would beat it and
[1:26:53] he would beat it it and he would beat it
[1:26:55] and he would just keep beating and
[1:26:56] beating and beating and beating and and
[1:26:59] and all after a while stuff started
[1:27:02] flaking off the things that you thought
[1:27:05] was gold started just chipping away
[1:27:08] chipping here and chipping here and and
[1:27:10] and and the smelter ain't he ain't
[1:27:12] discouraged at all he just keeps beating
[1:27:15] and he beating and he beating and the
[1:27:17] prophet says now the way he really knows
[1:27:20] that he got gold is he beats it till he
[1:27:23] gets all that Fool's goat off gets all
[1:27:26] that sludge off and he can actually see
[1:27:29] his reflection in the goat can you amen
[1:27:33] see so then that that's where he knew
[1:27:36] amen that he had gotten gold now now I'm
[1:27:39] going to say it just ahead of time that
[1:27:41] God isn't fooled amen by by people's
[1:27:45] worship he's not fooled by people's
[1:27:47] confessions he's not full the Bible says

[1:27:59] away get all that pie right off of us

[1:28:15] church and be as as sinner as sinner can
[1:28:17] be and still dancing and shouting and
[1:28:19] all of that God's not interested in your
[1:28:22] worship amen if it's Fool's go God's not
[1:28:25] interested in all the songs that you
[1:28:26] sing and write if it's Fool's Gold God's

[1:30:51] now notice as as he's saying all of
[1:30:54] these things about the tribulation yet

[1:31:19] the off the shelves it's a rare Jewel
[1:31:22] amen see and and that's what makes this
[1:31:24] precious now the the prophet said
[1:31:26] there's going to be very few that make
[1:31:27] it in this bride amen but I'm going to
[1:31:30] tell you what kind of a bride she is
[1:31:31] she's going to be made up and this bride
[1:31:33] is going to be more precious than gold
[1:31:36] can you say Amen she's going to be as
[1:31:38] the gold that is tried in the fire amen

[1:31:49] faith everybody say the trial of my
[1:31:51] faith see now see being much more
[1:31:54] precious than of gold that perisheth
[1:31:57] though it be tried with fire might be
[1:32:00] found unto the praise and honor and
[1:32:02] Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ
[1:32:05] this bride is going to be made ready
[1:32:08] amen come on church this bride is going
[1:32:11] to be a ready bride amen this bride is
[1:32:14] going to be one that is it it when God

[1:32:30] reflection of him through you Amen on
[1:32:34] this
[1:32:35] Earth that's exactly right now your
[1:32:39] trials don't mean that you ain't got
[1:32:41] faith come on now you say well I've been
[1:32:44] praying the Lord to heal me and just I
[1:32:45] must not have that Faith oh that's a lie
[1:32:48] that doesn't mean anything like that I
[1:32:50] understand it takes Faith amen for you
[1:32:51] to get healed amen but a lot of times
[1:32:54] and sometimes amen God will allow you to
[1:32:57] remain that way and see what you'll do
[1:32:59] about
[1:33:00] it you going to sit there and talk
[1:33:02] negative you're going to sit there and
[1:33:03] act like you're
[1:33:07] dying come on now yes sir now notice so
[1:33:12] so this gold amen that we're we're
[1:33:15] coming to becoming coming forth as gold
[1:33:18] is not as the gold that
[1:33:20] perisheth see now notice what the
[1:33:22] prophet said the gold of God everybody
[1:33:24] say the gold of God is a Christlike
[1:33:28] character the gold of God is a
[1:33:31] Christlike character produced in the
[1:33:34] fiery furnace of
[1:33:37] Affliction amen can you say
[1:33:41] amen that's
[1:33:44] right now if you
[1:33:47] look and
[1:33:49] remember gold represents deity right
[1:33:55] the prophet says the organized churches
[1:33:57] of this Le Odyssey and age now remember
[1:33:59] it's in this age that he says buy of me
[1:34:01] gold tried in the fire but notice he's
[1:34:05] talking to a people and he says now see
[1:34:08] the organized churches of this Le
[1:34:11] Odyssey and
[1:34:13] age has the worldly gold that will
[1:34:18] perish it is Rich it is
[1:34:22] complacent it has made affluence in
[1:34:25] other words wealth the major Criterion
[1:34:28] of
[1:34:29] spirituality the evidence of God's
[1:34:31] blessings and the correctness of
[1:34:32] Doctrine Etc is now based upon how many
[1:34:36] Rich folks are involved in
[1:34:39] it can you say Amen but the prophet says
[1:34:43] they have gold but it's the wrong kind
[1:34:45] of gold and remember when when here is a
[1:34:50] a a people a
[1:34:52] church natural that has all this gold
[1:34:55] the
[1:34:57] wealth ain't that right and they have
[1:35:00] accumulated all of this yes sir and and
[1:35:04] and they've gained Power by this and yet
[1:35:07] when God reads it and when God looks at
[1:35:09] him he says you're wretched blind
[1:35:12] poor and naked don't even know
[1:35:16] it and it's in this that he says come
[1:35:19] and buy of me gold Lord if you want gold
[1:35:22] come and buy of me
[1:35:25] amen tried everybody say tried in the
[1:35:29] fire amen see now the prophet said see
[1:35:32] the gold they have buys men's lives and
[1:35:36] destroys them it's a gold that warps and
[1:35:40] twists human character for its love is
[1:35:44] the root of all evil can you sayen so
[1:35:48] but it's in this day of Le osia that we
[1:35:52] hear a voice come out of her my
[1:35:55] people I've got a gold come out of
[1:36:00] her that's right thank youus am
[1:36:05] Hallelujah aren't you glad you come
[1:36:13] [Music]
[1:36:15] out thank you we come into this world
[1:36:18] physically
[1:36:20] naked but when we leave this world
[1:36:24] will not go out spiritually
[1:36:29] Naked Brother Bram says every one of us
[1:36:31] is going to take something with us and
[1:36:33] that is our
[1:36:36] character it's the only thing that we'll
[1:36:38] be able to take with us notice what he
[1:36:41] says we had better be real careful now
[1:36:45] to see that we take something that will
[1:36:48] make us right before
[1:36:51] God Amen what kind of character will you
[1:36:55] take with you will it be like his whose
[1:36:58] character was molded by suffering in the
[1:37:01] fiery furnace of
[1:37:03] Affliction or will it be the softness of
[1:37:06] this characterless lotan
[1:37:09] people can you say Amen yes see if if if
[1:37:13] if you want to the easy route that's
[1:37:17] exactly what Le oosa is that's the
[1:37:20] people of the age that they're they're
[1:37:23] characterless people they don't want to
[1:37:25] go through trials remember it's the age
[1:37:28] of people's rights don't you tell me
[1:37:30] what to do that
[1:37:33] preacher preacher don't you tell me what
[1:37:35] Pastor don't you Pastor me I'm own
[1:37:39] person can you say amen I I got the Holy
[1:37:42] Ghost I know what I'm doing see but it's
[1:37:44] a characterless generation see oh man we
[1:37:49] we don't want to go through the trials
[1:37:50] we we look if God loves us he's going to
[1:37:52] vindicate us we look and we we act like
[1:37:54] the the the two disciples amen that
[1:37:56] wanted to call fire down from heaven
[1:37:58] upon these these
[1:38:00] Renegades that didn't treat him
[1:38:03] right can you say amen and then all of a
[1:38:06] sudden when we go through moments of
[1:38:08] crying when we go through moments of
[1:38:09] loneliness when we go through moments of
[1:38:11] confusion when we go through moments of
[1:38:13] feeling rejected we feel like God has
[1:38:16] already forsaken
[1:38:20] us can you say
[1:38:22] Amen but see will it be like his whose
[1:38:25] character was molded by suffering in the
[1:38:27] fiery furnace of Affliction or will it
[1:38:29] be the softness of this characterless
[1:38:31] leoty and people now notice in another
[1:38:34] place he says see the church owns such a
[1:38:36] phenomenal wealth see that at any time
[1:38:40] notice the power that she has with this
[1:38:42] wealth she owns the church owns such
[1:38:45] phenomenal wealth that at any given time
[1:38:47] she can take over the entire world's
[1:38:49] system of Commerce buddy she's doing it
[1:38:55] amen amen she's doing it
[1:38:59] yeah and indeed a leader in the world
[1:39:02] Council of churches has openly
[1:39:04] prophesied that the church in the
[1:39:06] foreseeable future should could and will
[1:39:09] do just that but their golden Tower of
[1:39:13] Babel shall fall amen only the gold
[1:39:17] tried in the fire shall
[1:39:22] endure say Amen this gold that he's
[1:39:26] offering them is
[1:39:28] himself deity living in
[1:39:31] flesh the gold your money your wealth
[1:39:34] your materialistic things are going to
[1:39:36] die out amen yes can you say Amen but
[1:39:41] I'm giving you a gold I give you myself
[1:39:46] and the church kicks him
[1:39:48] out
[1:39:50] amen
[1:39:52] name only the gold tried and the fire
[1:39:54] shall endure and that is what the church
[1:39:57] has constantly done Through the Ages she
[1:39:59] has left the word of God and taken her
[1:40:00] own Creeds and dogmas she has organized
[1:40:03] and joined herself to the world thus she
[1:40:06] is naked and God is judging her lewdness
[1:40:09] and the only way she can get out of this
[1:40:10] dread situation is by B obeying the word
[1:40:14] of the Lord to come back to his word can
[1:40:16] you sayen and what is that word come out
[1:40:19] of her my people think of that Amen in a
[1:40:21] rich nation in a rich world world and
[1:40:24] when when when when when the power of
[1:40:26] wealth is here amen and God is saying
[1:40:29] come by of me then we're hearing this
[1:40:32] come out of her my
[1:40:34] people amen that's right now it's by the
[1:40:38] message of the hour that we could only
[1:40:39] come out don't think you can come out by
[1:40:42] some
[1:40:43] commentary you cannot come out by by
[1:40:46] some Theologian not some philosophy not
[1:40:50] psychology you you couldn't come out by
[1:40:52] any of that it took a prophet to call us
[1:40:55] out and that Prophet would be a prophet
[1:40:57] of Malachi 4 that would turn our hearts
[1:41:00] back to the
[1:41:01] word can you say amen and not just to
[1:41:04] the word of some man's idea but the
[1:41:06] original word remember the prophet amen
[1:41:09] he says I've read this you know Clark
[1:41:11] and I've read you know pink and I've
[1:41:13] read this and I've read that and I've
[1:41:14] read this and he and he and he was going
[1:41:16] to take some of their thoughts amen even
[1:41:18] on the seals amen he said I even had
[1:41:21] thoughts of my own but then he came down
[1:41:24] why it's back to the original word that
[1:41:27] no man could have ever come up with no
[1:41:30] man I don't care how much schooling how
[1:41:32] smart how anointed it took a prophet to
[1:41:36] take us back to the original
[1:41:41] word hallu take us back not to a form of
[1:41:45] Doctrine not to another form of religion
[1:41:48] but we're being transformed by the
[1:41:51] renewing of our mind transformed can you
[1:41:54] say Amen now notice the prophet said the
[1:41:57] trouble of it is today when you find
[1:41:59] character it's hard to make them stand
[1:42:01] still long enough to put on clothes and
[1:42:03] get dressed up that's right see some
[1:42:05] little Ricky doesn't pull them off in
[1:42:07] some other direction it's hard to preach
[1:42:10] truth anymore because you got all these
[1:42:12] ideas out there and and they get mad
[1:42:14] they just go to somewhere else amen
[1:42:17] they'll quit Church they'll do this
[1:42:18] they'll do that it's hard to get people
[1:42:20] to stand still amen and tell character
[1:42:24] is really reflected in
[1:42:30] them
[1:42:33] now
[1:42:34] notice the trial and sufferings that job
[1:42:37] went through it did not change the mind
[1:42:40] of God about him at all bless the Lord
[1:42:43] and God saved you Sanctified you filled
[1:42:46] you with the Holy Ghost and there's not
[1:42:48] one
[1:42:49] time that he has ever changed his mind
[1:42:52] about you thank God thank
[1:42:58] God hello praise God a truth that must
[1:43:02] root in our soul
[1:43:04] yes sir he will allow you to go through
[1:43:09] hell but he hadn't changed his mind
[1:43:11] about you that's right I'm thankful
[1:43:14] thank you Jes there's something that
[1:43:16] he's after amen amen yes sir prise the
[1:43:20] Lord can you say amen amen hope this all
[1:43:22] right
[1:43:25] now notice job 23:13 but he is of in one
[1:43:28] mind everybody say he is in one mind now
[1:43:30] this is a man that has gone through
[1:43:32] suffering this is a man that's gone
[1:43:33] through just just turmoil this is a man
[1:43:36] that has went to the bottom of the
[1:43:38] barrel and like I say even his own wife
[1:43:40] is now encouraging him give it up die
[1:43:43] Job Curse God Walk Away From
[1:43:47] Him and notice what job says but he is
[1:43:50] in one mind who can turn him
[1:43:54] right what his so desireth even that he
[1:43:58] doeth for he performeth a thing that is
[1:44:01] appointed for me you go and many such
[1:44:05] things are with him now notice the the
[1:44:08] the prophet said God harnesses trouble
[1:44:11] puts bit bits in its mouth and makes it
[1:44:14] obey him that's ain't that right now if
[1:44:17] you look job 1:22 it says and in all of
[1:44:20] this job sinned not nor charged God
[1:44:28] foolishly can you say Amen now there's
[1:44:30] your bride there's the bride right there
[1:44:32] they go through hell they go through the
[1:44:34] Flames they go through water they go
[1:44:36] through suffering they go through
[1:44:38] turmoil they go through trial after
[1:44:40] trial after trial after trial and yet in
[1:44:43] all of it they never sin against God in
[1:44:46] other words they never give up in in in
[1:44:49] disbelief and and and give up on their
[1:44:52] faith to God and they never never ever
[1:44:55] charge God
[1:44:59] foolishly Hallelujah can you say
[1:45:02] Amen now you're talking about getting
[1:45:04] down to real
[1:45:05] gold
[1:45:07] amen could you imagine what would happen
[1:45:10] to you if Satan was actually in charge
[1:45:13] of what happens to you in your for your
[1:45:16] future and you
[1:45:18] sayen but if we actually have this
[1:45:21] understanding of God and that he is in
[1:45:23] charge of everything that comes our way
[1:45:25] then we can actually rest oh God help us
[1:45:28] rest that's the Christian Life is rest
[1:45:31] rest rest rest rest God never tells us
[1:45:34] what you were going to go through before
[1:45:35] we go through it he just says rest rest
[1:45:38] can you say amen he gave you the holy
[1:45:40] ghost that you could rest rest ain't
[1:45:43] that right amen see we can rest in every
[1:45:46] promise that God has given us amen they
[1:45:49] were written for our learning and our
[1:45:52] comfort
[1:45:53] so you know let's look at it now because
[1:45:56] God has actually made promises for us
[1:45:59] when we go through trials he already
[1:46:01] knew you going to go through trials
[1:46:03] listen now he already knew it he you you
[1:46:05] ain't going to be babied no no no no God
[1:46:07] ain't your granddaddy no God ain't the
[1:46:11] guy that's got the candy bars and the
[1:46:12] ice cream and all that every time you
[1:46:14] show up to his
[1:46:16] house amen amen can you say Amen you're
[1:46:21] going to go through trials but notice he
[1:46:23] gives us the promises Isaiah 54:17 no
[1:46:26] weapon that is formed against thee shall
[1:46:28] prosper every tongue then that shall
[1:46:30] rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt
[1:46:32] condemn this is the heritage of the
[1:46:35] Servants of the Lord and the
[1:46:36] righteousness is of me sayith the Lord
[1:46:40] amen 1 Corinthians 10:13 there hath no
[1:46:43] temptation taken you amen but such as is
[1:46:46] common to man but God is faithful who
[1:46:49] will not suffer you to be tempted above
[1:46:53] that you are able can you say amen he
[1:46:55] will not put something on you that you
[1:46:57] cannot bear so if you start cursing God
[1:47:00] if you walk away from God it's your
[1:47:06] fault sir can you say Amen cuz he
[1:47:09] promised that he would not put anything
[1:47:11] upon us that we cannot bear so we can't
[1:47:13] just go around me I just don't know and
[1:47:16] I'm talking about all of us
[1:47:18] now can you say amen he said see amen
[1:47:22] but we everybody say but will God will
[1:47:26] with the Temptation also make a way to
[1:47:29] escape that you may be able to Bear
[1:47:34] it that tells us that the trials ain't
[1:47:37] there to destroy you the grace of God is
[1:47:40] with you that you may be able to
[1:47:46] Bear
[1:47:47] [Music]
[1:47:49] Hallelujah Romans 8:27 and we know that
[1:47:52] all all things work together for the
[1:47:54] good to them that love him love God to
[1:47:57] them who are called according to his
[1:47:58] purpose see these are promises can you

[1:48:04] the on the mountain
[1:48:06] top these are for written for your
[1:48:09] learning and for your comfort in The
[1:48:13] Valleys can you say Amen now notice what
[1:48:16] job went through was for his good it was
[1:48:20] and you could read the whole chapter and
[1:48:22] find out amen but here's one verse job
[1:48:24] 42:5 I have heard of thee by the hearing
[1:48:26] of the ear but now everybody say but now
[1:48:29] my eye seeth thee what did he do in the
[1:48:32] trials he got a revelation of his
[1:48:35] Redeemer oh my but it took the trial for
[1:48:38] him to get there amen he had been
[1:48:40] hearing of him he had been uh uh
[1:48:42] learning of him but now he saw
[1:48:46] him it was for his
[1:48:50] good the Lord hallelujah see those
[1:48:53] troubles the prophet said that God
[1:48:55] allows to come our way brings us into a
[1:48:57] closer fellowship with God if Noah
[1:49:00] hadn't been pressed into the condition
[1:49:02] that he was in to float for 40 days and
[1:49:06] nights in a storm and that little Ark
[1:49:08] pitching and forward and backwards and
[1:49:11] rocking and and all of these things see
[1:49:14] but yet it took that before he could see
[1:49:16] the
[1:49:19] rainbow before he could see the rainbow
[1:49:21] sister Martha what was that rainbow it
[1:49:23] was a covenant of Promise can you say
[1:49:26] amen amen but it took all that that
[1:49:28] tossing and the turbulence and the
[1:49:30] turmoil and being there in the stink
[1:49:32] with the with the animals and all that
[1:49:34] but God brought him through and he SS
[1:49:37] the rainbow amen it took the flood to
[1:49:40] produce the rainbow the prophet said see
[1:49:43] amen the rainbow stands as a covenant of
[1:49:45] Hope the Covenant of Promise see and
[1:49:48] after he had went through the
[1:49:49] tribulation talking of job he saw the
[1:49:52] promise see that's the way you see the
[1:49:54] Promise after you've gone through the
[1:49:56] tribulation a lot of times we ask for
[1:49:58] God to give us Revelation let us get
[1:50:00] more amen but you understand that it
[1:50:03] takes the trials it takes the turmoils
[1:50:06] it takes the amen the things that we it
[1:50:08] lot these things doesn't come easy can
[1:50:10] you say amen I look at you Elders that
[1:50:13] you have gone through amen and maybe
[1:50:14] you're standing there and and and many
[1:50:17] times as a as a young man I would look
[1:50:19] at my elders I'd say I'd like to be like
[1:50:20] that I'd like to be that you know but I
[1:50:23] but but now I'm understanding amen for
[1:50:25] them to get there they had to go through
[1:50:27] the rocking and the turmoil and the
[1:50:29] ripping and the and the agony and the
[1:50:31] tears and the crying and the the
[1:50:33] suffering but they stood can you say
[1:50:36] Amen they
[1:50:40] stood a lot of times of our a lot of
[1:50:43] times a lot of times my sermons are made
[1:50:46] of of
[1:50:47] trials that I had to go
[1:50:51] through told the Lord Lord I've told the
[1:50:54] Lord for years Lord make me a man of
[1:50:56] prayer I want to be a man of
[1:51:00] prayer I believe God's heard
[1:51:04] me I thought it would be just an
[1:51:06] anointing come and sweep over me and I
[1:51:09] just all of a sudden he just waves that
[1:51:11] magic oneand and I just become a man of
[1:51:14] prayer trials drive you to your
[1:51:17] knees agonies drive you to your knees
[1:51:20] loneliness drives you to your knees
[1:51:23] heartbreaks drive you to your knees amen
[1:51:25] the trials that are upon you drive you
[1:51:27] to your knees can you say Amen see God
[1:51:30] is after the end product he's not after
[1:51:33] what you think you ought to be amen when
[1:51:35] you first become a Christian when I
[1:51:36] first become a Christian I thought I'd r
[1:51:38] that oh no no no God saw something that
[1:51:41] he wanted out of Shawn Martin and it
[1:51:43] took a lot of crying for and the
[1:51:44] shedding of tears and God why I don't
[1:51:47] understand amen and the and the
[1:51:48] loneliness and Satan talking to me and
[1:51:50] saying see give it up give it up give it
[1:51:52] up God don't love you you crossed the
[1:51:54] line and all of these things but I'm
[1:51:57] still here amen because there is a gold
[1:52:00] that God is after he's purifying us and
[1:52:03] we're coming forth as pure
[1:52:06] gold Christlike character Christlike
[1:52:11] character Christlike character amen
[1:52:14] there's things that maybe we handled
[1:52:16] down the road that we maybe wish we
[1:52:18] could have redone but now God has put us
[1:52:20] in a place he going to mold you he going
[1:52:23] to put you on the wheel he going to
[1:52:25] shape you he's going to mold you until
[1:52:28] Christ be formed in
[1:52:32] you Christ be
[1:52:35] [Music]
[1:52:37] formed amen amen that's true Prophet
[1:52:40] said we ask for comfort and peace God
[1:52:43] gives us the best he could give us
[1:52:44] trials and
[1:52:48] tribulations now notice what he says the
[1:52:50] prophet only could tell us and comfort
[1:52:52] us
[1:52:53] he said that's better than comfort and
[1:52:56] peace
[1:52:59] what my heart
[1:53:03] rending and I feel like I can't go
[1:53:06] anywhere and I'm standing here feeling
[1:53:09] like that man that had that dream
[1:53:10] standing all alone I can't see the other
[1:53:14] Footprints and that's better than
[1:53:17] comfort and
[1:53:19] peace think about it Oh my he said see
[1:53:22] our Comforts just beyond the river can
[1:53:25] you say man Hallelujah see it was after
[1:53:28] the Hebrew children was forced into one
[1:53:30] of their most outstanding trials the
[1:53:32] prophet said that they seen one liking
[1:53:34] the Son of God standing among them oh
[1:53:37] church if you only understand we are the
[1:53:40] bride of Christ she is him she is him
[1:53:44] and it's not him being reflected by our
[1:53:47] own abilities our own talents he's
[1:53:50] molding his cow
[1:53:57] character see according to the
[1:53:59] scriptures we must be tested and tried
[1:54:01] that's right Romans 816 the spirit
[1:54:04] beareth witness the spirit itself
[1:54:06] beareth witness with our spirit that we
[1:54:08] are the children of God and if children
[1:54:11] then heirs Heirs of God and join HS with
[1:54:13] Christ if so be that we suffer with him
[1:54:17] why do we need to suffer with him that
[1:54:19] we may also be glorified together for I
[1:54:22] reckon now I reckon that the sufferings
[1:54:25] of this present time are not worthy to
[1:54:28] be to be compared with the glory which
[1:54:31] shall be revealed in us this is a man
[1:54:33] that's not just writing amen and and
[1:54:36] living out in the Bahamas this is a man
[1:54:38] that has been beaten this is a man that
[1:54:40] has been stoned to death this is a man
[1:54:43] that has been rejected where he says all
[1:54:45] Asia has forsaken me Demus have forsaken
[1:54:48] me this is a man that has gone blind
[1:54:51] amen because of being in prison most of
[1:54:53] his ministry this is a man that had to
[1:54:56] borrow somebody's coat this is a man
[1:54:58] whose letters had to be written by
[1:55:00] somebody else than his own hand and yet
[1:55:03] he's saying but this is for our good
[1:55:06] that the glory of the Lord may be
[1:55:10] revealed
[1:55:12] amen praise the Lord bless his name
[1:55:16] brother Ram says unless we suffer with
[1:55:18] him we cannot reign with him see you
[1:55:21] have to suffer everybody say I have to
[1:55:23] suffer and I'm not talking about self-
[1:55:26] Affliction don't go around cutting
[1:55:28] yourself and punching yourself in the
[1:55:31] nose we have to suffer to
[1:55:34] rain the reason for this is that
[1:55:37] character simply is never made without
[1:55:40] suffering character is a victory not a
[1:55:42] gift a man without character cannot
[1:55:45] Reign because power power apart from
[1:55:47] character is satanic and how are we
[1:55:49] seeing that in the world today but Power
[1:55:51] with character is fit to rule and since
[1:55:54] he wants us to share he wants us to
[1:55:57] share his own Throne see on the same
[1:56:01] basis that he overcome and is sit down
[1:56:05] in his father's Throne then we have to
[1:56:08] overcome to sit with him and the little
[1:56:11] the little temporary suffering we go
[1:56:14] through now is not worthy to be compared
[1:56:16] to the tremendous Glory that will be
[1:56:19] revealed in us when he comes oh what
[1:56:22] Treasures are laid up for those who are
[1:56:24] willing to enter into his kingdom
[1:56:26] through much
[1:56:29] tribulation much
[1:56:31] tribulation yes
[1:56:33] Jesus this is why God stands by and lets
[1:56:36] us go through
[1:56:38] suffering did not Jesus have to suffer
[1:56:41] amen he had to suffer Hebrews 5'8 I'm
[1:56:44] going to let you go but though he were a
[1:56:47] son yet he learned obedience by the
[1:56:49] things which he suffered amen and being
[1:56:52] made perfect he became the
[1:56:54] author the
[1:56:56] author of Eternal salvation unto all
[1:56:59] them that obey him so the very character
[1:57:02] of Jesus was perfected by his suffering
[1:57:06] can you say amen and the prophet said
[1:57:09] and he he has left his church a measure
[1:57:11] of suffering that they too by their
[1:57:14] faith in God while suffering for him
[1:57:16] would come to a place of perfection amen
[1:57:20] this is why Paul would tell us in
[1:57:21] Hebrews 12 12 and 5 and and ye have
[1:57:24] forgotten the exhortation which speaketh
[1:57:27] unto you as unto children my son
[1:57:29] despised not amen the the chastening of
[1:57:32] the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked
[1:57:35] for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth
[1:57:38] amen and and and scores every son whom
[1:57:42] he receiveth see so it's God's love to
[1:57:45] you that he would send you through the
[1:57:46] trials why because he knows what you are
[1:57:50] he know he gave you the Holy Ghost bill
[1:57:52] Amen Brother Bill amen for a reason amen
[1:57:55] it's himself now he wants to be
[1:57:57] reflected through us his character his
[1:58:01] life his nature amen amen amen
[1:58:07] amen God hasn't promised us a flowery
[1:58:10] bed of ease Amen brother Bram said what
[1:58:13] he has promised is a lot of mountains
[1:58:18] sir but he also promised us Grace to go
[1:58:21] over over every one of them Lord can you
[1:58:24] say
[1:58:25] amen he says and every child of God has
[1:58:28] to be child trained take some weapons
[1:58:31] and straighten up he said you know how
[1:58:33] to act then how to conduct yourself as a
[1:58:37] Christian see God gives you a little bit
[1:58:39] of whipping once in a while turns you
[1:58:41] around a few times and you know what
[1:58:44] it's all about see lays you on your back
[1:58:46] so you can look up ain't that right see
[1:58:50] so therefore we talk about being Messiah
[1:58:52] Ed we talk about being Miss Jesus Christ
[1:58:54] we talk but see the character amen the
[1:58:57] only way it can be perfected through us
[1:58:59] is through suffering can you say amen
[1:59:02] amen that's right see he gives you
[1:59:05] Prophet says he gives you trial after
[1:59:06] trial test after test trial after trial
[1:59:09] test after test until the Life of Christ
[1:59:12] is reflected in your life until you
[1:59:15] become peaceful sober Meek gentle humble
[1:59:19] ready submissive willing turn your head
[1:59:21] from the things of the world and looking
[1:59:23] straight to Calvary to the one who's
[1:59:25] doing the beating amen see many times
[1:59:29] you think it's strange because fiery
[1:59:31] trials and sickness and persecutions but
[1:59:34] it's only done to test you to get the
[1:59:36] dirt out of you to get the sludge out of
[1:59:38] you to get the slow out of you amen see
[1:59:42] to wake you up to the place where you
[1:59:44] can look and see the reflection or men
[1:59:46] can see the reflection of Christ in you
[1:59:49] for it is today Christ in you you Christ
[1:59:52] in you everybody say it's Christ in me
[1:59:55] the hope of glory and that is not just a
[1:59:58] by word god means it God sees it God
[2:00:01] filled you with himself and now he's
[2:00:04] going to make you
[2:00:06] suffer to build that character to where
[2:00:08] it can be
[2:00:10] [Music]
[2:00:12] reflected his name that's
[2:00:15] true no more saying well I got the Holy
[2:00:18] Ghost cuz I
[2:00:19] danced on on
[2:00:23] oh I'm on my way to heaven because I
[2:00:25] just feel

[2:00:34] James 1 and 2 my brethren count it all
[2:00:37] joy when you fall into diverse
[2:00:38] Temptation count it all
[2:00:41] joy knowing this that the trying of your
[2:00:43] faith worketh
[2:00:45] patience but let patience have her
[2:00:48] perfect work that you may be perfect in
[2:00:50] Tire wanting or lacking nothing
[2:00:53] amen 1 Peter 4:12 beloved think it not
[2:00:56] strange concerning the fiery trial which
[2:00:58] is to try you as though some strange
[2:01:01] thing happened unto you but rejoice in
[2:01:04] as much as you are partakers of Christ's
[2:01:06] sufferings that when his glory shall be
[2:01:09] revealed you may be glad also with
[2:01:12] exceeding
[2:01:13] Joy oh a joy that is beyond the world
[2:01:17] could give you it's a joy amen that
[2:01:21] money can't buy it's a joy that no
[2:01:24] vacation can give you it's a joy it's a
[2:01:27] joy you've gone through the suffering
[2:01:30] you've endured the hardships you've
[2:01:32] you've gone you stayed faithful you your
[2:01:35] patience have have come out now amen
[2:01:38] because you had that faith and the
[2:01:39] trying of your faith that oh the glory
[2:01:42] of God is being
[2:01:43] revealed in US brother brah says is it
[2:01:47] strange that God wants us to develop a
[2:01:49] Christlike character that comes through
[2:01:51] suffering
[2:01:52] no sir see and we all have trials we are
[2:01:56] all tried and chastened as sons and no
[2:01:58] one but goes through that and the church
[2:02:01] that is not suffering and is not being
[2:02:03] tried hasn't isn't of God can you say
[2:02:07] amen and he says oh we need the Lord to
[2:02:10] teach us the truth that we are to suffer
[2:02:13] and be Christlike in doing it Lord
[2:02:16] hallelujah God
[2:02:18] teaches can you say Amen we could go on
[2:02:23] and on and
[2:02:24] on I thought of how that you
[2:02:27] know the world today they they they look
[2:02:30] for emotions they look for feelings they
[2:02:32] look for
[2:02:33] security they look it's it's like a
[2:02:36] pacifier and if you're not careful if
[2:02:39] you're not careful this is what the the
[2:02:41] the the Apostolic Pentecostal
[2:02:44] was is is they they look to the gifts as
[2:02:47] a
[2:02:48] pacifier oh they go through trials oh if
[2:02:51] someone could just just prophesy good
[2:02:52] over me oh if I could just feel the Lord
[2:02:56] and so they go and the Bible says they
[2:02:58] go run to and fro trying to find the
[2:03:01] word of the
[2:03:02] Lord and and we find that oh if they
[2:03:04] could just have a dream of me if they
[2:03:06] could just prophesy but see here's a
[2:03:08] bride that's been
[2:03:10] tried she's a word bride and as she's
[2:03:13] going through the trials she doesn't
[2:03:15] need a dream she doesn't need someone to
[2:03:17] prophesy she doesn't need someone to you
[2:03:20] know to speak words of Peace over she's
[2:03:23] got the peace of God she's got the word
[2:03:26] she's standing purely on thus sayith the
[2:03:29] Lord can you sayen I thought of my dad
[2:03:33] he's he's not had any dreams about him
[2:03:35] being healed he's not had any Vision saw
[2:03:37] about him getting healed he's not had
[2:03:39] any Prophecies of him getting healed
[2:03:41] he's not had everybody applaud him of
[2:03:43] him getting healed he's not had any
[2:03:45] songs written about him about getting
[2:03:46] healed he's not had any of that but one
[2:03:49] thing he does is he stands upon on thus
[2:03:51] sayth the Lord and his confession is
[2:03:53] still the same by his stripes I am
[2:03:55] healed by his stripes I am healed and we
[2:03:58] see the man going through the Affliction
[2:04:00] but all we can know and all I see is God
[2:04:03] purifying and he's going to come forth
[2:04:05] as gold he's going to come forth amen
[2:04:07] and see that's what it is amen more than
[2:04:09] your singing ability God wants to show
