[48:42] they're doing better
[48:44] a man and uh glad to have the boys back
[48:48] he took a trip to Oklahoma Thursday
[48:52] Daniel and Judah and brother Junior and
[48:56] so they made it in at 10 o'clock this
[48:58] morning
[48:59] so but we appreciate them and glad the
[49:03] Lord kept them on the road
[49:06] brought them back safely and um
[49:10] also we want to remember communion
[49:13] tonight as well and uh just believe the
[49:18] Lord to to be with us and
[49:21] um
[49:22] brother Amos was telling me before
[49:25] service that
[49:27] he got a minister last night to at a
[49:31] mission kind of is that is that what it
[49:33] was a mission there in Roanoke
[49:35] and
[49:37] oh Glenn Lynn
[49:39] uh so uh but just had a wonderful time a
[49:43] wonderful Liberty and introduced the
[49:46] message to them
[49:48] us so we thank the Lord for that and
[49:51] just pray that the Lord just keep that
[49:53] door open and uh the Lord just use him
[49:58] in a mighty way amen and I think that's
[50:02] what it's about is just trying to reach
[50:04] uh the that last soul that last seed
[50:08] amen and um so uh but also just to let
[50:13] you know we're not going to be we'll be
[50:15] dismissing uh Sunday night service next
[50:18] Sunday and for the young people young
[50:22] couples uh like to have a question and
[50:25] answer at night and uh maybe we'll just
[50:30] do it at the house maybe outside around
[50:32] the bond a fire or so and so if you have
[50:37] any questions that you you you have and
[50:41] we could talk about them and and just go
[50:46] from there and I think it'd be just a
[50:48] good time amen so no no Sunday night
[50:52] service next Sunday and here and so also
[50:58] tonight
[51:00] I would like for you to um very you that
[51:04] that would want to bring bring a
[51:06] notebook and I got I'm going to go
[51:08] through a lot of scriptures tonight
[51:10] about the Oneness of god of what we
[51:13] believe and
[51:15] um and uh not going to really just teach
[51:18] on it as much as just give scriptures go
[51:21] through the Bible and give scriptures
[51:22] and you write them down and I think it'd
[51:26] be good for you young people
[51:27] to write them down and and something I
[51:31] was telling uh uh well I believe I've
[51:34] told my children but it's telling uh
[51:37] Faith the other day that a lot a lot of
[51:40] times I'll start with a a uh a scripture
[51:43] I'll just start an opening scripture
[51:45] that I'm familiar with and then
[51:49] um I'll take another scripture and I'll
[51:51] write down where where it's found by
[51:56] that one scripture and uh that way if
[51:59] I'm talking to someone about scriptures
[52:02] then then I'll go to that one
[52:05] scripture main scripture and by that it
[52:08] it tells me where to go next and then I
[52:11] take it and I'll go to that scripture
[52:12] and then I'll write another scripture
[52:14] down and and it takes it all the way
[52:16] through the Bible and
[52:19] um and because people want to know what
[52:21] we believe and what we do believe is in
[52:23] the Bible
[52:24] I I couldn't point you to a Creed or a
[52:27] Dogma or a denomination but we can point
[52:30] you to the Bible of what we believe and
[52:33] so
[52:35] um I I think it'd be good uh to go
[52:37] through these things and and
[52:40] um and and sometime we take it for
[52:42] granted that everybody knows and uh
[52:45] which which you know you young people
[52:48] should know what we believe but you need
[52:50] to know why you believe it and um
[52:52] understand you know as to why so
[52:55] sometimes uh we we forget maybe just to
[52:59] go back to foundational uh Doctrine
[53:03] beliefs or whatever but and so but but
[53:08] the Bible does say uh study to show
[53:11] thyself approved and uh that rightly
[53:14] dividing the word of Truth and and of
[53:17] course the other scripture that tells us
[53:20] that every man ought to be able to give
[53:22] an answer to the hope that lies within
[53:25] and so our answer should be a scriptural
[53:28] answer ain't that right and so anyways
[53:31] uh we we're going to do that and and
[53:34] um so so uh what I'm going to do is
[53:39] um instead of me just reading them I'm
[53:41] going to have each of you to read them
[53:43] read scriptures and someone get uh if uh
[53:47] these boys are going to be here tonight
[53:49] going to get Levi and David to take a
[53:52] microphone uh uh to you all and that way
[53:56] uh we we can hear you when you're
[53:58] reading and then we can write them down
[54:01] and uh I I think it would be a good time
[54:04] so anyways Hosea the 12th chapter
[54:09] um
[54:13] and of course I didn't ask these boys
[54:14] but I just figured they'd want to
[54:17] so
[54:20] amen
[54:25] Hosea the 12th chapter and the 10th
[54:28] verse
[54:31] says I have also spoken by the prophets
[54:34] and I have multiplied visions and used
[54:39] similitudes by the ministry of the
[54:42] prophets
[54:44] let me read that again I have also
[54:46] spoken by the prophets and I have
[54:48] multiplied visions and used similitudes
[54:51] by the ministry of the prophets amen
[54:55] let's just bow our heads in a word of
[54:58] prayer father
[55:00] it is truly good to be in your house
[55:03] among Believers Lord and
[55:06] as we have
[55:07] dedicated this building many many years
[55:11] ago
[55:13] from those that have established this
[55:15] place to be a worship place of worship
[55:19] father we believe that you honor their
[55:23] prayers and their efforts and their
[55:26] labors
[55:27] Father Here We Stand today a new
[55:30] generation of new people
[55:32] Lord
[55:34] standing in this building and you have
[55:36] done many many things throughout the
[55:39] years in this place
[55:41] but Lord we're asking that you would do
[55:43] it again today
[55:45] father that you would speak through
[55:46] mortal lips Lord and help me to get
[55:49] myself out of the way
[55:51] and Lord that you would come and move
[55:54] among the people and father just give us
[55:57] the words to say and Lord let it be
[56:00] planted in every heart and you alone
[56:02] know the needs Lord and and what needs
[56:06] to be said and we pray that you would
[56:08] now take over and have the preeminence
[56:11] in this service in Jesus Christ's name
[56:15] amen
[56:17] you can be seated this evening or
[56:20] morning
[56:22] and this is of course I'm going to speak
[56:25] on ministry again and and uh it's a
[56:30] broad subject and so I I know that of
[56:35] course the Eternal Word is is always a
[56:38] broad subject on anything
[56:40] and so I I know I won't be able to cover
[56:43] it all and and dare not try
[56:47] uh
[56:49] uh
[56:50] but uh Ministry is is important because
[56:54] I I think that's where we find Our Place
[56:57] and and position is with when we when we
[57:02] do find our place in position we we
[57:05] realize that we're part of ministry
[57:08] and uh now I don't mean to be Elementary
[57:12] uh but I I do want to make it as simple
[57:16] as I know how so that everyone can get
[57:19] the idea of ministry
[57:21] and and we understand that no matter how
[57:24] simple you make it it takes God to to
[57:27] reveal it and uh but but we we certainly
[57:31] don't want to preach in mystery form and
[57:34] uh we we've called to preach the gospel
[57:37] and and and so I want to make it as
[57:40] clear as I can brother Branham said no
[57:43] matter how simple the gospel is if
[57:45] Christ is in it it'll draw people and uh
[57:49] so we we have talked about the purpose
[57:51] of God and um in the beginning again we
[57:56] talk about it that God dwelt Alone with
[57:58] his thoughts and and at that time he
[58:01] wasn't even God uh for God is an object
[58:05] of worship and so there was nothing
[58:08] there to worship him for he was God he
[58:12] or he dwelt alone and so we'd call him
[58:14] Elohim the self-existent one and uh he
[58:19] was the Eternal uh being and and uh and
[58:24] within him were attributes his
[58:27] attributes and his attributes the
[58:30] prophet would tell us were his thoughts
[58:32] and then then uh his thoughts became
[58:36] expressed into word for uh a word is an
[58:41] expression of thought it has to be a
[58:43] thought and then expressed into word
[58:46] and and so these attributes or thoughts
[58:49] of God uh the prophet would tell us that
[58:52] they're Eternal because God is eternal
[58:55] and anything a part of God is eternal
[58:57] and they are real they're real so as he
[59:02] would say that if you're you were in
[59:05] God's thinking if you were in God's
[59:07] thinking then you will always uh be
[59:11] there uh see if if he says if you've got
[59:15] eternal life then you are an expression
[59:18] or the attribute of his thought for this
[59:21] age as as we know that God allotted his
[59:25] word for each age each time segment and
[59:30] and within that time segment then there
[59:33] were thoughts of God that that were for
[59:35] that age and and there were people in
[59:39] that age that were the thoughts of God
[59:41] that God ordained them for that age to
[59:44] manifest himself or his word and so
[59:47] we're living in an age is the laodicean
[59:50] age it's it's the end of the ages it's
[59:53] the end of time it's the end of
[59:55] everything we're in the finale and so
[59:57] God had thoughts about this age and and
[1:00:00] he allotted his word and and it would be
[1:00:02] the completion of his vision for a bride
[1:00:05] and for a church and it would be a
[1:00:07] mighty Church it would be a dynamic
[1:00:09] church and all of these things things
[1:00:11] well then there were people that were in
[1:00:13] his thinking that he says they're going
[1:00:15] to be in this age and they're going to
[1:00:17] be part of this and and and so I believe
[1:00:20] that uh I'm a part of that I I'm not an
[1:00:24] accident uh that that just happened and
[1:00:27] I'm not just coasting alone I'm not by
[1:00:29] here by coincidence I was the Eternal
[1:00:31] thought of God and so uh uh therefore in
[1:00:35] God's mind you existed if you were in
[1:00:39] God's thoughts before the foundation
[1:00:41] world you existed in his mind before the
[1:00:44] foundation of the world and so God knew
[1:00:47] all about you knew about your life your
[1:00:49] character your nature he designed you to
[1:00:51] be what you are today and so it isn't
[1:00:54] what you think about yourself it isn't
[1:00:57] what somebody else thinks about you it's
[1:00:59] what God thinks about you that's that's
[1:01:02] the only thing that's Eternal and that's
[1:01:04] the only thing that's real amen is what
[1:01:07] God thinks about you and and so um yeah
[1:01:10] it was in God to be man uh uh and that's
[1:01:14] the reason Christ was the expressed
[1:01:17] image of God uh there and it was not
[1:01:21] just God to be man but it was in God to
[1:01:24] be father it was in God to be son it was
[1:01:27] in God attributes to be savior to be
[1:01:30] healer to be a family it was all in God
[1:01:34] and and and then in God's thoughts was a
[1:01:38] church and this church uh in God's mind
[1:01:41] would be without spot wrinkle or blemish
[1:01:44] it would be a powerful Church it would
[1:01:46] be a a super Church a super race it
[1:01:49] would be something that man could not uh
[1:01:52] uh imitate or anything like that and and
[1:01:55] so that it was all in God's thoughts and
[1:01:59] and then his thoughts become manifested
[1:02:02] ain't that right then they become the
[1:02:05] manifested uh manifestation of his
[1:02:08] thoughts then the prophet asked the
[1:02:10] thing of it is am I there
[1:02:12] or are you there amen that's the
[1:02:15] question right and that's what he puts
[1:02:17] before the church is are you there am I
[1:02:20] in there well then it in one place he
[1:02:22] said you Christians you Christians how
[1:02:24] many Christians do we have well then you
[1:02:27] Christians were in his thoughts uh
[1:02:30] before there was a world so you were his
[1:02:33] thoughts a Believer a genuine believer
[1:02:36] were his thoughts before the foundation
[1:02:39] of the world and and and not just just
[1:02:43] as a church member not just as a
[1:02:45] religious person but you were in his
[1:02:48] thoughts as Sons and Daughters of his
[1:02:52] sons and daughters of God and that's the
[1:02:55] way God's always thought you to be was
[1:02:57] sons and daughters and he wrote your
[1:03:00] name in that Lamb's Book of Life and
[1:03:03] every name in that book is is Redemptive
[1:03:06] it's it's it can be redeemed it's
[1:03:08] redeemable ain't that right amen a lot
[1:03:11] of religions people but they're not
[1:03:14] redeemable but them thoughts that were
[1:03:16] in the mind of God are redeemable amen
[1:03:20] and and that's what makes up the Church
[1:03:22] of the Living God that's what makes up
[1:03:24] the bride that's those that are going in
[1:03:26] the Rapture ain't that right and so we
[1:03:29] we find that these thoughts that God uh
[1:03:33] had in his mind they were Sons and
[1:03:35] Daughters God called them already he he
[1:03:39] predestinated them already he he
[1:03:42] justified them and he glorified them as
[1:03:46] we've talked about amen there there is
[1:03:48] no way that you can change that no man
[1:03:50] can change that no sin can change that
[1:03:53] the devil can't change that nothing can
[1:03:55] change it it's already put because they
[1:03:58] were it's that what that's the Eternal
[1:04:01] thought of God ain't that right amen
[1:04:03] that's the Eternal thought of God so God
[1:04:05] has already declared the end from the
[1:04:09] beginning ain't that right and so he's
[1:04:11] not doing everything by chance uh uh uh
[1:04:14] and and and so we we look and Jeremiah
[1:04:18] 29 11 we read it before but God says I
[1:04:21] know the thoughts that I think toward
[1:04:23] you why they were his thoughts amen not
[1:04:26] your thoughts his thoughts amen he's
[1:04:29] very acquainted with his thoughts so I
[1:04:31] know the thoughts that I have uh think
[1:04:33] towards you saith the Lord thoughts of
[1:04:36] Peace not of evil to give you an
[1:04:39] expected end ain't that right so now God
[1:04:42] made man a free moral agent amen uh so
[1:04:46] that he could make his own choices man
[1:04:49] is capable of loving of Desiring he has
[1:04:52] passions he's capable of of hearing two
[1:04:56] different reports two different things
[1:04:58] or more than than two and and he's able
[1:05:01] to choose between them two reports amen
[1:05:05] that's just the way God made him and and
[1:05:08] we we've talked about it uh uh these
[1:05:11] last services but uh we were all sold
[1:05:14] into sin because of Adam's transgression
[1:05:17] against the word of God but that never
[1:05:20] changed God's thoughts toward us
[1:05:23] ain't that right and and we talked about
[1:05:26] it brother Brown's told us that there's
[1:05:28] a permissive will of God and there's the
[1:05:30] perfect will of God well I will tell you
[1:05:32] the perfect will of God are the Eternal
[1:05:34] thoughts of God Amen what God allowed is
[1:05:37] what God permitted amen but he always
[1:05:40] makes it work out to his perfect will
[1:05:42] sin was not the perfect will of God it
[1:05:45] was the permissive will of God and and
[1:05:48] and we've gone our lives have been to
[1:05:50] the permissive will of God we were born
[1:05:52] in sin but yet we were sons of God in
[1:05:55] his mind we we we we uh we we might have
[1:05:59] been druggies we might have been
[1:06:00] alcoholics and we might have been
[1:06:01] prostitutes and we might have been evens
[1:06:04] just sitting in a religious form but
[1:06:07] that was the permissive will of God but
[1:06:09] but God's perfect will he never forgot
[1:06:12] them thoughts amen and that was to you
[1:06:15] to be a son and daughter of God Amen and
[1:06:18] to be an ex in the express image the be
[1:06:21] the manifestation of them thoughts same
[1:06:23] thing that ride so that's what you being
[1:06:25] a Christian is God never saved you
[1:06:27] filled you with the Holy Ghost just to
[1:06:29] go the trend of the world Amen there's
[1:06:32] many people setting religious claiming
[1:06:34] God and all that and and there's no
[1:06:36] power in their lives there's no
[1:06:38] Authority in their lives there's nothing
[1:06:40] a man and and all they're doing is
[1:06:42] expressing a theology they're expressing
[1:06:44] their denomination they're expressing
[1:06:46] amen some belief of man and some idea of
[1:06:50] man or of their own but then God would
[1:06:53] take a people a man that that were
[1:06:56] Eternal in his thoughts amen and he says
[1:06:59] I've come in this age to take you out of
[1:07:01] all of that to set you free that you
[1:07:04] could come back and manifest what I
[1:07:06] thought about you and I promise you
[1:07:08] God's thoughts about you isn't to be
[1:07:10] weak Church weak Beverly people be
[1:07:13] disoriented and not know what you
[1:07:15] believe and all confused and all messed
[1:07:17] up and all these things he's called you
[1:07:19] to be a powerful Church
[1:07:21] be powerful ain't that right and so so
[1:07:25] God knows God knows the thoughts that he
[1:07:28] has towards us and they are Eternal and
[1:07:31] they are real and and and that's why you
[1:07:33] cannot look at what you are today you
[1:07:36] you can't amen and and the message of
[1:07:38] the hour did not come to deal with you
[1:07:41] according to what you are in your first
[1:07:43] birth that come to deal with you
[1:07:45] according to the thoughts of God Amen
[1:07:48] that's right see so now when Adam sinned
[1:07:51] uh he hid himself and and it would seem
[1:07:56] uh that Adam would have run to God and
[1:07:59] and said man I've sinned I've done wrong
[1:08:01] please forgive me do something Amen to
[1:08:04] get me back but he didn't he ran from
[1:08:06] God and he hid and and uh uh but it was
[1:08:10] the father and father God a man that
[1:08:14] went through the garden seeking Adam
[1:08:16] Adam Adam where are you amen see because
[1:08:20] when he come down to meet was Adam that
[1:08:22] used to meet a man and commune together
[1:08:25] and fellowship together but somehow Adam
[1:08:27] missed the appointment you know uh he
[1:08:30] missed the appointment and and it was no
[1:08:33] longer uh uh uh a man coming to God he
[1:08:37] was hiding from God and the prophet says
[1:08:40] men always tried to justify themselves
[1:08:43] and he says man will try to hide behind
[1:08:46] someone instead of coming right out and
[1:08:49] saying what he is and confessing his
[1:08:51] sins before God he'll try to hide behind
[1:08:53] a stump amen see he tries to hide amen
[1:08:58] and he says the least sin the least of
[1:09:00] our sins should always be confessed no
[1:09:04] matter how it looks to you see it's sin
[1:09:08] in the sight of God ain't that right
[1:09:10] amen and and if we could understand that
[1:09:12] we'd be more careful how we act how we
[1:09:15] talk amen the directions we go and and
[1:09:18] and and the things we get involved in
[1:09:20] the things we look at that and the
[1:09:22] things we hear and all of these things
[1:09:24] not just any music uh is satisfactory to
[1:09:27] God Amen not just any life is right with
[1:09:30] God not just anything you hear and talk
[1:09:32] and about and listen to and and and
[1:09:35] watch and on all these things is is
[1:09:38] Godly and and no matter what it looks to
[1:09:41] you and me amen it's what God thinks
[1:09:44] about it ain't that right amen you see
[1:09:46] and so uh uh but but instead of coming
[1:09:49] to God and saying the old father forgive
[1:09:51] me I'm not wrong Adam come hiding amen
[1:09:55] and he hides you know and and of course
[1:09:57] he come up with his own religion ain't
[1:09:59] that right just like people today the
[1:10:01] prophet says coming up with their own
[1:10:02] religion they come up hiding and just
[1:10:05] worshiping under a religion of their own
[1:10:07] and don't think what God has to think
[1:10:09] about it amen see so it was God
[1:10:13] searching the father hunting his son and
[1:10:16] and the prophet put it this way God was
[1:10:19] grieving God was grieving for his Lost
[1:10:23] Boy amen and if we if you ever just
[1:10:27] think about it amen when the devil tries
[1:10:29] to tell you God doesn't love you think
[1:10:31] of what God has done amen and he done it
[1:10:34] by a grieving heart can you say man for
[1:10:37] God so loved the world John 3 16 he so
[1:10:41] loved the world a man that he gave his
[1:10:44] only begotten son that whosoever
[1:10:46] believeth in him should not perish but
[1:10:48] have ever let eternal life everlasting
[1:10:51] life amen and the prophet would tell us
[1:10:54] Jesus come to redeem those that was put
[1:10:58] on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:11:02] can you say amen I can say that again
[1:11:04] Jesus come not to redeem everybody
[1:11:07] because not everybody's redeemable not
[1:11:10] everybody was in his thinking it from
[1:11:12] the foundation of the world but he come
[1:11:14] to redeem those that was put on the
[1:11:17] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:11:19] foundation of the world it was in God's
[1:11:22] thoughts and that's what he come to
[1:11:24] redeem and them as soon as it strikes to
[1:11:28] them they see it because the life is in
[1:11:31] there ain't that right now this is where
[1:11:34] the true Ministry uh uh of God comes in
[1:11:38] amen see the focus of the true gospel is
[1:11:42] getting those who were the thoughts of
[1:11:45] God in the beginning amen that's what
[1:11:48] God's wanting do you realize the Rapture
[1:11:50] cannot happen until the last Soul comes
[1:11:52] in and when the lasso comes in I don't
[1:11:56] care how many well we read it the other
[1:11:58] day of of it could take God could Terry
[1:12:00] his coming for ten thousand years and
[1:12:03] and when that last Soul comes in that's
[1:12:05] it no one no more no less will get saved
[1:12:09] you'll preach preach preach preach and
[1:12:11] there's nothing else that can be saved
[1:12:13] because only those that were redeemable
[1:12:16] in his thought thinking a man will be
[1:12:19] the ones that were are redeemed that's
[1:12:21] what the Rapture is for it's not for
[1:12:23] everybody it's not for every religious
[1:12:26] man it's not for everybody that
[1:12:28] proclaims Christianity it's for those
[1:12:30] that God forethought in his mind now so
[1:12:34] we're looking at the message of the hour
[1:12:36] do you realize this message is a message
[1:12:39] of redemption that's right it's the
[1:12:42] message of redemption and and and I I'll
[1:12:46] just say it tell you this and and and
[1:12:48] you can agree or not but it's the only
[1:12:50] thing that's got blood in it for it's
[1:12:52] the bloody bleeding word that's what the
[1:12:54] prophet said it's the bloody bleeding
[1:12:57] word and and and and and so we we look
[1:13:00] at it amen you say well what about the
[1:13:02] others that's going to be saved well
[1:13:03] they're going to be judged by their
[1:13:04] works
[1:13:06] ain't that right even the foolish virgin
[1:13:08] the prophet says that she she will go
[1:13:11] through the tribulation because she
[1:13:12] failed to accept the atonement in its
[1:13:16] fullness she rejected the atonement in
[1:13:18] its fullness can you say Amen so we we
[1:13:21] find that this is the gospel a man to
[1:13:25] the elect and the only gospel that will
[1:13:27] be effective on the predestinated seed
[1:13:30] of God Amen Billy Graham had his part
[1:13:34] but he was there for Sodom amen and and
[1:13:36] Oral Roberts had his part but he was
[1:13:39] there for the Pentecostals and and and
[1:13:41] did all these other things we understand
[1:13:43] their message amen but then there was a
[1:13:45] message that was given Amen to that
[1:13:48] elected Abraham ain't that right now
[1:13:51] we've identified that this message of
[1:13:54] this day that was given to a prophet of
[1:13:56] God is the message for the elect of God
[1:13:59] can you say amen amen and it's the only
[1:14:03] thing that will be effective on the
[1:14:05] predest donated seed ain't that right
[1:14:08] you see that this it's not just about
[1:14:11] getting people to then Altar and it's
[1:14:13] not about just getting them to a
[1:14:15] confession ain't that right but let's go
[1:14:17] on to this that that the gospel is about
[1:14:20] the ripening and the maturing of that
[1:14:24] predestinated seed do you believe that
[1:14:27] amen you you see you you say well well
[1:14:30] we're not getting a lot of people saved
[1:14:32] and a lot of people ain't coming in so
[1:14:33] we might be doing something wrong but
[1:14:35] but what we don't understand now now I
[1:14:38] am I am for getting people in I am for
[1:14:41] getting out and getting saved and we
[1:14:43] want people saved ain't that right but I
[1:14:45] ain't going to get them saved according
[1:14:47] to a Billy Graham message I'm not going
[1:14:49] to get them saved according to an Oral
[1:14:51] Roberts message I'm not going to get
[1:14:53] them saved to a bat according to a
[1:14:55] Baptist uh ideology of what salvation is
[1:14:58] there is a true salvation and that's the
[1:15:01] message of the hour amen now now you
[1:15:04] know uh uh because we found and the
[1:15:06] prophet said that Billy Graham was
[1:15:08] getting people to confession a man but
[1:15:11] he told them told us that they weren't
[1:15:13] really getting getting a true birth amen
[1:15:15] they were coming up yet confessing they
[1:15:17] were doing their little thing amen but
[1:15:19] see the Bible says that God the
[1:15:22] foundation of God stand ashore the Lord
[1:15:25] knoweth them that are his can you say
[1:15:29] amen and he sent a message in this hour
[1:15:32] to get those that are his ain't that
[1:15:35] right so but it's not just about going
[1:15:39] out and and and and and we we made it uh
[1:15:42] the World Church world has made it all
[1:15:44] about getting souls in souls and souls
[1:15:46] in you know brother Brown said they had
[1:15:48] that slogan I think it was the Baptist
[1:15:49] that had the slogan a million more and
[1:15:51] 44. you know and it's got to the point
[1:15:54] so so so so so amen that that they've
[1:15:57] left off the true word of God Amen
[1:16:00] because it offends too many people so
[1:16:02] we'll give them Donuts we'll give them
[1:16:03] bicycle giveaways we'll have a program
[1:16:05] we we get a professional choir we get
[1:16:07] professional preachers we get
[1:16:09] professional musicians we get it's
[1:16:11] almost like a concert anymore that
[1:16:13] you're coming to it's more just like a
[1:16:15] club it's it's something fantastic so we
[1:16:18] can draw Souls amen and and all their
[1:16:21] effort is in vain you understand what
[1:16:23] I'm saying that's right so we may not be
[1:16:26] seeing a lot of soul saved in in the
[1:16:29] sense of people coming off the streets
[1:16:31] coming in but still this message is
[1:16:34] doing something amen it's ripening it's
[1:16:38] maturing the predestinated sea do you
[1:16:42] believe that amen for that's what the
[1:16:44] prophet said amen that we're laying
[1:16:46] ripening in the pre in the presence of
[1:16:49] the son ain't that right amen yes sir so
[1:16:52] every day that you come to church and
[1:16:55] and you're playing them tapes and you're
[1:16:56] you're whatever you should be ripening
[1:16:59] you should be coming up in the full
[1:17:01] stature of Jesus Christ amen you should
[1:17:04] be getting away from the world it should
[1:17:05] be cutting things off to where you just
[1:17:08] don't want that anymore you don't desire
[1:17:09] that why yet it's a Ministry to bring
[1:17:13] you up into the full stature of Jesus
[1:17:16] Christ amen that's what this message is
[1:17:19] about there is no other message that can
[1:17:21] mature this bride there that's why the
[1:17:23] message is so important in this day amen
[1:17:26] and that's why you've got to proclaim
[1:17:28] the message of the hour not only to a
[1:17:31] preacher amen preaching behind the
[1:17:33] pulpit amen but you you you parents
[1:17:36] preaching it to your children amen don't
[1:17:38] tell them about Davy Crockett and the
[1:17:40] lies and and this this is where the
[1:17:42] Prophet don't get them all messed up in
[1:17:44] Disney don't get them all messed up in
[1:17:46] the fairy tales amen tell them about
[1:17:48] Jesus Christ of what God has done in
[1:17:51] this age
[1:17:52] it'll mature them it'll it'll it'll
[1:17:54] mature you understand amen because
[1:17:56] there's a it's not it's not natural age
[1:17:59] that matures amen we're not talking
[1:18:01] about that we're talking about maturing
[1:18:03] and ripening in the presence of the so
[1:18:05] in
[1:18:06] ain't that right amen so they could be
[1:18:09] they could be 10 years old and ripening
[1:18:11] amen and knowing and ripening more than
[1:18:14] adults can
[1:18:17] yes sir they're going to be part of this
[1:18:20] Brad they're they're going to be part of
[1:18:21] this this bright revival can you say man
[1:18:24] now so so uh uh now brother Brown says
[1:18:28] when when he predestinates anything to
[1:18:31] happen and says it will happen he knows
[1:18:34] that seed will be there just at that
[1:18:37] time God knows it amen so we're not
[1:18:39] wasting our time amen God knows God
[1:18:43] knows what seed he planted in this age I
[1:18:47] I don't believe that we're here at in
[1:18:49] Blacksburg at Faith Tabernacle wasting
[1:18:52] our time amen God knows who's the seed
[1:18:55] that he planted and he's put us here
[1:18:57] Amen to reach out that seed
[1:19:00] amen and she's going to be there do you
[1:19:02] believe that
[1:19:03] she's going to be there there's going to
[1:19:05] be a rapture and to think of it if
[1:19:08] there's no predestinated seed there
[1:19:09] would not be a Rapture in this age he
[1:19:12] would have brought the Rapture when
[1:19:13] there was other seed amen but there is a
[1:19:15] predestinated seed and they were
[1:19:17] predestinated for a Rapture they were
[1:19:20] predestinated for a body change ain't
[1:19:22] that right God predestinated a church to
[1:19:26] be there without spot or blemish the
[1:19:28] prophet said now you think of that it's
[1:19:31] in this age that God would provide a
[1:19:34] message amen so she wouldn't be spotless
[1:19:37] or that she would be spotless and
[1:19:39] without blemish and have no wrinkles
[1:19:41] it's in this age amen that God would
[1:19:43] have Supply provide such a message ain't
[1:19:47] that right amen see so now brother Brahm
[1:19:51] said he predestinates it by his
[1:19:52] foreknowledge and there's nothing going
[1:19:54] to stop it
[1:19:55] ain't that right so even though we did
[1:19:58] not come into this world reflecting
[1:20:00] God's thoughts God's determined that we
[1:20:03] will
[1:20:03] for his determined his thoughts are his
[1:20:06] word his word is his thought and he said
[1:20:08] his word will come to pass it's going to
[1:20:11] come to pass so everyone again a man
[1:20:15] that were in God's thinking at the
[1:20:17] beginning has a predestinated seed in
[1:20:20] them
[1:20:22] that's right got a predestinated seed
[1:20:25] within you and within that seed within
[1:20:28] that seed is everything that God thought
[1:20:30] this church to be
[1:20:32] everything that that God thought of you
[1:20:35] everything God taught us to be is in the
[1:20:37] seat already ain't that right you sinner
[1:20:40] you drinking you're doping you whatever
[1:20:42] you was doing a man Corrals and all that
[1:20:45] but if there was a predestinated seed
[1:20:47] that's everything that holds all God's
[1:20:50] thoughts concerning you is in that seed
[1:20:52] ain't that right it's like the apple
[1:20:54] seed the apples you really realize that
[1:20:57] every Apple that that tiny little old
[1:21:00] seed will produce years and years and
[1:21:03] years and years amen is already in the
[1:21:05] seed it's there the life is there and
[1:21:09] God predestinated how many apples would
[1:21:11] be in that seed ain't that right it may
[1:21:14] bring forth for 20 years 30 years and
[1:21:18] yet God had already put every Apple
[1:21:20] predestinated every Apple to be in that
[1:21:23] seed and knows the number of apples that
[1:21:25] that seed will will have ain't that
[1:21:27] right well if he will take notice about
[1:21:29] a little old apple seed that we look and
[1:21:31] say well it's it's you don't get apples
[1:21:33] or we need to cut that thing down or we
[1:21:35] need to do this this this that God takes
[1:21:37] care he knows he understands you
[1:21:40] understand well if he does it about a
[1:21:42] little seed what he does he do about his
[1:21:43] church what does he do about his own
[1:21:46] thinking ain't that right amen so he he
[1:21:49] put you in this world Amen uh uh uh uh
[1:21:54] and and put a predestinated seed within
[1:21:56] you amen all of his thoughts amen so now
[1:22:00] but but with that apple seed it takes
[1:22:03] the dirt
[1:22:04] everybody say it takes the dirt takes
[1:22:06] the water takes the sunshine takes the
[1:22:10] right atmosphere
[1:22:11] for that seed to manifest what's in it
[1:22:13] do you believe it see so everything the
[1:22:17] dirt the sunshine the rain the the
[1:22:19] moisture all the the right atmosphere
[1:22:21] and and all of these things work
[1:22:23] together they work together a man uh uh
[1:22:27] uh to to to to so that that seed can
[1:22:30] bring forth of its kind see it's the
[1:22:33] same goes a man for all that are part of
[1:22:36] the ministry of God Amen see there we
[1:22:40] talked about there's the ministry of
[1:22:41] angels there's the ministry of the Holy
[1:22:43] Spirit and and we've we've gone into
[1:22:46] that there is the ministry of the
[1:22:48] prophets there is the ministry of the
[1:22:50] fivefold amen the Evangelist Pastor
[1:22:53] teacher missionary prophet and there
[1:22:56] there's the ministry of the saints that
[1:22:59] Paul talks about it it's it's all it's
[1:23:01] same Ministry it's God's ministry right
[1:23:04] there's other Ministries that ain't part
[1:23:06] of God's Ministry but I'm talking about
[1:23:07] God's Ministry amen and all of these and
[1:23:11] and there's the faithful Ministry the
[1:23:13] ministry of the prophet it's the
[1:23:14] ministry of the Holy Spirit the ministry
[1:23:16] of Angels the ministry of the Saints and
[1:23:18] they all work together for the same
[1:23:20] purpose ain't that right in the ministry
[1:23:23] of the Saints there are singers there's
[1:23:25] musicians there's prophesires there's
[1:23:27] they're speaking in the tongues there's
[1:23:29] interpretation of tongues there's
[1:23:31] visions and dreams there's Gifts of
[1:23:33] healing and I I'll even say it this way
[1:23:35] there's fathers and mothers within the
[1:23:39] ministry of the Saints can you say man
[1:23:42] how we need Godly men and women my Godly
[1:23:45] fathers and Godly mothers and and and
[1:23:47] there's testifiers those that witness
[1:23:50] and and these things and within the
[1:23:53] ministry of the Saints there's helps and
[1:23:55] there's governments such as trustees and
[1:23:57] deacons and Treasurer and the janitor
[1:23:59] and and the pillars of the church and
[1:24:01] and you've got all of these things
[1:24:03] within the ministry
[1:24:06] and and and notice it all works together
[1:24:11] it all works together to make sure that
[1:24:14] that predestinated seed comes to life
[1:24:17] and grows
[1:24:20] ain't that right
[1:24:22] now Ephesians 4 11 it says and he gave
[1:24:26] some Apostles some prophets some
[1:24:27] evangelists some pastors and teachers
[1:24:30] why does he give them for the perfecting
[1:24:32] of the Saints
[1:24:33] for the work of the ministry and
[1:24:36] remember the perfecting of the Saints is
[1:24:38] not religion
[1:24:39] not religious people
[1:24:41] amen but for those thoughts that elected
[1:24:44] seed that God had in his thinking before
[1:24:46] the foundation of the world for the
[1:24:49] perfecting of that seed for the work of
[1:24:52] the ministry for the edifying of the
[1:24:54] body of Christ which is the seed ain't
[1:24:57] that right amen until we all come in the
[1:25:00] unity of the faith and of the knowledge
[1:25:02] of the Son of God unto a perfect man
[1:25:04] unto the measure of a stature of the
[1:25:07] fullness of Christ you realize that only
[1:25:10] ones that will come to a perfect man and
[1:25:12] the fullness and the stature of Jesus
[1:25:13] Christ is that elect that was eternal in
[1:25:17] God's mind before the foundation of the
[1:25:19] world can you say amen and that's our
[1:25:21] whole goal is to bring that men that
[1:25:24] that that elect to a perfection
[1:25:29] that we hence forth be no more children
[1:25:31] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[1:25:34] every wind of Doctrine by the Slate of
[1:25:36] men and the cunning craftiness whereby
[1:25:38] they lie and wait to deceive but
[1:25:41] speaking the truth in love may grow up
[1:25:43] into him
[1:25:45] ain't that right grow up into him and
[1:25:48] that's that's the whole point of
[1:25:49] ministry is that they could grow up into
[1:25:52] him in All everybody say all all things
[1:25:57] amen see which is the head even Christ
[1:26:00] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[1:26:04] together and compacted by that which
[1:26:06] supply of uh which every joint supply of
[1:26:09] according to the effectual working in
[1:26:11] the measure of every part makeeth the
[1:26:14] increase of the body unto the edifying
[1:26:16] of itself in love
[1:26:18] now the 29th verse of the same chapter
[1:26:22] it says let no corruption uh
[1:26:24] communication proceed out of your mouth
[1:26:26] but that which is good everybody say
[1:26:28] that which is good to the use of
[1:26:31] edifying
[1:26:33] do the use of edifying this isn't just
[1:26:37] making people feel good
[1:26:39] you can go to you can go to that that
[1:26:41] Minister church at the word in Texas
[1:26:43] where he just smiles and everybody feels
[1:26:46] good when they leave
[1:26:48] that's not what edifying is
[1:26:51] talking about business the church and
[1:26:53] how you how you how you you know how you
[1:26:55] do your business and how you do this and
[1:26:58] positive thinking and and all that
[1:26:59] that's not it that's not what Paul is
[1:27:01] saying about edifying we already talked
[1:27:03] I mean Pete Paul has already laid it
[1:27:06] down in uh to us it's it's an edifying
[1:27:08] and we'll get here in just a minute but
[1:27:10] it says but that which is good to the
[1:27:12] use of edifying that it may Minister
[1:27:15] Grace unto the hearer
[1:27:18] ain't that right well uh uh so now now
[1:27:22] he uses this word edifying uh three
[1:27:25] times in this in this chapter I believe
[1:27:28] and and the word edifying is to form to
[1:27:32] build establish
[1:27:35] ain't that right so when we're coming to
[1:27:38] edify I mean that that's that's the
[1:27:41] whole point of ministry Amen to edify to
[1:27:43] form to build to establish now now let's
[1:27:47] look at what this edifying is in first
[1:27:49] Timothy 1 4 Paul tells us what kind of
[1:27:52] edifying it should be neither give he to
[1:27:55] fables that's not edifying
[1:27:59] an endless genealogies fables are lies
[1:28:04] fables is something that ain't truth
[1:28:07] it can be part truth but it's not all
[1:28:09] truth
[1:28:10] remember the Fable was
[1:28:12] Satan presented a fable to Eve
[1:28:16] told all the truth about one word
[1:28:19] so that's what can make a fable just
[1:28:20] missing one word ain't that right
[1:28:22] misinterpreting and and misconstruing
[1:28:25] again and all of these things see
[1:28:27] neither give he to fables and endless
[1:28:30] genealogy which minister questions
[1:28:34] rather than Godly edifying which is in
[1:28:40] faith
[1:28:41] so do
[1:28:42] can you say Amen so so notice The Godly
[1:28:46] edifying witches in faith or the faith
[1:28:49] that's the only edifying that that we as
[1:28:52] as the ministry amen uh uh uh uh can do
[1:28:57] that's the only edifying that God has
[1:28:58] called us for is The Godly edifying in
[1:29:02] the faith
[1:29:03] can you say amen and according to the
[1:29:06] Bible there's only one faith
[1:29:09] that was the face of the Apostles it
[1:29:13] ain't the faith of the Catholics it
[1:29:14] ain't the faith of the Baptist we've got
[1:29:16] all kinds of faiths today but back in
[1:29:19] the original there was only one faith
[1:29:21] that Paul was talking about
[1:29:23] and when God places a person in the
[1:29:25] ministry that Ministry is for Godly
[1:29:28] edification which is in the faith
[1:29:33] amen ain't that right
[1:29:35] in the last stage there's only one
[1:29:37] message
[1:29:38] that deals with the faith
[1:29:42] and that's the message of the hour that
[1:29:44] was brought to us by Mount the prophet
[1:29:46] of Malachi 4.
[1:29:48] and you say amen and everyone under this
[1:29:51] ministry of of Malachi 4 is to proclaim
[1:29:55] the faith edify in the faith can you say
[1:29:58] Amen are there other Ministries don't
[1:30:01] count just hate to say it other
[1:30:03] Ministries ain't bringing them into a
[1:30:05] Rapture ain't bringing them into the
[1:30:07] perfect thought of God Amen but this
[1:30:09] message is to restore us back to the
[1:30:12] faith
[1:30:13] ain't that right see so that that that's
[1:30:17] the message of the hour is to restore
[1:30:19] back amen not not to to what somebody
[1:30:22] else said or thought but back to the
[1:30:25] faith so this message is the only thing
[1:30:28] that meets the qualification of what
[1:30:31] Paul was talking about concerning Godly
[1:30:34] edification which is in the faith you
[1:30:37] don't need to read books of psychology
[1:30:39] to better it to be better edified
[1:30:43] amen you don't need a license to be a
[1:30:46] professional counselor to edify people
[1:30:50] you you don't need to read books on how
[1:30:52] to be a better wife or to be a better
[1:30:54] husband to be better how Godly edified
[1:30:59] amen well if your message people you can
[1:31:03] say Amen to that
[1:31:04] you don't need uh Dr Dobson
[1:31:07] you don't need whatever
[1:31:10] I tell you a lot of these that are right
[1:31:12] these books are unregenerated
[1:31:14] foolish virgin maybe I don't care and
[1:31:17] whatever it ain't to the bride
[1:31:19] as much as this bride this message ain't
[1:31:21] to the foolish virgin it ain't to anyone
[1:31:24] else it's to the bride
[1:31:25] can you say Amen so you don't need to
[1:31:28] you don't need books to tell you how to
[1:31:30] be a better parent
[1:31:31] you can't be Godly edified in the Faith
[1:31:34] by them things
[1:31:38] you don't need books on how to deal with
[1:31:41] your child
[1:31:43] can you say Amen you you don't need that
[1:31:46] the prophet of the hour has told us how
[1:31:49] to do it it teaches you how to be a
[1:31:51] better parent how's to teach you how to
[1:31:53] deal with your child how it teaches you
[1:31:55] how to be uh how to handle yourself in
[1:31:57] the church how a minister should handle
[1:31:59] themselves the deacons should handle
[1:32:00] themselves home should be everything
[1:32:03] parents wives every Everything can you
[1:32:05] say Amen Godly edification which is in
[1:32:09] the faith comes by the message and the
[1:32:12] message alone
[1:32:14] ain't that right
[1:32:16] so now God has a ministry that's going
[1:32:19] to Proclaim this message
[1:32:22] and we as Ministers of this message are
[1:32:24] not to minister questions
[1:32:26] and I'm going to say it this way parents
[1:32:28] are not to minister questions any any
[1:32:31] part of the ministry that is part of the
[1:32:35] the the the the message of the hour
[1:32:37] should not Minister questions
[1:32:42] hello
[1:32:43] now you may have questions on how to be
[1:32:46] whatever
[1:32:47] get to the message you'll find answers
[1:32:52] and you say man
[1:32:53] so now I I'm I'm not saying that any of
[1:32:56] us are ministering questions here in the
[1:32:58] church I'm just establishing what this
[1:33:01] message is about
[1:33:02] and what Ministry is about
[1:33:05] we're not to minister questions we're
[1:33:07] not to bring questions as much as we are
[1:33:09] to give the answers why we've got the
[1:33:13] answers the book has been opened
[1:33:17] can you say amen and it's not to the
[1:33:19] educated that can understand these
[1:33:21] Mysteries amen the most uneducated the
[1:33:24] most dumbest individual can understand
[1:33:26] the mystery of this book when the Holy
[1:33:29] Ghost comes in
[1:33:30] and begins to reveal it
[1:33:33] can you say Amen
[1:33:35] so see anyone who ministers questions do
[1:33:38] so because they don't believe the
[1:33:40] message that God has seen or they don't
[1:33:42] understand
[1:33:43] so when they try to tell us that well
[1:33:45] that's a prophet was opinion and he's
[1:33:47] this and he's that what you do in your
[1:33:49] ministering questions
[1:33:53] we understand it ain't a no-brainer that
[1:33:55] brother Brown was a man
[1:33:58] the point is is the Holy Ghost God
[1:34:01] himself had his picture taken with that
[1:34:03] man to let you know don't you question
[1:34:05] it
[1:34:06] this message is an authority
[1:34:08] it's the headship
[1:34:11] not brother Adam the message
[1:34:14] and you say Amen so so we find that that
[1:34:18] that the ministry works the ministry of
[1:34:22] God works for the edification of the
[1:34:26] Saints why to bring them thoughts of God
[1:34:29] to what God thought them to be in the
[1:34:32] original
[1:34:33] God said let there be light God said
[1:34:35] Remember the world was without form it
[1:34:38] was dark it was it was chaotic and yet
[1:34:42] God would speak and the Bible says that
[1:34:45] the spirit of the Lord moved upon the
[1:34:48] face of the deep
[1:34:49] what was it it was there as God's agent
[1:34:53] God's Ministry to bring what God thought
[1:34:56] to pass what God Said to pass
[1:35:00] can you say Amen
[1:35:01] well I believe there's thoughts of God
[1:35:03] that still come to pass in this age
[1:35:07] you believe it
[1:35:09] and and and to think we ought to feel
[1:35:11] honored that God did not leave his
[1:35:14] thoughts to to some denomination
[1:35:18] they ain't got the ability to handle it
[1:35:22] they're too busy preaching Creeds and
[1:35:24] dogmas
[1:35:26] but he's still got a People
[1:35:28] that he's he's reserved for his ministry
[1:35:32] now notice the ministry of God works for
[1:35:36] the edifying of the Saints
[1:35:37] second Corinthians 12 and and look look
[1:35:41] at the desire the burden of Paul
[1:35:44] and and and and I believe that's for
[1:35:47] everyone that is is
[1:35:49] working in Ministry God's Ministry
[1:35:53] behold the third time is second
[1:35:56] Corinthians 12 14 behold the third time
[1:35:58] I'm ready to come to you and I will not
[1:36:00] be burdisome to you for I seek not yours
[1:36:03] but you
[1:36:06] how different that is from today's
[1:36:09] program
[1:36:11] they want your money
[1:36:13] they want everything that you got
[1:36:16] but they ain't interested in you
[1:36:18] the cowards behind the pulpit they
[1:36:20] watered down this this gospel
[1:36:22] afraid to tell it just like it is
[1:36:25] because they're more interested in
[1:36:26] numbers
[1:36:27] and then they say they're getting so
[1:36:29] saved
[1:36:33] ain't that right
[1:36:34] but in all reality they're interested in
[1:36:37] their program
[1:36:39] they're interested in what they're
[1:36:40] accomplishing
[1:36:42] so they come up with this well God look
[1:36:44] at me I've got a million here presented
[1:36:46] to you and yet they're bobbed hair
[1:36:49] painted up Jezebels
[1:36:52] there ain't a gospel one that that they
[1:36:55] preached that that that delivered them
[1:36:57] people
[1:36:59] they're not reflecting the Eternal
[1:37:01] thoughts of God they're Bound by their
[1:37:03] movies they're Bound by this and they're
[1:37:05] Bound by Hollywood they're Bound By The
[1:37:07] Rock and Roll they're Bound by all kinds
[1:37:09] of spirits
[1:37:11] Bound by the spirit of sports they're
[1:37:13] Bound by the spirit of fashion
[1:37:17] can you say Amen but Paul amen he would
[1:37:21] say I'm not seeking yours I'm seeking
[1:37:24] you
[1:37:26] for the children ought not to lay up for
[1:37:29] the parents but the parents for the
[1:37:30] children
[1:37:31] notice 15th verse and I will very gladly
[1:37:34] spend and be spent for you
[1:37:37] though the more abundantly I love you
[1:37:40] the less I Be Loved
[1:37:44] why because he wouldn't compromise on
[1:37:46] the gospel
[1:37:48] ain't that right but be it so I did not
[1:37:51] burden you nevertheless being crafty I
[1:37:55] caught you with guile
[1:37:57] see did I make Gain of you by any of
[1:38:01] them whom I whom I sent unto you I
[1:38:04] desire Titus with him and with him I
[1:38:06] sent a brother see did Titus make Gain
[1:38:09] of you walk we not in the same Spirit
[1:38:11] what we not in the same steps again
[1:38:15] think ye that we excuse ourselves unto
[1:38:17] you we speak before God in Christ but we
[1:38:21] do all things dearly beloved for your
[1:38:24] edifying
[1:38:27] amen
[1:38:28] can you say man
[1:38:31] so because the ministry is given for the
[1:38:34] edification of the church is why Paul
[1:38:37] would set the church in order
[1:38:40] now I'm going to read a chapter it's
[1:38:43] going to be lengthy but you follow me
[1:38:45] First Corinthians the 14th chapter
[1:38:49] he in setting the church order he in
[1:38:52] order he specifically deals with the the
[1:38:55] gift of tongues and the interpretation
[1:38:57] of tongues
[1:38:59] and notice now
[1:39:02] First Corinthians 14 1 follow after
[1:39:04] charity and desire spiritual gifts but
[1:39:07] rather that you may prophesy for he that
[1:39:09] speaketh in an unknown tongue speak of
[1:39:11] not unto men but unto God for no man
[1:39:15] understandeth him how be it in the
[1:39:17] spirit he speaketh what
[1:39:19] Mysteries
[1:39:21] but he he that prophesies speak of Unto
[1:39:23] men to edification and exhortation and
[1:39:26] to comfort
[1:39:27] but he that speaketh in an unknown
[1:39:30] tongue edifyeth who
[1:39:33] himself
[1:39:35] but he that prophesies edifyeth the
[1:39:38] church
[1:39:39] I would that you all spoke with tongues
[1:39:41] but rather uh uh that you prophesied for
[1:39:44] greater is he that prophesies than he
[1:39:47] that speaks with tongues except he
[1:39:49] interpret that the church everybody say
[1:39:51] the church may receive edification
[1:39:55] ain't that right
[1:39:56] so so okay it's good to speak in tongues
[1:39:59] amen we we're not against tongues but
[1:40:02] just to speak in tongues it's not for
[1:40:04] the education of the church
[1:40:07] and you say amen amen you're only
[1:40:10] serving yourself you're only edifying
[1:40:12] yourself
[1:40:12] that's all it it comes to ain't that
[1:40:15] right but there's got to be a Ministry
[1:40:17] for the edification of the Saints
[1:40:20] ain't that right so six verse now
[1:40:22] Brethren if I come into you speak with
[1:40:24] tongues what shall I profit you
[1:40:30] now this is you know and and so I'm
[1:40:32] gonna go on so this this is why
[1:40:34] Pentecostals got themselves in trouble
[1:40:37] and here's why the prophet really got
[1:40:38] only them Pentecostals because they
[1:40:41] thought tongues were better than the
[1:40:42] preaching
[1:40:43] so here's a preacher under the anointing
[1:40:46] a prophet of God under the anointing
[1:40:47] preaching edifying the church and
[1:40:50] someone would raise up start speaking in
[1:40:51] tongues right in the middle of it all
[1:40:54] all right
[1:40:56] sir ain't that right
[1:40:57] now that's nonsense and anyone in the
[1:41:00] message that does that is wrong
[1:41:03] so now Brethren if I come to you
[1:41:05] speaking with tongues what shall I
[1:41:07] profit you except I shall speak to you
[1:41:09] either by Revelation or by knowledge or
[1:41:12] by prophesying or by Doctrine
[1:41:15] that's the edification even even things
[1:41:18] without Life Giving sound whether pipe
[1:41:23] or harp except they give a distinction
[1:41:25] in the sounds how shall it be known what
[1:41:27] is piped in or heart
[1:41:30] for if the trumpet give an uncertain
[1:41:31] sound who shall prepare himself to the
[1:41:34] battle now you say well we don't see a
[1:41:36] lot of those things that we used to see
[1:41:38] you know why it's not that the prophet
[1:41:41] done away with it
[1:41:43] he put it in its per in its it's it's
[1:41:45] it's uh uh order
[1:41:49] he put it in in its right perspective
[1:41:52] to get away from all this uncertain
[1:41:55] sound
[1:41:57] get it ain't time for uncertain sounds
[1:42:01] we ain't got time for it
[1:42:04] we want to be edified Amen to where we
[1:42:07] can be ready for a rapture
[1:42:11] ain't that right
[1:42:14] so
[1:42:15] he says see if a trumpet gives an
[1:42:18] uncertain sound who shall prepare
[1:42:19] himself to the battle so likewise ye
[1:42:21] except you utter by the Tongue words
[1:42:24] easy to be understood how shall it be
[1:42:27] known what is spoken now and and the
[1:42:29] prophet we can go on and I'm not I'm not
[1:42:31] going to get into all of it like we
[1:42:33] could and probably should sometime but
[1:42:35] the prophet already told us you know
[1:42:37] when someone's interpreting don't quote
[1:42:39] scriptures
[1:42:40] don't don't do it repetitious
[1:42:42] [Music]
[1:42:44] anyone can do that but just read the
[1:42:47] Bible
[1:42:49] it'll tell you that you don't need to
[1:42:51] disrupt a service for that
[1:42:56] ain't that Ryan
[1:42:58] see but a lot of it they just won their
[1:43:00] own little Ministry shown
[1:43:05] so except you utter my tongue
[1:43:09] by the Tongue words easy to be
[1:43:11] understood how shall it be known what is
[1:43:13] spoken for you shall speak into the air
[1:43:16] there are it may be so many kinds of
[1:43:19] voices in the world and none of them is
[1:43:22] without signification
[1:43:24] therefore if I know not the meaning of
[1:43:27] The Voice
[1:43:28] I shall be unto him that speaketh a
[1:43:31] barbarian and he that speaketh shall be
[1:43:34] a barbarian unto me
[1:43:36] even so ye for as much as you are
[1:43:39] zealous of spiritual gifts seek that you
[1:43:42] may excel to the edifying of the church
[1:43:48] ain't that right wherefore let him that
[1:43:50] speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that
[1:43:53] he may interpret for if he pray in an
[1:43:55] unknown tongue my spirit prayeth but my
[1:43:57] understanding is unfruitful
[1:44:00] what is a thin I will pray with the
[1:44:03] spirit I will pray with the
[1:44:05] understanding also I will sing with the
[1:44:07] spirit and I will sing with the
[1:44:09] understanding also
[1:44:10] ain't that right
[1:44:13] we could go in that too but we'll wait
[1:44:16] else when thou shalt bless with the
[1:44:18] spirit how shall he that occupyeth the
[1:44:21] room of the unlearned say Amen at the
[1:44:23] giving of things
[1:44:24] seeing he understandeth not what thou
[1:44:26] sayest for thou verily give us things
[1:44:30] well but the other is not edifying you
[1:44:33] understand what I'm saying I thank my
[1:44:35] God I speak with tongues more than you
[1:44:37] all
[1:44:37] see yet in the church I had rather speak
[1:44:40] five words
[1:44:42] with understanding that by my voice I
[1:44:45] might teach others also
[1:44:48] then ten thousand words in an unknown
[1:44:50] tongue
[1:44:51] then you say amen and I say to you
[1:44:54] tonight or this morning anyone that
[1:44:56] preaches outside this message is just
[1:44:58] unknown tongues
[1:45:00] it's a mess of confusion
[1:45:04] I'd rather someone preach the message of
[1:45:06] the hour that has an understanding of
[1:45:08] this Bible
[1:45:12] then you say Amen thank God for the
[1:45:14] ministry of the of the message
[1:45:17] amen so brethren
[1:45:20] be not children in understanding
[1:45:23] albeit in Malice be children but in
[1:45:26] understanding be men
[1:45:28] in the law it is written with men and of
[1:45:32] other tongues and other lips will I
[1:45:34] speak unto this people and yet for all
[1:45:36] that will they not hear me saith the
[1:45:39] Lord
[1:45:40] say that again with men of other tongues
[1:45:42] and other lips will I speak unto this
[1:45:43] people yet for all that will not hear
[1:45:46] they uh will they not hear me saith the
[1:45:48] Lord wherefore tongues are for a sign
[1:45:51] not to them that believe but to them
[1:45:53] that believe not but prophesying service
[1:45:55] not for them that believe not but for
[1:45:58] them which believe
[1:45:59] ain't that right if therefore the whole
[1:46:02] church be come together in one place and
[1:46:04] all speak with tongues and they're
[1:46:06] coming those that are unlearned or
[1:46:08] unbelievers will they not say that you
[1:46:10] are mad
[1:46:11] if all prophesy or but if all prophesy
[1:46:14] and there come in one that believeth not
[1:46:16] or un uh one unlearned he is convinced
[1:46:20] of all he is judged of all and thus are
[1:46:22] the secrets of his heart made manifest
[1:46:25] and so falling down on his face now
[1:46:28] brother bran tells us that's exactly
[1:46:30] what it should be is the secrets of the
[1:46:33] heart made manifest
[1:46:37] not just preaching a sermon
[1:46:40] man yeah
[1:46:43] so falling down on his face he will
[1:46:46] worship God and report that God is in
[1:46:48] you of a truth
[1:46:50] how is it then Brethren when you come
[1:46:52] together every one of you hath the psalm
[1:46:54] at the doctrine at the tongue at the
[1:46:56] Revelation hath an interpretation let
[1:46:58] everybody say it with me let all things
[1:47:02] be done unto edifying
[1:47:07] If any man speaking an unknown tongue
[1:47:09] Let It Be everybody say Let It Be by two
[1:47:13] or at the most by three Witnesses right
[1:47:17] now put that Witnesses because the
[1:47:18] prophet said that's what it should be by
[1:47:22] and that by course and let one interpret
[1:47:26] but if there be no interpreter
[1:47:28] let him keep silence in the church and
[1:47:32] let him speak unto himself and and to
[1:47:34] God
[1:47:35] let the prophet speak two or three and
[1:47:37] let the other judge if any man be
[1:47:40] revealed or if anything be revealed to
[1:47:42] another that sent us by let the first
[1:47:44] hold his peace for ye may all prophesy
[1:47:48] one by one that all may learn and all
[1:47:50] may be comforted and the spirits of the
[1:47:53] prophets are subject to the prophets
[1:47:55] for God is not the author of confusion
[1:47:57] but a peace as in all the churches of
[1:48:00] the Saints ain't that right so then we
[1:48:04] find that the working of the ministry is
[1:48:07] for the edification of the Saints the
[1:48:10] predestinated of God
[1:48:12] first Thessalonians 5 11 wherefore
[1:48:14] Comfort yourselves together and what
[1:48:19] edify one another even as also you do so
[1:48:24] again edifying one another is Godly
[1:48:27] edification which is in the
[1:48:30] faith
[1:48:32] the faith
[1:48:34] amen
[1:48:36] so now God's man is God's agent
[1:48:40] and the scriptures testified to this
[1:48:42] fact Abel Noah Abraham Daniel uh
[1:48:48] Jeremiah Ezekiel on and on you know uh
[1:48:52] we're part of God's agents do you
[1:48:55] believe that
[1:48:56] amen they stayed right with the message
[1:48:58] that God had given them
[1:49:00] but then there were women that were I
[1:49:03] believe that were agents as well that
[1:49:06] were part of the Bible and that was Ruth
[1:49:08] Esther Rebecca Tamar uh uh Rahab the
[1:49:13] Harlot Sarah Anna the shunamite woman on
[1:49:17] and on you could go of of of women who
[1:49:20] were agents uh in the ministry you you
[1:49:23] look today God used them women to
[1:49:26] testify
[1:49:28] their very lives their very actions
[1:49:31] testify of God's grace
[1:49:34] testify of this church in this age
[1:49:36] testify of the Bride Can you say Amen
[1:49:38] also there was the women who Paul said
[1:49:41] that labored with him in the gospel they
[1:49:45] were not preachers
[1:49:49] but yet they labored with Paul
[1:49:52] in the gospel
[1:49:54] just like you sisters here at the church
[1:49:56] sister Rhonda Sister Lisa cleaning the
[1:49:58] church that's part of the ministry
[1:50:00] you're laboring
[1:50:02] in the gospel sister Melissa and now uh
[1:50:04] Sister Kim Brum till teaching Sunday
[1:50:06] school you sisters that you know who
[1:50:09] helped you know here at the church with
[1:50:11] the music you know and helping out with
[1:50:14] the sound sister Bethany handing out the
[1:50:16] birthday cards Etc Sister Kim weeks
[1:50:18] organizing the food and for our meeting
[1:50:21] and you sisters who help her with
[1:50:22] everything you are laboring
[1:50:25] you're laboring with me as the pastor in
[1:50:28] the gospel
[1:50:30] and every one of us was furthering this
[1:50:33] message I will tell you we're laborers
[1:50:35] with brother Branham in this gospel
[1:50:40] we're laborers
[1:50:42] and you say Amen
[1:50:43] what is it you're part of the ministry
[1:50:47] you're part of the ministry in the
[1:50:48] Saints of the Saints
[1:50:50] you men you you you you you you you
[1:50:52] musicians you're part of the ministry
[1:50:56] laboring
[1:50:58] the god with the gospel doing your part
[1:51:01] can you say Amen it's the ministry of
[1:51:03] the Saints
[1:51:04] and we should value that Ministry
[1:51:07] I I I I I think of this you know that
[1:51:10] that that we we you know when when you
[1:51:13] go downstairs don't don't talk about
[1:51:14] life don't talk about and joke around
[1:51:17] about everything
[1:51:18] why we we got it you're you're important
[1:51:21] in this thing it'd be like you know the
[1:51:24] preacher you know talking about Golf and
[1:51:26] talking about the baseball games and
[1:51:27] talking about this just before he's
[1:51:29] getting behind the pulpit
[1:51:31] you don't want to do them things
[1:51:33] you want to stay focused on this thing
[1:51:35] because everything we're doing is poor
[1:51:38] the ministry
[1:51:41] we want to be anointed in what we do
[1:51:44] ain't that right now notice what the
[1:51:46] prophet said God works through agents
[1:51:48] men you believe that man man is God's
[1:51:53] agent to always not Creeds not
[1:51:56] denominations but man God never worked
[1:51:59] through Machinery or will never worked
[1:52:02] through denominations they die as soon
[1:52:04] as they organize
[1:52:06] so then what is it if God sends somebody
[1:52:09] he's going to send a man if God sends
[1:52:11] anything he's going to send a woman boy
[1:52:13] or girl
[1:52:15] all right
[1:52:17] don't count yourself out
[1:52:23] you might be used to
[1:52:24] to witness to someone to some woman
[1:52:28] with your long hair
[1:52:30] long dress
[1:52:32] in a modesty
[1:52:34] there's so many times as
[1:52:37] someone goes up to my wife's man I love
[1:52:39] your long hair
[1:52:43] it's a testimony
[1:52:45] it's an agent
[1:52:47] can you say Amen see God does nothing
[1:52:50] outside of a man being his agent his
[1:52:52] helper
[1:52:53] well what about you mothers
[1:52:55] I'm just sitting here and through life
[1:52:58] no you're an agent
[1:53:01] you're God's helper
[1:53:05] we've read it so many times but brother
[1:53:07] Brown said let me draw just drop on a
[1:53:09] little token here that I touched on the
[1:53:11] other night to you mothers he said I
[1:53:13] mean he's prayed for your loved ones
[1:53:15] there you are again you're your
[1:53:16] inheritance
[1:53:18] you understand that your inheritance
[1:53:21] Paul told the Romans told the Romans
[1:53:24] said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:53:25] and thou and thy house shall be saved if
[1:53:28] you've got enough faith faith enough for
[1:53:30] your own self to be saved have faith
[1:53:32] everybody say have faith enough
[1:53:35] have faith enough why you're God's agent
[1:53:38] have faith enough no matter how Wayward
[1:53:40] that boy is or that girl is they'll be
[1:53:42] saved anyhow God somehow if he has to
[1:53:46] lay them on their back now when he
[1:53:48] starts going to work don't you complain
[1:53:50] about it let him do his job
[1:53:54] it could be him answering your prayer
[1:53:58] can you say Amen
[1:54:00] he said it's God somehow if he has to
[1:54:02] lay them on their back Lane there in the
[1:54:04] hospital dying they'll be saved God
[1:54:07] promised it
[1:54:09] that God uses you as an agent
[1:54:14] look at this Matthew 9 37 then he then
[1:54:18] saith he unto his disciples the Harvest
[1:54:20] truly is plenteous but the labors are
[1:54:22] few
[1:54:23] pray ye
[1:54:25] now notice there's Jesus telling his
[1:54:27] disciples pray ye therefore the lord of
[1:54:31] the Harvest that he will send forth
[1:54:32] laborers into his Harvest
[1:54:34] brother Bram says in other words Jesus
[1:54:36] was saying pray to me for he was the
[1:54:38] lord of the Harvest pray to me that I
[1:54:41] will send laborers into my Harvest which
[1:54:43] I'm just telling you is such an easy
[1:54:45] thing
[1:54:47] right he's telling them he's the lord of
[1:54:50] the Harvest and he's telling them we
[1:54:52] need to send laborers now pray
[1:54:55] for the lord of the Harvest pray to the
[1:54:58] Lord of the Harvest that he'll send it
[1:55:00] now brother Brown said see part of it
[1:55:02] lays in human beings the kingdom of God
[1:55:04] everybody say the kingdom of God the
[1:55:07] kingdom of God lays within the human
[1:55:09] being
[1:55:10] now Jesus said in one place I'm the vine
[1:55:12] you are the branches the vine can't bear
[1:55:14] fruit
[1:55:15] the branches in the vine bears fruit God
[1:55:18] cannot bear fruit of his self it's got
[1:55:20] to take the church
[1:55:22] that church that he forelected before
[1:55:24] the foundation of the world it's got to
[1:55:25] take you
[1:55:26] can you say Amen see he he's got to take
[1:55:30] you uh branches to bear fruit and when
[1:55:33] you branches are yielded to the vine
[1:55:34] then the fruit comes forth God wants
[1:55:37] your hands he wants your eyes he wants
[1:55:39] your tongue he wants your lips he wants
[1:55:41] your ears he wants your hands and feet
[1:55:43] so that he can bring forth fruit through
[1:55:46] you
[1:55:47] so see he could not even though he knew
[1:55:50] that we needed laborers in the in the
[1:55:53] field for the Harvest he could not send
[1:55:56] them until they prayed for it
[1:56:00] you have a part to do
[1:56:05] every one of us have a part
[1:56:09] you say well if it's all predestinated
[1:56:10] why are we doing because you've got a
[1:56:12] part
[1:56:13] right you got to part in this
[1:56:14] edification
[1:56:17] can you say Amen brother Brown said we
[1:56:19] are partners with him
[1:56:23] look Ephesians 4 and 7. I hope this all
[1:56:26] right
[1:56:27] but unto every one of us has given Grace
[1:56:29] according to the measure of the gift of
[1:56:31] Christ
[1:56:33] wherefore he saith when he ascendeth
[1:56:35] send it up on high he led captivity
[1:56:38] captive and gave gifts unto men
[1:56:41] now I'm not going to keep you much
[1:56:43] longer but he gave gifts unto men
[1:56:46] not all gifts are the same
[1:56:48] nor are they all used in the same
[1:56:52] capacity
[1:56:53] ain't that right
[1:56:55] now you say well I'm preaching the
[1:56:56] message like someone else and yet I'm
[1:56:59] not getting much look like a lot of
[1:57:00] results like this brother is it doesn't
[1:57:02] matter just keep preaching the message
[1:57:04] God's given you your ministry and what
[1:57:08] you are to do
[1:57:10] in the Bible there were Minor Prophets
[1:57:12] and Major Prophets
[1:57:14] Why Not all men are the same not all
[1:57:17] Ministries are the same
[1:57:19] can you say amen God is a god of variety
[1:57:21] not all angels are the same
[1:57:25] ain't that right some have different
[1:57:27] positions than other Angels some have
[1:57:29] some angels have different tasks than
[1:57:31] the others
[1:57:34] see so the the the creation of the world
[1:57:38] proves that God is a god of variety
[1:57:42] God made the mountains but it ain't just
[1:57:45] made every Mountain the same
[1:57:47] some are higher than others some are big
[1:57:49] mountains little mountains right I I
[1:57:51] think we would qualify for little
[1:57:53] mountains here in Virginia
[1:57:58] and and and God would make the The
[1:58:00] Valleys
[1:58:02] some deeper than others
[1:58:04] see God God's just a god of variety in
[1:58:07] every way he's got the planes and the
[1:58:08] and the and and the deserts he's he's
[1:58:11] got the uh uh Four Seasons and and all
[1:58:14] these things
[1:58:15] then then watch brother Brown goes into
[1:58:17] this some men are real blusterous some
[1:58:20] are real dogmatic others are fine and
[1:58:22] others are kind
[1:58:24] you just find all different kinds of
[1:58:26] people and in his kingdom
[1:58:29] you could not judge you cannot judge
[1:58:31] Peter by Andrew
[1:58:33] Andrew stayed on his knees all the time
[1:58:35] praying
[1:58:36] ain't that right
[1:58:38] Peter was a fire brand and preached and
[1:58:41] so forth see so then then you look at
[1:58:43] Paul Paul was different than them both
[1:58:46] he was more scholarly like a prophet set
[1:58:49] back see Andrew he had no he prayed all
[1:58:52] the time and he had no part in writing
[1:58:54] the Bible
[1:58:56] right
[1:58:58] Peter look at Peter
[1:59:00] Peter always stands out to everybody
[1:59:03] he was something else
[1:59:05] and yet God allowed him to write two
[1:59:07] books of the Bible
[1:59:10] Paul
[1:59:12] now he was the scoundrel
[1:59:15] he was out to kill every Christian
[1:59:18] persecuting Christ and yet God had
[1:59:21] somethings in store for him and God
[1:59:23] allowed him to write most of the New
[1:59:25] Testament
[1:59:27] ain't that right
[1:59:28] he's the one that set the word of God in
[1:59:30] order he's the one that separated the
[1:59:32] law from grace and put it it's in its
[1:59:34] place can you say man but they were all
[1:59:37] God's agents
[1:59:39] and were part of his ministry
[1:59:43] brother Brown said the people had need
[1:59:44] of a Healer so God sent Peter to do that
[1:59:46] specific work
[1:59:49] but Peter did not have
[1:59:51] the love in his heart that John had
[1:59:54] for John was love he was God's agency of
[1:59:58] love
[1:59:59] ain't that right the Bible tells of
[2:00:01] Peter James and John
[2:00:03] Peter was a faith he represented faith
[2:00:07] James represented hope
[2:00:09] John represented uh charity Faith was in
[2:00:13] Peter Hope was in James charity was in
[2:00:15] John and yet all three men were God's
[2:00:18] Representatives
[2:00:21] amen
[2:00:22] so then in this ministry a man must work
[2:00:26] within the capacity that God has
[2:00:29] allotted him
[2:00:30] this is why brother Brown said you
[2:00:32] Pastor should never tell a prophet what
[2:00:34] to do you evangelist uh
[2:00:37] never tell a pastor see each one has his
[2:00:41] office if it's perfectly identified
[2:00:44] ain't that right
[2:00:46] now as as as we wrap it up but I want to
[2:00:50] I want to just leave this with you that
[2:00:52] man being God's agent does not take away
[2:00:54] from the Holy Ghost being God's agent
[2:00:58] amen how often
[2:01:01] that people lean upon their own ability
[2:01:05] their own style their own capability
[2:01:09] and leave out the Holy Ghost
[2:01:15] ain't that right but the prophet said
[2:01:17] God operates by the Holy Ghost through
[2:01:20] man
[2:01:22] God's the holy spirit is God's agent
[2:01:27] can you say Amen
[2:01:29] and as we then we read where as as we
[2:01:32] read earlier I am the vine Jesus said I
[2:01:34] am the vine you're the branches without
[2:01:35] me you can do nothing
[2:01:40] the church
[2:01:41] everybody say the church is his agency
[2:01:46] brother Brown said see the branch that
[2:01:48] the holy spirit is working through he
[2:01:51] speaks through the pastor's lips he
[2:01:53] works through his hands and through
[2:01:55] Divine gifts he has set his body into
[2:01:57] motions led by the Holy Spirit by
[2:02:02] emptying himself out and letting the
[2:02:04] Holy Spirit take control he brings
[2:02:06] messages he sees visions and great
[2:02:08] things no matter what it might be that
[2:02:11] God has chosen him to do if he will
[2:02:14] yield to the spirit see he's talking to
[2:02:15] the body now if you'll yield to the
[2:02:17] spirit God will work through him or any
[2:02:20] member of his church
[2:02:23] God's Church
[2:02:25] God works through the Holy Spirit to
[2:02:27] bring these things
[2:02:28] and you say man
[2:02:30] do you love him
[2:02:32] Jesus said in my name you shall cast out
[2:02:34] Devils shall speak with new tongues take
[2:02:37] up serpents and if they drink any deadly
[2:02:39] thing it shall not hurt them they shall
[2:02:40] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[2:02:41] recover
[2:02:42] brother Brown said what is it he's
[2:02:44] stretching forth his holy hand to heal
[2:02:46] by the agency of his church
[2:02:49] it's the ministry
[2:02:51] amen you love him if the musicians will
[2:02:54] come Matthew 18 18. Jesus said verily I
[2:02:57] say unto you whatsoever you shall bind
[2:03:00] on Earth shall be bound in heaven and
[2:03:03] whatsoever you shall loose on Earth
[2:03:05] shall be loosed in heaven again I say
[2:03:08] unto you that if two of you shall agree
[2:03:11] on Earth as touching anything that they
[2:03:13] shall ask it shall be done for them of
[2:03:16] My Father which is in heaven
[2:03:19] you see men are just men
[2:03:22] but they're God's agency
[2:03:28] see the church natural has got it all
[2:03:30] wrong as I've said earlier
[2:03:33] they want the best musicians they want
[2:03:35] the best preachers they want the best
[2:03:36] choirs they want the best dress they
[2:03:38] want the best of everything
[2:03:41] they want the best see and and it's
[2:03:44] gotten
[2:03:45] to a money thing
[2:03:50] preachers the prophet said you know the
[2:03:52] evangelists he won't come to a church
[2:03:53] unless he gets so many thousands of
[2:03:56] dollars
[2:03:57] [Music]
[2:03:59] and it he says it comes to a place that
[2:04:02] soul-saving is is a business
[2:04:05] but he said Soul savings not a business
[2:04:07] of the church
[2:04:09] it's the power of the Holy Ghost in the
[2:04:12] church
[2:04:15] Soul Saving is God's you don't buy it
[2:04:18] with money
[2:04:20] all of it is
[2:04:22] see works works works paid evangelists
[2:04:25] paid song leaders paid choirs everything
[2:04:27] else God don't want that it's all works
[2:04:29] God doesn't want Works he wants the Holy
[2:04:33] Spirit working in you
[2:04:35] [Music]
[2:04:43] it's the holy spirit all along
[2:04:45] can you say man
[2:04:48] we call the man a prophet
[2:04:50] Moses Elijah David Ezekiel brother
[2:04:52] Branham Prophets
[2:04:54] but it's the holy ghost that is really
[2:04:55] the prophet
[2:04:57] but what was it the Holy Ghost was able
[2:05:00] to get in that man
[2:05:02] and that man would surrender himself
[2:05:05] and God would use that gift that he
[2:05:08] placed within that man ain't that right
[2:05:10] well that that that's the same thing
[2:05:13] with with it all see it was the Holy
[2:05:15] Ghost is the one that showed Visions
[2:05:17] it's the Holy Ghost the one that that
[2:05:20] discerned the hearts and intents and
[2:05:23] thoughts of the heart
[2:05:24] it's the holy ghost that done them
[2:05:26] things
[2:05:27] well then what about the church today
[2:05:29] get a people so surrender to God and the
[2:05:33] same God the same holy spirit will take
[2:05:35] over their body
[2:05:37] and we'll use them use you use me in the
[2:05:41] capacity
[2:05:42] that he's called us to do
[2:05:45] and whatever capacity it is it's for the
[2:05:48] edifying
[2:05:50] the church

[2:09:55] amen knowing knowing
[2:09:59] knowing that God is still working
[2:10:02] through a church through a body
[2:10:04] I believe you know the Bible Paul talks
[2:10:08] about it
[2:10:09] but everything that God has done is so
[2:10:11] that he could have preeminence in the
[2:10:13] church
[2:10:14] and I believe it's in this age
[2:10:17] that he's able to have full preeminence
[2:10:20] within his body
[2:10:23] and I'm so glad to be part of that amen
[2:10:25] and I want him to have more preeminence
[2:10:27] in my life so much
