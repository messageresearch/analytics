There we were in Egypt under Pharaoh's mighty hand. We were bound by a wrong religion. Caught in the creed of man. Then a prophet from the desert starts preaching all around. God has heard our prayer. Jehovah has come down. [Music] Moses sure was no great speaker. Nothing polished I could tell. But we all began to notice that he knew Jehovah will as he stood behind the pulpit showing signs of God's great power. It's Jehovah here. A message of the hour. On the journey through the desert about 30 miles high was a cloud that led us every day and a night a pillar of fire. If you ask for my opinion, all that I can say is Jehovah's here to lead us all the way. I know Jehovah's here to lead us all the way. A pillar of fire by night and a cloud by day. I know Jehovah's here to lead us all the way. [Music] And I will follow everything he has to say. I know Jehovah's here to lead us all the way. [Music] A pillar of fire by night and the clouds by day. I know Jehovah's here to lead us all the way. And I will follow everything he has to say. Oh, I will follow everything he has to say. Yes, I will follow everything he has to say. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Give me the word. Make it plain and clear to me. Give me the word. Oh, it's a light that I might see. Just give me the word for it's my total victory over every situation. Give me the word. [Music] It's been tested. It's been tried. Searching minds are satisfied. Even though the story's old, the message still is true. It's been ridiculed. It's been changed. Still its power is never changed. Oh, it will stand the test forever. And give me the word. And give me the word. Oh, make it plain and clear to me. Give me the word. Oh, it's a light that I might see. Just give me the word for it's my total victory over every situation. Give me the word. Now I don't want it watered down, sugarcoated or profound. Give me basic truths that last the course of time. Oh, preach it strong. Preach it clear so that all the world can hear. It has changed my life forever. Give me the word. Oh, give me the word. Oh, make it plain and clear to me. Give me the word. Oh, it's a light that I might see.

Over every situation, give me the word. Well, aren't you glad that you have the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. What else would we do? Amen. If we didn't have it as our guide. And how true it is that the I believe it's David that would tell us that thy word is a lamp unto my feet, a light unto my path. Amen. And um you know, we're living in a dark age, aren't we? And um you can be seated for just a moment, but living in a a a dark time and uh people just don't know what to do. And and we've seen, you know, the Bible uh prophesy of this time and people running to and fro and throughout the land trying to find the truth and um trying to find answers uh for the day that we're living in. and you know, but to be able to have those answers and not just because of a man taught us and we're just following some man as um you know those that follow Jim Jones or David Caresh or whatever, but uh this this word has been vindicated and so vindicated that it's put the heart of the believer at rest. And and I'm so glad for that. I'm so glad to know that Jehovah's leading us &gt;&gt; and he's going to lead us all the way. Amen. And we may not know the way, but he knows. And if we just continue to follow him and his direction, Amen. we'll know we'll make it. Ain't that right? And uh sure we've got trials and troubles and we all go through things and Satan working overtime and uh you know putting thoughts in our minds and trying to discourage us alone. But there's just something you know I I personally just thank God for predestination &gt;&gt; that we can rest in that knowing that there was a seed put in us before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Satan didn't have a choice about it. I didn't have a choice about it. You didn't have a choice about it. It was God that made the choice. And God determined and he's been protecting us and he will protect us through everything that we go through. Amen. And u I want to just say it's uh good to have brother Mark and Sister Crystal back with us. Amen. And uh trust you all had a good time.

Praise the Lord. Well, if you have your Bible with you this morning, I'd like to invite you to turn with me to a few scriptures. And uh uh brother Sean, we uh had a had had a little series uh at home there uh that I preached and it was the the series was the people of the book. Amen. And we were just looking at the people that are spoken of in the book. And we are his people. We are the people of the book. Amen. That that book that book is is is speaking of us. Amen. And but uh the first installment of it was uh I gave a subtitle of He came looking for me. Amen. And so that's why by God's grace that's what we'd like to just speak to you for a few minutes here this morning. And we'd like to look at Genesis chapter 3. We're just going to read one verse in Genesis chapter 3. Also Luke chapter 19 and John chapter 6. Amen. And I'm going to set this down and take my jacket off. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The heat doesn't bother me. The humidity is another story. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. No, it's just fine. Amen. Genesis 3:9, just one scripture here. And the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him, "Where art thou?" Where art thou, Adam? Amen. You know, it's such a striking scripture be, and there's many scriptures like this in the Bible. God knew perfectly well where Adam was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But yet, the cry went out, "Where are you, Adam?" It was it was expressing what was in God's heart. He wasn't he wasn't wondering where is Adam? It was his heart was crying oh Adam where are you? &gt;&gt; The one that was so close to me where are you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Luke chapter 19 verse 10 all the way to the New Testament. Amen. For the Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then John 6:44, I'll just you don't have to turn to it. You I'll just read it here. It says, "No man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him, and I will raise him up at the last day." &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads for a word of prayer this morning. Father, Lord, it's truly an honor, Lord, to just be gathered together, Lord, with my brothers and sisters of like precious faith this morning. Lord, those that hold the testimony of Christ and Lord have tasted the goodness of God. And Lord, we have so much in common. And yet from different parts of the country, Lord, maybe even never meeting in life, yet we are connected, Lord, through you. And so we just are appreciative of that this morning, Lord. And we thank you for your word, Lord, and for your presence, Lord, that comes and anoints your word. For we could read this Bible as many scholars have through the ages, but without your spirit, Lord, to make it live, to anoint it, and to give us revelation, Lord, it would just be an academic exercise, just like any scribe or Pharisee or scholar. But Lord, you've called us to so much more than that. You've called us to a living word this morning and a a living revelation, Lord. And so, Father, we just ask your presence would come and just anoint every person in the building tonight or this morning. Father, anoint me, Lord. Anoint every hearer, Father. May we all, Lord, with spiritual ears of understanding. Receive your word this morning. For your word is life and it is truth, Lord. And we we rest our souls on it this morning. And we just love you and thank you. I thank you for brother Shawn, Lord, and Lord, his uh faithfulness, Father, his sacrifice to lead this flock, Father. I just pray that you continue to bless him, Lord, and and all those here, Lord, that work with him, Father. Each one, Father, we thank you. And we just commit this time to you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. You may be seated this morning. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, we want to we want to just speak about this idea of he came looking for me. Amen. And we'll come back keep coming back to that theme this morning because uh we're taught in the message and we're taught in the the Bible that that we never sought God. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he came seeking after us as we see here right away in the beginning in the book of Genesis. It wasn't Adam when he fell that ran back to God and was trying to be reconciled to God and was crying out, "Oh, father, I've sinned. Help me." It wasn't him. Amen. It was God that went looking for Adam. And his heart's cry was, "Adam, where are you? Let me find you. Let me bring you back." Amen. And so God executing his plan through all time is what we want to look at here this morning. Now, Adam and and all men and and and and all of us, amen, we were thoughts in the mind of God and and you know, our message has illuminated to us this from the scripture that we are our thoughts of God before the beginning, &gt;&gt; before there was time, before anything was created. In the eternities, God thought of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he had thoughts of children and he had thoughts of his family. And he in his thinking they were not flawed. &gt;&gt; He didn't think of children that have sickness. Amen. That were stooped under the the the weight of sin. &gt;&gt; But he his thoughts of children were those that reflected his glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. and had his character and expressed his characteristics. Amen. And they were uh uh shining in the brightness of his glory and they were perfect and full of faith. Amen. They weren't they weren't uh harried by the hounds of hell and they weren't uh weighted down as I said with sickness or sin and the sin condition. &gt;&gt; That wasn't in his original thinking. Amen. &gt;&gt; His original thought for you was a perfect spotless son or daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But yet having a character &gt;&gt; that was developed &gt;&gt; Amen. in the crucible of a sinful world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when he saw you, he saw you perfect but with tempered by that character. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Random told us about power and he said absolute power without that character is satanic. So God would never give us that power or that authority or that place without that character to go with it. And that's his own character. And we would express different portions of his character. Oh, it's so beautiful. Amen. And so he had that thought of you. &gt;&gt; That is God's image of you, his children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; And he had that image. And the Bible uh uh places it with a symbol symbolized as a book of names. &gt;&gt; Right? Brother Brandham said that the book of redemption held the name. Amen. The the lamb's book of life holds our names, but it's not a it's not a name. He said it's not a name like Orman Neville or some name that you would your earthly name that you're given, but it's your image. &gt;&gt; Amen. What he saw in the eternities, his thought concerning you, it's symbolized by writing a name in a book or describing the character of a child in the book. Amen. So, so it's it's a record of of God's thoughts. &gt;&gt; Amen. And every one of them must be expressed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I like to call it God's family album. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. Because that's what it is. Amen. Every thought that every every child that he has is in that book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brham said this in proving his word. He said, 'Now, I think we should just be the most happiest people in the world. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Just think of this. He says, 'I hope that I haven't impressed my audience to believe that it's something that I do myself. You know better than that. I am your brother. See, but I do know that God is here. And I know that he has given something to us that we cannot explain it. The word of God claims that it should be here at this time and it gives us identification. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It gives us identification to know that this people, this chosen, elected, called out, predestinated. &gt;&gt; But we all know, he says, now that's a big word, predestinate. But we all know that it's the truth. We absolutely know that the infinite God predestinated all things by fornowledge before the foundation of the world. Even the lamb was slain and every name that would ever be on that book was put on the book before the book was ever written. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Now, how many knows that's true?" And Jesus came to redeem those that were in that book. In the Bible, the lamb came from behind the curtain, taking the book, opened the seals that it was sealed with. For he came to claim all he had redeemed. &gt;&gt; He's the intercessor making intercessions for all those he had redeemed. All whose name is written in the lamb's book of life is redeemed. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. And of course, Ephesians 1:4 tells us, "According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love." &gt;&gt; Amen. So, he wanted to have a family and he wanted to share his life with his family. He wanted to share experiences with his family just as we do with our natural family. Amen. We have fellowship and there's close bonds and there's ties and we go through life and do things with our family and enjoy that fellowship. And that's what he wants with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. To have fellowship with his family. And that's what he had at the beginning with Adam and Eve. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. Adam never stopped being a son of God, but he lost his fellowship with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. There was a separation that came because of sin. There was a chasm. Amen. as brother Brandham put it, a gulf that that opened up and separated man so that he could never have that closeness of fellowship with God. But his plan was, his thought was in the beginning that he would give his children authority over the earth and that they would subdue the earth. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. And that they would have his character to rule and reign on the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. And in that way, he would have sort of a camaraderie with them, right? Because he's the God of the universe. And so man is the God of the earth. They could they could kind of compare notes as it were, right? He could understand at some level what what God is going through. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so God established this basis for fellowship. And it was good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was good. But the thing that I want to kind of point you to this morning and and we'll keep coming back to this thought that we want to kind of over override all of this is that all this time it's God doing it. &gt;&gt; It's God initiating it. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's God's plan and he's executing it. &gt;&gt; It was his thought in the beginning and when Adam fell, it was him going after Adam. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It was God initiating because God is the one that is has the plan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when man fell, God started seeking after man to restore that fellowship back. Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; As we said, Adam wasn't seeking God. God was seeking man. Adam was hiding from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He He was trying to get away. He realized his condition and his his nakedness. Amen. And so he ran away from God. Oh, how many times do we do that? Amen. Oh, when we should we should be coming to church, but somehow the trials of life or we fall or or we make a mistake or we get cold. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and all instead of going to the place where we can uh receive what we have need of, Amen. where the only one that can fix it, &gt;&gt; we run away. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you see people staying away from church instead of coming to the place where they could find healing and grace &gt;&gt; in time of need. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he should have been running to God. But God, what a scene. God running after Adam, &gt;&gt; saying, "Adam, where are you?" But the beautiful thing about God, and I love this about him, he doesn't start something that he won't finish. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's something that we can all rejoice in. &gt;&gt; He didn't go looking for Adam in futility. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; He found He knew where he was. He found him. He went right to him and found him. When he sets out to do something, he's going to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't care how powerful any how how exalted in hell any demon power might be. There's no devil that can stop God &gt;&gt; from doing what he sets out to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so he set out to redeem Adam. Is he going to do it? &gt;&gt; Is it Is he going to complete it? He set out to find him. Is he going to do it? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He doesn't try. &gt;&gt; God doesn't say, "Well, let's give it a shot." &gt;&gt; That's more me when I'm trying to fix something. &gt;&gt; Well, let's try this. Well, I don't know. Let's try that. &gt;&gt; I don't know. &gt;&gt; Hey, it worked. What do you know? I'm as surprised as you are. Doesn't work that way with God. &gt;&gt; God doesn't try things. &gt;&gt; Amen. He doesn't have experiments. &gt;&gt; That's good, bro. That's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not an experiment in a laboratory. &gt;&gt; Your life is a sure thing. &gt;&gt; Your call. Amen. Your election, it's a sure thing. &gt;&gt; God's not experimenting on you. Amen. &gt;&gt; He knows the beginning from the ending. He lives in the eternities. He doesn't even live in time. &gt;&gt; Amen. And in eternity, he sees all of time together. And so God had slayed the lamb already when Adam fell. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In his mind in eternity, the lamb had already been provided knowing that there was going to be a fall. And so when he went looking for him, he's Adam, I've I've already got, you know, the it's on its way. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he prophesied that it would come in due season. &gt;&gt; So So this is God's work. Amen. This is this is God initiating redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So from that time in the garden until now, God has been doing that work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? He's been seeking out &gt;&gt; that which was lost. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You don't say, "I've lost something." Unless you've had something. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. You say, "Oh, I lost my keys." And you find Brother Amos' keys. And I said, "Those are those are brother am those are keys, but they're not my keys. Those aren't the ones I lost." &gt;&gt; Right. Right. Good point. Good. &gt;&gt; He came to see seek and to save that which was lost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That which was in that original book. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And from that time, he's been seeking them out. Praise his holy name &gt;&gt; because they're being born in time on earth. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that that each one he knew each uh each bed where each seed would be planted. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Each time that each one would come forth in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; You don't think this is an accident? &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. It doesn't matter how badly they are buried in sin. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see all of this? So, I looked up this word setting. Setting, right? A a setting is a backdrop. So, if you're going to tell a story or a do a play or some sort of uh you know production or or or something like that, there's a setting that it takes place in, right? It's a time and a place. And you know, if you if you ever read a book, uh, you know, a story book or something, they'll describe the setting, the the time, the era, the the the place where it takes place, and the people in the area, maybe the city or what's happening at the time that's relevant to the story. All of that is the setting for the story. All of that is just the backdrop that you need to be able to focus then in on the story. But the story is the point. &gt;&gt; The backdrop just helps to accentuate the story. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; It helps it helps build the story. And but it all points back to whatever the plot is that the author has in their mind. &gt;&gt; Is that right? And all of this is a setting that we're in. This earth is the setting. &gt;&gt; Amen. Also, a setting is is something that holds like a diamond. Like if you have a diamond on your ring, the the the the the piece of gold or whatever it is that holds that diamond is called a setting. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and it's designed to hold it in such a way that the diamond can can exhibit its beauty. &gt;&gt; It's not to detract from the beauty of the diamond, but it's to accentuate it. It's to draw your attention to the diamond. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it holds it in its place. That's good. &gt;&gt; And it's there to support it. &gt;&gt; So, it's important. Amen. &gt;&gt; And this this uh earth that we were born into, the condition that we were born into, the family that you were born into, the church that you were born into. Amen. The the time even the age that we've been born into, wherever you've been placed, Amen. That's the setting for your story. [Music] Each child of God, each seed of God, each individual name that's on that book has been placed in a setting &gt;&gt; and like a diamond, they're going to be revealed. &gt;&gt; And they're going to shine forth in the glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. That he places in each one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I love that. Amen. Because sometimes if we're not careful, we can just think that that things that happen to us and and and our lives are just random, right? And just I don't know why this came into my life. I don't know why this happened. I don't know why I've got these family members. I don't know why this or why that. It's all part of the setting. &gt;&gt; And just as much as the seed is predestinated, so is the setting. &gt;&gt; And it's all working together for your good. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that the scripture? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why he could say all these things, they're working together for the good of them that are called according to his purpose. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we shouldn't look at these things like, you know, it's random or it's out of control. &gt;&gt; No. For the child of God, that's never the case. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Trial comes in your life. Amen. It's like Job. God allowed those trials to come in Job's life. He had to get permission. Satan had to get permission from God to bring those trials into Job's life. &gt;&gt; What about a child of God? Amen. In this age, &gt;&gt; Amen. He's got to get permission to come and to test you and to tempt you. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if he does that, it's for a purpose. &gt;&gt; That's what makes a Christian so much different than the world. One of the things, Amen. is that we can go through the same things that somebody else is going through, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We can go through the same trials that a co-orker is going through, maybe, you know, sickness or losing family or things in our finances, whatever. &gt;&gt; The same things, but yet we are not frustrated because we know there's a purpose behind all these things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It gives us hope and joy &gt;&gt; knowing that our father has us in the palm of his hands. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So from that time until now, God has been seeking out his children wherever they are. And brother Brown described it like a it could be at the a the bottom of a pond, right? &gt;&gt; Yes. a lily in the bottom of a pond in the in the scum and the mud in the muck. It could be buried in the the the the worst sin that you could think of. &gt;&gt; That's true, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And people, we look at people and we say, "Well, they don't they don't really look like they would accept this message, so you know, I'm not going to worry about them." Well, this person, oh, they look like they could be a message believer. That's not the way God does his business. &gt;&gt; Amen. He takes the most unlikely. I'm so thankful. Amen. He takes the He He takes those that that the world would cast away. &gt;&gt; Amen. He takes the the the muck and the m and he reaches down into it. &gt;&gt; He came where we were so that we could go where he is. &gt;&gt; And he reaches down. And he reaches down. And sometimes it's way down. And he grabs a hold of that seed and he begins to tug on that heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Think about how God found Abraham. He was in a false God shop. &gt;&gt; Yes, he was. &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't pick up pick some holy man standing out on a mountain somewhere offering sacrifices to Jehovah. &gt;&gt; He picked the guy that was selling idols. Amen. &gt;&gt; He went down and and reached down to Abraham and began to tell Abraham his thoughts concerning him. &gt;&gt; It was God seeking Abraham. Abraham wasn't looking for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Abraham was minding of his own business, doing his own thing. But God initiates and tells him and makes promises to him. &gt;&gt; I will. I will. I will. That's what he says to Abraham. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is my promise to you. This is what I'm going to do for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There was no backup plan for Abraham. Well, you know, if Abraham doesn't work out, we've got another guy over here. No, that's not the way God works. &gt;&gt; God started a work in Abraham and he finished a work in Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. He knew what he was doing when he called him. Now, we excuse me, we read the whole story, &gt;&gt; right? We see Abraham from the beginning to the ending &gt;&gt; and we say, "Oh, sure." You know, I I can see that. I can see he's the father of the faith. I mean, look at how how much faith he had to, you know, uh to sacrifice Isaac and to to hold on to God's promise to to have his body changed. I mean, he's a he's a type of all. He's the father of the faith. Is that right? &gt;&gt; And we look at that from the beginning of the ending and we see that Abraham was truly one of the elect of God. &gt;&gt; But what about at the beginning? &gt;&gt; What did he look like? Amen. &gt;&gt; But when God calls a man or woman, he always backs them up. And he backed Abraham up. Let me let me just read to you before I get too far here. I've got some some quotes that I do want to read uh here this morning. And and brother Brandham said this. He said that uh he said now and and you've probably heard this many times, but I just want to bring this to your remembrance. He said, "Look, uh you say I spoke with tongues." He says, "That don't mean nothing. That don't mean a bit more than if you go out here and play a tune on a guitar or something. It doesn't mean one thing. Though you spoke with tongues, though you shouted and run up and down the aisles and cried tears still like you had peeling onions. He says that that don't mean a thing unless that everyday life backs up just exactly and stays with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so that what we're talking about here this morning is that life. &gt;&gt; Amen. That that's the that's the whole crux of this is that what God wants his children expressing is that his life &gt;&gt; and that's what when we talk about the diamond shining that's what we're talking about living a life the life being expressed we're not talking about spiritual gifts &gt;&gt; right we believe in spiritual gifts &gt;&gt; but spiritual gifts are not the sign that you have that life &gt;&gt; right that's right &gt;&gt; amen that was the difference between uh what the Pentecostals were holding on to versus what the messenger taught us. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. They were looking to the gifts. Now, uh we've been looking at this, brother Sean, a lot lately is, you know, in this message, we many have done the same thing, only they don't do it with speaking in tongues. They do it with believing God sent a prophet. &gt;&gt; And they say, "Well, that's well, if you got that, then you got the Holy Ghost." Well, that's good, but that's not the evidence that you've got the Holy Ghost, right? And so, it just comes along. What we're looking for is the life. &gt;&gt; That's what God is looking for. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember, he gave us that little parable about the the the Herford cattle and how they would be of all different types of brands, which mean they were owned by different uh different men and different ranchers and things, right? But they all had a tag that indicated they were a purebred Herford &gt;&gt; cattle, right? &gt;&gt; They that was a tag that that talked about the life, the blood, &gt;&gt; the what what the life was on the inside. &gt;&gt; And that's what he's looking for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what differentiates. Now, uh if we go a little further, this is from the infallibility of God's spoken word. He said, 'Now, from the beginning, he says, if we take uh the patriarch Jacob, he was a wandering boy. He was a runaway boy, and he'd run away from home because he was afraid that Esau was going to kill him because of something that he'd done. And he run away from home. Yet, that boy was anchored in God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Even running away from home, there was something anchoring him. Amen. Yet that boy was anchored in God by a divine promise that was made to Abraham. &gt;&gt; Now that divine promise that was made to Abraham was God's idea. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That was God's word, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; God took that word and he spoke it and he made that promise to Abraham. And that that had so much power that it anchored Jacob into that promise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so Jacob laid anchored in that divine promise that was made to Abraham. &gt;&gt; Now listen to this. He says that's just the same promise that laid anchored in Jacob lays anchored in every born again believer tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. God calls sovereignly without anything you done about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, that should just take all the the scare out of us. &gt;&gt; That should just make us just rest. &gt;&gt; Amen. That should just make us just just worship and appreciate him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God calls sovereignly without anything you done about it. You say, "No, wait a minute. I'm the one I had a a a burning desire in my heart." And what about all those things that Brother Brandon preached about desperation? and you have to get desperate and and and and hold on to the the horns of the altar. And that's all true, brother, sister. &gt;&gt; That's all true. But that desperation, that desire, &gt;&gt; that pull &gt;&gt; is God pulling you. &gt;&gt; You can't have that on your own &gt;&gt; because we read the scripture, no man comes except the father draws him first. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God calls sovereignly. He decides it's time for you to come. &gt;&gt; And he puts something in your heart and you think it's your idea. &gt;&gt; I need God. &gt;&gt; Something in me just needs God. &gt;&gt; And you thought that came from you. &gt;&gt; And he put that in there in the perfect time and place. &gt;&gt; God calls sovereignly without anything you done about it. He says, "There's nothing you done." Men say, "Oh, I sought God." He said, "No man has sought God at any time." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's God seeking man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not man seeking God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God seeking man. And then he quotes that scripture. No man can come to me except my father draws him first. You get it? It has to be God drawing man. He says, "Man in his nature is a castaway. He's an alien. He's away from God." Now, you know what an alien, we think of alien, we think of like the, you know, Area 51, space flying saucers and stuff, right? But an alien is someone who's not in their right country. &gt;&gt; Amen. They're not home. &gt;&gt; They're in a foreign land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what he's talking about. Hallelujah. He says he's an alien away from God. The right position is with God. Amen. Then God by grace has to draw him to his own side and all that the father hath given me will come to me. Oh, it's it's so beautiful, brother, sister, because he's the one that puts that decides it's time. And he puts the desire in there. And like I said, he doesn't start something that isn't going to be finished. He doesn't just try things. So if there's a call in your heart to come to him, you can know with assurance that it's his will for you to come. &gt;&gt; Wonderful Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All that the father has given me will come to me. No way at all. He says there ain't enough picture shows. There ain't enough dance halls. There ain't enough burlesque shows in the country to keep you away from God. When God goes to drawing back yonder before the foundation of the world, when he put your name down that you'd come, &gt;&gt; you're coming. &gt;&gt; That's all right. &gt;&gt; He says, "Oh, you might be a hypocrite and work up and say this, that, or the other." And I I mean, but I mean when God calls, so what he's talking about is again spiritual gifts or signs, right, that that people point to. You could be a hypoc hypocrite and exhibit those signs. You could be a hypocrite and shout in church, &gt;&gt; right? But he's talking about when God really calls. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He says when God goes to calling, you don't stop and say, "Well, I'm a Christian. These things don't bother me." That shows you're not. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. What he seeks, he always finds. &gt;&gt; Amen. And every name that was on that book, he's going to find every single one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was never a time where God went looking for someone and gave up because he couldn't find them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the beautiful thing is he uses you and I as partners, &gt;&gt; right? We're all part of this work, &gt;&gt; right? were fellow workers with him drawing and calling, getting his word out. &gt;&gt; Sometimes that call comes through a preacher. Sometimes it comes through a mother. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it comes through a friend witnessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen, brother. &gt;&gt; He works through flesh. &gt;&gt; And then when he finds you, we have to surrender to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know the the the the example I love so much is the example of Mary in the scripture. Amen. Because Mary was prophesied about &gt;&gt; a virgin shall conceive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All those years before and for many years they wondered what is that? What is that going to be? What is it going to look like? And maybe people tried to to fulfill that. But Mary was just minding her own business. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Random said that that they were talking about God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like we do. We think about God's word and we talk about it. And he said he comes when he's talked about, right? And he says they were talking about his word. But that angel came to her and told her, Mary, that scripture in Isaiah, a virgin shall conceive, that is you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? &gt;&gt; That is you in the scripture. &gt;&gt; Now, her name Mary wasn't written there. &gt;&gt; Right. That's right. &gt;&gt; But she was in the scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't up to her to figure that out. &gt;&gt; God showed it to her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God came and pointed her called her and pointed her out. Mary, that's you. &gt;&gt; It was a revelation from God. So what was Mary's part? Yay, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. I accept. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be it unto me according to thy word. &gt;&gt; I receive it. I believe it. &gt;&gt; And she walked in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. She believed it and walked in it. That's good. &gt;&gt; The the the the footsteps that she took in her life, the decisions she made reflected that revelation that she had. &gt;&gt; That's good, brother. Right there. That's good. &gt;&gt; That she had found her name in the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus when he walked on earth, the way that he walked and the things that he said and he conducted himself because he knew who he was and he had found himself in the volume of the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What about us? G. &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got to find ourselves in the volume of the book. &gt;&gt; We've got to know what God's word says about us. &gt;&gt; It doesn't say your name. It doesn't say my name specifically, but we find ourselves by revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. God will come by revelation and reveal it to you. &gt;&gt; I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; And when you get that revelation, then you begin to read in the scripture, you say, "That's talking about me." Hey, he's talking about me again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How do you know? Well, God told me. &gt;&gt; I didn't make something of myself. I didn't come up with the idea. &gt;&gt; But God showed me my place in the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. He showed me where the spirit and the bride say, "Come." He showed me where there's a spotless, sinless, virtuous bride of of Christ. He showed me where there's overcomers in Leodysia. and on and on and on. &gt;&gt; And we find ourselves in the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But he doesn't search us out. He didn't he didn't search out Mary just to leave her alone or he doesn't search you out just to well, you know, um good luck. You know, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; Go go go join a church. And &gt;&gt; you know, uh, hopefully hopefully we'll see on the other side. Hopefully you'll make it through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The nature of God, one of the one of the, uh, one of the attributes of God is supreme faithfulness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you wonder what faithfulness looks like, God is supreme &gt;&gt; faithfulness. He promised never to leave us or forsake us. He's the one that started the work. He's the one that finishes the work. He's the alpha and omega and everything in between. He's the author and finisher of our faith. He's the giver and sustainer &gt;&gt; of our lives. &gt;&gt; Sustainer means the one that keeps it going. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the one that's right there when you need a charge like a battery. He makes sure that you get what you need. &gt;&gt; He's the Jehovah Gyra that's there to provide. Amen. When you're down and you need a lift, he can provide what you have need of. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember his original thought for you is close fellowship with him. &gt;&gt; That's it. That's it. &gt;&gt; Praise. walking with him with no hindrance, with no chasm of sin between. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But walking in closeness of fellowship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we walk with him in the light as he is in the light. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And if we step out, we're not condemned. &gt;&gt; We're just convicted. We're just &gt;&gt; chastised a little bit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Because every child is going to make it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's like that song says, he didn't throw away the clay. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. He just &gt;&gt; He just fixes things back up. He's got grace for us. &gt;&gt; But we we don't uh we don't take advantage of the grace. And in other words, we don't frustrate the grace. &gt;&gt; We're not out looking to live like the world. &gt;&gt; But we have grace when we make a mistake. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we step out, it doesn't ruin his plan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It might mean a little more hardship for you, &gt;&gt; right? We we reap what we sow. So, we might go through something, but but he's always provided his blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Grace to get us through. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Holy name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes we can grieve him. The Bible says, is that right? We can push him aside. &gt;&gt; We can get a little cooled off. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Put your halos down, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We can grieve him &gt;&gt; by our unbelief. But even in those moments, the Holy Spirit is still seeking. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. You see, it doesn't just start with that. It didn't just end with that first time. But the Holy Ghost goes seeking into your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. It happens when you come to church. Oh, you didn't know that was happening, huh? When your pastor gets up here and begins to preach the word of God, &gt;&gt; the word begins seeking. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's looking and and penetrating into your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's cutting away things that are not pleasing to him. You say, "Well, what is that? What's not pleasing to him?" Well, remember, he has an image. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And right now, we don't reflect that image completely. There's things that have to be chipped away. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's like brother Bam talked about that sculptor, Michelangelo, who sculpted the Moses, the one of the greatest sculptures ever done. And and you know, it's amazing about what's amazing about those sculptures is what those men could do with stone, cold, hard stone, and make it look lively and living, you know, so much and so accurate where they they portray the very veins and muscles exactly perfectly to where it looks like it's alive. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; because the image that Michelangelo had in his head was Moses. &gt;&gt; Amen. and he went down and found a block of stone and something that was dirty and buried in the earth and didn't look like anything. But yet in his mind, he saw Moses inside of that block of stone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, what does he do with a life of a child of God? There's a seed in there. It looks like an old dirty block of stone. Amen. But he has an image in the back part of his mind for that one. Amen. And so what does he do? He begins chipping away. Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said uh he they said, "Well, how do you do that? How do you how do you create such a beautiful masterpiece out of a block of stone?" And he said, "I just remove everything that wasn't Moses, &gt;&gt; right? Everything that didn't match the image, &gt;&gt; right? Amen." And that's what the word of God is doing for you. Every time we come to church, every time you open your Bible, every time you get down to pray, every time you listen to a tape, Amen. God is working on your character. Amen. He's chipping away because he has an image. It's not random. &gt;&gt; Praise his holy name. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's going through a process with you. &gt;&gt; And he's chipping away that which doesn't match what's written in the book. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, we can come in with our unbelief. We can come in cooled off or our minds going a million miles an hour. &gt;&gt; But what will happen, brother, sister, is the word will go and seek out &gt;&gt; that need. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. The word will find the need in your life and it will meet the need. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful for that. &gt;&gt; The word comes looking for me. &gt;&gt; The word comes looking for me. When I need him, I don't even many times know what I need. &gt;&gt; But he knows what I need and he comes finds me &gt;&gt; and he seeks me out. The word finds me right where I am at and ministers to my need. If I need healing, it's the word that seeks me out and finds me &gt;&gt; and heals me. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit in the seeking God is moving. &gt;&gt; Amen. He brings conviction if it's needed. He brings reconciliation if it's needed. &gt;&gt; But it's always to bring us to that image. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful he tells me when I'm wrong. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because I want to be right. &gt;&gt; You can't be right unless you can accept that you are wrong. &gt;&gt; And guess what? We're all wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I can accept that this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; When it comes from him. &gt;&gt; So it's in that closeness that he wants to walk with us. And he wants to be your everything. Everything. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. Amen. He wants to protect you and care for you. He wants to give you everything that you have need of. Hallelujah. Sometimes he allows situations in our lives to drive us back. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Into his arms. Amen. So that we'll lean on him. &gt;&gt; So that we'll allow him to be God. &gt;&gt; He can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities. Amen. I'm so thankful for that scripture because it describes such character in God. Amen. That we have a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities. Infirmities means our weakness. It's not just necessarily sickness. It's the weakness of our humanity. Amen. The feeling, not just the infirmity, but the feeling of our infirmities. what we're going through in our emotional realm. Amen. &gt;&gt; All of it. He's interested in it and he can be touched by it. That means he can be moved by it. He can be put into action &gt;&gt; by that. It he's a he's a feeling God. He's not a cold, distant, hard God. Amen. He's an everpresent help in time of trouble. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's tender toward his children and he loves them. He's looking for one to be strong on behalf of that one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's looking for one that'll stand up and say, "I believe God's word." And he he'll he'll move for that one. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's the Lord of hosts after all. Amen. &gt;&gt; He wants to be your champion. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So remember what he's doing though. He's calling names off the book. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's calling names. It's like, you know, when he went and uh was walking around in the shores of Galilee and he sees a fisherman named Peter, Simon, right? Oh, there was lots of fishermen. There's probably a lot better fishermen. There are probably better character men. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Than Simon. Amen. There were fishermen before he was there and there were fishermen after he was there. &gt;&gt; Many He looked just like all the rest of them. &gt;&gt; But the difference was his name was on the book. &gt;&gt; Amen, brother. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus going through the list. He's got a list of all his his his apost his disciples, right? &gt;&gt; Well, he's just going down through the list, each one. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He gets to Peter's name. Okay, we got to go find him. He's down here. He's down here by the shore. He's a fisherman. Let's go down and find him. And his brother Andrew and James and John, they're fishermen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Peter had no idea what would become of his life. &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't know that they'd have a basilica in Rome named after him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That that there'd be a pope that claimed to be, you know, in his spiritual lineage. &gt;&gt; That that we'd be reading about him. We'd be calling his name thousands of years later, &gt;&gt; just an ignorant fisherman. &gt;&gt; Couldn't even write his own name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But yet, his name was in the book. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so Jesus goes walking through the shores of Galilee. You Yeah, I'm talking to you, &gt;&gt; Matthew. Tax collector. Hey, come on. Follow me. Your name's here. You're next. Let's go. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hey, you. Oh, yeah. Here's this one. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Follow me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. The Bible says that he had needs go by Samaria. &gt;&gt; Glor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Well, he got to that name in the list. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, she's down in Samaria, so we'll have to take a little detour. &gt;&gt; But that's all right. We'll find this one, too. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what she looks like. There's something inside of her that can receive revelation. There's a seed in that woman that I placed there before the foundation of the world. And that's the next one off my list. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he redirected his whole ministry. We're we we got to go to the next name. &gt;&gt; Oh wow. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he goes down there and begins to speak the word. And there's a little seed in there that began to vibrate. &gt;&gt; Amen. And activate. &gt;&gt; Something was happening. Amen. The word of God was coming her way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And and it began to receive and to come to life &gt;&gt; and something in her just said, "Believe that." &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Well, all the things that you've heard and believed and and and have been explained to you, whatever, believe that. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. She didn't go looking for him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; He came looking for her &gt;&gt; and he found her. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he called her with his word. &gt;&gt; What's the difference? Jesus presence made the difference. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That seed laying dormant all that time. But in its time and in its season, &gt;&gt; his presence came on the scene. Amen. His life came on the scene and that made the change. That made the difference. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, I think of Paul, Saul, the Pharisee. &gt;&gt; He had a plan for his life. Amen. Those Pharisees, they weren't they weren't uh haphazard about their schooling, right? They had goals &gt;&gt; and they had, you know, they had a way of doing things and, you know, a way to rise up the ranks and they believed that that was how they served God. And that's what Saul was doing. He had letters, the sanction from the priests and the the the the high men of God in in that move. Amen. And and that was his way to advance. And that was his way to serve God better. And he believed it. He was zealous towards God &gt;&gt; and he had his life all figured out. He had dedicated himself from the time he was a little boy to studying the word of God. So zealous. &gt;&gt; But you know what? There were many boys like that. &gt;&gt; There were many like that. Many priests and and and going through that process. Many Pharisees and Sadducees that were sincere and dedicated their lives. I mean, just think about how brother Brandham talks about the kindly old priest, right? Sincere, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul was sincere, too. Saul was sincere just like all the rest of them. They were sincerely thought they were doing the will of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. But Paul's name was on the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. His name was on the book. And there were different people being added to the kingdom as their names were being called off the book. Amen. And finally, it came down to Saul &gt;&gt; of Tarsus. &gt;&gt; It's time for him. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Well, this one has a special call in his life, so he needs a little bit of something there." He he he went to him and knocked him down, &gt;&gt; smacked him around a little bit, took his eyesight from him, humbled him, in other words, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Brought him brought him down and began to speak to him. &gt;&gt; Why are you persecuting me, Saul? Who are you? I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest. It's hard for you to kick against the pricks. You know what a prick is? That's a ox go. &gt;&gt; That's how that's how somebody steers an ox, right? It's a steering wheel for an ox. Nope. Nope. Don't go over there. Over here. Okay, get moving. Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Saul in his zeal was going his own way. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "No, your name's on the book, so I'm going to just change your direction." Amen. &gt;&gt; That plan, all those things that you thought that you were going to do with your life, you were going to go to college and you were going to get a good a good job and you were going to have a nice house and a car and this and that and I was going to live in this certain place or maybe I was going to be famous or do this thing or whatever. &gt;&gt; When your name is called, &gt;&gt; glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're coming according to his word. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Jesus went looking for him. and interrupted his plan. &gt;&gt; Said, "No, Saul, you had a plan, but I've got a different plan for you." &gt;&gt; Amen. Think of that call. Why are you persecuting me, Saul? Just like Adam, where are you? &gt;&gt; Adam, where are you? Fallen, where are you? Saul, why are you persecuting me? Amen. And the call went out and there was something on the inside that said, "Who are you?" &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; The religious leaders excommunicated him, kicked him out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But he found out that his life was so much greater than he could have ever imagined. &gt;&gt; Called to be the first church age messenger to write much of the New Testament. called to be a great powerful apostle and missionary to take the word of God to the Gentiles to take salvation to an entire race of people on the earth. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Why? Because his name was on the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The master craftsman began to work. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful for that. Aren't you? &gt;&gt; Amen. We need to wrap this up this morning. We don't want to just keep going all day, brother Sean. Amen. &gt;&gt; But brother and sister, each individual is being called. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Each one has to hear their own name called. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've got to hear it ourselves. &gt;&gt; And then he's fitting each one together into a body. and he's molding us and shaping us so that we'll fit together according to his word. But it takes us to surrender. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful for that. &gt;&gt; There's nothing I have to do. Just say yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; I accept and believe your word, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. It doesn't matter what you have need of this morning. That's the only thing that you have to do, right? Isn't that the theme of this message? Only &gt;&gt; believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Lord. I accept it. Yes, Lord. Your name's on the book. I accept it, Lord. &gt;&gt; He's still calling. He's still seeking today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's still calling each and every name. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the thing is, brother, sister, I can't tell you that your name's on the book. Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got to find out for yourself. &gt;&gt; And oh, brother Sean, you talk about a a mystery being revealed in this day. The mystery is who's on the book. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that mystery is unveiling in time. It's being revealed and unveiled. And when the last name is on the book is called, he said that's when Christ comes. &gt;&gt; That's when it that's when our time is ended. &gt;&gt; That work is finished. &gt;&gt; Amen. When that last one is called, but he's not going to come before the last one is called. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, brother, sister, if you have a desire in your heart, let's all stand this morning. If you have a desire in your heart, musicians have become anything in you wants to be closer to God, wants God, amen, wants to surrender more, wants to give more of your life to him, wants to be closer to him. Any any desire according to his word, it's because he put that desire there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, &gt;&gt; that's one of the that's one of the most liberating things, brother, sister, that we have as believers. &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus could boldly make those statements where he says anyone who is thirsty or anyone who is hungry or anyone who knocks or anyone who seeks, he said if you seek you will find. If you knock it shall be open unto you. Why could he make that with such an assurityity? Well, it was Jesus. Well, yeah, of course. But the reason that he could do that is because he knows it's God doing the pulling on the other end. You can't seek unless he calls. You can't knock unless he put that desire in there. Brother Brandham expressed it like David as the deep calling to the deep. Amen. So, I want to encourage you this morning. If there's anything in you that wants to be closer to God, that wants desires something from God this morning, he put that desire there. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; And he didn't put that desire there to frustrate you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The heathens have these ideas about gods that that trick people and and and they're they're trying to deceive people and and and they play games with them and trick them. That's not our God. Amen. &gt;&gt; If he puts a desire in there, it's because it's his will to give it to you. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; now you got to make sure that's according to his word and not your desire. &gt;&gt; Well, I have a desire for a Corvette. No, hold on. Amen. It's got to be according to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's any promise in this word. It belongs to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If it's a true revelation, it will come to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he's still calling today. He's still seeking today. He's looking for those Amen. that would surrender to him. He didn't bring you this far to leave you. &gt;&gt; That ought to be a song, brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's going to accomplish what he set out to do &gt;&gt; in each one. Do you believe that this morning? Amen. I'm so thankful he knows right where we're at this morning. &gt;&gt; He knew right where Zakayas was at. He was hiding out, but there was still a desire in his heart to see Jesus. When Jesus got to him, he looks up. What are you doing hiding up in that tree? You knew I'd passed by this way. And that desire that's in your heart, I put there. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads this morning. Oh, Father, how thankful we are, Lord, for your word this morning. How grateful, Lord. Lord, that your word is sure and it's sharper than any two-edged sword, [Music] discerning the very separation, Lord, between our flesh and our spirit and our soul. It's a firm foundation this morning. Lord, I thank you this morning as I as I just think back and reflect, oh God, I think back to that day, oh God, when you made it sure in my life that you called me, Lord, you called me by name. You came down, Lord, and you made yourself real to me. You filled me with your spirit, Lord, and I've never been the same since. And I know from that day I know that I know that I know &gt;&gt; that my name is in that book. Lord, I want that for everybody. Lord, I pray Lord God that you would just bless your children this morning, knowing that each one has to get their own revelation directly from you. I pray that you'd help them. Father, if there's any that need healing this morning, Lord, may they just receive it &gt;&gt; as a loved gift from you, Lord, purchased on Calvary. Lord, if there's any that need a touch in their emotions, Lord, in their spirit, I pray that you would touch them, Lord. May your spirit just rain down on your children this morning, oh God, with every good and perfect gift. Once again, Lord, I just thank you for this assembly, Father. I pray that you bless them, Lord. Just continue, Lord, to to use our brother Shawn as you lead him and lead them, Father. And Lord, we're looking forward to that day when we'll all be gathered together. That our trials will behind us then. You'll wipe every tear from our eyes. What a wonderful day, Lord, we're looking towards. And we believe you're coming soon, Lord. So, let us be up and doing while there is still time, Father. Work while it is day. We thank you, Father, and we ask these things in Jesus name. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Brother, sister, it's a personal revelation to you. Amen. That's what calling your name off the book is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's when he comes to you and says, "You're my child." Amen. &gt;&gt; And like I said, I remember the day he did that for me. And he he came and he told me, not with an audible voice, but he spoke to me and he said, "You're my child. Amen. And I I believe your faith. You've confessed me all these years being a Christian, but now I confess you &gt;&gt; and he gave me his token. &gt;&gt; Amen. He gave me his Holy Spirit as a token that whenever I get in trouble, Amen. whenever I come up against a demon, I can just present that token. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But he had to give it to me. Amen. No preacher gave it to me. No pastor gave it to me. Messenger didn't give it to me. He gave it to me. &gt;&gt; Just like Ruth had to go directly to Boaz, get her revelation directly from him. There was nobody else around. She couldn't go through a third party. It had to be him speaking directly to her. And then she could say, "I know that I know that I know." Amen. Brother, sister, we are living in a dreadful age and we have to know that we know that we know &gt;&gt; that our name is on the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God bless you, brother Sean. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, for saving my soul. Thank you Lord for making me whole. Oh, thank you Lord for giving to me. Oh, thy great salvation so rich. Well, are you thankful for grace? Oh, thank so glad that we're part of that book. He came looking for us. He found us. Oh yes, Lord Jesus. for making me whole.

He's taking everything away that is not the real us of what he saw in us. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So thankful for that, Lord Jesus. M thankful to you Lord Jesus. Well, did you enjoy it today? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Blessed be the name of the Lord. I am so glad that God is keeping record &gt;&gt; and not keeping record of our faults. &gt;&gt; He's keeping record of his thoughts about us. And nothing can change that. No matter how scarred we may be, no matter all the complexes that Satan may put on us, no matter what what Satan has done in our past. Amen. God still kept a picture of us. God's got that record. And I'm so glad for that. I love the Lord. So glad to be one of his. Amen. Amen. There's that little song um Why should I worry? Why um I don't know the title of it, but why would I worry when giants come calling my name? [Music] For my God is so much bigger than troubles I face. Oh, why would I hunger for power or riches or fame? Cuz my God is very much bigger than all of these things. So I won't be shaking [Music] and I won't be moved. Hallelujah. My God is faithful.

May we always count our blessings and never forget just how blessed we are. If God never answers another prayer for us, if he never does anything for us again in this life, we have truly been blessed to be able to get to walk with him, to get to know him, to be able to hear the voice of the bridegroom through this message, and to be able to answer that call. It's truly been the grace of God. Amen. And um we want to just keep uh those that are uh fighting uh inflictions in their body and uh the different ones that was mentioned earlier today. Amen. That God would just touch them, heal them. And uh we want to remember uh a prayer service uh tomorrow uh at 7:00 uh for those that would want to come. Uh we've just had uh been having good time in prayer. And uh we want to keep brother Andy and and his his family in our prayer as they would be heading back to North Carolina today and then home Tuesday. And God will just continue to bless uh them and bless his ministry. And again, we're just really delighted that uh they came by our way and uh certainly enjoyed the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. and very uplifting and uh so may God bless you. We love you and uh I don't guess there's any announcements. Any announcements? All right. Well, let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer. And brother Bill, do you want to dismiss us today?
