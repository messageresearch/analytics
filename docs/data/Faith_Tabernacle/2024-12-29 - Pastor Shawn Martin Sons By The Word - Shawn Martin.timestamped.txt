[37:33] children and Lord we're not just eating
[37:36] the crumbs off the table but we are
[37:39] sitting at the
[37:40] table and eating a seven course meal as
[37:46] your Prophet would call it and we're so
[37:48] thankful father to be

[37:55] away Lord uh and and be unth thankful
[37:59] but we want to partake of your food that

[38:30] ears to hear and hearts to receive and
[38:34] understand father we just ask it and may
[38:37] you just have your Supreme Sovereign way
[38:40] this morning in Jesus Christ's name and
[38:44] the church
[38:46] says amen amen Romans the 8th chapter
[38:53] and we're going to start at the 14th
[38:55] verse this is a very familiar scripture
[38:58] for us but it's um it's for us in this
[39:02] day um for as many as are led by the
[39:05] spirit of God they are the sons of
[39:08] God for ye have not received the spirit
[39:11] of bondage again to fear but you have
[39:14] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[39:17] we cry ABA father the spirit itself
[39:21] beareth witness with our spirit that we
[39:24] are the children or sons of God
[39:28] and if children then heirs and Heirs of
[39:31] God and joyin heirs with Christ if so be
[39:35] that we suffer with him that we may be
[39:38] also glorified together for I reckon
[39:42] that the sufferings of this present time
[39:44] are not worthy to be compared with the
[39:46] glory which shall be revealed in
[39:49] us for the earnest
[39:52] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[39:56] the manifestation
[39:58] of the sons of God amen amen you can
[40:01] have your seats
[40:04] the earnest expectation of the creature
[40:08] of
[40:09] creation waiteth for the
[40:12] manifestation of the sons of God so
[40:16] that's a promise to us amen that the
[40:19] sons of God are going to be
[40:23] manifested and I truly believe that
[40:27] where we're living at
[40:30] today and um I guess if I would use a
[40:33] title it would be just called Sons by
[40:36] the
[40:37] word Sons by the word and often times we
[40:41] as
[40:42] ministers we um we talk about the
[40:46] purpose of God the the the plan of God
[40:50] and that's
[40:51] a I I guess we we talk about it a lot
[40:55] and and and
[40:57] the the reason why is because it's
[41:00] important to know what God is doing and
[41:02] what he is trying to
[41:04] achieve God doesn't save
[41:07] us and then just let us float
[41:11] around and choose our our own destiny
[41:16] and and he becomes our Aaron boy he
[41:20] becomes the
[41:23] um well the world would has traded him
[41:28] for Santa
[41:30] Claus and um and God's not that way but
[41:34] God has a purpose God has a
[41:38] plan and uh so we want to know what he
[41:43] is trying to achieve because God always
[41:47] works uh to fulfill uh his purpose and
[41:52] plan and Paul would call it the Eternal
[41:56] purpose of God God and so it's because
[42:00] of this the message of the hour that
[42:02] we're able to understand have a clear
[42:05] understanding of God's
[42:07] purpose not not just a history from a
[42:11] historical
[42:13] standpoint which because of the message
[42:16] we're able to see what God done Through
[42:19] the Ages but we are a group of people
[42:22] that are able to understand what he's
[42:24] doing today because
[42:27] that's the message deals with the
[42:30] purpose and plan of God but it's a
[42:34] personal revelation that his purpose and
[42:37] plan has to do with me with with you and
[42:43] and so then we're not just floating
[42:44] around it gives us something to fight
[42:47] the devil with when the devil says well
[42:49] you're just a nobody well we see
[42:52] ourselves in the purpose and plan of God
[42:55] and we've been told that nobody can take
[42:57] our place so whatever the devil wants to
[42:59] tell us we must not believe
[43:03] that now uh so because of the message we
[43:07] we understand what God has been after we
[43:10] understand who we are and if you don't
[43:13] understand who you are may God help you
[43:18] because Paul would pray uh uh H how did
[43:23] he put that that the spirit I pray that
[43:25] the spirit of wisdom and
[43:27] Revelation uh uh would come and open the
[43:32] eyes of your understanding the the the
[43:34] eyes of your understanding being
[43:36] enlightened that you may know well I I
[43:40] truly believe that's what's happened in
[43:42] this day Paul's prayer has been
[43:45] fulfilled that that the spirit of wisdom
[43:47] and Revelation in the knowledge of Jesus
[43:50] Christ has has has enlightened our
[43:54] understanding and he's here to enlighten
[43:57] it more and and so we we we're
[44:01] understanding who we are we understand
[44:03] the time that we're living in we
[44:07] understand the role that we are to play
[44:10] in this great plan purpose the the great
[44:15] drama of God and so by by our
[44:20] understanding we realize that we are the
[44:24] finale we are the completion of the of
[44:27] God's plan and that's that's to me is uh
[44:31] uh really uh he saved the best for the
[44:34] last and and uh he must have had some
[44:38] confidence in us to be able to choose us
[44:41] for this day you know he didn't choose
[44:44] us for Luther he didn't choose us for
[44:46] any other age but he chose us for the
[44:49] finale and as brother Brandon would say
[44:52] they without us quoting what Paul would
[44:54] say what Paul said they without us us
[44:57] cannot be made perfect so all the pr
[45:00] previous ages they're waiting for us to
[45:04] finish this
[45:05] thing and so uh we're we're in the final
[45:09] stages we're not pushing for another age
[45:11] to come we are it and and so we we we we
[45:17] can't get laxed and we can't you know
[45:20] and and so you know as the prophet would
[45:23] tell us that this is the only time uh
[45:26] for the son of God to be manifested is
[45:29] this time no other time outside of this
[45:32] age has it been that the sons of God are
[45:35] to be made manifest so what is a Son of
[45:39] God well a Son of God is a seed of God
[45:43] and and um we would call it a word seed
[45:48] a Son of God is is a seed of God a word
[45:52] seed and
[45:55] um uh in the eth chapter of Luke Jesus
[46:00] talks of the sewer sewing seed and and
[46:05] in the 11th verse uh he tells us that
[46:08] the seed is the word of God Amen the
[46:12] seed is the word of God and and now we
[46:15] know that the word was spoken before the
[46:18] foundation of the world and and people
[46:22] that don't understand predestination or
[46:24] doesn't believe in these things you you
[46:27] can't understand the plan of God and
[46:28] never can be secure in the plan of God
[46:31] and the purpose of God but God is not
[46:34] planning as we go the plan has already
[46:37] been set it's already been established
[46:40] your destination has already been fixed
[46:43] if we could say it that way and and so
[46:46] Ephesians 1 and one Paul an apostle of
[46:50] Jesus Christ by the will of God not by
[46:52] man but by the will of God to the Saints
[46:55] which are in Ephesus and to the faithful
[46:57] in Christ Jesus Grace be to you and
[47:00] peace from God our Father and from the
[47:02] Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and
[47:05] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha
[47:07] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[47:10] in Heavenly places in Christ according
[47:13] as he hath chosen Us in him before the
[47:17] foundation of the world and and why
[47:20] would he chooses is that we should be
[47:22] holy and Without Blame so he had a
[47:26] purpose and choosing you in Jesus Christ
[47:29] before the foundation of the world you
[47:31] have no accuser against you because he
[47:35] chose us that we might that we should be
[47:38] holy and Without Blame before him in
[47:41] love having
[47:43] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[47:46] children or Sons by Jesus Christ to
[47:49] himself according to the good pleasure
[47:50] of his will so we have been
[47:53] predestinated so if you have been
[47:56] predestined destinated before the
[47:57] foundation of the world then you are a
[48:00] word seed amen that's what sons of God
[48:04] are is word seeds and so uh uh remember
[48:08] every seed uh has a law uh within it um
[48:13] or is under a law and that is to bring
[48:16] forth of its kind you plant a seed uh uh
[48:20] of wheat you wheat seed then then you
[48:23] expect to get a wheat crop a wheat
[48:27] Harvest uh you you plant a a cucumber
[48:30] seed you'll get cucumber if you plant an
[48:33] orange seed you'll get orange amen
[48:36] tomato uh so so it's a it's a law to
[48:39] every seed that every seed is to bring
[48:43] forth of its kind ain't that right so
[48:46] when you look at Christ uh Jesus was the
[48:49] son of God he was a word seed because he
[48:54] was
[48:55] predestinated amen he just didn't come
[48:58] into this world just trying to find his
[49:00] way and trying to find something to do
[49:03] for God he was predestinated his life
[49:06] was ordered of God the Bible says the
[49:09] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[49:11] of the Lord ain't that right and so he
[49:14] was the seed of the woman that God
[49:17] promised would bruise the Serpent's head
[49:21] he was the lamb slain before the
[49:23] foundation of the world he was the
[49:26] prophet that Moses said would come he
[49:29] was the great high priest that the
[49:32] natural high priest typed out ain't that
[49:34] right he was predestinated to rise on
[49:37] the third day so so even his his death
[49:41] Burl and Resurrection all that was
[49:44] already predestinated it was already
[49:46] fixed that's where Jesus did not have to
[49:49] wonder about his future but he would
[49:52] actually tell them destroy this Temple
[49:54] and in 3 days I will will
[49:57] raise it up again amen because he knew
[50:01] who he was he knew he was that word seed
[50:04] ain't that right so he knew he was
[50:07] predestinated to be and to do those
[50:11] things he was he knew he was
[50:14] predestinated to be the lamb he knew he
[50:16] was predestinated to be the sacrifice he
[50:19] knew he was predestinated and notice
[50:21] what the prophet said that's the way he
[50:23] knew the
[50:25] word man when I read that that just
[50:27] struck my heart I thought wow that's the
[50:31] way he knew the word there there you
[50:33] know there there's so many people that
[50:35] that read this Bible and you know year
[50:37] after year they read it you know maybe
[50:40] one time and uh through uh uh the year
[50:43] and and then they'll read it over and
[50:45] some read it you know twice a year all
[50:47] the way through amen but I wonder how
[50:51] they know the word you know is it an
[50:54] intellectual is it is it something that
[50:56] that that come from uh their own idea of
[51:00] what they think the word means or some
[51:03] uh uh uh uh preacher teacher or
[51:06] philosopher but the way Jesus knew the
[51:09] word was different he knew that these
[51:12] promises applied to him he knew that
[51:16] prophecy applied to him that's the way
[51:19] he knew the
[51:20] word and and so he he he read the word
[51:24] and knew that it spoke of him he when he
[51:28] read the word it he could identify
[51:31] himself in that word he was that word
[51:34] seed can you say amen that's the way he
[51:38] knew the word that's the way we should
[51:40] know the word is when we look at the
[51:43] word we see it for us that it applies to
[51:48] us ain't that
[51:50] right that's the way we should know it
[51:53] Jesus even told his critics search the
[51:55] scriptures for they test testify of me
[51:58] the scriptures he knew that the
[52:00] scriptures testified of him they
[52:03] foretold of his life they for told of of
[52:06] the events of his life ain't that right
[52:10] see and so then then when we read the
[52:13] Bible then we want to know the word just
[52:16] that
[52:18] way see we too have been predestinated
[52:21] which means that we are a word seed
[52:25] Romans 8:29 for whom he did Forno he
[52:28] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[52:31] the image of his son that he might be
[52:34] the firstborn among many Brethren
[52:36] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[52:39] he also called and whom he called he
[52:41] also glorified whom he justified them he
[52:43] also glorified ain't that right so so
[52:47] all through the Bible it it testifies of
[52:49] us when you read the the the Rahab the
[52:52] Harlot is it just a story or how do you
[52:54] know that story how do you read that
[52:57] story because you should see yourself
[53:00] there you should see the grace of God
[53:03] that God would show her mercy and that
[53:06] was just a type to let us know that the
[53:09] mercy of God is for
[53:11] us amen uh uh Rahab the Harlot the story
[53:15] of Ruth see amen and and when you read
[53:18] these then you should look at it and
[53:20] know that it's for telling of you it's
[53:24] not just for telling of a people it's
[53:26] for telling of me that's my
[53:29] story God would tell my story through
[53:33] the story of Ruth and the Rahab the
[53:35] Harlot and you read the prophecies in
[53:38] the Bible and and see if it doesn't
[53:40] forell of us in this last
[53:43] day ain't that right see the scriptures
[53:47] testify of
[53:49] us sons of God the scriptures testify of
[53:53] us we're so we're a word seed it's it's
[53:56] it's already been declared who we are
[53:59] it's already been declared our our our
[54:01] our Future's already been declared our
[54:04] present has already been
[54:06] declared and and and to think of it we
[54:09] are the finale of this thing so all
[54:12] those have longed for this day they've
[54:15] longed to see these promises fulfilled
[54:18] and we are the
[54:20] people that are fulfilling them
[54:26] so we are predestinated as Jesus Christ
[54:30] was which makes the word seed flesh in
[54:34] us so it's time for the manifestation of
[54:37] the sons of God do you believe that
[54:39] we're living in the time of the
[54:41] manifestation of sons of God not the
[54:44] time of Sinners and I and I get it you
[54:46] know the world is becoming more wicked
[54:48] and more evil uh uh when you when you
[54:52] just think well how worse can man get it
[54:54] gets worse and then you think
[54:56] wow that's that's bad it can't get any
[54:59] worse and then it gets worse and and so
[55:02] so wickedness is manifesting itself the
[55:05] the wicked has become manifested but
[55:07] it's in this time that the sons of God
[55:11] are to be manifested as
[55:16] well now the word seed couldn't come to
[55:21] maturity back in the beginning or
[55:25] throughout because of being hybrid Adam
[55:28] was the first Son of God you believe
[55:31] that he was the first Son of God and so
[55:34] he was the example of what God wanted
[55:37] his sons to be see sons of God are to
[55:41] have power they're to have
[55:43] authority they they they are to speak
[55:46] and things happen at their word sons of
[55:50] God are they're to rule and have
[55:53] dominion they they are to walk with God
[55:55] and have fellowship with him they are to
[55:58] walk in harmony with God that's what
[56:02] sons of God are not not to fight with
[56:05] God and contradict God and and
[56:08] disbelieve God but but but to come to a
[56:11] place of harmony with God agreement with
[56:13] God power with God Authority with God
[56:18] that's that's sons of God so so and and
[56:22] Harmony exists when man believes God's
[56:24] word so
[56:27] the the manifestation of the sons of God
[56:30] brother Bram talks about it in the
[56:32] adoption series I believe that's what it
[56:35] was but but he says when true men or
[56:38] true Sons born Sons filled Sons speak
[56:43] and their word is
[56:45] backed not backed by some political
[56:48] government backed by God
[56:51] himself when that when we speak and I
[56:53] believe that's happening even now that
[56:56] when when we speak there's a power
[56:58] behind it that's beyond our ability it's
[57:01] God backing it
[57:03] up brother Bram said see say to this
[57:06] mountain let it be so brother I desire
[57:08] so and so a certain thing done I'm a
[57:10] Believer in Jesus Christ well I give it
[57:12] to you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[57:14] Christ see amen there's a manifestation
[57:18] see oh brother my crops are burning up
[57:20] out yonder I haven't had any rain well
[57:22] I'll send you rain in the name of the
[57:24] Lord God bless your crop all waiting
[57:27] groaning all nature waiting for the
[57:29] manifestation of the sons of God God
[57:32] ordained it at the
[57:36] beginning Adam had that Dominion he had
[57:40] that rule he had that Authority that's
[57:42] what God ordained his sons to be at the
[57:47] beginning he said he gave man that
[57:50] domain ain't that right well then then
[57:54] then you look in Genesis
[57:57] 1:27 it says so God created man in his
[58:00] own image in the image of God created he
[58:02] him Mel and female created he them and
[58:06] God blessed them and God said unto them
[58:09] be fruitful and multiply and replenish
[58:12] the Earth and subdue it ain't that right
[58:15] so but how was this multiplication to
[58:18] happen Adam being a Son of God was to
[58:22] reproduce sons of God that he was
[58:27] supposed to multiply himself how was he
[58:30] going to do that by the spoken word see
[58:34] Adam was a spoken word of God which
[58:37] which is the Original Seed of God ain't
[58:39] that right brother brand even preached
[58:41] the sermon you know uh the spoken word
[58:43] is the Original Seed see and so Adam
[58:47] being that spoken word of God see and
[58:50] then he was to multiply multiply and
[58:53] replenish multiply himself
[58:56] but the prophet said the word couldn't
[58:59] find a resting
[59:02] place the word that was supposed to be
[59:06] uh uh uh multiply and
[59:10] replenish it couldn't find a resting
[59:13] place for Eve played the the part of a
[59:15] the prophet would say by doubting
[59:19] everybody say by doubting the word of
[59:23] God the prophet said now Satan's Satan
[59:26] hit Eve's mind in the womb of her mind
[59:30] she doubted God's word then come the
[59:35] actual act so first Satan hit Eve's mind
[59:39] ain't that right what how did he do it
[59:42] he took God's word and reasoned it with
[59:47] Eve he reasoned it he he got Eve to
[59:51] reasoning he started questioning the
[59:53] word he started amen putting question
[59:56] marks on
[59:58] it and and and so brother brah said see
[1:00:01] Eve was a good woman but she didn't
[1:00:04] follow the Commandment to the word just
[1:00:06] reasoned a little with it ain't that
[1:00:08] right he said she didn't just outright
[1:00:11] disbelieve the word she just reasoned
[1:00:15] with something contrary to
[1:00:18] it see so so she just didn't say well
[1:00:21] God's a flat liar and and and I don't
[1:00:24] even believe in God and you know let's
[1:00:26] just all go to the bar and and get some
[1:00:28] whiskey or something like that no she's
[1:00:30] sitting in the Pew we could say it that
[1:00:33] way and and yet she's reasoning God's
[1:00:36] word instead of just saying God's word
[1:00:38] is true get away from me I'm going to
[1:00:41] listen to you she began to listen to
[1:00:44] that
[1:00:47] reasoning brother Bram says anything
[1:00:49] that reasons against the word remember
[1:00:52] that's the enemy anything that reasons
[1:00:56] against the word that's the enemy don't
[1:00:59] you listen to it at all it's got to be
[1:01:02] the word can you say Amen so notice the
[1:01:05] actual act came after Eve disbelieved
[1:01:09] the word of God in the womb of her mind
[1:01:12] so the prophet said see it was a
[1:01:14] spiritual intercourse first it was a
[1:01:16] spiritual intercourse that came by
[1:01:19] believing Satan's lie and receiving that
[1:01:23] lie in the womb of her mind
[1:01:26] and it polluted her soul it set death in
[1:01:30] the soul then the natural act took place
[1:01:33] ain't that right so the result of her
[1:01:36] action was not only a physical death but
[1:01:40] a spiritual death it it caused both
[1:01:42] spiritual and physical death and and the
[1:01:45] prophet said that means that both body
[1:01:47] and spirit of the wicked is going to be
[1:01:50] annihilated both both body and spirit is
[1:01:52] going to be annihilated see and and and
[1:01:55] so then if you think of it if if Eve had
[1:02:00] to receive Satan's lie in the womb of
[1:02:04] her
[1:02:05] mind before something could take place
[1:02:09] then that would only tell us that we
[1:02:12] have to first receive God's word in the
[1:02:16] womb of our mind before something will
[1:02:20] take
[1:02:22] place can you say Amen brother brandham
[1:02:25] said see uh he said the only way that we
[1:02:29] can ever be born again is first in the
[1:02:32] womb of the Mind receive the
[1:02:37] word you don't have to get down and big
[1:02:40] you don't have to get down and beat the
[1:02:42] altar you don't have to T like they did
[1:02:45] on the on the day of Pentecost to
[1:02:47] receive the Holy Ghost they had to do
[1:02:50] that because the the day of pent they
[1:02:52] had to wait for the day of Pentecost all
[1:02:54] the types had to be fulfilled
[1:02:56] but you don't have to T all you have to
[1:02:59] do is receive the word in the room of
[1:03:03] your mind and then the spirit comes on
[1:03:06] top of that and brings it to
[1:03:09] life can you say Amen see this is
[1:03:12] exactly how Jesus was conceived amen see
[1:03:16] his conception was not by a sex act it
[1:03:21] was by the spoken word of God how many
[1:03:23] believes that amen a virgin conceived by
[1:03:28] the spoken word of God see and and and
[1:03:31] if you notice the the Bible if you just
[1:03:34] looking at this what Jesus was in the
[1:03:37] beginning the Bible says that God made
[1:03:40] man after his own image I'm just talking
[1:03:45] on what the sons of God are God made man
[1:03:49] at in his own image after his kind the
[1:03:52] prophet said so what is God John 1 one
[1:03:56] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:03:58] was with God and the Word was God can
[1:04:02] you say that with me the Word was God
[1:04:05] the Word was God ain't that right and he
[1:04:08] made man after his kind see which would
[1:04:12] be the word the prophet said made man
[1:04:15] after his kind the word amen see so he
[1:04:20] said God made Man In His Image after his
[1:04:25] kind
[1:04:26] to express his word on the
[1:04:30] earth amen that's sons of
[1:04:33] God Amen that that would be made after
[1:04:37] his image after his kind to express the
[1:04:40] word uh or his word on the earth so he
[1:04:43] expressed it in Jesus Christ for God was
[1:04:46] in Christ God the word was in Jesus
[1:04:50] Christ do you believe that so the
[1:04:53] prophet said see that's a man after his
[1:04:55] kind
[1:04:56] when God which is the word was in Jesus
[1:04:59] Christ a man a human being amen the word
[1:05:04] expressed itself in him ain't that right
[1:05:09] see he say so if you look back and see
[1:05:12] what he was when he was made flesh
[1:05:14] that's the kind of man he
[1:05:17] makes ain't that right that's the kind
[1:05:20] of man he makes yes sir see that's the
[1:05:24] kind of man another place he says that's
[1:05:27] the kind of man that God makes today is
[1:05:30] is a man that expresses the word of God
[1:05:34] on the
[1:05:36] earth amen see so that's what the
[1:05:40] manifestation of sons is is the word
[1:05:43] being
[1:05:45] expressed ain't that right so if a if a
[1:05:48] man denies the word the prophet said
[1:05:50] then that man is not made in the image
[1:05:53] of God he's not made after his kind if
[1:05:57] he's not if he's sitting there denying
[1:05:59] the word and yet God wants us to express
[1:06:03] his word how can you express it when we
[1:06:06] deny it so we must not deny it a ain't
[1:06:10] that right see so he says how can you be
[1:06:13] in God's image and deny God's word when
[1:06:16] the word is expressed image of himself
[1:06:20] so he says when God calls a man he's in
[1:06:24] his own image
[1:06:26] the word Made Alive in him God calling a
[1:06:31] man God calling a
[1:06:33] woman God calling
[1:06:36] children amen why did he call him that
[1:06:39] the word could be made alive in
[1:06:42] them ain't that right see he says that's
[1:06:46] right see there he is that's God's man
[1:06:50] man in his own image in his very
[1:06:53] likeness and Jesus being the express
[1:06:56] word said that he'll do the works that I
[1:07:00] do ain't that right who's going to do
[1:07:03] them works the sons of
[1:07:06] God that the word can flow
[1:07:12] through you know
[1:07:14] we many times people settle down just to
[1:07:18] shouting and they call that good
[1:07:20] times and we believe in
[1:07:23] shouting they they settled down to to
[1:07:26] you know fast music or or you know
[1:07:30] dancing or speaking in tongues or gifts
[1:07:33] or being operated we and we believe in
[1:07:36] all of
[1:07:38] that but but that doesn't make us sons
[1:07:40] of
[1:07:42] God it's when the whole word is being
[1:07:45] expressed through
[1:07:47] us can you say amen that's the Son of
[1:07:50] God now in the Old Testament David said
[1:07:54] Thy word have I hid in my heart that I
[1:07:57] sin not against thee so he's he's saying
[1:08:00] that David's saying that and we know
[1:08:01] that that the spirit of God came up on
[1:08:04] him he had a portion but notice what
[1:08:07] what D what brother Braham said about
[1:08:08] that Thy word have I hid in my heart
[1:08:10] that I sin not against thee he said the
[1:08:13] only thing David needed was the
[1:08:16] rain and he said David would have been
[1:08:18] all right if he could just had that rain
[1:08:21] but the Holy Ghost wasn't given yet he
[1:08:24] had the word and the Word was in him and
[1:08:28] he could know it he knew it see he said
[1:08:30] I've hid it in My Heart Lord but it it
[1:08:34] won't bloom out and act like it should
[1:08:37] but I've hid it there Lord I've HD it
[1:08:38] there but when Jesus come which was the
[1:08:42] word made manifest took the germ of life
[1:08:45] out of it and brings it back to the word
[1:08:48] now so we're not like David hiding the
[1:08:51] word in our heart knowing that word and
[1:08:54] and and and and and yet it's not
[1:08:56] blooming
[1:08:58] out can you say Amen we're talking about
[1:09:02] manifestation of sons of
[1:09:04] God so here Jesus Christ being the seed
[1:09:08] word an expressed word of God upon the
[1:09:12] Earth well what was he Colossians
[1:09:17] 1:15 uh I believe Paul says he is the
[1:09:20] image of the invisible God the firstborn
[1:09:23] of every creature brother brandham said
[1:09:26] he is the visible image of the invisible
[1:09:29] God he was the visible image of the
[1:09:34] invisible
[1:09:35] God ain't that right Hebrews 1:3 says he
[1:09:40] is the expressed image of his person he
[1:09:44] was the very Express image couldn't get
[1:09:47] any any more clearer than that so much
[1:09:50] so that he you you all know the
[1:09:52] scripture where Philip says you know he
[1:09:53] show us the father it was a is and Jesus
[1:09:56] says have I not been have I been so long
[1:09:58] with you and you still don't know me he
[1:10:01] that has seen me has seen the
[1:10:04] father he was the express image not two
[1:10:08] people in the
[1:10:10] godhead one God in a human
[1:10:15] body can you say
[1:10:18] Amen so so therefore God is the word so
[1:10:23] Jesus Christ was God's expressed
[1:10:26] word expressed image expressed word
[1:10:29] ain't that right so brother Bram says
[1:10:32] now what are we to be sons of God
[1:10:35] everybody say sons of God what are we to
[1:10:38] be sons of God too with the expressed
[1:10:42] word in the church carrying
[1:10:46] on ain't that right that's the mystical
[1:10:49] Body of Christ carrying on the same
[1:10:52] works that Jesus did when he was here on
[1:10:55] Earth Earth that's the kind after his
[1:10:58] kind now you can have the Lutheran kind
[1:11:01] after the Lutheran the Methodist kind
[1:11:04] after the Methodist the Catholic kind
[1:11:05] after the Catholic the Pentecostal kind
[1:11:08] after its kind the Oneness after its
[1:11:11] kind the Trinity after its kind but if
[1:11:14] you're God's kind that's different
[1:11:16] you're the expressed image of the word
[1:11:19] making itself
[1:11:22] manifest ain't that right
[1:11:27] so that I hope not confusing you too
[1:11:31] much but second Corinthians
[1:11:34] 3:18 it says but we all with open face
[1:11:38] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[1:11:41] Lord are
[1:11:43] changed into the same
[1:11:47] image we beholding the glory of the Lord
[1:11:50] are changed into that same image from
[1:11:54] Glory to Glory even as by the spirit of
[1:11:58] the
[1:11:59] Lord so if you go back to Adam Adam God
[1:12:03] intended for Adam to bring forth sons of
[1:12:07] God and he forfeited his rights to do
[1:12:11] so he forfeit his rights to this amen
[1:12:16] the prophet said when he send the holy
[1:12:18] image of God left them and
[1:12:22] so God raised up another Adam
[1:12:26] we would call him the second Adam we'
[1:12:28] call him the last Adam but God raised up
[1:12:32] another Adam that would bring forth what
[1:12:36] God wanted and that is sons of
[1:12:41] God
[1:12:43] Amen so so this
[1:12:47] Adam would have to do the work of
[1:12:51] redemption ain't that right so so the
[1:12:55] the first Adam was created by the spoken
[1:12:57] word The Original Seed then then Christ
[1:13:02] the second
[1:13:04] Adam could only be come forth by the
[1:13:07] spoken word The Original Seed ain't that
[1:13:11] right so brother brand said see the
[1:13:13] first son was spoken was spoken seed
[1:13:16] word of God the Second Son a spoken seed
[1:13:19] word of God see anytime that God has
[1:13:23] Sons they are going to become forth by
[1:13:25] the spoken word seed of
[1:13:28] God a ain't that right see so so the
[1:13:33] second Adam was created in the womb of a
[1:13:37] woman ain't that right but notice how
[1:13:40] did that happen how did this creation
[1:13:43] come brother Brandon would say Mary's
[1:13:45] womb the physical mind was virgin womb
[1:13:50] why she believed God's
[1:13:53] word evees mind was not virgin because
[1:13:57] she had allowed Satan to come in and
[1:13:59] pollute
[1:14:01] her but Mary her mind was
[1:14:05] virgin she just simply believed God's
[1:14:08] word she didn't try to mix God's word up
[1:14:11] she didn't try to take something for
[1:14:14] substitute she just simply believed it
[1:14:17] that's right ain't that right so she
[1:14:20] believed God's word no matter how much
[1:14:22] anybody criticized and how many things
[1:14:25] somebody else said that didn't have one
[1:14:28] thing to do with it she believed God's
[1:14:31] word
[1:14:33] regardless aren't you glad for that she
[1:14:36] just believed God's word regardless see
[1:14:40] so now when we talk about the mind we're
[1:14:42] not talking
[1:14:44] intellectual see we're not talking about
[1:14:46] intellectual mind brother Ram said it's
[1:14:48] the womb of your heart see so so the
[1:14:53] Bible says as a man thinketh in in his
[1:14:55] heart so is he as a man thinketh in his
[1:14:59] heart so it's not the intellectual side
[1:15:01] of it it's in the heart so so Medical
[1:15:05] Science the prophet said found that in
[1:15:07] the center of the human heart is a teeny
[1:15:09] little place that don't have blood cells
[1:15:12] or anything around it and they claim is
[1:15:14] the occupation of the Soul see so he
[1:15:19] says from the heart comes forth the
[1:15:22] thought his soul not from his mind but
[1:15:25] from his soul something that tells that
[1:15:28] it's right and if it's contrary to the
[1:15:31] word something tells him it's wrong see
[1:15:35] it's right down here in the
[1:15:38] soul can you say man so before the the
[1:15:42] the the ACT could ever take uh took
[1:15:45] place in the literal womb of Mary the
[1:15:49] ACT had to take place down in her her
[1:15:53] mind or in that soul that she would
[1:15:55] believe God's word count it as though it
[1:15:58] already
[1:16:00] happened God's word found a resting
[1:16:04] place it could not find it in
[1:16:08] Eve but it found it in in in in
[1:16:12] Mary and it brought forth the Son of
[1:16:16] God the Son of
[1:16:18] God the second Adam can you say Amen see
[1:16:23] so so before before the act ever took
[1:16:26] place in the literal womb of Mary the
[1:16:28] ACT had to take place in her mind first
[1:16:30] of all to let the Spirit come in to do
[1:16:34] the rest of the work she believed it she
[1:16:38] didn't have to try to figure it out she
[1:16:41] didn't have to try to make it happen she
[1:16:44] didn't have to go around wandering and
[1:16:45] and seeing if what who else would
[1:16:47] believe her and and and and find some
[1:16:50] doctor that would agree with it she just
[1:16:53] believed it and let the spirit do the
[1:16:56] rest of it and that's the way you got to
[1:16:58] do it you just got to believe it I don't
[1:17:01] care what it looks like I don't care how
[1:17:03] impossible just believe the word and let
[1:17:05] the spirit of God do the
[1:17:11] rest so so here was Mary the word found
[1:17:14] that resting place she said behold the
[1:17:17] the hands maiden of the Lord be it unto
[1:17:20] me according to Thy
[1:17:22] word she did what Eve should have
[1:17:27] done and the birth of every Son of God
[1:17:32] has to be that
[1:17:34] way you believe
[1:17:36] it yeah you got to be born
[1:17:40] Sons got to be born
[1:17:42] sons in John 3:3 Jesus said to Nicodemus
[1:17:45] verily verily I say unto thee except a
[1:17:48] man be born again he cannot see the
[1:17:50] kingdom of
[1:17:51] God we call it the new birth
[1:17:54] ain't that right and you look up the
[1:17:58] word birth it means
[1:18:00] creation so a birth is is literally a
[1:18:04] it's a creation so New Birth New
[1:18:08] Creation New Birth brings about New
[1:18:11] Creation second Corinthians 5:17
[1:18:15] therefore If any man be in Christ he is
[1:18:17] a new creature a new creation he's had a
[1:18:21] new birth old things are passed way
[1:18:25] behold all things are become new can you
[1:18:27] say Amen so then Adam Adam forfeited his
[1:18:31] rights amen and could not bring forth
[1:18:34] all he brought forth is Sons of Adam
[1:18:36] sons of Adam ain't that right amen uh of
[1:18:39] the adamic race and we're all born
[1:18:41] Sinners we're all born uh with a carnal
[1:18:44] nature doomed for hell if it had not
[1:18:47] been for the grace of God but God was
[1:18:50] determined that there would be sons of
[1:18:53] God upon the Earth
[1:18:56] that he could express himself
[1:19:01] through we never got that being born
[1:19:03] from a natural aspect we were defeated
[1:19:07] we were born
[1:19:08] defeated born with complexes born with
[1:19:11] illnesses born with
[1:19:16] whatever and you say
[1:19:19] Amen but why must we be born again is
[1:19:22] because our first birth came by a
[1:19:24] natural natural
[1:19:25] act through holy the prophet said
[1:19:28] through holy wedlock your mother and
[1:19:30] father had to do with you coming on the
[1:19:33] earth then he calls it an act of carnal
[1:19:38] knowledge ain't that right and through
[1:19:41] there again we were conceived in sin
[1:19:43] shaping in iniquity come to the world
[1:19:46] speaking lies and God did never intended
[1:19:50] the perfect will of God now speaking God
[1:19:52] never intended for his sons to come that
[1:19:56] way into this
[1:19:58] world and he hasn't changed his mind
[1:20:01] about
[1:20:03] it ain't that right that's why Satan's
[1:20:06] doing everything he can to keep people
[1:20:10] away from a new
[1:20:14] birth get him to join a church get them
[1:20:16] to site a Creed get them to just become
[1:20:21] religious but sons of God have to be
[1:20:24] born born
[1:20:26] sons and you're not born Sons just
[1:20:29] because you come from a Christian
[1:20:31] family you're not born children of God
[1:20:35] just because daddy was a preacher or a
[1:20:37] deacon or singer or
[1:20:40] whatever it's a new
[1:20:42] birth can you say Amen a new birth every
[1:20:46] Son of God has to be born by the
[1:20:48] creative spoken word of God how many
[1:20:51] believes that you got to be born by the
[1:20:53] spoken word word the creative word of
[1:20:57] God first Peter 1:23 being born again
[1:21:01] not of corruptible seed that by carnal
[1:21:04] knowledge see but of Incorruptible by
[1:21:07] the word of God which liveth and abideth
[1:21:10] forever ain't that right see so so why
[1:21:15] God God sent the second
[1:21:17] Adam To Be Our Redeemer to send his
[1:21:21] Spirit back upon us why to bring forth
[1:21:24] manifestation God's after manifestation
[1:21:27] of sons of God ain't that right after
[1:21:31] manifestation see so
[1:21:34] now you know this might be simple but
[1:21:37] the new birth does not require us to go
[1:21:39] back into our mother's womb remember oh
[1:21:42] Nicodemus when Jesus said a man must be
[1:21:43] born again you know there John 3:4 he
[1:21:46] said well how can a man be born when
[1:21:48] he's old can he enter into the second
[1:21:51] time into his mother's womb and be born
[1:21:54] but that's not the birth Jesus is
[1:21:56] talking about he's talking about a
[1:21:58] spiritual birth that has to happen ain't
[1:22:01] that right well what does that mean that
[1:22:03] means that predestinated word seed must
[1:22:07] be
[1:22:09] quickened there is a word seed down in
[1:22:13] the side of us every elect of God every
[1:22:16] predestinated of God that's the real you
[1:22:19] brother
[1:22:22] Bill and it must be Quicken so there can
[1:22:26] be no manifestation of sons of God
[1:22:28] without the word
[1:22:30] birth can you say Amen
[1:22:34] so brother Braham said as the Eternal
[1:22:37] logos God was manifest in the Sun and in
[1:22:40] in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the
[1:22:42] godhead
[1:22:43] bodily and that Eternal one was the
[1:22:46] father manifest in flesh and thereby
[1:22:49] gained the title of son even so we
[1:22:51] Eternal in his thoughts in our turn
[1:22:55] became the many membered spoken word
[1:22:58] seed manifest in flesh and those Eternal
[1:23:02] thoughts now manifest in flesh are the
[1:23:05] sons of
[1:23:06] God even as we are so called we did not
[1:23:11] become seed by the rebirth we were seed
[1:23:15] and therefore were reborn for only the
[1:23:19] elect can be
[1:23:20] reborn because we were seed is the
[1:23:23] reason we could be quickened for in
[1:23:26] nonseed there is nothing to Quicken so
[1:23:29] not everyone can be born again ain't
[1:23:32] that right amen see so if you notice
[1:23:37] before before the spiritual birth can
[1:23:39] take place what had to happen the word
[1:23:42] had to find a resting place in our mind
[1:23:46] in our heart where we just believed it
[1:23:50] ain't that right amen uh John 5 5 24
[1:23:55] Jesus said verily verily I say unto you
[1:23:57] he that heareth my word and believeth on
[1:23:59] him that sent me hath everlasting life
[1:24:03] and shall not come into
[1:24:06] condemnation or brother brand said Great
[1:24:08] Tribulation see but is passed from Death
[1:24:11] un life ain't that right so a man has to
[1:24:16] be or has to have a virgin
[1:24:21] mind a virgin mind
[1:24:24] to believe God's
[1:24:26] word what what what caused Mary to
[1:24:29] believe I think this is important now
[1:24:32] brother Bram said her mother through her
[1:24:35] lips planted a seed in Mary's heart
[1:24:38] other words she she prepared Mary's
[1:24:41] heart to receive it kept all that doubt
[1:24:45] away from
[1:24:46] her and M Mary's mother through her lips
[1:24:50] planted a seed in Mary's heart and she
[1:24:52] saw it in the word of God Isaiah 9:6
[1:24:56] Behold a virgin shall
[1:25:00] conceive see how important that is that
[1:25:03] we would we don't try to dissect this
[1:25:06] message we don't try to even if you
[1:25:08] don't understand it it if if it's if God
[1:25:12] said it it's got to be
[1:25:14] true prepare the
[1:25:21] hearts can you say Amen see see then the
[1:25:25] word took
[1:25:27] flesh the word became flesh see so so
[1:25:33] you know uh uh brother Bram would say
[1:25:36] you know Eve received the devil's lie in
[1:25:38] the womb of her mind and brought
[1:25:41] death Mary received the word of God in
[1:25:45] the womb of her mind and brought forth
[1:25:47] eternal
[1:25:48] life ain't that right two different
[1:25:51] women or we could say two different
[1:25:52] churches
[1:25:54] am two two different all together one
[1:25:59] receives the the devil's
[1:26:01] lie in the womb of her her soul her
[1:26:06] mind and she doubts it and brings forth
[1:26:11] death the other brings forth or receives
[1:26:15] the word of God in the
[1:26:18] womb and brings forth eternal
[1:26:21] life now notice uh first thessal ionians
[1:26:26] 2:13 Paul would say for this cause also
[1:26:29] thank we god without ceasing because
[1:26:31] when we when you receive the word of God
[1:26:34] which you heard of us you received it
[1:26:38] not as the word of men but as it is in
[1:26:43] truth the word of God notice which
[1:26:47] effectively worketh also in you that
[1:26:51] belief you see the difference some just
[1:26:55] don't have the word of God working in
[1:26:57] them others have the word of God simply
[1:27:00] because one receives it as being the
[1:27:03] word of
[1:27:04] Truth and they believe it and the word
[1:27:08] becomes effective just like it did in
[1:27:11] Mary can you say Amen see so brother
[1:27:14] Brown said see the word takes flesh
[1:27:17] there you are God is going to have a
[1:27:20] church do you believe that God God is
[1:27:24] going to have a church I say he has a
[1:27:27] church we're part of that church but
[1:27:31] notice it's going to be born of the word
[1:27:35] of God because it is the Living Word of
[1:27:39] God can you say Amen see so the word is
[1:27:43] taken form by somebody believing it the
[1:27:46] word is finding a resting
[1:27:50] place in the hearts of a people here on
[1:27:53] this Earth
[1:27:57] Earth he said how you know it you know
[1:28:00] what you're going to be called from this
[1:28:02] on he said you're just going to be
[1:28:04] called he goes I don't care what I'm
[1:28:06] called that has nothing about it be it
[1:28:08] unto me according to the word of the
[1:28:09] Lord oh could everybody say that today
[1:28:12] see if people could really from your
[1:28:14] heart all of us could say that be it
[1:28:17] unto me according to Thy word Lord see
[1:28:19] my really mean it see one or two or
[1:28:22] somewhere out in the there it's going to
[1:28:25] pick up some
[1:28:26] predestinated that really means that can
[1:28:29] you say amen amen mean that from your
[1:28:32] heart see he says and brother you're
[1:28:34] going to see the sparks flying right
[1:28:36] then that's right when you really got
[1:28:39] that there to meet that what's coming
[1:28:42] that irrigation begins to fall on that
[1:28:45] word
[1:28:47] amen I I again I I pray that you can see
[1:28:50] the importance of God sending a prophet
[1:28:53] to us
[1:28:55] see God would send us a
[1:28:57] prophet uh because there would be a
[1:29:01] people that would so dearly appreciate
[1:29:03] it and they needed it we we needed it
[1:29:07] see and he would send it at the time
[1:29:09] that the sons of God were to be
[1:29:12] manifested see and and so it it's a
[1:29:15] blessing to us to be able to hear and
[1:29:18] not only to hear the words of a prophet
[1:29:21] and to read the the the books and things
[1:29:25] like that but the the most privilege is
[1:29:27] to be able to receive the message that
[1:29:29] he
[1:29:30] brought and brother bradam Mari told us
[1:29:34] that we're not like Eve you know uh but
[1:29:38] but this bride ain't going to do like
[1:29:40] Eve did right but she's going to accept
[1:29:43] that word she she's she's she's virgin
[1:29:47] see only to him only to him see so
[1:29:52] now God would have and Prophet see
[1:29:55] because there's no
[1:29:57] denomination there's no denomination
[1:29:59] that could bring forth a word
[1:30:02] birth remember denomination is part of
[1:30:05] the Harlot system she's the Harlot uh
[1:30:08] she's the daughter to the mother
[1:30:10] and uh you know the Bible says the
[1:30:14] prophet speaks about it there in
[1:30:15] Revelations 13 you know that it's that
[1:30:19] she makes an image to the Beast which
[1:30:23] you know is the c Catholic church and
[1:30:25] and it's the you know it's the
[1:30:26] confederation of churches and and all
[1:30:28] these things and she had a cup in her
[1:30:31] hand giving out her Doctrine to the
[1:30:33] people the prophet says and which was an
[1:30:36] Abomination the filthiness of her
[1:30:38] fornication ain't that right so this is
[1:30:41] what the Bible says about this Harlot
[1:30:42] system she's got a she's got a cup of
[1:30:45] wine and and she's she's giv it out to
[1:30:47] the people which brother Bram said
[1:30:49] that's her Doctrine you see and
[1:30:51] fornication means unclean living so
[1:30:54] she's a harlot she's a horde she's she
[1:30:56] just defiled and and Revelation 17:2
[1:31:00] would tell us that the kings of the
[1:31:02] Earth have committed fornication with
[1:31:04] her see and and the inhabitants of the
[1:31:07] Earth have been made drunk with the wine
[1:31:09] of her fornication and the prophet said
[1:31:11] what that is is the church has opened
[1:31:13] her mind and has received all kinds of
[1:31:16] Creeds and all kinds of dogmas and not
[1:31:19] the word of God so back to Eve again she
[1:31:23] opened her mind up to Satan's lie and
[1:31:26] received it and the word could not find
[1:31:29] a resting place and and therefore the
[1:31:32] sons of God could not be manifested uh
[1:31:35] in in that time and and We Know It the
[1:31:38] purpose was and so but here's the church
[1:31:40] again that is is denomination and and
[1:31:44] and even brother brand even applied that
[1:31:46] to non- denominations a lot of your
[1:31:49] organiz non- organizations or
[1:31:51] denominations are all in the same boat
[1:31:54] they're they're teaching the uh the the
[1:31:56] they've received of her wine a
[1:31:59] fornication see and brother brand said
[1:32:01] she calls herself the bride of Christ
[1:32:04] but but the material that she's made up
[1:32:06] of is organization and not of the word
[1:32:10] ain't that right see sons of God the the
[1:32:13] material they're made up of is word is
[1:32:16] the word see so he she has enough word
[1:32:19] in it to make her a byproduct or
[1:32:22] hypocritical see so so therefore the son
[1:32:25] of man could not be revealed in there
[1:32:28] son of man could not be revealed in in
[1:32:31] in in denominations and and all of that
[1:32:34] see see because the the the the word
[1:32:38] when the son of man is the word being
[1:32:41] made
[1:32:42] manifest the son of man see being God
[1:32:46] becomes material as the word is made
[1:32:48] manifest God becomes material how many
[1:32:52] believes that as the word becomes
[1:32:55] manifest stay with that word no wonder
[1:32:57] the prophet said stay with the word
[1:32:58] return to the word as the word of God is
[1:33:01] made manifest God himself becomes
[1:33:07] material see so then the manifestation
[1:33:12] of the sons of God is actually the word
[1:33:15] being
[1:33:16] expressed which is God becoming
[1:33:19] material God becoming material that's
[1:33:23] why the prophet would tell us deity is
[1:33:24] not in heaven deity is in you God
[1:33:27] becoming
[1:33:28] material it's such a relationship with
[1:33:31] God sons of God coming back to what God
[1:33:35] intended for
[1:33:37] them can you say
[1:33:39] Amen so it would take a prophet to bring
[1:33:43] forth a word birth in this
[1:33:47] age amen see because the prophet said
[1:33:51] this the word is going to produce Sons
[1:33:54] and Daughters of
[1:33:55] God not
[1:33:58] programs not going back in memory and
[1:34:00] having you know Christmas plays Easter
[1:34:03] Plays and all that nothing against that
[1:34:05] and and just but that has nothing to do
[1:34:07] with producing
[1:34:09] Sons the word is going to produce Sons
[1:34:12] and Daughters of
[1:34:14] God ain't that right so then for that to
[1:34:18] happen is God only promised to send this
[1:34:22] one prophet
[1:34:25] Malachi
[1:34:27] 4 one major
[1:34:31] prophet and that would be the Prophet
[1:34:33] Elijah right spoke of in Malachi 4 what
[1:34:37] was he to do he was to turn our hearts
[1:34:39] back to the Living Word of the Living
[1:34:42] God and this prophet of Malachi 4 as we
[1:34:46] know if you believe the message and know
[1:34:47] the message it's he's he's the same as
[1:34:51] what John saw being the seven
[1:34:55] Angel Malachi wrote of a prophet
[1:34:59] coming Elijah the
[1:35:02] prophet John sees that same
[1:35:06] prophet and said he's the seventh
[1:35:09] angel we didn't know that until the
[1:35:12] message and tied it together for us we
[1:35:16] would have thought been two different
[1:35:17] people two different Ministries and we
[1:35:19] find out it's all in the same Ministry
[1:35:23] ain't that right so Revelations 10:7 but
[1:35:26] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:35:28] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[1:35:30] mystery of God should be finished in
[1:35:32] other words it should be revealed the
[1:35:34] word would
[1:35:37] return ain't that right as he had
[1:35:40] declared to his servants the prophets
[1:35:42] and then the prophet would tell us that
[1:35:44] the seventh angel is on Earth at the
[1:35:46] same time of the coming of the mighty
[1:35:49] angel of Revelations
[1:35:51] 10:1 right when that Mighty Angel which
[1:35:55] is Christ The Covenant amen uh uh Angel
[1:35:59] Christ came down with an open book in
[1:36:01] his hand if you remember in in
[1:36:03] Revelations the fth chapter the lamb
[1:36:05] comes forth takes the book of redemption
[1:36:07] that is sealed with Seven Seals from the
[1:36:10] hand of him who sat on the throne and he
[1:36:12] breaks the seals then you find that in
[1:36:16] Revelations 10:1 the mighty angel coming
[1:36:19] with an open book not closed coming down
[1:36:21] and the prophet said see he took the
[1:36:23] book Glory opened the book tore off the
[1:36:26] seals and sent it down to the Earth to a
[1:36:29] seventh angel to reveal it to his people
[1:36:32] he says there you are oh my what
[1:36:34] happened the screams the shouts the
[1:36:36] Hallelujah the anointed the power the
[1:36:38] glory the
[1:36:39] manifestation one place brother Brown
[1:36:41] said we do have today by God's help the
[1:36:44] perfect
[1:36:45] interpretation everybody say it with me
[1:36:47] the perfect
[1:36:49] interpretation of the word with Divine
[1:36:52] vindication can you say Amen so we don't
[1:36:56] have to wait for another Prophet to come
[1:36:58] we're not looking for an eighth
[1:36:59] Messenger to come what we have is the
[1:37:05] word that is is is pure to produce Sons
[1:37:10] and Daughters of
[1:37:11] God to bring a manifestation of
[1:37:15] sons there could be no manifestation of
[1:37:18] sons had not the Prophet come with a
[1:37:21] perfect
[1:37:22] word people want to dissect that word I
[1:37:26] I'll be the first to tell you I don't
[1:37:27] understand everything brother Brenham
[1:37:29] said there's things that seems to be
[1:37:32] contradictory but I do know that God
[1:37:35] Vindicated it I do know it's been so
[1:37:38] Vindicated that it's taken all the
[1:37:40] questions away and I just believe what
[1:37:43] he
[1:37:44] said some things you you might ask me to
[1:37:47] explain I may not be able to explain it
[1:37:50] but I just know it's got to be right
[1:37:53] someone where it's got to
[1:37:55] fit because it's been supernaturally
[1:37:59] it's been scientifically it's been
[1:38:01] scripturally
[1:38:04] Vindicated can you say Amen see so the
[1:38:09] perfect
[1:38:10] interpretation of the word has been
[1:38:12] restored to us now watch the message the
[1:38:16] prophet said is to bring back the word
[1:38:20] bring the people back to the word birth
[1:38:24] is to
[1:38:25] be she's to be delivered of a new birth
[1:38:30] from According to Malachi 4 can you say
[1:38:35] Amen so he says in all these years of
[1:38:37] denominations finally finally God has
[1:38:41] bred his church back to the Holy Ghost
[1:38:43] again I'm so glad to be in it let the
[1:38:46] old seeds and carnality die out become a
[1:38:50] new creature in Christ Jesus we're
[1:38:52] sitting together today in Heavenly
[1:38:54] places in Christ Jesus the Holy Spirit
[1:38:56] breeding out he said I'm so glad of that
[1:38:59] breeding out all doubts breeding out
[1:39:02] isms breeding in himself sons of God not
[1:39:07] breeding back mules and Crossing it up
[1:39:09] but breeding Sons and Daughters of God
[1:39:12] that don't look at the word and stick
[1:39:14] out their ear ears and say well my
[1:39:16] mother was
[1:39:17] Presbyterian well that's all right but
[1:39:19] we need first to make us Sons and
[1:39:21] Daughters of God reading out the
[1:39:24] unbelief and the Creeds and things and
[1:39:26] bringing us back to the original sons of
[1:39:29] God by the Holy Ghost that's exactly
[1:39:32] that's what the church is in the process
[1:39:35] of doing today I say she's
[1:39:38] here I just believe it I I I I just
[1:39:41] believe
[1:39:45] that sons of
[1:39:48] God brother Braham said as God in his
[1:39:51] word made manifest in a man man a
[1:39:54] perfect man so is God and His word
[1:39:57] coming again and making himself
[1:39:59] manifested in a bride not will do like
[1:40:02] Eve did hybrid it to something else but
[1:40:04] the unadulterated word of God will be
[1:40:06] born into that church and she'll stand
[1:40:09] like Jesus Christ did a Son of
[1:40:13] God with his Spirit anointing in his
[1:40:16] word can you say Amen so in one place
[1:40:19] brother Brown said don't you ever let
[1:40:22] somebody squeeze something into you
[1:40:24] that's not thus sayith the
[1:40:26] Lord another place he says now Christ is
[1:40:29] now taken himself a bride to be
[1:40:31] pregnated with his own seed word in her
[1:40:34] womb Spirit womb in her mind and won't
[1:40:36] mix with any the denominational trust
[1:40:39] with it she is Virgin to him ain't that
[1:40:43] right you see
[1:40:45] Sons I
[1:40:47] am a son of Duran and and jerlene Martin
[1:40:54] I was
[1:40:56] born I am of their seed right and that's
[1:41:01] what makes me a
[1:41:03] Martin there two
[1:41:07] agreements brother BR would say it this
[1:41:09] way their two agreements with their
[1:41:11] sperm Together made a
[1:41:15] seed and that's what made
[1:41:18] me your parents that's what made
[1:41:21] you is you're of their their
[1:41:24] seed now notice now so that that would
[1:41:27] have to
[1:41:28] be what a Son of God is it's not just
[1:41:31] speak I'm a Son of God and you're just
[1:41:34] speaking it
[1:41:37] like that you you got to literally
[1:41:40] become this it's literally sons of God
[1:41:44] Daughters of God so brother Bram says
[1:41:46] see when God and His word becomes
[1:41:51] one see when God God's spirit Waters the
[1:41:55] seed of God the word of God it produces
[1:41:59] God see where we're at the manifestation
[1:42:02] of sons of God we're we're we we've come
[1:42:06] to a place where it's producing
[1:42:09] God in
[1:42:11] flesh God becoming
[1:42:15] material see he says it's not the
[1:42:17] individual it's God for you are dead
[1:42:21] you're you're not yourself no more
[1:42:24] you you you reckon Yourself Dead
[1:42:26] hallowed out waiting for the seed germ
[1:42:29] then what is it it isn't you no more
[1:42:32] isn't the man it's God in the man it's
[1:42:35] the seed germ like the beginning spoken
[1:42:38] word it's God's word made manifest in
[1:42:42] the man then it isn't the man it's a man
[1:42:45] that's died he can't be a hybrid and a
[1:42:48] son at the same time he's either a son
[1:42:51] of death or son of life if he's the son
[1:42:54] of death give over to God and let him
[1:42:56] kill the devil that's in you run him out
[1:42:58] see Hallows you out then let God plant
[1:43:01] his own life in you then it's not you no
[1:43:04] more it's God's life because it's God's
[1:43:07] word watered by the holy spirit will
[1:43:10] produce the same
[1:43:13] thing you love
[1:43:16] him see so we no longer live by our
[1:43:19] natural
[1:43:21] birth you you might have developed
[1:43:23] Habits by your natural birth you you
[1:43:25] might have developed uh uh the genes of
[1:43:29] of of head what uh
[1:43:32] hereditary uh things that come through
[1:43:34] that blood line but but brother Bram
[1:43:37] says you know when and and just
[1:43:38] paraphrase it now but something to the
[1:43:40] effect when you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:43:42] then your sexual blood is
[1:43:44] dismissed see when that Holy life when
[1:43:47] God's life comes in you then then that
[1:43:49] sexual life is dismissed
[1:43:53] then you're not born defeated you're not
[1:43:55] born a a vagabond you're you're no
[1:43:57] longer acting like one and talking like
[1:44:00] one and talk and defeat and all that you
[1:44:02] are a son of
[1:44:06] God no longer do you just knck down to
[1:44:09] the devil and you just become a slave to
[1:44:11] everything he offers
[1:44:14] you people so afraid to confess things
[1:44:18] uh uh uh the promises of God because
[1:44:21] they think well I'm just a failure I'm
[1:44:23] just this I'm just that but if you've
[1:44:25] got the life of God in you you are a son
[1:44:27] of God and you live by
[1:44:30] that and the only way you live by it is
[1:44:32] by the word you live by the
[1:44:34] word by believing it can you say Amen so
[1:44:38] so so can it be can it be this way you
[1:44:42] know well again it can be it it can to
[1:44:45] where the same Christ of yesterday can
[1:44:48] be the same Christ of today and and and
[1:44:52] Christ did not leave when brother
[1:44:54] brandham left this
[1:44:56] Earth I I just don't believe that I I I
[1:45:00] thank God for what God done in brother
[1:45:02] brandom I thank God for the stories I I
[1:45:04] I love to hear them stories I'll never
[1:45:07] get tired of hearing what happened what
[1:45:08] God done in that Ministry but I'm not
[1:45:11] sitting here painting a god of yesterday
[1:45:14] trying to get warmed by that God I
[1:45:16] realize that God sent a message to bring
[1:45:19] me a word birth
[1:45:23] breathe out all that unbelief breathe
[1:45:25] out all of that traditional teaching
[1:45:28] breathe out all of these things to where
[1:45:31] I can just stay with what God Said God
[1:45:34] said it I believe
[1:45:36] it you believe
[1:45:43] that so the word that God spoke be
[1:45:46] fruitful and
[1:45:48] multiply it it it couldn't find a
[1:45:50] resting place in the beginning
[1:45:54] but then that word
[1:45:56] caught into the womb of a virgin and the
[1:45:59] second adom came forth and notice from
[1:46:02] him came forth The Germ life that the
[1:46:05] thing that gives see the water that
[1:46:08] gives the kernel is chance to reproduce
[1:46:11] itself the Spirit came out of him and
[1:46:13] went up and here we are we come along
[1:46:16] and what happens we believe
[1:46:19] it we believe it ain't that right so so
[1:46:23] in John 14:12 Jesus said he that
[1:46:25] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:46:27] shall he do also and Greater Works than
[1:46:29] the shall he do now you just pardon me
[1:46:34] but there's a teaching and I just I just
[1:46:37] think it's a sign of unbelief but where
[1:46:40] the teaching is that that is only
[1:46:42] applying to brother
[1:46:43] brandham and I was told that that that
[1:46:46] that only applies to brother brandham he
[1:46:47] that believeth on me the works shall he
[1:46:51] do that was brother br
[1:46:54] and I thought I don't think so so I went
[1:46:58] and looked it up and brother Bram said
[1:47:00] that's the
[1:47:01] believer that's the believer well that's
[1:47:06] me that's the Believers in this
[1:47:09] building the works that he did you not
[1:47:13] can you shall
[1:47:16] do you shall do can you say Amen you
[1:47:20] shall do so how did Jesus do the works
[1:47:24] he was predestinated by the forn
[1:47:26] knowledge of God according to the plan
[1:47:28] of God God was going to send a redeemer
[1:47:31] God promised it and this Redeemer could
[1:47:33] only be his own son God promised this
[1:47:37] all the way from the Garden of Eden all
[1:47:40] the way through amen that Jesus would be
[1:47:43] here then he comes a man born of a
[1:47:47] virgin ain't that right God had made
[1:47:49] himself a man the word God the word was
[1:47:53] made flesh then but notice then the
[1:47:56] prophet said but it taken the spirit of
[1:47:59] God to Quicken that word to him and he
[1:48:02] was the word Quicken the word quickened
[1:48:04] for that hour the time had come when you
[1:48:08] had to have a redeemer the law had
[1:48:10] failed other things failed now it takes
[1:48:12] a redeemer and he was that promised
[1:48:16] Redeemer he was quickened by the word of
[1:48:19] God do you believe
[1:48:21] it Jesus Jesus even said there in Luke 4
[1:48:24] the spirit of the Lord is upon me Heath
[1:48:27] anointed me to preach the gospel he has
[1:48:30] anointed me you know all these things I
[1:48:32] mean he was anointed see that word seed
[1:48:35] quickened amen and the prophet said God
[1:48:38] spoken word through a virgin brought
[1:48:40] forth a body and in that body came the
[1:48:43] water the spirit see and Washed by the
[1:48:47] Water of the word and then went in him
[1:48:49] dwelt in him and there come the life of
[1:48:52] God manifesting himself through Christ
[1:48:54] God was in Christ the anointed one
[1:48:57] Christ means the anointed one a man that
[1:49:00] was anointed ain't that right so the
[1:49:02] spirit being the water came and watered
[1:49:05] or quickened that word seed amen and and
[1:49:09] and and it became the word of God made
[1:49:12] manifest God's word made manifest and
[1:49:14] the prophet said he came to represent us
[1:49:17] before God as Sons and Daughters of God
[1:49:21] think of that not as as Sinners and not
[1:49:24] as as no goods and and just people full
[1:49:28] of M he came to represent us before God
[1:49:32] as Sons and Daughters of God see he says
[1:49:36] and and he sent his holy spirit now he's
[1:49:40] brooding over the place trying to bring
[1:49:43] us back to birth see die to ourselves
[1:49:46] and be reborn again to be Sons and
[1:49:49] Daughters of God to take God at his word
[1:49:52] to believe God's word Oh my he says now
[1:49:58] in another place says he died in order
[1:50:00] to pay the debt of your high breeding
[1:50:02] there it is what is it that you could
[1:50:04] die to yourself until you're no more
[1:50:06] yourself get rid of all your doubts your
[1:50:09] unbelief your excuses get just get it
[1:50:12] all out of the way and stand there and
[1:50:15] just totally believe God regardless you
[1:50:18] may not have to explain it you may not
[1:50:20] can explain it you don't have to explain
[1:50:22] it everything you just believe
[1:50:25] it just believe it see and you don't
[1:50:29] have to worry about what everybody else
[1:50:31] is doing well I'd be in Revival if
[1:50:34] everybody else would get their act
[1:50:35] together you can be in Revival it
[1:50:37] doesn't
[1:50:39] matter well I I could sure serve God I'd
[1:50:41] really worship if everybody else get
[1:50:43] into it but that church is dead well
[1:50:46] what about
[1:50:48] you it's you and
[1:50:50] God can you say Amen you've got to climb
[1:50:54] you've got to press you've got to it's
[1:50:56] you and God coming into worship doesn't
[1:51:00] matter what everybody else does I'm
[1:51:01] going to worship doesn't matter what
[1:51:04] everybody else does I'm just going to
[1:51:05] say Amen to it I'm going to believe it
[1:51:08] see it's it's we're coming to
[1:51:12] Sons sons of
[1:51:16] God so he said see you got to die to
[1:51:18] yourself till you know more yourself and
[1:51:20] be filled with his word believing his
[1:51:22] word how are you filled with his word
[1:51:25] believing his word just believe it see
[1:51:29] and then the Holy Spirit was in him
[1:51:31] comes down to water that word and to
[1:51:34] make it grow see you believe it God does
[1:51:36] the rest of it you know you say well I I
[1:51:41] know I know I know all about healing but
[1:51:43] I'm so hurting right now I just don't
[1:51:46] know well see you can't
[1:51:49] reason you you just got to say well God
[1:51:52] I just thank you I thank you for healing
[1:51:55] well then everybody else gets healed
[1:51:57] around you and then the devil tells you
[1:51:58] they see it's not for you don't give
[1:52:01] into that
[1:52:02] reasoning let the word find a resting
[1:52:05] place and let the spirit do the rest
[1:52:08] he'll do it that's the same way with the
[1:52:11] Holy Ghost that's the same way with
[1:52:12] every promise of
[1:52:19] God so today we have come to the same
[1:52:22] thing thing again as Christ and that is
[1:52:24] the manifestation of
[1:52:26] sons it's the only time that the same
[1:52:29] Ministry of Jesus
[1:52:31] Christ has come
[1:52:33] back is in this is in this time
[1:52:36] appreciate the ministry of All Through
[1:52:38] the Ages but here has come to the
[1:52:41] revealing of the son of
[1:52:44] man what is it the prophet asked it's
[1:52:47] God manifesting continuing the work of
[1:52:49] his first son his only begotten see
[1:52:53] that died for our high breeding life
[1:52:54] that he might reconcile us back to be
[1:52:57] Sons and Daughters of God that through
[1:52:59] the church might flow the same life by
[1:53:01] the word by the word continuing the work
[1:53:05] being manifested as it was in Christ
[1:53:08] Christ was God's word made manifest he
[1:53:11] died he gave his life that he might send
[1:53:14] the spirit take his body up send the
[1:53:16] spirit back to water to water say pay
[1:53:19] the redeeming price if we'll believe it
[1:53:23] that's that's it right there if you
[1:53:25] believe it he that believeth on me the
[1:53:27] works that I do see then come the Holy
[1:53:29] Spirit upon the same word of God why the
[1:53:34] same word that prophesied his life is
[1:53:37] the same word that prophesied your life
[1:53:40] it prophesied a Rapture for you it
[1:53:43] prophesied a body change for you it
[1:53:46] prophesied an adoption for you it's all
[1:53:50] in scriptures
[1:53:52] somebody just got to just believe it let
[1:53:55] the word find a resting
[1:54:00] place if you remember we're being
[1:54:02] changed remember he said we're being
[1:54:04] changed from glory to glory that's right
[1:54:07] this is what it's been he said brother
[1:54:08] brand says just like a seed of a morning
[1:54:11] glory the seed of a flower it falls into
[1:54:14] the ground the seed of corn falls in the
[1:54:17] ground what's the first thing it comes
[1:54:19] up and it's a little Sprout then it goes
[1:54:22] to a tossel then from a tossel it goes
[1:54:25] back to its original grain that's
[1:54:28] exactly what the church has done it come
[1:54:30] from Luther Wesley and now back to the
[1:54:32] original grain back to its original
[1:54:34] Glory back to the glory it was at the
[1:54:36] beginning the Sun that Rose in the East
[1:54:38] it's the same Sun that's manifesting the
[1:54:41] same thing in the west changing from
[1:54:43] glory to glory it changed from the Pagan
[1:54:46] down into Luther from Luther into Wesley
[1:54:49] from Wesley into Pentecost and on and on
[1:54:52] changing from glory to glory producing
[1:54:54] the hidden mana and now everybody say
[1:54:57] now it's
[1:55:00] ripe now it's right to bring him back
[1:55:04] exactly like he was at the beginning he
[1:55:07] same Ministry the same Jesus the Same
[1:55:10] power the same Holy Ghost the same one
[1:55:13] that come down on the day of Pentecost
[1:55:15] is the same Holy Ghost that's manifested
[1:55:17] today from Glory un glory to glory and
[1:55:21] is back to its original seed with the
[1:55:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost the same sign
[1:55:27] same Wonder same baptism same kind of
[1:55:29] people act in the same way with the same
[1:55:32] power the same sensation it's from Glory
[1:55:34] unto glory and the next will be changed
[1:55:38] from this Glory into a body like un to
[1:55:42] his own glorious body and we shall see
[1:55:45] him you love
[1:55:47] him where are we today as sons of God
[1:55:53] I hope it's helped you in some way
[1:55:56] today maybe you've already known all
[1:55:59] this and but it's good to be
[1:56:01] reminded but I can tell you
[1:56:05] this I
[1:56:08] believe that everything has pulled away
[1:56:12] from the from the
[1:56:14] shook every last part of shuck has
[1:56:17] pulled away from this
[1:56:19] bride it's been a hard Road
[1:56:23] it's been times of where you're having
[1:56:26] to stand on your own you're having to
[1:56:29] and and people not understanding people
[1:56:32] Mis Mis interpreting people whatever but
[1:56:37] we we are in a place that people have
[1:56:39] left the message don't understand us
[1:56:42] whatever and it's left us to where we're
[1:56:45] just standing there as what the prophet
[1:56:48] called ripening in the presence of the
[1:56:51] Sun
[1:56:55] ripening I don't know how many more
[1:56:57] people will walk away from this message
[1:57:00] I don't
[1:57:01] know but I tell you what what makes you
[1:57:04] really odd what makes us really odd and
[1:57:06] I'm not just talking about the church
[1:57:07] I'm just talking about Believers all
[1:57:08] around the world is when you simply take
[1:57:11] what a prophet said and just believe it
[1:57:14] regardless just
[1:57:19] regardless it's not up to us to
[1:57:23] have an explanation or an answer to
[1:57:26] every
[1:57:28] question Jesus did not even give answers
[1:57:31] to his
[1:57:35] critics if he did it would be such a
[1:57:38] parable that would totally confuse
[1:57:41] them and blind them even
[1:57:44] more but we're looking at the world
[1:57:48] system we're looking at everything
[1:57:49] that's going on
[1:57:54] Russia is flexing its muscles it's
[1:57:57] challenged the United
[1:57:59] States to a missile
[1:58:02] War missile Showdown you you you do
[1:58:06] yours and we'll do ours and see who
[1:58:09] wins you see where we're at everybody
[1:58:11] talking about World War II everybody
[1:58:12] talking about
[1:58:14] things why we're at the
[1:58:18] end now they don't know they're at the
[1:58:20] end
[1:58:24] I think really I think Russia just will
[1:58:27] wipe America out and we'll just continue
[1:58:29] on but see we know we're at the
[1:58:33] end we we see where we're at time is no
[1:58:37] more everything is falling apart
[1:58:41] everything but in this time is a little
[1:58:44] group of people and I say
[1:58:47] little when you consider the billions of
[1:58:50] people on this Earth
[1:58:52] you know one one Minister put on a
[1:58:55] Minister's chat and he said what if what
[1:58:58] if there's only 10,000 message true
[1:59:01] message believer teachers preachers
[1:59:04] 10,000 in the whole world and he gives
[1:59:07] this this of all the people that are up
[1:59:10] the Earth and maybe just 10,000 which
[1:59:13] likely could only be just 10,000
[1:59:15] preachers I don't know of this
[1:59:17] message and he said it'd be like we're
[1:59:19] just 0.000000
[1:59:22] whatever I mean we are a very
[1:59:27] minority That's how little this bride's
[1:59:29] going to be we we we're very
[1:59:33] small when you really think of the
[1:59:36] number of people that's up on the Earth
[1:59:38] today of people that are truly believ in
[1:59:41] this message but see the message didn't
[1:59:44] come for this world the message came for
[1:59:47] you to bring forth Sons and Daughters of
[1:59:50] God that you may stand in this age not
[1:59:54] as a sinner not as a vagabond and
[1:59:57] condemnation and judgment upon you he
[2:00:01] died to pay the debt of our high
[2:00:03] breeding to bring us back to what God
[2:00:05] originally
[2:00:08] intended and church we're
[2:00:10] here don't underestimate
[2:00:13] yourself believe this message with all
[2:00:16] that's within you believe it don't argue
[2:00:19] with it you come against some or reading
[2:00:24] up up up against something that that you
[2:00:26] read you hear brother bradam say and
[2:00:28] you're like man I don't know I don't
[2:00:30] understand all this stuff don't try just
[2:00:33] leave it alone just say I believe it I
[2:00:36] believe it
[2:00:37] regardless God knows what he's doing but
[2:00:42] and and I'm not saying that word being
[2:00:44] like maybe a following followers of like
[2:00:47] Jim Jones and David Kesh and all that
[2:00:50] that just goes blindly into whatever but
[2:00:53] you've got you've got
[2:00:55] Vindication this message has been so
[2:00:58] Vindicated that it should take away all
[2:01:00] question all unbelief every
[2:01:03] doubt from our
[2:01:05] minds can you say Amen you have the
[2:01:08] musicians will

[2:01:19] Lord and I'm so glad to be part of this
[2:01:22] this
[2:01:23] age I wished I could just so explain it
[2:01:26] and paint the picture to you the way I
[2:01:28] feel it
[2:01:30] but God will do it for
[2:01:33] us
[2:01:35] amen but I know that we're standing here
[2:01:38] as sons of
[2:01:39] God and it's in this
