[42:51] hearer in Jesus Christ's name
[42:55] amen revelation the 18th chapter we're
[42:58] going to start at the first verse but it
[43:01] says and after these things I saw
[43:03] another Angel come down from heaven
[43:06] having great power and the Earth was
[43:09] lighted lightened with his glory and he
[43:13] cried mightily with a strong voice
[43:16] saying Babylon the great is Fallen is
[43:19] fallen and has become the habitation of
[43:21] devils and of and the hold of every foul
[43:27] spirit and a cage of every unclean and
[43:31] hateful bird for all nations have drunk
[43:35] the wine of the wrath of her fornication
[43:37] the kings of the Earth have committed
[43:39] fornication with her and their mergent
[43:43] um and the merchants of the Earth are
[43:46] waxed Rich through the abundance of her
[43:49] Delicacies and I heard another voice
[43:51] from Heaven saying come out of her my
[43:54] people that you be not part Akers of her
[43:58] sins and that you receive not of her
[44:02] plagues amen you can have your seats
[44:05] this
[44:07] evening and
[44:09] um I want to maybe just speak uh use the
[44:14] title coming out of
[44:16] Babylon and um I I realize uh that uh
[44:22] we're we're you know we on internet and
[44:25] and we've got um different ones you know
[44:28] around in our community that that uh
[44:31] listen in on our
[44:34] services and uh we find that U you know
[44:40] uh a lot of folks are are looking for
[44:43] answers
[44:45] today um um we're we're seeing nothing
[44:49] today but a mass
[44:51] confusion and uh and we're very well
[44:55] aware of that uh not just just in the
[44:57] media but um uh in religion
[45:01] politics and and just everywhere and no
[45:05] one knows who to believe or what to
[45:09] believe or uh you know but uh I think
[45:15] that there's got to be some answers I
[45:17] think that I don't think that we're
[45:19] wasting time here in this earth and um
[45:23] you know uh uh God doesn't want us toss
[45:26] to and fro by every wind of Doctrine as
[45:29] the Bible would would put it and uh but
[45:33] yet there are so many different ideas so
[45:36] many different teachings and doctrines
[45:38] and and they're all floating
[45:41] around uh being purported as as
[45:45] Truth uh but uh uh how how can it be all
[45:50] truth when when they're contradicting
[45:53] one one another and so uh with this uh
[45:58] it would it would be nice if if we just
[46:00] had one voice one uh as as it was in the
[46:05] days of Acts uh the day of Pentecost it
[46:08] was uh one one Faith one Lord one
[46:12] Doctrine one baptism and uh but but
[46:16] we're in this leodys and age where it's
[46:18] just uh nothing but just confusion and
[46:22] so people don't know what to do there
[46:24] there are a lot of things being said and
[46:26] taught uh yet but the truth isn't being
[46:30] made known uh and and so what people are
[46:34] believing and teaching are are things
[46:37] that have never been proven to be
[46:39] absolute truth and and and in order for
[46:43] it to be an absolute it has to be proven
[46:46] to be true uh if it's going to be the
[46:49] absolute truth and and so uh uh we find
[46:54] that you know someone might interpret it
[46:58] uh to fit their way of life and uh uh
[47:02] but that will never you know uh uh be
[47:06] changed be able to change absolute truth
[47:08] cannot be changed no matter way what
[47:12] happens um and and truth no matter what
[47:15] age uh and how long it takes and and the
[47:19] world may change society may change um
[47:23] uh people's uh thinking may change but
[47:26] the word of God the truth can never
[47:30] change it can never be altered no matter
[47:33] what so we don't want to hang our soul
[47:37] on conspiracy
[47:39] theories uh that and and and I'm sure
[47:42] you've probably talk to those that are
[47:44] conspiracy theorists and uh and
[47:47] everything is is they they they is is
[47:51] you know well they I I know they doing
[47:52] it this way and I know they mean it this
[47:54] way and I know they done it that way and
[47:57] and but but have no proof of it uh but
[48:00] so they build their whole life uh on on
[48:04] conspiracies and and so uh and we we
[48:08] cannot afford to put our future into the
[48:11] hands of something that is not truth and
[48:15] and because life isn't a game that we're
[48:19] playing uh this is not a playing field
[48:22] it's it's life is real and and not only
[48:25] that the future is is real uh our
[48:28] destination is real and there is life
[48:32] after death there there there is a real
[48:35] heaven and a real hell there is a real
[48:38] white Throne judgment there there is
[48:42] there there is a real uh Rapture the
[48:45] Rapture is going to happen there is
[48:48] going to be a real Millennium um uh
[48:51] there you know and and and there's going
[48:54] to be a real tribulation
[48:57] and that is at hand right now and so
[49:01] what what we are seeing uh the world uh
[49:05] you know falling apart and and the
[49:08] things that are going on it's not just a
[49:11] stage in life it's it's it's act there's
[49:15] answers to why all of these things are
[49:18] happening and and so you know but you
[49:22] know what what we are seeing in this age
[49:25] is the Fulfillment of second
[49:26] Thessalonians 2:8 uh where Paul would
[49:29] say uh then shall that Wicked be
[49:33] revealed whom the Lord shall consume
[49:36] with the spirit of his mouth and shall
[49:38] destroy with the brightness of his
[49:40] coming even him whose coming is after
[49:43] the working of Satan with all power uh
[49:46] signs and lying wonders with all
[49:49] deceitfulness uh uh and of
[49:51] unrighteousness in them that perish
[49:54] because they receive not the love of the
[49:57] truth that they might be saved ain't
[50:00] that right see and for this cause God
[50:03] shall send them strong delusion that
[50:05] they should believe a lie and that they
[50:08] all might be damned who believed not the
[50:10] truth but had pleasure in
[50:12] unrighteousness now if you look at this
[50:15] in the Amplified uh Bible it it says
[50:18] that God sends them a
[50:22] misleading uh
[50:24] influence uh a working of a error and a
[50:27] strong delusion to make them believe
[50:29] what is false and and so th this is
[50:33] actually uh what what is happening in
[50:36] this age and this also uh uh Falls in
[50:40] line with what Revelations 317 says of
[50:45] this Le Odyssey and age thou sayest I am
[50:48] rich and increase with goods and have
[50:50] need of nothing and knowest not
[50:52] everybody say knowest not knowest not
[50:55] that thou art rich Ed miserable poor
[50:58] blind and naked so they are believing it
[51:01] to be truth but the spirit of Truth says
[51:05] it's a lie it's false so so they're
[51:07] believing something that is false and
[51:10] yet the god of Truth the spirit of truth
[51:14] truth itself is saying no it's it's not
[51:17] right what you're believing is actually
[51:20] a lie now we we could go on another one
[51:25] uh and and I just maybe
[51:27] uh laying a foundation as to why all of
[51:29] the confusion uh 2 Timothy 4:3 it says
[51:34] uh Paul would say the time will come the
[51:37] time will come and we can truly say that
[51:40] time has come now is that when they the
[51:44] people will not endure or tolerate sound
[51:49] Doctrine but after their own lusts after
[51:53] their own taste their own wishes shall
[51:57] they Heap to themselves teachers now
[52:00] this word Heap is is multiplication so
[52:03] they they will they will have a
[52:06] multiplication of teachers or ministers
[52:10] uh like they they'll become a dime a
[52:13] dozen and and it's just more and more
[52:16] and more as time goes and and they'll
[52:20] Heap unto themselves a
[52:22] multiplication of teachers having
[52:24] itching ears now the Amplified says of
[52:28] this want they're wanting something
[52:31] pleasing and gratifying so they will
[52:34] gather to themselves one teacher after
[52:37] another chosen of by them of themselves
[52:41] chosen to satisfy their own liking and
[52:45] to Foster the errors that they hold so
[52:49] so this is exactly what we're seeing
[52:52] today so it goes on they will choose
[52:55] ministers who will coincide with their
[52:58] whims who Foster e ever uh uh uh vager
[53:04] which might enter their imagination who
[53:07] will count countenance every wild
[53:10] project for doing good who will be the
[53:13] advocate of the or who will Advocate the
[53:16] errors which they hold and who would be
[53:19] afraid to rebuke their faults and and so
[53:23] th this is this is why they they they he
[53:26] unto themselves multiply and this this
[53:29] is why so many uh people are invading
[53:33] the the pulpits and and uh uh uh uh is
[53:38] because they want someone to Foster
[53:40] their error you know and and so it it's
[53:44] that way and so uh uh this is the
[53:47] principles upon by which people choose
[53:51] their their ministers and and and the
[53:54] pastor and teachers and and such you see
[53:58] and and notice there uh Paul would say
[54:01] and they shall turn away their ears from
[54:04] the truth and shall be turned un fables
[54:08] ain't that right so so in other words
[54:10] they will turn aside from hearing the
[54:13] truth and will wander off into myths and
[54:17] man-made fictions one commentator said
[54:21] the true principle should be to select
[54:24] those who will Faithfully declare the
[54:26] truth and who will not shrink from
[54:30] exposing and denouncing sin wherever it
[54:33] may be found ain't that right so so we
[54:36] we look at this this is a part of of of
[54:40] Babylon uh uh and this misleading
[54:44] influence that is coming uh that is here
[54:48] uh it comes in the form of false
[54:50] Christ's false anointed ones ain't that
[54:53] right for for for Christ means anointed
[54:57] so Matthew 24 and 24 uh Jesus prophesied
[55:01] of this very same thing and says for
[55:03] there shall arise false Christ and false
[55:07] prophets false teachers and and false uh
[55:11] whatever and shall show great signs and
[55:13] wonders in so much that if it were
[55:15] possible they shall deceive the very
[55:17] elect so what this means is that we're
[55:20] living in the greatest deception ever
[55:24] ever known and there are scriptures that
[55:27] testify of the age of of of of that
[55:31] we're living in and it's it's a it's a
[55:34] glorious age but yet it's an age of
[55:37] confusion there's more confusion than
[55:40] ever and and it's it's it's because
[55:43] Satan has been able to to preach his
[55:47] gospel amen which is not another gospel
[55:51] ain't that right uh it's it's just
[55:53] falsehood it's it's it's just a a a
[55:57] message of lies and so in this day that
[56:00] we are living in we see uh uh uh amamos
[56:04] 11-2 being fulfilled and it says behold
[56:08] the days come sayth the Lord that I will
[56:11] send a famine in the land not a famine
[56:14] of bread nor a thirst for water but of
[56:18] hearing the words of the Lord and they
[56:22] shall Wander from sea to Sea and from
[56:25] the North even to the East and they
[56:28] shall run to and fro and seek the word
[56:31] of the Lord and shall not find it now
[56:34] you think of that why will they not find
[56:36] it because the places they're looking
[56:39] for the word isn't there it it's just
[56:43] the facts ain't that right see they're
[56:45] they're looking in places that the word
[56:48] isn't there and and so now we have a
[56:52] multiplication of churches we have a
[56:54] multiplication of uh seminars and and uh
[56:58] uh conferences we have a multiplication
[57:02] of programs in the church and and and
[57:05] and all of these things uh and and yet
[57:09] the true-hearted people cannot find
[57:12] truth I still believe that there's
[57:14] people searching for truth I I just
[57:17] believe that I I believe that they're
[57:19] wanting to know truth and and and but
[57:22] yet they don't know where to find the
[57:24] truuth they they're they're they're
[57:26] looking and and and I think this is why
[57:29] it behooves us to know where we stand
[57:32] and to declare what we do know am
[57:35] because what we know is not just
[57:37] something that has come up uh that was
[57:40] just conjured up by man but it was
[57:42] proven over and over and over by God and
[57:47] it's a scriptural Vindication can you
[57:50] say amen and so uh uh they're seeking to
[57:54] find answers and so yes the the church
[57:57] um uh the world uh everything is falling
[58:01] apart and people are truly concerned uh
[58:04] I've never seen a time I I I don't guess
[58:07] of people are just full of questions as
[58:10] to what is happening what's going on
[58:13] what's what what and not only just with
[58:15] uh uh politics and and religion and all
[58:19] that but they they want to know because
[58:21] for themselves as to what their future
[58:24] is where do they stand or where where
[58:26] can they stand on something solid amen
[58:29] because you know uh people get into
[58:31] sports but you look look at the sports
[58:34] uh uh they're just as as as wicked and
[58:37] evil as everything else Sports used to
[58:40] be a good thing it used to be a
[58:41] wholesome thing and but but look look
[58:44] look at everything but but even look at
[58:46] the preachers that are just falling left
[58:48] and right uh uh uh in religion and and
[58:52] so what it's doing it's causing people
[58:54] to think look look at our Politics the
[58:56] way it's at today people used to just
[58:59] you know and and there are people so
[59:01] caught up in politics and things but
[59:02] then there are true-hearted people that
[59:04] are saying but hold it I'm not finding
[59:07] the answers really what is that
[59:09] candidate which one can really give me
[59:11] the answers well they don't have the
[59:14] answers uh uh uh but but we there there
[59:18] are answers but people are concerned
[59:20] about what's happening in Israel they're
[59:23] they're concerned about what's happening
[59:25] in this na
[59:26] and and World abroad amen look at Russia
[59:30] look look at China look at look at all
[59:33] these things that are uh things are uh
[59:35] happening and and so they're they're
[59:38] concerned about what's happening in the
[59:40] home what's happening in the schools
[59:42] what's what's happening in in in the
[59:44] family what's happening to the young
[59:46] people of this day and and what's
[59:49] happening to marriages and and all of
[59:51] these things people are going crazy and
[59:55] and we all know that right and uh uh it
[59:57] doesn't take long for you to uh uh live
[1:00:01] to know that that uh when you come to an
[1:00:04] understanding that people's about lost
[1:00:05] their minds amen and so uh uh but but
[1:00:10] one would think that well all a person
[1:00:12] would have to do is just read the Bible
[1:00:15] and uh uh uh and and they'll know truth
[1:00:18] but that's not true uh we've had this
[1:00:20] Bible for years and years and years and
[1:00:24] and and so uh uh uh the thing is is men
[1:00:27] have so shredded the truth of the word
[1:00:31] with their own opinions that truth is is
[1:00:34] lost to uh uh to so many and and and and
[1:00:39] yet how many out there that has their
[1:00:42] Bibles and and yet cannot uh see the
[1:00:45] truth because their own ideas of this
[1:00:49] Bible has blinded them and and they're
[1:00:53] they're looking at it in the wrong way
[1:00:55] ain't that right you see you you can't
[1:00:58] read the Bible like you would a
[1:01:00] newspaper or a magazine or a western
[1:01:04] book or or some other book you you
[1:01:07] cannot read the Bible this that way and
[1:01:09] and comprehend because this is a
[1:01:12] supernatural book can can you say Amen
[1:01:15] it it's a supernatural book and and and
[1:01:19] and it's truth everybody say it's truth
[1:01:22] there's nothing wrong with this Bible at
[1:01:24] all it's it's men that that makes this
[1:01:29] uh uh it's the problem is is with
[1:01:31] mankind uh uh but but the word is truth
[1:01:35] but but notice the truth has to be
[1:01:38] revealed the the truth has to be
[1:01:41] revealed or a man will actually not see
[1:01:43] it even though it's in the word of God
[1:01:48] Amen it it's true look uh uh 1
[1:01:51] Corinthians 2:9 but as it is written I
[1:01:54] have not seen
[1:01:56] Nor Ear heard neither have entered into
[1:01:59] the heart of man the things which God
[1:02:02] hath prepared uh for them that love him
[1:02:05] ain't that right everything that God has
[1:02:09] prepared for us is in this word right
[1:02:12] here it's it's here in the Bible but I
[1:02:16] cannot uh see it ear cannot hear it
[1:02:20] neither can it enter into the heart of
[1:02:22] man to where he can comprehend it uh
[1:02:25] because it takes God to reveal it to us
[1:02:29] ain't that right and and so the natural
[1:02:32] mind will never be able to see those
[1:02:34] things even though he reads it he could
[1:02:36] read it uh once a year twice a year 50
[1:02:40] times a year and will never be able to
[1:02:44] understand it except God himself reveals
[1:02:47] it see because it says here the 10th
[1:02:50] verse but God hath revealed them unto us
[1:02:53] by his spirit for the spirit searcheth
[1:02:57] all things aren't you glad for that the
[1:03:00] spirit searcheth things that that that
[1:03:03] the are natural eye cannot see the
[1:03:05] spirit revealeth things that the natural
[1:03:08] eye will never ever be able to catch or
[1:03:11] the natural mind and says see see God
[1:03:14] hath revealed them to us by his spirit
[1:03:17] for the spirit searcheth all things yay
[1:03:19] the Deep things everybody say deep
[1:03:21] things the Deep things of God see for
[1:03:25] what man know the things of man except
[1:03:27] uh the spirit of man which is in him
[1:03:30] even so the things of God knoweth no man
[1:03:33] but the spirit of God so then we go to
[1:03:37] Matthew 13:14 Jesus says and in them is
[1:03:40] fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah uh
[1:03:43] which saith by hearing you shall hear
[1:03:46] and shall not understand and seeing you
[1:03:48] shall see and shall not perceive see you
[1:03:52] can hear it and still not understand it
[1:03:55] you can see it and yet not under uh uh
[1:03:58] uh uh perceive it see and he says see
[1:04:01] for this people's heart is waxed gross
[1:04:03] and their ears are dull of hearing and
[1:04:06] their eyes they have closed not natural
[1:04:09] but spiritual lest at any time they
[1:04:12] should see with their eyes hear with
[1:04:14] their ears and should understand with
[1:04:16] not hear but with their heart and when
[1:04:20] they hear it there and be
[1:04:22] converted and I should heal them but
[1:04:25] blessed are your eyes for they see
[1:04:28] blessed are your ears for they hear so
[1:04:32] not everybody in the world is going to
[1:04:35] be blinded not everybody in the world is
[1:04:38] not is is going to be deaf not everybody
[1:04:42] in the world is going to be just have
[1:04:44] their heart blinded to where they can't
[1:04:47] perceive there are those that can hear
[1:04:51] and and and and and can see and they are
[1:04:55] are blessed are you blessed are you
[1:04:59] blessed we sing that song I am blessed I
[1:05:02] am blessed well uh uh you you you don't
[1:05:05] have to have a boat to to be blessed you
[1:05:07] don't have to have money in the bank to
[1:05:09] be blessed but if your eyes can see if
[1:05:11] your ears can hear amen the word of God
[1:05:15] if your heart can perceive the things of
[1:05:18] God you are blessed above all ain't that
[1:05:22] right now in John 16:12
[1:05:26] Jesus said I have yet many things to say
[1:05:29] to you but you cannot bear them now so
[1:05:32] he's not he did not reveal it to them at
[1:05:36] that time many things but notice he will
[1:05:40] and he tells when how be it when the
[1:05:44] spirit of Truth he he the spirit of
[1:05:48] Truth not a sensation not an emotional
[1:05:51] workup not somebody dancing and shouting
[1:05:55] but it's actually a person he not they
[1:06:00] he the spirit of Truth is come he will
[1:06:04] guide you everybody say he will guide he
[1:06:07] will guide you into all truth see for he
[1:06:12] shall not speak of himself but
[1:06:15] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[1:06:17] speak and he shall show you things to
[1:06:20] come he shall glorify me for he shall
[1:06:23] receive of mine and shall show it unto
[1:06:25] you now that Spirit of Truth we I
[1:06:29] believe and I I'm sure you do too that
[1:06:32] is Jesus Christ do you believe that the
[1:06:36] spirit of Truth is none other than Jesus
[1:06:39] Christ amen for he says I am the way the
[1:06:44] truth and the life ain't that right and
[1:06:47] we could go more into that but but here
[1:06:50] notice John 14:16 and I will pray the
[1:06:54] father notice he knows how important it
[1:06:57] is for the spirit of Truth to come uh
[1:07:00] because now he's praying I pray the
[1:07:03] father that he shall give you another
[1:07:06] comforter now notice this way of
[1:07:09] comforting it's not comforting us and
[1:07:12] and to keep us from trouble to keep us
[1:07:14] from danger to keep us from heartaches
[1:07:18] we've all had our share of heartaches
[1:07:20] we've all shed tears we've all we've all
[1:07:23] had times that we didn't know what to do
[1:07:25] and
[1:07:26] and and and uh you know you know we've
[1:07:28] we've had trials and testings and all
[1:07:31] that so but but so he this comforter
[1:07:34] wouldn't keep us from them things that's
[1:07:36] not the way of comfort we would comfort
[1:07:39] is to to keep our children from danger
[1:07:42] to keep them protected away from the
[1:07:45] evil and to where that you know if if if
[1:07:48] there're if they're sick I'd say man I I
[1:07:51] I wish I could take that upon myself you
[1:07:54] understand what I'm saying that would
[1:07:55] the Comfort I would give them is try to
[1:07:58] take that away from them if if they're
[1:08:00] broke if I've got the money I want to
[1:08:02] give it to them I want to help them and
[1:08:05] and and these things but that's not the
[1:08:07] comfort that he's talking about here but
[1:08:10] notice what he says he shall give you
[1:08:12] another comforter that he may abide with
[1:08:15] you forever even the spirit of Truth so
[1:08:19] there's the comforter the spirit of
[1:08:22] Truth whom the world cannot receive
[1:08:25] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[1:08:28] him but you know him you're comforted
[1:08:32] can you say Amen you're comforted
[1:08:35] because you know him and for he dwelleth
[1:08:38] with you and shall be in you I notice I
[1:08:43] will not leave you comfortless I will
[1:08:46] come to you so he's the spirit of Truth
[1:08:50] he's the comfort in all and notice the
[1:08:54] the time that we need need that
[1:08:55] comforter most is now in the time of
[1:08:59] confusion in the time of so many
[1:09:01] different ideas so many different ways
[1:09:04] to go and and who do I believe he
[1:09:09] Comforts Us by coming to us in us as the
[1:09:14] spirit of Truth he is guiding us into
[1:09:18] truth all truth is our comfort amen G
[1:09:24] and you say amen amen so we we find that
[1:09:29] notice I will come to you the spirit of
[1:09:32] truth comes and this coming fulfills
[1:09:36] what Jesus said in Matthew and and uh um
[1:09:41] uh or maybe we we could look uh uh Luke
[1:09:46] 21:25 and it says and there shall be
[1:09:48] signs in the Sun and in the moon and in
[1:09:50] the stars and upon the Earth distress of
[1:09:53] Nations and we're here with perplexity
[1:09:56] the Sea and the waves roaring men's
[1:10:00] Hearts failing them for fear there's
[1:10:02] never been an age like this age where
[1:10:04] people are filled with fear not just one
[1:10:08] person or a community or a a different
[1:10:12] group but the world is filled with fear
[1:10:16] amen see why for looking after those
[1:10:20] things which are coming on the earth for
[1:10:22] the powers of Heaven shall be shaking
[1:10:25] that's happening today do you believe
[1:10:28] that but notice and then shall they see
[1:10:32] the coming or the son of man coming uh
[1:10:35] in a cloud with power and great glory
[1:10:39] and when these things begin to come to
[1:10:41] pass look up that's your command is look
[1:10:45] up for your Redemption draweth nigh do
[1:10:49] you believe that so the spirit of Truth
[1:10:52] coming to us is the son a man coming to
[1:10:56] us with power and great Glory coming in
[1:11:00] a cloud with power and great glory amen
[1:11:04] now we know that this is not a physical
[1:11:07] coming this this coming of Jesus Christ
[1:11:10] is not the physical coming because in 1
[1:11:13] Thessalonians
[1:11:14] 4:16 Paul says the dead in Christ shall
[1:11:18] rise first and we which are alive and
[1:11:22] remain shall be caught up together with
[1:11:24] him in the air to meet the Lord can you
[1:11:27] say Amen see so we're going to meet him
[1:11:31] in not a spirit amen we're not going to
[1:11:34] meet a spirit in the air we're going to
[1:11:36] meet the Lord in the air in his physical
[1:11:41] uh uh body I believe that now we do
[1:11:44] believe in the physical coming of our
[1:11:46] Lord Jesus Christ so the Bible never
[1:11:50] said that Jesus will put his feet upon
[1:11:53] the Earth in his physical being physical
[1:11:56] body uh uh before the Rapture takes
[1:11:59] place Jesus does not come to the Earth
[1:12:03] until the
[1:12:04] Millennium can you say Amen which is
[1:12:07] after the Rapture takes place and when
[1:12:11] the Rapture takes place the bride is
[1:12:13] gone it's out of here and the
[1:12:15] tribulation sets in amen see so then
[1:12:19] what we see then coming to us is the
[1:12:24] spirit of Truth truth the spirit of
[1:12:27] Truth coming to us he doesn't need to
[1:12:30] come in his physical body here upon the
[1:12:32] Earth at that this time because he's got
[1:12:35] a body here upon the Earth which is the
[1:12:38] church for he said I will come to you
[1:12:42] and I will be in
[1:12:45] you ain't that right so this coming is
[1:12:48] the spirit of truth
[1:12:50] right now we see this coming is tied
[1:12:53] with Revelations 101 one and I saw
[1:12:56] another Mighty Angel come down from
[1:12:58] heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[1:13:00] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[1:13:02] was as it were the the Sun and his feet
[1:13:06] as pillars of fire ain't that right and
[1:13:09] we know this is Christ this is Christ
[1:13:12] descending that Mighty Angel he's got
[1:13:14] the rainbow which means he's a he's the
[1:13:17] Covenant one ain't that right that's the
[1:13:20] spirit of Truth and he cried with a loud
[1:13:23] voice amen in other words the voice was
[1:13:27] strong it in other words it was a voice
[1:13:30] of
[1:13:31] authority it was an authoritative voice
[1:13:35] it wasn't just some little old wimpy
[1:13:36] voice it was a voice with
[1:13:39] authority am ain't that right see and
[1:13:43] and when we compare scripture with
[1:13:45] scripture then we see that when this
[1:13:48] happens there will be the seventh angel
[1:13:51] upon the Earth at the same time at the
[1:13:55] is coming uh uh Revelations 10:7 amen
[1:13:59] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:14:00] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:14:02] sound the mystery of God should be
[1:14:04] finished as he has declared to his
[1:14:06] servants the prophets ain't that right
[1:14:08] see so so now notice if you just bear
[1:14:11] with me for a moment but we do not hear
[1:14:15] the an uh uh uh the the voice of the
[1:14:18] mighty Angel uh uh of Revelation 10:1
[1:14:22] audibly it's not an audible voice voice
[1:14:25] uh maybe but we do hear the voice of the
[1:14:29] seventh
[1:14:30] angel can you say amen amen see the
[1:14:34] voice of the seventh Angels see and and
[1:14:37] we're talking about the spirit of Truth
[1:14:39] descending amen and he utters but what
[1:14:42] we hear is the voice uh of the seventh
[1:14:46] angel amen and and we know that see uh
[1:14:50] that that the mighty Angel is speaking
[1:14:52] through him because it's a voice voice
[1:14:55] of
[1:14:56] authority can you say Amen this message
[1:15:00] is a voice of
[1:15:03] authority that's right it's a voice of
[1:15:06] authority it'll change your
[1:15:09] life amen sure
[1:15:12] will so the spirit of Truth given out
[1:15:15] the Revelation notice giv out the
[1:15:18] Revelation through the seventh angel
[1:15:20] messenger remember when he begins to
[1:15:23] sound the m of God should be
[1:15:27] finished if I could say it this way
[1:15:29] confusion is
[1:15:31] over looking at the word and probing at
[1:15:34] it and taking this idea and that idea
[1:15:36] and that idea it's
[1:15:38] over ain't that right for the voice of
[1:15:42] of
[1:15:43] authority amen we found out that you
[1:15:46] know the pope thinks he's the voice of
[1:15:48] authority but but we found out he's
[1:15:50] really not the voice of authority he
[1:15:52] might be a a voice of authority over
[1:15:55] over his subjects but he's not the voice
[1:15:58] of authority over the elect amen amen
[1:16:02] can you say Amen so so we find but it
[1:16:05] it's it's at this time of of all of this
[1:16:09] this coming the spirit of Truth coming
[1:16:11] the seventh angel sounding Out the
[1:16:14] message and and the Mystery of God being
[1:16:17] finished being revealed being being uh
[1:16:20] uh
[1:16:21] fulfilled uh uh all of these things uh
[1:16:25] uh at that time the church is commanded
[1:16:29] to come out of Babylon ain't that right
[1:16:33] and and and and when we say Church we're
[1:16:35] talking about the elect of God Amen
[1:16:37] because remember he didn't just say come
[1:16:39] out people he said my people come out of
[1:16:43] her my people ain't that
[1:16:47] right that's right see just just as much
[1:16:50] as Elijah you know when he he's
[1:16:53] preaching to Jezebel and they and the
[1:16:55] nation and all of that and he got
[1:16:57] discouraged and he said Lord I'm the
[1:16:59] only one else I'm the only one left and
[1:17:02] just take my life and and God reminded
[1:17:04] him no I I have
[1:17:07] 7,000 reserved that have not bowed a
[1:17:10] knee to bail that's that people that's
[1:17:13] going to come out of Babylon it's a
[1:17:16] people that God has reserved unto
[1:17:18] himself amen all the confusion has not
[1:17:22] been able to touch him has not been able
[1:17:24] to scar them have not been able to so
[1:17:27] deform them that God can't reach them
[1:17:30] amen so he sends the spirit of Truth and
[1:17:33] this day the seventh angel begins to
[1:17:35] sound amen and come out of her my people
[1:17:39] come out and there's a people coming out
[1:17:42] aren't you glad you're out come out of
[1:17:46] her yes what a blessing it is to stand
[1:17:50] and not be
[1:17:51] confused go through this life and not be
[1:17:54] confused
[1:17:55] confusion everywhere confusion where
[1:17:58] boys and girls don't even know what they
[1:18:00] are
[1:18:02] confusion amen amen it's true so re
[1:18:07] again if you look Revelations 18:4 I
[1:18:10] heard another voice from Heaven saying
[1:18:12] come out of her my people well what is
[1:18:15] that that's a Heavenly voice a voice of
[1:18:18] authority amen come out it didn't say
[1:18:21] would you please come
[1:18:23] out come out of
[1:18:25] her we hear a voice saying House of Hell
[1:18:29] give
[1:18:31] way ain't that right see so now if you
[1:18:35] look at it the New Testament calls the
[1:18:37] elect of God the the Church of Jesus
[1:18:39] Christ according to Matthew 16:18 Jesus
[1:18:43] promised to build his church he's
[1:18:45] building his church and and according to
[1:18:48] to Zachariah and and other scriptures we
[1:18:52] find that that we're at the finishing up
[1:18:55] of that church amen he's not at the
[1:18:58] groundw work the groundw work started on
[1:19:00] the day of Pentecost acts 22 amen and
[1:19:03] and and started there and God had been
[1:19:06] working and building up until now at
[1:19:08] this last lotan age amen at the time of
[1:19:12] rapture at the time of a body change at
[1:19:15] at the time of adoption of sons at the
[1:19:18] time when the earth is trembling and and
[1:19:21] and and Paul would say Amen uh uh he he
[1:19:24] going to shake the heavens and the Earth
[1:19:27] and and uh and there'll be a voice that
[1:19:29] does that shaking right amen the voice
[1:19:32] The Voice amen when he begins to sound
[1:19:35] that voice of the mighty Angel when he
[1:19:37] declares of Revelation 10:1 time shall
[1:19:40] be no more amen that voice will now
[1:19:44] shake the heavens and earth amen but and
[1:19:47] that which can be shaken will be shaken
[1:19:49] and that which can re remain will remain
[1:19:52] ain't that right amen and during all of
[1:19:55] this we receive a kingdom which cannot
[1:19:59] be shaken manifestation of sons of God
[1:20:03] adopted Sons coming to the right
[1:20:05] position not
[1:20:10] confused and this church is built upon
[1:20:13] Revelation Revelation in Ephesians uh
[1:20:17] the the chapter one Paul says that the
[1:20:20] church is the body of Jesus Christ and
[1:20:22] is the fullness of him that filth all
[1:20:24] and all Ephesians 5:23 tells us that
[1:20:28] Christ is the head of the church
[1:20:30] Ephesians 5:27 tells us that Christ is
[1:20:33] going to present to himself a glorious
[1:20:35] church not having spot or wrinkle or any
[1:20:38] such thing but that it should be holy
[1:20:41] and without blemish that's the church
[1:20:45] can you say amen amen and the way it
[1:20:47] could happen is the spirit of Truth come
[1:20:51] amen well the Bible talks about the
[1:20:53] washing of the water of the world it's
[1:20:55] the word that washes us it's the word
[1:20:57] that bled for us it's the word that
[1:20:59] cleanses us it's the word amen that
[1:21:02] brings us to Perfection ain't that right
[1:21:05] so we needed the spirit of Truth we
[1:21:07] needed something Amen to cleanse us from
[1:21:10] all the filth of the world that's right
[1:21:14] now the this church that is mentioned in
[1:21:17] the New Testament is it means called out
[1:21:20] Church means called out so when Israel
[1:21:23] was in Egypt
[1:21:25] as long as they were in Egypt in another
[1:21:27] land in another country under slavery
[1:21:31] then they were the children of God but
[1:21:34] when God called them out they became the
[1:21:38] Church of God ain't that right see they
[1:21:42] became the Church of God now the Bible
[1:21:45] says and and that God will take a people
[1:21:49] out of the Gentiles for his name all
[1:21:53] right take take him out take him out of
[1:21:57] what that Babylonian system take him out
[1:22:01] of the filth and the world and all that
[1:22:05] call them out how's he going to take
[1:22:06] them out by a voice the spirit of Truth
[1:22:10] crying out come out of her amen and you
[1:22:14] say amen amen call them out to bear his
[1:22:17] name and to manifest his name but as we
[1:22:20] see we couldn't come out without without
[1:22:22] a voice calling us out
[1:22:25] you just did we didn't stumble into this
[1:22:28] we we we we we didn't just say well I'm
[1:22:31] I'm just leaving everything and I'm just
[1:22:34] no no that that's not it you know uh uh
[1:22:38] uh it it it took a voice to call us out
[1:22:42] and and it's the same voice that called
[1:22:46] Lazarus out of the Grave Lazarus come
[1:22:50] forth it's the same voice that told them
[1:22:53] loose him and let
[1:22:54] go it's the same voice can you say amen
[1:22:58] and it's the same voice that calling us
[1:23:00] out of Babylon come out of her my people
[1:23:03] and Jesus says my sheep hear my voice my
[1:23:08] sheep hear my voice can you say amen he
[1:23:11] has to speak and the Sheep follow him
[1:23:15] that's right yes sir so it's not a voice
[1:23:18] of denomination it's not a voice of
[1:23:20] intellect it's not a voice it's the
[1:23:22] spirit of Truth
[1:23:24] can you say Amen his voice is his word
[1:23:30] do you believe that his voice is his
[1:23:33] word now Amos 3:7 surely the Lord God
[1:23:36] will do nothing will'll do nothing but
[1:23:39] he first or but he revealeth his secret
[1:23:42] unto his servants the prophets amen so a
[1:23:46] prophet is important to us amen and we
[1:23:50] I'm sure we know these things but it's
[1:23:52] good just go back and really reaffirm
[1:23:55] our our faith and our belief in these
[1:23:57] things but a a when when a prophet comes
[1:24:00] to the Earth it is a sign that God is
[1:24:04] ready to speak he's not there to tickle
[1:24:07] our fancy he's not there to get us
[1:24:09] emotionally worked up he's not there
[1:24:12] just to see how big of a crowd he can he
[1:24:15] can bring and and all of these things
[1:24:17] he's there because God sent him cuz God
[1:24:21] is ready to speak to his people amen if
[1:24:25] God isn't going to speak then there
[1:24:26] would be no need for a prophet to be on
[1:24:29] earth ain't that right so a God sent
[1:24:33] Prophet is God's voice on the
[1:24:37] earth amen and that scripture now Moses
[1:24:40] was God's was the voice of God to the
[1:24:43] people in his day Noah was God's voice
[1:24:46] to the people in his day Elijah was
[1:24:49] God's voice to the people in his day
[1:24:51] Elisha was the voice of of God to the
[1:24:54] people in in in his day Jeremiah is
[1:24:58] Isaiah Ezekiel they were God's voice the
[1:25:02] prophets were God's voice Amen to the
[1:25:05] people of their day do you believe that
[1:25:09] Jesus even said that the prophets were
[1:25:11] sent of God yes sir when he walked uh uh
[1:25:16] with the two on the road to Aus he
[1:25:19] called them fools he called them fools
[1:25:22] and slow of heart to to believe all
[1:25:26] everybody say all that the prophets had
[1:25:29] spoken right amen see if you don't
[1:25:31] believe all that the prophets have
[1:25:34] spoken see why would you believe all
[1:25:37] that the prophets have spoken why would
[1:25:39] you put your whole future and your whole
[1:25:42] life into what the prophets have spoken
[1:25:45] because the word of God came to them and
[1:25:48] the word of God cannot
[1:25:51] fail ain't that right
[1:25:54] slow of heart to believe all that the
[1:25:56] prophets had spoken see in Luke
[1:26:00] 24:44 Jesus said all things everybody
[1:26:03] say all things must be fulfilled all
[1:26:06] things must be fulfilled which were
[1:26:07] written in the law of Moses and in the
[1:26:10] prophets and in the Psalms concerning me
[1:26:12] see why because the word of the Lord
[1:26:15] come to the prophet and Jesus himself
[1:26:18] being God knew that it was his word that
[1:26:21] come to them amen they spoke his word
[1:26:24] word not their word and he knew it had
[1:26:26] to come to pass he so knew that the word
[1:26:31] come to pass he knew that God honors the
[1:26:33] word of a Vindicated prophet he knew
[1:26:36] that he based his whole entire Ministry
[1:26:40] on what the prophets of the Old
[1:26:42] Testament said he based his entire
[1:26:46] future upon the words of the prophets
[1:26:49] amen for John 2:19 Jesus said unto them
[1:26:53] destroy this Temple and with in 3 days I
[1:26:56] will raise it up again well what is he
[1:26:59] saying amen he went back and knew what a
[1:27:03] prophet had said of the Old Testament
[1:27:06] therefore he believed that prophet and
[1:27:09] he declared to them that you can kill me
[1:27:12] but I will raise
[1:27:15] again in three days for Psalms amen uh
[1:27:20] uh 16:10 for thou wi not leave my so in
[1:27:25] Hell neither wil thou suffer thine Holy
[1:27:28] One to see corruption amen Jesus knew
[1:27:31] that that scripture spoke of him a
[1:27:33] prophet a man a man yet speaking an
[1:27:37] eternal word and here come God himself
[1:27:42] made flesh which was the word amen and
[1:27:46] he would go back to that prophecy and he
[1:27:49] would base his entire future upon that
[1:27:52] amen you can determine to kill me but I
[1:27:55] will rise again because it's spoken by
[1:27:58] the word of a
[1:28:00] prophet can you say amen amen in other
[1:28:03] words he wasn't
[1:28:05] confused he understood the words of a
[1:28:07] prophet so he wasn't confused with the
[1:28:10] church of that day he wasn't confused
[1:28:12] with their ideology and their
[1:28:14] interpretations of the scripture amen oh
[1:28:18] thank God for that amen see so the
[1:28:21] spirit of God was speaking right through
[1:28:22] that prophet and the words that came
[1:28:26] from the prophet
[1:28:28] became Jesus Christ
[1:28:33] absolute right are you with me now the
[1:28:36] words that came out of that Prophet
[1:28:39] Jesus took it for his
[1:28:42] absolute that's
[1:28:44] right yes sir all I can say is this
[1:28:47] message is our
[1:28:49] absolute it may not be yours but it is
[1:28:52] mine can you say
[1:28:56] Amen now if you look at at Luke
[1:29:00] 2445 speaking of of where he's he told
[1:29:04] them old fo slow of heart to believe all
[1:29:07] that the prophets said now notice then
[1:29:10] he opened their understanding that they
[1:29:13] might understand the scriptures so he
[1:29:16] didn't just leave them in the dark he
[1:29:18] didn't just leave them wondering in
[1:29:20] confusion as to what is going on but by
[1:29:24] mercy and Grace he opened their
[1:29:28] understanding that they could come out
[1:29:31] of the
[1:29:32] confusion and now understand what has to
[1:29:37] happen
[1:29:39] Hallelujah no longer confused about what
[1:29:42] to believe and what to uh uh to follow
[1:29:48] Malachi 4:5 behold I will send you
[1:29:51] Elijah the
[1:29:53] prophet amen right who who wrote it who
[1:29:56] who whose word is this has to be the
[1:29:59] word of God came forth from a prophet
[1:30:02] speaking of a prophet ain't that right
[1:30:05] behold I will send you Elijah the
[1:30:07] prophet before the coming of the great
[1:30:09] and Dreadful day of the Lord and and we
[1:30:12] we ain't going to get into all of that
[1:30:14] but we we know that beyond the shot of a
[1:30:17] doubt that that applies for our day in
[1:30:18] this age can you say amen and so then
[1:30:23] and uh a prophet is always God's way
[1:30:26] everybody say it's always God's way a
[1:30:29] prophet is always God's way of making
[1:30:33] his voice known to his
[1:30:36] people thus the seventh angel is God's
[1:30:42] Prophet God Amen can you say Amen when
[1:30:46] God sends his prophet and gives a sign
[1:30:48] then it takes his voice and then takes
[1:30:51] his voice that began being spoken before
[1:30:56] on his word and vindicates it by this
[1:30:59] man and they know that it's his voice
[1:31:02] because it's the promised word of the
[1:31:04] day so again the prophet would tell us
[1:31:08] the coming of a prophet is a sign that's
[1:31:10] overlooked by the people every time they
[1:31:13] Overlook it they can they never get it
[1:31:16] somehow L it's those uh who are got
[1:31:20] their eyes open to see it and those who
[1:31:22] are elected to see it it does see it
[1:31:26] does see it God ain't going to waste his
[1:31:29] time God ain't wasting his time sending
[1:31:31] the prophet in this
[1:31:33] age ain't that right right the M
[1:31:36] majority of the world don't believe it
[1:31:37] and some in the message you know are
[1:31:39] scared of it and afraid to Proclaim it
[1:31:41] but God ain't wasting his time there is
[1:31:44] going to be an elect that holds to this
[1:31:47] we all to shout of it doubt because they
[1:31:50] they're not
[1:31:51] confused amen can you say Amen now in
[1:31:56] our opening scripture we can see that
[1:31:58] this isn't just a casual coming
[1:32:01] out you just didn't happen to come out
[1:32:05] amen but this is a Deliverance yes come
[1:32:10] out of her my people what was it it's a
[1:32:13] time of
[1:32:14] Deliverance for God's people amen can
[1:32:17] you say amen that's right see it's a
[1:32:20] message this what is this message of of
[1:32:23] the day it's message of Deliverance amen
[1:32:26] that's remember at the first Exodus
[1:32:29] Moses come with the message of
[1:32:32] Deliverance not to leave the people
[1:32:34] there but to come out of her it's time
[1:32:36] to come out there's a promise that that
[1:32:40] we've got to obtain to that there there
[1:32:42] are things for you there's an
[1:32:44] inheritance for you you got to come out
[1:32:46] to go
[1:32:48] into so is it in this day in this Third
[1:32:51] Exodus it's time to come out
[1:32:55] it's a message of Deliverance amen you
[1:32:59] believe
[1:33:00] it see so so God's message has always
[1:33:05] been a message of Deliverance Just
[1:33:07] Before
[1:33:08] Destruction Moses come with the message
[1:33:11] of Deliverance Joshua even he came with
[1:33:14] the message of
[1:33:15] Deliverance oh my just when they were
[1:33:18] getting ready to take that city of
[1:33:21] Jericho there was an ele in them
[1:33:25] walls
[1:33:26] hallelujah amen so the message would not
[1:33:29] destroy everybody but there was that
[1:33:31] message that would rescue that he
[1:33:34] let thank God for the message lot had
[1:33:38] Deliverance before Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:33:41] was
[1:33:43] destroyed hello that's what a prophet
[1:33:46] said just quoting him right so now
[1:33:50] notice in this 18th vers or chapter two
[1:33:53] Revelations 18:2 he cried mightily with
[1:33:57] a strong voice am it didn't say loud it
[1:34:01] said strong yet it's the same thing see
[1:34:05] he cried mightily with a strong voice
[1:34:08] which is again voice of authority amen
[1:34:12] and you say Amen so then we know that
[1:34:15] this has to be the voice of God for that
[1:34:17] is the only voice amen with authority
[1:34:20] the word of God is the only thing that's
[1:34:22] got Authority in your life
[1:34:24] do you believe that when it speaks it
[1:34:27] brings things into existence when it
[1:34:29] speaks even death has to flee even
[1:34:32] trouble has to flee remember on the boat
[1:34:35] the voice of God spoke through that
[1:34:37] human body and said peace be still and
[1:34:41] the winds and the waves immediately calm
[1:34:43] down and they listen to the voice of
[1:34:46] their
[1:34:47] creator you believe it it's a voice of
[1:34:50] authority now notice the voice of
[1:34:52] authority screamed out Babylon the great
[1:34:55] is
[1:34:56] Fallen is fallen and is become now
[1:35:00] notice the
[1:35:02] habitation The Dwelling Place the house
[1:35:06] of
[1:35:07] devils and the hold I looked up that
[1:35:10] word it it means a watching a guarding
[1:35:14] hence
[1:35:15] imprisonment Ward a keeping it it's
[1:35:18] become the hold a a prison of every f
[1:35:24] inure spirit and a cage or a dungeon of
[1:35:29] every unclean and hateful Bird right can
[1:35:32] you say Amen see so those who are in
[1:35:36] Babylon are spiritually Bound by
[1:35:42] demonic powers on now amen hello yes
[1:35:47] that's why it's the voice of Deliverance
[1:35:49] it's a message of Deliverance in this
[1:35:51] day you could not come out
[1:35:54] except a voice greened right yes that
[1:35:58] voice of authority over your life right
[1:36:01] and notice how it was exercised in this
[1:36:03] age the voice of authority it challenged
[1:36:06] every spirit said I'd take every Spirit
[1:36:09] under my in under my
[1:36:11] control every Spirit it didn't matter if
[1:36:14] that Spirit was in a in a in in in the
[1:36:17] physical real where even the doctors
[1:36:20] could not do anything with it that voice
[1:36:22] of author was peing that devil had to
[1:36:26] leave it didn't matter if it was if it
[1:36:29] was a drunk woman an
[1:36:31] alcoholic what was her name
[1:36:34] Rosier Rosella
[1:36:36] Rosella trying everything her life was
[1:36:40] wrecked but when the voice
[1:36:43] spoke it brought a Deliverance to that
[1:36:47] woman can you say
[1:36:50] Amen see so this this this authoritative
[1:36:55] voice is exposing what Babylon is and
[1:37:00] and you remember John called it mystery
[1:37:03] babyon and and mystery is something not
[1:37:06] understood it's it's confusion
[1:37:09] everything about Babylon is confusion
[1:37:11] that's that's exactly what it means the
[1:37:13] word Babylon means confusion it's
[1:37:16] something that's not understood
[1:37:17] mysterious secretive Beyond
[1:37:20] understanding but now it's no longer
[1:37:23] mystery to that
[1:37:25] elect where it's been exposed as to what
[1:37:29] it is can you say Amen those who have
[1:37:32] heard the voice yes sir see so in
[1:37:37] Revelations
[1:37:38] 1:10 talks about the voice of God is as
[1:37:42] a trumpet I was in the spirit on the
[1:37:45] Lord's day and heard behind me a great
[1:37:48] voice Still's talking about the spirit
[1:37:50] of Truth Now a voice as a great trumpet
[1:37:54] see and and and then if you look at at
[1:37:57] Revelations 4:1 after this I looked and
[1:38:00] behold a door was open in heaven and the
[1:38:03] first voice which I heard was as it were
[1:38:06] of a trumpet talking with me which said
[1:38:09] come up pther see so the voice of God
[1:38:12] was like unto a trumpet look look at at
[1:38:16] uh 1 Corinthians 15 and 51 behold I show
[1:38:19] you a mystery we shall not all sleep but
[1:38:22] we shall all be changed
[1:38:24] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:38:26] at the last trumpet see at the last
[1:38:28] Trump for the trumpet shall sound that
[1:38:31] voice of God shall
[1:38:34] speak that voice of authority is going
[1:38:38] to speak and the dead shall be raised
[1:38:41] Incorruptible and we shall be
[1:38:45] changed now we know when when in the
[1:38:47] Bible when the trumpet sounded there
[1:38:50] they had urgency it wasn't just just a
[1:38:53] blow
[1:38:54] it it had urgency and and it called the
[1:38:57] people together can you say Amen sir
[1:39:00] it's it's you know it's it's like the
[1:39:03] herald uh the king's messenger coming to
[1:39:05] the people he blows on the trumpet it's
[1:39:07] an urgent call and and the people gather
[1:39:10] around to listen see it it was the
[1:39:12] sounding of the trumpet that calls
[1:39:14] Israel together now brother Braham says
[1:39:17] trumpet always denotes war or a feast
[1:39:20] day ain't that right Jeremiah 4:19 says
[1:39:23] I cannot hold my peace because thou has
[1:39:26] heard oh my soul the sound of the
[1:39:28] trumpet the alarm of
[1:39:32] War man amen what's caused political
[1:39:36] disturbances what's caused the religious
[1:39:38] disturbances what's caused the the
[1:39:40] national International War World
[1:39:42] disturbances and all that a trumpet has
[1:39:44] sounded the voice of God has sounded
[1:39:49] it amen demons upon every hand yeah it's
[1:39:53] a raging of War raging of War can you
[1:39:57] say amen amen this the Satan's kingdom
[1:40:01] has been
[1:40:02] Disturbed Satan's kingdom has been
[1:40:05] challenged in this day are you with me
[1:40:09] he's been able to keep people from age
[1:40:12] after age after age every time God would
[1:40:14] send a Revival amen uh uh uh Satan's
[1:40:18] stronghold would be able to bring him
[1:40:19] back into captivity but it's in this age
[1:40:23] there is a people that'll never go back
[1:40:26] the voice of God has broken the
[1:40:30] Cycles broken the Cycles yes sir yes sir
[1:40:34] so this voice has caused a disturbance a
[1:40:37] a a a spiritual war we understand that
[1:40:41] 200,000,000 demons as as as mentioned in
[1:40:45] Revelations have been loosed in the
[1:40:47] ecclesiastical Rim can you say Amen so
[1:40:51] so why why is all this because there is
[1:40:53] is a people that Satan thought he
[1:40:56] had Satan thought he could destroy but a
[1:41:00] voice of authority has said come out of
[1:41:03] her
[1:41:05] amen that's right that's right darkness
[1:41:07] is gathering itself to fight the light
[1:41:10] can you say Amen the forces of Darkness
[1:41:14] you see when a man is confused he he
[1:41:18] doesn't know where he's going doesn't
[1:41:20] know what to believe who to believe he's
[1:41:22] unable to deser burn between right and
[1:41:25] wrong this is one of the things that
[1:41:28] that you know causes Amnesia has been
[1:41:30] caught between two opinions and buddy
[1:41:34] that's been so in this age you know
[1:41:37] you're hearing this and you hear you
[1:41:39] hear God's word and then you hear what
[1:41:41] Satan says you're Son of God and and
[1:41:45] then Satan says well you're not a Son of
[1:41:46] God the voice of God says you're going
[1:41:48] in Rapture and Satan says well you're
[1:41:50] not going into Rapture you're just full
[1:41:52] of mistakes and if you keep catching in
[1:41:55] between them opinions you're going to
[1:41:57] have amnesia yeah amen can you say Amen
[1:42:02] but the message is not just to teach us
[1:42:04] intellect it's to call us out of
[1:42:07] Babylon call us out to shake that
[1:42:10] Amnesia why because the sons of God are
[1:42:14] recognizing who they are they're not
[1:42:17] being caught in Amnesia forgetting what
[1:42:19] they are where they belong and all that
[1:42:21] no we are understanding more and more we
[1:42:23] came from God we're going back to God we
[1:42:26] always were a Son of God you always were
[1:42:29] a daughter of God you always were saved
[1:42:32] you always were beloved in the eyes of
[1:42:34] God can you say Amen am see so God is
[1:42:39] calling us out of the confusion to where
[1:42:42] we have full Assurance everybody say
[1:42:44] full Assurance full Assurance to know
[1:42:47] what truth
[1:42:49] is amen do you believe that amen amen as
[1:42:53] we get ready to wind down in the
[1:42:55] beginning of the Bible man was given the
[1:42:58] word of God to live by amen but Satan
[1:43:03] came in through the
[1:43:05] serpent and he misrepresented the word
[1:43:09] amen he he spoke what God Said but then
[1:43:13] he misrepresented that ain't that right
[1:43:18] yes sir he misrepresented he didn't just
[1:43:21] tell an outright lie amen and that's
[1:43:24] what the Bible says that God would send
[1:43:26] them strong delusion that they'd believe
[1:43:28] the lie the LIE amen not just an
[1:43:33] outright lie of standing behind p and
[1:43:35] say God doesn't exist God hates you and
[1:43:39] God you know is going to destroy you and
[1:43:42] God's going to this and this and this oh
[1:43:43] no no no nothing like that he oh God
[1:43:46] loves you and God this and God that but
[1:43:49] but you know God loves you God don't
[1:43:52] mind you he understands where you are he
[1:43:55] understands your sins he he he man now
[1:43:59] they you know some of them are even
[1:44:00] saying he Jesus Christ was a
[1:44:02] homosexual you know and and and they're
[1:44:04] saying it this and they're saying it
[1:44:06] this and they're saying it that and and
[1:44:08] see they're they're sugarcoating the
[1:44:09] gospel and that's exactly what Satan
[1:44:11] done is they he sugarcoated the gospel
[1:44:15] can you say amen and Eve should have
[1:44:18] walked away from them amen because she
[1:44:20] already knew what the word was she knew
[1:44:24] what the word of God clearly was before
[1:44:27] Satan even came to her now you and I we
[1:44:30] didn't even know what the word was
[1:44:32] before Satan got to us but she did and
[1:44:36] yet she stopped to listen to him and by
[1:44:39] the time he got done listen or talking
[1:44:43] she was
[1:44:44] confused right she didn't know what to
[1:44:49] believe right to where she thought she
[1:44:51] was doing right that's right that's
[1:44:54] right by listening to the devil she
[1:44:57] actually thought she was obeying God can
[1:45:00] you imagine deceive yeah but in this day
[1:45:04] Satan was able to to do whatever get us
[1:45:07] all caught up in
[1:45:09] things and then God would send a voice
[1:45:12] afterward see God got to e first and
[1:45:16] told him don't you do this and she had
[1:45:19] the
[1:45:20] word but she allowed Satan to penetrate
[1:45:24] and talk but in this age God allows
[1:45:28] Satan to give it everything he's got all
[1:45:31] right then he comes to us with his word
[1:45:34] all right can you say Amen yes sir now
[1:45:38] look she believed every bit of the word
[1:45:40] of God but the prophet said she was
[1:45:43] confused on one promise and that is the
[1:45:45] same yesterday today and forever and
[1:45:47] under the temptation of the enemy she
[1:45:51] failed on one promise yeah can you say
[1:45:54] Amen but if you look in this evil age
[1:45:58] this now Satan was able to do that to
[1:46:00] even God's eeden yeah that was God's
[1:46:03] eeden right he's the one that created it
[1:46:06] yeah right Satan had no
[1:46:09] power Satan cannot create he just
[1:46:12] perverts this is Satan's Eden amen uh of
[1:46:18] perversion he's been able to do his Eden
[1:46:21] by perverting amen ain't that right
[1:46:24] right so so in this evil age of
[1:46:29] Satan's Eden God has got a bride all
[1:46:33] right God calling her out of Babylon
[1:46:36] notice brother briam said who is coming
[1:46:39] in contact Again by the same thing same
[1:46:43] word hello pure word pure word straight
[1:46:47] from the voice of God that's right right
[1:46:51] not not filtered not not not not uh a
[1:46:55] third person third party no no straight
[1:46:59] from the mouth of God God has now given
[1:47:03] his people his word to where they ain't
[1:47:06] going to be confused about nothing
[1:47:08] that's right God can you say amen amen
[1:47:12] you don't have to be in the message of
[1:47:14] this age and stand
[1:47:18] confused ain't got no reason for it just
[1:47:21] simply take God at his word just simply
[1:47:24] believe what a prophet said whether you
[1:47:27] understand it or not the world is going
[1:47:29] to change their convictions are changing
[1:47:32] and it's getting worse that's right and
[1:47:34] then it makes us look like we're nuts it
[1:47:37] looks makes us look like we're just we
[1:47:39] just don't understand about life and we
[1:47:41] just don't understand and we're just
[1:47:43] hateful we're racist we're this we're
[1:47:45] that we ain't none of that we're just
[1:47:47] standing upon the word of God that came
[1:47:50] from a mouth of a prophet on yeah that's
[1:47:53] exactly right so you can see why it was
[1:47:56] important for the seventh angel to sound
[1:47:59] why because the word is to be restored
[1:48:01] by his message ain't that right this
[1:48:05] bride is not believing a denominational
[1:48:08] truth it's not believing a truth that
[1:48:11] the world is clinging to remember
[1:48:13] they're accepting it as truth but God
[1:48:16] himself says it's a lie but the spirit
[1:48:20] of Truth has come and sounded through a
[1:48:23] voice of a
[1:48:26] prophet thus sayth the Lord can you say
[1:48:31] amen that's good yes sir so she is
[1:48:34] believing something that's been
[1:48:35] supernaturally Vindicated I know there's
[1:48:37] all kinds of prophets in the age today
[1:48:40] always been of all kinds of
[1:48:42] things yeah but God always vindicates
[1:48:45] his Prophet
[1:48:47] supernaturally can you say amen and
[1:48:50] notice and God is proving
[1:48:53] in this age in the most evil age the
[1:48:56] most deceptive age far more deceptive
[1:48:59] than one it was in Eve's
[1:49:02] age that Spirit of deception was in its
[1:49:05] infant stage that now it's come to its
[1:49:08] maturity amen so much confusion so much
[1:49:12] people don't know what to do and yet in
[1:49:15] this age God is
[1:49:18] proving that this little bride is is is
[1:49:22] not like Eve and that she is not that
[1:49:25] type of woman notice brother BR said she
[1:49:28] will be Tried by his word the bride
[1:49:31] listen we don't need another Messenger
[1:49:35] to come we've already got it God Is So
[1:49:39] Vindicated
[1:49:42] it to be the truth now you're going to
[1:49:46] be
[1:49:47] tried you're going to be
[1:49:50] tested you're going to be proven right
[1:49:53] why why the tests why the trials why all
[1:49:56] these things the challenges because God
[1:49:59] is proven to Satan that you're not like
[1:50:02] Eve you will never be like Eve that's
[1:50:05] true you will stand you will not fail
[1:50:10] you've come out of confusion you were in

[1:50:28] no confusion about predestination not to
[1:50:31] this bride there is no confusion about
[1:50:35] communion or water baptism there is no
[1:50:38] confusion about
[1:50:40] adoption there is no confusion as as to

[1:50:45] interpretation of tongues and how they
[1:50:47] are to be operated in the church there
[1:50:49] is no confusion not to those who have
[1:50:52] listened to the voice and come out of
[1:50:56] Babylon yes sir amen there's no
[1:50:59] confusion about God having a five-fold
[1:51:02] Ministry operating today there's no

[1:51:16] say Amen there's no confusion on how to
[1:51:18] be saved there's no confusion as to what
