[42:57] 13th on
[42:59] Sunday and um anyway it's hard to
[43:03] believe that the meeting is already
[43:04] coming up and getting all geared up and
[43:07] prepared and and so looking forward to a
[43:10] wonderful time in the
[43:12] Lord um and uh so I think um this um uh
[43:18] Sunday brother Sandy and His
[43:21] congregation will be coming or uh some
[43:24] of them or uh Saturday and Sunday and so
[43:28] uh uh looking forward to having them as
[43:31] well to be in service with us and uh uh
[43:35] so uh been a while since we've got to
[43:38] see brother Sandy and uh sister Hannah
[43:41] and uh so it'll be good to have them uh
[43:44] before we go into the word may we just
[43:46] bow our heads and talk to our Lord and
[43:50] uh
[43:51] father Lord we stand before you
[43:55] realizing our insufficent efficiency and
[43:58] our need for
[44:00] you father I just pray Lord that you
[44:04] would come in a special way and just
[44:07] have Supreme control over this portion
[44:12] of the
[44:13] service lord it's your word and it's
[44:17] anointed father for it come from you
[44:20] these are words of life and now we pray
[44:24] that you would just anoint your servant
[44:26] and father help me to yield myself to
[44:29] you and that you could take what simple
[44:32] words we would have and that you would
[44:33] multiply them to the people and may
[44:38] they just uh the words find a beding
[44:42] ground in every heart Lord father draw
[44:46] us closer to you as our prayer and Lord
[44:49] we be careful to give you praise and
[44:51] glory in Jesus Christ's name amen
[44:57] so we look at John the 19th Chapter and
[45:02] I'm just going to read the 30th
[45:07] verse and it says when Jesus therefore
[45:10] had received the vinegar he said it is
[45:14] finished everybody say it with me it is
[45:16] finished and he bowed his head and gave
[45:20] up the ghost you can have your seats
[45:23] this
[45:25] evening and um
[45:29] I will use the title again it is
[45:31] finished and I'm so glad for
[45:36] that what a reality that is to us
[45:39] and it it must be a revelation to us as
[45:43] all things of the
[45:45] scriptures uh must be um and it must be
[45:52] um uh predominant in this age because
[45:57] there is so much fear so much anxiety so
[46:02] much worry that is prevailing in the
[46:05] land
[46:06] today um it's a fulfillment of Prophecy
[46:10] for Jesus said that there would be uh
[46:13] men's Hearts would fail them for
[46:16] fear and the prophet he said this he
[46:19] said the biggest trouble there is in the
[46:23] church today is a bunch of fear so not
[46:26] just not just fear in the world but they
[46:29] fear in the
[46:31] church and and of course fear does not
[46:34] come from God it's of the devil for the
[46:37] Bible says that God has not given us the
[46:39] spirit of fear but of love peace and a
[46:43] sound mind so he says people's always
[46:47] scared and that's of the devil now
[46:51] notice what he says next don't be scared
[46:55] now this is the prophet of God tell
[46:56] telling us don't be scared be brave
[47:00] everybody say be brave see he said you
[47:03] don't have to uh have nothing to be then
[47:06] he says there ain't nothing to be afraid
[47:09] about see there's nothing to be afraid
[47:12] about simple words but what a
[47:15] revelation when fear is trying to grip
[47:18] the hearts of the people not only out in
[47:20] the world but in the church a prophet
[47:24] stands and tells us there's nothing to
[47:27] be scared or afraid about so people are
[47:31] afraid uh in in one place he tells us
[47:34] that people are afraid that they ain't
[47:37] going to get
[47:38] healed uh and we could say that they're
[47:41] afraid that they're not going to get
[47:43] their Deliverance they're afraid that
[47:46] they're not going to get their prayer
[47:47] answered maybe they're praying for lost
[47:51] loved ones or whatever and they're
[47:52] afraid that somehow something's going to
[47:55] happen to them before
[47:57] uh uh uh they give their heart to the
[47:59] Lord or or whatever but the prophet says
[48:03] uh they're
[48:04] scared that God will not keep his word
[48:08] now now that's all part of the devil
[48:09] just as well so so there are there are
[48:12] people that are uh uh they're scared
[48:15] they're they're fearful of looking for
[48:18] things that are coming up on the earth
[48:20] they don't know anything about the
[48:21] future they they they're they're just
[48:23] running scared and then there's people
[48:26] that are just scared that God won't keep
[48:29] their word keep keep his word and and
[48:32] brother brandom says in another place
[48:34] the American Christian seems to be
[48:37] afraid that God won't keep his word now
[48:39] that's the American Christian and afraid
[48:42] if you just don't squeeze and hold or
[48:46] something he said see it's nothing that
[48:49] you can do in the beginning it's what
[48:52] God has done can you say Amen so this
[48:57] this word finished it it is finished as
[49:00] as we talked about it last Wednesday I
[49:02] believe it means entirely done amen
[49:07] that's what finished is it means there's
[49:09] nothing else to be done it's uh uh
[49:12] nothing that uh uh anyone can do and and
[49:15] he says the whole Plan of Salvation all
[49:18] that can be done for mankind by the
[49:21] heart of God was finished when Christ
[49:24] said those words it is finished the
[49:28] whole plan of God was finished at that
[49:30] time now he says now in another place
[49:33] what is finished then our complete
[49:36] ticket all the way to Glory it's
[49:40] finished can you say Amen so he didn't
[49:42] just finish the beginning part of your
[49:45] life amen but he finished it all the way
[49:48] to Glory it is finished and he says it
[49:52] was wrote out at Calvary in the blood of
[49:56] Jesus Christ Christ so then all we have
[49:59] to do is rest brother Matthew that
[50:01] that's all we've got to do is is just
[50:04] rest and so I looked up in the Webster
[50:07] what what does rest mean and and it
[50:09] means freedom from labor you don't have
[50:13] to labor you're free from it you're
[50:15] you're at rest that's that's all you've
[50:17] got to do is just rest it means to
[50:20] refrain from labor or exertion to be
[50:24] free from anxiety or dis disturbance
[50:27] ain't that right see so this is what was
[50:30] given to us when when the plan of God
[50:33] was finished at at Calvary brother
[50:36] brandham says there's nothing there can
[50:39] be nothing else added to it nothing else
[50:43] taken from it that settles it the Bible
[50:47] is finished the plan of God is finished
[50:50] the atonement is made the devil is
[50:53] defeated and the only thing we have to
[50:56] do do is look and live can you say amen
[51:01] amen don't have to recite Creeds don't
[51:04] have to be something special all you
[51:06] have to do is look and live ain't that
[51:10] right but it's it's funny of how that
[51:13] man always wants to have something uh uh
[51:16] to do with his salvation and and the
[51:20] prophet had dealt with it uh uh uh many
[51:23] times and but but th this comes from the
[51:26] Fallen nature that carnal nature of of
[51:30] man where he has to have something to do
[51:32] with it it was after that man had sinned
[51:35] or Adam had sinned that he tried to
[51:37] cover himself up and and uh the prophet
[51:40] said the holy image of God had had left
[51:43] him and and so now he's he's left with a
[51:47] carnal nature a a backsliding sinful
[51:50] State and and all of these things and so
[51:53] in his carnal State he he came up with
[51:57] his own covering his own religion Amen
[52:00] to cover him and and and and and and and
[52:04] to act as though uh nothing was a Miss
[52:07] nothing was wrong but we find that that
[52:09] covering didn't work amen when God come
[52:12] in the cool of the evening and and Adam
[52:16] uh ran and hid from God ain't that right
[52:20] but see we we find the Bible says the
[52:22] carnal mind is enity against God for it
[52:26] is is not subject to the law of God
[52:29] neither indeed can be so all of our own
[52:32] efforts to cover ourselves and to have
[52:34] our own religion and and to do something
[52:38] uh uh for our Salvation amen is always
[52:42] contrary to God's plan because we do it
[52:45] by a carnal nature we do it uh from a
[52:48] carnal standpoint ain't that right amen
[52:51] so man-made religion will not work
[52:53] there's nothing that that will work do
[52:56] you believe that amen there is nothing
[52:59] and and and we I know this is simple but
[53:01] there there's not one of us uh that can
[53:04] save ourselves amen you you there's no
[53:08] you can't be educated enough can't be
[53:10] good enough smart enough Rich enough or
[53:13] whatever as the prophet said we're all
[53:15] born defeated amen we're all born
[53:19] defeated and so therefore we all have
[53:21] something common in common now now there
[53:24] may be uh uh guys that are very rich and
[53:27] and uh here we are we we we may not be
[53:30] doing too good uh in in business-wise or
[53:33] MoneyWise or or whatever but but what
[53:37] makes us all common is we're all born
[53:40] defeated can you say amen amen see and
[53:44] and and yet God allowed us to be born
[53:47] this way amen he allowed it Romans 8
[53:50] and2 tells us that we were made subject
[53:54] to vanity not willingly
[53:57] but by reason of him who subjected the
[54:00] same in Hope ain't that right so God
[54:04] subjected us to vanity God subjected us
[54:08] to uh uh allowed us to be born Sinners
[54:11] and and allowed us to be M Misfits and
[54:15] uh to to to you know to to be Renegades
[54:19] if if you could say that way he allowed
[54:21] us to be miserable failures and he he he
[54:24] made it to where we would have our
[54:27] complexes and our struggles and and our
[54:30] mistakes and uh to be he allowed us to
[54:33] be trapped into sin can you say amen he
[54:36] made it to where we would know defeat
[54:38] and and what it would be uh like to to
[54:42] be enslaved to to the devil and to be
[54:45] afflicted he made it to where we would
[54:47] be helpless and and hopeless and uh uh
[54:52] uh full of uh of uh of things that we
[54:55] have to deal with with in this in this
[54:57] old flesh but see God made it that way
[55:00] but yet the same God that made us
[55:02] subject to this vanity also made us
[55:05] subject to a hope a ain't that right see
[55:09] but it would take a work of Grace amen
[55:12] he didn't just subject us to vanity and
[55:15] then to Hope and then leave us to our
[55:18] own self to get us out of the mud pit
[55:21] and and get us out of the condition of
[55:24] vanity and hopelessness and and and
[55:27] unworthiness and and get us to a place
[55:30] amen that's not up to us it would take
[55:32] an work of Grace aren't you glad for
[55:35] that amen a work of Grace to bring us
[55:38] from one condition to uh another amen
[55:43] for as we all know if you've lived long
[55:45] enough you cannot pull your own self up
[55:47] by your own bootstraps amen see and so
[55:50] we were all born as the prophet would
[55:53] call it uh you know like an like man in
[55:56] a pit that had fallen in a pit trying to
[55:59] get back up trying to scramble trying to
[56:02] climb his way but the walls are too
[56:04] smooth and too slick and too high and
[56:08] and there there's no way we could get
[56:10] our own foothold and climb our way up
[56:13] and and all of these things uh we we
[56:15] have nothing to pull ourselves up can
[56:17] you say Amen so God made it to where
[56:20] that the only thing that could get us
[56:23] out is he himself amen he he would do
[56:27] that and you know we sing that old song
[56:29] Love Lifted
[56:31] Me Love Lifted Me when nothing else
[56:34] could help God's Love Lifted Me ain't
[56:38] that right so you know men men through
[56:42] through uh history throughout history
[56:44] and time has um uh been able to maybe
[56:48] some men have been able to break uh uh
[56:51] uh uh past and break through break out
[56:54] of the most secured prisons in the world
[56:57] and and and they were held in captive in
[57:01] in some building or some dungeon and and
[57:05] natural bars and and they were able
[57:07] maybe to dig themselves out or uh uh do
[57:10] do whatever but see our captivity uh was
[57:14] a spiritual condition ain't that right
[57:17] amen and and so no man uh uh is able to
[57:21] escape that um the the condemnation of
[57:25] sin that that weighs him him down amen
[57:29] he can't escape that on his own he can't
[57:31] escape the carnal nature within him on
[57:35] his own he he cannot escape the carnal
[57:38] desires that come from within amen as we
[57:42] have seen you know every New Year people
[57:44] are making a New Year's Revolution and
[57:47] and uh uh turning over a new Leaf but
[57:50] they're all the time failing because
[57:52] they can't escape that carnal nature
[57:55] that thing that makes them do what they
[57:57] do they can't escape it and and so they
[58:01] they find themselves a slave no man can
[58:05] overcome the death sentence that he is
[58:07] under on his own ain't that right amen
[58:11] but God made it amen he made it to where
[58:14] he would be the hero to our story and
[58:18] our story is not one of of Vagabond our
[58:23] story isn't one of of just a sinner a
[58:26] rotten no good but our story is a story
[58:30] of
[58:31] redemption can you say amen and so God
[58:34] made it to where he would get the glory
[58:37] and honor and praise from us amen Isaiah
[58:41] 43 and 13 God says yay before the day
[58:44] was I am he and there is none that can
[58:49] deliver out of my hand and and I tell
[58:52] you church that's exactly the way God
[58:54] wanted it amen he didn't need help from
[58:57] us he didn't need help from you the
[58:59] preacher or or or the the the pope or or
[59:03] whatever in him alone is the attribute
[59:07] of Savior in him alone is the attribute
[59:12] of healer there is no doctor that can
[59:15] heal there is no preacher that can heal
[59:17] there is nobody there's no medicine that
[59:20] can heal God Alone is our healer God
[59:24] Alone is our savior Our Redeemer our
[59:28] deliverer amen so there is no other
[59:31] savior God speaks in in Isaiah 46 and5
[59:36] saying to whom will you liken me see and
[59:39] make me equal and compare me that we may
[59:41] be alike amen see so God knows amen that
[59:45] there's nothing like him amen there's
[59:48] God knows that amen out anything outside
[59:52] of him is a creation he's the only
[59:54] Creator can you say Amen amen he's not
[59:57] just an inventor he's a Creator man
[1:00:00] invents things God creates things a
[1:00:03] ain't that right see and so God knows
[1:00:06] that we cannot save ourselves amen and
[1:00:09] he knows that that no man uh preacher
[1:00:13] Deacon uh doctor whatever has that
[1:00:16] ability uh uh to heal there is no not a
[1:00:19] denomination that can re redeem or
[1:00:22] deliver uh there there's no politician
[1:00:26] that that that can bring uh uh what we
[1:00:29] need and God knows that ain't that right
[1:00:32] so this is why he would say in Isaiah 22
[1:00:35] or
[1:00:36] 45:22 look unto me ain't that right amen
[1:00:40] there's one thing that we need to look
[1:00:42] at in this age and that's to God don't
[1:00:45] look at a personality don't look at a
[1:00:47] man don't look at a church don't look at
[1:00:49] a religion don't look at a Doctrine
[1:00:51] don't look at anything else but look
[1:00:54] unto him and he says look unto me and be
[1:00:58] ye saved to all the ends of the Earth
[1:01:01] for I am God and there is none else amen
[1:01:06] I think that's our Christian that's is
[1:01:08] the the the point of Christian life is
[1:01:10] to understand that he is God and there
[1:01:13] is none like him and to understand that
[1:01:16] we are in his hands and and that that
[1:01:19] there's nothing that can deliver take us
[1:01:22] from from his his hands amen so so don't
[1:01:26] look to anyone else amen don't don't
[1:01:29] look to anything else amen don't look to
[1:01:32] yourself don't look to a denomination or
[1:01:35] an organization don't look to your
[1:01:37] family don't look to your husband your
[1:01:39] wife your children your parents don't
[1:01:41] look to a preacher don't look to any
[1:01:44] professional look to him and be ye saved
[1:01:49] all ye ends of the Earth can you say
[1:01:52] Amen now God says here in in Isaiah 46
[1:01:57] and3 hearken unto me oh House of Jacob
[1:02:01] and all the remnant of the House of
[1:02:03] Israel which are born by me from the
[1:02:06] belly which are carried from the womb
[1:02:09] and even to your old age I am he and
[1:02:13] even the hair to hairs will
[1:02:16] I carry you I have made and I will bear
[1:02:21] I even I will carry and I and will
[1:02:25] deliver you can you say Amen so here's
[1:02:27] God promising I'm going to carry you I'm
[1:02:30] going to deliver you I'm the one that
[1:02:32] made you I'm the one that kept you and I
[1:02:35] am the one amen see it's me so to whom
[1:02:38] will you liken me and make me equal and
[1:02:40] compare me that we may be like he says
[1:02:43] they lavish gold out of the bag and
[1:02:45] weigh silver in the balance and hire a
[1:02:48] Goldsmith and he maketh it a god they
[1:02:51] fall down yay they worship they bear him
[1:02:54] upon the shoulder they carry him and set
[1:02:57] him in his place and he standeth and
[1:03:00] from his place shall he not be removed
[1:03:02] or shall he not remove yay not one one
[1:03:06] shall cry unto him yet can he not answer
[1:03:10] nor save him out of his trouble remember
[1:03:13] this and show yourselves men bring it uh
[1:03:17] uh uh again to mind oh ye transgressors
[1:03:20] remember the former things of old for I
[1:03:22] am God and there is none else I am God
[1:03:25] God there is none like me declaring the
[1:03:29] end from the beginning and from the
[1:03:31] ancient times the things that are not
[1:03:32] yet done saying my counsel shall stand
[1:03:36] and I will do all my pleasure can you
[1:03:38] say Amen so so it it is God and and and
[1:03:43] and he should get the glory that's what
[1:03:45] he wants is the glory out of our lives
[1:03:47] he wants the glory out of our songs he
[1:03:50] wants the glory out of our preaching he
[1:03:52] wants the glory out of Our Testimony he
[1:03:54] he wants the glory out of out of our
[1:03:57] worship can you say man everything he
[1:04:00] wants the glory for he's the only one
[1:04:03] that's God Amen we we don't uh uh I I
[1:04:06] know there's Gods out in the world there
[1:04:08] there there's millions of gods amen not
[1:04:11] just outside of Christendom but inside
[1:04:13] of Christendom where men have their own
[1:04:16] imagination of what God is amen
[1:04:19] preachers preaching behind the pulpit
[1:04:21] and deny God the right to be a Healer to
[1:04:24] the people and God the right to come
[1:04:27] down and deliver amen they would rather
[1:04:30] uh lean to a program that man has made
[1:04:34] and teach man uh how to deal with
[1:04:36] alcoholism instead of a God to come down
[1:04:39] and deliver them but see God is God
[1:04:42] ain't that right we shouldn't lean to
[1:04:45] all these crutches and and all these
[1:04:47] man-made things there's one God and he's
[1:04:50] the one that's got us in his hands and
[1:04:53] has promised to deliver us
[1:04:56] now many men have have died and we know
[1:04:59] that uh and you know there have been
[1:05:01] other men that hung on a cross uh like
[1:05:04] Jesus did you know but there's no other
[1:05:07] man's death has that ability had the
[1:05:10] ability Amen to finish the Plan of
[1:05:14] Salvation you see because Jesus wasn't
[1:05:17] just a man but he was God living in a
[1:05:22] human Tabernacle called flesh human
[1:05:25] flesh ain't that right amen and and he
[1:05:28] was created amen he he didn't have the
[1:05:32] human blood as far as sex blood uh
[1:05:35] Gentile blood he you know people call
[1:05:37] him a Jew he was not a Jew people call
[1:05:39] him a gentile or whatever he was not
[1:05:41] such he was neither Jew nor Gentile and
[1:05:44] you're not saved by the blood of a Jew
[1:05:46] or a gentile you're saved by the blood
[1:05:49] of God it was God's creative blood that
[1:05:52] was living or flowing through them veins
[1:05:55] a ain't that right see and so his death
[1:05:59] was was to think of it his death was not
[1:06:02] the result of men taking him captive and
[1:06:05] forcing him to go to Calvary and forcing
[1:06:09] him to lie down on the cross and forcing
[1:06:12] his hands to to to to uh you know
[1:06:17] forcefully holding his hands in place
[1:06:20] his feet and place so they could drive
[1:06:22] and nail and all that no no no many men
[1:06:25] had been forced to die but not this man
[1:06:28] not Christ can you say Amen John 10:17
[1:06:31] Jesus says therefore doth my father
[1:06:34] loved me because I Lay My Life down no
[1:06:39] one took that his life from him he laid
[1:06:43] his life down can you say Amen but he
[1:06:46] had a reason for it amen he had a reason
[1:06:49] no man taketh from me but I lay it down
[1:06:52] of myself I have power to lay it down
[1:06:55] and I have power to take it again this
[1:06:58] commandment have I received of my father
[1:07:01] amen 1 John
[1:07:03] 3:16 it says hereby perceive we the love
[1:07:06] of God because he laid down his life for
[1:07:10] us he laid it down can you say Amen
[1:07:14] think of that that's the god that we
[1:07:15] serve is that God would become human
[1:07:19] being amen so that he could lay down his
[1:07:23] life for us he couldn't do it in spirit
[1:07:26] form amen but he promised that he would
[1:07:29] be Our Redeemer he promised amen that he
[1:07:31] would bring a way back for us to be Sons
[1:07:34] and Daughters of God he promised that he
[1:07:36] wouldn't leave us subject to vanity uh
[1:07:39] uh always amen but he would bring us
[1:07:42] back to a hope can you say amen amen the
[1:07:46] Bible tells us that God commended his
[1:07:48] love toward us in that while we were yet
[1:07:51] sinners Christ died for us amen so that
[1:07:55] he had to do it that way he he couldn't
[1:07:57] wait for us to become righteous and then
[1:07:59] Die For Us amen because we couldn't be
[1:08:02] righteous in that way can you say Amen
[1:08:05] so Calvary is not a work of rebellious
[1:08:09] men it's not even the work of Satan amen
[1:08:14] and and even though these men who
[1:08:15] crucified him was anointed of the devil
[1:08:18] yet calary was not is not a work of
[1:08:21] Satan it's not a work of rebellious men
[1:08:24] it's a work work of Grace can you say
[1:08:27] Amen Calvary is a work of Grace amen
[1:08:31] that he would willfully lay down his
[1:08:35] life amen see this comes from the
[1:08:37] unconditional Covenant that God made see
[1:08:41] it's not what you or I have done it's
[1:08:44] solely based on what he has done can you
[1:08:48] say Amen we are his victory do you
[1:08:51] believe that we are his victory he went
[1:08:54] to fight for us he went to battle for us
[1:08:58] amen he sought to to pay the price for
[1:09:01] us he sought to set us free he sought to
[1:09:03] heal us he sought to redeem us he sought
[1:09:06] to save us and Deliver Us he sought to
[1:09:09] Amen to to answer every one of our
[1:09:12] prayers he sought to live down inside of
[1:09:15] us and to Quicken us amen and we are his
[1:09:19] victory we are we are his victory you
[1:09:22] believe that amen you see and we had
[1:09:26] nothing to do with it amen as as when
[1:09:31] God made that un unconditional Covenant
[1:09:34] with Abraham amen God put him in a deep
[1:09:38] sleep Amen to show that a Abraham had
[1:09:42] nothing to do with this Covenant amen
[1:09:45] it's uh brother brand says see an
[1:09:47] evening time or when the sun went down
[1:09:50] watch what happened first a real deep
[1:09:53] sleep fell over Abraham showing Abraham
[1:09:56] now I made a covenant with Adam Adam if
[1:09:59] you'll do and I'll take you in partners
[1:10:02] with me if you'll do certain things I'll
[1:10:04] do certain things and Adam broke his
[1:10:07] promise man always breaks his promise
[1:10:09] can you say amen and and I'd have to say
[1:10:12] that we've broken our promises brother
[1:10:13] Terry amen all of us have broken our
[1:10:16] promise in one way or another amen so if
[1:10:19] this was another conditional Covenant
[1:10:22] we'd be of all men most wretched and
[1:10:24] miserable and Hell bound but God made an
[1:10:28] unconditional Covenant can you say amen
[1:10:31] that's right see and so he says uh man
[1:10:34] always breaks his Covenant but Abraham
[1:10:37] God says to Abraham but Abraham this is
[1:10:40] this is not what if you'll do this is
[1:10:43] what I'm going to do can you say Amen
[1:10:46] it's not what you do it's what he has
[1:10:49] done this is my Covenant with you
[1:10:53] unconditionally another place Abraham
[1:10:56] I'm just going to shut you off to show
[1:10:59] you there's not one thing you can do
[1:11:02] about it this is my Covenant can you say
[1:11:06] amen God had a covenant that we had
[1:11:09] nothing to do
[1:11:10] [Music]
[1:11:12] with amen another place he says what was
[1:11:15] it God saying now Abraham my son I'm
[1:11:18] going to show you that it's not going to
[1:11:21] be nothing that you have to do I'm going
[1:11:24] to do it anyhow I'm determined to save
[1:11:26] man
[1:11:28] regardless so I'm not making a covenant
[1:11:31] depending upon you like I did Adam I'm
[1:11:34] making a covenant with myself and you
[1:11:36] have nothing to do with it Abraham I'm
[1:11:39] not resting that Covenant up you I'm
[1:11:41] resting that Covenant upon
[1:11:44] me he said I'm determined to save man
[1:11:47] regardless and God's going to do it by
[1:11:49] Grace he will do it can you say Amen see
[1:11:55] so therefore none of us needed to be
[1:11:57] there that day at Calvary amen God could
[1:12:00] have a Calvary and have a sacrifice even
[1:12:04] before we were born amen and and we we
[1:12:07] didn't because we had nothing to do with
[1:12:09] it this was his Covenant that he would
[1:12:13] make with himself can you sayen amen see
[1:12:17] and at that day at Calvary before we had
[1:12:20] done good or evil before we breathe the
[1:12:22] first breath or even recognized upon
[1:12:25] Earth God could say at Calvary it is
[1:12:29] finished can you say amen amen without
[1:12:33] me having to do one thing about it he
[1:12:36] finished it because it's his Covenant
[1:12:38] it's his
[1:12:39] work amen and it was ryant upon
[1:12:44] him Lord finish the work before we were
[1:12:48] even born can you say Amen so if we
[1:12:52] could just see just how secure we are
[1:12:55] amen and quit letting that devil just
[1:12:57] run us
[1:12:58] ragged can you say amen I I I don't
[1:13:01] believe that God has called us to be a
[1:13:03] Christian to live our Christian lives
[1:13:05] afraid of being lost afraid of being
[1:13:08] going to hell afraid of of being turned
[1:13:11] down can you say Amen at the End Amen I
[1:13:14] believe that he sent his spirit in this
[1:13:16] day crying Abba Father amen his Spirit
[1:13:19] within us bearing witness that we are
[1:13:22] sons of God and we need to quit let the
[1:13:25] the devil tell us amen that we're
[1:13:27] Misfits and that we're Bound for hell
[1:13:29] and that we've crossed the line of Mercy
[1:13:32] amen and look to Calvary and say but
[1:13:34] it's
[1:13:40] finished notice John
[1:13:42] 5:24 verily verily I say unto you he
[1:13:45] that heareth my word and believeth on
[1:13:47] him that sent me hath everlasting life
[1:13:50] and shall not everybody say shall not
[1:13:53] shall not come into condemnation
[1:13:57] but is passed from Death un life I'll
[1:14:00] say that again he that heareth my word I
[1:14:03] say the message of the hour he that
[1:14:05] heareth the word for the age can you say
[1:14:09] amen he that knoweth his
[1:14:12] place lord well brother Brown said he
[1:14:15] that understandeth his place for this
[1:14:18] hour amen he that heareth my word and
[1:14:21] believeth on him that sent me hath
[1:14:24] everlasting life
[1:14:26] and shall not come into condemnation you
[1:14:29] think God just you didn't stumble into
[1:14:31] this message just by accident you didn't
[1:14:34] stumble in it well I was born in this
[1:14:36] message so I just couldn't help it amen
[1:14:38] there's a lot of people that was born in
[1:14:40] this message and walked away when he's
[1:14:42] just old enough to do so amen and and
[1:14:45] then there's others preachers that were
[1:14:46] raised in this message and now flat deny
[1:14:49] this message and and curse the the god
[1:14:52] of brother brandom and and and the angel
[1:14:54] and the pillar fire all of these things
[1:14:56] see amen it's no accident that you're
[1:14:59] still believing this message I thank God
[1:15:02] for the message of the hour can you say
[1:15:04] amen amen it's something that Drew me to
[1:15:08] this message it wasn't intellect it
[1:15:11] wasn't amen because there's a retirement
[1:15:13] fund at the end when I get old or
[1:15:16] whatever amen it was the fact that there
[1:15:18] was a deep calling unto the Deep amen
[1:15:21] now notice he that heareth understandeth
[1:15:24] my word and believeth on him that sent
[1:15:26] me hath everlasting life and shall not
[1:15:30] come into condemnation but is already
[1:15:34] passed but is already passed from Death
[1:15:37] un
[1:15:39] life think of that you're already you're
[1:15:43] not in the balance you're not teetering
[1:15:46] the fence you know leaning to death and
[1:15:49] leaning to life and leaning to death and
[1:15:51] trying to hang you've already pass
[1:15:53] you're not on the fence anymore you're
[1:15:55] into
[1:15:56] life you pass from Death under
[1:16:02] life so as Believers we don't have to
[1:16:04] worry about being lost amen and and to
[1:16:07] be honest I God doesn't want us to worry
[1:16:10] about being lost come on
[1:16:13] church that's of the devil that's for
[1:16:16] fear can you sayen sure you got to make
[1:16:19] your calling and election sure and and
[1:16:21] if you don't know where you stand then
[1:16:22] make your calling and election sure
[1:16:26] amen and then stand upon the word amen
[1:16:30] now watch John 6:37 all that the father
[1:16:34] giveth me shall come to me when were
[1:16:36] they given to him before the foundation
[1:16:39] of the
[1:16:40] world when your name was written in the
[1:16:43] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:16:47] hello the lamb was
[1:16:50] slain for them names
[1:16:53] amen amen and all that the father ha
[1:16:56] given
[1:16:57] me shall come to me and him that cometh
[1:17:02] to me I will in no wise cast
[1:17:06] out rough Sinners as we may
[1:17:10] be we may painted the town red and all
[1:17:15] the faults and the failures that's right
[1:17:19] yet he says I will not cast them
[1:17:22] out can you say Amen
[1:17:25] for I came down from heaven not to do my
[1:17:27] own will but the will of him that sent
[1:17:29] me and this is aren't you glad he knew
[1:17:32] this is the Father's
[1:17:34] will that sent me that all of uh that of
[1:17:39] all which he hath given me I should lose
[1:17:42] nothing that's the father's will that
[1:17:45] every name every one that he gave to him
[1:17:49] he would lose not one and they would
[1:17:51] come to him and he would not cast them
[1:17:54] out am talking about the grace of
[1:18:00] God but should raise it up again at the
[1:18:03] last day and this is the will of him
[1:18:05] that sent me that everyone that which
[1:18:07] seeth the son and believeth on him may
[1:18:09] have everlasting life and I'll raise him
[1:18:11] up at the last day so the prophet read
[1:18:14] that scripture and says and they cannot
[1:18:15] be
[1:18:16] lost you cannot be
[1:18:19] lost can you say
[1:18:21] Amen cannot be lost now
[1:18:25] you say you know he says well then
[1:18:27] people people thinks that that makes
[1:18:29] people loose that kind of teaching makes
[1:18:32] people loose so people
[1:18:35] think he said but brother you don't
[1:18:38] serve God under a frown under a frown of
[1:18:41] a serpent God is not one of those these
[1:18:44] guys with the black snake whip driving
[1:18:46] you around he's a father he's love God
[1:18:51] is love and the Bible said in St John he
[1:18:54] that loveth is of god you love God you
[1:18:59] love God how many loves God you love God
[1:19:02] well most of us love God and he says see
[1:19:06] I wouldn't be if I went out and got on a
[1:19:08] drunk tonight I never drunk in my life
[1:19:11] but if I went out and got a drunk I
[1:19:13] wouldn't be afraid of getting a weapon
[1:19:15] that isn't the reason I don't go and do
[1:19:17] it so we don't go you know abstain from
[1:19:21] drinking because we're afraid God get
[1:19:22] mad at us
[1:19:26] we don't abstain from the movies and and
[1:19:29] and and the wh house and and all of
[1:19:32] these things and from smoking and
[1:19:34] cussing and swearing and all these
[1:19:36] afraid that God's going to kick us
[1:19:40] out he said that isn't the reason I
[1:19:43] don't go and do that stuff the reason I
[1:19:45] don't do it is because I love
[1:19:49] him amen can you say amen I love him I
[1:19:55] come to church because I love
[1:19:57] him turn my head from them women because
[1:20:00] I love
[1:20:04] him can you say
[1:20:06] amen I love him he loves
[1:20:11] me I love him he loves me now that's
[1:20:14] where we got to come to is understanding
[1:20:17] he loves
[1:20:20] me it's not a works of law it's not
[1:20:24] something that I got to do it's because
[1:20:28] he's already done something for me and I
[1:20:32] love him for
[1:20:36] it can you sayen is that not what the
[1:20:39] gospel is is to show what he's done for
[1:20:45] us to bring our love and our
[1:20:48] appreciation to a greater
[1:20:53] place he's already already done
[1:20:55] something for me and I love him for it
[1:20:57] there you are see so God wants us to
[1:21:00] love him how many believes that God
[1:21:04] wants us to love
[1:21:08] him but love doesn't come by law living
[1:21:12] under
[1:21:13] law remember Israel came out of Egypt
[1:21:16] under
[1:21:17] Grace Grace was there before law prise
[1:21:23] the Lord amen Israel was in Egypt
[1:21:26] without
[1:21:27] law right they didn't have any laws the
[1:21:30] prophet said there was grace and grace
[1:21:34] provided them a
[1:21:35] profit Grace provided them an
[1:21:39] atonement Grace provided a pillar of
[1:21:42] fire not law
[1:21:45] Grace So law came into the piture
[1:21:48] because again Israel wanted something to
[1:21:51] do for themselves yeah yeah
[1:21:55] yeah instead of relying upon the grace
[1:21:58] of God but law is not what brought them
[1:22:02] out of Egypt it was Grace under a
[1:22:05] sacrificial
[1:22:06] lamb Grace provided the lamb to bring
[1:22:10] them
[1:22:11] out God didn't give them a law well if
[1:22:13] you do this and if you do that if you do
[1:22:15] this then I'll bring you out it was
[1:22:17] simply
[1:22:19] Grace providing an
[1:22:22] atonement amen and when they came came
[1:22:24] out there was not a feeble person among
[1:22:28] them now think of that there was you
[1:22:31] know and and uh if you watched the Ten
[1:22:33] Commandments you you you know that now
[1:22:35] they put that there's feeble people and
[1:22:37] all that but the Bible says there wasn't
[1:22:39] a feeble person among them that's right
[1:22:41] Psalms 105:37 he brought them forth also
[1:22:44] with silver and gold and there was not
[1:22:46] one feeble person among their tribes so
[1:22:49] they might have been 150 and they yet
[1:22:51] they were not feeble yeah why
[1:22:56] Grace and I say to you there's there
[1:22:59] there's not I say there's not going to
[1:23:01] be a feeble person amen that coming into
[1:23:03] this bride we ain't barely making this
[1:23:05] thing Grace
[1:23:08] Grace yes sir God's Great Grace is upon
[1:23:12] this people can you say Amen it's the
[1:23:15] grace of God so as the prophet told us
[1:23:17] law is the polian that put you in jail
[1:23:21] Redemption is what pays for your fine
[1:23:24] and get you out law imputes condemnation
[1:23:29] amen so if you've got condemnation then
[1:23:31] you're not serving God right you're not
[1:23:33] understanding the grace of God you're
[1:23:35] you're under this this this this law
[1:23:38] amen and and law can never save a sinner
[1:23:42] can you say Amen it's the grace of God
[1:23:45] that resurrects faith in the heart of
[1:23:48] the believer and therefore righteousness
[1:23:50] is imputed unto him see so if you're if
[1:23:54] you're living under under the law then
[1:23:56] you'll never see the love that God has
[1:23:58] for you under law breath fear Grace
[1:24:04] breeds Faith that's right can you say
[1:24:07] Amen see and and and so you know if if
[1:24:10] you're living under the law you you'll
[1:24:12] never be able to understand the love
[1:24:14] that God has for you therefore you'll
[1:24:16] never be able to love him appropriately
[1:24:19] or accurately or uh uh to love him
[1:24:23] because 1 John 4 19 says we love him
[1:24:26] everybody say I love him because he
[1:24:29] first loved us he's the one that
[1:24:31] initiated the love relationship he first
[1:24:35] loved me and my response is I love him
[1:24:41] back can you say Amen so then brother
[1:24:45] bradam says now if you love him you
[1:24:47] don't have to worry if you love him just
[1:24:50] do what you want to it'll always crying
[1:24:54] to do something for him crying you love
[1:24:57] him day and night if something had
[1:24:59] happened you'd happen to be trapped into
[1:25:01] something the bitter tears would run
[1:25:03] down your cheeks all night you couldn't
[1:25:05] have no rest for the souls of your feet
[1:25:07] till you come back to the art again Ark
[1:25:09] again can you sayen see so it's not a
[1:25:12] have to it's not a burdensome amen it's
[1:25:14] not making you do something it's just
[1:25:17] falling in love with him and when you
[1:25:19] fall in love with him you're not worried
[1:25:21] about being lost you're not worried
[1:25:23] about making mistakes you're not worth
[1:25:25] cuz you don't want to make the mistakes
[1:25:27] and you know you'll make mistakes but
[1:25:29] when you make them mistakes there's you
[1:25:31] just can't stop until you get right back
[1:25:34] again it's just a love can you say amen
[1:25:39] I hope this all right so notice God
[1:25:41] brought Israel out of Egypt to bring
[1:25:44] them into the land of
[1:25:46] promise the promise came by grace and
[1:25:49] not by law amen not Abraham if you do
[1:25:53] this I do this but Abraham I give it to
[1:25:56] you yeah but what what I just gave it to
[1:26:01] you but Israel chose law over Grace
[1:26:06] because they wanted to have something to
[1:26:08] do with
[1:26:09] it think about that did it bring him
[1:26:12] more faith into God
[1:26:14] no did it bring him into a greater love
[1:26:16] relationship with God no did it cause
[1:26:19] them to understand the message of the
[1:26:21] hour more
[1:26:23] no can you say Amen see and so under law
[1:26:27] they never came to know the grace of God
[1:26:31] under law they never came to know the
[1:26:33] supernatural power of God under the law
[1:26:36] they never come to know the intent and
[1:26:39] desire of
[1:26:42] God brother Bram says see it's law that
[1:26:45] brings us to recognize we're wrong but
[1:26:47] it's Grace That Forgives us the law has
[1:26:51] no hope of redemption and to uh uh uh
[1:26:55] and to complete it it can't see so see
[1:26:58] it has no Grace in it law has no Grace
[1:27:01] in
[1:27:02] it because law only points that you are
[1:27:05] a sinner but Grace tells you how to get
[1:27:08] out of it so Israel under law never
[1:27:12] learned how faithful God
[1:27:16] was they never learned the mercy of God
[1:27:19] true so therefore they continued in
[1:27:22] their unbelief because because they were
[1:27:25] under law see it was a fatal mistake the
[1:27:28] prophet said see instead of resting in
[1:27:31] God's provision provided way in resting
[1:27:35] in God providing a prophet God providing
[1:27:38] a a Brazen serpent God providing a
[1:27:41] pillar of fire to lead them God
[1:27:43] providing an
[1:27:47] atonement they continued in their
[1:27:49] unbelief and hardened their hearts
[1:27:56] yeah now in
[1:27:59] Paradox I think in' 61 or
[1:28:03] 62 of course the
[1:28:06] message is
[1:28:08] profound and brother Brad leading up to
[1:28:11] what was
[1:28:12] coming in the opening of the
[1:28:15] word but he tells us he's talking about
[1:28:17] law and Grace and he said Joshua
[1:28:20] represented Grace and Moses represented
[1:28:23] the law
[1:28:25] Grace could not exist at the same time
[1:28:28] law existed Joshua then could not come
[1:28:32] into His full ministry while Moses was
[1:28:35] still there Joshua was there but he
[1:28:38] couldn't come into his ministry because
[1:28:40] of Moses the
[1:28:43] law ain't that right so therefore Moses
[1:28:47] had to go off the scene so that Joshua
[1:28:50] could come into his ministry why law
[1:28:53] could not take the people over into the
[1:28:57] promise and law cannot take us over into
[1:29:01] the land of the book open book where all
[1:29:05] the promises become a
[1:29:08] reality can you say Amen it will not
[1:29:11] take you to your
[1:29:14] promise law will not take you to your
[1:29:17] healing law will not take you to your
[1:29:19] adoption law will not take you to
[1:29:21] Salvation law will not take you to the
[1:29:23] authority and manifestation of
[1:29:27] sunship only Grace the ministry of Grace
[1:29:31] could take them over into the land of
[1:29:34] inheritance and positionally plac them
[1:29:37] the land was already given to them by
[1:29:43] Grace amen can you sayen so the
[1:29:47] difference Moses or Joshua's Ministry
[1:29:51] wasn't dealing with the People based on
[1:29:53] what they did didn't
[1:29:55] do his ministry dealt with the People by
[1:29:59] what God had promised
[1:30:01] them Lord his ministry dealt with their
[1:30:07] predestination can you say Amen brother
[1:30:10] brandham said the promised land
[1:30:11] represented a day of
[1:30:15] Grace no law a day of
[1:30:19] Grace I know you might be a scumbag I
[1:30:22] know you might be a misfit I know you
[1:30:24] might be a weakling I know all these but
[1:30:27] I'm reminding you of God's
[1:30:33] promise can you say
[1:30:35] Amen not pointing to what you've done
[1:30:38] amen not pointing to what you
[1:30:42] are not pointing to how you
[1:30:45] feel but pointing to what God has
[1:30:48] already
[1:30:51] done God gave them this land and this
[1:30:54] inheritance was predestinated to them
[1:30:57] now we know that the message of the hour
[1:31:00] is what the message of Grace amen
[1:31:04] exactly go listen to the message of
[1:31:07] Grace Amen brother Brandon preached on
[1:31:09] it the message of
[1:31:11] Grace amen it's a message of Grace not a
[1:31:14] message of Law and man have have
[1:31:17] ministers tried to to to make it about
[1:31:20] law make this message about law of dos
[1:31:23] and don'ts yes the apostolics and and a
[1:31:26] lot of them make this Bible of of law
[1:31:29] amen but we found out by the message of
[1:31:32] Grace that it's actually a book of love
[1:31:35] it's a love letter to God writing a love
[1:31:38] letter to his bride can you say Amen see
[1:31:42] so we're not living in a time of law
[1:31:45] this is not a time of law don't come
[1:31:47] under a a law it's a day of Grace God
[1:31:51] thought of you before the foundation of
[1:31:54] world you were a seed Gene of God in
[1:31:58] God's mind you are an attribute of his
[1:32:01] thinking ain't that right that's what
[1:32:02] the message of Grace has been telling us
[1:32:05] you're an attribute of his thinking yeah
[1:32:07] but you don't understand how I feel that
[1:32:08] doesn't matter you are an attribute of
[1:32:12] what God thought of you in the beginning
[1:32:14] can you say Amen you are an eternal Gene
[1:32:21] seed yes sir and it's thinking then you
[1:32:24] were righteous you were
[1:32:26] holy you were
[1:32:28] perfect in his thinking you wasn't a
[1:32:31] sinner in his thinking you were a son
[1:32:34] Amen in his thinking that's right there
[1:32:37] you
[1:32:38] go
[1:32:40] amen now we were trapped into sin at the
[1:32:43] beginning but the Bible says Christ was
[1:32:46] manifested to destroy the works of the
[1:32:48] devil sir now brother brandham in the
[1:32:51] mystery of Christ revealed said
[1:32:52] justified in his sight why are we
[1:32:54] Justified we are his victory can you say
[1:32:57] that with me I am his victory well why
[1:33:00] are you his victory because I did have
[1:33:02] nothing to do with it he's the one that
[1:33:04] done it I'm his victory all of that work
[1:33:08] was to bring me forth and here I
[1:33:12] am not as a sinner not as a as a son of
[1:33:15] Duran Martin but I'm here as a Son of
[1:33:19] God
[1:33:22] Amen the church is his victory we come
[1:33:24] forth in this last day with his glorious
[1:33:27] gospel showing his victory he died for
[1:33:30] this purpose and we are proof of his
[1:33:32] victory when we see him coming down and
[1:33:34] living among the church that's his
[1:33:36] victory shows that he couldn't keep him
[1:33:39] Satan couldn't keep him in the grave
[1:33:41] neither can they keep us ain't that
[1:33:43] right that we're bound right see we're
[1:33:47] already potentially arise because we've
[1:33:50] raised from the dead unbelief in his
[1:33:52] word from denominational Creeds to an
[1:33:55] eternal word of the Eternal God which is
[1:33:57] him himself working through US
[1:34:00] manifesting himself that he is the same
[1:34:03] yesterday today and
[1:34:04] forever so Christ was God's provided
[1:34:09] sacrifice that would finish the plan
[1:34:12] amen aren't you glad for that Amen to
[1:34:15] God it wouldn't have mattered if anyone
[1:34:18] else said it was finished but when he
[1:34:19] said it is finished it was finished
[1:34:24] God couldn't have come up produced a
[1:34:26] better sacrifice than Christ amen if he
[1:34:29] could have produced it he would have
[1:34:31] done it that Christ was none other than
[1:34:33] himself in human
[1:34:36] flesh and it was at that moment when
[1:34:39] Christ said it is finished that Satan's
[1:34:41] power was
[1:34:42] broken and now he's nothing but a bluff
[1:34:45] that's right ain't that right Amen
[1:34:48] brother brandom said in the old Covenant
[1:34:50] what if a little mule would be born out
[1:34:52] in some pastor some night he said I
[1:34:55] don't know whether you ever farmed any
[1:34:57] or not but this mule was born a flopped
[1:35:01] ear that's a horrible mule to begin with
[1:35:05] he's knock kneed and crosseyed and his
[1:35:07] tail sticks right straight up is what a
[1:35:10] horrible looking mule now if he could
[1:35:12] look around to his mommy Mammy he'd say
[1:35:15] you know what as soon as the Master of
[1:35:17] the House comes out he's going to knock
[1:35:18] me in the head I'm not even worth uh the
[1:35:22] food I eat I'm no good but if his M
[1:35:26] Mammy was really instructed she'd say
[1:35:28] but wait a minute son just a minute I'm
[1:35:30] going to tell you something you don't
[1:35:32] know that's what I want to tell you see
[1:35:35] you don't know who you are son see you
[1:35:39] you see you're born under a Birthright
[1:35:42] and when the master of the house I don't
[1:35:43] care what you look like when the Master
[1:35:45] of the House comes out uh uh to see he's
[1:35:49] got a new mule born the thing then the
[1:35:52] thing he has got has to do is go get a
[1:35:55] lamb without a blemish and take that
[1:35:58] perfect lamb and that perfect lamb dies
[1:36:01] so that you can live then the little
[1:36:03] mule kicked up his can kick up his heels
[1:36:06] and have a big time can you say Amen see
[1:36:09] he had a mamy that knew he had a mamy
[1:36:12] that knew the book and so did we have a
[1:36:15] prophet to know the
[1:36:17] book and to tell us something that we
[1:36:20] didn't
[1:36:21] know ain't that right he said well
[1:36:24] that's the way it is with us we're
[1:36:25] imperfect no good born in sin shape in
[1:36:28] iniquity come into the world speaking
[1:36:30] lies we're no good to begin with but God
[1:36:32] don't look at
[1:36:35] you amen he looks at the sacrifice he
[1:36:40] looks at the lamb he doesn't see you
[1:36:42] because he sees Christ Christ died for
[1:36:45] you how many believes Christ died for
[1:36:46] you Christ died for you that's that's
[1:36:49] not just something a cliche of words
[1:36:52] that is a true Revelation he died for me
[1:36:56] died for you amen that's right see now
[1:37:01] he says now if you can find some Fault
[1:37:03] With Jesus then your healing might not
[1:37:05] be right but if you don't find no fault
[1:37:07] with him then it's perfect your healing
[1:37:10] is perfect see sure God called you by
[1:37:13] his grace not that not that you would
[1:37:17] but if God would see the scripture said
[1:37:19] he was the lamb slain from the
[1:37:21] foundation of the world that was God
[1:37:23] God's word and when God speaks it's as
[1:37:26] good as finished right then another
[1:37:29] place that little mule could kick up
[1:37:31] them little heels and knock them little
[1:37:33] uh uh knock knees together and nicker
[1:37:36] and go all over the field because he's
[1:37:39] free he don't have to die a lamb died
[1:37:42] for him he's perfectly
[1:37:45] safe oh is that the way you feel tonight
[1:37:48] you're perfectly safe don't have to fear
[1:37:52] about dying the lamb died for him you
[1:37:55] don't have to fear about what you are
[1:37:58] it's what he was he was the one who died
[1:38:00] for you then you find fault in him then
[1:38:03] I'll tell you why you can't be healed
[1:38:06] see but when you find no fault in your
[1:38:09] sacrifice God's accepted that sacrifice
[1:38:13] and when he accept the sacrifice he
[1:38:15] accepts your confession in that
[1:38:17] sacrifice and you become part of it he
[1:38:21] said I feel religious now cuz I know I
[1:38:23] didn't have a chance to begin with but I
[1:38:26] didn't look at myself I looked at the
[1:38:28] sacrifice that was offered for me it was
[1:38:31] perfect and God already accepted it so
[1:38:35] then I'm all right now when I see what
[1:38:38] he did what he is it isn't me it's him
[1:38:41] it isn't you it's him can you say Amen
[1:38:45] I'm not the perfect one he's the perfect
[1:38:49] one I find no fault in him the Lord can
[1:38:53] you say
[1:38:54] Amen so we're entering into the land of
[1:38:58] promise this is the time the message of
[1:39:02] Grace and brother Bram says now you
[1:39:05] don't come by laws and rituals and
[1:39:07] orders you come by predestination that's
[1:39:11] right amen can you say ma'am you don't
[1:39:15] worship because it's a ritual thing it's
[1:39:19] something that's in you you're coming by
[1:39:22] predestination
[1:39:24] you're you're not doing these things
[1:39:25] because someone's forcing you and
[1:39:27] someone's compelling you and someone's
[1:39:29] making you do it and and they're working
[1:39:31] the music up and they're getting
[1:39:32] everything all geared up no you're
[1:39:34] coming by
[1:39:38] predestination another place he says
[1:39:40] we're end ending the seventh Church age
[1:39:43] the church age the Pentecostal age do
[1:39:45] you see it we're entering that Holy
[1:39:48] convocation we're entering into that
[1:39:50] real genuine eternity where the church
[1:39:53] is called not to some station or some
[1:39:56] denomination but into eternity with
[1:39:59] their Eternal King we don't have it at
[1:40:02] all no such things as days and things
[1:40:06] and times you passed into eternity where
[1:40:09] you come from you was there to begin
[1:40:13] with another place he says you enter
[1:40:16] into life not keeping a day or a shadow
[1:40:21] Paul said over there in Hebrews the 4th
[1:40:23] chapter
[1:40:23] you keep days and shadows and things
[1:40:25] like that I'm scared of your experience
[1:40:27] we don't pass into certain days and
[1:40:30] orders you passed from Death under life
[1:40:33] not days and times you passed into
[1:40:37] eternity it was
[1:40:40] finished can you say Amen it's
[1:40:47] finished so then everything a Christian
[1:40:50] has
[1:40:53] brother Bram said it's his faith resting
[1:40:55] in the finished works of
[1:40:58] Calvary everything was finished and
[1:41:02] completed and now we just rest our faith
[1:41:06] in a finished
[1:41:07] work because we not find no fault in him
[1:41:11] we find no fault in his sacrifice we
[1:41:15] find no fault in his blood I find no
[1:41:18] fault in his
[1:41:20] life I find no fault in the virgin birth
[1:41:24] yeah I find no fault in what he had to
[1:41:26] say Amen to the Pharisees and the saddu
[1:41:29] I find no fault in him
[1:41:33] amen can you say Amen see therefore I'm
[1:41:37] not looking at him blaming him I'm not
[1:41:40] looking at the word finding fault for he
[1:41:42] is the word I'm resting in it my faith
[1:41:47] is resting in a finished product a
[1:41:50] finished work it's finished
[1:41:53] that's right thank
[1:41:55] [Music]
[1:41:57] Lord everything was finished and
[1:41:59] completed and we rest our faith in the
[1:42:01] finished work now notice what he says
[1:42:03] and any gift that says different
[1:42:07] anything different from that don't
[1:42:09] believe it it's not of
[1:42:12] God hello cuz there's where the price
[1:42:16] was paid there's where everything was
[1:42:19] finished right there amen sir so we're
[1:42:24] looking at our
[1:42:25] sacrifice now notice 1 John 2 And1 my
[1:42:29] little children these things write I
[1:42:30] unto you that you sin
[1:42:32] not and if any man sin everybody say it
[1:42:35] if any man sin we have an advocate with
[1:42:38] the father Christ Jesus the
[1:42:41] righteous John is speaking to Sinners or
[1:42:45] to Christians not
[1:42:46] Sinners right my children I write these
[1:42:49] things unto you ain't that right see
[1:42:53] co-workers in the
[1:42:55] gospel brother BR says how we could go
[1:42:58] into details with that and break that
[1:43:01] down of how that it makes the Holy Ghost
[1:43:04] makes
[1:43:05] intercession for our
[1:43:07] ignorance we have an intercessor an
[1:43:09] advoc an uh uh an
[1:43:12] advocator sometimes he said we got the
[1:43:14] Holy Ghost we stag ignorantly stagger
[1:43:17] into something the holy spirit is there
[1:43:19] to make advocate for us he's our
[1:43:22] advocator amen he's our attorney he
[1:43:24] stands there and pleads for
[1:43:28] us can you say Amen we don't plead for
[1:43:32] ourselves because the Holy Ghost in US
[1:43:35] pleads for us have you ever just done
[1:43:38] something wrong and there's just a
[1:43:39] burden in your soul in your Agony oh God
[1:43:42] forgive me oh God I'm sorry oh there's
[1:43:45] something there there's a the holy
[1:43:48] spirit in there making
[1:43:51] intercession amen
[1:43:54] hello amen I believe it and the Holy
[1:43:58] Spirit giving utterance sometimes with
[1:44:00] words you can understand and he makes
[1:44:02] intercessions for us that's what the
[1:44:04] Holy Ghost is when I walk into anything
[1:44:07] I walk like a little kid you walk like a
[1:44:09] little fella see we're walking in a dark
[1:44:12] world full of enemies full of sin full
[1:44:14] of traps full of everything and you say
[1:44:16] oh I'm afraid I'm afraid to take a
[1:44:18] Christian Life I'm afraid to do this I'm
[1:44:19] afraid I'll do this don't be afraid
[1:44:23] we have an
[1:44:27] advocate he doesn't have to come and die
[1:44:29] for you again it was
[1:44:34] finished oh he stands by us he's in us
[1:44:38] he makes intercession for us the Holy
[1:44:40] Spirit constantly constantly making an
[1:44:43] advocate for us all the time can you say
[1:44:46] Amen so our sins doesn't make us sinners
[1:44:48] all over
[1:44:51] again are you with me now you get the
[1:44:54] Holy Ghost you're sealed till the day of
[1:44:56] your Redemption and you make a mistake
[1:44:58] that don't make you a sinner
[1:45:00] again Christ doesn't have to come over
[1:45:03] and die for you again it was
[1:45:05] finished the ticket was already paid for
[1:45:08] you to make it all the way to the other
[1:45:11] side sir that's right brother Brian says
[1:45:15] now you will do wrome but you won't do
[1:45:16] it willfully you don't do it willfully
[1:45:19] you're trapped and anything you're
[1:45:20] trapped into two or do something that
[1:45:22] you don't mean to it's not sin yet for
[1:45:25] you'll repent the minute you see that
[1:45:27] you're wrong you'll turn quickly and say
[1:45:29] I didn't see that I didn't mean you'll
[1:45:31] say that all through life a man don't
[1:45:33] want to be that's the reason we are so
[1:45:35] stupid and so in dark down here on the
[1:45:38] earth that's there's a blood atonement
[1:45:41] for us all the time to keep us
[1:45:48] covered there's nothing for you to do
[1:45:53] but simply
[1:45:56] believe
[1:46:00] nothing did you know that there's
[1:46:02] nothing else for Jesus to
[1:46:06] do when he said it was finished his work
[1:46:10] was
[1:46:11] done the Bible says he went he is
[1:46:13] sitting at the throne at the right side
[1:46:15] of the
[1:46:17] father brother brand says when a man
[1:46:19] sits down that means he's finished
[1:46:25] and he sat down at the right hand of the
[1:46:27] father to show that it is
[1:46:31] finished amen can you say Amen am if
[1:46:35] Jesus was standing here in a suit and
[1:46:38] tie you came and you needed healing oh
[1:46:42] and you asked him to heal
[1:46:44] you you know what he'd say
[1:46:50] no I can't
[1:46:53] right I've already done
[1:46:56] it it's
[1:46:58] finished so you can't get him to do
[1:47:00] something he's already done he's not
[1:47:02] here to
[1:47:05] Redo can you say Amen so then he cannot
[1:47:09] save you cannot heal you he's I've
[1:47:11] already did that so he says if you was a
[1:47:13] sinner and you'd come tonight you
[1:47:15] couldn't be saved
[1:47:17] tonight I'm going to say that again
[1:47:19] that's pretty powerful isn't it if you
[1:47:21] was a sinner you came tonight you
[1:47:23] couldn't be saved tonight you would have
[1:47:26] to accept your salvation that was paid
[1:47:29] for you 1900 years ago Jesus saved you
[1:47:33] when he died and said it's
[1:47:41] finished that's when he saved you that's
[1:47:44] when he healed you that's when he
[1:47:47] delivered you hello church that's when
[1:47:51] he made a way for you to overc
[1:47:54] come that's when he made a a way for you
[1:47:57] to come to a millennium and a Rapture
[1:47:59] and be part of that new Heaven and Earth
[1:48:03] right right that's when he saved you but
[1:48:07] you have to accept it when he knocks at
[1:48:10] your
[1:48:11] heart then you accept your salvation you
[1:48:14] accept Jesus as your personal savior he
[1:48:17] was wounded for your transgression with
[1:48:20] his stripes you was healed you have to
[1:48:23] accept him as your healer on the same
[1:48:26] basis you accept him as your
[1:48:30] savior amen so quit looking forward to
[1:48:33] what he's going to do he's already done
[1:48:36] it so therefore our faith is based upon
[1:48:40] a finished work it's done it's
[1:48:45] finished now go your way rejoicing don't
[1:48:49] bring let the devil bring you into fear
[1:48:52] don't let the never bring you under
[1:48:53] condemnation you're under
[1:48:56] grace it all was done by
[1:48:59] grace for you can you say
[1:49:02] Amen oh isn't he
[1:49:05] wonderful so we believe you must accept
[1:49:08] that finished work of Calvary now
[1:49:10] brother Bram said if you don't accept it
[1:49:12] then the gospel isn't going to do you
[1:49:13] any
[1:49:14] good remember the story of The Crow you
[1:49:18] know the crows kept flying over and the
[1:49:20] farmer didn't like it so he finally
[1:49:22] trapped one of them and caught him and
[1:49:25] he tied him up put a string to his
[1:49:27] little foot and to a pole and and the
[1:49:31] crow could go a little ways but he'd
[1:49:33] come to that end of the rope and he'd
[1:49:35] fall back right and so this happened day
[1:49:38] after day when he'd see all the crows
[1:49:40] coming over he he'd go and and and try
[1:49:43] to join them and fall back and next day
[1:49:47] triy to join him fall back and finally
[1:49:50] got to know his boundary
[1:49:54] got hurt too many times of trying got
[1:49:57] discouraged from
[1:49:59] trying always a failure by
[1:50:02] trying so he just gave up he had run out
[1:50:05] there but he knew his his boundary
[1:50:09] now one guy just coming along and he saw
[1:50:12] that little bird and he felt sorry for
[1:50:13] that little guy so he got his little
[1:50:16] pocket knife and he he was able to catch
[1:50:18] that bird and he loosened that rope let
[1:50:21] him down and the bird just sat there and
[1:50:24] he went ahead and left and the crows
[1:50:27] crows coming over you know and oh that
[1:50:31] old crow he looked at him and he he went
[1:50:35] but he'd only go to his only certain
[1:50:37] spot only and yet he didn't know he was
[1:50:40] free because in his mind he had come to
[1:50:43] so used to habits and I'm telling you
[1:50:46] right now don't get used to failure so
[1:50:48] used to failure that you give up trying
[1:50:51] don't get so used to your habits that
[1:50:52] you lose sight of Victory can you say
[1:50:55] Amen to where the devil can convince you
[1:50:58] you'll never be able to fly like that
[1:50:59] you'll never be able to be like that I'm
[1:51:02] telling you it's finished it's over can
[1:51:06] you say Amen keep flying keep trying
[1:51:10] keep
[1:51:11] believing brother Bram said if you're
[1:51:13] sick I wished I could heal you but no
[1:51:15] man can do that it's already done
[1:51:18] healing lies in
[1:51:21] you who what I've Been Waiting for God
[1:51:24] to do it healing lies in
[1:51:28] you it's your faith in the finished work
[1:51:31] that God did on Calvary with Jesus
[1:51:34] Christ outside of that there is no
[1:51:37] healing outside of that there is no
[1:51:40] salvation no church no denomination no
[1:51:42] ritual nothing packs
[1:51:45] salvation Jesus Christ he was wounded
[1:51:48] for our transgression with his stops we
[1:51:51] were
[1:51:53] healed he was wounded for our
[1:51:55] transgressions transgressions he says
[1:51:58] excuse me by his stripes we were all in
[1:52:02] past tense we were healed our sins were
[1:52:05] forgiven back then can you say Amen we
[1:52:09] were delivered back then our way was
[1:52:13] Secure back
[1:52:15] then sir oh my don't sit around say oh
[1:52:19] I'm just waiting on God to do something
[1:52:20] no it's in your hands it's in your hands
[1:52:24] can you say Amen but here's the thing
[1:52:26] about it the faith that the believer has
[1:52:28] is God's Own Faith yes sir it's the
[1:52:31] faith of God you see when he sent his
[1:52:33] Spirit back into you it was to Bear
[1:52:35] witness with your spirit that you are
[1:52:37] the Son and Daughter of God he comes in
[1:52:41] you the same God that stood on the
[1:52:43] invisible platform in the beginning and
[1:52:46] said let there be and there was he did
[1:52:49] that by faith he spoke it by faith that
[1:52:52] same God now is in you believeth his own
[1:52:56] word taking your mouth and speaking his
[1:52:59] words of life it's already done I am
[1:53:02] healed I am saved I am going to make it
[1:53:05] why it's God believing his own word in
[1:53:09] you it's not God in heaven believing it
[1:53:12] deity is not in heaven deity is in
[1:53:16] you and he believes it is
[1:53:20] finished he believes
[1:53:23] can you say amen God in you looking at
[1:53:25] the sacrifice and saying it's it's
[1:53:28] perfect it's right it's over
[1:53:31] withall
[1:53:33] amen believing in the finished work if
[1:53:37] the musicians will
[1:53:39] come and any Minister that has God in
[1:53:42] him will point the people to the
[1:53:43] finished work of Calvary for that's the
[1:53:46] job of every Minister that's the job of
[1:53:49] every parent that's the job of everyone
[1:53:53] that we testify to that does the
[1:53:56] testifying is pointing them the people
[1:53:59] to a finished work can you say Amen so
[1:54:03] many ministers have tried to make a name
[1:54:05] for themselves or they have pointed the
[1:54:07] people to something that isn't the real
[1:54:09] gospel amen they they they they you know
[1:54:13] they brother Bram you hear Brother Bram
[1:54:14] talking about they've had old running
[1:54:16] out of their hands and and blood and and
[1:54:19] and all of these things I I like what
[1:54:21] brother Bram said he said if God wanted
[1:54:23] you to pour out oil he had made you a
[1:54:26] Texas oil well or an olive tree or
[1:54:28] something but he made you a human being
[1:54:30] to preach the gospel and to bring the
[1:54:32] message to the people of the Salvation
[1:54:34] of the finished work of Jesus Christ it
[1:54:37] isn't to glorify us it isn't to build
[1:54:39] our own kingdom it isn't to establish
[1:54:41] our name in this life it is to point the
[1:54:44] people's Faith to a finished work of
[1:54:46] Calvary and to let them know it is
[1:54:48] finished it's done you don't have to
[1:54:51] worry you don't have to fear here you
[1:54:52] don't have to beg just accept what God
[1:54:56] has already done for
[1:54:59] you brother Braham says I believe that
[1:55:02] all the healing that was ever done or
[1:55:04] would be done was completed at
[1:55:07] Calvary he was wounded for our
[1:55:09] transgression with his stripes we were
[1:55:12] past tense already healed at Calvary now
[1:55:14] the only thing that I can do or any
[1:55:16] other minister could do would be to
[1:55:18] preach the word or do something in the
[1:55:20] way that would cause you to have faith
[1:55:22] in the finished works of the Lord Jesus
[1:55:24] at Calvary that your faith has already
[1:55:27] purchased can you say amen I I know i'
[1:55:31] I've got to go but here he says in
[1:55:33] another place I find out that one of the
[1:55:35] greatest hindrances that the church has
[1:55:37] got today is that they're scared to
[1:55:39] death what are you scared about that's
[1:55:42] what I'm wondering if you'll just only
[1:55:45] realize of who you are you don't know
[1:55:47] who you are you don't know who that is
[1:55:50] sitting next to you oh you say yeah
[1:55:52] that's my neighbor I know him all right
[1:55:54] but he's the son of God adopted by Jesus
[1:55:57] Christ into the family that's a daughter
[1:55:59] of God sitting next to you and who are
[1:56:02] you see if you're a Christian believer
[1:56:04] you're a son and daughter of God what
[1:56:06] are you scared about there's no need of
[1:56:09] being
[1:56:10] scared as long as the devil can keep you
[1:56:12] scared that's all he wants to do he's
[1:56:16] got you right
[1:56:17] then may God break that spirit of fear
[1:56:21] amen
[1:56:23] can you say
[1:56:26] amen I can't hear
