[42:08] faithful to every human being absolutely
[42:10] in the face of the Earth God is faithful
[42:14] a lot of people don't realize that God

[42:42] brother Wayne and brother Andrew brother
[42:44] Ronnie just done an outstanding job in
[42:47] uh just exalting Christ by preaching the
[42:51] message and I think that's the only way
[42:53] you can exalt Christ is just declare the
[42:56] message of the hour and uh what he's
[42:59] brought through us to us in this age and
[43:03] heard you all had a good service here uh
[43:06] Sunday and the Lord just uh moved in
[43:10] Supernatural way and so we're we're
[43:12] thankful for that just her testimonies
[43:15] of God healing and so we we thank the
[43:19] Lord for that and uh it's really good to
[43:22] have the Shamo family sham family
[43:24] brother Dell and his family and I
[43:28] um uh I guess they're more acquainted
[43:31] with my older brother Wendell and uh I
[43:34] guess for a few years now and uh so we
[43:37] have uh seen them at different meetings
[43:39] and things and I didn't know you had a
[43:41] preacher among you and uh until here
[43:44] recently and uh heard brother Ben was
[43:47] preaching then I heard that you got
[43:49] other sons that are preaching the
[43:51] gospels so uh we're thankful for that
[43:54] God is raising up a Young Generation to
[43:57] declare the message of the hour and I
[44:00] believe that as long as God's got a
[44:02] bride on the earth and God's got a
[44:04] Ministry Amen to proclaim the message of
[44:08] the hour and uh it's uh good to have
[44:11] brother Andrew and uh Sister Mariah here

[46:50] uh desire of every
[46:54] believer it's Jesus that we really want
[46:56] to see amen that's why we've gathered
[46:58] ourselves together today I believe is
[47:00] it's him that we want to see we didn't
[47:02] gather together to see any man but we
[47:04] gathered together to see Jesus Christ so
[47:07] we just want to thank the musicians and
[47:10] the singing and the specials they were
[47:11] really good and in fact I'm going to
[47:15] take my keys out of my pocket apparently
[47:17] the car was going
[47:18] off downstairs and you know I I thought
[47:22] it was somebody else you know
[47:24] everybody's asking well whose horns
[47:26] going off and I kept pitchforking the
[47:28] gospel to somebody else and I well found
[47:30] out it was me so if you would we'll just
[47:33] try to enter in and uh read our
[47:36] scripture here real quick from Genesis 1
[47:38] and one familiar scripture here and we
[47:42] just want to thank brother Shawn and the
[47:43] church here for being so gracious and
[47:45] bearing with us and giving us an
[47:47] opportunity to preach to you we've got
[47:49] some mighty preachers in your midst
[47:51] tonight and feel like I'm one of the
[47:53] smallest ones here so you'll just have
[47:56] to bear with with us and as long as the
[47:58] Lord shows up I think we'll be all right
[48:00] amen so if you will Genesis 1 and verse
[48:04] one familiar scripture here and it says
[48:06] and in the beginning God created the
[48:08] Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was
[48:10] without form and void and darkness was
[48:13] upon the face of the deep and the spirit
[48:15] of God moved upon the face of the waters
[48:17] and said and God said let there be light
[48:20] and there was light and God saw the
[48:22] light that it was good and he divided
[48:23] the light from the darkness let's bow
[48:26] our heads
[48:28] dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're
[48:29] just coming before you yet once more
[48:32] Lord just asking for another move of God
[48:34] this
[48:35] evening Lord your scripture says that if
[48:37] there's two or three that are gathered
[48:39] together in your name that you will be
[48:40] in their midst and Lord there's more
[48:43] than two or three gathered here tonight
[48:45] Lord there's many needs amongst your
[48:47] Believers tonight and we just ask that
[48:48] you would just take complete control of
[48:50] this service Lord we believe you're the
[48:52] God Almighty Lord that you're in control
[48:54] of everything so Lord we just give you
[48:56] this service Lord I give you my uh body
[48:59] Lord we just ask that you would use it
[49:01] Lord that you would anoint also the
[49:03] hearers that they might be able to
[49:04] receive your word we ask in the name of
[49:06] Jesus Christ amen amen you may be
[49:11] seated again we just want to say how
[49:13] honored we are to be here with you
[49:15] tonight and we just preaching some
[49:18] meetings in July with our brother Andrew
[49:20] and boy he's been a good friend of ours
[49:22] and I've been listening to him and
[49:24] before I was preaching we were listening
[49:25] to him and What a Mighty preacher he is
[49:28] and brother Sean we've known the the
[49:29] Martin family for years and years and
[49:31] we're just very privileged to be here
[49:33] and I don't think my family really needs
[49:35] an introduction I think most of you all
[49:37] know them uh but certainly privileged to
[49:40] be here but if we could from those
[49:42] scriptures we'd like to take a thought
[49:43] on the power of the spoken
[49:46] word the power of a spoken word and what
[49:50] we see in this scripture here is the
[49:52] very first thing that God does when he
[49:55] begins to create things
[49:57] he says in verse three he says let there
[50:00] be light and there was light and I want
[50:03] you to notice something that when God
[50:05] said let there be light there was a
[50:07] power that went forth from God and it
[50:11] became a word brother brandom said that
[50:13] a word is a thought expressed so there
[50:15] was something inside of God that he
[50:18] wanted to express and the only way that
[50:21] God could express the thought that he
[50:23] had in his mind was to Make It Word and
[50:26] when he spoke the very word light light
[50:29] came into manifestation that word light
[50:32] whizzed through all of space it went
[50:34] through all of time it went through all
[50:36] of those things and it picked up Little
[50:38] atoms of light and it created light and
[50:41] that very first word that God uses in
[50:43] the scripture he says let there be light
[50:45] and there was light that one word light
[50:48] has confounded scientists throughout all
[50:51] of history light is something that that
[50:53] that that scientists cannot understand
[50:56] yet today they can't wrap their mind
[50:58] around it one word of God one one
[51:00] thought of God's that has become word
[51:04] created the most uh incredible Paradox
[51:06] if we could explain it in that way but
[51:10] light is something that you cannot see
[51:13] light is something that you can see the
[51:15] results of but you cannot actually see
[51:19] light light travels from one place to
[51:20] another place and it illuminates an
[51:23] object or a place so you can see it you
[51:25] have a receptor so you can uh interact
[51:28] with those things but you can't actually
[51:30] see the light and so many people come to
[51:32] us today and say oh well you can't see
[51:35] God you just got to look around and you
[51:37] can see God God is there he's been there
[51:39] the whole time but the scripture says
[51:41] that God is light we believe that this
[51:45] evening that God is light science can't
[51:49] understand it but we have the
[51:50] Revelation amen one
[51:53] word created the fund fundamental basis
[51:57] for life which is light light is the
[52:01] fundamental basis of light without light
[52:04] life could not exist the trees could not
[52:07] grow your tomato plants would not be
[52:09] able to ripen we would not be able to
[52:11] see all life would be impossible without
[52:15] light amen we believe that in the
[52:17] beginning God created the heavens and
[52:19] the Earth he said let there be light
[52:22] another instance When God Says forth a
[52:24] word is Matthew 14 and Matthew 14: 24-33
[52:29] says but the ship was now in the midst
[52:31] of a a sea tossed with waves for the
[52:34] wind was contrary and in the Fourth
[52:37] Watch of the night Jesus said unto them
[52:39] walking on the
[52:41] sea went unto them walking on the sea
[52:44] and when the disciples saw him walking
[52:45] on the sea they were troubled saying it
[52:48] is a spirit and they cried out for
[52:51] fear but straight way Jesus spake unto
[52:53] them saying be of good cheer it is I be
[52:56] not afraid and Peter answered unto him
[52:58] Lord if it be thou bid me come unto the
[53:03] W unto you on the water and he said come
[53:06] now I want you to notice that it only
[53:08] took one word from
[53:11] Jesus it only took one word from Jesus a
[53:16] word to a Believer and there was
[53:19] something inside of Peter calling out
[53:20] for more of Jesus he said Jesus if that
[53:23] is you then bid me to come there was a
[53:26] deep calling to the deep inside of Peter
[53:28] and he said Lord if that is you then
[53:30] tell me to come Lord if this is you if
[53:33] this is your word then give me a
[53:36] revelation and when Jesus says that one
[53:39] word it only took one word from the lips
[53:41] of Jesus Christ and he said come it
[53:44] defied all of
[53:46] nature you see cuz Peter stepped out of
[53:49] that boat he stepped out of his comfort
[53:51] zone onto the onto the water am and
[53:54] Peter didn't realize this but when he
[53:56] was taking God at his at his word he was
[53:59] stepping out of the boat he was stepping
[54:01] out of the the laws of nature and into
[54:04] the
[54:05] supernatural he was working inside the
[54:08] supernatural working off of one word of
[54:12] Jesus Christ Hallelujah if we could do
[54:14] that tonight if we could only realize
[54:16] that we have a full manifested word of
[54:19] Jesus Christ here tonight then we can
[54:21] step out of our comfort zones and step
[54:24] onto faith and walk in the way of the
[54:27] supernatural one word of Jesus Christ
[54:30] and we've got a whole Bible full of
[54:31] promises to walk on but what is a word a
[54:34] word is a thought expressed you see a
[54:37] word is also a noun or a verb it can be
[54:41] a noun a person place or thing or it can
[54:43] be a verb which is an action and I want
[54:45] to kind of hone in on this a little bit
[54:48] tonight that we want this word of God
[54:51] it's a living word which a living word
[54:55] means a manifested word
[54:57] a living word means it's not a dead word
[55:00] you see so many people try to keep the
[55:02] word of God as a person place or thing
[55:05] they say this is the scriptures it's a
[55:07] Bible it's a it's it's a thing Jesus
[55:09] Christ is a person and it's all third
[55:11] party but you see we believe a
[55:13] manifested word today because God has
[55:16] come down in this last stage to reveal
[55:18] to us that he doesn't live up in heaven
[55:21] somewhere we don't worship a god that's
[55:23] way up somewhere out you know
[55:25] Untouchable but we worship a god that is
[55:28] living here with us even in us even this
[55:32] evening he is the same yesterday today
[55:34] and forever we can't put God's word on
[55:36] the shelf and call it just a noun but it
[55:38] must be a verb in our
[55:40] lives but I want you to realize
[55:42] something that words are just a Channel
[55:45] all right you see words are
[55:48] great but words on a page can do us no
[55:51] good it's when that thought is made
[55:54] manifest
[55:56] so God has a thought and then he has a
[55:59] word and then he has a manifestation you
[56:01] see so we know that the thought must be
[56:04] made manifest when we see the
[56:07] word amen right are you with me so far
[56:11] amen so when God said let there be light
[56:14] there was the word he had a thought it
[56:15] was always in him the thought of light
[56:17] was always in him but it didn't come to
[56:20] manifestation until after the word was
[56:22] expressed the word must be expressed the
[56:25] word word must be spoken before the
[56:31] manifestation but as soon as the word
[56:33] was spoken let there be light then that
[56:35] molecule of light could come to what it
[56:37] was supposed to
[56:40] be I want to show you how there are
[56:42] power in words words are very powerful
[56:45] things now this is a subject that I I
[56:47] didn't preach on for a long time because
[56:49] everybody's like oh you got to be
[56:50] careful what you say you know words are
[56:53] powerful I that's boring stuff you know
[56:55] I didn't want want to preach on it for a
[56:57] long time until God revealed to
[57:00] me the actual power that words carry and
[57:04] how it applied to me you see because
[57:08] it's so easy to put this out on somebody
[57:11] else to say this word is for somebody
[57:13] else that this message was for the
[57:15] prophet the third poll was for the
[57:17] prophet the spoken word is for somebody
[57:19] else the spoken word is for the
[57:20] preachers the spoken word is for the
[57:22] song leaders the spoken word is for the
[57:24] pastors and we Pitchfork it onto
[57:25] somebody else and we don't take on the
[57:27] responsibility of our position if I
[57:30] could just tell it to you like this you
[57:32] have a position in Jesus
[57:35] Christ why does Satan get so mad at
[57:38] you what have you ever done to the devil
[57:40] to make him mad but I want you to
[57:43] realize that you hold a position as the
[57:45] Bride of Jesus Christ now I'm talking
[57:47] about Holy Ghost filled Christians now
[57:49] you hold a position in Jesus Christ that
[57:52] the devil has been after for 6,000 years
[57:55] and be
[57:57] the devil has wanted to be made equal
[57:59] with God since heaven and he's been
[58:01] clawing fighting trying to gain a
[58:04] position where he would be equal with
[58:06] God or Jesus Christ and then here you
[58:09] come in in the 11th hour and you are
[58:11] brought in to be the bride you are made
[58:14] partakers with Jesus Christ through him
[58:17] we are now one with Jesus Christ he has
[58:19] spoken the word for a bride to come
[58:21] forth and here we are in the
[58:23] manifestation you now hold a position in
[58:26] Jesus Christ that Satan has wanted for
[58:28] thousands of years and yet you hold that
[58:31] position Hallelujah so if you hold a
[58:34] position then you are now higher than
[58:36] Satan's position it doesn't matter if
[58:39] you're the skin on the bottom of the
[58:41] body of Jesus Christ you're if you're
[58:43] the skin on the bottom of Jesus Christ's
[58:45] foot if you're the skin on the bottom of
[58:47] the foot then your job is to stomp on
[58:50] the head of the enemy the hand can't do
[58:53] the job but the foot has to do the job
[58:55] brother Andrew of stomping on the heads
[58:57] of the
[58:59] enemy praise the Lord he has a word for
[59:03] our hour and someone is going to
[59:05] manifest manifest that word and if
[59:08] someone is going to manifest that word
[59:10] then I believe it's going to be the
[59:11] message our Believers and I believe it's
[59:14] going to be the message believer that is
[59:16] here tonight we can manifest the very
[59:20] word of God that's been spoken about
[59:22] since the beginning
[59:26] that's right if we could catch it praise
[59:28] the Lord I think I ate the
[59:33] mic but I want to show you the power of
[59:36] words using negative words now this is
[59:39] this is science here telling us this I
[59:41] didn't just make this up using negative
[59:44] words such as I can't or I won't right
[59:47] it increases stress hormones such as
[59:50] cortisol which slows down metabolism
[59:54] increasing inflammation over over
[59:57] time science says that those phrases are
[1:00:00] so powerful they are toxic to your
[1:00:03] physical body this is not something I
[1:00:06] just made up this is science telling us
[1:00:08] this that's right that what we speak out
[1:00:11] of our own mouths is so powerful that it
[1:00:14] can have an impact on our physical body
[1:00:18] so many people want to say oh sticks and
[1:00:19] stones may break my bones but words will
[1:00:20] never hurt me no no no no that's not
[1:00:23] truth on that psychology that you're
[1:00:26] making up just to make yourself feel
[1:00:27] better but that's not the
[1:00:29] truth true but positive words such as I
[1:00:33] can I will I love I'm happy it increases
[1:00:39] energy in the frontal lobe of your brain
[1:00:41] increasing creativity
[1:00:44] purpose
[1:00:46] Etc so the words that we speak out of
[1:00:49] our mouths carry so much power that it
[1:00:52] can affect even our physical bodies
[1:00:56] believe and there's nothing new Under
[1:00:58] the Sun Proverbs 18 uh 21 says death and
[1:01:02] life are in the power of the tongue and
[1:01:05] they that love it shall eat the fruit
[1:01:06] thereof you see that truth had been
[1:01:08] laying there in the scriptures this
[1:01:10] entire time but scientist just now
[1:01:12] trying to figure out wow these words
[1:01:14] actually have some some
[1:01:17] power we've known the word has power
[1:01:20] because there was a word that went forth
[1:01:21] in the beginning that said let there be
[1:01:23] light and we are still seeing the
[1:01:25] manifestation
[1:01:27] you see God's thoughts of the Believers
[1:01:29] are Eternal thoughts and when God said
[1:01:32] let there be light that light is still
[1:01:34] shining to this day and his thoughts of
[1:01:37] you are no different he had a thought of
[1:01:40] you in the beginning and we've had a
[1:01:42] word come down in our age and it said he
[1:01:44] is calling out a bride and when that
[1:01:47] message comes forth and says Bride come
[1:01:50] up a little higher there is going to be
[1:01:52] a molecule somewhere there's going to be
[1:01:54] a molecule named Andrew that's going to
[1:01:57] rise up and say Lord that's me I'm going
[1:01:59] to respond to that word there's going to
[1:02:01] be a little molecule named Ben shaml out
[1:02:04] somewhere floating around that's going
[1:02:06] to respond to the word of Jesus Christ
[1:02:08] and say that word is me I am the word
[1:02:12] and he is
[1:02:13] me everything that God was he poured
[1:02:15] into Jesus Christ and everything that
[1:02:17] Jesus Christ is he poured into the
[1:02:22] church so God and His word are the same
[1:02:26] you and the word are the
[1:02:29] same you are the
[1:02:32] manifestation of what the word is
[1:02:35] talking
[1:02:36] about so when the message comes and says
[1:02:39] I will have
[1:02:41] Overcomers hello when the word says I
[1:02:44] will have Overcomers then there must be
[1:02:47] somebody to respond that will overcome
[1:02:50] but we're not going to overcome without
[1:02:51] a battle all right we know that amen so
[1:02:55] don't be surprised the next time you go
[1:02:56] through a
[1:03:00] battle but when you're going through a
[1:03:02] battle we have a promise there's a word
[1:03:04] that's already been spoken that must
[1:03:06] come to fulfillment amen but a word is a
[1:03:12] thought expressed scripture says as a
[1:03:15] man thinketh in his heart so is he sir
[1:03:19] second Corinthians 10:3
[1:03:22] says for we walk
[1:03:25] though we walk in the flesh we do not
[1:03:28] war after the
[1:03:29] flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are
[1:03:32] not
[1:03:33] carnal But Mighty through God to the
[1:03:37] pulling down of
[1:03:39] strongholds you see what we've done as
[1:03:41] human beings is we've let Satan so
[1:03:43] influence us we hear it all the time
[1:03:45] people come and complain and say oh the
[1:03:47] the devil's been telling me this oh the
[1:03:48] devil's been telling me that well if you
[1:03:50] know it's the devil telling you
[1:03:51] something why are we listening to it
[1:03:57] but he comes and says oh this person
[1:03:59] across the Pew brother sister you know
[1:04:01] they just don't like you did you see how
[1:04:03] they looked at you the other day brother
[1:04:05] Andrew you were preaching your heart out
[1:04:06] and they just didn't raise their hand
[1:04:07] and say Amen oh my and we let him build
[1:04:12] complexes within us we're we're allowing
[1:04:15] him to build strongholds inside of
[1:04:22] us but we have a word amen verse 5 says
[1:04:26] casting down imaginations you see so
[1:04:29] many of those strongholds that are built
[1:04:31] up in a church you see a lot of them are
[1:04:33] just imaginations none of them are
[1:04:35] actual problems but it's what people
[1:04:37] think of a situation you say oh that
[1:04:40] person doesn't like me well you have you
[1:04:42] talked to him and asked him oh this
[1:04:44] person looked at me funny or this you
[1:04:46] know they they they they build up this
[1:04:47] situation so much in their minds that
[1:04:49] they build a rift or or or a wedge
[1:04:52] between you and another believer when it
[1:04:54] may or may not exist that way
[1:04:57] but casting down imaginations and every
[1:05:00] High thing that exalts itself against
[1:05:03] the knowledge of God and bringing into
[1:05:06] captivity every thought into The
[1:05:09] Obedience of Jesus Christ amen we see so
[1:05:12] many people build up complexes about
[1:05:14] themselves how they look or or or or
[1:05:17] what have you what other people think
[1:05:18] about you
[1:05:20] or and we see it drive people away from
[1:05:22] church all the time
[1:05:25] it's a stronghold that Satan is trying
[1:05:27] to build up to get you distracted
[1:05:29] brother Bram came and and told us the
[1:05:31] story of the eagle and the chicken he
[1:05:33] said that a farmer came and stole that
[1:05:34] chicken egg out of that nest and raised
[1:05:37] it by a hen and it grows up and they're
[1:05:40] like here peck on this a little while
[1:05:41] peck on this a little while peck on this
[1:05:42] a little while and just something didn't
[1:05:44] seem right to that little Eagle do you
[1:05:45] know why because he was an eagle from
[1:05:47] the beginning he never was a chicken he
[1:05:49] was eating on the chicken's food as much
[1:05:51] as he could but it wasn't doing him any
[1:05:52] good he said there was something higher
[1:05:54] for that eagle
[1:05:56] but you see those chickens will try to
[1:05:57] keep you a chicken you know why because
[1:05:59] eagles eat
[1:06:01] chickens so as long as you're dwelling
[1:06:03] with the chickens those chickens don't
[1:06:04] want you to know that you're an eagle
[1:06:06] because as soon as you notice hey you
[1:06:09] know what I'm built a little bit
[1:06:10] different I can stand up on that post
[1:06:12] and Mama Eagle says jump Mama Eagle says
[1:06:15] come up a little higher then you have
[1:06:18] the ability that the chickens don't
[1:06:20] have oh the devil's Devil's trying to
[1:06:23] beat up the message believer especially
[1:06:26] the young people man he's trying to tell
[1:06:28] them you don't you're not worth anything
[1:06:30] you don't amount to anything this
[1:06:31] message isn't for you this message is
[1:06:33] too hard the the youth group that I grew
[1:06:35] up with when I was young I don't know if
[1:06:37] there's hardly any aside from my family
[1:06:39] and and related family that's still in
[1:06:40] the message
[1:06:43] even because Satan is coming against the
[1:06:45] young
[1:06:47] people but my scripture says that God
[1:06:50] will not lose a one we have a word you
[1:06:54] see people have a hard time
[1:06:55] understanding predestination but there
[1:06:57] is something that holds
[1:06:59] you there is something that'll hold you
[1:07:01] through the hard times there's something
[1:07:03] that'll pick you up when you're down on
[1:07:05] the ground there's some there's there's
[1:07:07] an arm that is long enough that will
[1:07:08] pick you up out of the myy
[1:07:11] clay so we have weapons to our Warfare
[1:07:15] yes but the world is telling us to look
[1:07:17] at what we tell ourselves or or what
[1:07:19] other people think about us but brother
[1:07:21] brandom came and told us it doesn't
[1:07:23] matter what other people think about you
[1:07:24] it doesn't matter what you think of
[1:07:26] yourself you see that psychology what
[1:07:28] matters is what God has said about
[1:07:31] you if we could only catch that it it
[1:07:34] only matters it doesn't matter what your
[1:07:36] past is you've never gone too far
[1:07:38] there's only one unforgivable sin
[1:07:40] brother Bram said but it doesn't matter
[1:07:43] what you've done God's arm is long
[1:07:46] enough sir oh but you don't understand
[1:07:48] what I've been going
[1:07:49] through I can't receive my healing
[1:07:51] because of this or that you see that's a
[1:07:53] stronghold come on and this word has
[1:07:56] come forth tonight to free you from that
[1:07:59] stronghold you don't need screaming and
[1:08:01] shouting to be released from a
[1:08:04] stronghold you know there was a time
[1:08:06] where Paul and Silas were in prison one
[1:08:09] night and at midnight they started to
[1:08:11] sing songs they weren't screaming and
[1:08:14] they weren't shouting but they were just
[1:08:15] singing good old gospel songs at
[1:08:17] midnight it's a dark dungeon it's wet
[1:08:20] down there it's cold down there it's
[1:08:21] dark down there and they were bound with
[1:08:23] the enemy's chains you see I want you to
[1:08:25] notice they were not bound by chains of
[1:08:27] Paul and Silas but they were Bound by
[1:08:29] the Romans
[1:08:31] chains come on you see if those chains
[1:08:34] were Paul and silas's chains then it
[1:08:37] would be their responsibility to pick up
[1:08:39] those chains and carry them to work it
[1:08:42] would be their responsibility to pick up
[1:08:44] those chains and carry them to school
[1:08:46] it'd be their responsibility to pick up
[1:08:48] those chains and carry them to church
[1:08:50] but you see those chains were not Paul
[1:08:52] and silas's chains those chains belonged
[1:08:54] to the jail
[1:08:56] so when Satan's coming against you and
[1:08:57] saying you are bound by depression you
[1:09:00] are bound by this or that you know
[1:09:02] whatever your problem is and he's saying
[1:09:03] you're just Bound by this you're bound
[1:09:05] by a complex that complex is not your
[1:09:08] complex you can let go of it because
[1:09:10] Jesus Christ has come and he has shaken
[1:09:12] those he has shaken your shackles loose
[1:09:15] and those chains do not belong to you
[1:09:17] they are not yours they belong to the
[1:09:20] devil and you can leave them with him
[1:09:21] because we have a victory to win tonight
[1:09:24] something to be free
[1:09:26] from brother I liked what you said the
[1:09:28] other day about
[1:09:30] feeling the
[1:09:36] sound but we had a word go
[1:09:38] forth and when that word when you and
[1:09:41] the word become
[1:09:43] one I'm going to get ahead of
[1:09:46] myself but when you and the word become
[1:09:49] one sir what comes out of your mortal
[1:09:53] lips these ones right here everybody
[1:09:55] could reach up and touch the
[1:09:57] lips what comes out of these when you
[1:10:00] are a holy ghost filled
[1:10:02] believer what comes out of these lips
[1:10:06] are not your words but they are Jesus
[1:10:09] Christ's own
[1:10:12] words Hallelujah Lord man if my name was
[1:10:16] Andrew I'd be jumping all over the place
[1:10:19] man but when you're a holy ghost filled
[1:10:22] believer and your life lines up with the
[1:10:24] scripture and you claim that healing
[1:10:26] with these lips that is Jesus Christ
[1:10:29] brother ROM said speaking through your
[1:10:31] lips and that devil has no right to you
[1:10:34] in fact that devil is cast out by the
[1:10:37] name of Jesus Christ if he was standing
[1:10:39] here in the literal Corporal body he
[1:10:41] could do no more for you than when it
[1:10:43] comes across your lips and you can claim
[1:10:46] the same promises today it doesn't have
[1:10:48] to be brother brandom 60 you know 70
[1:10:50] years ago it doesn't have to be Jesus
[1:10:52] 2,000 years ago but it can be you
[1:10:54] yourself standing here tonight and you
[1:10:57] claim the promise of Jesus Christ and
[1:10:58] when you speak the word that word goes
[1:11:01] all the way back to before the beginning
[1:11:03] it was a thought of God he wanted you
[1:11:05] free he wanted you to hear this message
[1:11:07] he wanted you to be free and when you
[1:11:10] speak those words it goes all the way
[1:11:12] back to a thought that Jesus Christ had
[1:11:14] before the beginning of the world that
[1:11:16] you are now responding to brother
[1:11:18] brandham said if he G if God Gave You
[1:11:20] ears it didn't matter if you were deaf
[1:11:23] God wanted you to hear
[1:11:25] amen he said claim the promise in the
[1:11:27] name of Jesus
[1:11:28] [Music]
[1:11:30] Christ but it is God's word living
[1:11:33] through
[1:11:34] flesh
[1:11:36] Woo You See Jesus had perfect Faith
[1:11:38] because he had a perfect revelation of
[1:11:41] who he was in the
[1:11:44] word Jesus knew who he was he could look
[1:11:48] at this Bible and say this is who I
[1:11:50] am if we could only catch that tonight
[1:11:53] when we can look in the Book of
[1:11:54] Revelation he starts talking about a
[1:11:56] bride of Jesus Christ yeah spotless
[1:12:00] sinless BL bride of Jesus Christ
[1:12:04] right and we can identify with that and
[1:12:06] say that is me amen that is me then
[1:12:09] what's going to stand in your way
[1:12:10] then all right brother brandham says in
[1:12:13] blind
[1:12:14] bmus he says has anybody ever seen this
[1:12:16] picture of the light the
[1:12:19] angel yes he says the angel of the Lord
[1:12:21] the pillar of fire see they've got it
[1:12:24] scientist is got it Washington's got it
[1:12:27] yeah but listen to what he says here he
[1:12:28] says now the church has got it in
[1:12:34] reality this church has that light not
[1:12:38] just in a picture on the wall not just
[1:12:41] up in in Jeffersonville not just up in
[1:12:43] Washington
[1:12:45] DC but we have the living reality of
[1:12:48] Jesus Christ Living inside our flesh
[1:12:52] when we are a son and daughter of God
[1:12:54] and many times miss it because it's hide
[1:12:56] behind a veil of Flesh which is which is
[1:12:58] the same type that God has used
[1:13:00] throughout all ages and we can't see
[1:13:02] that it's God because it looks like
[1:13:03] brother Shawn it looks like brother
[1:13:04] Andrew it looks like Ben sham looks like
[1:13:06] brother Dan it looks like and we can't
[1:13:09] see that it's Jesus Christ himself
[1:13:11] living in flesh in this last age and he
[1:13:13] already spoke the word let there be
[1:13:16] light and there was light and it is
[1:13:17] still manifesting itself here
[1:13:20] today oh I was listening to a tape on
[1:13:22] Revelations 4 today and
[1:13:25] you know one of the ministers in brother
[1:13:26] bram's church he had a hard time seeing
[1:13:28] is God on his
[1:13:30] throne and if he's not on his throne
[1:13:32] then where is he yeah and brother Bram
[1:13:34] says we're going to get to that here in
[1:13:35] a
[1:13:37] minute then maybe 30 minutes afterwards
[1:13:39] he goes see it's God in his
[1:13:41] people there you go brother there he is
[1:13:45] you see God's not up in heaven somewhere
[1:13:47] floating around on a cloud unreachable
[1:13:49] and when we pray you know it's just
[1:13:51] throwing hopes and dreams up to the air
[1:13:53] hoping something will happen you see so
[1:13:55] many people these days they pray like
[1:13:57] they're buying a lottery
[1:13:59] ticket you know put me down for five of
[1:14:02] these or however it works I don't
[1:14:05] know hoping that when their number is
[1:14:08] called it just happens to line up boom
[1:14:10] there's a miracle for me that's not how
[1:14:12] it works you see we believe in a living
[1:14:16] God it's not just hope or dreams but
[1:14:20] this is a living reality this is a
[1:14:22] Living Word you want to know what a
[1:14:24] living word it is look around the room
[1:14:28] this is the Living Word of God for this
[1:14:29] age we have a position that we have to
[1:14:32] come
[1:14:34] into I believe she's close we're about
[1:14:36] ready to take a a Rapture here pretty
[1:14:38] Qui
[1:14:40] quick you see it's the same
[1:14:43] light scripture says that God is light
[1:14:46] so when he said let there be light yes
[1:14:49] it was more than just creating the sun
[1:14:51] it was more than just creating the Stars
[1:14:53] you see those two things alone you know
[1:14:55] scientists can't even understand it they
[1:14:57] don't even know if if light dwells in
[1:14:59] time
[1:15:00] yet if you can't even understand
[1:15:04] that then our God is pretty good our our
[1:15:07] God is pretty big our God is pretty
[1:15:10] creative and you know what that little
[1:15:11] sickness that you got that's a little
[1:15:13] dot inside of your body but we're a
[1:15:15] little dot in Virginia and Virginia is a
[1:15:17] little dot on this globe and this
[1:15:19] globe's a little dot in the Galaxy you
[1:15:21] see we we serve a big God we serve a
[1:15:25] great big God and your problem is so
[1:15:28] small but our God is so loving that he's
[1:15:31] not out in some other galaxy somewhere
[1:15:34] but he is living inside of you and when
[1:15:38] you say to this mountain be thou removed
[1:15:42] then you better expect that mountain to
[1:15:44] be
[1:15:45] moving woo
[1:15:49] wow you see Lord there was two Believers
[1:15:52] one time went to go spy out the land of
[1:15:56] Canaan and they met a woman named Rahab
[1:15:59] and I always thought this this story was
[1:16:01] so incredible because they go to meet
[1:16:03] Rahab and they say you just hang the
[1:16:06] Scarlet thread from your
[1:16:08] window now I I want you to be put in the
[1:16:11] position of the two spies because so
[1:16:12] many times we're put in the we know the
[1:16:13] types of of Rahab but I want you to put
[1:16:15] yourself in the position of these two
[1:16:16] spies now but they say put this Scarlet
[1:16:19] thread out your window and you and your
[1:16:21] family will be
[1:16:23] saved what Authority did they they have
[1:16:25] to say
[1:16:26] that you know they didn't brother Andrew
[1:16:29] they didn't go buy a a steel demo saw
[1:16:33] and after they said that get to think
[1:16:35] about it and going you know what her
[1:16:38] house is
[1:16:40] actually in the gates of Jericho and
[1:16:43] they actually run chariot races on those
[1:16:47] on those walls those are pretty thick
[1:16:49] walls how are those walls going to
[1:16:51] collapse and her section of that wall is
[1:16:53] just going to be
[1:16:55] saved they didn't go buy a demo saw and
[1:16:57] go we better make you know we better do
[1:16:58] something
[1:17:00] ourselves go cut a a control joint
[1:17:03] around her
[1:17:05] house no that would have been putting it
[1:17:07] on their own works
[1:17:09] on but they were commissioned by
[1:17:13] God they were in the line of
[1:17:16] duty and when they
[1:17:19] said that you and your house will be
[1:17:21] saved when you display the token all of
[1:17:25] the authority of not only Israel was
[1:17:27] behind them but all of the authority of
[1:17:29] heaven was behind
[1:17:31] them and that was just a conversation
[1:17:33] that they were having hiding in their in
[1:17:35] this in a harlot's house yeah all right
[1:17:38] but when the when the words came off of
[1:17:40] their lips the two spies when it came
[1:17:42] off their lips it was as good as God
[1:17:44] saying it himself it doesn't matter I I
[1:17:47] mean it goes it begins to
[1:17:50] crack and it
[1:17:52] goes somehow some way her house was laid
[1:17:56] their standing because they were
[1:17:58] ambassadors from on high you see if our
[1:18:01] country sends ambassadors somewhere then
[1:18:04] they are given full authority to make
[1:18:06] decisions right they say you can
[1:18:09] negotiate this deal we've got a deal we
[1:18:12] we if you're in the line of duty you
[1:18:15] make the deal report back to us they
[1:18:16] don't have to go and start negotiating
[1:18:18] and call up the president hey the deal's
[1:18:20] changed a little bit are you okay with
[1:18:22] this yeah okay all all right go
[1:18:25] negotiate a little bit more hey
[1:18:26] something
[1:18:27] changed no but they are in the line of
[1:18:31] duty they have full
[1:18:34] Authority they are ambassadors of that
[1:18:39] country and if we could realize that we
[1:18:41] are ambassadors we are God sent
[1:18:44] ambassadors to this world today the true
[1:18:47] Holy Ghost Christians now all right you
[1:18:51] are an ambassador of Jesus Christ Living
[1:18:54] on the Earth today so all of the power
[1:18:58] that God poured into Jesus he poured
[1:19:01] into his church are we the Church of the
[1:19:03] Living God then you have the power you
[1:19:07] hold the
[1:19:09] authority to speak the word and it will
[1:19:17] happen for if you say unto this mountain
[1:19:20] that's right all right be thou removed
[1:19:23] and cast into the sea now it doesn't say
[1:19:25] If you
[1:19:27] think but you see if God never spoke the
[1:19:29] word then he would be dwelling with his
[1:19:31] thoughts alone yeah right but those
[1:19:34] thoughts had to come to
[1:19:35] manifestation and words were simply a
[1:19:39] conduit for the thought to become a
[1:19:43] manifestation so if we can look back and
[1:19:45] see ourselves in the scripture then to
[1:19:48] me that's
[1:19:49] 100% amen because it's a thought of God
[1:19:52] yes being in the written word the spoken
[1:19:54] word amen I must be the
[1:19:57] manifestation I have to now the devil
[1:20:00] can't talk me out of it because I've
[1:20:01] already seen it it's a revelation now
[1:20:03] Lord doesn't matter what Satan says
[1:20:07] now but you see there's victory in words
[1:20:10] Revelations 12:11 says and they overcame
[1:20:13] him by the blood of the lamb and the
[1:20:15] what and the word of their
[1:20:20] testimony you see it's important what
[1:20:22] you say it's important what you say to
[1:20:24] other people it's important that you
[1:20:25] tell your
[1:20:26] testimony so many people get ashamed of
[1:20:28] their testimony and won't tell it no it
[1:20:30] is important to tell your
[1:20:32] testimony I know demons that have been
[1:20:34] cast out by
[1:20:36] testimony but there's victory in words
[1:20:39] you know there's one time Joshua comes
[1:20:41] upon a battle and he wanted to destroy
[1:20:42] every enemy yeah we know the story real
[1:20:44] well and the sun became his enemy
[1:20:46] because the Sun starts to go down
[1:20:49] yeah and a son of God in the line of
[1:20:53] duty look looks up at the Sun and says
[1:20:55] son stand
[1:20:59] still son stands how silly is that yeah
[1:21:03] in the human eyes that just seems
[1:21:04] outrageous but when the Son of God looks
[1:21:07] up and says son stand still I'm in the
[1:21:09] line of duty there is something
[1:21:11] hindering me from doing my work I am an
[1:21:14] ambassador of Jesus Christ so I have a
[1:21:17] commission and I must fulfill it so I'm
[1:21:19] going to speak the word for my situation
[1:21:21] and it will happen even if that means
[1:21:24] the entire universe is going to
[1:21:26] pause if it's got to pause for me to do
[1:21:28] my work then it'll pause because I'm
[1:21:30] going to speak the word so you just got
[1:21:32] to take your situation
[1:21:33] tonight you Sons and Daughters of God
[1:21:36] it's time that we take responsibility
[1:21:38] for our position and start to speak the
[1:21:40] word because this position doesn't come
[1:21:43] without
[1:21:44] responsibility there will be those that
[1:21:46] are sick in the church there will be
[1:21:48] those that are bound with chains in the
[1:21:49] church and it is our responsibility as
[1:21:52] Believers to help them along the way it
[1:21:55] is our responsibility to pray for the
[1:21:57] sick it's our responsibility to preach
[1:22:00] the gospel it's our responsibility to
[1:22:02] help the
[1:22:05] needy but there's great victory in words
[1:22:08] you see so many people are trying to
[1:22:10] take the words for this age okay because
[1:22:13] we had a word for this age this word
[1:22:15] isn't for some other age but this word
[1:22:18] is for this age that there will be a
[1:22:19] bride and she will manifest herself and
[1:22:21] there will be a Rapture we're getting
[1:22:22] we're getting so close you see
[1:22:24] everything that's lining up there will
[1:22:26] be a bride in this last agage but they
[1:22:29] try to take the victory out of those
[1:22:31] words and just put it up in
[1:22:32] Jeffersonville and say oh it's it only
[1:22:35] lays on those tapes
[1:22:36] brother you see that Victory brother
[1:22:38] Andrew it's only for those tapes spoken
[1:22:41] word is only for them tapes over
[1:22:44] there on they're making the gospel of
[1:22:47] none effect that's right exactly they're
[1:22:50] taking all of the Victory and putting it
[1:22:52] back 70 years ago 60 70 years go when it
[1:22:55] has no place in the
[1:22:57] past but the victory of the word belongs
[1:23:00] in the church
[1:23:02] today the victory of the word belongs in
[1:23:05] your body
[1:23:08] tonight we're talking about True
[1:23:10] Believers here because my scripture say
[1:23:13] in Hebrews 138 it says God is the same
[1:23:16] yesterday today and forever God never
[1:23:19] changes so when he says let there be
[1:23:22] light there must be light until he says
[1:23:25] otherwise that light is going to keep on
[1:23:28] Shining he doesn't have to come back and
[1:23:30] and and say oh oh no this is an updated
[1:23:32] message Now That We Believe come on
[1:23:35] there's an eighth messenger now that we
[1:23:37] believe no you don't have to add
[1:23:38] anything to it once the word is
[1:23:40] spoken that's
[1:23:42] [Music]
[1:23:44] it but the TR Devil's trying to get you
[1:23:46] only to listen to tapes instead of
[1:23:48] preaching the word because the devil
[1:23:50] knows that your words carry
[1:23:53] power amen he's stripping you of the
[1:23:55] power out of your life now we believe in
[1:23:58] tapes we listen to tapes amen we believe
[1:24:00] that's the spoken revealed word
[1:24:05] amen praise the Lord amen but the world
[1:24:08] has been groaning waiting on the
[1:24:10] manifestation of the sons of God you see
[1:24:12] I don't believe that God came and sent
[1:24:14] his holy ghost for six and a half Church
[1:24:18] ages I don't believe God would Short
[1:24:20] Change us like that but I believe the
[1:24:22] Holy Spirit has been sent for a full
[1:24:24] seven Church ages until we get caught up
[1:24:27] in that Rapture boy I believe the holy
[1:24:28] spirit is here to heal it's here to save
[1:24:32] it's here to set free amen you know what
[1:24:35] and and and maybe I'll just bring it to
[1:24:36] a close here pretty quick
[1:24:38] but the holy spirit is here there's more
[1:24:41] than two or three Believers the holy
[1:24:43] spirit is here and maybe we can't see
[1:24:46] him in the physical like brother brandom
[1:24:47] saw him in the physical because he is
[1:24:49] like light he can be around us and we
[1:24:51] only see the effects of him right
[1:24:55] amen Pastor cumi was telling me a
[1:24:57] testimony of of a a sister over in
[1:25:01] Africa when we were preaching for him
[1:25:02] earlier this
[1:25:03] year he said the sister had an ulcer a
[1:25:06] cancer something and it was eating her
[1:25:08] up and um they were going to have to do
[1:25:11] surgery on her and after they did the
[1:25:12] surgery of course she couldn't have
[1:25:14] children and and all of those things but
[1:25:17] he said under the preaching of the word
[1:25:19] at those
[1:25:20] meetings you see I never met this woman
[1:25:23] I never saw her there's like 5 th000
[1:25:24] people in this church huge churches over
[1:25:26] there but he said under the preaching of
[1:25:28] the
[1:25:29] word she went back to the doctor said I
[1:25:33] need to get this x-ray got it
[1:25:35] x-ray couldn't find the tumor anywhere
[1:25:38] couldn't find the ulcer anywhere he goes
[1:25:41] but I did find
[1:25:43] something it was a
[1:25:46] baby he found a baby inside of her when
[1:25:50] science said there's no way that's
[1:25:52] nothing I can do we can preach all we
[1:25:55] want but if God doesn't come down and
[1:25:56] show himself real then it's all for
[1:25:59] nothing but we believe that Jesus Christ
[1:26:01] is here because the same atmosphere that
[1:26:04] was over there that night is here
[1:26:05] tonight we believe the same God that was
[1:26:08] over there that night is here tonight
[1:26:09] all we need to do is reach up and say
[1:26:11] Lord let there be light in my life may I
[1:26:15] accept the word for my age may I come to
[1:26:18] manifestation because there's a deep
[1:26:20] calling out to the deep and there is a
[1:26:22] deep that will respond am whatever your
[1:26:25] situation is whatever the healing is
[1:26:28] that you need whatever those shackles
[1:26:29] are it's time that we let loose and we
[1:26:32] we we just continue right into
[1:26:35] freedom because Freedom Is Ours Victory
[1:26:38] Is Ours let those let those walls
[1:26:42] fall but our word will stay true because
[1:26:44] we're standing with the word of Jesus
[1:26:47] Christ if we could just stand and the
[1:26:49] the musicians come I'll try to wrap it
[1:26:50] up here now it's a Wednesday night I
[1:26:52] don't want to keep you along
[1:26:56] Jesus had a third pole
[1:26:58] Ministry brother brandom had a third
[1:27:00] pole Ministry and I believe we are a
[1:27:03] part of the third pole Ministry amen
[1:27:05] amen yes sir we are a part of the spoken
[1:27:09] word you know why because you're the
[1:27:13] manifestation you are the manifestation
[1:27:15] of the spoken word we're in the age of
[1:27:18] the spoken word we believe that first
[1:27:20] John 1:14 says and the Word was made
[1:27:23] flesh and dwelt Among Us am yes see so
[1:27:28] many times
[1:27:30] we're looking for some great big
[1:27:33] lightning bolt to strike us to receive
[1:27:35] our healing or to receive our need or
[1:27:38] except that it was the Lord's word for
[1:27:39] us when we don't need any of that it's
[1:27:42] just like light let let the
[1:27:44] manifestation come forth It's Faith just
[1:27:47] reach up and grab a hold of it don't
[1:27:50] ever let it go amen because it's just as
[1:27:53] real it's more real than us standing
[1:27:56] here
[1:27:58] tonight brother brandom
[1:28:02] says the sun would shine on some dirt
[1:28:05] and this the uh dirt would say oh this
[1:28:09] sun is too hot The Rock would say oh
[1:28:11] this old sun is so hot but that little
[1:28:14] seed said that's what I'm looking
[1:28:16] [Music]
[1:28:18] for and it began to Spring forth to life
[1:28:22] it quickened that part of the dirt
[1:28:24] because the sun was sent not to Quicken
[1:28:26] The Rock not to Quicken the dirt but it
[1:28:29] was quickened to give life to the
[1:28:32] [Music]
[1:28:34] seed the scripture says that to them
[1:28:38] that believe this word it will Quicken
[1:28:41] your mortal bodies and then we had a
[1:28:43] word come in our age and he said not
[1:28:46] will be
[1:28:47] quickened but is quickened right
[1:28:51] now you see you used to be an
[1:28:54] coholic you used to be a drug
[1:28:57] addict but you're not anymore what
[1:28:59] happened the word has quickened you you
[1:29:02] might be sick
[1:29:04] tonight you might be in shackles tonight
[1:29:07] I don't know what your need
[1:29:09] is but there's a quickening power that's
[1:29:12] here and he is here I believe
[1:29:15] that so all you have to do is reach up
[1:29:17] and say
[1:29:18] Lord I am ready to take on the
[1:29:21] manifestation there's a word that's
[1:29:23] already gone forth there's a a message
[1:29:26] that's gone forth for our age it's
[1:29:28] already been spoken so if the word has
[1:29:31] already been spoken then manifestation
[1:29:33] must follow there's no question about it

[1:29:38] heads dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord

[1:39:40] been a a real honor brother sea to be
[1:39:42] here and to be a part of the church and
[1:39:44] thank you for your stand for this
[1:39:46] message and everything that you all
[1:39:48] stand for and we appreciate the vision
[1:39:50] here for the message of the hour and I
[1:39:53] just tonight I I know brother Sean has
[1:39:54] announced it and I just wanted to take
[1:39:57] this opportunity to share my heart with
[1:39:59] you all um we know in Romans 8:14 the
[1:40:02] Bible tells us as many as are led by the
[1:40:05] spirit of God they are the sons of God
[1:40:08] and we know that anytime that God would
[1:40:10] call a man to do something or lead a man
[1:40:13] somewhere or uh to follow his will for
[1:40:16] their life there can be a maybe some
[1:40:18] confusion or misunderstandings and I
[1:40:20] believe the only way that we can avoid
[1:40:22] those is just to sh our heart and I want
[1:40:24] to say that brother Sean ministered here
[1:40:27] a couple weeks ago on a Sunday morning I
[1:40:29] believe on resting in the will of God
[1:40:31] for our lives and I tell you if there
[1:40:33] ever was a sermon directly spoken to my
[1:40:35] heart that sermon was directly spoken to
[1:40:38] me brother Sean um because no matter how
[1:40:41] confident we are of the will of God the
[1:40:44] vision of God for our lives there's
[1:40:46] always that side of the humanity that
[1:40:49] struggles but I want to say I think of
[1:40:51] how that Abraham in the Bible
[1:40:54] uh the Lord would move him from time to
[1:40:56] time and think of Elijah how that God
[1:40:58] would move him from cherith to zarap
[1:41:01] paath and think of brother brandom our
[1:41:03] prophet in this day who was moved uh to
[1:41:06] follow the will of God for his life and
[1:41:08] we see that even those transitions have
[1:41:11] uh come into many of our Lives as we've
[1:41:14] had to follow the will of God in very
[1:41:16] difficult times but I just want to say
[1:41:19] that even I was just thinking today of
[1:41:21] how that uh maybe we think of our
[1:41:23] brother bcll there who had to leave
[1:41:25] everything and move to a different place
[1:41:27] to do what the lord lord had for him or
[1:41:30] you think of these men of God I know
[1:41:31] brother sha before has had these
[1:41:33] transitions I think of uh brother Donnie
[1:41:36] I know brother Terry brother Amos has
[1:41:37] heard this many times I've heard it as a
[1:41:39] kid often wondering how that God would
[1:41:41] show a man the will of God for his life
[1:41:44] to leave there in Kentucky and move to
[1:41:46] Tennessee and we know the Lord gives us
[1:41:48] Transitions and times but I just want to
[1:41:51] if it's okay to share a quote that God
[1:41:53] has just given to me during this time
[1:41:56] that's been a real strength to me it's
[1:41:58] in the power of transformation brother
[1:41:59] Bram says sometimes you have to separate
[1:42:02] from everything that's dear on Earth to
[1:42:04] you to take your position that God has
[1:42:06] called you to he said I'm sure you can
[1:42:08] read between the lines what I'm saying
[1:42:09] see sometimes the very dearest person on
[1:42:12] Earth you have to shake hands with them
[1:42:14] and take your position in Christ to
[1:42:16] where God is called you see but what is
[1:42:18] God doing transforming you from what you
[1:42:21] was maybe a daughter or a son whatever
[1:42:23] it is from a lovely family sometimes he
[1:42:25] places you somewhere else because it's
[1:42:28] his way of doing it see by the renewing
[1:42:30] of your mind to obey the word of God
[1:42:33] regardless of what the price is and so
[1:42:36] tonight I just want to share with you
[1:42:38] from my heart the Lord spoke to her
[1:42:40] heart there in February and showed us
[1:42:42] that he was moving us to Arkansas to be
[1:42:45] there with brother Matt Morris in the
[1:42:46] church there at Grace Tabernacle and as
[1:42:49] always as brother Shawn was even
[1:42:51] speaking the humanity side is very
[1:42:54] very hard sometimes when you don't quite
[1:42:56] understand everything but sometimes we
[1:42:58] have to forsake all to follow the lord
[1:43:00] and I want to say that that's uh what
[1:43:03] we're doing is to follow the will of the
[1:43:04] Lord amen there's no issues or no
[1:43:07] problems or situations just following
[1:43:10] the will of God and though we don't
[1:43:12] understand all the time that's what's on
[1:43:14] our heart to do is to serve him and I
[1:43:16] want to say that U brother Sean we thank
[1:43:19] you amen of course for this opportunity
[1:43:22] to say that I believe we're still one
[1:43:24] body I believe we'll still be a part of
[1:43:26] the body and as brother Sean said we'll
[1:43:28] be coming through to visit as the Lord
[1:43:30] and brother sea would allow us to and I
[1:43:32] think of how brother brandham says that
[1:43:34] we're all sheep of one
[1:43:37] pasture amen though we may be serving
[1:43:40] God different areas different locations
[1:43:43] we're all sheep of one pasture and I
[1:43:45] just want to take this moment maybe to
[1:43:47] just say this I want to thank you all
[1:43:49] for all the love and support I want to
[1:43:52] thank you for all the prayers the many
[1:43:54] times we've been gone and been gone for
[1:43:56] weeks and sometimes a month or two at a
[1:43:58] time and to have the consolation that
[1:44:00] this assembly was praying for us and
[1:44:02] amen to be able to listen to brother
[1:44:04] Shawn on the way to church and hear the
[1:44:06] song leaders say they were praying for
[1:44:07] us and amen to hear Brother Sean say he
[1:44:10] was praying for us that means the world
[1:44:12] to us amen all the support I want to
[1:44:14] also take this time and I pray y all
[1:44:16] just give me a moment I don't want to um
[1:44:19] get
[1:44:21] uh I want to say this I want to thank
[1:44:24] you for all the support you've given us
[1:44:26] in prayer as well as the financial
[1:44:29] support um I think of when the lord gave
[1:44:31] us our little son Malachi and brother
[1:44:33] Shawn uh so graciously in the church
[1:44:36] here um helped us during that time to be
[1:44:38] able to stay home and to be here and you
[1:44:41] know uh as brother Shawn said when he
[1:44:43] did that he wanted to be a blessing to
[1:44:44] us and I want to thank you brother Shawn
[1:44:46] for that and I want to thank this church
[1:44:48] for all their love to my wife the times
[1:44:50] I've been gone Amen to Malachi
[1:44:53] amen all the food that you brought to us
[1:44:55] when Malachi was born there's so many
[1:44:57] things I could start listing I just want
[1:44:59] to say this thank you from the bottom of
[1:45:02] our hearts I want to say thank you uh to
[1:45:05] every member here of the church I want
[1:45:07] to say I love you all with the love of
[1:45:08] the lord we appreciate you with all of
[1:45:10] our hearts and amen I just want to say
[1:45:13] this to brother Sean he's been a mentor
[1:45:15] to me he's been a friend he's been an
[1:45:18] influence to me in my life beyond just
[1:45:21] preaching Beyond just the ministry but
[1:45:23] just in his everyday life and things
[1:45:26] I've seen him do things I've the way
[1:45:28] I've seen him handle situations he's
[1:45:30] been an influence to me and as I was
[1:45:32] just speaking there Sunday um to the
[1:45:34] church in Pennsylvania of how that the
[1:45:37] Lord will raise up young people and how
[1:45:38] that instead of maybe pushing them aside
[1:45:41] during their immaturities we ought to
[1:45:43] cultivate the gifts and I want to say
[1:45:45] from the bottom of my heart that brother
[1:45:48] Shawn was one of those men that did that
[1:45:49] for me uh he believed in me when others
[1:45:52] did
[1:45:53] opened his door to me his pull pit to me
[1:45:56] allowed me to be a part of the meetings
[1:45:58] here for many years brother Sean I want
[1:46:00] to say thank you I love you with all my
[1:46:02] heart I appreciate your stand for this
