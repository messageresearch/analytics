[34:38] I believe the Lord has spoken in this

[34:43] and you know the ministers are just here
[34:47] to echo what has been spoken and that we
[34:53] may rest. Amen. We certainly want to
[34:55] rest. Can you say amen? Amen. and and
[34:58] the musicians can be dismissed. It's
[35:00] good to see everyone in the house of the
[35:03] Lord and um um I didn't know who all
[35:08] would come uh being that the weather is
[35:11] supposed to be getting bad, but uh we
[35:13] will um not keep you too long today. Uh
[35:18] if you have your Bibles, we're going to
[35:21] turn to the book of Psalms
[35:23] 107. and uh just kind of um changed my
[35:28] thought on the way to church here. And
[35:30] so
[35:32] um trusting the Lord to help us today.
[35:36] Amen. Uh Psalms 107
[35:41] and 19. I think that's it.
[35:47] And um we want to uh remember uh Sister
[35:52] Shirley Jonce in our prayer and um uh
[35:57] the Lord will just help her. Also,
[36:00] Sister Kim Weeks um text said she's
[36:05] really suffering today in her knees and
[36:08] um with the the weather coming on uh
[36:12] it's caused the intens intensified the
[36:15] pain and so we certainly want to keep
[36:19] her in our
[36:20] prayer. And then uh brother Shmaya uh
[36:24] was just asking for prayer about
[36:27] Shubiel. And uh he's um not gaining
[36:30] weight. He's holding his own. Uh well,
[36:34] when I say he's holding his own, he's
[36:36] taking um uh they're giving him uh
[36:39] formula um to help him gain weight, but
[36:44] he's not gaining weight. But uh so uh
[36:48] little concerned about that. And so I
[36:50] told him we would just pray that the
[36:53] Lord will just um whatever that would be
[36:56] the situation that the Lord will just uh
[36:59] help help and come on the scene God has
[37:03] brought Shouel uh far um you know and
[37:07] helped him and I know he'll help him
[37:09] with this. I just believe that. Do you
[37:11] believe that? Amen. And so let's just
[37:14] pray for these needs and uh we'll just
[37:17] pray for the the word the ministering as
[37:20] well of the word.
[37:22] Father Lord you see the needs that have
[37:25] been presented here
[37:27] today Lord your people suffering
[37:32] uh whether it be cancer, arthritis or
[37:36] not gaining the weight whatever it would
[37:38] be. Father, we don't have to go to many
[37:42] physicians for these different needs.
[37:45] You're the one great chief physician
[37:48] that can meet any need. Father, we're
[37:51] asking that you would do that, Lord.
[37:54] We've seen you touch cancer, drive that
[37:57] uh spirit of cancer out of bodies many
[38:00] times. We've seen you touch and heal
[38:03] arthritis and raise the the crippled out
[38:07] of a
[38:08] wheelchair. We've seen the blind eyes
[38:10] open, Father. We've seen you do so many
[38:14] things, Lord. And Father, this request,
[38:18] Lord, that we're asking of you is is
[38:20] nothing to you. And we're your children.
[38:23] We're believers, Father. We're praying
[38:26] that you would just cause that baby to
[38:28] start gaining weight, Lord. And Lord,
[38:32] just drive back that enemy, Lord, of of
[38:36] affliction. We pray that you would touch
[38:39] Sister Kim where at home, Lord, as she's
[38:43] suffering with intense pain, Father,
[38:46] drive that spirit of arthritis away from
[38:49] her, Lord, as she is proclaiming her
[38:52] healing. A a woman of faith, Father, oh
[38:56] God, we just believe you to do it, Lord.
[38:59] And sister Shirley, Father, you see the
[39:03] situation there. May faith arise in her
[39:06] heart, Lord. And that she could claim
[39:08] your promise of of healing, Father. I
[39:12] don't care what the doctor says and how
[39:15] impossible it looks, Lord. You you
[39:18] you're never too late, Lord. You you can
[39:20] move on uh in the impossibility, Father.
[39:25] I pray that you would just move in the
[39:27] ministering of your word today. Give us
[39:29] the words of life to speak to your
[39:32] people. Father, I pray that you would
[39:34] meet every need here this morning.
[39:37] Anoint me, Lord, and anoint your people.
[39:40] And may we be just elevated into
[39:43] heavenly places. We ask it, Father. and
[39:46] just pray for just a a just a spoken
[39:51] unspoken request Lord uh that has been
[39:54] lifted up today this before church. I
[39:57] just pray that you would meet that need
[39:59] today. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name.
[40:03] And the church says amen and amen. Uh
[40:08] the book of Psalms 107 and it's it's
[40:11] good to have Sister Alice with us this
[40:13] morning. Amen. And we certainly been
[40:16] missing her and and love love her and
[40:20] and brother Terry immensely. Amen. And
[40:24] um they have been just a real uh uh
[40:29] trooper example to us and I appreciate
[40:33] their dedication. God bless you all.
[40:36] Amen. And um Psalms 107 and and 19 it
[40:42] says, "Then they cry unto the Lord in
[40:44] their trouble, and he saveth them out of
[40:47] their
[40:48] distresses. He sent his word and healed
[40:52] them and delivered them from their
[40:56] destructions. Oh, that men would praise
[40:58] the Lord for his goodness and for his
[41:01] wonderful works to the children of men."
[41:05] Amen. You can have your seats this
[41:08] morning and just to take a simple
[41:12] thought. Uh and he sent his word and
[41:16] healed them. And you know we can't never
[41:20] stress the the power that the word of
[41:22] God has. Uh it is it is powerful and uh
[41:28] this is why God uh gives it to us. Um,
[41:32] you know, he he in the beginning he gave
[41:34] his word uh uh to man uh that man could
[41:40] live by and also that he could uh defeat
[41:45] the devil with. And we know that that
[41:48] even in the garden there was an enemy
[41:50] lurking and and but but God had already
[41:55] given them the means to overcome that
[41:59] enemy and and that was the word of God.
[42:02] And of course, when the they they didn't
[42:06] use the word and then Satan was able to
[42:09] come in through reasoning and get them
[42:13] to doubt their weapon, the word of God.
[42:17] And uh so they began to reason. Uh Eve
[42:21] began to reason with the word of God.
[42:23] And you we will never see the power that
[42:27] the word has. We will never have that
[42:30] full awareness that the of power that
[42:34] the word has when we start to reason. We
[42:37] must never ever reason with God's word.
[42:41] Never. Never. Never. And and it doesn't
[42:43] matter what
[42:45] situation. It does not matter what
[42:48] situation. Uh the word of God is given
[42:52] to us to live by and to overcome.
[42:56] And so it is still our defense against
[42:59] any any demon that comes against us. Uh
[43:04] whether it's in in the spiritual,
[43:06] whether it's in the physical, uh
[43:08] attacking us in the physical, spiritual,
[43:10] mental, whatever it would be. Um uh the
[43:13] word of God is still the answer. And I'm
[43:16] so glad for that. It is so simple to be
[43:19] honest, the word of God that that we
[43:22] don't need to be trained in military. We
[43:25] don't need to be educated in the world's
[43:27] training in psychology to overcome
[43:30] things to deal with things. The word of
[43:33] God is simply our defense and it's def a
[43:37] defense um you know uh to the oldest
[43:41] person here as well as to the youngest
[43:44] person. It it's it still remains the
[43:47] same. So I whatever you're dealing with
[43:50] today whether it uh you know in in
[43:53] temptations you might be having uh you
[43:56] you young people might be having certain
[43:58] temptations and and uh there are
[44:01] temptations I think that we all go
[44:03] through uh on different levels or or
[44:06] whatever and and maybe you sisters have
[44:09] different temptations than us us men and
[44:12] and and things like that but the word of
[44:14] God remains the answer for all things.
[44:18] So the young people, young people, you
[44:21] can base your your life upon the word of
[44:23] God and defeat the devil in your life by
[44:27] the simple word of God as much as the
[44:30] preacher can defeat the devil in his
[44:32] life by the word of God or parents and
[44:35] and things like that. See, so uh uh it
[44:39] it is our defense against any demon that
[44:42] comes against us. And and God would give
[44:45] us his word. He gave us his word because
[44:48] that's the best thing he could give. If
[44:51] if he could give us anything else, he
[44:53] would have done it. But he gave us his
[44:55] own word and we know that the word of
[44:58] God is God. God is the word. So he gives
[45:02] us himself as a defense against the
[45:05] enemy. And so when when God gets ready
[45:09] to do
[45:10] anything, as we know, then God always
[45:13] sends his word uh uh ahead of time. And
[45:17] that's that's that's Bible uh uh
[45:20] scriptural um uh he he sends his word
[45:24] and and the way he sends his word is by
[45:28] what? A prophet. Amen. He sends his word
[45:32] by a prophet. and and so simple but yet
[45:35] so true. And and so when God was getting
[45:38] ready to destroy the earth uh uh in in
[45:42] the time of the antidolivian uh world u
[45:46] um well then he he sent uh uh the
[45:49] prophet Noah. Now uh Amos 3 and7 I just
[45:54] uh got it recorded here. U it says
[45:57] surely the Lord God will do nothing. I
[46:00] didn't have time to give them the
[46:01] scriptures, but uh if they can get it
[46:03] up, that'd be fine. But surely the Lord
[46:05] God will do nothing, but he revealth his
[46:09] secret or we'll say he revealth his word
[46:13] to his servants, the prophets. So God
[46:16] won't do nothing but what? He first
[46:19] reveals his word, which is mystery. It's
[46:22] a secret unto his prophets. See, the
[46:25] world didn't know that God was going to
[46:27] destroy the earth. They didn't know
[46:29] that. But God would reveal it to Noah.
[46:33] And then Noah came with thus sayeth the
[46:36] Lord. Amen. That God was going to
[46:38] destroy the earth. And they didn't know
[46:41] what way of escape if there was an
[46:43] escape. But God would reveal it to Noah
[46:46] that there was a way of escape. And that
[46:49] was the ark. Ain't that right? So God
[46:52] sent the prophet Noah with the word of
[46:54] God. He sent his word to the people.
[46:57] Amen. and those that would believe that
[46:59] word would would live. Amen. And so, uh,
[47:03] he sent his prophet Moses with the word.
[47:06] He sent John the Baptist, a prophet,
[47:09] with with the word of God. And then he
[47:12] sent Jesus. And and we know that Jesus
[47:15] uh was not just a prophet, even though
[47:17] he was a prophet, but he was the word
[47:21] made flesh. He was all the word that the
[47:24] prophets had spoke. He became the word.
[47:27] God was made flesh in Jesus Christ.
[47:30] Ain't that right? Amen. See, and so uh
[47:34] uh the the problem is is the word of God
[47:38] is usually not accepted
[47:41] uh uh because of the way God sends his
[47:44] word. God sends his word to deliver to
[47:48] heal, but it's usually not accepted
[47:51] because he sends it uh uh he sends it
[47:55] and and and uh uh uh by a prophet, if we
[47:59] could call it that. Uh it's hard to get
[48:01] people to believe in in God called men.
[48:04] It's hard for man to get man to believe
[48:07] one another. Ain't that right? and and
[48:09] so uh but but it's so important that we
[48:14] just believe uh what God said. We accept
[48:17] what God sends. I think that's the way
[48:19] we ought to say it. We accept what God
[48:22] sends. He sends his word to heal. And
[48:26] and and and yet we've got to accept what
[48:29] he sends. And and now the the um you
[48:33] know God uh Israel did not get their
[48:37] deliverance until uh uh a little bit
[48:40] after uh um u 400 years. God said that
[48:43] he would deliver them at 400 years uh
[48:47] their um after 400 years in bondage. But
[48:51] but when God sent Moses, they rejected
[48:54] him. When God sent his word in the form
[48:57] of a prophet, they rejected him. And the
[49:00] prophet said they stayed in bondage
[49:02] because they refused to respect the
[49:05] deliverer that had come to deliver them.
[49:09] Ain't that right? You say, "Well, the
[49:11] word was supposed to deliver them." But
[49:13] a prophet had that word. So, he became
[49:16] their deliverer. Amen. He became the
[49:19] mouthpiece of God. Therefore, he became
[49:22] God to them and became a deliverer to
[49:25] them. Ain't that right? See, others
[49:28] others could have come, but they didn't.
[49:31] They weren't the deliverer. But Moses
[49:33] come because he had thus said the Lord.
[49:36] And God always sends his word to his
[49:39] people. See, and so they they they
[49:42] refused to respect the deliverer that
[49:44] come to deliver them. That put them back
[49:47] in bondage again. uh not because God
[49:50] wanted them to stay for the time was
[49:53] exactly right, but they stayed 40 years
[49:57] over because they refuse to accept God's
[50:01] provided way of escape. Ain't that
[50:03] right? Amen. You see, even Noah was
[50:07] God's provided way of escape in his day.
[50:10] For he had thus sayeth the Lord. People
[50:13] didn't get into the ark because they
[50:14] didn't believe the prophet Noah. They
[50:16] didn't believe his message. They
[50:18] ridiculed him. Uh uh but yet the word of
[50:21] God was there to deliver them and and to
[50:25] set them free. When God sends his word,
[50:28] that's an act of grace. It's a show of
[50:31] grace. It's a display of God's mercy to
[50:34] you and I. Can you say amen? Amen. See,
[50:37] and so so he sends a prophet with thus
[50:40] said the Lord. God sending his word by
[50:43] that prophet to heal the people. Amen.
[50:47] And yet it's hard to accept God's
[50:49] provided way of the way he sends his
[50:52] word. See? And so now man is just the
[50:56] veil. The man is just the veil that the
[51:00] word is hid behind. And so we've got to
[51:03] look beyond the veil of flesh and see
[51:06] what is in that veil. What is coming out
[51:09] of that veil? Is it just a man's words
[51:12] or is it God's words? Is it is it
[51:15] something that's going to help us and
[51:16] deliver us or is it something that's
[51:18] going to lead us astray? Can you say
[51:21] amen? But God would never send a prophet
[51:23] to lead his people astray. Amen. It's an
[51:26] act of mercy on God's part to save and
[51:29] to heal and to provide a way of escape.
[51:34] Now see, so so the man is just the veil
[51:38] and and you have to accept that. You
[51:40] have to accept what God sends. Ain't
[51:42] that right? And I believe we're all here
[51:45] accepting what God has sent. But but
[51:48] Matthew 23:39, Jesus said, "I say unto
[51:51] you, you shall not see me henceforth
[51:54] till you shall say, blessed is he that
[51:57] cometh in the name of the Lord." Can you
[52:00] say amen? You ain't going to see me
[52:03] anymore until you shall say, "Blessed is
[52:07] he that cometh in the name of the Lord."
[52:09] So the people all through the ages had
[52:12] had to say had to acknowledge blessed is
[52:15] he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
[52:18] When God sent Noah, Amen, there was a
[52:20] people that would say blessed is he that
[52:23] have come in the name of the Lord. When
[52:25] God sent Moses, when God sent Isaiah,
[52:28] when God sent Jeremiah, where wherever
[52:32] God sent a prophet, there was an elect
[52:34] that would just simply say, "Blessed is
[52:37] he that cometh in the name of the Lord."
[52:39] Not trying to find fault in the prophet,
[52:41] not trying to find fault in his word and
[52:44] his prophecy, but blessed is he. Why?
[52:47] Because that was the way God sent his
[52:49] word. Amen. To heal the people. Can you
[52:53] say amen? See, so when a prophet comes
[52:56] with thus sayith the Lord, well then the
[52:58] people are expected to believe him.
[53:01] Amen. The elect. See, now now Brother
[53:04] Brandham would say all that believe, all
[53:06] that believe the message of that age
[53:09] come in and were saved. Ain't that
[53:11] right? All that believe his message, the
[53:14] prophet's message throughout the ages.
[53:16] Amen. They came in and were saved. And
[53:19] so will it be in any age. And all who
[53:22] did not believe the message and the
[53:24] messenger perished. Ain't that right?
[53:27] Amen. So, so then then God said the the
[53:30] the the he he just before Amen. he sends
[53:34] a destruction. Amen. Just before all
[53:38] devils come in, Amen. Just like in this
[53:41] age before all hell could break loose.
[53:44] Amen. God would send a prophet. Amen.
[53:48] For our defense in this age. Ain't that
[53:50] right? Look at look at what what the
[53:53] demons are doing in this age. Homes are
[53:55] being broken up and marriages are being
[53:58] broken and and people are losing their
[54:00] minds and and people are losing
[54:03] convictions and and things are just
[54:05] going haywire to where people don't know
[54:08] what to do. Just before the devil could
[54:11] have his way, God would send a prophet
[54:15] with thus sayith the Lord to keep you
[54:17] sane and to keep you healthy and and to
[54:20] keep your home intact, to keep your
[54:22] children intact, to keep your marriage
[54:24] intact, to keep the church intact. Can
[54:27] you say amen? Because God would have an
[54:29] elect. Amen. and they would not be part
[54:32] of of the demon uh age of of de uh of
[54:36] demonized uh uh society. They wouldn't
[54:40] be a part of that because God would send
[54:42] his word to deliver them to heal them.
[54:46] Can you say amen? And all that don't
[54:48] believe the message and the messenger uh
[54:52] perished. So now the Bible tells us what
[54:55] the word is. He sends his word. Well,
[54:58] what is that word? Well, you know, uh,
[55:01] and I'm just going to read verses here,
[55:03] but, uh, uh, and I didn't write the
[55:07] verses and scriptures down, but it says,
[55:09] "Thy word is settled in the
[55:11] heavens." Thy word, not man's word. Man
[55:16] will say one thing and then change it to
[55:18] something else. Now, sometimes it looks
[55:20] like God contradicts his own word, but
[55:23] God doesn't con contradict his own word.
[55:26] You got to remember that word is spoken
[55:28] by an all- wise God. That word is spoken
[55:31] by a God that whose understanding is
[55:34] beyond our understanding. His ways are
[55:36] beyond our ways. Amen. So, he doesn't
[55:39] send his word for us to figure it out.
[55:42] God doesn't send his word for us to
[55:44] dissect it and argue with it and debate
[55:47] over it and and try to find answers all
[55:49] around to what God meant. Amen. The
[55:51] prophet said, "God's his own
[55:53] interpreter. He interprets his own word.
[55:57] See, so God sends his word for us just
[56:00] to believe his word. That's all we've
[56:02] got to do. We just got to rest in that
[56:04] word. Can you say amen? Don't argue with
[56:06] it. Don't debate it. Don't try to figure
[56:08] it out. Don't worry over it. Don't
[56:11] stress out over it. Just believe it.
[56:14] See, thy word is settled in the heavens.
[56:18] Another scripture, thy word is a lamp
[56:20] unto my feet and a light unto my path.
[56:23] Ain't that right? So he would send his
[56:25] word in the time of darkness. This world
[56:28] is nothing but darkness. And now we see
[56:31] it. It's gross darkness that is upon the
[56:34] people and darkness has covered the
[56:36] earth. It's a time of of great darkness.
[56:39] But thy word is a lamp unto my feet and
[56:42] a light unto my path. Thy word.
[56:47] Another place. Thy word is very pure.
[56:51] Amen. There's it's not contaminated.
[56:54] It's pure. It's fresh. Ain't that right?
[56:59] There's nothing that's going to kill
[57:00] you. It'll kill sin, but it won't kill
[57:03] you. Thy word is pure. You can eat this
[57:06] word. It's got every vitamin that you
[57:08] need to be healthy. To be a healthy
[57:11] Christian in this age, just take the
[57:13] word. It's pure. There ain't no
[57:15] deception in it. You You know how it is
[57:17] in in even in medication. You can take
[57:20] uh one thing a certain medication for
[57:22] for a certain problem and it'll break
[57:24] down other things in your life in in
[57:27] your body and and and so you have to
[57:29] take another medicine to to to
[57:31] contradict that medicine and and before
[57:34] you know it, you just become a medicine
[57:35] bomb or a medicine machine or whatever
[57:37] you want to call it. You're so
[57:39] medicated. But the word of God is true.
[57:42] It's pure.
[57:45] It ain't going to break down something
[57:46] else. And you know, I I used to think
[57:49] even in my own self, but I hear other
[57:50] other ministers, other people say,
[57:52] "Well, I just I don't want to even study
[57:54] the word of God. Don't want to get into
[57:55] this message too deep because I'm afraid
[57:57] I'll go off the deep end." This word is
[58:00] pure.
[58:02] You ain't going to go off the deep end.
[58:05] If you're just simply believing the word
[58:06] of God and you're hungering for the word
[58:08] of God, they that hunger and thirst
[58:10] after righteousness, they shall be
[58:12] filled. God's got everything you need in
[58:15] his word to fortify you, to make you
[58:18] strong, make your faith strong, make
[58:20] your peace real, make your joy real.
[58:24] Amen. Don't have to have anything fake.
[58:27] It's the word of God. Another place it
[58:30] says, "Thy word is true." All right? Thy
[58:33] word is true. There ain't no false in
[58:34] it. Amen. Amen. It's it's just true.
[58:38] Jesus said, "Thy word is truth." Can you
[58:40] say, "Amen." So, what does the word do?
[58:43] It heals. It saves. It delivers. How
[58:48] many believes that? How many's ever been
[58:50] healed? Have you ever been healed? Well,
[58:52] what done that? The word of God. It
[58:54] wasn't a magician's trick. It wasn't
[58:57] even medication that done it. It was the
[58:59] word of God that done it.
[59:03] Can you say amen? Yes, sir. The word of
[59:06] God saves. How many saved? Well, what
[59:08] saved you? Was it a preacher that saved
[59:10] you? No, it was the simple word of God.
[59:14] The word of God saved me. You just
[59:16] believed the word of God. You didn't
[59:18] argue with the word of God. You didn't
[59:19] doubt the word of God. You just believed
[59:22] it. If if he said, "By my stripes,
[59:24] you're healed." You just believed it.
[59:27] Amen. It delivers. You know, the prophet
[59:30] said, "It takes the word." Everybody say
[59:32] it with me. It takes the word to defeat
[59:34] the enemy.
[59:37] You and I know this is simple. That's
[59:40] okay. But but you you can't worry. You
[59:44] can't worry. Worry doesn't defeat the
[59:45] enemy. Regrets doesn't defeat the enemy.
[59:50] Stress doesn't defeat the enemy. Can you
[59:53] say amen? It's more easy to worry than
[59:55] than anything else. It's more easy to
[59:58] get stressed out than anything else.
[59:59] It's more easy whatever because that's
[1:00:02] just the carnal nature. But it takes the
[1:00:04] word of God to defeat the enemy.
[1:00:08] You believe it? takes the word of God to
[1:00:11] defeat the enemy. But also the word
[1:00:14] quickens
[1:00:16] for for that's what the psalmist said,
[1:00:18] "Thy word hath quickened me." Man, see,
[1:00:21] God sends his word for everything. When
[1:00:23] when when you're struggling, Amen. Let
[1:00:26] the word of God come and quicken you.
[1:00:29] when when when you know I there there's
[1:00:31] just things, you know, that I I may not
[1:00:33] understand about the message and I'm
[1:00:35] hearing a prophet and I'm just not
[1:00:36] getting it maybe the way I I feel like I
[1:00:39] need to get it and and and and I'm
[1:00:41] listening to him and I just pray, God,
[1:00:43] just quicken that to me. I I want that
[1:00:46] word to be quickened. I I believe it and
[1:00:48] I want to understand it. I I really want
[1:00:51] it to to so affect me because the word
[1:00:54] of God will quicken. It's it's the thing
[1:00:56] that quickens. Why? Because the word and
[1:00:59] is spirit and life. Can you say amen?
[1:01:03] That's right. See, and so the word
[1:01:05] quickens, it heals, it saves, it
[1:01:07] delivers. But it also is what's going to
[1:01:09] bring on a rapture. This word, so simple
[1:01:14] as it is, is what's going to bring on a
[1:01:17] rapture. Remember in in in 1
[1:01:19] Thessalonians 4, I think in 16, the Lord
[1:01:22] himself shall descend with a shout, a
[1:01:24] voice, and a trump. And we know what the
[1:01:26] prophet said. The shout is the message.
[1:01:29] So if we can say it this way, the shout
[1:01:31] is the word of God and the word of God
[1:01:34] is in the bride and she has become the
[1:01:36] voice, the final voice to the final age.
[1:01:39] Can you say amen? What? By her
[1:01:42] preaching, by this by her living a life.
[1:01:45] Remember thousands of live voices is
[1:01:47] what we need to thunder out the voice.
[1:01:50] Can you say amen? Amen. See? Amen. And
[1:01:53] the dead. Now notice, the Lord himself
[1:01:55] shall descend with a shout, a voice, and
[1:01:57] a trump. And the dead in Christ shall
[1:02:00] rise first. But before the dead could
[1:02:03] rise, and before we could be caught up
[1:02:06] together with them to meet the Lord in
[1:02:07] the air, God had to send his word.
[1:02:13] Ain't that right?
[1:02:15] And if you notice, he didn't send a
[1:02:16] prophet that just agreed with all all
[1:02:19] the uh theology down through the ages.
[1:02:22] He didn't just agree with with all of
[1:02:25] the the things that had been taught
[1:02:26] through the ages.
[1:02:28] Even when he did agree with it, the word
[1:02:31] of God would come and change his
[1:02:33] thoughts about it.
[1:02:37] Everybody thought that that that white
[1:02:40] horse rider was Christ. And even he said
[1:02:43] it was.
[1:02:44] But then when the opening of the word
[1:02:47] came, he said, "I was wrong about that."
[1:02:51] Not only I but everybody else is wrong
[1:02:53] about that. Can you say amen? Why?
[1:02:56] Because the word come but in this day
[1:02:59] that word had to be revealed. That word
[1:03:02] had to be revealed before it could
[1:03:04] affect you. Praise the Lord. You can
[1:03:07] say, "Well, I've got a Bible. I got a
[1:03:08] Bible. That's the word of God." But if
[1:03:10] the word of God is not revealed,
[1:03:14] so God promised to send a seventh angel.
[1:03:16] He promised that there would be a
[1:03:18] seventh angel on the earth at the time
[1:03:20] of the coming of the Lord.
[1:03:23] Can you say amen? That's right. To
[1:03:25] reveal the mysteries. Yes, sir. And if
[1:03:29] you remember, it was after the church
[1:03:31] ages were over in Revelations 4 and1
[1:03:36] that John heard a voice saying, "Come up
[1:03:39] hither."
[1:03:41] What was he? He was summoned to come up.
[1:03:44] Brother Bram said, "That's the rapture."
[1:03:47] And and church, look where we're at. The
[1:03:49] church ages are over. Don denominational
[1:03:52] angels are finished. Can you say amen? A
[1:03:55] mighty angel has come with an open book
[1:03:58] and has his his foot was on the has set
[1:04:01] his foot upon the sea and upon the land
[1:04:03] and swear by himself that time shall be
[1:04:06] no more. The world is falling apart.
[1:04:08] Everything is is going haywire. But the
[1:04:11] word of the Lord endureth forever. And
[1:04:14] that's what he has given us in this age
[1:04:16] is not just a word but a revealed word.
[1:04:21] Can you say amen? It's a revealed word
[1:04:25] that he has sent to heal. Amen.
[1:04:30] A revealed word. Yes, sir. What is the
[1:04:33] word? It's his voice.
[1:04:36] The Lord has spoken. Amen. Amen.
[1:04:39] Hallelujah. The Lord has spoken. And and
[1:04:42] Jesus said, "My sheep hear my voice.
[1:04:46] They know my voice. They hear my voice."
[1:04:50] Can you say amen? Amen. Oh, healing is
[1:04:52] to them. Yes, sir. Because they know his
[1:04:56] voice. They know they they they accept
[1:04:59] it in the way it comes. They can
[1:05:02] ridicule people, ridicule the prophet
[1:05:04] all they want to, but there's an elect
[1:05:05] that says, "Be it unto me according to
[1:05:08] thy word." Amen. Because they'd realize
[1:05:11] it's more than just a man standing there
[1:05:13] speaking. It was God in that man sending
[1:05:17] his word. Amen. Amen. It was the voice
[1:05:21] of God, the word of God that brought
[1:05:23] forth the resurrection of Lazarus. And
[1:05:25] brother Bratton said, "That same voice,
[1:05:28] that same voice that summoned Lazarus
[1:05:30] out of that grave is the same voice that
[1:05:33] summoned you." Can you say amen? You
[1:05:36] wouldn't be in this message if it hadn't
[1:05:38] been a voice that summons you. You
[1:05:39] wouldn't be saved if it hadn't been a
[1:05:41] voice that summons you. And that same
[1:05:43] voice that summons you to an altar that
[1:05:45] summons you, amen, to salvation is also
[1:05:48] is the voice that summons John, amen, to
[1:05:51] come up higher, come up hither. It's the
[1:05:53] voice of God that is summoning us. It's
[1:05:57] calling us into this rapturing grace.
[1:06:01] Hallelujah.
[1:06:03] Well, what kind of a word is it that he
[1:06:05] sends? He sends his word. Well, what
[1:06:07] kind of word is it? Is it the word of a
[1:06:09] man? It's the word of promise.
[1:06:14] Think of that. It's the word of promise.
[1:06:17] It's a bloody bleeding word.
[1:06:20] Ain't that right?
[1:06:24] I think I wished I had it here so I
[1:06:27] could get it right. But wasn't it
[1:06:29] sometime in one of the wars, world
[1:06:32] wars that they had uh the enemy was or
[1:06:36] yeah had the enemy had our guys hunkered
[1:06:39] down.
[1:06:41] They couldn't get out. They needed help.
[1:06:45] They needed to send they had no way to
[1:06:46] send word out, but they had someone had
[1:06:48] a homing pigeon or had a pigeon and they
[1:06:51] put a message up on that, tied it to its
[1:06:54] leg and sent it off. And the Germans saw
[1:06:57] that and they shot that bird. They kept
[1:07:00] shooting that bird. Clipped its wing,
[1:07:02] clipped its whatever and that thing, but
[1:07:04] it made it home. It made it into the the
[1:07:07] the the camp. Amen. And there it was all
[1:07:12] bloody and mangled and all that, but it
[1:07:14] made it safe. Amen. And and there was
[1:07:16] and and I love just the prophet can say
[1:07:18] it so much better. But he talked about
[1:07:20] how they got that and they began to read
[1:07:22] the the words, but he said there was
[1:07:24] blood all over the message, you know,
[1:07:26] and and he's talking about how this is
[1:07:28] with the message that has come in our
[1:07:30] day. It's got blood written all over it.
[1:07:32] Blood is all over this message. Why?
[1:07:35] Because it's not a law to you. It's a
[1:07:37] grace to you. That this word is not to
[1:07:40] condemn you. This word is to heal you.
[1:07:42] This word is to set you free. This word,
[1:07:45] amen, is your help in the time of
[1:07:48] trouble. Can you say amen? God sent a
[1:07:50] message with blood on it.
[1:07:54] Yes, sir. Amen. Oh my. It's a word of
[1:07:58] promise, a bloody bleeding word. You
[1:08:01] know, the Bible says it's impossible for
[1:08:03] God to lie. Can you say that with me? It
[1:08:06] is impossible for God to lie. It's
[1:08:10] impossible for God to lie. So when the
[1:08:12] doctor tells you, well, you got this and
[1:08:14] you got that, there's no hope. It is
[1:08:16] impossible for God to lie. That's what
[1:08:19] you got to say. When when symptoms are
[1:08:21] there and the pain is wretched,
[1:08:23] wretching your body, just say it is
[1:08:26] impossible for God to lie. It's
[1:08:29] impossible. When when everything is
[1:08:31] speaking against God's word and
[1:08:33] everything is contrary to the very word
[1:08:36] that you're believing, it is impossible
[1:08:39] for God to lie. God wouldn't send his
[1:08:42] word. Amen. And only to leave you
[1:08:44] defeated. God sent his word to heal you.
[1:08:50] God sent his word. So then when that
[1:08:53] word is spoken, then it's got to come to
[1:08:55] pass.
[1:08:57] That's where that's where you cannot
[1:08:59] reason with it. No matter how long it
[1:09:02] lingers,
[1:09:03] it will come to pass.
[1:09:06] Do you believe that? It will come to
[1:09:08] pass. Now we have seen this over and
[1:09:11] over and over. This is the the beauty of
[1:09:13] the opening of the word is we have seen
[1:09:16] promises from Genesis all the way to
[1:09:18] Revelations that have been laying there
[1:09:21] dormant waiting for this day and now
[1:09:25] they're happening.
[1:09:28] True. Amen. This why this the prophet
[1:09:30] said the Bible has become a new book.
[1:09:32] And I I tell you the Bible has become a
[1:09:34] new book to us. We we're seeing this
[1:09:36] Bible in a way that the world does not
[1:09:38] see it because we're not just reading it
[1:09:41] as historic history or even as a
[1:09:44] prophecy waiting to happen. We see
[1:09:46] scriptures happening right now. It was
[1:09:49] lingering. But God was faithful.
[1:09:52] And so is he faithful in your life. When
[1:09:55] God sends his word, it must happen. It
[1:09:57] must be fulfilled. You just believe it.
[1:10:01] Ain't that right?
[1:10:03] See, at the right time, his word will
[1:10:05] come to pass because God is obligated,
[1:10:08] not to you.
[1:10:10] He's obligated to his word that he spoke
[1:10:13] about you.
[1:10:15] Now, that's makes it more sure.
[1:10:19] If God was obligated to us and then we
[1:10:22] fail him,
[1:10:24] we come up short, then the answer is
[1:10:27] what is he going to do now? Cuz sometime
[1:10:31] many time we feel unworthy.
[1:10:34] Have you ever just felt unworthy of his
[1:10:35] promises? You felt unworthy of his love.
[1:10:38] You felt unworthy of a rapture. You felt
[1:10:41] unworthy of healing or of deliverance.
[1:10:44] Amen.
[1:10:46] You know what I'm saying? And a lot of
[1:10:47] times it's well then that thought comes,
[1:10:50] well, you knew better. You should have
[1:10:51] known better. But now look at you. You
[1:10:53] know, now what is you know God's mad at
[1:10:55] you and God's this. But see, God's not
[1:10:57] obligated to us. Right? Because if he
[1:11:00] was obligated to us, he he he would
[1:11:02] probably condemn us. But he's obligated
[1:11:05] to his word concerning us. And before
[1:11:08] the foundation of the world, what did he
[1:11:10] do? He justified us. He called us. He
[1:11:13] predestinated us. He glorified us. God's
[1:11:16] obligated to that more than he is to
[1:11:18] your sins.
[1:11:20] He's obligated to that more than
[1:11:22] anything. And then he sends his word
[1:11:26] that you may believe it and be healed.
[1:11:30] You believe it? See, so now, Brother
[1:11:32] Bram said he's obligated to his word.
[1:11:34] Therefore, he is obligated to heal you.
[1:11:38] You believe that God is obligated to
[1:11:40] heal you. As he is to save you.
[1:11:45] Now, we don't approach God in that way.
[1:11:47] God, you're obligated. God, I demand.
[1:11:50] Brother Bram said, you don't demand God
[1:11:51] do anything. Just believe it. Did you
[1:11:54] demand God to save you? Did you come to
[1:11:57] the altar boohoo and crying, "I'm a
[1:11:59] miserable rich now. God, I demand you
[1:12:01] save me." You would have never been
[1:12:03] saved. But you come just upon the basis
[1:12:06] of God's word believing it that God, you
[1:12:09] promised it in your word. I just believe
[1:12:11] it. Now, I'm throwing myself at your
[1:12:13] mercy. I know I'm unworthy. I know I'm
[1:12:16] I'm a sinner. I'm wretched. I'm
[1:12:18] miserable. I you have no you really you
[1:12:22] have no right to save me in in in that
[1:12:24] sense cuz I have nothing to bring to you
[1:12:26] but God you promised
[1:12:29] and I'm going to take you at your word.
[1:12:31] All right. Ain't that right?
[1:12:35] So he's obligated to save you to heal
[1:12:39] you because it's his word that promised
[1:12:42] it. And we are only, everybody say, "I
[1:12:45] am only
[1:12:47] responsible for believing it." Believe
[1:12:50] it. That's right. Abraham said, "You
[1:12:52] don't need to add to it. You don't need
[1:12:54] to take away from it. Just believe it."
[1:12:58] Do you have to understand it to believe
[1:13:00] it? Nope. Just believe it. Do you have
[1:13:04] to explain it to believe it? Nope. Just
[1:13:07] believe it. Aren't you glad for that?
[1:13:10] Yes, sir. See, Noah didn't understand
[1:13:12] the word that God gave to him. He
[1:13:15] couldn't even explain how it was going
[1:13:17] to happen. He didn't understand that
[1:13:20] what rain was. He He didn't He didn't
[1:13:22] understand how it was all going to work
[1:13:24] out. He couldn't explain it to them
[1:13:26] scientists, them smart men, when they
[1:13:29] had their instruments and they could
[1:13:30] they could have they had the proof that
[1:13:32] there was no rain in them clouds.
[1:13:36] But he just believed it. So he preached
[1:13:38] based upon his faith. So do we. We
[1:13:42] preach, we sing, we confess, we testify
[1:13:46] based upon our faith. God said it. I
[1:13:50] believe it.
[1:13:52] Amen. That's right. Abraham didn't
[1:13:54] understand it. He didn't understand how
[1:13:57] everything was going to happen, but he
[1:14:00] just believed it. And the Bible says he
[1:14:02] got weaker in in his body grew weaker.
[1:14:05] His condition grew more impossible, but
[1:14:08] his faith grew stronger. You believe it?
[1:14:12] Because he fed off the word of God. He
[1:14:14] nursed off the word of God. So, you got
[1:14:17] to nurse off the word. You got to
[1:14:19] believe it. He sent his word to heal
[1:14:21] you. He sent his word to deliver. He
[1:14:23] sent his word to save. He sent his word
[1:14:26] to bring on a body change. He sent his
[1:14:28] word. Now, we have to nurse off that
[1:14:31] word.
[1:14:33] Hallelujah.
[1:14:35] Nurse, nurse off the word. Can you say
[1:14:38] amen? Brother Brham said God is a
[1:14:40] breasted God. Ain't that right? Not just
[1:14:43] a breast God, a breasted God. Showing
[1:14:46] that he's got two breast that you can
[1:14:48] feed off, the Old and New Testament.
[1:14:51] Some people just take the old the the
[1:14:52] New Testament and they leave part the
[1:14:54] Old Testament as though the Old
[1:14:56] Testament means nothing. And and then
[1:14:58] there's some that will actually take the
[1:14:59] Old Testament and not the New Testament.
[1:15:01] Amen. But he's a breasted God that you
[1:15:03] could take every bit of this word and
[1:15:06] feed off of it, nurse off it and get
[1:15:08] your strength back.
[1:15:10] That's right. Amen. You love him. See,
[1:15:15] the prophets just simply believed it.
[1:15:17] God had men that would just simply
[1:15:19] believe it and yield themselves to where
[1:15:21] the word would be spoken out of their
[1:15:23] mouth. Now, that's the same thing it is
[1:15:26] with us, church. Amen. We may not be
[1:15:28] prophets in that way, but the word of
[1:15:30] God has come to us by way of a prophet.
[1:15:33] And the Bible or the prophet said the
[1:15:35] word is now in the bride. Can you say
[1:15:38] amen? Amen. And we stand as a prophet
[1:15:41] now in the sense that the word now has
[1:15:44] is in us that if we would just simply
[1:15:47] believe it, yield ourselves to it and
[1:15:49] begin to confess, speak that word, speak
[1:15:52] that word, it's not a new word that
[1:15:54] comes to us outside of what a prophet
[1:15:56] had. It's the same word. And now we
[1:15:59] become the final voice. That word is now
[1:16:03] in our mouth. I am healed. I am saved.
[1:16:07] My children will be saved.
[1:16:10] You understand what I'm saying? You're
[1:16:12] confessing something. The word.
[1:16:17] Amen. Now, Brother Brham said it's God's
[1:16:21] word and we have no right to take away
[1:16:24] from it, but just say it's the truth.
[1:16:30] Just say it's the truth.
[1:16:34] Believe it. Not what he says now. No
[1:16:36] matter what happens,
[1:16:40] believe it.
[1:16:42] This is a word that come to us now. This
[1:16:45] is a word. He's going to take away your
[1:16:47] doubts. He's going to tell you how to
[1:16:48] stand toe-to-toe with the devil. You do
[1:16:51] not stand toe-to-toe by considering your
[1:16:54] feelings and your s symptoms. You you
[1:16:57] cannot He'll whip you on symptoms.
[1:16:59] That's right. He'll destroy you based
[1:17:02] upon what how you feel and your emotions
[1:17:04] and and all the many times I don't feel
[1:17:07] saved. Many times I don't feel healed.
[1:17:08] Many times I don't feel like I got
[1:17:10] victory. Many times you you you
[1:17:13] understand I guarantee you all of us
[1:17:15] preachers all you preachers you don't
[1:17:16] feel like coming behind the pullpit many
[1:17:18] times sometimes you go through
[1:17:20] discouragement sometime sometimes the
[1:17:22] word ain't really just tracking you
[1:17:24] right
[1:17:26] sometimes you just have to you read the
[1:17:28] Bible and nothing just stands out to you
[1:17:30] and you just have to pray oh God give me
[1:17:32] inspiration give me something to say
[1:17:35] true but it doesn't matter that doesn't
[1:17:39] mean I'm not called to preach that
[1:17:40] doesn't mean that they're not called to
[1:17:41] preach.
[1:17:43] Amen. Amen.
[1:17:46] Right. Well, if we do that based upon
[1:17:49] the call that God placed upon our life,
[1:17:52] we don't always feel that call. Even
[1:17:54] brother Brand went through it. He says,
[1:17:55] "I'm I I I don't I don't feel like I'm
[1:17:58] even a preacher." Something like that.
[1:17:59] I'm not even a preacher. He told his
[1:18:02] wife, complained to his
[1:18:04] wife. His wife set him straight.
[1:18:10] Well, sometimes that's the way we feel.
[1:18:11] We don't feel a lot of these things.
[1:18:14] That's right. But we do it by faith.
[1:18:18] So, so if you do that, if you claim
[1:18:20] Christianity by faith,
[1:18:23] then you're going to claim your healing
[1:18:24] by faith. That's the same way you claim
[1:18:26] everything is by faith because he sent
[1:18:28] his word.
[1:18:31] So notice, no matter what happens,
[1:18:33] believe it. Anyhow, that's the way the
[1:18:35] rest of them had to believe it. Amen.
[1:18:39] Ain't that right? That's the way the
[1:18:41] rest of them had to believe it. That's
[1:18:42] the way Paul had to believe the word. He
[1:18:45] wasn't always in revival. But the word
[1:18:48] that came to him, he believed it. That's
[1:18:50] right. Ain't that right? The rest of
[1:18:54] them had to believe it. No matter what
[1:18:55] happened, no matter what they felt and
[1:18:57] how they felt, whether it was in prison,
[1:18:59] out of prison, whether it was sickness
[1:19:01] or in health or whatever it was, they
[1:19:04] just simply believe the word. And that's
[1:19:05] the way you're going to have to believe
[1:19:07] it. And we're, see, we're not excluded
[1:19:09] from that. God gave Palestine to Israel,
[1:19:12] but they had to fight for every inch of
[1:19:14] ground they got. The promise is yours,
[1:19:17] but you have to fight for every inch you
[1:19:20] claim. The devil will see to that.
[1:19:22] Certainly, he will. Can you say amen? So
[1:19:25] don't be afraid to claim promises. Be
[1:19:27] willing to fack for them.
[1:19:30] Claim them.
[1:19:34] Can you say amen? Well, you say, "Well,
[1:19:36] that would make me act ridiculous." It
[1:19:37] does not matter. That's the only way
[1:19:39] you'll be healed. That's the only way.
[1:19:41] He sent his word.
[1:19:44] Now you claim that
[1:19:46] word. You confess that word. Fight the
[1:19:50] devil. stand toe-to-toe with that stupid
[1:19:53] devil. Don't be afraid to claim it.
[1:19:57] God, you will fight every inch of word
[1:20:00] you
[1:20:03] claim. For every inch of ground they
[1:20:05] got, you'll have to fight it. Every inch
[1:20:08] you claim, you you the devil will see to
[1:20:10] that certainly he will. Can you say
[1:20:12] amen?
[1:20:14] So now I'm of the opinion that a prophet
[1:20:16] doesn't say
[1:20:18] nothing or doesn't say something that
[1:20:20] might happen. I believe what he says
[1:20:24] will happen because it's thus sayith the
[1:20:27] Lord.
[1:20:29] Do I know how it's going to happen?
[1:20:30] Absolutely not. Do I have the
[1:20:33] explanations for it? No. I I don't. And
[1:20:36] I'm not even there. I'm not smart enough
[1:20:38] to even try to reason it out. I just
[1:20:40] simply believe it. If God said it, I
[1:20:43] believe it. Well, why would a prophet
[1:20:45] say that? I don't know. I I have no
[1:20:47] idea. I just believe it. Somewhere
[1:20:50] somehow. I just believe it. You
[1:20:53] understand what I'm saying? See, well,
[1:20:55] you say, "Well, that just makes you
[1:20:56] gullible." No, it doesn't. Because we've
[1:20:58] got vindication.
[1:21:00] We got vindication that God has backed
[1:21:03] this thing up. So, so the word that God
[1:21:05] sends, we'll put it this way, is a
[1:21:07] vindicated word. The word that God sends
[1:21:11] is a creative word. Ain't that right? So
[1:21:15] he sent a word or we'll say he sent his
[1:21:18] vindicated word to heal us of all our
[1:21:22] diseases.
[1:21:25] So a prophet now and and I'll get very
[1:21:28] close, but a
[1:21:30] prophet there's a lot of
[1:21:32] confusion when it comes to prophecy.
[1:21:36] I find that people consider prophecy to
[1:21:40] be the same as though it were a prophet
[1:21:44] speaking. That's not
[1:21:47] true. Brother Brham said there's quite a
[1:21:50] difference between a gift of prophecy
[1:21:51] and prophet. A gift of prophecy is in
[1:21:54] the church, but a prophet is born a
[1:21:58] prophet. That's the difference. This man
[1:22:01] might prophesy tonight. He might never
[1:22:02] prophesy no more. It might be on that
[1:22:05] that woman over there the next night and
[1:22:07] this man back here the next night and
[1:22:09] that one over there. But when the gift
[1:22:12] of prophecy is operating, it cannot
[1:22:14] everybody say it cannot. This is the
[1:22:17] words of a prophet speaking. It cannot
[1:22:19] be received unless two or three judge
[1:22:22] judge it to see whether it's right or
[1:22:26] not. But a prophet singular prophet is
[1:22:30] born a prophet comes up a prophet.
[1:22:33] Everything he says in the name of the
[1:22:35] Lord is absolutely truth if he's
[1:22:38] prophesying. See, so another place Paul
[1:22:40] said, "You all may prophesy one by one."
[1:22:43] That's the gift of prophecy, not a
[1:22:45] prophet. See, there's quite a difference
[1:22:47] between gift of prophecy and a prophet.
[1:22:49] The gift of prophecy has to be judged by
[1:22:52] three good spiritual judges before the
[1:22:55] church can receive it. Right? According
[1:22:58] to Paul's writings in Corinthians, the
[1:23:01] judges has to judge this, has to judge
[1:23:04] the interpretations of tongues before
[1:23:06] the church receives it because they
[1:23:08] wouldn't know. But now you take a person
[1:23:11] that would a prophet like Isaiah,
[1:23:13] Jeremiah, Moses, no one, everybody say
[1:23:16] no one. No one stood before them to
[1:23:19] judge whether it was right or not. They
[1:23:22] were born in this world prophets and the
[1:23:24] word of God was with them.
[1:23:27] Ain't that right? See, now God would let
[1:23:31] us
[1:23:33] know how we would know that the word of
[1:23:36] God was with them. It would be divinely
[1:23:39] vindicated. Amen. Now another place now
[1:23:44] he calls some of us to preach, some of
[1:23:46] us to teach, some of us with different
[1:23:48] spirit uh spirits of operation. There's
[1:23:51] nine spiritual gifts in the local body.
[1:23:53] There's a gift of prophecy that could be
[1:23:55] on any person in here tonight or maybe
[1:23:58] never on them again. That just comes and
[1:24:00] goes. So, so if you notice every time a
[1:24:04] gift of prophecy is not always working
[1:24:06] through one person,
[1:24:09] right?
[1:24:11] It can be on anyone. It could fall upon
[1:24:13] any of us today right here.
[1:24:16] And it may fall on you today and never
[1:24:18] do it again. But a prophet is always a
[1:24:22] prophet,
[1:24:23] right? Even when he's when he goes in,
[1:24:27] he he passes on, he's a prophet,
[1:24:31] right? Never changes. Even his death
[1:24:32] does not change him as a prophet. For we
[1:24:35] know that Saul when he called the witch
[1:24:39] of Endor and he the Samuel appeared to
[1:24:42] him in the robes of a prophet and and
[1:24:45] and and told him exactly what would
[1:24:47] happen. Right.
[1:24:48] and he had already been gone, but he was
[1:24:50] still a prophet. See, so he says, see,
[1:24:53] uh uh there's a gift of prophecy that
[1:24:55] could be on any person in here tonight
[1:24:57] and maybe never on them again. That just
[1:24:59] comes and goes. There's quite a
[1:25:00] difference between a spirit of prophecy
[1:25:02] and a prophet. A spirit of prophecy is
[1:25:05] to be judged by two or three that has
[1:25:07] discernment before it could ever be
[1:25:09] given to the church. Ain't that right?
[1:25:12] See, he said, "But when the old prophets
[1:25:15] stood, Isaiah and Jeremiah, they had
[1:25:17] thus said the Lord, they were born from
[1:25:20] cradle up." See, they were prophets,
[1:25:23] born prophets. Ain't that right? So
[1:25:25] then, if a prophecy does not come to
[1:25:27] pass, what does the prophet say that
[1:25:30] person is to do? He's supposed to
[1:25:33] repent. Get get he said he's got a line
[1:25:36] spirit on him is what he's got. See, and
[1:25:39] so he's got to pray that thing off of
[1:25:40] him, right? So then a prophecy can be
[1:25:44] true and it can be wrong. So you never
[1:25:48] accept a prophecy as the word of God
[1:25:51] until it's proven thus.
[1:25:54] But a prophet is never wrong when he
[1:25:58] speaks thus sayith the Lord. Therefore
[1:26:00] we just accept it as the word of God.
[1:26:05] Can you say amen?
[1:26:07] So, so we don't want to be confused as
[1:26:09] to who has the word of the Lord today
[1:26:11] and who doesn't. Amen. And that's that's
[1:26:14] one beauty I think uh that uh uh
[1:26:17] privilege that us ministers have is we
[1:26:20] don't have to come up with our own
[1:26:22] revelations. We don't have to come up
[1:26:24] with something fan fang dangle thing to
[1:26:27] keep the congregation. You just preach
[1:26:29] the message. I have I'm not embarrassed
[1:26:32] to quote quotes. I'm not embarrassed to
[1:26:34] to say what brother Brandham said. Why?
[1:26:36] Amen. Because it's the word of God. And
[1:26:39] I know that word has the power to do
[1:26:42] whatever you have need of. God would
[1:26:44] have sent a prophesier if that's what
[1:26:47] need we need it. But God sent a prophet
[1:26:51] cuz the word comes to a prophet.
[1:26:54] Can you say amen? So we don't want to be
[1:26:57] children and be
[1:27:00] confused
[1:27:01] on who has the word of the Lord. Stay
[1:27:05] with what the prophet taught.
[1:27:07] Stay with thus sayith the Lord and you
[1:27:09] will have thus sayith the Lord. Can you
[1:27:12] say amen? Well, I'm sick. I just need
[1:27:14] someone to prophesy over me. No, you
[1:27:16] don't.
[1:27:17] Come on, church.
[1:27:19] You've already got thus, sayith the
[1:27:21] Lord.
[1:27:22] If you can receive thus, sayith the
[1:27:25] Lord, it's already there. He sent his
[1:27:29] word to heal. Amen. Can you say amen? I
[1:27:32] believe we don't need a prophet to let
[1:27:34] us know that we're in the last days or a
[1:27:36] prophesier. We don't need someone to
[1:27:38] prophesy that we're in the last days. We
[1:27:39] don't need someone to prophesy that the
[1:27:41] Lord is coming. It's already been opened
[1:27:44] up to us by thus sayith the Lord.
[1:27:47] You understand? So healing is a
[1:27:50] restoration of
[1:27:52] health. It's it's healing of the body,
[1:27:55] restoration of the body. It's a
[1:27:56] restoration. Healing of the soul, the
[1:27:58] prophet talked healing of the mind. It's
[1:28:01] it's a restoration. And so God sent his
[1:28:04] word to bring healing or to bring
[1:28:06] restoration. So to think of it, you
[1:28:10] know, God would send his word. Why would
[1:28:13] God send his word today? A prophet in
[1:28:16] this age. We we hit on it and but I want
[1:28:19] to read to you Malachi 4:2.
[1:28:24] But unto you that fear my name, shall
[1:28:26] the son of righteousness
[1:28:29] arise with healing in his wings, and you
[1:28:33] shall go forth and grow up as calves of
[1:28:36] the stall. So God would send his word to
[1:28:39] bring
[1:28:40] healing. Ain't that right?
[1:28:44] Healing. But notice, brother Brandon
[1:28:46] says the healing part there will not be
[1:28:49] a physical healing as you think
[1:28:53] as somebody's got saying somebody's got
[1:28:56] a sickness and it'll be taken away from
[1:28:58] them. Now, we believe God's already
[1:29:00] proven that he does heal the sick. He
[1:29:03] does save the lost. He heals the soul.
[1:29:06] But now there is another healing. And
[1:29:09] the son of righteousness rises with
[1:29:11] healing in his wings. See? And so he
[1:29:15] says, see that's what he's doing now in
[1:29:19] type healing sickness, physical
[1:29:21] sickness, you know, and these things.
[1:29:23] But he says, but the whole creature will
[1:29:26] be changed.
[1:29:29] Rise with healing in his way. He's
[1:29:31] bringing a change.
[1:29:35] Oh my. This mortal will take on
[1:29:38] immortality. This old age will jump into
[1:29:41] youth.
[1:29:43] Well, how will it be? I don't know,
[1:29:47] but it'll be there.
[1:29:50] And I say it's happening. I I believe
[1:29:52] we're on the verge of this, church. I
[1:29:55] just believe that. I I I just believe
[1:29:57] that this will be our last last year of
[1:30:00] living as mortals on this earth. I just
[1:30:02] believe it. Which and the prophet said
[1:30:04] we should always live every day like the
[1:30:06] Lord's coming any moment. And I just
[1:30:08] believe that we're so close to the
[1:30:10] coming of the Lord. It it it just there
[1:30:13] can't be much time left. The cup of
[1:30:15] iniquity is overflowing in my opinion.
[1:30:18] You you understand what I'm saying? It
[1:30:19] it's so bad. Even the prophet years ago
[1:30:22] said we're what is it 3 minutes till
[1:30:24] midnight or something like that. And I I
[1:30:26] just believe we're just a second or
[1:30:28] whatever away from midnight these this
[1:30:30] day. But but but what so so here we are.
[1:30:33] He sent his word to bring healing. Amen.
[1:30:39] Oh, church, we ought to be excited.
[1:30:43] Your believing is not in vain. Your
[1:30:45] living is not in vain.
[1:30:48] Your confession is not in vain. Now, if
[1:30:51] we can confess that I'm saved, how many
[1:30:53] believes you're saved? Now, you know
[1:30:55] you're doing that by faith, right? You
[1:30:58] know you're doing that by faith. I
[1:31:01] believe I'm saved. Why do you believe
[1:31:02] that? Because you accepted God on the
[1:31:04] basis of his word.
[1:31:06] Amen. So now we do that with the same as
[1:31:08] as faith. We the same as salvation. We
[1:31:11] do that with healing. I believe I'm
[1:31:12] healed. How many believes you're healed?
[1:31:14] You just believe you're healed. Well,
[1:31:16] what are you doing? You're confessing it
[1:31:17] on the same basis of the word of God. I
[1:31:19] believe I'm healed. I just believe that.
[1:31:22] Well, yeah, but you got this and you got
[1:31:23] that. That does not matter. I'm taking
[1:31:25] God at his word. Ain't that right? Just
[1:31:27] like you do with salvation. Amen. You
[1:31:29] say, "Well, you got mistakes. You got
[1:31:30] this. You got that." But that does not
[1:31:32] matter. I'm taking it upon the basis of
[1:31:34] God's word. That's my defense.
[1:31:39] Hello. That's right. Amen. Well, we we
[1:31:42] do that with with with healing of our
[1:31:44] body, deliverance or whatever. But now
[1:31:46] we've taken it a step further. I will be
[1:31:48] in a rapture. I'm going in a rapture.
[1:31:51] I'm going in a rapture. Why? It's the
[1:31:53] same faith that says I that I use to to
[1:31:56] base my salvation upon. The same faith
[1:31:58] that I'm using to base my healing, my
[1:32:00] deliverance on anything. I'm basing my
[1:32:02] faith upon God's word. Well, I'm taking
[1:32:04] it that he is my healer. Not only for my
[1:32:08] soul, not only for this old physical
[1:32:10] body, but he's the changing of this
[1:32:12] body. Healing for the change of this
[1:32:15] body. He sent his word that I might be
[1:32:18] changed in this age. He sent his word
[1:32:22] that I don't have to grow old. Amen. But
[1:32:25] I can be changed. The gray hair will be
[1:32:28] turned back. This old body will be
[1:32:30] turned back to its youth again. And no
[1:32:32] more pain, no more aches, no more
[1:32:34] sorrow. He sent his word in this age to
[1:32:38] bring a healing.
[1:32:40] That's right. Hallelujah.
[1:32:43] Lay hold to this gospel. Lay hold to
[1:32:46] this word for it's the changing.
[1:32:49] It's come to change you. If you
[1:32:52] musicians will come. You love him.
[1:32:56] Hallelujah.
[1:32:57] I didn't have a button.
[1:33:03] All right.
[1:33:05] Amen.
[1:33:06] I love the Lord.
[1:33:12] Amen. The uh changing of our body,
[1:33:19] church. What how what more blessed could
[1:33:22] we be? Amen. that God would send a
[1:33:26] prophet in this age.
[1:33:29] I hope I don't wear that out of the
[1:33:31] blessedness of what God has done in this
[1:33:34] age for us.
[1:33:37] That God sent a prophet for you. God
[1:33:40] sent a prophet for me. And the devil
[1:33:42] fights us on these
[1:33:44] things. He He tries to get us
[1:33:47] discouraged. He's tried to get us
[1:33:48] whatever. But see, if we could just take
[1:33:50] that word, simple. take that word and
[1:33:53] just hold it to our hearts and say,
[1:33:56] "God, I'm not looking to the left. I'm
[1:33:58] not looking to the right. I'm not
[1:33:59] looking at all the things that are going
[1:34:01] on. I'm not looking at the
[1:34:04] adversary as though he's got triumph
[1:34:08] over me, but I'm looking to your
[1:34:12] word." And God gave the word to heal us
[1:34:15] of all of our diseases. Amen. Aren't you
[1:34:18] glad for that? Amen.
[1:34:21] That way you can just simply rest
[1:34:24] to take every day one day at a time. God
[1:34:26] I thank you. I thank you. You remember
[1:34:29] the prophet even the prophet himself
[1:34:31] brother Brandham had to go through it
[1:34:34] and confessing remember he had something
[1:34:36] wrong in his stomach. I don't know what
[1:34:37] it was. Can't remember you might know
[1:34:40] but he had something in his stomach that
[1:34:42] he could not eat beans. He could not eat
[1:34:44] onion. Right. Right. He couldn't eat
[1:34:46] them stuff. The doctor said, "You eat
[1:34:49] it, it'll kill
[1:34:50] you." Said, "Stay away from all that
[1:34:52] stuff. It'll kill you." That's right.
[1:34:55] Brother Brham just being a new
[1:34:56] Christian. And then it wasn't because he
[1:34:58] was a new Christian. He just simply
[1:35:01] believed. He sat down. He was craving
[1:35:04] beans and corn or yeah, beans,
[1:35:06] cornbread, and onion. Whatever he was
[1:35:08] craving, told his mom to fix it. And she
[1:35:10] said, "Oh, Billy, you know, you know, if
[1:35:11] you eat that, it going to kill you. You
[1:35:13] know what that doctor said?" He said,
[1:35:14] "Fix it." Yeah. And he couldn't keep
[1:35:18] nothing up. And so he took a bite and
[1:35:22] started to come up and he swallowed it
[1:35:23] down. Come up. He swallowed it down.
[1:35:26] Come up and swallowed it down. And I
[1:35:28] think a lot of times sometimes he lost
[1:35:31] it. That he'd go around, "Thank God I'm
[1:35:34] healed. Thank God I'm healed." Go down
[1:35:37] the street and people say, "Oh, you're
[1:35:38] looking bad, Billy. Oh, but the Lord's
[1:35:40] healed me. The Lord's healed me."
[1:35:43] And there he was, sick as a
[1:35:46] dog. But one day, and I don't know when
[1:35:50] it was, but he had his mom to fix it,
[1:35:52] and he ate
[1:35:54] it. And instead of it coming back up, it
[1:35:57] stayed
[1:35:58] down. And God had honored his
[1:36:01] word. God honored it. So don't be afraid
[1:36:04] to take God at his
[1:36:05] word. That's the seed of Abraham. We
[1:36:08] just simply take God at his word. I just
[1:36:11] believe it. I just believe it. Can you
[1:36:13] say amen? Oh my, I love him. Amen. Oh,
[1:36:19] you are the
[1:36:21] God that healeth
[1:36:25] me. You are the
[1:36:28] Lord, my
[1:36:33] healer. You sent your
[1:36:36] word and healed my disease.
[1:36:42] You are the
[1:36:43] Lord, my
[1:36:46] healer. Sing it again. You are the
[1:36:52] God that healeth
[1:36:56] me. You are the
[1:36:58] Lord, my
[1:37:03] healer. You sent your
[1:37:06] word and healed my disease.
[1:37:12] You are the
[1:37:13] Lord, my
[1:37:18] healer. Oh, you are the God that
[1:37:21] delivers, that delivers
[1:37:25] me. You are the Lord, my
[1:37:32] deliverer. You sent your
[1:37:36] word and healed my disease.
[1:37:41] You are the Lord my
[1:37:47] deliverer. Oh, you are the
[1:37:51] God that healeth
[1:37:55] me. You are the Lord my
[1:37:59] healer. Aren't you glad for
[1:38:02] that? You sent your word.
[1:38:06] That word comes as a revelation, a
[1:38:08] personal revelation to
[1:38:11] us.
[1:38:13] Hallelujah. That's what the Bible says.
[1:38:15] Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[1:38:18] the word of God. That's what's so
[1:38:20] important to preach the word. Preach
[1:38:22] this message. There is no other word
[1:38:24] that has been given in this age other
[1:38:26] than what a prophet gave to us.
[1:38:29] Hallelujah. Preach the message. Believe
[1:38:32] the message. Live the message. Let that
[1:38:35] message be received in your heart by
[1:38:37] faith. Hallelujah. You don't have to
[1:38:39] question. You don't have to wonder. You
[1:38:41] don't have to worry. You don't have to
[1:38:43] dissect it. Just just simply believe it.
[1:38:47] I think that's the challenge that we all
[1:38:49] have is just simply believing the word.
[1:38:52] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God bless you is
[1:38:56] our prayer. Can we just stand to our
[1:38:58] feet? Maybe just lift your hands unto
[1:39:00] the Lord
[1:39:01] and Hallelujah.
[1:39:04] Thank him. You can't thank him enough
[1:39:07] for what he's done for us in this
[1:39:09] age.
[1:39:11] Hallelujah.
[1:39:13] Oh, you are the
[1:39:16] God that healeth
[1:39:20] me. You are the Lord, my healer.
[1:39:28] You sent your
[1:39:30] word and healed my
[1:39:34] disease. You are the Lord, my
[1:39:41] healer. Oh, you are the
[1:39:45] God that healeth
[1:39:49] me. You are the
[1:39:51] Lord, my healer.

[1:40:31] disease. You are the Lord, my healer.

[1:40:38] lines. You sent your
[1:40:41] word and healed my
[1:40:46] disease. You are the Lord, my healer.
[1:40:55] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Blessed
[1:40:57] be his
[1:40:59] name.

[1:43:09] I love him
[1:43:13] He's so
[1:43:15] good to
[1:43:20] me. Oh
[1:43:23] God, he's so
[1:43:27] good. as we had uh announced um and you
[1:43:31] can just continue to play but um the
[1:43:34] Lord willing it all depends I guess if
[1:43:37] my visa comes through but uh I'm to be
[1:43:41] headed to Africa uh Wednesday
[1:43:45] uh flying out Wednesday morning and um
[1:43:49] I'll be flying
[1:43:51] uh here to Detroit meeting brother
[1:43:55] Andrew Glover and then from there would
[1:43:58] be flying to
[1:43:59] Africa. And um so brother Amos asked
[1:44:04] maybe to pray and I would really
[1:44:07] appreciate
[1:44:09] that if the church could pray for me and
[1:44:12] maybe brother Terry and brother Josiah
[1:44:15] and the ministers, brother Amos could
[1:44:18] come. And um you know I I really covet
[1:44:21] your prayers. I am um I'm nervous really
[1:44:25] nervous. uh getting in a plane, going to
[1:44:29] another country, and uh then preaching
[1:44:32] on top of that. So, uh but I do covet
[1:44:35] your prayers cuz I certainly want to be
[1:44:36] a help. And I've just, you know, it was
[1:44:39] kind of a fast decision.
[1:44:41] Um I I had gotten a call Wednesday or
[1:44:45] Tuesday night asking if I would be
[1:44:48] willing to go. They needed to know like
[1:44:51] right then so we could start processing
[1:44:54] everything. And so I've just left it in
[1:44:56] the Lord's hands. Uh if my visa comes
[1:45:00] through, the ticket's already been
[1:45:02] bought. It's it's a couple thousand
[1:45:04] dollars just for the ticket. And the uh
[1:45:07] brother has paid for that and uh so a
[1:45:11] lot of things, you know, just pressure
[1:45:13] right now. Now we got the snow coming in
[1:45:16] and
[1:45:17] uh you know just a lot of pressure that
[1:45:20] I just like uh and uh but I do want to
[1:45:23] help the people if God wills this for me
[1:45:26] to come. But anyway, I appreciate the
[1:45:28] prayers. I'll be coming back Lord
[1:45:30] willing Monday night. So it's a fast
[1:45:34] trip. Yeah.
