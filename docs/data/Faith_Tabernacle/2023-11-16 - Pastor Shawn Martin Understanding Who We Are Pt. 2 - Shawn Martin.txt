pastor to come let your word be born in the manger of my heart is that your desire this evening for him to have his way in you it was a tiny simple stable all beaten and warm hardly a place for a king to be born he it choose some place special to reveal his majesty so I know if I'll give him control he'll be mourning me let your word be born in the manger of my heart let it live in me let it St live inside this house of clay and mold it every day oh let your word be born in the Mainer of my heart oh outwardly I'm nothing not much to behold unlikely the place for his word to unfold but if I'll just yield this vessel and let him have his way from Glory onto Glory he'll change me day by day let your word be warn in the main of my [Music] [Music] heart day let your word be born in the Mainer of my heart sing it once again oh let your word be born in the manger of my heart let it live in me let it St live inside this house of clay well is that your prayer oh let your word be born in the manger of of my heart bless the name of the Lord amen I believe that there are some hearts that have taken on the word amen and the word is maturing amen and uh developing and we're so glad for that amen but this is the time this is the age for it amen um if you have your Bibles the the book of St John the 13th chapter and um uh just good to have everyone here um tonight and those that were gone with sickness or out of town um good to have you back and um we also want to uh remember uh Sunday night we'll be having a uh testimony service songs and testimony so um looking forward to that we always have a wonderful time and it's hard to believe that we're already Thanksgiving and right around the corner and uh we got a lot to be thankful for amen we got a lot to be thankful for and um so um I'm glad to be an American for one and I'm glad to be a Christian amen and no matter where this this uh country is going to uh seems like it's going down in a hurry but while we still got our liberties and and uh freedoms to worship amen let's take advantage of it and be thankful for it amen but uh St John the 13th chapter and uh going to read the third and fourth verse but it says Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself amen let's just bow our heads and talk to our Lord father we're just a humble group of people here father we bow our heads to the dust from which we've come and Lord we don't have much to offer we don't have anything to offer Lord in way that would edify you or to make you any more than what you are but father we just come to worship you because of who you are Lord and we're asking father that you would mold us into your image Lord and that you would have your way we recognize you to be Lord of all father Lord we ask that you'd be Lord Of Our Lives take complete preeminence father in this service and may the word have its effect in US Lord and may we leave here better than we came in Father we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen you can have your seats this evening and um I'm going to continue on the thought that we spoke on um last Wednesday of understanding who we are and um I tell you it's it's a a real honor to be part of the Bride of Jesus Christ and uh we must not take that for granted and and more than anything um I pray that God gives us a greater understanding and uh as to who we are but as I mentioned uh last Wednesday that being being his body is more precious to us than even Walking With Jesus of uh back when he was on the earth 2,000 years ago John laid his head on his chest Jesus's chest and and what a privilege that must have been to be able to sit with him and rub shoulders with him eat with him but we are more privileged than that uh the disciples touched him talked with him heard his voice but we are more privileged even than that for we are the body of Jesus Christ and so our hands is his hands our voice is his voice our body is his body and according to Matthew 25 there will actually be people that will obtain eternal life uh simply by being good to the bride of Christ which is his body amen and and we we know it um but uh Jesus uh here talked to them there in Matthew 25:34 and said Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for I was hungered you gave me meat I was thirsty you gave me drink I was a stranger you took me in naked you clothed me I was sick you visited me I was in prison and you came to me and then they will answer Lord when did we see you these this way when did we and he said when you've done it unto the least of these my brethren you did it unto me and so and then and then of course uh there will be those that'll be cast out out into outer Darkness simply by not being good to the bride uh for here he he said you know um uh he said verily I say unto you in as much as you have done it unto the least of these my brethren you have done unto me then he shall say unto them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed into eternal life or everlasting life uh prepared for the devil and his angels for when I was hungry you gave me no meat I was thirsty you gave me no drink I was a stranger you took me not in naked and you clothed me not sick and in prison and you visited me not and so he said when did we not do these things and when did we see you and and he says verily I say unto you in as much as you did it not unto the least of these you did it not unto me so then we we see that being a part of the body is is is very a uh and and any of the Bride that that was not speaking of the bride at all as far as their what they had done and what they had attained amen but these were people that had been good to the the bride and and they had actually done it unconsciously they brother brand said they just it came from their heart they automatically did it and didn't even realize what they were doing and so but you you can see why it is important to have a clear understanding uh uh who we are and you know we need to have the same understanding that Jesus and John had in their day and not only did they have a clear understanding of who each other were but they had a clear understanding of who they were amen and uh uh and their understanding came from the scriptures um there in John 1:2 2 2 uh John the Baptist was asked who art thou that we may give an answer to them that sent us what sayest thou of thyself and he said I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the way of the Lord as said the prophet Isaiah amen Isaiah and and so John uh he he could take his ministry take what he was and what he was doing and he could found it upon the scriptures and um he he had a clear understanding of what he was and who he was and what his ministry was about and our opening scriptures tells us that Jesus knew who he was and uh to me uh that that just that thought and how that he could take a towel and G himself and bow and kneel and wor the feet of his disciples it's it's incredible and how he could do that is because he knew who he was he didn't have to prove nothing he didn't have to uh be all high and mighty there was no competition with him uh to see who gets the first spot and who gets this and this and no no he already knew who he was and because of that then he could take on the heart of a servant amen and so uh but Jesus knowing who he was uh in in John 2:19 he bodly States destroy this Temple and within three days I will raise it up and he and he bases that statement off of what the prophet uh uh said there in psalm 16 and 10 for thou wil not leave my soul in Hell neither wil thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption well see it it doesn't say Jesus it doesn't say Jesus Christ Jesus of Nazareth or it Jesus's name wasn't physically literally in that scripture but Jesus had the revelation of that scripture and he knew who it was talking about he knew it was about him and so therefore uh uh he knew he knew based on that scripture and based on the Revelation that he had and the the personal revelation of it that he would not see corruption amen and and so even though he would die and so but Jesus had the clear understanding that he was the Messiah and and that the scripture spoke of him he was the word as the uh John uh 1 and 1 says uh and 14 and that word became flesh and so uh uh he was on Earth to fulfill every scripture that was spoke of the Messiah and and yet he did not fulfill them blindly he he didn't come to the end of his life and the end of his Earthly Journey amen and say now I hope I fulfilled everything and and you know fingers crossed and and let let's hope we did it all but no he he he knew that he was to fulfill the scriptures and he did them uh knowingly he he did them and and so um uh in other words he didn't fulfill Promises of the scriptures uh uh as though he didn't know who he was and didn't know what his ministry was about and what he was to fulfill he knew what he was to fulfill he he knew who he was he knew the ministry that he had and so his purpose was to fulfill the ministry that God had called him to do ain't that right notice how he prays in in John 17:22 and breaking in in he says the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one I am them and thou and me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved me as as thou or has loved them as thou H has loved me amen and and notice this prayer was not a a qu uh there was not this prayer was not a question uh it didn't end with the question mark it was actually a matter of fact statement you you understand the glory thing of that now he truly believed that the one one who who who gave him the glory was the father he believed that he and the father were one he believed he knew with all of his heart that the father was in him he believed that the father loved him and so uh uh uh and and and so his prayer is not about Lord would you would you make sure would you assure me of your presence would you assure me that that we are one uh uh would you help my confidence in in my you know that that you love me no it was now he's praying for someone else he's praying for for the elect father make them one as you and I are one give the glory that you have given me I have given them he knew what he was given us it was the glory that the father had given him and and and so um uh you know brother brandham talked about the faith of Jas and who was a Jew and he talked about the faith of that Centurion who was a gentile and and and of course the the Jew had the had Faith uh enough to to believe in Jesus that if he would come and and lay hands lay his hands on uh his daughter she would be well the Centurion had a greater faith and and he believed that if Jesus would just speak the word uh then his servant would live and and so these men both men recognize Jesus to be the Son of God they they recognized that he had some type of authority and uh and and believe that that he had the uh Power to heal and and to raise the dead there there were many others as well that that Express faith in in Jesus uh the woman with the issue of blood she said within herself if I can just but touch his clothes I know I I'll be made whole the two men uh expressed uh BL men expressed their faith in him uh even when Jesus turned and walked away from them they followed him in the house and and and and they made their appeal to him and and the Bible says that Jesus says that great is thy faith and and and and and they they were healed another woman expressed her faith in Jesus by coming to him and asking for him to heal her daughter that was grievously vexed uh uh with the devil and even though Jesus called her a dog yet she would not leave because she recognized that Jesus had something that she needed and and if he would just uh uh uh Grant her request uh everything would be all right so their faith all of these their faith was in in Jesus Christ uh a man came to Jesus asking him to deliver his son who was possessed with an epileptic Spirit as as we all know and and and then you find in Luke 6:17 it says that many came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases and they that were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed and and the whole multitude sought to touch him for there went virtue out of him and healed them all ain't that right so by their faith in him they received what they had need of amen and yet many of them didn't understand the scriptures um many of them probably didn't even understand who he was per se as being the Son of God it's just like today a lot of people didn't recognize brother Brandon's Ministry and and and yet they had enough faith that if he would pray amen I would you know they would get healed or uh or this or that but they didn't really understand the scriptures about his ministry and and even he was having healing campaigns and all that and really didn't understand it it was later on in his ministry that he understood that he was the prophet of Malachi 4 and and these things but see uh uh but but they had faith in Jesus uh uh no doubt well the Bible says his Fame grew and and so uh um uh brother brandham says that some no doubt had an intellectual Faith uh about him and and and these things and they they had heard stories and whatever like blind Bas probably heard stor stories of of of Jesus and and and what he was doing and then he hears that Jesus is passing his way and and his faith uh uh knowing that Jesus if Jesus could just uh uh touch him or or Grant his request he'd be he'd be healed and so his faith amen uh uh uh stopped Jesus in his tracks amen and these things but what about the faith that Jesus had amen you you see uh uh he wouldn't have laid hands uh on ji's daughter if he didn't have faith uh that it would help am man he he wouldn't have uh spoke the word to this uh Centurion about his servant if he didn't believe that his words had power amen he he wouldn't have went to the grave of Lazarus who had been dead already for days if if he did not believe that when that stone was rode away and he would command Lazarus to come forth he would come out of the ground if Jesus didn't believe that that would happen he he wouldn't have went to the Grave it's like a lot of us today amen if there's a little bit of doubt in in our lives then then we won't ask and you know and and and we won't we wouldn't come up for prayer we wouldn't do this we wouldn't do that it takes Faith to do all of that it takes Faith to preach the gospel it takes Faith to believe in this message it takes Faith Amen to Proclaim that God has healed me before you ever get the Sy get evidence of it it it takes Faith amen so just as much as it takes Faith to declare I've been healed well well so your fever broke well no uh uh well how can you say that you're healed well I believe that God healed me amen well you wouldn't do that you would think every like every the unbeliever you would think that was stupid to say that oh they're going to make fun of me oh that's just on nonsense we got to think of reality here but no if you really got faith in what the word says amen the Bible says by stripes we were healed it's already done it's a finished work amen but it takes faith that to Proclaim that I'm Healed regardless of what the devil says what everything says I am healed ain't that right so so Jesus had to have faith in order to do his his uh his ministry he had to have faith in order to set the captive free he had to have faith when that woman was there uh when they were going to Stone uh that lady uh for adultery and things and and and there they they had their rocks and all of that and and and he says he that without the sin cast the first stone remember that amen and then uh uh he he looked at her and and after they had left and it says Where Art Thou accusers and she says I have none he says well neither do I condemn thee go thy way and sin no more he knew that that these words had power to release her amen as as much as the woman that that was there that washed his feet and and these things and and he says thy sins which are many are forgiven thee he had to have faith in in in who he was Amen to say them kind of words can you say Amen so his faith amen was not in a church it wasn't in a man it wasn't in something else his faith was on a different level everyone else's Faith was in him as he was walking on the earth and and and and performing The Miracles and all of these things but his faith he had perfect Faith amen he had perfect faith and his faith came from understanding who he was can you say amen amen his faith came from understanding so so his faith was the faith of God a man he had the same Faith uh that God had when when God said let there be light there was no light never had been light amen and and and the Earth was dark and darkness covered the Earth and and and all of these things but God wanted light God wanted to to transform the world and he would transform it through the power of light and and so he stands there and he says let there be light and the prophet said it took faith for God to do that but where was God's faith going to be at amen there there was nothing that he could put his faith in there was no church that he could put his faith in there ain't a bishop he could put his faith in he certainly couldn't put his faith in in man even if man was there at that time there was nothing there but God had faith and his faith was in his own word ain't that right and by faith the worlds were framed by faith God spoke his creative word and it was Soul amen the prophet said the dirt that you set over uh tonight that's God's word God just said let there be and his word materialize well where did he get the dirt if it wasn't there see amen see if it didn't materialize where did he get it he just spoke it it's God's materialized word form the Earth that you set on ain't that right oh I wonderful how past finding out it's by faith everybody say it's by faith it's by faith that we believe him believe him God believed his own word and it formed the world God believed his own word ain't that right see it was a perfect Faith Amen brother brand said it's the super sense amen uh that Jesus had and that God had it was by super sense that the world was formed amen and so Jesus had that kind of Faith he had the same kind of Faith see amen because his faith was in the word word of God can you say amen amen not in some man not in some Ministry not in some whatever it was in the word of God Amen see so brother bradam said a Believer is he said is the faith of God that moves in you amen that's what a True Believer is is the faith of God moving in in in the man amen so where did Jesus get his faith at then amen uh other were inspired by Jesus's Ministry and their faith was inspired by by what he done and what he said and and and these things but Jesus amen his faith amen well the Bible says that God was in Christ everybody say God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself see God was in Christ amen the same God that that uh uh that spoke amen that stood on the invisible plat form amen and by Faith said let there be and it was was now living in a body amen for Jesus Christ was the human body that God lived in and I I say it this way God wasn't manifesting himself in that Jew he was not manifesting himself in that Gentile he wasn't manifesting himself in those who came to Jesus for help amen their faith was in Jesus Christ can you say Amen but God in Christ God in Christ recognized his own word that he spoke through the prophets and believed it ain't that right God Amen God in Christ amen now the prophet said God forsaw the bride in the groom Amen to save his wife like Adam he had to go with her Adam know what he was doing Eve didn't know what she was doing but Adam walked out with his wife and Jesus took his wife's place and became sin for her remember he became you he stood your punishment that you might stand at his place he stood in your place that you might stand in his place what a place to stand in tonight you're not standing in J's place you're not standing in that centurion's place you are standing in his place in the place of Jesus Christ you're not standing in blind bz's uh place you are standing in the very place of Jesus Christ amen see Jesus the word became me that I a sinner might become him the word amen so at Calvary he died as a man and yet you know we know that he didn't have to do it but the prophet said he went there with you in him ain't that right he went with you there with you in him God had never separated the bride from the groom yet so when God looked down upon the body of Christ he saw both male and female and it was all redeemed in that one body they are one the same word spoke of the groom it's now speaks of the Bride Can you say Amen the same word that spoke of the groom amen the word Jesus Christ now speaks of the uh the the the bride which is the word as well ain't that right amen so the prophet says how can the Bride come and fail to manifest everything that was promised of her ain't that right how could Jesus come being God being the Redeemer being the Messiah and not fulfill every scripture pertaining to the Messiah what a Ministry what a faith he must have had Amen to fulfill every scripture and know that he was ordained to fulfill it ain't that right amen you couldn't move him from it Satan tried to do it and he found out he he he met someone greater than a than Solomon make greater than Noah make greater than Moses make greater than David this man was the word it was God in flesh can you say Amen well it's in this age too this is why amen you'll never be deceived because you're part of him you'll never be deceived he's been able to Amen to deceive many down Through the Ages and and his deception is the greatest of all ages in this age but there is a bride that has been ordained amen just as the groom so is the bride going to fulfill everything that has been promised of her now he the groom fulfilled everything in his physical body that was spoken of him ain't that right then wouldn't he fulfill all that was spoken of him living in his bride's body his bride hello it's not your ministry it's not your your acts anyways it's God you're just the body the same God that was in Christ is the same God that's in this bride and and and he he and as as he wrote the script out for the groom and and and then he came down and fulfilled it in that body in that single body that physical body so as he wrote out a script for this bride body that he would come and live in her and fulfill the script can you sayen so amen uh uh then then he's got to fulfill everything that was spoken of him in the bride body amen see so brother Brown said he did everything even to proven it by raising himself up from the dead afterwards then don't the bride have to do the same thing have to be exactly what the word said she would be in this last days now notice what the prophet said now he asked the question but he's he's it's really he's really letting us know she has to return by Malachi 4 can you say Amen she has to return through Malachi 4 amen so this is why the message of the hour is so important and and how do we know what is Malachi for how do we know who is really the Elijah well God's had his picture taken with him so you would know can you say man that ain't that ain't a picture that's just something insignificant to this bride that is very important to us that we would know who we are to listen to and to follow can you say amen that's exactly ly right so Jesus the prophet said now Jesus relied upon what he was ain't that right he relied in knowing that he was the word he had faith in God who made him the word now I'm going to say that again Jesus relied upon what he was that's right he didn't rely upon everybody applauding him amen because there's a lot of times in his ministry they didn't applaud him amen he didn't rely upon him uh uh staying with him amen and and and and and that's where his faith was because there was many times that they walked away from him amen but he relied upon what he was amen and he had Faith watch he had faith in God who made him the word see he relied in knowing that he was the word he was God the word and they was in him and that give him Faith because he understood his position praise God hello come on now he understood his position you're going to have rainy days you're going to have sunny days come on now you're going to have good times you're going to have bad times you're going to have times that you feel like you're on the mountain and then other time you're going to feel like you're already close to hell you're going to have times that it just seem like God is carrying you and God's wrapped his arms around you and there's going to be other times you're going to think that God's A Million Miles Away ain't that right and I I have to tell you I believe that Jesus experienced every one of these things I believe he I I I believe that he his he he he still had the five senses of the of the flesh he had the five senses of the spirit he was a man and he went through ups and downs and and all of these things but it never detoured him because his faith was not based upon uh what people said about him his faith wasn't based upon how people treated him his faith wasn't based on anything his faith was based because he understood his position he understood who he was can you say Amen now notice how did he know who he was well the prophet said he know what he was because the scripture had said he was this can you say Amen the scripture said it amen sure there was a lot of people say well th there well look at Peter let's just take Peter for example amen now he already knew who he was Jesus knew who he was so when he asked him well who do men say that I am he was not looking for approval he was not looking for somebody to to to help him boost his faith up he just wanted to know who people what people are saying about him well some say this some say that well who do you say that I am and Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God did that M did that boost Jesus's Faith even more absolutely not I don't not I do I don't believe that amen because look what Peter done later on he denied him but Jesus knew he was the son of God anyways can you say amen that's what keeps Believers keep pressing on yes sir you just press on regardless of what comes what goes what who does this who does that just keep pressing on one of these days it's all going to come out at the end of the wash anyways but if you know who you are based on what the word says you can go regardless of whatever else happens in your life amen he know what it was because the scripture had said he was this and here every scripture tied in to prove that he was exactly what the scripture said he would be and he knew what he was therefore he relied upon what God made him amen now if he did that then can't we rely upon what God made us as Believers think about notice that now if we're in his is shoes if we're taking his place you cannot have the faith of J you can't have the faith of of others you've got to have the faith that Jesus had perfect Faith amen amen can you say amen and that Faith relies upon the word ain't that right surely it it relies upon the word right praise the Lord yes sir these signs shall follow them that believe he he had faith in what he was and if you are a Believer you have faith in what you are for you are a Believer amen ain't that right amen now Jesus said as the father have sent me so send I you yes sir and I like what brother brand said how did the father send him by going with him and being in him amen so the same God that was in Christ is in the church amen you believe it amen then when the bride is being called out now notice how the brother Braham says this when the bride is being called out how are you going to put it out how are you going to put out this bride Revival can't do it can't do it how are you going to how are you going to Stomp The Bride out can't do it can you say Amen notice what brother Brown said this calling out of the Bride it's the revelation of the manifestation of the word made True say that again it's the revelation of the manifestation of the word made True see everything about this bride the ministry of this bride everything about this bride is right in scriptures can you say Amen this bride is not a hypocrite bride getting out there and sinning all that then coming to church acting like a like like some little angel that ain't happening and there's a lot of Hypocrites in churches yeah even in the message can you say Amen but we ain't talking about all that you have to look over all that hypocrisy and look what the Bible says that we are can you say Amen see it's the revelation of the manifestation of the word made true that's what your life is is the revelation of the manifestation of the word may true and we're living in that day praise be to God the revelation of the mystery of himself amen God revealing himself where in his bride and it lines up with the word of God and this is what this fulfills what Jesus said at that day you shall know that I'm in my father I in you and you in me yeah you in me and I in you ain't that right that's what it fulfills why this is the Revelation amen of God's see so brother BR says now the very God that wrote the word is in the man saying that's the truth ain't that right the very God that wrote the word is in the man saying that's the truth I don't care what anybody says that's the truth there it is God in the man recognizes his own word God in the man recognizes his own work that's good now you think of that how blind we would be brother Amos right there's so many intellectual people that take this Bible and really think they got knowledge of it but they're so far off how many commentators made by men that have spent their life searching through this Bible amen and and and yet didn't come to any conclusion of Truth I mean they had some truth yeah but not not the where it's brought the bride to a rapturing faith but then God would come in this age in his bride and recognize the truth it isn't us that's doing it it's God in us God in the man recognizes his own Word Church we're not just professing church church members we're not just here just twiddling our thumbs we are the Bride of Jesus Christ his body yes sir true can you say Amen yes sir his body Luke 17:30 means a lot to us because it's a prophecy of this day and I this is just my thoughts uh from what I see and that is you know because it talks about the revealing of the son man I believe we're still in that revealing of the son of man I believe we're in the days of the son of manise the Lord one one had told me said well we've been taught that that and it wasn't here it was in another state but so we've been taught that when brother brandham died we went back to being the days of son of Son of God and I no no no I don't I don't see that at all right I believe that that that brother Brandon's Ministry was the revealing of the son of man introducing what Christ in the the body that that's my thoughts that's that's the way I see it and and so therefore we're still in the revealing of the son of man son of man being revealed through his body and see the only way he could be revealed is through by his very own body bride body ain't that right he's not to be revealed as Spirit he's to be revealed as son of man Spirit was Son of God ain't that right but in this day revealing as the son of man what is it God and man becoming one amen God and man becoming one the word becoming flesh true Amen brother Bram said all that spiritual union of Christ and his church now when the flesh is becoming the word and the word is becoming flesh manifested Vindicated amen just what the Bible said would happen in this day it's happening day by day everybody say day by day day by day yes sir it ain't happening all at once it's day by day day by day little by little something's taking place amen now what happens when God and man become one now notice because I think this is important and this helps us understand who we are brother Braham said God is in him when man and God become one God is in him God in the man God speaks through him he's no more his own but he's God's Voice through human lips praise the Lord Hallelujah and every believer in him tonight is likewise possessed so possessed so completely given over till his words become like the words of Christ he speaks and the word is made flesh he speaks and the word is manifested the works that I do shall you do also these sign shall follow them that believe can you say amen and God comes in you his body to make that word live Hallelujah that's right that's where we are praise the Lord Brother brandom says in another place when the word becomes flesh it is manifested that's right can you say amen amen that's right when the word becomes flesh it is manifested so what God was in Christ he is in you this then requires the bride which is the body of Christ to have the same kind of faith that he had amen if we are to be the body of Christ have the same Ministry that Christ had have the same God that was in Christ now living in US it requires the same faith that Jesus had so brother brand said see have faith in what the word says you are and Jesus had faith in the word of God that said he he was uh said what he was it is written of Me Jesus could take the scriptures and say it is written of me it is written of me it is written of me that's right well can't we not do the same amen we sure we can sure absolutely whether we we whether we're receiving accolades from men or not the word says word says what I am and it is written of me written on me see we all going to meet the challenge we're all going to face the devil we're all going to face Temptations we're all going to the devil's going to knock us flat and when I say that when I say the devil going to knock us flat I that may be a wrong statement because let's say it this way the devil's going to try to knock us flat he's going to try to knock us off our feet he's going to do everything he can to get us to quit to get us to doubt to get us to to to not necessarily to get you to leave a church quit believing in what you are that's right and what the word says can you say amen yeah now I know there there are there are guys you know they they can they can go they can mess up they can do things illegal they can they can they they can do things and it doesn't bother them about about it they just do it and then they but we're we're it really hurts Believers is because they really want to be right amen and and and then they'll slip up or they do something and then the devil's right there and and uh he he's there to to to tell them well you you flubbed up this time you've done this you've done that you've done this and he he's able to to to really try to affect him probably more than someone that is just so callous and they don't care yeah because you know a person that really wants to do right well brother Brian said the moment you see that you're wrong you're going to repent of it and and yet that ain't going to stop Satan from just constantly hounding you that's right on these things because he knows what your heart is so by faith you have to look past that all right I hope that makes sense you have to have faith in the blood you have to have faith in the word of God you have to have faith in in all of this to stand on your own two feet and say but it's under the blood Satan right it's under the blood that's right and and and this this keep doing and doing and doing and doing I think there's a power of God that'll break the habits do you just believe that I believe the power of God will break habits in a man's life amen amen and so have faith in what the word says you are that's it and Jesus had faith in the word of God that said that he was it is written of me didn't David in the Psalms and the prophets and all of them speak of him I am the bread of life Jesus said that come from God out of Heaven amen I am the tree of life that come from the Garden of Eden see I am all of these things I am that I am see he knew with that perfect faith that he was the anointed Messiah that the spirit of God was upon Him lot of statements that he would make that would Flor the people but it didn't matter he knew where he was he understood his position praise Lord he said now I in myself can do nothing but it's my faith in God and God was in him the word made manifest and when the word of God comes in you it's made manifest for you are a Believer can you say Amen the word of God comes in you it is made manifest for you are a Believer now brother brandom says in another place that super sense is God can you say Amen that super sense brother Bram talked about it's that six sense the super sense Faith sup Superior Faith that's God the faith of God in you the part of God that comes into you gives you the super sense and by that same super sense God framed the world together with things which was not and did not appear see and and so in other words it was already there like like like people invent things and think they're really great because they've invented it I think I've told you about the two scientist you know uh you know that that was talking to God about things you know and says you know we're equal to you and and and he says oh yeah you are huh he says oh yeah says we we we've invented this we've done this we've done that he said we can even create man now oh you can he said well show me so they got a handful of dirt he goes you got to go get your own dirt well man can do whatever they want to but they do things that is already visible already material that God would make things that did not appear That's the God we serve can you say amen and that was where Jesus's Faith was he didn't have to have things and so is it the faith that is today the Lord so we find by that same superent see God framed the world together with things which was not and did not appear see he spoke his word and believed his word and a world shook into existence now that super sense is the Holy Spirit the faith of God that dwells in you ain't that right now Jesus understood by the scriptures as to who he was that's where he got his understanding how would we have a understanding in the word if the lamb hadn't come and opened the book that's right amen and you say amen amen amen then he opens that book and he sends it down as the prophet said to that seventh angel to reveal it to his people if he hadn't done that we wouldn't be able to have the faith that we have today today because we've got to have understanding by the scriptures now people understood what they were their understanding of what they were came from oil coming out of their hands wrong understanding a lot of people's understanding comes by by you know uh uh uh doing it doing a jig dancing speaking in tongue prophesying come on but that Jesus already told notice that many would come in say Lord have we not cast out devils in thy name have we not prophesied in the name have we not done this in thy name and he says depart from me you workers of iniquity so our understanding doesn't come from all of that even though we believe in them things I do I believe if you're a Believer you will believe in those things but our faith isn't in that our faith is in the solid word of God can you say Amen so then you know God tells John and Daniel both to seal up the book till the end of time then it takes a prophet it took a prophet to reveal it amen that's why we hold to this prophet of Malachi 4 it's the only way we can return back to being the body of Christ and what Christ the same Ministry that Christ had is now in the church but it couldn't be without a prophet because our understanding comes from the word and the word comes to a prophet amen that's right notice the prophet says God promised in his word that he would choose his bride by his original way he chose his the bridegroom he for he forto it by the prophets and sent a prophet to identify it amen see the prophet said standing on the banks of Jordan behold they said are you the Messiah you're the Messiah aren't you he said no I'm not the Messiah you must be the Messiah no I'm not him but he he is standing among you and his shoes I'm not worthy to loosen right see when he comes makes himself known and today he's standing Among Us the Lord can you say amen amen and notice a prophet would identify where he's not at he's not in the organizations that turn him down amen hallelujah ain't that right right right he's not in all the gimmicks and impersonations but that didn't mean that he wasn't here for he's standing Among Us ain't that right notice he's standing Among Us in the person of the Holy Ghost manifesting himself more and more coming into his church making himself known because him and the bride and the groom will be the same name making himself known and one day you'll see that the one that you filled in your heart and see his identification will become personalized before you then you and he are one Hallelujah and notice what a prophet says you've United by the word can you say that with me United by the word I love it not by feelings not by sens ations not by not by your past not by this not by that you know the only thing you've unite can unite him by is by the word you've United by the word what is it you've taken his word you've believed it you've identified Yourself by the word you've identified your actions by the word you've identified everything by the word of God can you say Amen you've United by the word and the Word was in the beginning will go back to the beginning which is God and that day you'll know that I'm in the father and the father in me and I in you and you and me Hallelujah then he says we're here amen we're here we're here to that Revelation we're here where a people is really understanding that he is in them and they are in him they're understanding who they are amen he said' I'm so glad to see him personifying himself right Among Us and see what he promised for the word not what somebody's emotion singing jumping and dancing but by his word his word amen he is making himself known by his word he is making himself known do you love the Lord if the musicians will come brother brandham said said see the true word comes to the true Prophet yes amen and he tells you the true word hallelujah say that again the true word comes to the true prophet and he tells you the true word you follow that true word and you get an A true experience of the word good because the word is made flesh in you are you believing this prophet in vain absolutely not come on now are you denying the world in vain absolutely not right hello no forsaken all the things of the world absolutely not it's not in vain people leave but it's not in vain for us to stay why because the word as we believe in the word we becoming the word ain't that right we're getting a true experience of the word this ain't impersonation thing amen won't be not something made up this is a true experience of the word amen that's what a lot of folks don't understand about us getting excited they call it Pentecostalism well it is Pentecostalism it's acts 238 it's it's a day of Pentecost thing God birthed this church then am they acted drunk they acted out of their minds they they were beside themselves amen they did yes but more than just that it's already prophesied that the sons of God shatter for Joy before the foundation of the world we we there there's no way that a Believer is going to go get into formalism I know they criticize our meetings I know they criticize these things say that we're all in the flesh well some of them may be in the the flesh who cares that's right that's right brother that's right but it's a word experience amen there's nothing wrong with shouting there's nothing wrong with Amen in the word there's nothing wrong with with getting excited about what's being preached why it it's it's a true word experience John saw that the lamb opened the book he he got so excited he got beside him self John said brother Bown said John must have had a had a time why he saw his name in the book he actually understood his position yes he did Brother brand said that all happened in our day he was caught up in the Lord's day this day and he was a type of us the bride can you say amen amen well then what we're doing is we're fulfilling and we're not talking hyping up we're not talking about these things we're talking about a true word experience can you say Amen the true word comes to the true prophet and he tells you the true word you follow that true word and you get a true experience of the word that's good because the word is made flesh in you and you become God's son and the word of God is revolving right out of God into you because you are of his nature his spirit is in you and you'll do the works of God you'll do can you say that I'll do the works of God I'll do the works of God Amen that's good and God by his word he believed it he spoke it and it was done and so is it in this day the word is in the bride she has thus sayth the Lord she only does his will only does his will right she does nothing else but his will amen what a position we stand in today may God give us the [Music] faith that perfect Faith amen act upon who we are can you say Amen what song be place so that I [Music] might he became me so that I might become himal by Grace sing it now oh he became me so that I might become him by Grace oh he

aren't you glad to be part of him connected with him connected with his power his life amen I uh I think it's sad sometimes that the devil lets it become common to us and um but I I think you know we we've got to keep on the fire and line you know I think brother Braham said stay in the life you know and that's something that we've got to do is is stay in that life get the world out right Amen brother brandham said the so many voices out there shutting out the voice of God and so there there is a people though that's keeping that channel open amen following the voice of God Amen I love the
