in in what you hear Let It Be a Sweet Sweet Sound in your ears amen do you love the Lord amen and certainly uh uh privileged to be able to love him and not love other things amen as it's been spoken of this day that men would be lovers of pleasure lovers of their own selves more than lovers of God Amen but there are people amen that truly love the Lord with all their heart and we're so thankful for that the musicians can be dismissed I um I know this is an off night but pre appreciate everyone coming uh that we're able to and um we're going to uh be leaving out after service tonight and headed to Oklahoma and we certainly appreciate your prayers as we we need them and um just pray that the Lord will just uh move in a special way uh this weekend and uh they're in Oklahoma and brother Caleb Huffman will be uh ministering this Sunday here here uh the Lord willing and so uh um I'm sure you'll be blessed and um um brother Caleb is um just rising up as a young Minister and and uh giving his um his life to the message and uh so we're thankful for that and uh so anyway he's uh Jonathan my brother's son-in-law and uh so him and Zion are passing through and so he had called and uh said that they would be in service uh Sunday so I said well if you're going to be in we just let you preach and so anyways uh looking I'm sure you'll you'll be blessed amen some of the brothers had to work tonight and uh late and and so brother Terry had called and uh said that uh something had come up they're they're helping sister Alice's uh sister um and uh brother-in-law move uh in down their way and so they had called just um uh close to time to leave and said that they were coming with two truckloads and uh asking uh for help actually they had uh brother teres uh said that they could um use uh their house uh or they've got some room there where they could put their stuff in and um so sister Alice's uh sister is in her 80s and so um anyway so brother Terry and sister Alice are having to help them move and uh so I said well if they're in their 80s and they're moving they're probably looking at you all as young whipper snappers so so I told him whatever you do don't overdo it amen so anyways uh we want to keep them in our prayer amen and do you love the Lord tonight amen if you have your Bibles we're going to just turn uh to the book of Ephesians amen and um I want to uh the sixth chapter and then we'll start at the 10th verse but before we uh read may we just bow our heads and hearts to our Lord and we certainly need him in this age amen and um no matter how long you've been serving the lord um I don't think we could um outlive the fact that we need him amen so let's just pray father Lord you are our everything Lord and we want you to just have your way this evening father no matter how small the group may be tonight your word will have the preeminence and that's what we want it to do Lord you said where two or three are gathered in your name You' be in our midst and father the prophet um applied that for this age which we know that it's every age but father the um that is becoming more uh prominent Lord more re real in to us father and Lord we're just asking that you would have your way this evening and Lord whatever is lacking within us may you uh create Lord by Your Word father father for we want to be more like you I pray that you would bless those that weren't able to make it tonight father wherever they're at uh be with them Lord and be with Daniel and uh Zachary Lord as they're there in Nicaragua father and to do your work Lord father we just give it all to you now in Jesus Christ's name amen uh so we'll start at the 10th verse Ephesians 6:10 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole arm armmer of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against the spiritual wickedness in high places amen then if you'll turn with me to the Book of Matthew the 4th chapter the 13th verse Matthew 4:13 or we can actually just start at the 12th verse Matthew 4 and12 now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison he departed into Galilee and leaving Nazareth he came and dwelt in Capernaum which is upon the Sea Coast in the borders of zebulun and neph nephlim that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by isaas the prophet saying the land of zebulun and the land of nephalem by the way of the sea Beyond Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up amen you can have your seats this evening we are living in in such a wonderful age and I um I think you know the devil his job would be to get us to undermine and or not see the value of the message and also to see the value of us being in the message of the hour and um this as the prophet said this is the greatest age ever we've heard that so many times but I think it really needs to soak into to our hearts as just how great of an age we're living in the world has uh down through the history ever since mankind it is not only spoken of of the prophecy of speaking of Christ the first coming but there's actually more scripture that speaks of this day than it actually spoke of his first coming it's because that not only did God plan for messiah to come and to redeem but he he looked beyond that to see the the results of redemption the results of Calvary and he so anticipated it I mean it was just a an um something to God as if if you um if you've you know plan for something whether it be to build a home or um to to do a garden or whatever um you look for the results of that and so in and anticipating results you you prepare and Calvary was just a preparation uh what Messiah was uh 2 years ago that was just a preparation of of what God was looking for and of course we are the the uh finale everything had been building up all the way down even the Old Testament was building up for messiah to come and and then all through it and um uh has been building up for the day that we're living in and with that in mind um uh we're we're fighting harder than we ever have before because Satan is trying to trying to uh Hinder the the plan of God and and so we're we're fighting it seems like one battle after another just just one after another one after another one blow after blow after blow after blow and it's not only uh physically but it's mentally and and it is it is spiritually as well and um you know brother brandom in his prayer in one place he said thy children are struggling in in these days uh the oppression of the enemy is so strong and and the reason uh for this uh is because there is a contest that started in heaven and um of course Satan rebelled against God as as we know and he was able to draw I think 2/3 I believe of the uh angels with him we would call them Fallen Angels whatever but but when he was kicked out uh when he rebelled he was kicked out of heaven and and brother brandom said Satan was kicked out into the Earth and then he become an enemy to God's people amen he become an enemy I mean he's directing his attacks to to God's people why because he knows that God is is is trying to do something within man God's plan is all about man humankind God God God uh from from God he created Sons we we aren't just a creation but we are literally part of God and and you know it's kind of like brother Bram said if you you love me love my family uh because they're part they're they're part of him and and that's the same way our children are part of us and and so we are part of God and so so God's God's Ambitions God's plans God's purpose it all is wrapped up in his children in his family God wanted to be family God wanted to to uh to to be able to express himself and and so he he's within him is is Redeemer within him is savior within him is healer within him is deliverer within him is all of these attributes and and and and really he wanted to direct that to to us as his children that we could love him and that we could fellowship with him and he would call us his children his sons and daughters he would call us his bride um uh but whatever he would call us it it would be him his family and and that's that's his whole goal his whole OB objective is he allowed us to fall and but yet he would not leave us that way but he would raise us up that was all in his plan that that that we could become one in fellowship with him and truly love him and and truly truly give our lives to him and that he could have total preeminence in us and and that he could reflect himself in us and through us yes he he was able to you know to to create him a body and you know I was um uh talking just kind of getting off uh here but my notes but I I was I had in Pennsylvania had made a a statement how that um uh God was able to um uh let's see how was that um work through a a a redeemed body or uh talking of MDC and a young man he he said I'm not understanding that how how you say that he's able to you know to to work in that way as as he did in MDC and you know and and so I was talking to him you know and trying to explain to him of how that you know when God when God uh uh appeared to Abraham he wanted to appear to Abraham as a man but he had no body he he couldn't he he he had no body to work with and so he created himself a body the prophet said he grabbed a a handful of dust and he blew and and uh you know and he created that body and of course we know it was a theophany body a word body but but then God stepped into that body and he appeared as a man to Abraham and that was wonderful he' done the Messiah sign and and that that was great and then he wanted to come later on as as Messiah and same God and and uh and yet he had no body to work through uh that he could you know have he couldn't go through a sex born body as and these things a sinful man and so uh uh he created a a blood cell in the womb of Mary and and through that body God was able to condens send in that body and the fullness of God dwelt in the body of Jesus Christ ain't that right but it was in this day that God wanted to visit us again God wanted to come in in just as he did in MDC just as he did in Jesus Christ he wanted to come but in this time he didn't have to create a body he didn't have to go and and create a blood cell you know Virgin uh uh to come again he he was able to come in a sex born body because the blood was so perfect at Calvary it was God's own blood and and and God was Able by his own blood to loose us from our sins he was actually able to loose us from our sins and and by loosening us the prophet said if it was perfect blood that loosed us then it's a perfect loosening Amen to where Satan has no control over us and the god of heaven was able to come through that sex born body amen and manifest himself like he did in in me uh in the body of MDC and of course it was later on called Jesus Christ ain't that right and and so this is where we're at is that God through the work of Calvary through the work of redemption has finally been able to get a church a group of people that he can actually Express himself through holy amen not just part but holy Express himself through and Satan hates it Satan hates the fact that that God is able to achieve his plan and he's hey he is trying his best to stop it can you say Amen now so so Satan become an enemy to God's people and he says since then he's used all of his strength and his strategy to try to pull God's people across the fires or into his fire see and so now Abraham Lincoln uh uh made this statement in time of peace prepare for war and brother randam he said see that's right in a time while everything is running smooth you better get ready for Satan isn't going to let it run smooth very long ain't that right so so you you you might be looking for good times and you might be but even in them good times and it seemed like maybe you're coasting and everything is just going smooth sailing you better prepare for war because Satan ain't going to let let it last that long ain't that right he isn't going to let it run smooth very long you're in a convention now he's talking to a crowd and everything will pour along just fine but you're going to leave here in a few days and you're going to meet the real enemy ain't that right and he says he might not even wait till you get ready to leave he might attack any time he's wicked and ruthless ain't that right he just carries on whenever he can whatever he can say or do he does it right now so it's best to be dressed all the time in in in another place he said as we leave this building to go to our different places our homes to meet outside to meet the world let's not go as we have in formal times now notice how he's going to tell us how to meet the enemy let us not go as we have in former times in former ages or whatever but let's go in the power of his resurrection see let's go in the name of Jesus Christ with the banner lifted high and with faith in his word to handle the two-edged sword with the shield and the full armor of God on to meet the enemy can you say amen amen now think of that we're we're going to meet the enemy amen so we want to be dressed up we we want to to to go forth amen and not meet the enemy in as we have in former times as as as through the ages but now looking at the enemy and realizing that we've got to meet him in a different way meet him in the power of his resurrection and go forth in the name of Jesus Christ can you say Amen to meet the enemy because he's getting stronger and more powerful every day ain't that right see so he says this he says now if we have come to the end of these things and the Mystery of God has been completed with us we are looking for more strength don't don't don't just don't just go through life relaxed amen God God has put you in this message for a reason he's called us and he's uh connected us U uh uh uh with the most powerful message on the face of the earth that is ever been can you say Amen see and so he says if if we've come to these in and and we've got to look at this church we're we're here at the end of of all things um the End of Time the end of civilization the end of mortality the the the end of of it all and and the reason why we're at the end is because God has been able to accomplish what he has wanted in us we are the finale of God's plans can you say Amen we we are we're we're not a victim we're not just just uh vagabonds we are part of God's plan and uh uh the prophet placed us at at the very end of this thing amen God has been after a bride we are that bride God has been after a perfect picture we are that perfect we are the last puzzle if you could say it that way see so now God you know it's all ending with us there is a BRI died upon this Earth and everything there's no need for time to continue there there's no need for for for things to keep uh uh continuing as we have seen it we're at the last age there will not be another church age after us there will not be another denomination after us there will not be another whatever we are the finale of it all now it's got to change from Mortal to immortality it's it's got to change from a corrupt civilization to an eternal civilization it's got to change from from uh uh uh corruption to innocence can you say Amen we're going back to where we come from everything that God has has desired and set out and purposed in this Nick of uh uh uh Little Nick uh in eternity called time it's it God has has wound that up in US amen see so now the mysteries of God has been completed with us we are looking for more strength how many's looking for more strength we're looking for more strength we're not on a picnic now and notice what he calls it a rapturing strength Amen to meet a worse Force that'll Rapture the church and take it into Glory we must have it can you say Amen so see you can understand why the powers of darkness is is is running rampant amen is he's trying to stop amen that that that mortal to change to immortality he's trying to stop with everything that he can to keep that church from from escaping out of here now that's right he's trying to keep us in doubt he's trying to keep us in unbelief he's he's trying to do everything he can to affect us can you say Amen first Peter 5 and8 says Be sober everybody say be sober be vigilant for your adversary not just a adversary an adversary your adversary the devil you've got an adversary that the devil as a roaring line walketh about seeking whom he may devour can you say Amen so I want to just say it to you tonight uh I ain't going to take you take long but it's not that God it's not God against you it's not that God has forgotten you I know we could go through trials and we can go through things and we we think maybe that God has just forsaken us and all that that's that's just wrong God is not against you God has not forsaken you amen but the prophet explains what what's going on he says it's the darkness everybody say it's the darkness Gathering itself to try to keep the light from coming that's what it is the pressure that we're feeling the the the the situations that we go through it's the darkness trying to keep that light amen from coming forth right come on now amen and you got to keep that in mind can you say Amen keep that in mind see so so the the the coming light the the coming light amen uh uh is is why this darkness is gathering amen and and uh all the foress forces together and it gets the darkest just before the light shines can you say amen amen see and and so we we we look at this and and realize that God has called us to Prevail that that's that's what we're we're here to do amen is to walk in that that perfect will of God how many wants to walk in that perfect will Amen to walk in that perfect will and I I say to you tonight don't get sidetracked don't don't don't look to the left don't look to the right I don't care how discouraged it may seem I I I I you know don't care how bad the way it may be and and all of these things but you cannot look back God has called you to move forward in him ain't that right and and you remember though that the Bible says greater is he that is in us than he that is in this world and and to think of it now there has to be there has to be the power of Darkness there has to be something to restrict and and and uh there's the opposition there because we are sons of God we have come to a place Amen to where we have been given the authority everybody say I've been given that Authority you have been given the authority by the word of God to speak the word of God can you say Amen you know uh we hear the word of God the the word of God is the most powerfullest thing on on the face of this Earth is is the word of God it's the greatest weapon that you could have is the word of God uh Satan you know when he had uh come to Jesus and you know Jesus was the fullness of the godhead and uh uh the the the uh God dwelt bodily in him he was the image of God uh well he was the image of the visible image of the invisible God Jesus said he that has seen me has seen the father I mean you you couldn't get any closer to God than him he was God Amen and he was the body that God dwelt in and yet Satan would come to him uh uh you know uh uh come to him trying to keep that light for Jesus said I am that light I'm the light and he lit up every scripture that that pertained to him he lit it up he he he made it come to pass every scripture laying there concerning the Messiah he made it live ain't that right and Satan was doing everything he could to stop this thing from happening he knew amen and and and so uh but when he come to Jesus and and Jesus would would uh come back to him by saying Satan it is written Satan it is written ain't that right every time Satan would come to him amen Jesus would just come back with the word of God it is written brother Braham said he had power upon power upon power but he used not a one to defeat Satan with he took the word of God to defeat Satan showing amen he was doing it to show us that the weakest Christian could take the word of God and defeat Satan any time any place under any situation can you say Amen now you you think of that now and and and so here we are amen we're we're back to the place again where the fullness of God is in the church not in a just one body of a man but in his church in this day we've come to that place to where we are at uh uh well we're in the age of adoption amen see here's the enemy it's it's the greatest Force it's the darkest age but God would not it would happen in this age when it's the when when it's the the the greatest light that is ever that has ever come and and so we we are in that age of adoption amen you say well well you know when does that happen you know in the well I just want to say it this way you know I I don't you know we we could go into all of this of how long it takes and all that I don't believe there's any time of of of whatever of how long it takes to to come into the adoption and all that all I know is this that if you'll take God's word and simply believe take all that doubt out and just believe God's word can you say Amen just take God's word and just believe it amen now we've hear the word of God we we we hear it you know when you're hearing brother Brandon preach or you're hearing you know uh Pastor preach or some other evangelist or the ministers here to preach or whatever you're hearing that word but but don't just be hearers but be doers take that word and start speaking that word to Satan can you say Amen on ain't that right amen now I know Satan can get in our mind he can possess you know he can he can get in our thoughts and he'll tell us we're not no good we're not we're not overcoming it's not worth it we you know and he'll just try to bring fear Fe I don't know what he tells you but I do know this that Satan does talk and he puts thoughts in our head ain't that right amen and it's a Warfare amen it's a Warfare of what he's trying to do it's it's powers of Darkness he might tell you that you're not loved he might even get you to feeling like God has forsaken you and and we all go through them times amen but but but what we've got to do instead of letting him just have his way with our mind we've got to start taking the word of God and start speaking that word back to him come on now can you say Amen yes you believe that amen well apparently you don't do you believe that amen if you believe that see then you speak that word amen I mean you know I I you know I I don't I I think of my um uh sister-in-law uh Laura you know she's saying that uh last night you know or well her youngest son has been fighting starts snoring you know when he's sleeping and it's irregular pattern just something weird about it you know and and so she didn't you know she just thought that was strange they they've been thinking that was strange but she was down in she's down in Oklahoma and uh she said you know that um you know I don't know how old Andrew is just young boy but uh he was in the other room and she could hear him all the way in in where she was just snoring and it was just irregular and she'd been looking up uh uh sleep apnea and different things you know maybe what was causing this and and um so she she thought well maybe ought to just in the morning just set at a doctor's appointment and find out what's going on and all that and then she's like no so I'll just wait for the meeting and and just have have the brothers to pray and and we'll go that way and and then it just come to her I am a daughter of God I don't have to wait for the meeting I'm a daughter of God I can lay hands on my boy and and and so she just did that she just went in there and and laid hands on him didn't wake him up just laid hands and said Satan I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ you leave my boy alone and and whatever is going on may may that thing leave in Jesus Christ's name she said he snored twice and then just stopped and and slept all night long and and and no snoring whatever God just touched it right there touched that child right there well what is it is is because someone is taking God at his word somebody is going to take God at his word can you say amen and and this is where we're at church it's it's we we we can't just look at this thing like we're just you know trotting down and I just wish God would do something to take me out of here and all this this you know stuff well God ain't going to take you out right now you know I don't know how much lives you you know or lives uh you know how much time you've got left and I don't know you know when the Rapture is coming but but all I know is this you don't have to live defeated right now you know whatever the devil is doing whatever you can silence him right now you don't have to listen to it you don't have to let him plag your mind you can you know as as they said you know you uh uh uh you know you you you you can you you may not be able to stop the the the birds from flying over but you can sure stop them from building a nest in your hair you understand what I'm saying and that's just the same way the devil's got free reign to our thoughts or our mind so to speak that he can put stuff there he can put negative stuff but he ain't got free reign over your soul that that we can take this word do you understand that God placed us under the greatest message we've got the pure perfect interpretation of this word i i i there ain't no sense in arguing with this message there ain't no sense in trying to figure it out just believe it even if you don't understand it just believe it I don't have to understand it just believe it and I just believe it God Is So Vindicated this thing that that that that that there should be no questions in our mind about what was taught and what was this just take it and believe it God didn't give these things for us to fight over and to fuss over and to feuded about and and all these things he gave it to his people that we could believe it in this age to get Supernatural strength and you say Amen Supernatural strength amen that that's what that that's what it is this we're we're overcoming that's right we're overcoming how means overcoming do you believe you're over Comer amen you we don't go by feelings in the first place feelings will forsake you amen and and and you can feel saved today feel lost tomorrow but it doesn't change the fact that you're saved if you've done exactly what the Bible says and God has filled you with the Holy Ghost amen then then then that you're sealed to the day of your Redemption so you cannot let Satan take your ground you cannot let Satan Realize by the message of the hour do you realize that there denominations ain't preaching these things and putting the the people in in the position of the word of God Amen but we know what we are by the message of this hour and we've been positioned in the promises of God to know that every promise is ours every promise we don't have to be defeated we're not defeated God is with us and we have been given the word to speak it in our own mouths and say Satan you've got to turn loose don't look at time don't look and say well well I've been praying and praying it just ain't happening don't even look at that look at that word and just keep speaking that word amen that's what we're doing to That's How we'll Prevail can you say Amen we're coming into a place the word amen has come to a Perfection amen uh uh uh they they've had little parts of the word down Through the Ages amen but if you go listen to turn on the light turn on the light in 64 brother said that St that word won't work for today if we we've got the greatest thing we don't need to go back and try to figure out what was truth back then you've got the truth now you're equipped enough to defeat the enemy with can you say Amen if we needed more God would send another Prophet but he ain't going to send another prophet he ain't going to send another age this is it you've got enough to take the if we get say the bull by the horns you got enough to get strength inside of you to go in this Rapture you got enough for a body change you got enough to lay claim to your children and know that they'll be there you got enough to lay claim to your healing whatever you have need of the light is going to Prevail can you say Amen you love the Lord if the musicians will come amen Hallelujah take God at his word church take God Amen we're we're do you realize that we are a people you know I know I've said it and there's never been another age that has been promised that the son of man would be revealed but this age right amen no other age and it was Christ that would show he had all power within him he knew he knew who he was right he knew his position in the scriptures he knew his place and he knew what the devil was trying to get him to do and he wouldn't budge he wasn't going to listen to that old devil he wasn't going to give one inch to that devil cuz he knew his position he knew he was predestinated for that time and so are you other ages men have come and they've had little part of the word but just enough light just enough light see but but here we're walking in the full light the full light to be able to know that we were in the mind of God before the foundation of the world to know that we were saved not on any given day but we were were saved back then in the mind of God now if we were saved in the mind of God how is Satan going to stop that how can he It's Already Done Right amen it's just we let him Bluff us don't let him
