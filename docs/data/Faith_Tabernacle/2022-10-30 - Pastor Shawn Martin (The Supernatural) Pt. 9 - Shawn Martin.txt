you have redeemed us Lord and brought us together in this age by a supernatural message father no man could have done it Lord it it took you to to do it father and it was something that you had put within our hearts before the foundation of the world and and you would use the message to call us out Lord from all kinds of Dark Places that we could come together not just in a building but our hearts be United and knitted together Lord and we serving one Lord having one hope one faith one expectation and Lord it's it's all of our desire Lord and anticipation is just to see you face to face that Lord until that time I pray that you would just come in your special way here father and just move across the building and just speak to every heart Lord were your children and we need you and I pray Lord if there's anything that would hinder us this morning I pray Lord that you would just take every spirit that ain't like you out of our lives or out of this building father and may Faith come alive this morning is our prayer in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen praise the Lord and the book of Ephesians um the first chapter 15th verse wherefore I also after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto all the saints cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation and the knowledge of him in the eyes of your understanding been enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints praise the Lord you can have your seats that I also want to look here in the 22nd verse and says and hath put all things under his feet and gave him Christ to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all I'm going to again speak on the supernatural he said it'll be my title and I hope trust that this series has been of some help to you sometimes I find it really difficult to express what is on my heart and so my prayer is is that the Lord would just be merciful and and reveal it to us even in a greater way show it to us and um but I do believe that we're were part of something that is far greater than ourselves or that is far greater than anything in this natural world and and and I pray that God will really show us that more than just uh by learning it or intellectually but but really become a revelation in our heart but we are we are part of God we we are part of God and God is Supernatural and where God is the supernatural always takes place for that's what the prophet said and the supernatural has nothing to do with the the efforts of man it it goes beyond the intelligence of man it goes beyond science it goes beyond politics or education or civilization or whatever it is superior to anything that man can come up with and we could take like creation creation is a supernatural happening you'd be surprised that man doesn't look at it that way it's kind of a humorous little uh thing I'm just you know I was reading you know that some scientists approached God and they told themselves you know God we don't need you anymore this is uh we've we've discovered that we're equal with you now and so God says oh yeah how how was that you know and so they say well we we've now been able to to form a body uh of man uh you know out of Out of the Dust just like you did so we don't need you and so God said well yeah well we'll go ahead and prove it so they take you know they they took a handful of dust and God says oh no no no no no no don't you do that says you got to go get your own dust you know and so man you know they they can only take what is created and do whatever they want to do and and man gets lifted up in that and he thinks we've really accomplished something and yet they they forget that it was what created it whatever they take to to to use to make rubber or to to make the car to make the house or to whatever how did that get here of course you know they'll explain it you know and say it was Evolution and da da da but you know uh they're just out of their heads and but we we we look and and this is this is where we we are coming to a man has arrived in his thinking and and it's getting more prominent and I know that there have always been nuts out there that you know they're atheists but I there's a certain man that's going around giving lectures in the United States and probably the world and I heard him say the other day and things that he's saying is very sobering to to think of the achievements that man has come up with in science but he says we are now seriously in the business of acquiring the traditional Divine abilities and qualities he's talking of man and he's actually in a church and and the church is full and and he says now you take this church he said for years and years and years the church has has described of God and and has told of all the Divine qualities of God and it's been it's been preached about talked about he says but now we are seriously uh in the business of acquiring the traditional Divine abilities and qualities now this man is supported by Barack Obama uh uh Bill Gates Mark Zuckerberg and many other wealthy men and and so you you see where they're trying to push uh uh in science and education and all these things but he said he said the goal that science has is to find the key the secret to happiness and to basically upgrade the human into gods God men now he's trying this there this is what they're pushing for the agenda through science and and now I I I'm not going into everything he said but it's it's really incredible where they're headed uh but he says I I don't mean it as kind of a literally metaphor I mean it in the literal sense he goes to say that men for thousands of years have subscribed particular abilities and qualities to God then he says we are now seriously in the business of acquiring these traditional Divine abilities and qualities to ourselves whether it's trying to overcome death and gain immortality or whether it's the ability to create and design life so they know there's something out there and they know that man was created for something and yet and and notice the direction that they're headed and that is to make man into gods and now of course you know he goes on to talk about his he'll be the those that are computers in the computer age and how that they're tracking everything about you your feet they know your desire they know your your wants they they know uh by by what you look at what you shop for or what you this they know all about you and he says and now we're getting into the brain to where we control we can control everything about them and we become gods so there's be a there their purpose is that some will rise to godship and others will be their little pawns minions but what a perversion that is right trying to achieve god-like qualities without the supernatural now the only place that god-like qualities will be expressed in and through is the body of Jesus Christ do you believe that no matter what or no matter what they come up with it will always be a source of the devil it it'll be in it's inspired of the devil right because that's isn't that what what the whole purpose is is that Satan's agenda wanted to be as God show himself to be as God and yeah all of these things and so man man will have nothing to do with such qualities as this because man can never produce god-like qualities you believe that never now so so you know as I just reading uh uh uh some of the prophet and and he says this he said God is not going to deliver his people by education God is not going to deliver his people by science God is not going to deliver his people by denomination and I'll tell you this God ain't building his body by science God is Not projecting his qualities in demand through education science or anything that man has I don't care how smart they are and what they can do with computers and and these things and how controlling they can be it'll never be Godlike qualities can you say man see and and so science has never yet been able to come up with and create things ain't that right so the prophet says he will deliver them talking about his people he'll deliver them by the power the supernatural power of changing their lives and molding them into children of God that's how it's going to deliver us can you say man now that Deliverance has taken place now you believe that so healing of both spiritual and physical is is a supernatural happening Miracles salvation is a a supernatural happening you being a new creation is a a supernatural happening ain't that right amen as we know the whole armor of God is Supernatural amen Joy Faith uh Temperance godliness meekness long-suffering and peace and gentleness and and all of these things see it it you you it's supernatural you you take the man that was filled with hate and and Malice and and now is love is flowing through that man what is it it's a supernatural happening you you take a a an individual that was filled with fear and on the urge of having a nervous breakdown and anxieties and and all of these things and now a man a peace has has taken over well what's happened there uh us it's supernatural uh happening we we didn't see anything enter into them you know I've seen where you know drunk men um uh be staggering drunk come to the The Altar and and and and and and God so get a hold of that individual and and before you know it they get up and they're sober and never to drink again well we we didn't see you know something come into them we we we didn't physically give them a shot of some medication can you say man amen see they're not taking some pill that science has invented but God took over it was a it was something Supernatural that they themselves didn't have they a couldn't give it to them uh uh counseling couldn't give it to them it was it was a supernatural God that came and done a supernatural work ain't that right so here the prophet says the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long-suffering goodness patience meekness he said there's not one visible evidence not one fleshly see it's all in the Supernatural realm that's right it's the hidden Force that's in you can you say man see something came in you beyond the powers of man beyond the abilities of man and it's a hidden Force inside of you hidden then he says it's the life of Jesus Christ coming back on you the worshiper can you save man as you laid your hands upon his head and confessed that you was wrong now we we said it before but brother Brown said the greatest curse that that the church that's on the church today now I believe that was years ago of course you know so so we're looking at it in a different light today but back then he said the greatest curse that's on the church today is not knowing what they are amen that's the greatest curse upon the church is the church don't know what they are can you say man so what is the church it's the body of Jesus Christ it is the body amen amen talking about literal God it's the literal body amen I understand or you know of course when I say literal I I I I I mean your hands are his hands yes there is a physical body up in heaven that I'm talking about right now here on this Earth it's a it's a a spiritual body but it's your hands that are his hands your feet that's his feet ain't that right amen and and so Paul would tell us that the church is the body of Christ and it's the fullness of him that fill us all in all it's the completion it's the Perfection of him that fill us all in all can you say man amen that's right so that's what the church is and as Jesus was the veil of God so is the church God's veiled today so much so that the prophet would tell us she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him and you say Amen even the scriptures identify her as being him a man and and brother Bradham would it took a prophet again to bring this out II Thessalonians 2 7 for the mystery of the iniquity does already work only he God who let us now let us will let until he the bride be taken out can you say Amen take it out of the way the prophet said that's the bride amen you see when God lifts his Spirit off this Earth the bride goes with him because she's the body he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you can you say Amen so if he's leaves this bride's leaving too amen that's right so the spirit of God has become incarnate in the Church of the Living God today amen uh the church the prophet said comes out of that Dark Age justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost Incarnate Word that's where we're at today Incarnate Word can you say man a man say so how is this happening now how how is this word become incarnate in US it it's beyond anything natural and you say man you go to church every day of your life and it still ain't going to happen to you you can set under the best teachings and it ain't going to happen so how's this happening 5 John 5 24 verily verily Jesus says verily verily I say unto you he that heareth everybody say heareth that's the important thing right there he that heareth my word and believeth on him a man that sent me hath the everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but his past from Death unto life now brother Branham takes that word hearing and he says now the Hebrew definition is receiveth he that heareth or he that receiveth my word ain't that right he that receiveth so he receives my word says anyone can hear it Sinners and everything else but he that receiveth my word he that can take it all not just part of it he that can believe it all and and and and and receive it into himself the prophet said when you receive the word you receive him and you say man amen when you receive the word you receive him and so that's that's how the church becomes his body and it was important for a prophet to come then you say man to bring a bride into existence but the word had to be restored back to its perfection can you say amen amen we believe dogma's and it didn't make anything out of us except Methodist Baptist denominational children can you say man it didn't produce anything but honorary no good church members but the word came and when the word was perfected that that Divine interpretation of the word was revealed to us we received it and you say man now look at the flip side of the coin brother Brown says by by the worldly Church rejecting the word makes a perfect way for Satan to come into her and incarnate himself right into her right receiving the word makes way for God to come in you rejecting the word makes a perfect way for Satan to become incarnate in the church in that nominal church denomination a worldly church can you say man incarnate himself right in her see again he is able to Incarnate himself into that church because she has rejected the Vindicated word of God it gives the devil a place to come right in and incarnate himself and he will make an image unto the beast when both the Protestant and Catholic Church come together and they're doing it right now you believe it yes sir they're doing it right now so the Church of the Living God a man is the body of God by believing the word now don't don't get me wrong I'm not doing away with the baptism of all the ghost by one Spirit you're all baptized into one body can you say Amen but let's just face it brother bran told us God don't give a person the Holy Ghost until he's recognized their faith he recognizes that there's a gene seed that's in them ain't that right you don't have to beg for the Holy Ghost you don't have to plead for the Holy Ghost amen I don't think you've got a fast for the Holy Ghost if you're a real believer you'll receive the Holy Ghost so the Church of the Living God is made up of individuals that's been born of the spirit of God and it all makes up the Bride of Jesus Christ you believe that so God is still hiding behind skin and it's your skin that he's hiding behind your skin amen praise the Lord your skin no no scientific stuff this is this is the mystery great is the mystery of godliness they're trying to bring it through science but it'll never happen they're trying to bring it through education it'll never happen they're even trying to through religion it'll never happen but great is the mystery of godliness God was manifested in the flesh how in the world can that invisible God become visible in a body of today I'll tell you they received the where and they receive him amen so he's hiding behind you your skin if you're in the church remember the mystery is Christ in you the hope of glory now brother Brandon says the Holy Spirit presses it the life see in there until the Life of Christ is formed in you becomes deity I know we might know all these things but I'm going to just preach it anyways the Holy Spirit presses it the life in there until the Life of Christ is formed in you becomes deity don't don't just say I've got the Holy Ghost and then you just sit and twiddling your thumbs all defeated the Holy Ghost is just going to keep pressing that life pressing that life pressing that life and as he's pressing he's getting all that junk out of you Taurus nothing but the life of Jesus Christ the deity of God flowing in you believe it this is the age of recognition in John 14 18. I read it a lot it says I will not leave you comfortable as Jesus speaking I will come to you in a little while the world seeth me no more but you see me why because the mystery is going to be opened up to you because I live you shall live also you're going to have that same quickening power living in you and at that day this day the prophet would tell us you shall know you shall recognize that I'm in my father you and me and I in you you're not going to look at him as the third person of the godhead you're going to look at him as the same God dwelling in your body amen this is the day that Jesus was speaking of that we would recognize now I read this our opening scripture to hear Paul would tell us that that he's praying that that that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened being open that you may know can you say man this day that prayer has been fulfilled you say man this day he was looking for this day to happen this is the day that our eyes are being opened not by a natural thing but the same way that Jesus opened the eyes of the two on their way to Emmaus it wasn't anything natural that opened their eyes can you say Amen it was Christ that opened their eyes and he did something among them science could not produce he did something among them that no intelligent man could produce but whatever he did he's still done it today [Music] and it's Opening Our Eyes this is the day that our eyes are becoming open like the servant that was with Elisha right remember the Army surrounded the city the enemy surrounding the city and when he that servant got up oh my he was in panic because all he saw was the enemy surrounding the city Elias should come out servant is just bemoaning and and and and and and and and being all full of doubt and yet Elisha said but more are they with us than they are with him How could a man say that he wasn't depending on anything natural can you say Amen amen seen and he says the angels of God see he knew Elisha knew that the angels of God were with him ain't that right more are they that are with us than they that are with them he couldn't see them he couldn't smell them he couldn't taste them he couldn't hear of them he couldn't feel them but he knew they were there can you say man not one of his senses declared that they were there but he had believed what the prophet said if a prophet would believe in other prophet's words that was Vindicated why can't the people of God just simply believe it well I will tell you the people of God will believe it will remember in Psalms the angel of the Lord accompany them that fear Him and he delivereth them so he didn't have to fill them he didn't have to see them he didn't have to sense them can you say man he just simply believed it why he was looking to the Unseen that Supernatural element that's right he just rested in what the prophet's word said and when when the eyes of the servant came open he saw the angels all around the prophet brother Brown said the presence of God is always everybody say is always the presence of God is always with his believing children you believe that you don't have to feel him you don't have to seem s you don't have to sense him you don't have to hear him but if you can take what the prophet just said you can rest in it it's a supernatural happening our faith is not in our senses our faith is in the Supernatural God don't have to be seen for us to believe the prophet said he's always with his believing children and I believe it I believe it this day that curse is being lifted off of the Church of the Living God to where she can recognize who she is amen now I'm going to go on notice in Matthew 17 14. it says and when they were come to the multitude there came to him speaking of Jesus a certain man kneeling down to him and saying Lord have mercy on my son for he's a lunatic and sore vexed for all times he followeth Into the Fire and off into the water and I brought him to thy disciples and they could not cure him now that sounds pathetic that and and and and to be honest when you're looking at it and you say well duh they're just humans Jesus Is God hello why in the world would he take him to the disciples in the first place I need you just take him to Jesus so many mental people or people have that mental capacity today that Jesus ain't doing nothing because he ain't here in the physical body he can't heal no more he doesn't save no more he doesn't this any of the supernatural like the prophet said they've taken all the supernatural out of the Bible but here we find the prophet would tell us and the Bible even tells us that these men was given power they should have been able to cast that devil out ain't that right the prophet said these men had the word and the Word was made flesh then and the word said to them I give unto you power if it was a scientist okay yeah you can doubt that it was just an educated idiot you could doubt that this was the word telling them this wasn't some physician doctor this was the word this wasn't a seminary giving them their license this was the word so they had the power notice they had the power but they didn't have the faith to operate the power or brother Brown would tell it this way they didn't have the faith to operate the word that was in them ain't that right now now this is very critical to us because if you do not have the faith to operate the word that's in you he'll be defeated every time you'll meet the devil ain't that right you can say well I'm bride bride bride bride then you've got to have faith with that that matches that right we can read where the word says that we are the body of Jesus Christ on the earth that we've got to have faith to match that operate it now the word of God is a sword Hebrews 4 and 12 says it is and the only saying that can handle the sword the prophet says is a hand of faith strong hand of faith Faith holds and grips it ain't that right you know remember I'm talking about how two people do you know and you've probably seen you know seen them you know some way of dueling two people and and and brother Brandon says well that's you and the devil amen don't you think that this is a picnic you're on playground that you're going to Coast into heaven just just on Easy Street you're fighting the devil can you say Amen amen no matter what God says about you you've got to stand Toe to Toe with the devil and believe it it's true now what is the devil why are we fighting the devil because he's trying to get you to doubt trying to get me to doubt hello that's what the prophet says he's trying to get you to doubt and so he comes to you the word comes you receive it you're excited about it but don't you think you're going to be left alone because now it's the devil's job to get you to doubt it ain't that right so listen now brother Brian says now you're sworn that you've got May ever be so good it's a million times better than his the weapon that God gave you is a million times greater than anything that the devil has to offer you whatever he comes at you with which we know he comes at us with doubt is that right so he says it's it's a million times better he's I'm going to tell you he his is not even a sword it's a stick so you've got the sword and he's got a little stick right so so don't even think that he's a match oh yeah fleshly naturally you're he's more than a match but with your weapon hello with your weapon you are way more than a match see yours is a sword but if the hand that holds that sword is weak the stick can overcome it but no matter how little this hand is if it holds the word of God with faith there's nothing going to do it it can put anything down I hope you're listening everybody say my sword can put anything down why there's deity living in you there's a supernatural element that's a part of you yes sir that's right see now notice the prophet says now when you lock with the devil he puts questions in your mind that's what prophet says that's why I tell you stay away from questions do not entertain questions can you say Amen if I listen to questions buddy I'd be defeated every day I wouldn't be here preaching to you this morning if I listen to questions hello questions constantly questions you'll question you I'm going to challenge you as to whether you're a Son of God or not and and usually where does it where does Them Questions enter in the mind thank God for your Prophet I don't think there's ever another Minister outside this message that tells us that the battlefield is in the mind all right man that God would send us a prophet to prepare us for this age this battle that is now at hand can you say Amen so he puts questions in your mind is a soul or is it not so see questions brother Brown says he's pressing you saying say it's wrong see it's wrong you mustn't believe it what's he talking about this Bible this message what is it and it's sad to say we got preachers that are putting questions in the people's mind they'll get up and say well this message is just becoming a a cult that's all they see is the negative what they're looking at is something negative and I'll just tell you that's an unbelieving spirit and I I challenge you young people and you parents be careful who you send your children what camps you send your children to be careful as to what programs you go to I'm telling you amen because everybody's saying message don't mean that they're all right with the word [Music] there's many people many ministers that are promoting their own agendas they're so caught up in these other things and they're putting questions out before the people that's of the devil can you say Amen that's right so the prophet is telling us see that it's the devil that putting questions in your mind the prophet says don't listen to him just believe the word didn't you say Amen and when you just believe that word he says then you will direct that sword right straight into the devil's heart hello you know the prophet said a man can live in such a place condition that the devil don't know what to do with them now that's where this bride's headed and I believe she's here he'll come at her on all fronts and she's still standing hello I know you know you may not like the battle that's raging and you say my god when can I have peace your peace is just beyond the river but you just keep pressing on because every time you say Amen to that word you're defeating the devil every time you're lifting your hands glorifying God you're defeating the devil every time you confess the word and say salvation is mine Deliverance is mine Holy Ghost is mine the Rapture is mine you're defeating the Devil Keep defeating him can you say man you're a body of believers Supernatural y'all brother Brown said then when I'm pressing with faith with the word saying everybody say sang confessing don't just sit there and be silent let the devil beat you up in your mind you start speaking the word so now brother Branham you know indirectly he lets us know the battles he goes through he said see now he's going to make it personal for him then when I am pressing with faith with the word saying Satan Jesus Christ commissioned me to do this and we lock many times brother bran will talk about his stories of how the angel met him and all that you know why I I don't believe it was just for the people's sake I believe it was to let the devil know that he still believed it Ten Years Later he's still telling about that angel 20 years later he's still telling about the angel can you say man brother Brandon was just human just like you and I he even told his wife says I don't even know if I'm called to preach where in the world would that come from the devil and thank God he had a wife to tell him to stop babying around don't you listen to that I think that's one good thing you've got good good Christian spouses and when you start bellyaching they can look at you and say shut up maybe not in that way but it's directly what they want to say quit belly aching around God's called you when I start bellyaching my wife just just tells me but Sean you got to quit listen to that devil and you know what she'll she'll she'll do and it's it's it's humbling sometimes for me but she'll say remember what you preached yeah you gotta use it on yourself too that shuts me up I thank God for my wife I'll tell you how it is sometimes can you say man we don't need to call each other for pity parties we need to call each other to to hear truth not say oh you poor little thing but say no get up get up you can fight this thing you can endure this thing we're backing you God's behind you hello see so he says see I I he says Satan Jesus Christ commissioned me to do this thing and we lock and raise up with that hand of faith and say an angel of God met me Yonder and set it so and the first thing you know it throws the swords right straight in and he's conquered it says and I come to challenge you and thus saith the Lord that's the believer when he has Faith to handle the word brothers and sisters you've already got the saith the Lord you don't need somebody to say thus saith the Lord your bride you need to take what the prophet said the prophet is thus saith the Lord and if the prophet said you can make it you can make it if the prophet said take God at his word then take God at his word if the prophet said your sword which is the word is a million times greater than that saith the Lord to you believe it that's right that's right now notice Satan's got a stick all right so remember that it's just a stick so what is Satan's weapon to you now there's what brother Brown's asking now in another place he with that stick his weapon to you is is to try to get you to disbelieve your weapon foreign now what a knucklehead could you imagine you got this sharp razor edge sword it's there it's glisten it's sharp you know what it can do you cut tomatoes with it and then some old guy has a little old twig and he said I'm going to beat your head off you know what try it that he just start staying he just stands there he ain't gonna approaching with that stick then he starts talking to you I don't know why you're willing that thing you know that thing only Cuts tomatoes I bet you anything if you ever try to hit that thing it'll tickle me just yeah just swing it it'll just tickle me and the goofball that has the sword starts listening I'm really feeling foolish with this thing I probably shouldn't even brought it out forgive me puts it down and now the devil says all right now I got you poof right but what happens that's the same thing we do when the Devil comes at us he gets us to disbelieve this you're only standing by this that's the only way you can defeat the Devil is by this so he says if he can get you to disbelieve your weapon is equivalent if he gets you to believe that your weapon is not strong enough he's he's disarmed you how many Christians are disarmed going to church disarmed trying to be a father disarmed trying to be a mother disarmed trying to be a parent trying to be a Godly young person disarmed hello now just imagine young people going to schools these days disarmed just imagine trying to go to work disarmed trying to come to church even disarmed trying trying to trying to just you know bring peace you know having a a loving marriage disarmed trying to have you raise your children in the in the admonition of the Lord and yet disarmed you can't do it in this age amen so the prophet goes on Jesus had faith with his power and he said in John 5 19 I want to listen how this Faith worked Jesus said I can do nothing of myself he wasn't trying to do it in himself he wasn't trying to be a Christian in himself he wasn't trying to work the works of God by himself he wasn't trying to cast out Devils by himself can you say Amen it wasn't leaning to a natural source he was leading to the supernatural I can do nothing of myself it's the father right so the prophet says see he relied everybody say he relied on what he was ain't that right well what was he he was the veil of God he was the fleshly Veil the human Tabernacle of God and he so believed it oh my God that he relied upon it Satan you can come at me but there's something greater in me yes I'm just Flesh and Bones just like anyone else yachting out and don't get me wrong but but listen he was subject to things just Temptations just like you were mind battles just like you were sickness just like you were can you say man yes I know he was virgin born but think of it if you're born again you are redeemed born is knowing that he was the word notice he had faith in God who made him the word he was God the word and they was in him and that gave him Faith because he understood everybody say he understood his position he knowed what he was because the scripture had said uh uh he was this and here every scripture tied in to prove that he was exactly what the scripture said he would be and he knew what he was he wasn't relying he wasn't reliant on his own abilities and I'll be honest he wasn't relying on the church's abilities he didn't have to be prophesied over he didn't have to be called out by somebody he didn't have to have someone to have a vision about him and a dream about him he didn't have to have somebody you know say yeah I say Unity a man for him to recognize who he was he knew who he was by what the word said can you say amen and yet the word did not call him by name the word did not say uh behold you know uh uh uh uh I'll not see Jesus my Holy One uh us let him see corruption right it didn't mention his name he said it just said I'll not let uh see my holy one seed let my Holy One see corruption see I'll not leave him in that in that condition ain't that right I can't uh you you know the scripture I'm referring to he didn't have to have and literally see his name in that scripture but by faith he knew who it was amen amen that's why before even died and rose again he told him to destroy this temple in three days I'm going to raise it up again and brother Brown said he based that quote on the scripture he believed what the word said about him so he didn't look for signs to give him faith in what he was remember Jesus said this wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after signs ain't that right they're seeking after signs Jesus said that to the believer the signs would follow the believer but notice what goes before the believer the where the word goes before the believer the believer is following the word the believer is looking to the word and the signs are following that believer can you say Amen so notice Jesus was God not giving Faith because he understood his position he said he knew what he was therefore he relied upon what God had made him you understand that church if if you just excuse me but you know your natural birth made you one way your spiritual birth made you another way don't rely on your natural right rely up on what God made you to be can you say Amen because what your rebirth is it's according to the Eternal thoughts of God ain't that right so that give him Faith see so he said he relied upon what God made him and if he did that then can't we rely upon what God made us as Believers these signs shall follow them that believe he had faith in what he was and if you are a Believer you have faith in what you are you are a believer and if you've got faith in God the Bible says over here if our heart condemns us then we can't have faith but if our heart condemns us don't condemn us then then we have faith we have confidence towards God can you say amen amen in other words if your heart's condemning you over a sin that you've committed and it's not under the blood get that sin under the blood because you ain't going any further get it confessed and we know what the prophet says if you cheated on your wife confess to your wife don't go to God right you know our brothers got a ill ill towards you the Bible says don't even come to this Altar and start praying to God said leave your gift at that altar you go to your brother you make that right so many people forget all that right you can't go any further with God until you do that you got to repent get everything right then when you make it right then you've got you've got a foundation to stand on because Satan's going to tell you all kinds of nonsense he'll even bring up your past because he works on that memory works on affections right true I remember as just 16 year old boy 15 year old boy going to votech learning electricity they played him love songs and all that rock and roll and all that every season just about then songs start popping up in my head years later I don't know why memories it just it's just constantly Satan bringing trying to bring them up trying to bring them up hello certain things in your life certain seasons he's all the time trying to bring it up he said well I thought I was forgiven I thought I was over all that I saw that hey Satan uses anything hello because this flesh is still subject to Temptations this flesh is still weak we're talking about the soul can you say man so if your heart condemns just not then we have confidence towards God but as long as you're doing things that's wrong you can't have confidence towards God you'll automatically know listen you'll automatically know you're wrong hello and notice notice what he says now if your heart's condemning you and you know you're wrong he said you automatically put yourself back there a sinner by knowing that you're wrong Sinners don't get nowhere with God people living in sin don't live don't get anywhere with God ain't that right remember the prophet that was called to pray for the sick he lied to that lawyer try to go pray for that baby nothing would happen and his heart was condemning him all the time what about that lie you told but when he went and made that right not to God to the lawyer then he repented to God that baby was made whole is that right so you automatically put yourself back there a sinner not in the sense that you are a sinner but you lose power you don't have to get saved all over again don't have to get baptized all over again hello but when your heart don't condemn you you know you're a Believer and there's nothing between you and God you can ask what you will and know that it'll be given because it's the word that's given to you just like it was given to those disciples now notice we're super race of people are we not why because we have Supernatural power with Supernatural signs through a supernatural belief in a supernatural word coming from a supernatural God that's what the prophet says it's a supernatural God in a supernatural body living in a natural people and they he says they that know their God shall do exploits great exploits and show Supernatural signs a people Abraham's seed a sign of the supernatural Christ risen from the dead supernaturally they're not going to reflect a church doctrine they're not going to return reflect something natural they're going to reflect the supernatural Christ that he's risen supernaturally from the dead living in them now listen there's nothing natural there's nothing in the natural it makes us a super race I'm going to go on I hope I ain't born yet but I hope we'll help you every Shield of the believer is Supernatural the prophet says everything that belongs in the realm of Christianity is worked by Supernatural then another place he said God is calling a church in the Realms of Supernatural can you say man on the day of Pentecost the church was birthed by the supernatural ain't that right so outside of being in that body of Christ you're in the natural everything all religions are man-made all denominations are man-made all Creeds and traditions are man-made most of non-denominations are man-made all seminaries are man-made can you say man why they are inspired by man they are directed by man controlled by man taught by man psychology comes from man Theologian theology comes from man legalism is the works of man formalism is the product of man they've made it all about man man made altar calls you know good and well brother Brown wasn't against alter calls what he was against is men making them alter calls men dragging the people up people dragging other people up or or using the you know Grandma loved you your Mama Prayed For You years ago and da da working on that memory man-made can you say Amen shake hands with the preacher to be accepted in the church put your name on the roll to be belonged to the church but to be in God's Church it takes the supernatural to put you in this is a supernatural body notice II Corinthians 5 17 therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature or creation listen old things are passed away behold all things are become new now listen to me now we know what the prophet said passed away that word passed away means change to another Hallelujah brother around talks about it in in the future home and and he talked about the new Heaven and the new Earth right the old Heaven the old Earth passed away the new Heaven and the new Earth comes and brother Bradham takes that scripture in Leviticus and begins to speak on the eighth day ain't that rack and he tells us that the new heavens and the new Earth starts on the new Eighth Day on the eighth day can you say Amen the Millennium is on the seventh day ain't that right then he says the Eighth Day speaks of Eternal things it speaks of Eternity as she rolls around without a stopping place new he said it's beyond time it's beyond see it's beyond man-made things he said seven days only has to do with the old creation world time but the Eighth Day deals with new creation not old creation not your sex-born life not dealing with you as a sinner not dealing with your natural history not dealing with your natural family tree can you say amen that's right see it deals with New Creation God even tell the people that on the eighth day don't work don't do any severe work on that day can you say Amen brother Brandon would tell us Jesus raised from the dead on the eighth day no scientists raised him up no education raised him up no man-made scheme raised him up no Theologian raised him up it was Supernatural hello Church something Supernatural that was living in him raise that body up [Music] the church was inaugurated or birthed on the eighth day on the day of Pentecost and man had nothing to do with it it came from on high that same spirit that was in Christ Came Upon them in a pillar of Fire hello notice where is the bride standing today she's been called out she has nothing to do with denominations denomination has nothing to do with her she's been called out of the denominational ages we are not part of the seventh age [Music] brother Brown said the seventh Church age is the Pentecostal laodicean age but we have been called out of that age can you say man that church has reflected every other Church age Pentecostal age reflected every other Church age and look where they are they're worse than any other age can you say man that we as we said last Sunday we've been called out we've been hewed out chopped out for his name ain't that right and every believer that goes into the body of Christ is a new creation oh God has brought a new beginning in your life aren't you glad for that he did it with the token for Israel it was New Beginnings for them he even gave him a new time a new calendar a new beginning you know Israel has their own time clock their own calendars God gave it to them under that token praise the Lord old things are passed away behold all things are become new notice brother Brown said it does not have anything to do with the literal things it's beyond that it's into the kingdom of God with eternal life with the predestinated that never did start rolling back around back to Eternity it never started on any other day or any day you wasn't saved on any day you was always saved you were trapped in this dimension of time in this body of time hello but we ain't talking about your natural origin we're talking of what you were in the mind of God this church is not reflecting a natural origin tell us who began this church in this natural what teacher began this church it wasn't brother Branham but that pillar fire did God did can you say Amen that church was started by God and it'll never be able to be defeated by any man bless the Lord see Jesus just come to redeem that but you were safe from the beginning because you had eternal life to begin with a trout fish can never be a gar or a tadpole he might be in the same water with him but he was from the beginning a trout the net only caught him but he was that from the beginning see you enter into life not keeping a day or Shadow Paul said over there see you in the fourth Hebrews 4 you keep days and shadows and things like that I'm scared of your experience we don't pass into certain days and orders you pass from Death unto eternal life not days and times you pass into eternity that's the holy convocation see you're done he said it has passed through time and dropped into eternity again not keeping of days keeping of sabbaths and new moons and things like that but have passed changed your form not annihilated but passed from Death unto life eternal oh what the Bible does teach us pass from one to another it's all right another place eight cannot be counted with the weak see the the weak cannot be counted eight days in a week you can't do it because there's only seven days in a week count it any way you want to Sunday is the first day of the week you count seven then you've got to go back in and start all over again that's what this body of Believers is he said and we lived all through these types in here but when you hit the eighth you go into eternity you don't come by laws and rituals and orders you come by predestination I hope you understand nothing natural there is a genuine holy convocation we're ending the seventh Church age the Pentecostal age do you see it we're entering that Holy convocation we are entering into that real genuine eternity where the church is called not to some station Sunday nomination but in to Eternity with their Eternal King you've passed into eternity where you came from you was there to begin with here you are now back and we're and and your whole journey is going back back back can you say man that's why we're not into politics that's why we're not trying to hold up the world system we're going back so you're not a product of some man-made Creed you're not a product of some church doctrine you're not a product of some good deed that you've done we are now realizing more and more that we are an attribute of God we are if we're or we're a fallen thought of God so we had a form of eternal life within us in seed form and we are an expressed attribute of God on Earth as to what he thought us to be in the beginning and you say man and if you're not that the prophet says then you'll never be there to begin with no matter what you do so we are Beyond man-made things so notice you cannot believe unless God gives you the ability to believe It's Supernatural you cannot see or understand the things of God unless God supernaturally opens the eyes of your understanding it's supernaturally revealed the pull that we feel towards God is nothing worked up by man It's Supernatural for John 6 44 says no man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him if you've got a desire to serve God with all your heart don't you count that as something small don't you think oh I just got excited watch it as it stays with you then you know that's God see that's why we don't beg people to come to the altar we we don't need to beg people to come to church we don't need to beg people to get you know it's it's got to be in the heart can you say man it has to come from the supernatural now as I get ready to close brother Branham talked about a man who thought he had crossed the line of Mercy oh this man had spent years trying to get saved his wife had gone to a meeting and got saved and received the Holy Ghost and here he was trying to get saved and he he couldn't so he came to brother Branham and told him that he had crossed the line to where he couldn't get saved and the old man the prophet looks at him and says oh I don't know about that I'm so glad brother Brown wasn't a legalist this man had went to Billy Graham's meeting and at the end of the service they asked those that to raise their hand who wanted to be saved so he raised his hand went down to the altar they took him into a room and told him he needed to accept Jesus he got down on his knees and prayed they asked him you believe in Jesus Christ and he said he did and that he accepted him as his personal savior they told him well then you're saved but this man told Brother Brown and said nothing had happened nothing's happened so a couple years later he went to the three free not the three free Methodist people and they told him you know that he had to get happy enough to shout so he says you know ah they begin to pray over me and he said I got I got happy to where I started shouting they told me I got it see yachten got it and sanctification all he said but when I left he said I just I still didn't have it he said I you know and so then he goes to a Robert's meeting so he take him into another room and they tell him well you know if you to receive the Holy Ghost you got to speak in tongues or he ain't got it so they prayed over him until he spoke in tongues they said oh you got it now he said but when I left the meeting he said I didn't have it right you know and and so he says I don't know what to do now he's coming to brother Branham he said I've been to Shreveport down to Shreveport the voice of healing they told me that you was a prophet to come up here and you'd be able to reveal to me when the spirit come on you what was my trouble now listen to what brother Brown's saying he says he said see this man's telling him well you're a prophet so now you can reveal to me my trouble and brother Branham notice the answer brother you don't have to be a prophet to do that the word of God settles that sometimes we think we need a prophet oh brother Brandon was here you know then I'd know no I mean here is a man that is expressing to brother Brown I've crossed the line I can't get help but here's your Prophet could you tell me red Brown says you don't need me the word tells you and and so he says you don't have to be a prophet of that I it don't need a prophecy the only thing is you're just confused how many confused people are today by all kinds of nonsense that's been in the past and you know teachers preachers whatever and they just confuse the people notice what brother Brandon starts doing brother Branham asking did you always love the Lord Jesus the man said well I've always belonged to the Presbyterian Church brother Branham asked him what happened what took place then that you changed your mind all at once he said well my wife went down to the Pentecostals and she got the spirit and she come back up and said she was happy brother Branham asked him said well what did you think about that did you criticize it he said no he said I just thought well I'll see how it lasts and said it went on and she seemed to have it the man said one day I was coming in for making a cell out in the yard and I happened to reach in my pocket and somebody had given me a little track and said I sit down in the office begin to read this track and said the awfullest feeling come over me that I ought to get right with God and he said I've been searching ever since brother Branham asked him when this feeling came over you you've never been able to get out of it he said no sir I haven't notice the answer well that's when you receive Christ what when Christ knocking at your door and you yielded to it that's when you found him that's when you received him he said see it doesn't mean raising up your hands that's all right speaking in tongues that's all right shouting that's all right but that's the attributes of Christ after he comes in to receive Christ is to receive the person Christ Jesus to receive him is alive outing speaking in tongues all these things they're all just demonstrations that's the attributes that follows this but first is to receive Christ the man said then brother Branham I've been saved all the time remember the brown said sure do you love him he said with all my heart run around and said well one time you didn't love him that's right now you love him yes that's true well you had him all the time then and the man jumped off the porch began crying holding brother Branham in his arms said oh God I've been a Christian all this time not the natural It's Supernatural nothing that a man can work up it's what God does your new creation can you say man do you love him this body of Believers no church puts you in and no church puts you out no family put you in no family can put you out no prophecy can put you in and no prophecy can put you out remember that little lady on that vision of the uh of the video red Brown said then they calling you a witch didn't a preacher even call her that or something like that prophesied over her and hear all them years she was so messed up in her mind because that preacher and then called her a witch where the Prophet said oh no that's not it don't you even worry about all that that's a lie is that all it is your nerves messed up thank God for a prophet to give us the correct interpretation of God's mind you love him if the musicians will come we just sing that little song without him I can do nothing you feel that way this morning without him [Music] I can do nothing without him I'd surely fail without him I would drifting deep but in Jesus Jesus [Music] it's Jesus [Music] do you know [Music] you know today please don't turn here [Music] Jesus Jesus without him helps I would be all sing it now without him [Music] I would be nothing without you I'd surely fail [Music] without him I would be dying but in Jesus thank God foreign [Music] without him I would be one more time I know it's [Music] cheap [Music] please don't turn him oh listen to his eyes Jesus my Jesus [Music] I would be is that the way you feel Hallelujah there's that song I can't even walk without you holding my hand in mountains too high [Music] The Valleys too
