we have several that's not feeling well today and so we want to keep them in our prayer that the Lord will just touch them and um um brother [Music] Andrew asked me to greet you all and um sends his love here to the church and we certainly love and appreciate apprciate brother Andrew Sister Mariah and the um we were looking at some old pictures last night Faith uh got to looking at some pictures and and uh just brought back some memories of um when we were helping them move uh here uh they in from West Virginia and um but anyways we're you know it's good that we got memories huh and uh Satan tries to use the memory for his Purp purpose but uh God gave us a memory that we could not only just reflect upon his word but we could reflect upon the uh the years of just good fellowship with the saints of God Amen the book of Exodus the uh 23rd chapter and we look at the 20th verse here says behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared beware of him and behold and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him uh but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak uh then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary unto uh th my adversaries and uh for My Angel shall be go shall go before thee and bring thee in unto the amorites the Hittites the perizzites the Canaanites the hivites the jebusites and I will cut them off amen then if you'll turn with me to the Book of Psalms the 46th chapter we'd read this um uh Wednesday night praise the Lord Psalms the 46th chapter going to read the start at the first verse amen but it says God is our refuge and strength a very present help and trouble therefore will not we fear through the Earth or though the Earth be removed though the mountains be carried buried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof Roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof salal there is a river the streams uh whereof shall make glad the city of God the holy place of the Tabernacles of the most high God is in the midst of her she shall not be moved God shall help her and that right early I looked up that where it says and that right early and the uh commentators and as well as the Amplified Bible says at the breaking of dawn the breaking of the day God shall help her at the breaking of the day the rising of the sun and the Heathen raged and the kingdoms were moving moved he uttered his voice and the Earth melted the Lord of hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge amen could we just bow our heads in word of prayer father we have come to you today as Mortals Lord realizing our insufficiency see Lord our helplessness father for how could we stand in a world that is so evil that is falling apart and yet not be identified with that it's your grace it's your mercy and we humbly bow our hearts to you in thanks and in reverence for what you have done for us in our continuing to do father we believe you've called us this morning together Lord that you may be with us and you may speak to us father and that's our desire is that you would speak to us Lord and uh help me to get myself out of the way God and anoint these lips of clay Lord and most of all anoint our hearts to receive of you we ask it father we pray that you meet meet the needs of your people in Jesus Christ's name amen you can have your seats this morning we can't say it enough um I guess and really no need to say it because we see it in by every day but we are living in a troubled World a time of trouble um and we know it's not just a passing thing RI it's really good to have you this morning thought you'd sneak in but you couldn't amen we sure love brother shamiah and sister Bethany amen and um but the um the the trouble that is here is not just a passing thing it's not just a season it's not just an age but we we realize that it's uh tribulation is setting in and um uh the trouble that we are seeing is is prophecy being fulfilled it's the end of not just an age but it's the end of time the end of uh civilization as we would know it is the end of all things the end of political power religious power it's the end of governments and uh and tribulation is setting in it's a time of trouble that no man has seen this Earth has never seen um of what is coming and um it's uh uh it's a it's a time of trouble that really you cannot even fathom them um and um you know when when you hear the word uh the when you read the Bible and it talks about such a time has never been and then you read the history of atrocities and things that have happened Through The Years you think how how how worse could it get how what is this and and I you know you really can't describe it um but we we just know that the Bible says it will be a a time of trouble as like never before and we're we're starting to see the manifestation of what is is uh fixing to uh be fullblown uh and and of course the prophet had talked about of how that man would go completely insane to where uh they will um see birds uh you know uh six blocks I think or city block or something to that with wings that that long and and uh but it'll all be in their minds they it'll just be an imagination um uh be Locust rise up out of the Earth with long hair to torment women that have cut their hair and um uh so so it's but it's all in their mind and of course Hollywood is preparing the hearts uh the the minds and we're seeing that people are going mentally uh insane it's it's a mental it's a mental thing it's a mental breakdown and it's it's happening more and more and so we this is is something that the doctors will never be able to fix psychiatrists psychologist whatever can't can't fix uh because this has been prophesied for the last days and a time of tribulation and so the world is getting in the spirit of the last days as the prophet would tell us in in the 60s of uh that it's preparing and of course the comic books and and and we could even say the movies and and uh these things are preparing this the world has been being prepared it's for this time and we're looking at a generation that is so wacko it's uh in their beliefs and uh kind of interesting you know they've got a a transgender that got voted in to the White House and and of course um uh you know he's he's uh I guess expected to use the uh wants to use the women's restroom and and and so you've got a republican woman that is saying no you know that that don't need to be we ain't going to tolerate that and and of course she's trying to pass the law they then you've got the the AOC you know the liberal lady that is saying well for her to do that that's endangering women you know and and you know H how can a transgender endanger women you know or or or you know not having a transgender in the women's bathroom endanger women but that's just how insane that that they're coming it's and and they truly believe this stuff they they truly believe that a man be a woman and and uh putting you know uh women's uh uh uh things in men's bathrooms and and things like that and you're just like you know but what what it is the world has been getting in the spirit all this time for the last days and it's been it's been Hollywood it's it's been all of the things that have been preparing the people's minds for this and and uh uh brother brandom said the comic books are preparing the children's mind for the blast that he's going to give them and brother it's here uh and and so but yet in in all of this it you know uh Romans uh 15 and9 it tells us that whatsoever things were written a four time were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope and and and so what God has written in this in these scriptures is not for to be debated it's it's not for us to to to look at it and and and and say well I just can't believe that it's it's it's written for our comfort it's written for our learning and for our comfort that we might have hope so this morning we when in our in our scriptures that we have read we are comforted in these things because because we we we read that he is a present help in time of trouble uh he is a present help God knew that we were coming to this day he knew that it would be so evil and so so uh uh vile he knew that the troubles was coming for he already said that men's Hearts would be failing them for fear speaking of this day but then he would ra put in the scriptures that he would be a present help in in trouble amen and and therefore we will not fear you understand that church we will not fear that's the reaction of the elect of God when we understand that he is the present help in the time of trouble when the fear is gripping the hearts of men to where they're failing and and they don't know what to do and and they're at a at uh the politicians and the brightest minds and and and and and the government and the churches and and all these things don't know what to do uh uh and they're trying to stop what is coming but they can't stop it because it's already been promised God's already prophesied and his word cannot fail you understand that and so we're not getting into this in into the the spirit of the last days trying to fix problems that cannot be fixed but we do find comfort in the fact that he is our present help in time of trouble amen and so that spirit of fear cannot grip our hearts and even though it does try now we understand that there are two spirits in the world today and and again you know I I I thank God every day for a prophet can't thank him enough for sending me a prophet uh uh you know and and more and more I understand why brother brandham said for God to send a prophit Amen to a people it's Grace to that people and I say Amazing Grace it's been Grace that God would send a Prophet amen and he would this Prophet by his through his message and through divine order of God he would expose the spirit that was in in in the world the two spirits and and them two Spirits is one of them is the spirit of God and the other is the spirit of Satan and and according to First John 4:6 uh God is the spirit of Truth and Satan is the spirit of error amen God is the spirit of Truth and and Satan is the spirit of error now now we're looking at God uh and and and and I I maybe just we we we're here talking of he is a present help in time of trouble and and and we want to know who he is right amen see and and so uh we we don't want to mistake the spirit of air as being God and being a present help in time of trouble because the spirit of air will take you in destroy you amen so the so so God uh he's the spirit of Truth and and and John 1 one tells us that the word is God ain't that right and then Jesus in praying to the father said Thy word is truth Thy word is truth amen so therefore God being the word is the spirit of Truth amen God being the word is the spirit of Truth so we could say that the word is is a present help in time of trouble and we could say the spirit of Truth amen is a is a present help in time of trouble can you say Amen it's not just the spirit it's not just the feeling it's not just an emotion that's our help in time of trouble amen because that's what the Pentecostals thought amen they taught us they showed us they tried to get us to to understand that it was emotions that was your help it was Sensation that was was your help it was some prophecy that was your help it was some some gift to tongues that was your help that's not true amen because we know that the spirit of air can do all of them things amen but the the the spirit of Truth is a present help in the time of trouble amen see the word is a present help in the time of trouble and we can just say it the word for our age is a present help in the time of trouble amen that's right see so now now you know we we automatically picture God and and I say we the just Humanity uh uh picture God as being good and and and Satan uh uh as being uh Pure Evil and and that is true he he is evil God is good and there there is no sin found in God there is no evil found in God but but and and and and we find that John 10:10 Jesus gives the the uh shows a difference between the Satan and and and and and him God uh the thief cometh not but for to steal to kill and to destroy so he's not your present help in time of trouble he's come to steal to kill and to destroy but he says I am come and we know this is God made flesh I am come the word made flesh the spirit of truth I'm come that you may have life and have it more abundantly so these two Spirits are roing in the land today one is to kill to steal and to destroy and another spirit is here a present help in the time of trouble to give life and that you may have it more abundantly amen see and so uh uh uh so we we understand that one is good and one is bad one is to give life one is to kill steal and destroy but then Jesus said in the Book of Matthew that the spirits the spirits would be so close that it would deceive the elect amen if it was possible amen they would look close alike the uh uh to where it would be hard to tell the difference and actually the only ones that'll be able to tell the difference is the elect amen and and so then in 2 Thessalonians 2:4 Paul tells us that that Satan the spirit of air the one that is trying to kill to steal and to destroy notice he opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God in other words he opposeth and exalteth himself above all the word can you say Amen everything that God is trying to do amen Satan is opposing it and exalting himself above it amen or that is called God or that is worship so that he as God sth in the temple of God Amen showing himself that he is God Amen so this evil one this this Spirit of air is actually showing himself that he is God he sits in the church he preaches the gospel he sings the songs of Zion and yet he is a spirit that is trying to kill steal and to dest destroy amen so close that it would be deceive the elect if possible now we read in Isaiah 1413 that Satan the very Heart Of Satan the very core of Satan he said it in his heart I will sin above the clouds and I will be like the most high I will be like the most high and he said he'll sit above the stars of God the sons of God is what the the interpretation as the sons of God he he will he he's going to he determined that he will dictate the sons of God he he is dictated that he will be the ones that that that sits above the star the sons of God and Rule and uh but but uh that but the the Bible says how art thou Fallen oh Lucifer can you say Amen so so now only God everybody say only God is a present help in time of trouble only God Amen only that word Vindicated word uh word for the age is a present help in time of trouble no wonder Satan is attacking this message amen and I say to any of you if y'all if y'all hear of this uh uh you y'all get sent of these things of negativity don't listen to it amen don't don't don't give don't click on them things don't listen to that stuff I told my wife I'm not I'm not interested in all the negative about this message I am not trying to find answers I've already got the answer amen God's already gave me the answer God's already said it's true I don't care what the naysayer says so if someone sends you a link of all the negative just just say I'm not interested don't listen to it don't just just you don't want negative in your mind you want to think upon the positive God's done everything he can to give the positive in your mind that this message is right is true you don't need to look at anything else can you say amen that's right see and that's too amen I like what Jack Duff said brother Jack Duff amen someone sent it and I sent it to my family amen but he says you know he said the answer I've got Amen to talk to tell these guys that are talking negative about this message amen he says I'm not interested about a bridge I'm not interested about what brother Bram said about all these things and trying to prove all this he says all I got to say is sech the way Jesus told the Skeptics of his day search the scriptures search the scriptures can you say in anyone can put things up on Google anyone can put things on YouTube anyone can do what your answer is in the scripture search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but they testify of what that message is they testify of the messenger amen they testify we're not wondering about him we know what the Bible says it is the seventh angel messenger it is Malachi 4 it is a amen a Vindicated prophet of God Amen to bring the message and I am part of that elect can you say amen amen that's right see amen I already know who he is and I'm just discovering who I am ain't that right amen so we we look that only God is a present help in time of trouble he is the only one who has the power to restore to save to deliver and to heal amen so what is God God is Supernatural how many believes that God is Supernatural and and and we've talked about it before but Supernatural transcends the natural amen uh uh it goes beyond the limits in other words of the natural amen it exceeds any restriction the natural has amen every man is is is limited in what he can do even you are limited in what you can do you're limited in your natural ability and I'll say it this way you are even Limited in to fulfill the word of God god without the supernatural there is no way that you can overcome your trials without the supernatural there is no way amen that you can even believe this message amen without the supernatural so God is Supernatural so what thing natural thing can heal you there's nothing amen what natural thing can raise the dead there's nothing what natural thing can change an old man and an old woman back to their youth again there's nothing amen what natural thing can bring something into existence that was not there amen there's nothing amen see so but but when we think of God well God is Supernatural he's the one that can heal he's the one that can raise the dead he's the one that can change amen an old man back to his youth again he's the one that can bring uh something amen that was nothing and bring it into existence amen for he is Supernatural can you say amen I just want you to know what kind of present help he is to you in the time of trouble God is Supernatural and he's not bound to you he's not limited to your trouble he's not limited to what professional say he's not limited to what medical science says he's not limited to what a doctor of divinity says he is Supernatural and he is your present help in the time of your trouble right God is Supernatural he can work miracles because he's Supernatural do you believe that amen what is a miracle it's something that exceeds the limits of the natural here is the natural amen and when the natural says it cannot be done anymore it's over it's finished it's it's settled amen then the supernatural comes on the scene and and and defies everything that the natural just told you amen and makes it possible that's right amen see and so now we find amen that God is a present help in the time of trouble amen but to see him to see him you have to look for the supernatural can you say Amen to see him you have to to to to to look for the supernatural to walk with him you have to walk with the supernatural to believe in him you have to believe in the Supernatural see not everything is natural we live in a natural and a supernatural world at the same time amen you know natural human beings are here amen but the angels of God are here as well how many believes that we believe that Jesus Christ is present Among Us now for he is a present hell you know it's sad to to to see that God there there's so many people billions and billions of people that really don't know God they claim to serve him but they don't know him amen and and so how can a person truly know uh serve God and not know him amen and and I'm talking about knowing him I'm not talking about going to a seminar even coming to church and having a little lesson about God and to where you can go one you know just at 1 2 3 4 You know and know all the the the basics of God and and all of these things I'm talking about when knowing him I'm talking about experiencing him him amen a lot of people say they they they serving God but they've never experienced him amen see and and so knowing him by experience how can a person worship Him and and and not believe in him no no wonder they they the prophet said they're thinking they think they're worshiping God but they're actually worshiping the devil amen see so so they're say they they're worshiping God Amen but but but they don't believe in him because they don't believe in the supernatural amen see amen and and so they they may believe in his existence but they don't believe him to be what he really is is is Supernatural so they they unconsciously believe that God uh uh uh has limitations as though he was something natural amen that's why they fall apart amen when it seems like they're going to die when it seems like they're at their their their their their their wits end uh on things and their back is against the wall then all of a sudden they just start falling apart and and I'm telling you it's easy to fall aart amen when you get bad news that you're going to die amen it's easy all of a sudden for fear to grip and and you think oh no what am I going to do what what's my best surgeon what's my best remedy what's this what's you know but but but here God is a present help in the time of trouble can you say amen amen see and and and we're not against doctors we're not against all these things but they're not the final answer amen they're not the final verdict that no doctor can give you a final verdict amen and until God see God's the one that gives the final verdict God's the one that moves he's the last one Amen to move on the scene can you say Amen if we could say it that way amen so we we we see that natural men in their professional careers amen carry more weight today in their estimations their opinions and agnosis than the supernatural God God that does in his own word amen it it seems that the Professionals in their opinions and their diagnosis and and and and their professionalism amen they carry more weight amen uh uh uh concerning us and what they think and what they say and what they do and and about us and all these things then God does in his own word oh my that's exactly right there is no word that is an absolute this is the word that is the absolute this is the only word amen that has the final say so how many believes that the doctor can say something it's a professional opinion but you just know that he's only a per a practicing physician but there is a great physician and that great physician has already declared in his word I'm the god that Health thee there is no weapon formed against you that's going to prosper amen this is the final word of every situation don't you fall apart when the world is turning against you and everything is is is turning against you and your back is against the wall and you don't see any way out there is a final word to it amen and that's God's word and he is a present help in the time of trouble amen that's right so we find that uh uh the church see has gotten away from the supernatural amen you see the supernatural was presented uh to them in this age amen the son of man was revealed the church kicked him out see so the Supernatural is more sensation it's more than just a good thought it's the person of God God is Supernatural his actions are Supernatural his thoughts are Supernatural his word is Supernatural do you believe that even the fruits of the spirit the prophet said is Supernatural amen you can love and and a human love it'll come to its end but then there's a supernatural love amen and how in the world can a man love his worst enemy aen that would kill him if he could and yet there's a supernatural love there amen that just keeps on and keeps on Amen it's just God God so we we find that the the supernatural was presented to the church in this age to the world Amen and they kicked him out the son of man revealed and it kicked him out so now the whole world the whole world Amen stands in a condition to where they explain away the supernatural they have their church but no Supernatural they have their choirs but no Supernatural they talk about the blood but even now they're even taking the blood out because they don't see any reality to the blood amen you there's no reality to the blood when you take the supernatural out can you say amen amen that's true you even got them explaining away the Rapture because they don't believe in a supernatural amen how how can you go in a you know even even you know years ago my cousin you know talked about Rapture and all that he's questioning about how how in the world is that going to happen amen how's if if you're going to be caught up you know then how is it that Europe here and China's down here and and he's trying to reason it away I said I don't care about all that I don't even know how to explain it all but there's going to be the Rapture because I believe the Rapture is not a natural thing it's a supernatural thing and the god that can save my soul when it was impossible I have no question I or no answers to how he could save my soul I have no answer as to how the blood amen can be so strong that God can look at me and justify me as though I never done it and see me as a sinless righteous virtuous bride of Jesus Christ but all I can say It's Supernatural it's just Supernatural it so the world has explain the supernatural away leaving them to think that the events that take place are the result of a natural [Music] happening the prophet said Egypt done that Egypt was so scientific in their learning so educated they leaned to all of that they were so Heathen in their mind and their understanding that they thought that when God parted the Red Sea amen they didn't see it as something Supernatural they thought it was something natural an earthquake or or something that took place and so they they didn't see and so brother Brown said Egypt drowned in the Red Sea because she failed to see the day and she considered the supernatural of God to be a natural thing that happened in the earth so they could not see God as being a present help they just saw it as something natural well if it's natural they crossed it we can do it but the supernatural closed that water up on them can you say amen that's right see and so we find it was actually a supernatural happening that Israel could walk on dry ground amen right between them Waters amen and there was a supernatural power holding them back do you believe that you realize what's been stopped in This World War II and this world coming to obliviation was a supernatural hand amen of God because there's somebody that needed to be sealed there was a bride that needed to be caught out can you say Amen now Church they're talking about World War I amen there there it's that is a common thing right now the nations are shaking amen they're doing everything in their power but all I can tell you it will not happen until the bride is gone the bride must happen the bride must be changed and if you don't believe in a supernatural power of God I don't know what to do amen but I'm going to tell you he is here as a present help in the time of [Applause] trouble he sure Isen oft times you know the word coincidence is used when something happens oh that was just a coincidence oh that was just luck Christians should never use that word luck that's right I like that song says don't call me lucky call me blessed amen so this word coincidence is in you know it means it just happened to be that way without Rhyme or Reason it was just by chance uh or by accident or whatever but I don't believe that things happened by chance or by coincidence I I I don't believe in coincidence I I didn't get saved by coincidence I didn't get healed by coincidence uh you know the the pain that just happened to quit it it didn't just happen to quit uh uh it was God you you know have you ever just had a little pains and you've asked God to do it he touch you and he touches you and then Satan says oh you was just imagining that or it would have really went away you didn't need to pray about that you know and and he trying to get you to reason with it but but I do remember I do remember that when I was doing some electrical work with uh men Wendell and another man in uh doing was doing a wiring a church actually and uh uh we we were had already ran our conduit and we were uh had put the wires through the conduit and I I was clipping some wires off and it it shot right in my eye and oh man it was just a little piece and it got my eye and I was trying to get it out and it wouldn't come out and uh I couldn't even open my eye we were uh an hour away from from home and so worked throughout that day and you know I was laying in the truck there just my eye just kept watering and I it just hurting so bad and I didn't want to go to the doctor and it wasn't that I was against doctors I just you know uh maybe young and dumb I don't know but I I didn't go but I sitting there just in pain and there's a song that um uh well a Baptist preacher uh uh sings it and and it's uh called without be made whole uh than Believe In Christ and all of a sudden that that song just kept playing in my mind without be made whole then Believe In Christ without be made whole then Believe In Christ and and so I said Lord I said I don't know if that's you or not but but I said I I do believe in you and and I know that you could take this pain away right now and I'm asking that you will and the pain left I mean it was gone you know now of course Satan was trying to say well that's just your imagination all that I said no that wasn't my imagination I mean the water was running my eye was red and it cleared up it was when I moved up here when I'm just a little bit after I moved up here one day something protruded out of my eyelid and I pulled that out and there was that copper wire that was that come out of my eyelid and I said Satan see that wasn't coincidence that was a supernatural hand of God that was a present help in the time of trouble so see so so when when healing takes place uh it's not by accident see we I I didn't just happen to start breathing again when I was just a baby and my breath the breath left the body and and and the mom ran me up you ran up carrying me to the church uh to the platform here in uh uh there in Oklahoma and and saying pray pray and the church began to began to pray and a a breath come back into the body and that I just didn't that wasn't coincidence that was a supernatural something Supernatural how how many's ever had Supernatural touch in your life see it is an accident it leaves doctors baffled because they'll tell you something and then God does something totally opposite and I just love proven to the devil that God's still living I just love to show the doctors that that I I appreciate what you say I appreciate every effort but there's a God that I serve that my end ain't over yet can you say amen that's right say it's you know uh uh uh so so uh Faith uh you know she she had two uh uh she had a bump rise in her hand and she said Dad show show the uh she said feel that and I felt it looked like a bone or something in her hand and she said that really hurts and and uh she I said what did you do she said I don't know she it just just popped up and so then the next day she's come back from work and she said dad say another another's happened as and so she showed it to me and and just hard and she said it just really hurts uh uh you know and and uh uh and and so she she uh after Wednesday night actually when we got I got home and she said dad would you y'all pray so we as a just gathered around we began to pray that God you know I told her said well you ought to go to the chiropractor and she said well I've got it scheduled uh but uh uh she says but it's going to be for next Tuesday or so and she said but just would you pray I said well yeah we'll pray so we just began to pray and the next day she she showed me she's dad them them knots are gone and she said it's still sore but she said I'm just praising God you know I'm just praising God and and Friday night I think it was Friday night uh that she's up there uh painting her hallway and and she said just dawn on me I ain't got pain in my hand no more amen you see just the little things amen that God is Supernatural he's a present help in the time of trouble can you say amen amen God is a present help so it's a supernatural happening amen and now you know the Supernatural is what blinds the unbeliever brother brandom actually says it makes them worse the supernatural makes the people worse amen because it blinds them and he says this that's why today the message blinds the people so much is because they're not used to seeing the supernatural see it's not just a man message if it was just a message like a a a Baptist or a Pentecostal or whatever people would readily accept this amen but see it's a supernatural message amen it it didn't come from brother brandham amen that's why God had his picture taken this is God's message you understand that God ain't vindicating some man and saying oh follow that man that's not the point it's God saying I'm the one that's speaking this is my voice this is my word this is my message it's supernatural can you say amen and the message is the son of man revealed amen now notice in Luke 21:25 and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring amen see men's Hearts failing them for fear and for look and for looking after those things which are come coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and we can say Amen it's happening this day this scripture is being fulfilled amen and then they shall see the son of man coming in a cloud with power not religious power not political power Supernatural power can you say Amen they shall see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great Glory now we know what them that cloud is now it wasn't a natural Thunderhead it was a cloud of seven angels ain't that right amen sure enough was amen and you know what's amazing is when that picture come out brother Ed Hunter uh he said you know when that picture out he said man we were all excited about this wondering what it was and and he said we trying to figure it all out in our mind now what is this you know and they all had the magazines out in the parking lot before church and and they were all talking it was just a big deal and then brother brandham comes and rising of the sun I believe it was and and he says I wondered about this and he said the angel of the Lord told me turn it to your right and he said now they're all sitting there Ed Hunter said we're all sitting there wondering what this was you know what significance and when brother brandham said it you said you and and he and they turned it to the right and he said you could just hear the gasp in the audio you know like wow amen it dawned on them that this was more than just a rocket smoke from a rocket this was more than just whatever this was something Supernatural and then brother Brandon began to point out Christ in that picture can you say amen and tell us tell them tell us amen that this was the Supreme judge and he has come with power he's the one that has the final say on your life he's the one that has the final say on your situation amen when it looks like it's hopeless when it looks like everything is going down the drain amen the judge has stepped forward and he's shown that he is a present help in the time of trouble you don't have to fear you don't have to worry you don't have to be filled with anxiety there is a God that is here for you Amen to declare to you you are healed you are worthy everything's going to be all right praise the Lord you don't have to worry about it can you say amen amen and think of it he came in the time of trouble yes he came at the time of trouble when people are losing their minds and having mental breakdowns he came in the time of trouble and the Messiah sign was done in this day to declare his presence brother Brown said it that's what it's done for is to declare his presence a Vindication of him being here do you love him is that not what God done in the body of MDC when he stood before Abraham that day he declared himself as God before for Abraham by the Messiah sign where is Sarah thy wife she's in the tent behind you why did she laugh and Sarah says I didn't laugh and he said oh yes you did laugh amen what was it there was a supernatural God that was taking and reading her mind reading her thoughts and telling her exactly what she thought about what was it it was a sign that God was standing there in a body of Flesh yes siren huah Jesus showed that that the same God that appeared to Abraham was on the earth in his day amen remember he told the woman at the well amen all the things that she had done who she was and who she had been living with and d d d see and she immediately recognized that God was standing there in flesh can you say amen and I have to tell you that same Supernatural sign was done in this day amen Church that wasn't just a coincidence that isn't just something a man can do amen even his Skeptics say that not one time did he miss it not one time did he fail oh yeah they can laugh and they can have their news media and all that today amen he's been long gone he's dead and and and you got the Skeptics amen but the people that were sitting in that meeting amen his that didn't even believe his teaching didn't even believe all that would tell you that the the discernment was real there was no mistake in it it was perfect every time why it was God Amen showing himself he's here in the time of trouble trouble on every hand the world is about to blow amen but we have seen the supernatural sign and I don't know about you but I believe he's here amen isn't it wonderful amen you'll go listen to the message Supernatural the supernatural brother Brown tells us that it takes the right atmosphere to see the supernatural can you say amen amen amen that's right look at the kind of atmosphere the world has created by their unbelief yeah the so-called Christian will readily accept some formalistic teaching and some formalistic worship but he cannot accept the supernatural amen and so brother brand says now the idea of a real believer today is one who loves the Lord goes to church every Sunday Pays His dues to the church treats his neighbors right he said but that's just moral acts you can do that and well still go to hell that that that that has nothing to do with it amen that of course you should do that as a good citizen right but that's just moral acts see but that's the idea of a real believer today oh he goes to church he's a Believer he's saved you know he he treats his neighbors right he goes to church every Sunday Pays His dues Pays His tithes and offerings and and helps in the church he's a worker in the church and all these things that guy's a real believer brother Brown said that's just moral act he said another place a man that's born again everybody say that's born again hungers say it with me hungers for the Supernatural and the power of the Living God not satisfied just sitting on a a bench not just satisfied going to church every Sunday not satisfied just playing the tapes amen not satisfied with just saying amen amen not satisfied just knowing what the Bible is but a man that is really born again hungers amen for the Supernatural and for the Living God I will not stop uh amen you understand what I'm saying it ain't time to get discouraged church when the when the storms are there when the when the trials are there it's not time to wield it's time to hunger God I want to see you move if you are Supernatural I know you are and I know you're here letting you move in my situation hunger now notice brother brandham also said where the Supernatural is demonstrated there is where the Eagles of God are gathered not gathered around the good intellectual sermon not gathered around a good beautiful choir and professional musicians but gathered around where the Supernatural is demonstrated because the Eagles of God believe in the Supernatural amen that's why we don't question God we don't limit God because we've experienced the super natural if you're going to limit God to your healing how in the world can you how can you do that and not limit God to your salvation amen but I don't limit God to my salvation I don't limit God to my healing I don't limit God to anything I ain't going to limit God to my Rapture I ain't going to limit God to what he can do in me oh he's Supernatural Amen brother Ram said everything that belongs in the realm of Christianity is worked by the supernatural the nine fruits of the spirit are Supernatural if you need love joy peace if you need long suffering forbearance if you need patience if you need what see God is a present help in the time of trouble can you say Amen you say well what does that mean well you see brother Braham said only the elect will have that love oh love will only be found in the elect a amen that's true and this elect is being sorely tried amen sorely tried because he's trying to take that value away from us amen and make us just another statistic out in the world Amen but in the time of trouble God is present that Supernatural power amen can flow through you and give you that Divine love give you that Divine peace give you that Divine joy to where you don't need joy in Hollywood you don't need joy in vacation you don't need joy in money you don't need Joy you could go through the very worst dark hour and still have joy because it's something that is Supernatural brother Brown said every Shield of the believer is Supernatural prise the Lord so it is impossible to understand God the supernatural with the natural mind brother Braham said you can't explain Supernatural things you just have to believe it they tried for years to explain God through the intellectual mind intellectual reasoning and what they've done through it all at the end of it all their conclusion they've just explained it away amen and brother Brown said when you explain away the supernatural out of the Bible you're explaining away the very God that you worship can you say Amen so see God being a present help in the time of trouble you have to believe in the Supernatural you have to expect the supernatural you have to believe in it you have to anticipate it you you understand what I'm saying in other words don't don't just come to church all gloomy and and in the dumps and and act like this is you going to be your last supper and and you're just going to die no no no if you can believe amen that God is present amen God has shown himself to be present he's proved himself in a supernatural way he did not leave when a prophet left and he did not leave when you entered into your trials he's God amen amen amen so we find where there's a supernatural god brother Brown said there's going to be Supernatural things happening because he is Supernatural do you believe that sir amen so when you explain the supernatural out of the Bible you're explaining way the very God that you claim to worship then you're only serving then a god of your imagination you cannot be serving a real God worshiping a real God because he's Supernatural so then you've come down and you've you've formed a God out of your own form uh imagination well and and then that's when you can play you you know you you can limit God to whatever you want to limit to him well I I know I'm going to Rapture amen but I just I I I got this trial and I got this trouble and I got this and I just don't know I just don't and you really believe you're going in Rapture right I mean you know so God can get you in a Rapture but God can't heal you God God you you can't take God for everything that he says you understand it's because we've taken God and we formed an imagination of God it's a God that we have formed amen and we made our own little god of what we can reason and what we can believe and what if doctor says we're good then oh go glory to God we're good if the doctor says we're bad I just don't know you understand what I'm saying amen but brother brandom said if you really had perfect Faith amen and the doctor told told you Friday that you were going to die M by Monday he said You' laugh in that doctor's face why because you believe in a supernatural God yes that doctor may be telling you the truth naturally and and by all scientific rights you should be dead by Monday but there is a supernatural God that can turn the situation around and I choose to believe it he's a present help so when you serve God when people serve God of their own imagination then fear comes in worry anxiety takes hold you understand and this is exactly where the world stands today because they have taken God the supernatural out of their lives therefore they have no experience of the supernatural they're walking with their the god of their knowledge and their own imagination and they've done away with the god the real God the Supernatural that works can you say Amen but notice the prophet said God's church has always believed in the Supernatural and it's always got a fundamental Church standing over here that believes just as fundamental as they do but they deny the supernatural so there's two churches two Spirits one spirit is is controlling the fundamental Church they believe just as fundamental as this is they believe in a Rapture they believe in God they believe in this all of these saying that one has the supernatural with him and the other one has rejected the Supernatural and remember the Bible says that that the the people would have a form of godliness but would deny the power thereof can you say Amen in other words God would be there as a present help but they wouldn't believe in it they they they don't go to it they they don't accept his help they would rather accept some politician amen you love him I hope this is all right helps you did you notice that in the days of lot the supernatural had come as we had said and it was only done to the elect Abraham and Jesus said as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the revealing of the son of man where the supernatural would be made known only to that elect oh yeah there'll be other Messengers and they'll be sounding out but the real Supernatural would be done to that elect and there would be a promise God remember manifested himself as being a present help in time of trouble they could not make that promise live they could not fulfill what God promised to them but here he is now in standing before them and says I'll visit you according to the time of life I'll visit you and and this is what Sarah laughed at cuz here she's old how can I have pleasure with my Lord can you say Amen but there was a God standing there you might ask how in the world is it going to happen it ain't up for you to know just believe it he's here and he's a present help in the time of trouble can you say Amen and and Satan will get you to trying to show you all the incidents where it failed and all the in where you know and and what he don't get get you to understand is that maybe there was a doubt there was unbelief in that heart and and and and and all these things it's just like you know there there's there's one you know and and the the the negative naysayers believe they have really something to stand on and that's that's someone that was you know healed in the meeting and then eventually got sick over the same thing or whatever you you know and and and what brother Brandon actually I think it's in that Supernatural amen he was talking about it and and a preacher rose up and said see that that brandom he's a false prophet you know because that that one man he got healed and and later on he got sick of the same thing you know and uh he says you know once God heals he'd heal forever you know but see the skeptic always thinks they have a foundation amen and and and on on their arguments and all these things but if they would just only look at scriptures and brother bradam says that you know your healing lasts as long as you believe it your salvation lasts as long as you can believe it everything lasts upon your faith can you say amen and I'm going to tell you I believe there's real Believers in this building that will take God at his word regardless amen Jesus Christ no matter how you feel no matter where you're going no matter what amen God is real can you say amen I won't keep you much longer but in the Old Testament God was a present help to Israel yes sir why because Israel was God's chosen Nation among the Nations Deuteronomy 7 and6 for thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the Earth the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in numbered than any people for you were the few fewest of all people but because the Lord loved you ain't that wonderful amen if he would do that for a natural people he does that for a spiritual people amen it's not because we were Mighty it wasn't because we had real strong faith and we just had the IQ you know of Einstein or whatever it was just simply the Lord loved us can you say man and the Lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your the your fathers hath the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondman and from the hand of pharaoh king of Egypt know therefore know therefore amen he's talking to his elect know therefore that the Lord thy God he is God the faithful God which keepeth Covenant and mercy with him that love him and keep his Commandments to a thousand Generations so not only did God choose Israel that Nation for himself amen and set him them apart from uh that Nation apart from all the other nations amen but he was faithful in keeping his Covenant with them and mercy to them can you say Amen Deuteronomy 4:7 for what nation is there so great who hath God so nigh unto thee him as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon uh him for isn't that a what a question and this is God speaking to the to Israel which you good no good and well that promise or that that scripture is really for us amen see what nation what people amen for Peter said you are a peculiar people a holy nation can you say Amen what nation is there so great who have God so NY unto them as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for and what nation is there so great that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law which I set before you this day oh isin't that wonderful it was the this nation of Israel that God delivered from the hand of the Egyptians it was this nation that God had the the the angel of of the lord of the Angel of the Covenant going before them so see God was a present help to them amen uh uh uh uh because he had given them a land of inheritance he said I give unto you this land right it was a land of inheritance and so God was a present help to them and because he had made an unconditional Covenant with Abraham and his seed after him ain't that right and so when Israel was in Egypt the Bible says says there in Exodus 2:24 God heard their groaning and God remembered his Covenant with Abraham with Isaac and with Jacob and God looked upon the children of Israel and God had respect unto them who a nation that he had called for himself a nation that he had given the the made a an unconditional Covenant with and given them the land of inheritance when they begin to call upon him God began to hear and God had respect unto them not because they deserved it but because the Lord loved them the two things that the Lord cannot do he cannot change you cannot lie amen do you believe it in the beginning God had made a conditional Covenant with Adam and and Adam broke it and and any time that God has made a a conditional Covenant with man man man always fails to keep his part of the bargain ain't that right that's that's right so when God made a an unconditional Covenant with Abraham what what was he doing he he left Abraham out of the picture he put Abraham to sleep and and while God was was uh busy making the deal Abraham's asleep so Abraham had nothing to do with it just like you have nothing to do with the Covenant that God made it wasn't you God said I'll do this and you said well good I'll do this then you know I'll do my part you do your part you know no no no we couldn't do it so God makes an unconditional Covenant in with Abraham and he pledges himself to fulfill both sides of the Covenant both both parts of the Covenant can you say amen that's right so not only did he fulfilled his part in Christ amen but now he's come amen to fulfill our part in us he's a present help in the time of trouble can you say amen he come in Christ to fulfill his part but he come in US Amen to fulfill our part I'm so glad for that Christ in you everybody say Christ in Me God loves Israel and he could not change that love he made an unconditional Covenant with Abraham he could not lie throughout the Old Testament we are told that God remembered his Covenant God remembered his Covenant amen God always remembers his Covenant can you say Amen this is why God is a present help in the time of trouble it's not because you deserve it but God remembered his Covenant can you say Amen even when we don't feel worthy enough to pray God remembers his Covenant even when we don't feel worthy to worship God and to lift our hands God remembers his Covenant amen can you say Amen now Psalms 105 and8 he hath remembered his Covenant forever the word which he commanded to a thousand Generations which Covenant he made with with Abraham and his oath unto Isaac and confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law and to Israel for an Everlasting Covenant saying unto thee will I give thee uh give the land of Canaan the lot of your inheritance when they were but a few in number yay very few and strangers in it when they went from one nation to another from one Kingdom to another people and God suffered no man to do them wrong he reproved Kings for their sake saying touch not my anointed and do my prophets no harm what was it he was a present help in the time of trouble amen right Exodus 1321 the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud to lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day day nor the pillar of Fire by night from before the people and I say that's the same thing today the prophet may not be here but the pillar of fire is still here with this elect do you believe that amen God help us forever believe that and God fought their battles for them a natural people but a people that he set for himself he parted the waters for them he fed them he provided for them healed them preser their clothes their shoes even you know even when the children of Israel went into the land of Moab remember Balo was jealous of them the king and so he hired that false prophet balum to go out and curse Israel balum he goes out there and he opens his mouth to curse God would not let him do it God was a present help in time of trouble I don't even know if Israel knew what that Prophet was getting ready to do but God was on the scene and when balam opened his mouth he began to bless Israel couldn't curse him amen can you say amen and notice Moses reminded Israel of this in Deuteronomy 23:5 saying nevertheless say the Lord thy God would not hearken unto balum but the Lord thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee because the Lord thy God loved thee do you feel his love today I hope you do I love he was a present help in time of trouble if you notice when it come to the fundamental heart balum and B brother brandham shows us that they could be identified with Moses they had the same form of worship as Moses did seven altars seven Rams seven Bullocks and yada yada but brother Bram said but you see Moses being the correct prophet of God not only had the fundamental Parts but had the identification of God yeah he was in the line of duty exactly what was promised for that age not for the age of Noah but for the age then I will take you to a land that's flowing with milk and honey and they were on their way Bao and balam had no promise of such but God had given that to that Nation Israel and God was a present help to them in time of trouble no man could lay a curse to them and the world is trying to curse natural Israel today and God will will not let it happen if God will not let it happen to a natural people what do you think about a spiritual people his bride that Nation Israel is not bride they're servants what a prophet said Israel's always servant but he promised to get a bride flesh of his flesh bone of his bone power of his power life of his life out of the Gent Iles that's good so Israel was identified the prophet said with their Prophet Moses with the message of that age the characteristics of God was identified in Moses the pillar of fire was following him and he also had the atonement in action showing that the supernatural God was with them he had the atonement in action so he says he wasn't just talking about it of what will be but what is right now hello we're not just talking about what God done 50 years ago we're talking about what he's doing right now amen can you say amen and Moses had a brass serpent I'm going to let you go in a minute but he had this brass serpent hanging on a pole right lifted up the prophet said for the diseases and sickness of the people therefore Moses was practicing Divine Healing he did not have a Red Cross he did not have doctors and on hospitals that's not what he was called to do the church is not called to build hospitals and seminaries and all of these things the church is to cast out demons lay hands on the sick and they shall recover the church has greater power than even a doctor does true why Supernatural God's with us amen amen can you say Amen so therefore Moses had the atonement in action for he was practicing Divine Healing amen according to numbers 216 the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people now why why would God do that a good God as he is people don't want to look at God as being a just God because the people were murmuring and complaining against his Prophet Moses they were un UN in unbelief they they they couldn't take what Moses was trying to tell them they wouldn't they accept it they would accept everybody else but not Moses anybody that wasn't even Vindicated of God anybody that just had rose up and just had their own little message they they just follow after them but when it come to a real prophet of God they murmured and complained ain't that right and so the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and much people of Israel died therefore the people came to Moses notice the humility now and said we have sinned for we have spoken against the Lord and against thee pray un to the Lord that he take away the serpents from us and Moses prayed for the people and what do we find out the Lord was a present help in the time of trouble can you say Amen it wasn't Moses idea Amen to start practicing right then Divine Healing amen that was God's idea it was God's idea for him to set up a pole and put a breath serpent showing that every sin was already judged representing Christ to come can you say Amen see so brother Braham said Moses had the atonement see the brace the brass serpent simp symbolizing that God was in the camp amen amen amen can you say Amen now notice I want you to see here that that serpent was made of a natural material but notice what a prophet said but that piece of brass hanging on a pole was God's gift of healing to the people the brass did not have healing power in it but God he says put his gift of healing upon that surf serpent see so God is always sending the supernatural down upon on the natural can you say amen and and and and as we get I could go more and more that God has made a way not just to condens send upon a serpent not just to condescend upon natural Waters that God has made a way that he can all condescend and live in a people to show himself present not on a serpent not in a body of natural water but in a group of people God is showing himself real how many believes that God come upon prophets he moved up them prophets and the prophet said that that the prophets of old the Old Testament had a portion of God just a portion a portion the spirit of God would fall upon the natural the supernatural falling upon the natural because the word of God come to the prophets and God would show himself to be among the People by a prophet then he come in fullness in Jesus Christ now we know that Christ con he he ascended sent his Spirit there the day of Pentecost but never has it been in fullness as it is in this age the fullness of God is here again amen not in one man in a people amen called The Bride aren't you glad for that can you lift your hands unto the Lord and thank him for that we've got so much to thank God for he is a present help in the time of trouble God by this message has showed himself to be present for us in this age and now by the word us believing the word the prophet said when you believe God the word you're receiving God into your heart you receive the word you receive God into your heart and as the word grows God begins to grow the fullness of the word begins alive the fullness of God begins to come alive and become real you're not just God's not just a God to you in the healing part he's a God to you in the in the Salvation he's a God to you in Deliverance he's a God to you in providing he's a God to you in every aspect of your life I am so glad for that aren't you glad for that you know the thing of it brother Brown said the reason why people can't believe in uh the Supernatural is because they've been taught against it I am so glad that God sent a prophet and he would stand behind a Pulpit whether all these Skeptics behind him or Skeptics out there he would still declare that the supernatural God power of God is here it's real it's strong to where it would take all skepticism and unbelief out of our hearts to where we could accept the Mighty God that is present in time of trouble if the musicians will come God bless you I love the Lord I love him with all of my heart great he is amen amen amen don't fear little bride amen don't worry don't worry don't let fear get you yes sir don't let worry and anxi to be part of your life amen you tell that devil to leave can you say amen it's time to start talking this word I just believe it it's time to start talking the word it's time to start living this word we've heard this word in and day and day and day out day in day out there we go amen we've heard it constantly for years how many's been in the message for for a long time you've been in the message for a while you know well some of us have and and you've been in the message well I'll say it this way if you've been in the mess of 6 months you should know enough of this message to know how to defeat the Devil that's just plain as day don't let the devil have his way in your mind don't you let him build fear you've got now you've got the weapon use it start talking even Jesus had to talk to that old devil get the behind true can you say Amen anything that's trying to keep you from the promise of God that is the devil the Bible says he's not given us a spirit of fear God ha not given us a spirit of fear so then when fear is coming you know that's of the devil but you also know that God is a present help in the time of trouble God is in his word you start speaking that word become the channel for the word of God to flow through don't let the devil use your mind don't let him use your mouth don't let your actions become subject to his spirit [Music] bless the name of the Lord what song here he is here amen he is here oh I Will Bless do you have it within you to bless his name Glory Glory Glory Glory [Music] Glory he is [Music] here you will never be I I'm going to read this it's going to be be a little lengthy but just place softly that song he is here in 2 Chronicles 20 and 23 it tells us that the children of Moab and the children of Amon and others came against Jehoshaphat to war against them and the 23rd verse it says the children of Amon and Moab stood up up against the inhabitants of Mount seir utterly to slay and Destroy them that was the intent of the enemy to wipe them from the face of the [Music] Earth and if you notice that when Jehoshaphat he heard that there was a great multitude coming against him he feared and he set himself to seek the Lord amen now I think that's where we ought to come to when trouble is coming you ought to sit down you ought to determine to seek the Lord set yourself to seek the Lord God the enemy is determined to destroy me determined to destroy my family it's determined to destroy my spouse my children it's determined that God your word said now I can't handle it I can't do it it's too Beyond me so this is what Jehoshaphat done he determined to set the Lord and so see instead of letting fear take a hold and letting anxiety dictate him see he set himself to seek the Lord until he could find that Blessed Assurance in his heart then the fourth verse Chronicles there uh uh 20 he said and Judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the Lord even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the Lord and Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of the Lord before the new court and said oh Lord God of our fathers are not thou God in heaven and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the Heathen see acknowledging God yeah and in thine hand is there not power and might so that none is able to withstand thee art thou not are not thou Our God who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy People Israel and gave it to the Seed of Abraham thy friend forever and they dwelt therein and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name saying if when evil cometh upon us as the sword judgment or pestilence or famine we stand before this house and in thy presence for thy name is in this house and cry unto thee in our Affliction then thou will hear and help now behold the children of Aon and Moab and mount seir uh uh whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt but they've turned from them and destroyed them not behold I say how they reward us see to come to cast us out of thy possession which thou Hast given us to inheritance see oh Our God wilt thou not judge them for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us neither know we what to do but our eyes are upon thee then if you go to the 15th verse it tells us that the spirit of the Lord Came Upon jahaziel I don't know if that's the right pronunciation and he said hearken ye all Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem and Thou King Jehoshaphat thus say the Lord unto you be Not Afraid nor dismay by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but it's God's amen you go down to the 17th verse God's still speaking you shall not need to fight this in this battle set yourselves stand ye still and see the salvation of the Lord with you oh Judah and Jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out against them for the Lord will be with you notice notice when it's really Revelation struck Jehoshaphat and Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground ground in all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the Lord worshiping the Lord church I think it's time we worship the Lord he's present with us he's already told us we can't fail he's already told us no weapon formed against us is going to prosper is not this King lamb worship time is that not what brother brandham said that when the seals was open and the lamb showed himself to be the mighty conqueror showed himself to be worthy opened the book of redemption loosening the seals and John began to worship All Creatures began to worship and brother Bram said it was King lamb worship it was time for King lamb worship get out of your grumbles get out of your doubt get out of your fear look what the lamb has done for us he showed himself to be with us it's time for worship do you believe that yes sir he's redeemed us and notice that 20th verse and they Rose early in the morning and went forth Into the Wilderness of uh teoa and as they went forth Jehoshaphat stood and said hear me oh jeru Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem believe in the Lord your God so shall ye be established believe His prophets so shall ye prosper Prosper don't you let any spirit unbelieving Spirit take you from this message and when he had consulted with the people he appointed singers unto the Lord that and that should praise with the beauty of Holiness as they went out before the Army and to say praise the Lord for his mercy endureth forever I think sometime when you're facing that enemy just start worshiping God start praising start thanking God for the Victory and when they began to sing and to praise the Lord said ambushments in other words the Supernatural come on the scene and the Lord set ambushments against the children of Amon Moab and mount seir which were come against Judah and they were smitten can you say Amen 24th verse and when Judah came toward the Watchtower in the wilderness they looked unto the multitude and behold there were dead they were dead bodies Fallen to the Earth and none escaped Hallelujah can you say Amen not you that's going to be defeated your enemy is going to be defeated he is a present help in the time of trouble he is here heyen he is here holy holy I will bless his name again he is here listen closely hear him calling out your name he is here you can touch him you will never be can we just sing he was there all the time he was there all the [Music] time he was there all the day waiting ply
