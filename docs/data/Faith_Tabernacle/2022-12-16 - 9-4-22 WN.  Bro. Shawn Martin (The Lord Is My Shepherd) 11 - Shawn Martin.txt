========================================

[Music] you have called me I will answer [Music] Lead Me Lord I'll sing it one more time [Music] I will follow [Music] Lead Me Lord I will go you have called me I will answer Meet Me Lord oh you have called me and I will laugh [Music] will go well is that your heart's desire amen I believe he's leading a people in this age amen and very few amen that he's leading but there's a group of people that is being led by him and is is just giving their lives over to him and letting him have the preeminence and I'm so glad for that amen it's good to be here in the house of the Lord how the musicians can be dismissed the um it's good to have those who were gone over the weekend uh back with us and the ones that were sick and also my mother-in-law is good to have my mother-in-law with this you'll be here for a few days and I got in last year I guess yesterday evening and so we're glad to have her a man always uh good to have my mother-in-law praise the Lord and good to see brother Steve sister Elizabeth here amen as well and um brother Josiah and his family and Judah back from Oklahoma and heard they just had some outstanding meetings praise the Lord amen and brother Chad God bless you amen I overlooked you everybody back there pointing and I'm like good to have you amen praise the Lord and also just to remind you about about our fall festival we're going to be having that on November the 6th and um we're going to be having it at Camp Christie and I'm thinking about even having service there cam Christie um having service that Sunday morning and then um just making a day out of it different ones from out of town have expressed their desire to to come and so uh but we're looking forward to a wonderful time I've asked brother Diego um I don't know his last name but uh he's from a pastor from Indiana to minister that day and so Lord willing brother Diego will be with us at that time to minister and so he's just a wonderful brother you all I know y'all would remember him because he's been coming the past couple times to our meetings and as sung I think both both times but uh just a good brother and got a good report among the uh the Believers and so we appreciate that also brother Andrew had just texted me down there asking me to greet the church and so I thought I guess we'll pass that along a man he's ministering there in Claremore Oklahoma at brother Bryce's this evening and so I'm just praying for him that they have a wonderful time in the Lord if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the Book of Psalms the 23rd chapter and um we've been studying from this uh speaking on this chapter for a while and I pray that it's been a blessing to you and it's certainly I've enjoyed studying it but uh we can look at Psalms 23 and we'll start at the the first verse it says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still Waters he everybody say he restoreth my soul amen let's just bow our heads and talk to our Lord father truly it's our heart's desire that you would come and lead us and take us Lord we're no man can can take us that even a preacher can't take us there's no one Lord like you that could lead us and father we know that your leading is right it's truth it's and Lord ultimately you're leading us back to home or be no sin no sorrow and oh God I pray that you would just help us Lord anoint us tonight father give us your spirit let there be a liberty God not only for me to be able to speak but Lord that you would anoint your people Lord their hearts their ears to hear to understand Lord may you have the preeminence in this service father is our prayer father we realize that time is so short and we want to make it every second of Our Lives count we want to do it for you Lord we want to live for you we want to Lord whatever you would want us to do we want to do it Lord father we love you in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen you can have your seeds tonight I want to to deal with the first part of this third verse he restoreth my soul and I believe that God is in the restoring business you believe that Amen in the restoring business and uh acts 321 tells us that there is to be a time of refreshing and a a time of restoration of all things and both of these are to happen at the same time and Paul I believe he's the one that wrote it in Acts but says that both of these happens when he sends Jesus Christ uh and and we know that Jesus Christ has come not according to what the world the the main tradition the traditional thought uh but we believe that Christ has made his dissension according to Revelations um uh ten and one and first Thessalonians 4 16. we believe that he has come descended with the shout a voice of trump and and so uh I believe that we're in this time of refreshing a time of restoration a restitution of all things and this word I just looked up this word refreshing it's actually means a recovery of breath and uh the the Webster would put it a Reviving or stimulation amen and I thought that was fitting uh for the day that we're living in and uh but we we find that the prophet said the mystery that is made known to us in this day the mystery being made known to us um is we're going back home how many believes we're going back home we're going back home I I'm so looking forward to it a man and um uh he says we're going back home to to be restored back to the original Eden free from Death sickness sorrow shame going back with eternal life he said it's the kingdom being restored amen being restored and so we looked at this word restore it means to turn back to return to repair to bring back and brother Branham in speaking of the new Heaven and the new Earth he says uh uh there it'll never be blackened again when this new Earth is to come the devil will be bound Satan is still loose now he is the accuser but in the new Earth he will be bound and cast into the Lake of Fire in this Holy Fire and in this new Earth the skies will never be black again no that's from the curse he never be black again with angry clouds the winds will never blow across her again like that no she'll never tear up the trees and tear up the houses and turn over the things lightning him the Wrath will never Belch from Satan across there and kill a man walking down the road or burn up a building no no more see there will be no more typhoon sweep down or storms or tornadoes and tear up houses and kill little children and things uh see won't be there no more see trying to destroy it it won't be there for Satan is cast out what what a restoration that is and and remember this is the age that we're not just beginning of restoration not not Luther Wesley or Pentecost restoring gifts or restoring a little Doctrine but this is the restitution of all things amen and this is where we're standing uh uh uh tonight in this age amen and brother Branham says what it is it's a restored Eden has begun amen a restored Eden and and so then just thinking on this restoration David would say the Lord is my shepherd and and he goes on down and as we've just talked about through uh through the first and second verses but then he comes that third verse which I believe it all ties together and and says he restoreth my soul amen and I've just been looking at this and realizing what a statement that really is according to to what's to restore is to bring back to the former owner or to bring back to a former state of condition that once was and and and now isn't but yet it's going to be because he restores there's a restoration and if a claim is made on something to make that restoration you can enforce it to make it come back to its right place can you say man so this is the work of redemption restoration and Redemption goes hand in hand a man because to redeem something amen means that that subject of redemption has been removed it's it's gotten out of its place and uh uh from its original condition its original state its original place a man but redeeming is to bring it back ain't that right and man so so brother Branham says it means that it was taken from its real place ain't that right now I know I know we think this is real and and Life to us seems to be real but there's another life that is more real than this and our condition right now may seem to be real but actually there's a better condition that is more real than this do you believe that amen and and so God is restoring us back to the real place our real condition our our our our place now now notice uh because God knows where you belong do you believe that if he's going to redeem you he's he then he's the one that's got to know where you belong he's got to know a man where where your original condition should be ain't that rhyme amen see and you must everybody say I must I must be in that place that's right amen in not only does he know amen your original place and your original condition but in God's mind you must be in that place and I I just love that ain't that right amen now notice Jeremiah 10 and 12 he that he hath made the Earth by his power he hath establish the World by his wisdom and have stretched out the heavens by his discretion or by his understanding see so so God didn't just sling out the stars and the Stars just happen to stop you know where they stopped and maybe because there wasn't enough power behind it to thrust it out more whatever but I believe that God stopped every Star where they belong do you believe that amen and and so uh uh I I believe that God put a great thought in in each star him and and billions of stars just in our galaxy and and yet millions of light years apart and and yet the Bible says he calls every one of them by name and that he can measure them he can measure them with his hand amen and and so if God knows every Star by name amen because he purposefully put Pluto where it should be and he uh I guess that's a star if not it's a planet and my wife will correct me afterward but uh whatever them stars are and wherever them planets ought to be and and all these things God knew exactly where they should go ain't that right now uh uh Psalms 147 and 4 he telleth the number of stars so we can't count the stars but God can tell the number if you were to ask God and God would give you the answer he would tell you exactly not guesswork exactly how many stars there are and he calls them all by their names see so great is our Lord and of great power notice his understanding is infinite right that's what the Bible says his understanding is infinite and the prophet gives us just a little glimpse of what infinite is he says words can't describe what infinite is but he says if we could just go amen and and get a little understanding of what infinite is it would be God a billion billion billion years before time ever began he knew how many mosquitoes would be there how many gnats would be on the face of this Earth he would know the breath and the size of depth of breath and he would know every little heartbeat and every nap would make and he says and that doesn't even begin to describe what infinite is ain't that right and yet his understanding is infinite now so so so think of how god holds the Earth if one star would get out of its place amen then it would affect the entire Earth amen uh the whole solar system has to stay in its place ain't that right now uh Jeremiah 5 22 fear ye not me saith the Lord will you not tremble at my presence which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea uh by a Perpetual decree that it cannot pass amen though the waves thereof toss themselves now notice amen have you been to the beach and and you see the waves crashing against that ocean and or the beach and crashing in and even at night time you know how that the water may be you know way back over there but at night time it creeps up and it creeps up and everything that was Beach is now covered with water a amen but yet it's by a decree that it can't go any further ain't that right it's by a decree now I want you to understand that because if God would decree the Stars to stay in its place God would decree the moon and the sun to stay in its place and he would decree even the waves of the water Amen to stay in its place can you say amen and he says now he's placed the uh the sand for the bound of the Sea by Perpetual decree that it cannot pass and though the waves thereof toss themselves yet can they not Prevail nor though they Roar yet can they not pass over it ain't that right so so now let's look at it but what keeps the what keeps them from prevailing well we say well the word of God but look at the Moon amen the moon as we know controls the tides ain't that right if the Moon would get out of its place ain't that right if it just get out of its place just a little bit see the prophet said the Earth would be covered in water within a a few minutes ain't that right but they stay in their position because God decreed them to stay exactly where they are they're just hanging in space at the word of God oh my ain't that right now we're the ones that's been taken out of our position ain't that right amen we're the ones that's been taken out of our position now brother Branham says see if God when I was an alien from him so loved me till he stooped down to get me and pick me up then that gives me confidence that he wants to use me ain't that right amen if God would so love you that he would involve his time with you then that means he must want to do something with you amen God just ain't wasting time he he ain't just playing you know uh little uh patty cake with us ain't that right amen sometimes we become insincere about life and we become insincere about our salvation but I'm telling you God ain't insincere if God saved you he's got a reason for saving you ain't that right amen he knew your condition before you ever knew your condition he saw where you belong way before you ever amen we wouldn't even know where we belong had it not been for the mercy of God Amen for all of it we can know is that our life is just meant for here and we live we die amen and who knows where we end up amen but God will see to it amen that before we die there's a restoration that has taken place can you say amen amen see so uh uh he said he's got a purpose in doing it he's seen something in me he's seen something in you and he had a reason to save you ain't that right look at the people that's unsafe today look at the millions he could have took besides you but he took you my see no one everybody say no one no one can take your place no one can take your place ain't that right he's got that Moon hanging right there amen and we hear that there's other moons there's other Suns there's other stars there's all these in other planets but that Moon that you see every night there is not another Moon can take its place there ain't nothing else that can take its place can you say amen God ordained for that Moon that sun then Stars Amen to hang in our galaxy Amen to keep this world in order ain't that right well that's the same way God ain't replacing Sons and Daughters amen of his Emmanuel you've fallen and you've messed up and you're mad and and so I've got to go find something else that ain't Redemption can you say amen amen God angel redeeming this Earth amen or or replacing this Earth he's going to redeem this Earth he's not replacing anything it's all about Redemption ain't that right amen so he could have taken you or uh he could have took took beside you but he took you no one can take your place you're in God's economy aren't you glad you're in God's economy you're in God's economy and no one can do it that's his love to you now we we shouldn't take these things for granted we are in the economy of God that's right see so you have to be brought back to your original place your original condition because nobody can take your place so this is redemption redeemed Romans 8 19 for the earnest expectation of the creature Wade is for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity amen not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same and hope think of that he made you subject to vanity but before he'd done that he made you subject to a hope he had already provided a remedy for you amen say so because the creature itself shall also be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation growneth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan amen have you just had that groaning in you we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the Redemption of our body so there's a groaning and there's a travailing remember brother Branham he tells us he said it's just like a man that has fallen in a pit and he can't get out he's trying to get back to its original condition amen see and and so he says see uh uh they're struggling climbing appalling they must by some means get out of this pit they're not in their original state and frantically they're screaming they're clawing the walls and making a noise or doing some way they're groaning because that they want to get back to their original state have you just wondered what that desire is in you that hunger that is in you a man that is longing for a better world that's longing a man for a world where there's no death there's no trouble there's no sorrow and and maybe you don't understand or we didn't understand it but now we're beginning to understand what this is We Came From Another Place that's right scene and so he says they're groaning because they want to get back to their original state as when a person is struck with disease aches and pain one time they wasn't that way but they're groaning why they're not right there's something wrong amen they're groaning a man trying to get back to where they was when they had health and when Nature and people as the Bible says are groaning it shows there's something that they're not in their ought to be conditioned they have fallen from somewhere now we know that it's eternal life that we fell from ain't that right and we've lost our claims on eternal life by the fall of Adam and Eve they fell from eternal life in the Garden of Eden and by doing so they brought all nature amen down uh under them to death amen as the prophet would tell us a tree never died before Adam fell amen a child never died you know it it or an animal never died before Adam see amen and and there's only one thing that cannot die and that's God himself for he is eternal ain't that right amen and having eternal life is the only way that will keep us from dying amen and so then we must have eternal life within us to be Sons and Daughters of God can you say Amen that that's what God is looking for is Sons and Daughters amen not not Sons and Daughters of Duran Martin but Sons and Daughters of God Amen that that's right he wasn't looking for William Branham of Charles and ellebranum he was looking for a Son of God and so is it with you amen God is anticipating the sons of God Amen to come back to what their place is in his mind do you believe that that's right see amen so he says when we died to sin we sold out our Birthright and crossed this Chasm and we're beyond the reach of God on this other side of CAD the chasm now of course when Adam fell to death he brought death upon all creation that's right see amen so God had to come to us ain't that right as and and I know this was basic but I'm getting somewhere on this restoration of the Soul God had to come to us we didn't ask God to come to us how do we know that we need it we were born in sin shape and iniquity we thought this was all there was that God out of the out of the rims of of time and and having an infinite mind he he already had our lives figured out and it wasn't this to be Sinners and to be burdened down in sin and sickness and diseases and and all of that ain't that right so even we weren't asking for his pardon we weren't asking for his Redemption but he came to us the desire began on his part ain't that right so John 3 16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life and notice for God's sin not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved ain't that right and again as we said before Jesus did not come to this Earth come to this world hey shopping amen looking for something new he didn't come grocery shopping like or what we would call grocery shopping he didn't go like we would go to Walmart or Amen to uh uh uh Kmart or or the food Supply or whatever amen that's he came Amen to be a redeemer he didn't come to replace that which was Fallen can you say man amen he came to bring back that which was Fallen amen and and I'm glad that he's a Healer aren't you glad he's a Healer amen not only of our body but of our soul he come to fix the problem amen and restore us back Amen to where we belong amen Psalms 103 2 says bless the Lord O my soul and forget not his benefits not all his benefits and the fourth verse who redeemeth thy life from destruction amen aren't you glad for that redeemeth thy life from destruction I think of how that God spoke through the mouth of the Prophet Hosea saying I will ran handsome them amen with the from the power of the grave and I will redeem them from Death this is what God's speaking through a prophet Hosea and and not only is he talking about Israel he's talking about he had spiritual seed amen them Sons and Daughters of God the grave is held to him that I'm going to redeem them from the grave death strikes every one of them all good men down Through the Ages uh uh they've been good men but when death comes they have to give it up they give in and there they are it's in the grave but he says I'm going to redeem them from the grave or from Death can you say amen and I believe that that scripture is going to be fulfilled in this hour I believe there are people living on this Earth that'll never taste death I just believe that amen I believe there's some in this building that is never going to taste death amen never go by the way of the grave and that scripture is going to be fulfilled can you say amen amen that's right Galatians 3 13 Christ Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us Titus 2 14 Christ gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity think of that church all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of Good Works amen now you think of the work of redemption not only redeeming you from the grave redeeming you from death he's redeeming you from all iniquity my Where Do We Stand now I want you to notice that Jesus is not constantly redeeming you come on he's not constantly redeeming me every day I wake up he's he's constantly redeeming that's not true can you say amen amen in other words we're not one day in the pawn shop and then another day we're out of the pawn shop and then the next day we're back in the pawn shop and then the other day we're out of the pawn shop it's not He Loves Me He Loves Me Not He Loves Me He Loves Me Not he loves me you understand what I'm saying that's not it see it's not a constant work of redemption no sir amen and I want you to understand that now it's not a constant work of redeeming amen Hebrews 9 12 by his own blood he entered in once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us God have mercy so he's not having to die for you every time you make a mistake he's not having to die for you every time a bad thought comes through your mind he's not having to die for you every time you stumble and and and you say something or you blow up and you lose your temper or or you lied or you've done this or you've done that no it's an eternal Redemption God have mercy it's a security can you say amen that's right see Hebrews 10 14 for by one offering not many offerings but by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are Sanctified amen do you think of that now two thousand years ago by that offering he perfected you before you ever breathe your first breath in a world that is filthy in a world that's a turmoil in the darkest age the most evil age there is a people that stands perfected not by their own works but by the works of Calvary I'm telling you this Redemption is is settled it's an eternal Redemption can you say Amen you may have fallen today but you're redeemed you may have complexes that you're dealing with but you're redeemed can you say man you may have some growing up to do but you're redeemed you may have to repent but you're redeemed can you say amen and to think of it it wasn't redeemed when I come to the altar I was redeemed when he said it is finished he's the one said it's finished it's over and he put a period to my Redemption he's the only one that could put a period to our Redemption can you say Amen why it's a perfect blood bringing forth a perfect loosening can you say amen that's right see so David is saying he restoreths my soul it's an eternal restoration foreign [Applause] to rest in Green Pastures and we know what that is that's that open book he's eating from the open book can you say amen amen and to think of it that is the book of redemption that's what's been restored to us in this day it's not coming from a clergy not coming from a d a a headquarter somewhere it's coming from the straight Mind Of God Amen it's the original thought that God thought of you and he's speaking it unto you and we're feeding and we're resting it's a place of rest how can a man enter and duress knowing that it could be restored today and lost tomorrow can't rest but David's saying he makes me lay down in Green Pastures he leads me by Still Waters it's a Waters of rest it's it's rest time oh I hope you understand that church notice Hebrews 4 and 3 for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said now don't create your own rest he's already provided the rest and those that believe in that rest will enter into that rest ain't that right amen so we which uh uh have believed to enter into rest as he said as I have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and God did rest everybody say God did rest the seventh day from all of his works oh my God where are we at where are we at in time where are we at in the church ages the church ages are finished we've entered into an arrest can you say Amen so look when the prophet said when God made the world in six days he rested on the seventh day never worked anymore blessed be the name of the Lord he built the world put the creation on it and went to rest and never everybody say never that's important he never came back again to build any more world he finished the works and went to rest can you say Amen but now he's not only got his arrest but he's providing his own people a rest to where they ain't going to have to labor anymore ninth verse there there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God for he that is entered into his rest he also have ceased from his own works oh if we can get that now see as God did from his he ceased from his own works as God did from his my goodness amen isn't that amazing now the prophet said what that rest is you don't want it you you no more want the things of the world the world is dead to you can you say man the world is dead to you amen that's right now that ain't saying you ain't gonna make a mistake that your Prophet said you're subject to to fall you're subject to mistakes but he said the moment you realize that you're wrong you you'll repent of it and you get back up that's not held against you can you say Amen it's not held against you now Matthew 11 28 come unto me this is Jesus speaking to all his his Believers his children come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you what rest now church this is God's so desire is that you come to rest come to rest in your salvation come to rest in your joy come to rest in your peace come to rest in all that you are you come to rest because God himself provided the rest you couldn't save yourself but God did you couldn't help yourself but God did amen you couldn't make deliver yourself but God did and it's an eternal Redemption ain't that right give your rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest for what your souls this body gonna labor this body gets tired this body gets weary this body gets broken down but we're talking about he restoreth my soul you find rest for your soul can you say man and what is the rest the Holy Ghost you'll not find rest until you get the Holy Ghost can you say Amen Prophet said when did the rest come he said when people spoke with other tongues and had stammering lips stammering lips they didn't speak nothing they stammered see when when did that happen on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost come that is the rest the Holy Ghost Jesus said come unto me all you that are weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest I'll give you life eternal life isn't that where we fell from but he says I'm going to impart it to you see Zoe God's own life God will come unto you and be a part of you he will give you a birth and make you a son and daughter ain't that right then you look at Ephesians 4 30. Paul says and grieved not the Holy Spirit whereby you're sealed to the day of your Redemption ain't that right what what in it you're sealed everybody say I'm sealed you got the baptism of God's spirit you're sealed not until the next Revival but until the day of redemption it's finished it's over you've come into rest and brother Brown said the greatest curse that is upon is on the church today is they don't know who they are it's true I I think it behooves us to see just how secure the restoration of our souls is for there's a rest for the people of God we cannot be at rest if we don't know the plan of God for our lives we cannot be at risk if we don't understand the Plan of Redemption Jesus said he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me half everlasting life and what what what are them other words and shall not everybody say shall not come into condemnation but his past from death into life now do you realize you're living in a world of condemnation this world all around you is being condemned look look at the look at the craziness that's out there is God's judgments beginning to pour out upon America upon the world and yet Jesus says he that believeth on me and heareth my words amen has already has that eternal life and shall not come in the condemnation now that God does not want his people coming to the house of God loaded with condemnation come on now you say well I just don't know if I'm going to make it but blessed God that ain't true worship that that ain't that ain't coming from a a Heart of Worship well it's true amen see now notice the prophet said if God Saves you knowing he's going to lose you he defeats his purpose if God saved you knowing he's going to lose you he defeats his purpose now do you think anything catches God by surprise absolutely not it's interesting I was reading last night in the Bible and and uh foreign of Syria that was sick so he had this man to go to the prophet Elisha I believe it was Elisha and he says the king wants to know Assyria is he going to die he said you go tell him he's going to live he said but he will die and the Bible says that the prophet also just started weeping he just got loaded and started weeping and just just travailing just sobbing and the Man Standing before him asked him said what's going on basically why are you weeping what's troubling you and the prophet looked at him says because I see I see what you're going to do the children of Israel I see that you're going to kill the children I see that you're going to rip the mother's babies out of their bellies I see what you're gonna and on and on as he's given this prophecy and the man the man even says what you think I'm a dog that would do this thing but you go read on down he done exactly what the prophet saw now you know I I got excited though because I thought see that's infinite knowledge and if God ever saved you he already saw you on the other side you understand what I'm saying and and what's amazing is there is a people that that God doesn't look at their sins can you say Amen now now notice if God Saves you knowing he's going to lose you he defeats his purpose he don't do that when he saves you you're saved when he saves you you're saved so there is nothing that is hindering the knowledge of God in the future and so he saves you today and then uh five years from now he goes oh my goodness I didn't see that coming that's not at all at all he saw you there and he showed even the prophet as he showed the prophet of this man of what he would do in the future he showed our Prophet that we were already there and the prophet said I saw you there yeah thank you it all hinges on predestination and that word predestinate means to happen now that have knowledge beforehand to foreknown to predetermined to decide beforehand to decree from eternity to foreordain ain't that right and the prophets that God could predestinate by foreknowledge he foreknew what would be not willing that any should perish that that all would come to repentance but being infinite and God he could predestinate and foretell by foreknowledge ain't that right now God acted upon that foreknowledge he knew you he saw you amen and before he ever created a man that first devil before he ever created uh anything that could fall amen he predestinated you he acted upon that infinite knowledge you understand amen so in Romans 8 29 for whom he did for no infinite knowledge he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his dear son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren more over whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also just unified and whom he justified then me also glorified can you imagine it's already done it's settled it's finished it is now we're entering into his rest do you think God's concerned about you do you think God has just taken nerve pills about you you're going through your trial you don't know what to do and you think God's panicking absolutely not he's already decreed and in for your life amen I hope this all right in Revelations 13 8. there is a book mentioned called the Lamb's Book of Life or The Book of Life of the Lamb and this verse tells us that there are names written in this book and those names represent people right and then people who does not have their names written in this book are going to worship the Beast yeah now that's already prophesied it's already done it's settled because the infinite god with infinite knowledge decreed it [Music] ain't that right but he wrote names down in that book for a reason you had a purpose for it because he's going to use them now when Jesus was on Earth that God same God that wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of Life dwelt in that body on Earth and he said Upon This Rock and that was the Revelation that Peter had and Upon This Rock I will build my church and we find out that that is the purpose of them names or we could say one of the purposes them names in that book and they realize Satan can't take them out of that book because see it was already declared there would be a church and it would be the Church of the Living God and that church would be a bunch of people who would be a tabernacle for the Living God can you say amen and while they're on Earth they would be the Tabernacle of a living God just as Jesus Christ was and would be it would produce the same ministry as Jesus Christ in my name you shall cast out Devils you shall lay on that your hands upon the sick and they shall recover you'll drink any deadly thing and it shall not harm you what's he talking about damn names that are in that book oh thank you Jesus Revelations 21 27 talks about the same book and calls it the Lamb's Book of Life it says and there shall in the wise enter into it speaking of that new city anything that defile us neither whatsoever worketh Abomination or maketh a lie but they everybody say they which are written in the Lamb's Book of Life think of that he's already got a place for you in the city ain't that right and nobody can take your place so he didn't come to replace you he come to redeem you because there's a city that's coming and he had a certain group of people them names written in the book that was going to be there it was worth every Agony that he did he went through it was worth every gasping breath he went through it was worth every beating he got and if there was only one name written in that book he would do it all over again amen because you cannot be replaced he come to redeem you to restore yes so there are people who have their names written in the Lamb's Book of Life and there's people that don't and as we go I'm going to get more into that but brother Brown says before the foundation of the world God wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of Life by his pen no by a spoken word now think of it because Jesus would tell us later on Heaven and Earth will pass away but my words will never that's right my word will never pass away and he's sent Christ the sacrifice to buy to redeem that same group that he had wrote their names in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world can you say Amen so them names that were written before the foundation of the world that's what Christ came to redeem [Applause] amen do you realize there's not a name that can be added to the book out and there's not a name that can be taken from the book it's settled can you say man no matter how many revivals we have no matter how many movings of the spirit we have no matter how much good preaching we have it will not produce any more names than what was written before the foundation of the world brother Brandon said we wonder why the Revival is not going on right now why we don't see the enthusiasm with the people I don't know why but let's just think of it of it like this maybe there's a little boy in here tonight or a little girl was born over in Seattle Washington now that book holds her name ain't that right and he come to redeem whose name was written on that book and redeemed means to bring back where it fell from and in the human race that little girl was falling see and she can't accept it now because she's too young so the church will just slug right along just play along we'll have meetings and so forth till that last person is brought in then that book is closed there's no more added it's all over then can you say amen amen now I just happen to believe that there's a name on that book book that hadn't come in yet and and and the prophet said we'll go to the end of the road for the laws amen I don't believe that this bride will come in this age amen and as long as she lives on this in this earth that she will live without a burden for so somehow someway somewhere can you say man amen but now that's up to God why who comes in who doesn't but the church is just slugging right along and you might just say well why is it that we're just hanging out here and and you know there ain't nothing really happening we're waiting on a soul there must be a soul somewhere amen that's why I'm going to look at it can you say amen amen and that Soul amen God knew amen well to think of it now you just think of it my way for just a moment I thought well hear the prophet preaching souls in prison and all that he preached that what 65 63 I was born in 73 10 years later now I just happened you know because you know I I just I just like to believe that even though I I wasn't there in the meetings God would wait and wait and wait now I'm born in 73. but but you know I I was an honorable little rascal but he would wait on me you understand what I'm saying I I I well I had a desire for God I love God and God patiently waited and then when the right time came he sent a voice Boosh and grab my heart can you say amen amen and he'd been waiting on me now I don't know about sorry about you guys that are already perfected but he's been waiting on me you understand what I'm saying amen and and maybe there's some so out here in Blacksburg or Christiansburg and it may just be one so but I'll tell you it's worth the wait if it's worth the wait for God for that soul to come in it's worth the wait for us we're going to keep preaching we're going to keep seeing we're going to keep living we're going to keep testifying we're going to keep doing everything that we're doing for that one last soul [Applause] yes sir now notice God predestinated by foreknowledge and if God did that predestinated us before the foundation of the world and knew every one of us by name oh goodness he didn't just know the Stars by name that he knew you Knew You by name before the foundation of the world and he elected us to eternal life and sent Jesus Christ to redeem us that six thousand years ago he saw us that we might appear to his Praises in glory now notice the question he asked how can you ever be lost good Lord now if you're saved you're saved if God Saves you tonight knowing you're going to lose you 10 years from today he's defeating his own purpose the infinite Almighty Eternal Everlasting wisdom God doesn't know enough then to know whether you will hold out or whether you won't then when he saves you you say well I'll give him a try I'll see what he he'll do see then he does not know the end from the beginning can you say Amen I'll put it this way God ain't going to save people that's going to live half-hearted oh no this Church of the Living God ain't Half Half Baked Christians they ain't got one foot in the world and one foot in church no no no no no that that that wouldn't that be terrible if God Amen would call a people like that can you say Amen but he knew you'd be willing for to forsake the world amen that's right see so he says see he saves you and said well I'm going to give him a try say well see I'll see what he'll do then then he doesn't know the end from the beginning God knows what he's doing yeah hey amen amen have you ever just asked God why did you save me and I'll probably give you the answer he knows what he's doing don't you never worry about that it's you and I stumbling along but God knows what he's doing and he knew whether we would hold out or what we would do ain't that right I'm reading a lot of quotes but I hope that's all right remember he says the Bible said the Lamb's Book of Life was written before the foundation of the world and your name was put in that book when the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world to redeem every name that was put or written in that book another place that church is a predestinated church every name that was every put on that book Jesus came to redeem and when the last name is redeemed the book is closed he didn't intend that no one would be lost but by his foreknowledge let him know who would be lost therefore he could predestinate and then their names were put on the book John 15 16 Jesus said you've not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain now whatsoever you shall ask of my father in my name he may give it to you so when was you chosen before the foundation of the world predestinated ain't that right so now listen to redeem anything is to bring back to its original place so it's only the predestinated that will be brought back he says because the others didn't come from there so so I want you to think of it when David is saying He restored my soul it isn't a lucky charm right it isn't because he rubbing the rabbit's foot or maybe luck was with him that day but he's saying I was in God's mind before the foundation of the world now that that means a lot ain't that right now there are those that that teach that the names that are written on the Lamb's Book of Life can be taken off that Lamb's Book but that's not true now you just look at David's life for just a moment look at David's life look at the sins he had he committed murder did he not committed adultery he numbered the people which calls 70 000 people to die because of his own actions and yet David said he restoreth my soul [Music] Psalms 32 2 it says blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity and remember this is David this is David that is saying he restoreth my soul now to the legalists how can his soul be restored when he done this and he done that and we saw him do this and we know he done this and yet David has said he restoreth my soul well David will answer you blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not imbue sin and instead of imputing sin he restoreth my soul praise the Lord and God so why did God ever allow sin in the first place as we know the prophet taught us because in God our attributes that had to be expressed sin never came to destroy you you with me God never did allow sin to come to destroy you or to eternally separate you from God do you realize that sin if your name putting on the Lamb's Book of Life no matter how low down you are sin isn't great enough to keep you from the love of God so therefore don't look at your sin look at the grace of God hello come on Amen don't look at your sin now God knew when he created Lucifer that he was going to be the one to corrupt the world but he created him with a purpose in mind for God is a savior God Is A Healer God is a deliverer God is a Waymaker God is a provider God is all in all right ain't that right yet he could not make not one of those attributes known unless there was a need for it ain't that right now there's a need because of sin ain't that right but God would never allow sin your sin or anyone else's sin to wipe away the memory from his mind your memory the memory of you hello he would never let your defiled nature and condition ever wipe away what he originally had of you there ain't no sin powerful enough is that right remember the prophet told us that God's thoughts are Eternal and they are real is that right so Satan has power but he will never be able to take you so low to where God wipes your name from this Lamb's Book of Life ain't gonna do it Satan's power is only made to be broken you believe that Satan's power over your life now God would allow Satan to dominate your life only to prove his own power he needed somebody to deliver so he says Satan take him to the lowest of hell and I will come back and I'll redeem them I'll bring them back you can put him on the deathbed but I'll restore their soul I restore their health foreign 's Powers the power of sickness it's the power of sin it's the power of depression it's the power of anxiety it's the power of complexes can you say Amen but the prophet would ask the question which is most powerful the Healer or your sickness can you say Amen what is most powerful your bondage or the the deliverer what is more powerful your sin or the savior can you say man and remember the prophet but Paul tells us there's none greater than God everybody say there's none greater there's none greater than God that's right there is not one creation that God would make that would become greater than he is the creator that's right and he's the only self-existent one he's the one everything else the Bible says was created from by him and for him and God ain't lost anything there's nothing out of control with God God knows your number he knows where you live he knows how to deal with you he knows the time clock that he's ordained for you amen he knows when you're going to come to Deliverance he knows when you're going to come through of everything that he's ordained for you he knows and you know what he knows what to do with your sin you think God's standing there baffled looking at you you think when he's a sinner painting the town red and just drugs and alcohol and whatever use them in or or probably even worse religion actually brother Brown said the word Spirit there is is a religious spirit [Applause] you can't even deal with them anymore he ain't got an ounce of repentance in and they're too religious you understand what I'm saying so that's the word spirit and then yet you were in that in that nonsense having a religious spirit Bound by that religion and you think God would stand in there saying oh my goodness I put his name in the book now what am I going to do with this guy no God knew what to do with you can you say Amen you deserved hell you deserve condemnation you deserved him to have lightning strike you many times but he knew what to do with you he saved you He restored your soul he knows what to do with the sickness that comes upon you he knows what to do with your sin sick soul can you say man that's why his blood is here [Music] you know what healer just takes the sickness away and destroys it the Savior just takes your sins away and just cast them into the sea of forgetfulness to think of that he created a sea of forgetfulness for who himself a god that is infinite that knows I every time that each flea bats its eye and counts the numbers of them nothing can escape his notice but he would create a seed just for your sins and he would cast him in the sea of forgetfulness and he himself cannot remember all I know it's the grace of God you love him amen so notice the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world brother Bram said God In His Infinite mind looking down through the streams of time and he saw what would take place and how he would have to create and drop down into the time of space to pull out what he really was now notice the prophet said put a man to the test and you'll see what he is really made out of put a woman to the test and you'll see what she's made of put a whiskey bottle under the nose of an alcoholic and see what he's made out of you'll see the prophet says whether he got delivered or not strip a woman down and let her go by a man that's been a rascal and is known to break other men's homes and you'll be able to tell whether or not that man's been delivered ain't that right let something happen in the church and see if that old gossiper has been delivered or not from that Spirit of gossip see you got to put them put it to the test now there's not one person whose name written in the Lamb's Book of Life that wants to sin and make mistakes Tommy wants to sin no how many likes making mistakes no yet David now I want you to notice this is David because again we're all like him David and all of his faults and all of his mistakes he would write my soul followeth hard after thee my soul and God would say of David I have found a man after mine own heart which shall fulfill all my word can you say Amen David didn't want to sin he didn't want to fail God and notice David had a repentant heart and if you'll notice the Zeal of the age is repent repent that's the Zeal of the age now it put God to the test what would God do with David's sin would he cast him out of his economy would he change his mind concerning David would he change what he said about David a man being after my own heart when he saw David commit the adultery and he saw David to have that had to bestowed one of his best soldiers murdered notice it's putting God to the test hello yes sir but David would say no he didn't cast me out of his economy He restored my soul so God passed the test hello he stood the test well what about David's sins God just provides an atonement for him [Music] then you say Amen the prophet said David after he did wrong and taken Uriah the hittite's wife the lovely Bathsheba and was going to be the father of her child and had caused her Gallant husband to be killed in battle when the prophet Nathan come in and revealed his sins to him then David thought on his ways and turned himself to repentance and sackcloth and Ashes that's the way to turn and God heard him and God will always hear a man or woman that'll turn their feet to his testimony and I say to you God will always stand the test can you say Amen he cannot forsake you he stood the test when he stood before Abraham as a man remember in Genesis 18 and 10 God said to Abraham I will certainly Return To Thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women in other words she couldn't have children in these things see therefore Sarah laughed with inner self saying after I am waxed owed shall I have pleasure with my Lord being old also and and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I of a surety bear a child which am old is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return to thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son Uncle notice then Sarah denied saying I laughed not for she was afraid and God would tell her neighbor thou did us laugh can you say Amen now notice what danger she put herself in the prophet said God would have killed her right then right there on the spot can you say Amen but he couldn't do it the grace of God intervenes hey wow if he killed Sarah he would have killed Abraham can you say amen for the promise was she was part of the promise the Abraham God could not replace her with Hagar God not could not replace her with anyone else I hope you understand tonight amen and even though she deserved death and that righteous holy God being called a liar and should have struck her death he couldn't strike her he stood the test yay s our God in the lovely brother Brown said see our stupidity he'd kill every one of us but he can't take the church and destroy it he can't do it because it's part of himself Christ part of himself the word being made man flesh Oh Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound see he couldn't do it he couldn't kill her he couldn't take her life because she was part of Abraham she was flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone ain't that right in another place he says in our mistake don't say well I made a failure no see that that don't make them Abraham had failures too I want you to understand that your failures don't rely and make excuses by your own failures yeah [Music] ain't that right God did not choose qualified people but he qualifies Those whom he chooses he didn't choose people that were Worthy but them that he choose he made Worthy he didn't choose a a sinless people but he took that people and made them sinless [Music] yet they still got their faults yet they still got their mistakes in their heart they don't want to make their mistakes can you say man in in their heart into doing everything they can to avoid their mistakes that brother Bradham said I have to repent every day can you say man but in all of that I stand sinless before God because there's an atonement so he said see couldn't take the church he can't kill the elected he can't take your life because you're a part of himself you're the word the word is in you it's manifest itself proving itself love joy peace long suffering all the words of God you believe every one of them work see and God working through you you're part of the word which is Christ we are taught that he is the word and we are flesh of his flesh bone of his bone there you are can you say Amen look at Christ he stood the test for the woman at the well she was a low down scum according to the to uh to society she was an outcast can you say Amen a prostitute and he knew who she was he knew and yet he said I must needs be go by the way of Samara he went out of his way for that little lady going out of his way for a prostitute a a person of ill thing but he stood the test because he knew down inside of her was the seed of life her name was written on the Lamb's Book of Life his love was greater than her sin can you say amen and he showed the sign of the Messiah and it redeemed her that's what the prophet said it redeemed her [Music] what about our sins as we close Psalms 103 10. he hath not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities for as the heaven is high above the Earth so great is his Mercy toward them that fearing as far as the East is from the West so far hath he removed our transgressions from us stood the test he knew what to do with your sins yeah he came to redeem a basket case he put the names a veal famed people he put the names of people that weren't Worthy and he wrote him in a book because he knew what to do with you Micah 7 19 he will turn again he will have compassion upon us he will subdue our iniquities and that will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea amen you love him you say brother Branham I'm an awful woman I've lived illegally I've even broke my marriage vows I've done this brother Brian I tell you I've been a drunkard I've done this no matter what you've done God never looks at you he looks at the lamb and he's already accepted the lamb so you're free God can't see you he sees the lamb dies in your place in your stead can you say man if the musicians will come I thinking of and most of you I'm sure have heard of the testimony interview with sister Bruce but as she was dying brother Brown said I'm I'm fixing to pray for you she's on her death bed and brother Branham comes to pray for her and he says I'm not worthy of that I think well what if what would I do if Jesus Christ was sitting here now and what would he do if he was sitting here he'd lay his hands upon you and with his great faith say you'd get well well I think well I'm a sinner I'm not him but I come to represent him but remember me being a sinner and before God I'm not a sinner neither are you before God think of that before God we're not a sinner we got a blood sacrifice laying there God don't even see us he hears our voice but he sees the blood of Christ that's it see he sees the blood of his own son it's our voice Christ's blood then it's Christ that's talking through us to God so therefore we're not Sinners no more we are Christian I believe you he's talking to Sister Bruce to be a genuine Christian woman and I remember saying and notice what sister Bruce is doing she says but I make so many mistakes and I feel so many times notice the prophet that's why Christ had to die so that you with your mistakes wouldn't be lauded to you he took your mistakes your desire and your heart is deserve him sister Bruce says yes all right that's what he died for so you could serve him your mistakes are not looked are not allotted to you he's your propitiation he's your sin offering your sins are not known you're not a sinner before God Christ took your sins and became you because your desire is to serve him see he was always Jehovah Jireh our provider he was always Jehovah's Shalom our peace he was always Jehovah Nissi our Banner y'all can just play something he was always Jehovah rawhi our righteousness he was always Jehovah Shama the present one but it took a need for him to manifest what he was can you say man see so it wasn't to cast you out of his economy because no one can take your place that he could allow the things in your life he allowed them he didn't predestinate them he allowed them but you were predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son predestinated [Music] for a rapture predestinated and Calvary has stood the test do you believe it aren't you glad for Calvary Calvary has stood the test brother Brown said every born-again believer True Believer is perfectly absolutely sinless before God all we could go on and on and on but I love the Lord I love the Lord he restoreth my soul amen what song yeah saying now oh I am reading [Music] part with surprise Jesus has changed my whole life anybody asked you foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] Jesus has changed my whole life foreign just who I am tell them that I am reading all singing now oh yes I am reading and bought with a price for Jesus has changed my whole life yes he has cute just who I am tell them I am repeat let's sing he looked beyond my thoughts I shall for look we better go down one key I shall fall forever lift my eyes can we just stand to our feet and sing it unto him to view the cross where cheese Jesus died for

bought My Liberty and die to just why he came to love me so he looked beyond my phone let the redeemed of the Lord say it now I shall foreign [Music] [Music] where Jesus died for me the grace that caught my falling soul [Music] by fall and Soul by me as they just placed
