we would like to see God save people probably the most thing above even physical healing is salvation of the Soul go and I see Sons and Daughters bir from above amen into a new birth and I think that's our greatest desire but you know I I believe this brother Terry with all my heart I don't know how God would do it and I don't even try to figure out how he would do it but if the Rapture was going to come in the morning I'm not worried about those people I'm praying for cuz I prayed and I'm believing that some way somehow now they're going to be there Hallelujah so if if it was let's say it was going to happen in the morning I'm not I'm not worried one bit I've applied the token and I believe that God is faithful and just to his promise hey only believe all things are possible we sing it so many times but when we put the where the rubber meets the road so to speak it's like I told uh some sisters up there in Canada years back you know their families were Wayward and oh my it was so much trouble in those families it was scars and and you talk about complexes and all kinds of stuff but I told the sister said if go do you have enough of faith in God that if God by his divine perect perfect will chose to take you home that got to take care of your children of course you could have heard a pin drop and course it that's the kind of Faith we've got to have if God took me if God took you God will take care of the rest he don't leave Stones unturned there's not going to be chapters and verses that was unfulfilled not in a believer's life I'm convinced of that by the grace of God Amen well praise the lord it's good to be in church Wednesday night know some of us have work today in various positions and jobs and kitchens and cleaning house and doing all these other things but amen let's focus on the word of God tonight if you would thank you musicians I really appreciate brother Levi playing the drums amen don't you think he done a good job praise the Lord amen been doing a good job amen I'd like you to turn with me in your bibles if you would to Isaiah 65 I appreciate the prayers over the weekend I we we we really felt them and when and when we go out we we do sense your your prayers so we really appreciate it last weekend amen and uh we're just we're believing God amen amen uh who can accuse me of sin amen I just want to say I believe that the Bride of Jesus Christ is going to fulfill every part of the word of God that was ordained to her in this last day not one devil amen is going to overcome any believer and not going to ride you ride you till the day of the Rapture oh yeah we're going to always have that push against us that wave that's coming against us but amen we're going to Crest every one our boat will not be swamped because Jesus is in this boat amen if he's in the boat the boat's not going down Hallelujah might fill up his water brother Sean to the brim but it ain't going down that's my God Amen praise the Lord Jesus Isaiah 65 Isaiah 65 And1 17 for behold I create new heavens and a new Earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind I want you I want you to say that with me and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind Verse 18 but be ye glad and rejoice forever in that which I create for behold I create Jerusalem a rejoicing Hallelujah a rejoicing joing and her people a joy and I will rejoice in Jerusalem and in joy in my people and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her nor the voice of crying there shall be then no more than an infinite days and old man had not filled his days for the child shall die 100 years old sinner being 100 years old shall be accursed they shall build houses and inhabit them they shall plant Vineyards and eat the fruit of them they shall not build and another inhabit they shall not plant and another eat for as days of a trie are the days of my people my elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands now I'd like you to turn it with me as well over to the book of Hebrews Hebrews in chapter n Hebrews chapter 9 and verse 12 Hebrews 9 and 12 neither by the blood of bull goats and calves but by his own blood he entered once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us for the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an hepher sprinkling the unclean Sanctified to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God and going over into Hebrews 10 and verse one Hebrews 10 and verse1 for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there unto perfect for then would they have not ceased to be offered because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year let's bow our heads in pray and ask God's blessing if our Heavenly Father God tonight we ask you for spiritual food in due season we believe that we've already possessors of it father God help us Lord Lord Jesus father God to expound the word of God that something would be said here tonight Lord that may Quicken maybe there' be someone here that would be feeling Lord as constantly nagging by a thought or a memory or something father God lord Jesus I pray that this would sink down deep into the heart May the enemy be driven back so that the fullness of joy the rejoicing of the Bride could be manifested in their life I pray and I ask that God tonight God that we would re help us oh God that any impediment dear God things that would block the move of your word and your spirit in our life that would be removed from us God so that your spirit might flow freely through US Lord God without a conscience Lord of a past life oh God we pray in the name of Jesus Christ may we look at the blood may we look tonight may we look and see what's been done for us oh God the great tradeoff dear God we ask it all in Jesus Christ's name you would give us strength tonight Lord help us oh God in the next few moments Lord to go through these scriptures go through these quotes we pray oh God I'm a man Lord Jesus father God of ignorance oh God and I need to know more of the revelation of truth but I pray God you take this little bit that I have in my heart dear God lord may it be brought forth to the people I pray in Jesus Christ's Name by your grace and power amen and amen as you seated tonight the brother asked me what I would be uh speaking on tonight and I thought an appropriate title would be this and I may come up maybe a you might put you might put a better title to it than what I've got but I'd like to speak on something tonight that I believe that the Lord Jesus spoke to me while I was sitting here in the service one service listening to brother Shawn Minister and and this thought come into my heart and almost I I I I just I was just completely I I it was just such a joy in my heart when I something that I been looking at for years and years and never noticed it before Suddenly It's like the he lifted the veil off of the sculpture he lifted the veil he pulled it back a little bit further so that I may see to show me to show us all Hallelujah where we're at and I pray what we're going to talk about tonight would be a would be a blessing to you as it was to me I say as brother randam said May the same inspiration that came to me in study and and in meditation and so forth may be with us tonight now as as we read there in Isaiah 65 And1 17 if I could just allude to this he says behold I create new heavens and new earth and a former shall not be remembered nor come into mind if you go back and you listen to the message I was listening a little bit to it this afternoon uh uh the uh future home message the future home of the Heavenly bride and the Earthly or the Earthly bride and and how that the bride how this Earth is going to be changed and I think we've been speaking about new book old book if you some of you remember maybe a few times that we've been here we we talked about that we know that there is the old Old Testament and then there's a new testament oh my the Old Testament and then there's the New Testament oh my wow but we find out that we realize that when brother random preached that sermon he he brought it back to how God he does that work in us first in this earth he brings a baptism of fire into the soul to remove the old man the old man dies an invisible Union you read about it's not just a divorcement he can't be married to somebody that's got a living husband you see that's the difference and I I spoke on this Sunday morning down there uh in Tennessee the difference between a party in which praise God for it but there's an exoneration two different things you know we we hear about a presidential pardon and this man or this woman is pardoned and they they're let out of prison but they still got a record behind them now that goes with a pardon and that's why people today they they believe on the Lord Jesus for God so loved the world that he gave to his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish and that's good but that's all the further they go and so they received a pardon but the old husband's still living they're and they try to live in a Sanctified State that's why brother random said the foolish virgin has to go into the tribulation period to be purged in order to go into that City cuz he said not a bobbed haired woman's going to walk through those doors of that Gates of that City I didn't just pick that one that's the first thing come on my mind the Bible says nor drunkers nor thieves nor Liars will enter into that place so there you have hardened brother and said there's millions of people be allowed to go into eternal life will be given eternal [Music] life you see but they had to go to the great white Throne judgment I'm so thankful for this message that tells me that once I become bold of his bold and flesh of his flesh and he old man is dead he shall not come into the Judgment Hallelujah I'm passed from Death under life the pardon receive life but the Sinner and the ungodly like I said last weekend when the judge says depart from me I never knew you you and he turns his back it's all over for that Soul see now they're living under a blessing because you and I are still here their life continues on but their sins do follow them and someday and I look at these World rulers and I look at these evil wicked men today or even the religious crowd who denies the word of God when they're summoned there won't be no they might they might be in contemp of court right now hey you Sinners because you're not here tonight because you're not somewhere in a house of God somewhere you're in contempt of court brother Amos how could they be in contemp of Court yeah you ever hear of settling on a court the Lord Jesus Christ the merciful lamb is inviting Sinners to come to now but you can settle now you can receive a pardon for your in sir and they don't come an evangelist goes into a place and they invite the the general public to come and people feel a funny feeling like I said about some guy in Toronto Canada opens up the newspaper and sees the headlines and say it was Billy Graham years ago funny feeling hits him maybe you ought to go oh but I'm care I sa my H marage I say all this somethingone speaks to him Holy Spirit speaking to that Sinner Man that religious Catholic man and he maybe another he goes to work the next day comes home and sits in the recliner again enjoying his cup of coffee and he sees the ad again and the Holy Spirit wo just coming around him and he feel such a feeling like my I ought to go I feel like I've heard of Billy Graham there's just something about that man what I've seen him on television and so forth something about his ministry but the man Harden his heart he's in contempt turning down Mercy brother Bram said God I will not condemn The Sinner for them being a sinner but that fail they failed they rejected the way out they rejected Mercy when it come to him and think about it when all these people out here there's enough of Bible around there's enough of word around the messages out there in the internet even with services like this that rich men could hear the truth and no doubt have tapped into it and hurt it one thing about it they're in contempt of court now they're going to be at that Court sitting oh God have mercy I I I'll be honest with you I'm not I'm not gloating in that I don't gloat in a sinner's demise neither does God I think there's a scripture I was trying to I've got it up here in my notes where he said I did don't Delight in anger delight and mercy he don't take no pleasure in the death of the wicked he doesn't take pleasure in allowing judgment to fall upon people he's not that kind of God you better get rid of that carnality cornal thinking that come from a lot of these denominational husbands eternal hell the whole nine yards I was thinking about that tonight how in the world could I after having received this glorious truth to know that I am absolutely free believe such a thing but even if I did the blood's already gone before me I have nothing to fear but he Jesus said he'll not come into that judgment we'll stand with him in judgment but now we look at the pardoned those who who rejected their sins follow them to judgment and Jesus said you'll die in your sins he told those Pharisees you're going to die in your sins that's pretty heavy I think I'd have prostrated myself right there and say oh lord lord Master see me have mercy upon me who are you we're educated where'd you come from so we move from the parland to the exonerated exonerated also it includes the pardon but actually exoneration over over uh I don't know what the word would be not supersedes but it actually eliminates pardon and it it says you're completely absorbed of guilt and that's like a man accused of a crime that he never committed exonerate the man means they take it off his record and you could they could take the governor or whoever take that man and stand him right up front say anybody want to hire this guy if you don't cuz you think he's got a record his record is done away with put it on the TV put it on the newspaper in the magazines this man is Guiltless there is no stain of of wrongdoing On this man's reputation he is exonerated Justified yeah that's the word there's no point because Christ took your judgment and my judgment for us the full penalty hell included that we should have got was placed upon him he bore our punishment and the blood that it was so holy that God accepted it brother Josiah God accepted that blood as holy as that is that Holiness is now a upon you and I who are you to say that my past is so terrible look at the Holiness of the blood of Jesus Christ look at the Holiness of the supernatural life of God coming into you you're just as holy as the blood of Jesus Christ nothing less nothing less now Hebrews 8 and12 I will be merciful tell me how could somebody continue to believe that the bride has to go to the great white Throne judgment that the elect to pred destinated ordained of God has to go to the great white Throne judgment after you read what I'm about to read taken from this was actually I believe found over in the Old Testament uh yes Jeremiah 31-34 they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them sayith the Lord for I will forgive their iniquity and I will remember their sin no no no no more no more remember no more Jeremiah Prophet Jeremiah spoke it Hebrews 8:12 again it's repeated by Paul the Apostle I will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more might took the microphone right right right now started hearing went all the way to the back I'll start with myself and and ask you this do you got a record somewhere I'm talking about out there in the world not don't I'm not just saying a trick question but I'm asking you this there's things you done you're you're terribly ashamed of but you know what I don't I don't Harbor on that I look to the blood the Holiness of the blood I'm just as holy right now I am justified by the blood of Jesus Christ I truly repented I've confessed my sins I've identified myself in water into baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost In My Soul burning out the old man supernaturally PR tell me how could you even go to a great white Throne when he doesn't he remembered if you let's just say don't want to plant any seed in your mind but let's say you come up there and you're real believer you're really like all he see would be the Lamb's blood and his robe of righteousness because right now we are in judgment judement judgment must begin at the house of God so you're already there but you're standing here baptized and immersed in the precious blood not just the blood but the life of the blood flowing through you supernaturally has transformed your soul taken away the old man the old sin nature of unbelief whether he's Pagan or religious thought I'd throw that one in there don't matter he's dead he's dead because Christ can't live in the same house that's why our Pentecostal friends Baptist friends and so forth like that they can never come to this until they receive the opening of the word and see what the lamb has done for them they'll stand apart in state some of them praise God for that but they're not exonerated that's why they sang the song of Moses standing brother B said standing on a sea of glass like like fire what was it he said those are the people that go through the tribulation period they had to be purged but they sing the song of Moses praise God for that that's why we need to pray for people I don't I i' I I witnessed to somebody I gave him message books gave him brother R books I'm not worried about it I I ain't going to spin my tires keep spinning my tires with them but just pray for them and let them alone all you can do is seow the seed and and let God do the whatever he'll take care of it now he says I will be merciful to their unrighteousness their sins and iniquities will I remember no more it just destroys the doctrine of having to stand before God then and what are you what are they trying to say that the blood that they believe in which I'm not saying they don't believe the blood of Jesus Christ but they have no understanding to know that it goes to the deepest recesses of your heart and eliminates the old man they don't have that understanding that's why they got their wires all tangled up messed up mixed up you're like a bunch of wondering well I can make a statement there but don't be too hard on them say can help [Music] it I don't know who is elect and I don't know who is but I'm believeing I'm elect and I believe I'm looking at elect here tonight or I wouldn't be standing here wasting in my time in this Pulpit neither would brother sha and any of these other ministers be standing up here and preaching if they didn't believe that there's elect coming in this assembly amen I hope I don't sound too mean and harsh my voice to thank the Lord I pray God give me a good voice tonight and uh I've had trouble with it maybe I'm just kind of really going out there so you can adjust the volume if you need to but he said how much more shall the blood of Christ through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God without spot that was a that was the Perfection of the sacrifice without spot to God Purge your conscience now he's not going to say well I can I can come before God but see this is the way the denominational minds think they think yes oh yes Jesus Jesus but like brother Donny Reagan said years ago is Jesus in the manger praise the Lord but you go in the manger what you go down to the baptismal pool what you go to mount Transfiguration and adoption what and you know what I say to that wish you not that Jesus was the beginning of the creation of God and if he not to be sarcastic sound sarcastic but if he's the beginning of the creation of God then there's got to be some more the beginning there's got to be an Omega there's got to be a body follow the hand you're new creatures in Christ Jesus I'm a new creation I'm a brand new man old things pass away and All Things become new [Laughter] okay blessed be the Lord Jesus God shall wipe away Revelation 21:4 wipe away all tears from from their eyes there shall be no more death did you hear that no more death neither sorrow neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain neither shall there be any more pain my memory as much as hard as I try and I can tell you this brother and sister blessed is a man who stays in the word and in his law does he meditate day and night many times we find ourselves weak like I said last Sunday because we got too many other things and then not necessarily those things they can become sin To Us by our negligence neglecting the word of God and Satan knows how to Allure us and I that's why I yeah I'm I'm probably somebody that's got lots of hobbies I got things that I like to do I like to work on vehicles that's a hobby of mine I like to fix things I like to work with wood as a carpenter when I can and a lot of other stuff I'm a collector so there's plenty to take my attention and I like to ride motorcycle I'll just be honest in case some of you oh you're so Sanctified but I I guess some people got horses I just got a a Horseless two-wheeler so I enjoy riding out in the country I like doing that yeah that's my hobby I guess everybody can buy an expensive gun and go out in the woods and sit there and freeze to death Been There Done brother Levi you've had more Fortune than I've had I've stood all day brother and not seeing hardly a white tail but sometimes the Lord has blessed and there's nothing wrong with those things provided he stays first place so that the enemy cannot come in now no a parallel I don't know better not get into that but there's a balance to things why we're on this Earth we can't walk around like a bunch of monks I was in some Holiness Wesley and Holiness meetings years ago they only dressed in black and white if you ask me I think they look like a bunch of vultures so straight-faced thought they were so Sanctified they couldn't hardly laugh at anything boy what kind of a home do you think they had I'm not mocking them people some of them I know is very sincere you get around some of them people that I was around brother Sean I'm telling you I walked into a meeting one time I was the only man there with a short sleeve shirt on woo boy I noticed it right away had a big bonfire at that used camp out there in the woods and they said anybody got any short sleeve shirts you want to get rid of bur rest not a time I guess I just didn't get Sanctified to their level boy talk about being enough to drive some people away but I hung in there but you know I couldn't stand around that kind of stuff self-made righteousness brother random talks about that in 64 he talks about the the the pilgrim Holiness and and those different ones and and how they they they have their standards and so forth I'm not saying there may be a reason a man wears a long sleeve shirt he might have tattoos going up his arm he running not that he can't get rid of he'd rather not be offensive to people judge not that you be not judged you don't know why you're a brother sister I don't try to push my convictions on anybody else El anything that I don't have word for yet I feel in my heart I shouldn't be doing I'm not going to try to shove it on other people that's just me it's every man every man has to know because you see I know where some of these things take you so I avoid any little any little crack any little crevice that the devil would try to open up to me I avoid it I've learned one thing there's some things you was ever involved in stay away as far as you can you're looking at somebody tonight that messed around with some things that a man no man or woman should ever mess around with I ain't talking about what you may be thinking I'm talking about satanic power don't open those doors matter of fact it's even it's got into the message young people you're seeing a even adults is seeing a power of God manifest demons being cast out and you're opening the door and let them them back in forgive me flee the very appearance of evil these videos that show monsters and all this horrible stuff is demonic it is absolutely demonic and I speak for one that's had problems with that in the past and I warn you in the name of Jesus Christ don't never go that way don't ever go the devil's way no matter what it is you're messing with stuff that you we I better leave that alone well I don't know how got on that now we find out that brother rhom says this in a sermon forgive me I've got to put my lenses on do you think I'm being ugly tonight I you know I'm shouting up here but I don't mean to blast you brother Bram says this confessing our sins recking ourselves dead buried with him in baptism raised with him in his resurrection what to set in Heavenly places with him that's where we are at tonight sitting not physically spiritually our minds our thoughts our souls are far beyond the cares of the world right now what are we in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus how do we get into it by one Spirit he says in 1 Corinthians 12th chapter by one Spirit are we are all baptized by the holy goes into one body of Believers the mystical Kingdom of God in there we look back now listen to this in there we look back and see where we used to lie and steal and cheat and smoke and do the things that's wrong we've raised from that resurrected we we're in Heavenly places what is it the evidence that someday we'll have a body like his own glorious body it's the exact evidence of the Resurrection because potentially we are already raised with him potentially we've already died now here's the paragraph William renam that used to live doesn't live no more he's been dead some 30 odd years now it's a new creature listen to this Orman Neville that used to live isn't living anymore he died many years before that this is a new creature Orman Neville's dead the horse racer Gambler whatever he was the man that once lived is dead I don't know brother nille wasn't that but whatever it was he's guilty of all of it guilty of the least it's guilty of the whole ever what you were you are a sinner that's what you are now I jumped down a few paragraphs like to read more of this but we've limited on our time he says and look back where I once was now I'm above that why by his grace he Lifted Me Up and here I am now sitting in Heavenly places in Christ oh my there you are then the Bible now here here is the a key phrase then the Bible becomes a new book lord I pray that God will open our eyes tonight to recognize what is wrote between these covers and to recognize the voice of God and to recognize the voice of of Satan because the description is given in this book how Satan approached people how he talked to people caused people to stumble albe it temporarily and that's why Jesus brother Shan said when Satan said I got it right here Jesus it is written and Jesus says oh but it is also written again you left out part of it devil you ain't going to pull the W over my eyes it is also written again that's where our denominational friends get sold on these doctrines of devils that's how they get caught up and they don't believe in the the imbalance to predestination or the IMB bence to uh what was the other other side of the coin there uh arminianism they got all filed up on one side of the other because they don't see the junction of the scriptures they don't keep the middle of the road the crown of the road he says a new book you're reading it through spiritual eyes and spiritual understanding then you see the nouns and pronouns then you see the Junctions and conjunctions I mean so forth in the Bible now I'm just going to read one thing we've told this story several times I know other preachers here have preached on this I believe that brother brandom gave this vision for many many purposes and I believe this this thing this is why it's so important that's why Hosea I believe it's Hosea 46 my people people are destroyed for the lack of knowledge Revelation they're destroyed when you don't know what to do and you feel like you should be doing something but Satan has jumped in front of you somehow it kept you out of the word and you Mo immobilized your mind you got a lot of stuff up here instead of the word of God that's why I said even last Sunday some Baptist put us to shame and that ought not be every person in here ought to know the Bible frontwards and backwards at least to the extent that you could do it to know the scriptures the dry word as I would call it it's good to know the scripture amen goes for me too I'm preaching up myself brother brand said you know the story I I just call it this it's my my terminology so Sunday morning brother Bram wants to get breakfast he can't find it he's been in a holy ghost speeding up the street the sick are being healed demons cast up people getting saved filled with the Holy Ghost he's hungry little Amish or men night restaurant whatever it was isn't open on Sundays so he's got to go down to Joe's Bar and Grill and you know what was going on there we don't have to go into all the details you can look it up you can and brother Rand gets to and that poor woman turns out she was a daughter of a pastor and she knew brother Brandon was up the street preaching and having meetings she was horribly backslid entertaining men half drunk men a lot of devilish other stuff on going on in that place God made brother randam hungry that morning I don't know if he ever sat down and got breakfast but God had a purpose because cuz there was a sheep in there and maybe others I don't know he don't really say if there was but he had to have a testimony go from a holy ghost meeting this place ain't very clean some of us used to go in some of these places that uh you had to watch where you walk vomit all over the floor bartender didn't have time to mop it all up I'm just being plain I I don't know why we get to painting these sanctimonious pictures brother brand said a state police Trooper was over there playing a slot machine with his arm around the waist of some woman playing a gambling machine I'm not knocking I'm just telling you what he said there's a motorcycle gang in there young boys their pants halfway down and they're trying to get a date with some teenage girl or whatever that's the kind of environment that was in that place but little did they know the pillar of fire was about ready to manifest itself in a supernatural way and a man of God humbly goes in there he starts condemning that woman my God he said you I got to raise my children up in this kind of a world and the Holy Spirit starts grabing him by the shoulder I got to talk to you my my son takes some over beside the door and you know what happened the Earth the spray of blood around the earth he said that's the reason I you know I I can't quote the exact words I've got it up here but he said blood spraying around it every time I'd do something wrong my sin would go start before God God would slay me for it think about that but Jesus was standing there like a bumper he caught it I seen the tears run down his cheeks I went up to him he said Lord I'm ashamed of myself there laid my book my book my book not the Lamb's Book his old book Layon there his blood and he said wait a minute my sins were he said I do something else blad his blood would holy keep it from touching me from K from killing me God would kill me in the day you eat thereof he quotes the scripture in the day you eat thereof that you die and I looked at it there in the vision I went up to Lord I'm a shame of myself there laid my book laying there with all kinds of evil now I hear that really good cuz some of us that think the prophet was way up there so spiritual I could take you to a quot and show you where brother randam had to get his window in his house fixed to the second time cuz they locked their keys in there and then people say he was a master of all circumstance I beg the differ with you if he would have been that way that wouldn't have been fair to you and I he had the same battles a vehicle breaking down he had to he had those same things said he just had to win and repaired and don't lo and behold they locked the keys in the house again and he's got to go back to the routine again and break the window to get the door open from the inside is anybody hearing me he says I was hunting a grizzly somewhere up north and he said he I was trying to get a picture of him but he wouldn't cooperate with me he said I was riding a horse and that horse he just didn't want to be cooperative with me so you think you know he could get on a horse and that thing be wild as a buck a Bronco or whatever an unbroken horse and the horse just calms down oh I got a man of God on there I'm not saying it couldn't be couldn't have been that way sometimes that was sovereignly given and he said that horse in addition to the grizzly didn't want to cooperate with me I thank God for a man of God to just be honest say hey you're made I'm made all the same stuff you you all are that's the kind of a prophet I'm going to be able to follow you can't picture Jesus was Jesus a man did he eat did he sweat did he have a heart that pumped blood did he have a digestive tract where do we get this in our minds some Vision or some picture that we' seen years years ago religious picture of Jesus the holy Son of God and I'm not mocking that but it's created this image that wasn't Jesus at all he was made all the same stuff you he was tempted in all points as we in a l points as we so this image that somehow we've conjured and I tell you it comes from unbelief it comes when people try to interpret the word of God with a mental capability it don't work that way you find yourself way out on planet Pluto somewhere that's how far you get off the word that's how far that Branch prary goes out there some of them got out there and they don't know how to come back come back to the trunk of the tree well he he reached down he said did my sins cause you to die for me he's a l lamb please forgive my sins won't do it no more he reached down tapped his hand and like this wrote across my book with its own blood pardon I've done it he just chucked it yeah he chucked it brother Ram's old book after he wrote pardoned he didn't put it somewhere and said you know I've got A Sneak and hunch when you you still don't have faith when you have those kinds of thoughts about God you need to ask God to give you perfect Faith because you'll think if you're bone of his bone brother jiah and flesh of his flesh power of his power Spirit of his Spirit you and he are one you got a lot we got a lot going for us brother we got a whole lot going for us that's with the revelation of Truth which Satan tries to hide us from so he says Thank You Lord I'll do and and he goes on to say that anyway he opened up a new book I believe it was a Lamb's Book the Lord Brother Brandman had a page in there or a verse or whatever you've got you've got a place in there too your name's in there I believe my names in that book it was a new book and I like to say the book of Acts of the Holy Ghost he had brother randam the book of Acts and brother sha the book of Acts and brother Josiah by the Holy Ghost you'll write another book of Acts sister my now more we could read on that we'll see say that for another time brother Ram said since the opening of those seals this has become a new book that's what the seals did it un the lamb unlocked the Mysteries that had been tied up with denominational teachings and beliefs which originate from Satan by the way they tied up the word of God and Holy Ghost but when the evening time message when the lamb had opened the seals it also released the fullness of the Holy Ghost a very Supernatural life of God to come into the believer through a new birth cuz they couldn't have another living husband to get to that level now brother BR said and this is what we've talked about invisible Union here we are today L A see the bride just as clear you can't be a virtuous Bible believing Christian and Associate yourself in a denominational Affair you just can't do it at the same time one's got to be dead to let the other live in other words a woman can't have two living husbands neither can you bear God's word Sons neither can the church bring forth okay he goes on to say now it was nature associated with death the same invisible Union your first husband that had ruled over you was your Nature by natural birth natural you love the world because you are the world and part of the world your desires was by nature to love the world which you're a part of he says you're a part of nature you believe that and that's your natural thing that's the reason you have to be born again you have to separate you have to die to that first husband you can't live with it let me tell you something we're not preaching a Baptist sermon we're not preaching a Baptist message we're not preaching uh an Evangelical or whatever message we're preaching a word message ordained for the hour that produ Supernatural person you have to separate you have to die to that first husband you can't live with it no sir well he says I well you just can't say well I'll divorce them hang him up here till the occasion now ain't don't work that way no sir no writing our divorcement he dies the nature of the world has to die every Speck of him has to die you have to be reunited again with another nature he goes on to say the call of the Holy Spirit searching the hearts you're standing completely you never sin in the first place God don't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness and in the sea of forgetfulness Paul the Apostle at the church of Corinth there was the elect predestinated seat of God in that place you talk about a lens sensual place because it lists sins and Paul goes on to mention even effeminate there was this there was there was all kinds of immoral impurity immoral Lifestyles but God saw seeds God saw a son God saw a daughter in that prostitute when our precious brother Paul oh oh my oh when need preach the gospel many the Devils came out of out of people and they begin to live holy lives and they come to church like this and no doubt a woman come in and a man come in and they greet one another God bless you Sister God bless you brother maybe she had been a woman of ill Fame and he was one of their clients her class are you all hearing me I remember what God told Peter in that that that that that sheet that came down what God has cleansed oh my and Paul brought that communion wine and that bread and he began to serve it and Paul knowing their backgrounds yet the love that he felt because there part of the body and the precious Bond of love was in that place dur that communion service here was hands that had been hands and fingers of iniquity and sin and transgressions now they're alive in Christ Paul with tears streaming Downs his cheeks looks at trophies of Grace trophies of the Gospel transformed lives the same woman same boy walking down the street this time instead of acting like little walking with his hair trimmed in a look of Innocence don't tell me the blood can't give you that kind of experience oh yes it can and that woman who was a harlot that sold herself and that was a practice back then may have even had diseases in her own body he yet she was made Holy by the precious blood of Jesus Christ and she comes through that line and Paul's crying thank you Lord Jesus God bless you my sister and she he and his deacons serve her the bread and the wi oh Paul said of such for some of you but he is washed you wasn't not to start with you weren't that the devil tried to hold you in that mess you're washed you're Sanctified you're birthed you got the Holy Ghost you're Son of God Amen seen that innocent looking woman he say innocent yeah yes innocent as the lamb walking down the street say they're over there chisling on blocks of marble whoa who was that she look familiar wasn't that the party girl that we went to see what's happened to her transformation even in that vessel that's the power of the Gospel the power of God to transform you would never think they had such a profession why is it mentioned that's the theme tonight Paul said it's for examples in the book of First Corinthians they are given for admonishing us the history of the elect now I'm going to drop something on you I'm going to have to wind this up see the new book you read the Old Testament it's a temporary written record that God does not even remember now what is what we have now is what they had what they also possess so you see why the accuser this book is all over the world and it tells the good the bad the ugly the righteous and the evil I got a list up here this this is what really hit me Adam and Eve the fall Noah got drunk job questioned Jacob deceived Abraham lied Sarah laughed look at Judah one of the sons of I believe was Jacob well he was a carnal man Joseph lied he's guilty and Elise is guilty the whole don't whitewash it all have sinned and come short of the glory of God yes he was a man he was truly elect God was preserving him God kept him he would have kept Judah well I better not go down that road but when he was in Piper's house God had placed Integrity in his heart don't tell me he wasn't tempted but he would not displease the Lord but he told a lie he caved Under Pressure because Pharaoh did not like Shepherds they were cattle raisers and then we find sins of Jacob how he did what he did deception Moses killed an Egyptian Soldier or guard he got angry Samuel man he was a real prophet of God but look what happened to his sons and I'm not casting blame on him but just look at look at what happened that follow at some of these people jeffa he's found in the book of Hebrews we spoke on him a lot of people don't want to accept it he's I believe he was elect of God God puts his place here is seed sometimes in the most peculiar places the strangest places that we can't even understand I could tell you people in this message but I'm not going to do it I'd happen to know people in this message that have really God has done great things in their lives I I could go further with that but I better not Samson great man of God womanizer he just couldn't stay with his own he had to go down there and mess around with the very ones that God called him to deliver Israel from he starts messing around with Elijah run from a woman David guilty of adultery and murder Elisha angry prophet yeah Jonah complexes I wonder if he wasn't maybe a had a little bit of uh what do you call it uh not Grace but uh what's the other word for that can't think of it right now but he thought judgment should strike you that's that was his mindset God had to teach him a lesson but he's still an elect of God Peter lied over in the New Testament denied the Lord and cursed even after they got the Holy Ghost they had sharp contention between some of the Apostles and the different workers evangelists or whatever that were with them you remember John Mark and all of that that's a written record but you want to know something in the mind of God it never happen in the first place they're Justified yet we read it why because Paul said it's there for an example nobody walks up to anybody over there in that other realm and says if I just don't under why in why that kind of thinking ain't going to make it in there let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus if you have the mind of God you ain't going to walk up to David and say David what in the world why didn't you get off that rooftop but yet the Bible says he was a man after God's Own Heart brother BR said Saul was saved so King Saul David didn't walk up to Saul [Music] Saul you slayed your thousands why did you why were you trying to kill me on Earth that thinking didn't make it over there thank God for that no doubt when they Join one another David come with open arms oh my precious brother why I don't I don't know the the full extent of everything there but I'll tell you one thing there was no evil anymore to trouble people especially when that blood was made retroactive there at the cross and went backwards he led captivity out of that prison cell of paradise there's nobody over there fighting each other right now that is all forgotten they're all Justified except those who rejected those who died in the flood can they're still got a record that exists that God still remembers because they didn't accept the preaching of Noah they've got to come up to right Throne judgment the men of Sodom have to come up there Dayan and Cor in their crowd they got to come up to the great white Throne judgment all those Israelites are rejected who who wared against God or didn't believe perished in the wilderness went to Brother BR said they were lost they got to come up at the great wi Throne judgment there's a record there for them God can't forget that they didn't repent their sins are following them to judgment now here we have all these people but God doesn't even remember Moses getting angry he doesn't remember the sins of David David even said I believe he was in one BL blessed is man whose God does not impute sin unto him though he's forgotten never cast into the sea of God's forgetfulness let's just stand it's Cast Away it's over it's finished they're waiting on you and I they're waiting on you and I and then we'll all be caught up together to meet the Lord in the air you're waiting on us God doesn't have to go back to the past with his elect and and get get think it's already squared away I I had a quote up here and I don't know if I can read it here in closing taken from the church age book it's showing that God forgets I want you to watch this carefully now and see something really sweet and beautiful I said This is the End Time revelation of himself when the day of Grace closes then the Millennium comes very shortly thereafter doesn't it well read with me Isaiah 65:16 and 19 and he I won't take the time to read all of this but he says because the former troubles are forgotten because they are HID from mine eyes for behold I create new Heavens new Earth former Earth former shall not be remembered nor come into mind you're already in that place you're already there you're You're A New Earth brother Sean we're A New Earth so to speak we're made God has Tabernacle himself in us the inner man we're ruling this outer man he says for behold I create new Heavens new Earth nor shall not be remembered nor coming into mind but be ye glad and rejoice he goes on to finish that scripture this is about the New Jerusalem this is a millennium but as we go into the Millennium hear what he says about being a certain kind of God verse 16 that he who blessed himself in the Earth shall bless himself in the god of truth yes that is true but the real translation is not God of Truth it is is God of the amen so we read it shall bless himself in the god of the amen and he that sweareth in the Earth shall swear by the god of the amen because the former troubles are forgotten wow the former troubles are forgotten because they are HID from my eyes for behold I created new heavens and a new Earth the former shall not be REM remembered nor come into mine but be ye glad and rejoice forever he says finishing this word verse I create Jerusalem a rejoicing and her people of Joy I will rejoice in Jerusalem and joy my people in the voice of weeping shall be heard in her nor the voice of crying Hallelujah here is Jehovah of the Old Testament the god of the amen here is Jesus of the New Testament the god of the amen here over Israel the Lord thy God is [Music] one there's actually another quote [Music] here now if I can find [Music] that but God has completely it's here on paper it's around the world of all these elect sins it's there Satan knows it but there's another promise in there that says he's cast all sins into the sea of his forgetfulness so Satan the accuser comes up says well Sister Lisa there she's got a record she did this she did that the other day and [Music] accuses oh there's people even heard it and there going around you see Lord over there they're gossiping about Sister [Music] Lisa yeah really but Satan you missed something I see her down there on the knees confessing to me her sin and getting right with the Lord getting right with me I don't know what sin you're even talking about because I I don't remember it Satan stop and think about that despite a written record in the mind of God and I say to you what really is God's word when you read in the Book of Genesis in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and he saw that it was good and he created he created and then you hear the hiss of the serpent that wasn't God's word Eve was trying to recognize something has God said look at all these other things where it tells the mistakes and Disobedience that people made that wasn't God's word but it's there as an example someday the written record of that is going to disappear forever it'll not even come into mind it ain't even in God's mind now and it really we're we're still troubled by memory we remember we remember you know the Holy Spirit can come down and anoint us to preach things that God has completely forgotten and he don't remember it I can stand up here and say it and say it and say it about David and Noah and all these others but God don't even remember it it don't jog his memory it don't bring it up out of some deep memory B cuz it's not even [Music] there think about that where are you if that is the way it's with them what about you and I Brother come on and help me sing that song about the old account and I want you to know we're free we are absolutely free you shall know the truth and the truth shall there is no for now no [Music] condemnation what God has claim called not unclean why do we call ourselves unclean well I I I had this happen to me I oh I know I I go through that too but don't dwell there look to the blood look to what he did for you make new memories

the hill don't remember that anymore because you're having a good time being drunk on the Holy Ghost the fresh word of God knowing that there's not even a smell of sin against you Lord ain't going to walk up to you and I brother Bill and say what's that I smell you've been smoking no no it's finished it's finished no we ain't been smoking I'm talking about lingering lingering memories come to
