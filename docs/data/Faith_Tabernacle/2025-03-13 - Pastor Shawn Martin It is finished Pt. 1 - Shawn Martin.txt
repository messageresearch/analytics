with every breath that I am able I will sing of the goodness of God sing the last lines I will sing of the goodness of God amen amen amen well I tell you we wouldn't be here tonight if he wasn't faithful amen but we're so thankful that he is amen that he's definitely mindful of us mindful of his word amen and we love the Lord amen I trust everyone had a good day today amen it's good to have our visitors amen let's see Evelyn and Carla right amen and so good to have you all they um uh work with an and Faith there at the Bread Basket and so we're just honored to have them um good to have uh Sister Kim weeks back with us amen trust you had a good time with your family amen and um the musicians can be dismissed amen if you have your Bible we're going to turn to the Book of John and um I believe it's the 19th Chapter it's a beautiful day today amen we'll take all these days we can get amen but um let's see John the 19th Chapter chapter and we're just going to read the 30th verse but it said when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost amen may we just bow our heads in a word of prayer Lord Jesus we're so thankful for your never never failing love toward us you never fail Lord and what you have promised to do you've kept your word we're so thankful Lord that we're in your hands father that we can rest our soul upon every promise that you have given and father we're just asking now that you would just come and meet every need this evening Lord I believe that this meeting has been ordained of you and father we're just under great expectation for you to speak to us Lord and not only to speak but let the word be creative in our soul father pray Lord that you would heal the sick Lord or whatever need it would be we commit this service into your hands father in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen and amen you can have your seats and uh I just have a a simple thought this this evening and and I guess if I would use a title it would be it is finished and um you know it's a simple phrase there but yet it is uh very powerful you know we're we're living as we all know that we're living in a in a time uh where the world is shaking and and um I believe that we could all uh we're all aware that we're living in the end of time and not just an end of a Generation Um or an end of a cycle but we're we're at the end of all history we're at the end of civilization as we know it we're at the end of it all and um and I believe that the Lord is coming really soon I know we you know it's been said for years and years that the Lord is coming but we're we're seeing things just uh transpire rapidly and uh uh that lets us know that uh the coming of the Lord is imminent and it's not a figment of our imagination uh uh but we can we can match the the uh things that are happening by Prophecy in the scriptures and of course Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of lot and he gives the comparison that there would be a day that would be just like the days of Noah just like it was in the days of lot and he would tell us that would be at the time of the coming and and the revealing of the son of man and would be at the end of the world and we can truly say we're living in a day just like it was in the days of Noah and as the days of lot and so uh and and I I truly believe that people know that the world is coming to an end we're talking uh it's just constantly you know here lately about world war three and and um uh they're trying to avoid that and and things because they know that if it happens we're not just It's Not Just Guns and and bows and arrows anymore it's uh nuclear powers and and atomic and and things that would destroy the world and so people are are living in constant fear uh because they don't know the future um they they don't know what really holds for them and you know uh which is again another thing that Jesus had said there in Luke 21 and 25 he said there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity the sea the waves are roaring men's Hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken ain't that right and we find that that uh uh you know a lot of people maybe that that um uh claim to be Christians they're unsure of God's love for them and uh it seems like the gospel somehow today has been taken away from the grace of God and and the ability of God uh to to where it's been perverted uh and and the focus is on dos and don'ts and what you should do what you shouldn't do and and these things and so we try to to Merit our way we we try to to be good enough and all these things but we find out that uh but it's not taking away the problems uh you know and and so I I I believe that Jesus made it so that his children don't have to fear about the future I believe that the uh uh God made it to where his his children don't have to worry about the present things that are taking place we don't have to fear anything that comes our way how many believes that you don't have to fear the doctor's uh uh prognosis you don't have to fear you know when the stock market goes uh uh kapoot and you you don't have to fear when trouble is on every side you don't have to fear you know when maybe your child goes Wayward and uh uh you don't have to fear there there's a place amen that God has provided that we don't have to fear these things and and I know trouble is on every side and I know that the world is getting more wicked and and and people don't seem to have the answers as to what but the the Bible has the answers we have the answers as to to what is going on and yet we don't have to fear uh uh about the these things and and the reason we don't have to fear is because of Calvary how many's glad for Calvary well I'm glad for Calvary um uh because it was that Calvary that Jesus said it is finished it is finished and so what a come Fort them words are to us it it is finished and and I I looked up the word finished it means entirely done amen there's nothing else left to do there's there's no work left you know there there's no need to go back and redo things again uh uh I I if it's finished it's perfect it's it's it's done it's um uh you know and and so time is still ticking but it is finished amen and uh uh the the world is is in a chaos but it is finished that's that's what Jesus said ain't that right and and to think that it was finished before you and I was even born amen of what Jesus is saying and we got to look at what Jesus is meaning by it is finished amen uh uh you know there you know if God takes us home uh there's going to be things that will be left undone for us amen uh you may have plans you may have goals you may have whatever and and I I guess you know just with uh Naturally carnally Speaking no one is ready to to leave the Earth amen we've always got something to do and so that's not what God is uh Jesus was saying when he said it is finished so there must be something that uh God was after a man that God was working for there was a goal that God was was trying to to reach and and and when Jesus said it is finished that means god finished the goal God finished what he was after God finished it was God's time can you say Amen everything is God's time amen so we we look the work of redemption is finished how many believes that amen uh uh uh that's that's what Calvary was was the work of redemption and the apost aost Paul picks up on this and says there in Hebrews 10 And1 we are Sanctified everybody say we are Sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all it is finished ain't that right then he goes in the 12th verse and he says after he had offered one sacrifice for sins uh one sacrifice for sins forever he sat down on the right hand of God the 14th verse for by one offering he has perfected forever them that are Sanctified see it is finished ain't that right so there there's no Topsy Turvy and ups and downs there's no saved once today and lost tomorrow it is finished amen the work of redemption so he'll never have to uh to come back and die for us he'll never have to come back and shed his blood and and and be an an atonement and uh all of these things we were Sanctified once for all and are perfected forever how many believes that amen then the Apostle Peter picks up on it as well and and saying this in in 1 Peter 2:24 who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree that being dead to sins should live un righteousness by whose stripes we were healed not going to be healed but were healed not going to be perfected we were perfected not going to be Sanctified we were Sanctified everything about Calvary the purpose of Calvary and what Calvary was after God was after to achieve at Calvary amen it was finished ain't that right see and so uh uh uh brother brandham says while you're here seeking out God for your salvation and for your healing that everything that God can do for you he's already done it how many believes that God's already done it amen so while we're looking for God to to do something for us well he's already done it so so we we have to look at what Calvary really meant it is finished amen see and and so it it every sin is for forgiven every sin think of that now is Forgiven every sickness is healed the only thing you have to do is look to Calvary and accept what God has already done for you there it is it's already finished your healing is finished your salvation is finished amen your Perfection is finished amen everything is finished amen at Calvary see so then it it is already finished Jesus said at Calvary it is finished he says then if I was saved I'd say well I got saved 20 years ago no I was saved 1900 years ago at Calvary ain't that right see I just accepted it 20 years ago see so God there when Christ died he paid the penalty of both sin and sickness so it is finished ain't that right you may have things that you're going to be doing for the rest of your life but but don't worry about that look at what God done and God's work is finished what he started out to do in your life and what he started out to do in Redemption it is finished now this is why Paul in Romans 8:38 says I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord see that's what Calvary means amen Satan had you in his grip amen Satan had you as a slave his Slave at at and and you done his bidding but at Calvary it was finished his power was broken his influence was broken and now there's nothing that's going to to be able to separate you from the love of God nothing that's what Calvary meant aren't you glad for that amen see so there's no worrying over it there's no fretting about it it is finished God does not want us to to worry about our future he does not want us to worry about our past he doesn't want us to worry about our present it is finished amen see it's brought to a completed State amen God's work of redemption amen was brought to a completed State ain't that right you see it was God's plan in the beginning to save he you know uh as as we know God Amen he was savior he was Redeemer he was healer uh he he was a way maker he was provider he was all of these things was in God the attributes of God but it could not be expressed uh uh unless man had sin amen man had fallen so God allowed man to sin and to fall that it would it would be able God would be able to express an attribute of Savior an an attribute of of Redeemer of healer can you say Amen so then we we know God in a greater way than Adam did in the beginning because Adam didn't know God if as as a Healer as a savior as a a redeemer before the fall yes he had relationship with God but not in the way that you have relationship with God can you say man so it was in God's plan to save and to heal and to redeem you and the plan was finished at Calvary do you believe that amen see so you don't need God to come down and and and come to a body of uh uh uh as he did in Christ and and to die all over again for your sins and every time you fall and make a mistake and and all of these things it's already done so it doesn't matter how bad it gets in your life it is finished it doesn't matter how you feel it is finished can you say amen amen you know uh uh uh and and and Satan cannot undo what God has already done he can't undo what God did at Calvary he can't stop the power of Calvary he can't uh diminish the power of Calvary no matter how bad of a sinner we were amen God was able to reach down and to save our soul it is finished can you say Amen it was finished for the baby it was finished for the teenager it was finished for the worst Harlot the worst uh uh drug addict the worst murderer it was finished on that day at Calvary I'm so glad GL for that see and so Calvary made a way for the Holy Ghost to be given into the hands of the church amen to impart life amen that's what Calvary meant amen uh the the prophet of God says it took stooped degraded men and women and lifted them into a place to be Sons and Daughters of God to heal the sick and to impart eternal life aren't you glad for that that we wouldn't have to remain Sinners and we wouldn't have to remain uh under the devil's influence and and to be vagabonds and Beggars spiritually and and and to to claim Christianity and not have a relationship with God Amen but at Calvary it was finished amen God was able to redeem us and make us Sons and Daughters of his to where we could come back in relationship with him not as a sinner not as a beggar not as a stranger we don't come to God as Sinners we don't come to God as as Beggars and and and helpless people amen Calvary amen made the difference it made a way to where we could come back as Sons and Daughters of God Amen so uh uh uh so so this is what Calvary meant it gave the Holy Ghost to obedient Believers men who were one unbelievers made them Believers and impart spiritual eternal life see so Calvary paid the price it paid your price amen of what was required it paid the price of redemption and it settled the question forever amen though your sins be as Scarlet uh as the Bible says uh they will shall be white as snow amen red like Crimson white like wool see then the uh uh brother br says you have no sin think of that now you have no sin amen you have no sin why because at Calvary it was finished amen there's a Power in the Blood of Jesus Christ amen you have no sin you are perfectly sinless no matter what you done or what you do you're still sinless as long as you've accepted Jesus Christ as your savior your sin are forgiven and anything that is Forgiven is remitted and forgot about now think of that now we can remember what we've done we can remember our mistakes amen and Satan is good uh uh to remind us of our sins but you can't remind God of them if your sins are under the blood and they've been confessed unto the father amen now I understand we were once Sinners and and yes we come to the altar wherever and we gave our our hearts to the Lord and we truly accepted Christ amen as our savior as our sacrifice and and and these things amen and God filled us with his spirit amen and do you realize you'll never be a sinner again amen you can't be a s God would never look at you as a sinner again because he looks at the blood that is covering you yes you may fall and yes we have to repent and say God I'm sorry but you don't come to him as a sinner you come to him as a son and daughter of God ain't that right amen see and so Christianity see is based uh uh uh not on the future and it's not based upon the present but it's it's based upon what has been done not based upon what's going to be done but based upon what has been done ain't that right see so so many times we think God has got to do something uh uh be before you know uh anything happens but that's not true and and most of us know these things and so uh but you bear with me but Romans 8:28 it says and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose not the purpose of the church not the purpose of mom and dad or the preacher but according to God's purpose for whom he did Forno he he also did predestinate past tense to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified ain't that right so think of it God fornew us he called us he predestinated us he justified us and he already glorified us amen and and and this was uh uh before we were ever born ain't that right now notice and I've got some scriptures but Isaiah 55 and10 God says for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but WTH the Earth and make it it bring forth and Bud that it may give seed to the seow and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not somebody say it shall not it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whero I sent it ain't that right so God's word is going to prosper God's word is going to be accomplished ain't that right Amen in in Matthew 243 5 Jesus said Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall never amen shall not pass away ain't that right see so God forew us which means that we were in his thinking amen at the beginning before the foundation of the world we were in his thinking and by his word he predestinated us aren't you glad God thought of you now we have thoughts amen and and some sometimes they they're just a thought and we think well why did I think that or man you know and and then it's what you know what was I thinking about you know it's just a passing thought it could be a sudden thought it it surprises us with these thoughts sometimes but God's thinking God had a thought and their Eternal thoughts for God himself is eternal so if God is eternal then his love for us is eternal God God doesn't love you today and then hate you tomor right he he always loves you he's an eternal God so there's nothing about him that can that that can pass away there's nothing about him that can be here today and gone tomorrow amen if he loved you today he loves you tomorrow if he loves you tomorrow amen he'll love you forever now you're the one and I'm the one that feels good some days and we have our bad days we we make mistakes and and we do all of these things but God's love never fails it remains because and it's eternal love well then if if his eternal if his love is eternal his Joy is eternal well then what about his thoughts God's thoughts are Eternal they're not thoughts that just come through his mind and just pass away and or he don't remember what he was thinking about you know they're Eternal thoughts so God fornew Us in his mind and by his word he predes destinated Us by his word he called us by his word which is an eternal word because it come from an eternal God ain't that right by his word he justified Us by his word he glorified us and that word will not pass away but it will accomplish that what he sent it to do and it shall prosper this is why in Jeremiah 2911 God speaks through the Prophet saying for I know the thoughts that I think toward thee toward you sayith the Lord thoughts of Peace ain't that right so when God thought their thoughts of Peace toward us not of evil to give you an expected end ain't that right so our our end isn't something that we just wondering where are we going to end up at and no it's an expected end because God gave us an expected end ain't that right right I know we go through troubles and I know we go through hard times and I know we have our ups and downs but in through it all we've got an expected end that God has given to us yes sir amen job 23:13 it says but he God is uh in one mind and who can turn him and what his soul desireth even that he doeth for he performeth the thing that is appointed for me aren't you glad for that God Amen appointed the thing that is a uh performeth the thing that he has appointed for me amen and there's nothing that can turn him from it now see we tend to bring God down to our level amen and that's just common amen uh uh we think well if we can't do it then God can't do it if we if if we fail God fails if if uh you know if if if we're infinite well then God must be infinite if we're helpless then God is helpless if we don't know the future well then God doesn't know the future and if things are out of our hands then then then then it just it it must be out of God's hands and it just looks like everything is is just going crazy and not only the world going crazy but it seems like sometimes our own lives are going crazy and the things we're going through is just out of control but that ain't with God we can never put God and make God like we are amen that's true see amen you see God doesn't have to wait to see what happens like we do amen sometime before we plan things we have to wait and to see you know if we want to go on vacation maybe we have to wait to see if the money comes in or make sure to see if the car doesn't break down and and to see where we're at and see if something unexpected or maybe we do plan for vacations and or plan to do something and then something unexpected comes up and we have to cancel the plans and and all of these things but God never has to cancel one thing he doesn't have to wait to see what you will do he doesn't have to wait to see what the economy will do he doesn't have to wait to see what the politicians will do amen he just plans it and it's going to happen just that way amen that's why he could predestinate you that's why he could he could already justify us and glorify us and call us because he's God can you say amen he doesn't have to wait amen before he acts amen see in Isaiah 55 and9 God says for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts so God does have thoughts don't he and he says my thoughts are higher than your thoughts amen because our thoughts are temporal amen we can change our mind in a heartbeat we can we can say well I'm going to do this you know and then tomorrow totally change and and we have to change maybe be our our thoughts and and plans because of the situations but God's thoughts are Eternal and they will never change because he can't change his thoughts are perfect because he is perfect God doesn't think unperfect thoughts the Bible says his ways are perfect can you say Amen so God isn't like us amen now think of it Isaiah 4017 it says all nations are before him as nothing see and they are counted to him less than nothing and vanity so to whom then will you liken God or what likeness will you compare unto him see we are a creation but God's not a creation he's self-existent he's always existent that he didn't need something outside of him to help him amen and to bring him into existence he's Eternal he's the only one that's Eternal eternal's never had a beginning and it's never had an ending ain't that right so God has always been amen he is Sovereign He Reigns on the throne ain't that right so he is in need of no one and can be hindered by no one amen Daniel 4:35 it says all the inhabitants of the Earth are reputed as nothing and and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth and none everybody say none can stay his hand or say unto him what doest thou ain't that right see so God is above us amen God is so far Supreme higher than us in our ways and and and all of these things he doesn't have to get permission to act he just acts out of his own good counsel he wasn't forced to save you he saved you because he loved you ain't that right amen see and so Proverbs 19:21 there are many devices in a man's heart nevertheless the counsel of the Lord that shall stand so no matter what man decides to do amen it's the counsel of the Lord that shall stand ain't that right Isaiah 46 and9 remember the former things of old for I am God and there is none else I'm God and there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning so this is God declaring the very end of time this age all the way through from the very beginning think of that and from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and I will do all my pleasure well aren't you glad for that so then if God had a plan for us there's nothing that can change God's mind there's nothing that can detour God's God's mind amen for he says my counsel shall stand and I will do all of my pleasure can you say Amen so God is Not constantly coming up with a plan as we go amen through life and maybe we were born and God looks at our you know at us at Birth and says ooh you know I I didn't realize how ugly he was going to be and and and W he just he he I don't know if he'll ever make it I better change my plan about him well God doesn't do them things right amen now we might be considered accidents by our parents amen but to God we're never an accident God knew we were coming and therefore he had planned for us ain't that right so he's not constantly coming up with a plan or revising his plan I I don't know maybe some of us so God you know I'm sure maybe all of us at one point say God I just can't make it you know I just don't know if I can go another day and I just don't know what what's going to happen and all that and so God's looking at us and he's just kind of getting discouraged by our by our grumbling and and us you know and he's like well you know you might be right about that one I better revise this thing you know no God's plan is for sure ain't that right see so he finished his plan before the foundation of the world so not making up another plan or coming up with an addition to his plan the plan was finished before the foundation of the world and he declared the end from the beginning aren't you glad for that as we know it all started out as a thought first of all God's thoughts amen they're Eternal they're real and a word then it become expressed into a Word by speaking it see see a word is a thought expressed ain't that right now what was in God's mind and what he declared is now being manifested coming into materialization ain't that right so we we find that God isn't like us he doesn't work like us he does you know all these things that now God acts God works based of what he knows he knows to be true ain't that right he doesn't check about us and say what do you think about it no no uh uh uh he knows what is true therefore he works accordingly ain't that right now I want to say this he knows that you're going to make it ain't that right see he called you from the beginning he he he uh uh predestinated you from the beginning he justified you and glorified you from the beginning ain't that right now in God's mind that is true you may have been born a sinner but in God's mind he's already called you Justified you predestinated you glorified you and to God that's more true than what you are here can you say Amen what God called you to be is more true than your sins and your failures and you say well I've got complexes what God has called you to be is more true and more real than even your complexes now think of that so God works based off what he knows Amen to be true he didn't save you hoping that you will make it to Heaven he he didn't call you hoping that you you would you would do good for him no no see he knows you're going to make it now watch 2 Timothy 2:19 nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his aren't you glad he knows you amen you might be getting get lost in a crowd somewhere but God still knows who you are there is no sin that can hide from hide you from him amen that Satan couldn't Mar you and disfigure you and Scar you enough to make God not remember you the Lord knows you and he knows you by name amen and his plan he formulated a plan just for you brother Matthew amen just for us so he does not go into panic mode when you make a mistake he isn't there just waiting to pour out his judgment amen every time you fall amen and you get discouraged or or whatever he's actually under great expectation for you to make it amen he's already got an expected end amen and no devil in hell is going to stop that I don't care how discouraged you get I don't care how hard the battle gets sometimes there ain't nothing going to stop what God has already planned for you so God is under great expectation for you to make it amen it's like an expected mother amen she knows that the child's coming and so she's expecting and she has been given you know a date certain around a certain time the baby's coming and they start planning they start making ready am they start getting a baby bed they start you know buying some diapers they start having these baby showers and you know they they start making preparation that way when the baby does arrive they're ready for it ain't that right we we all know what it is amen when you're expecting company to come then then we start making plans for it clean the house and we do this get everything ready amen for for the arrival of the company because we've come under expectation for their arrival ain't that right amen now sometimes you know the company doesn't show up you know and and all that work that we done you know well it it probably needed amen but uh uh uh you know maybe we're disappointed that they weren't able to come or or whatever but notice what Jesus says in John 14 and 2 in my father's house are many mansions ain't that right Amen in my father 's Kingdom in other words amen are are many houses amen if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you hallu ain't that right I go to prepare a place for you now he knows he's the sacrifice he knows the work of Calvary what it's going to do amen everything that God has planned amen will be at Cal C to redeem you back to him to make you Sons and Daughters of God to free you from the devil and his powers and now he says here's what I'm going to do I'm going to prepare a place for you I'm going ahead Amen in the future in future tents preparing a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am you may be there also can you sayen see so he's under expectation amen now now Church he's not just preparing and then just hoping keeping the fingers crossed rubbing the rabbit's foot amen hoping that you're going to make it now you think of this you know let's just say you know he's got the the table spread out and he's got the place and he knows every every place every the got the seat got the place where you're going to be brother Bill and and and and now everything's ready and he's looking at down there at us and he sees you going through some hard times say I don't know you know we might ought to we might ought to scratch that table you know or get pull that chair out because I just don't know brother Bill going to make it no see that's not the way God works and and I tell you that's not the way we should work as well Amen to where I know we get discouraged I know we go through hard times I know there's times amen that that we go through things and we wonder or it just seem like we just can't take it another day but we must rest in in that finished work can you say amen amen he's prepared see he's prepared and this is what Calvary was all about amen God shed his blood I know that's simple but it's deep God shed his blood for you and I amen as as we know we weren't saved by Jewish blood nor were we saved by Gentile blood we were saved by God's blood amen Acts 20 and 28 take heed therefore unto yourselves and unto all the flock over which the Holy Ghost ha made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood ain't that right see Hebrews 13:12 wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood amen suffered without the gate Revelations 1:5 and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful Witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us amen from our sins in his own blood he's not loosening that except what he has done for us amen that's right you were pardoned at Calvary Amen brother Bram said every person in the world was forgiven of their sins when Jesus died at Calvary but never do you any good un L you accept it now I know that's the that's the hard thing is to accept it cuz we look at our failures we look how unworthy we are we look at our insufficiencies and we look at everything about us and we think well how in the world could he love us how how can I accept accept something when I know I'm guilty ain't that right but it says the blood of Calvary the work of calvary will not do you any good unless you accept it he said he's the Lamb of God that take away the sin of the world it is finished he said it at Calvary he was wounded past tense wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquity and chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were healed it's already done can you say it it's already done it's already done and in the sight of God it's all over amen so now we just accept the dividends when we accept his pardon can you sayen remember a pardon is not a pardon unless received as a pardon so then as long as we look back to what we was as long as we look to ourselves and our failures and our mistakes and our our insufficiencies and if we look to us then the sacrifice of Calvary means nothing hello if if Christianity is based upon what we do then the works of Calvary was meant nothing oh my that's why we can't look to us that's why we can't look to ourselves amen the prophet said don't look at yourself look at your lamb can you say Amen don't look at yourself look at your lamb God doesn't accept you but he accepts your lamb he accepts the lamb he accepts your sacrifice and the thing is there was no sacrifice good enough to make us into reconciliation to God so God had to be our sacrifice can you say Amen it's the only way that we could be redeemed is he made a sacrifice and if God looks at at our sacrifice or looks at that sacrifice and says that's good enough then we must look at that sacrifice and say it's good enough if it's good enough to God it's got to be good enough for us can you say amen and if our healing comes from that sacrifice and God heals us based upon that sacrifice then we must accept our healing based upon that sacrifice we base our accept our Salvation based upon that sacrifice God accepts our repentance and God accepts that amen based upon the sacrifice and we must base his grace or accept his grace based upon the sacrifice you have to believe that your sacrifice is good enough God came up with a sacrifice that was good enough for him he became the sacrifice amen and it must be good enough for us it is finished aren't you glad for that can you just lift your hands unto the Lord and thank him that's why we have a hope that's why we have a bright future that's why we're not down in the dumps that's why we can come to church and worship him and love him and express our love he expressed our his Love To Us by bringing a sacrifice and it is finished Lord hallelujah hallelujah amen you see brother Braham said the world may say oh you're a bunch of Holy Rollers you're not this and you've done this and he said but I don't care what you done by Grace by God's Promise by the Holy Ghost not what you are it's what your sacrifice is don't look at your Sac uh yourself look at your sacrifice for God don't look at you think of it now God had to have something to look to to stay his wrath if he looked at us through all of our blunders and all of that how can a holy God put up with an Unholy people how how how through all our ups and downs and our backslidings and everything that we go through how can God look at us amen and and not judge us so he presents he brought forth a sacrifice that he can look at don't look at youself look at your sacrifice God don't look at you he looks at your sacrifice which is Christ can you say amen amen don't look at yourself I'm not worthy you're not worthy nobody's worthy but he's the one that's worthy I'm not counting on what I've done and what I am he said I'd never make it but I'm looking to what he done and there's where I'm trusting what he done He's My Sacrifice I'm not worthy of healing no sir Lord ought to have died long long ago see ought to have never been born but I live because I've got eternal life I'm going to heaven why because he done it for me he was the one he took my place he said I was a knock kned crosseyed in every kind of a condition but he took my place spiritually speaking see I was all twisted up all messed up but he took my place so he makes me a perfect Son of God a and a perfect daughter of God that's what we are amen not when we get to heaven we are now sons of God perfect sons of God Daughters of God can you say amen and what done it he has sacrificed in it it's finished amen if musicians will come so he says I don't trust in what I done we don't trust in what we do right we can be good singers we can be good preachers we can be good musicians we can go to church Faithfully we can do it all but don't trust in that amen I trust in the sacrifice amen for only by the sacrifice can it be finished and the sacrifice says it is finished I don't have to worry about it no more now I can rest in the works of Calvary and my future is bright can you say Amen do you love the Lord therefore we're under expectation to go into Rapture which is soon amen not going through the tribulation tribulation is the wrath of God being poured out to people who refuse the sacrifice that oh my his blood cleansed us it's made us perfect in the sight of God I may not be perfect in your eyes and you may not be perfect in mine eyes but that don't matter as long as we're perfect in God's eyes amen and the only way we could do that is he looks at the sacrifice God bless you is our prayer what song hallelujah it's already done praise the Lord the Battle Is Over Victory is won it's already done oh yes sing it again oh it's already done hallelujah it's already done

remember the days when I was bent low with the burden of sin and strife then Jesus came in and he rescued me and he gave me a brand new life then now as I thank him day after day for washing my sins all away it seems I can almost hear the voice of the blessed savior say oh what sins are you talking about I don't remember them anymore from The Book of Life they've all been torn out I don't remember them anymore now when my faith becomes weak it's then I can speak to the Savior who's with me each day I say father forgive me hear my plea and he washes my sin away each time that I bow to give him thanks for removing my guilt and shame he cannot recall what I'm talking about for his answer is always the same oh what think of that his own blood is powerful enough not to remember your
