[37:17] your Bibles we're going to turn to the
[37:19] Book of Romans the 12th chapter
[37:23] a man
[37:32] Romans thee
[37:35] the 12th chapter
[37:41] and before we go into the word may we
[37:44] just bow our heads and
[37:46] just talk to our lord for we certainly
[37:48] need him don't we
[37:50] precious Lord
[37:53] we come humbly before you
[37:56] as your children
[37:59] father we realize more and more without
[38:02] you we can do nothing
[38:04] we need you to hold our hand
[38:07] as we walk through this Dark World
[38:11] we need you to use our lips Lord to
[38:15] speak Lord to others
[38:17] father we need you to take our eyes that
[38:19] you can see through and
[38:21] our ears Lord you need to take our whole
[38:24] being
[38:26] father and have complete control
[38:30] and father we're just asking now Lord
[38:33] that you would come Among Us and
[38:36] meet every need Lord that is present
[38:40] father whether there be discouragement
[38:42] whether there be sickness or whatever it
[38:45] would be father you alone know how to
[38:47] meet them
[38:48] and I pray that you had helped us just
[38:50] to yield ourselves to you father and may
[38:54] you have the preeminence
[38:56] Lord we give this part of the service to
[38:58] you
[38:59] in Jesus Christ's name
[39:01] amen
[39:04] the uh Romans the 12th chapter
[39:09] and we're going to read one and two
[39:11] verses here but it says I beseech you
[39:14] Brethren by the mercies of God that you
[39:17] present your body
[39:19] a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto
[39:24] God which is your reasonable service
[39:27] and be not conformed everybody say be
[39:30] not conformed
[39:31] to this world to be transformed by the
[39:34] renewing of your mind
[39:37] that you may prove what is that good and
[39:41] acceptable and perfect will of God
[39:45] amen you can have your seats this
[39:48] evening
[39:51] and again I want to just speak on the
[39:54] subject
[39:55] of choosing the the perfect will of God
[40:00] and we have I guess talked on this
[40:04] subject for a couple Wednesdays or so
[40:07] and um
[40:09] but this opening scripture here Paul
[40:12] tells us not to be conformed
[40:15] to the world
[40:17] but be transformed and um
[40:21] this this word conformed uh it means to
[40:26] be similar or exactly alike
[40:31] um to give the shape same shape outline
[40:34] Contour to
[40:36] bring in to Harmony or Accord
[40:40] so basically Paul is saying that we are
[40:43] not to be like the world act like the
[40:46] world live like the world
[40:48] think like the world talk like the world
[40:52] and we are not to be in agreement
[40:55] or in harmony with the world
[41:00] so in a nutshell we are to be different
[41:05] and there's a reason that we should be
[41:07] different not and not try to be
[41:09] different it's not trying because uh
[41:12] there's a lot of people that are trying
[41:14] to be different in so many ways
[41:18] um but uh so so naturally
[41:23] we were in agreement uh with the world
[41:27] the things of the world and that because
[41:29] of our human nature
[41:32] but we we are learning that the world is
[41:37] not in accordance with the word of God
[41:40] it's not in accordance with the perfect
[41:43] will of God the things of the world is
[41:46] not is not in accordance with the
[41:49] perfect will of God
[41:51] and I'm going to take my time and just
[41:54] talk to you for a few moments but I pray
[41:57] that the Lord will help us but we we
[41:59] talked about it you you know the message
[42:01] brother Branham tells us that God has a
[42:04] permissive will and a perfect will
[42:08] and and uh his his permissive will is
[42:13] what he permits to happen
[42:15] uh and and so the world the things of
[42:20] the world is what God permitted to be
[42:24] permitted to happen but but we find that
[42:28] the scriptures tells us that the world
[42:31] and the things of the world are going to
[42:33] pass away
[42:35] uh there and
[42:37] um but because it's something that God
[42:41] would permit to be but then his perfect
[42:44] will is what remains and his perfect
[42:49] will uh is what his thoughts are that's
[42:52] that's that because his thoughts are
[42:55] Eternal thoughts and and so it it comes
[42:59] from that which is eternal and and
[43:02] before sin came into the world we can we
[43:06] can get an idea of what the perfect will
[43:09] of God uh uh is uh just in the creation
[43:15] uh of God making man he made Man In His
[43:20] Image which made him a Son of God God
[43:24] gave this man dominion and making him a
[43:29] god of the Earth
[43:30] uh
[43:32] man also walked in harmony with God
[43:36] and he fellowshipped with God he walked
[43:40] in agreement with God he lived by the
[43:43] word of God which we would call
[43:46] revelation
[43:47] and so he he he didn't walk ignorantly
[43:52] in ignorance according to what God had
[43:55] in store for him but that's that's how
[43:58] he would exercise his domain and
[44:01] Authority is because he knew what God
[44:04] had given him to be and so he had an
[44:08] understanding as to what the will of God
[44:12] was for him uh and and and so uh this of
[44:17] course I believe uh was a picture of
[44:21] God's perfect will for for man and at
[44:25] that point in time man did not know what
[44:28] it was to be tempted he didn't know what
[44:31] it meant to be sick or to be discouraged
[44:34] or uh he didn't know what it was like to
[44:38] to Bear scars from uh of the past
[44:42] failures and mistakes and he didn't know
[44:45] what it was like to have the Mind
[44:46] battles and and go through the the
[44:49] things that you and I go through uh but
[44:53] but he lived in a a a a a a a place of
[44:57] perfection and he never knew the
[45:00] conditions as we know it today because
[45:03] he hadn't yet fallen from his position
[45:07] he ain't that right so God permitted uh
[45:11] permitted men to fall and to become a
[45:15] sinner and the prophet said when he
[45:18] failed uh he felt that that Holy image
[45:22] of God left him and his channels got
[45:27] clogged and he took on a sinful nature
[45:30] and and and man was made head to be the
[45:34] head over all creation and but his
[45:38] Fallen Nature has actually caused him to
[45:41] become lower than an animal uh in his
[45:45] his morals and brother Branham said you
[45:49] take the Holy Spirit off of The Man He's
[45:52] lower than the animal he's worse than
[45:54] the animal he said that's a hard thing
[45:56] to say but you take a man that's
[45:58] unregenerated in his mind without the
[46:01] Holy Spirit to direct his thoughts and
[46:04] things like that he would throw a baby
[46:06] out of a mother's arm arms and ravisher
[46:08] for beastly lust and so that's and and
[46:12] we're understanding today through
[46:15] through men's actions and just how low
[46:18] man can go uh in his Fallen nature and
[46:24] yet it was something that God would
[46:26] permit it had to happen as we know so
[46:30] that God could express who he himself
[46:34] truly is a man God Is A Healer God is a
[46:39] savior God is a redeemer deliverer a
[46:42] restorer but we wouldn't know these
[46:45] things had not God permitted man to fall
[46:48] and and allow such a thing but it also
[46:53] shows that he is a faithful God how many
[46:56] knows God to be faithful a man he's a
[46:59] faithful God and he is a faithful high
[47:03] priest amen but yet he couldn't Express
[47:06] what he is if he didn't permit man to
[47:10] fall now we talked about the names that
[47:14] are written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[47:16] they are God's Eternal thoughts from the
[47:20] foundation of the world and what God has
[47:24] predestinated them to be and what he has
[47:27] predestinated them for is the perfect
[47:31] will of God ain't that right a man and
[47:36] and so we didn't of course as we said
[47:38] many times we didn't come into this
[47:40] world uh uh according to God's perfect
[47:43] will we didn't come reflecting uh the
[47:48] perfect will of God uh we we came by
[47:52] God's permissive will amen what God had
[47:56] permitted uh therefore we were born as
[48:00] sons of Adam and not sons of God and and
[48:05] we come reflecting the adamic nature and
[48:09] not the nature of God and and so our
[48:12] natural birth makes us part of the the
[48:16] Fallen race and again God permitted it
[48:20] to happen that way but but again what
[48:25] God has permitted uh uh has to give way
[48:29] to that which is perfect amen what God
[48:34] uh uh uh God's permissive will gives way
[48:38] to his perfect will and and this is
[48:42] where uh we stand in in uh the age that
[48:48] we're in now Hebrews 12 26 now he hath
[48:53] promised saying yet once more I shake
[48:56] not the Earth only but also the heaven
[48:59] and this word yet once more signifies
[49:03] the remove moving of those things that
[49:05] are not or that are shaken as the things
[49:09] that are made that those things which
[49:11] cannot be shaken May remain ain't that
[49:14] right wherefore we receiving a kingdom
[49:19] which cannot be moved let us have Grace
[49:23] whereby we may serve God
[49:26] acceptably with reverence and godly fear
[49:30] ain't that right so we're we're living
[49:33] in an age where where things that uh
[49:37] there's things that just can't keep
[49:39] going on Amen the the we're we're we're
[49:43] at what the Bible calls were at the ends
[49:46] of the Earth amen politics can't keep
[49:50] going on the nations of this world can't
[49:53] keep going on uh denominations can't
[49:57] keep going on and and and what I and and
[50:01] that's fine with me because as long as
[50:04] they're continuing God's perfect will
[50:08] can't be accomplished
[50:10] ain't that right amen but but they give
[50:14] way to God's perfect will but this is is
[50:18] wonderful to me because
[50:20] that which is God permitted in your life
[50:23] is only temporary and it has to give way
[50:28] to God's perfect will
[50:30] a man see so uh God will never allow
[50:35] what he has permitted to affect or
[50:39] disenol uh his perfect will do you
[50:43] believe that amen now Romans 8 18 for I
[50:47] reckon that the sufferings of this
[50:49] present time are not worthy to be
[50:52] compared with the glory which shall be
[50:54] revealed in US ain't that right A man
[50:57] sufferings is something that God
[50:59] permitted but it's temporary but it has
[51:02] something it's working something within
[51:04] us for the earnest expectation of the
[51:09] creature waders everybody say wait is
[51:11] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[51:16] ain't that right living in a world of
[51:19] corruption living in the world of Fallen
[51:22] nature living in a world of evil but yet
[51:25] we know that there is a perfect wheel
[51:28] that will prevail and and we see what
[51:32] that is it's the manifestation of the
[51:35] sons of God
[51:37] do you believe that amen and for the
[51:40] creature was made subject now notice
[51:43] that the creature you and I a man was
[51:45] made subject to vanity not willingly but
[51:49] by reason of him who has subjected you
[51:55] and I the see the same in hope so he had
[52:00] a reason for subjecting us to vanity but
[52:03] he didn't just stop there he subjected
[52:06] Us in Hope
[52:09] because the creature itself also shall
[52:11] be delivered from the bondage of
[52:13] corruption into what the Glorious
[52:16] Liberty of the children of God
[52:18] change has got to take place
[52:21] change everything about you a man
[52:23] concerning your natural birth has got to
[52:26] change it's it's got to take place in
[52:29] order that the perfect will may be
[52:32] accomplished
[52:34] a man from The Bondage of corruption the
[52:37] creature itself shall be delivered from
[52:40] the bondage of corruption into the
[52:41] Glorious Liberty of the children of God
[52:44] for we know that the whole creation
[52:48] growneth and travaileth in pain together
[52:51] until now and not only they but
[52:54] ourselves
[52:56] something within us is groaning it's
[52:59] been that way before well I guess since
[53:02] the fall groaning to get back into the
[53:06] place where man fell from ourselves also
[53:10] which have the first fruits of the
[53:12] spirit even we ourselves grown within
[53:15] ourselves waiting for the adoption to
[53:18] wit the Redemption of our body God may
[53:22] have saved us but you're still groaning
[53:24] amen God may have filled you with the
[53:26] Holy Ghost but you're still groaning
[53:28] amen there's something that just won't
[53:31] let you brother Bob I see you now good
[53:33] to have you back amen but there's
[53:35] something that is that that just won't
[53:37] let you be satisfied with just coming to
[53:39] church amen what God did for us
[53:42] yesterday is fine but that doesn't stop
[53:44] the groaning that is within us you see
[53:48] every individual who has had their name
[53:50] in the Lamb's Book of Life was not only
[53:53] subject to vanity but also subject to
[53:56] whole hope and so all those individuals
[53:59] are groaning amen within to be restored
[54:05] to the perfect will of God can you say
[54:08] man I'm so glad that God it wasn't just
[54:12] in God for me to be a sinner but it was
[54:16] more in God for me to be a saint can you
[54:20] say amen amen to be a saint it means
[54:24] more than being an American it means
[54:25] more than just uh whatever it's it's
[54:29] we're children of God and so there's
[54:32] something that is causing us to groan
[54:34] grown we're groaning a man to be back in
[54:38] the perfect will of God brother Graham
[54:41] said our Spirits grown for that
[54:42] Deliverance another place said it
[54:45] doesn't yet appear what we shall be like
[54:46] but we know everybody say we know we
[54:50] will have a body like he is for we shall
[54:54] seek him as he is and now in our body
[54:57] now we groan for that day how many's
[55:00] groaning amen we groaning see that we
[55:04] didn't understand why we're groaning but
[55:06] now the word is being opened up and the
[55:09] promises have been made clear and we
[55:11] understand why we're groaning can be
[55:14] perfect in this world or can't be
[55:16] satisfied we can't be
[55:18] no matter what it is if if a man can
[55:21] just be satisfied with money he needs
[55:23] something within him to groan beyond
[55:25] that
[55:26] a man pushing beyond that can you say
[55:28] Amen some people just live for
[55:30] retirement but we're groaning for
[55:32] something greater than retirement ain't
[55:34] that right some people just look for for
[55:37] positions and and their name in The
[55:39] Highlight by the Believers groaning for
[55:41] something greater than that all in this
[55:44] world is going to vanish it's going to
[55:45] fade away a man but there's something
[55:48] within that believer that is groaning
[55:50] because he was there in the perfect
[55:52] thoughts of God can you say man and them
[55:56] thoughts have not been manifested you
[55:58] say well I was born on a certain day in
[56:00] a certain year but that wasn't the
[56:02] thought of God or why would you need to
[56:05] be born again why would you need to come
[56:07] into maturity can you say man them
[56:10] thoughts of God are now becoming a
[56:13] manifestation it's been a process
[56:17] and Dad couldn't do it mom couldn't do
[56:19] it the preacher couldn't do it it had to
[56:21] take God and it had to take that new
[56:23] birth
[56:24] can you say man and then bring you on up
[56:27] into maturity growth into an adoption
[56:32] now see so now uh uh he says that our
[56:37] bodies now we've grown for that day all
[56:39] Earth is groaning for that day
[56:41] another place what a beautiful
[56:43] Fellowship it must have been when God
[56:45] called his children in the cool of the
[56:48] evening and communed with him then
[56:50] kissing them as it were on the cheeks
[56:53] and laying them down to sleep for a
[56:55] night's rest and the wild beast of the
[56:58] field he bent it down without any
[57:00] disturbance any harm no harm was there
[57:02] no death no sickness no trouble and to
[57:05] awake on a new day to walk in the
[57:08] presence of their creator without fear
[57:10] without sickness and then what he says
[57:13] notice what he says oh God our Spirits
[57:16] grown for that time again for that's
[57:19] what we were made for
[57:21] I hate that rap I'm still in my daughter
[57:24] today you know the tears that we may
[57:27] shed amen there we we got keep looking
[57:30] ahead because there's going to come a
[57:32] time amen that that that our King will
[57:36] come and he will wipe all tears from our
[57:39] eyes amen and everything here will be
[57:42] just gone it'll be and and and we don't
[57:45] know nothing a man of all of this world
[57:47] and all of this filth and all of this
[57:50] the things that we go through a man will
[57:53] never be will never shed tear again why
[57:56] we're coming to God's perfect will
[58:00] nature is groaning we're groaning
[58:03] brother Brown said everything is
[58:04] groaning because we realize something's
[58:07] not right
[58:08] something's not right
[58:11] you believe that something's not right
[58:14] we we thought it would you know people
[58:16] think well something not right so they
[58:18] go change one woman to the next
[58:21] find out still not right
[58:25] it'll go change from one Church to
[58:26] another church and find out it's
[58:28] something not right
[58:29] see they they they they they're missing
[58:31] something and they don't know what
[58:32] they're missing they keep searching they
[58:35] keep looking they keep finding well the
[58:37] Bible says they'll be ever learning
[58:38] never coming to the knowledge of Truth
[58:40] ain't that right there'll be Roman to
[58:43] and fro trying to find something find
[58:45] the answer but they'll never find it but
[58:47] you and I now we're finding what we're
[58:50] groaning about that's why we can stay
[58:52] firm in the trials that's why we can
[58:54] stay firm amen where we're at and
[58:56] unmovable unshaken because we there is
[58:59] nothing in this world that can satisfy
[59:01] the groaning we just endure we just keep
[59:04] pressing we keep pushing Amen to the
[59:07] goal amen because it's only he that can
[59:10] satisfy the groaning and the groaning
[59:12] ain't gonna stop until this Mortal body
[59:14] takes on incorruption and we're changed
[59:18] and this world is Chained amen democracy
[59:21] has changed politics has changed the
[59:23] civilization has changed everything the
[59:26] kingdoms of this world is gone amen and
[59:29] we enter into a place of no more trial
[59:32] no more suffering no more sorrow and no
[59:35] more loneliness No More Tears can you
[59:38] say Amen
[59:39] and we're groaning
[59:42] might have a good meeting but we're
[59:44] still groaning
[59:46] might have great experiences but we're
[59:48] still groaning
[59:50] can you say man
[59:52] now he says notice we realize there's
[59:54] something not right and the only way you
[59:56] can groan
[59:57] now notice that the only way you can
[59:59] groan and wait for it is because there
[1:00:02] has been New Life in here that has come
[1:00:06] that speaks of a new world
[1:00:08] can you say man amen there's something
[1:00:11] that keeps speaking of these promises
[1:00:14] speaking of a Rapture speaking of a body
[1:00:17] change I don't know how you know I mean
[1:00:20] you you can talk to a lot of people
[1:00:21] about those things and it doesn't do
[1:00:23] nothing but you take a believer that
[1:00:25] hears them things and he got something
[1:00:27] within them that just pushes them that
[1:00:30] won't let them be settled with just
[1:00:32] Christianity or religion
[1:00:35] groaning
[1:00:38] so this is not us resisting and God
[1:00:42] making us do his will
[1:00:45] for we are groaning
[1:00:48] aren't you glad you're groaning
[1:00:50] yeah
[1:00:52] and the groaning comes from the
[1:00:55] predestinated seed
[1:00:57] uh that is within us
[1:00:59] we groan for it because we're
[1:01:01] predestinated to it you're not
[1:01:04] predestinated you won't grow
[1:01:06] the money will be more lucrative
[1:01:09] than than the groaning
[1:01:11] then what the believer's really groaning
[1:01:13] for
[1:01:14] amen uh the things of this world will be
[1:01:17] more satisfactory
[1:01:22] the world don't understand why we go
[1:01:24] through our trials
[1:01:25] the world don't even understand why we
[1:01:27] deny the things of this world
[1:01:29] they they don't understand why we ain't
[1:01:31] got an appetite for it there's something
[1:01:33] in us that is causing us to grow
[1:01:37] grow
[1:01:39] we're predestinated for it and so
[1:01:42] something in US is calling for the
[1:01:44] perfect will of God to be done
[1:01:47] now there are only two bodies the
[1:01:49] prophet said two groups in this world
[1:01:53] one body is intellectual
[1:01:55] and is made up of Science and education
[1:01:58] and we would call that body denomination
[1:02:02] it's wrapping up into the World Council
[1:02:04] of churches
[1:02:06] and and actually all denominations will
[1:02:08] make is making up the World Council of
[1:02:10] churches
[1:02:11] and and and people are entering into
[1:02:14] that more rapidly by the moment
[1:02:17] and and it's it's it's it's like a the
[1:02:20] dam that has been opened and the water's
[1:02:22] rushing amen well that's that's where
[1:02:25] it's coming to we're living in that age
[1:02:28] and and so uh uh and but a man belongs
[1:02:33] to this body by joining it and and and
[1:02:36] and and yet it's this body will be
[1:02:39] utterly destroyed and that we already
[1:02:41] know the end and and it'll be destroyed
[1:02:44] but the other body is the body of the
[1:02:47] Lord Jesus Christ and you you belong to
[1:02:50] this body not by joining but by being
[1:02:53] born into it
[1:02:55] which makes you a a greater part than to
[1:02:59] join it you are more real of in this
[1:03:02] body than they are in their that body
[1:03:04] because they've joined this in in that
[1:03:07] one you're born into this
[1:03:09] ain't that right and this body is a
[1:03:13] Spirit-filled word body it's a word body
[1:03:17] a body made up by the perfect will of
[1:03:21] God
[1:03:22] do you believe that the perfect will of
[1:03:25] God it is spotless without a blemish nor
[1:03:28] a wrinkle a man see and so by again by
[1:03:33] the new birth you're part of this body
[1:03:35] and and the prophet would say you have
[1:03:37] to be part of it you you you can't be
[1:03:41] burned born into the body and then say
[1:03:43] well I ain't got no part to do with that
[1:03:46] nothing nah and then you sit on the
[1:03:48] sidelines and and you're living it easy
[1:03:50] and you know kind of like in the Bahamas
[1:03:53] you know under the the shade tree
[1:03:55] sipping lemonade and and whatever you
[1:03:59] know and and while your comrades
[1:04:01] supposably are fighting the battle and
[1:04:03] they're they're they're just into it and
[1:04:06] and they're they're weary but yet they
[1:04:07] keep pressing and you're over there
[1:04:10] ah
[1:04:11] I'm part of you guys you know no no you
[1:04:14] that's not being part of anything ain't
[1:04:16] that right so you you got to be part of
[1:04:19] it now notice what brother Brown said
[1:04:21] could I deny I got an arm
[1:04:23] Ryan see no more than I could deny any
[1:04:26] of God's word see if I'm part of God I'm
[1:04:29] part of William Branham see I'm in parts
[1:04:32] so you're in parts right
[1:04:35] see every part is a part of me and every
[1:04:39] word of God has to fit my spirit fit my
[1:04:43] soul fit my living it has to fit my
[1:04:47] ideas if my ideas is contrary to that
[1:04:50] then God's spirit don't dwell in me it
[1:04:53] cannot deny one word of it if if if
[1:04:57] you're saying this is my body if I'm
[1:05:00] saying this of my body but this ain't my
[1:05:02] arm
[1:05:04] well how can that be
[1:05:07] it's it's part of my body it's attached
[1:05:10] to my body
[1:05:12] it came with me when I was born
[1:05:16] can you say man well if you were birthed
[1:05:19] into this body you cannot deny this
[1:05:22] because this body is a word body
[1:05:25] ain't that right and God's perfect will
[1:05:28] will be done in his body
[1:05:33] in his body
[1:05:34] the whole body is groaning
[1:05:37] the whole body is yearning Paul was
[1:05:40] groaning Isaiah was groaning all of them
[1:05:44] was groaning amen Peter groaning all all
[1:05:48] the Old Testament New Testament saints
[1:05:50] were groaning and then we stopped in
[1:05:53] this day and don't groan in the finale
[1:05:55] of this thing I don't think so we're
[1:05:58] part of the body that they're part of
[1:06:01] [Applause]
[1:06:04] again Jesus tells us that we are to pray
[1:06:08] give us this day our daily bread
[1:06:10] the word of God for this age
[1:06:13] give it to us
[1:06:15] thy kingdom come thy will
[1:06:19] be done
[1:06:20] but notice thy perfect will
[1:06:24] thy perfect will be done in earth
[1:06:28] not just throughout the Earth
[1:06:31] but there's vessels
[1:06:34] there's Earthen vessels
[1:06:36] ain't that right
[1:06:38] that's a will of God will be completed
[1:06:40] in
[1:06:42] I believe I'm speaking to Earth and
[1:06:44] vessels tonight
[1:06:47] thy perfect will be done in earth as it
[1:06:50] is in heaven in other words what you're
[1:06:52] saying is is God thy perfect will be
[1:06:54] done in me
[1:06:56] bring it to personal
[1:06:58] let it be done in me
[1:07:00] and we've been told don't don't pray for
[1:07:02] government
[1:07:03] don't pray for America don't don't pray
[1:07:05] for it it that's going
[1:07:08] it's a it's a ship that's about sunk
[1:07:12] I mean it probably is sunken you've just
[1:07:14] seen little bubbles
[1:07:16] but it's it's gone it's over there
[1:07:18] there's no hope
[1:07:20] but the perfect will of God is going to
[1:07:22] be done in not in government
[1:07:25] but it's going to be done in a group of
[1:07:27] people
[1:07:28] can you say man those that are praying
[1:07:31] for this to be done
[1:07:33] ain't that right remember we're not just
[1:07:35] praying for the will of God to be done
[1:07:37] but we're asking him give us this day
[1:07:39] our daily bread
[1:07:41] I hope it makes sense to you that Daily
[1:07:44] Bread is his perfect will made known to
[1:07:48] you and I for this age
[1:07:51] God's allotted his word to every age but
[1:07:54] there is a people in that age that is
[1:07:56] predestinated to know that word and to
[1:07:59] make that word live
[1:08:01] God's perfect will
[1:08:04] now the prophet said now that we have
[1:08:06] been saved as we are
[1:08:08] and that we have been filled with the
[1:08:10] Holy Spirit as we have now now we want
[1:08:14] the mind that was in Christ to be in US
[1:08:17] say that again we have been saved as we
[1:08:20] are and we've been filled with the Holy
[1:08:22] Spirit as we have now everybody say now
[1:08:27] now we want the mind that was in Christ
[1:08:30] to be in us that we might be transformed
[1:08:33] from the Natural Things of Life get your
[1:08:37] mind off the natural things get your
[1:08:40] head out of all of that be transformed
[1:08:44] can you say amen and brought in to do
[1:08:48] the perfect will of God by
[1:08:51] transformation of God's spirit by his
[1:08:54] word
[1:08:56] people don't I I'll say it right fast
[1:08:59] but people just do not regard God's word
[1:09:01] anymore
[1:09:01] they put their jobs over work over the
[1:09:04] word sleep over the word
[1:09:07] they don't even give time anymore for
[1:09:09] God to move after Services you gotta go
[1:09:11] they got to go to work they got to get
[1:09:13] some sleep
[1:09:14] you know what I'm saying if everybody
[1:09:16] was like them where how would God move
[1:09:20] come on now
[1:09:22] amen give the word preeminence
[1:09:26] give the word preemness the god that
[1:09:28] gave you that job surely can keep you
[1:09:31] the god that blessed you with the
[1:09:32] material things surely we can give him a
[1:09:35] little honor
[1:09:36] and let him move what good is your
[1:09:40] ministry without him what good is our
[1:09:42] life without him what good is this
[1:09:44] service without him
[1:09:48] ain't that right see you've got to be
[1:09:50] transformed from the Natural Things of
[1:09:52] life and be brought in to do the perfect
[1:09:54] will of God by transformation of God's
[1:09:58] spirit by his word
[1:10:02] now notice Genesis 1 1 in the beginning
[1:10:05] God created the Heaven and the Earth and
[1:10:08] the Earth was without form and void and
[1:10:10] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[1:10:12] now notice brother Branham described the
[1:10:15] condition as being a darkness of Chaos
[1:10:18] is just chaotic and the word chaos is a
[1:10:22] state of utter confusion it's just it
[1:10:25] was just so much confusion there was no
[1:10:27] organization it was just darkness it was
[1:10:29] it was it was a mess brother Branham
[1:10:32] said it this way the churning of the
[1:10:34] water and that wandering star twisted
[1:10:36] around and around the orbits out there
[1:10:39] somewhere it must have been a terrific
[1:10:41] mass of something lost like it was and
[1:10:44] couldn't find its way back ain't that
[1:10:47] right so see it was just a massive
[1:10:49] confusion and and and everything was in
[1:10:52] disarray or the Earth was in disarray
[1:10:55] and and all of these things uh uh uh as
[1:10:59] as the Bible says so and then notice
[1:11:02] what he says this is what we become when
[1:11:05] we become wondering Stars just without
[1:11:08] hope without God just turning around out
[1:11:11] in darkness not knowing where we're
[1:11:13] going that's that's the majority of
[1:11:16] people today not not just in the in the
[1:11:20] bars and The Honky Tonks and the
[1:11:22] prostitutions and all of that in the
[1:11:24] church
[1:11:27] in religion
[1:11:29] just wandering Stars not knowing where
[1:11:33] they're going
[1:11:34] it's a massive confusion
[1:11:39] ain't that right
[1:11:40] but then we read that the spirit of God
[1:11:43] moved upon the face of the deep the face
[1:11:46] of the waters and God took that great
[1:11:49] chaos of darkness and transformed it
[1:11:52] into a Garden of Eden by his word ain't
[1:11:57] that right and I say to you God's word
[1:11:59] is how we are transformed amen but
[1:12:03] notice it took not just the word it took
[1:12:06] the spirit of God to move amen and to
[1:12:09] make that word live ain't that right God
[1:12:12] said let there be life see let there be
[1:12:15] light the prophet said and that mass of
[1:12:18] creation out there come over in around
[1:12:20] the Sun and begin to revolve around the
[1:12:23] Sun and became a Garden of Eden because
[1:12:26] it obeyed the word of God it dumbed the
[1:12:29] perfect will of God for it was
[1:12:32] transformed from chaos into a Garden of
[1:12:35] Eden by the word of God can you say Amen
[1:12:38] so what we are doing is being
[1:12:41] transformed from a chaotic life Faith to
[1:12:44] the perfect will of God
[1:12:49] the perfect
[1:12:50] so as sons of daughters of God were
[1:12:54] groaning for the perfect will
[1:12:56] of God to be done
[1:12:59] but as I have said
[1:13:01] for a few Services now that we are free
[1:13:04] moral agents
[1:13:06] and
[1:13:08] um
[1:13:09] so what that means is we're not like the
[1:13:13] son that God says let there be light
[1:13:16] stay in your position
[1:13:18] and the light appears and it comes to
[1:13:21] its position
[1:13:23] Graham talks about that star it would
[1:13:25] fall and fall and fall and then it would
[1:13:27] hang there because God stopped it right
[1:13:29] there and he stopped it right there and
[1:13:31] he stopped it right there and if one of
[1:13:35] those Stars would get out of the
[1:13:36] position it would create utter chaos to
[1:13:40] this earth ain't that right
[1:13:41] but then we find that man got out of his
[1:13:44] position and look what it's called ain't
[1:13:46] that right see so we're we're not as one
[1:13:49] that God commands and then we just
[1:13:51] automatically do it
[1:13:53] kind of be nice
[1:13:54] but that's not the way it happens we are
[1:13:57] free moral agents to where we have to
[1:13:58] choose everybody say I've got to choose
[1:14:01] I got to choose the perfect will of God
[1:14:04] you've got to choose now God knew
[1:14:06] beforehand what choices we would make
[1:14:08] and he alone knows he is the only one
[1:14:10] that has the infinite in mind and
[1:14:12] knowledge but we
[1:14:15] we have to wrestle things out
[1:14:20] we have to wrestle things out we have to
[1:14:22] make our calling and election sure
[1:14:26] ain't that right
[1:14:27] we're not one that says well I got saved
[1:14:30] blessed God 19 years ago and then just
[1:14:32] go I don't have to worry about it no
[1:14:34] more no you got to make choices
[1:14:38] you got to make choices you you you've
[1:14:40] got to advance into the more perfect
[1:14:42] will of God
[1:14:45] ain't that right whatever you want to
[1:14:47] call it maturity growth
[1:14:49] building up
[1:14:53] the whatever it is you've got to rest
[1:14:55] you you you got to wrestle it out
[1:14:58] yes we enter into rest when we receive
[1:15:02] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:04] knowing knowing that we are a child of
[1:15:08] God and there's nothing
[1:15:11] everybody say there's nothing that Satan
[1:15:13] can do to us
[1:15:16] he he can't make us any different why
[1:15:19] we're sealed in
[1:15:20] sealed in Christ
[1:15:22] and Satan's sealed out
[1:15:24] ain't that right the Holy Ghost comes
[1:15:27] inside of us and God sets up his throne
[1:15:29] in our heart ain't that right and I'm so
[1:15:32] glad for that aren't you glad God set up
[1:15:34] his throne in your heart
[1:15:36] amen that's right he didn't just fall
[1:15:38] upon you he come to live in you
[1:15:42] but that doesn't mean that we it takes
[1:15:44] away our choices
[1:15:51] we have to make choices every day
[1:15:54] Satan can still tempt us
[1:15:57] he can entice us
[1:16:00] he is able to speak to us
[1:16:03] he's able to put thoughts in her mind
[1:16:06] can you say man
[1:16:08] we're made of three trifle being Body
[1:16:11] Spirit and soul
[1:16:13] he's able to affect our body
[1:16:15] by the five senses right he's able to
[1:16:18] affect our spirit by the five senses
[1:16:20] Holy Ghost filled people don't always
[1:16:22] get on the right side of get wake up on
[1:16:24] the right side of the bed
[1:16:26] I don't know go ahead Holy Ghost filled
[1:16:29] people don't always feel like uh uh
[1:16:32] having a good time and going to church
[1:16:33] and jumping for joy
[1:16:38] and you say man
[1:16:40] see he works he works on our outside man
[1:16:43] he works on the inside man but on the
[1:16:46] inside of that inside that's where God
[1:16:50] came to live
[1:16:53] is that right now notice the spirit of
[1:16:56] God in you manifests the life of Jesus
[1:16:59] just like the mainspring in in a watch
[1:17:02] that ticks and every part of it moves
[1:17:04] just exactly the right
[1:17:06] see it controls your emotions it
[1:17:08] controls your habits it controls your
[1:17:10] senses it controls your faith it's just
[1:17:12] the mainspring the the holy spirit in
[1:17:15] the middle of your heart controlling you
[1:17:18] and you say man
[1:17:20] see so it's a we now we we believe with
[1:17:24] a different kind of faith
[1:17:25] we love with a different kind of love we
[1:17:28] we have joy but it's a different type of
[1:17:31] joy we have peace but it's a different
[1:17:33] type of Peace it's because he set in our
[1:17:37] heart our soul ain't that right and his
[1:17:41] attributes now are flowing flowing
[1:17:43] through us
[1:17:44] ain't that right yes sir see so so it's
[1:17:48] not all human we're not just all human
[1:17:51] now Jesus was God and he was human human
[1:17:54] God ain't that right amen and what are
[1:17:58] you then if you're filled with truly
[1:18:00] filled and with the baptism of Holy
[1:18:02] Ghost you are human and you are God
[1:18:06] I know people don't like to hear that
[1:18:08] but that's true
[1:18:10] that's true how else are you going to
[1:18:11] overcome
[1:18:13] how else as a human being how else are
[1:18:15] you going to overcome as a human being
[1:18:17] how are you going to groan for the
[1:18:19] perfect will of God when it's not even
[1:18:21] in you to grow
[1:18:24] how are you going to groan for something
[1:18:26] that you never heard of
[1:18:28] this Earth is more real to the human
[1:18:30] being than in heaven is
[1:18:32] we see this all the time
[1:18:35] that's why the doctor's words can affect
[1:18:37] uh uh people more than the word of God
[1:18:40] can
[1:18:46] but the way we believe the what is in us
[1:18:48] there's something in us that is
[1:18:50] Supernatural it's another life and it's
[1:18:53] causing us to groan
[1:18:55] is causing us to yearn
[1:19:02] now we have to come to our Crossroads in
[1:19:04] life
[1:19:06] and young people bless your hearts
[1:19:08] that's where you're at
[1:19:10] we all go through them
[1:19:14] and
[1:19:17] I'm I'm 49 and
[1:19:21] we still go through Crossroads
[1:19:27] and you know sometimes I don't know I
[1:19:31] mean I I think as we mature
[1:19:34] we should be able better to handle it
[1:19:36] but
[1:19:38] in in these times but still in these
[1:19:41] times is really when Satan really works
[1:19:44] on us
[1:19:45] and and so you young people maybe you
[1:19:49] don't know about them struggles you
[1:19:51] don't understand why you're going
[1:19:52] through these struggles
[1:19:54] but I want to say this to you it's
[1:19:56] Crossroads
[1:19:58] it's Crossroads in your life
[1:20:00] and Crossroad is is well you could
[1:20:03] either call it a y or a split in the
[1:20:06] road or where you can either go straight
[1:20:08] turn left turn right it's Crossroads
[1:20:11] this nation came to Crossroads and and
[1:20:14] and they didn't stay on track
[1:20:17] and and and so but this is where the the
[1:20:20] the the the struggle happens now I I
[1:20:24] will tell you most people most of your
[1:20:26] friends most the people you work with uh
[1:20:30] go to school with whatever they don't
[1:20:32] care about the will of God
[1:20:34] they're they're they're satisfied with
[1:20:36] church they're satisfied with the easy
[1:20:38] path they they go to church but they got
[1:20:41] more more of this world on their minds
[1:20:43] and they don't understand about
[1:20:45] decisions and why you're so uh uh why
[1:20:48] it's an necessary to you to make right
[1:20:53] choices
[1:20:54] can you say man so see so they don't
[1:20:58] care about God's will they have this
[1:21:00] idea that God is going to have to accept
[1:21:02] them the way that they are after all he
[1:21:05] made me the way I am so therefore he's
[1:21:06] got to accept it that's a lie
[1:21:09] for there is a power of transformation
[1:21:13] [Music]
[1:21:16] if you're just a Baptist or a
[1:21:17] Pentecostal or just some nominal church
[1:21:19] member I can understand why you don't
[1:21:21] want to go there
[1:21:23] why you don't want the perfect will of
[1:21:25] God to be done because there's nothing
[1:21:27] there to help you
[1:21:29] but we all come out of something
[1:21:32] and we come out of it because something
[1:21:34] led us here
[1:21:36] not for us to just stop believing and
[1:21:40] not just for us to stop groaning
[1:21:43] but to keep groaning
[1:21:45] because we understand there's a power
[1:21:47] transformation
[1:21:49] to changes from one thing to another
[1:21:54] the people don't want to wrestle it out
[1:21:58] and and I'll be honest we don't like
[1:21:59] trials but God brings them to you
[1:22:03] now if we all think if we all had a
[1:22:05] choice in that matter if we all had a
[1:22:07] choice we'd say Lord easy please easy
[1:22:11] but God in his wisdom says no that's not
[1:22:13] that's not the way it's going to go
[1:22:15] because God looks for character
[1:22:18] and we're going to get into it later but
[1:22:20] God looks for character
[1:22:22] and that's the only thing that you're
[1:22:23] going to take with you is your character
[1:22:25] and characters not a a gift to you as as
[1:22:30] it is to be a musician that's a gift
[1:22:32] that come with you
[1:22:34] as it is to be a an electrician or
[1:22:37] whatever you've got abilities that you
[1:22:39] were born with them are gifts them are
[1:22:41] talent but character is not a gift
[1:22:44] it's a victory one
[1:22:52] amen now I want to say this
[1:22:56] you will not find the perfect will of
[1:22:58] God outside the word of God
[1:23:02] amen the perfect will of God is what God
[1:23:04] has revealed in his word
[1:23:06] so this brings it to a nutshell the
[1:23:09] message is the revealed word of God
[1:23:13] the message is the perfect will of God
[1:23:17] now if you're groaning if you're
[1:23:20] groaning for the will of God then that
[1:23:22] groaning brings you to the message
[1:23:26] and it doesn't matter who walks away
[1:23:29] so be it
[1:23:32] it led me here my groaning
[1:23:35] led me to the revealed word of God that
[1:23:40] tells me my future
[1:23:43] that helps me identify what this
[1:23:45] groaning is
[1:23:46] there is a new Heaven
[1:23:49] that's the new Earth
[1:23:51] it's a city
[1:23:55] siroucher can you say Amen
[1:23:58] and and this groaning did not lead me to
[1:24:01] some imagination that man has of a
[1:24:04] Rapture it led me to the revealed word
[1:24:08] it led me
[1:24:10] thus it is the perfect will of God to
[1:24:13] those I say it again the message of the
[1:24:17] hour is the perfect will of God to those
[1:24:19] whose names are written in the Lamb's
[1:24:21] Book of Life
[1:24:22] everybody else don't believe it
[1:24:24] everybody else will water it down
[1:24:25] everybody else wants to add something to
[1:24:27] it everybody else is not satisfied with
[1:24:29] it they got to mix their own ideas and
[1:24:31] this and that and this and try to prove
[1:24:33] what brother Brandon was wrong in this
[1:24:35] and brother wrong and it's just opinions
[1:24:37] and it's just this but to those who has
[1:24:40] their name written in the Lamb's Book of
[1:24:41] Life and are groaning from within that
[1:24:45] Soul amen this message is the answer
[1:24:50] they're satisfied
[1:24:55] because it is the perfect will of God to
[1:24:58] them
[1:24:59] that's why we as ministers cannot make
[1:25:02] the message anything than what it is
[1:25:04] brother Brandon said my message has been
[1:25:06] all along the word of God
[1:25:08] so as a message believer how else can we
[1:25:10] preach the word of God without the
[1:25:12] message
[1:25:13] the message is the word of God all along
[1:25:17] see in another place he says the only
[1:25:19] way that I can help you now notice he's
[1:25:22] he's a preacher and and I say to all of
[1:25:24] his preachers a man that the only way he
[1:25:28] says that I can help you is getting is
[1:25:30] by getting your faith centered on the
[1:25:32] will of God for you by the word of God
[1:25:36] can you say amen amen say that again the
[1:25:39] only way that that I as your pastor can
[1:25:42] help you in in this assembly amen the
[1:25:45] only way that I can help you is get your
[1:25:48] faith centered on the will of God for
[1:25:51] you by the word of God
[1:25:54] by the word of God can you say Amen what
[1:25:57] is it preach the message
[1:26:02] your parents how are you going to get
[1:26:04] your child focused on the word of God
[1:26:06] centered on the will of God
[1:26:08] preach the message teach the message
[1:26:11] get him in the message
[1:26:13] play the tapes we're talking about the
[1:26:16] pastor and just just just preach the
[1:26:18] message
[1:26:21] quit complaining about the church you go
[1:26:23] to and just preached a message
[1:26:27] can you say man
[1:26:30] well that knocks a lot out huh
[1:26:34] he brought us now notice by the message
[1:26:36] of the hour he brought us to the perfect
[1:26:39] word
[1:26:41] you believe it
[1:26:42] therefore brother Brown said we do have
[1:26:45] by God's help the perfect interpretation
[1:26:47] of the word with Divine vindication
[1:26:51] with Divine Vindication amen I tell my
[1:26:54] children I tell you I tell myself I tell
[1:26:56] anybody we don't just believe this
[1:26:58] message because we say it's right we
[1:27:01] believe it because God said it's right
[1:27:03] and it's the perfect interpretation by
[1:27:07] Divine vindication
[1:27:10] it's the perfect will of God made known
[1:27:13] to you and I
[1:27:15] do you believe it
[1:27:17] so preach the perfect word
[1:27:21] and it will get the face of God select
[1:27:23] centered on the perfect will of God for
[1:27:25] them man thank you Lord Abraham said we
[1:27:29] must hold to that regardless
[1:27:32] talking about the word
[1:27:34] we must hold to that regardless and now
[1:27:37] we know what the word is it's the
[1:27:38] message of the hour
[1:27:41] can y'all say Amen to that one y'all
[1:27:43] believe that the word for this age is
[1:27:45] the message of the hour so we must hold
[1:27:48] to that
[1:27:50] brim didn't preach nothing outside this
[1:27:52] Bible
[1:27:54] it's people got it all messed up
[1:27:58] they bring it all back into chaos
[1:28:01] but according to God's word it will
[1:28:03] never be chaotic to a believer
[1:28:06] because a Believer stays right with the
[1:28:07] message
[1:28:10] so always he says see we must hold to
[1:28:13] that regardless of what other things
[1:28:14] take place always stay with that word
[1:28:16] always check out your motives and
[1:28:19] objectives see if it is according to the
[1:28:22] word of God if it isn't leave it alone
[1:28:24] that's a perfect will of God right
[1:28:27] see but if it's with the word of God and
[1:28:30] lines up with the word of God then you
[1:28:32] hold to that
[1:28:33] ain't that right now Abraham focused his
[1:28:37] mind to the will of God by the word of
[1:28:39] God that's why the prophet said Abraham
[1:28:42] 25 years he he waited but he was
[1:28:45] faithful he stayed true to that word he
[1:28:47] professed that word he confessed that
[1:28:48] word and his faith grew stronger and
[1:28:50] stronger why he centered his mind
[1:28:53] focused his mind on the will of God by
[1:28:56] the word of God
[1:28:58] can't focus on the perfect will of God
[1:29:00] without the word
[1:29:03] now we want the will of God be done how
[1:29:05] many believes that how many wants the
[1:29:07] will of God to be done
[1:29:11] so again we believe that the the word of
[1:29:13] God revealed word of God is the perfect
[1:29:16] will of God
[1:29:18] but then
[1:29:19] but then our faith has to be tried
[1:29:24] to see if it will hold out
[1:29:27] the Bible says every Son of God must be
[1:29:29] tested and tried
[1:29:31] so this proves whether or not you're
[1:29:34] going by what somebody else has said
[1:29:37] or if you're going by a true revelation
[1:29:41] of God's word
[1:29:43] man the testings come
[1:29:46] The Trials come
[1:29:48] I think you could ask any Elder in this
[1:29:51] in this building tonight
[1:29:54] how many Elders have had trials
[1:29:57] raise your hand really high
[1:30:00] okay some Elders have but most Elders
[1:30:03] are yeah most most Elders have and some
[1:30:05] haven't
[1:30:07] but but but most Elders have had trials
[1:30:10] if you're a Christian if you're a
[1:30:12] Believer you have trials
[1:30:15] and we go through them
[1:30:17] now you young people you go through
[1:30:20] trials too
[1:30:21] you're not alone in them
[1:30:25] Elders can you say Amen to that
[1:30:28] you're not alone
[1:30:32] now these trials reveals
[1:30:36] you know brother Branham talks about how
[1:30:39] that when he talked about the pillar of
[1:30:41] Fire
[1:30:43] he he told people about the pillar fire
[1:30:46] they told him it was of the devil they
[1:30:48] told him to stay away from it
[1:30:49] they told him it was just nonsense and
[1:30:52] da da well he says he says they had me
[1:30:56] scared to where I wouldn't even preach
[1:30:58] it
[1:30:59] I wouldn't preach it
[1:31:00] he said but then God came and revealed
[1:31:03] it
[1:31:04] that it was Jesus Christ the same
[1:31:06] yesterday
[1:31:07] today and forever the same one that the
[1:31:10] Apostle Paul met on the road to Damascus
[1:31:13] then notice what he says oh then try to
[1:31:16] shake it out of me
[1:31:18] can't be done
[1:31:19] for it's the scripture see he was going
[1:31:22] by what man said what man said and so
[1:31:24] therefore if they put fear in him to
[1:31:26] where he'd just shut up he wouldn't talk
[1:31:28] about wouldn't preach about it but then
[1:31:29] when it become revealed he saw it in
[1:31:32] scripture as being the perfect will of
[1:31:35] God for this age
[1:31:37] and being of God it was God it wasn't an
[1:31:40] evil spirit it wasn't something a
[1:31:43] terrible he said see but when it came he
[1:31:46] said see it's scripture it's God's word
[1:31:49] it's not just an experience that's loose
[1:31:54] it's an experience that is backed up by
[1:31:58] God's word and God's Eternal Bliss
[1:32:00] promise
[1:32:04] see so you come down to it
[1:32:08] that what what you have experienced
[1:32:12] and most of you young people have been
[1:32:14] raised up in church all your life I
[1:32:17] guess raised in the message
[1:32:18] all your life and you've heard these
[1:32:21] things to be true
[1:32:22] but God God wants to bring it personally
[1:32:25] to you
[1:32:27] God wants it it's not that you didn't
[1:32:30] have the Holy Ghost it didn't mean that
[1:32:33] you're lost it doesn't mean nothing like
[1:32:35] that but God wants it down so down deep
[1:32:38] inside you that the world can't take it
[1:32:41] out of you
[1:32:44] and you say man this message has got to
[1:32:46] be a revelation to you
[1:32:49] to where no one can take it out no one
[1:32:51] can talk you out of it
[1:32:53] and when when Dad and Mom is long gone
[1:32:55] and if the Lord tarries and hell you're
[1:32:57] called to preach you ain't going to be
[1:32:59] like those preachers that that say well
[1:33:01] I believe the message and then the
[1:33:02] Trials come and you walk out
[1:33:04] you're going to be like those preachers
[1:33:06] that'll stand there come hell or high
[1:33:08] water and still Proclaim
[1:33:11] you'll be like these Elders that had
[1:33:14] gone through the fire
[1:33:16] and yet you'll see them just lifting
[1:33:18] their hands and worshiping the Lord and
[1:33:20] you
[1:33:21] and you're like how do they stand the
[1:33:23] same way God's going to make you stand
[1:33:26] through trials
[1:33:29] it's just true
[1:33:32] see your faith your faith has got to be
[1:33:34] tested and tried to see if it's real
[1:33:37] faith
[1:33:38] ain't that right listen there there's
[1:33:41] that that that group of the Hebrews the
[1:33:43] Israelites you know the Bible says there
[1:33:46] in Hebrews 15 through 16. it talks about
[1:33:49] that they heard the word of God they
[1:33:52] heard it they heard the message of the
[1:33:54] hour and and yet they provoke God
[1:33:58] now listen now you'll see we're choosing
[1:34:01] the will of God the perfect will of God
[1:34:03] God was trying to take him somewhere it
[1:34:06] wasn't his will a perfect will for them
[1:34:08] to be in Egypt he was trying to take him
[1:34:10] to a land amen that flow with milk and
[1:34:13] honey it was already given to them
[1:34:15] before they ever went into Egypt
[1:34:18] so they heard the word of God it was the
[1:34:20] Vindicated message of the hour
[1:34:22] but they provoked him
[1:34:25] why do they provoking griping
[1:34:28] complaining every time the trials cover
[1:34:32] I just thinking I don't know why
[1:34:36] I'm gonna be honest we pray probably all
[1:34:39] done at one time or another
[1:34:48] trials hurt
[1:34:51] testings ain't no fun
[1:34:56] I've caught myself even saying it why
[1:35:00] don't he know
[1:35:06] s
[1:35:15] and
[1:35:16] it's in them times we've got to Humble
[1:35:19] ourselves
[1:35:21] to where we say thy will be done
[1:35:24] but don't look for a bed of roses don't
[1:35:27] look for it easy
[1:35:30] is this all right
[1:35:32] they heard the will of God they rejoiced
[1:35:34] but when they came to trials and the
[1:35:36] testings they murmured and complained
[1:35:38] and notice what they've done instead of
[1:35:40] humbling themselves they hardened their
[1:35:42] hearts
[1:35:44] showing that they had unbelief they had
[1:35:46] an evil heart of unbelief for they
[1:35:48] hardened her hard against a trial
[1:35:50] instead of breaking them down and saying
[1:35:53] oh God forgive me oh God help me oh God
[1:35:57] just keep me in your grace
[1:36:00] I tell you what
[1:36:03] and the trials in their trials and their
[1:36:06] testings their heart got hardened
[1:36:07] because of an evil heart of unbelief
[1:36:10] ain't that right see so the trials that
[1:36:12] we go through will actually declare what
[1:36:15] is in US it'll it'll bring it out one
[1:36:18] way or another and because you cannot
[1:36:21] you you may be able to make belief in
[1:36:23] the bench
[1:36:24] in the pews while the song surface has
[1:36:27] gone on and the music is nice and even
[1:36:29] if you're in the preaching now some
[1:36:31] people get mad during the preaching they
[1:36:32] even get mad during the Psalms but
[1:36:35] you're really testing is going to be
[1:36:37] when you go through your trials
[1:36:39] you ain't gonna be able to make belief
[1:36:40] then
[1:36:42] because it's going to show what's really
[1:36:44] in you
[1:36:45] brother Brian I'm talking about it says
[1:36:48] they got weary every time they'd get to
[1:36:50] a place where a showdown come then what
[1:36:52] would they do they would fly loose and
[1:36:54] get weary and want to turn back and why
[1:36:57] did this happen to me
[1:36:59] strange this morning after preaching
[1:37:02] that just as hard as I could there was
[1:37:04] many come to the Altar and still
[1:37:05] question it why does this happen to me
[1:37:07] you see how it goes It goes over the top
[1:37:10] of the people's head it's just the same
[1:37:12] people see what Jesus said you have eyes
[1:37:15] but you can't see he said that to the
[1:37:17] disciples and they said oh now thou
[1:37:20] speak as plainly now we believe now no
[1:37:23] man has to tell you anything because God
[1:37:26] shows it to you and he said do you now
[1:37:27] believe see after all this time you must
[1:37:30] and everybody say I mustn't question God
[1:37:33] anything
[1:37:35] you mustn't question anything to God for
[1:37:39] the footsteps of the righteous is
[1:37:41] ordered of the Lord every trial is put
[1:37:44] upon you to prove you and the Bible said
[1:37:47] they're more precious to you than gold
[1:37:49] so if God let a few light afflictions
[1:37:52] and notice their light afflictions
[1:37:56] amen Paul called him light afflictions
[1:37:58] right
[1:38:00] amen it's true see so he puts a few
[1:38:03] light afflictions see let some happen to
[1:38:06] you remember it's for the correction of
[1:38:09] you
[1:38:10] every son that cometh to God must be
[1:38:13] first chastened of God and tried child
[1:38:16] trained there's no exceptions every son
[1:38:20] that cometh these afflictions are done
[1:38:22] or brought about to see what attitudes
[1:38:24] you'll take it's God on this Proving
[1:38:27] Ground that's all Earth is is The
[1:38:30] Proving Grounds and where he's trying to
[1:38:33] prove you
[1:38:36] isn't that good
[1:38:38] okay I'm going to try a hurry
[1:38:41] so another place said the Hebrew
[1:38:43] children them famous characters of the
[1:38:45] scripture that was standing on God's
[1:38:47] word to be true they said our God is
[1:38:49] able to Deliver Us from this fiery
[1:38:51] furnace nevertheless we won't bow to the
[1:38:53] image because it's against the word
[1:38:56] although if you slay us he'll raise us
[1:38:59] up again see he let them walk right up
[1:39:02] to the edge of this great furnace and
[1:39:05] drop into it before it seemed like he
[1:39:07] even paid any attention like he wasn't
[1:39:09] even watching them but he's always
[1:39:11] watching
[1:39:12] he's always watching for this can you
[1:39:16] say Amen so you stay with the revealed
[1:39:19] word by your faith in it
[1:39:21] by your faith and that faith is going to
[1:39:24] be tested and tried to the uttermost
[1:39:26] but here James 1 and 3 it says I'll
[1:39:29] break it in the trying of your faith
[1:39:31] work of patience but let patience have
[1:39:33] her perfect work that you may be perfect
[1:39:38] transformed transforming you right see
[1:39:42] that you may be perfect and entire
[1:39:45] wanting nothing or lacking nothing why
[1:39:49] you're coming to the perfect will of God
[1:39:55] you love the Lord
[1:39:57] and if you notice it's what Paul called
[1:39:59] the faith of God's elect
[1:40:03] for the faith of God's elect are the
[1:40:05] only ones who will prove to have the
[1:40:08] faith
[1:40:09] ain't that right the revealed word is
[1:40:13] priest of them they believe it and after
[1:40:16] they've been tested and tried brother
[1:40:18] Brown said they're still believing it
[1:40:21] it's the faith it's the faith of God's
[1:40:24] elect ain't that right
[1:40:26] so for us to manifest the perfect will
[1:40:28] of God which proves that we are the
[1:40:30] elect of God we have to choose the
[1:40:33] perfect will of God
[1:40:35] before we come into the perfect will of
[1:40:37] God we have to choose that direction we
[1:40:39] have to choose the perfect will of God
[1:40:42] can you say Amen now I don't mean to be
[1:40:44] repeating myself but I wanted to make
[1:40:46] that clear to us
[1:40:49] choosing
[1:40:51] choosing the perfect will of God means
[1:40:53] you have yielded to it
[1:40:55] I'm going to close now but I'm going to
[1:40:57] I'm going to get to where I want to go
[1:40:59] choosing the will of God means you have
[1:41:03] yielded to it
[1:41:05] I choose the perfect will of God and
[1:41:07] then don't yield to it something's wrong
[1:41:10] you got to yield
[1:41:12] ain't that right and again this is where
[1:41:15] the struggle comes because our flesh
[1:41:19] it does not want to yields
[1:41:23] it wants to be its own man
[1:41:28] see the perfect will of God is a
[1:41:29] headship
[1:41:31] headship
[1:41:33] can you say Amen
[1:41:35] now notice again be not conformed to
[1:41:38] this world no notice what the world does
[1:41:40] Apostle Paul prophesied to this day in
[1:41:42] second Timothy 4 and 3.
[1:41:44] saying the time will come when they will
[1:41:46] not endure sound Doctrine that's the way
[1:41:48] of the world but after their own lust
[1:41:50] shall they Heap to themselves teachers
[1:41:51] having itching ears they shall turn away
[1:41:54] their ears from the truth the revealed
[1:41:56] word and shall be turned unto fables
[1:41:59] this is why Paul would tell us don't be
[1:42:01] conformed to the world don't
[1:42:04] can you say man amen no because this is
[1:42:07] where they're headed and it's what
[1:42:08] they're manifesting they're walking
[1:42:10] after their own lusts
[1:42:13] so when it comes to the choosing of the
[1:42:16] perfect will and they realize that
[1:42:18] they've got to yield themselves to it
[1:42:21] ain't gonna do that
[1:42:24] they want to make the message just
[1:42:26] something that you just joined
[1:42:28] just be a churchgoer just live away
[1:42:30] still be involved in the world still act
[1:42:32] like the world and all that and just
[1:42:34] come in here hey there's preachers in
[1:42:35] this message that smoke cigarettes
[1:42:39] because they refuse to come under the
[1:42:41] headship
[1:42:43] they'll preach polygamy under this
[1:42:46] message it's men that want to be coming
[1:42:49] to the message and make it religion
[1:42:52] that they don't want to come under the
[1:42:54] head ship
[1:42:57] can you say Amen so their own lusts
[1:43:01] overrides the perfect will of God
[1:43:04] Jude says they walk after their own lust
[1:43:06] so they're led by their own desires
[1:43:09] their own passions and this is where the
[1:43:13] battle comes
[1:43:15] because there's something within us that
[1:43:17] wants to rise up and say you're on your
[1:43:19] own man you don't have to do that just
[1:43:21] live any way you want to
[1:43:25] but then there's something that's
[1:43:26] growing
[1:43:27] for the perfect will of God
[1:43:35] and we know they're being led by their
[1:43:37] own desires and passions because the
[1:43:38] perfect will of God has been revealed
[1:43:41] and they choose to walk contrary to it
[1:43:44] but we as God's elect cry thy will be
[1:43:47] done
[1:43:48] thy will
[1:43:49] can you say man thy perfect will be done
[1:43:54] amen
[1:43:55] you young people must choose to walk the
[1:43:58] perfect will of God or after your own
[1:44:00] lust
[1:44:02] and I and I want to say for us all it's
[1:44:05] not that we don't know the perfect will
[1:44:06] of God we do
[1:44:10] we do
[1:44:13] but we got to wrestle it out
[1:44:19] I'm going to show you something just
[1:44:21] real quick before I go
[1:44:23] and I want to make something clear to
[1:44:24] you young people
[1:44:26] because I believe it's the perfect will
[1:44:27] of God
[1:44:30] you should not date anyone outside this
[1:44:33] message
[1:44:34] [Music]
[1:44:38] we've got a
[1:44:40] a
[1:44:42] story in the Bible of a man that did
[1:44:44] that
[1:44:46] he was the wisest man outside of Christ
[1:44:51] God blessed him
[1:44:54] but what did he do he intermarried
[1:44:56] he married a woman that was a heathen an
[1:45:00] idolater
[1:45:03] beautiful and brother Branham said he
[1:45:06] died he died a heathen idolater because
[1:45:09] of a bunch of pretty women
[1:45:13] he married outside of his faith
[1:45:17] and Jezebel pulled him away from God
[1:45:20] now I've quoted this scripture but I am
[1:45:22] going to read it this time second
[1:45:24] Corinthians just for confirmation
[1:45:27] for you young people second Corinthians
[1:45:29] 6 14 be ye not unequally yoked together
[1:45:33] with unbelievers
[1:45:36] for what Fellowship hath righteousness
[1:45:38] with unrighteousness what communion hath
[1:45:40] light with darkness and what Concord
[1:45:42] hath Christ with Belial or what part
[1:45:45] hath he that believeth was an infidel
[1:45:47] what agreement hath the temple of God
[1:45:50] with Idols for you are the Temple of the
[1:45:52] Living God as God hath said I will dwell
[1:45:55] in them and walk in them
[1:45:58] do you realize why you're different
[1:46:01] God chose you to come and dwell in you
[1:46:05] and walk in you
[1:46:08] and I will be their God
[1:46:11] and they will be my people
[1:46:15] can you say Amen now brother Brown would
[1:46:17] tell this young man getting married
[1:46:19] married some married some girl that
[1:46:21] don't believe or some uh some young girl
[1:46:24] marrying a boy that don't believe don't

[1:46:28] or how cute she is and what those big
[1:46:31] guys she's got they'll all fade out one
[1:46:33] of these days but brother your soul is
[1:46:35] going to live forever
[1:46:37] you be careful everybody say you be
[1:46:39] careful and I want to just encourage you
[1:46:41] young people you be careful what you're
[1:46:43] doing if she ain't a real believer or
[1:46:46] him a real believer don't you yoke
[1:46:48] yourself up with that
[1:46:50] stay away from such it will cause you
[1:46:53] trouble down the road
[1:46:55] [Music]
[1:46:57] now I want you as a church to know I
[1:46:59] believe that and my family believes that
[1:47:03] yeah you you you you you can't go the
[1:47:05] other direction
[1:47:08] I've dedicated my life to this message
[1:47:12] I've dedicated my children to this
[1:47:14] message
[1:47:18] my wife's dedicated herself to this
[1:47:20] message
[1:47:22] we dedicated this building for this
[1:47:24] message
[1:47:27] can you say Amen
[1:47:29] and we ain't gonna let the devil steal
[1:47:30] it
[1:47:31] we ain't gonna let the devil try to
[1:47:33] connive his way in it ain't happening
[1:47:36] all right you understand what I'm saying
[1:47:42] and I'm not saying my children hasn't
[1:47:44] been tempted
[1:47:48] I'm going to just sit this way and I
[1:47:50] hope
[1:47:52] I hope it's okay it's just us
[1:47:55] if you watch it on internet
[1:47:59] a few years ago
[1:48:02] a son was going to college school
[1:48:06] met a young pretty girl
[1:48:11] nice girl met her really nice
[1:48:14] talked about God talked about it all
[1:48:20] she had a brother that held Bible
[1:48:22] studies there at the college
[1:48:26] and
[1:48:28] they they were uh you know in what they
[1:48:32] believed they
[1:48:34] they done what they knew to do
[1:48:38] and uh I we went and met the family and
[1:48:42] things and they were just nice people
[1:48:43] and things like that
[1:48:46] but they were not in the message
[1:48:49] difference
[1:48:51] they weren't in the message
[1:48:55] so in my opinion that's out
[1:48:58] right
[1:49:00] so he and she got to talking and texting
[1:49:03] each other and they would see one
[1:49:05] another at the school he was attending
[1:49:07] and I'd done my best to discourage it
[1:49:10] that didn't seem to help
[1:49:14] he started attending the Bible studies
[1:49:16] there and
[1:49:21] got to end discussions about different
[1:49:23] things and of course they were night and
[1:49:27] day from what we believed
[1:49:29] and the father wanted to talk to him so
[1:49:31] they got to talking about predestination
[1:49:33] and he was trying to convince him one
[1:49:36] way and
[1:49:37] my son would come say Dad well what
[1:49:39] about it and I said well no
[1:49:41] what the prophet said
[1:49:47] and I told him
[1:49:49] I said you wouldn't even be an
[1:49:50] entertaining these thoughts
[1:49:52] if you wouldn't be messing with that
[1:49:54] girl
[1:49:58] you you wouldn't be asking questions
[1:50:01] if you hadn't been wrapped up in that
[1:50:03] girl
[1:50:04] you understand what I'm saying it leads
[1:50:06] to somewheres
[1:50:10] we we yeah we want to get so safe but
[1:50:13] not the cost of my my children
[1:50:16] and not the cost of your children
[1:50:20] hello
[1:50:22] we don't all of a sudden forget the
[1:50:24] message
[1:50:26] when someone wants to come and date our
[1:50:28] daughters
[1:50:29] or someone wants to come date our
[1:50:31] children
[1:50:32] hello
[1:50:35] you mean we stand on the message we
[1:50:37] raise them up with the message God sent
[1:50:38] a prophet stay with the message and all
[1:50:40] of a sudden we just dis and all
[1:50:42] everything that a prophet said don't
[1:50:43] think so
[1:50:50] finally I told him I said well if you're
[1:50:52] going to go this route
[1:50:55] fine
[1:50:56] I'll take you off that platform
[1:50:59] you will not be on that platform
[1:51:01] you will not sing you will not be on in
[1:51:04] the music you will not be in anything
[1:51:09] demand
[1:51:12] I say that to let you know how serious I
[1:51:14] am
[1:51:15] with this message
[1:51:20] and by God's grace he cut it off
[1:51:24] it was hard
[1:51:27] she cried and she boohooed and she
[1:51:29] bawled
[1:51:32] so some just think you're lucky
[1:51:34] girl crying over you
[1:51:39] God's blessed him with a wonderful wife
[1:51:42] and all these things
[1:51:45] that brother Bram said a a real True
[1:51:47] Believer is
[1:51:49] believes every word everybody say every
[1:51:51] word that God said is the truth
[1:51:54] and they take it the same way
[1:51:57] see the unbeliever denies the whole word
[1:52:00] of God to be true
[1:52:02] ain't that right
[1:52:06] so here we we find that that the
[1:52:08] believer is going to take the whole word
[1:52:10] of God D I don't care what trials they
[1:52:12] go through I don't care whatever I don't
[1:52:14] care the battles that they go through
[1:52:15] when it all settles down they're going
[1:52:17] to Humble themselves unto the might
[1:52:20] under the mighty hand of God to the word
[1:52:23] of the age
[1:52:26] can you say Amen
[1:52:30] if the musicians will come
[1:52:36] the marriage between a man and woman in
[1:52:38] symbolic of the Union between Christ and
[1:52:41] his bride
[1:52:44] and brother Branham said a woman marry a
[1:52:46] man and disagreeing with him
[1:52:49] there would be some kind of a fuss
[1:52:50] continually
[1:52:52] but when a man and his wife his
[1:52:54] girlfriend his espouse when they are in
[1:52:57] Perfect Harmony like one Soul one mind
[1:53:00] because they're going to be one flesh
[1:53:04] then when the church can get in such
[1:53:07] harmony with God until the manifestation
[1:53:10] of the bridegroom is manifested in the
[1:53:13] bride because they are going to be one
[1:53:17] can you say Amen
[1:53:21] you love him
[1:53:24] it's easy to
[1:53:26] to say well that
[1:53:28] that individual you ain't in the message
[1:53:30] so we know not to go that direction
[1:53:33] but then there's times that
[1:53:36] [Music]
[1:53:40] boys and girls in the message that ain't
[1:53:42] solid with the message
[1:53:44] [Music]
[1:53:46] some don't believe that you need to go
[1:53:48] to church
[1:53:49] period
[1:53:51] or that you just come on a Sunday
[1:53:54] some don't think you need to sit under a
[1:53:55] pastor
[1:53:58] some of these guys have weird ideas
[1:54:02] the problem is they want to come and
[1:54:03] attend our youth meetings and such to
[1:54:05] get them a girl
[1:54:12] brother Branham said this he said you
[1:54:14] young fellas you better pray a long time
[1:54:18] ask God to give you a companion you
[1:54:20] young women the same way because it is
[1:54:22] so uncertain
[1:54:25] we see it all the time boys get married
[1:54:27] oh well yeah yeah yeah yeah message
[1:54:29] message profit profit profit
[1:54:32] as soon as I get married to bring a TV
[1:54:34] in the home
[1:54:36] [Music]
[1:54:40] oddly movies
[1:54:42] I think they're Hypocrites that's what I
[1:54:45] think
[1:54:45] [Music]
[1:54:49] they got these you know this technology
[1:54:53] that's becoming apparently pretty
[1:54:55] popular I've heard about it throughout
[1:54:57] the years where
[1:54:59] you can watch a movie and it takes the
[1:55:01] cussing out
[1:55:03] so a lot of these message people feel
[1:55:05] like it's okay now we we can watch the
[1:55:08] movie now rated or whatever don't matter
[1:55:11] we can watch the movie
[1:55:13] and because it silences the cussing
[1:55:16] I don't know what it does
[1:55:19] now you don't hear the cussing so now it
[1:55:20] becomes okay
[1:55:21] [Music]
[1:55:23] you know I think that's a stun of the
[1:55:25] devil
[1:55:26] that anoints people to believe that in
[1:55:27] junk
[1:55:30] what about the motives of the movie
[1:55:34] what about the anointing on them stupid
[1:55:36] actors
[1:55:38] most of them are perverts they're coming
[1:55:39] out of the closet as homosexuals and
[1:55:43] that spirit is in the hole
[1:55:46] they're committing adultery don't tell
[1:55:49] them how many women they slept with
[1:55:51] [Music]
[1:55:53] and they're bringing it in the home
[1:55:55] [Music]
[1:56:00] Hollywood
[1:56:01] [Music]
[1:56:03] brother Braum told us
[1:56:05] about Hollywood
[1:56:08] it's the seed of Satan it's
[1:56:12] it's coming up with our Fashions it's
[1:56:15] kind of it's all of our young everything
[1:56:18] that goes on is coming out of Hollywood
[1:56:21] of what they're feeding into the minds
[1:56:22] of young people feeding through the
[1:56:24] minds and the hearts of the of the home
[1:56:26] our home life is destroyed because of
[1:56:28] Hollywood
[1:56:30] fathers are destroyed because of
[1:56:32] Hollywood mothers have left motherhood
[1:56:35] because of Hollywood
[1:56:39] now the churches want to be Hollywood
[1:56:43] when does it stop but what it is is
[1:56:46] because these young guys claim to be in
[1:56:48] the message they claim to be right and
[1:56:50] our poor girls they believe that they
[1:56:52] believe them
[1:56:55] and they ain't got fathers to stand up
[1:56:57] against it
[1:56:58] so they just don't want to marry the
[1:57:00] guys and then their marriages is is
[1:57:02] rotten because they ain't got the spirit
[1:57:05] of God in the home
[1:57:08] probably ought to be quiet but it's just
[1:57:10] true
[1:57:12] we want to pray thy will be done
[1:57:16] and if there's anyone here living like a
[1:57:18] hypocrite you better get them movies out
[1:57:20] you better get that television out
[1:57:24] On A Life That's worthy of the Gospel

[1:58:07] river you're going to have to battle
[1:58:09] your way through this thing but he that
[1:58:12] endureth to the end the same shall be
[1:58:15] saved
[1:58:16] ain't that right you love the Lord
[1:58:19] isn't he wonderful
[1:58:21] going to be tempted gonna be tested
[1:58:23] going to be tried to the utmost
