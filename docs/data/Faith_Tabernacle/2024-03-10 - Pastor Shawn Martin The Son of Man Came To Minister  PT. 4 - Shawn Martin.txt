filling in for us amen and uh we love the Lord amen trust everyone's had a good week and come just to uh Worship the Lord today amen we love him and uh if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to first of all the Book of Matthew we've been reading from this and um past couple Sundays and Matthew the 20th 20th chapter amen praise the Lord and um it's just good to have everyone uh in the house of the Lord and um um got uh several out and um out of town so we want to keep them in our prayer as they make their way back uh home and also um uh most of you may have known uh that sister Tanya Gordon uh lost her husband uh he passed away uh the other day um kind of a sudden thing um having an operation I get I think from what I've heard and um um they weren't able to to keep him bring him back around and and so um um from what I've known of him and um had met him a few times just a really nice brother and I love the Lord and um you know it's it's it is a comfort to know that you know uh he he knew the Lord and was ready to cross over but it's still um you can never prepare I guess um for the death of a loved one and and uh so I know um and he was just a a young man uh fairly young man I guess and um and so uh we want to keep him uh keep the family sister Tanya in our prayer the Lord will just to help her and also we had made mention of the um the sister I can't remember her name right away but um uh but she had lost her son um in an accident uh last week and so I don't know when the funeral they may have already had the funeral I don't know but um uh he was killed and a logging a logging truck hit him and only maybe 18 17 something like that 19 what was he he was 15 he was 15 okay so 15 years old and uh so that that's got to be devastating as well to to the mother and I'm sure father as well so we want to keep them in our prayer that the Lord will help them and uh tell you what there's many needs many needs that are present uh uh Steve Brumfield um went through the surgery uh good he had to have surgery um uh Friday and um uh but it it went went good they got all that infection out and so tomorrow he's going to have to have a skin graft uh done and uh so we want to keep him in prayer as well that the Lord will just um um uh just be with him help him to recover and not only that save his soul amen and just to help him to surrender uh his all to the Lord amen and so while we go in prayer uh for the word here uh let's just bring maybe bring these needs up as well to our Lord let's bow our head father Lord we stand here today just helpless without you father there's so many needs Lord that are around within the body of Christ and father you see those that are suffering from the of a a broken heart they've lost their loved one husband a son oh God we know how that would be and just Lord I'm just praying that you would be their comfort Lord help them in this time of grief and sorrow Lord our our sister's gone through so much pain and lost Lord lost her father lost her brother now her husband husband father I pray that you would just help her strengthen her father Lord did you youve got everything uh in control lord it's for a purpose for a reason and sometimes it's hard to see that while we're in the trials but Lord we walk by faith and not by sight and pray that you would strengthen her faith comfort her Comfort the parents Lord that have lost her child Lord I pray Lord that you'd be with him Lord and be with Steve father Lord thank you Lord for bringing him through that surgery and I pray father that you'd bring a speedy recovery to his foot but father we're just uh laying before you now his soul that you would save him father help him to surrender his life to you Lord oh God to know you in not just in the power of healing but in the power of your Resurrection God we ask that father and those that would be traveling home today or tomorrow Lord ask that you would be with them Comfort them and strengthen them and keep them safe on the highway father bring them home safely to us I pray that you would just bless the ministering of your word this morning Father I need you today oh God just asking that you would give us the strength the grace the the anointing father may your words of Life be spoken Through Me Lord to your people and may we all just be draw closer to you father any spirit that would try to hinder today and Father we pray that you would bind that thing Lord Lord and drive it away we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen amen and amen we want to look at Matthew the 20th uh chapter and um again we're going to start at the 20th verse says then came to him the mother of zebedee's children with her sons worshiping him and Desiring a certain thing of him and he said unto her What wilt thou and she said unto him grant that these my sons two sons May sit the one on thy right hand and the other on the left in thy kingdom but Jesus answered and said you know not what you ask are you able to drink of the cup that I am that I shall drink of and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with with they say unto him we are able and he saith unto him them you shall drink indeed of my cup and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my father and when the 10 heard it they were moved with indignation against the two Brethren but Jesus called them unto him and said you know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them but and they that are great exercise Authority upon them but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister and whosoever shall be Chief among you let him be your servant even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life for a ransom for many amen amen then if you'll go back uh to Philippians the 2 chapter Philippians the 2 chapter and going to start at the fifth verse actually we're going to just start at the first verse if there be any therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any Fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and mercies fulfill you my joy that you be like minded having the same love being of one Accord and of one mind let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in loneliness of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others and let this mind be in you which which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross amen you can have your seats this morning and uh before we I just want to say that we're going to uh have communion next Sunday the Lord willing and uh so we look forward to that and also um uh there's just going to be one service today and um and so just remember that uh as well but here uh I guess I want to continue with the thought the son of man came to minister and um there there's much power in in ministering uh and the word Minister uh as we have stated it means to wait upon others to serve the need of others to supply what is needed to care for so to minister is to wait upon others to serve the need of others to supply what is needed and to care for I think that's what um God has called us to do is to to be ministers and uh in whatever fashion whatever God has called us to do in life uh we are there uh not to have just an occupation but we are there to minister and um Jesus came to minister to those that were in need uh Luke 19 and10 and if you notice the type of ministry that he had he said the son of man is come to seek and to save to seek and to save that which was lost amen we know his his ministry he healed the sick he cast out Devils he healed the Brokenhearted he preached the gospel to the poor he set at Liberty them that were bruised he preached Deliverance to the captive that was part of his ministry it was to care it was to help the Lord everybody's got their idea of what help means and what their idea of what Ministry is and but this was the ministry of Christ there were those that were bruised there were those that were brokenhearted and he come to help them he come to heal them the right way there was those that were Bound by the devil and such as Mary Magdalene that I think had seven demons in her and Jesus cast them all out and she was set free there was the man that had uh uh called Legion thousands of devils in him and yet when Jesus came by and and and Jesus went across the he went out of his way to go across the the the the sea there and Satan tried to drown him Satan caused the Tempest to come the storm the waves to rock the boat the boat was sinking and and the disciples thought they were going to perish but Jesus had a mission and that was to seek and save that which was lost and there was a man one man out of that whole country country of gilee that that was needing his help and Jesus went to deliver him there's something about that and and we have to say that love is the only thing that could produce a Ministry that he had it was divine love for we know that John told us that God so loved the world that he gave he gave his only begotten son now God must have had confidence in the in in his son God must have had confidence in that Ministry he was going to give him a Ministry that would that would redeem he would give him a Ministry that would save he'd give him a Ministry that would deliver it was a Ministry because God so loved the world and he gave his son and And that son would have a Ministry that would satisfy the love of God and and so in in then we find that that the the the the son people try to say well the he he was the second uh uh uh deity of the godhead and and these things but we find out that that's not true amen we know that to be a false and before I forget it's good to have brother Bob here with us I didn't see him amen and Sister Janice as well and uh We've certainly uh uh I am you know uh even a small church we uh I I forget people sometimes but uh sure good to have them and we sure love them and uh glad he's doing better praise the Lord amen so he he so here's the Bible uh Paul in 2 Corinthians 5:19 says God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself the Lord I think that's profound is that God not only sent his son but he came with his son he came to live in his son to do the work so God took on the form of a man God being Spirit became flesh and Bone and and but then he left he took aside he laid aside his royalty he laid aside amen uh uh his kingdom and didn't lay aside his power didn't change the fact of who he was he's God and you cannot separate the supernatural from God you cannot separate deity from God you can't separate the characteristics of God from God God is a person he cannot be changed in any way he's not a myth he's a person with the personality and what God is he will ever be and no matter what form he comes in he's still God God and so it was God in Christ reconciling the world unto himself he did not leave it to Angels God was the only one that could satisfy the love that he had God was the only one that could have the remedy and take care of the of of what was needed and so he took on the form of man and and and 2 Corinthians 88:9 though he was rich yet for your sakes and notice how God would do it such love such love that he had for us that he would he would become poor for our sake for that's what the Bible says though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that you through his poverty might be made rich ain't that right so brother Bram says he never become kin folk altogether to the rich and to the mighty but he was born in the stable wrapped in swaddling cloth not to the adult but to the child he was God over the creation he chose not he chose to do it see not come a full matured man he came that he might suffer the feelings of the little babies now that's just the the the god that we serve ain't that right so when your little babies are sick and and thinking of uh brother Junior and sister uh Brooks um little one there in the hospital uh a couple weeks ago and and and uh not not feeling good and and all of our babies I guess go through things and things and Satan just he just a meano you know that that attack the innocent but God would come and he wouldn't bypass the little little ones but he would come to be born in a manger in a little as a baby God cried God uh God why you know God had to be taken care of Amen in in a body ain't that right but he done that see um uh uh come not as a full matured man but he came that he might suffer the feelings know the feelings know what they are suffering of the little babies he came that he might go through the teenage Temptations might go that he could toll the tolls and snares of the devil as a man and make a way for people of all ages of all ages and of all classes see the poor the rich they all he became poor that through his poverty we might become rich and HS with him in the Kingdom so all of this was not done in vain it was his plan Amen to feel to know what every person in every of their ages and every class class of people that they might know what or he might know what they went through and through his suffering and him knowing what we go through he could save us cuz he could identify with us when we pray as a little child and say God I need help I'm I'm being tempted by this I'm I'm needing help in school I'm needing help he knows what you're saying he he understands because he's been there as well he was tempted as well as a teenager he knows what it was to have the diaper rash and he knows what it was to to have Gund what gtis or whatever or whatever babies have a lot you know and and these things he knows what it is so when a mother comes and begins to pray God touch my baby it it there moves him because he's I've been there I know how that is I know where that's at right amen see and and and when your teenage AG grows up and and parents amen when we're looking saying God I don't know what to do I'm struggling in these things and and and and all these he understands what we go through ain't that right so he's not one that looks and says well I don't know what you're saying man grow up you know what I mean just get over it no he knows he's been there he understands ain't that right amen see and so he's able to secure them amen see so he says now sign would be given Crossing himself God Crossing himself making him something different than what he was now that's a super sign crying as a baby playing as a boy toiling as a man but it was God living in all stages of life just like we do ain't that right see so but everything that Jesus did amen uh of course again he was the body of God the Tabernacle of God but everything that he done he done it willingly he he willingly done it amen he laid down his life willingly he willingly Sanctified himself and everything that he done was for for us amen and and you you know it's um I I understand that Satan job is to separate us and from maybe not really separate us from church and separate us from the the the the religious things or whatever but one thing he tries to do is separate us from the love of God to where we we feel that God never doesn't love us and that God doesn't care for us and but if if if there's ever a time of just of walking with the Lord we should know that God truly loves us and I know and and and and I mean I know not all the time are we going to feel that that he loves us because we don't go by feelings we have to walk by faith but there should be even when we come to an altar and gave our hearts to the Lord there should be such a connection of God's love to us that that we would know that it's an eternal love that no matter what comes what goes you know even when we don't feel that love we know that his love is toward us because we know what he's done for us amen but there's a love that with you know well Paul says I'm persuaded that nothing shall separate us from the love of God Amen see and so uh but but he Sanctified himself he done all of this because of love and it was it was willingly brother Bram said he had a right to a home he was a man he had a right to be married he was a man he had a right to good clothes he was a man but he Sanctified himself he forfeited see and and he could have he could have come down the corridors of Glory a full full statured man with an Angelic band sure but he Sanctified himself he could have at least been born in a nice clean bed somewhere but he was born in a manger over a manure Pile in a borrowed manger and and yet Jesus says for their sake I sanctify myself everything was done for you and I can you say amen amen as we said the last Service uh Sunday uh he endured the suffering and despised or ignored the the shame amen and and you know so so then you think well how could he do it all willingly H how could he freely do this well the prophet said the simple answer is he was a lamb amen lamb forfeits lamb is a sacrificial animal amen and so uh he was a lamb he had the nature of a lamb he took upon that nature amen not to fight not to not to to uh begrudge or not to uh defend a man but he he stood there helpless he stood there and it was all in a willing uh uh uh with a willing heart so so the prophet said he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself if he had a if he had a wolf nature then he would have lived for himself if he had a wild nature he would have lived for himself if he had that old carnal adamic nature and and but he had a lamb nature and therefore he did not live for himself he lived for others and but notice he didn't just live that way but brother brandom said he set the example he become the example of everyone that would follow after him he become the example amen that we would look to amen not to say well Jesus done that that was him because he was God no he set the example he set the plum line for every Christian boy girl man woman amen he set the example and brother Brandon says now see Jesus was training some men that was going to take the gospel to all the world ain't that right Jesus died he was buried he was resurrected amen but he didn't just leave it at that amen he didn't just leave it to where we all just take out talk about history and take everybody on a history lesson amen but now he would take that church amen and and began to spread the gospel the good news amen not that we would have to die not that we would have to go to the Cross amen for the world he already done that but now he takes us and he spreads the gospel out of the good news ain't that right so he was training some men so he lived a Sanctified life and and forfeited every worldly pleasure for their sake he going to show them how to act he's going to show them how to conduct themselves is going to show them not say well I'm going to give you the gospel now you go out amen and then they don't know how to act they don't know how to live they're going to live any old way any old thing and God not going to bless that God's not going to bless their Ministry they're not going to be effective in any way that now God will but but Jesus says he done it for their sake that they when he would leave they would know what they were supposed to do because now they've got an example amen see so he says see now he he forfeited every worldly pleasure for their sake we ought to Forfeit our worldly dressing our worldly pleasures and things like that for the sake of the people we're trying to lead to God see the outside world he says see so so why do we do these things why why do we conduct ourselves in in a right way way why why are we careful with what we say how we act and and these things are how we should I know it's easy to let our guards down and and these things but but we got to remember whether we're on the mountain top or whether we're not on the mountain top whether we feel that God loves us or we feel that he hates us whether we feel we're going in in a Rapture or whether we feel we're going to hell it does not matter whether it's sunny or rainy whether it's whether it's good days bad days it does not matter God help us all Amen to realize that that none of this will affect us Jesus had rainy days too Jesus had bad days too Jesus had his headaches and Jesus had suffering Jesus felt loneliness and rejected Jesus was anointed and felt great and people OED and old and and and and he had all kinds of they but he never failed on the mission he never amen done things amen and said well forgive get them I don't care I don't I I'm just going to do my own thing it wasn't you see he set the example can you say amen he set the example so we ought to Forfeit our worldly dressing our worldly pleasures and things like that for the sake of the people for the sake of the people that we're trying to lead to God which the outside world can you say Amen nothing of what Jesus did was for his own benefit that's right he gave he gave and he gave ain't that right he gave and the theme scripture of brother branham's Ministry was he's the same yesterday today and forever praise the Lord he's still giving and giving and giving amen why because he still loves he still cares amen he's still trying can you say Amen doing all that he so we we find that this this means that his ministry is still the same Matthew 937 then saith he unto his disciples the har Harvest truly is plous but the laborers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the Harvest that he will send forth laborers into his Harvest so this is the desire this was his goal is not just to redeem but also to to through that Redemption bring forth laborers bring forth laborers ain't that right amen but it had to take a Redemption first amen he ain't going to just send out just carnal born sin man you know uh uh with carnal Natures wild and doing their own thing and making them laborers for his kingdom it ain't going to happen because because man is so selfish he's so in self-indulgent he's so about him himself making a name for himself establishing his own kingdom how can he bring forth labors from that right it would take a Redemption first ain't that right so how would he send them uh uh John uh 2021 Jesus said as my father has sent me so even send I you so the father came down from heaven Amen in and and changed himself amen into a form of Flesh because he dwelt in Christ ain't that right it was God in Christ and what God was in Christ he is in his church amen the same way that the father sent him is the same way he sends us that's right and it's Christ in you the hope of glory ain't that right Christ in you the hope of glory so the prophet said see here he is uh uh he is here today in the form of the Holy Ghost doing the same thing in his church that he did when he was here to carry on the work until the last enemy is put under his feet ain't that right Till the Last Enemy is put under his feet in another place what he was in the days of yesterday living in a body Jesus he will do the same today in his church because that's his program is to carry on with his church he could have just stayed in that body amen he could have lived in the body of Jesus Christ on Earth amen for all these years if he wanted to but that wasn't his goal that wasn't his purpose it was to raise up a church that he could carry on through them his ministry now the then then the church then has the same Eternal qualities the Lord the same Eternal attributes that Christ had brother Bram said man cannot do nothing see uh it's God in man everybody say it's God in man see Jesus said I'm the vine you are the branch now as long as a branch is in the vine it'll bear the fruit of the vine now God always used men for his agent always that's why he used his own son to unveil himself he come down and took on the form of man in order to Die the death for man he could not die in the spirit but he was put to Death In the Flesh then God was in Abraham God was in Isaac God was in Jacob God was in Joseph God was in David he was in all those people back there them prophets and so forth it was God working through men now in this new testament age the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses his church sanctifies it that his holy spirit might continue to carry the work of God on through all ages and he's just the same today do you believe that why is it important that God has a church today that he could work through you know we're living in in a in a crucial time for the world for man time civilization we're not just at the end of an age we're at the end of time we're at the end of all World Order and so we see how desperate the situation is I at least I would think so uh especially being in the message of the hour you could have just imagine imagine how blessed we are yes sir uh to have a prophet and and what he sent us it's it's to let us know the time that we're at I I think of the elections that are going on and and how many churches how many Christian so-called uh people are so wrapped up in the politics of today that they really I mean they're prophesying all kinds of good for America and and and you know uh all rooting for Trump and and you know uh uh whether he gets in or not that's whatever you know and uh there but but I will tell you it ain't going to get any better not not for the believer it's it's just it's just the facts and um you can take that whatever you want to do but I say you could take it to the bank about it because and and the reason why is because God already sent us a prophet ET to let us know that no matter what you do this it's she's gone America's gone she'll never come back she'll never rise it's only going to get more evil more uh the Bible says when they call peace peace uh then cry out for peace peace sudden destruction's coming never has it been for people men calling for peace as it is today but but but you would expect the the The Sinner out there but then to see the churches all ring around praying and prophesy sign and glory to God more is coming and Revival and it's they've got hopes they got Great Hopes for the future of America and of the world um but but if you're really a believer in the message of the hour you know you know good and well God's Wrath is being poured out that's right it it isn't it it isn't because of a democrat or republican or non that is causing the world the way it is it's l the grace of God is being lifted off of off of the world and and this generation Believe It or Not brother Bram even talked about it in in the you ought to go listen to it the souls in prison now and he talks about how that we'd be preaching to the total lost now I think there's a mixture in that uh that that it that it doesn't mean that God can't save uh but because I believe that there maybe one or two left I don't know I don't know but I it was in Wesley and and all that where people just flocking and just coming we're not in that age but but we're in an age where um well you ought to just go listen to it the the the souls that are in prison now and what brother Brandon talked about but so so then then that should make us so burdened not not not despiteful not saying well that old wretched sinner he's gone anyhow I don't I don't believe that I I I believe because because brother brandham says that that just as Abraham and he took Abraham for example that here was lot lot lot was not called to be part of Abraham Abraham is the one that took lot not not God uh uh when when God gave the promises lot was not included in the promises it was to Abraham everything about lot coming out and coming in or whatever it was all to do with Abraham not God and and God Abraham's the one that said hey you want to come along with me we're trying but lot never saw the vision lot never had a passion for the promis like like Abraham had because it wasn't given to him so then it causes conflict remember there was such conflict among among uh the men and and these things that God told Abraham separate you got to separate man and and so uh uh and actually brother Braham saying this is what a Christian does he gives lot the First Choice he said you take First Choice look it all over I'll take what's left and lot because he did not have the insight and he was just the carnal believer and all that he looked at the plains of Sodom and Gomorrah and the luxury and the the the wealth and and the nice and all the Comforts and all of that right and he chose that how many carnal believers do the same thing today they would choose that over the promises of God they they're looking for that's why they're so wrapped up in Trump that's why they're so wrapped up in politics is they're looking for Comfort when God's got a comfort God's Abraham was looking to the pro prises he didn't need Sodom and Gomorrah he didn't need the wealth of men remember even when the Kings come and and was going to give him things and and bless him and enrich him and he said I don't want nothing to do with you unless you say I have made Abraham Rich can you say Amen God's the one that blesses us ain't that right and and so um U but but here lot went out there he made that mistake and then then Here Comes God telling Abraham what he's going to do I'm going to destroy this this Sodom and gomorah and and their sins have come up and and it's just horrible and I'm going to wipe that thing away I'm going to destroy them people and what does Abraham do he starts pleading to God he starts interceding for God not one time he kept on interceding if there be 50 well there wasn't 50 I think or or whatever he said and and and so there he there wasn't 50 and he didn't walk away say well forget it I tried at least I gave it a shot no he stood there and says 40 then there wasn't even 40 there 30 God you got to save them somehow I think he even got down to 10 right and so God because of Abraham's pleading because of Abraham interceding because of Abraham stopping God and and Abraham was a friend of God and God was looking at Abraham's heart it was bleeding for for for lot and God could identify because I really believe it was the spirit of God in Abraham and Abraham interceding for lot so God sends the two angels does what he does you know blinds the ever everybody and takes takes three people out lot and his two daughters because the the wife she didn't overcome she just turned around and turned to a pillar of salt but what did a lot say please I've man I've made my mistakes I've I've done a lot of bad here and I've made some bad choices just take me to Abraham no didn't go there either did he he goes somewhere else and then he gets in captivity right and here comes ol lot or Abraham gets his he gets his men they weren't even trained soldiers but he gets them because for lot's sake I got to go after lot so brother Braham says that's what the real believer does is they go to the end of the road for the Lost can you say Amen they're going to go to the end of the road for the lost and I believe that's where we're at today so why is it important see we're we're living in this time God's Wrath is being poured out if if you really believe the message you you know you know that no one's going to fix this thing oh yes they're going to join you know uh Confederation of churches join with the the Catholic church and it looks all promising but it's not promising and people are getting wrapped up in that thing but they're sealing their Doom they're accepting the mark of the beast can you say amen and and it's it's it's it's a such a deceptive time and and and people are getting caught up in the Trap hello and so we look at you know I was listening to the message presuming uh Friday as we was traveling down the road and and um you know uh just to hear Brother Braham talking about these things and and how that billions of people are just presuming and we all know what presuming means it means to Adventure without Authority Adventure without Authority and and and he talks about the Ministers of great denominations Across the Nation who are preaching doctrine of their denominations and and which is absolutely against the word of God and they presume that they're right many many are behind the pulpits today presuming that what they're preaching is Right presuming that what it is it's the truth can you say Amen see because the prophet said they presume that God requires a certain Creed or an affiliation they are presuming that they are taking the people to Heaven getting them closer to God uh uh by preaching their ideologies and their uh doctors of divinities and and preaching the Creed and and telling the people join a church become one of us and identify with us you see and they presume Aventure without Authority they presume that that they're okay and that's all that man has to do to go to heaven hello see and yet they have no scriptural authority to base this upon they're just presuming ain't that right but they believe it anyways you know and and and the the prophet said you know the Bible has has only one Creed he said there's only one Creed and that's the Bible and that's Christ can you say Amen see so you only have to know him and to know know him is is life and there's no way that a man can find life outside of that can you say Amen so we we understand this by the message of the hour we understand that and the way to know Christ is by having a personal experience with with him not by joining a church or reciting a Creed ain't that right brother Bram said the human soul cries out for something it knows that there's something that brought it here it knows that there's something Beyond here that Soul knows that they don't know the way they don't know how to get there you understand see and so they know that they come from out of the night and they go back into the night see and they know they want to know where they come from and where they're going and if that hunger is in there then you can never get it by blighting your mind see uh uh there see and so because men have taught Creeds and based their learning of the Bible and of God on such shallow things as that joining a church shaking a preacher's hand you know just the uh the the the things that they do then uh uh they they just presume that it's fine you know we look at the holidays of America well the world I guess um but uh you know Easter New Year's Christmas and we look at what people have made them all out to be they made it to be totally different than what God you know than than really what it should be but New Year's for example they have their drinking parties and making their New Year's resolutions and and and all these things as though that it's it's the way to do it it's it's the way to to live life it's the it's the way to face the future it's the way to you know and and they're presuming that they're okay but they're not okay then then you've got looking at the Christmas you know and and how that Christmas has has been set aside for uh uh a day of Christ's birthday in commemoration and the world is set that day for December the 25th and we we know that that's not really the day and and uh but they they set day to celebrate his birthday and and yet brother brand said it shouldn't be a celebration uh uh as as we would celebrate uh Lincoln's birthday or any other man's birthday or or whatever see it should be a day of worship for God sending his son ain't that right but brother Bram would say now we don't know the actual day that Jesus was born so it really doesn't matter as to what day uh because you really we don't know these these things and he says I I suppose that he he uh doesn't he I don't suppose that he cares what day we set aside Because the actual day is lost you understand but one thing that he did about Christmas that he was against and and and what people have made it to be is the greatest commercial days it's one of the greatest commercial days of uh that man has made out of out of Christmas and he says it's all fixed upon passing presents one to another and having feeling hurt if we don't do it and pay them back and well they got me a present so I need to get them a present and well you know and then it starts climbing higher well they you know I I only got them a $25 present and they got me a $1,000 present oh no you know and then it becomes a rat race of of trying to top one another and be better and and all that and he said see it's just Twisted all up see and and and he then he talks of how they what kind of gifts they give he says you know we heard uh brother bramman and his wife heard a conversation between two girls and he says one of them said well what did you get your mother you know what did you get mother for Christmas oh dear I couldn't think of anything else to to get her but what she' enjoy uh more was a pack or a carton of cigarettes and so forth for mother see she said I got dad a qu of whiskey and you know and and she says well I'm glad you did that dear because I got him a new bunch of poker chips you see he said see that's Christmas the things that God is against the things that's going to take people to hell they're they're given these things as a gift for Christmas but it's supposed to be all about Christ you understand and and so he says how can the world stand much longer a celebration he said then I suppose they presume that that's the right way to do it see and he says that's what they're suppos they're supposing to do but they're just presuming that's okay can you say amen and and he says the reason that they're doing all of this the reason why they're they're they're they're living the way they are is because that's all they know the the reason why they got these nose rings and the studs in you know metal studs in their tongues and poking you know holes all in their ears and their nose and their belly buttons and wherever else you know it's it's that's all they know that that that's how shallow the church has brought things that's how they know see they got the purple hair green hair DED it's it's just all kinds of things but that's all they know you understand what I'm saying this generation that's all they know to do you think of it as I've said before give it give it time our my grandchildren or great grandchildren if God terries and time allows it all that they'll be thinking that homosexuals are normal transgender is a normal thing because most of the generation today thinks that women wearing pants is normal when it used to not be normal having earrings is normal when it used to not be normal wearing makeup is normal when it used to not be now we've gotten tattoos everywhere it used to not be in my day it used to not be normal for that I mean you'd find occasional but but not nothing like they're doing today it's becoming a norm a norm ain't that right somebody's got to stop this thing somebody and I know we ain't going to stop the world but somebody's got to tell a different story you understand what I'm saying so now brother brand said see if there's something that causes people to want to do something on that day whether it be Easter Christmas New Year's whatever there ought to be something real there ought to be something real to be done see see so so uh uh there is something somewhere that's the the right thing to do if that's the wrong thing to do see then there's got to be a right because there's got to be a right to every wrong ain't that right or it would be right see so there has to be a pro and con negative and positive ain't that right another place he said there has to be a real dollar that a bogus dollar is made off of or the bogus would be the real amen amen can you say amen and if we are the real then we not must not act like the bogus we don't want to be a bogus church we don't want to have a bogus religion we don't want to preach a bogus gospel amen live a bogus life can you say amen he said when we see denominate a denomination or a group of people that's hunging for something they go into the the church they join the church they show that there's something that they're hungering for that's they're hungering for it why because that human soul is hungering for something ain't that right hungering for something now you know why Russia is is communist today brother brandom lays it up on the church he said they had a Pentecostal move they had a Revival in that country but it was the church that let down the church that compromised and the people decided they don't want to be like the church they don't want nothing to do with the church and they put that to God and every till where they're now they're a communist country hello brother Bram lays it to the church for way America is today religion has been so misrepresent presented until the people have gotten off the true path that God requires and so brother Bram said see people believe that if they're brought into a certain condition or a certain place or to make a certain pledge or something like that that's all that God requires they make a religion about keeping a certain commandment or all the Ten Commandments doing a good deed giving the neighbor something give to the poor doing just doing doing being a good uh citizen get you know caring for the poor caring for this caring for that you know you become more like the Santa Claus of just giving everybody what they need and supplying and you're just exhausted and you just all this but but they make that a Rel that's their religion they make that all about religion surely God's going to accept me now I'm good ain't that right but see all of this is done under the presumption that they are meeting God's requirement his required standard and yet they're living in unbelief and in sin and and all these things and and and oh they might have an authority the church says they're doing okay so now they're living by the church Authority or they're living by the the the the the denomination Authority or even even the government Authority the government's now has you know passed that it's okay to smoke marijuana it's okay you know drinking as long as you know uh uh just don't drink and drrive but you can go out and drink and party and have a good time they they've allowed these things so in now we people are living under an government Authority you understand what I'm saying amen now they're trying to make us believe that that that transgender is is is is you know is okay and homosexuals and people can't help but being that way and and and so what they want us to come under an authority and it's their Authority government Authority well it's got to be okay because because you know so and so says it and and it's a law now and and all these things but the only true Authority is Bible Authority scripture Authority do you believe that see and and and and so and and and when that Authority comes there's no presuming whatsoever you're not adventuring without Authority you might have a government Authority but if you don't have Bible Authority you're only presuming that's right the truth the truth is the authority and Jesus said Thy word is truth Ain that right so this is where we as the Church of the Living God come in and play such an important role in this time because we become the truth as we become the word the Lord this is exactly what Jesus was he was the word made flesh amen ain't that right right so therefore in this age we know where we're at we know what time we're living in as message Believers we know we know it's time for the word to be made flesh the word become flesh in boys and girls and in in women and men and and we know that the lamb has come and taken that book Lord he's loosed the seals thereof and now it becomes an open book it's it's openly declared to us not in letter form not in letter form it's being openly declared in human form God becoming flesh again God becoming flesh can you sayen we know what the third pull is it's the opening of the word ain't that right the opening of the word see so it wasn't a literal book that he's come to claim and redeem uh uh but it is you it is I that he's come to redeem or de claim he's all already redeemed you at Calvary can you say amen and he's made every promise available to where these promises now can be made flesh in us and that's the book he's coming he's coming to redeem he's coming to claim his Redemption not a literal book he's coming to claim a book that is now made flesh made flesh can you say Amen his thoughts that was written is now being made manifest in a church a bride that's right remember in the Old Testament the prophet was told to eat the book Jeremiah I think or Ezekiel one of the two was told to eat the book eat the Scrolls why the prophet said why why why why was he commanded to do that so that he and the book would become one he and the book is to become one amen then we find after the after the lamb had opened the book amen and and brought it down Amen to that seventh angel messenger the prophet amen and he began to sound and all the Mysteries were revealed and and there's not one mystery that needs to be revealed it's already been revealed hello that's right don't need the lamb to come back and and take the book and and open the book or or whatever and a prophet to come back we don't need another Prophet to come back amen that's right amen we are now being dictated by this word not a one man thing but by this word we don't need someone from Jeffersonville to to go get a word from the Lord for the church today you've got the word of the Lord for the church then we find there at that last part of that chapter John which the prophet said would symbolize the bride represented the bride was told to go to the angel and get the book yes sir get the book and eat the book it was bitter it was sweet to his mouth bitter to his stomach can you say amen and I want to say this you cannot eat that book and not have tribulations and trials you cannot eat that book and not have anguish of spirit you can't have that book and and and and and not feel something why birth pains something's happening your old life is being chopped away from you everything is been chopped away from you you are now be the book you are now becoming word made flesh you can no longer live the way you used to live you can no longer believe the way you used to believe you can we can as preachers we couldn't believe now preach the way we used to preach amen and there's a changing there's a churning there is a cutting there is a molding and he says it was weed unto my mouth and bitter in my stomach can't raise your children the way you used to ra raise him amen hello that's exactly right can't act like a wife amen the way you used to act can't act like a husband the way you used to act Church can't act the way they used to act we're eating a book things are requiring a change things are requiring something different than what we used to be that's true amen can't believe that people would raise their children on Hollywood my amen amen if you eat the book you won't do that amen that's right letting these movies be their babysitters letting these phones be the babysitters for their children I don't care if it's cartoons or what amen you got you know Hollywood's got it all set up for your children yeah they're of the devil it's of the devil hello it's the it's Satan's seat here in America Hollywood that's right it's where he rules that's how he's changed civilization that's how he's changed Society that's how he got has gotten people to believe in homosexuals and transgenders is all right there from Hollywood he's got people acting stupid killing murders rioting just acting all kinds of ways the way they dress amen come on now all comes from Hollywood it's an anointing and it and it works in cartoons it works in movies it works in love romance whe whether it's horror movies love romance or whatever kind of of of of your whatever it is if it's coming from Hollywood it's of the devil can I have these monitors my my speaker just went out batteries and so we we look that there is a book the people are becoming the book that's right open book can you say amen that's exactly what we are to do in this age is to eat the book what why to make her and the word one not one with Hollywood not get in that anointing in Hollywood not getting the anointing of all Society that's out here right you got to be of the world Amen in the world and not of the world can you say Amen in the world and not of the world that's right so second uh 2 Corinthians 3:2 Paul said you are our epistle everybody say that you are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all menen amen Ain that right so what did the prophet say we are the only Bible that many men is ever going to read not just talk about it you are to talk about it right you are to tell people about this message you are to tell people about the Lord but more than any of that our life Rings louder that's right than words amen I you know being that we're the only Bible I I think that we are a even a greater witness to others more than than than them just having a bible to read because they can take the Bible you can you can give Bibles out and they can take that Bible and and look at the Bible and it all paint in the their mind a god of history of what God done back then and what God done this and God done that but when you become the Bible then they can see a living God that a God is alive can you say Amen because it's Living Praise the Lord now brother brandham said this God didn't put you here to work in a factory just alone he didn't put you out here just to be a plumber alone he didn't put you out here to be just the electrician alone whatever occupation you are in profession God did not put you in that position just to be that alone but he says he put you here as a witness a written epistle read of all men to live honorable and decent life and a hid consecrated life with God so that men would know that Jesus still lives and Reigns can you say amen amen it's not that they say oh look at him he's just such a nice guy look at everything he does that's not the point you are not to get glory for yourself but that people bu you and through you can know that God still lives one day you're going to die then what happens oh Rich he was still a rock cuz we needed him then what happens you become the god right but when we leave this earth they should know that there's still a God that rules and Reigns there's still a God that lives can you say Amen see so then we find now how how and when how and when do we become written Epistles when we do good for the community is that when we become written Epistles when you know we visit the hospitals and everybody is sick and is that is that is that when we become written Epistles is it because we give you know uh we we just praying for everybody and we're just this and we're just that and everybody just depends upon us is that when we become written Epistles no brother Braham said this when his promised word is interpreted In You by him when that promised promised word is interpreted through You In You by him all right he said see the word that he promised to fulfill in the day that you're living in you'll be a written Epistle of God read of all men not what you claim but what God does through you see that will speak out louder than anything you could claim God said these signs shall follow them that believe see that speaks through you he spoke of this age of what would be now see the Believers of this age has to believe this what he promised today see just the same as they had to come into the ark to be saved go out of Egypt to be saved they have to come into Christ to be saved now into the word message can you say that with me they have to come into Christ to be saved what's Christ the word message to come into Christ they got to come into the word and message ain't that right that he's the same yesterday today and forever how do you get into it by baptism see or by baptism see baptism of what water by the Holy Ghost one Spirit we're all by uh baptized into one body see and his promised word see you won't have to interpret it he will interpret it through you what you are doing what he promised to do ain't that right see the church that follows him will be so much like him until the people will [Applause] know say that again the church that follows him will be so much like him till the people will know can you sayen now I say to you it's time for the word of God to be fulfilled praise the lord hallu it's time that people get their eyes off of Creeds and man-made ideas and personalities and all these things it's time that the people get their eyes off of impersonations yes sir yeah can you say Amen many people truly believe again that they're okay and and doing what they're doing and where they're at brother Bram said you know Israel thought so he thought they were they they thought that they were okay God had delivered them from out of Egypt God had supplied them with food with water God by his Supernatural power opened the Red Sea so that they could walk through on the other side and and oh God was so good to them he he he their their shoes never wore out their clothes never wore out they they didn't need new clothes I don't know how all that happened but all it was Supernatural God was with them God healed them when the serpents were biting them and and they they they and he done it because they were murmuring and complaining and and all these things but then God rich in Mercy provided a an atonement that they could look and live and and all these things and and and so they they they had actually thought that they were comfortable I mean they felt comfortable in so then they got to Kadesh barnea right they got to Kadesh barnea and and there there on the other side of the river was the promised land and and the spies came back bringing the evidence of the land but they also come back with the report that there's Giants and we look like grasshoppers in their sight and and all of these things and they're thinking oh oh well we don't need to go over there God's been so good to us here God's Pro we've seen the mighty hand of God on this side we don't need to go over there why put our lives in Jeopardy but you know what what happened is they lost the vision of God's purpose that God did bring them through yes God did heal them yes God did provide for them in every way yes God did protect them God kept them he preserved them he he done it all for them they he led them that's right for the purpose of them going into the land not to stay there but to go over into the land but they lost the vision of God hello amen so they didn't want to go over to the promised land and and the thing was is that's where the Promises of God late was in the promised land yes sir see that's where all the promises would be made real and they saw the evidence of that land and they refused to go in have we not seen the evidence today amen absolutely I hope it's making a little sense to you today but we've seen some evidence we've had the evidence of perfect love we've seen it manifested we've had the evidence of perfect faith we we've seen the evidence of the power and the placing of adoption and what it does we've seen the evidence of a new land we've had all this evidence America has had it the world has had it they've seen it but people refuse to go on into it hello brother Bram said so many people is afraid today that somebody your neighbor see is going to say something against you he that's why they didn't want to go into the land in in Israel is afraid they was afraid of the Giants there's afraid of the the the the suffering there's afraid of what might happen and he said that's why people don't want the Holy Ghost is because they're afraid that someone the neighbor is going to say something about it see many times the pastor is afraid to say something about the gospel I'm afraid it'll hurt somebody's feelings he said well they ought to be hurt it should be hurt you know sometimes the women are afraid and they say well brother brandom you know she he said just like this poor soul she says I'm afraid that if I didn't you know if I didn't cut my hair off my husband and the rest of the women would laugh at me everybody's afraid they they don't want to be different they don't want to be odd they they want to be everybody the same we all let's all be comfortable God didn't make us to be comfortable and and if you look at it for just a moment and I'm going to I I'll I'll close but but if you look at it God didn't make you to be comfortable because God made us to show others that there's a different way there is a different life but the pow is got to be in us first the life's got to be lived out in us first we just can't keep pointing to brother brandom brother brandom talking he said you know we go to a funeral home and we feel sorry for the person that's dead he said we do our best to say good words over them you know just we we want to think the best of them he said but Jesus said except a man be born again he'll not enter in I mean that's just facts see we we we got to understand these things there has to be a perfect love in the church there there has to be an adopted son and daughter of God there there has to be amen that bride anyone that's going to make that bride that's where that's going to be right there that that perfect faith is going to manifest itself there's so there's no halfway line it's just like the Rich Young Ruler people want to make it like he's went into heaven I mean he done good to the poor he kept all the Ten Commandments and a good church member he he done all this things see you know and brother Bram say see but that there's nothing to say against that but he he did not go all the way he knew he was lacking and he knew Jesus had what he was lacking but when Jesus gave him and told him what to do he turned it aside can you say amen and so too many people are not going all the way they're they're just border line Believers ain't that right see and and so brother Brown said see that that's the thing women and men are doing it today see they go so far in God they believe in baptism or baptized TI they obey all the rules the church is laid out for them but when it comes to surrender every to Christ your life and all that's where the line lays can you say Amen it takes complete surrender Church full obedience that's right brother Bram said that's what real love is he said people get mixed up in love and wondering what love is and he said well you know human love Godly love and they just mix it all together they don't even have a clue he said but real love is obedience right to the word that's so here as we get ready close brother Braham said all Jesus's Works was complete everything was complete total delivered he totally delivered the leper from leprosy he totally delivered the woman with the issue of blood issue he totally delivered the world from sin when he died at the day of the atonement he totally delivered every sin he delivered the church so there's no need for us to live underprivileged people there's no need for us to live in a defeated State because he defeated the devil and took all the principalities and powers and subdued them under his feet and they have no legal rights to rule over you we are Christians everybody say we are Christians filled with the Holy Ghost see that's right see so we don't have to have the devil dictate to us Christ delivered us total Deliverance delivered us from evil delivered us from sin delivered us from Habits delivered us from Talking delivered us from the Black guard delivered us from all kinds of smudy things he totally delivered us and put us into his holy hands a complete total Deliverance he delivered our sickness he delivered us from sickness for we have an abstract de to that Hallelujah he was wounded for our transgressions with the stripes we were healed he is our healer that's why that poor little old Pol old woman trying to take care of her cancer dying husband she walked into the rims in the presence of God she had Faith the doctors had done all that they could do so she followed God's instructions and was totally delivered see the disciples had total Deliverance absolutely total Deliverance why because they were completely and totally filled with the Holy Ghost and when you just a church member and shook the pastor's hands or some kind of little experience of jumping shouting speaking in tongu something like that and still have malice in your heart strange Acts telling lies smoking cigarettes lusting after women there's something there is something that hasn't happened yet there's something that is wrong can you say Amen see and that's what the people need to know they they need to know that there has been a Deliverance there is a true gospel there is a reality to this they need to know the other side of it can you say amen amen that's good and who's going to tell them who's going to show them it's got to be us am and this comes back to the point we've come to minister we've come to serve amen we've come not to please people right we've come to please God so that we can help people we've come we're here to walk in such order with God that he can be pleased with our testimony that he can approve of Our Lives that when we are talking when we are wherever we're at the people can feel the presence of God upon us not that we have to act odd and different not that we have to act so strange we're just common people but there's an anointing with it can you say amen amen amen that a perfect love can flow through us a perfect faith can operate through us that a Divine Divine deity can live through us can you say Amen we ought to be so conscience that to realize that we're at the ends of of time if we don't help somebody if we don't care oh there's a lot of caring going on there's a lot of caring been expressed but no one has answers and they're willing to for forfeit the truth thinking that they can help somebody you know it's okay you know you know God understands where you're at if you want if you can't quit smoking then go ahead and just smoke it's okay you know let's have a social drink so the church is changing their patterns yes they are so they're having smok sections they they're having their drinking little drinking things as brother Brown said they're having their social gather get togethers in the basements and playing their cards and playing Bingo and playing this the church has let down and yet there's people that are dying left and right trusting in the church trusting in the government Trump ain't got the answers he ain't even if he is President people are going to die people are going to die that's just the way it is who's going to tell them about God who's going to change them who who Who's got the the ability to tell them they need to know something that that there's a life after death that there is a heaven can you say man if the musicians will come thank the Lord Jesus Great Is Our God brother Braham said what makes people believe they're okay he said because they're looking at those around them and watching their life and he says here to you older Christians to the younger the younger women look at the older women the younger men look at the older men and see the way you conduct yourself to see what you do and they presume that they're all right is because the way you do can you say Amen so you understand then that puts a real pressure upon all of us right is because people are watching our lives amen and starting with this preacher all the way down God help us right help us to conduct ourselves in in in a way that that even when we're in the trials when we're going through things and that we can ignore the hurts we can ignore the pains we can ignore the the sufferings we can ignore every everything because we know someone's watching brother brah talks about the man that was given gifts remember out in the snow going through the snow and giving gifts to all the neighbors and his little boy watching him and every house that he went to they were saying oh here have a little drink with us so he'd take a little slip time he got down the road he was getting a little bit woo and he starts staggering a little bit you know and he looked back and his boy you know was following him staggering he just saw the boy staggering and he says son straight up you walk straight he said Dad I'm just following your footsteps he said God right now I promise I'll never take another drink again because it dawned on him that what I do affects somebody else how we handle our trials how we deal with things will always affect somebody else amen and then when our life is over we preach our own funeral not by what people say people can say good words but it's really what our life has lived did we really live for the kingdom of God or did we live for ourselves God help us oh God give me is that the one you was playing a heart with [Music] love make me more like thee Oh yes may me more like the Jesus May [Music] me like [Music] thee and give me a heart that's fed with love and made me more like sing it as a prayer to the Lord father make me more like thee Jesus make me more like thee oh oh give me a heart that's filled with love and make me more like thee once again oh just make me more like the is that your desire Church [Music] that's certainly my desire it's it's what I ask God to do is make me more like him hallelujah oh give me a heart that's filled with love and make me more like thee they just play softly no matter where you are at as a Christian I'm sure that we could all be drawn closer to the Lord and I pray that is your heart's desire today is that that we could become more of the word it's funny the the more we grow in God [Music] and there's something within us that compels us you know when Trials come when situations come and automatically we want to act the way we normally would but then we're confronted with the word and the word says no you're not supposed to act that way you're supposed to act this way yeah you're supposed to do it this way and talking about the Divine the the struggles that go on at that point and that's where that we have to come to a full surrender to the word of God and say God thy will be done in my life teach me thy way oh God can you say Amen don't let me just learn knowledge about the message but let it be so rooted in me yes that I can become the message amen I can become the word am take all bitterness out take all Pride out take take take anything that's not like you take it out of my life that we can become the living word amen amen is that your desire amen amen let's just stand to our [Music] feet we um we we want to remember um service Wednesday night at 7:00 and um we'd announced Wednesday and we'll just I guess continue announce it for a little bit but um April 7th we're going to be setting up the tent on April 7th uh be a Sunday afternoon if if the

that we need it need all the prayers and I trust that you carry that on your heart as well and um cuz whether you realize it or not it's these meetings are a blessing to many people and so they're they're looking forward to it and I'm looking forward to it looking forward to seeing what God will do Lord and um so just keep that in mind and remember those that are be traveling probably today after service or so and um that God will just help them those that again that we had requested prayer for today keep those brothers and sisters in mind as they'll have a week of preparing for the memorial services and whatever and then of course afterward and they just need God to help them so we may not be able to do much but we can pray for them and I know that that means a lot amen so God bless you is our prayer and um good to have Daniel and Junior back they drove Wednesday night to Oklahoma attended several of the meetings the services and then got home last night so we're glad that they had a safe trip amen amen let's bow our heads in a word of prayer brother Bill would you want to dismiss us in [Music] [Music] prayer
