[34:15] really looking forward to having him and
[34:19] seems to have a good report among the
[34:22] Brethren and so we thank the Lord for
[34:25] that
[34:26] but um the book of Ephesians uh the
[34:31] second chapter
[34:33] and um
[34:36] or the first chapter I should say and
[34:40] I'm going to just start
[34:42] the um
[34:46] 22nd verse
[34:49] it says and hath put all things under
[34:52] his feet
[34:54] and gave him to be the head over all
[34:57] things to the church
[35:00] which is his body
[35:03] the fullness of him
[35:06] that filleth all in all
[35:08] amen let's just bow our heads precious
[35:12] Lord
[35:15] we're so glad to know that we can make
[35:18] it
[35:19] Lord and in the the times that Satan
[35:23] would throw the questions at us
[35:27] we have an answer
[35:30] and it's it's not coming from confusion
[35:35] that it's coming from an absolute
[35:40] and that is we will make it
[35:42] an old father we're so glad that you
[35:47] would open our eyes in this day
[35:50] that by revelation
[35:54] that we can see Lord who we are and who
[35:57] you are and
[35:59] Lord that there's a a relation there
[36:03] between us
[36:04] and father we're just asking now that
[36:08] you would just come and Minister Among
[36:12] Us
[36:13] father commune with us tonight is our
[36:16] prayer we're your sons and daughters
[36:19] Lord and
[36:20] I pray that you would not only anoint me
[36:23] but anoint the hearing of your word
[36:27] we ask it in your lovely name Jesus
[36:30] Christ amen God bless you all as our
[36:34] prayer
[36:35] and uh
[36:37] good to have sister Cindy back with us
[36:40] amen and missed her this morning and uh
[36:43] just everyone
[36:46] um good to have everyone
[36:48] and just hang in there for just a moment
[36:54] praise the Lord
[36:58] I hate spiders
[37:03] so I hope you're not an animal lover in
[37:05] that way
[37:07] but um
[37:09] we
[37:10] I want to continue from this morning
[37:14] and
[37:16] um
[37:17] so the title will be the Supernatural
[37:20] and and I believe that the bride is
[37:22] beginning
[37:24] to recognize who she is
[37:28] and
[37:30] we could only do that by Revelation but
[37:33] it it had to be the Revelation had to
[37:35] come from somewhere
[37:37] and that's the word of God and that's
[37:39] why God would send us a prophet
[37:42] now brother Branham said you were made
[37:45] for an eternal purpose
[37:48] not a temporal purpose it's all this
[37:52] life is temporal what you do in life is
[37:55] temporal uh you may you know go to
[37:59] college
[38:00] thank you
[38:02] uh you may go to college and and learn a
[38:06] degree but that's temporal you may you
[38:10] may invest in in whatever but it's just
[38:14] temporal
[38:15] we're dealing with an eternal purpose
[38:19] so you were made for an eternal purpose
[38:21] because listen you was the manifestation
[38:27] of an attribute that was in God that
[38:32] thought of you and expressed you and he
[38:36] made an earth to take you out of to make
[38:40] you a human being thing of that made the
[38:44] Earth to take you out
[38:46] foreign
[38:48] to make you a human being
[38:50] God just has reasons for it all don't he
[38:53] and sin come along and perverted his way
[38:58] you come anyhow
[39:00] but you was lost with the world
[39:03] so he come and redeemed you the
[39:07] expressed attribute
[39:10] not just a human being
[39:13] an expressed attribute
[39:15] and also redeems this Earth by the same
[39:18] way
[39:19] then his purpose rolls on
[39:24] I think the way he puts these things is
[39:27] incredible how he makes his statements
[39:30] now so sin
[39:32] temporarily stopped
[39:35] the Eternal purpose of God if if you
[39:38] want to say it that way or at least
[39:40] stopped you because you did not come as
[39:43] uh expressing sonship you did not come
[39:46] expressing as being part of God
[39:50] you express the Fallen nature a carnal
[39:54] nature you express the the expression of
[39:57] sin you were the expression of sin
[40:00] ain't that right of a fallen of the
[40:03] Fallen condition
[40:04] so when I I say that our fallen you know
[40:10] uh uh you know I our fallen state was a
[40:14] part of God's purpose
[40:16] in that
[40:18] he allowed it to happen
[40:21] and you say man he allowed you to be a
[40:24] sinner
[40:25] he allowed you to be a slave to the
[40:27] devil
[40:28] he allowed you to be a victim
[40:32] to have a sinful nature he allowed you
[40:35] to be in the condition uh to where you
[40:38] could be tempted
[40:40] but didn't predestinate you there
[40:43] he allowed it
[40:46] so you were predestinated everybody say
[40:49] but
[40:51] I was predestinated
[40:53] to be conformed to the image of his son
[40:59] and you say man
[41:01] so whatever God allowed to happen
[41:05] in this space of time
[41:08] did not stop or
[41:12] abolish or destroy
[41:16] God's purpose
[41:18] for his purpose is an eternal purpose
[41:22] can you say man
[41:24] amen that's right so God allowed you to
[41:26] come some other way
[41:28] but it did not stop
[41:31] his purpose
[41:34] so so whatever God uh we in this age
[41:40] are living in the age of the
[41:44] manifestation of the sons of God
[41:47] and you say amen that's right no longer
[41:52] a son or daughter of our Earthly parents
[41:59] no longer reflecting our natural family
[42:03] history
[42:05] and you say Amen
[42:07] no longer following the traits of our
[42:12] natural genes
[42:14] now try it
[42:16] yes the body of Christ is made up of
[42:20] natural people
[42:22] right
[42:24] that's right but these people have had a
[42:29] supernatural birth
[42:31] that has broken every natural claim on
[42:35] you
[42:36] death has lost its hold
[42:39] sin has lost its hold
[42:42] your natural lineage has lost its hold
[42:46] all because of a supernatural birth
[42:49] can you say Amen
[42:51] and inside of this natural people
[42:55] resides the supernatural
[42:58] so the fact that we are sons of
[43:00] daughters of God comes from a
[43:03] supernatural work
[43:05] nothing natural
[43:07] ain't that right
[43:09] the second birth our second Birth has
[43:11] nothing to do with the natural it
[43:14] doesn't matter if you were the fur the
[43:16] worst sinner in the country
[43:18] it doesn't matter if you come from the
[43:21] vilest parents or the vilest family tree
[43:24] you could have been you know had your
[43:27] lineage you know from Australia you know
[43:29] where they put all the the vowel sinner
[43:32] or the criminals and all of that uh you
[43:36] know and and you could yeah whatever you
[43:39] you could Chase your your lineage like a
[43:41] lot of people are interested in doing
[43:42] today and you could find out that you
[43:44] know your great great great great
[43:45] grandfather was just uh the cruelest guy
[43:48] and and big bad you know uh uh bill or
[43:52] whatever see but it doesn't matter about
[43:55] that it doesn't matter how low down and
[43:58] degraded you were
[44:00] because that's all coming from a natural
[44:03] lineage
[44:05] can you say Amen so your new birth is
[44:09] Supernatural because God placed his own
[44:15] Jean seed down inside of you
[44:20] now brother Branham says that as the
[44:23] Eternal logos God was manifested in the
[44:27] Sun and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness
[44:30] of the godhead bodily and that Eternal
[44:33] one was the father manifest in flesh and
[44:36] thereby gained the title of son
[44:40] even so we
[44:43] Eternal think of that he's not even
[44:46] dealing with our natural
[44:47] even so we
[44:50] Eternal in his thoughts in our turn
[44:55] became the many membered spoken word
[44:59] seed
[45:00] manifest in flesh and those
[45:04] Eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh
[45:09] are the sons of God even as we are
[45:14] so-called So Not only was he a Son of
[45:18] God we are son of Gods sons of God nor
[45:22] Not only was he in the Eternal thought
[45:25] of God we are an eternal thought of God
[45:29] not only not only did God predestinate
[45:33] that body to live in 2 000 years ago
[45:37] that God would predestinate our body to
[45:41] live in in this age
[45:44] the word became flesh in that body the
[45:47] word is becoming flesh in this body then
[45:50] it took a supernatural thing
[45:53] he was not born by sex
[45:55] he was born by the word
[45:58] ain't that right his birth was
[45:59] Supernatural his conception was
[46:01] Supernatural oh yes you were born by sex
[46:04] but that second birth was born by a
[46:08] supernatural act
[46:10] can you shame man because your natural
[46:12] birth could not produce a spoken word
[46:16] Son of God Amen your natural birth could
[46:19] only produce a rock no down low down
[46:22] sinner that that's Supernatural
[46:25] quickened something down inside of you
[46:29] ain't that right so he said we did not
[46:32] become seed everybody say we did not
[46:34] become seed we did not become seed by
[46:37] the rebirth
[46:38] we were seed and therefore were reborn
[46:43] for only the elect can be reborn
[46:48] because we were seed is the reason we
[46:52] could be quickened
[46:55] in non-seed there is nothing to Quicken
[46:58] ain't that right
[47:00] so then another place which I think is
[47:03] powerful
[47:05] it's through his holy blood that we have
[47:07] access to life
[47:09] and our sexual blood is dismissed
[47:12] now
[47:14] uh that's powerful
[47:16] our sexual blood's dismissed
[47:21] all the traits all the genealogy all
[47:23] everything is dismissed
[47:28] something overrode it
[47:30] and it was the supernatural act of God
[47:34] and we have the blood of Jesus Christ
[47:36] that stands for an atonement making an
[47:39] atonement for our sins
[47:44] is that right see this body of Christ is
[47:47] not made up of sinners
[47:50] we're not sinners
[47:52] this body of Christ is made up of people
[47:56] that has been redeemed
[48:02] that right
[48:04] now yeah and I know brother Brandon said
[48:07] we're Sinners saved by grace
[48:09] but then brother Brandon turns around
[48:11] and says how can you be a sinner and
[48:13] saved at the same time
[48:15] so you understand what he's trying to
[48:16] tell you
[48:17] we were low down
[48:20] but to walk as a person low down today
[48:25] you would be you you would be it's a
[48:27] slap in God's face
[48:30] because he took that and dismissed that
[48:34] we had every right to hang our head low
[48:36] but not now
[48:38] can you say man by our natural birth our
[48:42] first birth we had every right to to
[48:45] Faith look at life as full of Doom and
[48:48] Gloom
[48:49] we had every right to live without hope
[48:53] but in our second birth we have every
[48:56] right to lift up our head
[48:58] for a Redemption draws nine
[49:01] so our sexual blood is dismissed now in
[49:05] the natural courts
[49:06] you know uh uh a man is judged by what
[49:10] he did or didn't do
[49:11] ain't that right so if the evidence
[49:14] proves
[49:16] that he committed a crime
[49:18] then he is judged for it
[49:21] I was kind of keeping up on this this
[49:24] man that
[49:25] that ran his car to the Christmas parade
[49:28] uh last Christmas
[49:31] and you know he fired his lawyers
[49:35] and wanted to represent himself
[49:38] and it was a show
[49:40] and and so he's trying to prove his
[49:43] innocence and here's they've got all
[49:46] this evidence stacked up against him
[49:48] every bit of it
[49:50] so the jury they came time for the jury
[49:53] the jury didn't even deliberate maybe
[49:55] two hours three hours
[49:58] 76 counts
[50:00] and they charged him for every single
[50:03] count
[50:04] face and life for every count
[50:07] and plus 800 years
[50:14] that's for bad
[50:17] but see if the evidence proves
[50:21] that the man committed this crime then
[50:24] they judge him for it
[50:27] but we find that in God's court today
[50:32] right
[50:34] we as Believers are not judged
[50:38] by what we did in this life
[50:42] I think that that is that that's that's
[50:44] incredible because we are judged
[50:48] according to his eternal thoughts
[50:55] that's what's happened in this age
[50:58] judged
[51:00] now we read this scripture this morning
[51:02] second Corinthians 5 17. therefore If
[51:06] any man be in Christ he is a new
[51:08] creature
[51:10] creation old things are passed away
[51:14] behold all things
[51:17] all things everybody say all things all
[51:20] things are become new
[51:23] you mean it's it's see it's not an old
[51:26] patched up something
[51:29] It's All Things become new
[51:32] right
[51:34] amen that's right now what happened
[51:37] why why
[51:39] did the the new what what happened The
[51:43] Sinner came to its end
[51:46] that center part of you had come to its
[51:50] end
[51:50] and God
[51:53] put you on a different path
[51:56] ain't that right
[51:58] seek God had a what God had allowed
[52:03] has come to its end
[52:06] your Fallen state has come to its end
[52:10] can you say Amen
[52:12] that was judged
[52:14] that was doomed that was condemned
[52:18] and it had to die
[52:21] can you say Amen
[52:23] but it only died
[52:25] so that another could be reborn
[52:29] ain't that right
[52:30] now
[52:31] do you believe that we are at the end of
[52:34] all things
[52:36] we're at the end of all things
[52:38] now I think this is marvelous
[52:40] because the new we're thinking of that
[52:43] new
[52:44] the heavens and earth are coming to
[52:47] their end
[52:48] the natural kingdoms have come to their
[52:50] end look at them scrambling around
[52:52] trying to save the save save the country
[52:55] to save the world it's come to its end
[52:59] ain't that right natural religions have
[53:02] come to their hand the natural
[53:04] governments have come to their end the
[53:07] Bible even speaks about uh the ends of
[53:10] the Earth and at the ends of the Earth
[53:13] we are commanded to look unto him
[53:16] for salvation ain't that right see so
[53:20] what we're looking at is if it's come to
[53:23] its sin that tells us that what God has
[53:26] allowed for these segment of time
[53:29] has come to its end so that what he had
[53:33] originally thought in his mind
[53:38] would now come to manifestation
[53:41] can you say Amen
[53:43] we have come to the place
[53:47] and everything is now going back to the
[53:51] place where we originally started and
[53:55] that was the Eternal thoughts of God
[53:58] God saved you but not only just saved
[54:02] you he redeemed you
[54:05] then you say Amen if he redeemed you
[54:09] that means there's that Eternal purpose
[54:11] that is still living
[54:13] and God is brought you to where you can
[54:16] now start manifesting his eternal
[54:19] purpose
[54:21] all things are passed away
[54:25] them things have come to an end
[54:31] brother Matt another example is telling
[54:34] me he said you know
[54:36] come to your meeting
[54:39] there in April in
[54:41] he said bro Sean things that I have
[54:43] tried to quit for years and years
[54:48] habits
[54:49] things in my life that I just couldn't
[54:52] get rid of
[54:54] he said I come to your meeting and
[54:56] something happened
[54:58] he said I went home a different person
[55:01] he said even my friends know what I
[55:03] would do
[55:05] they know it
[55:07] and yet they can't understand what's
[55:09] happened
[55:10] because I don't desire it no more
[55:12] I don't want it no more
[55:15] the power of sin is broken
[55:19] I tell you what it is it's an eternal
[55:21] thought
[55:22] now coming to manifestation
[55:30] people have tried for years to break
[55:32] things and they can't
[55:34] but God does it once
[55:36] and it's broken
[55:38] people's tried to quit smoking
[55:40] cigarettes and they just can't but when
[55:42] God gets a hold of them it's over
[55:45] then you say man now that's our
[55:47] testimony we are here as Paul would say
[55:50] I am what I am by the grace of God
[55:56] ain't that right
[55:57] so we've come back to the place where we
[56:02] originally started and that's the
[56:04] Eternal thoughts of God
[56:06] the perfect wheel
[56:08] of God
[56:10] what God allowed is coming to an end
[56:15] what God predestinated
[56:18] is coming to manifestation
[56:23] amen
[56:25] notice
[56:26] I hope it's all right
[56:28] Isaiah 42 and 7.
[56:32] it says behold the former things are
[56:34] come to pass
[56:35] and new things
[56:37] do I declare
[56:39] new things
[56:41] Isaiah 65 17 God says for behold I
[56:45] create new heavens and a new Earth and
[56:49] the formal things shall not be
[56:51] remembered nor come into mind
[56:54] when God does it he just does it
[56:58] Revelations 21 and 1 and I saw a new
[57:02] Heaven and a new Earth for the first
[57:06] heaven and first Earth were passed away
[57:08] and there was no more sea and I saw the
[57:12] holy city New Jerusalem coming down from
[57:15] God out of Heaven prepared as a bride
[57:17] adorned for her husband and I heard a
[57:19] great voice out of Heaven saying behold
[57:21] the Tabernacle of God is with men and he
[57:24] will dwell with them and they shall be
[57:25] his people and God himself shall be with
[57:27] him and be their God
[57:30] notice and God shall wipe away all tears
[57:34] from their eyes and there shall be no
[57:37] more death
[57:38] neither Sara nor crying neither shall
[57:42] there be any more pain
[57:44] for the former things are passed away
[57:50] now we can shout over that because God
[57:53] has already done something new down
[57:56] inside this boy
[57:58] he's done suck new in you to make you a
[58:02] church a body of his
[58:04] can you say Amen
[58:07] now think of it new new Heavens new
[58:09] Earth tears won't be there
[58:12] death won't be there pain won't be there
[58:15] cyride crying murder won't be there
[58:19] Temptations won't be there loneliness
[58:22] won't be there can you say man that's
[58:25] right why he's making something new
[58:28] and whatever it was in the former is
[58:31] going to be done away with
[58:34] ain't that right and no man I don't care
[58:37] what they do can make anything new
[58:44] look at Solomon
[58:47] he says there's nothing new Under the
[58:49] Sun
[58:50] nothing
[58:52] there's not
[58:54] Brandon tells us it's just been a cycle
[58:57] history repeating itself
[59:00] right
[59:01] history repeating itself
[59:05] that's right
[59:07] but when God makes something new when he
[59:10] does it it's over
[59:14] now the body of Christ is a new creation
[59:19] made up of people who are a new creation
[59:23] in Christ Jesus
[59:25] the old habits are gone
[59:27] the old desires are gone all unbelief is
[59:31] gone the old nature is gone the old
[59:35] Fighting is gone
[59:37] why God made something new
[59:44] the Creeds Traditions dogmas a man has
[59:49] no part of this creation
[59:54] the former things
[59:56] are passed away
[59:59] ain't that right
[1:00:00] now we're coming to what it really means
[1:00:02] of justification you never did it in the
[1:00:05] first place
[1:00:06] brother Brown said this old this old
[1:00:08] life has passed away never listen now
[1:00:12] this is incredible never to be
[1:00:14] remembered by God
[1:00:18] this old life
[1:00:20] is passed away
[1:00:22] never to be remembered by God
[1:00:26] man can do things new they can start a
[1:00:28] new Leaf every year turn the new page
[1:00:32] that God remembers
[1:00:34] ain't that right and he always seems to
[1:00:37] go right back to what they tried to
[1:00:39] leave
[1:00:39] they start out trying to do something
[1:00:41] new and it always comes back on them but
[1:00:44] this when God does something so new is
[1:00:47] it that God can't even remember your old
[1:00:50] past
[1:00:53] did you notice that God promised
[1:00:56] I am new
[1:00:58] God promised to give the overcomer
[1:01:03] a new name
[1:01:07] a new name
[1:01:09] he gave you a new life
[1:01:12] a new beginning
[1:01:14] and he says I'll give you a new name
[1:01:17] and you know what it's going to be his
[1:01:19] new name
[1:01:20] ain't that right Revelations 3 13 him
[1:01:24] that overcometh will I make a pillar in
[1:01:27] the temple of my God
[1:01:29] and he shall go out no more
[1:01:33] hello
[1:01:34] not in and out anymore
[1:01:38] and I will write upon him the name of my
[1:01:41] God which is Jesus Christ
[1:01:45] and the name of the city of my God which
[1:01:48] is New Jerusalem which cometh down out
[1:01:51] of of Heaven from my God can you say
[1:01:54] Amen so the prophet says he goes ahead
[1:01:57] and tells what the name of the city is
[1:01:58] New Jerusalem the church itself is the
[1:02:02] New Jerusalem
[1:02:05] ain't that right we can go into a lot of
[1:02:08] that right there for you but but we'll
[1:02:10] move on but
[1:02:11] she is the New Jerusalem
[1:02:17] now Abraham met the king
[1:02:20] Melchizedek right
[1:02:23] now Revelations 21 2.
[1:02:26] John says and I John saw the holy city
[1:02:29] New Jerusalem coming down from God out
[1:02:34] of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned
[1:02:37] for her husband
[1:02:38] ain't that right knows what brother
[1:02:40] Brown says the new church is the Gentile
[1:02:43] Church the bride notice it's a new
[1:02:47] church
[1:02:48] and that new church is the Gentiles the
[1:02:52] bride
[1:02:53] the Bride is a gentile and the Gentile
[1:02:56] has his name
[1:03:00] he took out of uh took a people out of
[1:03:03] the Gentiles for his name's sake
[1:03:06] so God says I will write upon him the
[1:03:09] name of my God and the name of the city
[1:03:12] of my God and will write upon him my new
[1:03:15] name
[1:03:16] now I I think this is powerful look
[1:03:19] brother Brown would say then which is
[1:03:22] all the same Jesus Jesus Jesus
[1:03:27] and you say Amen what's the name he's
[1:03:30] going to write Jesus
[1:03:32] ain't that right and so forth see he
[1:03:35] says see and the bride married to Jesus
[1:03:38] watch it makes it Miss Jesus
[1:03:45] and you say Amen
[1:03:47] foreign
[1:03:49] how did he accomplish it
[1:03:52] he overcome death hell in the grave
[1:03:59] and he purchased you
[1:04:02] then you say Amen in overcoming he got
[1:04:06] you
[1:04:07] for you are his victory
[1:04:11] ain't that right
[1:04:14] new church I like that new church not
[1:04:17] old church
[1:04:19] not something just carrying the same old
[1:04:21] same old same old
[1:04:22] new church
[1:04:24] and the bride married to Jesus makes it
[1:04:27] Miss Jesus and so forth there's some
[1:04:30] mighty fine women in this building
[1:04:31] tonight mighty fine but there's one of
[1:04:34] them that's mine
[1:04:36] she's got my name
[1:04:38] ain't that right
[1:04:39] and I hope you got that he says she's
[1:04:41] bearing my name soul will his bride
[1:04:47] and did you know the name of Jesus has
[1:04:49] deity in it
[1:04:51] the name Jesus Christ has deity that's
[1:04:55] right see and did you know a name change
[1:04:57] has something to do with your life
[1:05:01] sure does God changed Jacob's name which
[1:05:04] meant uh Jacob men subplanator Deceiver
[1:05:08] ain't that right and he changed it to
[1:05:11] Israel
[1:05:12] which means a prince having power with
[1:05:16] God
[1:05:18] God would recognize the change and gave
[1:05:22] him a name change
[1:05:24] ain't that right
[1:05:26] and his name changed when he got his
[1:05:29] overcoming power and wrestled with the
[1:05:33] angel
[1:05:35] what happened
[1:05:36] he had come to the end
[1:05:39] of his old life
[1:05:42] what Jacob was Jacob was no more
[1:05:46] he changed
[1:05:48] and God gave him a name change to Bear
[1:05:52] record that that character that nature
[1:05:55] had changed that ain't the same Jacob
[1:05:57] anymore
[1:05:59] God recognized it
[1:06:02] Simon the fisherman got his name changed
[1:06:05] to Peter
[1:06:07] the prophet said when he overcome by his
[1:06:09] faith
[1:06:10] in Jesus
[1:06:12] something changed in him to where he had
[1:06:15] never be the same again
[1:06:17] and you say man brother Brown said see
[1:06:20] your name has something to do with it
[1:06:22] your placement in life
[1:06:26] and it has an impression on your
[1:06:29] character
[1:06:30] now you know brother Brown was big in
[1:06:32] names
[1:06:33] said if you named your child Ricky
[1:06:35] change it
[1:06:37] change it to number one number two
[1:06:39] but don't leave it Ricky
[1:06:42] he said it's in this age
[1:06:45] now Elvis and rickly Ricky has has come
[1:06:48] that name has come to the Forefront
[1:06:50] never has it been till this age why it's
[1:06:54] showing the age that we're living in
[1:06:58] ain't that right
[1:07:00] this bride has been changed
[1:07:04] we've been called out
[1:07:06] not bearing the old habits and the old
[1:07:09] Cycles the cycles of religion has been
[1:07:13] broken over this body
[1:07:18] Abraham
[1:07:19] or Abram had to have his Earthly name
[1:07:23] changed to a name given by God Abraham
[1:07:27] the prophet said God gave him a part of
[1:07:29] his own name
[1:07:31] ain't that right
[1:07:33] that's right see so he says these names
[1:07:35] either brought about a change or were
[1:07:39] given because of a change
[1:07:42] but the name means something
[1:07:45] ain't that right
[1:07:47] listen now only only after Abraham and
[1:07:51] Sarah had their names Changed by the
[1:07:54] Lord that they were made ready to
[1:07:57] receive the coming son
[1:08:00] I like that
[1:08:02] God knew what he was doing
[1:08:04] he changed that name
[1:08:08] and only after their name was changed
[1:08:10] could they receive the coming son
[1:08:14] and you say Amen life entered into them
[1:08:18] now we know that Abraham and Sarah's
[1:08:20] story types our story
[1:08:24] right
[1:08:25] after Saul received the Lord his name
[1:08:28] was changed to Paul
[1:08:30] see and even when Jesus overcome death
[1:08:34] hell and the grave the Bible says he
[1:08:37] received a new name
[1:08:41] now listen
[1:08:43] the prophet says if the church can
[1:08:45] overcome
[1:08:46] she will stop saying I am Methodist
[1:08:49] I'm Baptist Presbyterian
[1:08:52] when she can overcome her Creeds and the
[1:08:55] world that's drawn her in there she'll
[1:08:57] come back to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:09:00] miss everybody say Miss Jesus Christ
[1:09:05] and you say Amen
[1:09:07] Miss Jesus Christ and again there's only
[1:09:11] one name that holds deity
[1:09:16] and that is the name of Jesus Christ
[1:09:19] now notice he says the church will come
[1:09:21] through justification through Luther
[1:09:23] through sanctification through Wesley
[1:09:25] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost or
[1:09:27] the Pentecostals and go right on in to
[1:09:30] the Perfection of the son of man that
[1:09:33] when husband and wife will be the
[1:09:36] self-same persons
[1:09:39] no other time in the history as the
[1:09:43] church board the name of Jesus Christ
[1:09:46] like it does today
[1:09:48] why they have become United
[1:09:52] I knew God's done something new
[1:09:58] he's taken out a bride or out of people
[1:10:00] out of the Gentiles in this day
[1:10:02] for his name
[1:10:08] he said see to go right into the
[1:10:10] Perfection of the son of man that when
[1:10:12] husband and wife will be the same self
[1:10:14] persons God have mercy
[1:10:18] God will be so manifested into his bride
[1:10:21] his church till they will both be the
[1:10:24] same they are one
[1:10:28] think Heaven we've come to a place
[1:10:31] a people on earth that could actually
[1:10:34] say he that has seen me has seen the
[1:10:37] father
[1:10:38] [Music]
[1:10:42] they are one
[1:10:45] he says now
[1:10:47] you see where we're at
[1:10:52] I know you know these things but I
[1:10:55] hope it's refreshing you
[1:10:59] see you are part of the godhead
[1:11:03] I've said this for years I just believe
[1:11:06] it you're part of the godhead
[1:11:08] there's nothing wrong with that
[1:11:13] when you really see who you are
[1:11:15] you can't be part of God and not part of
[1:11:17] the godhead
[1:11:19] come on Church
[1:11:22] and you say man
[1:11:26] and in the godheads you are Sons and
[1:11:28] Daughters of God
[1:11:31] now notice I've read this I think last
[1:11:33] Sunday in him everybody say in him
[1:11:35] dwells the fullness of the godhead
[1:11:38] bodily
[1:11:40] where we in there
[1:11:43] where in the godhead are Sons and
[1:11:46] Daughters to God in God's godhead
[1:11:52] yes
[1:11:54] as Sons and Daughters we're in the
[1:11:57] family if you're in there
[1:12:02] God the Father
[1:12:03] God the son
[1:12:06] God the Holy Ghost
[1:12:08] not three different gods
[1:12:10] same person
[1:12:12] three different offices
[1:12:14] God in the pillar of Fire
[1:12:16] but when he wanted to become son
[1:12:21] he created a body
[1:12:24] right
[1:12:26] and then he comes as the Holy Spirit
[1:12:29] but not without a body
[1:12:32] he'd been working on that body
[1:12:34] ain't that right
[1:12:36] he's been working on that body
[1:12:38] that's right
[1:12:40] so when he comes as Holy Spirit
[1:12:43] and then he there's that age you know he
[1:12:45] was Son of God but then he changes the
[1:12:47] dispensation to
[1:12:49] son of man why
[1:12:52] a body
[1:12:54] is on Earth
[1:12:57] you
[1:13:00] can you say Amen
[1:13:01] just as much as God couldn't be son
[1:13:04] without the body of Jesus Christ God
[1:13:06] couldn't be bride without a
[1:13:08] many-membered body
[1:13:10] can you say man it took you to complete
[1:13:14] God
[1:13:19] the church is the fullness of God
[1:13:22] she's the completion of God
[1:13:28] he was the beginning of the creation
[1:13:34] if I can say it this way you're the
[1:13:35] ending the completion
[1:13:38] the final of the creation
[1:13:40] Hallelujah
[1:13:45] Hallelujah man
[1:13:48] one man
[1:13:50] one man in this age
[1:13:53] and not not a created word body
[1:13:56] a redeemed body
[1:13:59] stood there and said let there be
[1:14:00] squirrels
[1:14:02] it happened
[1:14:06] and then the prophet says even Jesus in
[1:14:08] that body
[1:14:10] did not create
[1:14:12] he took water and turned it into wine
[1:14:17] he grabbed dust spit it and put it in
[1:14:20] the eyes sockets of the blind
[1:14:23] ain't that right
[1:14:25] but in this age
[1:14:27] God in his bride
[1:14:31] stood there
[1:14:33] and said let there be
[1:14:36] and there was
[1:14:40] it confounds the unbeliever but that's
[1:14:42] okay I believe it
[1:14:45] amen I believe it's so
[1:14:48] can you say man
[1:14:50] what is it we're coming back to the
[1:14:52] Eternal thoughts of God
[1:14:54] no church could produce that no Doctrine
[1:14:56] no Seminary no Theologian could produce
[1:14:59] it God himself has come
[1:15:04] you say man
[1:15:08] don't doubt it Who You Are
[1:15:10] don't underestimate Who You Are
[1:15:13] you say well I ain't spoken squirrels
[1:15:15] into existence that may not be you
[1:15:18] but as you receive the word of this
[1:15:20] message you receive God
[1:15:23] and that same God in you is just as much
[1:15:25] as powerful as it was in a prophet
[1:15:27] and that God that was in that Prophet
[1:15:30] was in the body of Jesus Christ
[1:15:35] ain't that right
[1:15:36] and did he not say Greater Works than
[1:15:38] these shall you do
[1:15:40] I know people say that's that's all
[1:15:42] brother Branham I don't believe that
[1:15:44] brother Brown never taught that he said
[1:15:47] that's to the believer
[1:15:49] to the believer the more you yield to
[1:15:51] God the more you believe them promises
[1:15:53] watch it happen
[1:16:00] don't bemoan your situations
[1:16:03] don't be moaning the conditions you're
[1:16:05] in don't look at your lost loved one
[1:16:08] just yield to him
[1:16:11] who has taken your vessel
[1:16:14] and used it for his body
[1:16:20] amen
[1:16:22] now
[1:16:24] in there in there in the godhead
[1:16:28] see in God's godhead
[1:16:30] we're sons and daughters
[1:16:33] of God
[1:16:34] Church attendance does not make you
[1:16:37] son or daughter of God
[1:16:39] Holiness don't make you a son or
[1:16:42] daughter of God
[1:16:43] reading praying
[1:16:47] doesn't make you a son or daughter of
[1:16:49] God
[1:16:52] and I'm going to get more into that in
[1:16:54] in later because brother Brown deals
[1:16:56] with it
[1:16:57] but your salvation your Redemption you
[1:17:01] being placed in the body
[1:17:04] does not have anything to do with
[1:17:06] literal things
[1:17:10] it's beyond that
[1:17:13] it's into the kingdom of God with
[1:17:15] eternal life as we read this morning
[1:17:16] with the predestinated that never did
[1:17:19] start
[1:17:19] it never started on any day you wasn't
[1:17:22] saved on any day you was always saved
[1:17:25] right we could go back and read them
[1:17:27] quotes but I'm not going to but but I
[1:17:30] will say brother Brown said you passed
[1:17:32] into eternity from where you came from
[1:17:35] you was there to begin with
[1:17:39] and you say man you was there
[1:17:42] everybody say I was there to begin with
[1:17:48] so God ended
[1:17:50] that sinner life
[1:17:52] and doesn't hold it to you
[1:17:57] he allowed it
[1:17:59] to be an expression to to be able to
[1:18:02] express himself to you in certain ways
[1:18:07] but you're sealed now
[1:18:09] if you've received the Holy Ghost you're
[1:18:11] sealed you can never come back and be a
[1:18:13] sinner
[1:18:15] so you never have to come back to an
[1:18:17] altar
[1:18:18] or say the sinner's prayer again
[1:18:21] Prophet said yes you're going to make
[1:18:23] mistakes yes you're subject to mistakes
[1:18:25] but you'll never have to come back to
[1:18:28] God as a sinner and say a sinner's
[1:18:31] prayer again
[1:18:35] there's an atonement
[1:18:37] right
[1:18:39] so dealing with
[1:18:42] sinner today or tomorrow save today
[1:18:45] Center tomorrow don't know where I stand
[1:18:47] all that that's got to be gone
[1:18:49] now we've got to find our establishment
[1:18:54] can you say man
[1:18:56] now and I'm I'm not gonna I appreciate
[1:18:59] your patience I'm not going to keep you
[1:19:00] much longer
[1:19:02] but so many times
[1:19:04] people look to the Natural side of
[1:19:06] things as a Vindication that they're
[1:19:08] saved
[1:19:10] on the on their way to heaven or
[1:19:12] whatever there have been men rise up
[1:19:16] claiming you know to have oil or blood
[1:19:19] running out of their hands
[1:19:21] the prophet talked about people having
[1:19:22] blood in the face
[1:19:24] and they have called these things as the
[1:19:27] people look on these things as divine
[1:19:30] as something spiritual as something as a
[1:19:34] vindication
[1:19:37] well for number one
[1:19:39] the scripture doesn't say anything like
[1:19:41] that the scripture does not prophesy of
[1:19:44] anything like that so so that is so
[1:19:47] wrong
[1:19:49] now the prophet says any these days any
[1:19:51] man can get a following
[1:19:53] because people become so gullible
[1:19:57] ain't that right
[1:19:58] now what God would do is send us a
[1:20:00] prophet to keep us from being gullible
[1:20:07] so those things have nothing to do with
[1:20:09] being a Son of God they have nothing to
[1:20:11] do with God
[1:20:13] but also as I said this morning people
[1:20:16] have made salvation all about outward
[1:20:19] demonstration shaken the breacher's
[1:20:21] hands signing your name citing a Creed
[1:20:24] of of of of a certain Church
[1:20:27] then you you have the Pentecostals that
[1:20:30] have put main emphasis on Sensations
[1:20:33] emotions speaking in tongues dancing in
[1:20:36] the spirit
[1:20:37] prophecy interpreting tongues having
[1:20:41] dreams seeing visions and brother Brown
[1:20:44] said they have depended on Sensations or
[1:20:47] a Psalm and any little sign of something
[1:20:51] to happen or they won't believe what the
[1:20:53] word of God says
[1:20:56] true
[1:20:57] the preaching come on I'm talking about
[1:21:00] something Supernatural
[1:21:03] that is beyond the natural
[1:21:06] but they have taken the naturalist signs
[1:21:15] so they depend on some natural thing to
[1:21:17] be done or said
[1:21:19] before they even recognize themselves as
[1:21:21] Christians
[1:21:24] how many people
[1:21:28] see others dancing well I've never done
[1:21:30] that
[1:21:31] and they feel like they've not gotten
[1:21:33] anywhere with God
[1:21:36] well that is no measure
[1:21:40] well I've never spoken tongues that is
[1:21:42] no measure
[1:21:45] well I've never prophesied I I've never
[1:21:48] felt much that that that that is no
[1:21:51] measure
[1:21:52] and you say man
[1:21:54] that's right see see notice what the
[1:21:56] prophet said all the natural work
[1:21:58] everybody say all the natural work was
[1:22:01] done
[1:22:02] by the sacrifice of Christ
[1:22:08] so we don't need natural displays
[1:22:13] as a Vindication for our salvation
[1:22:17] can you say man notice John 19 30 when
[1:22:21] Jesus therefore had received the vinegar
[1:22:24] vinegar he said it is finished
[1:22:29] three most powerful words
[1:22:33] one of them
[1:22:35] it is finished
[1:22:37] not just for his life for your life
[1:22:44] Satan's power was finished
[1:22:46] Satan's claim on you was finished
[1:22:49] Satan's domain was finished every
[1:22:53] perversion of Satan over your life was
[1:22:55] finished
[1:23:00] the thing that separated man from God
[1:23:03] was finished
[1:23:08] it is finished
[1:23:11] why because of that natural death that
[1:23:14] natural Act
[1:23:16] of Jesus Christ
[1:23:19] Hebrews 10 14 for by one offering
[1:23:22] everybody say one offering
[1:23:24] what one offering was that the offering
[1:23:27] of Jesus Christ God offered his own son
[1:23:31] on your behalf
[1:23:34] and by that one offering he hath
[1:23:36] perfected forever them that are
[1:23:38] sanctified
[1:23:42] by one natural Act
[1:23:47] there's been many natural religious Acts
[1:23:50] but by this natural Act
[1:23:53] it was finished
[1:23:56] by this one natural Act
[1:24:00] he perfected all
[1:24:03] once and for all
[1:24:06] them that are sanctified
[1:24:09] good Lord
[1:24:18] Supernatural
[1:24:21] so you he had perfected you before
[1:24:24] you were born
[1:24:27] before you even had a history
[1:24:32] he perfected you
[1:24:37] can you say Amen
[1:24:41] so now where are we at now
[1:24:43] one natural act finished it
[1:24:46] so now where are we standing
[1:24:50] remember in the book of Acts Peter
[1:24:52] preached a sermon to the people there in
[1:24:55] Acts 13 48.
[1:24:57] and said and when the Gentiles heard
[1:25:00] this
[1:25:01] they were glad
[1:25:03] and glorified the Lord the word of the
[1:25:08] Lord
[1:25:09] hello
[1:25:10] they were glad and glorified the word of
[1:25:15] the Lord
[1:25:16] and as many as were ordained to eternal
[1:25:21] life
[1:25:22] believed
[1:25:25] no natural Act
[1:25:29] just believed
[1:25:31] they heard the word preached
[1:25:34] and we're glad rejoiced
[1:25:37] and they that were ordained to eternal
[1:25:41] life see that's Supernatural
[1:25:43] oh
[1:25:45] so now it comes down to what is in the
[1:25:47] heart of the individual
[1:25:50] all of the outward displays that people
[1:25:53] do and all that don't mean nothing
[1:25:55] it's what the God by his supernatural
[1:25:58] act Supernatural power placed in that
[1:26:03] soul
[1:26:05] can you say man so the question is were
[1:26:09] you predestinated to eternal life or not
[1:26:12] did God place that Gene seed in you
[1:26:15] before the foundation of the world or
[1:26:16] not
[1:26:18] knocked did you dance
[1:26:20] did you shout did you run around the
[1:26:23] building or not
[1:26:27] that's not the question
[1:26:29] the question is do you have the gene
[1:26:32] seed in you to believe
[1:26:34] to Rejoice to receive the word
[1:26:39] and if you have that gin seed you were
[1:26:42] ordained to believe
[1:26:45] and you will believe no matter what
[1:26:48] skeptic says no matter what the critic
[1:26:50] says no matter what condition you're in
[1:26:52] you're coming out
[1:26:54] because God we're doing that
[1:27:01] notice
[1:27:03] Ephesians 2 1 and you hath he
[1:27:07] quickened
[1:27:10] who were what
[1:27:11] dead entrespasses and sins
[1:27:16] I like that
[1:27:18] not not this
[1:27:19] because you ran around the church where
[1:27:23] you quickened
[1:27:26] not because you jumped up and done a
[1:27:29] shot
[1:27:32] that you were quick
[1:27:34] no
[1:27:36] not because you played the music like
[1:27:38] angels
[1:27:40] that you were quickened
[1:27:42] not because you could preach such a
[1:27:44] sermon that everybody just oohs and alls
[1:27:46] nope
[1:27:48] and you hath he
[1:27:52] Quicken it's a supernatural act
[1:27:55] where in time past you walked past tense
[1:27:58] the M came
[1:28:00] you walked according to the course of
[1:28:02] this world according to the prince of
[1:28:04] the power of the air the spirit that now
[1:28:07] present tense worketh in the children of
[1:28:09] Disobedience that spirit will continue
[1:28:12] working in people but not in you the
[1:28:16] believer
[1:28:18] hey
[1:28:22] you believe it
[1:28:25] among whom also we had all we all
[1:28:29] had past tense our conversation in times
[1:28:32] past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling
[1:28:35] the desires of the Flesh and of the mind
[1:28:36] and were by Nature
[1:28:39] the children of Wrath even as others but
[1:28:41] got
[1:28:42] everybody say but God
[1:28:43] Supernatural God
[1:28:45] who is rich in Mercy his Mercy is so
[1:28:48] Supernatural
[1:28:50] for his great love Supernatural love
[1:28:53] wherewith he loved us even when we were
[1:28:56] dead in sins had nothing to do with you
[1:29:00] had you not searching God you had
[1:29:02] nothing to do with it you were dead in
[1:29:05] your sins hath quickened us together it
[1:29:09] with Christ for by Grace everybody say
[1:29:12] by Grace you are saved
[1:29:15] this body is an attribute of God's grace
[1:29:20] the grace of God
[1:29:22] it's a supernatural act
[1:29:25] and hath raised us up together and made
[1:29:28] us sit together who did it
[1:29:32] God did it Christ
[1:29:36] see so we are coming back to the Eternal
[1:29:39] thoughts of God
[1:29:41] of what he thought of you to be
[1:29:46] he didn't leave you out
[1:29:48] he loved you
[1:29:51] listen Ephesians 1 4 is this all right
[1:29:55] according as he hath chosen Us in him
[1:29:57] before the foundation of the world
[1:30:00] that we should be what
[1:30:02] holy
[1:30:04] and Without Blame
[1:30:08] before the Pope
[1:30:11] before the president nope before our
[1:30:15] co-worker nope before the preacher no
[1:30:18] before him
[1:30:22] now that's what makes a difference
[1:30:25] the god that can't forget forgets
[1:30:28] that God within an infinite knowledge
[1:30:34] that there ain't even a flea that could
[1:30:36] come up on this Earth without God
[1:30:38] knowing it
[1:30:39] and there ain't not one flea that come
[1:30:41] has come up on this Earth through the
[1:30:42] whole span of time that God hasn't known
[1:30:45] Every Beat of every flea of every
[1:30:48] heartbeat and the measure of breath
[1:30:51] And yet when God looked upon you notice
[1:30:54] now he chose you in him before the
[1:30:57] foundation of the world why that you
[1:30:59] should be holy and Without Blame before
[1:31:01] him
[1:31:03] in love
[1:31:06] having predestinated us
[1:31:08] unto the adoption
[1:31:10] of children
[1:31:12] by Jesus Christ to himself according to
[1:31:15] what because he had to
[1:31:17] oh no he wasn't forced to save you
[1:31:21] didn't have to do nothing
[1:31:24] that he did it according to his pleasure
[1:31:27] good pleasure
[1:31:30] of his own will
[1:31:32] and you say Amen
[1:31:33] so there was no way to be quickened
[1:31:36] unless God had placed his Jean seed in
[1:31:38] you
[1:31:40] now notice any son the prophet says is
[1:31:42] the attributes of his father and just as
[1:31:45] you were in the genes of your father and
[1:31:46] the body of your father when he was a
[1:31:48] young boy you were in him yet he could
[1:31:51] not have fellowship with you because he
[1:31:53] didn't know you see but then through the
[1:31:56] bedding grounds of a mother you were
[1:31:59] brought forth into the Earth and become
[1:32:02] in the image of your father then he
[1:32:04] could have fellowship with you well and
[1:32:07] so were you sons of God and Daughters of
[1:32:09] God before there was even before even
[1:32:12] was a moon stars or a molecule you were
[1:32:16] Sons and Daughters of God for your are
[1:32:19] only the physical manifestation of the
[1:32:21] attributes that was in God at the
[1:32:22] beginning
[1:32:23] see it's become flesh
[1:32:26] see for for there's only one form of
[1:32:29] eternal life and that was you before
[1:32:34] you don't know nothing about it neither
[1:32:36] did you know when you was in your
[1:32:38] Earthly father but you are manifested
[1:32:39] too in His image and in the image of God
[1:32:42] you are made and you were manifested for
[1:32:44] the glory and The Fellowship Of God
[1:32:47] and therefore as sure as your Gene had
[1:32:49] to be in your father before your natural
[1:32:51] birth your spiritual Gene had to be in
[1:32:53] God because you're an expression of the
[1:32:55] attributes of his thoughts before the
[1:32:58] foundation of the world so again what
[1:33:00] did God
[1:33:01] thought of you he didn't think of you as
[1:33:04] a sinner he didn't think of you as a
[1:33:05] liar he didn't think you it was a lowed
[1:33:08] down rock no good individual he's
[1:33:10] thought of you as holy righteous
[1:33:13] a son of God
[1:33:16] oh praise God everything that God is he
[1:33:20] thought of you
[1:33:21] [Music]
[1:33:22] holy righteous clean loving
[1:33:27] peace and you say Amen
[1:33:31] and it had nothing to do with you
[1:33:33] dancing in the spirit
[1:33:35] had nothing to do with you shouting had
[1:33:37] nothing to do with you dancing had
[1:33:38] nothing with you nothing
[1:33:41] it didn't even have nothing to do with
[1:33:43] you going to church
[1:33:45] you come to church because well brother
[1:33:47] Brown said what I do for God
[1:33:49] I do because I love him
[1:33:55] so the genes of the man is in the woman
[1:33:58] this is what the prophet's saying the
[1:34:00] genes of the man is in the woman and
[1:34:02] that's what makes the woman and that's
[1:34:04] the way the word of God is in the church
[1:34:07] it is what makes the church the bride
[1:34:12] so the genes
[1:34:14] that's in the man that makes the woman
[1:34:16] the word of God in you is the same way
[1:34:20] that's what makes you blind
[1:34:25] you say man
[1:34:26] so this Bride is a creation of the
[1:34:31] supernatural
[1:34:33] the gene of God can you say man
[1:34:37] so I think as I said this morning
[1:34:40] that God has to supernaturally create
[1:34:43] faith in you
[1:34:45] for you to believe you you can't believe
[1:34:46] on your own
[1:34:48] God has to supernaturally you could you
[1:34:51] could sit under message all you want the
[1:34:54] whole entire life
[1:34:58] and if God doesn't create the faith in
[1:35:00] you
[1:35:04] hire in you
[1:35:07] no matter how much elegant words no
[1:35:09] matter how much the spirit of God Falls
[1:35:12] it won't work
[1:35:15] that's why we go back to really what
[1:35:17] counts and that is the creation what God
[1:35:21] created in you
[1:35:23] and the first part of that creation is
[1:35:26] desire
[1:35:31] amen
[1:35:33] so again many times people look to the
[1:35:36] outward manifestations as the Jew look
[1:35:39] to the sacrifice
[1:35:42] of the natural lamb
[1:35:46] the Jew looked to the Natural lamb
[1:35:48] natural Act
[1:35:50] for his salvation and too many people
[1:35:53] look to the Natural Things
[1:35:56] just as the Jew did to the lamb
[1:36:02] so we say well if I just quit this or
[1:36:06] that then I know I'm a Christian
[1:36:08] so then we put all the emphasis on don't
[1:36:11] do this do that don't do this do that
[1:36:14] red Brown said you do not come to Christ
[1:36:17] by do's and don'ts
[1:36:21] right
[1:36:22] well if I do this or if I do this or
[1:36:25] don't do that or whatever then I know
[1:36:27] I'm going to interrupture
[1:36:29] try it
[1:36:31] okay so you go a month doing it right
[1:36:35] oh great because the word to God I'm
[1:36:37] going in a Rapture and then you fall
[1:36:39] flat on your face
[1:36:42] I don't know no I don't know if I'm
[1:36:44] going
[1:36:45] I made a mistake
[1:36:48] right
[1:36:50] has nothing to do with it
[1:36:59] I tell you brother Brown said it this
[1:37:01] way it's the predestinated seed that's
[1:37:04] going in the rapture
[1:37:13] so I'm going to be bold
[1:37:15] the Rapture could come in five seconds
[1:37:18] and in one second you fall flat on your
[1:37:21] face
[1:37:22] and make a mistake
[1:37:28] one second
[1:37:31] three seconds in between or four seconds
[1:37:33] in between the Raptors coming and you
[1:37:35] fall flat on your face and you make a
[1:37:37] mistake
[1:37:40] does God have to say oh
[1:37:46] my George I don't know what I'm gonna do
[1:37:48] with them
[1:37:49] I'm trying to get them all straight
[1:37:50] where they all live right for at least
[1:37:53] five minutes
[1:37:55] so I can bring on a rapture
[1:38:00] only the predestinated
[1:38:03] is going in Iraq
[1:38:09] so remember the seed has to be in the
[1:38:12] soul
[1:38:14] right
[1:38:15] no matter how religious you are in your
[1:38:17] spirit and what kind of fleshly
[1:38:19] manifestations you produce it has to be
[1:38:22] a supernatural act of God in your soul
[1:38:27] now brother Branham said and I'm trying
[1:38:29] to close I appreciate your patience man
[1:38:31] you're thinking man I used to be the
[1:38:33] most popular preacher in Pawnee because
[1:38:36] when I started preaching I was only 10
[1:38:37] minutes and the children loved me
[1:38:40] oh yeah I didn't have to give candy like
[1:38:42] I do now
[1:38:46] yeah
[1:38:48] so
[1:38:52] brother Brian said thousands of signed
[1:38:55] workers have created a generation of
[1:38:58] signed Seekers
[1:39:00] that knows nothing about the true move
[1:39:03] of God and his word in these last days
[1:39:06] can you imagine
[1:39:08] thousands of signed workers have created
[1:39:11] a generation of signed Seekers
[1:39:14] give them blood and oil and fleshly
[1:39:16] demonstrations on the platform and
[1:39:18] they'll support it
[1:39:20] whether it's of God or not
[1:39:22] whether it's the word of God or not
[1:39:24] whether it's scripture or not see
[1:39:27] God as I said this morning God never
[1:39:29] placed signs ahead of his word
[1:39:32] never never
[1:39:33] right
[1:39:35] he never places gifts ahead of his word
[1:39:37] he never places prophecy ahead of his
[1:39:40] word he never places dreams and Visions
[1:39:43] ahead of his word he never places
[1:39:45] emotions ahead of his word he never
[1:39:48] places Sensations ahead of his word
[1:39:52] and I I believe that I can safely say
[1:39:55] that God never places his anointing
[1:39:58] ahead of his word
[1:40:03] yes the word is Anointed
[1:40:06] but how many times people are anointed
[1:40:09] and not anointed to the word
[1:40:12] and people see the anointing and say
[1:40:14] let's go for it babe
[1:40:21] right
[1:40:22] forget about the word
[1:40:26] but God never places the anointing ahead
[1:40:29] of his word
[1:40:30] the word is always before the people
[1:40:35] right
[1:40:37] what we want to get to is the words
[1:40:39] before our eyes
[1:40:42] I've set your word before my eyes
[1:40:45] can you say man
[1:40:49] so I can say that about that anointing
[1:40:52] because remember Balaam was anointed
[1:40:54] with the genuine Holy Spirit he
[1:40:56] prophesied and his prophecy was true
[1:41:00] but his teaching was wrong
[1:41:02] his Doctrine was wrong can you say man
[1:41:06] his teaching was false which the prophet
[1:41:10] made him a false prophet
[1:41:12] so the Bible prophesies that in the last
[1:41:14] day there shall come false prophets not
[1:41:17] false Jesus
[1:41:19] false christs
[1:41:21] men who are anointed but not to the word
[1:41:24] it's a genuine anointing he says that
[1:41:27] make people dance shout prophesy speak
[1:41:29] in tongues
[1:41:31] can you say amen he said but the word
[1:41:34] Bears record of itself
[1:41:38] in other words you can take God at his
[1:41:40] word without anything else amen because
[1:41:44] it Bears record of itself
[1:41:46] prophecies a lot of times don't bear
[1:41:48] record with the word dreams Visions uh
[1:41:50] Goosebumps Sensations and and emotions
[1:41:54] and all of that a lot of times don't
[1:41:55] bear record with this word
[1:41:57] but the word Beer's record of itself
[1:42:02] can you say man so it doesn't need
[1:42:04] anything else the prophet said for it
[1:42:06] Bears record to itself
[1:42:10] has nothing to do with it being
[1:42:12] prophesied over has nothing to do with
[1:42:15] it having a dream or a vision has
[1:42:17] nothing to it someone having a dream or
[1:42:19] a vision about you has nothing to do
[1:42:21] with it
[1:42:25] was raised in that Pentecost where it
[1:42:28] was always had to be dreams Visions
[1:42:30] always had to be something prophesying
[1:42:34] and if if someone didn't get you know if
[1:42:36] you didn't get prop site over someone
[1:42:37] else did you just felt let down why
[1:42:39] didn't they prophesy over me
[1:42:40] you know you know as a pastor pastor
[1:42:43] always got this certain woman certain
[1:42:45] woman always had Visions about for the
[1:42:47] pastor you know never about anyone else
[1:42:50] hardly and you're just thinking well why
[1:42:53] why why would that be why is it always
[1:42:55] Visions well the pastor always leaned
[1:42:58] upon that woman it it you know
[1:43:01] if people are watching you know I just
[1:43:04] I'm gonna say it you know it's almost
[1:43:06] become so dependent upon dreams it's
[1:43:08] almost like going to a soothsayer or a
[1:43:10] or a hand or a pond read or whatever
[1:43:12] tell me my fortune tell me my fortune
[1:43:14] tell me my fortune I'm serious you could
[1:43:18] have a division oh God's going to
[1:43:19] prosper give it a month well I ain't had
[1:43:21] no vision from sister so and so I wonder
[1:43:24] what's happening
[1:43:26] you understand what I'm saying well we
[1:43:29] depended upon them things
[1:43:32] but what about the word
[1:43:35] and I'm going to tell you young people
[1:43:38] same thing
[1:43:40] I know we got gifts in the in the
[1:43:41] message
[1:43:43] which
[1:43:46] don't bring Revival
[1:43:49] you say oh so-and-so's coming they got
[1:43:51] the gifts it don't bring Revival
[1:43:54] and you start depending on that you're
[1:43:56] going back to a Pentecostal ideology
[1:43:58] because I was there I know what it was
[1:44:01] brother Walker you were there
[1:44:04] brother Terry and them was there
[1:44:06] if any of you been in that Pentecostal
[1:44:08] time you understand what it was all
[1:44:10] Sensations it was a roller coaster
[1:44:14] loves me loves me not loves me whoa
[1:44:17] well why does he love you because he Pro
[1:44:19] I got prophesied over I I got excited I
[1:44:22] actually got out and danced give it two
[1:44:24] months and it's just dry
[1:44:27] I don't know if he loves me
[1:44:29] and you say man
[1:44:31] see so the prophet said see don't have
[1:44:33] nothing to do with this inside
[1:44:36] outside has nothing to do with inside
[1:44:39] now now I hope you understand I hope
[1:44:41] you're making it I'm making it clear to
[1:44:43] you you don't let the devil misinterpret
[1:44:45] things that I'm trying to tell you but
[1:44:47] but I am telling you the truth
[1:44:49] unless he says unless that was God's
[1:44:52] seed his Gene from the beginning
[1:44:54] predestinated you're finished Prophet
[1:44:57] say all you want to
[1:45:00] let them do shindigs all they want to if
[1:45:03] the seed ain't there it's finished it's
[1:45:05] over it's done
[1:45:10] is I don't care how much you shout speak
[1:45:12] with tongues run shout that has nothing
[1:45:14] to do with it
[1:45:16] a cockleberg can count just as much as
[1:45:18] any of the rest of them I've seen
[1:45:20] heathens raised shout speaking tongues
[1:45:22] drink blood out of a human skull and
[1:45:24] call on the devil any of them Sensations
[1:45:26] and things forget it
[1:45:29] can I tell you that forget it
[1:45:36] he said it's your heart in that word
[1:45:40] get it put your heart in the word
[1:45:44] put your faith in that word
[1:45:47] and that's Christ
[1:45:49] bring him there and watch it make it
[1:45:52] self-known just as it opens up like any
[1:45:55] other seed and declares itself for the
[1:45:57] age it's living in can you say Amen so
[1:46:01] notice notice where the predestinated
[1:46:03] elective God stand
[1:46:05] he says How can any messenger Sin from
[1:46:07] God believe only part of the word and
[1:46:10] deny some of it
[1:46:12] now I I'd love to read this to them
[1:46:15] Renegade preachers that are teaching the
[1:46:18] people
[1:46:19] that brother Branham only had opinions
[1:46:21] some hearing this and then you know uh
[1:46:25] uh what what he said on some doctrines
[1:46:27] if you can't find in the word ignore it
[1:46:30] that was just his opinion now here
[1:46:33] brother branham's answering them critics
[1:46:34] and tell them how can he messenger Sin
[1:46:37] from God believe only part of the word
[1:46:39] and deny some of it the true prophet of
[1:46:41] God in this last day will proclaim the
[1:46:45] whole word denominations will hate him
[1:46:49] and people in this own message will hate
[1:46:51] him
[1:46:54] his words may be as harsh as John the
[1:46:57] Baptist who called them vipers but the
[1:47:00] predestinated
[1:47:01] will hear and be ready for the rapture
[1:47:06] the rule Seed of Abraham with the same
[1:47:09] Faith as Abraham's faith will hold the
[1:47:11] to the word with him for they are
[1:47:14] predestinated together
[1:47:16] then you say Amen
[1:47:18] do you love him see it's the Deep
[1:47:21] calling into the deep
[1:47:22] now I'm closing
[1:47:26] but I want to hit on this for just a
[1:47:28] moment
[1:47:29] even our calling in gifts
[1:47:33] are Supernatural
[1:47:36] Ephesians 4 11.
[1:47:38] says that he gave some Apostles some
[1:47:41] prophets some evangelists some pastors
[1:47:43] and teachers
[1:47:47] in the Pentecostal rim
[1:47:52] preachers were birthed
[1:47:55] simply because someone prophesied over
[1:47:58] them and told them they were called to
[1:47:59] preach
[1:48:03] but the Bible says God set in his church
[1:48:07] pastors prophets teachers evangelists
[1:48:10] Apostles can you say man
[1:48:14] well at the Burning Bush Moses heard a
[1:48:16] supernatural voice calling him and
[1:48:19] commissioning
[1:48:21] brother Brandon says and no man has a
[1:48:24] right to preach the gospel until
[1:48:25] secretly back on the back side of the
[1:48:28] desert he stood on the ground with him
[1:48:31] and God Alone
[1:48:33] there's no intellectual being in the
[1:48:35] world could explain it away from you
[1:48:36] that's right you were there you know it
[1:48:40] happened
[1:48:42] ain't that right
[1:48:44] gifts and callings are without
[1:48:45] repentance and they are ordained before
[1:48:47] the foundation of the world
[1:48:50] now
[1:48:51] we might we might pray over somebody
[1:48:55] see a gift in their life and pray with
[1:48:57] them but that does not mean
[1:49:00] that we put a gift in them
[1:49:03] that means we the prophet says this he
[1:49:07] said he's talking about Paul Paul laid
[1:49:09] hands on Timothy to sanction sanction
[1:49:12] his ministry
[1:49:13] and he said and knowing that the gift
[1:49:16] was in him
[1:49:18] and they seen it work
[1:49:22] right
[1:49:24] they seen it at work
[1:49:27] and they just give him the right hand of
[1:49:29] Fellowship to bring him into the service
[1:49:31] of God
[1:49:32] now I'm going to read this and I'm
[1:49:33] closing in question and answers a man
[1:49:36] asked brother Branham a question he said
[1:49:38] brother Branham I've heard
[1:49:40] you uh you should be back he says I've
[1:49:43] heard you say I should be back in the
[1:49:45] ministry and that and I have thought
[1:49:48] upon it myself but have waited upon some
[1:49:51] definitely word from him about it up to
[1:49:54] date it hasn't come now since I know the
[1:49:57] end is so near should I still wait for
[1:50:00] the Lord to speak to me or would he be
[1:50:02] pleased to tell you what to tell me
[1:50:05] since I know you're his spokesman's for
[1:50:07] the day
[1:50:09] well now this brother his answer he says
[1:50:13] I got wrote down here my answer to it
[1:50:16] God calling this brother a call in his
[1:50:18] life he said now there's one great thing
[1:50:21] we could just take as a Texan preach all
[1:50:23] night on it at one thing a calling make
[1:50:27] your calling and election sure
[1:50:31] we don't want to be just wondering if
[1:50:34] we're called
[1:50:36] you must be called or you will be
[1:50:40] defeated
[1:50:42] were fighting a battle
[1:50:45] then you say man
[1:50:47] now our calling is is in anything
[1:50:50] and if you are positive sure brother
[1:50:53] that your calling is of God and you've
[1:50:56] been called of God to do a work he said
[1:50:58] now there's a great trick
[1:51:01] there that the enemy can play on you he
[1:51:04] can make you think you're not called
[1:51:06] when you're called then he can turn
[1:51:08] around back around and make you think
[1:51:10] you're not called or make you yeah you
[1:51:13] are called when you're not called vice
[1:51:15] versa either way
[1:51:17] and you have to watch it
[1:51:21] now here's the way to do it he said well
[1:51:23] now this is advice only thing I can only
[1:51:26] thing I can give on this is advice so
[1:51:29] now Prophet knows his boundaries right
[1:51:32] he said I can only give advice
[1:51:35] he said but make sure that your calling
[1:51:39] comes from God
[1:51:42] then check your motives and objectives
[1:51:46] right
[1:51:50] now you know what I mean by that what is
[1:51:53] your motive for preaching
[1:51:57] he said well see if you think it was an
[1:52:00] easier job than what you have then you'd
[1:52:02] better forget it
[1:52:03] it wasn't a call
[1:52:05] right
[1:52:07] he said a call of God burned so in your
[1:52:11] heart
[1:52:13] till you can't rest day or night for it
[1:52:16] you just can't get away from it it's
[1:52:19] just constantly grinding at you
[1:52:23] and if you had to preach well now
[1:52:26] another objective I believe at the job
[1:52:29] I've got if I could be a successful
[1:52:31] evangelist or Pastor have a good set
[1:52:34] salary have a home that I could go into
[1:52:36] and so forth and live I believe that
[1:52:39] would be a good thing much easier than
[1:52:41] what I'm doing now see and really I
[1:52:43] think it would be he said well see your
[1:52:45] objective is wrong to begin with it's
[1:52:47] not right
[1:52:49] he said and you're wrong there on that
[1:52:53] and you say Amen
[1:52:55] I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna put my thing in
[1:52:59] here for just a moment because I got to
[1:53:00] thinking the other day
[1:53:02] we have got
[1:53:05] churches rising up everywhere it's just
[1:53:07] churches
[1:53:09] do you realize how many churches set
[1:53:12] without pastors today
[1:53:15] it's incredible
[1:53:19] you realize that we barely got
[1:53:21] evangelist on the field I mean in in our
[1:53:23] message ranks
[1:53:26] we may have four
[1:53:28] good evangelists
[1:53:31] that
[1:53:33] that are out on the field
[1:53:36] now
[1:53:39] I was talking to a brother a while back
[1:53:41] and it just hit me
[1:53:43] God is the one that sets the the pastors
[1:53:47] evangelists prophets teachers
[1:53:51] all that in the church
[1:53:54] so my question as I began to think about
[1:53:57] this
[1:53:59] is God not been able to supply the
[1:54:04] demand
[1:54:10] because it sure seems like it
[1:54:12] we've got people sitting in churches
[1:54:14] without pastors for 10 years
[1:54:20] so what's happening
[1:54:27] we've got young men
[1:54:30] that should be on the field
[1:54:33] yeah they won't just
[1:54:35] go established churches
[1:54:38] what's funny to me about this
[1:54:41] is the established churches right around
[1:54:43] where churches are
[1:54:48] when they should be out there preaching
[1:54:50] with a burden for people
[1:54:53] hello
[1:54:55] but you see what's happening
[1:54:58] but when God says that's what I'm trying
[1:55:00] to get to you tonight
[1:55:01] God has to do this thing
[1:55:05] and when God puts the call there's a
[1:55:07] real burden there
[1:55:10] to where God can put you in your place
[1:55:16] now see you're he says now see if you're
[1:55:19] just thinking this is going to be an
[1:55:20] easy job you know why a lot of people
[1:55:24] here you know why people established in
[1:55:26] churches these days
[1:55:28] yeah let's just put it plainly it's
[1:55:30] because they got mad at the church they
[1:55:32] get we're at
[1:55:34] some some preacher thought he was better
[1:55:36] than the pastor
[1:55:37] Pastor wasn't doing a good job got
[1:55:40] egotistic
[1:55:42] so he found some complainers
[1:55:44] pulls them away starts a church
[1:55:49] or
[1:55:50] some group of people one person money or
[1:55:54] whatever
[1:55:56] gets mad can't come under subjection
[1:55:59] so he just says well
[1:56:01] I'm leaving
[1:56:03] the problem with this is he talks to
[1:56:05] other people in the church
[1:56:07] and he starts Awakening things up in
[1:56:09] their lives
[1:56:11] really I never noticed that before
[1:56:15] and before you know it he's got a group
[1:56:17] pulls him away now they're praying for a
[1:56:19] pastor please God send me a pastor send
[1:56:21] us a pastor oh God we need a pastor
[1:56:28] it just blows my mind
[1:56:31] but this body
[1:56:33] it has to be God doing it it's a
[1:56:35] supernatural act
[1:56:44] now brother Brown would say then you
[1:56:45] would say well maybe because you know I
[1:56:49] think that maybe I'd be more popular
[1:56:51] among the people and you'll find out
[1:56:54] you're just ready for a big flop
[1:57:00] but now if your objective is that I
[1:57:04] don't care if I have to eat soda
[1:57:05] crackers and drink Branch water I'll
[1:57:08] preach the gospel anyhow
[1:57:10] something just tearing into you I'll
[1:57:12] preach the gospel or die
[1:57:14] then you'll go somewhere because it's
[1:57:17] God dealing with you
[1:57:19] and you say man
[1:57:20] you don't care if you're preaching on
[1:57:22] streets you're going to do it because
[1:57:23] it's God dealing with you
[1:57:26] right
[1:57:28] God is making himself known to you
[1:57:30] because it is God that just won't let
[1:57:35] you rest
[1:57:38] and usually a god-called man never wants
[1:57:41] to do it
[1:57:43] he said did you ever think of that
[1:57:46] he said just recently it was asked of Me
[1:57:49] by some very precious Brethren and said
[1:57:51] now that we come in the way brother
[1:57:53] Branham now that we found the Lord and
[1:57:54] received the Holy Ghost shall we seek
[1:57:56] gifts for our ministry that we should do
[1:57:58] he said don't ever do that don't ever
[1:58:02] never advise people to do something like
[1:58:04] that because usually a guy that wants to
[1:58:06] do it is a guy that can't do it it's the
[1:58:09] guy that tries to run from it is the one
[1:58:12] that God uses if he's trying to get away
[1:58:14] from it old brother see I tell you the
[1:58:17] calling's in me woo man but I'd hate to
[1:58:19] try it see well there you are that's the
[1:58:21] one trying to run see amen if he wants
[1:58:25] to do it so bad the first thing you know
[1:58:27] he finds himself a stuffed shirt like
[1:58:29] you say God you give me power to move
[1:58:31] mountains I tell you I'll do something
[1:58:33] for you if you let me move mountains
[1:58:34] well he ain't gonna do that he because
[1:58:37] he can't get him he can't even move
[1:58:40] himself to the right attitude so he had
[1:58:42] never moved Mountains for God see just
[1:58:44] take for instance like Paul you think
[1:58:46] Paul could have gotten away from his
[1:58:48] calling oh brother he couldn't do it it
[1:58:50] was just grinding at him day and night
[1:58:52] till he left his church he left
[1:58:54] everything and went down see and I
[1:58:56] believe it was Asia wasn't it so he
[1:58:58] stayed three years down there studying
[1:59:00] the scriptures to find out whether it
[1:59:02] was right or not to find out whether God
[1:59:04] had really called him so if God is
[1:59:07] calling you brother and it keeps digging
[1:59:09] at your heart then I'd say lay every
[1:59:11] aside every weight and the sin that does
[1:59:13] so easily beset you but if it's not
[1:59:15] digging at you then I I wouldn't think
[1:59:18] too much about it then then you say Amen
[1:59:20] if the musicians will come I'm going to
[1:59:23] read one more quote because I it applies
[1:59:25] to this brother Branham someone asked
[1:59:27] said brother Brandon do you think that
[1:59:29] God would speak
[1:59:30] or he's answering that second part do
[1:59:33] you think that God would speak to you to
[1:59:35] tell me notice what his answer is he
[1:59:38] said I believe that God would speak
[1:59:39] straight straight to him
[1:59:41] because you know God see
[1:59:44] he said we're not too big but what he
[1:59:47] can speak to us and he'll speak to us
[1:59:49] all right he'll speak to us and I tell
[1:59:51] you if he told me then the brother might
[1:59:54] say well he told Brother Branham so
[1:59:57] praise God but you see it ain't brother
[2:00:00] Brown I'm giving you the call it's the
[2:00:03] Lord Jesus given you the call and if
[2:00:06] it's the Lord Jesus giving you the call
[2:00:08] he'll do the speaking
[2:00:10] I could speak to you to your ears but
[2:00:13] when Christ calls you to the ministry
[2:00:15] it's in your heart
[2:00:17] and that's where the thing has to Anchor
[2:00:20] and you can't get away from it now if
[2:00:23] there's any questions to it that a man's
[2:00:26] call has to be in his heart coming from
[2:00:28] God he said I know who this is that
[2:00:30] wrote this and I know a precious brother
[2:00:33] gracious brother that I truly believe
[2:00:35] has a call that I wouldn't want him to
[2:00:38] do it on mine see that's the reason I
[2:00:40] answered the way I did upon me saying
[2:00:42] well yes brother so and so ought to go
[2:00:44] into the ministry see he said now you
[2:00:46] say well brother Branham told me ought
[2:00:48] to do that and maybe what if something
[2:00:50] happened to brother Branham I get killed
[2:00:52] die or get away see then see your
[2:00:55] calling is over then but if Jesus calls
[2:00:58] you Brethren as long as there's an
[2:01:01] eternity it'll still be ringing out and
[2:01:04] then you know
[2:01:06] where you're standing
[2:01:08] Say Amen then you know so you see it's
[2:01:12] the supernatural it it takes everything
[2:01:14] is the supernatural
[2:01:16] your calling your election
[2:01:18] comes from Supernatural
[2:01:20] that way you're saying you ain't gonna
[2:01:23] say well I got prophesied over 10 years
[2:01:24] ago well what if that person goes
[2:01:27] Haywire
[2:01:28] and what happens to you
[2:01:30] then you don't know where you're
[2:01:31] standing can you say man you love him
[2:01:34] hope it was a help to you tonight amen
[2:01:37] let's just sing the song I'm in this

[2:16:36] I can stand
[2:16:39] secure
[2:16:43] right upon my heart
[2:16:48] the truth that says
[2:16:56] according to
[2:17:00] [Music]
[2:17:02] they're just asking for us to pray
[2:17:06] bind together believe together with them
[2:17:09] for their son
[2:17:10] that is in a home but he's got hernia a
[2:17:15] hernia and he's he's really hurting
[2:17:18] and he don't understand
[2:17:22] what's happening
[2:17:24] and so he can't speak doctors or I get
[2:17:29] well or the people that's caring for him
[2:17:31] really can't communicate and so they
[2:17:35] don't know how because he's just just
[2:17:37] having a hard time taking care of him
[2:17:39] handling him they don't know if it's
[2:17:41] anxiety pain whatever it would be it's
[2:17:44] going to take four to six weeks for him
[2:17:46] to get into surgery
[2:17:49] but we just know that a God can come
[2:17:51] down and touch and bring peace to that
[2:17:55] situation how many believers do we have
[2:17:59] now church I I remember getting metal or
[2:18:02] copper in my eye when I was doing
[2:18:05] electrical I had two chunks go in my eye
[2:18:09] and it was hurting so bad I had to quit
[2:18:12] I couldn't see I it was just throbbing
[2:18:15] watering
[2:18:17] and I remember as I guess it was two
[2:18:19] hours away from home window drove me
[2:18:22] home and it was just hurting and I
[2:18:26] didn't know what to do and I remember a
[2:18:30] song came across
[2:18:32] uh in my mind will thou be made whole
[2:18:36] and and it just kept ringing in my ears
[2:18:38] without being made whole and I realized
[2:18:41] it was God's speaking
[2:18:43] and I said Lord I will be made whole
[2:18:46] you know instantly the pain left I
[2:18:49] cleared up and it wasn't and that was
[2:18:52] years ago
[2:18:54] maybe when faith in them was like four
[2:18:58] or five years old and happened to be
[2:19:00] about five years six years ago that them
[2:19:04] two pieces came out of my eyelid
[2:19:07] they were bent in my eye all that time
[2:19:11] but God made it to where it would never
[2:19:13] touch my eyes
[2:19:14] now I just believe that whether it God
[2:19:17] dissolves the the the the hernia or the
[2:19:22] or he has to go through surgery but God
[2:19:25] can take that pain away right now
[2:19:27] amen and then dissolve it so let's just
[2:19:30] pray could you just lift your hands and
